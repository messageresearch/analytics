[0:00] so that scripture um you know I've read
[0:03] it a lot of times and it's helped me in
[0:05] my personal life but here Paul this is
[0:09] chapter 4 Paul is is telling the
[0:12] Corinthians that the the very um light
[0:16] and
[0:18] temporal Affliction it it's it's a very
[0:21] light and it's temporal and it's that
[0:24] compared to the Eternal weight of Glory
[0:27] but um if you go to 2 Corinthians 12 7
[0:30] and 10 here he's talking about a
[0:33] different thing he's uh ex crying out to
[0:37] the Lord here he says and lest I should
[0:40] be exalted above measure through the
[0:42] abundance of the revelations there was
[0:44] given there was given um me uh given to
[0:48] me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[0:50] Satan to Buffet me lest I should be
[0:53] exalted above measure for this thing I
[0:56] besought the Lord Thrice and that it
[0:59] might depart from me so here Paul he's
[1:04] um struggling here yet in the other
[1:07] scriptures he says our Affliction is
[1:09] very light and it's very um it's just
[1:12] for a moment and here in in um when he's
[1:16] talking about his Thorn there's no
[1:18] indication that Paul found any joy in
[1:21] this
[1:22] Thorn um he didn't he wasn't content of
[1:25] in the presence in fact he was very
[1:28] troubled and it earn early and earnestly
[1:31] desire to be free from it he he cried to
[1:34] the Lord three times Lord take this away
[1:37] from me so at first he couldn't even see
[1:41] any spiritual benefit in this Thorn he
[1:44] didn't see any sanctifying purpose in it
[1:46] it seemed like an overwhelming burden
[1:49] which which is why precisely he prayed
[1:52] Lord take this away from me so this
[1:56] is first he's telling us that affliction
[2:00] is just for a moment and it's very very
[2:03] light he's given us a perspective here
[2:06] because we we're all going through
[2:08] something one way or another whether
[2:10] it's a physical pain whether it's
[2:13] through a family whether it's going uh
[2:15] Financial issues whatever it might be
[2:17] we're going through a pain we're going
[2:19] through some kind of valy we're going
[2:20] through something that we say Lord take
[2:23] away this Thorn take away this this
[2:25] trouble that we're going through but
[2:27] Paul's giving us an eternal perspective
[2:29] and say is as just a little one compared
[2:32] to what God has in store for us but then
[2:35] now you see Paul in his situation he
[2:38] said Lord take it away from me Lord take
[2:41] this away from me and and honestly
[2:43] whenever we're going through our
[2:45] situations it's easy to forget the
[2:48] vision yeah it's easy to forget the
[2:51] perspective that God wants us to have
[2:54] whenever we're going through something
[2:56] you know it's so easy to have faith for
[2:58] somebody else right it's so easy to say
[3:00] you know what brother I'm praying for
[3:02] you you're going to get up and you're
[3:03] going to do this again but let us have
[3:06] the same thing and we say Lord why me
[3:08] Lord why am I going through this but
[3:11] there there's a certain cloudiness a
[3:14] certain uh thing that takes away our
[3:16] vision takes away our perspective and
[3:19] that is called suffering that is called
[3:22] Affliction and Paul he needed to be
[3:25] reminded saying everything works for
[3:28] good to those who love God God needed to
[3:32] remind him why he was going through
[3:34] these things 2 Corinthians 12 verses 9
[3:39] and 10 this is Jesus answering him he
[3:42] said and he said unto me my grace is
[3:45] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[3:48] made perfect in
[3:50] weakness Mo so here's that's Jesus he
[3:54] says my grace is sufficient for thee and
[3:56] my strength is made perfect in weak
[4:01] now Paul he sees this he gets another
[4:04] perspective he of of the word he sees
[4:07] what the Lord is doing and he says most
[4:10] gladly therefore I will rather glory in
[4:13] my infirmities that the power of Christ
[4:16] May rest upon me and there he says
[4:19] therefore I take pleasure in infirmities
[4:22] in reproaches in Necessities in
[4:24] persecutions in distress for Christ's
[4:27] sake for when I am weak then then I am
[4:30] strong now there is nobody that can wor
[4:33] Worship the Lord and glory in their
[4:35] infirmities nobody's like oh thank you
[4:38] Lord for another one thank you Lord that
[4:40] I'm suffering but when God can give you
[4:43] an opening a vision a perspective of why
[4:48] you're going through this and saying hey
[4:50] I'm here with you I'm in the darkness
[4:53] with you I'm leading you through these
[4:56] things then you can say Lord thank you
[4:59] Father
[5:00] thank you and not only that but Jesus
[5:02] says that my grace is sufficient my
[5:05] strength is made perfect now we all know
[5:08] what that word perfect is it's to be
[5:10] complete right my my strength is
[5:14] perfected in you Paul says wow so when
[5:17] I'm in this problem when I'm in this
[5:20] struggle therefore I am strong I am
[5:24] strong in the Lord whenever I'm weak in
[5:26] this flesh I am weak in my life
[5:29] but Brothers often it's difficult to
[5:32] discern God's purpose through the lens
[5:35] of
[5:35] suffering suffering it has a way of
[5:38] clouding our perspective and making it
[5:40] Challen challenging to see beyond the
[5:43] immediate pain or hardship when we're
[5:46] first uh when we're in the midst of
[5:48] difficult circumstances whether it's a
[5:50] loss of a loved one Health crisis
[5:52] Financial struggles relation relational
[5:55] Brokenness and you could fill that in
[5:58] whatever you're going through it's it's
[6:00] hard to see that it can feel as if
[6:02] everything is chaotic and and the most
[6:06] the thing that we have to worry about or
[6:08] not worry about but watch out for is
[6:10] that it's all of it is without meaning
[6:14] that's where we have to be careful that
[6:16] our suffering our this chaotic life that
[6:19] we're going through whatever we're going
[6:21] through is without a meaning that's when
[6:24] a person can go into dark roads right
[6:27] because there is no purpose there see
[6:30] Paul is saying our light Affliction it's
[6:33] it's
[6:34] working towards an eternal weight of
[6:37] Glory it's working for something but you
[6:41] take that working out you take that
[6:44] meaning that purpose that perspective
[6:47] out right and a person can become
[6:50] resentful right bitter yes
[6:55] lost they they they don't have their
[6:58] faith is gone why because their anchor
[7:01] is
[7:02] gone Romans 8:28 it says that and we
[7:07] know all things work together for good
[7:10] to them that love God and to them who
[7:13] are called according to his
[7:17] purpose we have to take that to heart
[7:21] when we're going through those things we
[7:23] have to take that say everything works
[7:26] for
[7:27] good everything works for good but it's
[7:30] hard for a lot of people to see that
[7:33] Vision because they begin to compare
[7:36] what shall be to what is now right oh
[7:39] Lord Lord you said you're going to give
[7:41] me this but look at me now we look at
[7:44] our present condition we look at the
[7:45] situation we're going on now then it's
[7:48] hard to see the
[7:50] promise I I believe if we want to think
[7:53] about the children of Israel that's
[7:55] exactly what happened to them they
[7:57] actually they didn't look at their
[7:59] present condition but they were looking
[8:00] at the condition back there and say ah
[8:03] we were actually better off over there
[8:06] brother branam in the message Christ
[8:08] speak he was talking about how Moses had
[8:11] the vision and because Moses had a
[8:14] vision he was able to take all of the
[8:16] people out of Egypt because he saw them
[8:19] as perfect people when Pharaoh he saw
[8:22] them and they're just bunch of uh mud
[8:25] dobbers and and worthless slaves but
[8:29] when Moses saw him he had a different
[8:31] perspective right he saw the children of
[8:34] God and whenever he got the children of
[8:37] God and he began to take him to the
[8:38] promised land he knew what the purpose
[8:41] was he knew what the goal was the goal
[8:44] was the promised land but a lot of times
[8:48] man when hunger begins to start whenever
[8:50] things start happening in our lives we
[8:52] begin to murmur and we say man the
[8:54] garlic was better out there right we
[8:57] need to have that perspective that the
[8:59] Lord wants to show us the problem with
[9:02] suffering is is we focus on the
[9:05] now present discomfort and uncertainty
[9:09] our vision be begins to be uh narrow
[9:12] centered solely on the pain we're
[9:14] experiencing this makes it hard to see
[9:17] the bigger picture of God's plan we may
[9:20] struggle to understand how our suffering
[9:22] could fit into a larger Divine Purpose
[9:25] or why God would allow us to go through
[9:27] such trials that
[9:29] a lot of times it's a why me a lot of
[9:32] times is why do I have to go through
[9:34] this what's happening here but it's
[9:36] because we're focusing on what is going
[9:38] on now I really like what brother
[9:41] Brandon every time he talks about Jonah
[9:44] and um you know he has a lot of things
[9:46] to say about Jonah but when Jonah was in
[9:49] the belly of the fish the whatever you
[9:51] want to call it he says that he was in
[9:54] the worst condition we could ever find
[9:55] ourselves in he said whenever he looked
[9:58] here he saw whales belly he looked there
[10:01] he saw whales belly when he looked there
[10:03] he saw whales belly that was his
[10:05] perspective right then and there that's
[10:08] where he was at that was his condition
[10:11] brother bandam says that was his
[10:13] symptoms we look at our symptoms we look
[10:15] at our condition we see what's going on
[10:17] in the family we see what's going on
[10:19] with sons and daughters we see what's
[10:21] going on at work whatever is going on
[10:23] and that's all whales belly but but
[10:26] Jonah he chose to have a vision
[10:30] he chose to listen to God's word and he
[10:33] says all that I see are lying
[10:36] vanities man to say that your present
[10:39] condition is nothing but a lie that's
[10:41] bold to say to say that oh well sister
[10:45] you have this well you're going through
[10:48] this brother you're you have that but
[10:50] that's a
[10:51] lie maybe the the doctor can say this
[10:54] maybe my situation can say this but
[10:57] they're all lying vanities cuz I'm
[10:59] looking toward your temple Lord I'm
[11:02] looking toward your
[11:03] word in Proverbs 29:18 it says where
[11:08] there is no vision the people perish but
[11:11] he that keepeth the law happy is
[11:14] he now that that's a for me that's a
[11:17] very profound scripture um the word
[11:21] Vision it's I believe it's pronounced uh
[11:24] kazon kazone something like that chazon
[11:29] but it's vision and it's it's what it
[11:31] says it's a sight it's a dream or it's a
[11:35] revelation or an oracle it's a spiritual
[11:39] sight of God or it's
[11:42] prophecy so where where there is no
[11:45] Revelation the people
[11:47] perish when there's that not that
[11:51] contact with the word being made
[11:53] manifest to us there there's a perishing
[11:57] going on in us um brother brandham says
[12:00] in the message come let us reason
[12:02] together he says I put my arm around him
[12:05] a real brother I said my beloved brother
[12:10] every time you open up the Bible you see
[12:12] a vision God revealing himself here is
[12:16] God's Vision just open it up open and
[12:19] say God now open my eyes that I can see
[12:24] you the word is God in the beginning was
[12:27] the word and the word was um with God
[12:30] and the Word was God and the Word was
[12:31] made flesh and dwelled Among Us and he's
[12:34] here God and every time you open up the
[12:37] Bible you see a vision of God speaking
[12:40] forth to you set with a humble heart so
[12:44] every time we see God's word and God
[12:46] says don't
[12:47] worry every time God's word tells you
[12:51] that there is another way that is a
[12:54] vision that's a vision outside of the
[12:57] condition even if if we're in a
[12:59] condition of a habitual condition where
[13:02] we can't get out we can't get out of of
[13:06] our uh present condition of maybe
[13:09] lukewarmness who knows what it
[13:11] is his word takes us out his word will
[13:16] always help us out Vision it keeps you
[13:20] moving when you see something then you
[13:23] can walk to it because you're looking at
[13:25] the destination it's something you can't
[13:28] touch but it's there you're you can see
[13:31] it you're walking towards it now the
[13:34] word to perish because it says where
[13:37] there is no vision the people perish now
[13:40] people start beginning to think like oh
[13:42] my goodness we're going to we're going
[13:43] to die we're going to perish but this
[13:45] word actually means to be loose to be
[13:48] loosened of restraint bear go back make
[13:53] naked set not perish or
[13:56] uncover so where there's no living
[14:00] Revelation no perceived contact between
[14:02] God and man there the bonds which hold
[14:05] the people together are relaxed and
[14:07] broken yeah good whenever there's when
[14:10] we cannot see the word when there is no
[14:13] vision when we don't have our our hearts
[14:15] towards the word of God then what
[14:18] happens is we begin to lose restraint we
[14:21] see that in the children of Israel every
[14:24] time the man that had the vision when he
[14:26] would leave the scene what happened the
[14:28] mice would go out to play When the cat
[14:30] is gone right and that's the same thing
[14:32] when we don't have the word when the
[14:35] word is not within us every single day
[14:37] then we begin to break down we begin to
[14:41] lose restraint we begin to to uh see our
[14:45] issues and and and begin to be formed
[14:49] and transformed by the issue that we
[14:54] have we begin to be
[14:57] defeated and um change a lot of people
[15:02] um sometimes they lose that vision and
[15:05] when you lose that Vision what happens
[15:07] whenever we're going through a struggle
[15:09] we lose the vision of the word what
[15:12] happens well then it's easy to as simple
[15:15] as not coming to church as simple as as
[15:19] uh not wanting to serve the Lord anymore
[15:21] why there's no meaning purp this this
[15:24] Affliction without meaning then we don't
[15:27] see the goal
[15:30] then it's easy to
[15:32] just become bare like the word says
[15:36] perish lose restraint from our
[15:40] lives a lot of times a person can walk
[15:43] into that just continue to walk a
[15:46] Christian walk without knowing the
[15:50] destination let me just keep walking but
[15:52] they don't have the vision anymore
[15:54] they've lost restraint and they're
[15:56] walking suffering without a purpose or
[15:59] with without
[16:02] purpose here in second Corinthians the
[16:05] the verse that we read in the beginning
[16:07] he says for our light Affliction which
[16:10] is um but for a moment worketh now I
[16:13] really want to hit that word worketh for
[16:16] us a far more exceedingly an eternal
[16:20] weight of Glory The New International
[16:23] Version says instead of worketh it says
[16:27] achieving New Living trans translation
[16:29] says yet they
[16:31] produce English uh Standard Version says
[16:36] preparing so it's it's a
[16:39] producing that our Affliction doesn't
[16:42] only uh we just don't just go through it
[16:45] so that we can get to a goal but it's
[16:48] actually
[16:49] producing the Eternal weight of glory
[16:53] amen that that Eternal weight of Glory
[16:56] that we're waiting on that we're looking
[16:59] at it not it's not necessarily out there
[17:03] but day by day we're producing it I I
[17:07] don't want to take away from this
[17:09] eternal weight of Glory but just like in
[17:11] uh Corinthians I believe 3:18 it says
[17:15] whenever they you behold the glory you
[17:17] become the glory from Glory unto
[17:20] Glory so there there's there's a sense
[17:23] of every struggle that we go through
[17:26] every daily life that we live we are
[17:28] becoming that glory and we're growing
[17:31] into
[17:32] that there's a
[17:34] preparing there there is a growing into
[17:37] that Glory every single moment every
[17:41] single suffering that we're going
[17:43] through and that gives your suffering
[17:47] purpose so this glory is not uh is not
[17:51] going to only be a consequence of these
[17:53] AFF afflictions but the afflictions will
[17:56] be the cause of it yeah
[18:00] it will be the cause of your actual
[18:04] Glory every single thing that you go
[18:07] through that's Glory being
[18:11] manifested here he says
[18:15] that the glory of God has not is not
[18:18] only a reward that it comes after
[18:20] suffering but it's all the very thing
[18:22] that is being worked through us as we
[18:25] Face the trials the afflictions we adore
[18:28] endure they're not pointless nor they're
[18:31] not just merely obstacles in the way of
[18:34] Glory but they are the very tools God
[18:37] uses to bring us into the fullness of
[18:40] his glory shaping us preparing us to
[18:43] reflect his divine presence in a deeper
[18:46] and more profound way Romans
[18:51] 5: 3 to4 it says not only so but we
[18:56] glory in
[18:57] tribulations also knowing that
[18:59] tribulation worketh patience and
[19:02] patience experience and experience hope
[19:07] the word experience a lot of people want
[19:08] to translate that as character the word
[19:12] I think it's dominik or it's a strange
[19:14] word but it it's actually
[19:17] trustworthiness that our tribulation
[19:20] it's working into a perfect image or
[19:24] character of
[19:25] Christ this suffering that we're going
[19:28] through and jesus' suffering and death
[19:30] was not merely a means of to secure his
[19:33] glory but it was progressively
[19:36] revealing and making manifest the very
[19:40] uh image of God his suffering was it was
[19:44] manifesting God so Jesus says the son of
[19:48] man has to is going to be
[19:50] glorified and whenever he said that then
[19:53] he said but if a seed falls on the
[19:55] ground and lest it die it will not bring
[19:57] forth anything but when it
[19:59] dies will bring forth much fruit so his
[20:03] death his suffering was going to bring
[20:06] forth you and I his suffering was going
[20:10] to bring forth
[20:12] life brother brandham he says this in
[20:15] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[20:17] the samiran church age he says you see
[20:20] they could not figure out God's
[20:23] love they thought love meant no
[20:26] suffering they thought love meant a baby
[20:29] with parental care but God's said his
[20:34] love is elective love the proof of his
[20:38] love is election that no matter what
[20:41] happened his love was proven truly by
[20:44] the fact that they were chosen unto
[20:46] salvation because God had chosen you
[20:49] unto salvation through the sancti
[20:52] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[20:54] of the truth he may commit you to death
[20:57] as he did Paul
[20:59] he may commit you to suffering as he did
[21:01] job that is his
[21:03] prerogative he is Sovereign but it is
[21:07] all with a purpose that that comforts me
[21:11] there let me die let me suffer but it's
[21:14] all with a purpose man purpose is
[21:18] greater than gold the Bible says by the
[21:21] like the trial of your
[21:22] faith is more precious than gold why
[21:26] there's a purpose there if he did not
[21:29] have a purpose then he would be the
[21:31] author of frustration and not of Peace
[21:34] his purpose is that after we have
[21:36] suffered a while we would be made
[21:39] perfect be established strengthened and
[21:43] settled as job said he puts strength in
[21:47] US job
[21:48] 23:6 you see himself you see he himself
[21:53] suffered he learned obedience by the
[21:56] things he
[21:57] suffered we want know obedience we want
[22:00] to know Lord let me get closer to you
[22:02] man there's going to be a lot of
[22:04] suffering a lot of going through things
[22:08] and it's not that so much that God's
[22:09] like ah put them in the fire but it's so
[22:11] much where where we go through things
[22:15] knowing that we are Cut From a Different
[22:17] Cloth we're we're we're different than
[22:20] the world because you know I I have just
[22:26] to give you a little insight and um I'm
[22:28] sure we can see this everywhere but I I
[22:30] have an uncle that he he's he went
[22:32] through so much he went through so much
[22:34] rejection he went through so much in his
[22:37] life to where in the end of his life he
[22:41] was just you did one thing wrong to him
[22:44] that's it you're cut off he he built
[22:48] himself so many barriers and so many
[22:51] complexes in his life to where nobody
[22:53] can touch him nobody's going to hurt me
[22:57] nobody and and sometimes we think we're
[22:59] we're protecting ourselves like that we
[23:01] think we're by creating a wall of of a
[23:05] hard heart of bitterness of oh I'm not
[23:08] talking to that person no more I'm not
[23:09] going to do this no more I'm not going
[23:10] to do that for them no more and we feel
[23:12] like we're protecting our heart but
[23:14] what's going on is enclosing ourselves
[23:17] right we're we're we're creating all of
[23:20] these strongholds in our lives so that
[23:23] the devil can sit there and say ah we
[23:25] got them ah yeah look at now we're we're
[23:30] the ones on top but we're sitting there
[23:34] hurt feeling like we're we're uh safe in
[23:38] these complex walls but we're literally
[23:42] in
[23:43] prison we're in
[23:45] strongholds we're in things that that
[23:49] simply we cannot forgive no
[23:51] more we can't love properly
[23:55] anymore but whenever a person can look
[23:59] at purpose and look at the greater thing
[24:02] look at what Jesus is
[24:04] doing then you can every lash that you
[24:08] take every trial that you take you know
[24:12] thank God is for a
[24:14] purpose thank God Lord Praise Your holy
[24:18] name and in one day through all of that
[24:22] suffering and trials God will use it for
[24:25] his perfection
[24:28] so he says the very character of Jesus
[24:31] was perfected by suffering according to
[24:34] Paul he has left the church a measure of
[24:38] suffering that they too by faith in God
[24:42] will suffer for
[24:44] him would God come in place uh come into
[24:48] a Perfection why did he want this James
[24:51] 1: 124 he says brother count it all joy
[24:55] when you fall into diverse Temptations
[24:57] knowing this is that the trying of your
[25:00] faith worketh patience but the patience
[25:02] have her have her perfect work that ye
[25:06] may be perfect entire wanting
[25:10] nothing you know every Mark that Jesus
[25:13] had everything that he went through it
[25:16] was all for a
[25:18] purpose in uh Isaiah 53 2-12 we know
[25:22] that scripture a lot but just to see the
[25:26] perspective of that he hath borne our
[25:29] griefs verse four so think about it his
[25:35] grief was a purpose to Bear
[25:38] ours he carried our
[25:41] sorrows yet we esteemed him stricken
[25:44] smitten of God and
[25:46] Afflicted he was wounded for our
[25:50] transgressions now I just want you to
[25:53] think about that and personalize it you
[25:55] were
[25:56] wounded but brother Bram just said in
[25:59] this the the quote that I gave you that
[26:01] he has a portion of suffering for his
[26:03] bride that there's a portion of
[26:05] suffering for the
[26:07] church and you have to think that your
[26:10] wounding your suffering is for a purpose
[26:13] for somebody
[26:17] else he says he was wounded for our
[26:20] transgressions he was bruised for our
[26:22] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[26:24] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[26:27] healed
[26:29] praise God everything that he went
[26:32] through think of just just to think
[26:35] about I don't know if everybody
[26:36] anybody's watched The Passion of the
[26:38] Christ I I can't that's that's a hard
[26:41] movie to just
[26:43] watch and and that's probably not even
[26:46] half of it what he went through the
[26:49] suffering in gsem all everything that he
[26:52] had to go through think about every
[26:54] lashing that he took my name was on
[26:57] there yeah amen everything was for a
[27:00] purpose and what if he said I'm
[27:03] done why cuz he was looking at the
[27:05] present condition and he says I'm done
[27:07] with this but a brother Bram says that
[27:11] his hardest moment was at the Garden of
[27:13] Gethsemane because that's where he made
[27:15] his choice to give his life to the Lord
[27:18] or give his life for the
[27:20] world that's where he made his hardest
[27:23] choice and that's why he said
[27:25] Lord just run the books again look over
[27:29] everything again and see if there's
[27:30] another way that's what he basically
[27:32] said if it's not if it's your will let
[27:36] this cup pass from me
[27:38] Lord said it's my will for you to
[27:41] die Let It Be Your Will then and there
[27:45] he accepted the suffering and then after
[27:48] that he already made his decision after
[27:51] that then the suffering came but he made
[27:54] his decision to suffer for us and every
[27:57] mark
[27:59] our name is on it your healing is on
[28:02] those marks those stripes that beating
[28:06] that death that cry we were in
[28:10] that suffering it can cause
[28:15] bitterness
[28:17] when when we think our suffering is
[28:21] unfair unending or beyond control this
[28:25] sense of hopelessness or Injustice it
[28:27] will would often breed negative emotions
[28:31] resentment anger deep sense of of being
[28:35] wronged you know the sad part of of
[28:37] bitterness is is that you're the
[28:42] victim that it it's not that you're a
[28:45] bad
[28:46] person that the but the the the person
[28:49] that's receiving this bitterness is the
[28:52] victim they're the ones that have been
[28:54] hurt they're the ones that have caused
[28:57] there's pain that's caused to them and
[29:00] yet if they do not see the purpose of
[29:03] God or see the word or forgive for
[29:06] forgive whoever is hurting them then
[29:08] they become full of resentment anger
[29:13] bitterness I truly believe with all of
[29:15] my heart Jesus wasn't a
[29:18] victim I believe this was in Isaiah
[29:23] 532 hundreds of years before Jesus even
[29:26] died God already prepared his suffering
[29:29] yes what about
[29:30] ours but we look at it right now and I'm
[29:34] the victim and I'm I'm the one that's
[29:35] being hurt and and forget all of them
[29:38] but yet God already pre-ordained
[29:41] that even before the foundation of the
[29:44] world the lamb was already
[29:48] slain and Jesus had to understand those
[29:51] words and to understand the prophecy
[29:54] that was behind him and there's I
[29:56] believe with all of my heart heart
[29:58] there's prophecy behind us there's
[30:01] prophecy for the bride today yes she is
[30:05] to endure suffering yes she's in uh
[30:09] ready to endure it though she's
[30:13] pressurized she she's built for
[30:17] pressure she's built for all of these
[30:20] things because God gave it to
[30:23] us from our limited perspective our
[30:26] human perspective the pain it seems
[30:29] overwhelming but God's Eternal
[30:32] perspective sees beyond that moment he
[30:35] sees everything that's why we have to
[30:37] get into this word not because of
[30:40] historical context not because of
[30:42] anything else but because this is a
[30:45] vision of our
[30:46] future this is what shows us how we're
[30:49] going to overcome am that we are more
[30:52] than Overcomers you know I I know we've
[30:56] probably heard it a lot of times in
[30:57] churches while it's like oh one day
[30:59] we're going to just drag drag ourselves
[31:02] to heaven and we're going to say we
[31:04] finally made it we finally made it with
[31:07] bruises and cuts the the Bible doesn't
[31:09] say that though it says that we are more
[31:13] than
[31:14] conquerors now we're not just a
[31:16] conqueror because just a conqueror can
[31:18] just barely make it we're more right
[31:22] we're going to go there and we're going
[31:24] to be beholding or we're going to be
[31:26] bearing all of these things but these
[31:28] are going to be our
[31:30] Victory your your scars your wounds are
[31:33] the means for the glory that you re
[31:38] him everything Jesus suffered it was for
[31:41] his glory his glory was being manifest
[31:45] by the whippings by the suffering by by
[31:48] the hunger by all of that his glory was
[31:50] being
[31:52] manifested and
[31:55] now we see him here in
[31:58] uh he died and he rose
[32:03] again and we see him with
[32:05] scars and that's a beautiful
[32:08] thing because Jesus he didn't need to
[32:11] have scars in his glorified body now
[32:14] this was Ultimate fulfillment or
[32:17] ultimate
[32:19] Glory his glorified
[32:22] body and in his glory he Beed every
[32:26] single scar that he had
[32:28] wow our problems it's either going to
[32:31] defeat us or it's going to develop
[32:34] us we're either going to become people
[32:37] like the world hateful and no love right
[32:40] or we're going to become glorified yes
[32:44] we're going to be and what did he do
[32:46] with those
[32:47] scars man look at what you guys
[32:50] did look at look at the pain you've
[32:53] caused me no when somebody was
[32:57] unbelieving beling when somebody was
[33:00] weak in
[33:01] faith when Thomas was like I I don't
[33:04] know if I can believe him I don't know I
[33:07] don't know if if he's the one he's said
[33:10] the only way I'll be able to believe him
[33:12] is to see his
[33:14] scars he said come here Thomas look
[33:17] it that his car was not just to show
[33:22] what he suffered but it was a
[33:23] confirmation of the miracle of
[33:26] Resurrection I'm the the same one that
[33:29] died and your scars your suffering your
[33:32] things that you went through is a
[33:34] confirmation of your Miracle of what
[33:37] you've gone through in your
[33:39] life so that you can become that person
[33:42] to somebody
[33:43] else somebody's going through it
[33:46] somebody's going through an unbelieving
[33:48] phase somebody's going through a trial
[33:50] that they can't go through and you can
[33:52] go and show them your scars and say this
[33:54] is what I've gone
[33:55] through this is how God gave me the
[33:58] miracle gave me the
[34:01] promise you become
[34:04] that what do your marks testify
[34:09] today what do my marks my trials all my
[34:14] wounds that I've gone through what are
[34:15] they saying about me man grumpy grumpy
[34:19] guy he didn't want to talk to nobody or
[34:22] he's this and he's
[34:23] that man I you know you close yourself
[34:27] off
[34:28] you you you try to hide but what is it
[34:31] we became a victim of these things when
[34:34] there's prophecy over your
[34:36] trials how can I become a victim of what
[34:40] God already pre-ordained
[34:42] how could I be that no I become That
[34:47] Glory for somebody
[34:49] else how when somebody's struggling you
[34:52] begin to sympathize or empathize with
[34:55] that
[34:56] person how I I remember there's a um a
[35:01] brother that preached a message I
[35:02] already forgot what it's called but it's
[35:04] basically the gift of suffering or the
[35:08] gift of
[35:09] understanding and it's he was talking
[35:11] about how you could understand somebody
[35:14] else's
[35:15] grief how do we do it because a lot of
[35:18] times you know you see a a bum in the
[35:20] streets or you see somebody that's
[35:21] struggling like oh man poor guy here let
[35:23] me give him a dollar man poor guy and
[35:25] then we forget him about that person
[35:28] that's normal that's human life right
[35:30] there but when we enter into their
[35:34] pain when somebody can that that was the
[35:37] gift of Jesus Christ that's why Jesus
[35:41] could enter into
[35:43] pain it it it actually helped that he
[35:46] could he knew what they their whole life
[35:49] so he knew when they were babies he knew
[35:52] when they were smiling when then
[35:54] everything was good and then he knew
[35:55] when everything changed yeah when the
[35:59] trouble
[36:00] started when the problems happened saw
[36:03] and he's like Ah that's why that's why
[36:07] he could see talk to Legion and just
[36:08] like brother brandham said oh first it
[36:11] was one drink was one devil next drink
[36:15] another devil until it was legance of
[36:18] devils that's how much he
[36:21] drank brother brandham he saw that in
[36:24] people there was one time where brother
[36:27] Bram he was praying for a Mexican man in
[36:31] a prayer
[36:32] line and this man would he he the way he
[36:35] explain is just amazing but his his face
[36:37] was just all wrinkled and he was missing
[36:40] shoes and he was he couldn't say
[36:43] anything I think he had a um what is a
[36:46] rosary and he was he was there a
[36:48] Catholic man and when he saw that
[36:52] man he said that's my
[36:54] dad what did he do he entered into to
[36:57] his
[36:58] pain because he already suffered through
[37:01] that with his father he already went
[37:04] through those things he had a
[37:06] scar he was able to help somebody
[37:09] because of his own wounds his own
[37:12] scars he said hey Dad that's what he
[37:16] called him hey Dad come up here started
[37:20] looking at his shoe took off his shoe
[37:22] and checked his foot and it didn't fit
[37:24] him but what did he do he entered into
[37:27] his pain
[37:29] there was one time where you know we
[37:32] know the story of how him and his wife
[37:34] they suffered and and his wife ended up
[37:38] dying his then he's there seeing his
[37:41] baby daughter looking at
[37:43] her says that she was suffering so much
[37:47] that her eyes began to
[37:48] cross that's that's a suffering of of a
[37:52] man that suffering that we go through
[37:55] with our family that that's suffering
[37:58] when there's a a loved one that passes
[38:00] on that's a suffering when when a child
[38:03] doesn't want to serve the Lord that's a
[38:05] suffering whenever we're we're going
[38:07] through sicknesses we're going through
[38:09] those
[38:10] sufferings but we what do we use those
[38:13] sufferings for yeah are we mad are we
[38:16] bitter are we close off the world or we
[38:18] begin to use our own scars to heal
[38:22] others he said there will never be
[38:25] another person that's cross-side that
[38:27] will not be
[38:29] healed that's what he said because of
[38:32] his own daughter he said God will never
[38:34] permit it every person that's crosy
[38:37] would have been was going to be healed
[38:39] in a prayer line he said why because his
[38:42] heart went out for that person so much
[38:45] cuz he would his daughter every
[38:47] time the gift of understanding somebody
[38:51] suffering the gift of bearing your own
[38:54] scars
[39:02] he didn't have to
[39:04] suffer he didn't have to go through
[39:06] those things he did it for us there was
[39:09] one time when the devil when he you know
[39:12] his daughter died the
[39:14] devil God rejected him a black sheep
[39:17] came down and the devil began to say oh
[39:20] you trusted in him you did all these
[39:22] things for him and look at he just
[39:25] rejects you
[39:27] he he starts doing that and he said at
[39:29] my weakest
[39:31] moment see Paul he had a weakest moment
[39:34] Paul could tell us hey there there's our
[39:36] light Affliction just for a moment but
[39:39] yet when he's in it he said Lord take it
[39:41] away Lord help me why when you're in
[39:45] it just as a human if it wasn't for God
[39:49] we would break if it wasn't for God
[39:52] where would we be yes and there the
[39:55] devil's trying to do the same thing
[39:57] saying just reject him just just turn
[40:01] away and he says if it w if it hadn't
[40:04] been for that moment if it hadn't been
[40:07] for
[40:09] God taking me through he said there
[40:12] would no be not be a church here he was
[40:14] talking about
[40:16] Jeffersonville brother we wouldn't have
[40:18] a message right brother we we wouldn't
[40:21] have the
[40:22] word revealed through a
[40:25] prophet if he he caved
[40:29] in and and sometimes we look at our
[40:32] issues we think oh lord it's just let me
[40:34] just throw the towel but had it not
[40:37] been for the Lord bringing you
[40:42] through there there wouldn't be people
[40:44] serving the lord now there wouldn't be
[40:47] people blessed by your life if you
[40:50] didn't if you didn't uh um give your
[40:55] heart to the Lord if you didn't over
[40:57] come that
[40:59] trial Jesus you know I I heard a brother
[41:02] once say and it's a funny little quote
[41:05] but he said there's only one man-made
[41:06] thing that that is in heaven he said
[41:10] that's the scars that Jesus
[41:13] has Jesus he chose to take it to
[41:17] Heaven whenever they announced the lion
[41:20] they he saw bloody
[41:22] lamb he saw a wounded person I bear my
[41:27] scars I bear my trials I bear everything
[41:30] because our names are on
[41:32] that our names are in this in his
[41:36] suffering we are
[41:38] there even to the point where the Jews
[41:41] are going to be saved through the S the
[41:43] scars of Jesus they're going to say who
[41:47] who are you and then they he shows them
[41:49] his scars and he says who who Did That
[41:51] to You Lord he said from the the house
[41:55] of my friends
[41:57] my own people my own loved ones so by
[42:01] the the whole salvation is through this
[42:03] this suffering that Jesus had to go
[42:06] through the bride is going to go through
[42:09] the same
[42:10] thing and um as I'm kind of closing I I
[42:14] started thinking about
[42:16] Joseph his story is is remarkable
[42:19] because it's an example of how problems
[42:21] and trials can either defeat or develop
[42:24] us fa facing this immense suffering that
[42:28] Joseph
[42:29] did um everything that he' gone through
[42:33] but his faith his wisdom and ability to
[42:35] forgive led him to a place of prominence
[42:38] and purpose he was not defeated by his
[42:42] circumstances but developed into a
[42:44] leader God intended him to be this
[42:48] narrative encourages us to view our
[42:50] struggles through the lens of God's
[42:53] purpose trusting that even the hardest
[42:55] challenges can lead to spiritual growth
[42:58] and fulfillment of uh God's greater
[43:01] plan whenever his his brothers they saw
[43:07] him and they cried because he finally
[43:11] revealed himself to
[43:12] them they they said they were
[43:16] scared and he
[43:18] said you thought of
[43:21] evil you thought evil against me but God
[43:26] meant it unto good to bring to pass as
[43:30] it in this day to save much people
[43:34] alive so every suffering that he went
[43:36] through his brothers they hated him he
[43:39] was he he was a little rascal but God
[43:42] gave him a vision or a dream what the
[43:46] Bible says they gave him a dream of him
[43:50] being a great man him being over all of
[43:53] his brothers being over his um own
[43:55] father and mother and even the father
[43:58] and mother were like even we're going to
[44:00] have to worship you we're going to have
[44:02] to bow down to you and the brothers
[44:04] resented him so much that they threw him
[44:06] into a pit and they wanted to kill him
[44:08] but one of the brothers repented and
[44:10] they sold
[44:11] him suffering suffering what do you
[44:14] think he went through what do you think
[44:16] he thought in his mind I wonder if he
[44:19] begin to think about that vision and
[44:22] sayl was was that just did I just sleep
[44:25] too late did I just eat too late or was
[44:29] this you
[44:31] Lord I believe he believed in that
[44:35] Vision I believe he stood on that word
[44:38] because he kept his
[44:40] Integrity whenever he was sold to potier
[44:44] his Piper's wife um um falsely accused
[44:48] him he was put into
[44:50] prison he even helped the Baker and the
[44:53] the Butler and the butler forgot about
[44:55] him
[44:57] all of these
[44:59] things all of these trials where he
[45:01] could have said I give up yet every
[45:04] single piece every single trial was a
[45:09] step closer to his
[45:11] glory that was a piece a part of the
[45:15] puzzle so whenever we're going through
[45:17] our things our going just remember
[45:20] that's just a step that's just a step to
[45:23] the glory that's another step that's
[45:27] another reason that's another purpose
[45:29] that's another uh
[45:31] achievement to the glory that God is
[45:34] going to give
[45:35] me there finally when they saw him he
[45:38] said you thought evil God meant good
[45:44] right no matter what is going on no
[45:46] matter what anybody can Tre how they
[45:48] treat you they could think bad things
[45:51] people can think they can dis the devil
[45:53] can think he could distort God's plan
[45:56] but God me means it for good he means it
[45:59] for your Victory he means it for the
[46:02] glory let us stand to our
[46:06] feet I I truly believe that every single
[46:09] scar is so that we can be a help to
[46:14] others that we could Rejoice with those
