TRANSCRIPT
========================================
continue on the where we were on Sunday as this has been a series on the house of the Lord a lot of things that we've touched on continue on Sunday but I'm just going to change the title a little bit it's going to be housed but homeless and so the idea is you're housed but yet you don't have a home and that's been something that's been a consistent theme in this house of the Lord and even though the title in the series implies the house of the Lord we're looking at this Dynamic that we've emphasized quite a bit in the beginning I'm going to repeating some things this evening on how that you could have all the image of a house but yet not have the real feeling of a home and that's what we're touching on the unhoused as we used it Sunday the unhoused and the homeless we use that kind of title to express that you can be the unhoused and you could be the homeless and it could be one person those could be two different people you could be uh without a home but yet have a house you could have a home but not a house and so there's different ways that you could describe that so the unhoused they lack that physical shelter and it it it focuses whether or not someone has a permanent place to put their possessions or lay their head or a permanent resident whereas to say someone that is homeless and we're looking at maybe even the evolution of our uh language even to the point to where we may not have traditional housing but they have a home and they they they're unhoused they don't have the physical structure but yet they have uh they feel a part of a community they have certain resources uh that they could draw upon they have access to certain relationships um and they have a sense of belonging to where they could be in a tent Community a home community of homeless people they don't have traditional housing but yet they feel like oh this I have some sense of Home in how I'm living and we used the example of a church like this one as a house and how this church would be a traditional place of gathering a traditional place of worship and how that someone could be as a Christian you can be housed because you go to church but yet homeless and we're using that example uh even tonight still drawing on that example that you could have a place of worship a place that you go a place that you attend and a place that you say that's your church but yet something's lacking in the experience that's not what a a church should be it's not that home church that brother brandham said that we ought to have and where we're focusing on as the issue is you could have um the unhoused we say oh the solution is just buy them a place to live but homelessness often isn't an issue of housing but it's an issue of vision and it's issue of character and even if we looked at the uh epidemic that we might have in our nation or in our city that sometimes there's a he healing that needs to take place where someone isn't able to work and not being able to work they're not able to make a living uh and and not making a living it leads to a housing crisis and so it could be physical disability it could be a mental health issues and so what they need is a healing they need something to minister to them in their actual need not just throw a house at them because there's some people in their condition that if you gave them a house they would squander it because they wouldn't have maybe the mental fortitude at that time and the mental illness and they don't want to waste it but they they struggle they have weaknesses they have sickness both in body or in mind and so it's not an issue just as merely giving them a place to live but it's a matter of um providing them a vision a life worth living and something to strive for it was characterized this way as I read it about that initial homelessness that became a crisis in America it was a loss of character and a perceived emerging emerging moral crisis that threatened leld ideas of home life now that phrase Lon held ideas of home life today I want to start looking at that idea of home life rather than on the lack of a permanent home so when this became an issue after the Civil War and in the industrial era and even into the turn of the century they weren't looking at it as oh these people need houses they're like these people need character uh they're they're not living the traditional they don't they don't value the ideals of a home life they don't IDE value the stability of home life they don't even value their role within a home because a man would just be out working and traveling around and maybe he sends money back maybe he tries to keep connected with home uh with his family but they recognized that it was a problem o of not being committed to a place homelessness was well there's no place there's no position there's no purpose a sense of belonging no value for things that had long been held as valuable we read it from Proverbs 29:8 where there is no vision and this is a Divine Oracle a revelation from God if I could put it this way where you do not know the will of God where you do not have an understanding of the will of God the people perish but he that keepeth the law who follows in his will happy is he so without a purpose life is perishing no matter how you're living it no matter how wonderful it may seem to be uh life cannot satisfy and it cannot bring the comfort and peace that one desires if they're not living according I'll say this about Christians those who ordained to follow God those who are his elect seed you cannot be happy unless you're keeping that law for your life that word for your life that will for your life so where you're living uh uh without purpose without Vision then you're going to be disappointed life is going to be uh just hit or miss it's perishing as the scripture says they'll perish they Wonder aimlessly they're not disciplined they're they're unrestrained so they can go here they can go there they can do this can do that and there's no no force or no uh principle that's guiding them and so we may be housed but without a purpose without intent without Vision brother was fellowshipping uh with me and just on his family and his vision he says that he needs to remind himself to be more intentional at times as a family and I think that's good that we need to think about what are we doing uh momentum can just kind of swallow us up where it's just kind of the uh uh it's physics we're just headed down the road a a and this certain inertia that we have and it just we just keep doing what we're doing and we don't stop to say what direction am I headed and do I need to apply some Force to it to get it going the right direction or to slow it down because life just has a way of accumulating and so if you don't you may be housed but if you don't have a vision you won't have a home one religious group defined it this way at the turn of a century or after the Civil War a crisis of men this homelessness was a crisis of men let loose from all the habits of domestic life wondering without aim or home remarkable to Define it that way that this was at the core again they weren't saying we need to have better housing we need to provide them with an apartment we need to excite them about a plot of land and a a nice mansion but it was more a character issue to where they had become untethered from the habits of domestic life and we're wandering without home and without an aim now I want to be able to run this in parallel because I think there's a spiritual parallel for us as individuals a and making our hearts home for the Lord Jesus Christ and finding our purpose and belonging in the body of Christ not in a church not in a public identity not in a group move and so there's this application that we could have to us as individuals and our coming to our place and our position understanding our role in the economy of God and and so that's always there but we're using Church life as an example of home life and and I do not believe that church life is the ultimate I believe Church affords us some types of the ultimate which is your individual life or your home life and we're using Church Life to say as we expounded upon it Sunday you could be housed in a church but not have a home Church you have a church house and some people have church in their house right and they tell themselves because they play tapes in their home that they have a church but yet when we really dig into what brother bandam said about what a church is there's more to it than than than just saying that you're going through the the Motions of something okay now let's answer this let's posee the question and then I have the luxury of being the one that ask it so I have all my material to answer it what is home uh when we speak of home what images arise and What feelings arise uh this has kind of a personal thing it means a lot to me and my family because we did travel extensively and even there was a point in 2019 where we were essentially homeless living out of a Buick Enclave until we got to the next stop and the next hotel or the next home and for 6 months once we were just on the road and we didn't feel that we had a home and and that house you know we had a house but yet even the children the children didn't necessarily think of that as home us being together is what made it home to where even after we had moved to North Carolina and we were there for three or four months uh Jack had asked the question is Dad done preaching here like when are we going to pack up the car and drive to the next stop a a and yet so there's an idea of that we had an idea of home that wasn't necessarily rooted in the house that we had built and so what what thoughts arise what images and feelings do we think about when we think about home and I want to look at two phrases home is where the heart is and just the utterance home sweet home and home suggest a community in some of the definitions it would have to imply some sort of traditions or rituals that are associated with your life a and things that a family does I think it's good to think of it this way cuz some families do things that your family don't do uh some families May uh well some families may not open Christmas gift at all but you know just for the sake of conversation uh some families may open all their Christmas gifts on Christmas Eve and then another family may open them all on Christmas morning and so when you enter another family through marriage and you're there and it's like Christmas Eve comes and the husband wants to open all the gifts like we don't do that well it's like who's the wi anymore right because this is a new family new family unit so there's there's Traditions that can be established or even kept that speak of what home is and how families are and our family do this and our family does that and every family is different and there's people who find themselves comfortable in families that are loud around the dinner table laughing at each other picking on each other and having a good old time and for some other people they may be like that would be an awful family there's families that get together on Thanksgiving and they all wear the same thing right and for some families there may be that particular Dynamic and it's toxic because you have one person who's controlling all of it and whose heart would be broken if you didn't show for Thanksgiving and it's more of manipulation and emotional abuse that does it but then for other families they're all excited about it because that's the every family is different and so the ideas of family of of a home it has to do with tradition and possessions and valuables and the phrase home is where the heart is as I tracked it back to a poem uh to where home is where the heart is published in 1829 that they don't get give an author to it but it kind of speaks to the idea and even the phrase now speaks to the idea that home and family this idea of home and the family that's there that's associated with are the greatest emotional bond that you may be somewhere but home is where your heart is the Bible even tells us uh that where your treasure is there will your heart be also so it's what you treasure it's what you value it's what's important and this uh poem published in 1829 it was used to express the idea that the physical structure is not the home where you are even presently in the manner of life you're living don't necessarily make it home but it's where you feel safe and comfortable and loved and and the poems that are a lot of them written kind of build looks like they're building off the same literature they speak of relationships and connections and belonging there was one published in 1836 called the home of the heart it's unsigned we don't know who the author is but it was published in Massachusetts and one of the stanzas is yet here's deep affection the wonderer to bless a mother's fond welcome a sister's caress isn't that right Sons yet here's deep affection the werer to bless the Wonder is blessed in this deep affection the mother's fond welcome as sister's caress far dearer than Cottage or proud princely dome for homes where the heart is and this is sweet I love how it just interrupts at the very end there and so it speaks of deep affection that one who is roaming finds and is blessed by when he comes back to that place and it identifies the mother's welcome or the sister's caress and it's better than a princely dome it's better than a cottage for home is where the heart is and that's sweet and so we also have the expression home sweet home and it expresses uh the pleasure at being in home or returning to home like oh I've been traveling I've come back home sweet home as I've already alluded to it the image of home is probably different for a lot of us uh individually there maybe some Vin diagram where it all overlaps for us but for some people home is in another country home is a particular place or it's a feeling that they can have in different uh in different areas but the idea of home that's that place of peace and provision and comfort safety and rest again we've said before a place of belonging it even is rooted in a place of beginning so something you're connected to or have a tie to John Howard Payne in the tradition of great poets uses all three names he uh writes the poem home sweet home sweet home and this is the one that brother brandham references several times I'll just read the whole thing just for cool points it says mid pleasures and palaces though we May Roam be it ever so humble there's no place like home the charm from the sky seems to hollow us there which seek through the world is near met with elsewhere home home sweet sweet home there's no place like home oh there's no place like home how s Sweet did his sit neath the Fawn father's smile and the caress of a mother to soothe and beguile let others Delight mid new Pleasures to Ram but give me oh give me the pleasures of home home home sweet sweet home there's no place like home oh there's no place like home to thee I'll return overburdened with care the hearts dearest soulless will smile on me there no more from that Cottage again will I roam be it ever so humble there's no place like home home home sweet sweet home there's no place like home oh there's no place like home oh give me no I could just start getting into poetry at this moment but you see the feeling of it and the meaning behind it and these different ones I'm referencing from 1829 this one from 1823 1836 when you begin to have this homelessness crisis after the Civil War and industrialism comes in and and cities where it's more um it's different different Lifestyles and you have men leaving the the Homestead to go work in in plants and those things the idea of Home becomes very different Transportation kind of expands The Horizon of where men can work and we have this moral crisis that threatens the long held ideas of home life these ideas of home life are expressed in these poems expressed in these lines of home sweet home and and there this is where the a Wonder finds is blessed by this deep affection and it talks about the mother and the sister and the father so it's these relationships and the love that each one has for another that when overburdened with care my heart's dear soulless will smile on me there it's a place where my burdens can be set free it's a place where though rejected and hurt elsewhere I can find acceptance and love there be it ever so humble there's no place like home I know you all as message Believers are familiar with all those different places that brother Branham quotes that very poem and as we used this scripture even over the last couple months in Isaiah 32:18 and the effect of righteousness is going to be this and my people shall dwell in a Peaceable habitation and in sure dwellings and in quiet resting places I said this is a perfect summary of what home ought to be that it's not the structure it's not the the uh it's not marble countertops it's not necessarily the crown molding in the living room and the things that would just trim something out to be gorgeous and very beautiful but this is what makes a place home that it's Peaceable it's sure and it's a quiet resting place that Peaceable habitation as we've emphasized before it's not a place of fighting it's not where you're sleeping with the Enemy it's a place where you can rest be at peace where there is no Strife assured dwelling place means it's secure you can be confident all the resources that you would have need of that's the place where it's provided so there is no Strife there is striving and for it to be a quiet resting place there's no there's this sense of ease even when you have to labor such that it's not just a place of Labor where you're working and doing laundry and cleaning and looking after the kids but it's a place where you can rest and there's no tension there's the tension is released we want to have Peaceable habitation sure dwellings and quiet resting places that's what we would want our church to be that's how we would want our spirits to be our spirits to find and that's how we want our homes to be remember how that brother bradam said home is not the house it's the order of the house so it's not the house but it's the order that makes it a home it's the character on the inside that makes a home so you could have a house but if you don't have the right character if you don't have the right order the right Arrangement it is a house and you can be housed but you can still be homeless because he said the home is a order of the house it's I had some share different articles with me how that uh when I ministered this on Sunday day and it I wasn't really conscious of it but the Supreme Court is taking up issues related to homelessness and there's a lot of article and opinion pieces so people were sharing different things to me and the New York Times actually had kind of put at the very top of their uh publication on Sunday uh it was an opinion piece from February when I tracked it down it was called a life without a home was the the the whole piece and they had these different opinions and articles contained in this where it says a tent is not a home and couch is not a home or a a car is not a home a motel is not a home and it would say a mo a home is not a motel or a car is not a motel and it like a fill-in the blank and they repeated it over and over again and they mentioned how that in in 2007 they begin to actually keep record of the number of homeless people in the United States and this past year uh there they re revealed the LA latest count that they did revealed the highest number of unhoused people in the history since they've been counting it and they estimate that 3 point of of this record number so focus with me here I may be a little nervous and and knew at this so I may be a little Shifty but you're a veteran so stick with me but an estimated 3.7 million Americans live at someone else's house and they call it couch surfing or doubling up and and I realize even for some of you some of these things are very real we're not just talking about statistics you read about you've lived this and so what doubling up is it's not your house you're living in someone else's house now again I'm wanting to run this parallel of this Dynamic that makes a house a home and that just because we have a house that we call our own maybe we don't have a place that we can call home right and that can go with churches and that can go with our own families and it is called homelessness hidden in plain sight so there's people who are not staying in their own place they're sleeping on someone's couch they're living in someone's house they're doubled up with someone else and either the uh Department of Housing and Urban Development doesn't even count these that are doubled up in their homelessness count they don't even consider them as unhoused they just say Well they're living with somebody they're living somewhere so don't we don't include them in our statistic they're saying there's over 3.7 million that are living in someone else's house doubling up or couch surfing and this New York Times article said it this way it all conjures a Rosy scenario in which someone takes in friends or family members Who Fallen on Hard Times offering them Comfort safety and a roof over their heads now that's the idea right Comfort safety but in reality doubling up is a much more complicated under the radar form of H homelessness not Holiness homelessness I hope you're able to still stay connected to the spiritual principles of even yourself individually our churches and especially that that life we live as a family in our houses that doubling up is a much more complicated under the radar form of homelessness it may be a temporary solution a precursor to living in a shelter or on the street or part of a cycle of housing instability that involves crowded living conditions and a devastating lack of privacy and safety so it's just kind of this veneer for a moment for a season for a time oh you're living with something but it could just be a temporary solution where it's just a precursor to being in a homeless shelter or living on the street or part of this crisis of instability that are are scenarios where it's a devastating lack of privacy and safety so I would say that these who are doubling up who are couch surfing living out of cars or in motels in these different places they're housed but homeless they may have the physical shelter or as it that things says a roof over their heads but they don't have much of anything else that home should be now again think of your family your family life or quote unquote your home life and think of an experience at church and I want you now to begin to think of this idea of being housed in church but you're really couch surfing and if anyone's thinking is he trying to run us off like is this not home come on but I'm wanting you to think about it even if it's a way to understand maybe your prior experience or understand what someone else is going through or constantly checking up with yourselves to make sure you're not surfing on somebody else's couch here right you find hey I want to be in the will of God I don't want to just be doubling up because now listen to these EXP experiences that they elicited from these people who were living with friends and family and doubling up and they didn't have a place they could call home even though they had a roof over their head now as we run that parallel that analogy from this past Sunday think of it in these terms I'm going to read from uh five different people that are yeah five different people who've had this experience and may just be four here says this is one's experience in living with somebody we've got to be quiet we can't talk loud brother John if you want to just as soon as you hear that key you could pop this up I realize I have that I forgot all about the slide we can't have fun we can't do nothing it's like living in jail we got to be sneaky because of the neighbors they're really set in their ways and they ain't trying to have nobody that stay over there that don't live there so this is a we have to be quiet we can't talk loud we can't have fun it's no fun we can't do anything it's like living in jail another person in their expenses about this individual who offered them a place to stay it was a woman with her child he makes me feel like we're welcome to stay in his house but it's a little uncomfortable because now that I'm staying there our relationship I want you to think spiritual about this our relationship went from a friendship about about work to some odd feeling like he likes me or wants to date me but we have nowhere else to go I notice how being in a place you don't belong that you can't call your own Le LS itself to awkward relationships with others or even to the one who owns the house that makes you feel awkward because they keep telling you there that he's your spiritual husband and you got to listen to him and then another one said it this way it can cause a strain on even the best friendships as much as it's nice that people will do that it's a burden for them to take up that extra space I I just look at these phrases that we've kind of collected here on the screen another person said living with my sister feels terrible and everybody said no living with my sister feels terrible it's very tense so here's one it's family and and this is maybe a sister that they love and a sister that loves them enough to say hey you're in bad times come live with me but they're doubled up again think very deeply about this it's obviously a situation where there's a power Dynamic that that is out of balance because one has more resources or it's their house their name's on the deed they're paying the mortgage and so there's not the shared responsibility they're not in it together they're not partnered you're at a disadvantage you go and move in with your sister and you're living with your sister cuz you've fallen on Hard Times you can't pay your own bills and now that you begin to live with them even though this is a person you love it feels terrible and it's very tense amen now let's just take these words and I I thought I'd changed it to just jail but I maybe I didn't update it living in jail an odd feeling a strain terrible tense uncomfortable does that describe home now it may describe your house hopefully not but that's not what home should be home should never be terrible home should never be tense or a jail it should never be an odd feeling or uncomfortable that's not the way that home should be in Proverbs chap 21:9 it says it's better to dwell in a corner of the Housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house other words you'd be better off couch surfing you'd be better off renting out the corner of a housetop than living with a brawling woman in a wide house now this isn't I'm not just picking on women that are Brawlers uh but I would say that any situation where there's brawling going on in the house you'd be better off in the corner of a rooftop than having a really nice house and a bunch of brawling taking place therein I know it may seem to be calling out the women in this in verse 19 it's better to dwell in the wilderness this is some tough stuff it's better to dwell in the wilderness than with A continuous and an angry woman I didn't want too loud of an amen there said it's better to be homeless or if I could say better to be houseless than to live with a contentious and angry woman because if you live with a brawling woman if you live with a contentious and angry woman let me just phrase it this way a brawling man a contentious and angry spouse a selfish and angry children if everyone is emotionally um upset and these words speak of strife and contention and this judging and even speaks of being vexed or frustrated there's this tenseness if anything I think these words could describe a jail so you say you're better living in the wilderness than in the jail of that house you'd be better living in the corner of a hous toop than living in that terrible condition that you're living in now and it speaks to the idea that the the atmosphere in the place that you live is going to determine whether or not it's really worth living there and these people in their experiences they they have a place that they can lay their head they may have a place where they can keep some of their limited possessions but they can't they can't live as want to they got to be quiet they can't be loud they can't have fun it's like living in jail it's uncomfortable friendship that we once had is now changed where it's this odd Dynamic and there's pressure there because there's a disparity in relationship and it becomes a strain even in the best of friendships and and it feels terrible and it's very tense what this is it's it's it'd be better to live in a different situation than even to live in that situation I know maybe that's those are difficult words to say but if the Bible's going to say you'd be better in the corner of a housetop than the live in a contentious terrible uncomfortable striving tense situation then it speaks that we ought to have a different kind of atmosphere where we live and they go on to note in this article a life without a home in this opinion piece that contains several different um articles that are written by different authors and expresses the Vantage points of different people who are unhoused it talks about how beyond the day-to-day challenges for themselves whether it's trying to to get a job or uh uh or you know shower in these different things and these different conditions and the challenges of the living conditions it they they identify how this kind of situation impacts children in Greater ways than it does the Adults now again think of church and think of home and one person said of their children they're behaving poorly in school my oldest is always worried about me and has a hard time focusing the kids seem depressed more now now I realized the the tendency would be to think yeah if I was living out of a car if I was living with a a sister and it feels terrible and it's tense and and you look at those different circumstances it's easy for us just to become a spectator and just learning maybe this of another person's experience it's just anecdotal but now just think of ourselves as I'm trying to present a scenario where we have not made our houses homes and even though we have a roof over our heads the interactions among family members creates an environment that produces the same type of behaviors in children because they don't feel comfortable in the place that they're living as they ought to and that could be the same even in churches we don't think sometimes just how negatively children could be impacted in churches just by the atmosphere and the spirit in a church and I realize sometimes we people will um assess whether or not they want to attend a church by what it can do for their children and they're looking in a very shallow way by whether or not there's a bunch of kids there or a youth group or and things like that instead of considering overall what's the character of the church and what kind of impact will that have on my children do I want them to become what that church is turning out right just I'm just giving some practical things tonight in another place this person writes of their daughter I know it affects her she tries to hide it she's a child I want her to be a child I don't want her to worry about why mommy's up set these are adult concerns those are things that she shouldn't have to wor have on her mind I wish she didn't have to experience any of that problems it if you're just housed are you following me if we're just housed there's something missing that we all need when we're just housed when we're homeless in our own houses when we're homeless in our churches there is a deficit spiritually there is a damage that we as adults are incurring and we're living through the strain of it and wrestling with things that are taught or way things are done and we experience it as family and we try to maybe hide it from the children and listen we don't really do a good job of it but yet we try to protect them in some ways but yet even without them knowing completely what's going on in the church politics and the fact that we don't have a home church we just have a church house they feel it and experience it too I'm going to go ahead and read this one it's lengthy and I I think it might just be the phrase that they use at the very end so my only goal is making making sure my kids stay happy so they don't think about the situation we're in every time they start doubting or they get weary I just say this is just going to make us stronger it's going to bring us closer together you could tell your kids about this so they could say my mom she did not give up she did not give up she kept fighting I think that's that's admirable and it's say because this is this is a person who's thinking about the future and wants to overcome this and even recognize this isn't ideal and I got to keep fighting I want to go on she says my kids are the reason why I'm not in a crazy house right now and I just thought what a unique phrasing cuz in some way she is in a crazy house but she's saying the far far worse is if I didn't have my children if I wasn't looking out after my children I would have gone insane she says I probably should have been years ago as as I read these experiences whether it be on that first part as we dealt with the house but homeless and now the challenges to children in the family it shows us how that just providing mere housing especially where we're doubled up especially where we're couch surfing or in these different uh Dynamics where we don't have some sense of ownership or belonging it leads to those Force relationships we're just by virtue of this proximity to this individual and this frequency of interaction that well there's some Duty or obligation you owe to them or yet they feel that they have some power over you and whenever you're in a scenario where it's someone else's house and you don't feel you're at home it's going to lead to that codependent dependency and codependency gives rise to all sorts of negative Dynamics think of how that it might be that if you're going to be homeless and if you don't have if you you're going to be houseless and so without this place to go you don't have a place to live and how that could be like I'm completely dependent upon you I'm at your mercy and that can lead to abuse and manipulation and control and a lot of negative Dynamics upon that individual because they don't have any ownership they don't have any say they don't have there's no sense of belonging this is out of necessity and God forbid that we would ever be in a place where well there's just nowhere else to go to church so I just guess I got to be a prisoner or there's just nowhere else I can go that lends itself to very negative Dynamics home needs to be a place of Love needs to be a place of Grace and forgiveness I'll read quotes that substantiate this in a moment and this is what this is what was in my heart on Sunday and I'll say it here and I think it in my mind I want to just maybe develop it more in just a a sermon in itself but if it's just housing if you're just couch surfing you can always find another couch if just a motel you can always find another one with the different rates if it's just a car you can always move that car around you maybe you could change cars there's a lot of different ways of looking at this but my point would be this if it's just housing you always have the option to change if it's just doubling up you always have the option of moving out whenever things get uncomfortable whenever things get terrible whenever things are are just not the way that you want them to be when things get tough you don't have to bind closer together when things get hard you don't have to work through through things and you don't you don't have to compromise and find a way to keep the harmony keep things together are you following me that if it's just a house you don't have any there's nothing you don't have anything to it and those who are running just a house don't have that sense of community where they're cultivating it it's just well if you don't like it leave right when it's just a house there's no sense of well how can we keep the family together how can we make this work and and how can we see that every everyone's needs are taken care of whether it be the individual whether it be the father the father who just wants to have a house and it's his house it's like it's my way or the highway soon as you don't do things the way I like it around here that's the day you need to leave and you know what that that's a lot of posturing may be true but man if you ever get to that you've kind of lost you've lost things things you've got to that point where brother bam says a pastor can fire the whole board if he wants to and start over right amen if he wants that's the only time I've ever had to say it can you guys say Amen come on where are you let me hear it can the Deacon say right he says he can fire the the whole board deacons trustees and start over he once he goes I hope it never has to come to that right and if the nuclear option is the one you mentioned every time someone just seems to disagree you want me to kick you out the church huh you want me to bring you before the board huh you want me kick you out it's if that's what you always go to you've created a nasty environment right you've created this hostile work environment you've created this housing this doubling up this couch surfing it's just a car it's just a motel it's just a tent it's not really what should be a home because when things get tough It's hit the road you're either told to hit the road or you hit the road yourself and a lot of people have left housing because at the end of the day the right kind of atmosphere was never cultivated within the home or the church to where they felt that they could be heard they could that problems could be addressed or that there was this character of Christ in their midst to where no matter how hurt and wounded or how sinful they had been that they could come to the right place again and receive healing I I hope that that image is you can kind of grasp that idea that when it's just a house there's no loyalty to the house again it's not house sweet house it's not home is where the house is but it's it's a different different connotation so let me say this as I'm trying to wind this sermon down we don't have a housing crisis we have a home crisis brother brandom said the American home today is uncertain that's right and if I could say this I think if for doing an autopsy on it a postmortem or whatever we might call it or hot washing if we were to examine it and look at it the home crisis is what has led to this housing crisis there's there's things aren't happening in the house that used to happen that put people in a position to succeed when they leave the house or provide the resources they would need when life gets difficult we've become completely untethered from what home life used to be and homes should be providing more than just food and shelters Luke 12:23 says the life is more than meat and the body is more than rainment some have taken the idea of family or Parenthood to be that I want to provide them with a house I want to provide them with food and clothing I want to make sure they get their education maybe postsecondary education and different things I want to make sure they get all that and then they're on their own and we just let them loose and I've done my job and there's no real cultivating of relationships there's no sense of moral responsibility if anything anymore there's actually talk about we won't even identify their gender till they want to identify it we don't want to impose anything on them until they got to make their decision and Parenthood is getting to the place where it's completely hands off so the concept of traditional Parenthood is completely broken and brother B says you break Parenthood you break the nation and the reason why we have the insanity the reason why and this is me saying this the reason why that we have such a unhoused population and such a crisis when it comes to housing it comes back to character comes back to vision and responsibility where at some point even as Americans we got away from the right kind of ideals where you just didn't have this problem as even reading in this article I think it ends on this note that in in Nashville they kicked out a um a bunch of homeless people from this encampment and then built and then we're going to build new houses there for homeless people to live in and so when it was all said and done they put 191 people in houses and caused another 397 to no longer have a place to live it's like this is a this is something where you can't do something to help somebody without hurting somebody else if you raise their tents if you mow down their uh their their their shelters and you take whatever they their shanties they've set up and just plow them down where are they going to go what are they going to do it it is a crisis and it's not one that we as a church can solve it's not ones that we we're not the policy writers we're not the ones that have to figure it out but we can say this if there's if we look at an in sense of at the end of the day it comes down to this lack of vision and purpose what can I be doing in my own house to maybe even ensure against literal insanity and homelessness I this is I recommend this Ser sermon as being one maybe for you to go and listen to lifting him up out of History it's a lengthy statement I'm going to read through this and then I have um three more quotations to share with you as well of our as well as our text I think we're doing good on time if this quote takes me too long we can just pick up on at a later time and finish these notes but brother bam says and lifting him up out of History we have a home life crisis and I want say not a housing crisis a home life crisis it seems like the home life is running out into shallow water it used to be in a home listen to these things these are the things that make a house a home and provided the kind of nurturing environment that children and families needed in order to keep things together and godly it used to be in a home that a father the head of the house would sit down in the morning and would speak with his family and they would all take out the old Family Bible and read just a little bit and all gather around the table and have prayer you don't see that no more now families may be such to where you don't have the the the father and the son going out to the field and the daughters are all in the home and maybe you don't have the same traditional families and Lifestyles and different times of going to work and those things but the idea is that there was something common they're gathering around that had some spiritual benefit or purpose to it says you don't see that anymore so not just just in the literal application of it being in the morning but in that idea that the family is serving a higher purpose and when the day was done and Ma had the dishes washed they'd all Gather in and read some more of the Bible and pray before going to bed when he says they don't do that anymore he's meaning families don't pray together and they don't read their Bibles together and another thing they do don't do is eat meals together he said juvenile delinquency certainly was hard thing to find in them days when families ate together prayed together read the Bible together the boys all went to the fields to work and the girls helped mom with the washing down at the creek and I mean I guess we're glad that doesn't happen right but but today we just push a little button the dishes are all done and Ma's in the car and gone to the card party or out she's rattling around the streets and the work's done by a tractor so he's saying as we have evolved in our technology and certain jobs have become easier to do and the Father and Son aren't out plowing in field all day close by and the mom and the daughter aren't washing clothes in a creek and cooking meals in the house he says we just don't have nothing but a bunch of lazy idle people this is these are this is the prophet diagnos in the condition of America and home life is broken now as we're trying to use this example of home life for church life and our own individual lives this has specific application to our lives now specific to our family lives but there's also this parallel in churches right when you could just push a button home life is so neglected till the Bible is laid back till they have to hunt for an hour to find one in many homes in America this is a true story I was in a pastor's home who was telling me there's a lot of things that scriptures that haven't been fulfilled that we should be looking to be fulfilled and this is a pastor's home and and and I was just likeoh like what I'd love to hear it he's like well brother Aaron I can't find a Bible in I'm like I'm in your house can't find a Bible Well little did I know he was trying to build a case to leave the message he says they go to church on Sunday and how convenient it was he couldn't find a Bible for me he says they go to church on Sunday morning for the religion for about 20 minutes since the pastor takes about 30 minutes he's called on the board what is it home life is running out notice the connection he's now making home life is running out so Church Life is running out it used to be that father and mother loved and honored and cherished one another now this is where we're coming to the ideas of home we read home sweet home and uh the the home of the heart and these different poems that I read in the beginning it wasn't just so that I could scratch my poetry itch it was read so that we could see that the caress of a sister the welcoming of a mother the father's care and all these things have something to do with what home what makes a house a home and when we begin to lose those kind of relationships and connections father to son and daughter mother to children father husband and wife together then a family though they may be housed together ohow they may just as well be in a homeless shelter they may just as well be doubling up with each other couch surfing in your own house because it used to be that father and mother loved and honored and cherished one another and when she was old and gray and wrinkled up and her poor little old face was all Dro up in her glasses hanging down over her nose pop loved her just as well as he did when she was young and pretty this is really interesting but today I don't mean to be critical when she gets a little old he just swaps her for a new model seems to be that way like swapping cars or something so he says seems like that real family love doesn't exist much more just Something's Happened home life is running out he keeps saying it home life is running out home life is running out home life is running out he'll say it again we don't have the old American home as we used to have it long years ago uh maybe Sunday I'll get into some of the specifics of how home life has changed and and just how that's transpired maybe as a way to help us he said there's another thing I'd like to say another thing is running out is friendship is running out thought it was remarkable that even brother Lucas in his prayer talked about being better fathers and friends and and these things friendship is running out running out it doesn't seem like we have the friends that we used to have and the friends that we have are not loyal friends like they used to be that reminds me of the prayer request I forgot to write down brother loyal is preaching back back in his hometown of Minnesota where he grew up uh where he used to live I don't know if it's home or what it is but he still conss himself to be living here he's just unhoused if you guys didn't know that he lost his apartment was moving Apartments I hope it's okay to say this and one lease was expiring and he had signed a lease on a new place and two weeks before he was to move into his new place the apartment called him and said ah we're canceling the lease because he had too good of a deal so he became unhoused and so being unhoused he was like you know what my I know where my heart is I know where home is just because I don't have a house doesn't mean I don't have a home and he got a new job cuz his job offered him Severance and he got a new job and he's been traveling a lot more and he took it as an opportunity to go back and visit family and do a little bit of traveling and when we talked about I said just be sure you know you're in the will of the Lord just make sure I don't have I can't give you an opinion on it you're a young man this is an opportunity you need to find whether not the will of the Lord and so he's been do traveling a lot with work and he was going to be home this week but he was asked to minister so let's pray for him because loyal is ministering he's a loyal friend and he'll be ministering this Sunday so that was my other prayer request it made it into the middle of the sermon friends that we have are not loyal friends like they used to be they just leave town for months at a time but when you think about what makes friends is all we have to do is friend request somebody and if they accept it oh we're friends wow follow me back right and that's how we're connected I get these emails from LinkedIn do you want to connect with and read those because this is an unprovoked prompt right you haven't expressed any interest in Lucas Rubik as a developer but yet they're asking whether or not you want to connect with him on LinkedIn you're like oh did he did he seek me out no they're just trying to get you to connect with somebody and so things are so superficial the friendships that we have it used to be I can remember when someone got sick in the neighborhood that everybody come around and they helped them with all their work and lended a hand to anything could be done set them up with all night set up with them all night at times and I've often said it's the truth that we can hardly know the neighbors dead until we see it in the paper he says friendship you following how much things have changed and we may have neighbors but it's not what a neighbor used to be we might have neighborhoods but it's not like used to be we might have houses but they're not homes Papa has a key to the house and mama has a key and they're both out and gone half the night the children they don't know where they are and the little ones are with the babysitter and that's the way life is lived you have to recognize how he's talking about families pulled apart into their own different directions they have their own Visions their own goals the own thing own things that they like to do do you know the Bible predicted all these things so what is it then it's that we're standing in a position watching these things run out he said let's take Church life this is where it all begins Church Life is running out the people just take the church today almost for an idol like a totem pole go set in church five minutes and I've done my religion pay your little contribution whatever it is to pay the pastor and they don't make that up if they don't make that up they make a little supper and make it up to the pastor and if he ain't satisfied he hauls off to somewhere that'll get him a better wage no commitment listen when you're just housed there's no responsibility if things go sideways you just leave when you're just when you're just uh just housed or couch surfing there's no accountability and here it's just this Dynamic to see the pastor is not divinely called anymore just seems like he begins to be a mil ticket to the pastor that the people wherever offers him the most money there he goes it shouldn't be that way it shouldn't be that a man was called of God to a community now we have defined that to mean that if God calls a man to a state he's the pastor of the whole state or the city but Community speaks of a different type of relationship than just proximity or just a zip code or you know the pastor of Maricopa or Phoenix but he calls a man of God to a community to cultivate the sense of community to have a responsibility to that community and oversight over him and not just be like oh I don't like this Arrangement and just leave and if he had to lay there like Elijah did on top of a mountain at the brook cherith and expect the crows to feed him he ought to stay in his Divine calling till his Divine mission is fulfilled no matter if he gets a penny or not it should be the call of God first but it seemingly it's changed to the call of money or bigger position something on that order think of that just in home life how much how quickly we abandoned we abandoned places for a better job better position he said something on that order or to become a more popular person in a bigger church or something like that and then the church they have let down they begin to run out he said just watch it unfold there's a lot in that I had to go through it maybe quick more quickly than I had anticipated but as he de details home Life Church Life and in these sermons of Uncertain sound and and even this lifting them up out of History goes through this quite a bit on how there's home life is uncertain Church Life is uncertain National Life is uncertain life itself is uncertain politics is uncertain and he goes through that he's talking about how relationships are different now the relationships of mother husband and wife are different then the relationship of the father and mother to Children is different and there's a lot of independency and what they say and what they do and what their responsibilities are and he even describes in church life where there's no accountability and people just leave and come and go and do whatever they want he saying these these are things running out why because we have a home life crisis not a housing crisis in the message in uncertain sound he says home life is uncertain we've never had a time when we had so many divorces in peace time as we got now what's remarkable is to find that the number of divorces is either has leveled off or even is getting smaller but what we find is more people are just cohabitating and not marrying so sometimes when you dig into the data it's not it's not a a Rosy scenario it's that this idea of home is completely broken home life is uncertain our home life is broke up years ago it used to be that mother and dad were at home at night if it wasn't for church or something and they never let their children roll in the streets and run around all night long or the worldwide web or the internet Highway you know just there's a way that we could be roaming and it it can be virtual right just put the virtual headset we're on the we're and so he says and now days it seems to be kind of a popular opinion oh how you just go to the modern house today look at what it is Papa he has to hurry down to the pool room the boys are playing pool or they're bowling or something him and Ma sisters at the Canen I just love every we using phrases the kids are like Mom what's a canteen what's bowling what's the pool room is that an indoor pool that's what we and so there's a Junior's got a hot rod uh sister's had a canteen or some rock and roll party Junior's got the hot rod out seeing how he can run run down and that's about home life now just put in here now all the different things that we do in our afternoons or evenings or even on our Saturdays our daily lives where everyone's off doing their own thing it's not a home anymore it's a house that's what he's identifying even if we're not running off in the pool room H H as as men or out bowling as boys or at the canteen as girls or got a hot rod or these things it's something about the home life is missing we're not together anymore our relationships are aren't as strong and connected as they used to be he said and the Bible oh it's a great book but it's put in the drawer somewhere until the pastor comes in and we just don't have the home life we used to have home life is so uncertain this is statement after statement after statement I could share with you actually was going through a number of them today and just kind of piecing them out uh just so that it wasn't just being overloaded and you'll find sometimes a brother R is emphasizing a little bit different angle and so there's some other principles I'd like to explore in this subject so there's going to be more statements we'll share with you we talking about we we have a crisis in the home and home life crisis and in each one of these scenarios I would describe it this way because there's no home life it's homeless they're housed but homeless whether it be the home he described or the church he described they're housed but homeless and it's a crisis a crisis in which he describes the loss of love the loss of support the loss of togetherness there's that loss of support of for one another even in a community there's this not looking out after one another there's a there's just so many different ideas brother Bram talks about Dr Spock and he talks about all these ideas that just flood people's minds and a lot of psychology and how to raise families and how to how to conduct ourselves and we've gotten away from the real principles of the word of God and responsibilities and accountabil to one another and he's saying the home is gone and because the home is gone the house is no longer the shelter that it should have be yeah it's a roof over the head but where's the Comfort where's the belonging now it's become a jail now there's tension now there's H there it's it lacks all the things that home should have and it gets to where now home's not even a place worth fighting for because after all it's just a house and you can always get one of those you can always move out you can always separate you can always change churches it's not a place worth fighting for and I I I want to close with this and and and this is what I'm going to say until I close we can pray for and believe that God will heal these things that if you have a house but not a home we can pray for God to heal it because homelessness is the result of some conditions uh maybe uh some some sickness some breach some harm H and something's lacking to where you don't have home and so as I look out on the congregation I would say that all of us except for maybe loyal we have a house we have a place that we live we have a place that we have can have on our driver's license that's the per that's our permanent place of residence but if we we have if we don't have that I believe God can provide it 100% I have no doubt that God can provide shelter for those who don't have it but let me say this if your living situation your house whether it be your church or whether it be the place that you live as together as a family or even if it's by yourself if it doesn't feel like home whatever has taken home away from it God can heal it brother brandham is in prayer and he's praying at the end of a sermon I just thought it was so beautiful he said if it's domestic trouble straighten up the home Lord Give Peace where there's trouble there's a loss of peace and comfort and stability where there's trouble we can't say that we live in a Peaceable habitation and ass sure dwelling or a quiet resting place where there's trouble we can pray for God to straighten up the home and give peace Amen in 2 Chronicles 5: 13 and 14 there an hour ago that we had read this so if the kind of the the language has been lost in this just notice how beautifully this fits it came to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one trumpeters don't use their voice they use their breath they use an instrument the singer is vocalizing hears two different offices two different callings two different sounds but somehow some way they come one to make one sound and to not make one sound in praising and thanking God for an excellent draft pick by the Arizona Cardinals but they come to one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music so now it's not just the trumpets and the singers but it's all instruments and all symbols and all these together now though they have different callings and different offices and different gifts and different talents they're working together supporting one another making beautiful music as one as one voice and praise the Lord and they say the same thing for he is good for his mercy endureth forever and as this Oneness had come into this Gathering of the trumpeters and singers and all instruments of music and symbols and all the voices come together with the same praise and thanking the lord and the same thing he's good and his mercy endureth forever that then the house was filled with the cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God and it's then that God made it home when it was in its place when there was Unity when he was being lifted up when they are of the same mind in the same objective even though they have different callings and different jobs and different roles as I've said before uh uh you know our wives don't have the same jobs that we do as husbands and husbands don't have the same jobs as our wives and thank God right just leave it at that there's no need to say well you don't do what I do good thing right and it's good that you're not doing their job so we realized through all the differences and different desires that when family life is broke up in Harmony and Oneness and common objective and goals get broke up that's when we provide a basis for disharmony disunity that's it goes back to A House Divided but this describes such a beautiful scenery in the house of the Lord that that's when God came he's like now that's where I dwell and that's what makes it home that's what made the structure of the temple remember how we talked about when the the tent walls were erected and as soon as that last piece came into place the presence of God came now here in the temple there's this point where all are lifting up things together and the presence of the Lord comes it speaks to this this concept and this idea that we can uh we can refer to in the world as home having a home and home sweet home and oh there's no place like home oh there's no place like home well this is this spiritual sense We should strive for this feeling in our houses I guess I'm realizing now that maybe it's a different set of notes where I have some statements uh that I thought maybe we had this evening maybe it's for Sunday I'm I'm just doing my best as a Christian and as a pastor to apply myself to the word of God for your benefit and so your feedback your testimony your prayers your testimony it's all it's all encouraging me to know whether or not we're meeting your needs because that's what's most important this I I'll say this I am not a professor and you're my students and so I have a curriculum and you need to learn it and make a good grade it's the opposite function where you're the ones that uh uh have something God wants to say to you and I just want to be his mouthpiece and so you're going to get what you need not what I want you to learn by God's grace so hold me accountable to that but do your part in prayer and communication so here here's a statement I think I might have this one Jehovah JRA do I have that one brother John let's follow this I want to close with two more statements but as I've said that though we could be housed but homeless whatever has made us homeless God can heal it and brother brandom and and I want to bring this back to that uh these comments that we were making in bringing how that children were behaving poorly and they seemed depressed and tense and Ang uh anxious and those things brother Braham said here's another thing and he's in discernment and I wanted to use this other part before that was real powerful he goes remember your life couldn't hide now you're having trouble at home a domestic trouble that's right it's your husband and you're praying for him because he's unsaved and then he says sir I would be saved and give my heart to Christ Jesus so it it it it reads as and it sounds as if the husband could be there and here's this woman who has trouble at home domestic trouble the husband's not saved and now notice how remarkable this statement is I would be saved to give my heart to Christ Jesus so these children could be well straighten up your home and make it right that tension will always be at the children that's just so moving that where husband and wife are not in harmony the children no matter how much you can fake it the children will fill it why because you have a house form not a home it's a broken home we even use the phrase oh they come from a broken home they are raised in a broken home and a lot of times we use it to describe children who are raised in single parent households why because what home should be's been broken he says you should get your heart right so these children can be well straighten up your home and make it right the tension will always be at the children and I say this I express this to the families who are streaming at home I express this to those of us who are here and this great burden that we have for those all of us together as a family and as we're raising children this lay to Sea and darkness that we have got to be providing the right kind of atmosphere at home we must have a vision for our families we've got to be intentional we've got to be deliberate with the way that we're living because the tension in the father in the mother in the home will rob a child of the home life and the tension will always be at the children and then notice this next phrase do you believe that if I pray for the children you can accept the healing of the children that powerful do you believe that if I can pray for the children you can accept the healing of the children that that that speaks to me it gives me confidence to believe that if the the the atmosphere that the house hasn't been right and the children have been damaged and harmed by it that we can pray and God can heal it because he says and I'll pray that your husband this night will become God's servant so that your troubles will be ended I believe that no matter what our home lives have been like to this point no matter what our church experiences have been like even if it's failures and shortcomings in this church here I believe that God could heal right now the Sheep God can mend God can make better God can make God could cause us as as whether it be Pastor as husbands and and fathers to come greater to our position come closer to our calling be more serious about the things that God has called us to be a and accept that our failures have caused the tensions in the children and pray that God would heal our children could we just bow our heads in a word of prayer as you remain seated maybe just to think about these things brother brandom in another sermon the seven compound names of Jehovah he says heart trouble nothing's hard for God is it he's just doing discernment one after another he just heals all kinds of diseases he says God bless you just go on your road rejoicing being happy he said you have the same thing so just keep going God's made you well and he will make every person well in this building right now if you'll believe it will you believe it and he says this he tells him to stand to your feet just a minute he says God is our refuge and strength very present help in the time of trouble brother Ram talks about trouble at home domestic trouble uses that phrase often or a few times at least and he said God is our refuge and strength the very present help in the time of trouble and he says the crisis is on let me say the home life crisis is on he said the battle is on would you agree with me even our young couples I look at some I think about some of the young newly married couples they know the battle is on they know there's a a battle for home life there's a battle for PR uh preeminence there's a battle for the right things the crisis is on it's not a housing crisis it's a home crisis he says the crisis is on the battle is on he says raise up your hands and touch the lifeline now and move home with it Hallelujah in Jesus Christ's name may you receive it that's what I express to you tonight if you could even in your own Hearts Reach Out touch the lifeline get a hold of God he says move home with it oh Hallelujah if I could say it this way way you don't have to change your address you don't have to pack up a Pinsky you don't have to go across the country but you can say tonight I'm moving back home I'm going back home I'm going to move home tonight I'm going to take a hold of the word of God in the presence of Christ and I'm going to move home with it I'm going back to the same old house I'm going back to the same old apartment I'm get going back to the same old condo I'm going back to the same old hotel but now I'm going home cuz I'm going with a purpose in my heart to live differently to give Christ the preeminence to gather around the right things because the uncertainty and the Brokenness that crept into the home was de directly reflective of Christ being pushed out and as families differed over Sports and politics and food and education and fashion and all sorts of things they lost commonality with one another and they no longer fellowshipped as friends and there was not the togetherness in a family and Things become toxic and all the the
