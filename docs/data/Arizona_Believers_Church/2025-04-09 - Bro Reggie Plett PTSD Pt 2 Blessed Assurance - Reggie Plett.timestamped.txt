[0:00] Psalms
[0:03] 56:es
[0:05] 1-4. Be merciful unto me, oh God, for
[0:10] man would swallow me up. He fighting
[0:13] daily oppresseth me. Mine enemies would
[0:16] daily swallow me up. For they be many
[0:20] that fight against me, oh thou most
[0:23] high. What time I am afraid, I will
[0:27] trust in thee. In God I will praise his
[0:31] word. In God I have put my trust. I will
[0:36] not fear what flesh can do unto me.
[0:39] Amen. May God add his blessing to his
[0:41] word. You can be
[0:48] seated. I'd like to also read over in
[0:53] Psalms 61 verses 1-4.
[0:59] And just kind of take note
[1:01] of a few things here that David is
[1:05] saying. He says, "Hear my cry, oh God.
[1:09] Attend unto my
[1:11] prayer. From the end of the earth will I
[1:14] cry unto thee." You could also read
[1:16] that. From the end of the earth, I will
[1:18] cry unto thee. When my heart is
[1:22] overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is
[1:25] higher than I.
[1:27] For thou hast been a shelter for me, and
[1:31] a strong tower from the
[1:33] enemy. I will abide in thy tabernacle
[1:37] forever. I will
[1:39] trust in the covert of thy wings. Say
[1:43] law. So David is saying, I will cry. I
[1:46] will
[1:47] abide. And I will
[1:50] trust. And I think we can
[1:53] experience all of those things. And I
[1:55] think we do experience that all the
[1:58] time. And I think some of us are saying,
[2:01] I'm in the I will cry portion of that. I
[2:04] know what it is to be in that stage
[2:07] where I'm just crying, crying, crying
[2:09] out to the
[2:10] Lord. And then that abiding, I will
[2:13] abide. And and in that abiding, we find
[2:16] trust to trust
[2:21] him. I didn't think I would ever do
[2:23] this.
[2:27] I'm tonight I'm preaching on PTSD part
[2:32] two. It's called blessed
[2:36] asurances as my subtitle. Last time I
[2:40] spoke on PTSD and I called it part one.
[2:43] What is wrong with
[2:45] me? And I was kind of I was really just
[2:48] joking as far as it being a part one. I
[2:50] never never ever thought that there
[2:52] would be another part to it.
[2:54] Um, even though brother Lucas gave me, I
[2:56] think four parts that I could could go
[2:59] with, but
[3:03] um, but PTSD stands for post-traumatic
[3:06] stress disorder. And I'll just kind of
[3:08] recap a little
[3:09] bit. and that post-traumatic stress
[3:12] disorder. The National Institute of
[3:14] Mental Health says that that
[3:17] that this disorder is
[3:21] from is is after a traumat traumatic
[3:24] experience and it can be it's it's a
[3:27] great fear that can be brought on by
[3:29] many many different things. Um but in
[3:32] some some sort of a a trauma that would
[3:35] happen in somebody's life and we see it
[3:39] a lot in soldiers um men that have
[3:42] coming back and have seen and
[3:44] experienced horrible things but there's
[3:47] so many people that have never never
[3:49] been a soldier and have experienced this
[3:52] disorder and last time I was only
[3:55] wanting really to what had struck me was
[3:58] how many times
[4:00] s throughout brother Brandham's sermons
[4:03] and and and and going throughout healing
[4:06] campaigns and and at the end of the
[4:08] service through a prayer line, you would
[4:10] hear the discerning going on. And
[4:13] brother Brandon would bring people
[4:14] through the prayer line and he would
[4:15] begin discerning and and and talking
[4:18] about the nervousness
[4:21] that people were
[4:22] experiencing. and he would say you
[4:24] you're nervous and or or you've got a
[4:26] heart problem or you've got a stomach
[4:27] problem, but really it stems from your
[4:29] nervousness. It's this nervousness that
[4:32] happens to you and and so many different
[4:34] instances like that happening and and I
[4:37] was I titled it PTSD and and and it that
[4:41] post-traumatic stress disorder. I said,
[4:43] "Let's not focus on the disorder, but
[4:46] instead that D be
[4:48] deliverance." that there is deliverance
[4:51] for this post traumatic stress that
[4:55] somebody might have, for any sort of a
[4:58] nervousness or or trauma that somebody
[5:01] might have in their life, God has got
[5:04] deliverance for that.
[5:07] And when you begin to listen to those to
[5:10] that discerning and and you begin to
[5:12] listen to those prayer
[5:14] lines, you're you're you you begin
[5:17] entering in and you you you hear about
[5:19] brother Brandham even when he said so
[5:21] many times when he went down into Mexico
[5:24] into old Mexico and and there was that
[5:26] little baby that was raised up from the
[5:27] dead. But before that baby was raised up
[5:29] from the dead, there was an older man
[5:31] who was I believe he was blind. And
[5:34] brother Brandham said he was putting his
[5:36] foot up next to his foot because he
[5:38] didn't even have good shoes. And brother
[5:39] Brandham said, "If my foot would have
[5:40] been the same size, I'd have given him
[5:42] my shoes." He reminded of me of my
[5:44] daddy. And brother said how that just
[5:47] the power of being able to enter in to
[5:49] somebody's
[5:51] hurt and and and and trauma that that
[5:54] that sympathizing or empathizing with
[5:56] somebody
[5:58] uh can can can bring healing. And I'm so
[6:03] grateful that we have this message on
[6:07] tape that we can when we listen to it
[6:09] and we begin to listen to those prayer
[6:11] lines and we begin to heal hear about
[6:12] these healings and you hear it on tape
[6:15] and you can hear people going off off
[6:17] the platform healed and brother Brandham
[6:20] calling it out and saying you know not
[6:21] even somebody on the platform but
[6:23] somebody out in the audience they've
[6:24] been healed and this one and and get up
[6:26] from the stretchers. Those of you that
[6:28] are on stretchers, get up from the
[6:29] stretchers. And those of you in
[6:30] wheelchairs, get up out of your
[6:32] wheelchairs. And you're hearing it and
[6:34] and and something in your heart begins
[6:36] to swell and you think, "Oh, God, if you
[6:39] can do it for them, you can do it for
[6:41] me."
[6:44] And
[6:46] so tonight, as we're we're talking about
[6:49] this PTSD,
[6:51] uh we we know there's that deliverance
[6:53] there, but I'm I'm I'm focusing on the S
[6:55] part. And instead of it being a a
[6:59] stress, I want to focus on the word
[7:03] security. And as we've read in these
[7:08] scriptures that David is crying out to
[7:10] God, God, be merciful to me. That when
[7:12] I'm in trouble, I'll call out to you.
[7:15] And Lord, you've always been my refuge.
[7:17] You've always been my help. You've been
[7:19] a strong tower for me. and that I'll
[7:22] like when I'm in trouble, God, I'm going
[7:24] to cry out to you and and and and and I
[7:27] want to abide in you. I want to dwell in
[7:29] your tabernacle forever. And in that
[7:31] abiding, I trust you,
[7:34] Lord. And
[7:36] it's it's that security that we have in
[7:39] God that that I don't right now I'm in a
[7:44] place of vulnerability. I'm in an
[7:46] uncertain place and I don't know what's
[7:49] going to
[7:49] happen. But in that in that time to
[7:55] know no matter what happens, one thing
[7:58] I'm secure in is God, you've got me.
[8:03] That I I that that there is a security
[8:06] that the believer has in
[8:08] Christ. that come what may, good, bad,
[8:12] or indifferent, that there is a security
[8:14] in knowing that
[8:17] God will not forsake you. He will not
[8:20] leave you, but he's got your best
[8:22] intentions in mind.
[8:29] I had
[8:31] the I don't know pleasure, honor, I
[8:33] don't know what you would call it, but
[8:35] recently I I met this a very famous man
[8:39] named Caesar Milan and um he's known as
[8:44] the dog whisperer and he's I I suppose
[8:47] he's he's a a big celebrity um to the
[8:52] world. He's he trains he trains dogs and
[8:55] I
[8:57] uh through my business of the the
[9:00] artificial grass we have a a canine
[9:03] grass and and we've installed some at
[9:05] his ranch where he lives and I guess he
[9:08] trains his dogs there. And so now Caesar
[9:10] Milan is a a spokesperson with Forever
[9:13] Lawn um promoting K9 grass and and so he
[9:17] I we had a conference and he was there
[9:20] and I and Caesar began to tell his
[9:22] story, began to tell his background and
[9:25] very humble beginnings. Uh Caesar um
[9:29] came AC I think it was from Sinaloa and
[9:31] he came across um he came to America
[9:34] looking for lassie and for
[9:37] rentin and he thought he loved dogs and
[9:40] he trained dogs even down in old Mexico
[9:43] and he just he was he's a dog person. He
[9:46] absolutely loves dogs and he worked with
[9:48] dogs and he trained dogs and and he made
[9:51] his way across the border and he was
[9:53] over in California and he was living
[9:55] under bridges and trying to train
[9:58] people's dogs and and he got famous
[10:00] because he would go
[10:02] to I suppose these were millionaires. I
[10:05] don't know. I suppose everybody in
[10:07] California seems to be
[10:09] millionaires. At least you have to be to
[10:11] live there, I think. But um he would go
[10:14] to these people's houses and say, "Hey,
[10:15] do you have a dog? I'd like to train
[10:17] your dog." And and one
[10:19] day, somebody noticed this this little
[10:23] Mexican man walking down the street with
[10:26] 14 dogs trailing behind him, no leashes
[10:29] on any of them. And all these dogs were
[10:32] walking with him. And they thought,"How
[10:34] is this guy able to walk pitbulls and
[10:38] German shepherds and Chihuahua and
[10:40] poodles all together without them
[10:42] tearing each other apart? They're just
[10:44] following him." So, this is where his
[10:47] claim to fame started to come. And now
[10:49] he's got a I think he's got a TV show
[10:52] and um and he's known as the dog
[10:54] whisperer. and
[10:56] they he says, "You know, people say I'm
[10:58] a I'm a I'm a dog trainer, but I'm not
[11:00] really in the business of training dogs.
[11:03] I'm really in the business of training
[11:05] people."
[11:08] And while he was speaking, he he began
[11:11] to play a video of him visiting a home
[11:15] and and the owner is this big big buff
[11:19] guy and his wife, his little frail wife,
[11:22] and then his daughter. And they've got
[11:25] this pitbull in a in a crate and Caesar
[11:30] comes in. Caesar's I think he's probably
[11:32] about this tall. He comes into the house
[11:34] and he's sitting, you know, probably
[11:37] here to the speaker box from the dog,
[11:40] you know, four or five feet from from
[11:42] this dog in the crate and he says to the
[11:44] owner, you know, let the dog out. And
[11:47] the man's like, I don't think that's a
[11:49] good
[11:50] idea. And Caesar says, why not? And he
[11:53] says, "Man, I'm" He says, "Are you, you
[11:56] know, you afraid for your dog?" And he
[11:57] says, "No, I'm afraid for you. I'm
[11:59] afraid what he's going to do to you."
[12:01] Caesar says, "No, you don't have to be
[12:02] afraid for me. Let let the dog out." So,
[12:06] you know, the dog comes out.
[12:08] And anyways, long story short, Caesar
[12:11] gets through this whole video of
[12:13] training after training after training.
[12:14] dog. Finally, the owners, the little
[12:17] girl and the little frail wife, they're
[12:20] able to command this dog and and and
[12:23] interact and have people over without
[12:25] any fear of this dog doing this. And
[12:26] people think, "Wow, this is just
[12:28] amazing." And Caesar says, "You know,
[12:31] there's four principles that I go by.
[12:33] Calm, confident, love, joy. Calm,
[12:38] confident, love, joy."
[12:42] And he
[12:45] says, you know, that the the atmosphere
[12:47] has got to be calm
[12:51] first. If you're excited, then the dog
[12:54] doesn't know what to do with that. And
[12:56] he's training people how to, you know,
[12:58] how to approach a dog. And and and the
[13:00] way that you're supposed to treat a dog,
[13:02] a dog, he says, you know, a dog is nose
[13:04] and then eyes and then ears. And this
[13:06] whole process, again, I I don't know all
[13:09] of this.
[13:12] Um, but he says, you know, you want to
[13:14] be calm first and then you want to be
[13:16] confident. You want the dog to know
[13:18] you're not afraid of the dog, but calm,
[13:21] confident, and then love. And then you
[13:23] can show love and all of this. And then
[13:25] joy comes at the end. After all of that,
[13:27] then then everybody's got this joy for
[13:29] the
[13:35] dog. And he's as he's talking about that
[13:38] I thought, yeah, that's right.
[13:44] That, you know, I don't know if is that
[13:46] that training is for the dog or if
[13:48] that's for the people. I think that's
[13:49] for the people to be calm and then to be
[13:52] confident and then there and then to
[13:54] show love and joy. I think Lord so many
[14:01] times in the when we read through the
[14:03] scriptures whenever somebody was in
[14:05] distress the first thing the Lord did
[14:08] was say fear
[14:10] not fear not is it is to let's calm
[14:15] things down.
[14:17] You know, the devil wants to stir things
[14:19] up. And if he can stir things up, then
[14:22] he can just create chaos. And then and
[14:24] then and then as much as you'd like to
[14:26] trust in the Lord, you're just
[14:29] struggling to to know what which way is
[14:33] up. So the Lord, he he can calm us if he
[14:37] can calm us first. If he
[14:41] can if we can be aware of his presence,
[14:47] And then and then you can be confident.
[14:50] And I think about these scriptures that
[14:52] we just read that David is admitting
[14:54] that man, when I'm in trouble, Lord, I'm
[14:56] going to cry out. I'm going to cry out
[14:59] to you. But as I abide in you, I'll
[15:03] trust
[15:05] you. And that's that gaining confidence
[15:07] in the Lord. It's that gaining
[15:10] confidence
[15:14] in he'll do what he says he's going to
[15:18] do. Do you believe me? I think so many
[15:21] times we're so used to this carnal world
[15:25] around us and and so maybe somebody
[15:28] letting us down or somebody hurting us.
[15:30] I've been hurt before. was brother
[15:33] Eleazer actually a couple weeks ago when
[15:35] he had ministered here he he gave a
[15:37] story and I really appreciated the story
[15:39] you gave he said he had had an uncle I
[15:41] believe it was an uncle brother Elzer
[15:43] that you said that he'd been hurt he'd
[15:45] been hurt in in church he'd been hurt by
[15:48] believers let's say or or or church
[15:50] people by by by so-called Christians
[15:53] he'd been
[15:54] hurt said he began to build a wall to
[15:57] protect himself from ever getting hurt
[16:00] again but all he did was wall himself
[16:04] off from other
[16:07] people. And I thought,
[16:15] man, that's not the
[16:19] idea. The idea isn't that, you know,
[16:22] when when something traumatic has
[16:24] happened that we just say, "I'll never
[16:27] let that happen again. I will never let
[16:30] that happen again.
[16:32] Instead of
[16:33] saying,
[16:35] "Lord, you allowed it. Now what what do
[16:39] you want? Where do I go from here?
[16:43] Whatever
[16:45] happens, I'm in your hands and I trust
[16:48] you and will I'm trusting you to get me
[16:51] through this."
[16:54] And I thought when when when Caesar was
[16:57] going through this training and he went
[16:59] through this calm, confident love, joy,
[17:03] I thought, man, that's just exactly like
[17:06] uh raising
[17:08] children. You know, it's like when when
[17:11] you're in when when you're when that's a
[17:13] brand new world to you. you you know
[17:15] you're holding your first child and and
[17:17] you realize you know yeah we wanted
[17:21] children
[17:22] but I have no idea what I'm doing like
[17:26] now it begins and I'm responsible for
[17:29] this little soul here and and and and
[17:32] you think you you know what I I I think
[17:36] I thought I wanted this but now I don't
[17:38] know what to do with
[17:40] it and they'll and and and so then it's
[17:43] like well calm down you're going going
[17:44] to get through
[17:46] this. And I I remember when when
[17:50] we were first parents, parents for the
[17:53] first time and and Melody was our first
[17:55] one and was born. They said right after
[17:58] the birth, uh they they take the baby
[18:01] and immediately they put it up on the
[18:03] mother and they say, "We want
[18:05] skin-to-skin, this skin-to-skin contact
[18:07] from the baby to the mother." And it's
[18:09] that it's that calming the baby
[18:13] knowing it's being familiar. That baby's
[18:16] already familiar with that mother.
[18:17] She's, you know, that child's been with
[18:19] that mother for nine months already
[18:20] growing. Knows the heart un has been
[18:23] listening to the heartbeat of the mother
[18:25] and so on and so forth. And that calming
[18:27] effect of that of that baby with that
[18:31] mother. And I thought, "Oh
[18:33] Lord, that is the
[18:36] truth that it's it's that when something
[18:39] traumatic happens or when something
[18:41] happens to us that shakes our world or
[18:44] shakes our faith and and and suddenly
[18:47] where one day we thought, you know, man,
[18:49] you know, you know, that stature of a
[18:52] perfect man, you know, there's the faith
[18:53] and I I got that and then the virtue
[18:56] and, you know, and you start, you know,
[18:58] working your way up and you go, you
[19:00] know, godliness and I've got that and
[19:02] then you go patience and then one day
[19:05] the Lord allows something to jerk the
[19:07] rug right out from under you and and
[19:09] you're like I don't even know if I have
[19:10] faith. I don't even know if I'm at that
[19:13] level
[19:16] anymore. That's when you that's when
[19:20] you're just like, Lord, just press me up
[19:22] against your chest.
[19:26] Just let me have that confidence, that
[19:28] security blanket to know that you love
[19:31] me, that you care for me, that you that
[19:33] you're still here even though my world
[19:36] just got shook
[19:38] apart. And I thought about this
[19:40] scripture in Isaiah
[19:43] 49:es 14 to 15. But Zion said, "The Lord
[19:47] hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
[19:49] forgotten me." Can a woman forget her
[19:53] sucking child that she should not have
[19:56] comp compassion on the son of her womb?
[19:58] Yay, they may forget yet will I not
[20:02] forget thee.
[20:09] I think man it's
[20:11] true, you know, as as much
[20:15] as you know, you can't
[20:19] imag Well, we've seen it. I mean, you
[20:21] see it in the news sometimes. You you
[20:23] see these terrible things how a mother
[20:25] could abandon her child. But we have a
[20:28] promise right there. to the Lord saying
[20:30] despite
[20:33] what you know it could happen but it
[20:35] cannot happen with
[20:43] me. I
[20:45] was listening
[20:47] to several sermons. I was listening to
[20:50] uh I think as a family during our
[20:52] devotions, we were listening to the
[20:54] message
[20:55] oneness. And I love that that message.
[20:58] And and then brother Brandham years
[21:00] earlier, I think he preaches a a sermon
[21:02] called the oneness of unity.
[21:09] And I was listening to those sermons and
[21:12] then it got me interested and or got me
[21:14] thinking about even the message lean not
[21:16] to thine own
[21:19] understanding. And I would really
[21:21] encourage you to go listen to to these
[21:23] sermons. Oneness I think is a tremendous
[21:26] sermon. I remember listening to oneness
[21:29] of unity years ago and and I was
[21:31] thinking this will be really nice. This
[21:33] will be a real nice you know it's all
[21:35] about oneness of unity. That's it's so
[21:38] nice, you know, what a nice thing. And
[21:41] then brother
[21:42] Brandham's really what he's focusing
[21:44] around, you're like, "Wow, this is
[21:47] intense, you know, and really kind of
[21:52] uh forceful, you know, and and then when
[21:54] you realize that he's he's really
[21:57] exposing the enemy, he's really exposing
[22:00] the devil and showing how that that he's
[22:02] wanting oneness of unity." And brother
[22:04] Brandham in that message he he goes to
[22:07] this scripture in Genesis 11. He uses
[22:10] this
[22:11] scripture in verses 5 and 6a. And the
[22:14] Lord came down to see the city. He's
[22:16] talking about now the tower of
[22:18] Babel. And the Lord uh came down to see
[22:21] the city and the tower which the
[22:23] children of men builded. And the Lord
[22:25] said, "Behold, the people is one.
[22:35] And in the oneness of unity, brother
[22:37] Brandham says, I just took this and and
[22:39] I'll I'll unpack it a little bit.
[22:40] Brother Brandham says, "And you know,
[22:42] that's God's plan. God wants people to
[22:46] be
[22:47] one." We're like, "Amen. That's right."
[22:50] And it's strange to think, but the devil
[22:52] tries to put his plan into existence and
[22:56] make the people one under his plan.
[23:00] Now, God has a plan and the devil has a
[23:03] plan. And then the devil is trying to
[23:06] get all people under his plan while God
[23:09] is trying to get people to be one under
[23:14] his
[23:21] plan. So, you know, you listen to that
[23:24] and you're going, "Okay, well, I know
[23:27] what I don't want.
[23:30] I don't want to be under the devil's
[23:31] plan to be one under the devil. I want
[23:35] to be one under God's
[23:38] plan. Brother Brandham, he he he takes
[23:41] it back to the garden. And he
[23:45] says, "When God made Adam and Eve and he
[23:48] put him in that garden, he in that
[23:51] walled garden, that protected place,
[23:54] that secure
[23:55] place." And he would come down in the
[23:58] cool of the evening and he would walk
[24:00] with them and he would talk with them.
[24:02] He said there was there was unity with
[24:05] Adam and Eve and with God. And God loved
[24:09] it. He loved that. and and and brother
[24:12] Brandham is expressing that's what he
[24:14] wants us to get back to and we can think
[24:19] we have our own imaginations of what
[24:20] that looked like and what that was like
[24:24] and sometimes when we get a cool
[24:27] evening you know in Phoenix or something
[24:29] and you're walking in this the cool of
[24:31] the evening you're
[24:32] thinking oh yeah this is
[24:35] nice I can't wait when this is forever
[24:39] and I don't have to go to work and and
[24:42] leave this and deal with the stresses of
[24:44] life.
[24:47] Brother Brandham is relating this this
[24:49] unity with God and this family this
[24:52] family unit and this unity with God as a
[24:57] family
[25:03] unit and how that
[25:06] there's that under that plan under that
[25:09] unity with
[25:11] God the
[25:13] security that God gives us that that the
[25:18] idea that that before the fall even in
[25:22] in in nakedness there was no need for
[25:24] shame. They were so they were so secure
[25:27] in God. There was no fear of of of of
[25:31] judgment of of ridicule of harm. There
[25:34] was none of that. There were there was
[25:36] such security in God that you know as as
[25:39] as brother Brandham even expresses in
[25:41] future home how that that
[25:43] that you know the scriptures and
[25:45] revelations talk about how that one day
[25:48] that you know there will be a child who
[25:51] will who will sit upon the whole of of
[25:53] of the snake and and and and the l the l
[25:58] the lion and the lamb will lay down
[26:00] together without fear of being eaten.
[26:02] And we think, "Yes, yes, that's what we
[26:06] want." And that security, there's no
[26:08] fear. There's just you're you're so
[26:11] secure in the presence of God that
[26:14] there's that there that that that love,
[26:17] that perfect love casts out all fear.
[26:21] And we think, "Yes, Lord. Yes, that's
[26:24] what I want." And we get glimpses into
[26:26] that. and and we come in and and and and
[26:29] whether that be in in a church service
[26:31] or whether that be just in your
[26:33] devotions, in your prayer closet, in
[26:35] your in your vehicle, you know, riding
[26:38] and speaking to the Lord, you begin to
[26:40] feel this security in
[26:43] Christ. And you think, "This is what I
[26:45] want. This is what I need." and and and
[26:47] and you get to this place even to where
[26:49] God can begin to build up your faith to
[26:52] the place where you start thinking, I
[26:54] feel like in this moment I could ask
[26:57] anything I wanted and God would give it.
[27:03] And there's this security and we think,
[27:06] "Oh yeah, there's security in God." And
[27:07] we we we come up with this notion
[27:09] there's only security in God and there's
[27:11] no security in the world. There's no
[27:14] security. The devil offers no security.
[27:17] And we want to and and and we want to go
[27:19] and preach that. We want to go to to the
[27:21] stranger and we want to say, you know,
[27:23] well, I don't know what you've got
[27:24] security, but there's absolutely no
[27:26] security. Uh the the devil offers no
[27:29] security. There's no unity that the
[27:32] devil would offer. But that's not
[27:34] exactly true.
[27:41] And when brother Brandon begins
[27:43] ministering in this oneness and this
[27:45] oneness of
[27:47] unity, that's exactly what the what the
[27:51] devil wants to
[27:54] offer, but he just doesn't offer it in
[27:58] the same way God offers it. And so it's
[28:01] a perverted security. And brother begins
[28:05] expressing that if you think that this
[28:09] oneness is is is in your
[28:14] organization. If you think that you're
[28:16] going to find
[28:17] security in your organization, if you
[28:20] think you're going to find
[28:22] security in in in the amount of wealth
[28:25] you can accumulate that once I reach
[28:27] this much money, I'll be I've got I'm
[28:31] secure. You've got another thing coming.
[28:38] The world the the the world right now
[28:40] the our our government right now is
[28:43] shook up with economic
[28:47] security. You you are seeing people you
[28:51] know just scrambling. Some are going
[28:55] it's going to be great and some are like
[28:56] this is the end and is there going to be
[28:58] a recession? Definitely. Is there going
[29:01] to be a recession? No way. You're safe.
[29:04] And you're like, who do I listen
[29:11] to? It's enough to shake you up.
[29:25] We think, well, my security's not in my
[29:28] job. Well, let me tell
[29:34] you, when it comes to PTSD or depression
[29:39] or
[29:44] anxiety, when people are going to
[29:47] psychologists and psychiatrists for help
[29:50] to help ease
[29:52] that that nervousness and that
[29:55] anxiety. and they're they're looking for
[29:58] help and they're going to the
[29:59] psychologist and they're going to
[30:00] psychiatrist. One of the first things
[30:02] that the psychologists ask the people
[30:06] is do you have a
[30:09] job? Because if you don't have a
[30:12] job, there's a good
[30:14] reason you you're probably a little bit
[30:17] nervous about your
[30:20] finances. You know, you got money going
[30:23] out. Where is it coming in?
[30:26] Well, I don't have anywhere where it's
[30:28] going out coming in. So, money's only
[30:30] going out. Yeah. Well, we got to stop
[30:33] that. So, that's one of the first thing
[30:35] that's asked. Do you have a
[30:38] job? If you don't have a job, we should
[30:40] try to get you a job because you've at
[30:44] least got that security where that won't
[30:47] be on the back of your mind of I don't
[30:50] have anything coming in to support me. I
[30:52] don't have anything coming in to support
[30:53] me. I have nothing coming in to support
[30:54] me. I need something to support me.
[30:57] That's the point of security is having
[31:00] support. You need
[31:03] support. So they say, "Let's get you a
[31:09] job."
[31:10] Then how's your relationship with your
[31:14] family? Well, that could go a hundred
[31:17] different
[31:19] ways. But do you have any family near
[31:22] you? Do you have anybody that that that
[31:24] loves you, that cares for you in your
[31:28] troubles, somebody that you could go to?
[31:31] What's your social life like? Do you get
[31:33] out much? Do you have any friends? Do
[31:35] you have people
[31:38] over? Do you have any social events that
[31:41] you go
[31:42] to? Do you have a church? Do you go to
[31:45] church? Do you have do you go to
[31:47] meetings? The idea is to build
[31:51] support and in that
[31:53] support you've got security. You have
[31:56] something to go
[32:02] to. But brother Brandham gets right down
[32:06] to
[32:07] it when you listen to things like the
[32:10] messages like investments and he's
[32:12] saying, you know, you you you want to
[32:14] you want to invest in something that
[32:15] that's got a good return for you. and
[32:17] he's and he's he's he's trying to get
[32:19] them to the gospel, but these are
[32:20] businessmen that he's talking to, full
[32:22] gospel
[32:25] businessmen. But he always comes down to
[32:29] if you think that it's that your money
[32:32] is that money is going to be be the
[32:34] thing that's going to be your security,
[32:37] it's volatile. It comes and it
[32:41] goes. And
[32:42] so we don't want to look to money for
[32:45] our security.
[32:47] as Christians, as
[32:49] believers, that that that that when when
[32:52] things happen in our life that have
[32:54] nothing to do with money, when it's
[32:56] something traumatic that has happened,
[32:58] whether it be whether it be in your
[33:00] family, whether it be in your church,
[33:03] whether it would be a church you a
[33:05] church blowing up or or or or or
[33:07] whatever it would be, somebody hurting
[33:09] you as you know, as as we alluded to
[33:12] before, somebody hurting you and
[33:13] somebody, you know, somebody betraying
[33:16] you, somebody lying to you and you're
[33:19] going, you know, it just shakes your
[33:20] whole world
[33:23] apart. Money can't buy peace
[33:27] in those kinds of
[33:39] situations. And ultimately, brother
[33:41] Brandham gets to the place where it's if
[33:44] you put your trust in men, they will let
[33:47] you
[33:49] down. Your trust has got to be in the
[33:52] word. It's got to be in Christ.
[34:00] Years ago,
[34:01] I
[34:03] preached a message about homeland
[34:06] security.
[34:10] And I think brother Brandham does such a
[34:13] nice job in the Revelations, I call it
[34:15] the Revelation series. It's when he's
[34:17] preaching Revelations chapter 1, chapter
[34:18] 2, chapter 3, chapter 4. I think he only
[34:20] gets to chapter
[34:22] 5. When we get to Revelations chapter 4,
[34:25] he preaches like three or four services
[34:28] on Revelations chapter
[34:30] 4. But in in Revelations 4:es 6-8, I
[34:35] want to read it for you. It says, "And
[34:37] before the
[34:38] throne there was a sea of glass like
[34:40] under crystal, and in the midst of the
[34:43] throne and round about the throne were
[34:45] four beasts full of eyes before and
[34:47] behind. And the first beast was like a
[34:49] lion, and the second beast like a calf,
[34:51] and the third beast had a face as a man,
[34:53] and the fourth beast was like a flying
[34:56] eagle. And the four beasts had each of
[34:59] them six wings about him. And they were
[35:01] full of eyes within, and they rest not
[35:03] day and night, saying, "Holy, holy,
[35:05] holy, Lord God Almighty, which was and
[35:07] is and is to
[35:14] come." And when brother Brandham is
[35:16] preaching Revelation chapter 4, he says,
[35:18] "Now these same creatures that we see
[35:21] here are the same creatures that we see
[35:23] in Ezekiel." One, if you go read in
[35:26] Ezekiel, these are the same creatures.
[35:29] But he says, brother Brandham then takes
[35:31] us all the way
[35:33] back to
[35:35] Genesis and he says when Adam and
[35:39] Eve were had left the garden, the
[35:43] scripture says that that the Lord put
[35:47] cherubams at the east end of the garden
[35:49] with flaming swords to guard the way of
[35:52] the tree of life. Brother Brandham is
[35:55] points us that these are the same
[35:59] creatures that were at the
[36:01] beginning. And he takes us from Genesis
[36:04] and then he takes us over into Ezekiel
[36:06] and he takes us even into into uh uh uh
[36:10] Leviticus and and and things where where
[36:13] he's showing the when when God showed
[36:16] Moses the pattern of the tabernacle and
[36:18] and and all of the the elements that
[36:21] were to go within the tabernacle. And he
[36:22] said, "These creatures are those
[36:24] creatures that that were on the the
[36:26] mercy seat that was over the ark that
[36:29] that that that guarded the ark of the
[36:31] covenant. They they were on top of the
[36:33] mercy seat." And you're going, "Wow,
[36:35] wow." And your eyes are just opening up
[36:37] to this and you're going,
[36:43] "Wow." And here in Revelations, we see
[36:46] these four beasts round about the throne
[36:50] and they're guarding that throne. It's
[36:51] the same image as the ark of the
[36:54] covenant guarding the shikina glory over
[36:57] that ark and and the elements in in the
[36:59] ark. There was the, you know, there was
[37:01] the law. There was the the the the the
[37:03] bud, the budding rod of of of Aaron.
[37:06] There was the mana. And and and that was
[37:08] all in this ark. And these creatures
[37:10] were guarding that. And that shakina
[37:12] glory would come down on it when the
[37:14] mercy seat when the blood was
[37:16] sprinkled. And and and you're just you
[37:19] begin to you're you're you begin seeing
[37:21] this and and I see this as I'm reading
[37:24] it. And I think and brother Brandham is
[37:27] talking about how that they're guards
[37:29] and they're guarding that and he's he's
[37:31] talking about that tree of life in the
[37:32] in Genesis how that they were guarding
[37:34] the way of the tree of life and they
[37:36] with had those flaming swords to keep
[37:38] men out of it
[37:40] until Christ came and that sacrifice was
[37:43] made. And then he says now they're
[37:45] trying to drive us back to that. They're
[37:48] trying to drive us back to the way of
[37:50] the tree of life. and and he's and and
[37:52] he's alluding to that is that is the
[37:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost. They're
[37:56] trying to point you to that. That's what
[37:58] Peter was pointing to on the day of
[37:59] Pentecost is to point you to the baptism
[38:02] of the Holy Ghost to where the very
[38:04] life, the very tree of life, the way of
[38:07] the tree of life now dwells within you.
[38:10] Brother Brandham says this in
[38:12] Revelations 4 part 3. Now God has a
[38:14] mercy seat today to be guarded.
[38:20] You believe that? Where's the mercy seat
[38:22] found? In the heart of man.
[38:26] Where did it come in the heart of man?
[38:28] At the day of Pentecost when the Holy
[38:31] Ghost, which is God, come into the human
[38:34] heart. Is that
[38:37] right? He goes on. He says, "Did you
[38:40] think that God don't put a guard around
[38:43] his word?
[38:46] See if that ox, lion, man, eagle isn't
[38:50] still setting at those gates right here
[38:53] on earth right now. Here's the gospels,
[38:57] the four gospels. See, and you notice
[39:01] every way they went. They went straight
[39:04] forward. They don't contradict one
[39:06] another. They stay with one another.
[39:11] See, one goes with the shrewdness of a
[39:13] man. The other one goes with the
[39:16] swiftness of a eagle. The other one's a
[39:18] pastor. One's evangelist to fly like
[39:21] evangelist. See, the other one's a
[39:23] pastor. The other one's a sturdy uh the
[39:27] other one's shrewd. See, guarded on
[39:29] every side. God guarding his Holy Ghost
[39:32] gospel. Believe it, brother. All
[39:38] right. There's so much
[39:42] here. I didn't even know what to put in.
[39:44] I put these in because I thought we
[39:46] could unpack this for a long time and
[39:48] I'm and I don't want to do
[39:50] it. But brother
[39:53] says what uh what they were guarding. He
[39:57] says what what are these four guards?
[39:59] Where can we find them? He says right
[40:01] here the four gospels, Matthew, Mark,
[40:04] Luke, and John. And what do they guard?
[40:07] The book of Acts. He says the acts of
[40:11] the Holy Spirit now inside of a person.
[40:14] And he and he and he and he says, "How
[40:16] do those gospels guard it?" And he
[40:18] begins taking us through the gospels of
[40:21] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. and
[40:24] showing how that each one in each of the
[40:27] gospels it points that if you ever
[40:31] there's a need for healing you can read
[40:34] in each of those gospels and you can see
[40:36] that it is God's will and his desire
[40:39] that there is divine healing in the body
[40:42] of
[40:44] Christ you think oh praise God that if
[40:48] ever I need healing if ever I've got a
[40:50] sick body and I can't afford insurance
[40:53] if If ever I've got a sick body and and
[40:56] there's no doctor that can see me, if
[40:58] ever I've got a sick body and I'm too
[41:01] far or I'm too far gone that anybody
[41:03] would even see me, God has got a plan of
[41:06] divine healing for us to believe in.
[41:12] Talk about a security blanket.
[41:18] You say, "Well, I've got good insurance.
[41:20] That's good." But then you show up to
[41:22] the hospital and say, "Oh, you know
[41:23] what? We don't cover that here. We
[41:26] You're going to have to go to an" and
[41:27] you're going, "I thought you guys
[41:28] covered that." No, we switched
[41:34] over. So, just in
[41:37] case they can't see
[41:39] you, guess what?
[41:43] There's still a great physician you can
[41:45] go and see.
[41:48] He goes into salvation and and he begins
[41:51] pointing and and and and he talks about
[41:53] you want to know who God is. Is he one?
[41:56] Is he three? I can show you he's one.
[41:58] And he begins taking you through
[41:59] Matthew, through Mark, through Luke,
[42:01] through John to show that there is one
[42:04] true and living God and his name was
[42:06] Jesus Christ and and that was him. And
[42:08] he points to that so that there's no
[42:10] confusion in your life. There's no point
[42:13] of there there's no need for chaos and
[42:15] being shaken as far as I don't know if I
[42:18] know God. I don't know if I can know
[42:19] God. How am I supposed to know who he
[42:21] is? You know, is he real? I don't know.
[42:24] My my faith seems to be shaken right
[42:26] now. It's okay. God's got security for
[42:29] that.
[42:32] Just dig into your go just dig into the
[42:35] gospels. And I love that it's guarding
[42:37] the book of Acts. And brother Brandham
[42:39] tells this story how that some some man
[42:41] had said you know the book of acts is
[42:42] just the framework. Brother Brandham
[42:44] said the framework he said I believe
[42:46] it's the gospels that's the framework
[42:47] that sets up for the book of acts to
[42:50] show that this is this is what Jesus
[42:54] promised in living flesh. now.
[43:03] But when
[43:05] he it's so nice to see that that that
[43:07] that we that those guards are guarding
[43:10] the word of
[43:11] God that that that that the four gospels
[43:14] we can read the gospels and we can see
[43:16] God is absolutely defending and
[43:20] identifying his
[43:22] works that he is the same yesterday,
[43:24] today and forever. that it's not just in
[43:27] the days of the apostles that it is
[43:29] still alive and well today in his
[43:35] church. But for him to go further as we
[43:39] read here and to say something like one
[43:43] goes with the shrewdness of a
[43:46] man, the other one goes with the
[43:48] swiftness of a eagle, the other one's a
[43:54] pastor, one's a evangelist. You're
[43:56] going, "Wait a second. You you just
[43:58] absolutely switched gears
[44:00] there. Truess of man, swiftness of an
[44:04] eagle. Now you start bringing in offices
[44:06] within a
[44:07] church w within the within the operation
[44:11] of of the body of
[44:15] Christ. The other one's he says see the
[44:19] other one's a pastor. The other one's
[44:22] sturdy. Is a pastor not sturdy? Is that
[44:25] you know I don't know if he's getting to
[44:26] that. The other one's shrewd. See
[44:29] guarded on every side. God guarding his
[44:31] Holy Ghost gospel. Believe it brother.
[44:33] All right. I love that because when if
[44:38] if ever you've been burned, if you've
[44:40] ever feel like he, you know, that
[44:44] brother let me down. I really depended
[44:47] on him. You know, I really thought that
[44:50] that brother was solid, but I just don't
[44:52] know anymore.
[44:57] Well, believe it or
[44:59] not, wherever there's a counterfeit,
[45:03] there's got to be a real.
[45:09] And I think that relates so much to that
[45:12] story that brother Eleaser had told
[45:14] about, I'll never get hurt. I'll never
[45:16] let a man I'll never let a man do that
[45:18] to me again. But if you wall yourself
[45:20] off from that, then you'll never let a
[45:22] man do anything for you ever again. And
[45:26] God, his his plan was to use
[45:34] men. So you're cutting yourself off from
[45:36] the plan of God when you do
[45:41] it. It's like, but I know a bad one.
[45:44] Yeah, I'm sure we all know a bad one,
[45:46] but God's got real ones.
[45:51] God's got real men that have got the
[45:54] word of the Lord that can that that that
[45:56] that that that can preach what God
[45:59] desires
[46:01] for his sons and his daughters to
[46:03] receive something from him. Not from the
[46:06] man, but from God.
[46:18] There was a man and he
[46:21] was going over that that saying, "Fool
[46:25] me once, shame on
[46:27] you. Fool me twice, shame on
[46:32] me." And then he went on further. He
[46:34] said, "And fool me three
[46:36] times. Shame on you again. You fooled me
[46:39] twice. How'd you do that?" He said,
[46:41] "Fool me four times.
[46:43] Shame on me again. How How did I How did
[46:46] I let you do that? And he You think,
[46:48] "How far is he going to take this?" He
[46:49] says, "Now, just hold on. I got 12 of
[46:50] these." And you're going, "Whoa." He
[46:52] didn't. But he took it all the way to
[46:53] seven. Fool me seven times. When it gets
[46:57] to seven times, he said, "Fool me seven
[46:59] times." There's uh there's no shame in
[47:02] anybody. You're a
[47:05] professional. I think that's, you know,
[47:07] so many times we take cliches like that.
[47:09] We say, "Oh yeah, fool me once." Shame
[47:12] on you. Or shame on me, but fool me
[47:15] twice. No, be shame on you the first
[47:17] time. Shame on shame on you the second
[47:19] time. And then and and we use that to
[47:23] cut people
[47:24] off. Say, "You fool me. You know, you
[47:27] let me down more than
[47:29] once. You're not my brother no more." I
[47:33] want you guys to know
[47:36] that you're never allowing God to
[47:40] operate through somebody again.
[47:48] So I'm so grateful when I read things
[47:50] like this or when I hear brother
[47:52] Brandham correlating these four
[47:57] creatures to
[47:59] ministers to men of God who have the
[48:02] word of the Lord who take the bread of
[48:04] life and they they they break it evenly
[48:07] and and rightfully and they and they can
[48:11] bring it to you and you think what a
[48:13] blessing what a blessing to hear that
[48:15] that was for me. So many times you leave
[48:17] a service, you go that was for
[48:27] me. There's a story that brother
[48:30] Brandham tells and
[48:31] I'm I'm closing with this. In
[48:34] fact, I'll ask the musicians to
[48:41] come. You'll know this story brother
[48:43] Brandon tells it. I I found it like 28
[48:47] times. I found him telling this story
[48:49] about how he had a friend, I believe his
[48:52] name was brother Snyder, had come and
[48:54] visited him and he was he became an
[48:57] insurance
[48:59] salesman. And he asked Brother Brandon,
[49:01] "Brother Brandon, you know, I'm I'm a
[49:04] insurance salesman. I'd like to sell you
[49:06] some insurance." And brother Brandham
[49:07] says, "I've got I've got
[49:09] assurance, you know, and and and the man
[49:11] thought he said insurance. Brother
[49:12] Brandham said, "I didn't, you know, I
[49:13] didn't tell him any different, but I
[49:15] said assurance." And he said, "My wife
[49:18] looked at me kind of funny, like, you
[49:19] liar. We don't have
[49:22] insurance." He said, "But the man said,
[49:24] Billy, I didn't realize that you had
[49:26] that you had any insurance." He says,
[49:28] "What what what kind is it?" Brother
[49:31] Brandham says, "Eternal
[49:33] life." He says, "Man, I've never heard
[49:36] of that. You know who you know who who
[49:40] with who's this from?" And brother
[49:42] Brandham in stories he makes, you know,
[49:44] in different occasions makes up
[49:46] different ones.
[49:47] And you all know how that how the story
[49:50] goes.
[49:52] He he says, "Well, what what insurance
[49:55] is this, Billy?" And he said, "It's
[49:58] blessed
[50:00] assurance. Jesus is mine. Oh, what a
[50:04] foretaste of glory, divine, heir of
[50:06] salvation, purchase of God, born of his
[50:09] spirit, washed in his
[50:12] blood. And he says, "That's very fine,
[50:15] Billy, but that won't put you in the
[50:18] graveyard when you're gone." He says, "I
[50:21] realize that, but it'll get me out."
[50:25] And we hear that story and we hear it so
[50:28] many
[50:29] times and we think, "Oh, that was
[50:31] clever. Oh, I want to use that sometime.
[50:34] Can't wait till the next door too
[50:36] insurance guy comes to my house. I'm
[50:38] gonna use
[50:40] it. But brother Brandon also says,
[50:43] "Look, I got nothing against insurance."
[50:46] He says, "That's a fine thing to have."
[50:48] He says, "I don't I think he in some
[50:51] places says I don't have any myself. I
[50:54] He says, you know, I've seen I've seen
[50:56] it get abused and so forth, but
[50:59] [Music]
[51:03] Brother Brandon in Hebrews chapter 6
[51:06] number three he finishes that
[51:08] story and right after he says and since
[51:12] I have the assurance by the sworn God of
[51:15] eternity that he will raise me up again
[51:19] in the likeness of his son in the last
[51:22] day I'll walk
[51:24] boldly and have a consolation and an
[51:27] anchor of the soul.
[51:30] that while I'm in this veil, there is
[51:32] some unseen something got me anchored
[51:35] against the rock of ages
[51:38] [Music]
[51:39] yonder. When the waters jump and
[51:42] blast, doesn't make any
[51:47] difference. If death, perils, or
[51:49] anything separates us not from the love
[51:52] of God, my anchor holds within the veil.
[51:57] [Music]
[51:58] Let the floods
[52:00] rise. Let her dash. Let infidels come.
[52:05] The bornag again believer has an
[52:09] anchor. I can't see through this veil
[52:12] yet. But I know my anchor holds yonder
[52:15] against the rock of ages who is a sworn
[52:19] promise that he will raise me up at the
[52:22] last day.
[52:32] [Music]
[52:41] If ever there's a time when you feel
[52:44] shaken, when when storms blast, when
[52:47] when waves come crashing, and they will,
[52:50] and they do,
[52:56] [Music]
[52:59] You got to have
[53:05] security. You got to have something to
[53:08] anchor to. You got to have something
[53:10] that'll hold you. When you can't hold
[53:12] on, you got to have something that'll
[53:14] hold you.
[53:17] And if you've ever
[53:22] experienced that
[53:25] anxiety, that chaos when when you've
[53:28] been hit with something and that comes
[53:30] across your life, across your home,
[53:32] across your family, whatever it
[53:35] is, and you think, I God, I all these
[53:38] years I thought I was a believer. All
[53:40] these years I
[53:42] thought and now I'm not even sure what I
[53:46] am. I don't know if I've got the goods
[53:48] anymore. God, I don't
[53:56] know if you got to have that anchor. You
[53:59] got to have him holding
[54:02] you. And if you've got that, that's
[54:05] blessed assurance.
[54:08] It's beyond any
[54:11] insurance. It's beyond any backup plan.
[54:14] God's not interested in any earthly
[54:16] backup plans you've got and any escape
[54:19] hatches you've got at the very bottom of
[54:22] your plans. He's not interested in that.
[54:24] He wants to get you pinned to a place to
[54:27] where he says, "I want you to have no
[54:29] more back, no more escape routes, no
[54:33] more back alleys. I need it to be me and
[54:36] you.
[54:38] I need to be your only plan.
[54:42] And I'll never abuse you. I'll never
[54:45] molest you. I'll I I'll never treat you
[54:48] wrong. I
[54:49] promise. And and and and that's when you
[54:52] when you read David and you hear him
[54:55] from his heart crying out that God, when
[54:59] I'm abiding in you, that's when I can
[55:02] trust
[55:03] you. that whatever decision that the God
[55:07] makes from there, whatever tomorrow
[55:09] holds, you say, "God, I don't know if
[55:12] I'll even make it to tomorrow, but I
[55:15] trust you with whatever
[55:26] comes. I want that for
[55:31] you. I want that for my kids.
[55:35] [Music]
[55:39] I want that for this
[55:43] church. No matter what happens, we trust
[55:46] him. We trust him in
[55:48] it. We we we
[55:51] all can just trust
[55:55] him. I want to pray with you if you'll
[55:58] stand with me.
[56:01] [Music]
[56:05] With our heads
[56:06] bowed and our eyes
[56:09] [Music]
[56:19] closed. Feel like sometimes the best
[56:21] place to talk about
[56:23] this is with a cup of coffee in a living
[56:27] room across from one another.
[56:32] But I
[56:33] [Music]
[56:35] pray church. I
[56:37] pray that this word and that this
[56:40] message, not my message, but the message
[56:43] of the
[56:45] hour, stirs up your heart, so that when
[56:49] you go home, when you say, "I got to
[56:51] finish up the rest of this week, even I
[56:54] just got to finish up the rest of this
[56:56] week." I pray that
[56:59] [Music]
[57:02] that the spirit of God can strike your
[57:05] heart to where you say,
[57:07] "God, what that preacher said that
[57:11] night, that's true. That's what I need.
[57:14] I got to have that or I need more of
[57:19] that." You cry out to
[57:22] God as David said. You cry out to God as
[57:26] we pray together. Heavenly
[57:28] Father, Lord, we thank you for your
[57:31] word. God, we thank you, Lord, for the
[57:33] security that you've put in place in
[57:35] your word, Lord. How that it carries us
[57:39] when we cannot carry
[57:42] on, Lord. You've worked in so many
[57:45] marvelous
[57:47] ways, Lord. And so many times
[57:52] we we may have in our own
[57:56] minds tried to create a security and and
[57:58] and and and think we know just how
[58:01] you're going to do
[58:03] it. And Lord, you come and you do it
[58:05] some other way. Lord, I
[58:09] pray Lord tonight for these people.
[58:13] Lord, for those that would be listening
[58:15] in on this service or Lord, those that
[58:17] are here tonight that God, as we would
[58:19] go
[58:20] home, that God, these things would be
[58:22] real in our
[58:23] life that when we begin to hear,
[58:28] Lord, whether it be your
[58:30] prophet, God, whether it be a pastor,
[58:33] whether it be an
[58:36] evangelist, God, they wouldn't
[58:37] contradict one another, but they'd all
[58:39] be pointing straight forward. they'd all
[58:41] be pointing to that security that we've
[58:44] got in your
[58:45] [Music]
[58:48] word. And I would ask heavenly father
[58:53] that Lord, if
[58:56] somebody's got a storm raging in their
[58:58] life right now, if they've got the waves
[59:00] crashing up against their boat right
[59:02] now, Lord, I pray that Lord, that
[59:07] anchor, God, they would know that there
[59:09] is an anchor. that God, they could tug
[59:11] on that anchor and they could know it's
[59:12] holding. It's holding. He'll
[59:16] hold. Lord, you're so real and I know it
[59:20] and I've experienced it that Lord, when
[59:24] chaos seems to
[59:25] come, Lord, and and and and shake our
[59:28] world that God, you're the constant.
[59:31] You're that north star. You're so
[59:33] immovable, Lord. You're you're you're so
[59:36] faithful in what you do.
[59:39] Lord, I just pray
[59:41] that Lord as we've all I pray
[59:44] experienced that that Lord we could
[59:47] unite together under your plan that God
[59:50] that that unity that we have in your
[59:53] spirit God would allow that security
[59:56] would allow our faith to rise up and our
[59:59] trust to be in you more and more and
[1:00:01] more.
[1:00:05] Grant us heavenly
[1:00:07] father. We ask it in Jesus Christ's
[1:00:10] name.
