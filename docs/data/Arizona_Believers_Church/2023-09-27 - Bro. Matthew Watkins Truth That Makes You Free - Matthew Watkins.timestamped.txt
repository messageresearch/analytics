[0:00] random would say that that there's only
[0:02] two spirits of influence
[0:05] and he would say really make it quite
[0:07] simple that there's either a spirit
[0:09] that's your influence from above or
[0:12] beneath and we know that the world that
[0:14] we live in is a world uh where there's
[0:16] many spirits that are influencing the
[0:18] minds of people and it's a there's a
[0:21] great entire structure or a system
[0:23] that's in the world today and whether
[0:26] people understand it or not their
[0:29] actions and what motivates them and what
[0:31] drives them is being influenced by a
[0:34] spirit the prophet of God would go
[0:36] further and actually say that there's a
[0:39] spirit upon every nation and he would
[0:41] say you know I've watched how the
[0:42] messages I would preach in one spot of
[0:44] the country this is the United States
[0:46] will just have a powerful impact and he
[0:49] said you have that same message I preach
[0:51] it somewhere else and it just sort of
[0:52] you know would fall flat and we all know
[0:54] what that feels like when it falls flat
[0:56] and and brother Byron would say that you
[0:59] know how one one it would work here but
[1:01] it wouldn't work there and how that
[1:03] every nation would have a spirit you
[1:05] know would speak about the German spirit
[1:07] that it was very stoic and and sorry if
[1:11] you're German here tonight I'm not
[1:12] picking on you I'm just reading what a
[1:13] prophet said but he would say that a
[1:15] German spirit is very stoic it's very
[1:17] you know it's very uh uh independent
[1:21] that's what he said and he said you know
[1:23] just very uh stoic that he said brother
[1:24] Brandon would say you just sit there and
[1:26] speak to them and he'd come with that
[1:28] southern you know just a real honey you
[1:31] know uh kind of way and he'd say you
[1:33] know good morning to you and he said
[1:35] good morning and and he said she'd just
[1:37] sit there the German you know in her
[1:39] nature and he said she'd just sit there
[1:40] and stare at you
[1:42] and it says sure fine morning ain't it
[1:45] and she'd sit there and stare just it
[1:47] was inner nature it was something
[1:48] because she was under the influence of
[1:51] that Spirit of her family who was under
[1:53] the influence of a Nation friends let me
[1:55] just tell you that this nation also has
[1:58] a spirit it's not one that I want
[2:00] ingesting and so I don't want to ingest
[2:01] the spirit of this nation and brother
[2:03] Madam say the spirit of America would be
[2:05] haha it's all just a joke haha you know
[2:09] just everything's funny and you make
[2:10] light and you trivialize everything and
[2:12] I'm afraid if I could just preach for a
[2:15] minute that that's how the nation has
[2:16] gotten to the Bible That's How they've
[2:18] gotten to the word of God it's just a
[2:20] haha you know they just trivialize it
[2:22] it's make it minimize it and make it
[2:24] something less but friends I'm not I
[2:27] just want to say I I don't believe a
[2:28] True Believer is subject to a spirit of
[2:31] Germany or or France or Switzerland or
[2:34] America or the west or the east or the
[2:37] North I'm not a southerner I'm not a
[2:39] northerner I'm from the north all right
[2:41] it's from above
[2:42] and I'm subject to the city brother
[2:44] Brandon would say of my rebirth
[2:48] and so I'm not I'm I'm I'm in the world
[2:51] but I'm not of the world and the prophet
[2:53] of God say he would take the words of
[2:55] Jesus when he said if you love the world
[2:57] or the things of the world then the love
[3:00] of God is not in your heart now that
[3:02] word world is the word uh Cosmos it's
[3:05] the if you ever know the word chaos it's
[3:08] the direct opposite of the word chaos
[3:10] where uh Cosmos and Chaos won his order
[3:13] one is disorder but the prophet says
[3:16] it's a it's a music it's a Harmony it's
[3:19] a rhythm there's a certain Spirit that's
[3:21] influencing the world the minds of the
[3:24] world and let me just say all Spirits
[3:27] are maturing in the age that you live in
[3:30] listen friends the same spirits that you
[3:32] face today are no different than the
[3:35] spirits that they faced a hundred years
[3:37] ago it's only the maturing of that same
[3:40] Spirit listen people change and people
[3:43] die but Spirits never die and Spirits
[3:45] never change the same Antichrist spirit
[3:48] that all the world's waiting on John
[3:51] says the Paul says doth already work
[3:54] and so the spirit of antichrist was in
[3:57] the days of Paul it was in the days of
[3:58] Jesus it's only at a further
[4:00] manifestation that we live in right now
[4:03] how many can just identify and say I I
[4:05] can see the maturity of all Spirits
[4:09] coming to the fruition or the climax
[4:15] it's coming to maturity let me just say
[4:17] friends the spirit of the devil as more
[4:20] bold than he's ever been before come on
[4:22] somebody help me tonight he's more bold
[4:25] he's more out in the open he might win a
[4:27] hid somewhere in a closet but they came
[4:29] out of the closet it's the it's the
[4:31] expression of all Spirits it's more in
[4:33] your face than it ever was before listen
[4:36] I live in the Bible Belt and so I know
[4:38] that if it's open if the lgbtq and all
[4:41] of that kind of agenda and furries and
[4:44] and all kinds of things you know if
[4:46] those kind of spirits are there in the
[4:48] Bible Belt back home and The Good Old
[4:50] sassafrased South then how much more
[4:52] would it be in a in a place that's maybe
[4:54] not so leaning towards the old-fashioned
[4:58] way listen friends the devil is more out
[5:00] in the open he's more bold he's more in
[5:03] your face he doesn't mind he just sits
[5:06] right there and declares what he is I'm
[5:08] just going to preach here and say if the
[5:10] spirit of the Antichrist is bold and
[5:13] expressing himself how much more is the
[5:15] Holy Ghost wanting to express himself
[5:18] and pour out his Spirit upon his family
[5:20] and say if the devil's bold then let the
[5:23] Church of the Living God have all
[5:25] boldness to speak the truth of the word
[5:27] of God
[5:30] and so notice here it would it would be
[5:33] a spirit that would influence the minds
[5:36] of people and it's in the education
[5:38] system it's in the political system
[5:40] don't get me started on that
[5:43] and the Republicans as my dad says and
[5:46] the demon Kratz and I'm neither I'm a
[5:49] Christian
[5:52] and so so it's a spirit that's
[5:54] influencing Hollywood would be the new
[5:57] Babylonian Babylon the new capital that
[6:00] where all entertainment flows through it
[6:02] and it affects the it affects the the
[6:05] movies it affects the TV it affects the
[6:07] schools it affects education it affects
[6:10] uh it affects Recreation and let me just
[6:13] can I'm just saying it a little bit
[6:15] further it affects our pulpits it
[6:17] affects our churches the prophet of God
[6:20] said the reason why you have child
[6:21] delinquency is parent delinquency and
[6:24] the reason we have parent delinquency is
[6:26] Pulpit delinquency
[6:29] to where we've watered down the word and
[6:32] everyone's afraid to speak the truth
[6:34] it's going to go ahead and cut to the
[6:36] chase to my thought here tonight I might
[6:38] blow my wad but let me give you the
[6:40] punchline let me just let me just say to
[6:42] you today friends there's only one thing
[6:44] that'll set people free that's the truth
[6:48] and unless you speak the truth you'll
[6:52] only dance around a spirit
[6:55] hello
[6:56] and so God knowing the confusion that
[6:59] would come upon the world the god there
[7:02] would have to be a voice of truth that
[7:05] would have to be a voice if there's a
[7:06] voice of lies and there's got to be a
[7:09] Voice of Truth and I truly believe
[7:11] tonight that the Voice of Truth is still
[7:14] speaking if only we'd be still enough to
[7:17] listen
[7:19] and so that Voice of Truth speaks it's a
[7:22] voice that cuts through all the other
[7:24] voices as the voice that that breaks
[7:28] through all the complexes and all the
[7:30] doubt and and all of the fears but but
[7:33] let me just say this to you friends
[7:34] today that that you've got to have truth
[7:37] you've got to start with God's view of
[7:40] Truth
[7:41] because the Bible says that the carnal
[7:43] mind is enmity
[7:46] hello
[7:47] the carnal mind is enmity against God
[7:51] I'm giving you straight from the Bible
[7:53] the carnal mind is enmity against God
[7:57] not with God and you know how powerful
[8:00] that is in Romans 8 verse 5 it says 4 to
[8:03] be carnally minded
[8:06] is death
[8:08] so what is carnally that means when
[8:10] you're lust that means when you're
[8:12] lustful that means when you're thinking
[8:13] the wrong false no it's not that's not
[8:15] what the Bible's saying the Bible's
[8:17] saying the but the mind that you have
[8:19] that you're born with if you just have
[8:22] that mind and you never receive the mind
[8:24] of Christ that's the carnal mind that
[8:26] produces death
[8:28] but I'm thankful as apostle Paul says
[8:31] but we have the mind of Christ or aren't
[8:35] you glad today you're not in an insane
[8:37] world you have access to the mind of
[8:39] Christ you have access to what God
[8:42] thinks you have the revelation of what
[8:44] God says a man is not what the world
[8:46] says not what the school says but I know
[8:48] what the word says and so I've got the
[8:50] definition of a woman I know what a man
[8:52] is I know what a Believer is I know what
[8:54] a teenager is I know what a church
[8:56] should look like I know what worship
[8:58] feels like hello somebody help me I know
[9:01] what it feels like because I've got the
[9:03] mind of Christ about his words friends
[9:06] I'm just going to go in and tell you you
[9:07] might not agree with me but I'm going to
[9:09] tell you how I've viewed the message
[9:10] over the hour it's not quotes it's not
[9:12] books it's not tapes it's not a
[9:14] prophet's message I just go ahead and
[9:15] say it it's the mind of Christ it's the
[9:19] very mind we have the mind of Christ
[9:21] Hallelujah
[9:23] for to be carnally minded as death but
[9:26] to be spiritually minded is life I want
[9:30] life and peace how many want that here
[9:32] tonight because the carnal mind is
[9:35] enmity against God
[9:40] for it is not subject to the law of God
[9:43] nor indeed can be so then those who are
[9:47] in the flesh cannot please God the
[9:51] prophet of God would say and why I'm
[9:52] against organized religion he said what
[9:54] does that mean when the Bible in the
[9:56] Bible says that the carnal mind is
[9:57] enmity he says it's the word contrary
[10:00] it's the very opposite it's contrary
[10:03] with the word listen friends your body
[10:06] will never agree with what your spirit
[10:07] is saying that that that carnal nature
[10:10] and that carnal flesh that you have I
[10:12] don't care if you're born again I don't
[10:14] care if you're filled with the baptism
[10:15] of the Holy Ghost you've still got a
[10:17] stinking rotten mind and a stinking
[10:19] rotten flesh that a war with you brother
[10:22] Brandon said all the days of your life
[10:23] you'll have a Cocker Barrel nature and
[10:25] he said it'll be a nature down on the
[10:27] inside it's been changed but on the
[10:29] outside it Wars it fights it questions
[10:32] it doubts it it struggles it it always
[10:34] doubts the let me just go ahead and tell
[10:36] you though tonight that's not you that's
[10:38] not who you are the prophet of God would
[10:41] say did you realize you've never even
[10:43] seen each other he said do you realize
[10:45] we say I see brother Elliot here tonight
[10:47] that's brother Elliot brother Brandon
[10:48] says actually I've never seen brother
[10:50] Elliot and he said do you realize that
[10:52] you've never seen me brother Bernie you
[10:54] might have thought you knew when we ate
[10:55] it where Whataburger earlier but that's
[10:57] not really who I am prophet of God said
[10:59] we've actually never seen the real you
[11:05] but we heard from it
[11:07] I said we heard from him prophet of God
[11:10] said you when you recognize this message
[11:12] was Eagles food you left the other thing
[11:15] you heard from your theophany
[11:18] said by the man you believe you hear
[11:20] from your theology I believe I hear from
[11:21] it every day every day when I feel like
[11:23] quitting I hear a voice that says you
[11:25] can't quit every day that I hear a voice
[11:27] said you're never going to make it I
[11:28] hear a voice that says you're going to
[11:29] make it child in fact you've already
[11:31] made it every time I hear a voice that
[11:33] says you'll never amount to nothing I
[11:35] hear a voice from truth from above that
[11:37] says you're a child of the king greater
[11:40] is he that is in you than he that is in
[11:42] the world
[11:43] Hallelujah
[11:45] you heard from your theophany listen
[11:48] friends it's not a voice that I can
[11:50] speak it's a voice from above
[11:52] and he said it's contrary to the mind of
[11:55] God brother Brandon says you've never
[11:57] even seen each other you know what take
[11:58] such courage in that because if I've
[12:00] never really seen each other then the
[12:01] man I see in the mirror that makes so
[12:03] many faults and so many failures and so
[12:05] many mess-ups come on brother can we
[12:07] agree with that we we got so much rotten
[12:10] stinking problems are rotten flesh and
[12:12] problems in our flesh and we say the
[12:14] wrong things and think the wrong things
[12:15] I got a message for the devil that's not
[12:17] me that's not who I am my representation
[12:21] is from above I'm a Believer down on the
[12:23] inside I don't question the word of God
[12:25] I believe the word of God I want the
[12:28] word of God hallelujah
[12:31] so Paul I'm going to read to you from
[12:32] Spurgeon this is powerful Paul didn't
[12:34] say that the carnal mind is at enmity
[12:37] with God he put it even stronger than
[12:40] that the carnal mind is
[12:44] enmity
[12:46] against God
[12:48] it is not black
[12:50] but Blackness it is not at enmity but
[12:55] enmity itself
[12:57] it is not corrupt but corruption it is
[13:02] not rebellious it is rebellion
[13:05] it is not Wicked it is wickedness itself
[13:09] the heart though it be deceitful is
[13:12] positively deceit
[13:15] it is evil in the concrete
[13:19] sin in the essence
[13:22] the quintessential I can't pronounce
[13:25] spurgeon's word there of all things are
[13:27] vile it is not envious against God it is
[13:33] envy
[13:36] it is not at enmity it is actual enmity
[13:42] listen what brother Brandon says here in
[13:44] the message of deceived Church by the
[13:46] word by the world I love this message if
[13:48] you haven't heard a good one uh if you
[13:50] haven't heard this lately this is a real
[13:51] good one you can go and listen to in
[13:54] 1959 I'm quoting from June 28th and he
[13:57] says then they bound the church with
[13:59] another cord as Delilah did and then
[14:03] they begin instead of having God called
[14:05] man man who were called by the Holy
[14:09] Spirit maybe didn't know their ABCs but
[14:13] they know Christ then the church got
[14:16] stylish
[14:17] and fashioned after the political
[14:19] speakers and they had to give their
[14:22] preachers doctors degrees everybody had
[14:26] to be a doctor of divinity that wasn't
[14:29] listen that was another cord to bind the
[14:33] church
[14:36] now he's preaching a deceived Church by
[14:38] the world a church in the with their
[14:42] head in the lap of Delilah
[14:46] that was another core to bind the church
[14:48] men go off to study each Seminary tries
[14:52] to produce a better scholar so that
[14:54] their churches can brag our pastor is a
[14:57] doctor of divinity and what did they do
[14:59] one try to have more knowledge than the
[15:01] other one well that doesn't mean
[15:03] anything in the sight of God I'm so glad
[15:05] it doesn't and there's no need for any
[15:08] man to try to take his worldly knowledge
[15:10] and ever please God with it it's an
[15:13] abomination in the sight of God you'll
[15:15] never please God with the worldly
[15:18] Ambitions and knowledge because it's
[15:21] enmity to God says the scripture he
[15:24] cannot do it and each one tries to have
[15:27] all the knowledge they they know just
[15:29] what to do and the words to say and and
[15:32] it becomes just a political speech in
[15:36] the stead in the place of a powerly
[15:39] demonstrated Holy Spirit message that
[15:42] sinks to the heart of man and discovers
[15:45] his sin I say God give me that kind of
[15:47] message
[15:48] something that'll sink to the very heart
[15:51] of man and discover my sins how many
[15:53] brothers would identify and sisters and
[15:55] say give me that kind of message they've
[15:59] trained for a political talk we don't
[16:00] need that Paul said the word come to us
[16:03] not only the gospel in word only but
[16:06] through the power and the manifestation
[16:09] of the Holy Ghost that brought the
[16:11] gospel demonstrating the powers of the
[16:15] Holy Ghost but all these men go off to
[16:18] seminars seminaries and they learn great
[16:20] educations and how they must stand
[16:22] before the people and how may that they
[16:25] must present themselves and how they
[16:27] must dress and how they must act and
[16:29] they should never use the wrong grammar
[16:32] now that's all right
[16:34] for a political speech
[16:37] got them live right now all those
[16:39] Republican candidates man given their
[16:41] polish political speech and saying
[16:43] everything perfectly brother Brandon
[16:45] says but we're not after the enchanting
[16:47] words of man
[16:49] Paul said the gospel that I preached
[16:51] didn't come like that but it come
[16:53] through the renewing of the Holy Ghost
[16:55] and the power of demonstrations doesn't
[16:58] come from a right form speech but it
[17:01] come to the demonstrations of the power
[17:03] of the Risen Christ that's the gospel to
[17:07] know him in the power of his
[17:10] resurrection you know it's incredible to
[17:12] me I was watching a man here recently
[17:14] and not criticizing I mean that I'm not
[17:16] criticizing this this man he was a
[17:18] pastor of Omega massive mega church here
[17:21] out in the west coast and he was just
[17:23] you know as popular and as cool man he
[17:25] was as hip as and stylish and and just
[17:28] you know so relevant connected you know
[17:31] with this group of people and any any
[17:33] and you know you can imagine the amount
[17:34] of pressure that's on a man like this
[17:36] and here he's got thousands of people
[17:38] listening to him and and all kinds of
[17:41] different ideas and all kinds of
[17:42] different things and and different
[17:44] spirits and and and and so he starts you
[17:47] know trying to say I he says uh you know
[17:50] he's going to reach out and say
[17:52] something and you can tell how he's
[17:54] trying to be careful what he says the
[17:56] words he says the way he says it and
[17:59] then he finally just starts looking at a
[18:01] screen you could tell he just he's so
[18:03] careful he's got to read what he's going
[18:04] to say because he's going to address the
[18:06] LGBT uh uh community and the trans he
[18:10] says that in the trans community that
[18:12] are in his church and he starts saying I
[18:15] just I just want to say that that I I
[18:17] want to show you love and and
[18:19] understanding and I just want to say
[18:21] that trans transgender uh people are
[18:24] welcome here uh uh that they're welcome
[18:27] in this church and he and he starts
[18:30] saying this to these people and you can
[18:32] tell the way he's trying so hard he's
[18:33] trying to not compromise and say that
[18:36] it's okay but at the same time he's
[18:38] trying to be welcoming and it's okay if
[18:39] you come here we just want to say to our
[18:41] group you know you're welcome here and
[18:43] we want you to feel comfortable here we
[18:46] want you to feel like you know that you
[18:48] can come and you can just feel feel the
[18:50] tension
[18:53] man
[18:54] attention something you can feel buddy
[18:56] you could feel it in honey it's you you
[19:00] can just walk into a room man and you
[19:01] know somebody something ain't right I
[19:03] just walked in at the wrong time you
[19:05] know they and and she said something to
[19:07] him and he took a tone and you could
[19:09] watch it's just like whoa what did I
[19:11] just walk into you could feel that
[19:13] tension in that room and you could

[20:27] help a person by trying to watch them
[20:29] and and try to try to walk around them
[20:32] and walk on exercise listen friends a
[20:33] spirit loves to be petted it loves to be
[20:37] petted it loves to be walked around it
[20:39] loves to be caressed it loves it when
[20:41] you sort of dance around it you don't
[20:43] really come out and say it and you don't
[20:45] don't really want to it wants to be let
[20:47] me say this way a spirit loves to be
[20:49] Patty caked
[20:52] but it's a spirit
[20:54] and men have became afraid they've
[20:57] become afraid and let Spirits back them
[21:01] into corners but let me just preach to
[21:03] you as inspired as the lord gave it to
[21:05] me you must preach the word you must
[21:08] speak the word you must declare the
[21:11] truth it doesn't matter what it will
[21:13] cost you there's only one thing that
[21:15] will help them the truth there's only
[21:18] one thing that'll help them speak the
[21:20] word
[21:22] you'll never help them by petting it
[21:24] Patty caking it walking around it you've
[21:26] got to speak it you will never change a
[21:30] disbelieving heart by playing around
[21:32] with it
[21:35] let me give you a little catchphrase a
[21:37] good friend of mine back home gave me
[21:38] and I'm just using it and I love it
[21:40] fillings
[21:42] are overrated
[21:47] you can put that on a t-shirt
[21:50] fillings
[21:52] hello somebody come on
[21:54] I said people's feelings sometimes are
[21:57] just overrated
[21:59] and we become so careful we become so
[22:02] careful how we're going to say things
[22:03] listen friends oh we can't never let the
[22:05] spirit of God I'm just going to go ahead
[22:07] and say it I'm not going to let no
[22:08] Spirit back me into a corner afraid to
[22:11] speak the truth I've prayed afraid to
[22:13] preach the message with a bear a
[22:15] knuckled with no kid gloves I say what
[22:18] our churches need is the bare knuckle
[22:20] gospel that's the only way that you'll
[22:23] break the chains in people's life we
[22:25] can't be afraid to declare the gospel
[22:27] and I believe there's a church of
[22:29] Believers that'll say preach the word
[22:31] give me the pure word of God give it to
[22:34] me brother don't sugarcoat it how many
[22:36] would agree with that here tonight don't
[22:38] sugarcoat it don't walk around me don't
[22:41] dance around me speak it brother speak
[22:44] the truth of the word of God I want to
[22:46] go free and I need the truth to set me
[22:48] free
[22:53] foreign
[22:56] we became so afraid that we would offend
[22:58] somebody but the true gospel the truth
[23:02] the truth
[23:04] has always been
[23:06] and will always be a bold word that
[23:11] doesn't care about your feelings
[23:17] come on friends I'm preaching on Spirits
[23:19] here tonight
[23:20] I I don't know you and I don't I know
[23:22] only a few you I'm not from here this
[23:24] isn't you know I'm just taking some I'm
[23:26] just a preacher here tonight you'll get
[23:27] rid of me and and brother Aaron will be
[23:29] back I think anyway on Sunday but I'm
[23:32] just preaching against Spirits because I
[23:33] know this I know this is a spirit it's a
[23:36] spirit that affects the it's in the
[23:38] atmosphere of the world that you live in
[23:40] and if we're not careful we ingest some
[23:43] of those same feelings some of those
[23:45] same but some of those same ideas it's
[23:47] became to a place to where I'll just go
[23:49] ahead and preach it today it's became to
[23:51] a place that men are afraid to say Amen
[23:53] with their voice to the word of God in
[23:55] church
[23:55] it became to a place to where men I
[23:58] sometimes look around and say where's
[23:59] the men were you mice where's the men
[24:02] where's the man that'll speak where's
[24:03] the men that'll declare I'm not just
[24:05] talking about what's your vocal cords
[24:07] I'm talking about taking a stand for
[24:09] what's right taking a stand for the
[24:11] truth of the word taking a stand for the
[24:13] message of the hour
[24:15] do you know why brother Brandon preached
[24:17] at schools and gyms and auditoriums
[24:19] there I'm thankful for the high school
[24:21] for letting us in here today thankful
[24:23] for the Ramada Inn thankful for you know
[24:25] why he was preaching in Haas in hotels
[24:27] and gyms
[24:29] because the churches shut the door
[24:33] and when you're really preaching the
[24:35] truth
[24:36] when you're really preaching the true
[24:39] gospel not the watered down not the 2.0
[24:42] version
[24:43] you know as my dad likes to say like
[24:46] message you have the message of the hour
[24:48] then you have message light
[24:50] any software Engineers we got in here
[24:52] you know what I'm talking about
[24:54] you have like the light version of it
[24:55] you know just don't don't make it so
[24:58] extreme just sort of quote it you know
[25:00] I'm just going to say a phrase a lot of
[25:01] people preach about the message not
[25:03] married many preach the message
[25:05] you can preach about it and never preach
[25:07] it
[25:09] Lord where you got me tonight
[25:12] even while brother Branham is preaching
[25:14] the Rapture message
[25:17] there's men at the back of the exit
[25:19] doors waving their hands saying stop
[25:21] stop
[25:22] this is what the prophet of God had to
[25:24] deal with as he's preaching the Rapture
[25:26] message oh I think of that I say God I
[25:29] wish I could have been there I would
[25:31] have raised my hand I would have stood
[25:33] to my feet I would have said preach at
[25:34] brother Branham preach the word of God
[25:36] for Faith cometh by sharing and sharing
[25:40] of the word of God and if somebody won't
[25:42] preach they'll never hear it if somebody
[25:44] won't declare it and speak it it'll
[25:46] never get sent but I want to say Lord
[25:48] use my voice use my vessel Lord let me
[25:51] declare the truth that'll set free
[25:55] he's got men saying stop he went too
[25:58] long come on brother brother Branham
[26:00] come on just stop it stop it you you've
[26:02] gone too long I'll tell you what though
[26:04] brother random didn't stop
[26:06] he didn't stop preaching and I say thank
[26:08] God he didn't stop preaching the Rapture
[26:11] message what an important message oh no
[26:14] wonder all hell wanted to stop it no
[26:16] wonder there were spirits of resistance
[26:19] listen friends if you preach the truth
[26:21] there'll always be spirits of resistance
[26:25] yep that's right
[26:27] there'll always be a spirit of
[26:28] resistance that tries to get you to
[26:31] water it down you know message light you
[26:34] know message 2.0 let's re let's
[26:37] rearrange this thing let's re you know
[26:39] get people who say they believe it but
[26:41] you know they really don't if it really
[26:43] comes down to it you know I'm just going
[26:45] to go ahead and say what brother what a
[26:46] prophet of God said you know you don't
[26:48] have to convince a Believer you don't
[26:50] have to convince him they just believe
[26:52] it because they're a believer
[26:54] and the prophet of God he would deal
[26:56] with that Spirit of resistance that
[26:59] would try to stop the message from going
[27:01] forth
[27:03] I wrote these notes just to myself when
[27:04] I was reading this I know a True
[27:07] Believer knows that the masses of the
[27:11] world can never receive this truth
[27:15] I know that it's not supposed to be a
[27:17] popular gospel
[27:19] after all it was the Gospel that Jesus
[27:22] when he preached it it got him crucified
[27:25] when Paul preached it it got his head
[27:28] chopped off when Peter preached that God
[27:30] hung upside down on a cross when John
[27:32] preached to God and tried to boil him in
[27:34] hot water but she couldn't blow the holy
[27:36] ghost out of a True Believer listen
[27:38] friends it's always been the rejected
[27:40] gospel there's a reason the Apostle Paul
[27:42] would say I am not ashamed I am not
[27:46] ashamed of the Gospel why would he have
[27:48] to say that unless there was a reason to
[27:50] declare boldly I just want to say they
[27:53] might make it a shame but I want to make
[27:55] my stand and raise my hand and say I'm
[27:56] not ashamed of the truth I'm not ashamed
[27:59] of the true message of the hour I'm
[28:01] going to declare it just as he said it
[28:07] because the carnal mind always reasons
[28:09] and rationalizes
[28:12] and questions right
[28:15] hello
[28:18] let me say this friends if the devil can
[28:20] do anything he'll try to get us together
[28:21] he would try to get us if the devil can
[28:24] do anything to the church the prophet of
[28:26] God said he will try to get them to
[28:28] hybrid to take the truth
[28:30] but then to hybrid it to mix it
[28:34] let me just say this message can't be
[28:36] mixed
[28:37] if it's mixed it won't work
[28:40] you mix it with your idea it won't work
[28:42] mix it with your Doctrine it won't work
[28:45] mix it with your opinion it won't work
[28:47] mix it with Pentecostalism it won't work
[28:49] mixed it with Baptist theology it won't
[28:52] work
[28:53] you've got to just get the unadulterated
[28:55] pure word of God if you try to mix it it
[28:58] loses its effect
[29:02] it loses its power
[29:04] it's the prophet of God said you know
[29:06] many people believe Jesus was a Healer
[29:07] he said you know many people believed he
[29:09] was a prophet even the Muslims believe
[29:11] he was a prophet
[29:13] and he said many people believed he was
[29:15] a prophet some people believed he was a
[29:17] good killer and he said in Jesus brother
[29:19] Brandon said that he was and he said you
[29:21] know some people believe that he was a
[29:22] great scholar prophet's words not mine
[29:24] and he was
[29:26] that's what brother Brandon said he said
[29:27] he was a good scholar he said he was a
[29:29] good healer brother man says but you
[29:31] know if all you believed was that he was
[29:34] a good man then that's all you'd get
[29:36] from him
[29:37] isn't that a powerful statement
[29:39] if all you believed was a Healer he'd
[29:42] get healed of the body you're blind you
[29:44] get get your eyes open that's wonderful
[29:47] he said if all you believe that he was a
[29:49] good teacher then all you got from him
[29:51] well all you got from him was his
[29:53] teaching don't you see the pattern
[29:55] however you view him as what you'll
[29:57] receive from him
[29:58] that's some friends I'm gonna go ahead
[30:00] and bring it on down if all you see this
[30:01] message is is just another good man who
[30:04] had a good idea he was a good reformer
[30:06] he brought a little bit more truth to
[30:08] the word of God if all you see him if
[30:10] all you see the messages is books and
[30:12] tapes and doctrines and that's all
[30:14] you're going to get from it brother
[30:15] Brandon says but those who believed he
[30:17] was the Lamb of God he was the word made
[30:20] flesh to them he didn't just seal their
[30:22] bodies he saved their souls
[30:24] what do you think would have happened if
[30:26] Abraham wouldn't have believed and
[30:27] called Melchizedek my Lord what would
[30:30] have happened had he not viewed him for
[30:31] who he was but because he can see him
[30:34] for who he was he could change his body
[30:39] and I'm just going to say when you view
[30:41] this message and hold it in an arm's
[30:42] length and skeptical over it doubting it
[30:45] question ah not so sure about this and
[30:47] not so sure about that part and we don't
[30:49] really need to preach that we don't need
[30:50] to say that I'm not so sure that was
[30:52] brother Brandon's opinion and you know
[30:53] do we really come on we're in 2023 and I
[30:56] don't that's you know that's brother man
[30:57] was a little bit out of his era a little
[30:59] bit out of his time and you know lived
[31:01] in a different age and lived in
[31:02] different friends I'm preaching on
[31:03] spirits
[31:05] do you realize if you deduct and reduce
[31:08] it
[31:09] you sell yourself short of what it can
[31:13] do for you
[31:16] oh we don't need to hear it anymore
[31:19] we don't need to we don't need to you
[31:21] know what is it amazing you have one
[31:22] group saying all you do need to all you
[31:24] need to do is hear it just push play
[31:27] I said this to our church back home
[31:29] and I don't say this to you I'll tell
[31:31] you just what I told them I said you
[31:32] know we're we're we don't battle that
[31:34] there are some certain places that would
[31:36] battle a spirit to try to deify brother
[31:38] Branham and try to make him more than he
[31:40] was and try to you know uh you know uh
[31:43] try to deify his words and and try to
[31:46] say that his voice was the literal voice
[31:48] of God
[31:49] you know there there'd be a spirit that
[31:51] would try to say that would try to deify
[31:53] things and there's a spirit that would
[31:54] try to say push play and we don't need
[31:56] preachers we don't need you know you you
[31:58] we there were let me just let me tell
[31:59] you what I told him I said you know that
[32:01] that may be some places would battle
[32:02] trying to deify brother brandeman try to
[32:04] deify the message but I'll just be
[32:06] honest back home we that's not a spirit
[32:08] we'd ever battle
[32:09] our church was born right out of the
[32:11] world we don't have people that have
[32:12] been in the message for generations and
[32:14] generations and affected by this camp
[32:16] and this Doctrine and this idea there's
[32:17] people born right out from this right on
[32:19] the street so they love the message of
[32:21] the hour they love all of it they never
[32:23] battle or struggle with trying to Dee a
[32:25] fire put brother Branham higher than he
[32:26] was and deify him so you know what I
[32:29] said so I guess that means that we're
[32:30] just off the hook
[32:33] I mean devil won't even after come after
[32:34] us
[32:36] we'll never deify him
[32:38] I said no but you got to recognize if
[32:40] that's not our battle if our battle is
[32:42] not to deify him then it will be to
[32:45] de-emphasize him
[32:50] and if you're either battling one or the
[32:52] other
[32:52] because the Satan brother Brandon said
[32:54] Satan will kick you off to one ditch or
[32:56] to the other ditch
[32:58] try to make you extreme on one of the
[33:00] other
[33:01] let me just say to you in a world in a
[33:04] time where they're saying push play I
[33:06] say push play
[33:08] in a time where they're saying push play
[33:10] the tapes I say play the tapes preach
[33:13] the word of God be instant be in season
[33:15] be honest I'm not going to let a voice
[33:17] that that goes to the extreme kick me
[33:19] off and not listen to The Rapture
[33:21] message I'm going to feed on the word of
[33:23] God don't let a scarecrow try to push
[33:26] you away and make you extreme on
[33:27] something else friends we've got the
[33:29] mind of Christ we know what he wants
[33:31] done with his word
[33:34] and how does it be very simple just as
[33:37] ABC as I can be here tonight if you're
[33:40] not hearing the message of the hour the
[33:43] tape voice of God's prophet
[33:46] if you're not hearing and your diet and
[33:50] what you feed upon is just a feed
[33:55] because I'm afraid in 2023 that's really
[33:58] what people do is they get on their feed
[34:02] you ever realize what it's called a feed
[34:04] because it's feeding you something
[34:07] and it feeds you anxiety whether you
[34:10] realize that or not and it feeds you
[34:11] fear listen you go and feed on the news
[34:13] all you do is feed on the news I'd try
[34:15] to stay away from it I follow some of it
[34:17] but I'll just be honest with you when I
[34:19] read too much of it I get nervous and I
[34:21] wasn't nervous before I get anxiety and
[34:23] I didn't have that before I get worried
[34:25] and I didn't have that worry before
[34:28] sometimes we all got anxiety I got I got
[34:31] I got fear and people say that all the
[34:32] time and I'm sorry I got so much anxiety
[34:34] sometimes do we realize that the very
[34:37] thing that we're saying that we don't
[34:38] want we're feeding that very thing
[34:43] and the very thing we want free of the
[34:45] very things that we're ingesting is
[34:47] what's feeding that anxiety and that
[34:49] fear
[34:50] that Facebook feed that Snapchat feed
[34:52] that Tick Tock feed that Instagram feed
[34:54] I don't even know all the feeds
[34:57] I'll be I'll be straight up with you I'm
[34:59] pretty uh out of character for my age
[35:01] I'm not I'm a young guy but I don't I
[35:04] don't know all the the I'm pretty
[35:06] outdated I guess
[35:08] as someone told I was trying to make a
[35:10] reel and I didn't know what a real was
[35:12] and they wanted me to make a real so I'm
[35:13] I thought it was a b-real my daughter
[35:15] said she had a thing called be real and
[35:17] I thought that's what we were it's a
[35:19] real so I thought it was the same exact
[35:20] thing I had no idea people text me all
[35:22] the time and I don't text them back and
[35:24] I tell them I'm telling you I'm call me
[35:26] if you want me call me
[35:29] because I'm not good at texting I don't
[35:30] I won't a lot of times won't respond and
[35:32] I'm not a rude person but I'm just not
[35:34] I'm not caught up with that I don't know
[35:36] where that came from but that was free
[35:40] but we're not careful we feed on the
[35:42] wrong things I'm going to say this and
[35:43] I'm obeying the Holy Ghost here tonight
[35:45] how do you think you will take a Rapture
[35:47] if you're not hearing the Rapture
[35:49] message
[35:54] how do you think you'll receive a body
[35:56] change if you're not hearing a message
[35:58] that can change your body
[36:01] oh brother Matt are you saying you
[36:03] believe that faith that Rapture and
[36:05] Faith lays on the tapes I do not the
[36:07] mechanical not the device not the
[36:09] mechanics brother just heard brother
[36:11] Brandon say it today God never uses the
[36:13] instrumentality of mechanical devices he
[36:15] uses the instrumentality of man
[36:19] you see friends when I hear the voice of
[36:21] God's Pride I don't hear a voice from
[36:23] Earth I hear a voice from heaven
[36:26] I don't hear what I hear is not Earthly
[36:28] brother Bernie it's unearthly it's
[36:30] otherworldly
[36:32] I hear from my theophany I hear I hear
[36:35] who I am I hear where I came from I hear
[36:37] where I'm going
[36:39] how do we think we'll have a body change
[36:42] if we're not hearing the body change
[36:44] message
[36:45] if we're not listening to a message that
[36:48] brings change
[36:49] don't you see why there would be a
[36:51] spirit that would try to come in our
[36:53] message churches to tell us to stop
[36:56] quoting brother Branham
[36:59] stop stop it you preachers
[37:02] stop it stop quoting him brother Brandon
[37:04] just quote just preach the message but
[37:06] you ain't got to say brother Brandon
[37:07] said and brother Brandon said and
[37:08] brother Brandon said
[37:10] you ain't got to say that you say
[37:11] brother Matt yeah I've been told I'm
[37:13] telling you that's a real spirit
[37:17] don't say don't quote brother Brandon so
[37:19] much haven't we got beyond the point I'm
[37:21] the ones of Paul one's a cephas are you
[37:23] not carnal listen first you're such a
[37:25] perversion people use any kind of
[37:26] scripture they want to try to fits their
[37:28] narrative or their Doctrine
[37:31] we don't need to quote a prophet we
[37:33] don't need to say brother Brandon don't
[37:34] quote it let me just read you Luke 18
[37:36] verse 31 you got to know you got it you
[37:38] want to turn there turn with me Luke
[37:40] chapter 18 verse 31. let me hear the
[37:42] rustling of the leaves here let me hear
[37:44] those bibles if you got it on the screen
[37:46] you can do that if you can brother John
[37:48] Luke chapter 18 verse 31 notice this the
[37:52] Bible says then he took unto him the
[37:55] twelve this is Luke 18 verse 31. then he
[37:58] took unto him this is Jesus
[38:00] he took unto them the twelve and said
[38:03] unto them behold we go up to Jerusalem
[38:06] and all things that are written by the
[38:10] prophets
[38:12] concerning the son of man shall be
[38:14] accomplished Luke chapter 20 verse 24
[38:17] verse 25.
[38:20] just a few chapters over Luke chapter 24
[38:23] verse 25 says then he who's he Jesus
[38:27] said unto them o fools and slow of heart
[38:32] to believe all somebody say all
[38:37] to believe all that the prophets have
[38:40] spoken I'm just one of those who believe
[38:42] it all
[38:44] I'm one of those people brother Matt you
[38:46] see one of those I'm one of them
[38:48] thank God I can say I'm one of them I
[38:51] believe all that he said
[38:55] he said it fools and slow hurts to
[38:57] believe all that the prophets have
[38:59] spoken here's Acts chapter 24 chapter 3
[39:03] verse 24 Acts 3 verse 24
[39:07] yay this is Paul yea and all the
[39:12] prophets from Samuel and all those that
[39:15] follow after as many as have spoken have
[39:19] likewise foretold of these days yay all
[39:23] the prophets what was Jesus saying
[39:26] because the prophet said that it might
[39:28] be fulfilled by the words of Isaiah what
[39:30] was it do you realize Jesus Christ lived
[39:34] and preached constantly under the
[39:37] knowledge that he was quoting the
[39:39] prophets
[39:43] he was quoting the prophets
[39:46] you just read acts there's the Apostle
[39:48] Paul and he said this is Paul says that
[39:51] the prophets speak all the prophets from
[39:54] Samuel here's Matthew chapter three I
[39:56] know I'm going all over the place just
[39:58] listen here's Matthew chapter 3 now in
[40:00] those days John the Baptist came
[40:02] preaching in the wilderness of Judea
[40:04] saying repent for the Kingdom of Heaven
[40:08] is at hand for this is the one referred
[40:11] by Isaiah the prophet oh quit quoting
[40:15] those prophets well John didn't quit
[40:18] Paul didn't quit Jesus didn't quit then
[40:21] I'm not going to quit quoting a prophet
[40:24] Hallelujah
[40:26] you know what you have all through the
[40:28] New Testament I can read you Matthew 8.
[40:30] I can read you Matthew 12. uh that it
[40:33] might be fulfilled saying he took our
[40:35] infirmities and poor art then Jesus
[40:37] withdrew from there many followed him he
[40:39] healed them and he warned them not to
[40:41] make known in order that it was
[40:43] fulfilled the word spoken through Isaiah
[40:46] the prophet
[40:49] so no I'm not going to quit quoting a
[40:51] prophet
[40:53] if Jesus didn't if Paul didn't if John
[40:56] didn't then I just go go ahead and say
[40:58] any spirit that would try to get me to
[41:00] stop quoting a prophet is from the pits
[41:02] of hell
[41:04] what did Peter say about Acts chapter 2
[41:08] others Malkin said these be full of new
[41:10] wine uh these and Peter standing up
[41:14] saying right bread and Brethren they're
[41:15] not drunk as you suppose see and it's uh
[41:18] you know but the fourth out the third
[41:19] hour of the day but this is that
[41:24] which was spoken by the prophet Joel
[41:30] let me say this to you my brother my
[41:31] sister Satan doesn't hate preachers
[41:38] he don't hate preachers
[41:40] in fact he's got quite a few of them
[41:45] he hates what's being preached
[41:50] so as long as you're palpable and as
[41:53] long as you're stylish as long as you're
[41:56] relative as long as you're in touch
[42:00] as long as you're saying the right
[42:02] things given the right cliches just
[42:05] floating around it you know dancing
[42:07] around it but you never really come out
[42:09] and say as long as Satan doesn't mind
[42:10] that
[42:11] Satan doesn't mind that kind of a gospel
[42:13] in fact it would be Satan himself who
[42:17] would anoint anoint
[42:20] anoint preachers
[42:23] and teachers
[42:27] the Bible says that they would Heap unto
[42:29] themselves it would be Satan it would
[42:32] anoint people's hearts in the last days
[42:35] to Heap the Bible says to Heap
[42:39] to keep unto themselves second Timothy
[42:41] chapter four if you have your Bible turn
[42:43] there and read it with me II Timothy are
[42:45] on the screen chapter 4 verse 1. notice
[42:48] this this from Timothy this is Paul to
[42:52] to Timothy a young preacher and he says
[42:56] I charge Thee I love this
[42:59] I charge thee
[43:03] you know you know
[43:05] Timothy if I was going to give you a
[43:08] piece of advice and you know I mean
[43:10] maybe a good idea let me give you some
[43:12] good wisdom listen friends this ain't
[43:13] what this was
[43:15] this was a commission by the church age
[43:17] messenger to the ministry
[43:21] I charge you
[43:23] in other words I command you
[43:27] Timothy
[43:29] notice how it gets how sober he gets I
[43:32] charge thee before God and the Lord
[43:36] Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick
[43:39] stay alive and the dead it is appearing
[43:43] in his kingdom
[43:44] preach the word
[43:47] be instant in season out of season
[43:49] reproof rebuke
[43:52] make him feel good give them all the
[43:54] feel-good vibes put a coffee shop in so
[43:57] they can drink a latte
[43:59] you know this is just rub them the right
[44:01] way pet them the right way give them all
[44:03] that they want to hear listen friend
[44:05] don't you know that this is the modern
[44:06] church and it's filled up with Millions
[44:09] thousands of people that the music is
[44:11] involved the music is feel good it's all
[44:13] emotional it's sensual or the way that
[44:16] makes you feel it and I came there
[44:17] because I just felt so good and I felt
[44:19] like I could go and face the world and I
[44:21] just felt like all my problems are going
[44:23] to dissolve did you hear about Jesus did
[44:25] he preach about your sins oh no I didn't
[44:27] hear none of that kind of you know down
[44:28] and drowsy weary you know put away that
[44:31] kind of stuff
[44:33] just tell me what I want to hear
[44:36] tell come on friends this is a spirit in
[44:39] this in the last days don't you realize
[44:41] this is the same spirit that tried to
[44:43] anoint the children of Israel when they
[44:46] shut the mouth of Jeremiah and they
[44:48] locked him up and azerai locked him up
[44:50] in a prison and said I don't want to
[44:52] hear your words anymore even Mikea the
[44:55] Bible says that a lion Spirit went out
[44:57] and a lion's Spirit got about it all
[44:59] upon a bunch of preachers listen had I
[45:01] had my chaos been a people pleaser had
[45:04] he been looking for the accolades of men
[45:06] he would have just got another lying
[45:08] Spirit but he said I don't care if you
[45:10] kick me out I don't care if you run me
[45:12] out you may never invite me again I'm
[45:14] gonna preach the word I'm going to give
[45:16] you the truth
[45:21] you know what they said Jeremiah Prophet
[45:24] this is exactly out of the Bible on the
[45:26] radius right right from you right from
[45:27] the Bible
[45:28] prophets prophesy not
[45:34] and Sears
[45:36] Sears C naught
[45:39] it's right out of the word it's a spirit
[45:40] that God on the children of Israel
[45:43] prophets prophesy not
[45:45] Sears don't see
[45:48] in fact this is what they said prophesy
[45:51] unto us
[45:52] good things
[45:56] prophesy unto us things that are
[45:59] appeasing
[46:00] things that we like things that we want
[46:02] to hear prophesying does good tidings
[46:06] just tell us what we want to hear just
[46:07] tell us this is the spirit on the age my
[46:09] brother my sister
[46:12] Paul says preach the word verse 2 be
[46:16] instant in season out of season reprove
[46:18] rebuke but we don't like rebuke but I
[46:21] don't want to be reproved if you're a
[46:23] son or daughter of God you could say if
[46:25] it tears me apart if you give me a good
[46:27] gospel speaking I'll be honest enough to
[46:29] admit it sometimes I need a good
[46:31] spanking spiritually all right I'll put
[46:33] both my hands up for you and my foot I
[46:36] sometimes I need a good gospel spanking
[46:38] sometimes I need to be told the truth
[46:41] sometimes if anybody told you wrong turn
[46:43] around go the other way you made a
[46:44] mistake throw down your pride as the
[46:47] prophet said stomp your pride under your
[46:49] feet and say lord it's not my brother
[46:51] it's not my sister it's me O Lord
[46:53] standing in the need of prayer give me
[46:56] the truth tell me who I am
[47:00] preach the word beings to exhort with
[47:02] all long-suffering and Doctrine for
[47:04] here's a prophecy verse 3 for the time
[47:07] the day the hour the age
[47:11] will come and I'll tell you Apostle Paul
[47:13] it's right here
[47:16] for the time will come when they will
[47:18] not endure sound Doctrine
[47:23] but after their own lusts they'll go to
[47:27] the bar stool they'll go to LSD they'll
[47:30] go to methamphetamine oh this isn't who
[47:32] he's talking about
[47:33] there's more hope for that man on the
[47:36] bar stool than many a people that sits
[47:38] with a suit on in church
[47:41] because the prophet of God said the
[47:42] worst Spirit you can receive is a
[47:44] religious spirit
[47:47] some of the hardest Devils to break is
[47:49] not the alcohol it's not that not the
[47:51] myth it's not the sex it's not the drugs
[47:53] some of the worst hardest Spirits in a
[47:55] man is when the unclean Spirit leaves a
[47:58] man and he goes and gets seven more
[47:59] Spirits uh worse than the first
[48:03] and it becomes religious I'm right you
[48:05] can't tell me nothing
[48:09] that's not my truth might be your truth
[48:12] but it's not my truth
[48:13] I know God I got my own relationship
[48:16] with God I know Jesus for myself I don't
[48:18] doubt you know a Jesus just not the one
[48:21] that I know
[48:23] for the time will come when they will
[48:24] not endure sound Doctrine but after
[48:28] their lusts shall Heap unto themselves
[48:32] teachers
[48:34] having you ever had that you ever had an
[48:36] itchy ear
[48:38] man there's nothing worse because it
[48:41] seems like no matter how much and what
[48:42] you do it's like it's beyond the eardrum
[48:45] it's just there and you can't get rid of
[48:46] it this is the spirit that comes on the
[48:48] people the church the religious people
[48:50] of the last day
[48:52] they shall Heap unto themselves teachers
[48:54] give me what we want to hear just those
[48:57] catch phrases that sound good those
[48:59] cliches listen friends those sound good
[49:02] but they won't set you free
[49:04] there's only one thing that will set you
[49:05] free that's the truth
[49:07] and they shall turn away their ears from
[49:12] the truth
[49:13] and shall be turned into Fables
[49:18] I'm going to read you this out of the
[49:19] message translation not the message but
[49:22] Eugene Peterson's message it's a Bible
[49:25] translation you can get some of it's
[49:27] pretty good I'm going to read it to you
[49:29] right out of the message you're going to
[49:31] find this is second Timothy 4. he's
[49:34] telling Timothy you're going to find
[49:35] that there will be times when people
[49:38] will have no stomach for solid teaching
[49:42] but will fill up on religious junk food
[49:48] opinions that tickle their fancy
[49:53] they'll turn their backs on truth and
[49:57] Chase mirages
[50:00] I love this and he says but you
[50:04] in other words don't matter what
[50:05] everybody else is doing but you
[50:08] keep your eye on what you're doing
[50:10] except the hard times along with the
[50:13] good I'm going to read you right out of
[50:15] what the message translation says you
[50:16] don't believe me you'll get it for
[50:18] yourself I'm going to read it keep the
[50:20] message alive
[50:22] yeah
[50:23] do a thorough God do a thorough job as
[50:27] God's servant and I want to say in a
[50:30] generation where they want spiritual
[50:32] junk food I want honey from The Rock in
[50:35] a day when they just want their appetite
[50:36] and their carnal uh lust uh you know
[50:39] satisfied there's a people Lord that
[50:41] wants your word that says if it cuts me
[50:44] if it hurts me if it hurts my feelings
[50:46] then pray telling me anyway preach to me
[50:49] anyway give me the word Lord
[50:54] give me the word Lord we're out of time
[50:58] and just go can I just go a few more
[50:59] minutes
[51:01] in a world where they don't want the
[51:04] truth and they've homogenized things and
[51:06] they've mixed things
[51:08] and it came to a point to where you know
[51:10] everything's just rationalized and
[51:13] everything's just just as long as it
[51:16] makes sense to me as long as it appeals
[51:19] as long as it appeals to my
[51:21] understanding you know we've gotten to a
[51:24] place to where we've homogenized things
[51:26] and if we're not careful we can
[51:28] homogenize the message and hybrid it
[51:31] I'm gonna read you what brother random
[51:33] says how to Modern events made it clear
[51:34] by prophecy 1965 December 6th we find
[51:38] out Balaam of course he couldn't see
[51:39] went out and looked upon the people said
[51:42] now just a minute we're a great big
[51:45] people up here we're you're just a
[51:47] scattered Bunch you see we all believe
[51:50] the same God
[51:52] we all believe the same this is what he
[51:54] said where all does it come on
[51:57] come on brother matters we don't have to
[52:00] make ourselves so different
[52:02] you know we can sort of mix with them a
[52:04] little bit here and there and you know
[52:06] we believe all the same that's true they
[52:08] all believe the same God
[52:11] brother Brandon says they all worship
[52:12] Jehovah look at balaam's sacrifice
[52:16] look at the sacrifice of Balaam
[52:19] seven altars
[52:22] you think he was spiritual
[52:25] looked good
[52:27] sounded good
[52:28] felt good
[52:31] brother Branham says this away
[52:34] with experiences for measuring the line
[52:38] it's not just because you feel it not
[52:40] just because I declare it not not just
[52:42] not just because let me let me just say
[52:43] this brother the truth is not what I say
[52:46] it is
[52:47] hello
[52:49] the truth is what any preacher says just
[52:51] because I scream and I yell and I get
[52:53] red that don't make what I'm saying true
[52:55] come on
[52:56] doesn't matter how educated I am either
[52:58] if I am I educated intellectually I
[53:00] could draw it all out it all makes sense
[53:02] I know the Greek I know the Hebrew nor
[53:04] the Aramaic no the Hebrew no all the
[53:06] languages and I got it all perfectly put
[53:07] together that don't make it true
[53:11] listen just because I say it's what the
[53:12] Bible says I'm not though I'm not the
[53:15] Arbiter of Truth
[53:17] I'll just go further and say I'm not big
[53:19] because I say it's what the message says
[53:21] just because I say it's what the message
[53:23] is that don't make it what it is
[53:26] what any man tries to say the message of
[53:28] the hour is this and the message is the
[53:30] no brother it says listen friends that
[53:31] doesn't make it what it is
[53:33] who God's Prophet was is not who I say
[53:36] it is it's not who you say it is either
[53:40] he is who the word said he was the word
[53:42] is the limit is limit is cut to the
[53:45] Chase and say it this way the word the
[53:47] truth speaks for itself
[53:51] huh
[53:53] brother Adam says we're all the same
[53:54] look notice what balaam's sacrifice was
[53:56] seven altars and it God's perfect number
[53:59] he's got seven churches he's got seven
[54:01] Rams speaking of of the coming of the
[54:03] Lord fundamentally he was just as
[54:06] fundamental as Moses was
[54:08] but you see there wasn't a divined
[54:11] Vindication they were both Prophets
[54:15] but under Moses's Ministry I love this
[54:18] there was a supernatural Pillar of Fire
[54:21] a light that hung with the camp there
[54:24] was Divine Healing there was a shout of
[54:26] the king in the camp there was Great
[54:28] Signs Divine Healing wonders performed
[54:30] among them it was a sign of a living God
[54:34] among his people
[54:36] fundamentally they was both right and
[54:40] Balaam tried to persuade people and
[54:43] bewitched them into it when just before
[54:47] they reached the Promised Land
[54:51] do you realize what happens just before
[54:53] we reached the promised land of
[54:56] bewitching spirit comes into the church
[55:00] brother Branham says the Antichrist
[55:02] Spirit would come into the church trying
[55:03] to defile it making it lukewarm formal
[55:06] cold and Powerless
[55:09] but the prophet of God says the true
[55:11] church WIll discern and withstand that
[55:14] Antichrist spirit
[55:17] you say how am I going to do it brother
[55:18] Matt the word
[55:21] if there was ever a time to hear the
[55:24] message of God's prophet in your ears
[55:27] it's now
[55:30] if I didn't say anything to you and I
[55:32] might have I might have made a mess of
[55:34] this sermon tonight if I didn't say
[55:35] anything else let me just stop here and
[55:37] say there's never been a greater time
[55:39] for you to hear the voice of vindication
[55:41] and it's not brother Matt it's not a
[55:43] brother down the road it's not a brother
[55:45] down the street listen there was one
[55:47] Ministry that was Vindicated by the
[55:48] pillar of Fire
[55:50] hello
[55:52] and if you ever needed a time to hear
[55:54] that message listen friends the message
[55:56] was not brother branham's message
[55:59] and if all you get it was it was brother
[56:01] Brandon's message then you won't receive
[56:03] what God has for you to receive it was
[56:05] the Angel's message delivered from
[56:07] Heaven to the Earthly messenger and when
[56:10] you hear it you better not hear it just
[56:12] hear you better hear it right here
[56:14] listen friend it wasn't John John didn't
[56:16] write the book of Revel John's Book of
[56:18] Revelation is not John's book
[56:22] the Revelation let me read it to you of
[56:25] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him and
[56:28] he delivered it to his servant John what
[56:30] was John he was just the Scribe he was
[56:34] just the one writing it down the prophet
[56:36] was just a eunuch he didn't have any
[56:38] thought of his own it wasn't his message
[56:40] he was just the Mailman but the message
[56:42] came from the throne it came from above
[56:45] it came to the down to the Earth to give
[56:47] to be given to a people who could
[56:49] believe it who wouldn't question it who
[56:52] wouldn't doubt it but say I accepted
[56:54] Lord just the way it was spoken I accept
[56:57] it
[56:59] wasn't his message
[57:03] do you realize when you tamper with the
[57:06] message you're not tampering with a
[57:08] message from a Kentucky hillbilly
[57:13] you're tampering with the same angel
[57:14] that came to Moses that came to Joshua
[57:17] that came to Paul
[57:21] it wasn't his message he was just the
[57:25] messenger
[57:27] and so many people get messed up and
[57:29] messed up on on the messenger it's not
[57:31] the messenger that I'm worshiping it's
[57:34] the message
[57:35] it's not the messenger that I receive I
[57:38] receive the message listen friends you
[57:40] can't separate the message in the
[57:41] messenger
[57:42] you can't such oh come on Lord I'm just
[57:44] going to go ahead and say it people will
[57:46] try to separate the Bible in the message
[57:48] that's an antichrist Spirit that'll take
[57:50] you down a road of defilement
[57:51] lukewarmness and coldness
[57:54] you try to separate the Bible from the
[57:56] message I'll hold the Bible here and the
[57:57] message is here and I always put the
[57:59] Bible here because the Bible listen
[58:01] friends what do you think the Bible was
[58:02] it was a it was God breathed
[58:05] God moved and inspired men to write it
[58:08] down
[58:09] and so listen this wasn't brother
[58:11] Brandon's message I don't know why I'm
[58:13] here but I'm here and I'm going to keep
[58:14] on preaching wasn't brother Brandon's
[58:16] message it was a message from the angel
[58:19] this is Aaron brother Brandon say it and
[58:21] today go read early experiences and
[58:23] listen to how the angel came to me and
[58:25] brother Brandon said if I had a hundred
[58:27] Angels standing in front of me I could
[58:29] identify that one Angel who came to me
[58:32] if I heard the voices of a hundred other
[58:35] angels I could tell you that one's voice
[58:38] I can see him he says he's got his hands
[58:40] like this dark complexion you think
[58:42] brother Brandon you think brother
[58:43] Brandon as the prophet of God said he
[58:46] said I could hear him there oh my knees
[58:47] and he said I heard him coming up the
[58:49] stairs walking through the house and he
[58:51] said that light that Whirlwind that came
[58:54] what was it it was an angel a signifying
[58:58] angel
[59:01] brother Madam says notice what they say
[59:03] fundamentally that was that was both
[59:05] right and he Bewitched them into it just
[59:08] before they reached the Promised Land
[59:11] let me just go ahead and say to you
[59:12] friends your intellectual mind will
[59:14] always reason and try to rationalize and
[59:18] try to make sense of and try to deduct
[59:20] and try to gotta make sense to me that's
[59:23] a spirit from your carnal mind not your
[59:25] spiritual mind the spiritual mind
[59:27] believes the word
[59:29] it doesn't matter if you understand it
[59:31] or not like the man said to the boy man
[59:33] are you crazy you really believe Jonah
[59:35] was swallowed by by a whale you really
[59:39] believe that little boy gave him a good
[59:40] answer so they listen to me buddy I
[59:42] believe it if it said Jonah swallowed a
[59:44] well I don't care what the Bible says I
[59:46] believe the word of God I'm not going to
[59:48] doubt the word of God I'm going to
[59:50] question the word of God I hear the
[59:52] voice of God when I read the word of God
[59:54] when I hear the word of God it's not the
[59:56] words of man it's the words from Jehovah
[1:00:01] your carnal mind will always try to
[1:00:03] reason it rationalize it make sense of
[1:00:05] it but let me just say this truth is the
[1:00:08] only thing you need that will set you
[1:00:09] free
[1:00:10] it is the absolute it is the boundaries
[1:00:14] it is how everything in my life I just
[1:00:17] testifies measured is what the truth
[1:00:20] says
[1:00:22] not what a scholar says come on Friends
[1:00:25] not what a person says not what anybody
[1:00:28] tells me
[1:00:30] but what the word of God says
[1:00:33] I'm going to close I'm going to close
[1:00:34] all right as brother Diggs says don't
[1:00:36] get scared
[1:00:40] The Voice of Truth speaks
[1:00:44] it's not in a human dialect
[1:00:47] it can't be understood by it understood
[1:00:49] by human intellect I could try my best
[1:00:51] to get you to understand it I could
[1:00:53] teach it I could you could even
[1:00:54] intellectually understand my teaching
[1:00:55] you can say aha I see it oh it all makes
[1:00:58] sense now I get it two plus two equals
[1:01:00] four and a lot of people have this kind
[1:01:02] of understanding of the message they
[1:01:04] understand serpency they understand uh
[1:01:06] predestination they they understand
[1:01:08] these things intellectually but listen
[1:01:10] friends it takes God to reveal it to you
[1:01:13] and only God can do that to give you a
[1:01:16] personal revelation that's why the
[1:01:18] prophet said if you could pray for
[1:01:19] anything say God give me Revelation
[1:01:23] for with Revelation in my life the gates
[1:01:26] of hell can't Prevail against me but
[1:01:28] I'll Prevail against them can you say
[1:01:29] Amen to the word tonight
[1:01:31] God is a god of truth it's a it's it's a
[1:01:34] it's a it's a message of truth it's a
[1:01:37] message it's a Voice of Truth
[1:01:42] and it can't be rationalized it's not to
[1:01:45] be rash that's why rationalism says it's
[1:01:47] only if I understand if I understand it
[1:01:49] then I can believe it you've really came
[1:01:51] really short sold yourself short of all
[1:01:53] you can believe is what you see and what
[1:01:56] you understand
[1:01:57] heard a man say that at a funeral and he
[1:02:00] said you know he said it'd be so not
[1:02:01] believing in things you can't see be
[1:02:03] like being in a boat in the ocean and
[1:02:05] looking as far as you can see to that
[1:02:06] Horizon and saying you know what that's
[1:02:08] all there is
[1:02:09] that's all there is that's all there is
[1:02:11] because that's all I can see there's
[1:02:12] nothing beyond that just take that boat
[1:02:14] a little bit further and you realize
[1:02:15] that was just your horizon of what you
[1:02:17] thought all there was
[1:02:18] there's much more Beyond this
[1:02:22] as brother Brandon says old friends if I
[1:02:24] can just tell you there's a world
[1:02:26] waiting when you breathe your last
[1:02:28] breath
[1:02:30] it's a world of reality it's a world of
[1:02:33] truth it's a world where there's no fear
[1:02:36] oh how many want that it's a world where
[1:02:38] there's no stress there's no anxiety
[1:02:40] there's no trouble there's no pressure
[1:02:42] oh I'm just going to raise my hand and
[1:02:44] say Lord I desire that I believe I can
[1:02:46] have that here on Earth I believe I can
[1:02:48] have a piece of heaven you say brother
[1:02:50] Matt how do I get that place where
[1:02:52] there's no anxiety where there's no
[1:02:53] questions where there's no more doubts
[1:02:55] where there's no more fears where
[1:02:56] there's no more words let me just tell
[1:02:58] you what you got to do is just unplug
[1:03:00] your cord from this world
[1:03:02] and start plugging into the word of God
[1:03:05] and receive from that word a message of
[1:03:07] truth that will tell you who you are who
[1:03:09] you really are where you really came
[1:03:11] from and where you're really going
[1:03:14] in a world of fear and anxiety and
[1:03:17] trouble and and struggle I'm so glad
[1:03:21] in my life I'm so glad I've got
[1:03:24] something that can tell me when I'm
[1:03:25] questioning them when I'm doubting when
[1:03:27] I'm worried and when I'm fearful I'm
[1:03:28] saying brother Matt do you get that way
[1:03:30] oh my brother and my sister we live in a
[1:03:33] world where if we're not careful we
[1:03:35] ingest some of those very same things
[1:03:39] and we're filled with the world of Doubt
[1:03:41] criticism
[1:03:42] and critics and Skeptics and skepticism
[1:03:47] brother random says in the message the
[1:03:49] seventh seal I'm going to close right
[1:03:50] here I went to a man not long ago he
[1:03:52] come to me rather he'd been arguing all
[1:03:55] around everywhere against Divine Healing
[1:03:56] and he come up and he said I don't
[1:03:58] believe in Your Divine Healing
[1:04:01] I said Ma I guess it wouldn't be any
[1:04:04] good because I ain't got any
[1:04:10] brother man who says but God's perfect
[1:04:12] he said there's no such a thing I said a
[1:04:15] year too late to say that buddy you've
[1:04:18] done waited too long for that you might
[1:04:20] have argued with me a few years ago but
[1:04:23] there's another age coming on now
[1:04:24] there's Millions to testify I said
[1:04:26] you're too late for that now fella he
[1:04:29] said well I don't believe it I don't
[1:04:31] care what you do I said certainly
[1:04:34] you can't
[1:04:36] you see he said smite me blind if you
[1:04:39] got the Holy Ghost like Paul smite me
[1:04:42] blind brother Madam said how can I
[1:04:44] you're already blind
[1:04:48] your father has blinded you to the truth
[1:04:52] and you're already blind he said I
[1:04:54] wouldn't believe it I don't care what
[1:04:56] you can do how much evidence you could
[1:04:58] prove or anything like that I still
[1:05:01] don't believe it I said certainly it
[1:05:04] wasn't for believers for unbelievers it
[1:05:06] was only for believers
[1:05:11] well what was it
[1:05:13] brother Brandon says see
[1:05:16] you know right then the election's off
[1:05:19] just don't fool with it at all
[1:05:23] if we're not careful we get to a place
[1:05:24] to where we argue and argue and argue
[1:05:26] and argue and argue
[1:05:28] you know God's Prophet wouldn't argue
[1:05:31] even with a man Dr best who tried to get
[1:05:33] him to come to a debate and brother
[1:05:34] Branham Holy Spirit told him he could go
[1:05:36] to the meeting but not to get up and say
[1:05:37] anything and so so it's brother uh uh uh
[1:05:41] uh forget the brother's name at this
[1:05:43] time but they're that brother is is you
[1:05:45] know is debating with with this man Dr
[1:05:47] best but brother Branham wouldn't
[1:05:49] brother Bosworth
[1:05:51] and brother Brandon Whitney we got to a
[1:05:53] place to where we can argue and if
[1:05:54] listen friends brother Mike don't have
[1:05:56] the choir before you but he talks about
[1:05:57] the church how they became powerless and
[1:06:00] and he said the only thing they had was
[1:06:01] the power of argument
[1:06:04] we're not careful we let the devil get
[1:06:06] into us into a corner to where we got to
[1:06:08] argue everything
[1:06:10] come on somebody
[1:06:12] we gotta argue with everything because
[1:06:14] you know we we got to have a quest we
[1:06:16] got to have an answer to every man right
[1:06:18] you know doesn't the Bible say to be
[1:06:20] ready to give an answer you know to
[1:06:22] every man about the hope that lies
[1:06:25] within you listen don't let the devil
[1:06:26] pervert that scripture that doesn't mean
[1:06:28] that you have to answer every question
[1:06:31] even the Paul possible right after that
[1:06:33] would say foolish and unlearned
[1:06:35] questions don't even give a reply to
[1:06:39] I'm just going to go ahead and say it
[1:06:41] you don't need to research this message
[1:06:44] it's already been Vindicated
[1:06:48] I'm going to say that again you don't
[1:06:50] need to research the message it's
[1:06:52] already been Vindicated I say like the
[1:06:54] like brother Brandon said you come too
[1:06:56] late for that buddy I've already got
[1:06:58] something in my heart I like the blind
[1:07:00] man said how Jack what happened I don't
[1:07:03] know all I know is I once was blind and
[1:07:05] now I can see I once was lost but now I
[1:07:08] am failed it's already been revealed to
[1:07:11] me
[1:07:12] you don't need to you don't need to
[1:07:14] research it young people I mean just go
[1:07:16] in and tell you no more than I need to
[1:07:18] research the Bible
[1:07:21] you better research it brother you
[1:07:23] better look at all the texts brother
[1:07:25] Matt you better study those manuscripts
[1:07:26] Aleppo codex and the masoretic text and
[1:07:29] you better listen I love those kind of
[1:07:31] things
[1:07:31] but that ain't where my faith comes from
[1:07:35] my faith isn't in the written word
[1:07:37] because the what the Bible says the
[1:07:39] letter Kenneth but the spirit giveth
[1:07:41] life you better so you better understand
[1:07:43] it better on intellectually understand
[1:07:44] all the manuscripts and text you you
[1:07:46] know where that came from came from the
[1:07:48] pits of hell it came from intellectual
[1:07:50] men trying to approach a supernatural
[1:07:52] God
[1:07:53] and now you have textual criticism you
[1:07:55] have textual variants and there's
[1:07:56] different translations and Mark 16 was
[1:07:59] that listen friends you don't need to
[1:08:00] question you don't need to answer the
[1:08:03] questions of unbelievers I give it to
[1:08:05] you like I'm my good buddy a brother
[1:08:07] Wayne Lawson says those are not my
[1:08:09] questions
[1:08:12] thank you brother Wayne those are not my
[1:08:14] questions so why would I try to answer
[1:08:16] them
[1:08:20] don't try to answer the questions of
[1:08:23] unbelievers because they're coming from
[1:08:26] a position of unbelief
[1:08:30] they are asked from a position of
[1:08:32] Revelation they're asked
[1:08:34] brother Matt why are you going down here
[1:08:36] well you see when I signed up for this I
[1:08:38] said Lord I'm your servant
[1:08:41] and I'll just say what you want me to
[1:08:43] say
[1:08:45] they're not my questions
[1:08:47] I don't need to answer the questions of
[1:08:49] an atheist
[1:08:51] they're not my questions
[1:08:53] it's a perversion of scripture to say we
[1:08:55] need to have an answer to every man
[1:08:58] that's not what first Peter is it first
[1:08:59] Peter I think First Peter chapter three
[1:09:00] it's not about First Peter chapter 3
[1:09:02] saying
[1:09:04] but that that's not what the Bible said
[1:09:06] I could give you the example after
[1:09:07] example after example in the book of
[1:09:09] Acts how they answered their questions
[1:09:11] how pal the how the church the first
[1:09:13] church listen friends what you'll find
[1:09:15] is you won't find an example of Peter or
[1:09:18] John becoming Scholars and debating with
[1:09:22] Scholars on a scholarly level you won't
[1:09:24] find that in the Bible
[1:09:26] come on friends give me the support
[1:09:28] you won't find them getting a chalkboard
[1:09:30] and saying you know I'm gonna lay it all
[1:09:32] out you know what because that's not how
[1:09:33] the church started what does the book of
[1:09:35] Galatians say oh you foolish Galatians
[1:09:37] you having begun in the spirit are now
[1:09:39] going to be perfected by the flesh
[1:09:42] it was a spiritual work that started
[1:09:44] it's got to be a spiritual work that
[1:09:46] finishes it it was a red church built on
[1:09:49] Revelation it was a church built on the
[1:09:51] unexplainable that it's got to be the
[1:09:53] unexplainable and Revelation that
[1:09:55] finishes the work that the church
[1:09:57] started on Jesus came to Peter didn't
[1:09:59] say hey buddy you know there is Peter
[1:10:01] with his net and he's throwing it out
[1:10:03] and John and they're casting there and
[1:10:04] Jesus says hey uh hey uh excuse me uh
[1:10:08] sir uh sir can I have just a minute of
[1:10:10] your attention and Peter you know sort
[1:10:12] of look God took his net and what you
[1:10:15] got to say buddy well uh Jesus would say
[1:10:18] uh well can I show you in the book of
[1:10:20] Isaiah let me just got one minute let me
[1:10:23] come here and Peter looks over there
[1:10:24] okay what you got look over here right
[1:10:26] here in the book of Isaiah you know it
[1:10:28] says that you know Behold a virgin shall
[1:10:30] conceive and and that his name shall be
[1:10:32] called and over here in the book of
[1:10:34] Jeremiah you see this text over here and
[1:10:36] Peter said oh okay I I think I I think I
[1:10:39] see where you're coming from
[1:10:41] you know I can I I think I can
[1:10:43] rationalize it well now what does it say
[1:10:45] over here in the book of of uh of Isaiah
[1:10:47] okay yeah and Jesus says well see see
[1:10:49] over here and lines up over here and
[1:10:51] then I'm saying you know what and you
[1:10:54] know that he'll come right on don't get
[1:10:55] the photo of an ass and I just came in
[1:10:56] in Jerusalem and all those things make
[1:10:58] sense they all line up see it see it in
[1:10:59] scripture see it
[1:11:01] and then Peter goes you know
[1:11:04] let me go back to my pastor let me study
[1:11:06] that for a week and let me get back to
[1:11:08] you
[1:11:09] is that how Jesus started his church let
[1:11:12] me tell you actually how he started it
[1:11:14] the Bible says he walked up to him and
[1:11:17] he spoke words come follow me
[1:11:21] and the Bible says immediately they
[1:11:23] dropped their Nets and they followed him
[1:11:25] why because my sheep know my voice and a
[1:11:29] stranger they will not follow I hear the
[1:11:31] voice of my shepherd and the voice of my
[1:11:34] shepherd and is speaking to me when I
[1:11:36] hear the word of God it's not the voice
[1:11:38] of intellect it's the voice of God
[1:11:40] spoken to my soul it's not my mind that
[1:11:44] understands it it's my soul it says amen
[1:11:47] Lord I believe it Lord yes that's
[1:11:49] nothing but the truth Lord Jesus
[1:11:54] you'll never find Paul you never find
[1:11:56] John
[1:11:57] intellectually arguing with carnal men
[1:12:00] on the contrary you will find them
[1:12:03] simply quoting the word
[1:12:08] and if there's a seed
[1:12:10] that seed will hear that voice
[1:12:14] and if there's not
[1:12:16] they won't argue
[1:12:20] but the modern churches so analyzed the
[1:12:22] Bible so analyze scripture from a
[1:12:26] scientific approach
[1:12:28] that when they're done I'm talking to
[1:12:29] you about church religion two-thirds of
[1:12:32] Christian theologians is what I'm
[1:12:33] talking about may shock you it may shock
[1:12:36] you to learn that
[1:12:37] that there's a mass of Scholars of Bible
[1:12:40] scholars men who get up by and pulpits
[1:12:42] and preach that don't believe the Book
[1:12:44] of Revelation should have been in the
[1:12:46] Bible
[1:12:46] that don't believe Daniel remember the
[1:12:48] Andrew we're just talking about it that
[1:12:50] don't believe Daniel was actually
[1:12:51] written at the time of Daniel but it was
[1:12:53] added later because of how specifically
[1:12:56] he prophesied about Antiochus epiphanies
[1:12:58] and about the different Empires that
[1:13:00] would raise up so they say it's
[1:13:01] impossible it's it's too Supernatural
[1:13:03] for us it's got to be added later I'm
[1:13:06] talking about not atheists these are
[1:13:07] Christian men's Christian Scholars who
[1:13:09] believe this
[1:13:10] How Could You Believe in a god I'd throw
[1:13:12] the Bible out if I believe that
[1:13:14] right I'll just be honest
[1:13:16] heard a Christian scholar say that the
[1:13:18] other day about Sodom and Gomorrah he
[1:13:19] was thankful they found the cities of
[1:13:21] Sodom and gomor I'm not going to go into
[1:13:22] that but he made a comment he said you
[1:13:24] know to be honest with you and not
[1:13:25] Christian faith I always just looked at
[1:13:27] Sodom as a mythical part of the Bible I
[1:13:29] thought a mythical
[1:13:32] did you just say that
[1:13:34] a mythical you know what they found the
[1:13:36] pilot Stone we were just in Israel and
[1:13:38] seen it that the inscription did you
[1:13:40] know that before the 50s or 60s whenever
[1:13:42] that stone was found
[1:13:43] the most Christian Scholars men who get
[1:13:46] up Dallas Theological Seminary trained
[1:13:48] would intellectually tell you that
[1:13:50] they've deducted a reason to rationalize
[1:13:53] the Pontius Pilate actually never
[1:13:55] existed that that was added to the Bible
[1:13:56] there was a man but his name wasn't
[1:13:58] Pontius Pilate they just made it up
[1:14:02] you know what happened in the 60s they
[1:14:04] found the pilot Stone and on that stone
[1:14:06] is Pontius Pilate and guess what all the
[1:14:09] scholars said ah we were wrong there
[1:14:10] actually was a man named Pontius Pilate
[1:14:12] note I said I'm so glad long before they
[1:14:15] found the stone I believe there was a
[1:14:17] man named Partners pilot long before men
[1:14:20] have their intellectual answers there's
[1:14:22] a Believer down inside of me that says I
[1:14:24] believe it Lord I accepted just the way
[1:14:27] you spoke it
[1:14:29] they've analyzed scripture from a
[1:14:31] scientific approach and when they're
[1:14:32] done Mark 16 was added
[1:14:35] the woman at the well was added later
[1:14:37] there's mythical parts of the Bible
[1:14:40] they Chuck on anything that seems
[1:14:42] unreasonable to believe that anything
[1:14:44] that their carnal mind can't understand
[1:14:46] they call it poetry allegorical
[1:14:49] they have textual variants and textual
[1:14:51] criticism and eschatology and
[1:14:53] hermeneutics and apologetics
[1:14:57] and you know what it does it strips the
[1:14:59] power right out of the church
[1:15:03] let me say this the supernatural Church
[1:15:05] doesn't need an explanation God
[1:15:07] interprets his word by bringing it to
[1:15:10] pass she has the word hallelujah
[1:15:13] demonstrated that's my answer you say
[1:15:16] what's your answer to the critic the
[1:15:17] word of God Has Changed Me from who I
[1:15:20] was from a creature of carnal carnality
[1:15:23] and sin and now I long for the word of
[1:15:24] God how do you know the message is true
[1:15:26] because it's transformed my whole life
[1:15:30] [Music]
[1:15:31] took a backslidden boy and to turn him
[1:15:34] into all kinds of heinous kind of things
[1:15:37] and sinful kind of things and took the
[1:15:39] desire for sin out of my life
[1:15:44] she has the word
[1:15:46] demonstrated and that's her answer
[1:15:51] you can't explain God for instance these
[1:15:53] musicians could you come if you don't
[1:15:54] I'm just going to keep on preaching
[1:15:57] musicians come if you you can't explain
[1:15:59] God
[1:16:03] you try to take a naturalistic approach
[1:16:05] to satisfy a carnal mind what you'll
[1:16:06] come up with this is a make-believer
[1:16:09] you try to take a naturalistic approach
[1:16:11] to the message trying to satisfy the
[1:16:13] carnal mind what you'll come up with as
[1:16:14] a make-believer
[1:16:16] it's the defense given to Skeptics I'm
[1:16:20] reading to you what apologetics are
[1:16:23] right out of Google so forgive Google
[1:16:24] forgive me for using it
[1:16:28] I'm going to read you exactly what
[1:16:29] apologetics are it's the defense
[1:16:32] of the Gospel given to Skeptics
[1:16:37] I'm gonna read into it's the pre it's
[1:16:39] all about the presentation of the Gospel
[1:16:42] they believe every Christian should be
[1:16:44] able to give an adequate presentation
[1:16:46] of why they have faith in Christ listen
[1:16:48] to me I'm just going to go ahead and
[1:16:49] preach it like I believe it the world
[1:16:51] does not need a presentation it doesn't
[1:16:53] need an explanation it needs a
[1:16:55] demonstration
[1:16:57] it needs a revelation
[1:16:59] can you say man that's the only thing
[1:17:01] I'm just going to rhyme it that brings
[1:17:03] transformation
[1:17:05] I love it give me a demonstration that
[1:17:07] will bring Revelation that takes away
[1:17:09] all my explanations that will bring a
[1:17:11] transformation to my life that'll one
[1:17:14] day produce a translation brother Bernie
[1:17:16] one day it'll change this body this word
[1:17:18] that I'm feeding on will one day change
[1:17:20] my very being it'll change me from
[1:17:23] corruptable to incorruptable it'll
[1:17:25] change me from carnal to to Mortal to
[1:17:28] immortality how many want to say Lord I
[1:17:30] want to be changed I want the word that
[1:17:32] I feed upon stand to stand to your feet
[1:17:34] raise those hands and say Lord I believe
[1:17:37] the word I don't doubt the word raise a
[1:17:39] hand say Lord I believe the word
