[0:00] we've mentioned previously last couple
[0:02] Services we're ministering on the
[0:04] subject of the house of the Lord and
[0:07] there's a lot of different things that
[0:08] we could note in this a lot of ways that
[0:10] we could take and so we're just going to
[0:11] take our time service by service to look
[0:13] at a few of these things and uh tonight
[0:17] our title is in particular a home with
[0:19] three rooms U those that are students of
[0:22] the message probably going to get way
[0:24] ahead of me uh but we're just going to
[0:25] call it tonight the a home with three
[0:28] rooms as we've been looking at psalms 27
[0:31] a lot of Rich principles in that that we
[0:32] could gather from um lovely thoughts and
[0:35] precepts even the entire chapter just
[0:37] ministers to us so much but in Psalms
[0:39] chapter 27:4 David is speaking of this
[0:42] one thing that he desired and that one
[0:44] thing desired he would seek after and he
[0:47] uses this language that I may dwell in
[0:49] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[0:51] life and to behold the beauty of the
[0:53] Lord to inquire in his Temple he's using
[0:56] a very specific language and it paints a
[0:58] beautiful picture and it actually kind
[1:01] of sets before us a lot of images and
[1:03] characteristics of the house of the Lord
[1:05] that if it's going to be the house of
[1:06] the Lord it has to be a place of his
[1:08] Beauty if it's the house of the Lord
[1:09] It's a place to inquire a place to seek
[1:11] and so there's a lot of things in that
[1:14] and one of the things that we've tried
[1:15] to emphasize even from David's longing
[1:18] is it was a place that he desired Above
[1:20] All Else and so that makes it a really
[1:22] remarkable place if he wanted to be
[1:24] somewhere like oh there's no place like
[1:26] home and he'd want to be home or there's
[1:28] no place like Bethlehem there's no place
[1:30] like this no he said I want to be in the
[1:32] house of the Lord and as we just try to
[1:36] maybe just bite some pieces off just
[1:38] little by little instead of just you
[1:40] know maybe trying to drill down on one
[1:42] piece but just take different pieces
[1:44] here and there the the temple itself
[1:47] told the tells the story of redemption
[1:50] that you you look at and its elements
[1:51] and all its fixtures and all its
[1:53] amenities and the way that God designed
[1:55] it it's telling a story and God intended
[1:58] it that way it's not just beautiful
[1:59] beautiful in itself though it is it but
[2:01] there's more to it just like the heavens
[2:03] we look at the heavens and we're in awe
[2:05] of how great it is and how vast it is
[2:07] but God's using it to tell a story and
[2:10] so the Tabernacle and the temple tell
[2:13] the story of redemption so it itself
[2:16] represents something even greater than
[2:18] itself uh it holds a pattern that's
[2:21] instructive to us today as we've even
[2:23] mentioned on Sunday that the the house
[2:26] of the Lord was not in heaven it was in
[2:27] a very specific place and well where do
[2:29] we seek it now where do we find the
[2:31] house of the Lord and kind of what I'm
[2:33] tracking is that we can look back at the
[2:35] the house of the Lord in the Old
[2:37] Testament and it's pointing us to where
[2:38] the house of the Lord can be found
[2:40] today now in Exodus 25:
[2:44] 8-9 I think my throat kind of caught
[2:47] with some other people I hung out with
[2:48] Brother John too long and I'm mimicking
[2:50] his voice tonight but no just different
[2:52] ones I know some people are at home
[2:53] tonight we got noticed that they weren't
[2:55] feeling well and um I know some people
[2:57] have just lost their voice and so if I
[2:59] feel a little little rough tonight just
[3:01] thank God your pastor finally sounds
[3:03] like a
[3:04] preacher and if I get going I'll really
[3:06] sound like man he's really saying
[3:08] something tonight and it'll sound good
[3:12] so in Exodus chapter
[3:13] 25 and uh again I apologize if some of
[3:16] the slides aren't there I again I was
[3:18] taking some things out this afternoon
[3:20] just to consolidate and hold some things
[3:22] over to Sunday but in Exodus chapter 25:
[3:25] 8-9 it says and let them make me a
[3:28] sanctuary and now God speaking that I
[3:32] may dwell among them this is the purpose
[3:34] of this edifice this is the purpose of
[3:36] the the Tabernacle according to all that
[3:38] I show thee after the pattern of the
[3:41] Tabernacle and the pattern of all the
[3:43] instruments thereof even so shall you
[3:46] make it we know in the New Testament
[3:48] Paul picks up a similar language saying
[3:49] these things these sacrifices and all
[3:51] these things related to the Levites and
[3:54] their Ministry and the temple was uh
[3:56] pointing to something it was a pattern
[3:57] it was foreshadowing and here God says
[4:00] according to the things that I show you
[4:02] and the pattern I show you build this
[4:04] place he calls it a sanctuary that I may
[4:07] dwell among you even the phrase
[4:09] Sanctuary means a sacred place and so
[4:12] this was a place so that God could live
[4:15] among Israel catch that that that
[4:17] meaning he said he just doesn't say well
[4:19] I'll be amongst you in the trees and
[4:22] I'll be with you in the Sun and I'll be
[4:24] with you and kind of like this um
[4:27] ancient way we think sometimes of like
[4:29] an inner or living force that people
[4:31] ascribe to Mother Nature and just even
[4:33] our bodies it was beyond that very
[4:35] specific place with a very specific
[4:37] blueprint and arrangements for God to
[4:39] live among Israel and it's that I may
[4:42] dwell it was a dwelling place so God
[4:44] said I'm going to make this where I live
[4:47] if God was to get an ID there in in
[4:49] Israel this was the address it would be
[4:51] at it was it was something very specific
[4:54] and then in Revelations 11: 19 it says
[4:57] and the temple of God was opened in
[4:59] heaven and I would say that you have to
[5:01] look at this is not just um Heaven
[5:05] opening up but it says that something in
[5:08] heaven something in heaven is opened the
[5:11] temple of God was opened in heaven so
[5:13] we're not just viewing into heaven but
[5:14] something in heaven opens and there was
[5:17] seen in his Temple the Ark of his
[5:19] Testament so there's Heaven John has
[5:21] already entered into heaven now within
[5:23] in heaven there's the temple of God that
[5:25] opens up so there's something in heaven
[5:27] that opens and he says he see in his
[5:30] Temple the Ark of his Testament there's
[5:32] the Ark of the Covenant and there were
[5:34] Lightnings and voices and thunderings
[5:36] and an earthquake and a great hail and
[5:39] it's not uh hail is in Hil to the
[5:41] victors it's actually like a hail storm
[5:43] but this is opened up in heaven the
[5:45] temple of God has open in heaven the
[5:47] temple and the Ark of his Testament and
[5:49] then with it with this opening there's
[5:50] Lightnings and voices and thunderings
[5:52] and an earthquake and a hell storm so
[5:54] these are all elements now that we can
[5:56] begin to see that are recognized when
[5:58] something like this is opened up and for
[6:00] some of you who like kind of stra
[6:02] scratch your message the theology itch
[6:05] there's a lot there to feed on a little
[6:07] bit and so we see again what Moses saw
[6:10] in heaven with the pattern we see this
[6:13] image in heaven it says the temple of
[6:15] God opened in heaven and then there's a
[6:17] tabernacle that's being built on Earth
[6:19] as we read in Exodus
[6:21] 25 now if you turn to Exodus excuse me
[6:23] acts
[6:25] 7: 44-
[6:27] 49 uh this is uh this will bring
[6:30] together a lot of thoughts for us in one
[6:33] place it says our fathers had the
[6:37] Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness
[6:39] as he appointed speaking unto Moses that
[6:42] he should make it according to the
[6:43] fashion that he had seen you see how
[6:46] that's almost
[6:47] specifically uh I would say word for
[6:50] word but it's paraphrasing and repeating
[6:52] what we even read in Exodus 25 which
[6:54] also our fathers that came after brought
[6:57] in with Jesus and that might cause some
[7:01] of you to think wait a minute what's
[7:02] going on here but this is we know the
[7:04] Greek for Jesus is Jo or for Joshua is
[7:07] Jesus and so that was brought in with
[7:09] Joshua into the possession of the
[7:11] Gentiles whom God drave out before the
[7:14] face of our fathers under the days of
[7:16] David so there's the image of the
[7:18] Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness
[7:21] that Moses had seen in heaven he made a
[7:24] representation on Earth and then the Ark
[7:26] of the Covenant was carried into Israel
[7:28] by Jos UA into the land of the
[7:30] Philistines and the Gentiles and that
[7:33] the Lord was going to give them as a
[7:34] possession and the Ark remained there
[7:36] until the days of David so you can see
[7:38] the story that's being told just a great
[7:40] overview for us then David verse 46 who
[7:43] found favor before God and desired to
[7:46] find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob
[7:49] so there is the Tabernacle of witness in
[7:52] the wilderness that would would have
[7:54] housed the Ark of the Covenant now David
[7:56] looks at this and says I want there to
[7:59] be a tabernacle for God I I more than
[8:02] just this Tabernacle of witness but I
[8:05] want I want a tabernacle for God verse
[8:07] 47 but Solomon built him a house that's
[8:10] not saying that David desired one thing
[8:12] and Solomon built something else David
[8:14] desired to build it but it's Solomon
[8:16] that built it David desired a house for
[8:18] God a permanent dwelling and it's
[8:20] Solomon that builds it and then this uh
[8:24] reciting of even what is said in Isaiah
[8:26] how be it the most high dwelleth not in
[8:28] temples made with hands now this is uh
[8:34] maybe a perplexing statement considering
[8:36] all the history we're given and the
[8:38] language that we have ascribed to it
[8:40] that make me a place so I can dwell
[8:42] among you so I can live among you and
[8:44] and what David desired with Solomon bill
[8:46] but now it's like God doesn't dwell in
[8:48] temples made with
[8:49] hands but he did didn't he so it's not
[8:53] it's it's not a statement of
[8:54] contradiction it's more a statement of
[8:56] what God's ultimate purpose and desire
[8:58] was and what he longed for and it says
[9:01] that as it says Heaven is my throne and
[9:04] Earth is my foot stol and it it's
[9:06] basically saying that nothing can
[9:08] contain God
[9:09] adequately and what house will ye build
[9:12] me if I if I'm not made to dwell in
[9:15] temples that are made by hands if I'm
[9:17] not I don't dwell in temples made with
[9:19] hands but what house will you build me
[9:21] sayi the Lord or what is the place of my
[9:25] rest wonderfully thought-provoking
[9:28] statements and question about God and
[9:30] his character what he values and what
[9:31] he's looking for was it was it just a
[9:34] tent was it just an address was it a
[9:36] place that he keep identified with or
[9:37] was there something in the heart of God
[9:39] that he's longing for that is being
[9:42] represented in these things as we asked
[9:44] on Sunday where is the house of the Lord
[9:46] today and maybe there's some of us that
[9:48] would like to say it's right here 3736
[9:50] West Walla right like this is this is
[9:52] the house of the Lord but uh that
[9:54] wouldn't really satisfy right because
[9:57] this is a house of worship and this is a
[9:58] church a local church and we feel that
[10:00] we're part of this body Where We Gather
[10:02] and it's it represents something and we
[10:04] could call it the house of the Lord we
[10:05] could call it a House of Prayer a house
[10:07] of worship h h a house of correction and
[10:10] all those different things but even this
[10:12] is only pointing to something greater it
[10:15] represents even something Beyond this is
[10:18] not the ultimate and I know I keep
[10:19] reminding you of that not that it would
[10:20] tip the other way and I don't see you
[10:22] anymore but this is definitely not the
[10:24] ultimate but we lift up the ultimate
[10:27] here now as we're reading inight chapter
[10:29] 7 you'll find that there is a transition
[10:33] from Tabernacle to Temple and I'm hoping
[10:36] tonight to uh remind you of things that
[10:39] we already know but maybe get real
[10:40] strict in our language so that we could
[10:42] understand these different elements and
[10:45] initially he calls it in verse 44 the
[10:46] Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness
[10:48] the Tabernacle was the sacred tent of
[10:51] Jehovah it was in many ways just a tent
[10:53] and that literally a tent but it's
[10:55] called a tabernacle of witness or
[10:57] testimony it is Jehovah's tent of
[11:00] testimony and as I study these things
[11:03] and lay these things in there you'll
[11:04] find uh it's because of these elements
[11:07] and these things that God is expressing
[11:08] in Jehovah's ttin of testimony that God
[11:11] even in this end time and in brother
[11:13] bram's Ministry he gave him a vision
[11:15] which contained three different parts
[11:17] and the third part was represented of
[11:19] like a cathedral or a tent and that tent
[11:21] had a little room and it's that Vision
[11:24] that has become one of the most
[11:25] controversial most misunderstood and Mis
[11:29] interpreted why because it speaks of
[11:31] something essential about God's
[11:32] character and what he desires and the
[11:34] devil would surely like to make a lot of
[11:36] confusion about it and at best getting
[11:39] all of us sitting on our hands waiting
[11:40] for it to happen and Miss what's
[11:42] happening right
[11:43] now and so there are certain elements in
[11:46] uh to this Tabernacle this Tabernacle of
[11:49] witness in the wilderness that are very
[11:51] distinct so first it's a tabernacle of
[11:54] witness in the wilderness where does
[11:55] that place it where does it place in
[11:57] Acts chapter 7 where is it coming to be
[11:59] in Exodus 25 in The Exodus before they
[12:03] get to Israel before Jesus as it says or
[12:07] Joshua brings it into the land of the
[12:09] Gentiles uh and begins to drive out the
[12:12] Philistines and all the other uh
[12:14] Hittites and things that dwelt there so
[12:16] this Tabernacle of witness in the
[12:18] wilderness has certain elements uh that
[12:21] are very critical for us to understand
[12:22] it had a a simple layout I say simple uh
[12:26] but we're look at in a sense that lays
[12:28] it out simply and this is just so uh
[12:31] just review for all of us and if it's
[12:34] anything that somebody doesn't know
[12:35] they're probably not here tonight and on
[12:37] Sunday if we revisit it you could just
[12:38] look over and like you don't know
[12:41] this but it speaks of the outer Court
[12:44] I'm joking uh it speaks there's these
[12:46] elements there's the outer Court the
[12:48] holy place and the most holy place this
[12:51] is so much just easier review but let me
[12:54] just touch on some things about it so we
[12:55] can understand this critical layout in
[12:58] the outer Court court or the courtyard
[13:00] and it was defined by I think it's 150
[13:02] cubits uh this fine linen that was used
[13:06] uh to set the borders of it in that
[13:08] place essentially all Jews were able to
[13:11] be in this portion of the what was
[13:14] called The Tabernacle of witness in the
[13:16] wilderness or that whole structure all
[13:17] Jews could come in there and in there is
[13:20] the bronze altar the Brazen altar which
[13:22] would have faced that uh that entrance
[13:25] and there's the Laver so there's these
[13:27] different elements that exist within the
[13:28] court yard and within that courtyard now
[13:31] there is another structure which
[13:34] contains the holy place and it was a
[13:36] first chamber of a tent or a structure
[13:39] within the entire enclosure or within
[13:42] the courtyard so you have a court or a
[13:45] courtyard and within the courtyard is a
[13:47] tent and a part of this tent is a
[13:49] chamber called The Holy place and there
[13:52] was the bread table the lampstand and
[13:54] only priests were allowed in there for
[13:57] service the that if you were a Jew you
[13:59] could come into the courtyard but you
[14:01] couldn't enter into the holy place that
[14:03] was a place that was reserved for the
[14:05] priesthood but then there was another
[14:07] chamber in that tent so there's a tent
[14:10] in the courtyard it kind of reminds me
[14:11] there's a hole there's a hole in the
[14:12] bottom of the sea and then there's a log
[14:14] in the hole in the bottom of the sea and
[14:16] it just seems it just keeps getting more
[14:17] precise so there was a courtyard in the
[14:19] courtyard there was a tent in the tent
[14:20] there was a chamber and then there was a
[14:23] chamber a second chamber in the most
[14:25] holy place and only one person the high
[14:27] priest could enter into there once a
[14:30] year and as we were already reading the
[14:32] staves uh to the Ark of the Covenant
[14:34] extended out from the most holy Place
[14:36] into the holy place as if it were a
[14:38] guide to guide the high priest into this
[14:42] Most Holy place and it was there that
[14:45] God dwelt and I'm realizing now I'd
[14:47] taken out several scriptures that I was
[14:49] going to originally place at the outset
[14:51] that show this is where God dwelt
[14:52] between the cherubims this is where the
[14:54] shakina glory lived between those
[14:56] cherubims it's explicitly written in the
[14:58] scripture so this was God's
[15:00] room Jews could be in the courtyard all
[15:02] Jews could be in the courtyard Levites
[15:04] the priest of the Levites and they could
[15:07] all exist in there but then the priest
[15:08] could go into the holy place but now in
[15:11] the most holy place so we call the holy
[15:13] of holies only the high priest could
[15:16] enter there because that was God's room
[15:19] and in order to get there that high
[15:20] priest had to prepare himself in a very
[15:22] very strict way we already read in
[15:25] Exodus 258 and let them make me a
[15:27] sanctuary that I may dwell among them
[15:30] this place that God would precisely
[15:32] dwell was in the holy of holies that
[15:34] inner Western room it was 10 cubits it
[15:37] contained the Ark of the testimony let
[15:40] them make me a sanctuary that I may
[15:42] dwell among them build me a house so I
[15:44] can live with
[15:46] you I don't want to just come and visit
[15:48] you with and I I want you to think
[15:50] really good about this I don't want to
[15:52] just visit you with signs and wonders I
[15:54] don't want to just reain Mana Out of
[15:55] Heaven I don't want to just do great
[15:57] exploits among you build me a house so I
[16:00] can live among
[16:02] you in that most holy place it was the
[16:05] tent of meeting is a way that describes
[16:08] the most holy place now if you can kind
[16:10] of catch the language that we're using
[16:12] is you have the Tabernacle but the
[16:15] Tabernacle had a
[16:16] courtyard in the courtyard there was a
[16:19] tent in the tent there was a holy place
[16:22] and then there was a Most Holy place and
[16:25] though all would be called a tabernacle
[16:27] there was only only one place where God
[16:29] met amen there was only one place where
[16:33] where God would dwell and that was in
[16:35] the holy of
[16:36] holies a tent of meeting in Revelations
[16:40] 15:5 it describes it this way and I
[16:44] apologize if my preacher's voice is just
[16:46] more annoying than it is uh Dynamic but
[16:50] in Revelations 15:5 it says and after
[16:52] that I looked and behold the Temple of
[16:54] the Tabernacle of the testimony in
[16:56] heaven was opened now that's quite a
[16:58] phrase the Temple of the Tabernacle of
[17:01] the testimony in heaven was opened so
[17:03] when it says the Temple of the
[17:04] Tabernacle of the testimony it's
[17:07] referring to as a very specific
[17:09] attribute and opening of the Tabernacle
[17:13] so you get to have the Tabernacle but
[17:15] now we have the Temple of the Tabernacle
[17:17] we have a courtyard we have an entire
[17:19] structure oh there's the Tabernacle let
[17:21] us go into the temple but we could just
[17:23] be using that language to refer to the
[17:25] entire structure but within the
[17:28] Tabernacle there was a courtyard and
[17:30] within the courtyard there was a tent
[17:31] and within the tent there was two
[17:32] Chambers and now it says the temple the
[17:35] Temple of the Tabernacle the Temple of
[17:37] the tent was opened in heaven so it's a
[17:40] very specific attribute of the whole
[17:43] Tabernacle so in the wilderness during
[17:45] The Exodus God gave them instructions
[17:47] and they built uh uh they built the
[17:50] Tabernacle with great detail we see it
[17:51] in Exodus it's described in many
[17:53] different places and very lengthy
[17:54] chapters but now if we look at First
[17:57] Kings chapter 8 and as we read already
[18:00] in Acts chapter 7 David wanted to build
[18:03] a tabernacle but he didn't want it just
[18:05] to be a tent he wanted it to be a
[18:07] permanent place why is it the most high
[18:09] would dwell in a tent and these
[18:11] temporary structures and uh made mobile
[18:13] and and ready to move at any time and
[18:15] here we are in our land of possession
[18:17] should we not build something more
[18:18] permanent and so Solomon doesn't uh
[18:21] pitch a tent he actually builds a
[18:24] house he builds a house for him and this
[18:27] is what we read about in first Kings
[18:29] which is where we have the temple so
[18:31] we're going from Tabernacle which was
[18:32] portable in the wilderness to the temple
[18:35] which is permanent so in the Bible
[18:37] there's places and especially in the New
[18:39] Testament when Paul is actually going
[18:41] back over some elements he's actually
[18:42] talking about the Tabernacle in the
[18:43] wilderness and not the temple in Israel
[18:46] and they both speak to the same thing
[18:48] and have similar structures but there's
[18:49] some maybe even some distinct
[18:51] differences there were some things are
[18:52] just much bigger and more Grand when
[18:54] Solomon built the house but that's
[18:57] something for us to always remember
[18:58] there was a tabernacle which was
[19:00] temporary in the wilderness that they
[19:02] continued to use until the days of David
[19:05] and then they built the temple those are
[19:07] two different things and though two
[19:09] different things they're still pointing
[19:10] to one and the same can even say if
[19:12] anything they're foreshadowing Christ
[19:15] still speaking of Christ a tabernacle
[19:17] Temple representing the same thing Mercy
[19:20] Seat in the one Mercy Seat in the other
[19:21] Mercy Seat continuing to move there's a
[19:23] lot of these elements that we could
[19:25] recognize and so now as we read in First
[19:27] Kings chapter 8: 6 to 11 we see it now
[19:31] this Tabernacle having been built this
[19:34] Temple that Solomon built it's a
[19:36] permanent place there in M Mount Mariah
[19:39] and it says and the priest brought in
[19:41] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto
[19:44] his place let's just go ahead and read
[19:46] the text all over again here and we'll
[19:48] Circle back to some of these things into
[19:50] the Oracle of the house to the most holy
[19:53] place even under the wings of the
[19:56] cherubs we can catch it in our Minds
[19:58] this view of them having built the outer
[20:01] walls to create a courtyard then they
[20:04] built a a place within the temple that
[20:07] would have two Chambers and You' have
[20:09] the Holy place and then in that you'd
[20:11] have the most holy place and to get
[20:13] there you'd have to come through the
[20:14] entrance to the courtyard and you could
[20:17] you would walk by uh you could walk by
[20:19] Jews and you could walk by other
[20:20] Israelites you could walk by Levites and
[20:22] Priests but as you came and came into
[20:24] the holy place there the priest would be
[20:27] gathered and You' have they had to walk
[20:29] and travel all the way to the most holy
[20:31] place the holy of holies that now set
[20:34] the Ark of the Covenant into its proper
[20:37] place it says into the unto his place
[20:40] for the cheram spread forth their wing
[20:42] two Wings over the place of the Ark and
[20:44] the cherums covered the ark and the
[20:45] staves thereof above and they drew out
[20:48] the staves at the ends of the staves
[20:50] were seen out in the Holy place before
[20:53] the Oracle so notice it's in the Holy
[20:55] place and it's referring to that little
[20:56] room as the oracle
[20:59] that's what that's where it it was and
[21:01] they don't take the staves out
[21:02] completely cuz they're instructed
[21:04] actually in the book of Exodus and I
[21:05] think numbers don't ever remove them
[21:07] completely and so it is brought in there
[21:10] to where it says and they were not seen
[21:12] without and there they are un this day
[21:15] there was nothing in the ark save the
[21:17] two tables of stone I'll just chew on
[21:19] that a little bit which Moses put there
[21:21] at horb when the Lord made a covenant
[21:24] with the children of Israel when they
[21:25] came out of the land of Egypt and it
[21:27] came to pass when the priests were come
[21:29] out of the Holy place now we just pause
[21:31] there for a moment it's now described
[21:34] quite a bit but the Ark of the Covenant
[21:37] the one that held the two tables of
[21:38] stone that Moses put there in horb and
[21:41] that God had written upon and that or
[21:43] that represented these The Ten
[21:44] Commandments given to Israel and the
[21:46] word of the lord it's put in there it's
[21:47] in that Ark of the Covenant this great
[21:50] symbol where God uh and it's
[21:52] representative of The Mercy Seat and
[21:54] there between the image of the cherubims
[21:57] this is where God would dwell Above This
[21:59] lid this H uh great beautiful
[22:01] representation now that that's placed
[22:04] where it belongs and where God wanted it
[22:05] to be it's then it says that the came to
[22:09] pass that the priest were come priests
[22:10] were come out of the Holy place that the
[22:12] cloud filled the house of the Lord so
[22:15] that the B priest could not stand to
[22:17] minister because of the cloud for the
[22:19] glory of the Lord had filled the house
[22:21] of the Lord wow what beautiful imagery
[22:25] beautiful imagery and so in this
[22:28] in this image we could say this the
[22:30] Wilderness Tabernacle has now been
[22:32] replaced all those tents and curtains
[22:35] and all those brackets and rings and
[22:37] everything that would have been
[22:37] represented there it's no longer used
[22:40] anymore that that tent of meeting that
[22:43] place is is not relevant in the sense
[22:45] that this is where God would meet it the
[22:47] Tabernacle of of the witness in the
[22:50] wilderness that was even used into that
[22:52] day now that Solomon had built the
[22:54] temple and built this house there's a
[22:56] replacement now with this physic
[22:57] physical Temple this first temple and
[23:00] we're reading of how the Ark of the
[23:01] Covenant is being placed permanently in
[23:04] the holiest of holies and I'd like you
[23:07] just to let your mind uh dwell on some
[23:10] of these inst these facts that the only
[23:13] thing in there were these two tables of
[23:16] stone you don't find the the pot full of
[23:19] Mana Aaron's Rod is not in there anymore
[23:23] and we could all speculate as to why
[23:24] it's not that perhaps the Philistines
[23:27] took it they had taking those things out
[23:28] of it and and and I would maybe
[23:31] conjecture a little bit that well God
[23:33] allowed him to be taken but he didn't
[23:35] allow the stones to be taken because
[23:37] what you see in the Mana and even the
[23:39] rod those are signs of his presence
[23:41] those are wonders and miracles but what
[23:43] we see represented these tables of stone
[23:45] is the word and Satan could take away
[23:48] the the signs or he could take away
[23:50] certain you could be healed and get sick
[23:52] again and the Mana would rot overnight
[23:54] and you'd have to get more and there's
[23:56] Miracles that can come and go and come
[23:58] and go and the rod which budded which
[24:00] testified of the power of the sh glory
[24:02] and the Mana which testified of God's
[24:04] provision they're not represented there
[24:06] but the word was represented there and
[24:09] God saw that that could not be taken out
[24:11] of the Ark because that what was was
[24:13] what was the most
[24:16] important Hallelujah and I'm realizing
[24:19] now I I don't have a preacher's voice
[24:20] even when it gets husky it just gets
[24:22] more whiny and
[24:24] nasally whatever that is can we put some
[24:28] uh I can't remember what it's called
[24:30] Auto pitch on there autotune yeah just
[24:33] autotune me a little bit get me let me
[24:36] find my groove
[24:38] here there's so there's there's a lot
[24:40] for you to really uh in a proper way
[24:44] fixate on to say wow God made sure that
[24:47] when it found its permanent place what
[24:49] we focus on in this little room is the
[24:52] word that's what has the preeminence and
[24:55] it says that it was it was brought into
[24:57] to his
[24:59] place the place in the part of the house
[25:02] where the Divine Oracle was and the
[25:05] Oracle is the holy of holies doesn't
[25:08] that speaks something the holy of holies
[25:10] is an oracle itself it's the testimony
[25:13] it's a place of witness it though the
[25:15] Tabernacle as a whole in the courtyard
[25:17] and all its elements speaks of something
[25:19] and the temple itself and its Courtyard
[25:21] and its all its amenities and things it
[25:24] speaks of something but there is one
[25:25] place that he spoke from amen there the
[25:28] Divine Oracle was and the holy of holies
[25:31] and as we read this I I hope that you're
[25:33] able to kind of catch this
[25:35] part this is a house whether we call it
[25:37] the Tabernacle of witness in the
[25:39] wilderness or the house that Solomon
[25:42] built this was a house with
[25:45] divisions now let me be very clear It's
[25:47] Not A House
[25:49] Divided but it's a house which is one
[25:52] which has divisions so it's not a house
[25:54] divided but it has
[25:55] distinctions that within it it's s there
[25:58] was a courtyard and a tent and the tent
[26:01] itself had two compartments brother
[26:04] bandam touches on this in a number of
[26:05] different places we'll just use a few
[26:08] tonight but in the sermon of hidden life
[26:10] and catch this first statement he makes
[26:12] now let's drop back to the hidden life
[26:15] and find out what this is going to
[26:16] require to get into this place of
[26:22] adoption a hidden
[26:25] life I think that's that that this place
[26:28] of adoption it hold some significance
[26:31] there a hidden life we realize that in
[26:32] the Old Testament under the mosaic laws
[26:34] there were two compartments and a
[26:37] congregation and then the setup of God's
[26:39] Tabernacle in the wilderness in the Old
[26:42] Testament under in the law that was
[26:43] given to Moses as we see in Exodus 25
[26:46] make me a sanctuary make me a house that
[26:48] I could live among you that it had these
[26:51] he calls it two compartments and a a
[26:54] general congregating place he said this
[26:57] was the congre that the first was the
[26:59] congregation or the courtyard that's my
[27:02] me adding in the courtyard there then
[27:03] the holy place then the holiest of
[27:06] holies that's God's house now catch this
[27:09] how what he what he's pointing to that's
[27:11] God's dwelling place now you only live
[27:14] in a three- room house remember you may
[27:17] have two bedrooms you may have three
[27:21] kitchens what kind of houses did they
[27:24] have in
[27:25] Jeffersonville you may have three
[27:27] kitchens one in the basement one in the
[27:29] first floor but you only live in a three
[27:32] room house and he makes a very good
[27:33] point no matter how many kitchens you
[27:35] have that's a room no matter how many
[27:36] bedrooms you have that's a room he says
[27:40] God lived so you only live in a three
[27:42] room house it's it's breaking down no
[27:45] matter how big your house is it's saying
[27:47] we can kind of distill down he says in
[27:49] one place I don't think I have it here
[27:51] no matter how many pantries you have you
[27:53] only have three
[27:55] rooms and he uses kitchen parlor uh
[27:58] Bedroom A lot of times is his language
[28:00] he using now I think it's good not to
[28:02] get hung up on that particular language
[28:05] that he's using but this the idea that
[28:07] he's saying look a house essentially has
[28:09] three areas where we can gather three
[28:10] particular elements to it and he says
[28:12] God lived in a three- room house when
[28:15] God was here on Earth he occupied a
[28:17] three- room house the soul body and
[28:19] spirit of Jesus Christ I catch that you
[28:22] catching this our title tonight is a a
[28:24] home with three rooms God lived in a
[28:26] three- room house Jes Jesus Christ had
[28:28] soul body Spirit God lived in a three
[28:30] room house so Christ now represents
[28:33] three rooms says in the temple he's in a
[28:36] congregation holy Place holy of holies
[28:38] so now in the Tabernacle three places in
[28:41] the temple three places each one of them
[28:44] was separated one from another and each
[28:47] one had a different Furniture in it to
[28:48] show the dwelling place and then when he
[28:51] says this this ought to kind of open up
[28:53] a whole area for us to realize there's
[28:54] something to this that we hopefully God
[28:56] can reveal to us quick Quicken to us in
[28:58] our individual ways and what I do by the
[29:00] teaching of the word is trusting that
[29:01] there's something we could bring out
[29:03] that the Holy Spirit could Quicken you
[29:04] say now that's something means something
[29:06] to me helps me to understand the word of
[29:08] God helps me to yield myself to the Holy
[29:10] Spirit he says a very beautiful type of
[29:13] the
[29:14] church so now we could say that the
[29:16] bride is even represented or the Church
[29:18] of God has represented it in it and the
[29:20] local church now is just a really cheap
[29:23] type of what the beautiful bride of
[29:25] Christ is or this local church serves
[29:28] that beautiful church that beautiful
[29:29] house andbody he saying there's
[29:32] something about this dwelling place that
[29:33] has these different separations and
[29:35] distinctions that makes it what it is
[29:38] says the cner first comes into the
[29:40] kitchen as it was the kitchen's where
[29:41] you eat the living room is where you
[29:43] commune and he talks a little little bit
[29:45] more about that in some other places and
[29:46] the bedroom is where you
[29:49] rest and again I think we don't need to
[29:51] be legalistic about this type but we
[29:52] realize that brother bram's going to use
[29:54] this language of a house that may have a
[29:57] common area where everyone eats and
[29:59] you're welcome to come here and this is
[30:00] where we eat first the word of God but
[30:02] then there's a little bit more of a
[30:04] private place he calls it the Parlor and
[30:06] he even talks about where maybe the veil
[30:07] is being lifted up and a little bit more
[30:09] intimacy but the ultimate formalization
[30:12] of a relationship he saying that's where
[30:14] the real intimacy is that's where the
[30:16] real relationship is security is in the
[30:18] bedroom and that's just the language
[30:20] that brother brandham
[30:21] uses and so this type I I want to just
[30:26] maybe point off to the side for a moment
[30:28] say this type as he's using the home or
[30:30] all of our individual houses tonight we
[30:32] may go back to an apartment we may go to
[30:34] a condo we may go to a house uh we may
[30:36] have a basement Suite wherever that
[30:38] might exist in the in the valley they're
[30:40] out there uh but there's just very few
[30:42] of them there's whatever it might be
[30:44] that we live in we could say that's a
[30:46] that's a house that can have these three
[30:48] rooms so that I think that holds a great
[30:51] signific significance to us a and where
[30:54] there's uh what's modeled here applied
[30:57] in great ways if I could just put it
[30:58] that way a lot of other ways that we
[31:00] could begin uh to go into that now if
[31:03] you'll look at Exodus chapter 40 verses
[31:06] 33 to
[31:15] 38 it says and he reared up the court
[31:19] round about the Tabernacle and the
[31:21] Altar and set up the hanging of the
[31:24] Court gate so Moses finished the work
[31:28] and exodus 27 you'll find it describing
[31:31] maybe I'll just turn there real quick
[31:33] and read it to you I think we're doing
[31:34] excellent on time tonight I think we're
[31:36] doing excellent on time all of us we're
[31:38] all doing really good on time tonight it
[31:41] says and thou shalt make the court of
[31:42] the Tabernacle for the South Side
[31:45] Southward there shall be hangings for
[31:47] the court to F twined linen of 100
[31:50] cubits long for one side and this we
[31:53] could keep reading it but that's what
[31:54] Moses now it's saying that he hung he
[31:56] reared up the court round about the
[31:58] Tabernacle and the Altar and set up the
[32:01] hanging of the Court gate so you had the
[32:03] tent or even here it's like kind of the
[32:05] tent of meeting the Tabernacle you had
[32:07] the the Brazen altar the Laver that's
[32:09] all there maybe existed in the open but
[32:11] now I'm going to hang this tent around
[32:15] it this this hangings it says reared up
[32:17] the court around it so that now it's
[32:20] going to be separated her out from the
[32:22] from the general population the general
[32:24] congregation he reared it up and reared
[32:26] up these hangings so Moses finished word
[32:29] it's almost like the final piece now and
[32:31] then it says then a cloud covered the
[32:33] tent of the
[32:35] congregation and the glory of the Lord
[32:37] filled the Tabernacle and Moses was not
[32:40] able to enter into the tent of the
[32:42] congregation because the cloud Abode
[32:44] thereon and the glory of the Lord filled
[32:47] the
[32:48] Tabernacle this is a this is the
[32:50] description of this moment that it's
[32:52] essentially finished you have the Ark of
[32:54] the Covenant is in there the the most
[32:56] holy of the holiest of holies is
[32:58] finished the holy place is finished the
[33:00] tent of meaning all the staves are
[33:02] driven down everything's in its place
[33:04] now they erect this final perimeter
[33:06] that's going to cut this divide this out
[33:08] and separate it out this final
[33:10] distinction now and when it h when this
[33:12] happens now the glory of the Lord is
[33:15] identified with this entire structure
[33:18] and the cloud is settled there on the
[33:19] glory of the Lord fills the
[33:21] Tabernacle and I want to I want to point
[33:23] this out again the house of the Lord was
[33:26] known by this three-fold division to
[33:29] where the glory of God does not come
[33:31] down until this last part is established
[33:34] it wasn't like man they put the Arc of
[33:36] the Covenant there God's like woohoo I
[33:37] want to get there and steps down and
[33:39] every there's this Glory that begins to
[33:40] fill this little room no the rest of it
[33:42] had to be there and once Moses had
[33:45] placed up the outer tent the glory of
[33:47] the Lord fills this
[33:49] place and it expresses something about
[33:53] the importance of a three- room
[33:55] house they saidwell why didn't they just
[33:58] leave the the altar there for all to see
[34:00] why didn't they just leave the labor
[34:01] there why did he have to set up the
[34:03] structure and we have to come through
[34:04] this gate uh that has certain colors
[34:07] mixed into it and woven together and why
[34:09] why did it have to face a certain
[34:10] direction and why did it have to be
[34:12] built where not everyone could look
[34:13] therein why was it arranged that way it
[34:16] there's something God arranged it that
[34:17] way it was a pattern of something he saw
[34:19] in heaven so has something to do with
[34:21] what's in God's mind and God's heart and
[34:23] what God desires so it's revealing
[34:25] something to us about God's
[34:26] characteristics in his ambition I have
[34:29] an image here just to so you can look at
[34:31] to
[34:32] see what this would have looked
[34:37] like and it is this will you could see
[34:40] in here this three-fold division where
[34:43] that that white border separates out the
[34:46] courtyard and and it's what's described
[34:48] in Exodus
[34:50] 27:9 and just how uh you know long that
[34:54] is and how beautiful it would have been
[34:55] set and even the the entrance we see
[34:57] there on the left side and when you
[34:59] would enter in you'd find the altar
[35:00] you'd find the Laver and then the tent
[35:04] the Tabernacle this Pillar of Fire being
[35:06] identified with it this is the
[35:10] Tabernacle but within the Tabernacle is
[35:12] even what's called a tabernacle or tent
[35:14] or a temple and then within that is a
[35:16] holy place and the most holy place and
[35:19] the place that God would live is in that
[35:22] little room the place that God would be
[35:26] is in the Holy place that's where he
[35:27] would dwell between those cherubims but
[35:30] God even though you might have this
[35:32] little place there in the middle the
[35:35] rest of it was important to express
[35:36] something to us to show something to us
[35:39] it was still a three room house even
[35:43] though brother bam says that God lived
[35:44] in a three room house and we know that
[35:47] where where the column of fire is being
[35:48] identified with where he said he would
[35:50] dwell is in that little room there in
[35:52] the most the most holy place or the
[35:54] holiest of place holies in that tent of
[35:56] me meaning the remaining threee room
[35:58] house meant something to the entirety of
[36:00] the
[36:02] structure so let's look at 1 Corinthians
[36:04] chapter
[36:05] 3 verses 16 and
[36:09] 17 this might be a I got just maybe a
[36:13] quick jump to the most important
[36:16] elements and details of
[36:18] this but it's 1 Corinthians chapter 3:
[36:20] 16 and 17 know ye not that ye are the
[36:25] temple of God that the spirit of God
[36:28] dwelleth in
[36:29] you if any man defile the temple of God
[36:32] him shall God destroy for the temple of
[36:34] God is Holy which Temple ye are
[36:38] now Paul just he just found a way to
[36:41] probably say it that would just
[36:42] aggravate every Jew within the sound of
[36:45] his
[36:46] voice because the temple right even
[36:48] today the most revered structure in in
[36:51] in the Jewish religion is the wall that
[36:53] they can
[36:54] identify as being the a vestage of the
[36:58] temple The Wailing Wall this this place
[37:01] that they could pray it means so much to
[37:03] them so this physical temple one of the
[37:05] most controversial statements Jesus made
[37:07] tear down this Temple I'll raise it in
[37:08] three days they like you leave this
[37:09] Temple
[37:10] alone it meant so much them it's such a
[37:13] significant structure but now Paul's
[37:15] saying you are the temple of God this is
[37:17] quite a language to use you are the
[37:20] temple of God now if we could just uh
[37:22] somehow just very quickly capture all
[37:24] the things that we've already said there
[37:25] was a pattern in heaven and In Heaven
[37:28] There was the Temple of the Tabernacle
[37:30] the testimony in heaven that what Moses
[37:33] saw there he builds and the Tabernacle
[37:35] of witness in the wilderness and it was
[37:37] a three- room house Courtyard holy Place
[37:41] Most Holy place and that now the temple
[37:44] follows the same pattern which we would
[37:45] have seen in heaven and it's a three-
[37:47] room house it is Courtyard holy Place
[37:50] Most Holy Place God in each one of these
[37:52] instances identifies himself First Kings
[37:55] chapter 8 Exodus chap 40 he has
[37:57] ultimately identifying himself as
[37:58] dwelling in the holiest of holies the
[38:00] most holy place but yet it doesn't not
[38:03] just exist on its own it has a chamber
[38:05] and then an outer Court a three room
[38:07] house brother bam then says that God
[38:10] lived in a three room house when he was
[38:12] here in Jesus he was Body Soul or Spirit
[38:15] soul that this is what he dwelt in now
[38:17] Paul is saying you are the Temple of the
[38:19] Holy
[38:20] Ghost know you not that ye are the
[38:23] temple of God brother brandham writing
[38:24] in the church age book said man was
[38:26] created for God he says man was to be
[38:30] the temple of
[38:31] God if I could say this even before
[38:34] there was a tabernacle of witness in the
[38:37] wilderness even before David desired to
[38:39] build my house even before Solomon built
[38:42] the house I know I'm maybe working the
[38:43] wrong way but even before Solomon built
[38:45] it even before David desired it even
[38:48] before Moses built it even before Moses
[38:50] saw it God desired that man would be a
[38:55] temple
[38:57] this is where a lot of this is pointing
[38:59] back to the series we ministered on the
[39:00] kingdom the place of God's rest he said
[39:03] the Holy Spirit was man the temple God
[39:07] always envisioned that man would be his
[39:09] Temple when the question is asked what
[39:12] what house will you build me and where's
[39:13] the place of my rest we could say that
[39:15] God didn't wasn't wanting a tent he
[39:18] wasn't wanting a tabernacle that man
[39:20] would erect and build but he wanted man
[39:22] to be his house therefore if man was
[39:25] going to be house man has to be
[39:27] reflected in the temple in 1
[39:30] Thessalonians 5: 23- 24 Paul says in the
[39:34] very God of Peace sanctify you entirely
[39:36] perfectly completely he says holy and I
[39:39] pray God your whole Spirit soul and body
[39:43] be preserved blameless unto the coming
[39:46] of our Lord Jesus Christ now as an aside
[39:49] let me I point this out that a lot of
[39:51] people say well theologians and maybe to
[39:54] a certain extent maybe in the message
[39:55] it's getting to where the outside
[39:57] doesn't count and home life doesn't
[39:59] count and all these other things and the
[40:00] Optics don't count but listen God cared
[40:03] enough to be so detailed and precise
[40:06] about this traveling tent in the
[40:08] wilderness that it covers chapters and
[40:10] chapters he doesn't just say put up a
[40:12] wall you know build the wall please it's
[40:15] going to be oo just going to be awesome
[40:17] he said I want it built this way I want
[40:19] it to look this way I want to be this
[40:21] long I want to have these kind of
[40:22] tabrets I want everything to buil be
[40:24] built in a certain way cuz it mattered
[40:25] to God yeah it mattered how it looked he
[40:28] said I'm going to live and dwell in this
[40:29] little room I'm that's the place I'm
[40:31] going to be I'm going to dwell between
[40:33] the wings of the cherubs and you say
[40:35] well make sure we get that right but the
[40:37] holy place it still mattered it was
[40:39] arranged a particular way the courtyard
[40:41] where everyone could come that had to be
[40:43] arranged a particular way and it tells
[40:45] us something about God's nature that
[40:48] even though we could say it's the soul
[40:49] where he'll dwell he cares about the
[40:52] condition of your spirit he cares about
[40:54] the condition of your body and he cares
[40:56] about the way you look to the people on
[40:57] the outside and he's not just saying oh
[40:59] I'll just live anywhere no it all had to
[41:02] line up even though he was going to live
[41:04] in some place very specific and
[41:06] particular the other parts
[41:09] matter to the point where he says your
[41:10] whole Spirit soul and body be preserved
[41:12] blameless not just the soul but your
[41:15] spirit and your body that three-fold
[41:17] person which we are that ought to give
[41:19] us courage to believe in our physical
[41:21] healing that ought to give us courage
[41:23] and and our in the healing of our
[41:24] spirits that are often broken and scared
[41:26] wounded but let me also say it speaks
[41:28] about the Holiness of what we express
[41:30] with how we dress and how we act it
[41:31] speaks about the Holiness of our
[41:33] thoughts and the things we pursue
[41:34] because the whole thing has got to be a
[41:38] temple brother bradam and the dedication
[41:41] of building to the dedication of
[41:42] building to the Lord he says the three
[41:44] room house several paragraphs here that
[41:46] deal with this he says a three the three
[41:49] room house a three compartment
[41:52] service one is your body what you do for
[41:55] Christ the the other is your spirit what
[41:57] you think of Christ the other is your
[41:59] soul the faith that you have in Christ
[42:02] Ah that's a good way of putting it is't
[42:03] it your faith which it's your faith that
[42:06] God seals with the baptism of the Holy
[42:07] Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[42:09] the new birth there in your soul which
[42:11] your faith allows you to be sealed or
[42:14] God seals your faith there is the faith
[42:16] that you have in Christ but now with
[42:18] your spirit it's what you think of
[42:20] Christ and your body is what you do for
[42:23] Christ Brother s said three compartment
[42:25] service he says again three room
[42:29] house
[42:30] completely absolutely dedicated to the
[42:34] service of the Living
[42:36] God justification by faith
[42:39] sanctification by the blood the filling
[42:41] of the Holy Spirit entering into peace
[42:43] and rest with God this is this pattern
[42:47] that's being expressed here he says
[42:49] completely absolutely dedicated to the
[42:52] service of the Living God what's
[42:53] completely absolutely dedicated to the
[42:55] service of the Living God my soul my
[42:58] spirit and my body it's the soul spirit
[43:01] and body that's to be preserved
[43:03] blameless it's the three rooms of the
[43:05] individual as it patterned in the
[43:07] Tabernacle in the wilderness as it was
[43:08] patterned in the the house that Solomon
[43:10] built as it was patterned in Jesus
[43:12] Christ so is it also reflected in Me God
[43:14] showing through these different
[43:16] structures that he allowed in the Old
[43:17] Testament that man was made to be his
[43:20] Temple that I gave you this division of
[43:23] Body Spirit Soul CU I wanted to reflect
[43:25] from the the very beginning that all
[43:27] along there was a place that I was
[43:29] wanting to have as my rest that you were
[43:32] going to be the
[43:33] temple a three room
[43:35] house in 1 Corinthians chapter 6: 19
[43:40] like Paul's saying what know you not
[43:42] that your body is the Temple of the Holy
[43:43] Ghost which is in you which you have of
[43:46] God and you are not your own just
[43:49] picking up what he said you are the
[43:50] temple of God the spirit of God dwelleth
[43:52] in you he's dwelling in that Soul uh
[43:55] you're the for the temple of God is Holy
[43:56] which Templar are ye you are the body is
[44:00] the Temple of the Holy Ghost said the
[44:02] body yeah just like the Tabernacle just
[44:04] like the temple but where does he dwell
[44:07] there in the soul where where does where
[44:09] does he want to be in the soul no matter
[44:11] how much you might be filled with this
[44:13] enthusiasm and glory in the spirit or
[44:14] how much you might feel it on your flesh
[44:16] where God lived was in the soul there
[44:19] was a certain experience someone could
[44:21] have in the Holy place but it was in the
[44:23] holy of holies where he lived there was
[44:25] a certain experience someone could have
[44:26] in the courtyard but where he lived was
[44:27] in the most holy Most Holy
[44:31] Place brother Bram says in the sermon
[44:33] unveiling of God this would be a that
[44:35] would be a good one maybe just to tap
[44:37] into he says the Mighty God unveiled the
[44:40] unveiling of God both deal with these
[44:41] same principles you are templ
[44:46] Christ you are templ Christ that's
[44:49] behind the veil the skin the veil again
[44:52] in human flesh hides God the word from
[44:54] the unbeliever
[44:56] you are where God hides himself God
[44:59] hiding himself today in the Simplicity
[45:02] of a human being God tabernacled in
[45:05] flesh God is templed you are templ in
[45:08] Christ behind your skin Veil human flesh
[45:12] hides God the word from the unbeliever
[45:14] and you say oh yes God is hidden I've so
[45:18] completely hidden him that nobody has a
[45:21] clue some of you are really good at
[45:23] hiding them but where he hides himself
[45:26] he also reveals himself and if he's hid
[45:29] from the unbeliever you ought to be
[45:31] simple enough and hold and express God
[45:34] enough to where though the unbeliever
[45:36] doesn't see him it encourages the
[45:38] believer to know him through
[45:41] you no matter how holy we are no matter
[45:43] how dedicated we are no matter how right
[45:45] we are in our responding no matter how
[45:47] well we live the word of God he'll
[45:49] always be hid from the unbeliever but
[45:51] that's not an excuse to not express and
[45:55] reflect the Holiness of God in our
[45:58] lives he says and he veils himself today
[46:01] in Earth and vessels with the shikina
[46:03] the vessels hold the Shaka the outside
[46:06] looks like a bunch of Holy Rollers old
[46:08] Badger skins these bags waxing old but
[46:12] the inside hides the shikina
[46:16] glory the
[46:18] inside think of it just how quickly we
[46:20] moved to
[46:21] that just how quickly we can go from the
[46:24] temple in the will the Tab the wildness
[46:26] to the temple in Jerusalem to Christ to
[46:29] you right you are temple in Christ my
[46:33] brother B I'm saying that there's a
[46:34] three room house that God dwells in we
[46:36] see it in the Tabernacle we see it in
[46:37] the temple we see it in Christ now I see
[46:39] it in
[46:41] me you are temple in
[46:44] Christ God the word is
[46:46] hidden from the unbeliever In the Flesh
[46:49] of his
[46:52] bride I'm just going to wrap up I have
[46:54] another quote and just one more
[46:55] scripture to read read just follow me
[46:57] there now in this reading from the
[46:59] sermon
[47:03] dedication and when this body had been
[47:05] made a sacrifice the correct lamb had
[47:08] been sacrificed there was coming forth
[47:10] then who is the correct sacrifice Christ
[47:14] what did all the sacrifices and and all
[47:16] all of them whether it be uh Lambs or
[47:18] dobs or whatever it might be that that
[47:21] one offering once a year what did it all
[47:22] point to the correct lamb that was
[47:24] coming the Passover Lamb that they
[47:27] partook in all these individual families
[47:29] completely ate up uh there at the Feast
[47:31] of the Passover every year what did it
[47:32] point to Christ so now that Christ had
[47:35] been crucified the body had been slain
[47:37] the sacrifice had been altered offered
[47:40] and what a beautiful testimony of how
[47:41] that he goes to hell and now he's got to
[47:43] present the sacrifice in heaven just as
[47:46] the high priest would do once a year
[47:48] this bloody lamb was going to present
[47:49] himself in heaven and we see that this
[47:51] Christ uh between hell and heaven we see
[47:54] this image of him telling hold on you
[47:56] can't touch me yet I've got to go and
[47:57] make a representation of the slain lamb
[48:00] in heaven as the high priest did every
[48:02] year this time of year he said now once
[48:04] this has happened Watch What comes forth
[48:07] God came to his own body which was his
[48:10] bride yeah now we're on the day of
[48:12] Pentecost go Terry you till the day of
[48:15] Pentecost is fully come and he said and
[48:17] there had been 120 temples that God had
[48:21] created and were ready for dedication
[48:23] that had got all their unbelief beat out
[48:25] of them amen he he's I getting beat up
[48:27] well pray to God that it's he beating
[48:29] out the unbelief and no matter how much
[48:31] we're beaten as Believers at the end of
[48:33] the day no matter how much it feels like
[48:35] you're going to lose you've got one
[48:37] promise it's going to be unbelief that
[48:39] you lose it's going to be the unbelief
[48:41] that's beaten out of you sometimes we
[48:42] find ourselves really in The Crucible
[48:44] getting beat up and suffered quite a bit
[48:46] and we may feel that we suffer the loss
[48:48] of a lot of things but the best thing
[48:50] you're losing in all of it is your doubt
[48:52] and
[48:54] unbelief get it all all beat out of us
[48:56] it may not feel like it at the time you
[48:58] may feel like you're losing your faith
[48:59] you're losing your confidence you're
[49:00] losing your testimony but I promise you
[49:02] one day you're going to be able to stand
[49:03] and say if I lost anything it was that
[49:05] unbelief that was bringing me down and
[49:07] God had to beat me up to get it out of
[49:09] me and today I'm glad for
[49:11] it they gathered in the upper room and
[49:14] waited for 10 days for a dedicational
[49:16] service now notice how beautiful this is
[49:19] then when completely surrendered the day
[49:21] of Pentecost was fully come according to
[49:23] the promise the written word god came
[49:25] down again in the shakina of glory and
[49:27] filled all the house where they were
[49:29] setting do we not read that in Acts this
[49:33] is what happens what's amazing is now
[49:35] they're in this Upper Room they're in
[49:37] this place this Gathering Place the holy
[49:40] spirit's going to fall down on them and
[49:41] it's going to fill the whole place the
[49:44] glory the Lord's going to be seen we see
[49:45] in Exodus 40 we see in First Kings
[49:47] chapter 8 that there there's some
[49:48] representation where you feel like well
[49:50] it's it's beyond it's beyond the little
[49:53] room there's some spill over there's
[49:55] some effect where now even this pillar
[49:57] fire the cloud can be seeing these
[49:58] things but where is he going to be these
[50:01] tongues of fire there's things external
[50:02] there's things visible there's tongu
[50:04] being spoken but where did God come he
[50:06] wasn't in the tongues he wasn't
[50:08] necessarily in all these other things he
[50:09] was now coming to souls yeah amen and
[50:13] the same the same effect is taking place
[50:15] it filled all the house where they were
[50:17] sitting what did God do oh this is so
[50:19] beautiful like the ark dropping into its
[50:21] proper sockets for the message of that
[50:24] day God dropped back into his proper
[50:26] Channel not in a denomination or into a
[50:29] building made with hands but Into the
[50:32] Heart of men catch that it wasn't the
[50:35] upper room that made it so awesome it
[50:37] wasn't the tint structure it wasn't
[50:39] something Cathedral like but it was a
[50:41] special place that got an Envision it
[50:43] was some place that meant something to
[50:45] God he said that's where I met him
[50:48] that's where I was coming like the Ark
[50:50] of the Covenant dropping in to the most
[50:53] holy place the holy of the Holy and now
[50:56] the priests begin to leave and they pull
[50:58] out the staves and it comes into the
[51:00] holy place and now it's marked the
[51:02] entrance of the most holy place and as
[51:04] they step out God comes down into the
[51:07] holiest of holies that's where God was
[51:09] and though it might have reverberated
[51:11] and the glory of the Lord in Acts fills
[51:13] up the whole house where they are where
[51:14] they were the glory where it was living
[51:17] was in the heart of
[51:19] man because that's what the ark dropping
[51:21] into that Oracle of God who's the Oracle
[51:24] of God anyways where does it speak from
[51:25] in this end time who's the company
[51:28] that's publishing it in this end time
[51:30] God dropped back in his proper channel
[51:32] into building madebe with
[51:33] hands not in a building made with his
[51:35] hand but into the heart of man he
[51:38] dropped in his place for the last day
[51:40] which said the prophet Joel it shall
[51:42] come to pass in the last days I'll pour
[51:43] out my shika put All Flesh your sons and
[51:46] daughters shall prophesy your young men
[51:47] shall dream dreams and the old men shall
[51:48] see Visions you catch what's even being
[51:51] shown here the spirit can move but he
[51:54] didn't just want to move move he wanted
[51:56] to
[51:57] live he wanted to live and where does he
[51:59] live not in a church service not in a
[52:01] Saturday night meeting not even a prayer
[52:03] line he lives in the hearts of
[52:06] men God came to his resting place where
[52:10] he finds rest not in a building not in a
[52:14] tent not in a tabernacle not in a temple
[52:16] but in the heart of his people he finds
[52:19] rest God came to his resting place
[52:25] ultimately finally he found the place he
[52:29] wanted to live amen Brothers if you
[52:31] could come to your instruments we'll
[52:32] just wrap up
[52:33] here Hebrews chap
[52:37] 10:5 wherefore when he cometh into the
[52:39] world he sayith sacrifice and offering
[52:41] thou wouldest not but a body hast thou
[52:45] prepared
[52:46] me why was The Ultimate not the temple
[52:50] why would Jesus even come to the temple
[52:52] and and clear out say you've made the
[52:53] house of God a den of Thieves
[52:56] you've polluted it you've perverted it
[52:59] why would it even be that Christ would
[53:01] not come and restore Temple worship as
[53:03] it ought to be and bring the sh kind of
[53:05] Glory back behind the veil but actually
[53:07] that's not even what happens when he's
[53:09] sacrificed on the cross the veil is
[53:12] written and it shows there is no Ark of
[53:14] the Covenant there there is no mercy
[53:16] seat there there is no blood
[53:18] there he actually comes and exposes the
[53:21] shallowness and The Emptiness of their
[53:23] vain thoughts of this place this Temple
[53:26] this Cathedral this place of worship
[53:28] however they would have looked at he
[53:29] says no that's not where it was supposed
[53:31] to be to begin with the temple in the
[53:33] wilderness the temple in Jerusalem was
[53:35] all pointing to Christ the temple that
[53:37] would come so that he could be the
[53:39] ultimate sacrifice and represent the
[53:41] lamb that would forever consecrate his
[53:43] resting
[53:45] place the body thou has prepared me God
[53:49] was not Desiring and if I can say this
[53:51] today to you God is Not Desiring the
[53:54] discipline of abstaining from things
[53:57] God's not Desiring the sacrifice of
[53:59] abstinence from Evil and I don't cuss
[54:01] and I don't smoke and I don't drink he's
[54:03] not just asking for us to artificially
[54:05] clean up our lives as we could
[54:07] artificially keep a Courtyard Clean we
[54:09] could artificially set up all these
[54:10] different elements he's not just wanting
[54:12] your offering of Good Works he's not
[54:14] just wanting your offering of Praise And
[54:16] speaking in tongues in dcing and CH
