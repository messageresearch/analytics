TRANSCRIPT
========================================
exodus chapter 32 going to begin with verse 9. exodus chapter 32 verse 9 read to verse 14. and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiff-necked people now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them and i will make of thee a great nation moses besought the lord his god and said lord why do thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou has brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with the mighty hand wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou swearest by thine own self and set us unto them i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i've spoken of will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it forever and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people we could let's pray together our heavenly father we are grateful for another gathering as we've gathered his family and lifted up praises and opened up our hearts you've followed the faithfulness of the people and even the atmosphere that has been created and you've come into our midst and i believe you desire to speak to us now lord take the bread of life and impart to us wisdom and instruction that we know can only come from above we're so appreciative of those who labor and do many different things to to see that this service can function to see that things are set up and even in the worship and the music lord so many that played their part and do their part we pray that you'd bless them and encourage them and strengthen them lord for those who are unable to be here tonight but desire to be here may you touch them heal those that are sick in body heal those who are crying unto you for a touch lord maybe even for years desiring a deliverance would you grant it lord for those who have other circumstances we ask that you comfort strengthen and encourage commit all things to you now lord asking that you come rightly divide the word of truth to our hearts as only you can in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you can be seated continue on the subject of what does wisdom look like now we've had five parts on this particular question of what does wisdom look like and tonight we're going to use the word uh consistent wisdom if you're looking for wisdom it's going to be consistent what does wisdom look like it's consistent and i i want to go back and touch on some scriptures that i know will be very familiar to us as we've used them over the last few weeks but do this to build a foundation for this thought of consistent or consistency and we've been looking at the different characteristics of wisdom even in asking the question what does it look like in order to give ourselves some specific guidance to judge our actions and to judge our thoughts and so the context is i need wisdom in my daily life and i need wisdom to approach certain situations to raise my children to to tackle certain responsibilities we we should desire wisdom in those things and we saw that how when solomon asked for wisdom it was something that pleased god so this is something that we should desire and something we should ask for so when we're using these characteristics of wisdom and identifying these certain characteristics uh to kind of give us a measuring stick of whether or not we have wisdom whether or not we're thinking the right way making the right kind of judgments it's to help us when we're asking the specific question in certain situations of what should i do i have a decision to make what should i do i have two different job offers what should i do i'm trying to deal with a particular situation within my family what should i do or how should i respond to this request or what should i say and what should my actions be and when we ask those questions we're desiring not just kind of a general wisdom so that people would think that we're smart but we're asking god for wisdom for the moment for the decision that we're facing the circumstance that we're in and what we're touching on may not be um specific so it's such as to say that well when you find yourself in this particular situation this is what you're supposed to do and kind of giving you a cheat sheet on wednesday nights how to how to make the right kind of decisions uh monday to friday but it's just giving you general principles so that you can think about my thought process my decisions even look back in your life and say i remember when i did that now that i look on it i see what it produced and the things that came out of it and giving you some general principles about wisdom that we can begin to guide um our answers to those questions how should i respond what should i say what should i do and we've been looking at how the bible refers to the meekness of wisdom and really just identifying how the meekness of wisdom can be known by its fruits the attributes of wisdom express are expressed a particular way the the manifestation of wisdom has a particular expression and that's what we can do in our own lives to say well well wisdom will produce certain fruits so i want to look for those fruits in my decision-making even in the things i'm thinking about how does it make me feel what is what kind of emotions are being stirred up within me as i ponder certain things and in james chapter 3 verse 13 it says who is a wise and man and in dude with knowledge among you let him show so this is expression this is manifestation these are characteristics that are being uh expressed to us and we can judge whether or not a man is wise and endued with knowledge as he shows out of a good conversation his works out of a life lived decisions and fruits works that he has a good conversation his works with the meekness of wisdom so it has a particular characterization it's meek and we saw in verse 17 but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits it's fruitful in all these things without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace so when james is teaching us how to identify wisdom and knowledge he's saying look for the fruits we mentioned last time in terms of uh confident that when you're abiding in the vine the branch bears fruit so even the the evidence of the energy is the fruit that's produced the evidence that a branch is in the vine is the fruits that it produces and so these uh characteristics of pure peaceable gentle easy to be entreated full of mercy without partiality without hypocrisy are the fruits of righteousness and these are things that james is saying if you see these things that's something that is a wisdom from above where you see strife and jealousy and envying and contention and competition that's the wisdom that comes from beneath and so we can look for at the fruits of something to judge what the source is is it from below or is it from above in matthew chapter 7 verses 15 to 20 it says beware of false prophets so just as james says who's the wise men and dude with knowledge among you you could kind of take this to where saying this is would not be a wise man who is this unwise person beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing so this is outwardly they would appear innocent outwardly they would appear harmful but inwardly they are ravening wolves so outwardly it could look one way but inwardly the source the the things that are driving them the things that motivate them inwardly they are raving in wolves so then he tells us this and you think this seems to be maybe somewhat of a contradiction if i'm looking for fruits i see sheep's clothing and yet something is hidden behind it but he's saying that what's on the inside is going to come out so don't just look at the exterior don't look at um the efforts of politics and pretense to fool you be discerning about how this sheep is acting how is it manifesting itself and we should all be like well maya what big teeth you have right and my what what better what big claws that you have grandma why we should be able to discern by more than just the sheep's clothing that something else is going on and something else has taken place and so it says in verse 16 ye shall know them by their fruits who these ones that outwardly could appear kind and gentle and sweet and sincere but inside they desire to take advantage of you and to manipulate you or to destroy you you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles do they no you don't you don't get the grapes from thorns or the figs from thistles it's saying that there's a particular characterization of these thorns and thistles and they're not fruit bearing fruit they don't bear the fruits that are pleasing to you every so even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit he's expounding upon how that you can judge a tree or a person by their fruits judge a ravening wolf by his fruits you can judge even a sheep by its fruits you shall know them by their fruits because a good tree is going to bring forth good fruit a corrupt tree is going to bring forth evil fruit verse 18 a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them this is instructive that you can judge something by its fruits it's the same thing that james is teaching us when he's telling us that wow who who has wisdom well look at what it produces look at the fruits of it and if it produces these particular fruits then you know that has to be wisdom from above but if it produces fruit contrary to that or prickly or a carnal or a devil issue say well that can't be the wisdom of god this can't be christ the life of christ and the wisdom of christ being expressed so you shall know them by their fruits in james chapter three let's just drop back a few verses and look at verse nine it says therewith bless we god they're with the therewith is the tongue so he's talking about our mouths and what we say and how the tongue is an unruly member and he says we can i use the tongue in a particular way and we can use the tongue to bless god even the father and use the same tongue and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of god so he said on one hand we can use the tongue to bless god but then use the same mouth to curse men that are made after the likeness of god and james is kind of identifying the hypocrisy of it that your religious confession on one hand but you're tearing down and destroying of a man on another is incongruent with how of one who truly understands the greatness and goodness of god so he says out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing and he says my brethren these things ought not so to be this challenges us we realize the same mouth we praise god the same mouth that we use to worship god oftentimes things that are not pleasing to god or do not align with the nature and character of christ come out of the same mouth so i love the grace that james has he just says it shouldn't be that way it doesn't condemn us so we go oh according to matthew chapter 7 because i had a cursing then i must be an evil tree and i'm going to be cast into fire james kind of deals with us in grace and says it should not be that way so that we could challenge ourselves if i really have the mind of christ if i really have the holy spirit then i can bridle my tongue to speak the right things and to use it correctly my brethren these things ought not so to be verse 11. does the fountain sin forth at the same time same place sweet water and bitter no can the fig tree my brethren bear olive berries no either a vine figs no so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh it's impossible cannot get them out of the same fountain and this is the foundation for him asking the question who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you if there's a wise man and dude with knowledge among you then look at the fruits that it bears if it's always caustic and critical and condemning and those things the same just be just be white be honest be discerning be be those who can judge by fruits and say well i don't know if this is really christ that's expressing itself be willing to judge ourselves and say what spirit is motivating me what's what's the source behind these things i'm thinking i'm saying i'm doing because he's using this as the foundation to this question of who is the wise man and dude with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works this would be the olives of an olive vine these would be the the figs of an olive tree these would or the olives of an olive tree the figs of a fig tree these he's telling us these are the fruits that you want to expect if this is the life that's behind it so if you have a wise man you'd want to see the fruits of wisdom someone is dude dude with knowledge you want to see his works with the meekness of wisdom and so that's why when we're looking at this what does wisdom look like we're using this very context of james chapter 3 how he's saying identify it by its fruits look at the decisions that are being made look at the thought process behind it look at your immediate motivation and what feelings have motivated that and the principles that you're trying to lay down in the manner in which you're trying to establish them and you can judge it by saying well this is what wisdom produces this is what wisdom of the flesh or the carnal mind produces and you can you i'm saying i believe that you as hun sons and daughters of god can have the ability to say i think wisdom lies in this this is where the real wisdom is and so we were at the kind of the characteristics we've looked at so far on what does wisdom look like is we kind of took this general principle about the meekness of christ that wisdom is the word in action and the word in action to be effective is it has a humility and a meekness to it and and then there was this characteristic last week of uh wisdom is confident but it's confidently at rest not defensive not always trying to prove itself and putting itself forward but it's confident and that confident was fully assured meaning having strong belief and conviction and and having a firm belief and strong belief it's firmly trusting it's relying upon something and because it's relying upon something that's sure not only is it rest but it's bold and daring and this this is what wisdom is it is confident and a phrase that we ended with we are reading of charles spurgeon and he made this statement if we have full faith in god we shall teach succeeding generations to expect jehovah's hand to be stretched out still that this is how this is how the wisdom from above demonstrates itself it demonstrates it in that quiet confidence that abraham had when he had been promised to have seed after him promised to have seed by through isaac that when he was asked to sacrifice isaac he walked confidently and he used confident speech and he he prepared himself he did everything god asked him to do confident that god would do it and and we expressed in the sense that jehovah sees and jehovah will see to it that he knows the situation he knows the need and not only does he see it but he will see to it he will he will make sure that his word comes to pass and that gives us confidence wisdom from above instills confidence in us that we can trust in it we can rely upon it and spurgeon's comment is if we have this then we can teach others that jehovah's hand will be stretched out still as we know that the wisdom from above is consistent and it speaks to the consistency of christ that if he's done something one way we can expect him to do the same thing in the same situation and so as we look at this characteristic of consent a consistent it means to stand firm to take a standing position and and even comes from the the idea of something uh standing erect and standing up and it's firm and it's in it's in a solid place uh the the root it comes from the word meaning to place a steer consistent sister means to place and so it's it i can see how this is very much akin to confident or confidence but now we're looking at it consistent or consistent and the idea of consistency this is an essential characteristic of jesus christ this is something that's just you know it's completely connected with christ connected with god and it's it's an absolute necessity for our own confidence it's an absolute necessity for there to be consistency there can be some sort of expectation we can we can have some idea what's happening next that gives us confidence and it gives us comfort and so if the if wisdom is the meekness of christ we're looking at how that there's a consistency to christ in hebrews chapter 13 verses 7 to 9 and i just want to compliment you i could agree with brother loyal that you know these weeks seem to be difficult i was fellowshipping with them earlier and he said it's been a weird week and i felt like weird weeks are just the you know commonplace anymore if it wasn't a weird week we might say well this is weird it's not a weird week what's happening and so uh we we i appreciate your attentiveness and just the pull and the sense of a desire that i sense in your spirit to hear from god tonight hebrews chapter 13 verses 7 to 9 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow so we're looking at those that have rule and now it's telling us that we want to remember them we have respect to them and they speak the word to us and then it says whose faith follow and suggesting that we ought to follow their example of faith and then it tells us considering the end of their conversation so if there's those who are speaking the word of god to you then they should be given you and affording you an example of faith as you consider as you inspect as you see manifest to you the end or the fruit of the life they live it's not just somebody with a name tag that says i'm the manager you should listen to me or i'm the boss listen to what i have to say but you kind of look at their their demeanor their characteristic and if they're speaking to you the word of god if you see that their life produces fruit considering the end of their lives the fruit of their lives then that's a faith or an example that we ought to follow and then this is the verse that we all know and we could we could quote from heart jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever so what what end are we considering what fruit are we looking for those who speak the word of god to us whose faith we ought to follow considering and identifying the fruit of their life jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever is this not what we longed to see in leadership especially let's say from those who preach the gospel and those who are pastors and those who are in positions of authority that when they make a decision or they tell us what they feel that we ought to do or they they handle a difficult situation or maybe even we've made a mistake how do we want to be dealt with we want to feel that what we're being who's dealing with us is christ what we want to see in the decisions that are made and the response to certain things is we're just longing to see christ and i believe that a son or daughter of god knows it when they see it that there's something about the way you can be talked to there's something about the way you can be confronted there's something about the way that you can be treated and say well i don't know what's right or wrong and i'm not sure what the right thing to do is but i don't feel or see christ in the way that i'm being treated and this is the standard that's being lifted up according to hebrews 13 is remember these things and consider their lives do you see jesus christ who is the same yesterday the same today and the same forever the way that he's always been is the way that he is now and that's the way that he'll always be such that no one should be able to say well i know that jesus christ was this way but i'm telling you now he's this way that there's something about something consistent and never changing about the character of jesus christ jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's consistent and it continues be not carried about with diverse and strange doctrines so this is kind of forms the hub jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so remember them who are instructing to you the word of god look at their faith examine the end of their lives the fruit of their lives do you see jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever looking for this now and holding to the sameness of christ in this oneness of christ and this never changing attribute of christ it says be not carried about with diverse and strange doctrines this would apply to verse 7 the looking at those who purport to be leading and guiding and controlling and sharing the word of god with us be not carried about with diverse and strained doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace and not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein so he's talking about stability be not carried about and tossed to and fro and going this way and going that way being up and down and all excited one minute all depressed the next and all in one minute and hedging on the next minute he's saying we ought not to be carried about with whims and ideas and and feelings and emotions and charisma and all these different things he says for it's a good thing notice this it's a good thing that the heart be established with grace and not with meats so now he's talking about the outside not the heart but the outside he's talking about legalism or the meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein somewhat something that's internal something that's long-lasting something that's effective versus something that's external and temporal the heart being established in grace versus these external things where you can abstain from meats and you can do these things that are outward do these things that are physical do these things that are legalistic he says it doesn't really yield the prophet so a heart must be established with grace and a heart established with grace it means to make firm to make sure to make stable comes from the greek word basis so speaking of that which one steps on it's important that the heart be established in grace that that be the basis that be what you're stepping on that be your solid ground and if that is your solid ground what is that it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever it's the basis for identifying the end of the conversation it's the basis for identifying is it's a strange or diverse doctrine it's going to throw me away and throw me that way and toss me about so he's saying that there the heart must be established made stable made firm in grace the basis upon which we're standing must be grace not law the basis upon which we're governed the basis upon which we're teaching the basis upon which we're learning is not legalism not law but it is grace and it's very it's very easy for something that can be spelled out explicitly in the word of god for it to be snatched by the hands of legalism and applied in a legalistic way and then it doesn't produce the fruits that it ought to why because it's important it's necessary it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace and that's where we want to deal with someone from on the heart level within their heart within their spirit not just externally making everything measure up but within the heart and paul consistently admonished the believer to be consistent because this is a divine attribute a number of scriptures we can use about it being established and being fixed and being firm there's a number of different places where he says and i'll use one example in first corinthians 16 13 watch ye stand fast that means to stand firm to persevere to persist to keep one standing to cause or to make to stand to place or to put or to set so we're being this is that same idea of being consistent and being established we're being placed i'm being set this is the basis watchy stand fast in what in the faith and then it says quit you like men be strong in other words be consistent when it says stand fast be consistent know where you stand know how to stand quit you like men that means be understanding and wise don't be like children create you like men be understanding be wise not unstable not inconsistent like children that's the one of the frustrations of of of raising children is it they're they're not always the same way every day i can remember when we with our first child elliot that it was he was a very picky eater and so you'd buy something and he would eat it all up like stock the refrigerator he he liked it he ate all of it this is really going to work so you go to costco and you buy all the family size packs of it and then the next day he doesn't like it anymore because they're just finding things out they're learning they're growing they like it one day they don't like it the next paul is touching on this idea when he says stand fast stand firm keep your standing be set be placed in other words be consistent know where you stand know how you're standing quit you like men don't be unstable don't be inconsistent the the speaking is this is how he's admonishing the believer that there ought to be some steadiness there ought to be some stability there ought to be some consistency in your life he says this in ephesians chapter 6 verses 13 to 14 and you'll find several other places in the scripture where this stand firm stand firm stand firm is used but now in ephesians chapter 6 verses 13 to 14 it says wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore there's many that read it that way that say having done all to stand stand therefore as this is the statement having done all to stand then stand therefore that this is what our efforts ought to be producing is this standing it means to place to set to make firm to be fixed to be immovable this is what all this armor is to do is to make you immovable it's to make you steadfast is to make you stand firm is something to where you can defend your position you can all the things that would buffet you to try to throw you off and to push you to the side and carry you about with every wind of doctrine he's saying these are things that ought to make you established and fixed and strengthened and settled to be placed to be set firm to be fixed to be immovable so we want to know where to stand and and then once we identify where we stand we always well this is where it's at this is where we need to be this is what this is what it is and then oh well no maybe we should go over here or no maybe we should go there maybe we should do this maybe we did that that's inconsistent that's that's taking a position that well let's defend this with everything that's in us it's this way and it's got to be this way and this is what's right and this is what's going to work and then as soon as it seems like oh this isn't quite working out let's abandon this position that's run over here and where are you ever going to have confidence when that's what's driving you just think about uh your own personal situations we've come we've come tonight with the the rake and not the pitchfork right so we're not saying boy this is really good for brother chris you know hey sister so-and-so could really use this and we're kind of looking around trying to wonder did she make it is she here i hope she's getting this i hope she's streaming if she's not here let's just take it personal because i may not be specific tonight but i feel that you can think yep that that fits really really well with respect to this and this fits with this particular pattern in my own life or i could really use this right now to to evaluate something that i'm facing and so we need to stand and then knowing where to stand you want to know you're standing on something solid you want to know that this is wisdom from above that this is something i can trust i can have confidence in this and then having this confidence it brings this consistency that this principle works it's timeless it works i can i can trust this brother branham and the message images of christ said the church can never progress until it knows what ground what grounds it's progressing on so if you want to go forward you got to know the path forward you don't want to just be blindly saying well let's just see if this works let's see if that works and he says and i believe that before anybody can ever move or have real confidential faith it's first they have to know where they stand and how to stand after they make their stand so i need to know where to stand make my stand and then know how to stand there's these different principles he's looking at just as paul said you know having done all to stand stand there for i need to know where to stand make my stand and then know how to stand now this is where i stand i know this is where i stand so i'm going to stand now how do i make this consistent how do i make my stand how how can this position be strengthened and how can i benefit from this position and how can i experience the rest that comes with me in my position how can i experience the fruitfulness that comes from being in my position if you want fruit sow the seed water the seed and leave it there don't keep digging it up well i'm wondering if no it's got to stay it's got to be fixed it's got to be established it's got to become rooted it's got to grow up under the right kind of atmosphere and these are the things that's being spoken to they have to know where they stand how to stand if they make their stand brother brahms using in one sense that how can we progress unless we know the path how can we grow unless we find the ground that we can grow in and allow our roots to go down and stand and make our stand he says i believe that is essential for you cannot just headlong plunge into something with faith when you don't know where you're plunging isn't that exactly how we've defined faith though i have no idea but i'm just going to jump in and we've almost made faith like a shot in the dark and that's really not what faith is it's well i'm not so sure it's going to be there but i'm just trusting it will be and i really don't know what's going to happen i just have faith well um that's not really what faith is faith has something faith speaks of something so it's well i don't know i'm just i'm just hopefully this works i'm just kind of trusting that it's gonna work well you have to be very careful how you characterize faith because it's saying you can't just headlong plunge into something with faith if you don't know where you're plunging you've got to know that's what faith tells you i know now you may you may not know the next step you may not know just exactly how things are going to unfold but at least faith has to be be behind that step what is motivating to make this step faith is and you've got to know where faith is wanting you to step and what faith is wanting you to do you have to know where you stand in order to stand therefore he says you've got to know and if our faith is set right and in the right position it gives constant satisfaction remember how we identified that earlier how that when our faith is set right and in the right position then that's what gives us the contentment that's what just doesn't give us the moment flash in a pan boy that felt good but the constant steady consistent satisfaction gives us constant satisfaction that's what we want we want constant satisfaction i don't want just the highs and the lows and the highs and the lows i want something just to be steady a trajectory that's rising i may have my dips here and there but i know that this is trending the right direction it gives a constant satisfaction now to put this in context again i just i feel impressed to remind you that we're looking at this in terms of relationships you know the whole trajectory of how we arrived at this very subject was i felt this impressed that in the beginning god created a family and that the family unit uh even us as hus husbands to wives and that marital relationship and the children that i will bless the union that this is something that god was achieving and that is a picture of god it is a masterpiece and so our the our god-likeness is manifest in relationships and how we love our spouse and how we raise our children and god is achieving that on this family level and then the church itself is a family and there's a way that we ought to function and the way that we're mutually accountable and there's ways that god has made manifest to the relationships we have within the church and so it was it seemed as if we would very quickly enter into maybe teaching on the family where we could just say this is rule number one this is rule number two this is rule number three if you're raising girls this is what you need to do if you're raising boys this is what you need to do and this is church we're gonna lay down church order and maybe it was kind of like this thought was well here we go better get out the rule book because we're about to get it and nothing against that that was even in my own mind i thought well maybe the lord's going to lead me into this area and we may be very very specific but god immediately dealt with my heart with it's complicated that everyone even myself and i begin to think about well there's these rules and these these ways to do things and these are these uh platitudes or these are these responsibilities and these are descriptions and you can get it in your mind and realize very quickly that we all need to be reminded that every single one of us have a different background right i mean that should be the easy amen right i mean even if we had a twin but you know it's been a little bit different for them because i'm on this side of the room they're on that side of the room it's been different and and there's really everyone has a different unique perspective of different things and so one we could be viewing something one way somebody else can be viewing something from another way and we can all have our own filters and we could even be producing a filtered uh uh expression and so we look at things are complicated especially in the day and age that we're living in now where things just aren't neat and tidy and clean cut and we can all just say everybody who takes this side everybody get across the line and stand over here and you start really looking at the situation you go well where in the where is the line this is complicated and so i want to bring it back to this this the context that we're consider consider this principle of consistency when it comes to our relationships consider this principle of consistency when it comes to family and how we wisdom is the principal thing and so well what do i need to raise children we need wisdom what do i need to love my wife we need wisdom and we don't characterize in the way well oh these are some real brutes or boys she's a doozy i really need wisdom but no that there's this there's a sense of i want it to be right i want it to be the right thing and it's complicated and there's my emotions get in the way and she goes through difficult things or my children are acting out and i just don't want to be harsh and in rigid i need wisdom in this situation so many opportunities present themselves should we buy this should we allow our children to do that is this something that's harmful and that we can be bombarded with so many different questions what we need is wisdom and so pondered this as a foundation not for a future sermon but right now ponder this as a foundation for examining whether we are providing model behavior that our as a parent the most uh the most effective well i could just say the thing that is most instructive i got i just want to think about just the right way to say this what our children are going to follow first is the example we set and we've arrived at this a number of times in our own family that something happens and really the explanation is well that's what you do and it's like well um that's what adults do but children children look at says well if dad does it then then then i can do it and they're not doing it to be greedy they're not doing it to be foul they're not doing it to be disobedient but it's just they see a certain activity they see something that's done they see a way that something is handled or addressed or even you go to the refrigerator you open up you eat whatever you want whenever you want the children think hey i'm hungry right and then they go and they grab the milk and they pour a bowl of cereal it's like why are you getting a bowl of cereal what dad did it it's like well he can have a midnight snack if he wants and you have to teach the children just because they're certain when you say well just because we did it you shouldn't do it right that right away that causes conflict because when we have the attitude with our children do as i say not as i do this is going to get really confusing because wisdom has consistency something constant it has a footing or a basis if there's consistency if you're if if you're launching from the same spot then the the a similar power ought to produce a similar result if all the parameters are the same if things are consistent then you can produce consistent uh fruits i was pondering again i just uh i say again it was just something i had studied before and it may be administered on in the past how that if you're going to compare uh the financials of a company they can't be on a cash basis one month or one quarter and an accrual basis on the next and be able to say wow they really did good this quarter you're not even comparing the same thing anymore if they're booking debt as soon as it's incurred or they're booking out profits as soon as it's billed in one month but then the next month they're not then you're going to get completely different outcomes there needs to be a consistent method of accounting from period to period in order for the results to make any sense and so if we're if we're going to achieve the right kind of results and understand what's taking place and be able to measure whether or not we're looking at the fruits of righteousness then there has to be something constant something steady something consistent where we have a basis and we have a footing upon which we're established and this conflict between our command and our conduct creates inconsistency i know i told you to do that and i did something just do as i say not as i do this is something where we need to ask ourselves in what i'm requiring and what i'm commanding is there a sufficient understanding in terms of my conduct so that they know that what's being required of them what's behind it and what we're asking of them and how what i'm doing is different not contradictory not inconsistent but it's different from what we're asking them to do and we realize well it's a lot more than just writing out rules on a piece of paper and making sure they can read them we're just pondering this this this consistency the bible says in ephesians chapter 5 verse 1 be therefore followers of god as dear children what is the explicit implication of this that children follow so it says we ought to follow god the same way that we as children follow our parents even paul says be therefore followers of me as i am of god why it's it's in the nature of one to follow their father to follow their mother to do what mom does to do what dad does this is instinctive within children and yes we may take it within our hearts in this situation to realize it says be you followers of god so then god provides the model behavior and so we're to follow god as children follow their parents but let's consider this how we as parents then ought to be modeling the correct kind of behavior for our children and notice how james deals with this issue or is setting this as the foundation when he begins to deal with wisdom in james chapter 3 it says in james chapter 1 verses 16 to 17 if we're going to be followers of god as children who model the behavior of their parents he says do not err my beloved brethren and this is how we can be sure that we're not making mistakes and how that we're not airing every good every good gift and every perfect gift is from above remember how we evaluate wisdom from above being pure and peaceable and gentle and without hypocrisy and full of good fruits and full of mercy saying every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning there's no variation in his light where light can be obstructed and light can wane and light can get greater and light can get weaker he's saying there is no variableness there is no dim switch with god there's he is always at a particular intensity there's this brightness there's this shining forth that there's no shadow of turning with god he's not hot and then cold he's not bright and then dark he's within god and his essential character is there's no variableness there's no changing there's no inconsistency there's no up there's no doubt there's neither shadow of turning god is the same yesterday today and forever and so when we're told be therefore followers of god is dear children in other words he is going to provide a consistency a solidness and a stability that we as children can rely on and what does that produce in children of god confidence and growth and maturity because they're relying upon a god who provides model behavior which will never fail them with the wrong kind of example so god is there's no variableness there's neither shadow of turning be therefore followers of god then malachi chapter 3 verse 6 says for i am the lord i change not even if it appears as if if you looked in the context even if it appears as if i'm not judging like i ought to or or i'm blessing when you don't think that i should or or where there should be a blessing i'm actually bringing judgment he's saying i am the lord i change not in other words divine nature is consistent divine nature is constant there's no variable there's no shadow of turning and he's saying that i am the lord and i change not my word ever remains the same my reasons for doing something my standard never changes that you cannot change the word if i do something what i do does not change my word we cannot let be left to wrestle and try to figure these things out and think that god is undoing his own principles he says i am the lord i change not there's no variableness in me there's no shadow turning any james is saying don't air brother if something is perfect if something is unchanging if something is good that has to come from god that we're to be followers of god we're challenging ourselves as we think about how we we are providing as as husband or as parent as spouse or parent and in our relationships to one another is my behaviors my conduct sufficient to convey the right things to convey even what's in our heart i'm the lord i change not now this brings us to exodus chapter 32. we read this in the beginning as our as our text exodus chapter 32 verses 9 to 14. we're to follow god we're saying that god provides a consistent example no variableness no shadow of turning divine nature is constant it's consistent the word never changes i am the lord i change not and it says and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiff-necked people now therefore let me alone get out of my way let me do what i want to do that my wrath may wax hot against them and then i may consume them i'm going to utterly destroy these people and i will make v a great nation i will start all over will bring forth a nation but let me destroy these these millions however it would have been let me however many it would have been let me consume them and destroy them this is this seems to be god's judgment god is saying let me do this he says if you will like let me alone that i may pour out my vengeance upon them and consume them and utterly destroy them and start all over so it appears as if god says i am going to destroy them then in verse 11 and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with the mighty hand moses is now standing in the gap he's he's pleading on behalf of the people and he's reminding god that god why are you angry to destroy these people when you're the one that's preserved them and you're the one that brought them out of egypt and it's been your mighty hand that's preserved us thus far and then he speaks something that i think is very profound wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and consume them from the face of the earth in other words if this happens god this is what the objections are going to say why would you do something that would cause the egyptians to say they trusted in their god and he led them into the wilderness just to utterly destroy them and completely wipe them out to slay them in the mountains so he says turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people all right if you're a prophet maybe you can say that you're right so all of us not being prophets let's be very careful before we write that down and say let's remember that we can tell god to repent of these judgments that you're pouring out in my life but it it's it's him expressing now god could would you turn away would you would you change your actions because repentance is used of god but certainly not the same way it's used of man god does not experience unease or pain with how he feels god does not experience the change of mind as we would experience in terms of repentance but he's saying god would you change your action would you stop what you're wanting to do he says remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou swearst by thy own self and set us unto them i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i've spoken of will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it forever what moses is raising and what he is bringing up is not politics pretense feeling and emotion and pulling on god's heartstrings he's just simply stating what the word has already said amen it's actually just telling god what he's already done you brought him out by a mighty hand you've preserved him you've brought us here you made the promise and he's just bringing the word back up that is the absolute that is the standard that is the principle and he's not getting all emotional and appealing to god's feelings and god's emotions and saying oh this would be horrible think about everybody they'll be crying think of how smelly it will be and think about this and think about that no he's just bringing god right back to the word and says the lord repented of the evil which he had thought to do unto his people i recognize this as a paradox and i'm not going to labor to unpack this in a way to where we can all go home saying that makes perfect sense i like that that's good and resolve it for you i want to identify that this is a paradox but understand this the perfectly wise god did not change his mind the word was not changed his intent had not changed as a matter of fact moses is just speaking what god's intent was move out of my way so i could destroy these people and moses is saying well i know what your intent is because you said it you brought us here and you didn't just bring us out here to destroy us you made a promise to abraham isaac and jacob that you would bring their seed into a land and that they would multiply and inherit this land forever and so god did not change his mind or his intent or his overall objective but he changed his way notice he changed what he had suggested to moses he was going to do he made a statement that made that gave moses the the understanding that god was going to do this god did not change his mind about his word god did not reverse course and he's like you know what i changed my mind but he changed what he was going to do from the perspective of moses because god is perfectly wise and unchangeable in his nature and his mind and his thoughts and in his counsels so this is what i want you to consider then in order for god to say what he had said and then repent of the evil which he thought to do unto his people there must be a divine wisdom expressed in this change of course right yeah i mean i don't know if you're all saying nope we're there and sorry wrong like you you wish you had that buzzer okay let me try again let me say it another way i'm trying to force you to nod or say amen but if god says i'm going to destroy these people moses stands in the gap and then most and god says okay i won't do it then god has not just been compelled by moses to compromise we'll find moses let's see if it works out buddy and this will all be on you let's see how this well fine you want to do it go ahead then have your way moses ooh mr big shot prophet no there must be some wisdom not god well i guess moses is going to fight me on this i got to give in there must have been some divine wisdom or an expression of a divine attribute in god saying okay i won't do it does that make sense individually just ponder your own selves that this isn't god changing his mind but there must be some wisdom and god's saying this is what i'm going to do and then he says he's not going to do that there must be something divine unchangeable and immutable in god's decision that helps me out even if i'm not quite sure well this seems to be a paradox he said he was going to do one thing and he did another there must be some wisdom in this and this is what i want to the point i want to bring it to as we just bring this to a close tonight that often this is what god did often we try to achieve consistency through rigidness and through harshness and we call it discipline we want to be consistent so we make a rule we got to stick to it this is what we've got to do and we've got to always do it because if we don't always do it this way we're going to cause problems and so we want to have consistency so we're going to achieve consistency through discipline through harshness setting the schedule right the rules being very very rigid in these things because we need to do this we need to do that in order to be successful and we set all these parameters in order to do that and what we do is we achieve consistency for the sake of consistency that's all we've done we've achieved it but our goal was consistency and and the goal of consistency is not consistency we're well we're consistent so what did you produce consistency well why are you consistent because we want to be consistent and it's just kind of like chasing your tail well at least we're doing the same thing every day over and over and over again it's like well where are you going what are you doing are you making a stand we're consistent aren't we we're consistent we do the same thing every day we get about 5 o'clock we do this we do this consistent but then we don't want to be consistent just for the sake of consistency we're achieving consistency for the sake of consistency and not consistency because that's the fruit of wisdom in other words wisdom will produce consistency but an undying unflinching fortitude to be consistent can produce consistency and it not be wisdom and the unchanging wise god exhibits grace and meekness in his quote unquote repenting we would say the unchanging god if he says he's going to destroy you then he must in order to be revered as god and respected as god he must destroy you and we would have advised god not as a prophet but as his counselors say lord you said you would consume them off the face of the earth despite moses objection if you're going to be respected as god you ought to destroy the people from the face of the earth because you should be consistent and god is demonstrating a meekness of wisdom he's demonstrating how that the heart must be established with grace that that is how a heart is established with grace not cursing and if you make cursing and punishment and condemnation the basis upon which you want to establish your family and establish discipline and establish your children that is not the meekness of wisdom that will produce a lot of curses not a lot of blessing because the heart must be established in grace god's decision that he would destroy the people from the face of the earth that i may consume them and then him to say that he has repented of the evil which he thought to do in his people this was not something that was inconsistent his decision or what we might call a reversal now the point of this deeply his decision to not consume them could not be the cause of future rebellion i like it you're thinking very very deep i'm getting more raised eyebrows like okay say on we'll give you a few more minutes yet think about it god's decision could not be the seeds of their future rebellion god's saying i'm going to consume you off the face of the earth this is god's decision there must be a wisdom behind it but that in itself would not be the impetus the provoking and the opportunity or the the the power for them to then despise god and turn against god no this is a grace that afforded them the power to get it right this is the grace that gave them an opportunity to do that which was pleasing in his sight so god's decision could not be the cause of a future failure so that way even though he may have changed his course not changed his mind changed his word changed his character he didn't do any of those things but for him to say now i won't do what i said would not be the reason that the children of israel would fail to live by the word i hope that makes sense and so when we look at our own selves and however way that you can apply this but i would say this certainly has a great context for family the goal of instruction and correction is to form the right character this is what the word wants to do not just to get us all to conform to a form but rather to transform our minds to transform our hearts so the goal of instruction and correction in the word and the house of god in ministry however you want to look at it in terms of the spiritual family of god the goal of instruction and correction as parents is to form the right kind of internal mechanisms or character within the heart of the child not external compliance it is a good thing that the heart be established in grace not in meats not in laws and legalism but the heart be established made firm through the consistency and the meekness of wisdom so when we teach when we instruct and when we're learning as a family we're learning as children of god the goal is to form the right kind of internal character not just external compliance in order to do that we must find the heart of god in order to do that we must connect with the same principle the same divine attribute that was inside of god that found a place that when it looked like god ought to consume the people the wisdom of god was not to if it had been divine if it had been the right thing if it had been what would be the attribute of god to consume the people then what would have happened moses could have objected all day long god would have said stand aside we must find the heart of god we must be connected with the thought or the principle or the wisdom behind the word the logos of the word in not just the letter of the law or the rhema of the law that it can be spelled out exactly this way if there's a law that is written if there's a word that is given and we can understand it with our ears we can begin to contemplate it with our minds and we could write it out and we could do it a hundred times on the chalkboard or we could read it and print it out quote it we know the scripture what we want to be connected with is not just the framework of the words and the letters that are there before us to tell us what the rule is but we want to know the thought and the intent of the rule itself because we do not desire just to be technically compliant we want to catch the spirit of the word and be in harmony with the spirit behind it i don't want to just get everything right technically i want to get right spiritually i want to be right in the in the motive behind it the objective behind it i just want to well i'm doing the right things everybody is going in the right way i want to have the life behind it the nature behind it the character behind it and we must find the heart of god to do that because legalism will never accomplish what wisdom does it'll never do i don't care if it looks like it does legalism law will never accomplish what wisdom does i'll say it this way you don't need force if you have wisdom you can say may the force be with you i want wisdom to be with me you don't need force if you have the wisdom of the word you don't need authority if you have the power of faith when i say authoritative the authority that's rooted in a carnal position we achieve our objectives whatever our goals may be whatever we think the right thing to do we achieve it by finding faith and acting in the character of christ we don't do it by privilege we don't do it by opportunity we don't do it by power this speaks to men within their relationships it speaks to fathers to their children it speaks to leaders it speaks to us as parents and spouses if we're in a position of authority or position of control we never accomplish our objectives by privilege or opportunity or advantage we do it by faith in the word of god and in the character of christ if we do it by the letter of the law and the authority that i have and i believe i have and by the privilege and opportunity and the advantage i have over somebody else to achieve a particular result and i have not done it in the character character of christ what i'm producing is a wolf in sheep's clothing i can actually produce one who is compliant externally but has not been molded internally to maintain the facade oswald chambers makes this statement i'm not sure exactly i failed to note this exactly where he says this in my utmost for his highest i believe it's in one of the daily devotions this is going to be heavy-hitting are you ready most of us are not consistent spiritually are you ready because we're more concerned about being consistent externally that's powerful most of us are not consistent spiritually because we're more concerned about being consistent outwardly we're more concerned about the optics how things look and how things are perceived and doing things externally and making sure everything is done right externally and we've never quite actually regarded how we could be consistent internally and really if you're doing that you're gonna run out of gas eventually because you're trying in your flesh to be perfect in your flesh and you're gonna the war of attrition is gonna wear you down eventually gonna run out of willpower and you're going to crash and you're going to be inconsistent why because you're only trying to maintain consistently consistency externally and he says most of us are consistent inconsistent spiritually because we're more concerned about being consistent outwardly or externally and what happens is we apply the word inconsistently oh we actually fail to catch the wisdom of what we're trying to apply like real what's the think about it we know certain things that god says this is what must be done there are certain things in the message that we really can't argue about and when we do argue we're really just wrestling with the implications or the consequences or this just doesn't seem fair so we're wrestling in terms of justice and fairness not with the actual explicit prescription of the word and so what's missing an understanding of the wisdom behind it because if god said it had to be a certain way there has to be some wisdom behind it if god said we had to do something there has to be some wisdom behind it well why would someone need to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ well we know the bible says to do that and if we never achieve a wisdom or understanding behind it if we're wrestling with it we're wrestling with the understanding of why not the fact that it is kind of like one of my favorite i think it's far side we're not asking how we already know how what we want to know now is why why now brown cow and that was going to be the title of my sermon and i shared it with my wife and went right over her head and i am not going to title my sermon why now brown cow when people don't even know how now brown cow most of us are not consistent spiritually because we're more concerned about being consistent externally paul said it it's a good thing that the heart be established in grace not in meats we ought not to be so concerned about making sure the external technical compliance is made outwardly but we ought to know even inwardly ourselves the things we're applying the things that we're doing for ourselves or even the standards that we're trying to elicit and get others to follow whether it be in raising children or how that we love our spouses how we interact with one another and how we address certain situations and how we overcome difficult uh circumstances we want to know the wisdom behind what god is asking us to do and we ought to know the wisdom behind it because if we can kind of catch that and be connected with the wisdom and the heart of god behind it the next time we find ourselves in a similar situation if we know the wisdom then we may know that this time a different approach is necessary let me give you an example we teach children not to lie i know few do we teach our children not to lie and then teaching them not to lie we typically punish lying very severely and so we have this standard if you lie you're going to be punished and so you have a standard and then you have a you have a consequence for not meeting the standard and this is one way that i had been instructed and it seemed to really stick out to sister elizabeth and i when we begin to raise children is this idea of that you don't want to be a threatening repeating parent like if you make a threat then you want to follow through with it and so that's the standard right if you make a threat then you better follow through with it because if you don't you are characterized as this weak threatening repeating parent and so god in exodus 32 became the weak threatening repeating parent because he didn't do it the first time he didn't do it he didn't he didn't enforce it he didn't follow through with what he was wanting to do but follow through for the sake of follow through we'll miss the mark if all we're wanting to achieve is follow through so we say you better do this and if you don't you're going to be punished if we don't if we don't understand the motive and objective the reason behind why we're requiring of them then how can we ever expect them to ever achieve the right kind of obedience to what we're asking them to do you better make your bed when you get up in the morning if you don't do it i'm going to spank you and you wake up in the morning you find out the bed's not made i'm like oh i guess i better spank you all right that's the first thing you're going to do every day probably forever because after a while the kids are like you know what i'm kind of used to this by now so they're just going to walk into the room and go what do you want i'm not making my bed so spank me right i guess i can't be a threatening repeating parent what does it become follow through for the sake of follow through and we miss the mark when we ourselves don't understand the wisdom of our instruction or there's actually no wisdom in our instruction think about that you better do this or else and the better do this has no wisdom behind it has no goal you've merely created an opportunity to spank somebody to discipline somebody to chastise somebody you've created an opportunity for your child to fail and then teach them that when they fail you come down hard well let's just think about that for a moment we're all children now this is no we're not talking we're not you know we're all just children our parents won't hear this right that's not very nice is it do we feel good when that happens i admired it even preston last i think it was last night there was something a comment that i made and i made some kind of assessment about the children's recent behavior and preston started talking about it and expressing things got very very talkative and we're trying to work through with what he's expressing and finally says dad it really doesn't make us feel good when you say that and i was like now that is profound as we work through it in the end he was just trying to say dad when you say that and i realize you know what exactly that's exactly right what i said would never make a child feel good a child i can hear that and go dad i just can't wait to obey you i just can't wait to do things right i'm just man you've really empowered me i can't wait till tomorrow morning and make my bed all right you because you've destroyed their will you you've compromised them you actually set them up for failure and you're surprised when they fail your master is setting up parents pat yourself on the back you are incredible and doing the bumps that spike on your kids our consistency then our our instruction our correction our consistency i might even say our consistency must be based in truth there must be wisdom behind it it must be connected with the principle of true wisdom otherwise that is exactly what we're setting up as a situation for conflict and aggression and disappointment and frustration i asked you to do this and you didn't do it and this is the consequence for it when sometimes we need to revisit what was the wisdom and ask in it listen our standard is not to ever be a threatening repeating parent our our our our standard is when i give an instruction may there be wisdom behind it so that when i require correction for not obeying it we're enforcing some principle behind it does it make sense as we teach our children not to lie this is a quote from a study said in studies scholars find that kids who live in threat of consistent punishment don't lie less instead they become better liars now think about this if you're always threatening your kids that if they lie they get punished and you follow through you do not achieve honesty you achieve better lying because you've upped the ante the risk is real high now that if i don't tell the truth it's going to hurt when i've lied so in order to avoid the consequence you've got to be better at lying not more in more coaxed and encouraged and to tell the truth come on somebody that people should be running the aisles right now speaking in tongues whatever it is doing the whirly i mean this is something that excite us i'm not actually asking anybody to do that i'm just saying this is something there should be wow amen praise god yes i believe that that's true i've been missing that so the type of parents who are lied to the least had rules and enforced them consistently but they found a way to be flexible that allowed the rule setting process to still be respected now this is just what they found in observing parents this is what they found in observing the way that parents were raising their children i'd love to get into this more and maybe expound upon i actually pulled some things out thinking that if the lord would lead us maybe we'd get into more specifics about this next wednesday but they found that rigid unbending parents who who were always in their psychological way trying to impose discipline and force their kids to do things they actually had teen teenagers who were obedient they achieved obedience but they found the kids were depressed they weren't happy i tell you what if there's anything i want my children to be i want them to be free in their spirits and i want them to be happy and i don't want everyone to say oh my brother aaron and sister elizabeth really got their kids in line so everybody looks at it on the outside and it's like look at them they look good they do exactly what they're told and my children and themselves and their hearts and in their spirits don't feel safe and aren't happy if you want to stabilize your family relationships if you want to stabilize your family tap into the consistency of wisdom when we say wisdom is consistent it means there's stable footing it means there's a solid foundation that is the basis for my action that is the basis for my thought that is the basis for my instruction therefore it's what i'm enforcing in my correction is there an amen invite the musicians to come but although if you want to play the acoustic guitar he'd welcome you to do that with a mic if you come i want to read one last statement to you in the message looking at the unseen when a man once catches that vision of the invisible god now i want to use this i want to emphasize this the vision of the invisible god this is an understanding a perception of tapping into connecting with the unchangeable god that when you could ever get a revelation of god and know that he's always present so there's something about tapping in and connecting to the present god recognizing his presence recognizing his character being connected to his eternal wisdom and feeling the heart of god he says there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and trouble it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the unseen yet by promise and in this in this vision wherein we we look at a circumstance where a man must be in a distress and trouble but yet he's caught a revelation of the invisible god and that he's with him then he's looking at the things that are invisible and then it allows him in a time of distress and trouble to be stabilized in his thoughts and in his actions now i want to take this and apply it to life that if at a time of distress and trouble a revelation of this invisible god stabilizes thinking and it stabilizes action then it'll do the same thing every time in any situation when you can tap into the heart of god and be connected with the truth and the principle of god's character in and act by faith and do it in the character of christ it stabilizes your actions and it stabilizes your thinking and this should be the number one principle that governs our lives that i want to exercise the wisdom of christ i want to live a life that exhibits the meekness of christ i don't want to just be technically and compliant and be a wolf in sheep's clothing and everyone i come in contact with feels as if they've been bitten and my excuse well those are the marks of truth i want to have and exhibit the life of christ [Music] where i'm not always apologizing for biting you and up and down and up and down but because i catch the heart of god and it's not just the rules that i'm trying to apply in rules that aren't followed i will result in consequences but that i understand the wisdom behind it god why did you ask me to teach raise my boys this way god why are you asking me as a man to live this way god why do you have standards for the sisters and standards for the women i want to understand the reason behind it i want to understand the wisdom behind it so that when i require it of others i'm not just merely slapping their hand because they didn't obey but that i can impart the reasons and the wisdom behind it in order to make a stand for truth and not just the external consistency i want him to i want to be stabilized in my thinking and my action especially in the times of trouble and distress so i need a vision of god i need to tap into the heart of god let us stand this evening [Music] i know you desire to pray in a moment like this [Music] you might say wow i was strong [Music] that was that was heavy that was heavy it's times like this that i believe we can go to god and expect expect grace and expect kindness expect a a nurturing that maybe we did not learn to anticipate from our natural parents but the word that has been expressed tonight if it's corrective if it if it seemed cutting remember it's the wisdom of god that wants to promote happiness and joy and liberty not shame not not a broken character and a broken spirit that can be manipulated and abused but god would only correct us tonight and expose oh i've been operating under this wrong kind of influences i've done a lot of things that weren't wise and i've maybe been more trying to be consistent externally instead of finding tapping into the real wisdom of god that produces the consistency there's no shame tonight i'm trying to create a scenario where everyone looks around the other person if there's ever been a word that described that family brother aaron found it tonight inconsistent let's let go of that let's not worry about what everybody else thinks and certainly don't be afraid of what god thinks tonight and let's find let's find his forgiveness as we pray let's find his encouragement our gracious heavenly father i thank you that you could speak plainly to us i think that there's a liberty that we can even tackle [Music] some of the myths that we've developed in our own theology how that the right thing uh it was there seemingly in principle even with the idea that well i i don't want to be the kind of parent that's saying you ought to do this and if you don't do it this is going to happen and all we do is threaten and repeat and we never actually we start counting down and we start the countdown all over again lord that principle even in itself is not used to teach us to use the switch when we get to zero [Music] but it ought to cause us to question why we even have a countdown [Music] i pray lord that we would be challenged in our misconceptions our preconceived ideas our patterns our habits even our methodology that we use to try to [Music] bring bring discipline and promote character lord i i would say i i'm not speaking a thing against the method lord but i believe that we ought to challenge ourselves whether or not we've tapped into the wisdom of it and ask ourselves if it's not producing what it should am i misunderstanding the wisdom behind it or is there even any wisdom to begin within it lord i know your word is true and i know there's a wisdom behind it and i believe that there's safety and merely obeying it even if we don't understand it the lord just as much as you inspire us and promise us that the spirit which we have received will lead us and guide us into all truth and that we will give receive understanding and that we will we will know it and we will understand it more deeply and more consistently this is how we relate to you as children that you will reveal yourself and will gain a deeper understanding of your word as we follow you as dear children that we then can also in our relationships one with another not just have a standard that the other might meet but have a patience and a grace to express to them why we want this standard why we want to see this kind of conduct why would my wife take the time to say honey i need to see this sir i love it when you do this to have this kind of instinct to say lord let me know her heart let me understand their heart let me understand my children let me understand my spouse to know what need it is i'm meeting not just be technically and compliant or all these robots just acting out consistent externally but missing the grain and the kernel internally i pray that you help us tonight lord i know it's plain i know in some ways it's very very direct and explicit but we're just provoking [Music] desiring lord in our hearts to provoke sons and daughters of god to examine themselves and ask like solomon for wisdom bless your people tonight we commit them to you i thank you for the kind of expectation and pull that's been exhibited from the heart of these believers lord i can testify as your servant that it's absolutely pleasing to you may they sense your your love and grace tonight may they sense your own patience with them as these principles are elicited and these things in your word are lifted up and may we as your children not despair be depressed but experience liberty and freedom in our spirits not misinterpreting what you've been doing in our lives and producing the complexes that were produced when we experienced correction and admonishment and instruction naturally but now realize we're in a total different kind of paradigm we're exhibiting we're experiencing something totally different and that we could challenge our complexes and challenge our disposition and say no i can lift up these hands that have been chastised i can lift up praise i can lift up my head and believe that my god has my best in mind that my god is provoked promoting the right kind of virtues and the things that he's changing in my life and not leave here depressed and discouraged but lord shoulders back and empowered the sons and daughters of god to do the right thing we receive your wisdom in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
