TRANSCRIPT
========================================
continuing on the subject of the big three I thought it would just be one sermon it's now we're on part three we'll probably continue on this for a little bit uh on Wednesday night we had a very simple thought we wanted to show how that when brother brandham talks about money women and popularity that there is a connection with those different things with the big three and we'll look at those very quickly here in 1 John Chapter 2 and when brother brandham says that these money women in popularity even though he raises it in the context of ministers it is something that is applicable to all of us because when we look into the scripture uh a pastor or Minister an elder a bishop they're all to be examples and examples because what they teach is the word of God and that we're all to we're all Desiring to come into that image of the word or Express the word or uh obey the word of God that we um he that heareth the word and then does the word that's what we want to be and so it's not just a higher calling because they're preaching the word but it's a higher calling to preach the word that we are to become so they themselves cannot be in contradiction with it otherwise it undermines their Doctrine or their teaching and as the Bible says the throne must be established in righteousness there's a lot that we could share how that uh teaching is is good and and and it's effective and there's those that will be able to receive it and benefit by it but ultimately what God wants is not only for the word to be rightly divided but for us to rightly live the word and so the application of the Temptation or the test or the hindrance of money women and popularity to minister we can all take instruction from and realize it in some ways we're going to be tempted in those Avenues in 1 John chapter 2: 16 that was my Wednesday night sermon and some of you who are there are going oh well why don't you just say that in 1 John chap 2:16 it says for all that is in the world world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world continues to say but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever so we know that it's in the doing of the word living the word wherein we have that security but the world is comprised of the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life I'm saying this is the big three he's saying all that is in the world and he puts it under these three headings or these three different classifications we could say that well this is this is the big three that the world is comprised of and it's connected with the Temptation in the garden of the woman we could see the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life it's connected with the temptation of Christ in the wilderness in each one we see the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life brother Brandon refers to those three Temptations in Harvest time if so these three represent the three Temptations of Jesus the three Temptations of a minister three Temptations of a church the three Temptations of an organization he says the three Temptations of an individual and each one he's saying how they fail or how they fall so it it may be seem very very simplistic we say there's only two forces faith and doubt and then we try to establish this metric to where everything we do is like well am I going for the lowfat because I doubt or should I go for the full fat because I believe and it's not necessarily binary in that way but there's faith and there's doubt and then there's ways that that uh operates and in this way it's not that're trying to divide everything in the world into three different categories but there's three uh things in the world that are the the Temptation that are the test or that all man will face and it's in these categories of lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life the lust of the flesh is that allowing the five senses of the body to control us where we we allow our hunger our thirst or something that pertains to the body to have preeminence where the body matters the most and Jesus says the body is more than food the body is more than meat life is more than me life and the body are more than food and rainment so he's talking about this uh imbalance of feeding the Flesh and the lust of the eyes it's allowing the eye to govern the body senses and even the spiritual senses of a person it's a coveting what is seen it's that uh Desiring for the things that satisfy the Flesh and things using that eye gate causing us to want to satisfy the lust of the eyes we saw that when the woman saw that the tree was pleasant to the eyes you saw the lust of the the flesh when she saw that it was good for food Christ turning the stones to bread was tempted to the lust of the flesh when he was showing all the kingdoms of the world he was tempted to the lust of the eyes and when he was told to cast himself down that was the pride of life and the woman herself seeing that it was to be desired to make one wise that's the pride of life the pride of life is a desire for recognition it's seeking honor or status and as I've looked at it and continued to study hoping maybe to take some time on each one of these in more detail and then also line it up with money women and popularity you can see how that this pride of life in some ways is hoping that through satisfying the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes it'll Advance your standing cause you to become accepted or or to have power because there's things that you do to satisfy the body and then there's things that we do to Adorn the Flesh and to satisfy the eye and in some ways there's this Vin diagram where they're overlapping and the pride life uh is feeding off these others to in the sense of how does it make me better and how can I appear to be righteous and how can people think I'm beautiful or have power I have a lot of followers and really when it comes to social media all you need is a filter and a bot and you can get a lot of followers so the big three it's the devil's satanic Trinity it's his schemes his attacks his methods in James chapter 3: 13 to1 18 I'm going to use this to pull from Matthew Chapter 13 go a little bit further and kind of this symmetry of the threes who is a wise man endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom this the the seed is the word of God as Jesus is teaching us even in that the wheat and the tears in that Parable the seed is the word of God the seed is the gospel that is sown and the seed is the word which bring brings forth fruit of righteousness so there's this A wise man who is endued with knowledge he will show this through a life and it demonstrates the meekness of wisdom but if you have bitter envy and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but as Earthly sensual devilish for where envy and strife is there's confusion in every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is swn in peace of them that make peace so this is the seed that is sown is to find good ground and bring forth fruit unto Perfection or fruit of righteousness but Satan tries to take it away or the flesh is offended by that word or the world tries to choke it out the world is the word is to produce good conversation works with meekness of the that demonstrate the meekness of wisdom but Satan wants to snatch the word out of your heart some of us become offended or the world just chokes it out but the wise man endued with true knowledge will show the word by the fruits of his life and so James immediately goes to but if you have bitter and Envy in your hearts Satan wants to seow a different seed he wants to produce bitter envi and and strife in order to bring forth the fruit of Confusion And every evil work so the seeds are bitter envy and the seed is Strife so that it can produce this confusion this chaos and evil works and all that is in the world we could say this connecting it with the big three all that is in the world is Earthly which pertains to the flesh sensual as it pertains to the eye in devilish as it pertains to the pride pride of life each one of these we can see that that which is from U below that descendeth not from above is Earthly it's the lust of the flesh it's it's sensual it's the lust of the eyes and it's devilish the pride of life uh it's a partner with that Pride that was in Lucifer in the beginning I believe these things just fit so well if you listen to the sermons on uh Power without character and the image of God that brother elizer are ministered just much more rich and full that you could go draw from that how that Satan had a perverted image of what God was he said I want to be like the most high a and the way the brother elzar uh demonstrated that I know some of you prob saying who's Brother elzar everyone calls him brother Eli but I call him brother elzer I like the name and there's a um uh this image that Satan had of God His image that he had in his mind his perception of God was perverted so what he wanted to become was perverted and so there's Satan has this desire this pride of life he has a the the Earthly flesh the sensual eyes and the sermon wisdom versus Faith as this this scripture and I think even brother brandham uses this scripture in that sermon how that this wisdom which is from above uh brother brother Reggie Reginald Ben David PL said or brother Ben brother Reggie there's a lot of we got to get them all cuz there's a different group here and some know you by different names brother PL PL he was sharing with me some quotes last week on that Trinity above which is uh cont pertains to God and that demonic Trinity from below and so it's those evil Things From Below those spirits and those demon powers and the devil that works from below H it's it's contrary to the wisdom that is from above and brother bramman wisdom versus Faith he says Satan could scientifically prove by his his wisdom that the soil he was going to give for the human race to grow in had vitamins so Satan has this ground or this this soil that he wants to grow the human uh race in he could scientifically prove it he said they can scientifically prove anything they want to almost so that's just where that's come to you can't trust them anymore the number of scientific articles and things that are retracted and studies which are fabricated it's just starting to get out of hand because there's no Integrity anymore but brother brandom in this sermon wisdom versus Faith he gives these different vitamins Satan's wisdom soil contains these vitamin vitamin P he says for pleasure and popularity vitamin C for common sense vitamin R for reasoning vitamin B for beauty vitamin M for modern you go and read it it's really interesting how he's showing these different vitamins are all in this soil in order to produce the crop that Satan wants to produce he says ultimately the most uh the one that's the maybe the strongest is the vitamin D death there's so much research around vitamin D uh in the natural but this vitamin P and vitamin C vitamin R Vitamin B and vitamin M the pleasure popularity Common Sense reasoning Beauty it's to be modern and then vitamin D death but brother Bram says but Faith only grows in one vitamin or vitamin it only has one vit vitamin don't have to have any mixture at all Faith grows in one vitamin that's the word that's the only thing that faith can grow in is the word and the only way that it can grow is because it believes the word and has to take all the word and it's believe it's true and Faith vitamin is spelled in a little four-letter word l i f life it has vitamin L faith has vitamin L life the word that's what faith uh that's all that it needs to grow because it believes the word and it's going to grow life so that's the most important thing is Faith and Faith growing by the word or growing by life that's the vitamin that we need now there's a lot of these other things that we are in the soil that we live in Pleasures popularity Common Sense reasoning Beauty and modern and ultimately death but we have to be very uh uh recognized that though might be getting these vitamins by the natural man we better be sure we're getting our vitamin L by the spiritual man in James 1: 13-1 17 says let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot temp be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed this there's just a formula here then when lost hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death true do not Heir my beloved Brethren every good and perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning you have the things that are from below that are Earthly sensual and devilish but now you have a wisdom which is from above every good and perfect gift is from above there's no shadow in it there's no variable and he says that we ought not to attribute our mistakes or our failures to God because God hath tempted us but every man is tempted when and here's the formula he's first drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when that lust hath conceived it brings forth sin and sin when it is finished it brings forth death you have the three stages one of lust one of sin and then death it ref refs how Satan works not only on the individual but also how he worked against the church and the church ages brother Bradman the church age book writes as Sin started in nothing but a feeling so the death to the church started with the simple little notice Deeds of the nicians it's important for us to recognize how that Satan first wants to get to us through the subtlety of sewing seed the subtlety of his vitamins the subtlety of things that we might think are harmless but if Satan can get that in the right kind of of soil and we can nurture it with the wrong kind of environment that it could bring forth the fruit that Satan desires to see and sin started with nothing but a feeling and we need to be very careful that we do not go by feelings because if we do that's where sin can start and in the church age book chapter 3 that other prior one was from the thyrian age in chapter 6 he goes through this step or formul it was called Deeds then it became a Doctrine we see this in the scripture that first it starts as a deed sin begins as a feeling it's just a a deed a little notice deed but once that deed kind of begins to have a little bit of preeminence and recognition then it becomes a Doctrine for now it's not just a feeling but it's you better have the same feeling it's not just a little deed it's now everyone has to do the same deeds and so it's called Deeds then it becomes a Doctrine listen he says it became the standard it became the unbending way it finally took over and God was pushed aside oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensively this is Satan's method of operation start with the feeling start something small start something simple and then once it starts to begin to work then make it the standard this is the way that it has to be this is the way that everyone has to do it then make it the unbending way so that when no one else is doing it they're immediately cut off or at least persecuted he says it looked good seemed good then it caught a hold like a python it squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality there was in the church oh that false Vine is subtle it is like an angel of Light until it gets a hold on you Deeds are feeling become Doctrine they become the law the standard the have to and it leads to death brother brandom said it became crowned in death Deeds Doctrine death lust sin death that's how the devil Works through lust these three Temptations these three uh three channels money women popularity the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life working to produce sin so that it can produce death and Jude uh verse 11 it says wo unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the heir of balum for reward and perished in the gain of Kora there a lot of threes when you begin to match these things up the way of Cain we can show is the lust of the eye the he of balam the lust of the flesh the gains saying of cor the pride of life they rebelled because they weren't given a position in the priesthood it's the pride of life why can't we be recognized why can't we have the opportunity Cain through the lust of the eye wanted something beautiful and pleasing and certainly it was swn into him genetically and the heir of balum the lust of the flesh remember part of overcoming is recognizing Satan and all of his tricks that we are to not be ignorant of his devices and so I know that in ministering on these things I'm not ministering anything new if anything it's repetition of things that we've often heard about lust and Temptation and struggles and trials but if there's a way that we can continue to expose how the devil works and make us more sensitive an alert in how he works in demonic Realms both religiously and spiritually and also through perversions in our flesh we can be better equipped ourselves to overcome them and hopefully what we then can do is learn by our own overcoming and Revelation how to protect the hearts of our children and to not lay a stumbling block in front of other people Wednesday night I believe we were leaving leaving off on this particular scripture in 1 Corinthians 10: 11- 14 now all these things happen unto them for amples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come the scriptures tell us the story in the Old Testament and then again in the New Testament especially in the Book of Revelation as prophecy so that they can be examples to us and admonish us we're we're told of The Exodus we're told of the failures and the prophecies and all sorts of things so that we can be we can learn from them wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth to take heed lest he fall there is a a great warning in that pride in which we think that we are secure and we can't be tempted and we won't make a mistake so he says be careful and he says not so much to condemn somebody from having confidence or to uh abandon us to the thought that well I can't think that I stand I guess I'm just going to fall and might as well accept the fall but he says there hath no temptation taken you but such as as common to man and we say Yes Man is tempted Christ was tempted in all points in like manner as we are Elijah even a man subject of like passions we see that there's something common to all men and women in terms of Temptation and weakness and things that the devil fights against us the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life we all fight with him but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it what a what a testimony that in all of these things God will make a way to escape that yes The Temptations will be present and we don't we could pray Lord I don't want to be tempted Lord I I let it not come near me let me just not see it let me avoid it altto together and I I'm not going to encourage you or counsel you not to pray in that manner but then we ought to have the kind of Faith to believe that if God would allow us to be tempted or that Satan would work his way near to us we find ourselves in the throws of some sort of Temptation to begin to look for God's way of now the Bible says they ran greedily after the error of balum for reward he becomes a very good character study especially in light of the fact that Paul says uh he that thinks he stands be careful lest he fall bam is a good example of that but then also there's no temptation taking you but such as common demand so there's this that balum had or maybe this security he began to feel that he thought that he could get away with something and then we could also say that whatever balum faced and whatever he was tempted with we likewise can be tempted too balum the word means not of the people and the scripture refers to him as a prophet but then there's also another place where he's referred to as a soothsayer or divver not necessarily one in a in a good way and if you look into the scriptures you'll find that God does speak to balum traditionally amongst the Israelites and their oral tradition and historically he was regarded as a great prophet who spoke things that came to pass as we'll see in the scripture that even Bao recognized that the words that balum spoke came true so in numbers chap 22:6 Bayo says come now therefore I pray thee to balam he has summoned him curse me this people people that's come up out of Egypt for they are too Mighty for me per Adventure I shall Prevail that we may Smite them and then I may drive them out of the land for I what that he whom thou has for I what that he whom thou blessed is blessed and him who thou curseth is cursed he knew that balum if he blessed someone they were blessed if they were cursed they were cursed so he's asking bam if he would curse these people he didn't know who they were and even balum is like I I don't know who these people are and so he says in verse 13 and balum Rose up in the OR balum goes before the Lord and the Lord says who are these people that come to you he says they've come to me and want me to curse this people that's come up out of Egypt and so God tells them uh speaks to him and then B balam comes back and says rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of Bao get you into your land go back for the Lord refuses to give me leave to go with you so bam is refusing to do what he was asked to curse this people that came up out of Egypt then in verse 17 Bao is going to try again he's saying curse them for I will promote thee un very great honor and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore I pray thee curse me this people now he's trying to not just plead to him that whatever you say seems to come to pass and I want to go to war against these people and I want to overthrow them so will you curse them and Bam's like well yeah let me go before the Lord let me find out whether or not I should he comes back and says the Lord told me not to go with you and so he says he's wants to try a different way and if you go back and read this F you'll see how Bayo each time is going to him and saying well here he says I'll promote thee and then he says well maybe if I do it over here or maybe if I do it over there and he's trying to move him around hoping that change your scenery will help he says the Lord refuseth me to leave you so he says well I will to go with you I promote Thee I will honor you you can have whatever I want you asked for bam answered and said now just think of this from the standpoint of we have no idea who balam is the unnamed prophet he says unto the Servants of bik if Bao would give me his house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God to do less or more wow all right balum you have another son name name him balum right this is this is sounding pretty good and he gets what Bao is saying because he says I'll give them to the great honor I give you whatever he could give me his house full of silver and gold and I won't go beyond what the word of the Lord says now therefore I pray you Terry ye also hear this night that I may know what the Lord will say unto me more and God came unto balam at night and said unto him now focus on this because we'll come back to this I think two more times if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which I shall say unto you thee Thou shalt thou do this is what he has to do whatever God says that shalt thou do don't do what you want do what I say say what I say bam rose up in the morning and Saddles ass and went with the princes of Moab so he's go he he gets up and he's going to go but he knows I can only say what God wants me to say if you read continue to read there and if you want to take time I'll just hit some highlights here balam never cursed Israel with his mouth there there's nothing on the face of this story is he even read it up to verse to end of chapter 24 to where it appears that balam accepts the bribe first he said hey will you curse these people and and and balum being a prophet says well I don't want to be too quick to curse him I don't want to be too quick to try to help you achieve your Victory so let me go before the Lord and the Lord tells him speaks to him so he goes back and says I can't go with you so then B and the princes try a different attack well you we ask for your help you don't want to help but what if we give you a lot of money what if we give you a house full of silver and gold and what if you do this he says I won't go beyond what God's told me to say no matter what you give me amen and in numbers 22:38 balam said unto B lo I am come unto thee have I now any power at all to say anything the word that God putteth in my mouth that shall I speak I mean this is bam is appearing to be a man of great character and integrity he seems to be one that's holding very closely to the word of God and wanting to honor the Lord and not deviate from it you can go into the message of the hour and find a lot great a lot more statements to this respect but in Numbers Chapter 23 he offers on seven altars seven Rams and seven oxen numerically correct his typology was correct he was offering I think brother bam says in some place he was more uh H as far as in his offerings and his typology and numerology more perfect than Moses so here he is seemingly hitting on all points and and doing these things to honor the word of the Lord and as balam is offering these seven Rams and seven oxen on seven altars in numbers 23: 4 and 5 and God met balum and he balum said unto him I have prepared seven altars and I've offered upon every altar a bulock and a ram think of what is what these things are testifying of what they're what they're foreshadowing and the Lord put a word in balam's mouth and said return unto Bao and thus Thou shalt speak nothing to this point suggests that balum will do anything other than say exactly what God put in his mouth sir and he does that you'll find that b brings him to three different places and and balum prophesies I believe four times ultimately the first Oracle the second Oracle the third and then the final Oracle and every time he's only saying what God would have him to say numbers 23:12 and he answered and said must not must I not take heed to speak that which the Lord hath put in my mouth verse 26 and 7 27 and balum answered and said unto BAC told not I Thee saying all that the Lord speaketh that I must do no words every time that bik asked him to curse after he became to tried to bribe him and take him to these different places and show him different things and after he prophesied blessing he said well come over with me over here to this high place and and try it here and he keeps trying these different ways to entice him and cause him to fall he said told not I Thee saying all that the Lord speaketh that I must do and Balo said unto balum come I pray thee I will bring thee Uno another place per Adventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from then once again he keeps trying it right I just want to kind of throw this out there at what point is balum sounding a lot like Samson like tell me what your secret is well if I eat a day old oatmeal I'll be sick what's for breakfast Delila day old oatmeal and it's like come on like wake up Samson and once again good God does not let balam curse Israel once again when balam opens his mouth blessings come out prophecies powerful things that are spoken it is balum who said God is not like God is not like the son of man to lie in numbers 24: 10 to14 we kind of see this boiling over and bik's anger was kindled against balum and he smote his hands together and Balo said unto balum I called thee to curse my enemies and behold thou has altogether blessed them these three times therefore now flee thou to thy place I thought to promote thee into great honor but Lo the Lord hath kept thee back from honor that's persuasive you could have been something if you could have just kept your if you could have just got happy with the way I did things you could have been it's kept you back from honor and balam said unto Bic spake I not also to thy Messengers which thou sent this unto me saying now it's going all the way back to the beginning if Bayo would give me his house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the Commandment of the Lord to do either good or bad of my own mind but what the Lord saith that will I speak and you'd have to go back and check the record and be like yep maybe Bayo says princes tell me Messengers tell me what did he say let's go check the tweets let's see see let's see exactly what he said in the DMS and it's go back says if he give me his house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the Commandment of the lord it's what he said and then the final Oracle balam says and now behold I go unto my people come therefore and I will advertise to thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days read the remainder of verse chapter 24 and he's speaking these great prophecies very specific things and to close out the chapter in verse 25 and balum Rose up and went and returned to his place and Bao also went his way we stop in the reading and this is where we get really the story of balum in reading this if we were to make this a subject of discussion or take this text and produce to us a character study or tell us your thoughts if we just said he's an unnamed prophet and change the tell in such a way to only to go by his actions in chapters 22 23 and 24 we would say that balum was a true Prophet who said only what God told him to say was not a word rejector was one that when he was speaking or preaching he seemed to be really in line and in harmony with the word of God there's a a lot that it appears to be correct and it his story ends with him apparently turning down Bao and as we read in the prophecies and go forward in history say balam is saying a lot of true things but then we read in Micah chap 6 verse5 oh my people remember now what Balo king of Moab consulted and what balum the son of beor answered him from sheum unto gilgal that ye may know the righteousness of the Lord God's correctness God's judgment God's justice remember Bayo in he tried to do remember balum how he answered from sheum under gilgal so Micah is kind of pointing us out something thank you Micah and and he's showing us something to think about with balum so when we go to sheum it says in numbers 25 veres 1 to5 balum has gone his way bik has gone the other way and the next thing we know in Israel Abode in shom and the people began to commit whoredom with the Daughters of Moab after all these blessings right after all these blessings upon Israel The Chosen the people the bride yeah he said they begin to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab and they called The People Under The sacrifices of their gods the daughters do this now and the people did eat starting there even with the lust of the Flesh and bowed down to their gods and Israel joined himself into Bel peor now there's a lot of Rich history on this and the message of the hour brings out the the wor the worst thing that they're doing and how they're joining themselves and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and the Lord said unto Moses take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the Lord against the Sun that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel now I just kind of let that wash over you a little bit this was a tremendous offense in all everything that was trying to do to get balam to curse the people of God and every time balum opens his mouth the people are blessed but now in just a very short time and we're not given the benefit and the scripture tells us like five days later a few moments later or whatever it might be it says now all of a sudden Israel's joined themselves to bayor and God is saying cut off all the heads and Moses send to the judges of Israel slay everyone his men that were joined joed under bpor kill your own people any one of them that were joined to that Feast any one of them that laid with that women any one of them cut their heads off the men did eat and they bowed and then they were killed started off as a deed then it became a doctorine then it became death immediately after numbers 24 Israel Falls in whoredom and idolatry immediately now I know what you're thinking this must have something to do with balum is that what you're thinking you guys are nervous do I play tricks too often one time I said if I told you that the tail of a horse was a leg how many legs does a horse have and how many four no matter what I tell you right a horse only has four legs and that's the kind of stuff maybe your thinking is happening right now bam I don't even know who you're talking about so let's go back to Numbers 22 and see if we can't find if God isn't already foreshadowing to us this lust that's in balam's heart verse 20 and God came unto balam at night and said unto him and this is after he is well I guess we'll we'll go back we'll see this and God came to balam at night and said to him if men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which I shall say unto thee Thou shalt do so that's what we focus on God's only say what I say and balum Rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of Moab and then verse 22 all of a sudden comes out of the middle of nowhere God's anger was kindled against he kindled because he went and the angel Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him and you know the story how that the the angel of Lord stands in the way and and the the donkey sees it and you know he ramming him up against the side doesn't want to go and finally it speaks to him says hey man I'm not going to go beyond this but God God speaks to him and he seems to say that well if they come to you rise up and go with them and then whatever I say you say but then God gets angry when balum gets up and goes God knew the greed that was in balam's heart now you might say well I can say that because that's how he's memorialized later so it's it's not like I'm you know God told me last night I said whoa what's happening here he says I I think he's greedy right it's in the scripture so God knew that there was greed in balam's heart and I want you to catch this now I want us to think about ourselves and judge ourselves by this there was something in balum where he still wanted to hold open the chance for Honor I I want to be careful how I deal with this guy because if I if I if I come on too strong or say too much maybe I won't get what he has to give me remember I was put in a situation one time where a particular brother was asking me to do do some work and there was things in my heart that began to check me not on the legality of it or anything like that but with respect to his character and I found myself Limited in being able to as a brother and as a friend challenge him or correct him or or be honest because this well I don't want to lose the job okay so this is something that's I think we can all draw from something in him wanted to hold up this CH the this opportunity for gain as brother elzer was preaching in power without character God knew the the motive of balam's soul that was a powerful statement when you said there's a lot of things that we're working through on the outward but God looks down and he sees the character the motive in Bam's Soul because as we're reading through this and and I'm not saying this to trick you I'm just saying it objectively and maybe for you subjectively as we read the story of balam from chapter 22 to chapter 24 just raise your hand if on the face he seems like he's doing a good job I mean all right for the rest of you we can talk about it and so there's but God sees something that maybe we don't see so in numbers 22:12 we're going back this is when God first speaks to balum about balo's plan and God said unto balum Thou shalt not go with them Thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed this is what balam knows so watch verse 13 and balum Rose up in the morning and said unto the prince of Bic get you into your land for the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you it's what he doesn't say which betrays what's in his heart he knows that Bayo wants him to curse Israel then Bic offers him honor and a lot of stuff to do it so he knows that God said don't go with them but he also said don't curse them but balam is somewhat Coy about it well let me go see what God will say pre- Adventure he might put words in my mouth that we curse Israel and I can get a house full of gold and silver balum voice will it work can we do a a skit with that and he says God doesn't want me to go with you but he doesn't tell them that God told him not to curse Israel because of greed now that those are my words it's what I'm deducing from scripture so what I'll say is that could it be that God saw into his soul and then so now watch this this is what God sees balam was dishonest at first he only told part of the story that's why when you look at the message of the hour we can focus all we want and just emphasize don't go don't go don't go but is also whatever you do don't curse and you've got to be balanced in the message of the hour or you can just start seeing the things that you like seeing these things and pulling them out and pulling them out and anymore the longer that you spend in the message in fellowship with certain people that come under some sort of fanaticism about some pet Doctrine or some ideal they can find millions of quotes just as scientists can scientifically prove to you anything they want to brandom mites can prove to you just about anything they want to using quotations of the Prophet but they do it dishonestly so verse 17 let me recap this Bic says balam I want you to curse this people that's come up out of Egypt they're great people I I'm afraid that I won't be able to spite them Smite them so curse them so I can Prevail over them I'm afraid of them balam goes to God and God says don't go with them and guess what I will never curse them Thou shalt not curse this people for they are blessed so you can't curse them because they're blessed how can you curse God is blessed this is God's words and then balum says well I can't go with you sorry and then there's the the promotion numbers 22: 17-2 for I will promote thee unto unto very great honor and and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me so balum withholds he he doesn't say I have been told that I cannot curse Israel for their blessed since he doesn't say that and he's held something back in his heart we see we're questioning his character at this point thinking well why did he what's going on here and I believe that Bao is kind of speaking to that a little bit says well I'll promote the into great honor and I'll do whatsoever thou say us enemies kind of probing testing come therefore I pray thee curse me this people and Bam and answered and said un the Servants of baleo it's almost like I don't know uh you know Brier rabbit oh please don't throw me into that Brier patch he could give me a whole house of silver and gold right makes you wonder but it it seems like yeah he gets it if Bao would give me his house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God to do less or more it sounds really really good but notice now therefore I pray that Terry you also he this night that I may know what the Lord will say unto me more help me out here balum don't go because you can't curse them because I've blessed them I mean what more needs to be said on this right I mean think about this in your life on certain things things that's God God's already spoken about the message is clear on it but we start trying to work things around a little bit well I don't know maybe so I don't know maybe we could do this maybe we should just all go back to Pentecost oh maybe we should just kick this out maybe we should just do this we should just brother Bon's been clear on the word is clear on it let me just go back and see if I can't rearrange his words a little bit right and God comes unto him at night and says verse 20 God came unto bam at night and said unto him if if the men came to call thee rise up if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which I shall say unto thee Thou shalt that thou shalt do and balum Rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went went with the princes of Moab now anybody catch it look at verse 20 verse 20 if the men come to call you if the men come to call you then go go with them but then speak only what I tell you to speak but balum as soon as he woke up that morning gets on his his da monkey and he goes to the princes of Moab they didn't come to him why didn't he wait why didn't he wait for them to come I wonder how early in the morning he rose up I wonder if he was kind of laying there going is that them is that the Russell is that them and it was it was just his ass every time moving around like when are these PRS going to show up but he jumps up he rationalizes and he go goes very innocently now because the question could be why in the world let me just see if I have it here why in the world would God get angry with balum when he told him to go it's because God didn't tell him to go he told him to go if and balum blows right past the if to the going and still says but I'll only say what the Lord wants me to say and God's mad at him God's angry why he sees the motive in balam's Soul he knows that bam has a weakness he knows there's something there in his heart that can be exploited and so he says you told him you cannot curse Israel but balum still kept coming around acting as if well let's just see let's just see let's just see if God will do it let's just see what will happen and he ran greedily after the princes of Moab hoping for riches hoping for reward I hope it's okay for me to say this I think I can amplify this more in the next service it was the lust of the flesh working on balum that perverted his decisions and you're thinking well okay I mean I get it we're all kind of susceptible here but at the end of the day what he spoke was right but balum succumbed to the temptation to help Bao because the lust of the flesh he was greedy for gain he wanted the money it had to do with appetite it had to do with the flesh so numbers 31: 15-6 this is after God has said that Israel Abode in sheet them and the people begin to commit hoard him with the daughters of Moab so God said Moses said to the people have you saved all the women alive these daughters behold these caused the children of Israel through the councel of balum and when you think about like well when I when I'm listening to what but when I heard what he was preaching well I don't I mean it seems like this fit and there's something something was off something was wrong he caused the children of Israel to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord what caused the children of Israel to commit trespass against the Lord the Council of balum read it the councel of balum yeah the emphasis the repetition the scheme the attack his interpretation it was the Council of balum that caused Israel to fall listen he couldn't open his mouth to curse him every time he prophesied God blessed him he couldn't help but lift up the bride he couldn't help but lift up The Messengers he couldn't help to preach the word but yet there was some living in his soul that in the end was counsel that caused balum that caused Israel to commit trespass against the Lord he helped Bayo hurt Israel he hurt he couldn't curse them but he could hurt him how could he hurt him by tempting them to the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes you cannot curse what God has blessed the bride has a blessing on her you have a blessing on you you're sealed by the Holy Ghost it's a permanent Eternal unconditional Covenant blessing it cannot be rescinded but guess what you can hurt yourself that's true the devil can't curse you and you can't curse yourself but you can hurt yourself listen to how the Jewish historians or the actually the oral tellers and the tarum the rabbis have this say what happened because it's it's in the scripture in a way that maybe you don't see so numbers 24 it looks as if bam goes his way Bic goes the other way but then we find out in numbers 31 God is letting us know that though we only see blessing in those three chapters 22 23 and 24 balum counseled gave counsel that caused the congregation the People Israel to stumble and they write and balum Rose up and went to return to his place and bik also went upon his way and this is the silent part between 24 and 25 and appointed the daughters of the midianites for the tavern booths at Beth joshimath by the Snow Mountain where they sold sweet meats cheaper than their price I kind of love sweet meats know you they sold sweet meats cheaper than their price now listen listen to this listen they were selling that is a lost leader right they were selling something desirable and necessary cheaper than what it was and guess what these guys were doing like wait a minute I can get this sweet meat for that much and it it catches them and they did it because the price after the Council of balum the Wicked at the dividing of the way when you look at the scripture when they say the divide the way it's so beautiful another Rabbi wrote it this way come I will counsel thee because he tells ba come here I will counsel thee go and set up ends and place them with the place in them horish women to sell food and drink at a low price and this people will come and eat and drink and be drunken and will lie with them and deny their God and they will be quickly delivered into thine hands and many of them shall fall now I know when we think of the Feast of Bel peor we're thinking like party like just this gigantic Feast where you you get an invitation it's like you got invited to the Feast of elpor I didn't get invited can you give me an invitation is it a plus one but notice even how subtle this Feast may have been just in traditional places taverns and in and places where you might frequent places you might go but there's things that are put out there to tempt you little dainties and things that if you could begin in that path there's a point at which you become overwhelmed and Intoxicated by feeding the lust of the flesh where ultimately it where it results in more you following this balum could not curse Israel so he told Bayo how he could get them to fall and in Revelations chap 2 verse chapter 2:14 it tells us but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught Bayo to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel and to eat things sacrifice into idols and to commit fornication this is it bam taught Bayo a three-step process to getting them to be judged by God place a stumbling block they'll eat things sacrifice and idols and they'll commit fornication the stumbling block of eating uh of eating things sacrifice Idol commited fornication results in death for them God had blessed them I keep saying it God had blessed him but there was no way that he could curse them so he knew and he told B you must cause them to stumble through Temptation notice necessarily that the big three isn't Sin Sin iniquity iniquity sin sin or it it it's not the big three is the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life it's not even you know uh sin and death those things have been beaten and vanquished death has no more power over you youve been made free from the law of sin and death but yet there still exists this power of the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life you may not be able to condemn their soul through to hell but you can cause them to stumble through Temptation you can keep them from bringing forth fruit unto Perfection you can keep them from a h hundredfold you can cause them to get nervous under persecution you can snatch the word out of their hearts you can cause the deceitfulness of riches to choke out the word so in second Peter chapter 2: 14 15 and 16 Peter's using the same language akin to what Jude writes he says having eyes full of adultery that cannot cease from sin oh the lust of the eyes beguiling unstable souls and a heart that has exercised with Covetous practices cursed children the cursed children the bride's not cursed the elect are not cursed the children of God are not cursed you have the children of obedience the children of Disobedience you have cursed children that are not elected to a new birth and then you have those who are not cursed who can be born again the seed of God is in them to be born again so he says which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balum the son of basor or as the Bible says beor who loved the wages of unrighteousness the payment the lust of reward but was rebuked for his iniquity all right does that not tell you the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbade The Madness of the Prophet now I'm like hold on hold on hold on let me go back and read this let me read this numbers The Madness of the Prophet where's The Madness of the prophet he went yeah when he wasn't supposed to go he said but God said to go he said yeah if they call so then why why did that become such an issue his own Madness he ran greedily after the he of balum for reward he taught Bayo to cast a stumbling block why because Bao made a deal this is a hypothetical speculation balum realizes okay I can't curse them because they're blessed maybe he comes clean with Bay you've asked me to do something that I can't do I can't curse them because they're blessed so you can give me all the money you want in the world but I can't prophesy I can't say anything against what's already what God speaks and so B's like and Bam's kind of like you dig like I can't I can't curse them and B look's like so what can you do like like it starts doing charades right and he said he say he says well I do know that God has said that they're not to lie with your women and so and and they have this appetite they have this desire and you can work through economy you can you work through consumerism you can put it in grocery stores and online markets and you can do this and you can offer discounts and you can provide this and you can provide that and you can work in this Channel and what will happen is they begin to consume this it'll pervert their sermon or their judgment or put them in proximity to other things that they're not to partake in and these women will ultimately be able to seduce the men and it'll cause God's judgment to come on them that's the way of balum The Madness of the Prophet God knew it the moment he left or God knew it before but he showed it the moment he didn't tell Balo that he couldn't curse him in the moment he left for the princes of Moab when God told him not to go unless they came to him then let me say this as I close balum represents to us the lust of the flesh lurking underneath the surface through whether it be need or even desire the controlling factor or preeminence where it's what the flesh wants it's something there balum was controlled by the lust of the flesh he says a lot of good things does a lot of good things things prophesies a lot of good things preaches a lot of good sermons even in the face of Bayo the critic and the one who's trying to get him to do otherwise but ultimately he succumbed because of the pressure not just the pressure he had in his heart but the pressure that Bic also has put it on him and as those of you who studied this know brother Bram made these statements in the sermon why are so people tossed about money was the prophet balum in money women and pro popularity says baalm represents money who sold out his gifts to go on account of money when Bayo offered so much money yes I hope you understand further and better the story of balum that the scripture oh scripture does not even speak to us what happened between chapters 24 and chapters 25 but tells us later in Micah and Peter in Revelation and even as we read in Jude that there was this Heir in balam's heart this Doctrine where he taught BAC how to lay a stumbling block running at greedily after the heir of balum the the way of balum Who Loved wages of unrighteousness this Council money is represented by balum money the lust of the flesh the love of money is the root of all evil this is the spirit of balum Brothers you can come to your instruments this is the spirit of balum I'll say this and leave it here when we say that money is something that hinders a minister we might think oh if he has a lot of it but it could also be if he doesn't have any and therefore poverty and the lack of money becomes problematic brother brandham is even honest about the fact he never wanted money to be a problem and that's why he never took up offerings but then what happened he got into debt so much to he quit Ministry because he did a Revival in California ended up oing tens of thousands of dollars or thousands of thousand of dollars couldn't pay it back came back said he was going to go get his old job and come off the field because he didn't want money to be a problem well the lack of it was even causing the prophet to do something that even in his heart he didn't necessarily believe was right God had to give him a vision that night so this the the money isn't always maybe what we think it is and we kind of look at our bank account and be like I don't have a problem with money I got money problems and so there's more to it I'll say this to have a problem with money especially any one of us it's not just to this is a spirit of abalum it's to be controlled by money you may not have it but you're trying to get it in each one of these instances it says that he gave counsel and it's through that counsel that he caused the people to eat and I began to see this symmetry in the word of God wherein if a man does not work he's not able to eat and there is a a a a a a connection between labor and eating the fruits of your labor and that the wage and the fruit of Labor we we are to enjoy but there's a point at which the pursuit of the Mammon the pursuit of the fruit The Pursuit Of The Riches of the money or that which we want to joy as a result of our labor causes us to go further than just the need but then to bow down to other gods and to commit fornication through intoxication it's to be controlled by money a minister can be controlled by money in that he's afraid to speak things because he doesn't want to cause a tithe payer to hold back their tithes or to lose somebody who who who gives or miss out on an opportunity to do something many times uh men of God can be controlled because they say we have a need for a fellowship hall to meet these needs and a guy comes and he's got a check and he says how much is it going to cost and he says well we need $150,000 he says I'll I'll write you a check this big too right I'm going to write you a check and you could build it but or I I want you to do it and then suddenly through different ways says yeah you know I just got this this situation with my wife and you know I want to put her away and God gave me a dream years ago that I was supposed to marry this other girl and she turns 18 next month and you know kind of like bam and Bot kind of like you picking up what I'm laying down here and it seems absurd but these things happen and maybe I use it on an absurd scale and I should kind of bring it down to a little bit more subtle levels that's how sometimes money becomes a pastor's problem or a preacher's problem it's because how others try to use it on him true but the spirit of balum is not just to be controlled by money but it's representing the spirit of bao to use money to control there's some likeminded with Bao and balum there's a reason why they kept traveling together you know to different Vantage points you know going up this a great hike to the top of this mountain it's beautiful see these people over there can you curse them now I don't know let me see bck let me see let's just Camp another night here let's hang out a little bit and let's see I couldn't curse him well let's go on another hike let's go down to the valley let's go over here let's do this it was his traveling buddy never tired of his presence they were like Spirits so money can become a problem money problems doesn't necessarily always mean that you have it in your Rich it's how you use it yes sometimes people will not tithe as a way of protest and you might be thinking oh man I got the pastor you know the pastor has no idea he's over there praying for you oh God bless them they're they they don't they they must be going through tough times Lord and financially they must be going through and they pray and and they're burden for you no judgment whatsoever and you're thinking yeah I really stuck it to them and God's over there going I've given him tenfold what you're withholding you're robbing me pal you're robbing me why because it's the spirit of balum with money in ways that they think they control money becomes a problem with ministers not because they have too much of it but they'll use it to bribe and to control to put you on salary or under their thumb or to use use money there's ministers and there's pastors especially because the a lot of in some Churches everything you give is tithing and the pastor decides when the rent's going to be paid or the mortgage and he distributes everything and so all the money in a church is the pastors and so he's the only one that can buy you a set of tires right he's the only one that can put gas in your tank he's the only one that can help you when you're in need and so what does he do he uses it to buy influence and to Curry favor and there's some people that we know and we they seem to be so unselfish say I've never met a man that is so unselfish with his money but God sees right through the Optics of balam's heart and right into his soul and knows he's only doing it for influence so the lust of the flesh it's connected with this money it's more than just eating but it's to be controlled by it and to use it to control why are people so tossed about brother says money was the prophet balum who sold out his gifts to go on account of money when Bao offered so much money many of you are acquainted with the story we are I I could read it now because anyone here we're all acquainted with it just think about it for a moment this example of balum who thought that he stood thought he was doing good and it seems as if he never quite recognized where he was going wrong and to get away from it no it's one thing to say oh my goodness brother Aaron I I I I think I've got this in my heart I I I I feel like I I I've got a problem that whenever I go to this place I I get drawn and I get tempted and I've been saying no and so I think I've got this weakness and I've got this problem and and I just want God to get rid of this problem and so you show back up at that place you say well I guess it's still there it's like hey don't go anymore right don't go that that's part of Satan's got a Punch Coming got to keep a spot covered up it's not so much asking for deliverance as much as it is asking for the wisdom of the word oh God help us he says to Samson it was Delilah the woman who woed him in his her lap until he gave away the secrets of the L Lord to her money women that's the lust of the eyes and Saul it was popularity pride of life those are my words the pride of life is my words the Bible said he was numbered with the prophets and through popularity he wanted to be big and above someone else and he fell by this and this is the three major causes that I see in the Bible that caused men to fall and brother B says and I asked our heavenly father to please let me shun at all times those things especially these three major things and had kept a covering over them January 1st 1956 why are people so tossed about go read how he begins to confess how money not in a lustful way not in a perverted way but how money this thing he's tried to kept cover he's transparent about it he's not Hy he's not saying well the Lord told me to come off the field and go get my job you know go get another job he's being transparent I've tried to keep this covered up I've tried to stay away from it I've turned down millions of dollars I haven't taken up offerings but I find myself in this pickle I owe a lot of money I I can't keep doing these meetings if I'm going to have to start pulling for money and he's still trying to keep it covered up he's not wanting to give in and I believe it applies to all of us I want you to begin to think about these things in ways that are much deeper than just the usual suspects or the real clothline punch that can give but to recognize you can't be cursed daughter of God you can't be cursed Son of God but you can be caused to stumble and it's the wicked one that wants to do that hey I don't want to be his stumbling block do you so God help us amen for my sake and others to keep the big three at Bay to be Discerning to use wisdom could we stand together
