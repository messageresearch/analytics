[0:00] Isaiah 45:18 for thus sayith the Lord
[0:03] that created the heavens God himself
[0:06] that formed the Earth and made it he
[0:09] hath established it he created it not in
[0:11] vain he formed it to be inhabited I am
[0:15] the lord and there is none else amen you
[0:18] can take your
[0:20] seats my title tonight is created to
[0:23] create and we're going to pick up there
[0:26] in Isaiah 45:18 here in a moment uh but
[0:29] my title to is created to create and I'd
[0:33] like to bring uh this statement back to
[0:35] your remembrance that we read on Sunday
[0:37] from Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[0:38] today and forever brother Ram's speaking
[0:41] of the man who formed the the artificial
[0:43] tooth the artificial limb and how their
[0:45] scientists and there's creators and
[0:47] there's those that use substance that's
[0:49] been given to them and even using the
[0:52] design that God has already laid out in
[0:54] his creation and they make something
[0:55] artificial or replacement he says the
[0:58] man that made an artificial arm made
[1:00] reputation for himself but the man who
[1:02] made the real arm made of himself no
[1:05] reputation and it's this statement that
[1:08] I think is so remarkable the Way Up Is
[1:10] Down and remember that be humble be
[1:13] sweet and kind be creative let Christ be
[1:17] in you and this is said kind of
[1:20] amplifying on let this mind be in you
[1:22] that was in Christ Jesus who humbled
[1:24] himself didn't make himself of any
[1:26] reputation and and humbled himself to
[1:29] the form of man and in making himself in
[1:31] the form of man was obedient uh unto the
[1:33] death of the Cross brother brandom
[1:35] places Us in that same let this mind be
[1:38] in you and he says let Christ be in you
[1:40] so there must be a humility there must
[1:42] be a sweetness there must be a kindness
[1:44] and then this statement that seems to be
[1:46] maybe a little bit out of place uh since
[1:49] it's not something that he says anywhere
[1:51] else in terms of a command to be
[1:53] creative but he says be creative that's
[1:56] that's having the quality of creating
[2:00] being able to have that function or that
[2:02] skill to create something and that's
[2:05] what I'm looking at when we say created
[2:07] to create this he says to be creative
[2:09] that means we must have this function
[2:11] this capacity this ability of
[2:14] creating and exploring this concept or
[2:17] this act of creating I want to look at
[2:19] the creation once again in the beginning
[2:22] and in Isaiah chapter 45: 18 it says for
[2:26] thus sayith the Lord that created the
[2:29] heavens and so here is in the beginning
[2:31] God created we see this being uh
[2:33] rehearsed here in Isaiah 45 he created
[2:35] the heavens God himself that formed the
[2:38] Earth and made it he hath established it
[2:42] that's is God creating all things
[2:44] there's only one Creator created the
[2:46] heavens he formed the Earth he made it
[2:47] he brought it forth he's established it
[2:49] he created it not in vain that word
[2:52] there in the Hebrew vain it's the same
[2:54] word that was without form or void it's
[2:56] that chaos or that confusion but he
[2:58] formed it to be inhabited he he he he
[3:01] formed it that it would remain even that
[3:03] word means remain and that's another
[3:05] clue that this Earth though it's going
[3:07] to be renovated and it's going to be
[3:08] called a new Heaven A New Earth it is an
[3:10] attribute of God that he created to
[3:12] Forever remain it's going to be
[3:14] inhabited I am the lord and there is
[3:16] none else in verse 12 it says I made
[3:19] Heavens I made I have made the Earth and
[3:23] created man upon it I even my hands have
[3:26] stretched out the heavens and all their
[3:28] host have I Comm commanded again this is
[3:31] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[3:33] and the Earth I've made the earth I
[3:35] created man upon it even my hands have
[3:37] stretched out the heavens this is God's
[3:40] handiwork this is the act of God
[3:42] bringing forth something that wasn't
[3:44] before it's in the beginning God created
[3:46] the Heaven and the Earth uh the the
[3:48] Latin is uh out of nothing came
[3:51] something the ex nilo it's out of
[3:53] nothing came something he shaped he
[3:55] formed he fashioned didn't use any
[3:58] existing substance and he brought
[3:59] something forth and on Sunday we were
[4:01] looking at the the phrase the art of God
[4:04] and that God uh made the Heaven and the
[4:06] Earth that's his handiwork that's his
[4:09] artwork he created mankind uh that that
[4:12] was his handiwork he he wrote the Bible
[4:14] in the heavens and then he brings it
[4:16] forth by inspiration all these things
[4:18] are an expression of God the Creator
[4:21] even you yourself are an example of
[4:24] God's creative work maybe his ultimate
[4:28] one that he was always moving towards
[4:30] so in Genesis 1:
[4:32] 27 we're we're just going to be looking
[4:34] at this statement this scripture tonight
[4:37] in Greater detail so God created man in
[4:40] his own image in the image of God
[4:42] created he him male and female created
[4:46] he them this is God WR painting a
[4:50] self-portrait and God working something
[4:52] out of nothing using substance uh uh by
[4:55] the spoken word and then as he would
[4:57] make the body he would use the dust of
[4:59] the Earth but this is God creating man
[5:01] in his own image So Adam reflected God
[5:04] and in reflecting God he this creation
[5:07] reflect reflected the Creator more than
[5:09] any other creation God as a Creator is
[5:12] reflecting himself out in creation
[5:14] whether he's creating the smallest thing
[5:15] or to the highest thing but when he
[5:17] creates man this is the highest uh
[5:20] expression of his
[5:22] creation and so for Adam I know this is
[5:25] going to be very very Elementary just
[5:27] very very simple but for Adam to be in
[5:30] God's image it's necessary that Adam was
[5:33] created to
[5:36] create again like I said it's just
[5:38] really simple you're going to say you
[5:39] know you how long did you spend putting
[5:42] this together because this is I could
[5:43] have done this and it's probably true
[5:46] but it it sometimes it just Bears
[5:47] repeating things very simply that Adam
[5:50] being made in the image of God it was
[5:52] necessary that God was creating him to
[5:54] create and what is that he commands him
[5:56] to be fruitful and multiply and
[5:58] replenish the Earth and subdue it and
[6:01] have dominion that's a language that
[6:03] describes at least in some way a form of
[6:05] creating a form of fashioning a form of
[6:07] bringing forth and I was thinking of it
[6:09] this way this week that when God made
[6:12] man in his own image he was making him
[6:14] to be a God on Earth and he made him to
[6:16] be a Creator giving him this commandment
[6:19] to be fruitful to multiply replenish the
[6:21] Earth subdue it have dominion these this
[6:23] is a language of commissioning him and
[6:25] commanding him and so in some ways God
[6:28] was commissioning Adam as an artist and
[6:31] when an artwork is commissioned there's
[6:33] this intimate process of one
[6:34] collaborating with an artist uh to bring
[6:37] something for us so God having been the
[6:39] creator of everything commissions Adam
[6:42] to work alongside him to intimately work
[6:45] together collaborating in beautifying
[6:47] the
[6:49] world and then Genesis CH 2: 19
[6:54] 20 and I'm realizing now there's a
[6:56] little bit maybe of a hole in here in
[6:59] the s that I took some things out I was
[7:01] wanting to go into some details where he
[7:02] said let there be light and this
[7:04] function of light and if you want to
[7:05] listen to there's a man here who could
[7:07] turn on the light some of those Shalom
[7:08] sermons or the power of transformation
[7:11] brother bam identifies just how
[7:13] important light is in terms of having
[7:15] life and so I want to skip that portion
[7:18] in Genesis and come to verse 19 in
[7:21] Chapter 2 and this is again zeroing in
[7:25] on the man who is created in God's image
[7:28] we could say as an amateur Creator which
[7:30] we know even we are and there's certain
[7:32] abilities and things that he would have
[7:34] had and it says out of the ground the
[7:36] Lord God formed every beast of the field
[7:38] and every foul of the air now this is
[7:41] clearly a creative act this is something
[7:43] that God has brought forth himself but
[7:46] now Adam being a partner with him in
[7:49] this it says and he brought them this
[7:50] would be the formed Beast and the formed
[7:52] foul brought them unto Adam to see what
[7:55] he would call them notice there's
[7:58] something even in God's observation of
[8:00] Adam where I'm going to bring these
[8:02] things which I have created and I want
[8:04] to see what you will name him I want to
[8:07] know what you come up with what your
[8:09] instinct is and it says and whatsoever
[8:11] Adam called every living creature that
[8:13] was the name thereof now could you
[8:17] imagine this is this is probably really
[8:19] good question that if you had a baby you
[8:21] just let somebody else name the
[8:24] baby just every start panicking
[8:27] hyperventilating I've heard that that's
[8:28] what Trump was wants to do I don't know
[8:30] if it's true or not but my people say
[8:32] that it's no that it would be one of the
[8:34] scariest things I guess for a parent
[8:36] that brings forth something or you
[8:38] create a work of art and someone says
[8:39] I'm going to name that for you or you I
[8:41] guess for as a minister if somebody else
[8:42] was naming my sermons I'd get very picky
[8:46] about it used to drive me crazy at one
[8:47] church I attended and you'd spend all
[8:50] month coming up with a really good title
[8:51] and they would just say you know sermon
[8:53] by Aaron or whatever you could tell it's
[8:55] probably family and uh so there's
[8:58] something to the naming of a thing
[9:00] something very important and God is
[9:01] entrusting Adam with the naming of
[9:04] creation whatever Adam called every
[9:06] living creature that was the name
[9:09] thereof so God didn't test Adam in the
[9:11] sense well what do you think this name
[9:13] is and he's
[9:14] like camel and he's like no elephant no
[9:17] it wasn't a game he said whatever you
[9:19] name him that's what it is and it says
[9:22] and Adam gave names to all cattle and to
[9:25] the foul of the air and to every beast
[9:27] of the field and then it gives kind of
[9:29] like this uh sad um tag to it but for
[9:33] Adam there was not found an help meat
[9:35] for
[9:36] him and we know that that foreshadows
[9:39] the bringing forth of the woman we'll
[9:40] come to it here in a moment but this is
[9:42] I want you to think of what task that
[9:44] Adam had in naming God's creation Adam
[9:47] didn't himself create Adam did not have
[9:50] uh the commission to bring forth life uh
[9:53] in the original of as God did form these
[9:56] things of the field and every foul of
[9:57] the air and not sure maybe what Adam
[9:59] would have been doing in this process uh
[10:02] and to what extent God was relying upon
[10:03] him but it's very clear that the word of
[10:05] God says that God brought to him these
[10:07] create Creations for him to name and
[10:10] this is not a small thing he's
[10:12] commissioning you Adam I want
[10:14] commissioning Adam I want you to name my
[10:17] creation and in order for him to name
[10:20] these things it would have required Adam
[10:22] to consider very diligently what God had
[10:24] created he would have been having to pay
[10:26] attention wasn't just drawing names out
[10:29] of a had it wasn't just uh uh you know
[10:31] willy-nilly and whatever would come but
[10:32] he'd have to concentrate he'd have to
[10:35] contemplate God's creation he would look
[10:36] at it in a way that God as this is the
[10:39] way that I see it in terms of the way
[10:41] that the Bible describes it he brought
[10:43] them unto Adam to see what he would call
[10:45] them it's there was some contemplation
[10:48] that he wanted Adam to engage in he was
[10:51] going to look at it he was going to
[10:52] examine it he was going to consider that
[10:53] which was before him and what struck me
[10:56] is that as God would bring this an these
[10:58] animals before Adam and as he would give
[11:01] his attention to God's creation and he
[11:03] would look over it he would concentrate
[11:05] and he would contemplate the beauty of
[11:06] God's creation he gained knowledge from
[11:10] observing God's creation and it
[11:12] quickened something to Adam in order to
[11:14] name God's creation in other words he
[11:17] got a a revelation from the very thing
[11:20] that God had created and it inspired the
[11:22] naming of it the Bible says Adam gave
[11:26] names it was a recognition of the
[11:28] difference of things that in giving a
[11:30] name it separated out as its own entity
[11:32] it required this reason it required some
[11:35] silent
[11:36] contemplation and I I found myself
[11:39] reading this one writer who had wrote a
[11:42] book she wrote a book called Gathering
[11:44] moss and I think she's done some TED
[11:45] Talks I haven't watched those or uh
[11:48] leaned in too much to those other things
[11:49] but right in this book on Gathering moss
[11:52] and how there's over 22,000 different
[11:54] variations of moss and how that they are
[11:57] only usually known by their Latin name
[11:59] and their scientific name and they don't
[12:01] have common names that we might have for
[12:03] other trees and and other flowers and
[12:05] different things and in this writing
[12:08] she's looking at how the power of naming
[12:10] is a very intimate mode of knowing in
[12:13] other words there's different modes of
[12:15] knowledge or different ways of knowing
[12:16] things and so uh she's setting forth
[12:18] that naming is a special discourse that
[12:20] manifests something that's unknown and
[12:23] that that to me is very
[12:24] thought-provoking that when you name
[12:26] something it it's it's disclosing
[12:28] something that otherwise was not
[12:30] broadcast or made known he's not asking
[12:32] Adam I'm going to test you and give you
[12:34] a pop quiz to see whether or not you
[12:36] remember what I called these but he was
[12:38] going to speak and in speaking he was
[12:40] disclosing something that had not been
[12:42] known befor amen so naming was this act
[12:46] of naming by Adam it was a uh it was
[12:50] being creative in the image of God Amen
[12:54] something that God the original Creator
[12:55] was trusting Adam to do and to name
[12:58] something required just as the spoken
[13:00] word brought everything into existence
[13:03] in order for Adam to name the animals he
[13:05] had to
[13:05] speak it required a word to come forth
[13:09] and in in being steered into this
[13:11] direction I felt that it just fits so
[13:13] well with with what brother Ellie eer
[13:15] ministered on last Tuesday night the
[13:17] last midweek service of last year on
[13:19] good morning bride and how God uh is
[13:22] even changing a language not just church
[13:24] but bride because brother B says your
[13:26] name Associates what you are and brother
[13:28] Ellie eer read this it has an impression
[13:31] on your character so the name is not
[13:34] just an appalation that we might be able
[13:36] to put you in different categories but
[13:38] there's some imprinting there's some
[13:40] fashioning there's some making that
[13:41] comes with the naming so even by Adam
[13:44] naming the animals he's imparting to
[13:46] them some sort of impression or
[13:48] character or activity or work or use or
[13:53] utility this uh Miss kimmerer who wrote
[13:56] this book on Gathering MOS she said the
[13:58] name on lips reveals the knowledge we
[14:01] have of each other hence the sweet
[14:03] secret names we have for the ones we
[14:05] love the names we give ourselves are a
[14:08] powerful form of self-determination of
[14:10] declaring ourselves Sovereign territory
[14:12] isn't that what they say the sweetest
[14:14] sound anyone can hear is their own
[14:17] name and it's it she says further it is
[14:20] a sign of respect to call a being by its
[14:22] name and a sign of disrespect to ignore
[14:24] it words and names are the ways we as
[14:27] humans build relationships
[14:30] think of how important it is to have a
[14:32] name and how that we can use this power
[14:35] of names in order to Grant to others
[14:37] characteristics that we would want to
[14:39] solely them or to cast them in a bad
[14:42] light and that's exactly how we know
[14:43] that we could assassinate somebody or
[14:45] murder somebody by speaking against
[14:47] their character because we try to use
[14:49] words to impress upon their character to
[14:52] form them and shape and that's why we've
[14:53] got to be careful brother my says what
[14:55] you name your children and there's
[14:57] there's something to this name is it
[14:59] would Associates what you are your name
[15:01] Associates what you are it impresses
[15:03] upon your character Adam was making an
[15:06] impression he was associating a certain
[15:08] nature and character to these animals
[15:10] and this act of naming it it confers
[15:13] dignity upon the person by by receiving
[15:16] a name it not only differentiates you
[15:18] and shows that you're different and
[15:20] you're distinct from everyone else and
[15:22] so in a sense it highlights your
[15:23] differences but in doing so it makes you
[15:25] part of the community because now you've
[15:28] received a name you have some sort of
[15:31] identity I feel that the uh the tener of
[15:34] this service does not uh give itself to
[15:37] me reading the entire poem but uh one
[15:40] that would make some sense to read or
[15:42] you might enjoy some of you is TS
[15:43] Elliot's the naming of cats and if
[15:46] you've never read it you should read it
[15:49] I think it perfectly describes cats and
[15:53] uh if anyone wants a copy of it I'll
[15:54] give you one first person to ask me at
[15:57] the end of service can have a copy of
[15:59] the naming of
[16:02] cats now Adam when he's
[16:04] creating he did not create like
[16:08] God but it was a a creative work of
[16:11] speaking the
[16:12] truth and and giving
[16:15] identity and it was something that God
[16:17] had entrusted him with as a part of
[16:20] creation now as the Bible said just a
[16:23] moment ago as we read that there was
[16:24] none found for Adam to be a help meet we
[16:27] know that God says I will make him a
[16:29] help me he brings forth the woman and in
[16:32] verse 23 it says and Adam said this is
[16:34] now bone of my bones the Bible's telling
[16:37] us that and I realize now I may have cut
[16:39] this verse out where God brings forth a
[16:42] woman and takes her brings her to the
[16:44] man and he makes an introduction so now
[16:47] God shows Adam the woman and he says
[16:50] this is now bone of my bones and Flesh
[16:53] of My Flesh she shall be called woman
[16:56] because she was taken out of man Adam is
[17:00] instinctively um offering up uh praise I
[17:03] want to say that it was praise it was
[17:04] this adulation where he says this this
[17:07] is bone of my bones this is Flesh of My
[17:09] Flesh Adam knowing that he had been
[17:10] commissioned that he had a part in
[17:12] creation that he had the power to name
[17:15] uh when he sees the woman he doesn't
[17:16] regard her as anything less he sees her
[17:19] as co-equal bone of my bone Flesh of My
[17:21] Flesh and he names her she shall be
[17:23] called
[17:24] woman now this is uh how simple the
[17:27] sermon is tonight that even right now
[17:30] I've come to the main thesis that I want
[17:32] to express and I want you to see in this
[17:34] activity whereas when God was bringing
[17:36] the animal like before Adam he saw the
[17:39] beauty of God's handiwork and in
[17:41] contemplating it and processing it and
[17:43] looking at it and this attention that he
[17:45] was giving the handiwork of God it
[17:47] inspired the name that was given to that
[17:50] animal life and here God uses and I want
[17:53] to say true beauty that there's a truth
[17:56] here it's not we got to be careful which
[17:57] direction you might want to take with
[17:59] this but I believe it highlights the
[18:00] dangers that we see in this a day and
[18:02] age God uses true beauty of the purpose
[18:05] of Attraction and this
[18:07] Revelation where when God brought Adam
[18:09] and I want to show you this in the
[18:10] message of the hour when God brought the
[18:12] woman before him there was something
[18:14] about her that so excited him that he
[18:16] was effusive in his praise he was agile
[18:18] and say bone of my bone Flesh of My
[18:20] Flesh she's going to be called woman and
[18:22] he names her and say well I thought she
[18:25] was named Eve that's what title she's
[18:27] given after the fall
[18:29] but here she is called she's named just
[18:32] as he did the animals he gives her this
[18:33] name woman and God was using Beauty to
[18:37] attract Adam he was using his creation
[18:41] to inspire to give Revelation to Adam
[18:44] and this is I would say one reason why
[18:47] the devil works so hard to pervert
[18:49] Beauty and how easily beauty is misused
[18:53] because we know that even according to
[18:55] the message of hour there is a beauty
[18:56] that is the devil always it's always the
[18:58] devil when it's in a certain
[19:01] channel in his writings uh BL
[19:05] Pascal he wrote The Art of persuasion so
[19:08] there's another art and he had made a
[19:11] statement he he made this this statement
[19:14] he said all men are almost led to
[19:15] believe not of proof but by
[19:17] attraction I think of that almost all
[19:20] men are led to believe something accept
[19:23] something that is agreeable to them they
[19:25] agree with it because it's beautiful
[19:28] because it's Pleasant to the Eyes by
[19:30] attraction but not by
[19:32] proof and in there is quite a paradox
[19:35] because we accept God on the basis of
[19:37] faith not proof there's something very
[19:40] fascinating to ponder on this two sides
[19:42] that he says there's a kind of standard
[19:44] of agreeableness in one translation said
[19:46] attractiveness there's a kind of
[19:48] standard of attract attractiveness and
[19:50] Beauty which consists in a certain
[19:52] relation between our natural
[19:54] dispositions whether it be feeble or
[19:56] strong and that which gives us pleasure
[19:58] this is maybe a fancy way of describing
[20:01] some people like Southern Gospel and
[20:03] some people like contemporary gospel
[20:05] some people are into this some people
[20:06] are into that some people like Ros some
[20:08] people don't this is just a way of
[20:10] saying that there's always some standard
[20:11] of beauty or attractiveness that we lend
[20:13] ourselves to whatever conforms to this
[20:16] standard pleases he says be it a
[20:18] residence music discourse poetry Pros
[20:21] females Birds Rivers trees Chambers
[20:23] dress maybe some archaic language in
[20:25] there but whether it be a house whether
[20:27] it be music whether it be convers ation
[20:29] or poetry or or or the other sex Birds
[20:32] Rivers trees Chambers some people love
[20:33] the beach some people love the mountains
[20:35] says whatever is aligns or conforms with
[20:39] that standard it pleases them but
[20:40] whatever is not adopted to this model
[20:43] displeases those who have a
[20:44] susceptibility of taste so then in this
[20:47] we all have some sort of incl
[20:49] inclination towards something and a
[20:51] preference for something now we're not
[20:52] going to debate where that comes from
[20:54] nature nurture rather whether it's
[20:56] organic but in the fact that mankind is
[20:58] made even to where they are today to
[21:00] where they can almost be led to believe
[21:03] without proof and to accept something on
[21:05] the basis of
[21:07] attraction that if I'm attracted to it
[21:10] if it's agreeable if it's pleasing it's
[21:11] something in my disposition that I I
[21:13] want to have I want to accept I want to
[21:16] believe based upon attraction not some
[21:18] sort of sterile
[21:20] proof and because it is this way within
[21:24] man there's some Design Within man that
[21:26] could be manipulated that can be twisted
[21:29] there's a way that this thirst can
[21:30] actually be perverted that degrades
[21:33] him
[21:36] now there's I read that just so you I
[21:39] read it so you could see that there is
[21:42] even in a base sense because even Pascal
[21:44] when he's writing says not I I I'm not
[21:46] saying that this is true with the things
[21:47] of God he said because those things that
[21:49] relate to God ought to be accepted upon
[21:51] the basis that they're God's word uh
[21:53] whether unpleasant or Pleasant that
[21:55] there's a certain sphere in which we
[21:57] accept God on the basis of
[21:59] word and we live in a fallen time and
[22:02] and darkness all around us and there's
[22:03] so much debate and clamor and so much
[22:05] noise to where it obscures the word of
[22:07] God and the true beauty of God's word
[22:09] and so that Satan has been working very
[22:11] hard to twist and to distort and to
[22:13] pervert but with this Instinct that's in
[22:16] man there's something originally in Adam
[22:19] that God inspires when he brings the
[22:22] woman to
[22:23] him she shall be called woman this was a
[22:27] an a creative act inspired by the beauty
[22:31] of his
[22:32] wife and God used this uh this wand that
[22:37] he brought forth out of Adam if I could
[22:38] even say God's handiwork his art too
[22:40] inspired the creative act of Adam there
[22:44] was something in Adam God used the
[22:46] animals to bring it out there was
[22:47] something in Adam and it was actually
[22:49] this woman and when he brings her forth
[22:50] this skill this desire this longing it
[22:53] it was expressed in Adam the speaking
[22:55] forth this broadcasting this praise was
[22:58] brought out from him when he saw this
[23:00] woman who came from him now I have
[23:02] several statements I'd like to read to
[23:04] you this evening on this very subject I
[23:07] I have there was many that I left out
[23:10] but we've we've already we're on we're
[23:12] already in the second half of the
[23:14] sermon and so in the sermon fellowship
[23:16] with God through reconciliation he said
[23:18] let's turn our camera for the closing
[23:20] moments that's interesting even phrasing
[23:23] we're going to turn turn our camera
[23:25] we're going to focus on something out
[23:26] let's go back to Eden again I can see
[23:29] little Eve see little Eve standing there
[23:32] I was standing not long ago went off to
[23:33] uh a Mars Hill down there in Athens and
[23:36] I was watching a picture there that some
[23:38] Grecian artist had painted of the
[23:41] creation I've been searching for hours
[23:43] trying to find where these things might
[23:45] be uh brother brandom in another place
[23:48] when he's telling this I might have it
[23:49] here he says he was in Rome so if he was
[23:51] in Greece I'm having a hard time maybe
[23:53] finding the the Greek artists artists
[23:55] that may have done it maybe more of a
[23:57] modern portrait not a classic one but
[23:59] here he describes it we showed those on
[24:01] Sunday how there's some uh even the in
[24:04] the classics that show this ugliness of
[24:06] the woman he said it was an ettt to
[24:09] Christianity there stood Eve the
[24:11] horriblest looking Beast you ever seen I
[24:13] never seen such a person as Eve and
[24:15] there was Adam with hairs out of his
[24:17] nose way out like that and looked like
[24:18] some kind of prehistoric giant that's
[24:21] what made me think of the one where he
[24:23] had that kind of that really long
[24:24] mustache he says not such a thing as
[24:27] that anybody would do that has got a
[24:29] diluted mind a perverted mind they're if
[24:31] they're going to portray Adam and the
[24:33] woman as some sort of ugly creation he
[24:36] said this artists they don't know God
[24:38] Eve was the most beautiful woman that
[24:40] was ever on the earth she was God's
[24:42] perfect thought of a woman and Adam was
[24:45] the most perfect man that lived and in
[24:47] many of these instances he's described
[24:49] them even as they're ushered out of the
[24:51] garden in their expulsion as some of the
[24:53] artists described it and they were cast
[24:54] out of the garden he says I can see Adam
[24:56] great big manly shoulders his big
[24:58] muscles in his legs his shaggy hair
[25:01] hanging down around his neck I can see
[25:03] Eve beautiful her blonde hair hanging
[25:05] down her back and her eyes as blue as
[25:07] the sky and sparkled like the Stars this
[25:11] is where we get our pickup lines right
[25:12] guys it's your dad a
[25:14] thief she didn't have the use of any Max
[25:17] Factor to make her pretty no sir sin is
[25:21] what did that but look brother she's
[25:24] made in God's image she's made after an
[25:26] image of man after God had created her
[25:28] beautiful never to die never to get old
[25:30] never to wrinkle the sparkle to never go
[25:32] out of her eyes she was to be beautiful
[25:35] forever now there's a lot of emphasis
[25:37] sometimes on the this peculiar place
[25:39] that the woman is uh is before God in
[25:41] man and we look at her in her Fallen
[25:43] condition and where we tried to build
[25:45] her up and raise her up is in looking at
[25:47] what God wants to use her for in the end
[25:49] time but just look at the picture that
[25:51] God originally brought forth if we
[25:53] change our camera view if we look at
[25:55] God's original creation she was
[25:57] beautiful never get old the sparkle in
[25:59] her
[26:00] eyes some one place I don't think I have
[26:02] it in these quotes here he says her
[26:04] teeth would never get yellow they would
[26:06] always remain white there was something
[26:07] he's describing he says I see him
[26:09] standing there this is in conferences
[26:11] Adam with his big manly body that was a
[26:13] very picture of Health when I was in
[26:15] Greece here not long ago I seen a
[26:17] picture of some unconverted mind a great
[26:19] artist who had painted a picture of Adam
[26:21] and Eve it was a discredit to humanity
[26:24] So Not only was it a discredit to
[26:26] Christianity now it's even a discredit
[26:28] to Humanity talk about a harsh artart
[26:30] critic brother bram's really putting
[26:32] this guy in his place he says Eve looked
[26:34] like an animal instead of a lady great
[26:36] hair hanging one side and her mouth
[26:38] setting sideways and one leg bigger than
[26:40] the other one and oh she looked horrible
[26:42] that's what the conception of the
[26:43] unconverted mind again there's something
[26:46] he's tapping into where there's some
[26:47] purity of mind there's some uh some
[26:50] thought that will that is the mind
[26:52] having been converted because there is
[26:54] even as I mentioned on Sunday and just
[26:56] wanting to share a picture that great es
[26:58] of the ctin chapel a cathedral a church
[27:01] you have to you have to be very creative
[27:03] how you display it otherwise there's
[27:04] going to be showing the the the nude
[27:06] body and there was a time when that even
[27:09] within the medieval times and art and
[27:11] things that that was considered
[27:13] pure and notice how God would take the
[27:16] the devil will take something World take
[27:17] something and he perverts it and so what
[27:20] would portray innocence and what would
[27:22] be beautiful the unconverted mind now
[27:24] begins to describe put portray In This
[27:26] Very ugliness he says Eve was the most
[27:28] beautiful woman that ever walked on the
[27:30] face of the Earth he made her her eyes
[27:32] were like the stars in the
[27:35] heavens again there's many more
[27:37] statements in this line and and and thy
[27:39] seed shall possess the Gate of his
[27:41] enemies he says and when he seen Eve
[27:43] standing there now notice how this
[27:45] begins to narrow down specifically onto
[27:47] Adam when he saw Eve standing there the
[27:49] beautiful little woman that real
[27:51] masculine man standing there those big
[27:52] bronny muscles and the blood running off
[27:54] his arms from that Old bloody sheep
[27:56] skins little Eve standing there the most
[27:58] beautiful woman ever was in the world
[28:00] because she was created by God's own
[28:02] hand her eyes were like the stars of the
[28:05] heaven this is not just a one-off
[28:07] brother br's describing it over and
[28:10] over speaking of the man and the woman
[28:12] who says they were perfect beautiful
[28:14] wonderful and there they stood what did
[28:17] God bring forth Something Beautiful what
[28:19] he made he made it beautiful the Bible
[28:22] even says in Ecclesiastes he makes all
[28:23] things beautiful in his time in the
[28:25] beginning when God created he brought it
[28:27] forth in a beautiful
[28:30] way in the sermon preparation he said
[28:32] about the woman she was lovely when Adam
[28:35] woke up that morning and see there that
[28:37] beautiful woman flesh of his flesh and
[28:40] bone of his bones he took her by the arm
[28:42] and walked down through Eden what a
[28:44] beautiful home no sickness no sorrow no
[28:47] nothing to live together
[28:49] forever now this woman that came forth
[28:51] from Adam's own side God separating out
[28:54] the female Spirit making a lady giving
[28:56] her a body as a woman something
[28:58] complimentary to Adam when he sees her
[29:01] he says oh she's so beautiful and he
[29:03] takes her by the hand in the sermon law
[29:06] he says back in the Garden of Eden a
[29:07] picture here before you just a moment
[29:10] noce he says I want to give this picture
[29:11] again what one thing he says I want to
[29:13] show you a bring this camera but a
[29:16] picture here before you look at God's
[29:19] Little Children Adam and Eve running
[29:21] around in the garden lovely no sickness
[29:24] no heartaches nothing to harm or destroy
[29:26] never to get old when Adam woke up that
[29:29] morning when God taken from his side the
[29:31] rib and made a woman I know the Grecian
[29:33] artist and different artists of the
[29:34] world paint the picture of Eve a
[29:36] horrible looking beast that's wrong only
[29:39] common everyday knowledge would let you
[29:41] know different from that no one admired
[29:44] anyone that looks like that now catch
[29:47] what he's picking up on here he's saying
[29:49] that if you painted the woman in such a
[29:51] light that she was horrific looking and
[29:52] ugly he said that controverts just Human
[29:56] Experience he said everyday knowledge
[29:58] would tell you that that's not to be
[29:59] admired that that wouldn't be beautiful
[30:02] and he said though they might look like
[30:04] that and can't help it he said not
[30:06] anyone no one admired anyone that looks
[30:09] like that and he says that they though
[30:10] they might look like that and can't help
[30:12] it they feel sorry for them so he said
[30:14] nobody would admire someone that looks
[30:16] that way and if they do he says you feel
[30:17] sorry for them he's just being
[30:20] honest he says but I believe that Eve
[30:22] was the most beautiful woman that God
[30:24] ever put on the earth I can see her
[30:26] sitting there her eyes is blue as the
[30:28] skies above Sparkle her long hair
[30:30] hanging down her back the most perfect
[30:32] looking woman ever was on the earth
[30:34] there she is God give Adam the best that
[30:38] he
[30:40] could and there and there's other places
[30:42] where he's describing her how beautiful
[30:44] she is and her body and her eyes and her
[30:46] hair and her teeth and everything about
[30:48] her would just be beautiful he said to
[30:51] try to portray the woman of something
[30:53] ugly and horrific looking he says that
[30:55] everyday knowledge would tell you that's
[30:57] not so
[30:58] that there would been no Beauty in her
[31:00] that would have been
[31:02] desirable so he says this in when he's
[31:04] given his life story he says I believe
[31:06] that when God woke Adam up to look at
[31:08] Eve she was the most beautiful thing
[31:10] that eyes had ever looked at it goes to
[31:13] show that man Even This Day the desire
[31:17] in men craves to look at a beautiful
[31:20] woman this is Brother Brown I think
[31:22] being pretty plain that there's some
[31:25] desire in him and there's some crave to
[31:26] look at a beautiful woman he says why
[31:28] because that strain comes down through
[31:30] that time like that to know that that
[31:32] was given Plum from the Garden of Eden
[31:36] so God brought forth a very beautiful
[31:38] woman and he brings her to the man and
[31:40] when Adam sees her something is inspired
[31:43] inside of him something is excited
[31:45] inside there's this declaration you're
[31:46] bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh you
[31:48] shall be called he goes to name he
[31:50] enters into this creative act and names
[31:52] her woman and brother Braham said that
[31:54] that that that woman when she was
[31:56] brought it says to this day this desire
[31:59] this crave is a strain that came in in
[32:02] the Garden of Eden in the sermon cruelty
[32:05] of sin and the penalty that it cost to
[32:06] rid Sin from our lives it's the full
[32:09] title he says I believe Eve was the most
[32:11] beautiful woman that was ever on the
[32:12] earth that's right when Adam looked at
[32:15] her and he he goes he he he says it's
[32:19] just why it goes to show that strain
[32:22] comes right on down through human beings
[32:24] today if it didn't it would be vice
[32:27] versa
[32:29] now there I think that gives some some
[32:31] room for you just to think about what
[32:33] he's
[32:33] saying that that strain as in Adam was
[32:38] put in Adam was in Adam it was brought
[32:40] out by this beautiful woman and brother
[32:43] Bram says it still effects he says it
[32:45] still and he says the effects of it
[32:46] still lingers through the sons of Adam
[32:48] down through here that admire her and
[32:51] another place he says it goes to show
[32:53] that strain comes right on down through
[32:54] the human beings
[32:56] today now I'm looking at this in its
[32:58] original sense and its original Purity
[33:01] and the way that God had intended it to
[33:03] be for a reason and for a
[33:05] purpose that God had made them for a
[33:08] reason and he made her beautiful for a
[33:10] reason and this is the quote that I I
[33:13] have used most often in this respect he
[33:15] said it shows the very strain that Eve
[33:17] was the most beautiful thing that ever
[33:19] was said on the earth that's right she
[33:21] didn't need any Max Factor to fix
[33:22] herself up she had it from God that
[33:25] beautiful teeth would never turn yellow
[33:27] or fall out I see her sitting there and
[33:29] her hair hanging down there her back and
[33:30] her eyes as bright as the stars of
[33:31] heaven and when Adam looked at her it
[33:33] put such a shock that still lives in
[33:36] mankind you realize this there was
[33:38] something about what the Adam saw that
[33:41] provoked something in him it it
[33:43] triggered something in Adam there was
[33:46] something in the way that God had made
[33:47] him something in his makeup something in
[33:49] his DNA something in spiritual
[33:50] characteristics that God wanted to
[33:52] provoke in him originally and purely
[33:55] that when Adam saw it it shocked him it
[33:57] put a strain he says this strain now
[33:59] lives in mankind today if I can say this
[34:01] it's the strain that the devil tries to
[34:03] pervert but there's a true beauty in
[34:06] it now if I could just interject this
[34:09] now uh just so I could maybe try to make
[34:12] this a little bit longer than 45
[34:14] minutes notice how the Catholic Church
[34:17] tries to work within the framework of
[34:19] natural beauty and ornate things and
[34:21] this great big display and show of
[34:23] wealth it's because it's trying to
[34:25] capitalize on the truth that God used
[34:28] Beauty to portray
[34:31] himself and that beauty is something
[34:33] that God desires and that God loves and
[34:36] God created
[34:38] himself but then there's a perversion of
[34:40] it and this original beauty that God had
[34:43] given the woman was used for the purpose
[34:45] of
[34:47] Attraction the sermon the basis of
[34:50] Fellowship brother man says what makes a
[34:52] man long to have Fellowship can we just
[34:54] focus for a few minutes it's 8:02 not
[34:56] going to be very much longer you kind of
[34:58] have to read into this what makes a man
[35:00] long to have Fellowship what makes us
[35:03] come together and want to fellowship
[35:04] with one another it's because that there
[35:06] has to be some kind of strain from that
[35:09] he's talking about attraction he's
[35:10] talking about shock spark now I get I
[35:13] was some time ago in a great museum
[35:14] where there was a Greek artist that had
[35:16] painted a picture of Adam and Eve I
[35:17] never seen such a hideous looking sight
[35:19] in my life as that Eve looked like what
[35:21] Eve looked like in Adam well now if Eve
[35:23] looked like that hair sticking out like
[35:25] this and the jaw setting sideways and
[35:27] one arm this way and the other one that
[35:28] way and one limb about big around and
[35:30] the other one like that oh it was awful
[35:33] looking brutal looking thing well if
[35:36] that was the way Eve looked when Adam
[35:38] woke up and seen her that would be the
[35:39] desire of man to be his wife today to
[35:42] look like
[35:45] that it was a strain now that's right
[35:48] now we know better than that now God
[35:50] doesn't make anything unless it's
[35:52] perfect it's right it's good it's
[35:54] precious
[35:55] perfect something that is inh parent in
[35:58] creation was this goodness of God this
[36:01] beauty of God he doesn't make anything
[36:03] unless it's good and precious and
[36:05] perfect he says and that's what I think
[36:07] that Eve was the most beautiful woman
[36:09] that ever was on the face of the Earth
[36:11] he says I longed to see her in Adam come
[36:13] walking down the paradise paradises of
[36:16] God together just to see what our mother
[36:18] of the earth looked like she was a
[36:20] beautiful person no doubt and Adam was a
[36:21] very species of a man masculine in every
[36:23] way Eve feminist in every way do you
[36:27] realize how brother bradam is describing
[36:29] this that if the woman had not been
[36:31] beautiful then it would it would show
[36:33] today what man would lift up and what he
[36:35] would
[36:37] desire but this very desire that man has
[36:40] towards his wife today it be it was
[36:43] expressed and shown in this beautiful
[36:45] woman that God brought before
[36:49] Adam and Adam in naming
[36:52] her portrayed an Act of
[36:55] Creation bone of his B flesh of his
[36:59] flesh Adam was created to
[37:04] create in Adam we see a prefigure of
[37:08] Christ and the woman we see a prefigure
[37:11] of the
[37:12] bride and in Psalms 90:1 17 I'll just
[37:15] close here the next few moments and let
[37:18] the beauty it says let the beauty of the
[37:20] Lord Our God be upon us and establish
[37:24] thou the work of our hands upon us y the
[37:26] work of our hands is establish thou it
[37:30] God who said that he created the world
[37:32] by The Works of his hands in creating he
[37:35] made the Earth he created man upon it my
[37:37] hands have stretched out the heavens the
[37:39] one that created the heavens and formed
[37:41] the Earth and made it and established it
[37:42] he did not create in vain but he formed
[37:44] it to be inhabited this same God who
[37:48] created beauty from nothing it's now
[37:50] this expression says and let the beauty
[37:53] of the Lord Our God be upon us what is
[37:56] it that we learn in the Masterpiece that
[37:58] God is making another Masterpiece
[38:01] another Masterpiece is in the making God
[38:03] once again is bringing forth something
[38:05] to create it means that uh to create
[38:07] something is to bring it forth it means
[38:10] to bring into being one of the earlier
[38:13] uh meanings to make grow and so God in
[38:17] the beginning he created and now in this
[38:20] end time and then when he creates it to
[38:22] bring forth man he says you be fruit for
[38:24] multiply and replenish Earth you have a
[38:26] part to play in this creator act there's
[38:28] going to be this naming there's going to
[38:29] be this impression and now in this end
[38:31] time God is doing what another
[38:34] Masterpiece in the making to do what to
[38:36] reflect his Beauty and to perform his
[38:40] creative acts am because to C to to be
[38:44] creative is to bring forth what is it
[38:46] we're bringing forth the very beauty of
[38:51] Christ in Psalms 102:18 this shall be
[38:54] written for the generation to come and
[38:55] the people which shall be created shall
[38:58] praise the
[39:00] lord we must as individuals bring forth
[39:04] Christ if you are new creatures in
[39:06] Christ created in Christ Jesus if if you
[39:09] have the spirit of God in you then the
[39:11] spirit that raised Christ from the D
[39:13] dead dwells in you then you have the
[39:14] very power and the force of creation we
[39:17] could say it in many ways and say well
[39:19] you've got if you've got God in you
[39:20] you've got power to create another world
[39:22] and live on it we've emphasized this
[39:23] from different directions but I want to
[39:25] kind of put in the Simplicity of the
[39:26] channel of human life that you and your
[39:29] life are to bring forth and create the
[39:32] very beauty of God you created to create
[39:36] and it's you upon whom the beauty of the
[39:38] Lord will be upon and upon you that he
[39:40] will establish the work of your hands
[39:42] and the work of your hands be
[39:43] established by God do so Lord that your
[39:46] beauty would be seen and in being seen
[39:49] it would be
[39:53] attractive it's so important that we
[39:55] Faithfully create
[39:57] Christ in this
[39:59] hour because God uses Beauty and the
[40:01] power of attraction to attract who not
[40:04] not the ones that maybe want who want
[40:06] the perversion but those who are hungry
[40:09] who are looking who can be caught by the
[40:11] attractiveness and then begin to pay
[40:13] attention to it am and then begin to
[40:15] consider it and contemplate it that they
[40:17] too might hear their name
[40:20] amen I'll close with this statement
[40:22] Brothers you can come to your
[40:24] instruments this statement to me I think
[40:26] says it very well
[40:28] in the sermon is question and answers
[40:30] and brother br's being asked question
[40:31] should you dye your hair should you do
[40:33] this and he's dealing with a lot of
[40:35] things that pertain to Holiness he says
[40:36] I'm so thankful for our group of women
[40:38] that we have coming here I say this with
[40:41] respect and love now God knows this is
[40:44] the truth I used to have a preacher
[40:46] friend down south that had one of the
[40:47] cleanest looking Churches I'd ever seen
[40:49] where you come to women the most
[40:50] beautiful women I'd ever seen there
[40:52] saintly Godly with long hair and I
[40:54] always admired going to that church and
[40:56] the Lord Jesus has given me a church
[40:58] today here that outshines that one 100
[41:03] miles and so he he says that because
[41:06] it's right in the middle of him really
[41:08] laying down some principles of Holiness
[41:10] principles of beauty it's a way that a
[41:12] woman should Adorn herself says I'm not
[41:15] scolding you to be mean I'm only so
[41:18] happy for
[41:19] you I don't want Satan to get a foot in
[41:23] anywhere I want you to move upward not
[41:26] backward don't ever let a man deceive
[41:28] You by some enchantments or something
[41:31] another like that or something saying oh
[41:33] well it don't that's the way Satan
[41:36] interpreted the word to Eve you believe
[41:39] just what the word
[41:41] says there's enchantments in this hour
[41:43] where Satan wants to pervert what true
[41:45] beauty is and think of it it's getting
[41:48] so wild and so perverted the things that
[41:50] would be called beautiful and and
[41:52] Mankind is just so uh untethered and
[41:55] unmowed that there's a natural physical
[41:57] physical Beauty there's things in the
[41:58] world that are just merely
[42:00] enchantments and he he says I'm not
[42:02] trying to scold you but I'm want I'm
[42:04] wanting you I'm happy for you don't let
[42:06] the S the devil move in any one of these
[42:08] things you're to go upward don't be
[42:09] deceived by some enchantments who says
[42:11] well it doesn't matter this or that
[42:13] however he's trying to describe it he
[42:14] said the way that Satan interpreted the
[42:16] word to
[42:17] Eve and what did Satan do he
[42:20] used even her ability to create he used
[42:23] her ability CU brother bam said in there
[42:26] is where man made his fall in his power
[42:29] to
[42:32] create the woman deceived into thinking
[42:35] that something was beautiful Pleasant to
[42:38] the eyes what he had been separated from
[42:40] it had been separated from
[42:42] truth there's a certain goodness that
[42:44] God brings forth in his creation and
[42:47] that from that goodness uh it produces
[42:49] this great Beauty and then from that
[42:51] beauty comes obedience to
[42:54] truth and it's only through that we you
[42:57] can try to divorce uh and maybe maybe
[43:00] there might be a pun in there intended
[43:02] but there's a you can try to separate
[43:04] out truth from Beauty and that's not
[43:07] beautiful that's
[43:09] perverted that's the perverted Beauty so
[43:12] we don't want Satan interpreting the
[43:14] word to us in this hour we have to
[43:17] believe what the word says because you
[43:19] have been created in this hour by the
[43:21] word of God and brought forth by his
[43:23] word in order to create
[43:27] so many things in the message of the
[43:28] hour that you can begin to attach to
[43:29] this and say yep that's right brother M
[43:31] said we're amateur creators we can
[43:32] create an
[43:33] atmosphere power of God inside me
[43:35] brother bam even coming to the power of
[43:37] the third pole and he says Jesus
[43:38] multiplied creation but now in this hour
[43:40] he testifies that he spoke and something
[43:42] came to be where nothing was well that
[43:44] stumbles a lot of people but we were
[43:47] created to
[43:49] create that's why he says be
[43:53] creative because we have some
[43:55] responsibility to Pro tray as an artist
[43:58] as a canvas to bring forth Christ in
[44:01] this hour not in a broke painting not in
[44:04] a Renaissance not in some image of some
[44:07] day gone by where people would just look
[44:09] at you and think oh are you headed to a
[44:12] a Medieval
[44:13] Festival is it a renaissance fair or or
[44:16] or what character in World of Warcraft
[44:18] is that but no there's a life that we
[44:21] have got to live something that we
[44:23] portray that to one who has an eye will
[44:25] see
[44:27] and thirst for Christ I'd like for you
[44:31] to stand with me and pray today
[44:35] just bow our heads
[44:39] [Music]
[44:49] together with our heads bowed let's
[44:51] let's all offer a prayer to the
[44:54] Lord and put ourselves in this
[44:57] place in the word of God today there's a
[44:59] lot of practical things that we could
[45:00] admonish ourselves on the power of
[45:03] language it having such an incredible
[45:06] ability and power
[45:09] that in in what it conveys and
[45:11] communicates and the impression and
[45:13] naming has that's why we got to be so
[45:15] careful with how we use our
[45:17] tongue the creative power of the
[45:20] [Music]
[45:24] tongue
[45:25] and I let me express it this way our
[45:28] heads are bowed now we're just going to
[45:29] go to prayer but God used the beauty of
[45:33] the woman to inspire
[45:38] Adam and it was to inspire Adam to work
[45:41] together with her to be fruitful to
[45:42] multiply and replenish the Earth to
[45:44] subdue and have
[45:46] dominion and God today will use the
[45:48] beauty of his word wants to use the
[45:51] beauty of Christ that living bread of
[45:52] life to bring you
[45:54] forth and then in turn and bringing us
[45:57] forth we are to Bear we are to shine let
[46:00] the beauty of the Lord let that be our
[46:02] prayer let the beauty of the Lord be
[46:04] upon
[46:06] us we've emphasized a lot last year
[46:09] David desired to see the beauty of the
[46:12] Lord Moses craved and desired to see the
[46:15] beauty of the Lord Lord let your beauty
[46:18] be upon
[46:20] us Let Us Praise you with this act of
[46:23] Praise just like Adam did to declare
[46:27] your truth to declare your righteousness
[46:28] let's pray our gracious Heavenly Father
[46:31] Lord tonight though it may be a little
[46:33] brisk and chilly outside it's just
[46:35] gotten a little warm here in your house
[46:38] and there's a weariness to our flesh
[46:40] even in starting the year there's maybe
[46:41] a war of attrition for some and just how
[46:44] exhausting the holidays can be and
[46:46] there's sicknesses and there's the devil
[46:48] fighting many different
[46:51] channels so Lord you still desire to
[46:54] speak your word you still desire for us
[46:56] to hear your voice and I pray Lord that
[46:59] the beauty of your light could shine
[47:01] tonight into hearts that it could pass
[47:03] through any weariness any complexes any
[47:05] builtup resentment whatever force it may
[47:07] be that's resisting the word of God may
[47:10] your light just push aside every cloud
[47:12] of Doubt fear and
[47:14] worry every uh complex Lord just push it
[47:18] aside for a moment that we can receive
[47:20] what our request is that the beauty your
[47:22] beauty Lord may it be upon
[47:25] us Lord it is you
[47:28] used Beauty in the very
[47:30] beginning when you looked at your
[47:32] creation and you said it was very good
[47:34] that pleasantness that beauty that
[47:36] symmetry in your
[47:38] creation it's the most beautiful thing
[47:40] there's ever
[47:42] been Adam as a witness to each beautiful
[47:46] creature was inspired by its individual
[47:49] particular Beauty and use and utility
[47:51] and nature and he named
[47:53] it and he saw that it was fit for
[47:55] certain things
[47:57] Lord you even called Adam to be a tiller
[47:59] of the ground he was to be a a landscape
[48:02] artist he was to cultivate to nurture
[48:04] the soil and bring the good out of it
[48:06] get Beauty out of
[48:08] it and Lord that day when you brought
[48:10] the woman before him and he saw her it
[48:12] was such an immediate inspiration and
[48:15] Revelation that a name came
[48:17] forth he said she's woman I name her I
[48:20] call her
[48:22] woman Lord I believe that you're still
[48:24] using Beauty today
[48:27] it's the beauty of your word it's the
[48:29] beauty of Christ though to the world
[48:30] there was no Beauty in him that we would
[48:32] desire him there's still something
[48:35] attractive there's still something that
[48:38] is an attraction in this hour I pray
[48:40] Lord that you would help us as the
[48:42] members of your body as the people that
[48:44] has been created Lord may we learn to
[48:46] praise may we learn to worship may we
[48:48] learn to live and to broadcast and to
[48:50] share this gospel in the accurate light
[48:53] Lord that it might cause others to come
[48:56] forth
[48:57] Lord not a repulsive demonstration as
[48:59] these Greek artists rendered Adam and
[49:01] the woman in such a way that was
[49:03] horrible and filthy but Lord may we
[49:04] capture the true essence of Beauty in
[49:06] our lives that would cause others to be
[49:08] thirsty to long for
[49:10] you Lord I know they'll always be
[49:14] critics but there's ones who are victims
[49:17] of the critics that need to hear and see
[49:19] a real
[49:21] life we'll never be able to convince
[49:23] Satan we'll never be able to convince
[49:26] those who've hardened their hearts and
[49:28] are the tool of the devil but perhaps
[49:29] Lord there's others who have just been
[49:31] found in the chaos of leod
[49:35] DEA and you want light to shine this
[49:37] beauty to shine out of
[49:40] Zion that the Gentile could see your
[49:43] light and come to know you bless us I
[49:47] pray tonight as we close this service as
[49:48] we're soon dismissed thank you for your
[49:51] presence that's been with us tonight I
[49:52] thank you for these believers they so
[49:54] attentive father so uh uh diligent to
[49:57] absorb these words so I pray that you
[49:59] reward them for that Lord the sincerity
[50:01] is to your word and to you not to me not
[50:03] to this church their obedience and their
[50:06] hungers connected with their the
[50:08] Revelation they have of you in this hour
[50:11] not a tradition of a church service a
[50:13] midweek service a a car Charisma of a
[50:16] pastor lord it's genuine it's sincere
[50:18] reward them I pray I ask this in the
[50:20] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
