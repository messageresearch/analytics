[0:00] so matthew chapter 5
[0:02] start with verse 38 and said teaching on
[0:05] forgiveness you have heard that if that
[0:07] it had been said an eye for an eye and a
[0:09] tooth for tooth
[0:11] but i say unto you that you resist not
[0:14] evil but whosoever shall smite thee on
[0:16] thy right cheek turn to him
[0:18] the other also and if any man will sue
[0:20] thee at the law and take away thy coat
[0:22] let them have thy cloak also and
[0:25] whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile
[0:27] go with him twain give to him that
[0:29] asketh he and from him that would borrow
[0:31] thee turn not thou away
[0:33] you have heard that it hath been said
[0:34] thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[0:36] thine enemy but i say unto you love your
[0:38] enemies bless them that curse you and do
[0:40] good to them that hate you and pray for
[0:42] them which despitefully use you and
[0:45] persecute you
[0:46] reading this again it can almost bring
[0:49] like this feeling of oh great you know
[0:52] anybody reads this then they know
[0:53] exactly just exactly how to take
[0:55] advantage of us and but i think there's
[0:57] a way that we can absolutely misread
[0:59] this
[0:59] he said that you may be the children of
[1:01] your father which is in heaven for he
[1:02] maketh his son to rise on the evil and
[1:04] on the good and sendeth reign on the
[1:06] just and on the unjust for if you love
[1:08] them which love you what reward have ye
[1:10] do not even the publicans the same and
[1:12] if you salute your brethren only what do
[1:13] ye more than others
[1:16] do not even the public and so but ye
[1:18] be therefore perfect even as your father
[1:21] which is in heaven is perfect amen you
[1:24] can be seated
[1:29] again we're on the subject
[1:32] of setting limits within the subject of
[1:34] barriers and boundaries
[1:36] and i'm just going to jump right in
[1:38] where we had to stop on sunday and come
[1:41] back to some things we had to skip over
[1:43] so i'm not there maybe there's going to
[1:44] be a lot of
[1:46] some review and principles but it's just
[1:48] necessary to do it
[1:49] in order to kind of close the loop on
[1:51] what we're ministering on on sunday
[1:53] and we're really looking at the
[1:56] setting limits is looking asking the
[1:58] question in light of these scriptures in
[1:59] luke chapter six here matthew chapter
[2:01] five some of the many other scriptures
[2:03] we could read which is speaking about
[2:04] the character of a christian even some
[2:06] of the things we see in the beatitudes
[2:08] and the conduct
[2:09] of the believer it can set a particular
[2:12] standard that we we might think
[2:13] describes a weakness or kind of a
[2:15] pushover mentality so we're exploring
[2:17] whether we are empowered by the word of
[2:19] god uh to set boundaries uh protective
[2:22] boundaries and things that kind of carve
[2:24] out who we are and what we're called to
[2:25] do
[2:26] and
[2:27] the
[2:28] then we're just kind of wanting to pick
[2:30] up where we were and this will kind of
[2:31] maybe add a little bit more uh context
[2:33] to the things that we've been
[2:35] speaking on through the first few parts
[2:37] but then also in particular on sunday
[2:40] that this subject is
[2:42] about liberty as much as it is about
[2:44] limits so we say well setting limits
[2:46] even that thought we're setting limits
[2:48] oh you can only go so far but really
[2:50] we're talking about liberty even more
[2:52] than we are about limits because it's
[2:54] the setting the limits is actually going
[2:57] to limit be
[2:58] liberating you from bondage
[3:00] bondage holds you back for the bond is
[3:03] to be stripped away and removed away it
[3:05] sets you at liberty so when we talk
[3:06] about limits immediately we can start
[3:08] thinking oh well there's an end to this
[3:09] there's a stop to this you can only go
[3:11] so far it's restrictive and we talked
[3:13] about that before how the word of god
[3:15] seems very restrictive and constraining
[3:17] and people feel bound or in bondage
[3:18] because of the word of god but you if
[3:20] you could submit yourself to the word of
[3:22] god there's the greatest liberty
[3:24] submitting yourself to the word of god
[3:25] all things are possible
[3:27] leave it to yourself well with man this
[3:28] is impossible so there's impossibilities
[3:31] uh made possible and the probable
[3:34] the improbable is brought very near as
[3:36] probable when you begin to believe god's
[3:38] word and submit yourself to the
[3:40] supernatural and if you think barriers
[3:42] and boundaries just even that language
[3:44] and those terms may feel very
[3:46] restricting but it's the barriers that
[3:48] are restricting it's the boundaries that
[3:50] are liberating
[3:51] barriers restrict us boundaries actually
[3:54] liberate us
[3:55] and galatians chapter 5 paul says and
[3:57] there's a lot of statements we've drawn
[3:59] from here in galatians
[4:02] that have touched on the good pride the
[4:03] bad pride the
[4:05] living for others and some of those
[4:07] things a few services ago he says stand
[4:09] fast therefore in the liberty where with
[4:12] christ hath made us free so there is a
[4:14] liberty
[4:15] in christ christ hath made us free you
[4:17] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[4:19] make you free so here is the way the
[4:21] truth the life that has made us free so
[4:24] it says say stand fast therefore in this
[4:27] liberty in this freedom you have in this
[4:30] uh liberation that you're experiencing
[4:32] in christ it says stand fast therefore
[4:34] in it and be not entangled again with
[4:36] the yoke of bondage
[4:39] so there's a yoke of bondage bondage has
[4:42] a yoke a way of fasting in itself to you
[4:44] to where you are bound
[4:46] you are hindered you're chained as it
[4:48] were you become a slave this yoke is a
[4:50] negative yoke it is a press it is a
[4:52] burden he's saying you're free so being
[4:55] free don't return back to the yoke of
[4:58] bondage
[4:59] and the word yoke is used of any burden
[5:01] the yoke is this word yoke is used of
[5:03] any or bondage and even that of slavery
[5:07] so we think of a yoke of bondage that
[5:09] would be a negative thing right i don't
[5:10] know anybody sign up and request and
[5:12] pray for this morning lord i really
[5:14] desire yoka bandage and i don't know
[5:16] that we're praying for a yoke of bondage
[5:18] but yet we taught in the scripture in
[5:19] matthew chapter 11
[5:21] verses 28 to 30 come unto me all ye that
[5:24] labor and are heavy-laden and i will
[5:27] give you rest so this idea of someone
[5:29] bearing something they ought not to bear
[5:31] something being brought down it's it's
[5:33] the idea of something being dragged down
[5:35] in a heaviness and a weight he says come
[5:37] on to me ye that are laden with a very
[5:39] heavy uh sins and burdens and anxieties
[5:42] and cares and you that are striving and
[5:44] wrestling come and i'll give you rest
[5:46] and as you show up to rece to get your
[5:49] rest you're wanting to unload of
[5:50] everything and you want him to give this
[5:52] yoke of bondage up and he says take my
[5:54] yoke upon you
[5:56] so there's it's not that you're gonna
[5:58] live a yolk free life is it the yolks
[6:00] that are bad in the eggs is that what we
[6:02] try to get rid of or is it the good part
[6:03] i i don't know anymore i do know at one
[6:06] time brother bram said don't live in a
[6:07] valley and don't eat eggs
[6:10] and here we are
[6:11] eating ecstasy living in phoenix
[6:14] uh and so there's he said there's a yoke
[6:17] you're exchanging that you have a yoke
[6:19] of bondage you have a burden you have a
[6:21] labor you have a strife and he says come
[6:23] and unload yourself but then he doesn't
[6:25] leave us burden free he says take my
[6:28] yoke upon you so this is used of even a
[6:30] burden which you ought to bear a cross
[6:32] that you ought to carry he who will
[6:34] follow me will deny himself and take his
[6:37] cross he says take my yoke upon you and
[6:39] learn of me for i am meek and lowly in
[6:41] heart remember this is the good this is
[6:43] connected with the good pride the way up
[6:45] is down
[6:46] and ye shall find rest unto your souls
[6:48] so the secret to rest isn't just getting
[6:50] rid of every yoke but it's taking the
[6:52] right one on
[6:54] he says for my yoke is easy and my
[6:56] burden is light
[6:58] there is a yoke of bondage that we could
[7:00] carry and that we we become exhausted
[7:02] under that it's restraining us that is a
[7:05] slavery to
[7:06] to things of the world and a slavery to
[7:08] the flesh and we exchange that yoke for
[7:11] another yoke one that is not bondage in
[7:13] slavery to sin or self but it's a yoke
[7:15] which is a burden of christ that we take
[7:18] upon ourselves and we actually find rest
[7:20] taking that yoke on
[7:22] and the yoke is i think it's ministered
[7:24] on quite a bit what that would look like
[7:26] on an ox or a beast of burden and even
[7:28] the balancing that would take place and
[7:30] this yoke is going to put it into an
[7:32] office and it's going to be able to use
[7:34] the strength and the inner inner energy
[7:36] of that beast uh to accomplish a work
[7:38] and a job but this is something i want
[7:40] you to think in the beginning that when
[7:42] we talk about establishing limits or
[7:44] setting limits it's about liberating
[7:46] yourself so that you can live a
[7:48] limitless life
[7:49] i know it's the paradox but it's
[7:51] important for us to realize there's ways
[7:52] that we have to do things in ways that
[7:54] we have to cement ourselves therefore
[7:56] unto god then resist the devil and he'll
[7:58] flee put the word of god first first the
[8:00] kingdom of god put the word first in all
[8:02] things
[8:03] put put things of god in your view and
[8:06] you're bringing yourself into the right
[8:07] kind of headship to experience the
[8:09] things of god the right way
[8:12] we could uh go down this line of how we
[8:14] are prisoners of jesus christ we are
[8:17] slaves of christ and we are slaves of
[8:19] christ by choice paul said i'm a
[8:21] prisoner he said he was a servant and
[8:22] the very word bond slave
[8:24] speaking of one who is a slave to christ
[8:27] a love slave is the term brother branham
[8:29] used and so we become prisoners of
[8:31] christ and it's by choice that we become
[8:33] a slave to christ
[8:35] and that's the framework within that god
[8:37] wants us to work
[8:39] there's a there's a there's a there's a
[8:41] field that god wants to work us to work
[8:42] within there's a way he wants us to work
[8:44] under headship he wants to work us to
[8:46] work under the headship of his word and
[8:48] that's where god wants us to experience
[8:50] liberty is under the yoke of christ
[8:54] and
[8:55] this is uh this is
[8:57] kind of at the heart of a lot of these
[8:59] things we're ministering on and sunday
[9:01] i'd like to examine
[9:03] this in greater detail but we cannot
[9:06] forfeit this liberty we have in christ
[9:09] for the sake of
[9:11] a family image
[9:13] this individual liberty we have in
[9:14] christ we cannot we cannot forsake that
[9:17] for
[9:18] the image of a happy couple
[9:21] remember the liberty that we have in
[9:23] christ we cannot forsake the individual
[9:25] liberty we have in christ for the sake
[9:26] of a group a group image a group power a
[9:29] group dynamic god has not and we're not
[9:31] asked to do it this seems like maybe a
[9:33] little bit of a paradox you're trying to
[9:34] struggle that well wait a minute god
[9:36] calls us to have healthy marriages and
[9:37] god calls us to be a part of the church
[9:39] and god wanted to become a family but
[9:41] notice how i said it you cannot
[9:43] accomplish the image that god wants you
[9:45] to accomplish by forfeiting your liberty
[9:47] and christ
[9:49] and and we don't recognize it but in a
[9:51] lot of ways
[9:53] we actually forsake our individual
[9:55] liberty and jesus christ our joy our
[9:57] happiness peace and all the things that
[9:59] the fruits of the spirit wants to bring
[10:00] we actually walk away from that to
[10:02] conform to some model that we think is
[10:04] what's pleasing to the lord and well the
[10:06] lord says we ought to do this and the
[10:08] bible says we ought to do this and we're
[10:09] just forcing ourselves to fit a
[10:11] particular image not really like rising
[10:13] we're playing more to the pretense and
[10:15] the politics and personality of things
[10:17] instead of the personal liberty of
[10:18] christ leading us to be a part of a
[10:20] dynamic where everyone has made an
[10:23] individual choice to submit themselves
[10:25] to christ and submit themselves to one
[10:27] another and everything is operating very
[10:28] very beautifully which is what happened
[10:30] in the book of acts and we're not just
[10:32] saying well we got to have this and we
[10:33] got to have that we need to do this we
[10:34] need to do that we all just do it by
[10:36] force
[10:38] that's what i want to preach on sunday
[10:39] though
[10:42] so we can't forfeit this liberty in
[10:45] christ
[10:47] for some image that we have of what
[10:48] christ wants
[10:50] by following and exercising the liberty
[10:53] that christ gives us and taking his yoke
[10:55] upon us we will step into the expression
[10:58] of that you're gonna you'll write
[11:00] another book of acts by pursuing the
[11:02] individual liberty that you have in
[11:04] christ it will be written in your life
[11:06] and not by trying to impersonate it
[11:09] in the message christ is the mystery of
[11:10] god revealed and in this brother brown
[11:11] mentions it a few times about paul being
[11:13] a love slave and then relates it to us
[11:15] and so there's some go and listen to
[11:17] this portion and read this portion just
[11:19] before this it's very very beautiful and
[11:21] i had to trim this down for time's sake
[11:24] this evening he says it's not a group
[11:27] it's a personal vindication of a
[11:29] pregnant child of god filled with the
[11:31] holy ghost
[11:32] so surrendered to god that he don't care
[11:34] about anything else
[11:37] we should say that's me
[11:39] hey
[11:40] that's me i'm a i'm a pregnated child of
[11:42] god the word of god is living inside of
[11:44] me and it's the personal vindication of
[11:46] you
[11:47] this this is this is you you have to
[11:49] look at this very very personally it's
[11:50] not a group it's a personal vindication
[11:52] of a pregnant child of god filled the
[11:53] holy ghost and then there's this
[11:54] surrendering soul surrendered to god
[11:56] that he don't care about anything else
[11:58] in the holy spirit living its life
[12:01] pulsating through him showing the
[12:03] personal vindication of the word itself
[12:06] expressing itself to the people and to
[12:08] the world and that's what he wants to do
[12:11] through you not just through brother
[12:12] branham and not through the preachers or
[12:14] or through the piano players or the song
[12:16] leaders uh through kind of the the upper
[12:18] crest of a church i'll look at them
[12:20] they're the real christians no he wants
[12:21] to do it through you
[12:23] this is a personal vindication it's not
[12:25] a group move it's like uh uh there's a i
[12:27] don't know if i've expressed this
[12:28] publicly but in in having a church
[12:32] called arizona believers church uh
[12:34] there's there's three kinds of believers
[12:35] in any
[12:36] church arizona believer church
[12:39] you're a make believer unbeliever a
[12:41] believer it's arizona believers church
[12:43] this isn't bride of the seventh seal
[12:45] third pull
[12:46] kuben daba three times seven
[12:49] right
[12:50] shah tabernacle
[12:53] it's not just something so it's like
[12:55] well if you go there you better be bride
[12:57] of the third pool speaking squirrels
[12:58] kind of church oh it's kind of hey if
[13:00] you're an unbeliever come and hear the
[13:02] word and come to life to realize you are
[13:04] a believer from the beginning
[13:07] it's it's to the individual person to
[13:09] make this connection with god it's not a
[13:11] group move
[13:12] it is the individual personal
[13:14] vindication of the individual and and
[13:17] churches exist for the sole purpose of
[13:19] encouraging and and energizing
[13:23] individuals to experience the personal
[13:25] vindication of the holy spirit
[13:28] the personal vindication of the word
[13:30] and so setting limits it's not a matter
[13:32] of you can't do this and you can't do
[13:33] that and you can only do this and you're
[13:35] going to do that it's about exercising
[13:36] faith
[13:38] it's about saying no to the devil
[13:40] setting limit is about saying no to the
[13:42] devil saying no to things that are not
[13:43] expedient that are not not that are
[13:45] holding your faith back that are
[13:47] compromising your understanding of the
[13:48] word of god it's about uh saying no to
[13:51] situations and circumstances that
[13:52] disturb your peace
[13:54] by saying no to situations and
[13:56] circumstances and ways of thinking and
[13:58] acting and interacting that uh sterilize
[14:02] your confidence
[14:04] kind of beat you down
[14:06] i and if i haven't mentioned it here
[14:08] before i i'm very happy to mention it
[14:10] now
[14:11] the one of the most misused or one of
[14:13] the
[14:13] statements of brother branham that has
[14:15] become just like this bully club is the
[14:17] statement that uh the sickest body i
[14:20] know is the body of jesus christ
[14:22] and it's as if that that quota is still
[14:24] being used to make everybody feel that
[14:26] they're sick
[14:27] but brethren said there's more to this
[14:28] ministry than divine healing
[14:31] and he's talking about this healing that
[14:32] his ministry was to bring and the the
[14:35] the anointment the salve the bomb that
[14:37] the body needed at that time and he's
[14:39] saying he's diagnosed in a spiritual
[14:41] condition there was an opening of the
[14:43] word that was sent into the body and has
[14:45] energized it and she is no longer the
[14:47] sickest body on the face of the earth he
[14:49] says she is risen
[14:52] and so we want to strip away any a
[14:55] manhandling any abuse any any bully with
[14:58] a three-pointed club that's trying to
[14:59] beat you down and make you feel
[15:00] compromised and then kind of pointing to
[15:02] themselves as being the one that can fix
[15:04] you
[15:06] and the one that can make you feel
[15:07] better christ your husband is here
[15:10] to nurture you and to bring you to
[15:12] health and to bring you to rapturing
[15:13] faith
[15:15] setting limits is about recognizing the
[15:16] pressures
[15:18] that force us to do things that we don't
[15:20] want to do
[15:22] and and i want to come back around to
[15:25] this
[15:26] at the very end hopefully
[15:29] that there's the pressures toxic
[15:31] pressures that erode our self-control
[15:34] and we'll start acting
[15:37] we'll start acting outside of our true
[15:38] nature
[15:40] not your not your earthly nature not for
[15:43] me not the nature of my parents but
[15:46] outside the nature of your heavenly
[15:47] father
[15:48] and it's important for you to recognize
[15:50] when external pressure and situations
[15:53] and conflict is making you act
[15:56] differently than you know that you
[15:58] should or have as a son or daughter of
[16:00] god
[16:01] and instead of having this wake up oh i
[16:03] just must stop you son of god no you're
[16:04] probably just putting yourself under
[16:06] pressure and in conflict and
[16:09] experiencing things that are causing you
[16:10] to be very toxic interactions or things
[16:13] that are taking place that are causing
[16:14] you to act differently than you know
[16:16] that you ought to and then not you can
[16:18] and that should be a warning flag to you
[16:19] very quickly wait a minute something's
[16:21] taking place i'm no longer acting
[16:23] incongruent with what's in my heart i'm
[16:25] acting hypocritically that's not my
[16:27] nature to be cynical it's not my nature
[16:29] to be critical it's not my nature to be
[16:30] fearful it's not in my nature to
[16:32] disbelieve or to be harsh and those
[16:35] different things and you see that
[16:36] something's pushing you to live outside
[16:38] the bounds of your true nature in christ
[16:40] and we need to be very very sensitive to
[16:42] that
[16:44] in romans chapter 16 verse 17
[16:48] it says now i beseech you brethren mark
[16:50] them which cause divisions and offenses
[16:52] contrary to the doctrine which you have
[16:53] learned and avoid them i even think the
[16:56] greek is translated to shun to shun them
[17:00] we are closing sunday in the thought
[17:02] that we are not
[17:03] forced to consent to evil
[17:07] uh or we are not forced to
[17:09] participate in sin we are not
[17:12] uh subject we are not forced to subject
[17:15] ourselves to unrighteous conduct like
[17:16] volunteer for it and use the scripture
[17:19] unreasonably say well i guess i have to
[17:21] do this and i guess i have to do that
[17:23] and we were using this to show that what
[17:25] we read in the new testament in the red
[17:28] letter christ speaking of
[17:30] forgiving our enemies and loving our
[17:32] enemies and forgiving one another and
[17:34] turning the other cheek and i want to
[17:35] come to it here in just a moment
[17:37] that the word is expanding what that
[17:40] means
[17:41] and showing that in some context and
[17:43] again i think on sunday i said let's
[17:44] just consider these scriptures to see
[17:46] whether or not there are contexts where
[17:48] we can say enough
[17:51] and so it says mark then which cause
[17:52] divisions and hurts and offenses uh that
[17:55] stumbling contrary to the doctrine which
[17:56] you've learned and avoid them so you to
[17:58] mark them and then there's to be some
[18:00] separation or distance from them
[18:03] and so we need to learn and i was jesus
[18:04] to say we need to learn to set
[18:06] boundaries just in this alone that if we
[18:08] mark somebody who's acting contrary to
[18:10] the word of god then there ought to be
[18:12] some conduct which means which is
[18:15] equal to avoidance in order to even
[18:17] fulfill the scripture
[18:19] and where we make our mistakes sometimes
[18:22] and boundaries
[18:23] and my heart is just overwhelmed with it
[18:26] because i think what we begin to think
[18:28] is external boundaries so we think well
[18:30] i need to learn to lock the door i need
[18:31] to pull the shades i need to let
[18:33] everyone know don't come without asking
[18:35] first or but
[18:37] most of the time we're really we're
[18:38] conscious of external boundaries but
[18:40] we're the boundaries that get violated
[18:41] the most are the internal ones
[18:43] that we now we're not even conscious of
[18:46] until afterwards we just feel like
[18:47] something's wrong we're like that wasn't
[18:48] right
[18:50] that's not right i don't need to do this
[18:51] i don't need to do that i shouldn't be
[18:52] thinking that i shouldn't be subjecting
[18:54] myself to that so we need them to
[18:55] clearly define for ourselves we need to
[18:57] recognize that the word of god speaks
[18:59] about this and i ought to walk in that
[19:01] and it's a virtue it's an inside virtue
[19:04] it's something has to do with your
[19:06] your character and your relationship
[19:07] with jesus christ i ought to protect
[19:09] that that's something that's worthy of
[19:11] defense there's things that we must be
[19:13] it must be clearly defined to ourselves
[19:15] and then also we ought to clearly define
[19:16] to others and then even address the
[19:18] violations of those things because it
[19:20] disturbs our faith
[19:23] romans chapter 12 verses 17 and 18.
[19:26] again we're just looking at that
[19:28] uh um that principle that here he's
[19:30] saying with respect to offenses that you
[19:33] can mark somebody who's bringing the
[19:34] offense and then avoid them and that's
[19:36] contrary to this idea oh well you just
[19:38] gotta lean into it somebody's offending
[19:40] you you're a christian you just gotta
[19:41] you kind of get you gotta get under
[19:42] their thumb and let them mistreat you
[19:45] in romans chapter 12 verses 17 and 18
[19:50] recompense to no man evil for evil
[19:53] and so if someone treats you evilly
[19:55] don't treat him evil bag
[19:58] you're never justified
[20:00] in treating returning
[20:02] uh unrighteous behavior
[20:04] to somebody who's behaved unrighteously
[20:06] never justified
[20:09] what happens is if you're ever
[20:10] mistreated by uh by somebody let's say
[20:13] i'm not gonna make it a believer make
[20:14] believer anything but if somebody does
[20:16] something evil to you and you respond
[20:18] evil back guess what their justification
[20:21] for treating you evil to begin with is
[20:23] the way you responded
[20:25] see i told you
[20:28] yeah all i did was do this little thing
[20:30] to them look what they did right back to
[20:31] me see they deserved it to begin with
[20:33] and your response becomes the
[20:35] justification for the initial offense
[20:38] and that's all they're going to talk
[20:39] about
[20:39] is your response and you're going to be
[20:41] like well wait a minute wait a minute
[20:43] you punched me first whoa hold on yeah
[20:45] but you know what i was just testing you
[20:47] look what you did
[20:49] i was and all of a sudden it's your
[20:51] response that becomes where the
[20:52] limelight is being shown on it so never
[20:54] recompense evil for evil provide things
[20:57] honest in the sight of all men and then
[20:58] this beautiful
[21:01] sensitivity to paul if it be possible as
[21:03] much as is in your power as much as life
[21:05] in you if it's within your power to live
[21:07] peaceably if it even be possible live
[21:10] peaceably with all men
[21:12] that ought to be our desire and he
[21:14] continues to say that there's a way that
[21:15] you can conduct yourself even with your
[21:16] enemies where you bring a shame to them
[21:18] by heaping hot coals upon them it's
[21:20] going to make them see then they're
[21:21] going to feel this
[21:22] this shame by the way that you treat
[21:24] them he's saying if it be possible
[21:26] suggesting that in every instance it's
[21:28] not even possible to live peaceably with
[21:30] all men but he says we ought to try
[21:34] to live in a state of peace with our
[21:35] neighbors and our friends and sometimes
[21:37] even family is often hard
[21:41] thank you
[21:42] honesty appreciate that
[21:45] right
[21:47] should we talk about the neighbors next
[21:48] door it's been a while since we
[21:49] mentioned the neighbors in the apartment
[21:50] next door
[21:51] it's really hard to get along with the
[21:52] neighbors there and you know
[21:54] apartment number 212.
[21:56] but it is
[21:58] it can be very difficult
[22:00] to maintain peace
[22:02] uh with all these different
[22:03] relationships that we that we have with
[22:05] other people and the different dynamics
[22:07] that exist within that but regardless of
[22:09] how hard it is we should still try okay
[22:12] if as much as life in you live
[22:14] peacefully with all men so never let
[22:16] your conduct be the reason for unrest
[22:19] never let your attitude be the reason
[22:20] for conflict never let it be your
[22:22] behavior and your stubbornness or your
[22:24] uh um your uh insensitivities and and
[22:27] your bullheadedness whatever however you
[22:28] want to describe your conduct that it
[22:30] never be your barriers that are causing
[22:33] unrest and the lack of peace within a
[22:35] relationship but it says uh uh as much
[22:37] as life and you live peacefully with all
[22:39] men
[22:41] but this peace is not achieved by
[22:43] abolishing boundaries
[22:45] it's not by saying well i guess i got to
[22:46] live at peace i just need to surrender i
[22:48] just need to
[22:49] raise the white flag and just give in
[22:51] and they want me to do this for the for
[22:53] the sake of peace i'm just going to give
[22:54] in does that sound familiar
[22:57] just so that there's no more strife and
[22:59] there's no more complaining just so they
[23:00] don't get mad at me and just so they
[23:02] don't bully me and i know what they're
[23:03] going to say if i don't do this and
[23:04] listen we experience this so often
[23:07] and and and we know it we're going into
[23:09] it knowing we're compromising somewhere
[23:13] and the reason why we're doing this is
[23:14] we don't want the blow up we don't want
[23:16] to get the feedback and we don't want to
[23:17] do this and we don't want to do it and
[23:19] we think that we're bringing peace but
[23:20] you don't live with peace within your
[23:22] spirit when you do it
[23:24] hello
[23:26] that's giving in
[23:29] that that's that's not recognizing
[23:31] certain certain patterns of behavior
[23:32] that are rob you of your peace that are
[23:34] feeding this cycle of resentment and
[23:36] bitterness and making things even
[23:38] exponentially more difficult as things
[23:40] continue and you ought to say whoa stop
[23:42] lord help me what is it i'm engaging in
[23:44] that is creating this dynamic where i'm
[23:46] no longer even happy to go to church
[23:48] because i come with so much resentment
[23:50] and this is happening and that's
[23:51] happening where is it where's where has
[23:53] something gone wrong
[23:57] so you're not going to find this piece
[23:59] by just surrendering and giving him well
[24:01] let's just i just want to give in i'll
[24:02] just agree i'm just going to be i'm
[24:04] compliant or i'm just going to whatever
[24:06] the demands are we'll meet them for the
[24:08] sake of peace that's never going to
[24:10] bring peace
[24:11] because a christian has a duty to set
[24:13] limits to protect their hearts
[24:16] you have this body this the the mind
[24:20] the soul let's say the soul has been
[24:22] bought and it's sealed by the holy ghost
[24:23] but that spirit and that body is also
[24:25] the lord's and you have a duty to
[24:26] protect it
[24:29] it's a duty that you have
[24:31] so does the word set limits
[24:33] if you want to turn to first corinthians
[24:34] chapter 7 i skipped over this on sunday
[24:38] and
[24:40] i think it would have made
[24:42] if i believe it would have fit much
[24:44] better on sunday and so i apologize if
[24:47] it seems to be a little disconcordant to
[24:49] the flow this evening
[24:51] but i want to reference another example
[24:53] and as you read this be very very strict
[24:55] in your thinking don't don't either
[24:58] pursue personal justification or kind of
[25:00] apply it as a template to somebody
[25:01] else's situation
[25:02] but we're just wanting you to consider
[25:04] that god has boundaries
[25:06] and that there's some things in our mind
[25:07] that might seem to be uh very
[25:10] restrictive
[25:11] and very harsh
[25:12] but god has uh
[25:15] he has something that he's trying to
[25:16] accomplish and everything that god does
[25:18] and every principle he elicits ought to
[25:21] fulfill this objective that god has
[25:24] so you so that you can't just take any
[25:25] principle of god's word and just
[25:27] misdirect it say well i'm keeping the
[25:30] principle no if it's not fulfilling his
[25:32] objective you've misapplied the
[25:33] principle you've got to excuse somehow
[25:36] you don't have it lined up right you're
[25:37] you're pointing at the wrong thing you
[25:38] can't just say well it says to do this
[25:40] and as long as we do this it's good no
[25:42] it says to do this in order to achieve
[25:44] this
[25:45] and if you're doing it it's not
[25:46] achieving the results that god said it
[25:48] ought to achieve then you probably got
[25:49] something wrong in the application
[25:51] somewhere
[25:52] so first corinthians chapter 7 verses 12
[25:54] to 15 he says but to the rest speak i
[25:56] not the lord if any brother that hath
[25:58] the wife that believeth not and she be
[26:00] pleased to dwell with him let him not
[26:02] put her away and the woman which hath a
[26:04] husband which believeth not and if he be
[26:07] pleased to dwell with her let her not
[26:09] leave him
[26:10] so
[26:11] here's a woman that is a believer
[26:13] husband is not a believer but he's ha
[26:15] they're happy together they're living
[26:16] peaceably together then she ought not to
[26:18] leave him and then if a brother have a
[26:20] wife that believeth not and she be happy
[26:23] to live with him as the unbeliever she's
[26:25] pleased
[26:26] and there they have peace within their
[26:27] home he says let him not put her away
[26:30] verse 14 for the unbelieving husband is
[26:32] sanctified by the wife and the
[26:33] unbelieving wife is sanctified by the
[26:35] husband
[26:36] elsewhere your children unclean but now
[26:38] are they holy and notice how paul
[26:40] summarizes this in verse 15 but if the
[26:42] unbelieving depart it's interesting that
[26:45] he chooses the language to say it's the
[26:46] unbeliever that departs
[26:48] let him depart
[26:50] let the unbeliever depart
[26:53] a brother or sister is not under bondage
[26:56] in such such cases
[26:58] but god hath called us to peace
[27:01] if if a believer is married to an
[27:03] unbeliever and their strife and there's
[27:06] discontent and there's
[27:08] uh marital abuse and emotional abuse and
[27:11] it's it's not harmonious
[27:14] and the husband the unbeliever wants to
[27:16] leave paul is saying that god's desire
[27:18] for you is peace
[27:21] and that there's there's not
[27:23] and again i want you to be very think be
[27:25] very careful here
[27:26] let me just say saying that the believer
[27:29] in this instance is not under bondage in
[27:31] those cases now he's not saying that
[27:32] they're therefore liberated as if the
[27:34] marriage never happened they can go get
[27:35] married again that's not the release
[27:37] that he's talking about but they're not
[27:38] forced to stay in this relationship
[27:41] where there's contention and there's
[27:42] marital strife and there's
[27:44] this yoke of bondage is bringing down
[27:46] this discouragement that this eroding of
[27:49] faith and this uh deterioration of
[27:51] confidence he says because god's called
[27:53] us to peace
[27:55] and god's word is not going to demand
[27:58] you do something and in the perfect
[28:00] obedience of it the product is unrest
[28:03] there's nothing in the word of god is
[28:05] going to ask you to do and i have
[28:06] submitted perfectly and i have submitted
[28:08] perfectly to this word and all i am in
[28:10] torment and saying no something's wrong
[28:12] somewhere you haven't perfectly
[28:13] submitted it's perfect submission all is
[28:16] at rest once i've perfectly submitted to
[28:18] a promise of god it's going to yield
[28:20] peaceable fruit once i've perfectly
[28:22] submitted to the word of god it's going
[28:23] to yield righteous fruit
[28:25] and so if there's torment and there
[28:28] and there's a loss of faith and there's
[28:30] a weakness in my supposed adherence
[28:32] strictly to the word of god that it's
[28:34] important to take a step back not
[28:35] abandon the word that you believe you're
[28:37] adhering to but take a step back and ask
[28:39] the lord what part is a miss
[28:41] is it my own heart am i actually the the
[28:44] unbeliever in this instance am i the one
[28:46] that's causing the lack of peace am i
[28:48] not am i being selfish am i the one
[28:50] that's not doing my part and it just it
[28:52] creates a re-evaluation
[28:55] but could we not agree that if this word
[28:58] this word being present
[29:01] it indicates that it's not always
[29:04] bondage for the sake of some
[29:06] uh for the sake of some principle it's
[29:08] the peace that god wants us to
[29:10] experience
[29:12] there are boundaries in marriage
[29:14] it's actually saying that in this
[29:16] instance where you have two that are
[29:17] living together a man and a wife are
[29:18] married one's a believer one's the
[29:20] unbeliever but they're not at peace he
[29:21] says then let the unbeliever depart
[29:25] and even in the departing you're not
[29:26] under bondage in that instance we have
[29:27] to feel that something is a loss and
[29:29] something is amiss and that you're
[29:30] walking uh uh somehow handicapped with
[29:33] god
[29:35] it identifies a boundary in marriage
[29:39] and then there's yes there's barriers to
[29:41] a happy marriage
[29:43] brother branham has asked this question
[29:45] and we had referenced these on sunday
[29:47] and this is where i thought there'd just
[29:48] be tremendous continuity brother i'm
[29:49] talking about be salty in those several
[29:51] different instances where he's asked
[29:52] about a marital difference
[29:55] and he says just be salty just be salty
[29:56] and he's mean don't be a smart alec
[29:59] not that kind of salty right
[30:01] uh don't be a smart alec don't be at you
[30:04] know don't agitate and don't stir things
[30:06] up and don't try to you know assert your
[30:08] spirituality over he says just be salty
[30:10] just be sweet be humble
[30:13] and so we'd read the statement from
[30:15] there
[30:16] and then
[30:17] this is another question and answers
[30:19] question 285 brother branham i believe a
[30:20] woman should be subject to her husband
[30:22] and all the brothers said
[30:24] but if a christian woman has a sinner
[30:25] husband who does not even come to one of
[30:27] your services and wants his wife to do
[30:29] things cutting her hair wearing shorts
[30:31] and going to ungodly places is this
[30:32] woman supposed to be subject to this man
[30:35] in this way please explain this more
[30:37] clear clearly as this is a question that
[30:39] is asked often
[30:41] you understand the question
[30:43] he says no sister you're not subject to
[30:44] such a person
[30:48] no sister you are not subject to such a
[30:50] person no indeedy
[30:52] for this cause you'll leave everything
[30:53] enclave to god now the thing says if
[30:56] that man wants to live with you and you
[30:57] stay christian so i know it's a fragment
[30:59] but he's saying look
[31:00] if you if you can live peaceably
[31:03] if you're pleased to dwell if you're
[31:04] pleased to be with one another and he
[31:06] knows you're a christian and he supports
[31:07] you and he's there for you and it's it's
[31:09] not causing strife and he's not trying
[31:11] to force you uh uh to disobey the word
[31:13] of god he says you know he's saying it's
[31:15] like well then
[31:17] you remain but he says but if he's going
[31:18] to make you wear shorts cut your hair
[31:20] and do all these other things in ungodly
[31:22] places you seek first the kingdom of god
[31:24] and his righteousness you are not bound
[31:27] to such a person as that
[31:29] again i want you to be very careful in
[31:32] this and be very strict in your thinking
[31:34] i'm just using it i'm pointing out an
[31:36] example in the word of god as we think
[31:38] about setting limits
[31:39] and just to identify that there is a
[31:42] boundary that can be crossed
[31:44] that in the sanctity of marriage and
[31:46] even the headship of the husband in this
[31:47] question and answers the headship of the
[31:49] husband
[31:50] is so important that brother ben goes so
[31:52] far to say that if you believe the truth
[31:54] as a wife and your husband goes to a
[31:57] different church than the one where the
[31:58] truth is being preached he says just be
[32:00] salty and go with them
[32:03] because that headship is so important
[32:04] it's so strong but then he's saying but
[32:06] it can only go so far
[32:09] that headship cannot usurp the headship
[32:11] of jesus christ it cannot bring you into
[32:14] the bondage of sin it cannot force you
[32:16] to do things which are ungodly it cannot
[32:18] force you to begin to act inconsistently
[32:20] with the precepts of holiness and these
[32:22] scriptures in the word of god so there
[32:24] is a boundary that can be crossed
[32:28] and there's a boundary that can be
[32:29] crossed where you can stand gallantly
[32:31] and say no i cannot go that far i cannot
[32:34] permit sin to be exercised against me i
[32:37] do not have to consent against sin i do
[32:40] not have to permit evil there is a point
[32:42] at which i can be in the liberty of
[32:44] jesus christ and stand my ground
[32:48] the word allows for separation
[32:50] for the sake of peace in order to not do
[32:53] to be a slave to bondage
[32:55] because there's a boundary that's being
[32:56] crossed we mentioned on sunday we have
[32:58] the authority by the word of god to
[33:01] establish boundaries
[33:03] to set to set limits that are to protect
[33:05] us to protect our family to protect our
[33:07] children that's what applying the token
[33:08] token's all about
[33:11] that's setting a boundary
[33:13] that that that's saying you know what
[33:15] the world is going to stop here
[33:17] that's that's what they're talking about
[33:19] it's about a boundary
[33:21] and so i want you to constantly keep
[33:23] this in mind because on one hand maybe
[33:25] i'm trying to provoke our our our good
[33:28] pride to stand up for ourselves and be
[33:31] bold in the word of god to say no to the
[33:33] devil to say no to the flesh and advance
[33:35] further in the things of god but at the
[33:37] same time i want us all of us to
[33:39] individually recognize that there's a
[33:41] warning to us to not trespass across
[33:44] boundaries
[33:45] there's a warning about violating
[33:47] boundaries with being insensitive
[33:49] insensitive or engaging in hurtful
[33:51] conduct
[33:52] and if you'll look at matthew chapter
[33:54] five that's really where jesus is
[33:56] identifying it's not so much
[33:58] uh uh
[33:59] paramilitary action to overthrow the
[34:02] government and instead of laying down
[34:03] your arms and let the government abuse
[34:05] you he's not even talking about he's
[34:06] talking about interpersonal
[34:07] relationships
[34:10] family and friends and those things
[34:12] and in setting limits because it's these
[34:15] things we're reading it's telling us
[34:16] right i i need to be sensitive to these
[34:18] things that are defiling my conscience
[34:20] and weakening my spirit and causing me
[34:22] to be uh
[34:24] uh
[34:26] you know faithless as it were weaken my
[34:28] faith yeah that's that's part of it but
[34:30] then also are you the one that's causing
[34:32] other people offenses and hurts and harm
[34:35] so there's a there's a consciousness i
[34:37] need to be respectful i need to be sure
[34:38] that i'm acting appropriately
[34:40] and so setting limits is about
[34:42] demonstrating to others the the right
[34:44] kind of conduct and the way that you
[34:45] live but then also you setting the limit
[34:48] that then demonstrates to somebody who's
[34:50] a boundary violator so that they know
[34:51] what is right for their own good
[34:53] for their own correction
[34:55] matthew chapter 5 verses 38 to 42
[34:59] i'm gonna i'm asking you individually
[35:00] are you following me to this point
[35:03] at matthew chapter 5 verses 38 to 42. we
[35:06] read a lot more in our text
[35:08] but we're just going to read these
[35:09] verses you have heard that it had been
[35:11] said an eye for an eye and a tooth for
[35:13] tooth i believe it was
[35:14] martin luther king jr that said if we
[35:16] all lived by that everybody we'd be
[35:18] blind
[35:20] i'm going to amen brother martin luther
[35:23] king jr on that you've heard it that has
[35:24] been said an eye for an eye and a tooth
[35:26] for tooth but i say unto you that you
[35:27] resist not evil
[35:29] but whosoever shall smite thee on the
[35:31] right cheek turn to him the other also
[35:33] now the language is suggesting not so
[35:36] much of a punch or an act of aggression
[35:39] but some sort of demeaning act in order
[35:42] to put you in your place the backhanded
[35:44] compliment you know
[35:46] this is a slap to the face to assert
[35:48] someone's dominance over you it says
[35:49] that you resist not evil but whosoever
[35:51] shall smite the on the right cheek turn
[35:52] to him the other also if any man will
[35:54] sue thee at the law take away and take
[35:56] away thy coat let them have thy cloak
[35:57] also and whosoever shall compel thee to
[35:59] go mild go with them twain give to him
[36:01] that asketh thee and from him that would
[36:03] borrow thee turn not thou away
[36:06] my purpose in approaching this is not to
[36:08] make it complicated but maybe for us to
[36:10] realize it's complex
[36:12] because we read these and think oh i
[36:14] just need to say yes to everything or i
[36:15] just need to give in to whatever comes
[36:16] and somebody asked me for this i just
[36:18] need to give it to him someone wants to
[36:19] borrow my car and never return it i
[36:20] guess i just need to let that happen and
[36:22] that's kind of don't worry brother jeff
[36:24] your truck's safe i'm shopping for a car
[36:27] pray for me this market's crazy can't
[36:28] find a house can't find a car
[36:31] we can find an rv big enough for all of
[36:32] us maybe we just do it all in one
[36:34] one place
[36:36] but it's there's a
[36:39] there's a principle that jesus is
[36:40] touching on and we don't want to just be
[36:41] real shallow kind of skimming over the
[36:43] top of it he's saying that you resist
[36:44] not evil this is not just this
[36:46] non-resistance to any kind of force that
[36:48] you're not allowed to defend your home
[36:50] and you're not allowed to defend
[36:51] yourself against an attacker jesus isn't
[36:53] even talking about he's not talking
[36:54] about self-defense in the in an act of
[36:57] violence against you he's not talking
[36:58] about uh uh military might or nations
[37:01] protecting their borders it's if that's
[37:03] not what jesus is talking about he's not
[37:05] the individual living his everyday life
[37:06] coming into conflict with other
[37:08] believers and other people and how that
[37:09] you ought to conduct yourselves for your
[37:11] own protection and also for their
[37:13] correction
[37:15] brother adam and this message serves we
[37:17] would see jesus he references this
[37:18] scripture he says so god humbles himself
[37:20] god is humility the man that can humble
[37:23] himself is on his road up he that exalts
[37:25] himself is on the road down
[37:27] always like he says the way up is down
[37:30] so we must remember that christianity is
[37:32] not pushing ahead and trying to get
[37:34] ahead of this fella but stepping back
[37:36] and taking the backseat that's what
[37:38] christianity is
[37:40] christianity is not about advancing
[37:41] yourself and pushing yourself forward
[37:43] and kind of he look at me here i am he
[37:46] says but
[37:47] you're not trying to compete and get
[37:48] ahead of this person and outdo this
[37:49] person he says just take a step back
[37:51] take in the back seat see letting the
[37:53] other fellow go on that's christianity
[37:55] humble yourself if you see you at the
[37:57] court and takes your coat give him your
[37:58] cloak also if he compels you to go mile
[38:00] go too if he smites one cheek turn the
[38:01] other
[38:03] he was our example in every way what we
[38:04] should be and if that life can reflect
[38:07] in us people will see christ in you you
[38:09] see
[38:10] when they can see that
[38:13] so it's a witness it's a testimonial
[38:16] when you act in a way that's incongruent
[38:19] with what the world's expecting
[38:22] is any any one of you ever accidentally
[38:24] made somebody mad while you were driving
[38:25] and the horn is honking and they speed
[38:27] up next to you and they meet you at a
[38:28] light and they roll down the window and
[38:30] they're just about to
[38:31] rip you to shreds and you say i am so
[38:34] sorry and they're like what
[38:36] what
[38:37] oh okay
[38:39] right and they don't know what to do
[38:41] like no no you meant to make that lane
[38:43] change and you intentionally didn't use
[38:46] your break your your blinker this let's
[38:48] fight
[38:49] you know it's like let's get it on and
[38:52] uh and they're just wanting michael
[38:53] buffer to pull up next year say next
[38:55] round and everyone start fighting it out
[38:57] and you're like hey man i'm sorry i made
[38:59] a mistake that's my bad i made a mistake
[39:00] they don't even know how to act
[39:02] when you apologize okay it's not even
[39:04] worth it you know it's no big deal don't
[39:06] worry about it they don't know how to
[39:06] act
[39:08] and so it's acting incongruent with what
[39:10] the world would do what somebody else is
[39:11] doing he says the witness of jesus
[39:12] christ when the world expects a certain
[39:15] response and you give them the response
[39:17] of christ it gets their attention
[39:20] he says people see christ in you
[39:22] now this
[39:24] what i'm going to read and you must be
[39:25] born again it is so beautiful so
[39:27] beautiful so beautiful
[39:28] god help me to bring this out
[39:31] because it's so beautiful he says be
[39:32] born again christians be born again then
[39:34] you won't have to say
[39:37] it's the hardest thing says you women
[39:38] it's the hardest thing for me to let my
[39:40] hair grow out he said if you if you're
[39:43] born again you won't have to say it's
[39:44] the hardest thing for me to let my hair
[39:45] grow
[39:46] he says now he says to the men he says
[39:48] you men it's the hardest thing for me to
[39:50] let my temper go boy i just have to tell
[39:52] my wife i get her boy and i shake her
[39:55] and i say i know i'm a christian i ought
[39:56] to do this but you shut up and you sit
[39:58] down
[40:00] and he says don't you do that don't do
[40:02] that see
[40:03] he says if you get born again and you
[40:05] talk about the way this is the way you
[40:06] ought to act
[40:07] you like to see a time you could put
[40:09] your arm around her and say sweetheart
[40:11] that isn't becoming to a christian
[40:13] two different responses
[40:15] one who says i know i shouldn't do this
[40:17] i'm a christian i shouldn't do this but
[40:18] you shut up and sit down
[40:20] it's a it's an action that is premised
[40:23] upon this authority of the husband
[40:26] and i know i shouldn't do this but you
[40:28] just you just and he's talking very
[40:30] harshly very very brutish and he says
[40:32] wouldn't you like to see a time when you
[40:34] can still address the same thing
[40:37] so i said wouldn't you like it to come a
[40:38] time where you won't say anything but
[40:39] says you still address the same thing
[40:40] sweetheart that isn't becoming to a
[40:42] christian he says that's the way you
[40:43] want to be isn't it
[40:45] he says you can be that way
[40:48] he says and when a man slaps you on one
[40:50] side of the face now let me let me back
[40:52] up
[40:54] brother's talking about addressing
[40:55] something that's not right he says is
[40:56] the right way to do it the wrong way to
[40:57] do it
[40:58] so there's not two options either say
[41:00] something and mess it up or don't say
[41:01] anything at all it's you could not say
[41:03] anything at all you could say something
[41:05] the wrong way or you can say something
[41:06] the right way
[41:10] it's not as
[41:11] binary as some people want to make it
[41:14] which isn't amazing that people
[41:16] say they're non-binary and in so doing
[41:18] have created a binary system
[41:22] i don't know food for thought
[41:26] got it i like it that's good
[41:30] he said
[41:31] when a man slaps you on one side of the
[41:34] face you don't have to cut him down with
[41:35] a pocketknife
[41:37] a man slaps you one side of the face say
[41:39] brother what reason did you do that for
[41:43] said there you are that's christianity
[41:46] he's shown us what christ was talking
[41:48] about
[41:49] notice he did not say that when he slaps
[41:50] you on the face you say oh you might as
[41:52] well do the other side too
[41:54] he said you there's there's a response
[41:56] brother why did you hit me
[41:59] what reason did you do that for there
[42:00] you are that's christianity when
[42:02] somebody says something evil about you
[42:03] instead of just trying to make a big
[42:05] show of it slip off somewhere and say
[42:07] heavenly father the man is immortal i
[42:09] pray that you'll take that spirit out of
[42:11] him don't let him do that i pray you
[42:13] save his life
[42:16] that's where brother bram talks about
[42:17] how you got to get to a place where you
[42:18] can pray for your enemies and
[42:21] really even bitterly intervene for those
[42:24] who mistreat you
[42:26] but this is this is brother branham
[42:27] looking at these conflicts and these
[42:29] situations
[42:30] and he's he's really bringing out the
[42:32] gold of what christ has to say
[42:35] that here
[42:36] somebody smites you on the cheek he says
[42:38] somebody smacks you slaps you on the
[42:40] side of the face he said you do not have
[42:42] to respond in kind or even escalate the
[42:44] violence like bringing a knife to a
[42:46] gunfight you know you know somebody
[42:48] stabs you and they pull out and then you
[42:49] pull out a gun he's saying that there's
[42:51] ought not to be an escalation to it that
[42:53] if they hit you you don't bring out the
[42:55] pocket knife and then the war is on hey
[42:57] all's fair and loving war we're really
[42:58] going to go at it
[43:00] and we're going to toe-to-toe you
[43:01] started this and you're going to be glad
[43:03] and i'll be the one to stop it he's
[43:05] saying no that's not how we act but he's
[43:07] also not saying just walk away
[43:11] right he's not or he's not saying coward
[43:13] down and give in he's also saying don't
[43:15] blow it up he's also saying he's not
[43:17] saying walk away but now there's been a
[43:18] response that says brother why did you
[43:20] do that
[43:22] and is there an appropriate response to
[43:25] the situation
[43:27] when jesus says to turn to him the other
[43:30] also
[43:31] this is not a prohibition of
[43:32] self-protection but it's about
[43:34] self-control
[43:37] it's all about it's about boundaries
[43:39] it's about if somebody does that to you
[43:40] you don't come right back with something
[43:42] against them
[43:43] uh uh don't don't try to over top don't
[43:46] don't try to cut them down and tear them
[43:48] down and uh don't respond in kind and
[43:51] and or definitely don't escalate it or
[43:53] but he's also saying don't it's not run
[43:55] away
[43:57] there's control that's involved jesus is
[43:59] teaching not to escalate conflict
[44:01] allowing it to grow where there's
[44:02] bitterness there's resentment there's
[44:04] further contention
[44:06] but he's telling it we ought to resist
[44:07] evil the right way this is that you
[44:09] resist not evil
[44:11] it means
[44:13] not to as paul said it
[44:16] re recompense evil for evil
[44:20] we ought to oppose evil
[44:22] by every righteous mean in our it means
[44:24] within our power and not by evil
[44:26] right we're to oppose evil we're to
[44:29] oppose the lie we're to stand against
[44:31] anything that's against the word of god
[44:32] but not by evil
[44:34] not well you know it's the truth so i
[44:36] don't mind telling a lie on somebody
[44:38] who's against the truth
[44:43] but jesus is teaching us if i can put it
[44:45] this way
[44:48] he's teaching us how that we do not
[44:49] become the victim
[44:53] it might read like wow man he's just
[44:55] really telling me that whenever i get
[44:56] beat up i just need to keep a knuckling
[44:58] down and putting up with it
[45:01] but he's he's touching on a principle
[45:03] and i want to just i'm going to close
[45:05] here in just a few minutes
[45:07] he's teaching
[45:09] a response to where you kind of free
[45:11] yourself
[45:12] of being the victim
[45:14] where i i'm not going to be bound by
[45:16] this offense
[45:17] i'm not gonna let this eat at me
[45:19] i'm not gonna let this define me
[45:22] i'm not gonna let this put me in a box
[45:23] i'm not gonna let it uh kind of
[45:25] be a shadow or a scar or a limit to me
[45:28] this isn't gonna be a barrier i'm not
[45:30] gonna let this bind me up but i'm going
[45:32] to i'm going to approach this the right
[45:34] way i'm going to respond the right way
[45:35] try address the conduct for what it is
[45:37] and then i'm able to put it in the light
[45:39] that it ought to be put in so that i'm
[45:41] not necessarily the victim of this
[45:43] person's offense to where they continue
[45:44] to have power over me
[45:47] i want to find a very delicate way to
[45:49] express this because it's something that
[45:50] i recognize personally for myself
[45:53] they have they have what is called
[45:55] trauma responses
[45:57] and there's way that people can begin to
[45:59] act within their life and they find out
[46:02] later on i'm that way not because that's
[46:04] who i am or that's my personality but
[46:06] that's the consequence of some trauma
[46:10] and so they they some people just always
[46:12] agree with everything anything aren't
[46:13] they just agreeable they're really easy
[46:15] going they're laid back no
[46:17] they're scarred to death
[46:19] i mean they're that way because they
[46:21] don't want conflict they're that way
[46:22] because they had some abuse or some
[46:24] circumstance or some loss and there's
[46:27] there's a trauma response that is
[46:28] dictating even their meekness and their
[46:30] sweetness and their agreeability there's
[46:32] sometimes a trauma response that's
[46:34] causing people to lash out and get angry
[46:36] and be upset it's not because they're
[46:37] harsh or they're brutal it's a response
[46:39] it's their trauma response and that kind
[46:42] of trauma response that dictates
[46:44] behavior that's a barrier
[46:46] that when someone's afraid to say well i
[46:48] would really like this or they want to
[46:50] say no and they have but they have to
[46:51] say yes and they're all doing as a
[46:53] trauma response that's a barrier to
[46:54] somebody's peace that's a barrier to
[46:56] somebody walking in the liberty of jesus
[46:58] christ and jesus if i could put it and
[47:00] i'm not trying to just be self-serving
[47:02] or try to shoehorn some idea into this i
[47:04] want you to think i'm using terminology
[47:06] that you might get lost in but make it
[47:08] very personal there's a way that in this
[47:10] moment of getting hit we just now engage
[47:12] in some sort of trauma response
[47:14] i'm going to fight back
[47:16] or there's going to be flight i'm going
[47:17] to run or i'm going to freeze some sort
[47:19] of trauma response but jesus is actually
[47:22] saying no i want you to respond to the
[47:23] trauma
[47:25] where we're not where we can either live
[47:27] we can either have a trauma response or
[47:29] we can respond someone our response to
[47:31] the trauma which is insane wait a minute
[47:33] there's a boundary that you just crossed
[47:36] that that's that's an offense you don't
[47:38] do that and you're looking at more from
[47:40] a point of a healthy pride a healthy
[47:42] confidence that there's virtues that god
[47:44] wants you to protect there's things that
[47:46] you want not to take away from me
[47:47] there's a way that you ought not to
[47:48] treat a son or daughter of god and so
[47:50] there's a way that in the moment that
[47:51] you're responding to the trauma but then
[47:54] there's also a way that you can be
[47:55] proactive about it
[47:58] we cannot allow the offense to govern
[47:59] our responses
[48:01] where the offense causes us to freeze up
[48:03] or to fight or to to run
[48:06] but we need to respond in a manner that
[48:08] preserves preserves our testimony our
[48:10] integrities brother branham said if the
[48:12] people see christ in you there's a way
[48:14] that you respond
[48:15] that preserves your testimony that that
[48:18] elicits uh the character of jesus christ
[48:22] and then it also challenges the offender
[48:24] because he said brother what did you do
[48:25] that for
[48:28] there's a way that you respond that
[48:29] christ
[48:30] christ stands up in your defense the
[48:32] character of christ is what comes you're
[48:34] not going to be the victim but christ is
[48:35] going to stand up in your defense and so
[48:37] there's something you're doing for
[48:38] yourself that preserves your integrity
[48:40] and in doing so it's something that asks
[48:41] the question of the person who did it
[48:43] would you do that for
[48:47] it's setting limits
[48:50] he didn't say if a man strike you on the
[48:52] face run away from as fast as you can
[48:54] because then the one that is a the one
[48:56] that is done is like ha ha see the
[48:57] coward is running
[48:59] he's not saying fight back fight back
[49:04] and let him have it because then he's
[49:05] like that's exactly what they want
[49:10] but he's saying and he's not saying
[49:12] coward there you know shriek back in
[49:14] fear before him
[49:18] but he's telling you to have a
[49:19] thoughtful response i believe brother
[49:20] branham is saying that
[49:22] brother why did you do that
[49:24] that's a thoughtful response
[49:27] it's a thoughtful response that begins
[49:28] to get to the heart of the act
[49:30] why did you do that because that wasn't
[49:32] right
[49:33] that's that's that's conduct that's not
[49:35] becoming of a christian
[49:37] that's not that's not that's no way to
[49:39] talk to somebody that that's no way to
[49:41] treat somebody
[49:42] that that that that is not right to do
[49:45] that and so there's a way that you
[49:46] respond that kind of exposes the error
[49:49] and exposes the offense and you don't
[49:52] have to fight back
[49:53] you don't have to get nasty in return
[49:55] but you don't have to run and you don't
[49:56] have to sign up for another beating you
[49:57] have a way of saying wait a minute hold
[49:59] on that's not appropriate i won't put up
[50:01] with it
[50:01] you have no right to treat me that way
[50:04] and it puts the offender on notice
[50:08] you'll find that the people that jesus
[50:10] is talking to
[50:12] he's talking to people who endure shame
[50:14] he's talking about the experiencing
[50:15] shame it's all being backhanded a slap
[50:18] to the face
[50:19] it's a shaming it's a trespass it's
[50:21] something that's hurtful
[50:23] and he's talking to the people not who
[50:24] are in the position of power but the
[50:26] people who are in the position to be
[50:27] abused
[50:28] right
[50:30] and and he's telling them how they ought
[50:32] to respond
[50:34] and i'm going to read this
[50:36] and it was uh
[50:38] it was written by a gentleman named
[50:39] walter wink
[50:40] leave his name that was his name
[50:42] and i'm just now forgetting the book it
[50:44] was in and i'm just going to read it
[50:45] because i love the way that he said it
[50:47] and
[50:48] i i believe that it's it's truthful
[50:52] and and i hope that you can listen
[50:53] because i'm going to close on this
[50:55] and when i've read this the i invite the
[50:57] musicians to come
[50:59] he asked the question why then does
[51:01] jesus counsel these already humiliated
[51:04] people to turn the other cheek
[51:06] listening we're closing we're going to
[51:08] stop here in just a moment
[51:09] please pay close attention to this
[51:11] because this action robs the oppressor
[51:14] of the power to humiliate
[51:18] the person who turns the other cheek is
[51:20] saying in effect try again
[51:22] your first blow failed to achieve its
[51:24] intended effect
[51:26] i deny you the power to humiliate me
[51:29] i'm a human being just like you your
[51:31] status does not alter that fact you
[51:33] cannot demean me
[51:36] there's a way that you conduct yourself
[51:38] in response to where you're saying look
[51:40] you do not have power over me to rob me
[51:43] of my position in christ you don't have
[51:46] pro power only to subjugate me to your
[51:48] passions to your temper
[51:50] to your legalism to whatever your
[51:51] attitude is you do not have power over
[51:53] me your act failed to demean me it
[51:56] failed to humiliate me it failed to
[51:58] produce the desired response and i have
[52:00] not given you the satisfaction by
[52:02] responding to your disrespect with the
[52:04] blow of the fist to show that you are
[52:07] indeed greater than me and more powerful
[52:08] in me and i have to give a show of force
[52:11] to bring you down you respond in such a
[52:13] way that completely strips them
[52:16] whatever perceived power they thought
[52:18] they had over you because you just say
[52:20] brother why did you do that
[52:22] why would you do that what's your reason
[52:25] for engaging in that
[52:28] to turn the other cheek is to stand up
[52:29] for yourself while being true to
[52:30] yourself
[52:32] not trying to defend yourself outside of
[52:34] yourself
[52:35] but as a real christian
[52:38] he says turn
[52:39] turn the other cheek
[52:42] and in doing so it's as if to say try
[52:45] again
[52:47] what you what you were trying to
[52:49] accomplish you failed in doing it and
[52:51] i'm not going to run
[52:53] and i'm not going to let you do it again
[52:55] i'm going to say what did you do that
[52:57] for because that wasn't right
[52:59] does it make sense to you
[53:00] [Music]
[53:06] may god help us to give a thoughtful
[53:08] response
[53:09] [Music]
[53:13] for the
[53:14] for the sanctification of our spirits
[53:16] the protection of our hearts
[53:20] for the courage of our children
[53:22] be able to say no
[53:25] that's enough
[53:27] and to resist the notions that the world
[53:30] so easily wants to put on us is just
[53:32] play just play the victim
[53:35] you're not a victim
[53:36] thanks
[53:38] you're not victims
[53:39] no matter what it is you've endured and
[53:40] what you've gone through and you may
[53:42] have been the victim of abuse but that
[53:43] is not who you are that is not who you
[53:46] remain to be but through jesus christ
[53:48] you are risen
[53:50] to a place of life and health and so i
[53:52] encourage you to begin to examine hear
[53:55] the voice of god that's trying to call
[53:56] you out into greater things
[53:58] and have them wash you of these things
[54:00] that hold us back let's stand to our
[54:02] feet
[54:04] [Music]
[54:12] thank you for listening tonight
[54:15] thank you for giving me
[54:17] this liberty to finish kind of close
[54:19] that loop on setting limits
[54:21] i know i mentioned on sunday that we
[54:23] want to
[54:24] kind of as a road map go from setting
[54:26] limits to recognizing limits
[54:28] and then on
[54:30] addressing barriers and that's not
[54:32] necessarily going to be the strict
[54:34] the strict road map
[54:36] of the subjects or kind of the future
[54:39] future steps that we want to take
[54:40] there's some principles i still want to
[54:42] express
[54:42] [Music]
[54:44] and on sunday and i mention this so you
[54:46] could be praying
[54:49] on sunday i would like to
[54:51] expound upon
[54:53] the idea
[54:55] of
[54:56] imposing things and doing things and
[54:58] asking things or uh
[55:00] enforcing things
[55:02] through the idea of authority
[55:05] as opposed to love
[55:05] [Music]
[55:07] and how that there's things that god
[55:09] wants us to do but it's again it comes
[55:11] back to the idea god is it he's a
[55:12] gentleman he's knocking he's looking for
[55:15] permission and if that's the example he
[55:17] set for us
[55:18] and we ought to likewise do the same
[55:20] thing and be certain that if we're
[55:22] setting a boundary or overcoming a
[55:24] barrier
[55:26] the love of god is the impetus it's the
[55:28] inspiration and not whether we're right
[55:32] it's the truth how many times did
[55:34] somebody hurt you and they said well
[55:35] it's the truth anyhow
[55:37] wow brother that really hurt me when you
[55:39] mentioned my name over the pulpit and
[55:40] said this that and the other about me
[55:41] well was it a lie was it true well yeah
[55:43] i mean it's true but that hurt well then
[55:45] truth hurts doesn't it right you say
[55:48] well that's just somebody who had the
[55:50] opportunity right
[55:52] they have the authority right it's their
[55:53] pulpit they can say whatever they want
[55:55] or they're the husband it's their house
[55:56] or you know
[55:58] there's this i take i'm taking advantage
[56:00] and we ought to realize no no no no
[56:02] that's not what christians do
[56:04] we can accomplish
[56:06] by the word of god everything that he
[56:08] wants us to do so that we don't have to
[56:09] resort to power privilege opportunity or
[56:11] force to do it
[56:13] so be in prayer please let's pray
[56:16] gracious heavenly father as we are
[56:17] dismissed here shortly
[56:20] we want to take a moment now to turn
[56:21] back to you and to say thank you for the
[56:24] word
[56:26] and
[56:26] i ask as the pastor who's expressing
[56:29] these principles
[56:31] i ask that you would be
[56:33] on the receiving end and i know that you
[56:35] have been lord
[56:36] but to further be on the contemplating
[56:39] end
[56:40] and the rumination end the the part now
[56:43] where the believer begins to ponder
[56:44] these things
[56:45] and examine their own lives and see
[56:47] where these things fit
[56:50] and lord i know there might be some
[56:51] tendency maybe just to kind of get our
[56:54] ear up for some of the terminology say
[56:56] oh i want to explore that i want to
[56:57] research that i want to look into this
[57:00] if you would so lead one to look further
[57:02] into the psychology of this or the
[57:05] kind of the human condition and the
[57:07] human behavior
[57:08] that's being talked about in some of
[57:10] these things if you would lead to do
[57:11] that lord i i don't object but my desire
[57:14] would be that in hearing these things it
[57:16] would enlighten us to the fact that you
[57:19] god
[57:20] are perfectly mindful
[57:24] of
[57:24] how
[57:26] how you what you have called us to be
[57:30] and how
[57:31] acts in circumstances and life
[57:35] has worked against us
[57:38] to put us in the current state that
[57:39] we're in
[57:41] and that your word is being very
[57:43] discerning so that we could it can
[57:45] uncover something and we say yes lord
[57:47] you do understand yes lord this word is
[57:49] enough yes the message of the hour is is
[57:52] guiding me and speaking to my
[57:54] insecurities and washing me of my vanity
[57:57] and healing me of my hurts and to
[58:00] and to lean into the spiritual
[58:01] application and to yield to the word of
[58:04] god and to take the yoke of christ upon
[58:06] us and not get caught up in the
[58:10] psychology of and get caught up in the
[58:11] buzzwords of it but just
[58:13] enough lord to get our attention but
[58:15] then point us very quickly to the word
[58:17] of god that's my desire
[58:19] and what i would want tonight lord is
[58:21] that in this very moment right now as i
[58:23] pray that there would be divine healing
[58:25] that would take place
[58:29] that whether it be husbands or wives or
[58:31] children or elders and regardless of the
[58:34] people that hear this
[58:36] may there be a healing lord
[58:39] and a and a raising up if you have the
[58:42] bad kind of pride you fall but if you
[58:44] don't have the right kind of pride
[58:46] you'll never get back up lord may we now
[58:48] have courage to rise and to stand
[58:50] gallantly upon our feet and say i will
[58:53] not play the victim anymore
[58:55] and i will not play the aggressor
[58:57] anymore i won't play the the one that's
[58:59] running away i won't play the one that's
[59:01] freezing i won't play the one that's
[59:02] fighting but i'll play the one that
[59:04] stands and turns the other cheek and
[59:07] gives notice to the devil i'm not your
[59:10] victim that gives notice to the
[59:12] circumstances i'm not your slave that
[59:14] gives notice to the hurt i am not bound
[59:17] by you any longer but i am a son or
[59:20] daughter of god who can stand on his own
[59:23] two feet in jesus christ and can respond
[59:26] appropriately
[59:28] to the trauma
[59:31] lord help us to recognize in our own
[59:33] lives things that are
[59:34] [Music]
[59:36] our trauma responses as it were we're
[59:39] that way more because of our hurts than
[59:41] it is because of our healings
[59:44] we're more that way because of hardness
[59:46] than it is humility
[59:48] and help us lord to experience your
[59:49] healing
[59:51] commit the people to you today right now
[59:54] in this moment heal them
[59:56] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[59:58] pray
[59:58] amen
[1:00:00] [Music]
