[0:00] romans chapter 2 i feel very pressed
[0:03] just to
[0:04] jump right into the word and um have a
[0:06] lot
[0:07] um before me and i need you so i need
[0:10] your help definitely need your help
[0:11] today
[0:12] romans chapter 2 verse 12.
[0:16] for as many as have sinned without law
[0:18] shall perish
[0:19] without law and as many have sinned in
[0:21] the law shall be judged
[0:23] by the law and then this phrase is
[0:25] parenthetical it's kind of inserted in
[0:27] here to
[0:28] clarify and give further understanding
[0:31] to
[0:32] how the gentiles and jews are being
[0:34] brought in
[0:35] to the glory of god for not the hearers
[0:37] of the law are just before god which
[0:39] israel
[0:40] they were the ones that heard the law
[0:42] but the doers of the law
[0:44] shall be justified for when the gentiles
[0:47] which have not the law the law was not
[0:49] sent to them do by nature the things
[0:52] contained in the law
[0:53] these having not the law are a law unto
[0:56] themselves
[0:57] which show the work of the law written
[1:00] in their hearts
[1:01] their conscience also bearing witness
[1:04] and their thoughts in the meanwhile
[1:06] accusing or else excusing one another in
[1:08] the day when god shall judge the secrets
[1:11] of men by
[1:12] jesus christ according to my gospel and
[1:15] that
[1:15] kind of amplifies or bookends the
[1:18] statement for as many have sinned
[1:19] without the law
[1:20] shall perish and as many have sinned in
[1:22] the law shall be judged
[1:24] in the day when god shall judge by the
[1:27] secrets of men by jesus christ
[1:29] according to my gospel if you have a
[1:32] need today before we
[1:33] approach the lord in prayer would you
[1:35] just make it known if lifting your hands
[1:38] to him do so in faith believing
[1:40] that he can speak particularly to your
[1:41] need today i want you to take it
[1:44] personal today
[1:45] in a good way god wants to speak to you
[1:47] that god's mindful of your situation
[1:50] uh and can bring a great healing and
[1:51] deliverance wherever that you need it so
[1:53] just be
[1:54] very individualistic today to believe
[1:56] god i know you have something for me
[1:58] our gracious heavenly fathers we stand
[2:00] in your divine presence
[2:01] we have an assurance that transcends
[2:05] written paper and signed contracts and
[2:07] verbal promises
[2:08] we have something that so resonates deep
[2:11] within our bo
[2:12] our souls lord that it it becomes a
[2:14] fabric
[2:16] in every part of our lives and lord i
[2:18] pray today that as we have
[2:19] gathered together and so many are here
[2:21] to
[2:23] to be in fellowship and to hear the word
[2:25] of god i ask that you would come
[2:28] honoring their faith meeting their
[2:30] expectations
[2:31] exceeding their expectations and doing
[2:34] things which we do not even know
[2:36] what to utter and what to ask for but
[2:38] may the spirit just begin to groan
[2:40] within us and pull
[2:41] and and even lord if it need to be a
[2:44] painful desire and an
[2:45] agonizing that our faith grabs a hold of
[2:49] and and just is so perseverant lord to
[2:53] hear from you
[2:54] may it be so may we just have this
[2:57] doggedness about us today where
[2:59] just as the world is unrelenting and
[3:01] just as the
[3:02] sin and politics and all the things of
[3:05] this world do not let up and it's just
[3:07] so aggressive and uh and assertive lord
[3:11] may we be
[3:12] bold today father just to apprehend to
[3:15] grasp to enter in
[3:18] or to even think that jesus said that
[3:20] the kingdom of
[3:21] heaven suffereth violence and the
[3:23] violent take it by force
[3:25] lord i believe that we must be in some
[3:28] measure in some way
[3:30] violent to seize upon to lay a hold to
[3:33] desire and to seek after and may we have
[3:36] that kind of disposition today lord as
[3:38] we approach this word
[3:39] that we have not gathered traditionally
[3:41] we have not come just to appease
[3:43] a carnal conscience but lord we've come
[3:46] drawn by your spirit
[3:48] with a longing and a desire to hear from
[3:50] you and i pray you'd speak
[3:52] grant it now father we pray in the name
[3:54] of the lord jesus christ
[3:55] amen you may be seated
[4:02] we're continuing on the subject of pure
[4:04] joy and my title today or subtitle
[4:07] is a clean conscience and this will be
[4:11] um i see since we're kind of starting
[4:13] maybe a new focus
[4:15] this service might just be a matter of
[4:16] trying to get a lot of building
[4:17] materials out there and hopefully
[4:19] laying a bit of a foundation so there
[4:21] might just be a lot of things
[4:23] that we're plugging in here just to kind
[4:26] of kick start the burden and kind of put
[4:28] us in the
[4:29] in the channel of the subject of a clean
[4:32] conscience
[4:33] the pure joy it is the lord's joy that
[4:37] he gives
[4:37] us i was even pondering the statement of
[4:39] nehemiah how that
[4:41] and studying in the book of nehemiah and
[4:43] that's kind of what i've been looking at
[4:45] but i can't seem to quite get there
[4:46] how it says that the joy of the lord is
[4:49] your strength
[4:50] and it struck me a little bit
[4:51] differently to think the lord's joy
[4:54] is a strength to us what pleases him
[4:56] what what satisfies him what makes him
[4:58] happy
[4:59] but the so our pure joy is the lord's
[5:02] joy that he gives to us
[5:04] it's something that's very personal and
[5:05] it's a joy that we ought to guard
[5:07] it's a joy that we ought to cherish it's
[5:09] a joy that we should seek
[5:11] and we looking at the statement where
[5:13] brother branham is talking about god's
[5:15] elect of love and how he proved his love
[5:17] for us and
[5:18] love is based upon election and he makes
[5:20] this statement how shall i prove my love
[5:22] to him
[5:23] by believing what he said we can do that
[5:25] and by conducting myself with joy
[5:28] admits the trials that he and his wisdom
[5:30] allows to come to pass and we realize
[5:32] there's the rub there's the hard part we
[5:35] can believe we believe what he says even
[5:37] by faith that he's given us
[5:39] so we believe what he says but
[5:41] conducting ourselves above temptation
[5:43] conducting ourselves above trial
[5:45] conducting ourselves on a different
[5:47] level spiritually and emotionally than
[5:49] all the circumstances and symptoms
[5:51] around us
[5:52] that's that's the challenge and the
[5:54] proof of our love the proof of his love
[5:56] is an election
[5:57] that he said he loved us and he sent his
[5:59] son to die for us now there is a
[6:01] proof or reciprocation of our love it's
[6:04] faith in his word
[6:05] and then conduct the manner in which we
[6:08] conduct ourselves and it must be with
[6:09] joy
[6:10] in the middle of all trials because when
[6:12] he says the trials that he and his
[6:14] wisdom allows to come to pass
[6:15] is not a qualifier of trials but it's
[6:18] letting us know that any trial
[6:20] he has in his wisdom allowed to come to
[6:21] pass and really that's the beginning of
[6:24] joy then
[6:25] if you can have confidence that he has
[6:26] allowed it in his wisdom
[6:28] and so as brother branham is making
[6:31] these
[6:31] making this point in this particular
[6:33] place in the church age book
[6:34] the key to a joyful disposition is
[6:37] connected with
[6:38] god's elective love and this is a
[6:40] revelation that we ought to desire
[6:42] to continually unfold a revelation of
[6:44] his love let's not look at it as just an
[6:46] instance where we feel his love our
[6:49] moment when he tells us he loves us but
[6:50] it's a revelation that can continually
[6:52] unfold
[6:53] and get more rich and more strong unto
[6:55] us
[6:56] in first john chapter 4 verses 18 and 19
[6:59] it says there is no fear in love
[7:01] but perfect love casteth out fear
[7:04] now instead of approaching this as
[7:07] a an evidence that if you have fear you
[7:10] don't have perfect love
[7:11] look at it as the perfect love that you
[7:13] have received from him and the perfect
[7:15] love you have by the baptist the holy
[7:16] ghost
[7:17] is meant to conquer fear it's meant to
[7:20] cast it out perfect love casteth out
[7:22] fear so
[7:23] you're availing yourself to the
[7:24] characteristics and qualities
[7:26] of perfect love because fear hath
[7:28] torment so why does perfect love cast
[7:30] out fear
[7:31] why is it a set against fear because
[7:33] fear brings torment
[7:35] and how can we enjoy relationship how
[7:37] can we joy existence
[7:39] if there's fear he that feareth is not
[7:41] made perfect in love in other words the
[7:43] perfect
[7:44] love has not perfected you has not
[7:46] brought you its wholeness and its
[7:48] completeness as it is designed to
[7:49] and says we love him because he first
[7:52] loved us
[7:53] and so our love is birth for him as
[7:56] birth from
[7:57] our understanding that he first loved us
[8:00] so if our the intensity of our love
[8:04] for him is going to be directly
[8:06] connected to the revelation
[8:08] of the intensity of the love that he has
[8:10] for us
[8:12] okay and maybe i'll just use arbitrary
[8:14] numbers it's not to say that god has a
[8:15] scale
[8:16] and he says i love you to a seven but if
[8:18] we have the understanding that god
[8:20] that god loves us and it's to the it's
[8:21] to the three
[8:23] well then we're we're not gonna be able
[8:24] to love them back at a 5.
[8:27] you're not going to be able to say well
[8:28] god i love you more we can do that in
[8:29] our games right in our human
[8:31] relationship and be hard on ourselves we
[8:32] can ask god
[8:33] show me how much you love me show me how
[8:37] much you care lord i believe you do but
[8:38] i want to understand it better i want to
[8:40] know it better
[8:41] and to be more confident in his love can
[8:43] actually take the power away from
[8:45] weaknesses and complexes
[8:47] and inefficiencies because you realize
[8:48] he loves me despite it
[8:50] we're not constantly trying to gain his
[8:52] approval and gain his affection
[8:54] and and gain his seal like say oh no i
[8:57] like you you're good enough there's a
[8:58] way that the gospel can be preached for
[9:00] trying to merit and earn the baptism of
[9:02] the holy ghost and it completely changes
[9:04] the whole nature of god's relationship
[9:06] with you
[9:08] and so perfect love is designed to
[9:10] ultimately overthrow fear
[9:13] that its nature is to ultimately
[9:15] overthrow fear otherwise we would not be
[9:17] able to rest
[9:19] otherwise we would not be able to trust
[9:22] as we ministered a couple services on
[9:24] victory ahead is victory now
[9:27] the thought was and this is i really
[9:29] hate to try to summarize it because
[9:32] there's just so much that was
[9:35] behind the statement victory had his
[9:37] victory now
[9:39] but it was the idea of anchoring our
[9:41] faith in something beyond the temporal
[9:44] that we're anchored in something that is
[9:46] eternal so we're not so much
[9:48] rooted in the things that are around us
[9:49] but we're rooted in something beyond us
[9:52] and this statement in colossians
[9:54] colossians chapter 1 verse 5
[9:56] is just so thrilling to me for the hope
[9:58] which is laid up for you in heaven
[10:00] whereof you have heard before in the
[10:02] word of truth
[10:04] of the truth of the gospel for the hope
[10:06] which is laid up for you in heaven there
[10:08] is a hope which is laid up for us in
[10:09] heaven
[10:10] where have you heard before in the word
[10:12] of the truth of the gospel
[10:15] and so your confident hope your
[10:17] expectation your joyful disposition
[10:19] is born from experiencing what heaven
[10:22] holds for you
[10:23] because it says it's a hope which is
[10:24] laid up for you in heaven but you've
[10:26] heard it
[10:27] you've experienced it to some degree
[10:29] you've you've fellowshipped with it it's
[10:30] been revealed to you
[10:32] so there is a hope that um that that
[10:34] your ex there's a hope that we have and
[10:36] a joyful anticipation of the future
[10:38] not because we've merely been told it
[10:40] exists but we're experiencing it
[10:43] you're seated in heavenly places in
[10:44] christ jesus and so as the word as it
[10:47] says that you've heard before in the
[10:49] word of the truth of the gospel
[10:51] the word of truth is never just
[10:52] statistics the word of truth is never
[10:55] data
[10:56] alone it's never just information but it
[10:58] is something that's living it is
[11:00] something that's eternal
[11:01] it's something that you're a part of and
[11:03] that is going to form the basis of your
[11:05] joy
[11:06] that i'm connected to something eternal
[11:09] now these are just some uh kind of
[11:13] review some things that are just to
[11:14] review and first john chapter 3 verses
[11:17] 20 and 21
[11:18] i want to just share this before we
[11:20] launch into
[11:22] our subject of um
[11:28] a pure conscience it says in first john
[11:31] chapter 3 verses 20 to 21 for if our
[11:33] heart condemn us
[11:34] god is greater than our heart so don't
[11:37] be condemned because you have a
[11:38] condemned heart
[11:40] it's amazing how our feelings can pile
[11:42] on where
[11:43] you know we we we feel like we've
[11:45] disappointed the lord and
[11:46] we can feel and we feel bad for
[11:48] disappointing him and
[11:50] we were forgiven for the disappointment
[11:52] but now we need to be forgiven for
[11:54] feeling bad that we disappointed him and
[11:56] it just creates this
[11:57] unending cycle right so he's just trying
[11:59] to let's just snip it in the bud let's
[12:01] just get it over with if our heart
[12:02] condemns us god's greater than that
[12:04] and it's connected with his knowledge of
[12:06] all things
[12:08] so you may think you know more than he
[12:10] does
[12:12] but his knowledge of all things and even
[12:14] what he doesn't know
[12:15] ought to overthrow anything you know
[12:19] because he knows all things and and what
[12:21] he retains and what he knows and his
[12:23] foreknowledge and his
[12:25] election based upon that and his
[12:26] predestination working together for that
[12:29] that's what we're grounded in that's
[12:30] what we're rooted in if our heart
[12:32] condemns us it means
[12:33] if our heart finds fault if it has if
[12:35] it's blaming us
[12:36] if it's accusing us look to him who's
[12:39] greater than your heart
[12:40] and knows more than your heart does
[12:43] beloved if our heart condemn us
[12:44] not then we have confidence towards god
[12:48] he's not saying that if you have a
[12:51] condemned heart you don't have
[12:52] confidence
[12:53] he's saying that if we our confidence in
[12:56] god
[12:57] ought to take our hearts that are
[13:00] condemned and free us from condemnation
[13:03] if our hearts condemn us then that if
[13:06] our hearts condemn us not
[13:07] then that's what confidence in god ought
[13:09] to produce
[13:10] if we fear don't oh i don't have perfect
[13:12] love because i'm fearful no
[13:13] perfect love will cast out that so we
[13:16] believe and look to
[13:17] perfect love will cast out this fear if
[13:19] my heart's condemned then we say my conf
[13:21] i trust god i believe in god then my
[13:24] confidence in god will manifest itself
[13:26] in uncondemning my heart overthrow and
[13:29] condemnation
[13:30] i know that he has a perfect love for me
[13:32] well maybe i just need to ask the
[13:33] question do you believe god loves you
[13:36] do you believe that his love is
[13:37] imperfect
[13:40] then if he loves you with an imperfect
[13:42] love if we could settle that that he
[13:44] loves you perfectly
[13:46] then that perfect love cast out fear
[13:49] it's it's not your human ability to love
[13:51] perfectly that's going to cast out fear
[13:53] if you say well perfect love cast out
[13:55] fear therefore i'm
[13:56] i don't have perfect love and that's why
[13:58] i'm fearful no it's
[13:59] his perfect love that cast out fear it's
[14:03] your confidence in god which is going to
[14:05] overthrow a condemned heart so we need
[14:07] to start thinking about it backwards
[14:08] instead of these being a litmus test
[14:10] about whether or not you love god and
[14:12] whether or not you believe god and
[14:13] whether or not he's
[14:14] you're really elect you ought to look at
[14:16] it as no these are my rights
[14:18] as the elect this is my right as one
[14:21] that believes god
[14:22] this is my right as one that has
[14:24] confidence in god this is my
[14:26] ultimate destiny as one who is the
[14:28] recipient
[14:29] of a god who loves me perfectly a
[14:32] beneficiary
[14:32] of a god who loves perfectly so you
[14:34] completely change the whole approach
[14:38] and so this is the condemning heart this
[14:41] is kind of where i'm starting to enter
[14:42] into this thought of a clean conscience
[14:46] this a condemned heart a heart holds
[14:48] some sort of knowledge
[14:49] or consciousness of something that
[14:52] is to our detriment or that is used to
[14:55] overthrow our confidence
[14:57] so it's something that plagues us or
[14:58] something that lowers us
[15:00] causing us to droop or or to hang down
[15:03] it's a source
[15:04] of anxiety or apprehension so there's a
[15:06] lot of emotions
[15:07] that are birthed by a condemned heart
[15:12] and so when we were looking at the
[15:14] subject of being numb
[15:17] it was about the ability or the
[15:20] inability to feel emotions and to become
[15:23] emotionalist and
[15:24] very stayed and not just a soberness or
[15:27] somberness but actually a numbness
[15:31] to where you're stoic and unmoved and we
[15:34] were identifying how that god will use
[15:36] our emotions to get our
[15:39] and so i i kind of wanted to pick up on
[15:41] that to focus to
[15:43] better understand what this pure joy is
[15:46] and and just by recalling some of those
[15:48] things how that pure joy is inaccessible
[15:51] if you have don't have the ability to
[15:52] experience emotions
[15:54] if we cannot and pure joy is not
[15:57] accessible to us
[15:58] if we're not um without first addressing
[16:01] uncomfortable feelings feelings of
[16:04] discomfort and feelings that may not
[16:05] make us feel good and what we've been
[16:08] looking at is this thought of inversion
[16:10] not so much well how can i get pure joy
[16:12] or what is pure joy
[16:14] but what keeps us from it
[16:17] and so a clear conscience
[16:21] this is necessary to have and it is
[16:24] necessary
[16:26] to fully experience it's necessary to
[16:27] have it's necessary to have a clean
[16:29] conscience
[16:30] uh in order to have pure joy it's
[16:33] necessary to have a clean conscience in
[16:35] order to fully experience
[16:36] the lord's joy and there's a statement
[16:39] that i've been reading and pondering
[16:40] over the last
[16:41] month or so in the church age book
[16:45] and i believe it's around the 40th
[16:46] paragraph or so i forgot to
[16:48] or page 41 in there it says our spirit
[16:51] is clean
[16:53] it is fresh it is real
[16:56] that nice you just claim it
[16:59] our spirit is clean it is fresh it is
[17:03] real
[17:04] it is sober and serious but nonetheless
[17:07] full of the joy of the lord this is a
[17:10] this is a state of being that we ought
[17:12] to decide
[17:13] desire to live and fully within our
[17:15] spirit is clean our spirit is fresh our
[17:17] spirit is real our spirit is sober and
[17:18] serious
[17:19] but nonetheless it is full of the joy of
[17:21] the lord the christian ought to be just
[17:23] as exuberant and full of his pleasure in
[17:26] the lord
[17:27] as the world is when it savors and
[17:30] delights in its pleasures
[17:33] in other words church services should be
[17:34] far more
[17:36] joyful and uplifting than a trump rally
[17:40] right joy is the flag flowing high i
[17:42] mean that
[17:43] that ought to be how our our lives are
[17:45] conducted that it's
[17:46] it's more than these athletic
[17:48] competitions it's more than the concerts
[17:50] it's more than the rallies and the
[17:51] gatherings
[17:52] and the protests and the marches and and
[17:55] the things the demonstrations
[17:56] the christian ought to be just as
[17:59] exuberant and full of his pleasure in
[18:01] the lord
[18:02] as the world is when it savors and
[18:04] delights in its pleasures
[18:06] now i i'm going to say this now and just
[18:08] realizing maybe this channel is opening
[18:10] up
[18:10] uh to be very direct in this way because
[18:13] i'm wanting to come
[18:14] to a thought towards the very end of
[18:16] this
[18:17] about where the world's current state is
[18:19] and its emotions and its feelings and
[18:21] its
[18:22] awareness and as the christians
[18:25] and it just hits me so heavily now the
[18:27] christian ought to be just as exuberant
[18:28] and full of his pleasure in the lord
[18:31] as the world is in it when it savors and
[18:33] delights in its pleasures
[18:35] and the world is always going to be
[18:37] exuberant and delight and rejoice in and
[18:39] celebrate and be very excited
[18:41] about its pleasures but the detriment of
[18:44] the world has been the christian
[18:45] losing its joy in the things of the lord
[18:49] and what it's created is a an arena in
[18:51] which
[18:52] the the the religious are competing with
[18:55] the ungodly
[18:56] in fervency and intensity and who can be
[19:00] pro-this and anti-vat
[19:02] and it's completely left the arena of
[19:04] what the gospel is for
[19:06] and so the christian ought to be
[19:07] exuberant and full of his pleasure in
[19:09] the lord
[19:10] both christians and the world are human
[19:14] both have emotions the difference
[19:17] is the christians hearts and emotions
[19:20] are purely on the lord
[19:21] of glory and his love our ambitions
[19:25] our zeal our enthusiasm is purely on the
[19:28] lord of glory and his love
[19:31] this is a this is a check to us this is
[19:33] a balance this is something we begin to
[19:35] examine
[19:35] what am i all about what am i excited
[19:37] about what am i pursuing what am i for
[19:39] what what's motivating me what's uh
[19:42] exciting me
[19:43] is are my is my heart and my emotions
[19:45] purely on the lord of glory and his love
[19:48] or something else because it says both
[19:50] christians and the world have
[19:52] emotions and he says that the christians
[19:54] hearts are stayed upon something and
[19:56] focused on something
[19:57] the lord and his love while the world
[19:59] satisfies the flesh
[20:03] joe's just goes to show what a as you
[20:05] ponder that
[20:06] just what a razor's edge it can be
[20:08] before you tip over
[20:09] from the joy of the lord into something
[20:11] that satisfies the flesh
[20:12] it says the world satisfies the flesh
[20:16] so i want to look at this the term
[20:18] conscience
[20:21] conscience it's a noun conscience is a
[20:23] noun it's the faculty of knowing what is
[20:25] right
[20:27] it is the awareness of whether our
[20:28] conduct is in harmony with our
[20:30] conviction
[20:32] of what is right so it's an awareness of
[20:35] whether or not
[20:36] what we're doing comports with or agrees
[20:38] with what we think is right
[20:40] right that's what a conscience is a good
[20:42] way of defining conscience it's what our
[20:44] innermost thoughts
[20:45] something's very deep our thoughts our
[20:47] desires our intentions our feelings
[20:50] and so it's something very very deep
[20:52] within us
[20:53] a faculty of knowing what is right
[20:55] awareness of whether or not our conduct
[20:57] agrees with what we believe is right and
[20:59] so it speaks of our desires and intents
[21:02] and our feelings
[21:03] the latin is consensua which is
[21:05] knowledge within oneself
[21:07] the sense of right and wrong so it has
[21:09] like a moral sense to it the sense of
[21:11] right or wrong
[21:12] we could uh i'll just i'll read another
[21:16] definition a state of awareness or
[21:18] sense that one's actions or intentions
[21:21] are either morally right or morally
[21:23] wrong
[21:24] this is what conscience is is this it's
[21:27] a state of awareness
[21:28] or you sense that what you do or what
[21:31] you intend
[21:32] is correct what i've done is right or
[21:35] what i've done is wrong my intent behind
[21:37] it you could do something
[21:39] and on the surface you know well hey
[21:41] this
[21:42] this this looks good but your conscience
[21:44] tells you your motive is wrong
[21:48] because it's looking at your intent well
[21:49] your reason for doing it that's what
[21:51] conscience is
[21:52] so conscious is your moral basis which
[21:54] guides your behavior
[21:57] you followed me one of you is all right
[22:02] i i i i know that you're i know that
[22:05] you're listening
[22:07] uh very intently and i i i trust it's a
[22:10] good thing because i can i can
[22:12] certainly sense that you're listening
[22:14] but what i don't want it to be
[22:15] is a scenario where it's just so hard to
[22:18] understand me that you've got to really
[22:19] really focus or you'll miss it and it
[22:20] won't be worth your time
[22:22] like i don't want that to be the reason
[22:23] why you're uh
[22:25] um so intent and listening and i
[22:28] remember brother barry coffey shared
[22:29] with me
[22:30] an analogy one time of what it was like
[22:31] to hear me preach and to this day
[22:34] i think he meant it as a compliment
[22:42] he did mean it as a compliment i just in
[22:44] that moment forgot what the analogy was
[22:46] but it's some kind of struggle between
[22:47] life and death
[22:49] that he saw in the in africa somewhere
[22:51] where like a
[22:52] python was wrestling with a with some
[22:56] other beast and it was a matter the
[22:57] first one to slip the first one to lose
[22:59] their attention was going to die and he
[23:01] said
[23:01] that's what it feels like to listen to
[23:03] you preach
[23:08] right okay thank you pastor
[23:14] so our conscience everybody relax now
[23:17] we're not in a
[23:18] death fight here boa constrictor versus
[23:21] you our conscience will stop
[23:24] actions stop us from acting wrong
[23:28] or acting on the wrong desires and our
[23:30] conscience with us don't do that that's
[23:32] the wrong desire that's the wrong motive
[23:34] or our conscience will actually motivate
[23:36] us to do right
[23:37] this this is what our conscience is it's
[23:39] a knowledge within someone
[23:41] within someone it's what is right it's
[23:43] awareness of whether or not what i'm
[23:44] doing is right and awareness that what
[23:46] i've done was for the wrong reasons
[23:48] that's what conscience is so our
[23:50] conscience causes us to feel guilt when
[23:52] we've done wrong
[23:53] our conscious causes us to feel happy
[23:55] when we've done good
[24:00] i'm just going to turn this i
[24:03] if if you don't agree with it if you
[24:04] don't understand i'm not going to force
[24:06] you to say amen and agree
[24:08] but i want this to i want you to kind of
[24:09] grab a hold to be conscious of this now
[24:12] that and our conscience is
[24:15] works this way that we've done something
[24:16] wrong it's our conscience that tells us
[24:18] that's not right
[24:20] and when we've done something good it's
[24:22] our conscience it makes us happy
[24:25] like hey that was the right thing to do
[24:26] i feel good about that
[24:29] and so in john chapter 8 verse 9 as we
[24:31] were looking at this here recently
[24:33] and how that it was in the subject of
[24:35] vietnam how that they brought this woman
[24:37] who had been caught in the act of
[24:38] adultery and somehow in all the
[24:41] religious fervor they forgot about the
[24:42] man
[24:43] and they bring this woman before christ
[24:45] we caught her in the very act of
[24:46] adultery in christ
[24:48] they kind of ignoring him at first and
[24:49] writes upon the ground and then he
[24:51] and he basically says you who are
[24:52] without sin cast the first stone
[24:55] and then and it says and they which
[24:56] heard it being convicted notice this
[24:58] phrase convicted by
[25:00] their own conscience went out one by one
[25:03] beginning at the eldest even under the
[25:04] least last and jesus was left alone and
[25:06] the woman standing in the midst
[25:08] so notice the effect or how a conscience
[25:11] works
[25:12] each one was convicted by their own
[25:14] conscience
[25:15] so everyone has their own conscience and
[25:18] what the conscience did here
[25:20] it actually convicted them and so it's
[25:24] an aspect since we all have our own
[25:25] conscience it's an aspect of our
[25:27] personality
[25:28] that is going to in on an individual
[25:30] level discern what is right or wrong
[25:32] so they were convicted by their own
[25:35] conscience it means their conscience
[25:37] gave them the sense that their actions
[25:39] were wrong
[25:41] their conscience pricked them and they
[25:43] made them to feel
[25:44] well this isn't right just as when peter
[25:47] preached he says and the men
[25:48] they were pricked in their heart they
[25:50] were pricked in their conscience their
[25:51] conscience began to feel like
[25:52] oh we've done something wrong what must
[25:54] we do so a conscience
[25:56] is the sense of that our acts our
[25:58] actions our motives and our intent
[26:00] are either right or they're wrong
[26:04] our conscience can even be this feeling
[26:06] that we have an obligation to act that's
[26:08] what our conscience is
[26:10] and let me say this now before we go
[26:13] further in this because in some on some
[26:14] level i believe the word is kind of just
[26:16] uh describing our human condition and
[26:19] exposing things about our nature
[26:21] but but let me say this very very clear
[26:23] and very definitively about our
[26:24] conscience
[26:25] our conscience must correctly be formed
[26:28] by divine revelation
[26:30] our this is this is where many of us are
[26:32] as believers and this is how we ought to
[26:33] be
[26:34] uh we have to be motivated and raised in
[26:36] our children and how that we teach and
[26:37] how that we
[26:38] would want to witness our conscience can
[26:42] only correctly be formed
[26:43] by divine revelation
[26:51] so that we can do right for the right
[26:53] reasons
[26:55] our conscience has got to be formed by
[26:58] the revelation of god's word
[26:59] so that we can will to do right and then
[27:01] do it for the right reasons
[27:03] it's very important for us to understand
[27:05] that there's a way that revelation forms
[27:06] then
[27:07] our conscience now in our text in romans
[27:10] chapter 2 verses 13 to 15 and we're just
[27:12] carving out
[27:13] the middle piece to that the
[27:14] parenthetical phrase
[27:16] there's going to come a time when god's
[27:18] going to judge all the thoughts of
[27:20] men's hearts those that were without the
[27:21] law and those who are with the law both
[27:24] jew and gentile is where he's
[27:26] what he's looking at then he says for
[27:27] the he that hears of the law
[27:30] for not the hearers it's not just the
[27:31] years of the law or israel that are just
[27:33] before god those that hear
[27:35] and have been given the law and to whom
[27:36] the law pertained but the doers of the
[27:39] law
[27:39] shall be justified those that do and
[27:42] fulfill the intent of the law are
[27:44] justified
[27:45] for when the gentiles which have not the
[27:47] law they're not beneficiaries of the law
[27:48] they weren't given the law
[27:50] and even when the gospel was brought to
[27:52] them they were not brought to
[27:54] the law they were brought to grace and
[27:57] that there was a mixing and a blending
[27:58] and a hybrid
[28:00] of judaism with christianity that was
[28:02] trying to take a gentile who is to
[28:04] receive grace and make them subject to
[28:06] the law
[28:08] and so the gentiles which have not the
[28:09] law do by nature the things contained in
[28:12] the law
[28:13] these when they do what's in the law
[28:15] when they fulfill the law when they're
[28:17] walking according to the thoughts
[28:19] and the intent of the law they although
[28:21] they don't have the law
[28:23] are a law unto themselves and then
[28:25] notice how beautiful that is
[28:26] because the law which was what written
[28:28] on tablets of stone
[28:30] something that was written and passed
[28:31] down and even continued to be written
[28:33] and read
[28:34] which shows the work of the law written
[28:36] in their hearts
[28:38] so he said the gentiles don't have it
[28:40] written on tablets now god has done
[28:42] something
[28:42] where it's written within themselves and
[28:45] they have a law that's now working
[28:46] within themselves you see how this is
[28:48] really a theme in the book of romans
[28:50] this law this new law that's inside of
[28:52] them and then he says so not only is the
[28:54] law written in their hearts
[28:55] their conscience also bearing witness
[28:58] and their thoughts the meanwhile
[29:00] accusing or else excusing
[29:03] one another it's kind of an interesting
[29:05] picture
[29:07] so it says their conscience this in the
[29:09] greek the word here
[29:10] the the kind of the root and the meaning
[29:13] behind the conscience that's used in the
[29:15] new testament
[29:16] is a persisting notion some thought
[29:19] that's persisting something that's there
[29:21] and it speaks of a moral consciousness
[29:23] something that's present kind of pushing
[29:25] a persistent notion that guides directs
[29:27] and i think maybe in in certain images
[29:31] in in fiction or whatever you have this
[29:33] image of
[29:34] the good angel on the one side and the
[29:36] bad and the devil on the other side
[29:38] and one saying well you shouldn't do
[29:40] that no one said no you should do it now
[29:41] you shouldn't do that
[29:43] in some ways that's you know whether
[29:44] it's the the devil or the angel
[29:47] either one of us a notion a persisting
[29:49] notion something that's guiding you
[29:51] so it says their conscience i want to
[29:52] amplify this a little bit their
[29:53] conscience also
[29:55] bearing witness so conscience we saw in
[29:57] john 8 convicts
[29:59] they were convicted by their own
[30:01] conscience now this conscience says
[30:03] it bears witness in other words their
[30:04] conscience testifies
[30:06] their conscience gives record as i said
[30:09] before that it convicts i mean
[30:10] it's something that is giving record
[30:12] it's something that's witnessing it's
[30:13] something that's
[30:14] uh saying that's good that's bad so
[30:16] their conscience
[30:17] the word is written in their hearts
[30:18] their word is in some some place
[30:21] deep within their souls they say that
[30:22] word now by the new birth is engrafted
[30:24] into the soul you're born again
[30:26] by the word of truth but now your
[30:29] conscience
[30:30] agrees saying this is how that they're
[30:33] living and fulfilling the law
[30:35] their conscience bears witness the jews
[30:38] have a saying that the soul of man
[30:40] witnesses
[30:41] in him that's what paul is referring to
[30:44] now he says it this way of himself in
[30:46] romans chapter 9 verse 1
[30:48] i say the truth in christ i lie not so
[30:51] he's saying i'm not lying i'm telling
[30:52] the truth
[30:53] and he says my conscience also bearing
[30:55] me witness
[30:56] in the holy ghost so i'm not lying i'm
[30:59] telling the truth
[31:00] my conscience overshadowed by the holy
[31:03] ghost confirms
[31:04] it i'm not being a hypocrite i'm not
[31:07] just
[31:07] telling you one thing and feeling
[31:08] another i speak the truth
[31:10] and as i speak it my own conscience is
[31:13] in harmony
[31:14] with with what i'm saying there's no
[31:16] there's nothing out of place there's
[31:18] nothing just disconcerting
[31:19] i don't feel hypocritical i don't feel
[31:21] two-faced by saying this i don't feel
[31:23] uneasy i don't feel like unrest i'm
[31:25] speaking the truth i'm not lying
[31:27] my own conscience which is overshadowed
[31:30] by the holy ghost
[31:31] and agrees with the holy ghost confirms
[31:33] that what i'm speaking is the truth
[31:36] i'm i'm trying just to amplify a little
[31:38] bit what our conscience is in the
[31:40] scripture
[31:41] so our conscience judges our actions
[31:43] their conscience also bearing witness
[31:46] it judges our actions and it sets as a
[31:48] judge over our thoughts and our feelings
[31:50] assigning to them the moral qualities of
[31:53] phrase
[31:53] of praise or blame
[31:57] or guilt rather i blame more guilt i
[32:00] think either one would work
[32:01] so our conscience sets there and it
[32:03] judges it was judging paul as he spoke
[32:06] and his conscience said you're saying
[32:08] the truth
[32:10] and so our conscience then can praise us
[32:12] or it can cause
[32:13] bring this blame and a sense of guilt
[32:16] he says in second corinthians chapter 1
[32:18] verse 12 for our rejoicing is this
[32:21] the testimony of our conscience that in
[32:23] simplicity and godly sincerity
[32:25] not with fleshly wisdom so there's got
[32:28] to be a simplicity and godly
[32:30] sincerity to uh they're rejoicing and
[32:32] the testimony of our conscience by the
[32:34] grace of god
[32:35] we have our we have had our conversation
[32:37] in the world and more abundantly to you
[32:39] word i
[32:39] i think it's a beautiful scripture
[32:41] that's going to deserve more attention
[32:43] than i'm giving
[32:44] these other parts but notice he says the
[32:46] testimony of our conscience
[32:49] when paul says it that my conscience
[32:51] also bearing witness
[32:52] their conscience also bearing witness
[32:54] the testimony of our conscience it means
[32:56] he has
[32:56] nothing on his conscience to or he knows
[32:59] nothing
[33:00] against himself he knows nothing against
[33:03] what he's sharing he knows nothing
[33:04] against
[33:05] what it what his burden is and his
[33:06] desires is so he says my
[33:08] the testimony of my conscience i have a
[33:10] clear conscience
[33:12] i have nothing in my conscience against
[33:14] myself
[33:16] so this is the nature of conscience it
[33:18] convicts it testifies
[33:20] it bears witness and so it's something
[33:23] that's
[33:24] judging and assigning praise or or guilt
[33:27] praise or guilt
[33:29] then this this statement here their
[33:30] thoughts the meanwhile
[33:32] accusing or else excusing one another
[33:34] well there you go
[33:36] paul is taking what the conscience
[33:37] bearing witness
[33:39] puts it in this in these terms
[33:42] that meanwhile their thoughts will
[33:45] either alternately
[33:46] defend them or accuse them
[33:50] and and there's there's different ways i
[33:53] realize
[33:53] there's a different way that this can
[33:55] manifest that if you have somebody who's
[33:58] doing right
[33:59] and their conscience then agrees
[34:02] so their thoughts are saying you've done
[34:04] well but when they've done something
[34:06] wrong
[34:07] then you can have this thought that says
[34:08] you ought not to have done that
[34:11] and so they have this conscience he's
[34:13] saying their thoughts alternately
[34:15] saying accusing or excusing accusing
[34:18] or accepting accusing or saying it's
[34:20] saying you've done well
[34:22] so the conscience can accuse or it can
[34:25] excuse
[34:27] our conscience can vindicate or condemn
[34:30] i know what you're thinking when you
[34:32] finally start saying something we you
[34:34] know we haven't heard or where the gift
[34:35] really starts working
[34:36] we'll start nodding a little bit more
[34:38] fervently with our eyes open
[34:40] preferably
[34:43] so conscience is an inward witness
[34:47] it being an inward witness no one can
[34:49] know it but god who knows all things
[34:53] i i can i can i can i can look at you
[34:56] and
[34:56] and try to read your mind and and and i
[34:59] can say oh i know what you're thinking
[35:01] and
[35:01] and a lot of people try to guess at it
[35:03] but you
[35:04] know what your conscience is even when
[35:07] you're very adamant about something
[35:09] you know when your conscience is
[35:11] gripping you
[35:13] and god knows it too
[35:17] so it's an inward witness now
[35:20] i'm going to take a a focus here on how
[35:23] that our conscience ought to be
[35:26] in hebrews chapter 10 verse 22 it's
[35:28] going to it's gonna show the nature
[35:30] of conscience and how god deals with it
[35:35] because when paul excuse me when john
[35:36] says if our heart condemns us
[35:39] god is greater than our heart he's
[35:40] speaking about our conscience
[35:44] and god is mindful of your conscience
[35:48] and so he says let us draw near with the
[35:50] true heart
[35:52] in full assurance of faith let us draw
[35:55] near let us come boldly before the
[35:56] throne of grace
[35:57] let us draw near unto him with the true
[35:58] heart in full
[36:00] assurance of faith that's what i desire
[36:02] to be made manifest life a true heart
[36:05] in full assurance of faith not just a
[36:07] heart of faith but a true heart
[36:09] in full assurance of faith and it says
[36:12] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[36:15] conscience and our bodies washed with
[36:16] pure water
[36:18] it's not just not the it's not a merely
[36:21] a reference to water baptism where we
[36:23] would need to be washed
[36:24] with water which has been purified but
[36:26] it's a reference to this body of a
[36:28] person
[36:30] and the completeness of our being and so
[36:32] we must
[36:33] draw near with the true heart and full
[36:34] assurance of faith and then he says this
[36:36] having a heart sprinkled from an evil
[36:38] conscience
[36:40] salvation begins with the cleaning of
[36:43] our conscience
[36:45] this is where salvation begins if we're
[36:47] going to experience salvation it must
[36:49] begin
[36:50] with cleaning our conscience of guilt
[36:53] so we could take a step back and say
[36:55] salvation is
[36:56] begins when the word convicts our
[36:59] conscience
[37:00] of guilt and in order for us to
[37:02] experience salvation there has to be a
[37:04] cleansing of guilt
[37:05] if you never feel guilt then where's the
[37:07] repentance
[37:09] so this is the real heaviness salvation
[37:10] then begins with god dealing through it
[37:12] with us through our conscience
[37:14] and then cleansing and purifying
[37:17] our consciousness of guilt because the
[37:20] blood of jesus christ
[37:21] purifies the heart the blood is is
[37:24] designed
[37:25] to purify one's conscience so
[37:28] if we're going to have justifying faith
[37:30] if we believe in justification if we
[37:32] have justifying faith
[37:33] it is it insists that we know
[37:36] our sins are gone
[37:40] that's what justifying i'd say it
[37:41] implies it but i just want to say insist
[37:43] it you cannot have justifying faith if
[37:46] you do not believe your sins are gone
[37:49] so this is the very basis a heart
[37:52] sprinkled from an evil conscience
[37:54] means that you no longer have a guilty
[37:56] conscience
[37:57] an evil conscience is a condemning
[37:59] conscience an evil conscience is a
[38:01] guilty conscience
[38:02] we want to have our consciences first
[38:05] cleansed
[38:07] our conscience cleansed from any guilt
[38:12] so having our hearts sprinkled from an
[38:13] evil conscience this is what
[38:15] brings us into fellowship in first peter
[38:17] chapter 3 verse 21 the like figure
[38:19] whereunto
[38:19] even baptism does also now save us not
[38:23] the putting away of the filth of the
[38:24] flesh
[38:25] but water baptism now is the answer of a
[38:28] good conscience towards god
[38:31] that's what actual physical water
[38:33] baptism is it's an
[38:34] answer of a good conscience a good
[38:37] conscience
[38:38] is one that is not condemned so
[38:41] baptism is the answer of a clear
[38:43] conscience
[38:45] it knows that sins have been atoned for
[38:47] so when you know that your sins have
[38:49] been forgiven
[38:50] water baptism is an outward sign or
[38:53] of an answer of a conscience i know i am
[38:56] no longer guilty
[38:58] i know my sins are no longer held
[39:00] against me i know that they've been
[39:02] atoned for
[39:02] so a good conscience is one that is not
[39:04] condemned
[39:06] and let me say this our hearts must
[39:08] experience
[39:09] pardon in order to experience renewal
[39:15] if we say well i forgive you but
[39:18] listen god doesn't put us on probation
[39:21] there is no purgatory
[39:24] all right we are justified
[39:27] freely forever
[39:31] when we receive when our conscience is
[39:33] sprinkled by this
[39:34] blood of jesus christ when it's been
[39:36] washed then it's something where
[39:38] we experience a full pardon of
[39:40] forgiveness
[39:41] a justification so that i have a
[39:43] conscience that is not defiled with this
[39:45] sense that
[39:46] i'm still under condemnation i'm still
[39:49] under penalty in hebrews chapter 10
[39:52] verse 2
[39:53] for when they would not have ceased to
[39:55] be offered it's talking about the
[39:56] natural sacrifice and the bringing of
[39:57] continual goats and
[39:59] sacrifices under the law for then would
[40:01] they not have ceased to be offered
[40:03] if it had accomplished what it was
[40:04] supposed to ultimately accomplish
[40:06] then why would they continually be
[40:07] offering it because that the worshipers
[40:09] once purged
[40:11] should have had no more conscience of
[40:14] sins
[40:16] it's very important to understand what
[40:17] the scripture is saying here
[40:20] if if the sacrifice of an animal
[40:24] had it fully atoned in the way that the
[40:27] blood of jesus christ has
[40:29] then they would have offered it once and
[40:32] that would have been it
[40:34] but he's saying that that they would
[40:36] have they should have no more
[40:38] conscience of sins that means they'd be
[40:41] discharged from the guilt
[40:43] of sin and discharged from the penalty
[40:46] of sin and if discharged why another
[40:49] sacrifice
[40:51] why would you have to continually offer
[40:53] it you would you would not be liable to
[40:55] condemnation
[40:56] you would not be subject to punishment
[40:58] so what would the need be to sacrifice
[41:01] again
[41:02] and so it says in hebrews chapter nine
[41:04] verse nine which
[41:05] he said this previously so i think first
[41:07] chapter 10 is amplifying this more but
[41:09] let's
[41:10] look at it backwards here the worshiper
[41:12] once purged would have had no more
[41:14] conscience of sins
[41:15] if the what the law the sacrifices of
[41:18] the law accomplished what christ
[41:19] accomplished
[41:20] hebrews 9 9 which was a figure from the
[41:22] time then present
[41:24] in which were offered both gifts and
[41:26] sacrifices this is the sacrifices under
[41:28] the law
[41:29] that could not make him that did the
[41:31] service
[41:32] perfect pertaining to what
[41:36] as pertaining to the conscience
[41:41] the blood of a bull the blood of a goat
[41:43] never made
[41:44] the offers conscious perfect a man would
[41:47] go and offer the sins of a bull and he'd
[41:49] be like that bull has no idea what i've
[41:50] done
[41:52] this goat has no i'm being identified
[41:54] with it but he knew
[41:55] in his in his mind he knew that he was
[41:57] still he had still
[41:58] done it and that this was merely to
[42:01] appease
[42:02] god's wrath this is this is in and
[42:04] walking in accordance to
[42:06] the law which we have been commanded but
[42:07] the scriptures acknowledging that
[42:09] everyone that offered that sacrifice
[42:11] had to continually offer and there's
[42:13] things that were continually done
[42:15] in things that were offered for
[42:16] instances of sin in order to what
[42:18] protect the sinner from judgment but he
[42:22] still had a conscience that would
[42:23] condemn him
[42:25] so let's invert this is what the bible
[42:28] bible's trying to say
[42:30] in pointing out that the the offering of
[42:32] a sacrifice in the old testament
[42:34] could not bring an answer of a good
[42:36] conscience
[42:37] and could not purge them of their
[42:38] consciousness of sin and he says it
[42:40] could not make the ones that offered it
[42:42] perfect
[42:43] as pertaining to the conscious then what
[42:45] we can believe and what we can accept
[42:47] is that the blood of jesus christ can
[42:50] perfectly remove the sense of guilt
[42:53] that this is how we if that if those
[42:55] sacrifices and offerings were imperfect
[42:58] and that it did not purge this worshiper
[43:01] of the consciences
[43:02] his conscience a guilty conscience and
[43:04] it did not
[43:05] perfect his conscience then the blood of
[43:08] jesus christ
[43:09] does perfect our conscience
[43:13] removes the sense of guilt it frees our
[43:16] hearts
[43:17] from the feeling of condemnation that's
[43:19] what it ought to do
[43:23] so it says in verse 14. how much more
[43:26] shall the blood of christ
[43:29] who through the eternal spirit offered
[43:31] himself without spot
[43:33] to god purge your conscience from dead
[43:35] works to serve the living god
[43:39] if the blood of animals was some
[43:41] perpetuation which stayed the judgment
[43:43] and and conducted worship to or was a
[43:46] conduct of worship to help the sinner
[43:48] how much more ought the blood of jesus
[43:50] christ purify your heart from fear
[43:54] purge your conscience from guilt purge
[43:56] your
[43:57] your thoughts from alienation from him
[44:00] and it says it actually purge your
[44:02] conscience from dead works
[44:04] so it's actually purging us from
[44:05] self-preservation
[44:07] where there's a sense of condemnation
[44:08] there's a sense of guilt there remains
[44:10] the the unction then to do something for
[44:13] yourself
[44:15] fight or flight i got to do something i
[44:17] got to preserve myself
[44:18] it purges us of selfishness so the word
[44:21] notice what the scripture is saying the
[44:23] word removes the stain of sin
[44:26] even in our conscience bringing peace
[44:31] bringing pardon pacifying any any
[44:34] uncomfortable notions
[44:35] and it therefore it purifies our
[44:38] conscience
[44:40] when it says it purges your conscience
[44:42] from dead works dead works or those that
[44:43] do not spring forth from faith and love
[44:47] any works you say any work that is not
[44:51] birthed from faith or love is a dead
[44:52] work even if
[44:54] it comports with a commandment
[44:58] still a dead work dead works are not you
[45:01] know
[45:02] uh you know snorting cocaine oh that's a
[45:04] dead work
[45:05] you know what dead work would be being
[45:08] baptized without a revelation
[45:10] of the forgiveness of sins
[45:14] romans chapter five verse one this is
[45:15] how it can conclude this therefore being
[45:17] justified
[45:18] by faith we have peace with god through
[45:20] our lord jesus christ
[45:23] justification means i'm free from the
[45:25] guilt of sin
[45:26] and sin which deserves punishment
[45:30] this oh i i i want to i want to
[45:33] just i feel that i would just be
[45:37] it would be worth repeating over and
[45:38] over again to 100 got it
[45:42] to some of us justification is this
[45:45] thought
[45:46] that to god i never did it in the first
[45:49] place
[45:51] and somehow we're having to constantly
[45:53] remind ourselves and tell ourselves
[45:54] that i've been justified i've been
[45:56] justified but a revelation of
[45:58] justification ought to
[46:00] spill over from a soul that has been set
[46:03] free and is
[46:03] sealed and cannot be touched by anything
[46:05] other than faith
[46:06] ought to spill over into our conscience
[46:09] and therefore
[46:10] be afforded a conscience that is not
[46:13] condemned
[46:15] that we are justified by faith but how
[46:17] am i going to live in all the attributes
[46:20] and qualities
[46:21] and characteristics of justifying faith
[46:23] if i allow my conscience to be condemned
[46:28] so being justified by faith i have peace
[46:30] with god
[46:32] and my mind is at peace i i am
[46:34] justification means and i claim
[46:36] and i will ask for and i will pray for
[46:38] and i will desire to be delivered from
[46:41] any guilt of sin
[46:44] because a clear conscience and a clean
[46:48] conscience
[46:49] is one that is at peace there's no sense
[46:52] of lingering guilt
[46:54] we're not living in dread that
[46:57] something's going to catch up to us
[47:00] right as we focus victory victory ahead
[47:02] is victory now
[47:04] so we're not just looking to our past
[47:06] thinking that somehow something's going
[47:07] to accumulate to overthrow us
[47:10] but so there's no sense of a lingering
[47:12] guilt
[47:13] it's a heart that's been liberated it's
[47:15] a heart that's not condemned
[47:17] these are some of the principles in the
[47:19] word of god showing us
[47:21] how the how god deals with our
[47:24] conscience
[47:26] do you follow this god deals with our
[47:28] conscience
[47:30] the word is doing this he has purified
[47:33] your souls my soul is set free my soul
[47:35] is delivered i'm born again by the
[47:36] baptism
[47:37] it goes to my soul what about a
[47:38] conscience
[47:42] how what kind of doubling would there be
[47:45] i'd like to really get into that just
[47:47] even the principles of schizophrenia
[47:49] and some of us are you know message
[47:51] schizophrenics
[47:54] in a real sense because we've received a
[47:57] word that
[47:58] transforms our souls but we allow so
[48:01] much nonsense to take place in our
[48:03] conscience
[48:04] that's like we're living a double
[48:06] there's two different people
[48:09] you got you believe yourself and your
[48:11] and your doubting self
[48:12] and it's like which one's going to show
[48:14] up today
[48:20] now take it a step further and i really
[48:22] really want to hurry
[48:24] because i i purpose that if i was at a
[48:26] certain point if i didn't get to a
[48:28] certain point in an hour i was gonna
[48:29] just have to shut her down
[48:30] so be careful which way you pray i don't
[48:33] want anybody hoping i shut down too soon
[48:36] wouldn't want anybody dragging this
[48:38] prolong in this too long so
[48:41] now but john if you could give this next
[48:44] slide
[48:46] conscience is different
[48:49] from consciousness
[48:54] i didn't get a wow or ooh
[48:58] conscience is different ponder this now
[49:00] think about this
[49:01] we have a conscience
[49:05] but then there's consciousness or to be
[49:07] conscious
[49:08] now i want to divide these two because
[49:10] this is a very important distinction to
[49:12] make here
[49:12] these are two distinctly different words
[49:16] but they're derived from the same latin
[49:17] roots the khan in sayer which is
[49:20] the khan which means to be together
[49:22] joined joined together jointly and the
[49:24] verb
[49:24] sired which means to know is what we get
[49:27] science from
[49:28] con science it's joined these things are
[49:30] joined together
[49:32] so you have conscience and that's what
[49:33] we've been focusing on so far
[49:35] but i would take a moment i want to step
[49:37] back and look at kant to be conscious
[49:40] and a con to be conscious is an
[49:42] adjective so our conscience is a noun
[49:44] conscious is an adjective which means
[49:46] knowing or to be aware of
[49:49] so if you're conscious of something
[49:50] you're aware of a fact
[49:52] if you're conscious of something you're
[49:54] endowed with certain mental faculties
[49:56] so if someone is conscious what we mean
[49:58] is a person is awake and alert
[50:01] able to understand what is happening
[50:03] around them
[50:05] when when someone is asleep or someone
[50:06] gets knocked out what do you say they're
[50:08] unconscious we know they're breathing
[50:10] we know that they're they have all these
[50:11] other vital signs but they don't have a
[50:13] mental awareness of what's happening
[50:16] and that's what consciousness is so it
[50:19] indicates whether a person is alert and
[50:20] able to understand things
[50:22] around them and so consciousness can
[50:25] relate to
[50:27] or imply that a person is aware of a
[50:29] particular fact
[50:31] are you aware that it's cold are you
[50:34] aware that it's hot are you aware that
[50:35] this has happened or that's happened
[50:36] could be a conscious that you're aware
[50:38] of a particular feeling
[50:40] like a a burning or or or a chill
[50:44] something those are
[50:45] ways that you could say someone is
[50:46] conscious of something and then it's
[50:48] also used in the sense that one's
[50:50] consciousness
[50:53] will will moderate
[50:56] whether an act is deliberate or
[50:59] intentional
[51:00] whether it's someone who was just the
[51:02] decision to do something
[51:04] yeah i i intended to throw the rock over
[51:07] the fence
[51:08] but i wasn't conscious that it would hit
[51:09] the window
[51:11] right brother jack i i
[51:15] i knew what i was doing when i threw the
[51:17] rock over the fence
[51:18] but i wasn't aware that it would hit the
[51:20] window
[51:23] unless you he actually meant to hit the
[51:25] window
[51:29] hypothetically right brother jack
[51:34] this is what conscious our consciousness
[51:38] means it's an awareness of thoughts
[51:40] awareness of actions or feelings
[51:42] sensations perceptions
[51:43] it's an awareness of mental processes
[51:45] it's awareness of our thinking
[51:48] so consciousness then is seen kind of as
[51:50] like a
[51:52] uh it shifts
[51:55] our consciousness shifts based upon
[51:58] processes many different things that are
[52:02] happening
[52:07] so our consciousness can i i just want
[52:09] to be very deliberate how i express this
[52:12] our consciousness changes based upon
[52:14] what we're sensing or what we're feeling
[52:17] and so it can be uh what based upon what
[52:20] i'm thinking
[52:20] based upon what i'm seeing what i'm
[52:22] experiencing in the world around me is
[52:24] what informs
[52:25] informs my conscious mind
[52:29] now conscious mind it's it's i realized
[52:31] as i was studying this in the message
[52:33] last week that brother bannon makes
[52:34] reference
[52:35] to the five outlets of the spirit
[52:36] imagination conscience memory reason and
[52:38] affection
[52:40] and and so these elements these gates
[52:42] are these channels in the spirit you can
[52:44] see that these elements are certainly
[52:45] making up consciousness the conscious
[52:48] mind even in science and
[52:50] and study is a defense fantasies or
[52:53] feelings or memories
[52:55] and perceptions your imagination your
[52:58] memory
[52:59] your reason your affection this is all
[53:00] in the conscious mind
[53:04] and so consciousness is the aspect of
[53:07] many different
[53:08] mental processes instead of it just
[53:12] being a single process itself
[53:14] i hope i'm not losing you should should
[53:17] we should we deviate into quantum
[53:18] mechanics for a moment just to
[53:20] get all on the same page and
[53:22] schrodinger's cat
[53:25] i think i had some people throwing down
[53:27] some serious types on that the other day
[53:28] and i was like this is going to get good
[53:29] when we get to it
[53:33] the consciousness then is an aggregation
[53:36] of all these different mental processes
[53:38] it's not just a mental process in itself
[53:40] so therefore you can see that our
[53:42] conscious is informed by imagination
[53:44] memory
[53:45] reason affection conscience because
[53:47] think about that
[53:53] let me just use an example
[53:57] our memories can be conscious but
[54:00] consciousness is not only a memory
[54:03] right we can be conscious of our
[54:06] affection
[54:06] but conscious is not only affection
[54:11] this is this is how consciousness
[54:13] relates to these things
[54:16] so consciousness gives us the ability to
[54:18] be aware of what's happening around us
[54:21] we can say that it's even related to
[54:23] perception in a sense but consciousness
[54:24] gives us the ability to be aware of the
[54:26] world around you and how you fit into it
[54:29] you ever heard of someone who's not able
[54:31] to read the room or know your audience
[54:34] that's somebody who's not conscious
[54:37] sometimes
[54:38] of how they fit into a particular
[54:39] situation
[54:41] but let's take it to another level
[54:45] if consciousness gives us the ability to
[54:48] be aware of the world around us and how
[54:50] we fit into it conscience
[54:53] and this is maybe more appropriate to
[54:54] the person who doesn't know how to read
[54:55] the room
[54:56] conscience is your ability to act
[54:57] correctly within the world that you're
[54:59] conscious of
[55:02] so do you start to notice the difference
[55:04] i know we're just right here right in
[55:06] the middle of a service
[55:07] kind of slowing down and making this
[55:08] distinction but consciousness
[55:11] gives us the awareness of the world
[55:13] around us what the circumstances are in
[55:15] the situation
[55:16] conscience tells you what the right
[55:18] thing would be to do
[55:19] in relation to those things conscience
[55:22] is different from the senses and
[55:24] thoughts that are based upon
[55:27] sensory perception and reflex that's our
[55:30] consciousness
[55:31] our consciousness is based upon reflex
[55:33] and sensory input but our conscience is
[55:35] different from that
[55:36] our conscience is the ability to discern
[55:38] between right and wrong
[55:39] our conscience is what tells us what is
[55:41] moral our conscience is what tells us
[55:43] what's appropriate
[55:45] so someone can be fully conscious
[55:49] but what is going to help them in
[55:52] relation to what they're conscious of
[55:54] the right kind of conscience and so i'm
[55:57] just a minute under an
[55:58] hour because i said if i didn't get to
[55:59] this in an hour i'm going to have to
[56:00] just stop but here we go i'm gonna
[56:02] try this first timothy chapter four we
[56:04] may just do it really quick because i
[56:05] wanna
[56:06] highlight this and move on this is where
[56:09] i think i'm
[56:09] we'll be picking up on next time first
[56:12] timothy chapter four verses one to two
[56:14] this is where you can begin to see this
[56:16] divide between conscience
[56:18] and consciousness now the spirit
[56:20] speaketh espressly
[56:22] that in the latter times some shall
[56:24] depart from the faith
[56:27] giving heed to seducing spirits and
[56:29] doctrines of devils
[56:30] speaking lies and hypocrisy having their
[56:33] conscience seared
[56:34] with a hot iron think about that
[56:38] having their conscience seared with a
[56:40] hot iron
[56:42] now it says speaking lies and hypocrisy
[56:46] a hypocrite's a traitor to conscience
[56:51] and so the more hypocritical you become
[56:55] the more the dissonance has got to be
[56:57] remedied
[56:58] and what happens to a really really good
[57:00] liar they forget their line
[57:03] and that's how good they get at it like
[57:06] he does realize that if a helicopter
[57:08] doesn't land in 15 minutes
[57:10] he's lied about the fact that his dad
[57:11] owns a helicopter and he's picking him
[57:12] up from church
[57:13] and he's on his way here now and should
[57:15] be here in 15 minutes
[57:17] like the gig's up at that point but a
[57:19] con artist someone who's lying
[57:21] always feels comfortable why because
[57:23] they've gotten to the place where
[57:24] they're calloused and so heartened
[57:26] so these hypocritical liars he's saying
[57:28] that there's this process
[57:30] unfold they shall depart from the faith
[57:31] given he deserving spirits and doctrines
[57:33] of devils
[57:33] speaking lies and hypocrisy these
[57:35] hip-hop hypocritical liars
[57:37] whose consciences are seared their
[57:39] seared conscience
[57:40] makes them incapable of acting correctly
[57:45] their conscience is seared with the hot
[57:46] iron so this is a conscience
[57:48] that's been cauterized or hardened it's
[57:50] past feeling
[57:52] so they have no regard as to what
[57:54] they're saying or what they're doing
[57:55] and the consequence of it and what paul
[57:58] begins to point out i want you to really
[58:00] focus in
[58:01] especially for our neighbors in the
[58:02] apartment next door really focus in
[58:05] once they've spoken these lies in
[58:07] hypocrisy and come to a place where
[58:08] their conscience is seared with the hot
[58:10] iron
[58:10] they are past feeling and have no regard
[58:12] for what they're doing whether it's
[58:13] right or wrong
[58:14] but under a cloak of justice
[58:17] under a cloak of self-righteousness
[58:24] they commit wrong acts
[58:28] they do things hateful spiteful and
[58:30] harmful they do unrighteousness
[58:34] there is a this is a i want to point out
[58:37] it's a consciousness that has been
[58:38] defiled to the point to where
[58:41] it's evil and it is not moved
[58:44] appropriately
[58:46] like what i'm about to do can destroy
[58:48] but the conscience doesn't
[58:50] say that wouldn't be right it excuses it
[58:55] it's dead that part's dead they don't
[58:56] have the appropriate uh
[58:58] feeling that what they're doing is is
[59:00] wrong
[59:01] there's a there's another sense that
[59:03] maybe it might fit within the spectrum
[59:05] as things unfold to a point where you
[59:06] begin to
[59:08] uh depart from the departure from faith
[59:10] results in this
[59:11] dissonance and this these activities and
[59:13] these things that are being done and
[59:14] they have what's called a branded
[59:16] conscience and this is how a lot of
[59:17] people
[59:18] interpret the scripture that it's
[59:20] branded in that they're acting against
[59:22] their conscience they're aware that
[59:23] their actions are wrong
[59:25] so they have a bad conscience and their
[59:27] constant is branded like a
[59:29] like a mark has been placed on them and
[59:31] they know i shouldn't be doing this is
[59:32] awful this is horrible
[59:34] but one whose conscience has been
[59:36] branded can
[59:37] put be pushed to the point where it no
[59:39] longer has feeling
[59:43] and so there's different states of
[59:44] conscience conscience
[59:46] in the bible it can be pure or good
[59:49] and if you study in the scriptures
[59:51] you'll find that it can be weak
[59:53] it can be defiled it can be evil and it
[59:56] can be seared
[59:58] and so as you see these the the these
[1:00:01] the spectrum of conscience
[1:00:03] that it can be pure good weak
[1:00:07] defiled evil seared
[1:00:11] and each one of these is going to have a
[1:00:12] way to where the person interacts
[1:00:14] and moves let me say this the opposite
[1:00:17] of a seared or numb conscience
[1:00:19] is a clean conscience
[1:00:22] so i'd like to go quickly through just a
[1:00:26] few points this is kind of putting some
[1:00:27] stuff there that maybe we can pick back
[1:00:28] up later
[1:00:29] and build into something that makes that
[1:00:31] is is more relevant to us but i i want
[1:00:33] to
[1:00:34] take it from this scripture some shall
[1:00:37] depart from the faith
[1:00:40] in the departing is the departure from
[1:00:42] the faith that weakens the conscience
[1:00:46] and having a conscience that's weakened
[1:00:48] it leads it to becoming defiled
[1:00:51] evil seared
[1:00:55] so departure
[1:01:00] from the faith is not
[1:01:03] a departure from belief
[1:01:06] the departure from faith is not a
[1:01:08] departure from religion
[1:01:12] to depart from the faith what's
[1:01:13] happening in first timothy chapter four
[1:01:15] verses one to two the prophecy
[1:01:17] of the very times that we're living in
[1:01:18] now where people depart from the faith
[1:01:20] and give heed to seducing spirits
[1:01:22] doctrines of devils
[1:01:23] speak lies and hypocrisy having their
[1:01:25] conscience seared with the hot iron
[1:01:27] what happens is they do not depart from
[1:01:30] belief or religion but their faith is no
[1:01:33] longer anchored in the word
[1:01:36] they still have a fervency they still
[1:01:38] have a passion they still have a desire
[1:01:40] they still have a conviction they still
[1:01:41] have a religious heir to them
[1:01:43] but their faith is no longer in the word
[1:01:48] how did brother bradham say it that a
[1:01:49] christian's emotions and exuberance and
[1:01:52] passions and excitements
[1:01:53] are solely on the lord of glory and his
[1:01:56] love while the world
[1:01:57] satisfies the flesh the departure from
[1:02:00] the faith is when all those things are
[1:02:01] turned away
[1:02:02] from the word and now begin to look to
[1:02:04] the flesh
[1:02:07] so think about this a little bit
[1:02:09] society's becoming more and more
[1:02:10] self-conscious
[1:02:14] conscious
[1:02:17] we're talking about conscience versus
[1:02:19] consciousness there's a social
[1:02:21] consciousness
[1:02:22] that is taking over and it's a
[1:02:24] consciousness where
[1:02:25] we're aware of feelings in motives and
[1:02:28] desires
[1:02:29] and people are becoming especially more
[1:02:31] in sin more sensitive
[1:02:32] to injustice and what is everyone
[1:02:35] calling it to be woke
[1:02:37] right right that you're you're woke
[1:02:40] you're
[1:02:40] you're sensitive now you're now
[1:02:42] conscious of injustice you're now
[1:02:44] conscious of things that are wrong
[1:02:45] but what has happened society's becoming
[1:02:48] more and more
[1:02:48] woke but they lack the conscience
[1:02:54] to act within their alertness
[1:02:58] and so what is everyone doing they're
[1:03:00] all hypocrites
[1:03:03] amen can i get a witness
[1:03:07] [Music]
[1:03:09] that's what we we sit back and we
[1:03:11] realize well that seems hypocritical
[1:03:13] and listen don't also get real
[1:03:15] sanctimonious about the
[1:03:16] the news you feed on isn't hypocritical
[1:03:20] it's all hypocritical it's all
[1:03:23] it's it's it's without a there's no
[1:03:26] foundation it's just
[1:03:27] it's it's all cells and no anchor
[1:03:32] it lacks the conscience to behave
[1:03:34] correctly within the fallen world
[1:03:36] in all the broken systems that it's
[1:03:38] really seen
[1:03:39] well this is broken that's broken but
[1:03:41] they don't have a conscience
[1:03:46] and so what happens everyone's becoming
[1:03:49] conscious
[1:03:50] but without a conscience there's a relig
[1:03:53] religious fervor
[1:03:54] to their opinions
[1:03:59] think about it there's an ardency
[1:04:03] to political ideals to social ideals
[1:04:06] to environmental ideals to nutritional
[1:04:08] ideals there's a fir there's a religion
[1:04:10] to it
[1:04:11] come on
[1:04:15] let's be honest with ourselves
[1:04:18] and this is where we we start to feel it
[1:04:20] in our conscience
[1:04:21] and we just kind of want to turn it off
[1:04:23] don't do it
[1:04:26] let the word examine us a little bit
[1:04:29] to take a step back and realize there
[1:04:31] has been
[1:04:33] uh there's a fervency in the world today
[1:04:34] that exists
[1:04:36] for things that we we might say as a
[1:04:38] christian well i don't support this and
[1:04:39] i don't support that
[1:04:40] and i don't believe in this and i don't
[1:04:42] believe in that and you realize you have
[1:04:43] to realize it's a religious zeal behind
[1:04:45] it
[1:04:47] but why why is there now a religious
[1:04:49] zeal for these things
[1:04:51] instead of for the right things it's
[1:04:52] because christians lost
[1:04:54] their zeal for the word and now people
[1:04:58] are have no anchor and they they need an
[1:05:00] outlet they need a channel they need
[1:05:02] something to believe in
[1:05:03] they need something to just give life
[1:05:04] meaning they need they need something to
[1:05:06] give them feeling they need something to
[1:05:08] pursue
[1:05:09] and not being able to find it in the
[1:05:10] word of god not be able to find it
[1:05:12] preached over pulpits
[1:05:13] not being able to find it in the name of
[1:05:15] jesus christ they resorted to other
[1:05:17] things
[1:05:18] to feel and to live and to be animated
[1:05:25] and that's what that's the world today
[1:05:29] fully woke but no conscience
[1:05:32] because your conscience distinguishes
[1:05:34] between what's good and bad
[1:05:37] your conscience prompts you to do good
[1:05:39] stops you from doing bad
[1:05:41] our conscience commends good or it
[1:05:43] condemns bad
[1:05:46] let me say this as a
[1:05:49] uh kind of just a qualifier to the
[1:05:52] unsaved
[1:05:56] they can have a defiled conscience that
[1:05:57] prompts them to evil
[1:06:00] so this the unsaved it's there's a
[1:06:02] little bit more
[1:06:04] complexity to the unsaved but i'm trying
[1:06:07] to
[1:06:07] i'm preaching to believers who need a
[1:06:09] clean conscience
[1:06:12] without a clear conscience you can't
[1:06:14] have pure joy
[1:06:20] the difference between conscience and
[1:06:22] consciousness
[1:06:26] consciousness relates to things that we
[1:06:27] can observe
[1:06:29] i just want to lay these things out
[1:06:30] there and move on
[1:06:33] our consciousness relates to things that
[1:06:35] are observable
[1:06:37] so it relates to data my data scientists
[1:06:40] help me out today
[1:06:43] it relates to information received from
[1:06:45] our senses
[1:06:46] and so within the realm of data
[1:06:48] collection there's things that can
[1:06:50] interfere with the data collection so
[1:06:51] they're trying to improve
[1:06:53] instruments so that they can perfect the
[1:06:56] collection of data
[1:06:58] did you know when you go to check the
[1:07:00] air pressure in your tire
[1:07:02] you lose pressure so you're actually not
[1:07:05] able to observe
[1:07:07] what the pressure was at before if
[1:07:08] you're using traditional instruments
[1:07:10] so they've used they want to use
[1:07:11] instruments that better instruments to
[1:07:13] be able
[1:07:14] to remove your influence and measure
[1:07:17] things without you changing it
[1:07:21] again it has everything to do with
[1:07:22] observation
[1:07:24] so observations can be measured they can
[1:07:27] be
[1:07:28] quantified and our senses can only
[1:07:32] or can only relay the data
[1:07:35] right and we have very precise
[1:07:37] instruments in certain fields and ways
[1:07:39] to try to measure data
[1:07:40] our emotions are a means of measuring
[1:07:43] data
[1:07:45] our emotions are the sensory input you
[1:07:47] can look at the five senses of the body
[1:07:49] or even the five senses of the spirit
[1:07:52] and those senses can become close they
[1:07:53] can become dull they can become
[1:07:55] influenced
[1:07:57] but this is the point i want to i just
[1:07:58] want to highlight emphasize and come to
[1:08:00] a scripture
[1:08:02] and hopefully this kind of opens this up
[1:08:04] maybe it'll just start sealing things in
[1:08:05] and tying things together
[1:08:09] the problem many times is not with our
[1:08:11] emotions
[1:08:13] or the problem with our emotions is not
[1:08:15] in the observation
[1:08:18] but it's in our interpretation
[1:08:21] there's a difference in what we observe
[1:08:25] and how we explain what we observe
[1:08:30] we can all observe there's a gigantic
[1:08:32] hole north of flagstaff
[1:08:35] right who are you talking about that's
[1:08:38] not very nice
[1:08:40] a little bit further north called the
[1:08:42] grand canyon
[1:08:44] we can all observe the hole
[1:08:47] but then we start explaining how it got
[1:08:49] there well i think it looks just like a
[1:08:51] ufo landed here
[1:08:55] i think the navajos were the first to
[1:08:56] tap into nuclear power
[1:08:59] all right we could come up with all
[1:09:00] sorts of explanations where's the
[1:09:02] problem reside usually
[1:09:03] not in the observation the
[1:09:05] interpretation
[1:09:08] the problem arises not in what we're
[1:09:10] conscious of
[1:09:11] but how we're explaining or interpreting
[1:09:13] that
[1:09:14] so we can observe a thing we can all
[1:09:16] observe the same thing
[1:09:18] but have different explanations for it
[1:09:22] we all have different interpretations as
[1:09:24] to what it means
[1:09:26] so our consciousness then is our
[1:09:27] emotional state
[1:09:30] okay that's our observation
[1:09:34] but then it's the state of our
[1:09:35] conscience that determines our conduct
[1:09:39] we can be conscious and aware of
[1:09:41] something and this is this is observable
[1:09:43] this is quantifiable
[1:09:45] this is what my dad is telling me but we
[1:09:47] don't go by that alone
[1:09:49] we can't be moved by that our problem
[1:09:52] arises when we allow our conscience
[1:09:54] but we allow our conscience to become
[1:09:56] defiled or weak or evil
[1:09:58] and it begins to interpret and explain
[1:10:00] the data incorrectly
[1:10:03] and when we have a conscience that
[1:10:05] condemns us oh i did this
[1:10:07] well that can be observable all we need
[1:10:10] to do is watch you do
[1:10:11] i saw you do it i watched you
[1:10:15] punch him in the face
[1:10:19] and let's observe we can all just agree
[1:10:20] but then where does the problem
[1:10:22] come what comes up in everyone's
[1:10:24] explanation everyone's interpretation
[1:10:26] everyone's judgment everyone's
[1:10:28] condemnation
[1:10:30] and so it's our the state of our
[1:10:32] conscience then that's going to
[1:10:33] determine our conduct going forward
[1:10:36] so let me bring it to this ephesians
[1:10:38] chapter 4 verses 26 to 27
[1:10:43] i'm glad that i was able to throw those
[1:10:44] things out there because i'd like to
[1:10:45] pick up on them again
[1:10:48] ephesians chapter 4 verses 26 to 27
[1:10:51] be angry and sin not
[1:10:54] let not the sun go down upon your wrath
[1:10:57] neither give place to the devil
[1:11:01] this is where um it was remarkable to me
[1:11:04] this is just personal
[1:11:06] i had been studying on giving no place
[1:11:08] to the devil
[1:11:10] as it related to being numb and victory
[1:11:12] ahead is victory now
[1:11:14] and then the lord had been dealing with
[1:11:15] me on this the whole the
[1:11:17] in the same context of these things how
[1:11:20] that the problem arises not in what we
[1:11:21] observe and what's quantifiable but
[1:11:23] our interpretation of it because we can
[1:11:26] agree to the facts
[1:11:27] but what do they mean and then
[1:11:31] it was god was then dealing with my
[1:11:33] heart on a clean conscience
[1:11:36] and i felt like well i got so many
[1:11:38] different directions i could go and then
[1:11:39] the holy spirit just takes and lines it
[1:11:40] right up
[1:11:43] so they're all they're all speaking to
[1:11:44] the same thing
[1:11:47] and so if it feels like i preached three
[1:11:48] sermons today
[1:11:51] excellent observation
[1:11:54] ephesians chapter 4 though look at this
[1:11:57] verses 26 to 27 again i want to
[1:11:59] repeat it be angry and sin not let not
[1:12:02] the sun go down upon your wrath
[1:12:04] neither give place to the devil if you
[1:12:06] read in this you'll find that
[1:12:08] paul is dealing with emotions clearly
[1:12:10] just in these two verses
[1:12:12] he's addressing your emotions
[1:12:16] christians have emotions we're human so
[1:12:18] the word of god is dealing with our
[1:12:20] emotions
[1:12:20] and he's talking about being provoked to
[1:12:22] anger so if you've been provoked anger
[1:12:24] there's some sort of agitation or
[1:12:26] impulse within your spirit
[1:12:28] let's not say that it's clearly not
[1:12:31] saying that there's some sort of
[1:12:32] righteous anger that's deep within your
[1:12:35] soul that's boiling up
[1:12:37] this is you're angry it's some sort of
[1:12:39] agitation in your spirit
[1:12:41] but he says sin not do you realize what
[1:12:45] paul has done
[1:12:46] is he has allowed for anger
[1:12:49] don't get too excited
[1:12:55] man fifi might tie that bow tie on right
[1:12:56] now i might start speaking in tongues
[1:12:59] thinking i i can be angry
[1:13:02] sin not it allows for anger
[1:13:06] but it cautions to not let it cause you
[1:13:10] to miss the mark
[1:13:12] be angry but don't let that anger
[1:13:14] overwhelm you don't let it consume you
[1:13:16] don't let it overthrow you
[1:13:17] you can be angry but don't miss the mark
[1:13:20] and wonder from righteousness because of
[1:13:23] it
[1:13:24] so it allows for anger by saying there
[1:13:26] better be something else controlling it
[1:13:28] because anger left to itself or
[1:13:29] something else gets a hold of anger and
[1:13:31] you let anger
[1:13:32] linger then it can cause you to
[1:13:33] transgress and go beyond
[1:13:35] the bounds of what is morally right and
[1:13:37] what's acceptable and what's pleasing to
[1:13:38] the lord
[1:13:39] and cause you to grieve the holy spirit
[1:13:41] and then you lose your peace
[1:13:43] so it's actually making way for anger
[1:13:46] so we can say this anger itself is not a
[1:13:49] sin
[1:13:51] but anger unchecked can produce malice
[1:13:53] and bitterness and revenge
[1:13:55] and when that happens it's a failure
[1:13:57] what the conscience
[1:14:01] you can you can be conscious that i'm
[1:14:04] angry that's a conscious state
[1:14:07] i'm angry you're aware that you have
[1:14:09] this feeling that i'm angry i've been
[1:14:11] provoked i'm agitated
[1:14:12] that's that's an impulse it's a feeling
[1:14:13] that's makes up your overall
[1:14:15] consciousness
[1:14:15] how are you today i'm a little bit angry
[1:14:19] i'm also happy but i'm a little bit
[1:14:20] angry why because your consciousness is
[1:14:22] a state of many different
[1:14:24] mental processes i'm the happiest i've
[1:14:26] ever been but i'm the most stressed out
[1:14:28] i've ever been
[1:14:28] right true story
[1:14:32] and we know how that works and so you
[1:14:34] see that you can have this
[1:14:36] emotion now to where and this is when
[1:14:39] making the point
[1:14:40] pure joy is not the absence of some
[1:14:42] uncomfortable emotion
[1:14:45] you can be angry and anger itself is not
[1:14:47] sin
[1:14:48] but if our conscience fails us it
[1:14:50] becomes malice
[1:14:52] becomes bitterness turns into revenge
[1:14:56] let me prove it by scripture not that
[1:14:57] you want it but just to show it mark
[1:14:58] chapter three verse five and when he had
[1:15:00] looked round about
[1:15:01] on them with anger he's talking about
[1:15:05] jesus
[1:15:07] that's the red letter there if we had it
[1:15:08] on there well
[1:15:11] in mark chapter three i didn't put it in
[1:15:14] there
[1:15:15] the one time i'm actually gonna use the
[1:15:16] slide
[1:15:19] now it's my fault bro john i'm sorry
[1:15:22] everybody look at brother john
[1:15:24] and when he had looked round about on
[1:15:26] them with anger jesus
[1:15:29] was angry was he without sin
[1:15:34] yes sir knew no sin was without sin
[1:15:40] blameless perfect
[1:15:43] through and through was tempted in all
[1:15:46] points of manner like we were so he was
[1:15:48] angry
[1:15:48] but he did not allow his anger to lead
[1:15:51] him to sin or to transgress
[1:15:53] he was angry being grieved for the
[1:15:55] hardness of their hearts he saith unto
[1:15:57] the man
[1:15:57] stretch forth thy hand and he stretched
[1:15:59] it out and his hand was restored whole
[1:16:01] is the other
[1:16:03] now let's just put ourselves in the
[1:16:04] story oh
[1:16:06] you guys make me sick ain't gonna heal
[1:16:09] nobody today
[1:16:13] right and leave
[1:16:17] you know why none of y'all got healed
[1:16:18] today i'm sick and tired of you
[1:16:21] i actually heard a pastor one time do
[1:16:24] this
[1:16:24] i'm sick and tired of passion a bunch of
[1:16:27] people that don't have the love of god
[1:16:29] in their heart
[1:16:35] wait a minute is this a joke
[1:16:40] but that's us right
[1:16:43] that's us we're sick and tired of
[1:16:47] pastors that don't have the love of god
[1:16:48] in their heart well what about us
[1:16:50] right and this is an example where jesus
[1:16:54] was angry it's okay to be mad it's okay
[1:16:56] to be angry
[1:16:57] it's okay to be upset it's okay to cry
[1:16:59] it's okay to have sorrow
[1:17:00] jesus experienced this great wave of
[1:17:03] different emotions
[1:17:04] but yet without sin what does the devil
[1:17:07] want to do
[1:17:08] cause us to be pricked in our conscience
[1:17:10] and have
[1:17:11] guilt of sin because we sorrow guilt of
[1:17:14] sin because we're angry
[1:17:15] guilt of sin because we go through a
[1:17:17] difficult time no that's not where the
[1:17:19] sin
[1:17:19] is
[1:17:24] but jesus was angry because of the
[1:17:27] hardness of their hearts
[1:17:28] but he didn't let his anger deprive
[1:17:32] this man of his healing did not let his
[1:17:35] anger cause him to transgress against
[1:17:36] what god wanted him to do
[1:17:39] there's a saying that i came across he
[1:17:41] that will be angry and not sin
[1:17:43] let him be angry at nothing but sin
[1:17:48] he that's going to be angry and not sin
[1:17:51] then just hate the sin not the sinner
[1:17:54] you're going to be
[1:17:54] angry if not sin then know what you're
[1:17:57] angry
[1:17:58] about that when one has
[1:18:01] hurt you or offended you and made you
[1:18:03] angry be angry for the one that causes
[1:18:06] the one that motivates the one that
[1:18:07] inspired the devil that would want to
[1:18:09] destroy
[1:18:09] have empathy have feeling and compassion
[1:18:12] for the sinner
[1:18:13] hate the sin but don't hate the sinner
[1:18:17] it says let not the son be angry and sin
[1:18:19] not so it says
[1:18:20] let not the sun go down upon your anger
[1:18:22] resist
[1:18:23] any irritation or exasperation that
[1:18:26] would become a deeper sentiment than
[1:18:28] anger
[1:18:30] be angry and sin not neither give place
[1:18:33] to
[1:18:36] now this is where this is beautiful
[1:18:40] he is acknowledging and pointing out
[1:18:43] that the devil will strive to influence
[1:18:46] your mind
[1:18:46] and irritate your spirit
[1:18:50] if you're angry be angry and sin not
[1:18:54] let not the sin go down in your anger
[1:18:56] the sun go down on your anger don't let
[1:18:58] it happen don't let the sun go down on
[1:18:59] it
[1:19:00] because don't give the devil room to
[1:19:02] work
[1:19:03] though anger is not sinful there's a
[1:19:05] danger in it becoming sin
[1:19:07] if you don't address it the correct way
[1:19:09] do not allow the devil to disturb
[1:19:12] your conscience through whispers
[1:19:15] through lies slanders and accusations
[1:19:20] but act upon your anger subject to the
[1:19:23] word of god
[1:19:25] that's a clean conscience that's a
[1:19:28] conscience looking at it
[1:19:30] with this conscience that yes i'm angry
[1:19:32] but my conscience tells me
[1:19:36] versus satan's explanation
[1:19:42] listen we give place to the devil
[1:19:46] when at the first motions of sin
[1:19:49] we're not pricked in our conscience
[1:19:52] the first evidence the first
[1:19:55] resurrecting of it
[1:19:57] when something we get angry and in our
[1:19:59] anger our faith
[1:20:00] disconnects from the word you're no
[1:20:03] longer rooted
[1:20:05] you're no longer founded you're no
[1:20:06] longer grounded and what happens
[1:20:09] is we come into a state of unanchored
[1:20:12] consciousness we're angry
[1:20:16] but where's our conscience
[1:20:19] we're upset we're hurt we're torn but
[1:20:22] where's the anchor
[1:20:24] where's the channel that's going to
[1:20:25] tether our consciousness to our soul
[1:20:27] it's going to take the conscience to do
[1:20:29] that
[1:20:30] how do something that grabs a hold of it
[1:20:33] so to be this is i think the scripture
[1:20:35] just beautifully is amplifying
[1:20:37] consciousness which is the anger but
[1:20:39] sinning not
[1:20:40] is rooted in our conscience so we ought
[1:20:44] not to give
[1:20:44] any place to the devil in our conscience
[1:20:48] the way that paul writes this he is
[1:20:50] drawn directly from psalms chapter 4
[1:20:52] verse 4
[1:20:52] stand in awe and sin not
[1:20:56] commune with your heart upon your bed
[1:20:59] and be still
[1:21:00] say love consider the matter deeply
[1:21:03] before you act stand in awe of the one
[1:21:06] who
[1:21:07] controls all things stand in awe of
[1:21:10] christ
[1:21:10] bring christ i love the song that was
[1:21:12] sung today it said bring
[1:21:14] christ then this is the thought that i
[1:21:15] even had here when it says stand in all
[1:21:17] bring christ to the center of your
[1:21:19] conscience
[1:21:21] if something has made you angry if
[1:21:23] someone has hurt you
[1:21:24] if a situation is desperate then stand
[1:21:26] in awe of him
[1:21:29] remember that he and his wisdom has
[1:21:31] allowed this child to come to pass
[1:21:33] and i'm going to see something a hurt or
[1:21:34] a fence happens here's my anger i want
[1:21:37] to take christ
[1:21:38] and put him in my conscience i want to
[1:21:40] put christ between me and the offense
[1:21:42] because i want to be able to look at the
[1:21:43] center i want to be a look at the
[1:21:44] offender
[1:21:45] and i want to hate the offense but i
[1:21:47] don't want to hate the offender
[1:21:49] because i don't want there to be
[1:21:50] bitterness and malice and strife and all
[1:21:52] these things to begin to grip my heart
[1:21:54] so i must stand in awe
[1:21:57] and sin not commune with your heart
[1:22:01] examine your conscience
[1:22:04] tune out emotion right
[1:22:08] tune out the consciousness because many
[1:22:11] times that's where the pain really is
[1:22:14] and look now at your conscience
[1:22:18] and then be willing to have the word
[1:22:21] wash it
[1:22:24] then be willing say lord i need to
[1:22:27] recalibrate
[1:22:29] my conscience i hurt lord and i can't
[1:22:33] change it
[1:22:34] i've been rejected and i can't change it
[1:22:37] i'm estranged and i can't change it
[1:22:40] and lord all those things are bad enough
[1:22:42] but now my conscience
[1:22:45] condemns me now my conscience
[1:22:48] haunts me and be willing to let it
[1:22:52] be washed
[1:22:55] brother braham said our spirit is clean
[1:22:57] it is fresh it is real
[1:22:59] it is sober and serious but nonetheless
[1:23:03] full of the joy of the lord
[1:23:05] the christian ought to be just as
[1:23:06] exuberant and full of his pleasure in
[1:23:07] the lord as the world is when it savors
[1:23:10] and delights in its pleasures
[1:23:12] both christians and the world are human
[1:23:14] both have emotions
[1:23:16] the difference is the christians
[1:23:17] conscience
[1:23:19] emotions are purely on the lord of glory
[1:23:21] and his love and i i'm the one that said
[1:23:23] conscience instead of heart but notice
[1:23:25] he has the hearts and emotions
[1:23:26] are purely on the lord of glory and his
[1:23:27] love while the world satisfies the flesh
[1:23:31] either with a seared conscience or an
[1:23:33] evil one
[1:23:36] or one that's defiled headed to evil
[1:23:38] eventually seared
[1:23:42] listen this is i i know i'm stating the
[1:23:44] obvious
[1:23:45] a clean conscience or clear conscience
[1:23:47] i'd like to maybe use that
[1:23:49] more particularly a clear conscience can
[1:23:52] support a person in just about any trial
[1:23:56] when your conscience is clear i have a
[1:23:59] clear conscience
[1:24:02] what what is it that really gets us all
[1:24:04] nervous when the boss calls us into the
[1:24:06] office
[1:24:09] it's your conscience
[1:24:12] and it's your conscience that'll bother
[1:24:13] you even if you're not conscious and
[1:24:15] aware of any reason why you
[1:24:17] ought to be bothered but it's just this
[1:24:20] syndrome it's in our conscience
[1:24:22] so a clear conscience can support the
[1:24:24] heart under any trial
[1:24:27] a clear conscience can be a refuge in a
[1:24:29] difficult time
[1:24:30] so what does satan want to do he wants
[1:24:32] to disturb your conscience
[1:24:34] he wants to disturb it through
[1:24:35] manipulation he wants to do it through
[1:24:37] sending data to your consciousness
[1:24:39] satan really at the end of the day may
[1:24:41] can't or he cannot
[1:24:42] ever get to your soul and what he wants
[1:24:45] to do then is manipulate your conscience
[1:24:47] and your guilt
[1:24:48] and your peace of mind through your
[1:24:50] consciousness
[1:24:55] and for a born-again believer
[1:24:59] the lack of joy is not the disturbance
[1:25:02] of your soul
[1:25:05] but it's the disturbance of your mind
[1:25:09] always remember that the lack of joy the
[1:25:12] lack of experiencing joy the lack of
[1:25:14] experiencing rest
[1:25:15] is not the state of your soul it's your
[1:25:18] state of mind amen
[1:25:21] and that's the only place the devil can
[1:25:22] work that's why it's where the greatest
[1:25:24] battle ever fought is
[1:25:26] raging right now
[1:25:32] do you mind if i go a little bit further
[1:25:34] okay thank you
[1:25:35] thank you bro john i picked picked
[1:25:38] wisely this morning
[1:25:41] [Music]
[1:25:43] i want to make reference to a statement
[1:25:46] i have the quotation
[1:25:47] on a couple slides a few slides
[1:25:50] there's many different examples we could
[1:25:52] use and i i
[1:25:54] just felt so directed to close with this
[1:25:56] statement
[1:25:58] and then come back to the church age
[1:25:59] book there in chapter two
[1:26:02] brother is talking about he's going to
[1:26:03] he's going to meet with the girl
[1:26:06] who had been a christian girl and had
[1:26:09] served the lord
[1:26:10] and then went away to college
[1:26:13] and then became insane
[1:26:17] and and he talks and he says she had
[1:26:20] this professor
[1:26:22] who got her questioning her belief in
[1:26:24] god
[1:26:25] and it led to this this mental state of
[1:26:28] mind
[1:26:28] this uh mentally unstableness
[1:26:31] instability
[1:26:33] and this is how brother brahm describes
[1:26:34] it now
[1:26:36] him being a psychiatrist this professor
[1:26:39] he swung the girl's mind
[1:26:42] until now she has become so evil and so
[1:26:45] bad
[1:26:46] so she won't even want to hear the name
[1:26:48] of jesus spoke in her presence
[1:26:51] and even her father and mother can't see
[1:26:53] her no more
[1:26:54] and she's lost her mind and this next
[1:26:58] week will go to the institution
[1:26:59] for shock treatment what are they trying
[1:27:03] to do
[1:27:03] shock something sense into her right
[1:27:07] bring her back to the right state of
[1:27:09] mind so saying that the death
[1:27:11] this professor through psychology
[1:27:15] and through words swung her mind it's
[1:27:17] her mind now
[1:27:18] that swung to a place where her
[1:27:20] conscience was so seared
[1:27:21] and her conscience was so hard she
[1:27:23] didn't even want to hear
[1:27:25] jesus christ mentioned and notice
[1:27:28] what he says the reason for the shock
[1:27:30] treatments are it's because
[1:27:32] that she turned her thoughts from christ
[1:27:36] she turned her thoughts from christ unto
[1:27:37] what that psychiatrist
[1:27:39] was moving her mind
[1:27:42] so don't read any further stop there
[1:27:45] brother brown is saying that when a girl
[1:27:47] went to college
[1:27:48] she believed in god but a professor used
[1:27:50] words in psychology
[1:27:52] to swing her mind from christ
[1:27:55] to something else and it caused her
[1:27:57] mental
[1:27:58] illness he says it was a psychiatrist
[1:28:02] moving her mind now notice what he says
[1:28:05] next
[1:28:06] and that's what we're here for this
[1:28:08] morning
[1:28:10] is to move your mind and you're thinking
[1:28:13] from the things of the world
[1:28:15] under the things of god which is eternal
[1:28:20] did you catch what he just said a lot of
[1:28:22] times we take
[1:28:23] that we take the preaching of the word
[1:28:25] now it's in the salts and the souls and
[1:28:26] the souls and the soul you just need to
[1:28:28] get the holy ghost you just need to get
[1:28:29] the holy ghost you see the word birth
[1:28:30] you should wear birth
[1:28:31] if it's not making any difference maybe
[1:28:32] you don't have the seed of god in you
[1:28:36] you've been hearing this preaching for
[1:28:37] all these years and you ain't been born
[1:28:38] again then you're probably serpent seed
[1:28:42] the word preached has first
[1:28:46] got to meet you in your mind
[1:28:50] the purpose of preaching the gospel do
[1:28:52] you realize that's why
[1:28:53] brother branham taught us how to witness
[1:28:55] that you'd start in something what are
[1:28:57] they familiar with what are they what do
[1:28:58] they want what do they do are they do
[1:28:59] they fish talk them about fishing
[1:29:02] why you don't go up to them and just
[1:29:03] punch them right in the spiritual gut
[1:29:05] you sinner dog
[1:29:07] come to jesus
[1:29:11] and then they reject you like man that
[1:29:14] person with serpent seed if i've ever
[1:29:16] met surprising
[1:29:17] you did nothing to put him in a place to
[1:29:19] receive the word of god
[1:29:21] the world today is plagued with
[1:29:22] complexes and fears and abuses and
[1:29:24] manipulations
[1:29:26] they really if they're if they if their
[1:29:28] conscience isn't seared yet they have a
[1:29:29] conscience right now that's telling them
[1:29:31] this movement isn't right
[1:29:32] but that movement isn't right this isn't
[1:29:34] true and that isn't true and i see
[1:29:36] problems but nobody has the answers
[1:29:38] and they either got to get to a place
[1:29:39] where they completely sell out through a
[1:29:40] seared conscience
[1:29:41] and then what happens when we come along
[1:29:43] we look no different than all the antis
[1:29:45] they've come up against
[1:29:48] we're just waving another flag it may
[1:29:50] not say trump it might say seven
[1:29:51] trumpets
[1:29:53] right and we're just as vitriol and
[1:29:56] in your face and dogmatic and rude and
[1:29:59] crass
[1:30:00] you guys just need god you bunch of
[1:30:02] blasphemers
[1:30:04] well that's not the god they want
[1:30:08] but the preaching of the word is to move
[1:30:12] your mind and your thinking from the
[1:30:13] things of the world
[1:30:14] under the things of god which are
[1:30:15] eternal notice what he says in the next
[1:30:18] statement
[1:30:19] and that's what preaching is for is to
[1:30:22] pervert
[1:30:23] thinking to a higher and better or
[1:30:25] convert
[1:30:27] right preaching of the word is to take
[1:30:30] your thinking to something higher and
[1:30:32] better
[1:30:32] into a place where christ is until you
[1:30:35] become converted
[1:30:37] then your mind reaches for those things
[1:30:39] which are above
[1:30:42] and in order for then our mind to then
[1:30:44] be in a place that it can reach for the
[1:30:45] things that are above
[1:30:46] there's got to be a preaching of the
[1:30:48] word that begins to wash
[1:30:50] our conscience and sprinkle our
[1:30:52] conscience
[1:30:53] and give us this feeling and sense of
[1:30:55] guilt and then in our right minds be
[1:30:57] able to look to calvary
[1:30:58] and say i i have a sense of something
[1:31:01] real i have a sense of something divine
[1:31:03] i have a sense of my own guilt and i
[1:31:05] have a sense that he has forgiveness
[1:31:07] that he's offered to me
[1:31:08] that's what brother brown begins to
[1:31:09] describe in some of these instances that
[1:31:11] the preaching of the word first
[1:31:13] has to drive out anything that's in
[1:31:15] someone's conscience
[1:31:16] and get it to align with the word of god
[1:31:18] in order to accept it
[1:31:20] into their soul and be converted
[1:31:24] i think that's powerful
[1:31:27] so brother branham says in just a little
[1:31:30] bit later in the chapter two of the
[1:31:31] church age book after he has said our
[1:31:32] spirit is clean and it is
[1:31:34] fresh and it is full the joy of the lord
[1:31:36] he said paul said the word come in power
[1:31:38] as well as voice
[1:31:40] the word preach actually demonstrated
[1:31:42] itself
[1:31:44] like a flaming cutting sword it went
[1:31:47] into the consciences
[1:31:49] of men and like a surgeon's knife
[1:31:53] that cut out the diseases and set the
[1:31:55] captives free
[1:31:57] does anybody need surgery this morning
[1:32:00] let's stand to our feet
[1:32:06] the word preached demonstrates itself
[1:32:14] by going into your conscience
[1:32:17] and like a surgeon's knife cutting out
[1:32:20] diseases
[1:32:22] and setting you free i want someone's
[1:32:25] conscience to be healed today
[1:32:28] that's what i'm standing here for there
[1:32:30] can be a healed conscience
[1:32:33] let the word of god the word preached
[1:32:35] has it been moving you today
[1:32:38] has it been entered into your conscience
[1:32:39] like a flaming sword
[1:32:41] and cutting out diseases and setting the
[1:32:44] captives free
[1:32:56] with our heads bowed
[1:33:10] isn't it remarkable that the word
[1:33:12] preached
[1:33:15] though it's intended for our soul
[1:33:18] god is so kind and caring
[1:33:22] that he's willing to first address our
[1:33:24] minds
[1:33:29] he's one to first cleanse our spirits
[1:33:36] to put us in the right frame of mind to
[1:33:38] accept truth
[1:33:42] and if he'll do that to save us he does
[1:33:44] it to keep us
[1:33:50] let him heal your conscience tonight
[1:33:52] today
[1:33:54] let him touch it
[1:33:58] as we saying give me clean hands
[1:34:02] give me a clean heart
[1:34:06] that if we're born again our soul is
[1:34:10] clean
[1:34:12] but if we're human it's our conscience
[1:34:16] that tries to condemn us it's our
[1:34:18] consciousness that can fight against our
[1:34:21] conscience
[1:34:23] let the word arise put christ on the
[1:34:26] battlefield today
[1:34:28] let's pray our heavenly father
[1:34:32] lord i
[1:34:35] want you to seal these things now
[1:34:40] in our hearts
[1:34:44] we give our minds completely to you lord

[1:34:55] make them all brand new
[1:34:59] the lord may not just be a renovation of
[1:35:01] my consciousness
[1:35:04] but maybe a total renovation of my
[1:35:06] conscience
[1:35:09] lord i feel that even if my conscience
[1:35:14] awareness and my conscious mind would be
[1:35:17] feeble and
[1:35:18] weak and agitated and angry
[1:35:21] my clean conscience could keep me
[1:35:25] from sinning give us a clear conscience

[1:35:34] weak lord and bolster it and strengthen
[1:35:36] it
[1:35:38] to be a sinner who's experienced a
[1:35:40] seared conscience that they'll be
[1:35:41] unsaved that have a
[1:35:42] evil conscience lord may you bring
[1:35:45] feeling back and swing their mind
[1:35:48] let them feel the waves of guilt lord
[1:35:52] and godly sorrow that leads one to
[1:35:54] repentance
[1:35:56] may they experience the sprinkling of an
[1:35:58] evil conscience
[1:36:00] to be washed and made pure
[1:36:03] lord to realize then that being purged
[1:36:06] the believer once purged the sinner
[1:36:08] once purged
[1:36:12] has no more desire for sin
[1:36:18] relates to the conscience lord
