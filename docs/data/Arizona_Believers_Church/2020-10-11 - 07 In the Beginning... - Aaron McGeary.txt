TRANSCRIPT
========================================
jeremiah chapter 10 verses 10 to 15 it says but the lord is the true god he is the living god and an everlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and nations shall not be able to abide his indignation now i'm reading this for some context um just to see how he's addressing the disobedient but then also identifying himself as the true and living god thus shall you say unto them the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens so now as we've been looking at genesis 1 1 we see that god is distinguishing himself from all other deities there's only one that's created the heavens and the earth there's only one creator he says he has made the earth by his power he hath established the world by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion when he uttereth his voice there's a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures every man is brutish in his knowledge every founder is confounded by graven image for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them so man can only create something false something without without life they are vanity and the work of heirs in the time of their visitation they shall perish i what a powerful powerful reading if we could just bow our heads in a word of prayer gracious heavenly father lord we're so happy to be gathered together today in your presence lord we realize that it's not the four walls that define the gathering nor is it the amenities within those walls and how nice the setup or arrangement may be but lord it's the character of the people that make the church beautiful lord is coming and gathering in your name that makes that makes the meeting worth it and lord we're grateful for that lord as we are very happy for the facility that we do have and we're very happy for the kindness that's been shown to us uh by this uh property lord we realize that it is your grace that has brought us here is your grace that keeps us lord that there's no other there's no other thing we're looking to other than the promise that you said you'd meet us here so now fathers we stand in your presence we pray that you'd come speak to our hearts through your word as we commit it to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you can be seated i'm wanting to continue on this subject of in the beginning and uh and just take a little bit further step into this and look at and we can start here by looking at genesis chapter chapter 1 verse 1 again and i'm just going to jump right into it kind of the the trajectory of where i had been in the prior and last service i just i'm wanting to back up a little bit realizing that maybe the direction we were going we've kind of established some things i think that are important here at the outset but i want you to back up and just revisit a few things here um at the beginning just a couple things at the beginning and just go down this path uh to share something with you in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and i want to begin to look at this word create and created and start thinking more deeply about what is what is he even assumed in the use of this word to say creation as we read in the beginning it says man is brutus in his knowledge it says every founder because man cannot create he found he con he shapes things he fashions things he's confounded by the graven image so even the image or the molten image that he graves is a falsehood to him it cannot speak back to him it's vanity it's a work of heirs and so when it speaks of creation this is something that's specific to god and virtually everywhere in the old testament where this is used it's only used for god this verb create is only used in conjunction with god there's three places i believe uh one in the book of joshua and then another two places in the book of samuel first samuel where the word is translated to cut but everywhere else where it's translated to create it's only used of god so this is something that speaks of a characteristic or an essential attribute of god and to create it's uh often the way this is used as it pertains to god as he just wasn't just making uh he was saying making something out of nothing that would be how some people would describe it to create is to begin with nothing and to make something out of nothing but it's more than just making something material and this is how i want us to begin to think more deeply about creation it's more than just making something tangible something visible or something material but it's god designing something with function that it's not just bringing something there's a blah there's just a mesh there but it has function and it has operation so when god created he just doesn't bring forth a mass or a material but god assigns a function to it he gives it a particular ability or function and so he's placing it in a role so when god creates there's there's an operation to the creation there's a function to the creation there's a position that he gives the creation and so this is an act and this is where i hope that you can just uh just purpose in your heart to pay close attention and just focus on on these things because they're all just really tightly compacted and connected together and i may not be creating the appropriate tension to hold your attention but it's just going to be very very focused and along these lines this is an act of god determining destiny when god begins to create this is an act of god assigning things and placing things and it's a divine decree that is designing and establishing things with a purpose so god's just not saying oh let's see what happens in throwing things out there but it's an act of god and as he acts he begins to give issue this divine decree and this decree is actually designing something and establishing that something for a purpose in proverbs chapter 3 verse 19. and i want you to focus on this wisdom and understanding the lord by his wisdom have founded the earth by understanding hath he established the heavens so this has given us an insight into what what attributes of god or what characteristics of god or and in play are operating when he begins to create the heavens and the earth his infinite knowledge it speaks of wisdom that founder of the earth it's his infinite knowledge it's his skill so his infinite knowledge and skill by wisdom by understanding he finds founds the earth he establishes the heavens his skill is manifested in the composition of the earth his skill is manifested in how that he the structure of the entire the economy of the stars things are placed in the heavens and it's declaring his wisdom it's declaring his knowledge and so it's by his wisdom he esta he's uh founded the earth by his understanding he established the heavens so he's establishing the order and the essence of all things so we're think we're wanting just to think more than just god created the heavens and the earth and then we move on we've already looked at this how that god tipped his showed his hand at the very beginning in the beginning god created the heavens bridegroom and the earth bride i mean he already he's already laying it out there so now we're thinking more deeply about creation that it's not just god saying throwing something out there and letting things bounce off of one another and misfire and some lining up and i mean they literally teach you at least in the college i went to and it was in texas so you would expect it to maybe be a little bit bible leaning but they just taught you it's hey we're here because of the lottery that things over billions of years mutated and it just misfired and had been mutating for billions and billions of years but then finally just the right combination matched up and you got another cell and then it took another billion years for that to mutate and it's always misfiring always mutating but then all of a sudden it just happened to line up again and there's some that believe that god may have just scattered matter out there and just watched it bounce off of one another and and scatter around and this is how we got to where we are today but this is something that god by his wisdom did this so he's establishing order and essence in his creation in the heavens he's directing their station we he read about and we hear brother brahm talk about how a clinker broke off that son he said stop there and god is writing his first bible and he's particular not yet not yet not yet there it wasn't just let it spin out into orbit and let it never stop but no he he had these uh he set the station of it then he set the motion of it he set the structure of it this is god writing a bible in the heavens and he's establishing order and he's establishing essence and he's establishing all these different things to his creation so creation implies divine wisdom we read in the beginning god created we cannot begin to affix our notions of baking we can't begin to fix our notions of building a house there's no way that we can actually begin to fully understand what it means we say god creates because it implies divine wisdom through which his divine will acts he acts according to his wisdom now there's a lot of times we don't act according to our wisdom why are you doing that why are you setting that up oh i want to do it well what's causing well i have skill i have designed uh uh chops you know i'm putting something together well why are you doing it it's fun i want to do it and there's no divine wisdom in it and when when it's finished what is it it's a ramp what are you gonna use that ramp for i'm gonna ride my bicycle as hard as i can and jump off this ramp have you thought about what might happen if you do that no no i just want to do it and thankfully there's a lot of people who've done it and they videoed it so we can just binge fail videos because man not in his wisdom built the ramp but just in his ability and so creation implies divine wisdom through which the divine will is accomplished or he acts so that this is what connects god's wisdom with his will and to his word because it says in hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so god's will is his word and god's will operates according to his divine wisdom so the wisdom is the word the will is the word these all three are connected together so when we begin to speak about wisdom and understanding we haven't somehow divorced that from the word but it's it's it's the one and the same god has a wisdom he has an understanding his knowledge his skill and he begins to create and that's his divine will now is being acted out it's his word and we've looked at how creation is an expression of the creator and so when some when god creates something expressing who he is and so creation is then an expression of god's wisdom creation is an expression of god's understanding and this is how i want to begin to place these words into your thinking today when god creates it's thought-driven it's not just reflex or instinct or impulse uh and it's not it it's although it would be passionate and though it would be um there would be things to it uh that would be driving him it's purposeful it's thought-driven and then it's also purpose-focused so he has a thought that he's been pondering there's something that's in his mind that that he's meditating on as the bible says in psalms my my my mind my heart is indicting a good matter that means i'm pondering i'm thinking about it i'm processing he says my tongue is as the pen of a ready writer this is this describes god that his heart is indicting a good matter it's he's pondering he's mulling over he's thinking about it it's expanding it's growing in his in his thoughts as he begins to think about it and so this is creation is an expression of god's wisdom and his understanding it's thought driven and then it's purpose focused god has a purpose in doing it it's not i have a thought i want to bring that thought into existence and then it's kind of like now what can i do with this and i can remember uh when i was a kid and i'm not i'm not an artist and i would draw some i mean i would just make a shape and what is that and i'd try to make it into something because i wasn't an artist that could conceptualize something and then begin to put it on piece of paper i would just kind of let my hand jerk around until i was like oh that's kind of a neat shape i'll add this and add that and like yeah i meant to draw that that's what i had in my mind no that's just my my hand moving across a piece of paper but you take someone who's an artist they begin to put something forth they're purpose-focused this has a particular design to it this is going to have a particular place in this overall drawing or whatever that's being done god here is not only thought-driven but he's purpose-focused as he brings creation into existence and it's important to understand that as it says he fi he has founded the earth i want to keep saying he found or he finds it but that's not exactly what uh what is being expressed he founded the earth by wisdom he established the heavens by understanding so as god begins to act it's knowledge based god knows when god put something forth he's not over there going okay i wonder what this is going to do he knows exactly and so as he is it is thought driven purpose focused and knowledge based he can he he designs it in a way to fit his will he decided in a way to accomplish his purpose his overall objective and so i began to ponder this last week as i was getting ready for this sunday and it's elohim the architect and and not only is the idea guy or the visionary or the one that the artist or the one that could have the concept in his mind but he's also the architect who can put it out there and make sense of it and there's many there's there's times i say many boy i may be way overstating that for some of us there's times in people's lives where maybe they have a concept or an idea and they kind of jot it down or they express it to somebody and they say well what do you want your website to look like well i was thinking this i was thinking that well just kind of do a mock-up for me and you just put stuff out there then you take a an architect you take an artist you take a designer graphic designer and they take all your mumbo jumbo and your words and your vision and all your thoughts and then they they actually take what you're thinking about and they put it into something a concept you're like that's that's exactly what i was thinking that's exactly what i had in mind and so god is not just the idea guy but he's actually the architect he is he's not only the visionary the entrepreneur the one that has a great idea but now as the architect and the engineer he can begin to lay this out and put the pieces into place and he's the one that'll see it all the way through he doesn't need to bring in another builder he's the engine he's the thought guy he's the engineer he's the architect he's the builder he's the finisher the author and the finisher of the creation and so in his mind he had a plan and this is a language that's familiar to us our term familiar to us a masterpiece in his mind he had a masterpiece and so as god begins to create it is his voice that is declaring his will and that is declaring his pleasure as he begins to think and he begins to speak his voice is declaring what's in his heart what's in his mind and is declaring his desire and his pleasure the bible says by wisdom he's made the heavens to him to him that by wisdom made the heavens for his mercy endureth forever you'll find this scripture frequently i expressed well we'll get there eventually there we go you'll find this expressed often in a number of places that by his wisdom he fashioned the world by his wisdom he fashioned creation and wisdom it speaks of understanding skill it actually speaks of skill so you say god has skills the greatest of all and we just use a language to try to help us to understand because we've got skills well then god's got the better skills and but this is he's a god that is skilled wisdom speaks of discernment our wisdom speaks of discretion it speaks of knowledge so by his discretion so god was discretionary how he created he was very purposeful with each step that's why you you can look at god's creation and and i kind of varied away from this in my notes uh just so that i wouldn't get um too lost in this path but i'm going to read a statement here in a moment from power of transformation and god uses the language to say god was above it all and he let it evolute on up to himself so you look in creation and you could say oh we see evolution and science has seen the fingerprints of god but had doesn't have doesn't have the the file to identify who he is but they see the evolution single cell organism and how things are connected and they evolve and it's evolving all up because god is above it all letting it evolute up so with each station god is purposeful as he creates because he has discretion there's knowledge to his design but wisdom also speaks of intelligence and this may be a phrase i'm wanting to just anchor in our minds today as we go forward in this to him that by intelligence made the heavens divine intelligence by his knowledge his understanding his discernment his discretion his skill he made the heavens it was an intelligence a divine intelligence that created the heavens and the earth now in the message power of transformation he says it was god the great master of all intelligence and he had in his mind what he wanted to do just like when the man that built this trailer and so he's making he's making reference to the trailer park i believe it was in prescott and he and he's saying the man that built this trailer when you brethren here that designed this park how you would make it it was in your mind and you kept working that vision out now that's how a man ought to operate if he's going to build something he's going to as the bible even says what if you're gonna build something you count the materials you count the cost you whether you find out whether you have the resources and the land and and the labor to put something together so you don't just start something without having first in your mind conceptualized resources labor opportunity all those things he says well you brother when you designed the park you had it in your mind and you kept working that vision out that's the way god did about the world he worked it was in his mind so creation is god's eternal thoughts that are now unfolding and god is designing something he says just like you brothers who designed this park it's first in your mind and so god is a designer god is the master of all intelligence and so he's using his his intelligence now to create god has this in his mind i'm wanting to create the world and he's using his intelligence the master of all intelligence now begins to design creation he has a vision in doing so and in the in the sumerian church age this is a chapter four now just follow me as we read through this he says the eternal thoughts of god so now he gets us thinking about god's thought god's thoughts let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal and then he says if you can see this you will see many things now that's powerful now he's saying if you can see this you can see many things this has so much depth maybe in some ways i'm just going to amplify this statement for the rest of the day and make it very rest of the day you've been put on notice rest of the service ah he says if you can see this you will see many things so make this personal are the thoughts of god eternal if you can see the answer you can see many things she says god is unchangeable in both essence and behavior oh i love that god is unchangeable in his essence and in his actions god is unchangeable in his his very character and he's therefore unchangeable in how he acts his behavior because your behavior is aligned with character god is not a hypocrite we have studied that and proven that already god is infinite in his abilities so therefore he as god must be omniscient so it that's a very um interesting connection brother branham connects his infinite abilities with his infinite knowledge so he with his infinite knowledge comes infinite skill and so he says we've already proved that already in this church age but god is infinite in his abilities and therefore he is omniscient he says if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he's not omniscient the best way we could say is that sometime the best we can say is that sometimes he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient so god is omniscient he's all-knowing and that he's and even though it may look like god learns he does not learn although it may look like god takes counsel and he responds to to to mankind in a way to where it looks as if he's been apprised of new information therefore he's changing his behavior oh i'm going to destroy him all moses is like no no don't do it he stands in the gap god says okay never mind i'm going to change my mind no god did not know that moses was going to do that and was surprised god god knows all things and god acts even to bring things out of us not for his benefit do you realize the test isn't so that god knows where you are the test is so that you find out where you are so god administers the test sometimes listen not as retribution not as payment not as reprimand not as correction but he he gives a test so that you can understand where you are and many times we're ungrateful for the test but we pass it and god's like i just wanted you to know you had it in you and we're lamenting the test we're all upset i gotta take this test oh my goodness i gotta take this test do i sound like you guys yet why do i have to take this quiz why do i have to take this test well our sc our teachers in the natural need to know where we're at but our teacher in the supernatural knows exactly where we're at and he's trying to bring something out of us and the test is assurance to us that we're in his hand not to him he won't lose you he knows exactly where you are so he says this now he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has all has all because all his thoughts he has always i'm going to have a conversation with brother level when i get a chance it can be pretty worthy because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is god thus the thoughts of god are eternal they are real if you can see this you will see many things if you can see this you will see many things am i the only one getting goosebumps this is powerful i've been studying on this for for months now and it just keeps getting deeper and deeper than i begin to preach i'm like i was in the kiddie pool when i was studying because you bring me out into deeper waters and he's saying look if you can see this you will see many things the thoughts of god are eternal they are real oh god let me see that let me really understand that and comprehend that he says they are not simply like a man with the blueprint he has drawn up which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and a part of god our thoughts can be fleeting we can have a thought and won't be able to get it back i can't tell you how many times i'm right in the middle of a sentence and my mind leaves and i walk away and elizabeth's like are you going to finish that you're going to finish that statement i'm like where was it what was i saying our thoughts can just immediately be interrupted and it's on pause you can't remember what was i saying what was i talking about and we can't even find our way back to that god's thoughts aren't like that you could even put ours you could even describe man in such a way to where he's not a thought generator he's a thought receptor and brother tim dodd taught on that one time at the men's meeting how that we're not uh in essence thought generators were thought receptors so we receive thoughts but god is a thought generator god is the originator of thinking god's the originator of intelligence god's the originator wisdom and knowledge and understanding and his thoughts are eternal and they are real they're not like those guys who built the park and prescott where they said we got an idea we can level the land here and got blueprints laid out and you look at the blueprints and you can begin to understand that's what it might be that's what it might be but it's not real until you put up the structures until they're finished out god's not like that his thoughts already have in some dimension in some quality substance and form because he says they're not like a man with this blueprint they'll one day become substance and form but they are already real have some divine quality divine substance and are already eternal therefore has divine it's in essence it is they are divine and he says a part of god you cannot separate the thoughts of god from god my this is wonderful jeremiah chapter 10 verses 12 to 13. now we read verses 10 and 11 and he's talking about the gods who have not made the heavens and the earth were will perish now what distinguishes those gods who cannot create from the god who can create he says he hath made the earth by his power and he has established the world by his wisdom and have stretched out the heavens by his discretion those are very uh beautiful words god's power and wisdom are manifested in his creating and establishing the order of all things he's made the earth by his power then he's established the world by his wisdom stretched out the heavens by his discretion so where they are where the stars are where the galaxies are wherever it's his discretion why is pluto where it is god's discretion why does haley's comment come around every so often however many years it is sorry i don't have i don't have that memorized 800 something years i don't know 78 years thank you john that's why i have him on the front row he's supposed to be my data guy i say oh okay brother john how many years does haley's comment come around it's time perfectly isn't it amazing whenever we have an eclipse they'll say you're not going to have one like this for another 378 days 12 hours and 30 seconds because they know that's exactly what it's going to be and they can tell you the best place to be on earth to see it you need to be in topeka kansas at 1 32 p.m on october 12th because that's going to be the peak because it god with at his discretion lined all these things up there's a power that holds them there there's a discretion that's put them there and mankind is science is in all by the magnitude of it and they become more in all of their the fact that they discovered it then the reality of the power that did it how could chance do this how could something of this magnitude not be coming from something that used discretion to even look at the moon and science could tell you man if that moon was this far out of this way or this far that way we wouldn't even have a habitable earth what does it believe brother jason watkins one time preached a sermon like this zone that the earth is in if it varied every so slightly you would not have life but yet here we are because god used his discretion to place the earth in just the right zone with all the other planets in their rotations and in their place every star every planet everything in this galaxy has was part of god's discretion because he says this is what it'll take for life to come and to be sustained he made the earth by his power he established the world by his wisdom stretched out the heavens by his discretion when he uttereth his voice there's a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth you can even see this as being descriptive of a creation itself he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures he utters his voice his voice declares his will it declares his intent it's now an expression of this power it's an expression of this wisdom it's an expression of his discretion and as he used his power in wisdom and he stretched out stretches out the heavens by his discretion this this is another key thing we talked we've mentioned intelligence creation has it's thought driven it's purpose focused it's knowledge based you have elohim the architect and it's it's there's an intelligence to it these are things i'm wanting you just to grab a hold of there's an intelligence to it and this intelligence these thoughts that he generates are real and they are eternal they have eternal substance eternal qualities they're a part of god now he makes earth by his power he establishes the world by his wisdom he's stretching out the heavens by his discretion and he brings these things out of his treasures out of his storehouse god brings them forth when as before you wouldn't have seen them or known them what i want you to see now is that god is establishing a track that is god begins to create there there's it's not an in many unknown variables there's not alternative realities there's not these parallel dimensions that if this would have happened this is what would take place and if that would have happened this would have taken place and so god actually has billions of monitors saying well this is oh this is the life if brother aaron hadn't gone to law school oh and this is the life if he never got married no god god sets things on a track i want you to think about that there's a track he establishes the path and he does this even the language of the proverb says he puts the the stars and the suns and the moon in their circuits so when we look in the heavens they have a rotational path they have a uh they they have a um they have these uh very clear patterns and paths that they follow i had to take a drink just remember the word orbit there's an orbit to it it's almost as if it's a predetermined path and you know where it's going to be and so god then he's telling us something in his creation he sets tracks he sets trajectory he sets a path so god is establishing by power by wisdom by discretion the trail that this creation would follow he determines it he can take something to go and just let it spin out and he's determined that he'll let it spin until it reaches the destination that he wants it to be and he says stop and he determines its path that he takes something and if boy if you could just put yourself in this god establishes establishes everything with weight with gravity with force with power with characteristics with essence and then he places you in this universe he places you inside of this creation and he sets it all in motion he says it's going to have a track and it's going to follow this path and what it was in the beginning i have a path that it's going to follow and i know exactly where it's going to be in the end because he's established the path he's put the power in it he's put the wisdom in it he stretched it out by his discretion god has established a trail he's established a path that creation will follow according to his own determinant counsel and will it's his power and wisdom that create the heavens and the earth and his power and wisdom are manifested in his divine order and use how he uses all things how he arranges them and uses them first corinthians chapter 1 verse 24. he made the earth by his power he established the world by his wisdom but unto them which are called paul talked about the gospel that is preached he preaches jesus christ and there's some that think it's this some that think it's that but in the context of this he's declaring who he's preaching but notice the characteristics that he assigns christ who he preaches unto them which are called both jews in greek christ the power of god and the wisdom of god so christ is the power of god and he is the wisdom of god so what he's setting forth now if we take this principle that out of context remains true if you just if we disregarded the context within which paul is preaching it this principle stands true christ is the power of god christ is the wisdom of god and we referenced last week or the week before brother man says when you read in the beginning god created he says there is christ so he made the earth by his power he established the world by his wisdom to him by that by wisdom made the heavens the lord by wisdom founded the earth by understanding he established the heavens and now paul says christ is the wisdom of god christ is the power of god so he hath made the earth by christ he has established the world by christ he stretched out the heavens by christ because in the beginning when you read god created there is christ that's the revelation that john has john 1 1 in the beginning was the word right it's christ the logos that came out of god it is an expression of god and this is then go in the beginning is the word logos it's the thought it's the intelligence of god so god's intelligence god's person made expressed in the logos god god is manifested in christ he hath made the earth by his power he has established the world by his wisdom it's represented in christ who is the power and wisdom of god so in the beginning was the word there's christ in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth there's christ can we see that now see do you like that little icon there it tells you it's in the bible you never know who's visiting and so genesis chapter 1 verse 27 this is where i hope to make a turn and begin to hopefully i pick up a little bit more pace you need to pull harder the harder you pull the faster i preach genesis chapter 1 verse 27 so god created now if he creates what is an expression of intelligence wisdom power knowledge skill understanding discretion so god's not just going to create man without using wisdom and skill he's not going to do it without being thought driven and purpose focused and knowledge based and so this is something god the master of all intelligence is now bringing forth man so god created man and he uses his own image so god when he created man his template is his own image in the image of god created he him so we can say definitively according to scripture without any ambiguity that man was created with discretion skill and understanding god as he created was using his wisdom his skill his understanding his knowledge his intelligence to make man in his own image this was a god had a purpose in doing so so he makes man in his own image he creates him male and female excuse me he creates him in his image creating him and he says in male and female created he them now do we cannot read this scripture to imply that on one hand he made him in god's image but in the other he made him male and female that the scripture is not making this dichotomy within man then in one hand he has this godly divine attributes and he's representative of deity but then he has this other part where he makes a male and female and it's somehow some kind of separate creation in this instance something less something humanity-based but he's actually saying he made man in the image of god and being in the image of god there was a representation or designation of both male and female in the man listen because god as a he's not this egomaniac he's not a narcissist we god in the beginning when he had thoughts it wasn't just all about himself me me me me me me when you have a language for someone else it would only be i i but the i am had something else in there the i am had thoughts of someone else something else so if this is god now when he says he created him in his own image and the image of god created him male and female created them then there's a representation of god that is male and female and then brother branham says in marriage and divorce god has male and female now go back to and read this in the context of marriage and divorce brother branham and this is where i i'm i'm i'm not going to be able to finish the sermon this morning and i'm hopeful that we can i'll pick it back up next sunday morning and and maybe some of these details we can bring out and greater clarity brother when he preaches marriage and divorce he's bringing a very a very rich a very even difficult revelation where he's shown you what the woman was in the beginning and how the god made her by his own design in a particular way to fulfill his purpose and so as he's talking about male and female and the woman how she came out of man she's not part of the original creation he makes this statement and and if it feels like i'm taking it out of context you can find it in the table or the message hub and look this up he says god has male and female and when he says it he's wanting you to understand that he does have that even if you see the woman as a perversion or even if you see the woman playing the part of a harlot even if you see this the role that she played in the fall of mankind we can't associate that part with his part he says god has male and female he's assigning this these designations to the eternal god amen elohim the architect was not just male but he also has representation male and female and i believe this is important for us to understand this because we see christ as as being one with the father and we see the expression of the son and we we he is so one with the father that when you've seen me you've seen the father and that god has oneness with his son and we see the the son father son and the language and the attributes of the oneness and we can get in our mind this that god in his oneness now is the invisible god now made manifest in his son there's the godhead there's the fullness of the godhead bodily and this is what we look at and it's male and distinction male and designation and it's all christ who is in the image of the invisible god and now we as peons we as humans we as wretched sinners now somehow have to plead to the mercy of this one that he would not cast us into hell and when he has not cast us into hell oh we have this privilege and this benefit of judgment being stayed for all eternity because he had mercy on us once we cried unto him for salvation i know there might be some that there's there's a language we're using there that expresses some truth if you if you don't see this you won't see everything but if you can see this you will see many things right if you can see that his thoughts are eternal and they are real if you can see that you will see many things so there is a hidden designation of god as it begins to create there is another part of his power and wisdom it says christ is the power of god christ is the wisdom of god so he hath made the earth by christ he's established the world by christ he stretched out the heavens by christ because christ is the power and the wisdom of god but there's a hidden designation of christ there's a there's another part or unfolding another fold of this power and wisdom brother brandon makes this statement and knoweth it not in the beginning of creation of god in the beginning of the creation of god when god began to create and bring you into existence so when god began to create he was bringing you into existence he said well brother aaron i believe according to science that the world is 6.9 billion years old and i didn't come to be in the except in the last 26 years so how was it i was being brought into existence when that began is because god had intelligence god had purpose god had a design and so he began to bring you into existence from the very moment he came into a being the very moment that god became an object of worship from the very time that the i am formed himself into the logos and became christ when he began to bring you into existence he says you started back there as a seed and worked down to where you are now and then you were all in christ then when christ died he died to redeem all of you and you are a part of this word so now when we look at christ we can't look at him as separate from you who are in christ you cannot look at him as a separate entity a separate person that you do not have fellowship with continuity with uh uh uh inheritance with oneness with the bible uses a language for us to be so tied to him and connected with him that we would never put ourselves in one category in him in another he's saying that when creation began you had your genesis then you begin to come into identity you begin to come into expression because you were in christ who is the wisdom and power of god you were in christ at that time he says you are part of this word now brother branham says in the beginning was the word according john 1 and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt dwelt among us he goes may i break it down yes you may i'm never going to say no to that brother brandon please as a matter of fact please i wish he said this more often may i break it down for you and and the music stops and he's going to break it down for you in the beginning was the eternal he wasn't even god god our english word god is an object of worship but he he there was nothing to worship him he's breaking it down now because all you have is elohim the eternal one he's not even god as an object of worship so now he says he was just eternal in him was attributes and so now i'm going to skip some and i put the uh that there just so you understand that i'm going to i'm going to skip a portion of this in other words in him was his thoughts just thoughts that's his attributes so he's eternal and he has attributes and these attributes are his thoughts then his word and a thought expressed is a word in the beginning was the word before it was even expressed it was a thought attributes in his thinking he was to be god so you go all the way back you have god dwelling along with his thoughts those thoughts are attributes once they're spoken it becomes word he said i'm breaking this down in the beginning was the word and they originally were thoughts in him he was to be god so he says probably probably created the angels first then he was worshiped he was god and then in him was attributes to be father to be son be savior nothing lost something had to be lost so there had to be a way made for that now do you understand how purposeful he was with creation because there's a paradox to it let's just all admit it god creates a perfect eden and then he takes the woman and just puts her in a little bit different position so that she can be tempted and fall and we've said it a number of times already god was not frustrated as if he was caught by surprise when it happened he wanted to manifest all his attributes so he he had to be there had to be someone lost for that to happen to be healer there was nothing sick so he had to have something had to get sick so he could heal it it's only displaying his attributes so then god had a path god had a plan so that all of his attributes could be expressed he says and now remember so now god has attributes of healer father savior redeemer but now this is just not attributes of god that are disconnected from you he says and now remember if you ever did or ever will have eternal life you had it with him then you had it with him then see you had it with him because jesus came and jesus was the redeemer to redeem anything is bring it back from where it fallen from or went from redeem it bring it back so the the very m the very use of the word redemption implies some prior state some prior position some prior quality redeemings to bring it back and you the way you look who you are who you who your name what your name is that was god's thinking before the foundation of the world and jesus came not to save the whole thing he wanted to but he come to redeem bring back them that was in his thoughts before the beginning if you can see this you will see many things he doesn't even say you can if you can see this you will see many things just like jesus told him he says if thou believe is this then you'll see greater things you really believe this is of god you shall see greater things if you can see this you will see many things so redemption is to bring back that which was lost so he says jesus came not to save the whole thing whole cosmos the whole record of the wheat plant he wanted to but he came to redeem to redeem back those that were in god's thoughts before the beginning and so this is this is what has just been reverberating over in my mind if you think by the end you just keep you keep uh you just keep treading the same ground we have to stop thinking the wrong way and we have to stop thinking in the realm of chance in the realm of coincidence brother luke told me lucas told me this morning he says you know like two years ago he went on a like just a buying binge my words where he bought all sorts of technology and things and it's just been collecting dust until we needed it so you go back two years ago why did he have an inkling to buy tripod that nice you're gonna have need for it one day and so it's important for us to realize god's the master of all intelligence god's the architect and engineer of your life even if you seem to get a little bit out of step god knows he can use that oh i thank god he can use my stubbornness he can use my waywardness he could use all of my doubt because god as a great designer as the great architect no if i was going too far he'd say stop why he kept me within a certain pound he kept me in his grace as we've been preaching on wednesday night the man fell from jerusalem on his way to jericho but god knows how to use a gang of thieves to stop you before you get to jericho that's not your destiny so we have to stop thinking outside of the realm of chance and coincidence that's why he says i use all things that's right but but i did this all things but i did that all things he works all things together for the good to the called according to what his purpose so let's get out of the realm of coincidence happenstance chance and let's just surrender to his purpose yield just yield to his design whatever your design is lord i'm at your mercy put me on your will lord turn me around lord if you see anything just water it get those strains out if you have to break me break me down because you're going to making something he's making as the song says he'll make something good out of dust how because he's the great master of all intelligence romans 9 11 he says this notice i'm just wanting to use these scriptures to get us thinking to surrender to his purpose he chose jacob rejected esau that the purpose of god according to election might stand so the purpose of god is according to election god be an omniscient god being a knowledge based this is something that god in his mind the purpose of god is according to election or election works to serve his purpose to fulfill his purpose ii timothy 1 9 who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace so we are saved and called our calling is a holy calling but it's not according to what you did since you were born anything you've done in the last 36 years nothing you've done in the last 12 years it's not anything you've done but it's according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world begin the phrase there is in eternity so you received it in christ in eternity before there was time you had received a holy calling according to his purpose before there was creation you were in christ and received the holy calling christ is the power of god christ is the wisdom of god you are a part of that christ you receive something in christ before the foundation of the world in ephesians 1 4 according he have chosen us in him when were we chosen before the foundational world where in christ so when you see christ you have to see yourself i started searching through the message surely brother branham said somewhere that if you have to see christ in every verse you have to see yourself in every verse right it tells a story about put put my name in there and you read it and you put your name in there this is this is something that we are that we we can accept now to see we were in christ therefore if a scripture speaks of christ it speaks of me brother adam before he preaches christ is a mystery god revealed he's referring to what he's going to preach in a sermon prior to it and he says the threefold purpose of god's great plan since before the foundation of the world jesus said what he wants to preach on the threefold purpose of god's great plan since before the foundation of the world so god had a great plan and it had three folds when did he have this plan before the foundational world not after the woman fell in sin he didn't say i'm glad i had a plan b no he had a threefold plan before the foundation of the world and brother branson says i want to bring it down to today the threefold plan of god the plan so really if if god needed a trademark he would have trademarked the process before the 76ers did or embed or whoever it was that trademarked it he had a process before we even had a language for it he had a plan the threefold purpose of god's great plan his great plan was initiated by his thoughts and his thinking this master of all intelligence had a three-fold plan so now in in christ is the mystery god revealed he says notice god has had a threefold purpose in this great mystery secret so great mystery secret has three a threefold purpose or there's a three three folds that fulfill god's purpose god in his great mystery secret that he had before the world began he got a threefold purpose in it so there's there's a purpose that has three folds or there's a three purposes that are ultimately going to reveal his great secret or bring it to pass or manifest it so god has a threefold purpose we're very familiar with those scriptures and the scriptures he uses of that sermon romans chapter 16 verses 25 to 27. and if i can i just go real fast and you can go back later and you can just do it on slower speed so i can finish now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world begin so now there's a power to establish he's preaching jesus christ and by preaching jesus christ he's bringing a revelation of the mystery that had been secret since the world began so though you had thousands of years of creation and old testament prophets and sages and characters of the old testament they were all giving glimpse or foreshadowing who christ because when christ came now the mystery of god is being revealed the mystery god was used in type and symbol and and different foreshadowings but now christ is the manifestation of the secret which had been kept since he formed himself into logos since he said let there be it had all been come into this place that when christ was made manifest you could see that the first fold of god's threefold purpose is coming into being so he says but now is made manifest why because jesus christ the first fold of that purpose had come and by scripture the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith to god only wise or to the only wise god be glory through jesus christ forever amen paul is established so beautifully through scripture that jesus christ is the firstfold manifestation of the threefold purpose of god and it's when does it come it comes it to us in the middle of the book why because god hides these things uh and and next sunday lord willing and maybe i'll just bring it into view now satan was watching and and was watching trying to guess and you can see that satan had some idea of god's plan because where he intersects and where he attacks and the message future home he says now in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the three stages it was attribute first was in god and he thought of himself as a being human and that transmitted him down to be jesus so in these stages god had a thought of him being human and then that transmitted not in adam but in jesus adam was a living soul christ is a quickening spirit now there's a difference then and so in christ do we see the the godhead bodily in christ is the fullness of god dwelling so he says and so so now he's unfolding himself to jesus he says that now if you'll ever be there wherever there is eternity in him in the body of christ in the rapture sitting with christ judging at white throne in the new jerusalem if you'll ever be there you was with him then for there's only one form of eternal life that's god and you had to be a part of god at the beginning not what you chose down here he chose you oh god help us if we ever let that become a bad taste in our mouth if we ever want to pick that up and have a choice and ever take the grace out and make it law you better do this you better do that no you're you're ordained to it you're elected to it i don't believe that we should ever be afraid of preaching president predestination properly and the results be that the bride is going to live lasciviously i'm predestined it can't be lost sorry honey but i'm partying tonight that the bride doesn't act that way you don't have to be afraid of of of ultimately that bride that her disdaining the grace of god her using predestination as an excuse to live below her privileges yes people carnally without a birth use it all day long to justify their trajectory but listen that can't change one's election you didn't choose them here he says he chose you now and who is this melchizedek and he says we could see here and who is this melchizedek he says the whole plan of your whole life he talks about your track and your plan he says now we find him at the beginning his attributes and now you were with him then and i didn't i didn't use any highlights or underlining or red letter or anything on this to make any other emphasis because i'm providing this here to you so you could read along just as an aide to see this and i put a little picture brother branham down there just so you knew these weren't my thoughts but these are quotes because you never know who's visiting and he says now this is a powerful statement then is when the book of life comes into view we find him at the beginning and he says at the beginning you were in him and so in the beginning he says then is when the book of life comes into view so hold that in your mind the book of life coming into view now we read over here in revelation the 13th chapter in the eighth verse that that beast hold that thought thought to the beast that comes upon the earth in the last days will deceive all these people on the earth whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation what he says think of it so the beast in the beginning deceived the woman then you come from genesis chapter 3 all the way to revelations chapter 13 and the beast in the end is deceiving again but he only has an effect on those who don't have their name in the lamb's book of life the record of the lamb's life he says think of it now catch the language here before jesus was ever born 4 000 years before he came on the earth and several thousand years before you come on the earth jesus in god's mind died for the sins of the world and the book of life was made and your name was put on that book of life before the foundation of the world that's the bible truth see your name was ordained of god placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world you were there in his attributes his attributes are thoughts his thoughts are real his thoughts are eternal right if you can see this you will see many things the book of life is coming into view at the beginning so read this scripture with a little bit more understanding of revelation psalms 139 14-17 i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth our language to describe the earth as the place where there would be conception where there would be a place that something would begin to grow he says that when i was curiously wrought my substance was not hid even though i was made in secret you knew me you understood me verse 16 thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect not fully made manifest and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious are thy thoughts unto me oh god how great is the sum of them the completion of them the fulfillment of them now you read this as a writer a psalmist is writing about his relationship with god and being known of him and how he's rod and secret and and he was conceived this way and his substance was not hid my bones my skin my shape my eyes all those things but brother branham says god knew you who you are you what your name was the way you looked it was in his thinking before before the foundation of the world but now i want to read it just a little bit differently and read it as the bride i will praise thee we will praise you for we are fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous for thy works and that our soul knoweth right well now the bride's speaking my substance was not hid from you when i was made in secret curiously wrought in the lost parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect and in thy book the bride saying oh my members were written oh no wonder you can say i all that my father have given me will come and i will not lose one why because all my members all the members of this bride are written in the book which in continuance were fashioned through age after age member after member coming forth when as yet there was none of them but here they are how precious are thy thoughts unto me your bride oh god how great is the sum of your thoughts brother braham took the scripture in the church book he says the idea and knowledge that the thought this is what it expresses it expresses the idea and knowledge that the thought was there in his mind and that thought was eternal and had to be expressed that's what the scripture sets forth he had you in his thinking as an eternal attribute and it had to be expressed and he said in all thy book in thy book all my members are written and brother branham says the book of life begins to come into view when god begins to create why because he's bringing you into existence the lamb's book of life now brother braham says in the first seal and the members of his bride their names were put in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world in thy book all my members were written even before they came on earth every member of this bride god knew who would be here the very language multiply and replenish the earth doesn't imply just stack them up like core would see how many you can fit it means fill it up to my designated point complete it why because god knew how many right so he says all the members of the bride their names are put in the land's book of life before the foundation of the world but it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed whose names were in there all about it it's been sealed up but now it's being revealed that means the book is open and it's revealing the members it's revealing what god knew when you were curiously wrong in the depths of the earth it's revealing that god knew you before there was one speck of star dust now it's being revealed whose names are in the book all about it he comes back later on that week they're asking him questions and he says the book holds the mystery and the book is only unfolding it now the book held the mystery of whose names are in there but it's only been folding until now or is now it only began to unfold until now it had not been unfolded before the book holds the mystery the book is not only unfolding it now not each one's name in the next paragraph he says it's not arm and neville it's not calling the name he says but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names why because it's a revelation you've heard you heard your name and it didn't it didn't have to say brother jeff but you heard your name it didn't have to declare it because anybody would say well my goodness he called his name but he didn't call mine it's a revelation and because it's revelation there's still a mysterious element that remains despite the revelation because it's still a mystery i don't have to hear your name called but you've got to hear your name called he says that's what's happening now now is being revealed whose names are in the book the book is only unfolding now the mystery of the book is being unfolded while the names are being called so it's not until the mystery is unfolding not until the revelation of the mystery is given that names can be called there's a lot there a whole lot there what it means for a name to be called i don't know what happened but i accidentally skipped a quote and things that are to be he says your birth here now because we're trying to and these this is something i'll just be honest these statements here ones i've always wrestled with and so they just clicked to me it clicked together this past week like now i have a i've come to a piece as to what brother brown means when he says your birth here was pre-planned and how the even your natural conception is more of a miracle than the immaculate conception amen because god in the beginning had you in mind and used his discretion and that's how he stretched out the stars which you are the stars of god and he determined where you would be in this expanse your name your shape your eyes so god had to be sure right if he knew it then then it had to be a particular way he says your birth here was pre-planned i guess you believe that everyone knows everyone knows that our birth was pre-planned i feel like he had me in mind when he said that because i was going is it really how can that be he said did you know that your being here never originated just at a myth or a thought now remember i'm speaking to the bride in thy book all thy members were written speaking specifically to the lamb's book of life god by foreknowledge knows everyone that's going to be in the book of life the record of the wheat plant but i think there's brother man's identifying something very particular to the elect did you know that your being here never originated just as a myth or a thought everything was all pre-planned by god before the foundation of the world that you would be here the infinite god knew and to be infinite he had to know every flea that would ever be in the earth and how many times it bats its eye that's infinite our little minds cannot fathom what infinite means and that's my problem with it perhaps he says that infinite god he know knew all things therefore there's nothing out of cater he knew what you would do he knew how hard your life would be he knew how what the seed that would be bruised he knew meanders he knew ups and downs he knew just what kind of family strain you would be a part of but he's like i'll use all of it for my great symphony i'll use all of it now he says i have heard but now i see there's nothing out of cater tell yourself that write it down there's nothing out of cater i want to get in cater if i feel like it's that lord i want to get into your cadence i want to get into your rhythm he says only can rain raise the seed is this if the seeds already there and as you were a germ first in your father he didn't know you yet you were in your father but through a betting ground of your mother you were made manifest in his likeness then he could talk to you now we have to think now in the spiritual because brother brown's going to relate it to the spiritual god the great god if you've got eternal life the germ of eternal life was in god at the beginning and you were there you were in his thinking your name and all and he by far knowledge ordained you to see this oh praise the lord there's there's the pre-planning he says and you were in his thinking and he by four knowledge ordained you to see this if you can see this you can see many things and by his foreknowledge he ordered you to see this that's why you can see many things and then he says in you that was not ordained will never see it who is it that he thought of then who was it that was in his pre-planning that's so connected to this word where brother branham can say you ordained to see this and you that are not ordained you will never see it but remember in the name of the lord jesus christ the hour is here won't you believe him give your lives to him what a wonderful invitation and a call the hour is here for what for the ordained to see it the hour is here for you to see this your beginning in the beginning god now in the end god the god in the beginning the god in the end and this path that he had set this track that he began to establish in creation the hour is here now god's secret mystery he had before the world began back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and he was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it now think of that something in the back part of god's mind this is very deep this is in the back part there was something he was trying to achieve and was going to achieve so it's not just making effort but he's going to achieve it and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed so god ultimately has the word the motive and the objective all of them lining up so there's a secret in his back part of his mind that he's going to achieve but abraham says and maybe improve his word he's going to achieve to himself a bride so now i can say now watch carefully so it's god's great mystery secret that he had it's in the back part of his mind watch carefully now and see this because if you can see this you will see many things and you're ordained to see this will you break it down for us brother branham before there was ever a speck of stardust before god was god god is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at the time only potentially god there's a mouthful and he was only he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts they are eternal are they not we've already read if you can see this you can see many things his thoughts are eternal they are real so he says that god in the beginning even before he was god brother branham focuses on the bride is in his mind she was existed in his thoughts and those thoughts are eternal they are real and brother branham says in seed not air with the shock that's what the church is doing today for jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the bride is the part of the groom therefore the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day and it's the same word same experience same life in his day the bride is a part of the groom why first fold second fold for when god separated adam he was both we find out adam's spirit to begin with he made man in his own image created he male and female we're not preaching female holy ghosts we're not preaching some kind of doctrine out there that's trying to uh deify the bride above jesus christ it's the word the message of the hour positionally placing the bride out of the church and in christ it is an adoption message that takes those who've been born again by the baptism of the holy ghost and says get out of your mind this idea that you were some illegitimate child that god had mercy upon and brought into the family but you are born of his bone life is his life you are son you are daughter you are of the same dna you have the same seed same experience same life and he's positionally placing us in christ to see that it's male and female bride and groom so he says in plain language in very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member come forth it became expressed can you see psalms 139 unfolding all my members were written and then in continuance were fashioned they were already written but then when there was none of them they began to come forth oh how precious are your thoughts towards me though not express until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride now you got that part now notice immediately what he says next and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of christ though she may be female though she may be used in feminine designation though it may be characterized as this gender can you realize what this dysmorphia and the the transgender and all these the the spectrum and even the the vitro towards cysts or oh you're you just claim to be male you don't think there's any other parts in you in there that might be something else that the reason why this exists is it's to cause confusion about even who god is that's why it comes up in this end time not so that we get all angry and mean-spirited and and full of bitterness and hatred towards somebody who doesn't know where they are on that spectrum she is called the body of christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestined in him came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting god who is she is now manifesting god in a many member body whereas once god was manifested in one member even our lord jesus christ oh you talk about the power of one look what happened in that one once he was manifested in the one now he could be made manifest in many that's why we never lose focus we never get this out of order and get one over the other if there hadn't been one there could not be many had it not been for him had it not been for mount calvary had it not been god sending his son to die had there not been a firstborn there could have never been many brethren but now i want to take my place and be a a member of this body that is manifesting god first fold second fault my last page is blank so i don't know if that helps but we're almost done notice how brother bram says this i i want this to become part of our foundation so that as a church we're not a cult of personality as a church we're not politic centric that it's not that we what we are is we believe in a living ministry not just a live ministry let's lift up the threefold purpose over the fivefold because it's the five-fold purpose to lift up lift up you i i and to minister t to be a servant of all and this is this the fabric and the dna of this church is going to be that god had had something in his mind that he was trying to achieve and it wasn't to build a fancy church if you visited our website here comes the unabashed plug azbelievers.com hit like hit the notifications button subscribe all that pound it noggin whatever it is whatever it is you're supposed to say when you plug your website on there i put what the the purpose of the church not a vision not a mission statement but purpose and and and this is how the lord inspired in the beginning god's first masterpiece was a man was man and woman as a family not a church god's first expression of himself god's first masterpiece was not a church it doesn't say in the beginning god raised up a pastor and god had deacons and god had trustees and they found a nice building they began to have church and god saw that it was very very very good no god had a man and a woman that's that's his focus that's his ambition and the ambition of the church is not to be a church the ambition of a church is to minister to individuals and families that they can be the masterpiece doesn't matter if the church isn't pretty it doesn't matter if it's gathered in a hotel room just fulfill god's purpose and you're beautiful in his eyes even if there's some people that never come with this kind of setup should we get a 360 degree camera so everybody can see just how chaotic this is the c in abc is arizona believers cables i've never seen more cables in my life but that's not our focus that's not our drive that the burden is to lift up the people to lift up the bride and brother best is the very creator that created the earth for a purpose so god had a purpose and creative he said satan defiled it i i'm marching very swiftly towards the close here and i want to pick up on this image that brother bran is bringing into our minds maybe next sunday the very creator created the earth for a purpose then satan defiled it right and what do we call this earth mother earth because something was to come from it and why did satan so quickly why was he there so quickly to do what he did because he thought he was interrupting god's plan listen satan saw the trajectory satan being so close to god could see what god was trying to achieve but god hid it as a mystery so that satan's only looking at a part trying to figure out where it's at and and on the spectrum god used satan's own ambition to what display every single one of his attributes so it church age book chapter 4 the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing the heart purpose the central purpose the very thing that defined god you realize sometimes for us as humans we're identified by our ambition if someone oh he's into sports he really likes to hike oh you should talk to this brother he's a carpenter and what have we done we've taken their ambition their trade their work or what they're good at and we identified them by it therefore god at his heart at his core what was he a man that wanted a bride so if we hung out with him in junior high we would always be picking them you just want to get married don't you that's all you talk about is getting married and god's like yup that's right that's it i'm not ashamed you couldn't make him blush i mean if anybody tried to call him out oh you're just so thirsty to get married you're right exactly that's my heart purpose that's my eternal purpose the hard purpose the eternal purpose of god was take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world what was decreed i will have a bride that was decreed before the foundation of the world it was his heart purpose his eternal purpose and the very creator that created the earth he created it for a purpose therefore his purpose and creating the earth could not be incongruent or contrary to this purpose so brother braham says it for us god made the earth he made the earth for a purpose to take a church out of it he clarifies a bride and he said that's the most important job in the world i believe that's what he says here i cut it out just first space he says god made the earth he made it for a purpose to take a church out of it a bride that's the most important job that's a job that we're focused on that's part of our ambition as a church is as a local church oh god take a bride out of this valley call them reach them use me lay some soul upon my heart lord let me live a life that's so salty lord let me let me walk in the rhythm of your word be in the it's expression of god you said that as the bride we are manifesting god let me manifest god as one of the members of this mini-membered body he made the earth for a purpose according to his heart purpose to get a bride out of him he says it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride so genesis 1 27 god made man in his own image and he made him male and female it was foreshadowing god's divine intent right amen when he said that he made man in his own image and he made him male and female it's heaven and earth once again god over and over again i was like i don't know are they ever going to pick up on this are they going to see it they ever going to realize that i this whole time have been leaving them bright easter eggs as it were we've been playing this game for years and now we go back to genesis chapter one like oh my goodness i didn't know there was this portal there i didn't know this was there this is amazing why he had you in his thinking alone when he put the stars in the sky when he wrote his bible when he allowed it to be translated he was thinking of you over and over again i want a bride of my choosing oh before she was even brought into the depths of this earth he's thinking of you why because it was his purpose it was god's purpose even a singular purpose to bring forth a people like himself that would be a word bride praise the lord it's all the last days when this great mystery that god had hid in his heart is being revealed it wasn't revealed until now now is when this mystery is unfolding now as well as the mystery is unfolding it's calling names now is it being made known what was in the back part of god's mind and he phrases it this way the mystery that god had in his heart what was the mystery in his heart you got a mirror just look into it you were you could say i was i was that mystery how is it even a greater mystery it was the mystery of the prophets the mystery is declared by his servants the prophets was that god's wife would be a gentile even the jews as much as they believed that they would be in beulah as much as they thought that they would be ishi as much as they thought they would be betrothed god all along hid the mystery that his wife would be a gentile right yeah that's why the last mystery of the old testament malachi 4 5 is a gentile prophet and the first mr the new testament is all the gen all the women mentioned in the lineage jesus of jesus were all gentile women it connects the mystery of the prophets to the mystery of the new testament the bride is the mystery of god finished revelations 10 7 the mystery of god is a gentile bride and all those things that work together to bring her forth brother brad i'm talking and christ is a mystery god revealed he says the threefold purpose made manifested the threefold purpose of god manifested in adam and eve it's kind of neat the powerpoint presentation tells me how long i've been preaching oops in the beginning in the beginning god was fixing the circuit laying the tracks as it were establishing the path for his bride to come into existence right i mean if we believe you're the heart purpose all those quotes should i go back to that other slide but think about what he's saying the heart purpose of god the purpose of the earth purpose of ministry today the purpose of church all these things the real heart purpose the core the the thing that god had in his heart that means every track he's laid everything he's doing is to bring forth this bride so he had fixed your destiny he'd fixed your path it was set already and also he says he knoweth job 23 10 he knoweth the way that i take and when he had tried me i shall come forth as gold he knew the track he knew the path he knew the way that you would take and so sister cassandra if you could come i i want to close here maybe just say a few things as we try to wrap this up do how many here by show of hands now we're getting participation like man you should have done this an hour ago to wake us up how many were called brother branham saying he wanted to preach the trail of the serpent raise your hand if you've heard that brother brown never preached the trail of the serpent but he said enough things about it a few key things about it to where i i as i was pondering this and god's identifying this path and this trajectory this is how brother brown described the sermon he wanted to preach they had all these scriptures and everything he called it the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end through the trail of the serpent and even though he had never preached the sermon called the trail of the serpent he expresses the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end through the trail of a serpent and although he didn't preach that he preached this the bride at the beginning and the bride at the end through the trail of christ he preached that perfectly he preached it clearly he hid it over and over and over again through all those last sermons he's preaching as he comes to the end of his life why we could not miss that don't miss that the bride at the beginning the bride at the end through the trail of christ oh hallelujah hallelujah surely as i have fought so shall it come to pass and as i have purposed so shall it stand as i have fought it so shall it come to pass and as i have purposed so shall it stand let's stand i'm going to leave a little bit out it just gives us more to look at next time i want to start there in the garden of eden recapture some of these things that brother man is talking about the things that the scriptures talk about he hath made the earth by his power he's established the world by his wisdom stretch out the heavens by his discretion we see according to scripture that christ is the power and the wisdom of god but now the bride in her time in her turn is the power and wisdom of god brother brown writes in the church book in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god those are brother branham's words he wrote them in his book he said in fact in her and who the bride is summed up the conclusion the summation the totality the whole and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god who is then the power and wisdom of god you are the bride is then when god began to create in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth creation the intelligence the divine the wisdom the power you were there then you're part of that oh let that bring us outside of this realm of i hope so i'm on this this guess this uh chance coincidence mentality and yield to his design yes can we do it individually today with our heads bowed lord i want to yield to your design as a church lord let our purpose be your purpose let us exist to fulfill your purpose the local church is not greater than the body of christ local ministries not greater than the individual members of the body of christ the most important thing is this leadership of the holy spirit in an individual member's life let's facilitate that as a church let's promote it as individuals let's stand for it and let us have this sure conviction according to isaiah as god has thought it shall come to pass as he has purposed it shall stand with our heads bowed if you have a need in your life today i encourage you to bring that need before the lord we'll offer prayers you lift your hands or raise your need to him our gracious heavenly father lord as we stand here today to close of this service our thoughts sir overwhelmed with all the scriptures and the quotations that follow this path in this line lord once again lengthy maybe be laboring maybe repetitive but lord we must see this so that we can see many things i pray that this would become a sure conviction in the hearts of all those who are gathered here today their position in you before the foundation of the world their connection with your attributes and your thoughts is eternal and real lord that the word would begin to shape and form what that exactly means not eternal sonship or pre-existence of souls as some would conjecture and speculate and add to their canon and their theology but lord the truth of it as it relates to who i am and who you want me to be father i pray for this church pray for those who visiting today as we're part of not just a church but a body a body of christ that ex that takes in many different congregations many different assemblies just in this valley expands across this state across this country in this continent around the world lord we're all coming into this harmony in this unity by the same word the same revelation that's calling our names lord i ask now father that you'd give us strength for the journey that we would derive it from our position in you lord if there was a need lifted now today for a heavy heart for a burden for loved ones lord of sick body lord may we take our place take our stand in your word by your stripes i am healed lord may you use this for your glory to see the lost saved father my mind is bound up and complex father let your balm come and unloose the knots of my anxiety and loose the knots in my psyche lord and set me free lord whatever the need may be today i pray father that your word would meet it we stand ready to aid them to pray for them to to assist them father in whatever way that we can to establish their faith lord the father made this great revelation settle in our hearts lord the bride at the beginning and the bride at the end through the trail of christ once more i'll ride this trail again the bride is riding lord we pray that you bless us touch us father increase our strength and our courage in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
