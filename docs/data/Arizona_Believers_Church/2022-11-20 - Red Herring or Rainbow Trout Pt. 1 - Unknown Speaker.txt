TRANSCRIPT
========================================
after these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberius that's the Sea of Galilee and different names are given for it in history and even in the scripture and on this wise showed him he himself so this is a story of the third time he appears to the disciples after his resurrection there were together Simon Peter and Thomas called didymus and Nathanael of Canaan Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two other of his disciples Simon Peter saith unto them I go efficient amen I like that I don't like the next part though because this scripture is fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled just about every time I go fishing they send him we also go with thee they went forth entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore what a beautiful picture when you think about Peter and his denial of Christ in that Twilight hour uh and where that was crowing and now in a noon morning a new Dawning uh here Christ is appearing to them once again and he's but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus then Jesus saith unto them children have you any meat they answered him no and he said to them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter okay John saith unto Peter it is the Lord now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he Gert his Fisher's coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes as soon then as they were come to the land they saw a fire of coals there and fish lay there on and bread and Jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which you have now caught so now they're participating in it Simon Peter went up and Drew the net to the land full of great fishes and 153 and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken and Jesus said to them come and dine just remember that phrase come and dine and none of the disciples Durst ask him who art thou knowing that it was the Lord Jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth him and fish likewise this is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead amen you can take your seats I have a um a unique sermon today and but John if you don't mind maybe just show that I have a menu prepared for you today and this is kind of the title so the title today we'll come back to it is red herring a rainbow trout and and so I put together a little bit of a menu just to kind of get you thinking about this and I in the outset I wanted to say that I have a very heavy pastoral burden that I'd like to deliver and I want you to make it personal but don't take it personal does that make sense make it personal don't take it personal because I do not have any person in mind but I do desire that each one each person would examine themselves their individual Focus make the word revelant relevant for themselves speaking some European there uh just make it relevant for where you are and if it seems I don't have any particular situation in mind so it's not like I'm trying to address anything I just have a burden and when they're when the burden Comes Your Eyes well this must mean something for the people if it comes this heavy and this clear then it must have some relevance and so come with your rake today and not your Pitchfork bring it into yourselves make it personal but nothing I'm saying is directed to anybody in particular any particular situation though there's maybe some things I could think of not necessarily related here but outwardly that the bride is facing in different voices and things that are in the land and so I'm wanting you to uh uh make it personal but don't take it personal and bear with me as I deliver this pastoral burden and the title if you need the title now it's red herring a rainbow trout presented you in this context of a menu and if you can read it whole pickled and smoked net caught Herring is the red herring or rainbow trout Fire Grilled fresh lying caught rainbow trout so those are your two choices uh I guess they're served without sauce and sides and I couldn't think of any spiritual desserts or appetizers that I wanted to mix into the metaphors I'm just leaving it this red herring a rainbow trout today and you can consider that and ponder it I want to say brother Chris I appreciated the the idea of ponder points because I heard amongst the young people there was this little thing where they're trying to count how many times I say Ponder in a service I was like I can go two ways with this I can say it so many times I get sick of it or I cannot say it at all for a couple months I'm like what happened and so I don't think I've said it at all for two or three months but I'm going to go ahead and work it back in because the concept of a Ponder point I thought was wonderful the way brother Chris put it says when you it's a point that you pawn it you don't maybe fully get it at that moment but you consider you keep these things and you you wonder about it and you kind of turn it over and so I think God does that often with the word he wants us to think about it he wants us to ponder it he wants us to absorb it and so we'll have some Ponder points today maybe that's my subtitle pondering pondering fish there's a pun in there so John chapter 21 verse 9. I want to read this quote of this scripture again and start off this will help me kind of get kind of get moving a little bit and so as the disciples came to land I'm dragging these nets fish are going to be pulled behind them they come to land it says there's Jesus in the morning time and they saw a fire of coals there so Jesus had made a fire and on the fire already fish that had they had not caught but fish was already been cooked fish laid there on in bread and so Jesus is cooking fish for them and it's already prepared and he says to them come and dine come and eat I've prepared fish I have bread I've made you I've made you this meal come and eat and so fish would have been a staple food it still is a staple food in many different countries and regions it was a staple food at the time in this ancient times very important commodity and Industry in the time so there's a lot of ways that you see fish come up in the Old Testament New Testament in my research I found that there's no particular species or fish that's given a name but you see it mentioned quite often and the subject of fish and fishing occurs frequently in Christ's own Ministry when we see him calling the disciples he called them from their Nets as a matter of fact at least 7 seven of twelve disciples are actually fishermen and he spoke from fishing boats he traveled in fishing boats he fed the multitudes twice thousands of people multiplying fish and bread and even when attacks was due and he found he said go and I caught a fish and the tax tribute was found in a fish's mouth and so the fish is you know finds itself quite often there's some that have done very deep studies on the particular number of 153 and some say that's how many species of fish were known at the time and they use uh you know mathematics a lot of different things to bring in a lot of kind of neat types and shadows with respect to even the numbers and the fish itself but with with this particular instance here's Christ cooking fish and the very first one of the first at the very beginning of his ministry one of his miracles in Luke chapter five was a cast your net and bringing in the a huge catch for Peter and so it began with this miracle at the beginning there was a miracle of the fish and then here in John chapter 21 in his third appearance to the disciples after his resurrection it happens again and now he's cooking this fish upon the fire and have you heard of Saint Peter's fish it's tilapia and I think has a special place in the catholic's heart and there's a uh and for this tilapia they say this is probably what they would have caught in the Sea of Galilee at the time so some think the fish Peter was catching and even the fish that maybe Jesus Was preparing was this tilapia I don't know that there's any rainbow trout in the Sea of Galilee this is not listed as a species but there's there's herring in the Sea of Galilee and so my title is red herring a rainbow trout it's a choice between two fishes and one is maybe just the species in general the rainbow trout but then the red herring is actually cooked Herring and we'll touch on that here in a moment and if you're not thinking already a lot and mulling over this Ponder point of red herring a rainbow trout you may be getting hungry but lunch is coming I want to start with the statement from the sermon what is a vision and you remember the vision we call it the tent Vision the third pull vision and it was this uh this Vision that has these three different parts to it and unfolds one to the next the one that gets the the most attention is the one of the cathedral-like tent and that little room had been studied on that lately it's done a lot of different thoughts on that little room and some different things God's been quickening to me but I want to read this lengthy statement from what is a vision because brother Ram's talking about it's all about this third pool and he's referred and you take from other instances where he gives each one of these parts of the lacing the shoe the fishing and the tent he's just told the story about lacing the little baby booty he says are you threatening the wrong end he says and as I started to reach down I was gone again and then when I came to I was standing by the side of a beautiful Lake something like your Lake out here in the summertime and he's in Chicago when it's real pretty and green and there were fishermen all around the lake and they were fishing but they were catching small fishes and I looked out in the lake and those great beautiful rainbow trout out there so it's looking at these beautiful big rainbow trout and I said I know this is a vision but I can't understand those trout but I said you know I believe right down in my heart I can catch those so I picked up the string but instead of it being a string it was a fishing pole and just then the one behind me said now I'll teach you to fish how to catch those and he said tie on the lure and I snapped The Lure on he said now throw it way out government says now listen close way out into the deep he said when you do now let the lure sink down first and then said pull it slow now that's really Fisherman's technique he said then when you do now you'll feel some nibbles at it but don't tell nobody what you're doing keep it to yourself and said then you'll feel it nibble again and just pull a little bit but not too hard and you realize the continuity of some other parts of the vision it won't be a public show and you've tried to you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things is kind of the emphasis in that first stage of the the vision I heard a minister say one time and there's this real this will make you think he said if you could teach it if you can teach it to a Pentecostal baby it's not Supernatural and I thought okay that'll make you think he says you can't teach uh Pentecostal baby Supernatural things and so there's kind of that theme where don't tell anybody keep it a secret we know he's building on that idea of the third pull he said and then it'll pull it away from the little fish and when they scatter that'll attract the attention of the big fish and they'll grab it so there's something being represented in this attraction or this pull and he says and and said that's the way you'll catch it said then when they bite on the third time set your hook for the catch and I believe it's in another place where William says the third poll I think it's in the seventh seal he says the third pool will get the big fish so when he when he talks about this rainbow trout and this is how I'm using the rainbow trout as a symbol of something to refer to something I'm using it to refer to the third poll and what it means to you personally and whether you want to say you're the you're the rainbow trout that was caught by that third pool or has some sort of symbolism within the word of God itself the third pull is what gets those great beautiful rainbow trout out there brother man when he tells the vision he talks about how he jerked it too soon he looked like the lure came out of the water and he did catch something but it just skinned Over The Lure and he didn't really catch the fish again he was very discouraged that's when he's taken to the cathedral and God's trying to show him something very particular about the third pull but for me I'm wanting to look at this when I say rainbow trout when I when I give you the choice red hair and a rainbow trout I'm using rainbow trout as just a phrase to refer to the third pull and all it means to you and your relationship to it brother Adam and anointed ones at the end time he said the third pull the opener the word the Mysteries revealed the third pull was the opening of The Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word so the third pull is the opening of the word the third poll is the open of the Seven Seals brother Bradham not speaking even in future tense but present tense even past tense that the third pull is at hand it is the open of the word it reveals Mysteries that were sealed in the word so when I say rainbow trout think of the third pool think of the opening of the word now for red herring you say you're going out of order on your title it was necessary just establish that now with respect to red herring how many have heard of a herring Herring is a type of fish it's a small fish found in large schools it looks like an anchovy but a little bit larger and a red herring there's no species or type of fish called red herring but red herring is a dried smoke Herring that kind of turns reddish brown when it's cured through the smoking process it's very fishy very smelly a very pungent smelling I don't know why I said fishy like Donald Trump but it is it's a fishy smell and a very fishy people tell me uh but it's a pungent fish it's very fishy and the concept of red herring the phrase of red herring it is a fish that you eat and they can go back as far as 1420s to find a reference to red herring and Herring that had been cooked this particular process I had pictures to show I don't know how I didn't make into the slideshow I realized this morning I left all my beautiful pictures of smoked herring in the folder and I apologize for that we can we can do a slideshow later we could just do an afternoon session on fish but in in 1686 there was a weekly periodical it's called a weekly political register excuse me actually it was in 1686 in a British magazine uh and I think it was a gentleman's magazine that suggested that to train horses to follow hounds you could use uh a dead animal dead fox or dead cat or something like that that the hounds would Chase and you're going to teach the horses to follow the hounds and this particular writer said and if there's no cat available or dead dead Hound available then a red herring will suffice I think it was kind of used jokingly like hey this fish stinks it smells um so if you can't find a dead animal use a red herring the hounds will chase it and you can train your horses uh but a couple hundred years later almost in 1807 there was a political weekly political magazine that used the term red herring how many have heard the phrase red herring before all of you should have raised your hand because I've used it at least a dozen times already this morning I but so the red herring uh was used in this particular story and the gentleman writing it William Corbett I believe is his name he was telling the story of a boy who used a red herring as a decoy uh to distract hounds who are trying to chase a fox so he's a young boy who had a heart for foxes the hounds were chasing it and he used a red herring to kind of distract him and draw them off the trail these hounds are fox hounds they want to catch a fox and he used this smelly fish to kind of detour him and turn them away and so this writer used the red this story as a metaphor of how the present he used it to criticize the Press because they'd kind of followed some misleading information about Napoleon's the defeat of Napoleon and the Press was enamored with it and it was getting all this attention and it kind of distracted them and this particular writer said it distracted them from important domestic matters and this is the phrase he used it was a mere transitory effect of the political red herring for on the Saturday the scent became as cold as a stone so they were chasing after something they were drawn after the trail they made something very Sensational and they were distracted by something and that's how this phrase begins to enter into our vernacular and our in our language today a red herring was something that distracts or Drew someone's attention away so when I use the phrase red herring I'm not actually talking about a smoked fish but using it in this sense of this metaphor that a red herring is something that distracts from the correct course or from the proper context of something therefore a red herring is something that is misleading and but John if you I think that if you pop this definition up there something that misleads or distracts from a relevant or important question that's what a red herring is it's something that distracts you from what is relevant is something that distracts from what is uh what the important question now a red herring can be used in literature where someone who's writing something maybe it's a mystery novel or something that's building some suspense and so it could be used as a literary device where you're going to lead the reader or the audience to uh towards a particular conclusion so I know it was the butler in the pantry with the Candlestick I just know it it's all signs point to that but what the what the writer has done is kind of signal some things to kind of give you this scent oh I think this is what it is and it leads you to the wrong conclusion it's a literary device meant to mislead you or cause you to assume things or make the wrong conclusion but it's also referred to as what is called a maybe a logical fallacy in debate or philosophy and it's a red herring can be something that seems plausible very believable oftentimes it's Sensational but ultimately it's irrelevant and used it's used to divert your the attention away from something um that is uh from the relevant question my my children could come to me and they could say you know Dad when am I going to get a cell phone and I can say well when I was your age we didn't have cell phones and that would be a red herring right because I don't actually answer the question of when am I going to get a cell phone and I kind of bring up something that's my own personal experience it's kind of like wow okay when you when your age you didn't have a cell phone and you couldn't get a cell phone and the question wasn't relevant then but now what about today Jack wants to know can you have a cell phone today and we don't and I don't have an answer for that so I said when I was your age I didn't even know what a cell phone was he hasn't asked but I don't want to mention Elliot today so I wasn't going to use him as an example but this there's a lot of different examples kind of of this red herring it can be used in very serious debates debates on gun control and everyone's always pointing fingers oh that's a you know it's a logical fallacy this is a red herring but it can be true where somebody says well on the subject of gun control and you can change it to something else and say well let's talk about cars they kill more people than guns do and what happens is it distracts from the real issue of discussing well maybe there's some points that can be made here let's wrestle with the real meat that's in front of us the real issue that's in front of us and so a red herring misleads you from what is important it distracts from the real question that's at hand and it can be intentional often it's unintentional but it's uh and it's it's not necessary that doesn't necessarily need to be the intent to mislead but what it does do is it does mislead and a red herring Paints the wrong picture kind of gives a person the wrong impression it you end up placing the wrong kind of emphasis and um there's a relevant question there's something important there's something happening and the red herring gets everyone to look away and be like but what about this stinky fish right it's something that's used to mislead and distract and it diverts our attention away from the real issue by focusing on something maybe Sensational plausible but in the end it's irrelevant and it's only on the surface does it seem to be connected so when I asked the question uh or that's not a question when I pose red herring or rainbow trout what I'm asking and what I'm proposing and what we're looking at in this Choice even as it's presented as a menu item are you distracted are you focused on the main thing what is it you're eating on you're feeding on what is it you're focused on what is it you're thinking about what it is you're what is it that you're pondering um are you are is it a red herring or is it the main course is it the main thing is it the rainbow trout are we focused on the red herrings associated with the message and when we talk about red herring arguments I find most arguments against Christ are usually red hair in arguments they don't want to discuss the actual subject matter or what's being proposed doctrinally or what's being taught it's all red herring arguments to get you off arguing about things that seem to be related but they're really not they're not relevant and they're usually Sensational and it's all meant to get you off the trail to get you off the right path and to distract you so the question is am I caught up am I distracted by red herrings or am I looking at the rainbow trout brother random in the sermon what is the attraction on the mount he says so I've Got My Mind Set On this message that's that third pull and it's the one that I must be loyal and reverent to that was the third pool is the attraction it is that that great beautiful associate with that great beautiful rainbow trout that's that's what we're interested in that's what we're Desiring to feed on and to find and to explore and to understand better is the third pull and and you can't take you can't take that to extreme and say well then if the third pool began in 1963 then what we're interested in is 63-65 and is it pre-63 or post 63 listen what we have from 47 to 63 is the foundation upon which that is built therefore it's necessary to be built up in that too you can't just try to cold turkey walk into this 1963 and digest it all and get it figured out there's a Ministry a brother Branham to the laodicean church age there was a correction to the Pentecostal church and there was a tremendous amount of restoring that his ministry had to do to bring back that some of the Pentecostal truths that been lost and then in 1963 you have an opening up of something that he says this is beyond Pentecost but you can't you can't get Beyond unless you get two so when he says this is something I've got to set my mind on that we want to be sure that we're walking in the correct Paces of the message of the hour and it's this third pulley says that that's what he must be loyal and reverent to and that's what we want to watch that's what we want to have our attention on is the message and and the the message to brother Brown I mean even that Vision that three-part Vision in this particular instance of the fishing I believe the one speaking to him said don't get your line tangled up in these kinds of times don't get your don't get a uh uh the bird's nest when you're casting don't get the backlash you don't want to get your line Tangled Up in times like this this is one you want to be sure that you're setting the hook when you're catching the fish don't get your line Tangled Up in times like this so be paying attention follow instruction be mindful of what you're doing he's saying that's what we want to get I'll say this as he says that's what he's got his mind on that's what he told us to watch that's what we want to be doing and so realize there's a rainbow trout that we're after there's a truth that we're after there's something that we need to be focused on and the devil would want us to start following after all these red herring if you wanted to build it a lot on in terms of the fission analogy and the these great fish that they would have caught in John chapter 21 it may have been very well may have been tilapia but they weren't after the schools of these little anchovies these little Bait fish the little Herring what God wanted to catch was these great big fish 153 fish that filled up these nets and you could try to chase Bait fish all you want and get the anchovies and talk about how important they are and how it's it Thrive the ecosystem thrives because of it and and people feed on it not saying there's not any benefits to the red the hair in itself so I hope not to offend anybody whose favorite fish is a herring but the the idea that what I'm trying to present to you is something that would draw your attention away like oh my you ever walk up to a body of water in the evening you see these little these little drops and blops and stuff you're like oh my goodness there's fish in there this is amazing let's go after it well what you're seeing is like the smallest little thing in the water either nipping at insects or insects following it's like try all you want throw in top water all sorts of lures you're fishing the wrong thing right you're distracted by the the things you can see in the blips upon the water and it's in times like this we want to find the Deep things and we want to get into the real heart of the message of the hour and brother Branham says in the sermon have not I sent thee he says in the seed now in this evil day that we live in when unbelievers and scientists and so forth so if it's unbeliever scientists and so forth brings in everybody else are trying to cut away the very value of the word and that's that's what the devil wants to do is he wants to devalue the word cut away at the very value of the word that's where it starts I I feel very confident in saying this that the slippery slope begins whenever you begin to devalue the word you don't just wake up one morning the whole cell just reject it all and say there's nothing to it something begins to chip away at the value of the word and it gets the point where you don't respect it anymore you don't value it anymore therefore it's really easy just to let it be and walk away from it and so you recognize that Satan unbelievers scientists the world and society today isn't necessarily going to try to come right out and say reject it all there's nothing to it but everything's working to ultimately devalue the word of God and cut away it's worth for you and so we do not want the re the message of the hour to be reduced uh to an anchovy reduced to a red herring reduced to something that has very little or no value or benefit to us we want to recognize it as something as prized and something that's very valuable unbelievers and scientists are trying to cut away the very value of the word in second Corinthians chapter 11 verse 3 Paul writing this about the church at Corinth I Fearless by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ I guess I'll say this that right now I think what I want to do is just build the idea of distractions or red herrings or things that mislead in the scripture so we could kind of place that idea of what Iran Herring is and how it's used by the devil how it's trying to cut away the very value of the word Paul says he as the serpent beguiled Eve as he deceived her through his subtlety that that phrase of subtlety is important to remember about his conduct he says I fear that as Eve was corrupted so your mind should be corrupted from what the Simplicity that is in Christ so what Satan had done is he had defiled their singleness of mind or he he was afraid that they would defile their singleness of mine that is the the woman was very living in a an Eden a perfect Eden with everything laid out for every seed bringing forth of its kind Perfection of perfection all around her all she had to do is obey the lord the devil slipped in and through it suddenly he complicated things uh and he suggested that kind of diversionary tactic suggested well maybe it's not all that it appears to be and maybe there's more to it and so Satan uh defiled her singleness of mine Paul was afraid that their their Simplicity and the singleness of Mind towards Christ and his word uh would be defiled just as the serpent diverted her attention to somebody else distracted Eve uh with with uh with a pretense with something well could it be and something misleading it's a red herring is exactly what it was Paul's saying I'm worried that you'll also be corrupted brother Graham says in God's power to transform in the same pattern he deceived Eve he has also deceived the church which there Eve was a type of the church notice what it did through the wandering the wandering for knowledge she slips across the line between right and wrong by listening to Satan's perversion or deformity of the original word of God this is always Satan's tactic to confuse the word to take one of the original and kind of make it unclear kind of suggest well maybe this this or maybe it's that this is always his tactic and so he comes in and causes it to wander after something well let me follow this Trail think about how the red herring was suggested to be used to cause dogs to chase after it's sent to train to train horses or this little boy is trying to keep the dogs from following after the fox he uses a the scent of a red herring what does it what is it expressing to us this idea that somebody you should be following something and all of a sudden you pick up another scent and you're chasing that scent trying to find it and just as it was written written in that political magazine by Saturday the scent is gone can we just be honest with one another let's go back well let's just maybe let's not but say we did but let's just think about it for a moment go back and look at your text messages over the last few years and find all the prophets doomedaying about the economy about America soldiers in the streets no bread upon the shelves and think about how so many people have been telling you over and over and over again you better stockpile this you better do that you better do this and how often it's completely gone and they don't even remember saying it anymore right like oh I never told you need to do that my phone was hacked right and what when we look back when we think about what it was in the end it's all a red herring because something changes the fear is gone oh it's this it's that I mean I'm not saying I'm not necessarily weighing in on it but I I if some of the discussions I've been a part of when when Russia invaded Ukraine it was like this is it this is the end the Great Mighty Russia is going to start World War III and it's all going to be over this great Juggernaut of Communism is exactly what we thought was going to happen here they come and now what's happening all right everyone's prophesying Doom this is the end this is the end this is the end and what it what was it I think at that point at least this point was it a red herring because what do we start trying to do reinterpret the message just run a search on communism in Russia and try to figure it all out and place it with dates and blood moons and covet and everything and try to figure it all out and instead of really just getting to the heart of the message that brings rapturing Faith we're trying to read the Tea Leaves of of modern events and it's a distraction and so when Eve was deceived she specifically says the serpent beguiled me I was deceived I was tricked and so when when Paul says I'm afraid that just as the serpent beguiled even she confessed to being beguiled deceived and misled Paul says through his subtlety he's very shrewd he's crafty it means Sly or sensible Prudence so there's a wisdom to what he's trying to say and the devil if he could just always present himself red with horns and a pitchfork we could be like wait a minute I know what you're about to do and it's not gonna work right but that's not how he presents himself presents himself as an angel of Light and he says something and you're kind of like okay all right let's think about that that's that's plausible that's Sensational that's really that's getting my political Gander up you know that's uh this is really good to listen to and if you find I think it's you find it in the Christian world today that it's getting so uh sensationalized to where they're trying to raise up an idea of Christianity and this this Christian identity that Christians are ones that are that are poised to overthrow the government and if you think I'm just making it up I'll play you sermons I play sermons of fundamental conservative Bible thumping and even no message believers who attended the January 6th Insurrection or whatever you want to call it and and there's people that are all caught up in this fervor and using the word of God to justify it and what is it it's a red herring it's a distraction I say well is there nothing to this is there nothing well no it it can be very very plausible but what are we told to look at as message believers and Paul says in second Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 on the subject of forgiveness but yet this principle stands on its own lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices so Paul instructs the church to do something in light of the fact that Satan wants to take advantage of us through his devices to take advantage means to defraud you or Swindle you I'm after the I'm after the third pull and after the fresh kill of the word of God I want the message of the hour I want rapturing faith and what does he do he uses a little bit of a red herring to defraud you or Swim Oh I thought this would bring this Rapture I thought this would bring the satisfaction I thought this was going to be the answer for my family and he swindles us through his devices it's a plan or a scheme Satan uses tactics these logical fallacies he uses ad hominems and Straw Men and all sorts of other logical fallacies and arguments to get us to distract us from the truth of the word of God and I'd say that these red herrings when it comes to the message of the hour when it comes to our belief as a Christian and what we pursue and what matters and what has the preeminence are more common than we think just how often our faith which should be centered directly on the word of God just keeps getting misdirected just a little bit can we just all confess and I'm concluding myself just how we wobble a little bit right like this is the path this is the way walkie in it and what happens we start going uh but thank God there's a voice that's behind us that says get back in line thank you thank you and then and then you over correct a little bit and say no walk this one yeah thank you thank you and maybe we look back maybe maybe by God's grace it's getting tighter it's getting tighter it's getting tighter I just want to stay I want to be I'm I'm rising up and what is it that causes the bride and the preview of the Bride what does it cause her to get out of Step do you remember anybody want to tell me she had her eyes on the church that's descending Into Darkness laodicea the laodicean church and the laodicean church age is descending Into Darkness but the bride and her age is stepping up higher walking to a different music walking to a different beat and she's coming on the scene again she's rising up and she's marching to the the beat of the word of God and the when she gets out of step is when she takes her eyes off the word of God that's causing her to raise and begins to look at the other church and what it's doing that's when she gets out of step and so we do not want Satan to take advantage of us through his misdirections through his distractions through all the diversionary tactics and the devices that he uses to hang us up and this could go this could go a little bit different direction in terms of how ubiquitous some things are it's always there it's always before us we're always seeing it we're always hearing it and the channels that he uses to do it but I want to stay very focused on this idea that there's a goal there's something we ought to be focused on there's something we're trying to accomplish and how all these little issues that come up we need to ask ourselves wait a minute how relevant is this does it even matter is it connected is it it at the end of the day if we resolve this if this is even if it's true because sometimes we get arguing about something that's like oh my goodness gracious it's like well if it's true it doesn't change anything you're like ah okay that was a that was a a waste of energy I hope you're able to catch what I'm trying to say this morning in John chapter 21 we've we read the story of him appearing to them by the sea foreign cooked them breakfast a fish and bread and then Jesus is going to challenge Peter do you love me he says yes Lord he challenges him those three times I find it very beautiful that John wrote of Peter's Redemption and Peter was given an opportunity to affirm his love for every time that he denied Christ three times an item three times of affirmation of his love and just how it brought out in Peter Lord you know all things in other words you know everything therefore you know I love you and it's on the feed feed my sheep feed my lambs and so it's a very very beautiful story in this and then he speaks those beautiful words to Peter uh how he'll be able to uh carry thee where you you'll be carried where you could not go before and then it says in verse 20 then Peter turning about see if the disciple whom Jesus loved following okay John which also leaned on his breast at supper and said Lord which is he that betrayeth he said John is just you know he's humble right um and it says and Peter seeing John right seeing John and it's interesting this is such Peter's nature he sees John and he knows I mean this is the the Beloved Disciple This is the one that whom Jesus loves and John reminds us two times in his story you know the one that Jesus loved uh Peter is concerned about this guy and he said to him Jesus or saith to Jesus Lord and what shall this man do what about this guy um you told me what's going to happen to me and you kind of given me told me to feed the sheep feed the Lambs and you told me that when I was young I girded myself and I walked where I wanted but when I get old and I stretch forth my hands and another is going to gird me and and carry me where I could not go and it's even a reference to Peter's death and however Peter took it in the moment maybe took it as all compliments he called him an eagle and he thought it was great it was wonderful but instead of just basking in the glow of the word for him and taking what Christ said to him I need to feed the Lamb's feed the sheep and I'm gonna this is what's going to happen all of a sudden he's like well what about this guy can I compare what about your prophecy for him what have you what do you got to say about John because I want to compare notes can you say are you going to say the same thing about him is mine going to be a little bit different and he wants to know about John and Jesus answers so beautifully he says in him if I will that he tarry till I come what is that to thee if I let him never die till I return if he was if he was Immortal until I came back and John never tastes death what does it matter what this guy's lot is what does it matter to you what his cone is what does it matter to you what I would say to you and what's going to be of this guy Peter's worried about John's uh position or about his future his potential how will he serve what will happen to him and does he love you too and is he supposed to feed the sheep or am I am I the soul sheep feeder am I gonna what's gonna happen to John he's worried about in Jesus answer I I I'm going to put this maybe in a an interesting way but maybe even in Jesus's answer it's a little bit of a red herring right because he's not he's not answering the question kind of uses this this extreme and so this is Jesus being really really extreme right sometimes my kids tell me explanations that I don't care if you're 500 feet tall and owned all the gold in the world we told you to do this and it's kind of like it's like but I'm not you know I'm dirt poor and it's like that's the whole point it doesn't matter right but Jesus uses the same technique so I feel so justified in the way that I respond sometimes he's like what is it what does it matter to you if John Never Dies and what does he say follow me what does it matter to you as someone else is doing follow thou me this guy that guy you don't know what his calling is you know what his job is you don't know what this means for that person just follow me do what you're supposed to do I know that we're wired as human beings to kind of follow the crowd and we're kind of like oh there's a crowd over here everyone's Gathering right what I don't want to miss out right the fomo I don't wanna the fear of missing I gotta be there what's happening and you show them you're standing in the line it's like what's going on what's going on we're all getting our vaccine shot never mind I'm out of here right but we're kind of drawn to it we're like oh wow it's that's just the way that we're wired we find comfort in the crowd we find comfort in knowing that everybody else chooses that's what we tell ourselves when we eat at McDonald's what can billions be wrong and yet we find they can be but it's this Jesus is saying just follow me right isn't this at the core if you think about it Christ is is there the fish has been miraculously provided maybe even miraculously provided on the coals and Jesus is feeding them Jesus has just restored Peter and given him such a commission reaffirmed his position and there's such a beautiful moment think of how personal that time would have been at this Seaside with Jesus and his disciples to me when you read it and you kind of put yourself in that position you begin to ponder it how many am I at now who's keeping track uh three I've only said it three times uh ponder that three times Shah four can I get a five the the it's such a beautiful scene Christ after they fished all night and their Peter's a little bit disappointed I'm just gonna go fish and they catch nothing it's so such a beautiful scene and then all of a sudden Peter's distracted what about this guy what about this situation what about that what's his what's his testimony what's his history and what's his future going to be he says just follow me and then verse 23 this is when it really gets good then when this saying abroad among the Brethren that that disciple should not die you notice how even in that they got distracted yet Jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if I will that he tarry till I come what is that to thee so John tries to reaffirm the whole point that Christ was mentioning to begin with this everyone latched onto the one part so what was Christ intentionally being misleading did he say something Sensational so that people would fixate on this idea and try to dissect and figure out why would he say this and why would this happen you notice they do the same thing with the prophet they're like oh well you know he said that but he didn't really mean that prophets make mistakes because you know they start trying to dissect it and figure it out they can't just say well well all right instead of trying to get all bogged down in the semantics of it what's the message what was he trying to convey to us what was he trying to what was he trying to say and instead of trying to think and figure out well John's never gonna die what he was saying is what does it matter if he'd never died follow thou me what is that to you what is it to you what is that to thee was the question and the answer is it shouldn't matter follow me so Jesus brings Peter back he brings his Focus back to what matters follow thou me but it's interesting the nature of mankind as we see it here it's kind of that red herring where it's not kind of like John Terry maybe he never dies and they start they get distracted by this doctrine of John's immortality but he says what is that to thee and if you think about it in our lives think about all the questions that are posed on a daily basis all the different rumors all the doctrines that we've had to endure I I thought about this quite a bit in preparation for these meetings in Europe you have several hundred Believers that come and uh there's from you know many many different countries from all over there was like 80 or 90 russian-speaking Believers there uh they come from Norway they come from Latvia Romania they're Hungary they're just they're just gathered from all over 700 Believers and and I started thinking about the difference of when we were there and we ministered three years ago and how they hadn't had that the Family Camp in a couple years and I just begin to think of how our situation it changes we're never actually in the same context that we were a year ago because so much changes have so much evolved and so many things and so many things add up and accumulate and so we've got to be on guard more than we ever have before this isn't just the simple 1984 message culture where it's just uh it's just as innocent as it used to be and maybe some of you can relate more in the 90s there was a time when it seemed to be like a bubble and it seemed to be so harmonious and everything yeah you had your different ideas and you could joke with people I remember having a friend uh who was uh wanting to marry a girl whose parents kind of knew about the message and the girl was a message believer and he said I just don't know you know the parents are kind of against the message hey not only that you're in a cult within a cult and so you know you had some ideas you know about different ideas but there just seemed to be it was a different time it's a different season we don't live there anymore we live in a different age a different time different questions different ideas different presses and challenges and there's so many thoughts and ideas that can absolutely consume us if we'll let it so many things that consume our thought process that try to bog us down and we try to figure it out and try to the philosophy of certain things and the ethics of certain things and the truth of certain things and there's so much that we can get so distracted by and my question is what is that to thee what does that matter to you in other words don't get distracted don't get knocked off the trail keep following the scent and the rhythm of the word of God follow thou me is the cry keep your eyes on the third pole keep your eyes on the word of God don't get distracted brother Brown says in the greatest battle ever fought Matthew 24 also Daniel 12 said there'd be a time of trouble such as never like on the earth before and we're living in that time when culture and education and things have smothered over the word of God and gone into reasonings and so forth it's what's happening it's the Waffle House Effect smothering over scattered covered and smothered and dithered and everything else and it's what it's trying to do to the messenger there smother it over cover it up get it into reasonings and debates and suppositions and and arguments about certain things and there's some things that just it's never going to end there's some arguments that seem to be uh and I respect any man of God who feels the need to address certain things that are taking place I certainly believe that a a pastor in his Pulpit to his people as long as he even his heart's addressing his local people uh they have to be faithful to what they feel they need to block the people away from but some some of the debates that are raging today that I'm aware of or I've been brought into kind of the personal Fellowship on it's it becomes this quote and that quote and this quote and this quote and they said do you see how many quotes were stacking up and it's like look guys they believe all that too Yeah man they believe all of that too they just believe it differently than you and we get caught up in things and there's there's not this Smoking Gun you're going to be able to produce to silence all the Skeptics and all the critics that's something God does in The Showdown but there's something that is our source of strength that's the target of these things cut away the very value of the word smother over the word and get us into reasonings what draws off into this other mindset in Isaiah chapter 33 verses 5 and 6. I think this scripture ought to be something that is always ready in our hearts when we're in a difficult moment the Lord is exalted for he dwelleth on high he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness beautiful phrase and in light of that and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation for the fear of the Lord is his treasure if I could just summarize that focus on the word that's what he's saying that that wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times when there's things that are taking place and there's so much instability in politics there's so much instability and social things there's so much instability in in certain things that we've relied upon and there's a lot that is unstable right now whether it be economies and governments and institutions there's a lot of instability all around us and there's a lot of things that could drag us down or dominate our thought process and whether it be instability related to physical health or instability related to the financial markets or your job I know there's people whose job situations are changing and so there's a lot of instability in that you're not sure what the future is going to look like don't look for stability in in a stable coin Market don't look for your stability in the in the financial markets don't look for your stability and anything else other than wisdom and knowledge because that's going to be the stability of your moment and the strength of your salvation the fear of the Lord is your wealth it is your treasure it is your greatest asset it's what's going to preserve you is the fear of the Lord if businesses go bankrupt at the greatest companies in the world are turned out to be nothing more than another Enron and all of a sudden we don't have Amazon Prime anymore we we can't go here and we can't go to just think what would happen if down east without a business and there's a lot of things that might we could really keep ourselves awake at night but just look back and see what God has done he's met every challenge he's he's satisfied every need if you've had a want and he didn't want to fill it he's still yet placated it and he gave you what you really need God is faithful he will take care of us and wisdom and knowledge will be the stability of our times and the strength of our Salvation that's our greatest asset in times like this in other words don't get your lying Tangled in times like this you want your line to be straight so you can catch the real thing so you can have your nets full when it's been dark all night and you haven't caught anything don't get your nets Tangled Up don't get your line Tangled Up in times like these wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and brother Bram said no True Believer is any stronger I love this such a such a heartful any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive so you're not going to be any more healthy strong alive then his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God is so brother brother Aaron where's my strength your knowledge of and obedience too the pure word of God every word in that phrase is necessary to understand it's not it's you can't just you can't leave any one part out your knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God it's got to be this knowledge of it so we want to know it we want to understand it we want to have it we want to be we want to be listening to it we want to be feeding on and then we want to be obeying it so your strength your spiritual health Your vitality your life your living is connected with your knowledge of the word of God and your adherence to the word of God but what does a red herring do Cuts you off from your health cut you off from your strength your spiritual Vitality your spiritual health it's that's what causes the instability when you're walking and you're staying balanced you're staying in the middle of the road you're walking where where the fire has already been you're standing in the promise of God and all of a sudden something says well we should probably do this we should probably do this and you start chasing after this and you you depart from what you know and you start moving this way and you start going that's what causes your instability and Jesus like hey what is that to you don't worry about that follow thou me I I'm a nervous traveler some of you probably know it and I if the if the flight's at noon I want to be there at midnight you know the noon before uh and there's just it's just the way that I am I want to get there really really early and I I second guess everything it's like I know that says right there this is where baggage claim is but there's a lot of baggage claims in airports right which one is ours and if I ever not sure I stop right it could be a whole crowd going one way my family everybody and there they go They're disappearing into the massive people I'm saying they're going what do we do which way do we go and they're falling the crowd right I'm like no I want to be sure if you don't know stop for a moment get your bearing straight recalibrate find where the word is not the crowd not the questions not the sensationalism get back to Center readjust recalibrate and get your focus right because our health our strength our Vitality our living is in our knowledge of the word and our adherence to it but Jesus when he gives the parable of the sower he said the seed is the word of God and it finds place in different ground but one of the most descriptive passages he uses is that seed that falls into the ground that has other things growing up and it's a stage right before the perfect ground and these other Vine grows up together with it and he says this and the cares Mark 4 19 and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches cares of this world the anxiety this care the word is through the idea of being distracted you notice sometimes when you have something you're supposed to do but when you're anxious you end up doing everything else that you're not supposed to do it right I joke with my wife whenever we've got a deadline or we're going on a vacation we got something we got to get done I just joke with her she needs to go find a garage sale buy a find a dresser or a bookshelf and strip it down and repaint it and sand it and antique it because we got a lot we need to do but this is about that time when you got so much going on you find yourself completely rearranging your sock drawer and he's like hey you've got something you need to do like no have you ever thought about doing it by height you know sock length right and you get you get distracted right you get because you're anxious and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches in other words riches promise a lot to you all right maybe I could get a real hearty a man how many of you ever taken a job because it offered you more money and you found out that was a lie that was so empty right it did not I thought that was going to be the fix and it's not the fix oh if I can just get a good job then I can be more faithful this if I could just get a better paying job I'll be more faithful this and you find God gives you exactly what you said would be the answer and probably what needs to happen is it's gut check time you need to suck it up and start being the believer you know that you're called to be stop making excuses stop wait asking God if you do this if you'll do that and start bargaining with God and you're a Son of God he's going to give you sometimes the things that you ask for even when he knows it's not the answer but he doesn't because he loves you and he doesn't like your anxiety and he wants you to be mentally well and he wants you to be healthy and so sometimes God is just kind of satisfying us but if as we mature we need to stop and say wait a minute no no it's not that the answer is not in all these other things the answer is in the word of God and me just stepping up as a Believer and saying I know this is right I know this is the truth I'm going to do it I know I need to do as a Believer and stop making excuses I'm done with my diet of red herring I want to start eating trout I guess this is safe for any pescetarian the cares of this world the deceitfulness the riches and the lust of other things entering in what what wealth is being described in this choke the word and the word becomes unfruitful the cares of this world to this idea of being distracted comes from the root to divide to cut into pieces and that's what happens with the red herring is our attention is divided now you got a job you got to go that's not supposed to do it all said in the scent oh wait hold on it's kind of like our kids at a restaurant right there's a screen on the wall it's kind of like you'll try to sit in the corner right where they can't see it and they'll find them Preston yeah you eat your food you got it you gotta eat your meal You Gotta Eat Focus but there's a destroy there's a commercial on right Febreze yeah I like this one this is a good commercial ask yourself what are the red herrings in your life are we is is there even a consciousness of the distractions from the word of God again I'll be very very very plain to you I'm burdened as a pastor I've got to deliver this am I thinking of any one particular person in here no but you better be making this personal because I know this is a burden I've got to deliver I've got to share God showed me things and expressed things to me I know this is important for us to think about and to ponder because the question is do you even know that you're on the sin of a red herring in not the rainbow trout the rainbow trout represents this pure word that we're feeding on there is a genuine word that we ought to be focused on there is a Perfection that we ought to be pursuing and it doesn't relate to the Instagram life it doesn't relate to the image that we want to portray to people where everything's kind of filtered and everything looks good whether it be even your your church a lot of people want to go to church for all the reasons why people are on Instagram right they want to be part of a circle they want to be impressing people they want to have us take a look they want to have a particular reputation and and it's there's a drive within people's hearts where the word is not what matters there's a Perfection that we're to pursue and it's not social it's not physical it's the word of God and we cannot not in times like this we cannot allow our attention to be grabbed by a red herring this is something that we got to shake ourselves brother I talked about it a couple times on the seals you'll catch it if you're Wide Awake wake up pinch yourself you know think about it consider the hour that we're living in a Shake Yourself he even told Life Tabernacle there in Shreveport run for your life wake up Samson what's wrong with you wait Shake Yourself where are you at gotta be careful we don't have the wrong Focus where we're so focused on certain things and into some way we could say the wrong emphasis in Matthew chapter 23 verse 23 Jesus says well when you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and innocent cumin these are spices these are herbs that they tithe on in other words they pay tithes on the cumin like they're going to measure it out right like if you're going to make somebody say oh no you got to take that you got to take that herb there and um you know you got to make sure you tithe it right you got to make sure you get it all figured out and they they do all these things whether it's hyper focused on this one aspect of tithing and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith they're worried about this one side but they're they're they're not exercising Justice they're not demonstrating Mercy they're not they're not promoting Faith he says and I love how Jesus says these ought to have done and not leave the other undone so what was it an inability to give the proper weight to things because he says the weightier matters of the law there was an inappropriate emphasis on one part and that's wrong maybe the too much emphasis but Jesus is saying don't make the opposite mistake of forgetting all about this and doing the other part they had the wrong Focus their attention had been divided they were so concerned about this they were leaving others undone and Jesus says Hey paying the tithe is not wrong but you're hyper focused you're legalistic you're so concerned about this part of it you're forgetting the more important parts what what is all this if you don't have Justice if you don't have mercy if you don't have faith as I was considering it pondering it uh yesterday judgment mercy and Faith these are the great balancers to the tithing to the to the the detailed ways that the word of God addresses our lives without without judgment mercy and faith without the right the Justice the judgment's not just being critical we might be thinking well I got that down but no we're talking about judgment is Justice having having mercy and and doing things that are right great having a heart having a care without judgment mercy and Faith whatever we're doing on the other end is out of Step it's out of balance we're getting heavy on one side and we're leaning too far this way and we've got to come back and get judgment mercy and Faith to balance us out so that we can be making the progress we need to make and brother Branham says in the message Discerning the body of the Lord because here here's these priests who are taken out you know dividing mint and being so precise and so particular this is this is exactly what brother Branham said this and this is exactly the way it's got to be and it's exactly the way it's got to be and it's kind of like okay all right let's that's good I like that he also said this well I mean I mean that's just one quote well so is this Yeah but I said that in brother so-and-so's church and he had this problem this guy had an uncle twice removed who had a daughter who adopted a kid from Indonesia who had a friend in a school that he went to when he was a foreign exchange student who told him this story and brother Ben just kind of had to go down that path to kind of balance something out you're kind of like wait what seriously I know that seems a little extreme right but it's kind of what is that to you the quote meant the quote was fine here well what about the quote here and I you don't even that the red herring would be trying to debate them both but just say hey what about just taking God at his word what about doing both what about honoring the message if you honor it here why not honor it there there's a power to it there's a lie to it there's a rationale to it there's very little there's things in the message of that or that I do not understand there's questions and probably most questions you'd ask me I'd be like wow that's a good question I have it too and I'm like well answer I'm like yeah yeah answer would be great who do we ask right and and it's just there's a lot of questions but there's some things when I've explored things and got into it very rarely do I ever when I come to the answer I realize there's a wisdom in what brother Branham taught there's wisdom in the in the encouragement there's wisdoms in the standard and it's not all racism and misogyny and chauvinism and all this there's wisdom behind it to glorify God to keep our hearts clean and there's a way that we we try to solely up the message and we chase after all these red hair and arguments God I know your word is pure I know your word is true Lord help me to understand it help me to know it and don't let me get caught up in trying to be so precise here and completely undone over here Lord if I've got to do the one and the other just help me give the proper emphasis brother Brandon says in the message Discerning the body of the Lord this phrase this first one here keep keep this in mind he says Communism has come in on us and it has in ways that maybe you don't realize because when we think Communists we think of the Cold War we think the Red Scare but communism is an ideology that has rebranded itself kind of like Avon became the Lone Star Network or something like that right it's the same idea just with a different label why because everybody's counting yeah I'm not really big on communism but this right like that's good it's like have you ever opened the box up it's the same ingredients right just rebranded so when we're going to talk about communism don't just think about Russia don't think just China it's ideology and he says Communism has come amongst us world has come in on us our churches are broken up men dividing themselves separate in themselves not seemingly to have the faith splitting the hairs over the little insignificant doctrines we should come together arm and heart and pray and fast and call until God sends back the holy ghost that we might have spiritual discernment I thought it was so beautiful how brother Branham has taken us and and and identifying all these different tricks and he says men are dividing themselves separating from one another he says seemingly not having the faith so he's referring to a particular scripture I believe he says splitting hairs over little insignificant doctrines and this is this is part of the red herring and rainbow trout I think this is where it really opened up to me is there's things we start splitting hairs over and we divide ourselves it's like that's that's that's the dividing line now this is what's going to separate and it's like but what about the what about the this truth this is the word of God this is what we're taught this little this little thing over here this is a red herring if this is what you're wanting to split split if this is the hair you're wanting to split and brother bam says Communism has come amongst us that totalitarian rule this authoritarian type of government and I read in an academic article here recently it was very very extraordinary the way that it describes these regimes it says they must create maximum insecurity in the people that they control and so how do you create maximum insecurity through disinformation that this is the whole goal to controlling people in communism is create this insecurity and so what's the word that's often associated with communistic regimes propaganda but did you know that word actually is started with the Catholic Church it's about propagating Faith propagating the doctrine it says propaganda is now the dissemination of information that's intended to promote a particular View and so now nowadays if we think about it as maybe message Believers or not as Americans we think propaganda we view it in a negative light we say oh well propaganda you know that's it's misinformation it's disinformation and it typically is but it's used in such a way to condition the mind to believe certain things are the way they are these people are bad these you can't trust these people they've done this they've done that and you're told it enough right this has been scientifically proven through a number of different uh sociology studies that the more often you hear a myth's truth the more likely you are to believe that it's actually true because you don't ever rally dig into it to try to figure it out it's just you heard it once you heard it again and you hear it enough your mind just assumes the truth of it and brother Andrew this is where I'm quoting your the esteemed senator from Virginia they had a is an intelligence committee report and the hearings that they had on Russian interference in the 2016 election and I was reading through things because the phenomena is this and a lot of us don't realize it that foreign governments who are always been well versed in propaganda locally in their own regions or to cause conflicts and dissuade the control the people in other regions they now have more tools at their disposal than ever and they have access to your mind and your thought process through social media and we don't even realize just how much nonsense we're feeding on that is the that has been concocted for the purposes of propaganda whether it's being done domestically or by Foreign governments and the wealth of proof of whether or not you say well the Russians manipulated this the Russians like they have proved that they were controlling social media accounts to the thousands saying things that they knew would motivate a particular base of people and they would believe it and they would be hot on the trail right and they're gonna they're gonna do this and do that and they could pretty much control certain groups of people through propaganda and brother Mark Warner said the Russians employed thousands of paid internet trolls and botnets to push out disinformation and fake news at a high volume focusing this material onto your Twitter and Facebook feeds and flooding our social media with misinformation this fake news and disinformation was then hyped by the American Media Echo chamber and our own social media networks to reach and potentially influence millions of Americans communism is amongst us in ways that we don't realize manipulating Us in ways that brother Branham was identifying then it's causing people to separate causing people to divide it it's the red herring that divides us why because there's one thing that unites us the word the rainbow trout if you want to say you're the rainbow trout why are we all here not because we're smoke Herring right not because we're pickled fish we're here because we were caught by the third pool we're here because we're rainbow trout really that's what unites us that's what we're gathered around so then we need to be very careful about the things that begin to divide us and separate us it's okay for us to have differences of opinions it's okay for us to have different levels of Revelation I remember my wife when we recorded and she was like but but I don't have as much Revelation as you and I'm like okay cool right it's like we can be at different levels it's all right I mean I don't want to be debating the godhead with you necessarily right but he's not one like your fingers one well brother Ram sit over here it's like honey come on I just want to marry you so there's things that yeah there's going to be different levels right we're all in different areas so and there may be things that you feel very strongly about and I would say feel strong about it obey your conscience honor the Lord do what he asks you to do but if you if it comes to the division be sure that you're separating yourself under the real word of God and the truth and you're not letting hair splitting be the issue that divides us Jesus said for wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together brother man picked up on this and what is the attraction and he says that's what the attraction is the predestinated seat of God who can't do nothing else but follow it means more than life to us take our lives but don't you take that so it's the message of the hour that we've got to be that means more than life to us that's that's what the attractions what is attraction God as usual fulfilling his word that's what we gather around we gather around the fulfilled word and and there's things that even I could say as a church that we are primarily gathered around we do not have some kind of pet Doctrine we don't have some particular new take on the message we honor the word that has already been given to us we stay faithful to the truth that's already been opened up and revealed there's not another kingdom we're building we I believe in this age there's a reason why brother Branham introduced the bride age because the bride in her age is married to Christ and there's not another so we don't need another God another Elohim another Prophet we don't need another interpretation we are being wed and married to our Christ let's make sure that we have that in common that's what joins us together and that there's something that makes you different that's wonderful we embrace it stay with your conviction but be very careful that you don't let a red herring separate us there's certain things you can take and you can have but don't take this revealed word hair splitting as brother man refers to it it's something that to allow very small distinctions the hair splitting small differences become the the the the large separation that's what the hair splitting implies is that well that's that's a that's a that's a different take that's split in a hair that's a really fine distinction but when it but it's used to refer to something that wow that's what divided you and brother Brandon makes reference to it I'm sorry I'm just I'm just going along today I mean I've I've preached it's a eight o'clock and brother Bradham makes this statement every okay right now you you good brother Joel I'm just gonna check with you he's good and I'll keep my eyes on you are you good Cindy okay good everybody's all right okay good if you leave crawl out so I don't see you and I want to get my feelings hurt all right brother Brandon makes that statement he says men dividing themselves he says seemingly not have separate himself seemingly not having the faith and to me he's referring to Jude 19. these be then I'm glad I didn't put it in I had this whole section there the spots of In Your Love Feast he said these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit they disjoin they separate from one another they make divisions or separations what Paul excuse me what Jude is identifying is this mindset in certain people who kind of prop themselves up and they have these distinctions brother Ben says it's hair splitting who don't seem to have the faith here it says they don't have the spirit they're sensual and they come up with some sort of man-made class or some sort of idea of approaching things and they have a carnal way of distinguishing themselves right I I don't have a problem maybe bringing it up with Christmas right there are certain people that have taken the Christmas and they've used that to separate themselves out and they create the divisions people who separate celebrate Christmas and people who don't celebrate Christmas and yeah that's maybe some real literal categorizations but what they do is they say but the group that does this are the real believers and that becomes the hair splitting so what's a pretty major topic brother Aaron the Christmas tree I mean that's something you should be able to Christ died on a tree this was a mountain we should die on say all right if that's where you're doing it you just better be sure of it because to me that's one of those little red herrings where we get distracted for 60 days uh I think we started hearing Christmas music after July 4th though but there's things that that starts separating people and dividing people it's like hold on hold on that can mean a lot to somebody it can mean a whole lot to them and they have deep deep convictions about Christmas and their attitude towards it and they're very fearful and reverential about that subject God bless them I don't want to say a thing against it but let's be careful that our meat doesn't offend somebody else if that's your Revelation if that's what you're feeding let's go back to the message of the hour does the prophet draw a line in the sand and say still who will stand with me who will be shoulder to shoulder be who will stand with me in the word of God and draw their swords against Santa Claus right just be sure that you're you're on the right side of the message of the hour because Jude has referring to people through self-promotion they they represented that they had a greater sanctity that they were more spiritual they had a better wisdom they had a unique Doctrine a different kind of take on things and that made them distinct from others so that's what they did is they separated themselves oh oh you don't believe this or oh you believe that or as for us this is what we do this is our conviction and what there's they separate themselves Billy Bram says and hear ye him and are we about our father's business of the Holy Spirit get in every soul saved we can just on the word or are we arrogant this is what he's referring to about these hair Splitters arrogant and dilatory and arrogant over little religious differences and splitting hairs such nonsense no wonder faith is gone it's they're arguing over a little difference hair splitting he says that's why faith is gone is not because there's not a word that we can feed on it's because we have a diet of red herring that's why our breath stinks right that this is all we feed no wonder that's why sometimes children don't want to have anything to do with church it's like I'm tired of the diet of red herring they're not built for it they're not made for it I believe that there's a lot of situations where people make conclusions about people I'm like hold on wait a minute they've never had the right kind of diet to bring out all the gold that's in them they never had the right nurture the right kind of diet the right kind of atmosphere don't judge it yet no I don't care how many years it's been watch that seed get in the right atmosphere under the right kind of conditions of a loving Body of Christ a faithful minister to the word of God who's promoting right things boom watch them blow up an awesome Blossom and be something like hey look at this guy who knew he had it in them why don't judge them they just may have a poor diet and let us be those who can be espousing the right kind of diet that we can demonstrate that we can be Advocates that we can have possession and be a stakeholder in this message to say this is the way walking in it what is that to you follow the word of God yes anybody remember when I started I just let me just read Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 to 2. I think I'll just read this and end he says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and these sin which doth so easily beset us the way the way that Paul is describing is just there's just things that are so easy to us they're everywhere they're around us it's the sin that surrounds us it's the weight the weight that death beset us and so there's things that are implied here that that may be harmless and otherwise useful that can hinder our growth of progress he says the weight that besets us and the sin that besets us he makes a decision himself of things that just might be distracting you that in themselves are plausible and they're Sensational and themselves may not may not necessarily be sin or evil or some kind of false Doctrine he's saying there's things that don't promote our growth they beset us they hinder us they be setting means that it's a weight it's an encumbrance a hindrance so let's lay aside every red herring lay aside anything that just so easily triggers us and it gets us off track and gets us on the wrong set and he says let us run with patience the race that is set before us and these beautiful words that I'll close on looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith this is the refocusing that kind of gets us back on track how many here eat sushi sister Chris next picnic Sushi you don't have to cook anything right now here's some rainbow trout Raw enjoy it there's a lot of now I could be wrong because I'm not really a sushi eater so who's gonna hopefully can help me out here maybe get some amens but I love watching an American eat sushi right they'll take their California roll right they think that's real Sushi and they'll take their roll or their Sashimi they'll take some something Raw and they take the wasabi and the ginger and they just load it up like a burger with everything and they eat it like man that was good it's like uh you're using the ginger wrong the ginger is a palette cleanser that you take between tastings to reset your taste buds so you can enjoy the fish and Jesus this is the palate cleanser from Paul oh there's so much out there so many distractions so much things full of this and full of that we need to take we need to take Christ cleanse our pallets we need to look unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith we need to reset things refocus we need to remove that taste of the red herring and re-center on the rainbow trout so what do you want for lunch red hair and a rainbow trout they may have rainbow trout at Pappadeaux but Capital Grill doesn't have it Prime doesn't have they may have a special today I don't know but but I asked for me and my house I want the trout as for this church this church we don't want to be a red herring Church I I don't want our archives to be full of red herrings right right that on this Thanksgiving you know the all markets are going to fail and Trump's going to be reinstituted as uh premier of the the new United States of America and just float that out there for everybody to feed on and then when you know Sunday comes around it doesn't happen like well I never claim to be a prophet let's open our Bibles to John chapter one right and everybody's kind of like wait is he ever going to talk about this thing that he went on forever about let's not be that group let's not be those people we've got a perfect message or pure message so what we want to do is look unto Jesus maybe we'll just pick up on some of these things Wednesday night we'll look unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith amen could we stand together today
