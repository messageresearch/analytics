[0:00] john chapter 20.
[0:03] have you
[0:04] john chapter 20 i want to read verses 24
[0:06] to 21
[0:09] my title if you want to kind of let this
[0:12] soak in a little bit my title is blind
[0:15] trust bad faith
[0:17] and
[0:19] it's uh something that's been very a
[0:21] huge burden on my heart for some time
[0:24] and it's some of these elements i think
[0:26] have been bleeding over a little bit
[0:27] into our series on advocacy
[0:30] but this is just tonight going to be a
[0:32] big it's kind of a start to the subject
[0:34] matter so it's kind of just me
[0:37] beginning by getting some things out
[0:38] once i kind of get it out i feel like i
[0:40] can start and go any different direction
[0:42] so this is the hardest usually the
[0:44] hardest service
[0:45] and
[0:46] i want to make this comment in the
[0:48] outset before we begin to read our text
[0:50] that
[0:51] this blind
[0:52] blind trust bad faith
[0:55] is relevant in the context of our
[0:56] advocacy
[0:58] and
[0:59] and it relates to us being i think these
[1:01] things will be instructed to us and
[1:03] being
[1:04] truly stepping into that calling of
[1:06] being the final voice to the final age
[1:08] because that that particular function in
[1:10] our lives is to lift up christ alone
[1:14] and and that's going to be coming to a
[1:16] perfect faith and so we don't want to
[1:18] confuse a lot of other things a lot of
[1:20] opinions or ideas for that final voice
[1:23] and for that advocacy so i think this
[1:25] will be very instructive in the context
[1:27] of what we're ministering on uh right
[1:29] now in parallel on our advocacy john
[1:31] chapter 20 verse 24 read to verse 31 but
[1:35] thomas one of the twelve called didymus
[1:37] was not with them when jesus came in
[1:39] this in the prior
[1:40] four or five verses
[1:42] jesus appeared to them and said peace be
[1:44] unto you so it says the other disciples
[1:47] therefore said unto him we have seen the
[1:49] lord but he said unto them except i
[1:51] shall see in his hands the print of the
[1:53] nails and put my finger in the print of
[1:55] the nails and thrust my hand into his
[1:58] side i will not believe
[2:01] and after eight days again his disciples
[2:03] were within and thomas with them then
[2:05] came jesus the door's been shut and
[2:08] stood in the midst and said peace be
[2:10] unto you
[2:11] then saith he to thomas reach hither thy
[2:13] finger and behold my hands and reach
[2:16] hither thy hand and thrust it into my
[2:18] side and be not faithless but believing
[2:23] and thomas answered and said unto him my
[2:25] lord and my god
[2:27] jesus said unto him thomas because thou
[2:29] has seen me thou hast believed
[2:33] blessed are they that have not seen and
[2:34] yet have believed
[2:37] and many other signs truly did jesus in
[2:39] the presence of his disciples which are
[2:41] not written in this book
[2:42] but these are written that you might
[2:44] believe that jesus is the christ the son
[2:47] of god
[2:48] and that believing you might have life
[2:50] through his name
[2:52] god bless you you could take your seats
[2:57] i know the
[2:59] the title may seem to have a lot of
[3:00] weight and significance to it i i ponder
[3:02] it quite deeply in terms of just exactly
[3:05] how to title it so it may hold some
[3:08] uh presence in your mind and you'd be
[3:10] easy to remember
[3:11] but blind trust bad faith
[3:14] being the title and i used uh what would
[3:17] be kind of a braille print there for
[3:18] blind trust i don't know if you can
[3:20] really read it
[3:21] and then a bad font for a bad faith
[3:24] and uh
[3:26] and i i really want you maybe just to
[3:28] start to really ponder those two
[3:30] particular elements and i think they
[3:31] might already be obvious to to you
[3:34] uh maybe some of the emphasis that i'd
[3:36] like to share and i'll take some time to
[3:38] kind of define these terms as initially
[3:40] they strike me and i think initially we
[3:42] ought to consider them but i like to say
[3:44] this and the outset that
[3:46] this blind trust and bad faith are
[3:48] really prevalent conditions of laodicea
[3:51] and we could look into revelations
[3:53] chapter 3 and even begin to identify in
[3:55] the condition of the age how that a
[3:57] blind trust a blindness is
[3:59] characteristic of the age and then even
[4:02] a declaration or an attitude that would
[4:04] be in bad faith
[4:05] and so these are things that we are
[4:07] constantly warring against
[4:10] it's so prevalent in the world today
[4:11] just to kind of have a blind trust in
[4:13] things it's very prevalent in the world
[4:15] today to act in bad faith so it's very
[4:18] hard to just trust people and it's very
[4:20] hard
[4:21] in some respects um to be to
[4:24] control yourself and not give yourself
[4:26] over to certain ideas and opinions
[4:27] blindly
[4:29] and so i just want to take some time in
[4:30] the beginning this will kind of help
[4:32] uh me get comfortable
[4:34] and and i trust that you can just
[4:36] be comfortable yourselves and encourage
[4:38] me and help me along here i don't think
[4:40] you have any reason to be nervous
[4:42] and say i'll save my amen for the end i
[4:44] think you can just relax and the lord
[4:47] will bless you
[4:48] but blind trust if we take that as a
[4:50] phrase in just a term and we want to
[4:52] define it it's trust without any reason
[4:55] or evidence so if you have blind trust
[4:57] you trust in something or some someone
[5:00] without any real reason to do so or
[5:02] without any evidence and so blind trust
[5:05] can also be explained
[5:07] as being trust or belief without
[5:11] understanding or perception
[5:13] so you if you have kind of a blind trust
[5:15] in something then you don't really have
[5:17] to have any reason to believe it you can
[5:18] just believe it and you can declare that
[5:20] you're very adamant about it and
[5:22] convinced about it without having
[5:24] understanding or even any kind of
[5:26] perception
[5:27] and we could kind of take from this the
[5:28] idea of a leap of faith we say i'm just
[5:30] going to take a leap of faith
[5:32] what we're really declaring is that
[5:34] we're jumping into something without
[5:35] really knowing what we're getting
[5:36] ourselves into or really knowing what
[5:38] awaits or whether or not this is even
[5:40] going to work so it's we call it a leap
[5:42] of faith and in that way it's kind of
[5:44] we're blindly jumping into something and
[5:47] i hope you can tell already just with
[5:48] these terminologies we might start
[5:50] thinking hmm that's interesting i hadn't
[5:52] quite thought about it that way so but
[5:53] blind trust would be trust without
[5:56] evidence trust without reason
[5:58] and then bad faith
[6:00] it would be to refu the refusal to
[6:02] acknowledge or address certain facts or
[6:05] truths so there would be
[6:07] and i try to think just in a way to
[6:09] really um explain this because there's a
[6:12] there's a concept in law to where you
[6:15] can actually sue your insur insurance
[6:18] company the one that insures you for
[6:20] acting in bad faith and that means where
[6:22] they may not be willing to stand by a
[6:24] particular term or they mislead you or
[6:26] they deny the coverage of a claim that
[6:29] really in reality they said they would
[6:31] cover and so they have a duty to act in
[6:33] good faith towards you and there's a
[6:34] cause of action that would actually be a
[6:37] bad faith they're dealing with you in
[6:38] bad faith and so to do so they're even
[6:41] they may refuse to acknowledge certain
[6:43] facts or acknowledge that they made the
[6:44] promise acknowledge that your situation
[6:46] applies or they're not willing to
[6:48] address certain truths or facts
[6:50] and in that way if someone is will not
[6:53] willing to acknowledge well that is true
[6:54] or not willing to address certain things
[6:57] there could be a lack of honesty on
[6:58] their part where they're intentionally
[7:01] deceptive they're intentionally not
[7:03] acknowledging things they're
[7:04] intentionally not addressing a certain
[7:06] truth or it could be a matter of
[7:08] self-deception where they themselves
[7:10] have are deceived in the matter and
[7:12] being deceived they they act in bad
[7:15] faith the example of this and this might
[7:17] be
[7:19] the best explanation that i could have
[7:21] for what
[7:23] is striking me in terms of saying blind
[7:25] trust bad faith
[7:27] is if as an argument in bad faith when
[7:29] you make an argument in bad faith you
[7:31] have a hidden
[7:33] motive behind your argument that's not
[7:35] stated that you're trying to convince
[7:37] somebody to do something and you're
[7:38] using reasons for doing it but yet you
[7:40] have a different motive than what stated
[7:42] and to argue in bad faith but to have an
[7:44] undisclosed agenda and so often times
[7:48] when you're making an argument in bad
[7:50] faith you want to accomplish something
[7:52] so you use reasons that are unstated and
[7:54] you use these
[7:56] you have a reason behind in your heart
[7:58] like i want them to do this and the
[7:59] reason why i want them to do this is
[8:00] because i'm going to benefit from it and
[8:02] so you try to convince someone to do it
[8:04] and you give them different reasons but
[8:06] you never disclose the true reason for
[8:09] doing it that's an argument and bad
[8:11] faith and they find that when people
[8:13] argue in bad faith they typically resort
[8:15] to intimidation to get you to do what
[8:17] they want you to do
[8:18] because they have not fully disclosed
[8:20] their motive in doing it and oftentimes
[8:22] they feel that this agenda or this thing
[8:25] that they're wanting to accomplish if
[8:26] you knew about it you wouldn't want to
[8:27] do it so it kind of ratchets up the
[8:30] intensity a little bit maybe the
[8:31] rhetoric so they use coercion and they
[8:33] use intimidation try to try to get you
[8:35] to do something
[8:36] and these are dynamics that if you can
[8:38] begin to recognize them in personal
[8:39] relationships you realize wait a minute
[8:42] this is this is not a this is not a
[8:43] conversation i need to engage myself in
[8:46] because there's some arguing there's
[8:47] some argument being taken place in bad
[8:49] faith that's not you're not being honest
[8:52] you're not willing to address certain
[8:53] things and to really look at
[8:56] at the the full story or to acknowledge
[8:58] really what's behind your asking and
[9:00] what you're trying to accomplish just
[9:02] just some things to kind of set the
[9:04] stage for what those terms are we'll
[9:05] take more time in the future to lay them
[9:08] out in different ways but i come across
[9:10] a statement one time by richard dawkins
[9:14] if anybody's ever heard that name before
[9:15] i don't mind if you cringe a little bit
[9:18] but he made this statement in one of his
[9:21] books i believe it was the selfish gene
[9:23] which actually is probably pretty
[9:24] relevant uh title where he refers to
[9:27] religious faith
[9:29] as blind trust he says religious faith
[9:31] is blind trust in the absence of
[9:34] evidence so he's saying that to have
[9:35] faith religious faith his blind trust in
[9:37] the absence of evidence and then he
[9:39] aggravates it even in the teeth of
[9:41] evidence so he's saying that religious
[9:43] faith has no evidence and as a matter of
[9:45] fact religious faith exists
[9:47] in with contrary evidence in the teeth
[9:50] of evidence against it
[9:52] and this is it's i use this statement
[9:54] because it's actually very convenient
[9:56] and i could kind of cherry-pick to find
[9:58] one that really suited my purpose
[10:00] but this is deliberately deceptive on
[10:02] his part he's this is an intelligent man
[10:05] and you think that being intelligent and
[10:06] writing to the links that he does about
[10:09] the god delusion and and there not being
[10:11] a god and religion a lot of the
[10:12] arguments that he sets forth uh that
[10:15] maybe he would use a less deceptive
[10:17] argument this is deliberately deceptive
[10:20] because he construed the definition of
[10:22] religion to fit his own agenda
[10:25] clearly he has an agenda clearly he's
[10:26] going to try to drive home
[10:29] in champion science and the scientific
[10:31] method and things that he could actually
[10:33] test after he's hypothesized about it
[10:36] and so in doing so when he takes this
[10:38] and says defines religion is blind trust
[10:42] he's acting in bad faith because in
[10:44] reality you couldn't find really anyone
[10:46] in religion who would define their faith
[10:48] as
[10:49] blind trust so richard dawkins has not
[10:51] only made an argument in bad faith but
[10:54] he's provided a very convenient
[10:56] definition
[10:57] for religion as actually being
[10:59] characterized into some people they may
[11:00] view it as being blind trust
[11:04] and so with just some of these
[11:05] terminologies we're just sharing that
[11:06] kind of just gets me started this is me
[11:08] just kind of priming the
[11:10] prime and the starters so that we can
[11:11] get going
[11:13] my burden in examining the subject as
[11:15] we've pondered it now for quite some
[11:17] time
[11:18] is that our our faith could be
[11:20] completely liberated
[11:22] there's things that kind of attach
[11:23] themselves to our faith and there's
[11:25] these kind of
[11:26] peripheral things that our faith relates
[11:28] to and there's a lot of different things
[11:29] that kind of seem to be a part of it or
[11:32] um in the circle or in view or things
[11:35] that we associate with faith that we
[11:38] can't quite seem to resolve or
[11:40] understand and so there's a way that our
[11:42] faith isn't completely pure
[11:44] and we wrestle with that we're trying to
[11:46] figure it out we're trying to just
[11:47] exactly understand what our faith is and
[11:49] where it fits but in liberty in our
[11:51] faith
[11:52] it ought to be free from tradition
[11:55] and there's a lot of things that are
[11:56] just tradition there's a lot of ideas
[11:58] and there's a lot of
[11:59] claims that we might make in our mind
[12:01] and we make it a part of our faith but
[12:02] in reality it's not really
[12:05] our faith it's other things that have
[12:07] kind of attached itself to it and so we
[12:09] want to free our faith of tradition but
[12:12] also free it of human devices these are
[12:14] thought processes that we have um
[12:16] anecdotal things that have taken place
[12:17] many different things that might begin
[12:19] to form our version of faith but in
[12:21] reality if our faith is free then once
[12:24] it's liberated from our own ideas and
[12:26] our own opinions and different
[12:28] traditions and things then once it's
[12:30] loosed it can be directed to the one
[12:32] thing where it's ineffective and that's
[12:33] the word alone
[12:34] and so maybe if i could say this my
[12:37] desire and my burden and approach in
[12:38] this subject is to really loose our
[12:41] faith to free our faith and then take
[12:42] our faith once it's liberated this this
[12:45] freed faith and direct it to the word
[12:47] alone so that we know what we're
[12:48] standing on
[12:49] if you'll turn in first timothy chapter
[12:51] 3 verse 9
[12:53] i'd like to take a statement from that
[12:54] we've used this here recently and
[12:56] talking about a clean conscience
[13:01] and i want to identify want to take this
[13:02] phrase here
[13:03] where paul is instructing timothy and
[13:06] talking about the qualifications of
[13:08] deacons and he says holding the mystery
[13:11] of the faith
[13:12] in a pure conscience in this pure
[13:14] conscience um there's we could amplify
[13:16] that even further beyond what we already
[13:18] have
[13:19] but this is paul as he says that his
[13:21] conscience was clear as with god and man
[13:23] holding nothing against man nothing
[13:24] against god that a deacon ought to hold
[13:27] the mystery of the faith in a pure
[13:28] conscience and this word holding there
[13:31] the word that paul uses it speaks of
[13:33] apprehending something and even uh
[13:35] speaks of understanding so there's it's
[13:38] not just that we would have the rules of
[13:40] the church written on a book and you
[13:42] would hold it and squeeze on it and be
[13:44] able to say that you have it you've
[13:45] downloaded it you've printed it out but
[13:47] it speaks something to the deacon's
[13:49] understanding of the word of god and
[13:52] understanding of truth so he says
[13:54] holding the mystery of the faith now
[13:57] this is something very very beautiful
[13:59] when you think about this holding the
[14:01] mystery this is a hidden thing
[14:03] this is a secret holding the mystery
[14:05] something secret something hidden of the
[14:08] faith and i want that phrase to be a
[14:10] very prominent in our minds tonight
[14:12] because as i think of
[14:14] blind trust bad faith tonight one of my
[14:16] primary emphasis is there's only one
[14:18] faith
[14:19] there's only one trust there's only one
[14:21] truth and so in blind trust bad faith i
[14:24] want to in the outset just begin to zero
[14:26] in on the fact that scripturally there
[14:27] is one faith and so when paul says
[14:29] holding the mystery the hidden thing or
[14:31] the secret of the faith the faith is an
[14:34] assurance epistas the greek word that's
[14:35] used here it's belief or conviction it
[14:38] speaks of trust
[14:40] and so we use the word faith and it
[14:41] means something very particular to us
[14:43] but it's a it's a very full word it's a
[14:45] very deep word it's a very robust word
[14:47] it speaks of assurance and conviction
[14:50] and trust and belief so it says holding
[14:53] the mystery of that faith
[14:56] and if you think about it what paul is
[14:58] saying is that you have the faith but
[15:00] then there's a mystery of that faith
[15:02] there's a trust of that faith there's an
[15:03] assurance there's a belief there's a
[15:04] conviction of that faith and and i'd
[15:07] like to say it this way and you've given
[15:08] me some
[15:10] a long runway maybe to to cover these
[15:13] things but christ is the mystery of the
[15:15] faith
[15:16] even in terms of how paul would express
[15:19] this to a jew even in the way that the
[15:21] gospel would come to the gentiles and
[15:22] say here's this judaic tradition and
[15:25] this belief
[15:26] of a messiah coming and there's one true
[15:28] god and his in the principles of
[15:30] redemption then this was a faith this
[15:33] was a belief this was an assurance then
[15:35] when christ comes he was the hidden
[15:37] mystery of that faith all along and now
[15:40] he's presently declared to the people
[15:42] and he's made known to them and they
[15:44] ought to receive him and they ought to
[15:46] accept him and so then even going
[15:48] forward they could use this language
[15:50] that the mystery of the faith is held
[15:52] within christ
[15:53] and paul even talks about we speak the
[15:55] hidden wisdom of god in a mystery and
[15:57] he's talking about jesus christ because
[15:58] if the princes of this world known it
[16:00] they would not have crucified the lord
[16:02] of glory so he is the truth christ is
[16:05] the truth that was once hidden but is
[16:07] now revealed so christ is the mystery of
[16:10] the faith so this person and we all
[16:12] ought to have this testimony that we
[16:14] hold the mystery of the faith in a pure
[16:16] conscience we hold there's something
[16:18] we're holding that is still yet
[16:19] mysterious but we're holding to it we've
[16:21] apprehended it we've understood it and
[16:23] this is christ who is the mystery of the
[16:26] faith
[16:27] and it still retains christ still
[16:29] retains the mystery christ is the
[16:31] mystery of god revealed there's still it
[16:33] still retains that element of mystery
[16:35] because to the common man
[16:37] or to the carnal man the natural man he
[16:39] still remains mysterious
[16:41] because you can only know him by the
[16:43] spirit you can only know him if he is
[16:45] revealed so the the christ can be fully
[16:47] revealed to brother loyal but it doesn't
[16:50] in the revelation to brother loyal
[16:52] doesn't make him unmysterious to
[16:53] everyone else
[16:55] he still remains a mystery because truth
[16:56] can be disclosed to one and it still is
[16:59] yet a mystery of the kingdom because to
[17:01] others it is not given to know the
[17:02] mysteries
[17:04] and paul says in ephesians chapter 4
[17:06] verse 5 there's one lord one faith one
[17:09] baptism
[17:11] we believe in the in one lord there is
[17:13] one faith one baptism one baptism would
[17:16] have a
[17:17] lot more significance to a jew who had
[17:19] many different ceremonial baptisms but
[17:21] this one is saying there's one lord one
[17:23] faith one baptism this one faith is one
[17:26] truth
[17:28] that means there is one trust one faith
[17:30] one truth one trust when it comes to a
[17:33] christian's faith
[17:36] and this faith as paul says holding the
[17:38] mystery of the faith him declaring that
[17:42] there is one faith we could use a dozen
[17:44] other scriptures tonight but i want to
[17:46] be able to just take a step
[17:47] back and approach it from a different
[17:49] perspective
[17:50] we could use the present truth and the
[17:52] gospel a lot of different terms that we
[17:54] could share scripturally
[17:55] but using these scriptures of the
[17:57] mystery of the faith i want to say this
[17:59] this faith that paul is talking about is
[18:01] not blind
[18:04] but it is based upon god's revelation of
[18:06] himself to you
[18:09] this this ought to be the genesis of our
[18:10] faith this ought to be something that we
[18:12] can declare uh uh
[18:14] with certainty as a christian is that uh
[18:17] well so what are you are you a christian
[18:18] say yes i'm a christian oh well where do
[18:20] you go to church and say why i go to
[18:22] this church well why do you go to church
[18:24] there and say well that's just this is
[18:26] what we believe and and i was raised in
[18:28] this church and my dad was this or my
[18:30] mom was that and it's like well
[18:32] my mom was catholic and my dad was
[18:34] baptist and we went to a catholic school
[18:36] and then i when i got married i married
[18:37] a catholic so we've decided to raise our
[18:39] children as catholics so this is what we
[18:41] believe and you'll find that kind of in
[18:43] that narrative there's no point at which
[18:45] someone says
[18:46] i believe this because god has made
[18:49] himself known to me
[18:51] personally
[18:52] and that forms the basis for their
[18:54] conviction and for their faith and let
[18:56] me say that we all ought to have
[18:58] that kind of conviction to say this is
[19:01] what i believe because god has revealed
[19:03] himself to me individually to me
[19:06] personally
[19:08] and i will also say this and try and
[19:10] want to substantiate this through
[19:11] scripture is god has never asked us just
[19:14] to believe him blindly
[19:17] god has not asked us to engage in
[19:19] wishful thinking
[19:21] um god has not just asked us to kind of
[19:23] hold on to a hope so attitude
[19:26] and that's what that's what blind blind
[19:28] trust essentially will give you is
[19:30] wishful thinking or kind of a hope so
[19:33] and we're taught that there is a human
[19:35] hope that is an enemy to faith because
[19:38] it's not rooted in any kind of
[19:39] conviction it's not rooted in any kind
[19:41] of knowledge or revelation to where we
[19:43] have this knowledge that's what i'm
[19:44] basing this upon is knowledge i'm not
[19:47] just basing it on something that was
[19:49] told to me i'm not just basing it on the
[19:50] preponderance of the evidence i'm not
[19:52] just basting on well with beyond a
[19:54] reasonable doubt this is something that
[19:56] has been revealed to me and so god does
[19:58] not does not require
[20:00] faith to be blind but rather he is going
[20:03] to give us the evidence and the
[20:04] conviction that we need to believe him
[20:08] so if we can turn to john chapter 20
[20:13] and we're going to again read verses 24
[20:15] to 31
[20:19] in my studying on this subject i came
[20:21] across a number of instances where
[20:24] this particular scripture is used to
[20:27] kind of
[20:28] define faith or it's used as a kind of a
[20:30] defense or declaration
[20:32] that uh thomas was the doubting thomas
[20:36] and just think about how it's presented
[20:38] to us and i've been considering this in
[20:40] in a lot of different degrees in a lot
[20:42] of different ways
[20:44] and we have to be very careful there's a
[20:45] way that we could present something
[20:48] uh because we're trying to accomplish
[20:50] something so we present something with a
[20:51] lot of intensity but we don't take take
[20:53] a step back and think about
[20:55] what does that mean for somebody else
[20:57] or what's what's the fallout for that i
[20:59] think i think the way brother lucas
[21:01] would try to describe it as layers of
[21:02] complexity and he goes to the fourth
[21:04] fifth sixth and seventh layer of
[21:06] complexity and so there's a way that you
[21:08] look at something you're saying well
[21:09] okay well it means that on this level
[21:11] but have you thought about the next
[21:12] level you thought about the
[21:13] ramifications if that's the truth then
[21:15] what does it mean about this truth
[21:17] and so there's this idea that some take
[21:19] this well doubting thomas what made him
[21:21] a doubting thomas is he didn't believe
[21:22] jesus christ was risen
[21:24] and and that in his heart he he makes
[21:27] this declaration that says i will
[21:29] believe when i can put my hand this is
[21:31] quite a declaration not just when i see
[21:33] it for myself but he wants to be able to
[21:34] take his finger and stick it in the
[21:36] scars
[21:37] and he was going okay yeah all right
[21:39] thorn print now let me see the side you
[21:41] know he wants to he kind of wants to get
[21:43] his hands on it something he can feel so
[21:45] not even just sight but now touch is
[21:47] going to confirm it to him and there's a
[21:49] way that we kind of cast this out and
[21:51] what do we call doubting thomas right
[21:53] and this is this is a way that we kind
[21:55] of build this we start building this
[21:58] idea in scripture then it's like well we
[22:00] don't want to be like thomas right so we
[22:02] just want to believe if we don't see it
[22:04] we want to believe it if we don't touch
[22:05] it we want to believe it without any
[22:06] kind of evidence and we just want to
[22:08] believe it because someone says so and
[22:10] we kind of really lose the meaning
[22:12] behind we lose a lot of meaning in
[22:14] scripture and we can begin to lose sight
[22:17] of just how much god wants to make
[22:19] himself known to you
[22:21] and just how much god wants to prove and
[22:23] confirm his word
[22:24] and by doing this well i don't i don't
[22:26] need it i don't need it i don't need it
[22:28] and we think that we're really declaring
[22:29] faith but what we're doing is we might
[22:30] be running further from it
[22:32] and entering more into blind trust as
[22:35] opposed to real genuine faith
[22:39] and so let's just read through it but
[22:40] thomas one of the twelve called didymus
[22:42] was not with them when jesus came jesus
[22:45] having come to him
[22:46] and made himself known all prior to mary
[22:48] magdalene and then also to the disciples
[22:51] the door they were assembled together
[22:52] and he comes in he says peace be with
[22:54] you and he speaks to them so there was
[22:56] many who saw him and then were convinced
[22:57] that he had been resurrected they had
[22:59] seen jesus christ
[23:01] thomas is not with him but the disciples
[23:03] say unto him verse 25 we have seen the
[23:06] lord
[23:07] now ponder this dynamic here
[23:09] that it's it's not like thomas is just
[23:12] hanging out at the the coffee bar
[23:15] and he's there just kind of catching up
[23:16] on some work because it's been a real
[23:18] busy week
[23:19] and and just some random person says hey
[23:21] did you hear jesus was here the other
[23:22] day and he has no basis for trust right
[23:26] i don't know this guy i don't know who
[23:27] he is
[23:28] and so you know it's not that he had
[23:30] didn't have any basis to believe but
[23:32] it's the disciples the disciples said to
[23:34] him we have seen the lord but then he
[23:37] says in response except unless i see his
[23:40] hands
[23:41] see in his hands the print of the nails
[23:43] and put my finger in the prince of the
[23:44] nails and thrust my hand into his side i
[23:47] will not believe this is quite the
[23:48] declaration
[23:50] and we can say oh well thomas he's a
[23:52] doubting thomas so we could put him in
[23:53] the position
[23:55] maybe a skeptic and an unbeliever but
[23:58] then what proceeds next to me shows
[24:01] that it that thomas is not entering into
[24:03] this realm of denying jesus christ he's
[24:06] not entering this realm of not believing
[24:07] the prophecies he's not entering into
[24:09] the realm of not believing that he's
[24:11] resurrected but there's a part of him
[24:13] that says i want to see it for myself
[24:16] then he knew that that would bring him
[24:17] to a different level of conviction and
[24:19] faith he says and after eight days again
[24:21] his disciples were within and thomas
[24:23] with them then came jesus and they it
[24:25] says it this way so you can understand
[24:27] the supernatural element of it the door
[24:29] is being shut he just appears in the
[24:31] room comes through the walls as it were
[24:32] and stood in the midst and said notice
[24:34] how beautiful this is peace be unto you
[24:37] same declaration that he'd given earlier
[24:39] but then he says to thomas
[24:41] this is something him being aware and
[24:43] very conscious of instead of him saying
[24:46] but thomas you can leave now because you
[24:48] didn't believe that i was alive
[24:50] or he didn't show up and thomas is like
[24:52] wait what's going on what are you guys
[24:53] why are you guys getting all crazy
[24:54] what's going on huh what and looking
[24:56] around and thomas is the only one that
[24:58] can't see
[24:59] but he speaks to thomas he says reach
[25:02] hither thy finger and behold my hands
[25:04] and now he's given him the opportunity
[25:07] to do the very thing that thomas really
[25:08] desired to do reach hither thy hand and
[25:11] thrust it into my side and be not
[25:13] faithless but believing
[25:16] it's remarkable that even if thomas is
[25:18] called the doubting thomas that somehow
[25:21] christ was going to take the extra step
[25:23] to remove his doubt
[25:26] that he wasn't going to leave thomas in
[25:27] this state of well i just don't know i'm
[25:29] not sure but he was going to appear in
[25:30] such a way in the presence of all the
[25:31] disciples and say thomas i'm going to
[25:33] make my appearance to you and allow you
[25:35] to do the thing that you needed in
[25:37] particular to be able to say i believe
[25:42] and thomas answered and said in my lord
[25:44] and my god
[25:46] now
[25:47] jesus's next statement
[25:49] is is very important thomas because thou
[25:51] has seen me thou hast believed
[25:54] and and again this is not said in any
[25:57] way to deter to kind of run down
[25:59] thomas's faith but he's saying you've
[26:01] seen me and because you needed this
[26:03] you've seen me thou has believed it
[26:05] makes a remarkable statement blessed are
[26:07] they that have not seen and yet have
[26:09] believed
[26:10] now could we just take for a moment
[26:13] and recognize that there thomas who has
[26:17] seen and believed
[26:19] and then those who have not seen and
[26:21] what
[26:22] believed
[26:24] so the end result is still the same
[26:26] conviction the same assurance the same
[26:28] faith so it's not that thomas had any
[26:31] less of a faith it's just he he had he
[26:34] had to have a different personal
[26:35] experience in order for him to come to
[26:37] the place of faith but then he's saying
[26:39] blessed are they that have not seen and
[26:41] yet have believed but this is the point
[26:44] and thing to catch
[26:46] thomas
[26:48] that those that have not seen and yet
[26:50] believed are not being asked to believe
[26:53] contrary from witness or testimony
[26:56] because thomas had witness given to him
[26:58] he got he he was given a witness of the
[27:01] resurrection so thomas is not being
[27:03] asked to believe without evidence
[27:06] he's not saying oh well you just should
[27:08] have just assumed it you should have
[27:09] just believed it you should have just
[27:10] accepted it because jesus does not see
[27:12] he's not suggesting here that faith is
[27:15] blind
[27:16] that thomas you should have just
[27:17] believed this blind you should have just
[27:19] had blind trust and accepted it
[27:22] but this is the point where jesus would
[27:24] have said instead of being faithless he
[27:26] was asked to believe that christ was
[27:28] risen based upon the disciples testimony
[27:31] and this would have been no small
[27:33] testimony
[27:35] right
[27:36] it'd be one thing for us to leave
[27:38] tonight and as we're leaving the hotel
[27:40] there's a man that appears to us to be
[27:42] to us in every way homeless and he's
[27:44] saying i'm going to give you a million
[27:46] dollars i'm going to give you i'm going
[27:47] to give you 20 bucks maybe it's more
[27:48] believable i'm going to give you 20
[27:49] bucks i'm going to join them like you
[27:50] know we wouldn't have any reason really
[27:51] to believe it but if if you're if our
[27:53] parents met us outside the door and said
[27:55] here son i want to give you some money
[27:57] even without the you know the dollar
[27:58] bill hanging out or you know the 20 bill
[28:00] being thrust to us we probably believe
[28:02] oh well i got some cash coming my way
[28:05] because it would be the relationship
[28:06] would kind of provide the context well
[28:08] this isn't out of the ordinary we have a
[28:09] reason to believe this and so these are
[28:11] disciples that he walked with that he
[28:13] journeyed with that knew the prophecies
[28:15] knew the testimonies and that when they
[28:17] began to testify and witness that he was
[28:19] risen in two ways number one
[28:22] he had prophesied that he would
[28:25] so that would have given him a basis
[28:27] upon which to believe i'm telling you
[28:29] these things beforehand so that when
[28:30] they come to pass you will believe so he
[28:32] had the word of the lord that was
[28:34] already made promised him to believe
[28:36] that it happened then also now the
[28:38] disciples who would have been credible
[28:40] to him are also expressing that he is
[28:43] he has risen
[28:45] and but yet he doesn't receive them upon
[28:47] their witness i just want to make the
[28:49] point i don't i feel maybe that i'm
[28:51] belaboring it and making more of it than
[28:53] i ought to
[28:54] but
[28:55] thomas was not being asked to believe
[28:58] without evidence
[29:00] without witness without testimony
[29:03] but thomas this to me is what really
[29:05] blessed me this week when i was looking
[29:07] at it
[29:08] thomas was asked to believe based upon
[29:10] the disciples testimony but he lacked
[29:12] their experience
[29:16] and when i began to look at it through
[29:17] those eyes i felt like it was really
[29:20] wonderful of thomas
[29:21] because this is just how much just how
[29:23] much it meant to him and he's saying
[29:25] that you believe because you've seen and
[29:28] i likewise want to believe by sight
[29:32] and i don't want to take that into the
[29:33] into the realm of well we've got to see
[29:35] it to believe it that's not that's not
[29:36] exactly what i'm expecting is that i am
[29:39] not expressing that in any way
[29:42] but
[29:43] thomas
[29:44] didn't have the same experience the
[29:46] disciples had so the disciples having
[29:48] their experience were able to relay it
[29:50] and thomas being with them similarly
[29:53] situated and having walked with him he
[29:55] wanted to have the same experience they
[29:57] had and once he had the same experience
[29:59] they did then he could declare now that
[30:02] he has risen
[30:03] we're just examining it within the
[30:05] context of john chapter 20. but this
[30:08] whole process we're we're saying jesus
[30:10] isn't saying we shouldn't read this well
[30:12] doubting thomas that we shouldn't be
[30:13] doubting thomas we should just accept it
[30:16] uh without any evidence without any
[30:18] reason we should just blindly trust it
[30:19] there's there's a danger in that when
[30:21] it's not properly oriented when it's not
[30:24] really qualified according to scripture
[30:26] but
[30:29] what john by john writing this this is
[30:31] exactly why john is writing the story
[30:35] thomas didn't believe because he lacked
[30:37] the experience the disciples had
[30:40] and so john is writing to give evidence
[30:43] of the messiah
[30:44] and to give witness of the resurrection
[30:47] so the very next verse is kind of turn
[30:49] on its head this idea that jesus oh
[30:51] doubting thomas you didn't you should
[30:53] have just believed because then he
[30:55] writes in verse 30 and many other signs
[30:57] truly did jesus in the presence of his
[30:59] disciples which are not written in this
[31:02] book so the disciples are receiving this
[31:04] further vindication and witness of the
[31:06] holy ghost that god is with christ and
[31:08] these are the promises and giving them
[31:10] assurance to go forward and then he says
[31:12] but these are written john this is
[31:14] justification for written these are
[31:16] written that you might believe that
[31:18] jesus is the christ the son of god and
[31:21] that believing you might have life
[31:22] through his name
[31:24] do you realize that there was given a
[31:26] written account of the things of christ
[31:28] that in reading the written account of
[31:30] christ we would believe on christ and
[31:33] then through his through that belief and
[31:35] through that faith have life through his
[31:37] name so it's not just some kind of
[31:39] mysterious uh thing that's kind of uh
[31:43] some kind of nebulous idea that we've
[31:44] got to just kind of grab a hold of
[31:46] that's hazy that's in the cloud that's
[31:47] kind of free-floating this kind of
[31:49] free-spirited idea but it's saying i'm
[31:51] setting these things forth and they're
[31:53] being written and we're declaring them
[31:55] that they could provide for you the
[31:57] basis and the evidence to believe that
[31:59] jesus christ was the son of god sent
[32:02] into the world to atone for your sins
[32:04] and that in believing on him you would
[32:06] have eternal life
[32:07] so in that i want you just to catch in a
[32:09] very small way
[32:11] that the faith that is being asked of
[32:13] you here is not without a basis
[32:19] the faith that is spoken of in the new
[32:21] testament is trust that's based on
[32:26] knowing it's a deliberate confidence
[32:29] based on evidence
[32:32] and i i want you just to stay very
[32:34] closely to the idea that i'm i'm wanting
[32:37] to set forth because i'm not venturing
[32:38] into some
[32:40] uh
[32:41] anything that would be contrary to what
[32:42] we're taught
[32:44] wanting to reconsider certain things in
[32:46] certain attitudes and approaches
[32:50] because our faith
[32:52] when we ponder what our faith is i
[32:54] and i'll i'll say this way
[32:56] if you have true genuine faith you must
[32:59] have an anchor of your soul
[33:02] and so you got something that's it's
[33:03] solid footing to you and it's not just
[33:05] something that seems to be missing every
[33:07] time that you really need it so i'm this
[33:09] is a challenge that you as a person
[33:12] come to a place where you're not on
[33:15] sinking sin it's not shifty and you can
[33:17] believe this one day and believe that
[33:18] the next and somebody could share this
[33:20] opinion and you get caught up in this
[33:21] one then share it someone share another
[33:23] one or you can hear all sorts of ideas
[33:25] and opinions and stories and religions
[33:28] and doctrines or whatever it might be
[33:30] and you're always like hmm well i wonder
[33:32] well i wonder you want to have this
[33:34] genuine solid footing as a christian and
[33:36] as a believer to know that what i
[33:38] believe and what i am convinced of has
[33:41] been disclosed to me
[33:43] and and it's real this is a real
[33:44] knowledge this is a real truth
[33:46] and so our faith is a trust and
[33:48] commitment in what we have reason to
[33:50] believe is truth
[33:53] again it's not without reason now to the
[33:55] world it may be unreasonable and the
[33:57] world may not accept your reasons so i'm
[33:59] not saying this is beyond the this is to
[34:01] the point to where it's irrefutable to
[34:03] the world but you as a christian you
[34:05] have a trust and a commitment that you
[34:08] have reason to believe in
[34:13] right
[34:14] let me ask you this why do why do you
[34:17] believe that god's a healer
[34:20] now on one hand we could say well we
[34:22] believe it because i guess the bible
[34:24] says it but be honest
[34:26] you know you know someone who's been
[34:27] healed
[34:28] you yourself have experienced healing so
[34:30] god on one level he says by your stripes
[34:34] by his stripes i am healed and we
[34:36] believe in divine healing but then when
[34:38] you look at the practical application of
[34:39] the scripture that god then what does he
[34:42] do he confirms his word and he heals
[34:46] and so we're not in a world today with
[34:48] with all these promises in the bible and
[34:51] we believe the bible and then when we
[34:53] say well okay we believe it and then
[34:55] it's apart from vindication or apart
[34:57] from proof
[34:58] and so our faith isn't this blind faith
[35:00] to where we're just kind of saying well
[35:02] god said it and i believe it but we
[35:04] ought to have this understanding that
[35:06] what we believe god will gladly confirm
[35:10] what we begin the reason why we can
[35:11] accept it the reason why we can believe
[35:13] it is there's some basis for that
[35:16] otherwise i would suggest that today if
[35:18] you do not have that kind of conviction
[35:21] in your heart what you believe to be the
[35:23] truth today
[35:25] uh you could be um
[35:29] there's a statement coming into my mind
[35:30] right now that i want to share here in
[35:32] just a second that what you believe to
[35:33] be the truth today you may be you may be
[35:36] able to be convinced of a different
[35:37] truth the next
[35:40] you could be in
[35:42] islam today
[35:43] you could be a christian tomorrow you
[35:45] could be a hindu the next
[35:47] because you you don't have your bait you
[35:49] don't have a basis and a reason for
[35:51] believing it
[35:52] and
[35:53] and there's a statement that had come to
[35:55] my mind how that anyone who is convinced
[35:57] against their will hasn't really had a
[35:59] change of mind
[36:02] and so this a conversion a real faith is
[36:05] not just a a convincing to where there
[36:08] isn't a death to will and a death to
[36:09] self i'm really speaking of an
[36:11] experience that is a tie post and i
[36:13] believe that we've had that and having
[36:15] that let's not let's not lose sight of
[36:17] it
[36:18] because as we continue in our journey of
[36:20] faith there's a way that we begin to i
[36:22] want to use the term meander but that
[36:23] might suggest we're in the wrong path
[36:25] but in the attrition of the stand for
[36:27] christ and the longevity of our our walk
[36:30] with god sometimes i think we can get we
[36:32] can get so far down the road that we're
[36:34] looking at all these other things that
[36:35] are happening and we're kind of
[36:37] forgetting the trail that leads back to
[36:40] the word of god
[36:42] and that we believe because god has this
[36:44] is that because we have reason to
[36:46] believe
[36:48] now ultimately our faith is based upon
[36:50] the word
[36:51] that's ultimately that's what it's based
[36:53] based upon
[36:54] and god is in his word
[36:58] i want you to think about this thought
[36:59] process well we believe the word it's
[37:01] the word alone word only we believe the
[37:03] word and i and i
[37:04] uh and i'm a strong proponent of the
[37:07] word only
[37:09] we believe his word and we say that
[37:11] that's what my faith is based upon my
[37:14] faith is based upon the word alone now
[37:17] god is in his word
[37:19] so it is not that we're just believing
[37:21] in
[37:23] something that god is not in something
[37:25] ancillary or something separate from god
[37:28] but god is in his word
[37:30] and then this is the other part we have
[37:31] to catch god confirms his word
[37:35] so if god if we believe his word and god
[37:37] is in his word
[37:39] then god confirms his word
[37:41] and
[37:42] and if i can say this god would be happy
[37:44] to vindicate it to you
[37:48] so i i realize i'm i'm laying some
[37:51] things out maybe not not seemingly going
[37:53] very deep but i'm i'm wanting just to
[37:55] provoke some thinking on your part
[37:56] tonight just get you to think some of
[37:58] some of these things in john chapter 1
[38:01] verses 43 to 50.
[38:05] it says
[38:06] the day following jesus the day
[38:08] following jesus would go forth into
[38:10] galilee and findeth philip and saith
[38:12] unto him follow me
[38:14] now philip was of bethsaida the city of
[38:16] andrew and peter so then philip has been
[38:19] called to follow and
[38:21] i realize now at this point
[38:24] even as he says that speaking of andrew
[38:26] and peter and these different ones
[38:28] sometimes we look at their experience
[38:30] and we almost get this feeling that just
[38:32] philip is you know philip is standing
[38:34] there one day and just some random guy
[38:36] says you know come on let's go
[38:39] there's more supernatural taking place
[38:41] even when it comes to peter and andrew
[38:43] who are these disciples of john
[38:47] and they have this discipleship and
[38:48] they're following john and then they
[38:50] have these different instances of
[38:51] vindication and
[38:53] and they're pointed to jesus christ and
[38:55] christ is confirmed in his presence and
[38:57] revealing himself but there is this
[38:59] there's something that's captured in the
[39:00] heart of philip and philip he says come
[39:02] follow me so then philip findeth
[39:05] nathanael and saith unto him we have
[39:07] found him
[39:09] now notice the basis of philip's witness
[39:12] who moses in the law and the prophets
[39:15] did right so he has reason he's not just
[39:18] saying hey we found the you know the
[39:20] cookie monster
[39:22] and we ought to follow the cookie
[39:24] monster and the jew would be like cookie
[39:25] monster i mean who's the cookie monster
[39:28] why should we follow the cookie monster
[39:29] so he's not suggesting just some random
[39:32] character
[39:33] just some crazy guy you know hey this is
[39:36] i want you to meet frank and frank
[39:37] believes that there's an alien ship
[39:38] that's going to come back and take us
[39:40] all out of here so if you could just put
[39:42] on your adidas set a and drink the
[39:44] kool-aid you know there's gonna be an
[39:45] alien ship take us out of here one day
[39:48] that's not what he's proposing
[39:50] he has basis moses and the law and the
[39:52] prophets did right he says jesus
[39:54] the son of joseph now nathanael says
[39:57] unto him can there any good thing come
[39:59] out of nazareth so there's a little bit
[40:00] of skepticism philip saith unto him come
[40:03] and see
[40:06] again i i see this as philip saying you
[40:09] know what it's best that you just meet
[40:10] him yourself
[40:13] and jesus jesus saw nathanael coming to
[40:16] him and said behold an israelite indeed
[40:19] in whom is no guile
[40:21] and this strikes nathanael this catches
[40:22] his attention and he says whence knowest
[40:25] thou me
[40:27] jesus answered and said in him before
[40:28] that philip called thee when thou wasted
[40:31] under the fig tree i saw thee
[40:34] what a beautiful statement before you
[40:36] were even called and then he makes some
[40:38] reference to him this would be something
[40:39] that would have been significant to phil
[40:41] to to nathaniel something that he could
[40:43] recall when you were under the fig tree
[40:45] i saw thee
[40:47] now what could we say this clearly is
[40:49] this is an intent attention getter
[40:52] so it is though we might say that jesus
[40:55] just comes by and says hey follow me he
[40:57] said well what reason would i have to
[40:59] follow you christ is going to do
[41:01] something
[41:02] he wants to make himself known reveal
[41:04] himself to you in a special way to where
[41:06] you know that's god that's supernatural
[41:10] that's beyond just some sage that's just
[41:11] beyond someone who's intelligent tell
[41:13] that that's beyond just wisdom of man
[41:15] that's better that's more than just a
[41:16] good debate style that that's more than
[41:18] just being able to to um parse a part in
[41:21] our you know
[41:22] parse an argument and put everything in
[41:24] place and kind of make a convincing
[41:25] truth you know when something can strike
[41:27] you in such a simple way where you know
[41:30] that's god and this is a situation where
[41:32] god had a way of getting nathanael's
[41:34] attention
[41:36] and so his response was rabbi thou art
[41:39] the son of god thou art the king of
[41:41] israel and let me ask you this was that
[41:43] faith
[41:45] it's faith was it without reason no he
[41:47] had reason to believe now it doesn't
[41:49] mean there has to be reason enough to
[41:51] satisfy this person satisfy that person
[41:53] or convince richard dawkins but listen
[41:56] this is something that nathaniel could
[41:57] say i believe
[41:59] by this evidence what's been shown in me
[42:01] the sign that's been given to me i
[42:03] believe that thou art the son of god
[42:05] thou art the king of israel
[42:07] and so jesus answered and said unto him
[42:09] very important a passage here because i
[42:11] said unto thee i saw thee under the fig
[42:12] tree believeth thou
[42:15] notice that
[42:17] just because i said
[42:19] gave you this sign
[42:21] said something that would get your
[42:22] attention something personal it's maybe
[42:24] some circumstance that to him was
[42:26] profound so it says before you were
[42:28] under that fig tree before philip talked
[42:30] to you when you're under that victory i
[42:32] saw you and i knew you
[42:34] he says and because i said that you
[42:35] believe and the answer would have been
[42:37] yes
[42:38] i mean it's a rhetorical question
[42:40] because nathaniel's like yep
[42:42] i believe you're the son of god i
[42:44] believe that you're the king of israel
[42:45] that's all it took was was this this
[42:48] kind of this kind of un disclosing to me
[42:51] this kind of knowledge that gives me
[42:52] reason
[42:53] because of what he had seen what he had
[42:55] known what he had been taught it was
[42:57] what he needed to hear and then jesus
[42:59] makes this beautiful statement thou
[43:00] shalt see greater things than these
[43:05] what i'd like to point out is that
[43:08] we could say that this is a tremendous
[43:09] amount of faith on nathanael's part to
[43:11] say
[43:12] to be told i saw you under the fig tree
[43:14] and then phil be like
[43:16] i believe
[43:18] and and we could have been left with
[43:19] this all right
[43:21] good let's go forward
[43:23] and that that would be that would be the
[43:25] ultimate of faith is just to take god at
[43:26] this single sentence and this
[43:28] discernment this declaration into his
[43:30] heart that would somehow it's going to
[43:32] move nathanael along to to go all the
[43:34] way on to the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:35] from the day of pentecost but jesus goes
[43:37] on to say because you've believed that
[43:40] you'll see greater things than these
[43:44] th
[43:44] it shows us that there's a sign there
[43:46] could be a sign and something that gets
[43:47] our attention in something that can
[43:49] convict our hearts and begin to disclose
[43:51] to us that this is supernatural this is
[43:53] something of god but he's not just going
[43:55] to leave you in that state we're always
[43:56] just trying to hold on to something long
[43:58] time ago he said if that's genuine faith
[44:00] if that's genuine trust and conviction
[44:02] and assurance since this knowledge has
[44:04] been disclosed to you and you have you
[44:06] are believing with reason you're going
[44:09] to see greater things than just that
[44:12] and can that not be descriptive of the
[44:14] christian walk that we've had as
[44:16] believers is that because we truly had
[44:18] faith in the infancy in the beginning
[44:21] and in the innocency it's disclosed to
[44:23] us and we believe for what may be a very
[44:25] small reason to the world since that
[44:28] time we have seen greater things and our
[44:30] faith now is insurmountable not because
[44:33] we're holding on to the shred of some
[44:35] ghost of something in the way past but
[44:38] it's because god has shown us greater
[44:40] things and we believe because we have
[44:43] reason to believe
[44:48] the bible says in john 8 32
[44:51] and ye shall know the truth and the
[44:53] truth
[44:54] shall make you free
[44:56] scripture that's quoted quite often it's
[44:58] been quoted quite often just in the
[44:59] short time that we've had a church here
[45:01] you shall know the truth and the truth
[45:04] shall make you free
[45:07] it says you shall know the truth
[45:09] i merely believe in a truth or believe
[45:11] that this is the truth but it says that
[45:13] you shall
[45:14] know the truth and it is in knowing the
[45:17] truth that the truth is effective
[45:20] you can believe i believe that is the
[45:22] truth and i believe that there is a
[45:23] truth or i believe that there is a god
[45:25] he's just not quite sure what his nature
[45:27] is or
[45:28] what his attitude is and that's not
[45:30] going to bring you to liberty
[45:32] but to know the truth
[45:34] and end that truth by the knowledge of
[45:36] the truth it's the truth itself that
[45:38] makes you free
[45:41] faith cannot be separated from the
[45:42] knowledge of the truth
[45:47] as pondering today may be different
[45:49] applications of this to help you
[45:50] understand but faith
[45:52] cannot be separated from the knowledge
[45:54] of the truth you shall know the truth
[45:56] and the truth shall make you free we
[45:57] cannot take our faith and try to carve
[45:59] it out and define it as being something
[46:01] that always languages in the unknown
[46:07] that faith is just kind of always
[46:09] and we're always making excuses for
[46:11] right we're always trying to justify
[46:12] well it just kind of languishes there
[46:14] and this in this space that's cloudy and
[46:17] hazy and you just don't know you're not
[46:19] sure that's not really true faith isn't
[46:21] faith burly
[46:23] i mean aren't we told it has hair on its
[46:25] chest
[46:26] i mean that's that's there's something
[46:28] to faith
[46:30] it's called an evidence and a substance
[46:32] and you say well faith is the evidence
[46:34] of things hoped for now when we take
[46:36] that scripture faith is the evidence of
[46:37] things uh as a substance of things hoped
[46:40] for the hope is based in scripture
[46:44] it's not that i i hope to find a
[46:46] lamborghini next to the
[46:48] the suburban tonight and there's keys
[46:50] that have my name on it or a vanity
[46:51] plate that says for aaron mcgeary i'm
[46:53] like oh i'm open for this
[46:55] i mean
[46:56] faith is the evidence of things hoped
[46:58] for the substance of things hoped for
[47:00] the evidence of things not seen but
[47:02] that's not just something to where we
[47:03] kind of take this and build ourselves
[47:05] into some kind of
[47:07] fervor over something that has no basis
[47:11] even the faith and the evidence that the
[47:13] substance and the evidence that faith
[47:14] stands for still comes back to promises
[47:20] faith is the substance of scriptural
[47:22] promises that we believe in and we're
[47:24] hoping for faith is the evidence of
[47:27] things not seen but yet we've been told
[47:28] they will be it's not that we're just
[47:30] saying oh i've got faith that you know
[47:32] this is going to happen that's going to
[47:34] happen
[47:37] so if you if you think about even the
[47:39] faith that we're instructed to have
[47:43] and the
[47:45] in even how it kind of works in our
[47:47] everyday life
[47:49] we we we have this um concept of just
[47:52] something that is an act of faith right
[47:55] we just do it it's an act of faith
[47:57] and and in that it's almost as if it
[48:00] operates subconsciously
[48:03] and we do it all the time when we go to
[48:05] start our car right
[48:08] and and how is it an act of faith when
[48:11] we put the key in the ignition which i
[48:12] guess we used to do in another decade
[48:14] when we we push the button
[48:17] or we tell alexa start my car however it
[48:20] is we start our car now
[48:22] what is it why is it an act of faith
[48:25] because you expect it to start
[48:28] but why do you expect it to start
[48:31] because it has before
[48:33] because it always does
[48:36] you sit in the car and you push the
[48:37] button the car starts up
[48:39] so you have reason to believe when you
[48:42] push that button it's gonna start
[48:44] it's not going to the junkyard and
[48:46] finding a car that's all hollowed out
[48:49] no windows no tires
[48:51] you haven't checked under the hood and
[48:53] you sit down in the seat and you go
[48:54] watch this
[48:57] what's happening here you
[48:59] but it's your experience
[49:01] that every time you push the button
[49:03] every time you turn the ignition it
[49:05] starts that's an act of faith because
[49:07] you have reason to believe it's based
[49:09] upon experience this is what happens
[49:11] when you do this
[49:13] and for some of us our car doesn't start
[49:15] and we didn't expect it to start why
[49:17] experience
[49:19] doesn't start on mornings like this or
[49:21] i've been having problems with the
[49:22] starter
[49:24] but jesus is telling us that you shall
[49:26] know the truth and the truth shall make
[49:27] you free knowledge
[49:29] cannot be separated from faith
[49:32] first timothy chapter 2 verse 4
[49:34] speaking of the
[49:36] one mediator between god and men who
[49:37] will have all men to be saved and to
[49:40] come unto the knowledge of the truth
[49:45] that he would desire that we would be
[49:47] saved but in salvation it's not just to
[49:49] kind of keep us in this state of
[49:52] it's it's to come to a knowledge of the
[49:54] truth
[49:56] to come to the knowledge of the truth
[49:57] it's something that is known something
[49:58] that's been tested something that's been
[49:59] proven something that's been vindicated
[50:03] this is what god desires us you shall
[50:05] know the truth that our faith would not
[50:06] be separate from the knowledge of the
[50:08] truth and that in knowing the truth
[50:10] truth would make us free and god desires
[50:12] that we would come under the knowledge
[50:14] of the truth in john chapter 16 verses
[50:16] 12 to 15 i have yet many things to say
[50:19] unto you but you cannot bear them now
[50:21] how be it when he the spirit of truth is
[50:24] come he will guide you into all truth
[50:29] notice there's something that is faith
[50:31] is being synonymous with or faith is
[50:33] joined to that you cannot separate it
[50:35] from
[50:38] for he shall not speak of himself but
[50:39] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[50:41] speak and he will show you things to
[50:43] come
[50:46] he's going to guide you in all truth
[50:48] he's going to show you things to come
[50:49] this is this is this is what makes faith
[50:52] stronger and stronger
[50:54] you have reason to believe and then you
[50:56] have more more and more more more more
[50:57] more
[50:58] he shall glorify me for he shall receive
[51:01] of mine and shall show it unto you
[51:05] all things that the father hath are mine
[51:06] therefore said i i said i that he shall
[51:09] take of mine and shall show it unto you
[51:14] this is how that we come into the
[51:15] knowledge of all truth
[51:18] is it shown unto us there's something
[51:20] that's disclosed something that's quick
[51:21] and something that we see so that our
[51:23] faith is not based upon hearsay and our
[51:26] faith is not based upon something
[51:28] without reason but that we have a
[51:30] resting place and a solid foundation
[51:32] that i believe and that in believing
[51:35] there is a there is a coming into the
[51:37] knowledge of truth and our faith is
[51:39] based upon the knowledge of something
[51:41] that is real that has been tested and
[51:42] that has been proven
[51:46] i'd like to make this quick example how
[51:48] the old testament scriptures
[51:51] and i had originally
[51:54] planned to go through several of the
[51:56] scriptures
[51:57] i just don't know if it's going to have
[51:58] time to do it tonight
[52:01] but
[52:02] so i didn't i didn't take some of these
[52:04] scriptures and piece them together i
[52:05] just want to make reference to them very
[52:06] quickly and jotted down these
[52:07] definitions in the old testament there's
[52:09] scriptures many scriptures in the old
[52:11] testament just the language of the old
[52:12] testament
[52:13] show that faith relates to truth
[52:16] against something known something
[52:18] understood
[52:20] and
[52:23] i think i mean if you just if you just
[52:25] ponder that isn't isn't that what real
[52:27] trust is and faith is is it's
[52:30] you
[52:31] you there's some it's a known commodity
[52:36] it's
[52:37] i could even say that tonight as i
[52:38] minister
[52:40] you are willing to follow what i'm
[52:42] saying
[52:43] because you trust me and you know what
[52:46] i've been saying uh maybe even more than
[52:48] 12 months but if someone you had no idea
[52:51] who they were where they came from what
[52:53] their background was and they began to
[52:55] use these statements and talk there
[52:57] might be a party that begins to say
[52:58] where is he going with this
[53:00] is he going into intellect or is he
[53:01] going into it some other evidence-based
[53:04] thing or is he where is he trying to
[53:05] pull us
[53:06] and it would be the lack of knowledge
[53:08] that would give you the the uh an
[53:10] insecurity and unwillingness to really
[53:13] give your trust over
[53:16] and it would be a very it would be a
[53:18] very difficult argument and i find that
[53:20] now the kind of the doors are kind of
[53:21] opening up and it's kind of wanting to
[53:23] spill me over into so much of what's my
[53:25] inspiration but if if someone says well
[53:27] you just have to trust me
[53:29] just trust me on this
[53:31] um
[53:33] i guess it would either it had to be
[53:34] some circumstance where it's look it's
[53:36] i'm either dead or i just do what he's
[53:37] asking me to do and i might as well give
[53:39] it a shot
[53:40] but that would be really that wouldn't
[53:41] be a real uh fair thing to do to say
[53:43] just trust me because even jesus would
[53:45] say if you can't believe me for what i'm
[53:47] saying believe me for my works
[53:51] so he's saying that search the
[53:52] scriptures
[53:54] if you don't want to take me at my word
[53:55] search the scriptures for you believe
[53:57] that you have you have an inheritance
[53:59] and eternal life by the scripture and if
[54:01] you search the scripture you'd find that
[54:02] the scriptures written beforehand that
[54:04] you believe in are testifying of me and
[54:06] he was willing to point them to evidence
[54:08] willing to point them to a basis of
[54:10] conviction and their faith to say look
[54:12] you guys believe the prophets go read
[54:13] what the prophet said and examine my
[54:15] life by it and see if you can't tell
[54:17] that it matches exactly what they said
[54:20] believe me for my work's sake he said if
[54:22] you can't just believe me in the things
[54:24] that i'm saying that line up in
[54:25] scripture saying that i'm also doing
[54:27] things that should comport with your
[54:28] faith and conviction of what the messiah
[54:30] would do and so jesus didn't even
[54:32] himself show up and say just listen to
[54:33] me just just
[54:35] just accept what i'm trying to say
[54:38] again i hope you say very
[54:40] labor to stay very very close to my
[54:42] intent i i realize that maybe there's a
[54:45] this is something where you have to stay
[54:47] very focused i think even brother
[54:48] branham says teaching can be very
[54:49] treacherous because you're trying to lay
[54:51] down something and it's easy for maybe
[54:53] the mind just to kind of wonder or kind
[54:55] of go this way don't assume don't assume
[54:58] anything
[54:59] uh anything that i haven't said i'd be
[55:01] very careful not to assume it and then
[55:03] also
[55:04] i would i would say don't make the
[55:05] mistake of assuming that i haven't
[55:07] studied this out and i don't know what
[55:08] i'm talking about
[55:11] and i don't i don't say that as a threat
[55:13] i'm just saying
[55:14] i'm being very deliberate not to go into
[55:16] too much but say enough to get ourselves
[55:18] thinking so the old testament language
[55:21] that would makes faith
[55:24] connected with truth there's two words
[55:26] used for faith and truth
[55:29] in the old testament umuna and emmet
[55:32] and so in the old testament you have
[55:34] faith and truth that are words that we
[55:35] read in our english language but words
[55:37] that are used
[55:40] and they're also often interchangeable
[55:42] in some versions or renditions of the
[55:43] old testament
[55:45] and this imunna and emmet both come from
[55:48] the same root among and so actually
[55:50] jack's middle name is emmett and this is
[55:51] part of where we get it from is this
[55:53] emmet which is truth
[55:55] and it comes from the same root in the
[55:57] scripture of amman which means firmness
[56:00] certainty
[56:01] reliability translated to faithfulness
[56:03] and this so this is this is faithfulness
[56:05] and reliability and certainty so even
[56:08] faith and truth are almost synonymous
[56:10] and interchangeable in the old testament
[56:13] and true faith is like truth
[56:16] it is something sure
[56:19] it is something certain true faith is
[56:21] like truth it's not hazy it's not
[56:23] mystical it's not imaginative it's not
[56:25] hope so true faith is like truth it is
[56:28] sure it is certain it is real
[56:30] and so this is i i may just skip several
[56:33] scriptures that we had tonight
[56:35] this is and i'll try to maybe draw to
[56:36] this close faith is not blind trust
[56:41] is their title is blind trust bad faith
[56:45] faith is not blind trust
[56:48] and so when you are asked to believe
[56:50] something he said just believe just
[56:52] accept it don't doubt
[56:54] then then
[56:56] it begs the question upon what basis
[57:00] like what are you asking me to just
[57:02] believe
[57:04] uh what is what is it your what is it
[57:05] you're trying to get me to accept
[57:08] and and what
[57:10] apprehension are you wanting me now to
[57:12] relinquish and get rid of
[57:14] because there's sometimes it seems as if
[57:16] oppressed where you just have to accept
[57:17] it you just have to believe it and
[57:20] and you shouldn't doubt it
[57:23] and
[57:24] this there has to be you say well what
[57:28] context am i being asked to believe it
[57:31] what am i being asked to accept what is
[57:33] it that uh what is what doubt is it
[57:35] you're asking me to resolve and to
[57:37] relinquish and so was just saying that
[57:39] and i think that kind of provokes the
[57:41] thought process for for all of us we're
[57:42] kind of like okay wow all right
[57:44] uh where are we going because oftentimes
[57:46] that's even what we're challenged to do
[57:48] just accept it
[57:50] but would you go to somebody if you
[57:52] would go to somebody today who you find
[57:55] has just been in a car accident
[57:58] and they find themselves unable to
[58:00] breathe and you think that maybe they've
[58:01] had a punctured lung and you say i'm a
[58:03] christian i'm going to pray for it just
[58:05] believe it and accept it and they're
[58:06] like i'm an atheist
[58:09] right you know
[58:10] he'd be like well you're gonna have
[58:11] there's some there's a context there's a
[58:13] basis there to be like well you might
[58:15] have to be doing this on your own faith
[58:16] now
[58:17] right
[58:18] and so the exact what's the context that
[58:21] someone is being challenged and i say
[58:22] it's because oftentimes people are
[58:24] challenged to accept it and believe that
[58:26] we kind of witness the challenge oh
[58:27] that's right buddy you better believe
[58:28] and accept it and we don't know the
[58:30] links to which god has proven and
[58:32] vindicated their presence with that
[58:34] person and it's a matter of them
[58:36] remembering and and realizing and
[58:38] recognizing i believe for a reason and i
[58:41] have no reason to stop believing now
[58:45] so the challenge has context and the
[58:48] and the the the encouragement to just
[58:50] believe and just accept it and so
[58:52] there's then there's times we're asking
[58:53] somebody to accept something and we
[58:55] haven't given them any basis or reason
[58:56] to do it
[58:58] and it's in this if i and i feel so good
[59:02] just being able to offer that as
[59:04] uh allude to it so it's in that dynamic
[59:08] to where we kind of get this idea that
[59:09] faith is always just accepted just
[59:11] believe it don't doubt and it's it's rid
[59:13] of context
[59:16] and it doesn't have it it hasn't formed
[59:19] the basis
[59:20] of faith having been built
[59:22] reason been given
[59:24] then misunderstood faith can often lead
[59:27] to us accepting lies as truth
[59:31] because we don't understand faith the
[59:33] mechanics of faith we don't understand
[59:34] what faith is and we get in our mind
[59:35] that faith is just accepting something
[59:37] without question and faith is just
[59:38] accepting something and trying to quiet
[59:40] the doubt or something like that and so
[59:42] we kind of find that this is what faith
[59:43] is and if we get in the habit of making
[59:45] that faith then we get in the habit
[59:48] of not using discernment
[59:50] and there comes a time that someone is
[59:52] suggesting
[59:54] that they're kind of saying
[59:56] here's the word you should take this but
[59:58] instead they hand you something totally
[1:00:00] different
[1:00:02] right you're like brother aaron brings
[1:00:04] his phone to the pulpit yeah you know do
[1:00:06] you know that the crypto market never
[1:00:07] closes
[1:00:09] i mean you've got to be
[1:00:10] you got to have your alerts set
[1:00:12] i bring it up here for the clock
[1:00:14] and for songs
[1:00:17] so i know the words and
[1:00:19] don't do what brother michael did the
[1:00:20] other day and bail on a song like you
[1:00:22] know start singing like i don't know the
[1:00:24] words to this song i'm just gonna start
[1:00:25] humming
[1:00:27] he's gone right when i
[1:00:28] really want to probably not even hear
[1:00:30] that because he doesn't string but well
[1:00:32] his poor wife is about redder than he
[1:00:34] would be so i feel bad now
[1:00:37] but in doing that and we just kind of go
[1:00:40] we just take oh well thanks for the word
[1:00:43] right and it's not
[1:00:44] because what have we kind of gotten into
[1:00:46] this habit of
[1:00:48] just taking someone at their word
[1:00:50] really it's a real danger with um when
[1:00:53] christianity becomes a lot of pastor
[1:00:54] worship
[1:00:57] and it's the pastor the pastor the
[1:00:58] pastor ordained to see you through and
[1:01:00] get behind your pastor and believe your
[1:01:01] pastor and so what happens is you get to
[1:01:04] where it's always the pastor right the
[1:01:05] pastor the pastor passed whatever he
[1:01:07] says goes and you get in that dynamic in
[1:01:09] that mode and then one day because of
[1:01:11] that pastor's own something begins to
[1:01:14] deviate and takes a step away from the
[1:01:15] word and you're kind of like
[1:01:18] uh
[1:01:20] are you sure
[1:01:21] i'm the pastor
[1:01:22] it's going oh you're right sorry
[1:01:25] right
[1:01:28] and and because of that
[1:01:30] we begin to engage in a particular way
[1:01:33] to where we become susceptible
[1:01:36] to just believing things
[1:01:39] without reason
[1:01:42] and having the wrong concept of faith
[1:01:44] can make us very susceptible to
[1:01:45] gullibility
[1:01:51] this is awesome because i'm not gonna be
[1:01:52] able to finish i feel like i got half my
[1:01:53] sermon for next time already
[1:01:58] but in different instances in the
[1:01:59] scripture
[1:02:02] in jude in colossians and timothy
[1:02:07] and i like to read these at a future
[1:02:09] time but this will be good just to just
[1:02:10] to mention them now
[1:02:12] that the believers ask to contend for
[1:02:14] the faith
[1:02:17] and says do it because there's people
[1:02:19] who come in
[1:02:20] and are trying to confuse the faith
[1:02:23] he says that paul says you should be
[1:02:25] established in the faith he says be
[1:02:27] careful because there's people who try
[1:02:28] to spoil you through philosophy
[1:02:30] and vain deceit
[1:02:32] and there's these instances in scripture
[1:02:36] where the faith is being lifted up the
[1:02:38] faith is being lifted up and in context
[1:02:40] of it it's saying and there's those are
[1:02:42] going to really try to confuse you on
[1:02:43] this matter
[1:02:45] and i'll go ahead and read it in 2nd
[1:02:46] timothy chapter 3 verses 1 to 8 this
[1:02:48] know also that in the last days perilous
[1:02:50] times shall come
[1:02:51] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:02:53] selves covetous boasters proud
[1:02:55] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:02:56] unthankful unholy without natural
[1:02:58] affection truce breakers false accusers
[1:03:00] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[1:03:02] that are good traitors heady high-minded
[1:03:04] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[1:03:06] god lewd fellows of the base resort
[1:03:10] this is
[1:03:12] quite a crowd there
[1:03:16] and then it says having a form of
[1:03:18] godliness
[1:03:20] that these these things can be covered
[1:03:23] in religion these things can be covered
[1:03:25] up by this form of goddesses but denying
[1:03:28] the power thereof what is the power
[1:03:30] it is the gospel it is the power of
[1:03:32] revelation is the power of
[1:03:33] transformation they have a form of
[1:03:35] goddess but they've denied the power of
[1:03:37] the mystery of godliness they didn't
[1:03:38] they they have what seems to be the
[1:03:40] gospel or the truth but they don't hold
[1:03:42] the mystery of the faith
[1:03:45] having a form of guidance but denying
[1:03:47] the power thereof he says from such turn
[1:03:49] away so he says for of this sort the
[1:03:52] lewd fellows of a baser sword are they
[1:03:53] which creep into houses and lead captive
[1:03:57] silly women laden with sins they
[1:03:59] capitalize on the guilt of these women
[1:04:02] and their desire to be right in them
[1:04:04] being compromised maybe a broken
[1:04:06] marriage maybe a sinful past maybe just
[1:04:07] a desire to please god in plague with
[1:04:09] doubt and unbelief these types of people
[1:04:12] will lead these women who are foolish
[1:04:14] considered silly lead them astray
[1:04:17] because of their own sincerity and
[1:04:18] weaknesses and lead them away with
[1:04:20] diverse lusts
[1:04:23] so there's some stilling of some
[1:04:25] gullibility that allows them to
[1:04:26] capitalize and mislead these women and
[1:04:29] then this is their marker ever learning
[1:04:33] more and more knowledge more and more
[1:04:34] this more and more that but they never
[1:04:36] come to the knowledge of the truth
[1:04:39] we cannot let we cannot learn uh
[1:04:43] confuse scholarship
[1:04:45] and intellect
[1:04:47] and skill with words and the ability to
[1:04:50] set things forth or even the sheer
[1:04:53] enormity
[1:04:54] of the number of quotes that can be read
[1:04:58] has been any sort of indication of true
[1:05:00] knowledge of the truth
[1:05:05] those things conform ever learning can
[1:05:07] form
[1:05:12] an image
[1:05:14] or an impersonation of godliness but not
[1:05:16] be the power of it
[1:05:18] ever learning and never able to come to
[1:05:19] the knowledge of the truth now as janice
[1:05:21] and jammers with did moses so do these
[1:05:23] also resist the truth
[1:05:27] men of corrupt minds reprobate
[1:05:29] concerning
[1:05:31] the faith
[1:05:32] not proved
[1:05:35] not standing the test
[1:05:37] they don't hold the mystery of the rep
[1:05:39] they're bankrupt concerning the mystery
[1:05:42] of the faith because they're reprobate
[1:05:44] concerning it
[1:05:46] they're they they can speak things they
[1:05:48] can say things they can express things
[1:05:50] there's things that could be connected
[1:05:51] maybe tied together and there's a way
[1:05:53] that things could be presented as i've
[1:05:55] said before there's a way that satan
[1:05:57] could present things as truth but in
[1:05:59] reality it is not truth though it may be
[1:06:01] radiating it seemed to be with the light
[1:06:04] but it's just a glitter
[1:06:07] and as i close i i want to choose my
[1:06:10] words very carefully because i want to
[1:06:12] express my heart realizing that
[1:06:15] we'll have service together on sunday
[1:06:16] but next wednesday night brother reggie
[1:06:18] plett is going to be speaking
[1:06:21] and and
[1:06:23] and i may not have time to come back to
[1:06:25] this for a couple weeks
[1:06:28] but there is something there's something
[1:06:30] very pure for the believer and i mean i
[1:06:32] want this to be very real in your
[1:06:33] mindset because i mean there's something
[1:06:35] very pure
[1:06:37] about us taking god at his word
[1:06:41] that there is something very precious
[1:06:43] for a believer
[1:06:45] to believe what he says
[1:06:48] that's something that's very very
[1:06:49] precious
[1:06:51] and it's so precious that it must be
[1:06:53] guarded
[1:06:55] and this is where
[1:06:58] to the things i've mentioned
[1:07:00] in no way
[1:07:01] would i want to diminish real faith
[1:07:04] genuine faith
[1:07:05] genuine trust
[1:07:06] genuine abandonment to christ
[1:07:10] but understand the basis in the genesis
[1:07:13] of our faith
[1:07:15] toward now with this precious faith
[1:07:17] toward now knowing him
[1:07:19] and being convinced of the nature of god
[1:07:21] i can trust him implicitly completely
[1:07:24] totally
[1:07:26] that is such a precious thing that we
[1:07:27] must guard it
[1:07:29] and we should never misplace that kind
[1:07:31] of faith
[1:07:33] that faith that you have in god you
[1:07:35] should never put in me as a pastor
[1:07:40] but you're your very confidence that i
[1:07:43] can be a pastor and lead you properly
[1:07:47] is strengthened by your confidence in
[1:07:50] god's promise to you
[1:07:52] not to me
[1:07:56] i could just tell you my whole life
[1:07:57] story and convince you that wow god must
[1:07:59] be with brother aaron i'm so glad we're
[1:08:00] all here
[1:08:02] and at the end of the day i could just
[1:08:04] make you really really good followers of
[1:08:06] me
[1:08:07] until you have your own extraordinary
[1:08:09] testimony
[1:08:11] and say i know god well enough
[1:08:13] that though everyone around me fall i
[1:08:16] know where i stand with him
[1:08:18] and therefore i'm not being propped up
[1:08:20] in my relationship with christ by how
[1:08:22] dynamic the church services are how
[1:08:24] beautiful the building is i think we've
[1:08:26] all proven hey
[1:08:27] right we're not here because we're all
[1:08:29] hilton diamond members we're here
[1:08:31] because we love the word and that you
[1:08:33] have a personal experience with christ
[1:08:35] in it the word is feeding you but i'm
[1:08:37] cautioning against this dynamic that
[1:08:38] often exists within religions and
[1:08:41] and things the personality cults where
[1:08:43] it all becomes a lot about one man's
[1:08:45] testimony one man's witness and no
[1:08:48] matter how dynamic that is and no matter
[1:08:50] how much god has vindicated his presence
[1:08:51] with him god wants you to have your own
[1:08:54] personal experience so you can say that
[1:08:56] i know the god of abraham isaac and
[1:09:00] jacob
[1:09:02] and it's so precious that we should
[1:09:04] never take this faith that we put in god
[1:09:06] alone and that we place in the word
[1:09:08] alone and then somehow allow that to get
[1:09:10] misdirected
[1:09:12] so now we're using the same dynamic we
[1:09:14] would use with the word because we have
[1:09:15] reason
[1:09:18] and then do that with other things when
[1:09:19] we have no reason
[1:09:21] in other words our faith should never
[1:09:22] become blind trust
[1:09:25] because if our faith ever becomes blind
[1:09:27] trust our testimonies in bad faith
[1:09:32] what you think about that if your faith
[1:09:35] really is just blind trust
[1:09:37] then your testimony will be in bad faith
[1:09:41] unless really what you want to do is
[1:09:43] just tell everybody hey look i don't get
[1:09:45] it i don't understand it but
[1:09:47] just accept it just trust me on this
[1:09:50] just believe what i'm telling you
[1:09:52] and that's going to be the basis upon
[1:09:53] which you want people to live the life
[1:09:55] that you've been living
[1:09:57] but when you know that you know
[1:10:00] and it's faith
[1:10:04] then your testimony is real
[1:10:09] we we are coming to a place where we
[1:10:11] ought to have supreme faith
[1:10:17] let that
[1:10:18] become something that anchors in your
[1:10:20] mind we use perfect faith
[1:10:22] supreme faith
[1:10:24] brother brahm says you cannot have that
[1:10:26] faith
[1:10:27] until you know perfectly what you are
[1:10:28] doing
[1:10:31] i think sometimes we have a definition
[1:10:33] of faith that is the exact opposite of
[1:10:35] that
[1:10:37] is what are you doing
[1:10:38] i don't know
[1:10:40] but i but i have faith
[1:10:43] but you can't have supreme faith
[1:10:46] until you know perfectly what you're
[1:10:48] doing
[1:10:50] i believe we're coming to an hour where
[1:10:51] we ought to have perfect faith
[1:10:53] and let everything accumulate up
[1:10:56] coming to a place now as believers to
[1:10:57] where we have reason to be steadfast in
[1:11:00] this
[1:11:01] we're not just here on a whim we're not
[1:11:02] just here because our parents are
[1:11:03] dragging us by our ear we're not here
[1:11:05] because
[1:11:06] we don't have any anywhere else that we
[1:11:08] would want to be or what we could do but
[1:11:09] we're here because we have faith and we
[1:11:12] have reason to believe what we've
[1:11:13] believed let's stand together this
[1:11:15] evening
[1:11:22] please
[1:11:23] accept
[1:11:24] this disclaimer
[1:11:26] this is just the start of me getting all
[1:11:28] the pieces of the puzzle on the table
[1:11:31] i mentioned it before i have a
[1:11:32] philosophy when it comes to putting
[1:11:34] together a puzzle
[1:11:36] it's first get all the puzzle pieces on
[1:11:38] the table
[1:11:39] and then it's turn all the puzzle pieces
[1:11:42] face up
[1:11:43] and then it separate all the border
[1:11:45] pieces
[1:11:46] and then once you get all the border
[1:11:48] pieces separated you can begin to build
[1:11:50] your border but then at that point you
[1:11:52] begin to combine like elements together
[1:11:55] is this instructive for you maybe i
[1:11:56] could put together a puzzle class we
[1:11:58] could do a little
[1:11:59] uh little workshop and a breakout
[1:12:01] session on putting together puzzles
[1:12:04] but there's it and so in some ways
[1:12:06] that's what i'm doing tonight in looking
[1:12:08] at this
[1:12:09] subject
[1:12:10] is let's
[1:12:12] i'm looking at a picture maybe you don't
[1:12:14] see it
[1:12:15] but i'm just trying to get all my pieces
[1:12:16] out there
[1:12:18] and if you feel that brother aaron you
[1:12:19] seem to be a little bit too much
[1:12:21] balanced on uh maybe the the the knowing
[1:12:23] aspect and the understanding aspect and
[1:12:26] in having reason
[1:12:28] and you think about these other elements
[1:12:29] to where we believe god we take him at
[1:12:31] his word and we just trust him
[1:12:34] i i want you to just consider
[1:12:37] that
[1:12:38] that
[1:12:39] the admonishment to trust god and accept
[1:12:41] him is not without basis
[1:12:46] and that's really what i'm referring to
[1:12:47] when i talk about reason
[1:12:50] and evidence
[1:12:51] and conviction and truth and knowledge
[1:12:54] is that what
[1:12:56] we know by revelation we want to also
[1:12:58] know by experience
[1:13:01] and yes the revelation of it is
[1:13:03] beautiful
[1:13:05] but in in in believing that
[1:13:08] and really having that revelation
[1:13:12] don't you make preparation for it
[1:13:15] god ever reveals something to you
[1:13:17] you make preparation for it
[1:13:19] so then it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna
[1:13:21] come to a place of confirmation and
[1:13:23] vindication and truth let's bow our
[1:13:25] heads this evening
[1:13:29] [Music]
[1:13:32] our gracious heavenly father tonight as
[1:13:34] we close this service
[1:13:39] we are
[1:13:43] we're grateful lord
[1:13:47] that we had an instinct
[1:13:52] a gift a god-given gift a manifestation
[1:13:54] of grace in our lives
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:13:57] that when we heard the word
[1:14:01] say follow me
[1:14:04] that something struck deep within our
[1:14:06] hearts
[1:14:08] and upon that basis that beginning
[1:14:12] we we made a step towards you
[1:14:17] things were confirmed in our hearts and
[1:14:19] it felt as if something was being
[1:14:20] disclosed to us that transcended human
[1:14:23] experience and human knowledge and
[1:14:25] upon that basis we walked in obedience
[1:14:27] to the word
[1:14:30] and we're so grateful lord
[1:14:34] that you have not asked us to continue
[1:14:36] in this experience
[1:14:38] [Music]
[1:14:42] and this walk this christian walk
[1:14:45] solely on that one experience that we
[1:14:48] had so many years ago
[1:14:52] but there has been a constant and
[1:14:54] continual confirmation of your presence
[1:14:56] in our lives
[1:14:58] yes lord we acknowledge tonight
[1:15:00] difficult times hard times there was
[1:15:02] times when you
[1:15:03] withdrew yourself it seemed and you
[1:15:05] challenged us and you were
[1:15:06] you were challenges on our experience
[1:15:08] and you were asking us to take you at
[1:15:10] your word and we were having to believe
[1:15:12] without emotion and without any sight of
[1:15:15] anything coming but
[1:15:16] we weren't
[1:15:18] we weren't unbelievers lord we weren't
[1:15:22] deniers of the faith
[1:15:26] we had reason to trust you we had reason
[1:15:28] to believe
[1:15:30] lord i'm grateful that tonight that as
[1:15:32] we read the story of thomas
[1:15:34] though he may be a doubting thomas and
[1:15:36] though
[1:15:36] there is a blessedness for those like us
[1:15:39] who have not seen the resurrected christ
[1:15:41] and touched him and handled him we still
[1:15:43] believe the witness and the testimony of
[1:15:45] scripture
[1:15:47] but even with thomas
[1:15:49] he was ordained to life and being
[1:15:51] ordained to life
[1:15:54] you gave him a personal experience
[1:15:58] and i pray lord that for those of us who
[1:16:01] may be young in this faith
[1:16:03] that you would continue to confirm your
[1:16:05] presence with us
[1:16:08] that we could have solid footing and a a
[1:16:10] a a conviction and a steadfastness
[1:16:13] [Music]
[1:16:15] lord i pray that we as believers could
[1:16:17] recognize that the faith that we have
[1:16:19] and the strength of it is that it is in
[1:16:20] truth
[1:16:22] something unchangeable immutable
[1:16:24] something that has not varied with time
[1:16:30] lord i believe that the truths that we
[1:16:31] hold the things that we have deep within
[1:16:34] our hearts that if you were to take away
[1:16:35] all of our
[1:16:36] history books and take away all of our
[1:16:41] knowledge and the bible
[1:16:45] that what we what we know to be true
[1:16:48] would remain true forevermore
[1:16:52] but when it comes to science
[1:16:56] science has a history lord
[1:16:59] that even what they believe to be
[1:17:00] absolutely true today could be changed
[1:17:03] tomorrow
[1:17:05] and so lord if i'm going to be honest as
[1:17:07] a scientist i really don't know
[1:17:10] but as a christian i can
[1:17:12] i pray that you give us that solid foot
[1:17:14] and that deep conviction to know you in
[1:17:16] a personal way
[1:17:17] and help us lord to not engage in blind
[1:17:20] trust
[1:17:21] but i i just poured out my heart before
[1:17:24] you before the people as i prayed just
[1:17:26] so that there wouldn't be any confusion
[1:17:28] lord we have faith and faith isn't
[1:17:30] always guided by our senses
[1:17:33] but that doesn't mean it's blind
[1:17:36] and lord we trust you and sometimes we
[1:17:38] trust you that you're going to do
[1:17:39] something absent from any evidence that
[1:17:41] would tell us that it is going to be but
[1:17:43] that trust
[1:17:45] isn't blind because we have a reason to
[1:17:47] believe that you'll do it there's some
[1:17:48] basis for us to accept that you would
[1:17:55] i pray father that you will
[1:17:57] help us in this subject matter and keep
[1:17:59] things
[1:18:01] straight in the believer's heart lord i
[1:18:02] realize i'm pouring a lot of stuff out
[1:18:04] there to provoke thought but maybe a
[1:18:05] blessing and a benefit to the believer
[1:18:07] today i ask these things in the lord
[1:18:09] jesus christ
[1:18:11] amen
[1:18:12] thank you for your patience tonight
[1:18:14] i trust that you could just kind of hold
[1:18:16] that some of these things in your heart
[1:18:18] and just ponder them
[1:18:19] ponder them maybe don't draw any
[1:18:21] conclusions if you're struggling with
[1:18:22] the direction but just ponder them
[1:18:24] god bless you
