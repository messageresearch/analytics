TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but our title is a matter of faith and our subtitle is invisible dimensions and i really just want to take this opportunity tonight to visit uh some of the ways that brother branham lays out these dimensions and then just get us to consider just how much faith uh relates to that and even how some of these dimensions are contacted through certain means and that's the same way that our faith is working so this series we know is kind of working together with what we've been teaching on divine healing it's been on sunday mornings and i would like to maybe pick up some other things that we discussed on augmented reality but i just i don't want to belabor it too much but we've been using the principle that faith is a greater way of seeing the world it's a different way of interacting in the world so we're in this world with natural abilities but yet faith is a supernatural ability to conduct ourselves within the same natural world and using that sense of augmented reality we and how with augmented reality technology imposes another layer of information over what you're seeing or experiencing and faith enhances our real world experience by adding a layer of information from divine sources and that's a beautiful way to live with augmented reality and there's a lot of different types and examples and different ones have shared with me tools that they utilize within their practice or their line of work that kind of augment their reality to help them do certain things that they otherwise wouldn't be able to do with their five senses and i think that's that's what the sixth sense faith is to do now if we'll just look back at the scriptures we read as it says in ephesians chapter 3 verse 17 that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith so this must be an indwelling by faith the dwelling by the new birth that ye being rooted and grounded in love so there's a foundation there's a basis and this is his prayer this is what he's praying that ye may be able to comprehend with all saints this is the comprehension this is the grasping this is an understanding what is the breadth and that word speaks of the extent of something just how large it is and then he describes and length and depth and height and could it could appear to be describing four dimensions but this word breadth there is just just how vast it actually is so maybe it speaks to context and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ and so i think the phrase in here is beautiful he wants us to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge so it's even a paradox and what he wants he wants us to know something that really can't be known he wants us to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of god and so this must be something beyond human intellect beyond human understanding and a fullness that relates to the strengthening of the inner man and christ dwelling in our hearts by faith now in verse 18 i want to i provided a slide just to highlight these words the length depth and height in verse 18. and we touched on this in the first part i think we've alluded to some of these things in the second part and so tonight we're just repeating ourselves and adding more to it in a way just to make this part of the record and there's things that i i desire to things that come up in inspiration and you want to preach and go oh well i've preached that already or man i really preached i did a whole series on this a few years ago and in my carnal mind these things being very uh things that are very well known or that we understand and i know different ones who know these things we fellowship on these things know people who've been faithfully taught these things and you kind of want to just maybe not revisit it but then you realize there's a whole generation of young people who may have never heard it and it doesn't take but just a few years before there's a young people who are listening and understanding who need the principles of the word of god taught to them and so i would ask if there's at any point any man of god that stands behind this desk we believe we have confidence in the holy spirit and so if they're ministering something and speaking on something like wow that's you know that's really simple god sent a prophet or wow we already know uh that of this part and that part realize there's those who all there's always someone who needs that and there's things to be taught and brought to our remembrance and i think even sometimes things are preached just to challenge us in our response and so we let's always have confidence that god is dealing with our hearts and so this length depth and height describe the three dimensions that all physical things exist within as you see here in verse 18 the length the depth and the height we can pull that slide up and and just hold it there as we consider paul describing this and we may have used this term a few weeks ago on spatial dimension that what paul is doing he's actually describing things in a scientific way or in a way that you might have heard in your physics class where length depth and height describe space and they would define from any any point any particular point a physical point there are three directions that we can move within and that's called space you move within space and it's up down left right forward backward and you say well that sounds like more that's just one direction up down left right and forward backward and movement in any direction can be defined or described expressed in these terms and so paul's saying the length and the depth and the height he's describing our three-dimensional existence and things that would exist within space and it is our five senses that give us the ability to perceive or give us this existence within this space and we could highlight different senses we could actually type show this in slides just to emphasize this but tonight we'll just make reference to the fact that we have these five physical senses that are helping us and make our way through this spatial dimension this three-dimensional space and then time is another element that's added to length and depth and height that's another element that is called in some ways called the fourth dimension uh and it's uh we added to the dimensions of length depth and height are added to those three dimensions of space so it kind of creates a four dimensional existence and time dimension which is very i think it's very awesome scientifically they call it the temporal dimension and it uh and it only moves in one direction and it doesn't exist just at any one singular point but it only exists uh at it exist in this continuum only moving one direction and so scientifically right now they have not been able to prove that you could time travel so that whenever something whenever an object moves and it moves through space it also moves through time so as i as i move i can't i'm moving within time so time is just moving on in one dimension or one continuum and then i can move in all these different ways it kind of creates this four-dimensional model of the time that we live in and one thing that i find interesting from a scientific perspective is that they say that an object uh moves through space and as it moves through space it moves through time and that they call that as it moves through time that's when you perceive changes so they say that time they kind of summarize it this way that time appears to be the force that changes the way things are that time through time is the is the one thing that that that demonstrates uh something to change and and i i was really pulled i was wanting to maybe personally spend a lot more time on this particular aspect but these are very scientific terms and they refer to this time that we're living in science refers to these dimensions as space time and it's a space time is a mathematical model which combines these three dimensions of space the length depth and height and then also time which i think we all understand time so everyone here understand what space is it's what we're in right now what time is it's what you're wanting to go by very quickly maybe for the service to be over and and that's that becomes the four dimensional time the one dimension of time in the three dimensions of of height width and depth or however else you want to describe it scripturally here it's length depth and height that is the essence that forms the space and the dimensions that humans exist within and it's really these things that the human sensory perception is is grasping or catching there's even the sensory perception of time which is part of this which can be a very unique sense but this is how we we get the sense that time is passed we understand movement and travel within this space and so space time describes what science can prove to be our dimensions of existence and then brother branham they call it space time but then brother branham uses a language that describes time space and he says in one place this is just a phrase i grabbed while it's daytime while it's earth and while we are in time space this is brother branham describing it while it's daytime or why it's why we're on earth and while we're in time space he's referring to existence now we're all breathing and we're existing on the earth in time space this time space forms human existence and so that's i i wanted to establish that principle um at the outset now in revelations chapter 2 verse 24 and i'm wanting to use just a phrase from this is but i say unto you and under the rest of thy torah as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden so this is a compliment that there are those who have not held to this wrong doctrine nor known the depths of satan now when he refers when this scripture refers to the depths of satan it implies something that they had not known that maybe others do know or are experiencing but it implies a dimension that's not evident to the five senses alone that just by looking at something you wouldn't think oh that i'm staring into the depths of satan or there's a wormhole into this other dimension uh but so it's referring to a knowledge or experience that maybe is not just uh contacted or understood as paul talks about knowing and and these different things it's not just something on the surface but it's something that has depth the depth of satan and here's two scriptures just to start adding layers to our existence in proverbs chapter 16 verse 2 all the ways of man are clean in his own eyes but the lord wayth the spirits so what our senses perceive are not always the the full reality of things that man looks at something and says oh my ways are clean but then there are spirits that attach to it but that means behind everything there's a spirit motive and objective and that may not be evident on the surface so there's something beneath the surface or below the surface and man's only looking on the exterior but there's something else that god takes into consideration remember the primary example we used in revelations chapter three that were rich were increased with goods and have need of nothing and that was a vantage point of humanity but god had another vantage point that changed their entire condition and proverbs 14 verse 12 there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death if it seems right to a man he probably doesn't think it's going to end in his death so this seemeth right it means on the surface it seems correct or level or straightforward it seems i i'm perceiving there's something there on the surface yeah this looks fine yeah i i can do this but it says that that it is there's a way which seemeth right into a man but then thereof are the ways of death and so it may seem to be one way but there's many different ways that it may lead you to death and so these are things that are not obvious on its face that the bible is speaking to a couple other verses that touch on this proverbs chapter 7 verse 27 speaking of this adulterous woman her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of death and so her house is a way to hell and it says going down to the chambers of death so it's describing the chambers of death as a downward descent it's describing a way and it's a way that may not you're not going to look at her house and there's there's actually stairways down to a basement called hell it's nothing literal but it's implying something at least an allegory or symbolic language that there's a way to help going down proverbs 15 verse 24 the way of life is above to the wise that he may depart from hell beneath so notice what these scriptures are creating they're creating these different levels are other ways of viewing things that we might we might try to categorize or chart out because we're maybe as human beings the way that we understand things is within this height depth and length and we understand height and width and depth and we understand time so we do we want to understand something we try to put it within our dimension and look at it within that framework of time and length and depth and space the same thing when it comes to if i told you that the lord the lord was coming tonight you would start thinking about time what time and then the fact that he's coming you'd think of some poor point of departure and that he has to travel some distance to come because that's just the way if i told you i was coming to your house tonight then you would know that that would take time and i would have to travel distance to do it and so that's just immediately how our minds think but realize god's not bound by those things those things do not limit nor do they fully uh help us to understand what it would mean for the lord to appear to make himself known or to come and so the bible and there's so many different scriptures we could have used i think these are just the most obvious that i think we'd be familiar with to start to realize that there's things that the way of life is above to the wise it's something higher the way of life to the wives is a higher way it's something they they catch or they ascend up into and in doing so they're departing from something that's beneath so a person exists here and the way of life is above to the wise but then the way of hell is from beneath the way to hell is beneath now this is something that that when a statement i'm making i think it's very scientifically sound and yet and though it may need to be proven to some scientist but humans lack the biological ability to perceive higher than three spatial dimensions our human perception is limited to the three-dimensional space and and that's that's our biological limitation now what science is theorizing about and a lot of what comes forth from this fourth dimension of time uh which we could think einstein and that particular time in generation uh for these advancements which that the whole thought on how what science is tapping into brother branham's come along and show it in a spiritual way they're taking things that only exist in a three-dimensional level and they're and they're surmising that well just because we can't perceive it on a biological level maybe there's some way that we can tap into what it really is through some other means and they would argue this by saying that just look had we only limited ourselves to our five senses to what we can biologically perceive with our five senses we would never been able to discover discover an atom which and these things that exist on a molecular level and they exist within space they exist within these three dimensions but it's just so minuscule you need something else you need to harness the energy of something else to magnify that in order to see it and they say so there's things that may not be biologically we can perceive biologically but maybe there's things that are out there that exist in other dimensions that we don't know about and i'm like you think and they say that about dark matter and just how vast the universe is had they had they just relied only on what they could perceive now with their senses they never would have come to understand these other dimensions now i want to go to these slides brother chris if you could just put the first slide up and and i'm just looking at this i apologize if this was hastily put together and so some of our graphic artists and our more uh skilled uh computer people maybe they could start elevating my uh slide game but so i apologize if this is not really uh done well i may try to tilt it just a little bit can you all still see over there uh so brother branham described our realms of existence in different ways and one way he described it as seven dimensions another way he just described it in a trinity above and a trinity below and i'm just going to look at what my slide so yeah the next slide um has that brother branham refers to and in the message the countdown he actually gets into these dimensions so if you've been following up and some of the services have been preached here maybe you've already listened to some of these services that describe this but the realm of mortals are these first three dimensions and they're the dimensions that we exist within right now we exist within light matter and time and we'll we come into some scriptures in a moment to kind of click these things together it's very beautiful but we exist within light modern time that's just uh these are the words that brother branham used uh science uses a similar vernacular when describing kind of what we exist within uh and the concepts of time and even how they're trying to use light uh e equals m c squared relates to a light creating matter and so that we exist within light matter and time but then there's a fourth dimension which we have here which is called science and that's uh the a realm that we don't we can't taste it right we can't really feel it but you can utilize technology to transmit waves unseen waves in that realm and then also receive it and replicate pictures that's what television and radio and the internet and all sorts of wireless technology right now i'm using a wireless mic it's not it's not wired and so it's taking my voice and it's transmitting it to a receiver it's transmitting from here to a receiver that's all taking place in another dimension now that science is pretty awesome right and i still can't get my head around a a record a vinyl disc i mean i i can't understand that let alone some of this other stuff that takes place how they can put grooves in a vinyl disc and then use a needle and it's gonna and record sound and then you could play it back by running a needle over those grooves don't we all agree that that's like witchcraft or something it's sorcery on a science i guess but that's what this realm is it's a scientific realm in a realm that we cannot see feel taste or imagine but it's real it's here and maybe help us understand that again it's like for there's things that when um when the piano was played that's it's sending out sound waves and you hear that and what are you doing you're picking up an invisible wave and that's what creates our our sensory perception of hearing there's some people that can taste chords you ever heard that before go to a piano right now and you can give them a certain chord and they'll tell you by taste what it is and again i don't know if that's sorcery or what it is but uh my brother told me one time that he heard a white van drive by so i guess there's ways that you can actually hear colors and so they just to see how that there's things that our senses pick up on taste is one dimension in a sense one channel hearing's another channel eyesight's another channel feeling is another channel and these are all things that the senses are declaring these things so we have by virtue of science and trust can you see that you can see it here i don't know if my hand motions are adding any greater clarity to anybody who can't see it but then with science this is this again it involves the realm that we're living within and this is usually something that brother brahm teaches we have these four dimensions then he takes us to a fifth dimension he calls it hell and in that dimension would be the souls of the unjust and the wicked and those that are damned they exist within that dimension along with demons and demonic spirits and when when the bible's saying that there's things from beneath you you could even picture hell as being something that's debased it's lower and that it has an influence there's demonic influences and sure hell wants to influence the fourth dimension and these dimensions of time matter and light like it's a becomes a dimension of influence demonic influence the souls of the unjust you can even say that if there's ghosts right brother ram describes in one place how there was this uh this this image of it he was even in tucson where does that come from where does that apparition come from it's something that's bleeding through from a dimension and then he describes the sixth dimension as a place we call it paradise here is a place of theophanies where um there's theophanies there's the angels it's another dimension in christ uh where it's uh it's something from it's above it's more heavenly and then in the seventh dimension which is just using this uh using this pyramid just as a way of categorizing it which is a symbol that's very familiar to us and in the seventh dimension we have god god existing in this seventh dimension all by himself it's a god dimension it's a god realm now that would be when that's how brother branham describes these seven dimensions of these just calls them seven dimensions then in another place he describes this realm of it's a trinity above and a trinity below there we are and this is and i used the same image just to describe it or just to present it visually i call it this zero zero level here is life it's where we all exist right now that's light matter and time it's the realm of mortals it's his channel of life and and it's what we exist in with right now brother brahman even described it as a massive darkness and every once in a while you see lights that's this existence it's us right now we're all living within this realm of life light time matter it's that realm that one dimension we described in those first three before and then he describes descending a trinity from below and then ascending a trinity from above and so in life beneath us there's the realm of the unjust the souls of the dam the wicked the place of waiting uh when they pass away they go into this place of holding a place of torment and then in another dimension brother m described lower than that is the realm of demons and then he describes the devil himself or even hell in this other dimension because it's a trinity from below so this is the beneath that the scriptures talk about and then from above you have the holy ghost is in another realm above us and then the angels and then god that would be the trinity above that's just way a way that brother branham and we could get very very legalistic and very rigid about this and try to make it some sort of template to understand everything but it's brother branham using two different ways to get us to understand that what we perceive with our five senses here isn't just isn't all that's out there that there's more to things there's things from beneath and there's things above and you'll find that when people reject god they usually reject the devil at the same time i always find i think i've mentioned it before one of the most the funniest tweets i've ever seen was somebody said something about you know the satanist the church of satan that they literally believe in hell or believe in a devil and the reply from the church of satan was no actually it's christians who believe in a literal devil and it's like that's right i forgot yeah we're the ones that believe in a literal devil but if you begin to reject the unseen right that's what the the phallus one of the biggest errors in communism is if it does there's nothing that exists beyond what is seen and what is tangible the god of communism is science and so this is just a way of understanding there's more than meets the eye in john chapter 8 verse 23 jesus now touches on this he sayeth unto them year from beneath i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world i think we use this in this series already but jesus is pointing out pointing to these dimensions i am from above if i've come i've come from above you are from beneath and what what is demonstrative in this is christ is influenced from above and everyone on earth is being influenced from below heaven is pressing in hell is pressing in and one of the first i can still remember one of the first times i ever preached on this is how this becomes this realm of pressure and brother lucas i even think you you did uh something in html for me that would showed all these things moving all these things i'd created he kind of added some movement to it i mean it's 20 years old now and works in flex or something but it uh it demonstrated it demonstrated how these things are pressing in making this a realm of pressure this channel of life that we're living in christ is from above he says you're from beneath and what he's laying out is dimensions of origin and dimensions of existence here he is in the realm of mortals but he said i'm from above and there here they are they're also in the realm of morals be saying you're from beneath and brother branham said he lived in a world this is christ he lived in a world to himself and it's this phrase i want us to pick up on he was born outside the realm of the natural man amen he's born outside the realm of the natural sinful man and just by saying that i i want all of us to now just look right back to the beginning to understand how that these people that christ is talking to were born by a woman they're born through this through this this act and christ bypasses that so when he's born he's born outside the realm of a natural man though he's in that in this world he has sensory perception beyond it and so he's born outside the realm of man and by he's when he says you're from beneath i am from above and brother branham says he's born outside his birth his conception and birth departs from the way that all other men and women are procreated and now i know that we have as a church spent a lot of time in the book of genesis and so i i i'm very i feel very uh i'm personally reluctant to get into great deal detail on this but knowing on a wednesday night you're speaking to very mature believers who've heard a lot of good teaching from whatever their backgrounds were i know that you understand these things so in genesis chapter 2 verse 25 it describes kind of describes all of creation after god has created man in a spirit being then he's gonna place him within flesh and he defies divides them and now it's man and a woman there in the garden of eden to paradise the place of god's delight the bible says they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed and we realized that this existence was one of perfection and so man is existing brother chris if it's possible just zip back to that first slide that we had on that with that uh pyramid mankind is now in the beginning god created uh god created the heavens and the earth and the first act of creation we have is god said let there be light and there was light and then he brings forth matter so man is existing within light and matter and in all of creation is uh in harmony it's all unified all the different kingdoms are subject to one another and offered an imperfect functionality and so this is where mankind is described into chapter two and it's a perfect existence and the way that i have been thinking about over the last few weeks is this this may be one of the best ways to describe a life of faith because adam didn't have history he didn't have science he didn't have experience he just had a relationship with god and a knowledge of the divine and there was no fear because this was a life of faith there was no fear what's the first thing that begins to creep in after sin it's fear and so they were they were in this realm where they fellowshipped with the things of god and had relationship with an eternal invisible god amen they're in the realms of light and matter and they're having fellowship with a god who not isn't not necessarily seen is not necessarily felt but it's a god who we know made himself known by his voice because they heard the voice of the god walking in the garden speaking and so their existence then may not be unlike what we're trying to achieve now is to have a relationship with an invisible god because we have perfect harmony with one who cannot be comprehended or understood and so that's their existence and we can say that in the beginning god this is this realm of faith this god kingdom this god-existence that mankind in matter and light and matter is existing with this an eternal realm and then once sin comes it's after the beginning jesus refers to from the beginning it was not so there's this part of the beginning which was eternal and i know this is uh it's a very it's uh it's very unique uh way that god overlaps these things and so after the beginning in the beginning has an eternal quality to it it's not until there's sin that there's going to be a ceasing so timing comes enters into it and it's after the beginning once mankind falls that it says in genesis chapter 3 verse 23 the lord sent them forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so what is this humanity is cast out of this paradise and when they're cast out of it they lose a connection to the invisible and it's not that the whole earth it's not their they weren't tossed off another planet and thrown down here and it's not that god just kind of dug up the garden of eden and shot it back up a shoot into back into heaven it was a realm it was an existence it was some perception and knowledge that was lost because these channels became clogged and now man is thrust into this existence where the only realm he lives in now is matter in light at that very moment existence is thrust into time to where now man lives in light matter and time god said let there be light then he brought forth matter and then after the fall now time becomes this fourth dimension that all that all humanity has to move within and so brother bram says you are in a time space and the only thing that's eternal is something that had no beginning or no end this is i think this is something that einstein would have enjoyed because it's so it's it is such a full description such a scientific technical definition you are in time space as einstein might have said space time this is what we exist in these three dimensions of space and this dimension of time that defines all human existence but the only thing that's eternal has no beginning or end so brother bram now is taking it in swallowing up now our existence with something beyond it that envelops it that has no beginning or end and this is exactly how science starts to try to understand these extra dimensions because they draw a cube and they say well let's move these points out further and they have this other space around that cube which exists now in another dimension and that's that's science trying to figure out what else exists i can't remember what's called a euclid cube or something that they tried they're looking at these other uh dimensions and there's also there's uh this is coming back to my mind that if you just drew a point there's that's a zero level existence this just one little dot nothing else and then and then you would take something that's on a surface on a piece of paper when you have a piece of paper something exists in this it's two dimension and so there's only one way that you can chart that out and then this is three-dimensional and science is starting to get this feeling that there's something more beyond these four dimensions and so time space as brother ben calls it it's only partial reality but that which is eternal and has no beginning or end is full reality and it's only from that that this reality can fully be apprehended and put into context because it's the eternal that's given birth to this spatial existence and given birth to this time and it's for purpose and for reason now in john chapter 8 verses 41 to 44. g this is um this is in the same passage where he says you're from beneath i am from above and i am not of this world but you are of this world and he says you do the deeds of your father now these jews he knew exactly what he was talking about then they said to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god so where did they go right back to the beginning so he says i am from above you are from beneath you're of this world i am that of this world our minds ought to have gone right back to the beginning and so when he says you are you do the deeds of your father they go right back to the beginning with cain who was born of fornication who is of that wicked one said no we are not of that wicked when we are of our father even god so jesus said unto them if god were your father you would you would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god what is this a descending from above neither came i have myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word now if we debate at that point why can't you understand my dialogue dialect my manner of speaking he says it's because you cannot hear my word now audibly just with the the power of hearing the sense of hearing they say i hear you you just said i did the deeds of my father that's why i entered answered you but christ is now taking what seems to exist only within this realm of sound waves and has now just done something to it pops it out to say no there's more that you could hear in the transmission and you're not getting it there's more to what's being said there's more to pick up there's more information available but you're not picking it up so he says you are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him it's going all the way back to where their objection we are not born of fornication and christ is not like oh okay they knew exactly what i was saying i thought i was being a little bit more subtle there know exactly what i'm talking about let me ease up no he's just going to reinforce it even harder he's going right back to cain in the beginning bode not in the truth because there's no truth in him it's speaking of the devil where he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it what is the light's truth perverted it's something that's real and true now turned upside down twisted turned around deformed and so satan is the cause of a perverted reality and when you come to a statement here in a little bit hopefully and uh and i realize maybe i failed to present this the right way that faith existence of the man and the woman the beginning that that would be a way for us to conceptualize the way that god had placed adam and the woman on earth and given them that whatever abilities they might have had whatever senses they might have had whatever powers they might have had it was to be governed by the knowledge of god through revelation this could be an existence of faith in existence of faith the life of faith and satan stepped in to destroy that and sold the seeds of modern religion he sold the seeds of civilization and science and education and that's what was sewn into mankind's existence and so on the other side of that once time enters in and the god part is stripped away from man's reality now he exists only within these four dimensions but eternity still exists and brother branham says in the message perfection he says now this great chain of perfection was broken by time space this sounds like this is this is like deep stuff what are you saying here this great chain of perfection if you just wanted to picture that emblem of eternity is broken by time space what is it it's not just it's not light it's not matter but it's when this dimension of time fully allows it to clunk down into its own thing he said time came because of sin let's draw a picture of time let's see a perfect circle now you have to imagine this in your minds perfect circle forever forever and then all at once sin dropped in and put a little hickey or a little drop in the chain so it comes down now eternity continues on he says but it's not in its perfect condition there's a little gap comes down breaks over this way goes out this way god had to do that because satan caused it and it dropped down to a space of time for the trying and the perfecting and for the purging of the lost that god by his sovereign grace might someday lift that little hick your gap back into the perfect circle so i didn't draw it out but if you imagined a circle and just a little loop dropping down that's what we're living in now but one day it's got to come back into perfection and that's why it's this loop here within this loop here that god deals with sin hell the devil and all his angels and then once we loop back into eternity that little hickey is gone whatev whatever came under that whatever can't loop back in that's why there is no eternal hell and so it says then she rolls on just the same talk about this eternity now time is this little loop that loops down jesus was from eternity to eternity he stepped into time spaces made flesh came through in here in order to sanctify her put a streak of blood across this place to redeem it and connect it back within with god again for all eternity that's all time is then when god then god when it started here to the end of the little kink in the perfect circle but made it a little kink in it when god started there he was perfect everything he said was perfect everything he does is perfect so this whole time existence we call it a little loop a little kink or whatever it might be that is this exhibit the human existence on this world and that's the only thing that we really know and man's trying to reach out beyond himself to understand worlds beyond and as science advances and they're able to take tremendous photos of things far far far away and years and years and years away and these images come back and science is just wrestling with these dimensions and these shapes and these lines and these things being birthed and these things being born and just how expansive the universe is and they they they realize that this is something beyond this world and again it's hard for them to grasp it why because they're just an anti-type of what what the word of god is what the knowledge of god is but it's describing things this great chain of perfection is broken out because of satan and it puts us in time space but he says god is perfect there's still this eternal perfect being that exists he hasn't ceased to exist he hasn't just been sucked into this loop but he still exists above it all in acts chapter 17 verses 28 and 29 says speaking of god for in him we live and move and have our being for in him we live and move and have our being a certain also of your own poets have said if we are also his offspring for as much then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is likened to gold or silver stone graven by art and man's devices i want to touch on two principles in this and i think this is very often what's visited in these verses but in him we live we breathe we enjoy life it means to be strong it means to pass our lives it's a manner of living in him now this is describing how that we ought to sense our actual existence as being in god not just in the dimensions of light matter in time but in the in the dimension of god in him we live and move and have our being that i have my existence in something that is beyond this i enjoy life in him i live i move it means to cause to go to be set in motion motion which is evident of life it speaks of to excite in him i live i have my existence but in him i'm also motivated that's in him i have my motions of life it's what excites me in him i have my being it's to be to be present to exist in him i live and have life and him i move and have motion in him i have my existence it's it's giving this credence too that it's giving this even if you wanted to look at it just in a a purely historical context all of creation must realize we're only here because the divine and he's allowed us to drop down into this loop and that the only reason why we all are in things are is because he has set these things in motion it's a rebuttal to an atheist it's a rebuttal to the agnostic it's a rebuttal to those who think that god just stands afar off with his arms crossed its rebuttal to any other way than the the the knowledge that god created the heavens and the earth and set things in motion to fulfill his great plan and so this is and then on this other way of thinking about it that when this when this thing is when this loop is comes back into eternity how do we fit in because we exist within this eternal realm and he says then we if we are the offspring of god if we've come from him we ought not to think of the god head the godhood the god person the existence of god like gold silver stone or graven by art and man's devices now this is a much larger thought to an idol worshiper but let me look at it in a way that we could put it to all that would be applicable to anyone that god is not a matter of our physical senses so he's not a matter of our physical senses nor is he a figment of our minds he is not a god that can be handled or conjured in that way and so this is paul again describing in a beautiful way the how we ought to be the knowledge ought to be coming into as sons and daughters of god and to recognize that god is beyond this realm this box this cube so then if this is with that image in mind of a faith existence of the man and the woman this little and maybe this at this kink and things drop down now we've we've fallen into this time element because of sin and and there's a ways there's ways to chart it out that when sin entered into the heart of uh satan in the beginning or in heaven and was cast down to earth so many different ways to look at this from different dimensions but once if we could just achieve this dichotomy between our existence now as humans and this existence of the eternal and then look at the moment where satan comes in and he's going to try to force this divide and in genesis 3 5 he says for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof this is him talking to the woman who exists within light and matter and is not subject to death so there is no time he says then your eyes shall be open and he shall be as gods knowing good and evil he proposes to her that a higher knowledge could be attained by something natural that that there could be this attainment to spiritual knowledge and it says you shall become as gods and knowing good and evil your eyes shall be open in other words he's insinuating there was something beyond the realm that she's existing in and that she's only living in a partial reality everything you see is not what's real and everything you feel is not what's real and there's more beyond what you're experiencing and he proposes to her another reality beyond what she was experiencing as a woman in god's perfection and he suggests and what he proposes is that that can be experienced through physical means now if you could if you could take this to your heart so lord how could i make this applicable there there are ways that people can work themselves into a state of euphoria through physical exertion and through hysteria and make themselves think that they've entered into a divine realm where they're experiencing the divine and it's no different than the practices of an occult or some sort of pagan religion where they've worked themselves physically into something and have gotten no closer to god and we have to we have to realize that there's all sorts of ways that anything that exists within these dimensions can be impersonated but he says you can attain a higher knowledge through a physical act when the only way that they could know more of god in more reality was by divine knowledge adam couldn't figure it out adam couldn't feel it out it was going to come by this this divine connection that a son had to his creator because god is not a a matter of our physical senses or figment of our minds he's a it's a he's a matter of faith and that's why even this thought of a matter of faith it needs to be i want to enforce this uh with with great effort that we're built on faith all you are and every uh all you ever will be as a christian is is is according to faith in god's word it's our existence as a christian is defined by faith we have no other we don't have any other means of conviction and and vindication at the end of the day it's by faith there's not going to be a vault that's unearthed that's going to be able to vindicate us and we're just we just can't wait till they find the historical record to do it it's by faith paul says in second corinthians 5 7 for we walk by faith not by sight we walk by a sixth sense that's that that senses another dimension it's not faith that tells me this pulpit's here it's not faith that's telling me you're here because those are things that the senses declare but we walk by faith not by sight it's by a sense of another dimension sensing things that are divine sensing things are eternal sensing things that are promised by god that we use this scripture to some degree on this uh on blind uh trust bad faith by faith were influenced guided and and governed controlled by an unseen god god that cannot be seen right it's not a god you say well i want to know what you guys believe we'll go see god go talk to god go talk to our our our sage the one who has all the wisdom the one that we're trusting completely in and to some people they have their sources that become their god on earth it's this natural inclination to whatever they believe to be the most important they have their gods but we by faith are controlled by an unseen god we by faith are governed and we are led by and we are guided influenced by an unseen god it says for we walk by faith not by sight that sight does not refer to the act of vision but to more or less the whole thing and the whole perception of that which is seen by the shape or the appearance we're we don't we're not guided by the way things appear what we perceive it's in that that series i think we mentioned how that this world is only only functions according to what can be seen and taste what they taste and feel and smell and hear science is impacted only by that which it can observe it's changed only by that which you can observe world is influenced by the scene the world cannot science cannot in the the worldly in the worldly mind it cannot accept a reality beyond what is seen touched tasted and heard but faith all right i know i'm repeating myself through these three services faith goes beyond that and believes in existence of unseen realities and it's influenced by them we can find a lot of people who believe in things that we don't see come on somebody right find a lot of people who believe in these other things but we believe not only do we believe in the unseen but we're influenced by it and as we mentioned before i think express it this way science even admits this the fact that they can't a human can't perceive higher than three dimensions doesn't preclude its reality they cannot they cannot disprove it just because you cannot perceive higher than these three dimensions does not mean it's not there and so what is it what does faith become the reality to us of that reality that they're theorizing about because faith transcends all our biological restrictions by faith you may not be by human ability you may not be able to do it with man this is impossible but with god all things are possible in the church age book i have a few more i had several other quotes here just that i might perhaps read let me just let me just run through these real quick i could just do them because these they really spoke to me and helped me and this little billabong's talking about man has five senses and he says but there's actually a sixth sense he's talking about faith faith is the substance that things hope for the evidence of things you do not see taste feel smell or hear i think maybe this is is this what is this the last slide i have on there is a question to answers part one okay then i'll i'll come back to that brother brad i'm is praying this is the message speak to the rock he says when anointed the holy spirit gets upon us then we seem to forget that we're still earthly that's what i want all right let's talk about get in the spirit a lot of people do a lot of stuff to get make things happen right work ourselves into a healing no get in the spirit and then watch things happen he says when we get in the spirit we seem to forget that we're earthly there seems to be a deeper sense of something more real and he says it makes us do things that are hard to understand by the carnal mind and proof of his resurrection he's referring to discernment of spirits and they said they misunderstood it they didn't know what it meant it blinded their eyes miracles and things blinded their eyes and so it is today he says because the human mind can't understand it right and when the human mind can understand it what does the scientific human mind do just rejects it says you've got to get out of your own human mind and be born again by the holy spirit and get the mind of god in you then you can believe those things then it becomes a reality it says in another place how that you know when he that heareth my word and believeth on me has everlasting life not a make-believe it's absolutely something that's happened a conversion of the heart that's changed you and brought you into another realm men misunderstood christians women christians women men boys and girls that misunderstood who lived in those places people who live in those places in that other realm are misunderstood because it's contrary to the natural run of life among people of the world this natural run of life the the demonic has become accepted right the demonic is accepted and it's they're assimilated into it because it's by design by satan's interruption it's they accept these things as oh well they can feel that way and though they can be biologically in every single way be this they can be something else that doesn't actually exist only by nomenclature by name those things have become real but they can't grasp the above part because when man fell it sold that e that beneath into the channel of life it sewed that into the realm of mortals so now it's the divine that cannot be comprehended it's the divine that cannot be understood and it's contrary to the natural run of life among the people of the world and simon hear you him that's the reason today we find people so against the supernatural and against the things of god because they've been disobedient if they lived up in that realm where they should be they'd recognize these things so there's a there's a place to live to recognize and in the church age book chapter 6 thy tareen i just i know i veered off a little bit there he says now according to these verses now when he says these verses he's referring to the depths of satan but more particularly ephesians 3 that we may be able to comprehend with all saints was the breadth and length and depth and height this is what he's referring to this is how he amplifies ephesians 3 17 to 19. now according to these verses when a man experiences the depth of god in his life because how is it that brother brahm treats the phrase the depths of satan he says all theologians historians no one ever really touches this because they don't know what it is he goes well he gives a simple formula if you want to understand the depths of satan just understand the depths of god and satan will be the opposite so it wherever god goes satan's going this other way and it kind of forms this mirror image and that's where you see the trinity above the trinity below this realm of pressure then squeezed in the middle he says when a man experiences the depths of god in his life it is an actual personal experience of the spirit of god indwelling in him now i hope you catch this because there's a way that the spirit of god the holy spirit coming in from another realm can anoint everyone in the realm of light time and matter everyone could be impacted by it and it'd be just as temporal as time to time is and just be a baptism that kind of touches the flesh and then that leaves but now when he says once you've experienced the depths of god it's an actual experience of the eternity as my words now eternity indwelling in you so now if it's as if i'm just trying to use language to describe something that's divine and endless if time is looped out of eternity this person who exists within time light matter and time or these this realm of space height width and depth and this and we have this continue a long time it's as if now inside of me is eternity time kind of droops down like this and now it's kind of exist as this subset of eternity but now within me is eternity total different reality totally different sense totally different something greater and it's illuminated his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of god through the word that's the that's our life this is how we ought to be living our lives is that i've been born again by the word of god and i want to experience god by my not by being illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of god through the word every day of my life but the depth of satan will be in that he will attempt to destroy this so what's the depth of satan keeping you from walking in this illumination keeping you from living by that eternal dimension that has now been birthed inside of you he will always attempt to make a substitute for this reality of god and that's what he was doing in genesis 3 trying to make a substitute for this reality of god produce this fallen reality how will he do it he will take away the knowledge of the truth of god destroy the word by the putting forth of his own yea hath god said so he comes right back to genesis 3. he will then substitute the personal christ in our spirits this is what he has to do so that mankind now only exists within four dimensions as influence from the trinity below as held under if you want to use the one the one trinity of the of light matter time and then a science and then hell that's all he wants you to live in we're capped at the fifth we're in bondage of this we're under this this this this influence of everything dark brother the scripture is described as coming from beneath so you can just kind of flip it around and describe it a different way but he says he wants to substitute the personal christ in our spirits because that personal christ in our spirits is what tethers us back into the eternal loop so it permanently puts us there with our identity not just church services where the blessings can fall we feel good but it's by that new birth experience the soul is now locked back into the eternity again and that's what that's how you possess faith that allows you to be controlled in this realm by something greater he will substitute the personal christ in our spirits he will do it as he caused israel to do the same by a human being reigning as king instead of god i've run out of time when there's so much more to amplify do you recognize how that god was the one that had been rejected when they requested the king not samuel because samuel wasn't their king but what did they not want to be governed by an invisible god they didn't want an invisible god they wanted a literal king that they could kneel to they could hear they could touch and so that's how god was deposed as king over israel that's why god said they've rejected me not you samuel because i was the unseen that was governing them and that's what elevates the bride's faith because she's willing to make the lord her king who cannot be seen will not accept the pope will not accept a bishop will not accept a man as the husband of the church but she only accepts her headship as the word the born-again experience will be rejected in favor of church joining better not make this mistake the depths of satan had been entered into in that age and the fruit of that depth of satan which are lies murders and horrible crimes came forth from it because the depths of satan is what's produced all those things in the world today is that that does do these things kind of shed maybe more light or just go back over what you already knew a little bit just to refresh these things in my of these invisible dimensions and how that faith relates to them because it's not taking faith for people to be influenced from beneath because it's been hybrid into the existence but if you want to if you want to live above it you got to connect to something greater the message when brother man is doing his question and answers part one this was the first in this four parts there in august of 64. he says when you're awake in other words you're operated by five senses see taste fill smell and hear them were only given to you to contact your earthly home and they were not given to you to contact your heavenly home when god made man and he blessed them with his senses they could contact the physical eden through these senses but they had another one that allowed them to operate within the eternity the eternal realm and the eternal part of their existence and that's that channel these channels that brethren talks about being clogged relate to this he says these are given to contact your earthly home there's another sense to contact our heavenly home that's actually six senses in the body because he is the number six in the bible he was created on the sixth day he is the number six as a man is and he's got seed taste feel smell here and faith his faith sets his destination where he's headed for just like a gps uses coordinates and it's those coordinates that determine where we are within space and they're using different readings coordinates to say you could give you could give somebody a coordinate i don't know if anybody does geocaching here and and uses these coordinates to find something and they're saying if you go on these coordinates and you could even do it out not necessarily even using gps you can use maps and different things to arrive at a very precise point and it's using three space spatial dimensions to identify where somebody is and that man can only do that within this and as time moves on gives if something only existed at a particular point in time man has to be there at that moment in that time to identify with otherwise it keeps moving on again this is why people perceive things differently and things here you hear something you see something it's all because of what man exists within but he says faith sets his destination where he's headed for faith can put coordinates in and put man on a course that's not bound within this sphere as the i wish i guess there's just ways that you could present this graphically but i just want you to see it by faith faith sets his destination where he's headed for now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things you do not see taste feel smell or hear this is i think just great summary statement but by faith when he catches the word it sends him into a dimension that makes it so real to him until he's just as good as he's got in his hands he knows it's going to happen and instead of taking that in the sense of oh i'm believing for a new job i'm believing for a new job you pop into this other dimension where you see yourself you wearing the uniform and you know it and you see it and you kind of describe what might be actually a vision we then have this look at it in the sense of every day i want to live my life in such a way to where it sends me into a dimension that makes god's word so real to me that i'm i'm living in another world i'm living in another realm that's good and he knows it's going to happen what help me out here all you call of duty fans and everything what is it npcs what are they called when they're not the main character non-playable is it an npc yeah so there's i'm sure there's a sermon in there somewhere but when and and i i didn't i haven't played games in the the day and age now where every game you play you're playing against somebody else in india and china and everywhere else but there's a certain concept of reality when you're playing um these games that you're the main character and everything's revolving around you and you know you're the only one and again you know you're the only one real controlling it and it's just something simulated that's controlling everybody else am i going am i am i getting anywhere in this i'm testing you guys out for a future sermon come on you're my test group but there has to be and there's and we often sit in this world and we try to we try to i know how my life feels but if you want to start feeling funny just start trying to imagine how other people feel and man to me my life is just when i see this person uh that's how they come into my life but then you start thinking right now you know how you go some of young kids you go and you visit grandma and grandpa you go to virginia and you visit your grandma and grandpa and and it's all new and it's fun and it's neat when you walk into their house but that's going on right now wherever that is it's going on right those feelings you would get the smells you would smell the the activities all the it's still those places still exist right now and you only know when you step into them and you're there within uh light matter and time but listen whatever that whatever we're experiencing here faith now is on a whole other level and it would be wonderful if we could just press ourselves to live into that live in that faith live in that realm recognize there's things that are more real there's a reality greater than this one i'm experiencing right now and say oh god let me let it let it send me into an invisible dimension and let me walk by that living that god bless you trust you're doing well
