[0:00] genesis chapter 13 verse 8
[0:04] and
[0:06] again continuing on the subject of
[0:07] supreme faith revealed in abraham
[0:10] when you're sick of the subject just let
[0:11] me know genesis chapter 13 verse 8 and
[0:14] abram said unto lot let there be no
[0:16] strife i pray thee between me and thee
[0:18] and between my heard men and thy heard
[0:20] men for we be brethren is not the whole
[0:23] land before thee separate thyself i pray
[0:25] thee from me if thou will take the left
[0:27] hand then i will go to the right or if
[0:29] thou depart to the right hand then i
[0:31] will go to the left and lot lifted up
[0:33] his eyes and beheld all the plain of
[0:35] jordan that it was well watered
[0:37] everywhere before the lord destroyed
[0:39] sodom and gomore even as the garden of
[0:41] the lord like the land of egypt as thou
[0:44] comest unto zoar
[0:46] then lot chose him all the plain of
[0:48] jordan and lot journeyed east and they
[0:51] separated themselves the one from the
[0:52] other
[0:53] abram dwelled in the land of canaan and
[0:55] lot dwelled in the cities of the plain
[0:57] and pitched his tent towards sodom but
[1:00] the men of sodom are wicked and sinners
[1:02] before the lord exceedingly amen you can
[1:05] be seated
[1:06] and come back to that uh scripture
[1:09] tonight and maybe walk through it just
[1:11] again with the
[1:12] um
[1:13] providing some comment on it
[1:15] but we've been looking at um supreme
[1:18] faith revealed in abraham
[1:20] and how his life um is a pattern for us
[1:23] and his journey tells a testimony tells
[1:26] our testimony it's his testimony but
[1:28] also
[1:29] carries our testimony
[1:31] on sunday and i'm just going to make a
[1:32] few statements that kind of connect
[1:33] sunday's service to tonight's service
[1:35] we're looking at how the mystery of
[1:37] abraham's faith is hidden in genesis
[1:40] chapter one through four in the story of
[1:42] adam and the circumstances that adam was
[1:45] placed in even the circumstances of his
[1:47] fall god's response to the fall even
[1:50] events immediately after the fall in
[1:52] genesis chapter four him being thrust
[1:54] out of the garden
[1:55] that
[1:56] abraham's journey and his faith is
[1:58] connected to these events that transpire
[2:01] in those first few
[2:02] chapters and we could say that abraham's
[2:04] journey is related to abraham excuse me
[2:07] adam's fall
[2:09] and so
[2:10] some of the things we're looking at how
[2:11] the abraham's
[2:13] promises the promises
[2:15] that are given to abraham were typed in
[2:17] adam there were certain things that adam
[2:18] had and certain things expressed in adam
[2:20] that we see revived and manifested in
[2:22] abraham a statement we ended on is an
[2:25] identified masterpiece of god
[2:28] brother bram says after man had fallen
[2:31] and deliberately opened the door to the
[2:33] enemy and come in and marred him and set
[2:36] death in him still was god not willing
[2:38] this be defeated
[2:40] he came down and started all over again
[2:43] and i love this statement he was going
[2:45] to make that man again so i'm not adam
[2:47] what adam represented what was embodied
[2:49] in him kind of the potential the promise
[2:51] the power um the the plan of god that
[2:54] was represented in adam he says he's
[2:56] going to do that over again
[2:58] and and i love it he's not willing he
[3:00] came down so we're looking at when when
[3:01] was this moment that god came down when
[3:03] is this moment that god's gonna bring
[3:05] this man back up again he put adam on a
[3:07] covenant
[3:09] do this and not this this and not that
[3:11] touched not handle not taste not but we
[3:13] find out when he started again he
[3:16] started with abraham and in abraham he
[3:19] started him on an unconditional covenant
[3:21] the subject of an unconditional covenant
[3:23] is so vast it is so marvelous and so
[3:26] wonderful that there there is kind of a
[3:28] pull or a draw to begin to highlight
[3:31] just the the number of things that are
[3:33] related to the fact that the
[3:34] covenant is unconditional and maybe we
[3:37] touched on a little bit on uh through
[3:38] the few of these services on the
[3:40] permanence of the promise to abraham and
[3:42] how that gave him this conviction that
[3:44] what he was seeking was eternal
[3:46] and had that revelation dawned on him
[3:48] early on then he would have never feared
[3:50] death because he's like this is a
[3:51] permanent promise
[3:52] god is able to revive or to raise up but
[3:55] i'm wanting just to look at on this very
[3:57] simple aspect of how that when god was
[4:00] starting again he started in abraham so
[4:02] in abraham there's this pattern that we
[4:05] see we're emphasizing that those words
[4:07] of pattern are processed
[4:08] and then we could say that abraham
[4:10] there's this profile of abraham's life
[4:12] so in abraham we see this profile
[4:14] and i want to be very specific tonight
[4:18] to an element that we were bringing out
[4:19] on sunday and just be very specific
[4:21] again and identify
[4:23] a particular aspect that again it opens
[4:25] up in a whole other area too that i'm
[4:27] going to be somewhat restrained in but
[4:28] we find out when he started again he
[4:31] started with abraham so in abraham is
[4:33] when god came down and was going to
[4:35] begin to make that man again
[4:38] now we realize that abraham is not that
[4:40] man but there's something that is
[4:42] attached to abraham that abraham is
[4:44] carrying that he becomes a part of by
[4:46] covenant that cannot be defeated
[4:49] and in the church age book brother
[4:50] branham said in the garden of eden when
[4:52] he promised the seed to the woman he
[4:54] says he later designated that seed had
[4:56] to come through abraham so genesis
[4:59] 3 15 that the seed of the woman would
[5:01] crush the serpent
[5:03] that is a prophecy of jesus christ we
[5:05] could say that is the man that is the
[5:07] seed of the woman that is the man being
[5:09] built again the last adam and brother
[5:11] branham is saying that in the garden of
[5:13] eden when this promise was given
[5:15] then that seed is designated to abraham
[5:18] so now abraham becomes the carrier or
[5:20] the one that is bearing this promise of
[5:22] genesis 3 15. so when we can look at
[5:25] this way when god calls abram in genesis
[5:27] chapter 12 or if you want to use chapter
[5:29] 11
[5:30] he's designating the prophecy of christ
[5:32] and he's placing the prophecy of christ
[5:35] in genesis 3 15 to abraham the seed of
[5:38] the woman is now designated to or
[5:41] assigned to abraham such a beautiful a
[5:45] beautiful truth to recognize how that
[5:47] now adam is connected the promise given
[5:49] to adam and the woman or the curse to
[5:51] the serpent is now designated or
[5:53] connected to abraham
[5:56] and then we were looking in genesis
[5:57] chapter 17
[5:58] how that god speaks to abraham and says
[6:01] walk before me and be thou perfect and
[6:03] how beautiful it was
[6:04] that this uh this utterance to abraham
[6:08] follows
[6:09] his uh
[6:11] his having a child by hagar so here is
[6:13] the the suggestion of the woman you know
[6:16] sarah said hey why don't you have a
[6:17] child by my handmaid just as eve
[6:20] suggested to adam that they partake of
[6:22] this fruit and then abraham
[6:24] acts according to his wife's suggestion
[6:26] whereas in eve did the same thing to
[6:28] adam and he fell he lost the covenant
[6:31] here in the shadows of
[6:33] abraham listening to his wife god
[6:36] appears again and he doesn't take away
[6:38] the covenant from him but he reaffirms
[6:40] it says walk before me and be thou
[6:41] perfect and he begins to use the
[6:43] language that this is an everlasting
[6:45] covenant as for me my covenant is with
[6:47] thee and it's going to be everlasting
[6:49] and we saw how that the language that
[6:51] god uses to abraham in chapter 17 is god
[6:55] establishing an everlasting covenant
[6:57] that corresponds to the covenant in eden
[7:00] so promise that was given in eden the
[7:01] promise that was given that related to
[7:03] the to be fruitful and multiply a
[7:05] promise that related to a land in
[7:07] children in that land or possession in
[7:10] that land god's using the same language
[7:12] with abraham
[7:14] all right can i get an amen that's my
[7:16] that's my summary on sunday now i want
[7:18] to take a step further in this
[7:21] and look at specifically
[7:23] just a very a very narrow thought that
[7:25] we already touched on already but i want
[7:26] to add maybe some more meat to the
[7:28] outline
[7:29] but god calling abraham and then sarah
[7:32] with him
[7:33] expresses a very specific image we've
[7:35] already looked at this so it's not uh
[7:37] there's not a big wow tonight um not
[7:40] that there normally is but just there's
[7:41] not something that oh never saw that
[7:43] before that's just going to be very very
[7:45] simple and so them being called out on a
[7:48] journey abraham and his wife to a land
[7:50] that he would show them afterwards so
[7:51] there's it's connected with the land
[7:53] there's a specific image that's being
[7:55] represented
[7:56] and in the sermon marriage and divorce
[7:59] brotherhood said one interruption spoils
[8:01] the entire program
[8:03] now when human beings were run in
[8:04] continuity with god with one man and one
[8:08] woman
[8:08] that's the program of god the program of
[8:11] god and human beings running in
[8:13] continuity with it so that's kind of the
[8:14] image i want you to
[8:16] be refreshed in is that god's program
[8:19] once it kind of reached this spot where
[8:20] now it's ready now it's all seeds are
[8:23] going to come forth after they're kind
[8:24] and god's plan is going to unfold it's
[8:27] humanity running in continuity with god
[8:30] according to the program of god one man
[8:32] and one woman
[8:33] that's the image when god's program had
[8:35] come to this apex as it were and was
[8:37] then going to usher forth certain
[8:39] promises and certain manifestations but
[8:41] then he says this woman sinned
[8:43] and it threw the whole earthly program
[8:46] out of continuity with god
[8:48] now this is god's program one man one
[8:51] woman was
[8:52] with so much potential so much
[8:54] possibility but through the woman's sin
[8:57] the whole earthly program falls out of
[8:59] continuity in harmony with god's program
[9:02] so if we see this image the program of
[9:04] god or the plan of god was held within
[9:08] and the promise of it the potential of
[9:09] it was held within one man and one woman
[9:12] but then when they fall
[9:14] this program is lost whatever promise or
[9:17] possibility was related to this plan of
[9:19] god it's forfeited and we can look at it
[9:21] as the book goes back into the hands of
[9:23] god the promise of genesis 1 28 goes
[9:26] back to god and all these things that
[9:29] they were had the power and possibility
[9:31] of they lose we even realize they lose
[9:33] the land the garden is lost to them
[9:35] they're driven out of it and and they're
[9:37] guarded from it
[9:38] and so
[9:39] this is the image that god raises back
[9:42] up that's just the part i'm wanting to
[9:43] kind of highlight again is that this
[9:45] image of one man and one woman is the
[9:47] image that god begins to raise back up
[9:49] in the life of abraham you look at
[9:51] genesis chapter 11 genesis chapter 12
[9:53] you'll see that the scripture begins to
[9:55] zero in on and focus in on one man and
[9:59] his wife
[10:00] we see the genealogies and the lineages
[10:02] of each of the sons of noah then we
[10:04] begin to see a little bit more of an
[10:05] amplification of some of the details of
[10:07] the story of the tower of babel and how
[10:10] important that is to the context of
[10:11] abraham's story but it's wanting you to
[10:13] get to not just this general
[10:16] these are the sons of or this one begat
[10:18] this one this one begat this one they're
[10:20] wanting to get to one man abram and the
[10:22] wife that he chose
[10:24] and of all the characteristics that they
[10:26] want to tell you about abraham and his
[10:28] wife the one characteristic they want
[10:29] you to know is that oh by the way she
[10:31] can't have kids
[10:32] right that's the one thing that is being
[10:34] expressed is it's one man and his wife
[10:36] but it highlights the inability of her
[10:38] to have children
[10:39] but god when he speaks and he speaks to
[10:41] him and i'm going to look at i'm just
[10:43] going to actually refer to
[10:44] verse 2 of chapter 12 he says i will
[10:47] make of thee a great nation
[10:49] and this is a language now being spoken
[10:51] to abram he's we're informed ahead of
[10:53] time that sarah is unable to have a
[10:55] child but he's saying i'm going to make
[10:56] of the great nation so this is the
[10:58] promise of children i whether though you
[11:01] have not conceived yet you do not have a
[11:03] son you do not have children there will
[11:04] be progeny of your of your own through
[11:06] your family through your household and
[11:08] so this is a promise to abraham that he
[11:11] will have children
[11:12] so though it is one man and one woman
[11:16] there is a promise that he's going to
[11:17] have children and again we see this
[11:19] image embodied in adam and the woman
[11:22] because there was this promise even the
[11:24] woman when she's ushered out of the
[11:26] garden of eden she's pregnant
[11:28] and so then we could see that adam
[11:30] abraham and sarah though she has not
[11:32] conceived their lives are pregnant with
[11:34] the promise that there will be progeny
[11:36] there will be children that come forth
[11:38] and so there's going to be it's speaking
[11:40] of a restoration
[11:43] and this is a statement that we've used
[11:45] a few times already
[11:46] but i want to just pull a very short
[11:48] these short words out in israel in the
[11:50] church and all that land among all those
[11:53] people
[11:54] one man found favor with god
[11:56] of all humanity over the face of the
[11:58] whole earth one man found faith favor
[12:00] with god and it wasn't because abraham
[12:03] folded his hands a certain way when he
[12:04] prayed
[12:06] it wasn't because he was too lazy to
[12:08] worship the moon god
[12:09] it was nothing about him that was
[12:11] special there was nothing that stood him
[12:13] apart
[12:14] allowed him to kind of stand in contrast
[12:16] to everyone it was just god calling him
[12:18] he says among all of humanity one man
[12:20] found favor with god that's what made
[12:21] him different
[12:22] is he found favor with god he said i
[12:24] want you to notice that is the beginning
[12:26] of christianity of the church
[12:28] so in the beginning of christianity it's
[12:30] god singling out one man and him and his
[12:33] wife
[12:34] and one thing just to
[12:36] to ponder in this image
[12:39] as a and i want to be able to just maybe
[12:41] reference it and you could allow allow
[12:43] it just to be amplified in your hearts
[12:45] that when god calls abram
[12:48] in calling abram and and his wife it's
[12:51] pointing back to adam
[12:53] and so we see that god is going to
[12:54] designate something to to abram and i
[12:56] want you to see how it's connected to
[12:58] prior to the fall in the curse at the
[13:01] time of the fall so that we're god is
[13:03] wanting us to bring
[13:05] the creation and the fall of creation
[13:08] and carry it through the flood of the
[13:10] depravity of man and the flood and the
[13:12] judgment and then even the character of
[13:14] man after the flood that's represented
[13:16] in chapter 11 and he's wanting to see
[13:18] that in adam it points back
[13:21] and abram it points back to adam
[13:24] and there's this there's this connection
[13:25] between the two of them
[13:27] and so abraham is pointing back to adam
[13:30] but it's not he's not just pointing back
[13:32] to adam but in abram it's pointing
[13:35] forward to christ
[13:37] so this this becomes this tremendous
[13:39] turn in this story
[13:41] and a tremendous uh focusing in on the
[13:43] plan of god because we could say
[13:45] without any any uh
[13:48] any uh suspicion at all or any doubt
[13:51] that this is where the story zeroes in
[13:53] on and focuses on because we only read
[13:55] about we've said it many many times the
[13:58] rest of the bible is about one man and
[13:59] his seed
[14:00] so the old testament is about that's
[14:02] what the rest of the bible is about
[14:03] whether it be his natural seed or the
[14:04] royal seed or the seed which is christ
[14:06] you could say every scripture
[14:08] jesus christ is in every scripture he's
[14:11] the seed of abraham so the entire bible
[14:13] is about the seed of abraham so in
[14:15] calling one man abraham it points back
[14:18] to adam but it's also pointing forward
[14:20] to christ
[14:21] and in doing so abraham is forming a
[14:23] link between fallen humanity and the
[14:25] restoration of god's plan
[14:27] he's just this this fulcrum this
[14:29] critical juncture this point where
[14:31] mankind has fallen but now in abraham
[14:33] it's going to be that which redeems
[14:35] fallen humanity because it's linking us
[14:37] to the restoration of god's program
[14:39] through jesus christ
[14:44] and in genesis chapter 12 verse 1
[14:47] god calls for abraham
[14:51] dramatic pause
[14:53] to separate from his father's house
[14:56] he's calling him to leave his father's
[14:58] house and specifically get away from my
[15:00] father's house that means extended
[15:01] family
[15:02] mom dad cousins brothers uncles sisters
[15:06] uh nephews and everything it's get away
[15:08] from my father's house and from that
[15:10] kindred so it kind of expanded a little
[15:11] bit that if there was any question that
[15:13] you should separate from
[15:15] those in the family tree god says from
[15:17] thy kindred so kind of expands the scope
[15:20] from which god wants him to separate and
[15:22] from the country
[15:24] and we've already taken a lot of time
[15:26] identifying what a beautiful truth is
[15:29] contained in calling abraham out of
[15:30] babylon and then it's also from his
[15:33] kindred but then also from his father's
[15:35] house
[15:36] and so
[15:37] by god doing this in
[15:39] in calling abraham
[15:41] he will cause abraham's life to portray
[15:44] the image of adam and the woman
[15:47] he's going to and i believe that god is
[15:48] intentional when he does something and
[15:50] so it's not that god calls abraham to do
[15:53] something and then afterwards god goes
[15:55] oh well look at that
[15:56] how awesome was that i didn't even
[15:58] notice that i didn't even realize that
[15:59] he was in ur just on the other side of
[16:01] the euphrates and then later on i was
[16:03] going to give him a possession all the
[16:04] way up to the euphrates so like when i
[16:06] called him he wasn't even in the land of
[16:08] possession but then after i called it
[16:09] well you know it's just i didn't know
[16:10] what i was doing but in that awesome
[16:13] listen we can preach sermons that
[16:14] happened that way and afterwards someone
[16:16] says did you notice this you notice that
[16:17] you're like
[16:19] well yeah of course i did i never
[16:22] thought of that before that's amazing
[16:23] did i say that i didn't mean to say that
[16:25] and you connect things after the fact
[16:27] god is very intentional and god is doing
[16:30] this and he's going to cause abraham's
[16:32] life to portray the image of adam and
[16:34] the woman now we've recognized certain
[16:37] similarities but maybe more so we've
[16:39] recognized contrast
[16:41] that there's certain things that model
[16:43] after one another but there's another
[16:44] side of it that abraham begins to
[16:46] testify of so let's look at this image
[16:48] in genesis chapter 12 verse 4
[16:51] and says so abram departed as the lord
[16:53] had spoken unto him so god told him to
[16:55] get away from your father's house from
[16:56] your kids or from your country well he
[16:58] got out of ur to haran but who was in
[17:00] her end his dad and some of the family
[17:02] then he tells him to leave and this is
[17:04] where he's getting up out of her on and
[17:06] he's departing as the lord had spoken to
[17:07] him and god wants us to know
[17:09] and lot went with him
[17:11] we want us to know that he wants us to
[17:13] recognize that lot isn't with them
[17:15] because this is an important aspect of
[17:17] the process that's taking place in
[17:18] abraham's life and so when lot leaves
[17:22] with his wife and i believe in verse 5
[17:24] it says he took abraham took his wife
[17:26] sarah and lot with them it repeats it
[17:28] again
[17:29] we realized lot following him the image
[17:31] hasn't quite manifested yet
[17:33] he still hasn't fully walked in the
[17:36] original command genesis 12 1 abraham
[17:39] ghetto and this is me summarizing get
[17:40] away from your father's house from your
[17:42] kindred and from your country and he got
[17:45] away from the country maybe a little bit
[17:46] of the kindred but he still
[17:48] still has his father's house hanging
[17:50] around and so he hasn't fully complied
[17:52] with or walked into the image that god
[17:55] had if there was a picture painted by
[17:56] genesis 12 1 abraham hasn't yet fully
[17:59] walked into that yet
[18:02] and so in genesis chapter 13 verse 1
[18:05] abram has gone down into egypt he's lied
[18:08] a little bit about his wife
[18:10] and there's there's a certain aspect
[18:12] that maybe he's not told in that story
[18:13] because it's focusing again on abram and
[18:15] his wife and the the situation with
[18:17] pharaoh but now in verse 1 he's going to
[18:19] leave back out of egypt and abram went
[18:21] out of egypt he and his wife and all
[18:23] that he had
[18:25] and lot with them
[18:27] into the south so guess who was there
[18:28] the whole time lot
[18:31] yeah he refers to him in one place as
[18:33] his brother and so this would be kind of
[18:35] the
[18:36] though he was be considered a nephew and
[18:37] he would be considered an uncle there
[18:39] was this expectation that you would look
[18:41] after this one as if he was the bro your
[18:43] brother because he's your brother's son
[18:46] and in certain cultures uh you would get
[18:47] in trouble
[18:49] if uh i know this is true uh in africa
[18:52] in certain cultures that if you called
[18:54] who is one who is literally your cousin
[18:57] if you call them your cousin you get in
[18:58] trouble
[19:00] that's your brother
[19:01] and so this is lot kind of like a
[19:03] brother that won't leave and here he is
[19:05] lot with him and kind of hanging out and
[19:06] here he goes he goes down into egypt
[19:08] he's there for a while lot was with him
[19:09] because as he begins to come out lot is
[19:12] still with him when he leaves
[19:13] now i want to kind of drop this in here
[19:17] because there's a few things i want to
[19:18] say about lot tonight kind of just
[19:21] uh
[19:22] wetting your whistle a little bit for a
[19:24] more detailed look into
[19:25] um
[19:27] uh the the life of lot or how lot
[19:29] relates to the life of abraham maybe we
[19:31] could say as supreme faith is revealed
[19:33] in abraham we could say that maybe bad
[19:36] faith is revealed in law
[19:38] but it's um a lot
[19:40] i i i need to find just the right way to
[19:42] express this because i want it to hold
[19:44] some weight that it could just stay with
[19:46] you a little bit without amplifying it
[19:48] very much but lot is a more subtle
[19:50] representation of babylon
[19:53] because god speaks to abram
[19:56] and we we have to understand that when
[19:57] god spoke to abraham
[19:59] he began he this is he's a different man
[20:01] he's changed whenever god appears to you
[20:03] and speaks to you god appeared to abram
[20:05] abram is being is a changed man and he's
[20:07] ever changing as god calls him out so
[20:09] the promise was to abraham god reveals
[20:12] himself to abraham but lot is kind of
[20:14] moving along with them but lot has not
[20:16] changed
[20:18] and lot not being changed he's a
[20:20] chaldean
[20:21] he's a babylonian he's an ear right or
[20:23] whatever you would call him from the
[20:25] city of earth here he is he's followed
[20:26] along with uh um with abraham but in
[20:30] though he's left babylon we look at him
[20:33] and i view him as kind of a more
[20:35] undercover unsuspecting representation
[20:38] of babylon
[20:40] so abraham leaves er he goes into iran
[20:42] he's there for a while and then as he
[20:43] leaves and he goes south he's to go into
[20:45] canaan and then into cain canaan he
[20:47] comes but babylon is following along
[20:49] with them
[20:50] and you'll find that this is just kind
[20:52] of where i want to sow the seeds for you
[20:53] to ponder this a little bit you'll find
[20:54] that the message of the hour associates
[20:57] lot with the unwise virgin and
[20:59] associates him with the foolish virgin
[21:01] and how he is a representation of the
[21:03] lukewarm church
[21:05] so there's it's not fully come out
[21:07] coming out of it's not fully separating
[21:09] himself and this is what lot represents
[21:11] so there's something very significant
[21:14] that god wants to portray in the life of
[21:16] lot as it relates to abraham's calling
[21:20] and so when god's separating when he
[21:21] says i want to separate you you need to
[21:23] be separate he's portraying something in
[21:25] the separation of abraham and sarah even
[21:28] from lot
[21:30] so you say well he got out of her and he
[21:32] got a haran he got away from his dad but
[21:33] now lot's still hanging around and god
[21:37] needs him to separate from lot and in
[21:39] doing so he's expressing something he's
[21:42] portraying something in that separation
[21:44] even from this nephew even from this
[21:46] brother
[21:47] and you'll find that brother branham
[21:49] refers to it quite often how that
[21:50] abraham had to get into a condition
[21:53] and there's a condition that he's
[21:54] wanting to put abraham in in part of
[21:56] that condition required distance from
[21:58] lot
[22:01] and and i'll say it here and i and and
[22:03] i've been working just as as i've been
[22:05] studying this putting certain scriptures
[22:07] and statements of the message hour and
[22:09] two a little database so those of you
[22:12] who like data i'm compiling data
[22:15] on on this particular thought because i
[22:18] realize that such a there's just this
[22:21] it's very easy for people to get nasty
[22:23] with this
[22:24] right you know how can light have
[22:26] fellowship with darkness and essentially
[22:28] what they're telling you is they think
[22:29] their light and your darkness right how
[22:31] can two walk together except they be
[22:32] agreed it's like i don't even like to
[22:34] walk so let's not worry about worry
[22:36] about walking
[22:37] and there's always this nastiness
[22:38] associated with it right and so the same
[22:40] thing with lot abraham being separated
[22:43] from lot
[22:44] that it's kind of like oh well that's
[22:45] just lot's group and he was just a penny
[22:47] and i'm a silver dollar and you begin to
[22:49] it comes this razor's edge where all of
[22:51] a sudden it kind of reveals nastiness in
[22:52] our heart when we can be so critical and
[22:55] so harsh and so knee-jerky about other
[22:57] people when the example i'm about to
[22:59] start to preach my data
[23:01] when the example that god portrays and
[23:04] brother man is very precise about this
[23:05] and it bears repeating so i don't mind
[23:07] sharing it with you now the example
[23:08] that's portrayed now that once god
[23:10] separates abraham from lot
[23:12] watch the christian attitude in abraham
[23:15] to go out and pursue his backslidden
[23:19] lukewarm believe in brother lot
[23:22] so we don't become these caustic
[23:24] critical harsh you know hand in the face
[23:27] get away from me i appreciate this six
[23:29] foot of separation from you
[23:31] um attitude towards law there's still a
[23:34] desire to see him restore it's still an
[23:36] act of restoration and a pursuing that
[23:38] takes place but you can never come to
[23:40] that until the separation comes first
[23:42] because as long as they were together he
[23:44] couldn't call a lot out to a promise
[23:45] they were kind of in it together
[23:48] and so god is wanting to portray
[23:49] something
[23:50] you've been looking at a number of
[23:52] statements in the sermon perfect faith
[23:54] and as i there was a few other
[23:56] statements that i i
[23:57] put into my notes
[23:59] um to share with you tonight and i've
[24:01] realized well this is just getting
[24:03] getting way too long i'd hate to preach
[24:05] after midnight so i cut it short
[24:07] so that we would we wouldn't go past
[24:09] midnight
[24:10] but there's several more statements you
[24:11] could look at in the message perfect
[24:13] faith
[24:14] and notice this he says abraham had to
[24:16] believe just what that voice told him
[24:20] and when he was a hundred years old 25
[24:22] years later i loved this statement he
[24:24] was stronger believe in it than he was
[24:26] 25 years ago when it was given to him
[24:30] notice the faith of abraham on day one
[24:32] it wasn't to attend and then on day
[24:35] 1000 or whatever it's to attend it grew
[24:40] whatever whatever faith began in abraham
[24:42] it was stronger
[24:43] 25 years later
[24:45] he said he believed it he staggered not
[24:46] at the promise of god through unbelief
[24:48] but was strong giving praise to god
[24:50] knowing that he was able to perform what
[24:52] he had promised
[24:53] so he was stronger believe in it 25
[24:56] years later than when he received it
[24:57] that's the process of growth maturing
[25:00] faith to perfect faith faith or supreme
[25:02] faith he said that's the way everyone
[25:04] must be that way you and i must be that
[25:06] way you must come with an unfailing
[25:09] faith believing that god made the
[25:10] promise but now you have to be in a
[25:13] position to have that faith
[25:15] so we look at abraham and his testimony
[25:17] that he staggered not at the promise of
[25:19] god through unbelief and he was stronger
[25:22] 25 years later than when it was given to
[25:24] him stronger believing it more robust
[25:26] more powerful even in the absence of it
[25:28] manifesting
[25:30] i mean wouldn't we think that if i if if
[25:31] we well we don't have to think if
[25:34] someone made a promise to hey i'm going
[25:35] to do this and 25 years later you'd
[25:38] probably say so where's your confidence
[25:39] that i'm going to do this where is it at
[25:40] you might be like
[25:42] where was it the day i promised it well
[25:44] i don't know maybe i thought you know
[25:45] chance 8 out of 10 that you'd do it well
[25:47] where is it at now like
[25:49] is there negative on this scale you know
[25:51] how low can i go on this why because by
[25:53] 25 years later your confidence that
[25:55] someone's going to do it is going to
[25:57] wane
[25:58] but yet the opposite happens with
[25:59] abraham he's promised something and
[26:01] though nothing has been done to to make
[26:04] it material to him and nothing has even
[26:06] changed
[26:07] significantly
[26:08] to where he could put his finger on it
[26:10] and say here it is this is the promise i
[26:12] have a i have a pregnancy test it says
[26:13] she's expecting anything like that
[26:16] his faith is stronger than when he first
[26:18] began to believe
[26:20] now i'm not just wanting to brag on
[26:21] abraham i want you says every one of us
[26:23] must be that way
[26:25] but catch this abraham had a faith that
[26:29] grew and was stronger as a result of the
[26:31] position that he was in in the process
[26:33] that god was putting him through the
[26:35] paces that he was going through because
[26:37] he says you have to have that we have an
[26:39] unfailing faith but you have to be in a
[26:41] position to have that faith
[26:43] if i could put it this way i that we
[26:45] have a faith and this is faith that we
[26:47] all begin in we're justified by faith
[26:49] the the new birth is the seal of that
[26:52] genuine faith but then this faith is
[26:54] growing the potential and possibility of
[26:56] it being perfect faith is being
[26:58] developed within us as we walk in god's
[27:00] word and feed on the word of god and we
[27:03] are coming to this unfailing faith a
[27:06] perfect faith
[27:08] and for that to happen you have to be in
[27:10] a position to have that faith so we're
[27:12] coming to the supreme faith it's a faith
[27:14] that we haven't had before and notice
[27:16] you have to be in a position to have
[27:18] that faith
[27:19] so there's something about the
[27:20] positioning
[27:22] that is important for that seed of faith
[27:24] to develop anyone who
[27:26] who sow seed
[27:28] in a garden or has plants you realize
[27:30] that there's certain conditions that
[27:31] exist in a certain position there's some
[27:33] plants that need sunlight there's others
[27:35] that don't need a lot there's some that
[27:36] do well in some climates some that do
[27:38] well in others it's this principle now
[27:40] that the seed that was given to abraham
[27:42] was positionally placed in order to grow
[27:44] to supreme faith and our unfailing faith
[27:46] has to be in a position
[27:48] to develop correctly
[27:50] so process in abraham's life was a
[27:52] matter of god placing him in a position
[27:56] what's taking place is god getting
[27:58] abraham in a condition to receive the
[28:00] promise
[28:01] and and part of that was separation
[28:04] i got to get abraham in a frame of mind
[28:05] i got to get him in a condition i got to
[28:07] get him in a place i i need i need
[28:09] abraham to be worked on by certain
[28:11] factors and i've been pondering this and
[28:13] will identify here in a moment that god
[28:15] allows different instances of conflict
[28:19] in abraham's life and allows them to be
[28:22] addressed
[28:23] immediately so to speak in his life
[28:25] conflict comes up and god addresses it
[28:27] so that in abraham's life this is a very
[28:29] good principle for us to realize that in
[28:32] abraham's life conflict created certain
[28:34] circumstances for for something a
[28:37] character to be addressed and in
[28:39] addressing it it gave him victory and it
[28:41] put him in a a better condition to
[28:43] receive the promise
[28:45] but when the conflict came up if
[28:47] conflict is delayed addressing conflict
[28:50] is delayed and he didn't address the
[28:52] conflict in the time
[28:53] addressing conflict or delaying to
[28:55] address conflict makes conflict
[28:57] multiplied
[28:58] conflict's just going to multiply
[29:00] multiply here would be multiplying
[29:01] multiplying in abraham's heart keeping
[29:03] bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger
[29:04] bigger and it would have just exploded
[29:06] in his life and some of us are in the
[29:07] pattern of delayed addressing delayed
[29:10] addressing where conflict is multiplying
[29:12] and and in abraham these things came up
[29:15] so that he could address him so he could
[29:18] have this character development to be in
[29:19] a condition to receive the promise
[29:22] it's a conditioning
[29:23] to manifest supreme faith
[29:26] and and anybody who is maybe in an
[29:28] off-season program you start hearing
[29:29] conditioning you might wince a little
[29:30] bit
[29:32] and uh
[29:33] and say that god's god's physical
[29:35] training his physical conditioning or
[29:37] spiritual conditioning uh is to develop
[29:40] faith muscles
[29:41] and a faith endurance and so this
[29:43] condition in abraham's life is to bring
[29:45] forth this faith
[29:48] and part of it is separation
[29:50] because this is
[29:53] again part of that singular theme i want
[29:55] to have tonight
[29:57] is if abraham was joined with lot then
[29:59] god could not further manifest the
[30:01] promise
[30:02] there were some things he could do
[30:04] wasn't had he it wasn't that he woke up
[30:06] in ur one day and um he had blocked all
[30:09] his family on whatsapp and stopped
[30:11] unfriending them on facebook and like we
[30:13] can't get a hold of him what happened to
[30:14] him he changed his number
[30:15] and he just abraham just ghosted his
[30:17] family one day and er
[30:19] but it was a process where he's kind of
[30:22] he's coming out and so certain things
[30:24] are being unfolded he comes into canaan
[30:26] and he's going through continuing south
[30:29] in canaan but yet there's a there's a
[30:31] certain aspect of the promise a certain
[30:34] manifestation of the promise that would
[30:36] never manifest until he had separated
[30:39] because it's part of the condition that
[30:41] abraham had to be in
[30:43] and in christ is the mystery god
[30:45] revealed there was a few statements from
[30:46] this sermon that fit very well
[30:48] with this subject tonight
[30:50] brother brown's talking he's at the end
[30:51] of the sermon he's just worshiping
[30:52] they're singing he's praised and he says
[30:54] it's a revelation
[30:55] it's eternal as god's word is eternal
[30:58] look the threefold purpose of god's
[31:00] great mystery is revealed
[31:02] beautiful god manifested in christ
[31:05] christ manifested in the church in order
[31:07] to redeem the lost eve back to the
[31:10] original condition in the garden of eden
[31:14] i wanted to amplify this more on sunday
[31:16] this garden of eden aspect that was adam
[31:19] was placed in that abraham sought and
[31:21] his promise related to but here we can
[31:24] see that god in the end time is giving
[31:26] us a revelation in order to redeem us
[31:29] back to an original
[31:30] condition a condition that was
[31:32] represented in a promised land a perfect
[31:35] land of the garden of eden with one man
[31:37] and his wife with the promise to bring
[31:39] forth children and that's what we're
[31:41] being restored back to and that's
[31:42] patterned in abraham's journey
[31:45] it's reflected in abraham's life
[31:47] this and and i say this
[31:49] uh
[31:50] i guess this is the this is part of the
[31:52] point i'm trying to make if i haven't
[31:54] i've been clear on this
[31:56] that's why god is doing this separation
[31:58] is he wants to bring that image back up
[32:00] again
[32:02] one man and a woman were driven out of
[32:03] eden
[32:05] having lost the covenant then abraham
[32:07] comes on the scene without any power to
[32:10] bring forth children without any
[32:11] possibility to do it without any
[32:12] promised land without any possession any
[32:14] land and god is going to bring that
[32:17] image back up in abram
[32:19] so this is this is why we see these
[32:21] verses unfolding
[32:23] if you could take a look at our text now
[32:25] and walk through this in genesis chapter
[32:28] 13 verses 8 to 13 it says and abram said
[32:31] unto lot
[32:33] and we could have taken time just to
[32:34] look at how that they had
[32:36] been journeying
[32:38] and and they had different flocks and
[32:40] herds and they had become uh so great
[32:42] their substance was so great and they're
[32:44] dwelling together it was causing
[32:45] conflict and abraham says to lot there
[32:47] let there be no strife i pray thee so
[32:50] here's this conflict here's the striving
[32:52] between me and thee and between thy herb
[32:54] men and thy heard here's the wisdom of
[32:56] abraham for we be brethren he noticed
[32:58] conflict he was willing to address it
[33:00] because had he not it would have been
[33:01] conflict multiplied
[33:02] but much worse later much harder later
[33:05] to bring a separation or bring a balance
[33:07] he says is not the whole land before
[33:09] thee separate thyself i pray thee from
[33:12] me here's abram now asking for
[33:14] separation asking that they they
[33:16] withdraw he says if thou take the left
[33:18] hand then i'll go to the right if thou
[33:19] depart to the right then i will go to
[33:21] the left he's saying wherever you go
[33:22] i'll go the opposite we will separate
[33:24] you will have your own land i will have
[33:25] my own land
[33:27] now this is something notice what comes
[33:29] up within lot how he chooses
[33:32] abraham giving him first choice he says
[33:34] and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld
[33:36] all the plane of jordan that it was well
[33:38] watered everywhere before the lord
[33:40] destroyed sodom and gomorrah and notice
[33:42] the writer how he uses this language
[33:45] this is very unique in using this even
[33:47] as the garden of the lord like the land
[33:50] of egypt is thou comest unto zoar
[33:53] now think of the the parrot or the
[33:56] uh uh
[33:57] the irony in this that
[34:00] we would say that eight this is what
[34:02] abram's been promised canaan
[34:05] and he's promised something beautiful
[34:06] and something great and that his promise
[34:08] we've kind of looked beyond this to see
[34:10] that abraham is looking for a city
[34:12] uh not made with hands who's builder and
[34:14] maker is god so he's looking for this
[34:16] dwelling place he's looking for this
[34:18] tabernacle
[34:19] and you begin to look at how verdant
[34:21] this city is and the new heavens and new
[34:23] earth and how how much of a how it
[34:26] stands in comparison to the garden of
[34:28] eden and now abraham's saying lot you
[34:30] choose you go this way i'll go that way
[34:32] whatever you choose and lot's going to
[34:33] choose a place that is described even as
[34:36] the garden of the lord and then like the
[34:39] land of egypt as they come out of zoar
[34:41] there's this beautiful representation
[34:43] of this very uh fertile and gorgeous and
[34:47] beautiful landscape and and a great
[34:49] place to have cattle and a great place
[34:51] to have resources and that's what lot is
[34:53] choosing
[34:55] but notice how it's associated with
[34:56] sodom and egypt
[34:59] maybe at the time sodom wouldn't have
[35:00] had such a nasty representation but we
[35:02] know that it's there's something
[35:04] contained in those cities that signifies
[35:06] god's judgment and wickedness it says
[35:09] then lot chose him all the plane of
[35:12] jordan and lot journeyed east
[35:14] and they separated themselves the one
[35:16] from the other
[35:17] abram dwelled in the land of canaan and
[35:19] lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and
[35:21] pitched his tent toward sodom here he's
[35:23] in the nice nice region the nice land
[35:26] that but the bible wants us to recognize
[35:28] this the men of sodom were wicked and
[35:31] sinners before the lord exceedingly
[35:33] so there was more emphasis on maybe the
[35:35] resources and opportunities that the
[35:37] land represented as opposed to the
[35:39] righteousness
[35:40] of the land
[35:42] and
[35:43] this is this kind of harkens back to
[35:45] what was in my heart a moment ago and
[35:46] talking about how separation we could
[35:49] use separation kind of as a nasty tool
[35:51] to alienate ourselves and to draw
[35:53] division and to tear people down but
[35:55] abraham's separation is very precise
[35:59] it has uh
[36:01] it has a very specific purpose so when
[36:03] god is asking to separate it's not just
[36:05] kind of this arbitrary thing oh just get
[36:06] away from everybody i just want you to
[36:07] be by yourself i i i want to have you to
[36:10] my uh all to my own uh we do believe
[36:13] that god is a jealous god but this
[36:14] wasn't narcissism
[36:16] and this wasn't well i want to
[36:17] manipulate and control you so what i
[36:19] have to do is separate you and alienate
[36:20] you from all those people who love you
[36:22] and care about you this is not legalism
[36:24] this wasn't narcissism there wasn't
[36:26] anything nasty about it it's not
[36:28] arbitrary but god is being very precise
[36:30] because he has a specific purpose
[36:32] and i want this simple thought to kind
[36:34] of uh be expressed to you that god was
[36:37] wanting to focus the picture on one man
[36:40] abram and his wife sarah
[36:42] like there couldn't be anybody else in
[36:44] the picture he wanted it to be one man
[36:46] and his wife with the promise so that it
[36:48] would have the image he's kind of
[36:49] resurrected the image of adam and his
[36:52] then the woman in the garden
[36:54] and to think that geographically that
[36:56] most likely he's in the region he's very
[36:59] near the place that adam would have been
[37:00] driven out we know that he's very near
[37:02] the place where adam and the woman were
[37:04] buried and here he is in that region
[37:06] he's in that land and god saying hey you
[37:08] i am beginning in you to build that man
[37:12] again the second adam so i want to get
[37:14] you up to a spot where you and your wife
[37:16] are an opposite mirror image of adam and
[37:19] the woman being driven out of the garden
[37:21] defeated with the covenant stripped away
[37:22] from him you may look defeated abraham
[37:25] and you may look like you don't have
[37:26] children you may look like you'll never
[37:27] have a land but you're pregnant your
[37:29] life is sown with the seed of genesis 3
[37:32] 15. you will have this land you will
[37:34] have children after you and he wants
[37:36] that picture to be raised
[37:38] and that is one of the reasons why god
[37:41] causes the separation so it wouldn't
[37:44] just be abram and his all his buddies
[37:46] and his family and everything in this
[37:47] great nation going forth but it's been
[37:49] whittled down to the image
[37:51] that there was in the fall
[37:54] in the resurrection and the restoration
[37:55] of it it comes back adam and a woman
[37:58] abraham and the woman sarah
[38:00] so that's that's the emphasis i wanted
[38:02] to give
[38:04] but god not it's not just being this
[38:06] narrow part
[38:09] there's more to it why god wanted the
[38:10] separation because again lot is
[38:12] associated with babylon
[38:15] and look at the trajectory of lot's life
[38:17] he leaves with abraham
[38:20] and he travels with them to her on and
[38:22] he stays with them all the way down
[38:24] through the south they travel all the
[38:25] way down into egypt because of a famine
[38:27] lot's there because when it comes time
[38:29] to go back out into the south of canaan
[38:31] lot's right there with them we get to
[38:32] chapter uh
[38:34] later in chapter 13 abraham's finally
[38:36] hey we need to separate but think about
[38:38] lot's testimony he's associated with
[38:40] babylon he leaves babylon
[38:43] yes
[38:45] way to go lot he leaves babylon but ends
[38:47] up in sodom
[38:51] i want you to think about this type of
[38:53] lot i want you to think about what's
[38:55] represented in him and what what he
[38:57] signifies
[38:59] and what he signifies in himself
[39:01] and what kind of condition it is for to
[39:04] be in the condition of lot and what that
[39:06] would signify but then also how it
[39:08] contrasts with the life of abraham
[39:12] because here's a lot leaves babylon
[39:16] seems like he crosses over seems like
[39:18] he's in the right spot but he ends up in
[39:20] sodom
[39:22] that's what that's why lot that's why
[39:25] abraham has to be further separated
[39:29] then i want you to just look at this
[39:30] aspect or ponder this aspect
[39:33] that lot is also a possible distraction
[39:35] from the promise as a potential heir of
[39:37] abraham
[39:39] because he he's referring to him as a
[39:41] brother he's he's part of the household
[39:43] he's part of his family
[39:44] and so lot lot being there
[39:47] could always be this temptation to abram
[39:50] well maybe it's lot
[39:53] maybe he's the heir because remember the
[39:54] tension in the story of abraham wasn't
[39:56] so much that abraham would he have an
[39:59] heir because that was promised but who
[40:00] was it going to be
[40:02] is it going to be eliezer's household is
[40:04] it going to be hagar's son is it could
[40:06] it be lot he's part of my family who's
[40:08] it going to be that was the tension and
[40:11] one of those tensions in abraham's story
[40:12] and so now lot exists as an influence
[40:15] upon abraham's faith or i could say
[40:17] maybe a distraction
[40:20] from what god was calling abraham to
[40:22] fulfill
[40:24] and his character his decisions and how
[40:27] and what he stood for it stood as a
[40:29] contrast as a contrasting image to
[40:32] abraham to potentially influence abram
[40:34] away from perfect faith
[40:36] because you'll find that brother branham
[40:38] begins to dramatize lot he says he begin
[40:40] to kind of murmur a little bit
[40:43] maybe begin to complain and murmur and
[40:46] criticize
[40:48] and so lot represents and signifies this
[40:50] confusion about the promise
[40:53] these things i'm drawing these things
[40:54] right from what we're taught in the
[40:55] message of the hour lot signifies a
[40:58] mixing of the of the spiritual promise
[41:00] to abraham in the carnal mind
[41:04] to think that i could be seed of abraham
[41:06] i could be in the house of abraham i can
[41:07] be following abraham i can be so near
[41:10] the prophet abraham but yet i'm going to
[41:12] pitch my tent towards sodom
[41:14] and i'm going to i'm going to mix myself
[41:16] up with sodom and what we're seeing here
[41:18] is this temptation that exists so near
[41:20] the message of the hour
[41:23] to be right near these things but yet be
[41:25] a mixing of the promise and a mixing of
[41:28] the carnal
[41:30] and this is so this is how lot signifies
[41:32] confusion about the promise this
[41:34] influence this wrong improper image to
[41:36] where he could have stood as someone
[41:38] said well maybe this is the promise
[41:40] maybe this is right and maybe this is
[41:41] the direction god wants to go and god
[41:43] wants to separate abram from that so
[41:46] there's no confusion who the royal seat
[41:48] are
[41:52] let me say i want to say this
[41:55] in the life of abraham you can identify
[41:59] a lot of the false moves that exist
[42:00] today in the message
[42:04] you know the ones that uh there's
[42:06] certain things
[42:07] that they believe and they hold to
[42:10] and they're and they're uh
[42:12] and they're looking forward to it's just
[42:14] islam in the message
[42:17] certain things that that uh that there's
[42:19] a a pentecostalism
[42:22] and when i say that i'm referring to
[42:23] affair to walk further in the word of
[42:25] god and further to walk further in the
[42:27] unfolding of the word of god be enamored
[42:29] with the gifts
[42:30] you'll find that in bethel in the house
[42:32] of laban they were happy with the gifts
[42:34] but god had to call rebecca out further
[42:36] they had to take rachel and leah further
[42:37] there's certain things you can see these
[42:39] things reap in the life of abraham that
[42:41] are repeated in the time that we're
[42:42] living in now
[42:44] and so there's this representation that
[42:46] lot
[42:47] that lot has that god is wanting to
[42:49] separate him from
[42:51] think of it this way how that lot
[42:54] being the nephew of abraham
[42:58] so he's the son of abraham's brother so
[42:59] there was this
[43:01] lot as a nephew symbolizes the old
[43:03] nature of abraham
[43:04] or he's tied to it he's connected to it
[43:07] that in lot you see his old nature you
[43:09] see i am i'm a grandson of terror i am i
[43:12] am the son of uh of my father this is
[43:15] this is who i am i'm part of this family
[43:17] part of this bloodline this is our
[43:18] identity this is where we're from in lot
[43:20] in many ways would be a constant
[43:22] reminder to abraham what his old nature
[43:24] was what his old traditions were what
[43:26] his old nurture was
[43:28] i mean a lot would have been a reminder
[43:29] of what he was when he was in earth
[43:31] because lots never change but abraham is
[43:34] and it's always kind of hovering around
[43:36] and haunting them and always kind of
[43:37] there with them so god is saying look i
[43:39] want to separate you completely from
[43:42] your past i want to separate you
[43:43] completely from your old nature i want
[43:45] to separate you completely from that
[43:47] mindset and that attitude and that
[43:49] belief
[43:50] so lot represented this old nature and
[43:53] it stood in contrast to the election in
[43:56] grace that was evident in abram's life
[44:02] beautiful picture
[44:07] so in verse 14
[44:09] genesis chapter 13 verses 14 to 18
[44:12] it says and the lord said unto abram
[44:15] after that lot was separated from him
[44:18] the bible's being very precise
[44:22] it's mentions this not merely that we
[44:24] would understand chronologically the
[44:26] point at which god began to speak to
[44:27] abram whether it could be confused here
[44:29] he could have said it before because
[44:30] that happens you know we see abraham
[44:32] moving out of ur and it says because the
[44:34] lord god half said to abram
[44:36] get the out so there's a little bit of a
[44:38] um some details that are given and then
[44:40] some background well this is what had
[44:42] happened and even in the story of
[44:43] rebecca running to isaac it says that
[44:45] she jumped off her camel and went
[44:47] running to meet isaac and says for her
[44:49] servant had said she had asked the
[44:51] servant beforehand who is this that
[44:52] comes out to meet me it is thy master
[44:55] and that's why she jumped off and ran
[44:56] but the bible wants you to understand
[44:58] not just for the sake of chronology but
[45:01] for the sake of why god began to speak
[45:03] to him it was because he had separated
[45:05] from lot
[45:08] lord said unto abram after that lot was
[45:10] separated from you could say this way
[45:12] and the lord said unto abram because he
[45:14] had separated from lot lift up now thine
[45:17] eyes now that lord is out of the picture
[45:19] now lift up thine eyes
[45:21] now i'm going to give you a greater
[45:22] vision i'm going to give you a greater
[45:24] revelation and look from the place where
[45:25] thou art northward and southward and
[45:27] eastward and westward for all the land
[45:29] which thou seest to thee will i give it
[45:31] and to thy seed forever and i will make
[45:34] thy seed as the dust of the earth so
[45:35] that if a man can number the dust of the
[45:37] earth then shall thy seed also be
[45:39] numbered
[45:41] this happens after separation says arise
[45:44] walk through the land and the length of
[45:46] it and the breadth of it walk all right
[45:47] now you're free now you're untethered
[45:49] now start making footsteps to it now
[45:52] start possessing the promise it can't be
[45:54] it's not this group move you can't have
[45:56] this uh make believer this lukewarm
[45:58] member he can't be in this in other
[46:00] words if i can say this way there can't
[46:01] be confusion on who owns the land there
[46:04] can't be confusion on who possesses the
[46:07] promise as long as you let this person
[46:09] in the picture to seem to be an heir and
[46:11] to be just like you in every way
[46:15] then you're never gonna possess the
[46:16] promise so he gets locked completely out
[46:18] of the picture so that the so that abram
[46:21] signifies and represents something to
[46:23] you as the royal seed you say you're
[46:26] different but oh what a difference
[46:29] no matter how similar lot may be no
[46:31] matter how close they may be no matter
[46:33] how holy they might seem to be no matter
[46:34] how much the promise seems to be to them
[46:36] the fact that the bride is different
[46:38] from the church is oh what a difference
[46:42] and as long as satan could kind of
[46:43] confuse the distinction be like oh well
[46:45] i mean i guess they're just like us
[46:48] except for i don't know i mean they're
[46:50] we're different they're different no
[46:52] you're vastly different
[46:54] completely different i think the devil
[46:55] would really like to try to cause
[46:57] confusion on who each one is so god
[46:59] takes a lot and he pushes them way off
[47:01] to the side gets them out of the picture
[47:02] says now look around
[47:04] now start walking
[47:07] so that you know this promise is yours
[47:09] it's to you and your seed after you not
[47:11] just your father's house not your
[47:13] kindred not people closely associated
[47:15] with it but this is to you arise walk
[47:17] through the land the length of it in the
[47:18] breath of it i will give it to thee
[47:21] and here's the story after lot has
[47:25] settled himself down view with the view
[47:26] of sodom before him it says then abram
[47:30] removed his tent
[47:32] and came and dwelt in the plane of
[47:33] memory which is in hebron which if i
[47:36] which
[47:37] it's in this place
[47:39] the burial place the traditional barrier
[47:41] place of adam and the woman
[47:44] the plane of memory which is in hebron
[47:45] and built there an altar unto
[47:48] the lord
[47:49] bill abraham said until he did that the
[47:51] lord stayed away from abraham
[47:54] direct statement until he did that the
[47:57] lord stayed away from abraham
[48:00] so once abraham and sarah separated and
[48:03] they were alone then god came to him
[48:07] god had been there's things that god had
[48:08] been doing been leading him guiding him
[48:11] speaking promises to him but now he says
[48:14] once he had separated now the lord could
[48:16] come to him in a more personal way now
[48:18] the lord can make the promise even
[48:20] greater give him more revelation once he
[48:22] had separated once it was him and his
[48:24] wife separated out then god came to him
[48:26] you say well why well partly to get to
[48:28] the image of genesis chapter 2 and then
[48:31] also because everything that lot
[48:33] represented
[48:34] that further separation out of babylon
[48:36] further separation even with the land of
[48:39] canaan to the seed the bride the elect
[48:44] now that is
[48:46] separated out
[48:47] brother and said god came to him the
[48:48] lord stayed away from him until he did
[48:50] that
[48:51] now he's come to this image it says in
[48:53] genesis 17 1 when abram was 90 and you
[48:55] 90 years old and nine the lord appeared
[48:58] to abram
[48:59] and said unto him i am the almighty god
[49:03] look at what happened in abraham's life
[49:04] once he separated genesis 14. he's got
[49:07] power to run off in the rescue lot then
[49:08] melchizedek come and meets him genesis
[49:10] 15 he appears to him in a vision i am
[49:12] thy shield and thy buckle i am thys
[49:14] exceeding great reward and he's speaking
[49:17] giving him visions and he and revealing
[49:19] himself genesis 17 now he hears the
[49:21] voice of the lord and god speaks to me
[49:23] appears to him says i am the almighty
[49:25] god walk before me and be thou perfect
[49:28] can i say it this way walk with me
[49:32] this is what he's wanting to this is
[49:33] what he's wanting to portray here's adam
[49:36] and the woman they have this particular
[49:38] image god is raising it back up so what
[49:40] does he do to abraham once he's
[49:42] separated once he's in this place he's
[49:44] in memory and he's in this plane in
[49:47] hebron there god says now walk with me
[49:49] and be perfect
[49:51] genesis chapter 18 he appears to him
[49:53] once again veiled and flesh this is the
[49:55] acceleration of the promise this is the
[49:58] further manifestation of melchizedek and
[50:00] got himself to abram once he had
[50:02] separated then god came to him
[50:05] making himself more pronounced and known
[50:07] to him walk with me be perfect walk with
[50:10] me and be perfect that's the result of
[50:11] walking with them
[50:13] what does this signify what does this
[50:15] represent genesis 3 8
[50:18] i know this is in the judgment scene but
[50:19] says they heard the voice of the lord
[50:20] god walking in the garden in the cool of
[50:23] the day
[50:25] what did it signify the presence of the
[50:27] lord
[50:28] this was not a strange incident
[50:31] this wasn't they sinned and all said and
[50:32] god showed up but this was something
[50:34] that was customary
[50:36] then in the cool of the evening god
[50:37] himself would come his presence would be
[50:39] declared by his voice and says the voice
[50:41] of the lord walking in the garden
[50:44] declaring the presence of god brother
[50:45] brahm said she and her husband walk in
[50:47] the cool of the garden in the evening
[50:49] and talked face to face with god
[50:52] this is the image in the garden of eden
[50:54] one man and his wife and a god who comes
[50:57] to him and walks with him and makes
[50:59] himself known face to face so then in
[51:02] the life of abram once he's separated
[51:04] out from lot melchizedek comes down and
[51:06] serves him communion god appears to him
[51:08] in a vision god speaks him in genesis 17
[51:10] then he comes down again veiled in flesh
[51:12] and after the two messengers go down
[51:14] into sodom there he is revealed himself
[51:17] and his plan further to abram and his
[51:19] wife wow that's the pattern that was in
[51:21] the garden that's what god is wanting to
[51:23] resurrect and bring back up so he
[51:25] portrays it in abraham where she and her
[51:28] husband adam and the woman walked in the
[51:30] cool of the garden the evening and talk
[51:31] face to face with god then abram is
[51:34] doing the same thing in hebron
[51:37] in the plain
[51:39] emra
[51:42] and then not to leave don't want to
[51:44] leave us out
[51:45] because what is this signifying and
[51:47] representing the seed which is christ
[51:50] the royal seed witches
[51:52] you
[51:54] what
[51:55] you just think of all the things that we
[51:57] have been taught in the message of the
[51:59] hour adam was given a bride to reproduce
[52:02] himself
[52:03] she fell
[52:04] christ was given a bride to reproduce
[52:06] himself
[52:07] she fell but in the end there'll be
[52:10] a wife who won't fail
[52:13] there will be a wife that won't fail and
[52:15] so you represent the redemption
[52:18] you say god was going to make that woman
[52:19] again
[52:21] he made the man again the second adam
[52:22] and he never failed but he wants to
[52:24] bring forth a woman that will never fail
[52:27] and this is who you are and who you
[52:29] represent
[52:30] and so this is a beautiful principle to
[52:33] to consider that we're taught in the
[52:35] message of the hour the millennium
[52:37] is
[52:38] is a restoration of an eden condition
[52:41] that existed on earth
[52:44] before
[52:45] the new heavens and the new earth and
[52:46] the eighth day in the new jerusalem
[52:49] comes down to settle on the new heavens
[52:50] and the new earth right that'll then be
[52:52] a a eden we can say restored but
[52:55] something that god was always hiding and
[52:57] holding back because that's what he was
[52:59] going to achieve and he hid the plan of
[53:01] redemption so then god allows the
[53:03] millennium to unfold and this is what
[53:04] brother brahma said as adam and eve were
[53:06] in the garden and did not finish out the
[53:08] thousand years now jesus our last adam
[53:12] in his eve the true church will fulfill
[53:15] all the plan of god
[53:18] the bride with her bridegroom in the
[53:21] millennium is going to fulfill all the
[53:23] plan of god so what was interrupted in
[53:25] genesis 3 the plan of god what is
[53:27] resurrected in genesis chapter 12 the
[53:30] plan of god what is finished with you
[53:32] and the bridegroom the plan of god
[53:37] this beautiful picture and pattern this
[53:39] profile in
[53:40] abraham but the mike if you'd come
[53:43] i'd like to finish with this statement
[53:45] from abraham and his seat after him
[53:50] he says so now
[53:52] it's by grace that god called you not
[53:54] what you did not what you could do or
[53:57] what you will do
[53:58] can we just accept that
[54:01] it's not what we did it's not what you
[54:03] could do it's not what you will do it's
[54:06] all him
[54:08] we should have there there's just
[54:10] there's this this carnal brag is not in
[54:12] this at all
[54:13] if you are the seed of abraham god spoke
[54:16] to you by his amazing grace
[54:18] just like he did abraham in the 12th
[54:19] chapter of genesis
[54:22] god's going to give you the same
[54:23] experience that abraham had
[54:26] as soon as abraham believed god by
[54:28] justification believe in the lord we are
[54:29] justified
[54:30] immediately god called abraham to total
[54:33] separation from all unbelief
[54:36] again this is what's represented in lot
[54:39] not so much that you need to get away
[54:41] from your uh your brother's son
[54:44] we can't have any nephews in our life
[54:46] that's it's it's not this physical
[54:48] isolation and dividing families and
[54:51] and being nasty with it it's the
[54:53] unbelief primarily the unbelief
[54:56] he says he had to separate from all in
[54:58] belief that's what he's that's what he's
[54:59] done you
[55:00] separate yourself from your kindred from
[55:02] all your associates come out of the pool
[55:03] room come out of the dance hall come
[55:06] away from the things of the world that's
[55:08] what it represents
[55:10] god calls for a total separation to
[55:12] abraham's seed
[55:14] because that's what he's called that's
[55:16] what he called abraham and notice the
[55:18] question he asked
[55:20] are you patterning it
[55:24] is that a word
[55:26] patterning
[55:28] that's what you're doing that he said
[55:30] are you following in that pattern
[55:32] are you patterning abraham we need to
[55:34] ask ourselves he's the profile
[55:38] he he's the he's the pattern
[55:41] he's the image are we following in that
[55:43] image
[55:44] is my life fallen as an example isn't it
[55:47] beautiful to look back and relate to the
[55:49] life of abraham and abraham had faith to
[55:52] offer his son on mount moriah and i have
[55:54] faith to believe for the change of this
[55:56] body because i'm going through the same
[55:58] paces and the same process as my father
[56:00] abraham
[56:02] going through the exact same thing that
[56:04] he did
[56:05] being put in the position to have that
[56:08] unfailing faith
[56:09] are you patterning it
[56:14] this instrument is abraham i thought
[56:16] that was just such a
[56:18] tremendous statement
[56:20] this instrument is abraham
[56:22] an instrument is something that's used
[56:23] to accomplish a person purpose
[56:27] it's a it's a means by which something
[56:28] is done an instrument to do something or
[56:30] is something that's used for a purpose
[56:33] but also it's used to measure
[56:36] something that's used to record
[56:39] something used to control
[56:41] so abraham is god's means of recording
[56:44] it's his means of of measuring
[56:49] the instrument is abraham
[56:52] and we're measuring ourselves by this
[56:53] instrument abraham this instrument
[56:55] represents this seed after him so he's
[56:58] the control
[56:59] he's the measure
[57:01] he's also the means by which something
[57:03] was accomplished he's also uh the the
[57:05] what's used for a particular purpose but
[57:07] now he's the he's the measure he's the
[57:09] recording he's the controlling he
[57:12] represents this seed after him and the
[57:13] covenant was made to both abraham and
[57:16] his seed after him
[57:18] and as abraham was called by grace by
[57:20] election so was his seed called by grace
[57:23] and election
[57:25] they heard the voice of god and believed
[57:26] god and it was imputed unto him for
[57:28] righteousness heard the voice of god in
[57:30] a bar room everywhere it was and
[57:32] believed god
[57:34] and abraham was commanded to abstain and
[57:37] to separate himself from the things of
[57:39] the world and so is the seed of abraham
[57:42] separate themselves from the seed
[57:45] of the things
[57:47] of the world
[57:49] but a beautiful picture that god wants
[57:50] to paint in the life of
[57:52] abraham we went into a little bit more
[57:55] detail about lot
[57:57] just just to understand
[57:59] how god is wanting to use this figure in
[58:01] abraham's life to express something to
[58:03] us
[58:04] unbelief
[58:06] the lingering
[58:08] influence of babylon
[58:10] and how it ends up in sodom and gomorrah
[58:13] how it was drawn to
[58:15] the well-watered plains and it was drawn
[58:17] to the beauty of this natural life but
[58:19] yet was lurking behind all that was this
[58:22] wickedness
[58:23] which is exactly what mr babylon is
[58:26] and how abraham was content to watch his
[58:29] nephew choose the choicest land and
[58:31] abraham is content because he knows it's
[58:33] all his anyways
[58:36] and so god comes to him afterwards and
[58:38] says i want you to look around as much
[58:40] as you can see and in in perfect not
[58:43] just in
[58:45] by way of assumption
[58:46] he's actually telling look
[58:48] around and as he looked around he would
[58:51] have seen exactly where lot was
[58:54] and everywhere else also god reminds
[58:56] abraham don't be jealous don't be
[58:57] worried i'm going to give it all to you
[58:59] anyways
[59:01] don't be as david in the psalms would
[59:03] fret why did the wicked prosper and why
[59:05] did they flourish and why did they get
[59:07] away with this and why did they get with
[59:08] that god comes to abraham and says
[59:10] listen don't for a moment be bothered by
[59:13] lot getting the best in this life or
[59:16] getting the best right now it's all
[59:18] yours anyways listen laodicea has
[59:21] nothing you should be jealous of the
[59:23] world has nothing you should be jealous
[59:25] of there's no position no prestige no
[59:27] popularity politics whatever it might be
[59:30] there's nothing you should allow to
[59:32] cause any kind of sting or bitterness in
[59:35] your spirit as the world would want to
[59:37] intimidate you and wave it in your face
[59:39] it's all going to be yours eventually
[59:41] anyways
[59:43] man i may not ever be able to have a
[59:44] house in cave creek
[59:46] but it's mine anyways
[59:49] i may not ever be able to own a house in
[59:51] a high rent district i may now be able
[59:52] to do this i may not have a video i may
[59:54] not be able to vacation in paris i mean
[59:56] i'll build that but one day it's all
[59:58] gonna be mine anyways why i'm the royal
[1:00:00] seat of abraham look south look north
[1:00:02] look east look west this world has
[1:00:05] nothing that's not yours
[1:00:10] it's all yours eventually
[1:00:12] he's wanting abraham just to rest
[1:00:14] don't worry what lot has
[1:00:17] and so he brings the separation he
[1:00:19] brings the divide to put abram in the
[1:00:20] pattern and the profile of adam the
[1:00:22] woman
[1:00:23] because god's going to build that man
[1:00:24] again
[1:00:26] and then it starts speaking do you see
[1:00:27] how much more it speaks to us
[1:00:29] layer after layer volume after volume
[1:00:32] the example of abraham's life
[1:00:35] thank you for your attention tonight
[1:00:36] could we stand together
[1:00:47] what a privilege we have in this hour
[1:00:50] to walk with him
[1:00:52] what a beautiful privilege we have
[1:00:56] under the opening of this word
[1:00:58] as he speaks to us in such
[1:01:00] beautiful poetry
[1:01:01] would you walk with me
[1:01:04] let's purpose in our hearts to do that
[1:01:05] more perfectly
[1:01:07] walk with him with our heads bowed
[1:01:09] let's remember the various needs that we
[1:01:10] have in our assembly
[1:01:12] different families at home
[1:01:14] sick
[1:01:14] i got a text message today from a family
[1:01:17] that they're traveling they're out of
[1:01:18] town and
[1:01:19] just remember them in prayer those
[1:01:20] different ones
[1:01:21] our gracious heavenly father
[1:01:23] [Music]
[1:01:28] we praise you
[1:01:31] we honor you
[1:01:34] there is no god like you
[1:01:37] there is no other god besides thee
[1:01:41] we recognize you to be the supreme one
[1:01:44] [Music]
[1:01:46] the god above all the god that is in all
[1:01:50] from you alone proceeded forth creation
[1:01:53] light and time and matter
[1:01:56] your hands made the heavens
[1:02:00] your voice fashioned the universe and
[1:02:02] brought forth the earth
[1:02:05] and in your greatness lord as we praise
[1:02:07] you and magnify you for your greatness
[1:02:09] lord we offer thanksgiving for it's in
[1:02:11] this
[1:02:13] grandeur of creation and the endless
[1:02:16] endless galaxies and the numerous
[1:02:19] innumerable stars
[1:02:22] in the midst of all of it your attention
[1:02:24] and your focus is on us
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:28] you wanted to express something so
[1:02:29] beautiful in the life of abraham that in
[1:02:30] the mass of humanity and the
[1:02:33] millions that may have populated the
[1:02:34] earth at the time you come to one man
[1:02:36] and say i'm calling you and your wife
[1:02:38] and i'm gonna separate you to where i
[1:02:39] finally get you alone
[1:02:41] without even children
[1:02:43] alone
[1:02:45] and i'll start there
[1:02:48] with a beautiful beautiful picture lord
[1:02:52] and i pray father today that we could
[1:02:55] check our lives to be sure that we're
[1:02:57] patterning
[1:02:58] after abraham
[1:03:01] not that we should have any kind of
[1:03:02] nastiness or vitriol towards those that
[1:03:04] we disagree with or those that have hurt
[1:03:06] us or harmed us or those that we have
[1:03:08] conflict with because abraham
[1:03:09] demonstrated that he can handle conflict
[1:03:12] and remain in relationship with a family
[1:03:14] member
[1:03:16] but he stood his ground and he separated
[1:03:18] and he was in the promise and he
[1:03:19] received the visitations
[1:03:21] may we be able to walk in the same
[1:03:23] pattern
[1:03:24] have that same spirit of a christian
[1:03:26] that abraham exhibited
[1:03:28] so that we can have this
[1:03:31] we could have a more rich experience
[1:03:33] with you lord
[1:03:35] if you stayed away until
[1:03:37] abraham had fully obeyed your promise
[1:03:39] what other areas of our life lord
[1:03:42] are we missing out on your great
[1:03:43] blessings because there's areas of
[1:03:44] disobedience
[1:03:46] some spot in our lives that we have not
[1:03:48] yielded to some place in our life that
[1:03:51] we have not surrendered some some ask of
[1:03:54] us that you have asked us to do that we
[1:03:56] have not done that keeps your presence
[1:03:58] from being made manifest oh lord
[1:04:00] may we refrain no longer
[1:04:03] may we be willing lord
[1:04:06] to
[1:04:07] receive that promise
[1:04:10] to walk in obedience to it
[1:04:13] that your presence could be manifested
[1:04:14] more greatly in our lives
[1:04:16] but further revelation lord even some of
[1:04:18] us kind of get stoved up a little bit
[1:04:20] and we're not walking and understanding
[1:04:22] and we're not further
[1:04:24] being quickened by the message of the
[1:04:25] hour lord if we could just separate from
[1:04:27] those things that are holding us back
[1:04:29] revelation is waiting to be poured out
[1:04:30] upon us
[1:04:32] oh god may we obey you tonight
[1:04:34] whatever unique particular way we find
[1:04:36] ourselves in disobedience father we
[1:04:39] pledge to devote ourselves and to come
[1:04:41] back to you and walk in obedience
[1:04:44] that we might experience a further
[1:04:45] unfolding of your word to us
[1:04:47] bless us we pray now as we're soon
[1:04:49] dismissed may your presence go with us
[1:04:51] be with those that are hurting those
[1:04:52] that are sick those that are mourning
[1:04:54] lost loved ones those that
[1:04:56] have decisions that they're facing and
[1:04:58] they need your confirmation i pray
[1:04:59] father you grant it
[1:05:02] reveal yourself make yourself known
[1:05:05] be with brother elias lord have a grace
