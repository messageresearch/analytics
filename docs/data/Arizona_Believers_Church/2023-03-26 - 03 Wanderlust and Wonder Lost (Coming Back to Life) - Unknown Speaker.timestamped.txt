[0:00] Oh, there's just so much in these
[0:01] verses. I hope I have time to get to
[0:03] them at the end and and touch on some of
[0:06] the vers things that are expressed in
[0:08] this. They've been very inspirational to
[0:09] me. A number of different scriptures. Uh
[0:12] we're continue on the subject of wonder,
[0:14] lust, and wonder lost. This is the third
[0:16] service. Uh I believe our kind of our
[0:19] thesis statement or our subject has been
[0:21] finding uh the wonder of Christ and the
[0:24] awe of Christ in an age of wonder lust.
[0:27] And those terms uh should be familiar to
[0:29] you by now if you've uh been in the
[0:31] services. And when we t use the phrase
[0:34] wonder lost, we're specifically thinking
[0:37] about Christ and how that uh we're
[0:39] unable to find satisfaction in Christ
[0:42] alone or maybe there's this uneasiness
[0:44] or this unrest to where we're not
[0:46] finding excitement in Christ. We're not
[0:48] finding joy in Christ, enthusiasm in
[0:50] Christ. And maybe at one time we did and
[0:53] now that we don't, we don't feel it just
[0:55] the same way. and we rationalize, well,
[0:56] maybe I'm just maturing and uh maybe I'm
[0:59] just going through a difficult time and
[1:00] maybe there's a lot of ways we wrestle
[1:02] with what that means to have uh not have
[1:04] the same enthusiasm for the things of
[1:06] God anymore. But what I would be maybe
[1:09] even looking at is it just we're not
[1:11] filled with that joy as David even said,
[1:13] "Restore to me the joy of my salvation."
[1:15] You may not lose your salvation. You may
[1:17] not lose Christ because you've gained
[1:19] him through the new birth, but maybe
[1:21] there's just that wonder that's lost.
[1:23] And that's what we're looking at when we
[1:25] use the phrase wonder loss. But the
[1:26] wonder lust is very specific. We've
[1:30] defined this in different ways over the
[1:31] first few ser couple services, but I
[1:34] would say it's just kind of those
[1:35] pointless pursuits where we're just kind
[1:37] of we're doing them without necessarily
[1:39] a goal in mind, but it's just something
[1:41] we find ourselves doing to scratch an
[1:44] itch or satisfy some desire. I want us
[1:46] to think in terms of vain habits, things
[1:48] that we do habitually and over and over
[1:50] again. But if we think is where is this
[1:53] getting me in progression and where what
[1:55] what kind of progress am I making in
[1:57] life and what kind of things are being
[1:59] achieved by these pursuits and the
[2:01] things that I'm doing and can I say that
[2:04] it is bringing me good or that it's
[2:06] accomplishing something important and
[2:07] and I would mean this in just about any
[2:09] area of your life whether it be
[2:11] professionally or personally or uh
[2:12] interpersonal relationships and
[2:14] different things. This wonder lust
[2:16] speaks of just chasing an empty thrill,
[2:19] chasing an empty pleasure to where
[2:21] there's really nothing good coming out
[2:23] of it. Uh but it's it's kind of like the
[2:25] idea, oh, it doesn't matter where you're
[2:26] going, it's all about the journey. And
[2:28] that might sound very very freeing and
[2:30] that might f uh find sound really really
[2:33] good, but when you really start to think
[2:34] about it, you find, wait a minute,
[2:36] that's not how God has designed this. Uh
[2:39] we were sister Elizabeth and I were out
[2:41] walking and saw a sign that said um you
[2:44] know follow your heart you know listen
[2:46] to the wind and and it said all this
[2:48] stuff and then it said chief so and so
[2:50] and I said I want to put one right next
[2:51] to it saying chief so and so is wrong
[2:53] god right because it's kind of like this
[2:55] whole like just follow your spirit just
[2:57] follow the journey wherever it leads you
[2:59] and there's this super spiritualism
[3:00] sometimes uh that's co-opting certain
[3:03] things and we think oh that sounds right
[3:04] but God is got god is intentional we're
[3:08] goal oriented. We're ambitious. And so,
[3:10] we don't want to become uh message
[3:12] hipsters that are just trying to free
[3:14] ourselves and just be ourselves, but we
[3:16] want we need to have the right kind of
[3:18] ambition. And this wonder loss lust to
[3:21] me is a phrase that's kind of capturing
[3:23] just how aimless we can be in our daily
[3:26] lives. And I am wanting this to be
[3:27] relevant to our daily lives. Amen.
[3:29] But that's something we've tried to
[3:30] point out in terms of suffering,
[3:32] impatience that it's not uh the
[3:35] calamities and the traumas that get that
[3:37] that's referring to alone, but it's
[3:39] things that are applicable in our daily
[3:41] lives. And so this uh restoring the
[3:44] wonder that is lost uh we've been saying
[3:47] begins with recognizing the cause of our
[3:50] wonder lust, the cause of our kind of
[3:52] aimless pursuits, the cause of our
[3:53] drifting, the cause of our uh vain
[3:56] habits and kind of those pointless
[3:58] pursuits that we're engaging in. If we
[3:59] can recognize what's causing that, that
[4:02] puts us in that position to say to come
[4:04] out of the wonderlust and restore the
[4:06] wonder of Christ. Now I want to take a
[4:09] few moments to review last uh Sunday
[4:13] morning on the death of patience and uh
[4:16] that's patience and the virtue patience
[4:18] and so the on the death of patience just
[4:21] wanting to summarize it in where we
[4:24] ended up not necessarily walk through it
[4:25] but just summarize it as a whole and
[4:28] look at it this way just from a natural
[4:31] human being experience perspective and
[4:33] just our humanity our minds are being
[4:35] conditioned to pursue cheap rewards. s
[4:38] that there's so many things we engage
[4:40] in, whether it be accumulating points at
[4:42] a grocery store or or scratching off not
[4:45] necessarily lottery tickets, but little
[4:47] extra game cards you're given at
[4:49] restaurants and things. Our minds are
[4:50] being conditioned to uh pursue
[4:53] meaningless re rewards, meaningless
[4:55] moments that kind of give us this idea
[4:57] of, oh, I've satisfied something. Oh,
[4:59] there's a mystery behind this curtain.
[5:00] There's something taking place. And our
[5:03] minds are being conditioned to want that
[5:05] and seek for that. And so today I want
[5:08] you to think about bad habits. And when
[5:11] I say bad habits, it's not necessarily
[5:13] drugs or anything like that. Though if
[5:15] it's applicable, let it be applicable.
[5:17] Uh but want you to think about bad
[5:19] habits or just routines, things that we
[5:21] do in routine or by routine and ask
[5:24] ourselves what's the driving force
[5:26] behind it. What is it producing in the
[5:28] end? And maybe I'm kind of maybe uh
[5:30] revealing myself a little bit now. And
[5:32] even ask ourselves, do I even like this?
[5:35] and and and real challenge ourselves in
[5:36] that because our minds are being
[5:38] conditioned to pursue experiences that
[5:41] really in themselves are empty. And so
[5:43] we looked at how that patience is a
[5:45] virtue. That virtue, God-given virtue,
[5:47] to endure something, uh to persevere
[5:49] despite circumstances that even if it
[5:51] gets difficult and the payoff seems far
[5:53] away and we don't see that it's going to
[5:55] be easy, patience is what helps us to
[5:58] persevere through difficulty in order to
[6:01] achieve a goal. and and and we and we
[6:03] have faith that begins to work then with
[6:06] patience and it gives patience a job to
[6:08] do and patience then is upholding our
[6:10] faith and working together with our
[6:12] faith to see the fruits of our faith and
[6:14] the fruits of our believing and God has
[6:17] created us then we look how that God
[6:20] extends to us incentives he holds out to
[6:22] us a reward and this is piggybacking off
[6:24] the things we preached about in judgment
[6:26] and rewards and so he's kind of created
[6:28] us uh to be able to experience and enjoy
[6:32] rewards part of the way that he's made
[6:34] us up. And I'll say this, whether you
[6:36] agree that God made us that way, at
[6:37] least we can agree that's the way we are
[6:39] now. And God knows that's the way we've
[6:41] evolved and the way our thinking is now
[6:43] wired. But because God offers to us
[6:46] rewards or offers us to in incentives
[6:49] and we have faith to believe in them, we
[6:51] need the patience that leads us to the
[6:53] payoff that leads us to the reward. So
[6:55] patience leads to rewards.
[6:57] And how we made this kind of all these
[7:00] different things about patience relevant
[7:02] is that there is now a prevalence of
[7:05] things that manipulate our emotions and
[7:08] and that and in manipulating it bypasses
[7:11] patience that we use the phrase that
[7:13] reverse engineered that Satan has
[7:15] reverse engineered the way that God has
[7:17] made us. He's reverse engineered God's
[7:19] rewards program. God holds us out shows
[7:21] us a reward or incentive and we labor to
[7:24] that reward. And the devil says, "Wow,
[7:26] this is the way that we're wired. This
[7:28] is the way that human beings respond to
[7:30] things. This is what they look for." Uh
[7:32] they're they're made a certain way. And
[7:33] God has worked with that and fashioned
[7:35] us a certain way. But what he does is he
[7:37] always impersonates. And he's come up
[7:39] with a cheap knockoff that has shortened
[7:42] that space from desire to satisfaction
[7:45] and and where we don't need patience
[7:47] anymore. And he's kind of reverse
[7:48] engineered it and figured it out. And so
[7:50] many of our information and
[7:52] communication technologies are tricking
[7:55] us by providing these feelings of
[7:57] satisfaction, these feelings of rewards
[7:59] in things that are actually empty in
[8:01] vain,
[8:01] right?
[8:02] Where you you do something. and you
[8:03] click a button and confetti and balloons
[8:06] and everything happens and you're like
[8:10] right and and we make we feel like
[8:12] something has happened and we feel good
[8:14] and we read a statement where our brain
[8:16] chemistry is actually fooling us into
[8:18] thinking we're accomplishing something
[8:20] in chemically this is just
[8:22] scientifically there's this dopamine
[8:24] release in our brains and and it we go
[8:26] oh that felt good and this is just
[8:28] what's happening when you enjoy the
[8:29] things that you enjoy and we don't
[8:31] necessarily say oh dopamine bad this is
[8:33] just the way that we are. This is the
[8:34] way that things work. And if it seems
[8:36] scientific, I want you to I'm going to
[8:38] look into the word in a greater detail
[8:39] today to show it's just it's scriptural.
[8:41] And when we experience that, we want it
[8:44] more. And we continues to lead to more,
[8:47] lead to more, and lead to more. So these
[8:48] systems, whether it be your apps, your
[8:50] games, technologies, and pursuits, so
[8:52] many different things are giving us this
[8:54] magical effect of overcoming, this
[8:57] magical effect of accomplishing
[8:58] something. But it's bypassing bypassing
[9:01] patience. And it's and we're not using
[9:04] patience in the way and we're not using
[9:06] rewards in the way that God intends for
[9:08] them to be used.
[9:10] And so in some of the things that you
[9:12] do, you say, "Well, brother Aaron, this
[9:13] is hard or this is difficult. I always
[9:14] feel a sense of satisfaction with a lot
[9:16] of the systems we're using those ICT,
[9:18] information, communication, media,
[9:20] movies, music, you name it. It's
[9:22] calculated tension.
[9:24] It's calculated stress. It's a
[9:26] calculated uh uh uh formula and
[9:28] algorithm that they're using to uh get
[9:30] you to engage and interact and then give
[9:33] you the payoff at just the right moment
[9:35] so that you'll continue to inter engage
[9:36] and interact. And so these things are by
[9:38] design where they're really giving us
[9:40] synthetic experiences and not real
[9:42] experiences.
[9:44] And so I I just want to I want to
[9:47] introduce our next subject, but I want
[9:49] just trying to find some ways to des uh
[9:51] summarize where we were last Sunday.
[9:54] And one of the thoughts that kept coming
[9:56] back to my mind over this past week and
[9:58] I want to use the the term
[10:00] um not loosely but in a way to identify
[10:03] certain things but maybe not in a strict
[10:05] uh medical definition but this this
[10:09] chemical reaction in our brains when we
[10:10] do something we exert ourselves we try
[10:12] something we get the reward we get
[10:13] something out of it that what we're
[10:15] calling that dopamine release uh it
[10:17] create it can create an addiction
[10:20] and they're finding that this release
[10:21] that we get in our brains financial
[10:23] rewards trigger the same neurons as a
[10:25] cocaine addiction. Playing video games
[10:27] fire the same neurons as a cocaine
[10:29] addiction,
[10:30] right?
[10:31] And I'm trusting that's in relation to
[10:33] games and not cocaine. The amens I just
[10:36] got. But there's certain things that you
[10:38] fire off and you think, "Oh, those drug
[10:40] addicts and those people heroin, those
[10:42] people who are addicted to cocaine, oh,
[10:44] they're bad or they've got this
[10:46] problem." But it's the same brain
[10:47] process that's taking place with a lot
[10:49] of other soft addictions. As a matter of
[10:51] fact, they even say it's the same with
[10:53] drinking coffee.
[11:02] We're getting into the real stuff today.
[11:05] But it creates an addiction. And not
[11:06] only in creating this addiction or soft
[11:08] addiction, and maybe I just use air
[11:09] quotes for addiction, but it conditions
[11:11] you for more, for that payoff, for that
[11:13] feeling. And to tie this back into
[11:16] patience and the death of patience, and
[11:17] we'll go back over a few scriptures as
[11:19] we go on, that as as things come too
[11:23] easily, our patience dies,
[11:25] right? Because if if I'm able to do
[11:27] something to get the payoff quickly,
[11:29] then I won't do things that are harder.
[11:32] I won't do things that I need to
[11:33] perseverance. If we get rewarded too
[11:35] often, if we get rewarded too easily,
[11:37] then our patience dies, our endurance
[11:39] dies, and what what comes to life is
[11:41] impatience. And so with the death of
[11:43] patience uh has come at a great cost to
[11:46] other things in our life. So my title
[11:48] today and appreciate you just being
[11:49] patient with me as we went through that.
[11:52] Uh my title today is coming back to life
[11:56] and it's just continuing on the thought
[11:58] of death of patience.
[12:01] coming back to life and as we read it in
[12:03] Jeremiah through reviving hope we want
[12:05] to come back to patience and and and
[12:08] looking at reviving hope and we want to
[12:12] uh in coming back to life we're I wanted
[12:14] to cultivate this is in our own in our
[12:16] own personal lives what we're going
[12:17] through what we're experiencing uh
[12:19] cultivate real substance in our lives
[12:21] real things instead of the carnal
[12:23] emptiness that the world seems to offer
[12:25] us so much of so coming back to life is
[12:28] um our subject today if you'll turn your
[12:30] Bibles to proverb Proverbs chapter
[12:31] 13:12.
[12:35] Proverbs chapter 13:12.
[12:38] I'm going to read this scripture and
[12:40] start here because my I've been studying
[12:41] on the subject of hope and you'll see
[12:44] this in a moment how that uh this
[12:46] patience and hope work together. But
[12:48] this is said of our human condition.
[12:51] Proverbs 13:12, hope deferred maketh the
[12:54] heart sick, but when the desire cometh,
[12:57] it is a tree of life.
[12:59] So this wisdom is giving us a window
[13:02] into human nature that with if hope is
[13:05] deferred or drawn out. If what you're
[13:08] hoping for and when it says hope there
[13:10] it's thinking of the thing longed for if
[13:13] it seems a way a far off and it's drawn
[13:16] out it says it makes the heart sick. So
[13:18] now this is this speaks to why we need
[13:21] patience. how strong of a virtue
[13:23] patience is and how it's important
[13:25] because if you that you have this hope
[13:27] something desired and if it's a far off
[13:29] thing it says it makes the heart sick.
[13:31] In other words, when we don't get what
[13:33] we really want and we don't get the
[13:34] thing that we desire, our mind gets
[13:36] anxious. It causes us some turmoil. Our
[13:38] heart loses hope. It causes us to faint.
[13:41] I it said hope that is a long ways away.
[13:43] The thing you want if it seems too far
[13:45] away, it makes us uh sick emotionally.
[13:47] It causes anxiety. It causes us dread.
[13:50] causes our heart to lose strength or or
[13:52] to faint. It's exactly what the
[13:54] scripture says, hope deferred maketh the
[13:56] heart sick. And this is why the Bible
[13:58] tells us we have need of patience. That
[14:00] if you hope for something and you're
[14:02] kind of wired in such a way that if
[14:04] you're looking for something and it
[14:05] seems a long way off, the tendency is
[14:08] for you to physically, emotionally get
[14:10] discouraged. And so you need patience to
[14:12] kind of support you. that when
[14:14] something's a long ways off, says we
[14:16] have need of patience. That if God gave
[14:17] a promise and it looks like this hope is
[14:19] a long ways away, we need it because
[14:21] when patience isn't there to support us,
[14:23] our hearts become weak.
[14:25] If patience isn't there to lift us up
[14:27] and patience isn't there to have a job
[14:29] to do, then then our hearts fail and our
[14:31] hearts become sick. In Romans chapter 5,
[14:34] and remember this scripture because
[14:35] we're not done with it yet. Hope
[14:36] deferred maketh the heart sick. and
[14:38] Romans chapter 5:es 3 and 4. And not
[14:41] only so, but we glory in tribulations
[14:43] also. And tribulation is pressure,
[14:46] distress. It's not just uh being beaten
[14:49] uh by the Catholic Church or being
[14:51] crucified as a martyr. But we glory in
[14:53] tribulation knowing that tribulation,
[14:55] stress, pressure workketh patience.
[14:58] We looked at that that that suffering
[15:01] long longsuffering that enduring and
[15:03] patience workketh experience. Experience
[15:06] is proven character. These aren't just
[15:09] experiences or moments and oh I
[15:11] experienced a sunset. I experienced a a
[15:13] roller coaster ride. I experienced uh
[15:15] this situation or that situation.
[15:16] Experiences proven character and proven
[15:19] character workketh hope and that hope
[15:22] there is the expectation of good. Uh
[15:26] this kind of hope produces a confidence.
[15:28] This kind of hope produces a joy or
[15:30] satisfaction. And so if we look at this
[15:33] formula that faith workketh patience and
[15:35] here we see that tribulation workketh
[15:37] patience and so therefore because we
[15:39] have faith the effect of tribulation
[15:41] isn't a fainting heart but it actually
[15:43] gives patience a job to do. If we have
[15:45] faith and you suffer then it's like
[15:46] faith is like hey patience it's your
[15:48] turn and patience steps in. And then as
[15:51] patience does her job then it works
[15:53] proven character and if you have proven
[15:55] character you can expect good.
[15:58] And this is exactly what happens if
[16:00] patience if we look at patients dying.
[16:02] If patience dies then our character
[16:04] suffers and if our character suffers our
[16:06] hope fades.
[16:07] Amen.
[16:08] This is a formula for you as a believer.
[16:10] I can say this confidently. If we're a
[16:11] believer this is the formula in our life
[16:13] that you could probably use this as a
[16:15] template to examine every situation in
[16:16] your life. Whether it was it failed at
[16:18] faith, it failed at patience, it's
[16:20] failing in character, and it's failing
[16:21] in hope. You can see that these are kind
[16:23] of the breadcrumbs that lead us to why
[16:24] do I feel the way that I do? And it has
[16:27] something to do with this process.
[16:29] And so it experience if faith dies
[16:33] there's a loss of proven character.
[16:35] Without proven character, there's no
[16:37] expectation of good good things, whether
[16:39] you want to say reward or good things
[16:40] that are coming back to you. So hope
[16:42] deferred maketh the heart sick. When we
[16:44] don't get the things that we want, we
[16:45] get discouraged. A hope begins to fade.
[16:48] A and it's literally saying that there's
[16:50] a sickness and anxiety in the mind and
[16:52] pains emotionally. But the next part
[16:54] says, "But when desire cometh, it is a
[16:57] tree of life." It's speaking to us the
[17:00] way that we're made as human beings, the
[17:02] way that we're wired. That when the
[17:03] thing that you long for, when you
[17:05] receive it, it is a tree of life to you.
[17:07] It's an unspeakable delight. It is a
[17:08] pleasure to you to say that it is a tree
[17:11] of life. You have tree of life that is
[17:13] mentioned in the garden or excuse me, in
[17:15] the book of Genesis. It's mentioned here
[17:17] in Proverbs, and then it's mentioned uh
[17:18] to a greater degree in in the book of
[17:21] Revelation. It's really only mentioned
[17:23] in these different places and in
[17:24] Proverbs it's used of wisdom and it's a
[17:27] tremendous subject. When it says it's a
[17:28] tree of life, it says it is reviving.
[17:31] That when you receive the thing that you
[17:32] hope for, it gives us life. It makes us
[17:34] happy. It invigorates the body. It
[17:36] invigorates the mind. And it is a tree
[17:39] of life as opposed to what? The tree of
[17:41] death.
[17:41] Right?
[17:42] So there's a tree of knowledge and good
[17:43] and evil that produces death. It may
[17:45] promise you life. It may promise you
[17:46] happiness. It may promise you joy, but
[17:48] it doesn't produce it. But when you get
[17:50] the thing that you long for, this is
[17:52] just speaking about human nature. It is
[17:54] to you something that is makes you
[17:56] happy. It's reviving. It's invigorating.
[17:59] Oh, look what I got. And so that's the
[18:02] way humans made that when they want
[18:03] something, they don't get it. They get
[18:04] discouraged. When they want something,
[18:06] they get it. It's supposed to make them
[18:07] happy.
[18:08] It's a tree of life. And if I could put
[18:10] it this way, there's a biblical uh
[18:12] positive feedback loop. There's a
[18:14] scriptural process of sewing and reaping
[18:17] that God wants us to do. And we've
[18:18] looked at it through the scripture and
[18:19] I'll call it this positive feedback loop
[18:21] of patient or faith, patience,
[18:24] experience, hope, happiness. Repeat.
[18:28] You have faith, you have patience, you
[18:30] have experience, you have hope. And it
[18:31] and it's just this is that positive
[18:33] feedback loop because that hope then uh
[18:35] when you receive it, it's a happiness.
[18:37] It feeds back to your faith. Patience,
[18:39] experience, hope, happiness. And it just
[18:41] has this this process that that God
[18:44] desires for us to work within. But the
[18:46] world proposes a negative feedback loop
[18:50] that is patterned off the same thing.
[18:52] But it's not the same thing. It wants to
[18:54] look like it's it's synthetic. It's kind
[18:55] of a fake an impersonation of it. But
[18:58] really what it is is dopamine an
[19:00] experience.
[19:01] Right. Dopamine I'm happy. Dopamine I'm
[19:04] happy. Dopamine I'm happy. Right. This
[19:06] idea that we're in this constant lust
[19:08] for pleasure and we're constantly
[19:10] seeking something that can trigger the
[19:12] right kind of neurons. Fire off this
[19:14] kind of sensation. And if it sounds like
[19:16] I'm talking about extreme experiences or
[19:18] drug addictions or all sorts of euphoric
[19:20] things that you'll never have enough
[19:22] money to enjoy, I'm talking about just
[19:24] daily life.
[19:25] There's things that we do habitually
[19:27] that are a process of us craving
[19:30] something
[19:31] and it's a negative feedback loop.
[19:35] Now to see this in greater detail,
[19:39] let's look at Ecclesiastes chapter 1
[19:40] vers8. I want to use these scriptures.
[19:42] But I am going to use these scriptures
[19:45] to be very detailed about how that we
[19:47] have been made
[19:49] as human beings. So that when I touch on
[19:51] it from a scientific standpoint and I
[19:54] and I know that maybe I we we hated it
[19:57] when we had it in school and you hate to
[19:58] get it at church again, but I hope to
[20:01] make it relevant so you can understand
[20:02] the way that you are as a person and how
[20:04] much you need the Lord
[20:06] and how much we ought to trust in him
[20:07] and hope in him. But let's look at these
[20:09] things in the scripture. Ecclesiastes
[20:11] chapter 1 vers8. All things are full of
[20:14] labor. That means all things are never
[20:15] at rest. There's a constant
[20:16] restlessness. There's a constant change.
[20:19] Man cannot utter it. He's unable to
[20:21] explain to you why all things are full
[20:24] of labor, unrest. This is wonderlust.
[20:27] It's not all things are a job, but all
[20:29] things are constantly changing and
[20:31] restless. Uh there's never just a 1.0,
[20:34] right? There's never just an alpha.
[20:35] There's always a beta. There's always
[20:36] something new. There's something
[20:38] different. Like, well, what was wrong
[20:39] with the other one? nothing,
[20:41] right? Which we we have a desire for new
[20:44] and different. And so it says men cannot
[20:46] explain it. Now notice how it describes
[20:49] the reason why the eye is not satisfied
[20:52] with seeing nor the ear filled with
[20:54] hearing.
[20:56] Say man mankind constantly desire more
[20:59] satisfaction. They they want a longer
[21:01] happiness. They want a greater thrill.
[21:03] They want things uh they want that all
[21:06] things are full of labor. All things are
[21:07] constantly changing. All things are
[21:09] constantly restless. Man cannot explain
[21:11] it that the eye is still looking for
[21:13] satisfaction in these things that never
[21:15] bring it. And the ear is never quite
[21:18] satisfied in listening to the things
[21:19] that he thinks will bring it.
[21:21] Other words, man is always seeking after
[21:23] and longing for happiness in things that
[21:24] are constantly letting them down.
[21:27] But notice this principle about the
[21:28] human being. The eye will never see
[21:30] enough and the ear will never hear
[21:32] enough.
[21:33] And you can put any other s sensation in
[21:35] there. there. It's never enough.
[21:39] How many times have we ever said, "I'm
[21:40] not eating again for the rest of the
[21:41] week."
[21:42] Right? And violated it within the next
[21:44] two hours.
[21:47] And so this is the idea of man that the
[21:50] eye is never quite satisfied. As long as
[21:52] the eye can see, it wants to see more.
[21:53] It never goes, "Oh, that was it." The
[21:55] ear never says, "Oh, that was it." In
[21:57] Proverbs 20:12, the hearing ear and the
[22:00] seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both
[22:03] of them.
[22:05] So now I want to use this to give some
[22:08] greater detail to what Solomon is saying
[22:11] in Ecclesiastes because he's noticing
[22:13] the vanity of the things the eyes see
[22:16] and the ears that the eyes and ears
[22:18] desire and seek after. The eye is
[22:21] looking for something. The ear is
[22:22] longing for something. The man is
[22:23] longing to see something. And Solomon
[22:25] said, "Look at the vanity of it."
[22:27] The vanity how the eye is never
[22:29] satisfied. The ear is never satisfied.
[22:31] He's recognizing it. But now the Bible
[22:33] has told us that God has made both of
[22:35] them. He knows how they work. He knows
[22:38] how they're misled.
[22:40] God knows how your mind works. He knows
[22:42] how your heart works. He knows how your
[22:44] senses are working together with your
[22:46] brain and your and your neurons and your
[22:48] makeup and all these different things.
[22:50] And so the ear is never satisfied with
[22:52] seeing or with hearing. And the eye is
[22:54] not satisfied with seeing. And God has
[22:57] made both the ear and the eye.
[23:00] Ecclesiastes chapter 6:7.
[23:03] Remember Solomon is observing the vanity
[23:05] of these things. All the labor of man is
[23:07] for his mouth. And we could really look
[23:09] at this within the context of chapter 6
[23:11] of this particular man that's described
[23:13] here. He says, "All the labor of man is
[23:15] for his mouth," which means
[23:17] self-gratification
[23:19] for what it can do for him and how it
[23:21] makes him feel and how he feels at the
[23:22] end of the day. And it labor is not just
[23:24] to be confused with your 9 to5 or your
[23:26] job. But the things that man seeks
[23:29] after, the things that he desires is for
[23:31] his own satisi satisfaction, to satisfy
[23:34] his urges and his desires. But it says,
[23:36] "And yet the appetite is not filled."
[23:39] Man does certain things to make him
[23:41] satisfied, to make him content, to make
[23:43] him happy, but it never fully satisfies.
[23:47] It's never if I could just do this,
[23:50] that'll be enough.
[23:51] Right? Because then once you've done
[23:53] that, you're like, "Oh, okay. I want to
[23:56] do another. I want to do this." It's
[23:57] there's there's not a bucket list with
[23:59] three things on it. Because if you once
[24:01] you do all three, like I enjoyed the
[24:02] bucket list, right? I want to add more.
[24:05] I want to do more. I want to experience
[24:06] more. And this is just the labor of man.
[24:09] What he pursues, what he wants, what he
[24:10] desires, it's for his own satisfaction.
[24:14] But yet, that appetite's never quenched.
[24:17] Good.
[24:19] For all the people that have, you know,
[24:21] those of us here who've climbed Mount
[24:22] Everest,
[24:24] when we did it, it was like, you know
[24:26] what? I want to do another one at
[24:28] another time. And I want to do it
[24:29] without oxygen. I want to do it without
[24:30] a sherpa. I want to do it make it
[24:32] harder. Right? Isn't that what we did?
[24:35] It's exactly what we did. And we're
[24:38] going to do a K2 climb in the winter.
[24:45] And that's what that's how the thrill
[24:47] seekers even in their own lives are.
[24:49] That's that constant adrenaline rush
[24:50] that constant this is what the Bible's
[24:52] describing. And now that's an extreme
[24:54] sport angle for us alist. But this
[24:57] applies on a daily life. Proverbs
[25:00] chapter 27 20.
[25:03] Hell and destruction are never full. So
[25:05] the eyes of man are never satisfied.
[25:07] It's describing this drive or this
[25:09] hunger for things that can never produce
[25:11] the satisfaction that you think it's
[25:13] going to give you.
[25:14] Says that the that the the eyes of men
[25:17] are never satisfied. What he wants even
[25:20] when he gets it, it's never the end of
[25:22] it.
[25:23] It's never completely satisfied. It it
[25:25] it never says, "Well, I tasted it and
[25:27] I'm done. I experienced it and I'm done.
[25:29] And I'm glad I got that out of the way.
[25:30] I'll never do it again." No. There's
[25:32] something about the mind that works
[25:34] against you to want it again or to look
[25:37] for more and it's never satisfied. It's
[25:39] an endless cycle of driving a person to
[25:43] continually seek after things that are
[25:45] without hope.
[25:48] There's no substance to it. There's no
[25:50] real weight and that you can take with
[25:52] you and say, "I have this. This endures.
[25:54] This is lasting. This satisfies." In
[25:57] Proverbs 20:17, bread of deceit is sweet
[26:00] to man. It appears uh that it's going to
[26:02] satisfy, but it's emptiness. Causes
[26:04] emptiness because it says, "But
[26:05] afterwards his mouth shall be filled
[26:08] with gravel."
[26:11] The bread of deceit. Now, this is where
[26:13] I hope you can you're listening to this.
[26:15] The bread of deceit is sweet to a man,
[26:18] but notice it's deceitful.
[26:21] This bread is going to be sweet. This
[26:23] bread tastes sweet, but it's a deception
[26:26] because afterwards, your mouth is full
[26:28] of gravel. Right?
[26:29] You're like,
[26:31] "I didn't think it was going to be like
[26:32] this."
[26:33] Right?
[26:34] I was expecting a lot more hair. And now
[26:36] you have a mouthful of rocks.
[26:38] It's
[26:40] uh disconcerting and uncomfortable and
[26:43] and damaging and painful. And so it
[26:46] isn't so much that we like it
[26:49] because it's deceit, but we want it.
[26:53] This is the key today. The bread of
[26:55] deceit is sweet to a man, and afterwards
[26:58] his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
[27:01] And so, a man who's ever tasted the
[27:03] bread of deceit knows that he feels like
[27:05] he's got gravel in his mouth after he
[27:07] ate it. But what does he do? He goes
[27:09] right back to the loaf.
[27:12] He knows it tricked him before and he
[27:15] didn't like the way he felt afterwards.
[27:17] But there's something that drives a man
[27:19] where the eye is never satisfied with
[27:21] seeing, the ear is never filled with
[27:22] hearing. And he goes right back to the
[27:24] bread of deceit. I'm wanting you to
[27:25] think about why this happens because the
[27:27] Bible's saying it does.
[27:31] This is why we'll pursue things that
[27:33] don't really bring joy or happiness.
[27:34] It's why we'll do things and afterwards
[27:36] go, why even do that? I don't ever want
[27:37] to do that again. Find ourselves doing
[27:38] it exactly again. Isaiah 55:2, if I have
[27:43] time, which I don't think I will, maybe
[27:44] we'll come back to it. Why do you spend
[27:47] money for that which is not bread and
[27:50] your labor for that which satisfies not?
[27:52] Some of the translations, I think we've
[27:54] read them here before. Why zealously
[27:56] pursue something that does not truly
[27:57] comfort you or nourish you?
[28:00] Why do you spend energy on that? Why do
[28:01] you spend money for that? Why do you
[28:02] pursue that? Why do you do that when it
[28:04] doesn't comfort you? It doesn't really
[28:05] satisfy. It doesn't really make you
[28:06] happy. It doesn't nurture you. It
[28:08] doesn't nourish you. It doesn't make you
[28:09] better off. Why do you do it? Why is
[28:11] there continual sacrifice, spinning, and
[28:13] giving, but no lasting profit or
[28:15] satisfaction? That's the question. Why
[28:17] is it, and there's an answer, why is it
[28:19] you will do things that you think are
[28:21] going to make you happy, and they don't,
[28:24] and you keep doing it?
[28:26] Why is it that we spend money for bread
[28:28] to eat things that don't satisfy? Why do
[28:30] we labor for things that don't fill us?
[28:33] Why do we not fill our lives with things
[28:34] of substance and that give us hope and
[28:36] strengthen us and encourage us? Why do
[28:38] we invest so much time and energy on
[28:40] something that's malnourishing and
[28:42] harmful? Why do we invest in things that
[28:44] don't give us hope, but actually cause
[28:46] our hearts to fail?
[28:50] These scriptures that I've just read to
[28:52] you here are important to recognize that
[28:56] the Bible has looked into our hearts and
[28:58] tells us, I know the way you are. I know
[29:00] the way that you're wired, and your ear
[29:02] will never hear enough and your eye will
[29:04] never see enough.
[29:05] There's no amount of binging or
[29:07] watching, exploring, uh, enjoying that's
[29:10] ever going to cause your senses to say,
[29:12] "You know what? I've had enough. I'm
[29:14] done. I don't need it anymore."
[29:19] Now, James chapter 1,
[29:23] why is it that we will pursue things
[29:27] that don't satisfy?
[29:30] Why is it we'll run after things that
[29:31] don't give us hope? Now, James picks
[29:34] this up. This scripture has just
[29:36] exploded for me uh in in in much clarity
[29:39] and detail. And so, if I'm catching up
[29:42] to you, encourage me today with your
[29:43] amens because you all may have already
[29:45] totally seen this. And the Lord's like,
[29:47] I got to get brother Aaron on the same
[29:48] page. He calls me brother Aaron
[29:49] apparently so that he could he could fit
[29:52] in with the rest of them.
[29:56] Their son, my son Aaron, I need to help
[29:58] him catch up here. So you give you
[30:00] encourage me if I'm finding that this
[30:02] this angle that you've seen for for
[30:04] years in James chapter 1 14 and 15. This
[30:08] is so familiar to us that it's easy for
[30:10] you to kind of tune out right now. But
[30:11] let's concentrate. Every man is tempted
[30:15] when he's drawn away of his own lust and
[30:18] enticed. So let's carefully consider the
[30:20] practical application of this principle.
[30:22] We know every man is tempted when he's
[30:23] drawn away of his own lust and enticed.
[30:25] So every man is tempted. Now this word
[30:27] tempt there doesn't necessarily it
[30:30] doesn't mean the same as the enticement.
[30:32] This tempted means he's it's translated
[30:34] to proven examined. It means to try or
[30:37] to say to test something. Every man is
[30:40] tested. He's tried. He's going to be
[30:42] proven. So this is a trial of how he'll
[30:44] behave himself is one of the
[30:46] definitions. It's a test of character.
[30:48] Every man's character is tested.
[30:51] Hey, every man is going to be proven.
[30:53] He's going to be tried. You can find out
[30:55] what a man is made of when he's drawn
[30:57] away,
[30:59] which means lured away from safety by
[31:01] his own lust.
[31:04] So, a man's character is going to be
[31:06] tested when he's drawn away from safety.
[31:09] He's drawn away from protection of his
[31:11] own desire, craving, or longing. It's
[31:14] his own desire. It's his own longing.
[31:16] It's his own craving. And so, and it
[31:19] says and enticed, which means beguiled
[31:21] or allured. So it's kind of caught by
[31:22] the bait, deceived by some pretense,
[31:25] deceived, has the idea of a trap,
[31:27] something that tricks you. So a man's
[31:30] character is tested when he is drawn
[31:33] away from safety by his own desire and
[31:37] caught in a trap.
[31:39] And now it continues
[31:42] that when that desire catches, when lust
[31:44] hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin,
[31:46] and sin when it is finished bringeth
[31:48] forth death. Yeah.
[31:50] So when the desire catches so that you
[31:52] have you're you're a person. It says
[31:55] every man is tempted when he's drawn
[31:56] away of his own life. Your character is
[31:58] proven or tried or a sade when you are
[32:01] led away from safety by your own desire.
[32:04] It's it's it's not an something external
[32:06] necessary, but your own desire is then
[32:08] traps you.
[32:10] And then when that desire catches or
[32:11] seizes or controls you, it brings forth
[32:14] the offense. It brings forth the wrong,
[32:15] brings forth sin, which is just a wrong
[32:17] or transgression. And then if you if you
[32:20] follow this cycle, it continu when it
[32:22] continues to completion, right? When it
[32:24] says it bringeth when it is finished, it
[32:26] brings forth death,
[32:28] loss of life,
[32:30] lack of true living,
[32:32] it does not result in the tree of life.
[32:35] Does not result in real living. Does not
[32:38] result in satisfaction. When a man is
[32:40] character is proven and attested
[32:43] whenever he's drawn away from safety and
[32:45] the things that really satisfy by his
[32:47] own longing, his own desire and gets
[32:49] trapped by his desire. And then when he
[32:51] acts on it, that's the offense. And if
[32:54] you stay in that cycle because it says
[32:55] when sin is finished, it's this process.
[32:58] It doesn't bring forth joy. It doesn't
[33:00] bring forth hope. It actually brings
[33:02] forth death. The opposite of the real
[33:04] living. And it it's described as it's
[33:07] just described as death. And I want you
[33:08] to think in a way that there's a manner
[33:10] of living that is actually dying.
[33:13] There's a way that we can live that is
[33:15] not truly living. As brother Bam talks
[33:17] about in thirsting for life, oh woo,
[33:19] this is life. He says, "No, that's
[33:21] death."
[33:22] There's a way that we think, "Oh, this
[33:23] is life. This is the good life. This is
[33:25] awesome. This is wonderful. Isn't this
[33:27] great?" And we've tricked ourselves into
[33:29] thinking that we're experiencing life
[33:31] when in reality it's death.
[33:33] Amen.
[33:34] Amen. The Bible says in 1 Timothy 5:6,
[33:42] so there's a drawing away. Every man is
[33:44] proven, his character is proven, it's
[33:46] tested when he allows his own desires
[33:51] to be to control him. When they become
[33:53] caught and seizes control, it entices
[33:55] him. 1 Timothy 5:6, this is applies not
[34:00] just to the she, but she that liveth in
[34:01] pleasure is dead while she liveth.
[34:05] The person who's always yielding to
[34:07] their desire
[34:09] as as James writes it that he's drawn
[34:11] away of his own lust, his own pleasure,
[34:13] his own seeking for want, his own
[34:14] desire. Anyone that's always yielding to
[34:16] pleasure is not truly living but is in
[34:18] bondage to an unfulfilling cycle.
[34:22] You're dead while you live.
[34:23] This isn't real living. He she that
[34:25] liveth in pleasure is always driving
[34:27] after pleasure, always looking to be
[34:29] satisfied, always looking um for a
[34:31] thrill, always looking for something
[34:32] that can uh give this spark of
[34:34] excitement. That's death.
[34:37] That's not real living.
[34:40] Now, I know that it's been it may seem
[34:44] it may seem long already today, and
[34:47] since it's getting drawn out, I might be
[34:48] making your heart sick. I don't know.
[34:51] But uh I'm kind of right at a middle
[34:53] part here. So this is with your help we
[34:55] can finish this up at a decent time. But
[34:58] this is this is an important very
[35:00] important principle that I'm building
[35:01] off of. Everything I've been saying to
[35:03] this point is kind of revolving around
[35:04] the way the Lord dealt with me on this.
[35:07] Do not confuse pleasure
[35:10] where it talks about uh your own drawn
[35:12] away of your own lust which is your
[35:13] desire. Here it says he she that liveth
[35:15] in pleasure. Do not confuse want or
[35:17] desire pleasure with love or happiness.
[35:20] Amen.
[35:22] Let's pay very I want to pay very
[35:24] careful attention to the application of
[35:26] this biblical truth that we're made a
[35:28] certain way that well what I long for if
[35:30] I don't see it I get discouraged and
[35:31] makes my heart sick. But when I get what
[35:33] I long for is kind of makes me feel like
[35:35] I'm living makes me feel alive. But then
[35:37] there's this this framework that the
[35:40] devil can use to try to get us in this
[35:42] oh that's what you wanted. That's what
[35:43] you wanted. That's what you wanted. We
[35:44] think oh this is exciting. This is good.
[35:46] This is good. And then the Bible says
[35:48] but you know what? There's a part of you
[35:50] that the eye is always going to want and
[35:52] the ear is always going to want. And
[35:54] then what it wants and what it seeks
[35:56] after is not even the things that
[35:57] satisfy.
[35:59] So there's a way that we're driven to
[36:01] pursue things. There's a way that we're
[36:02] caused to look after things and enjoy
[36:04] things and participate in things that is
[36:06] actually we're not really living. We're
[36:08] in bondage to a cycle.
[36:10] We're in bondage to wanting things and
[36:12] we're why does this not ever satisfy?
[36:14] And maybe some of you can relate. I'm
[36:15] going to use an old example so that we
[36:17] don't ever we don't get uncomfortable,
[36:19] but we we we remember when we first got
[36:22] maybe it was your first laptop or your
[36:24] first cell phone, a first MP3 player and
[36:26] just how wow all that was, right? And
[36:30] maybe for our digital natives here, you
[36:32] you just have to humor us for a little
[36:33] bit. Uh cuz they're born with one in
[36:35] their hand and they can't necessarily
[36:36] appreciate it. Uh and we when we
[36:39] experience this and it's like that's
[36:40] amazing. So then you have your your
[36:42] phone for a while and then you want to
[36:44] get a new one and maybe the next time
[36:45] you get it there's different features
[36:47] and you're like, "Wow." But then after a
[36:48] while you keep looking for the wow when
[36:51] you open the box, right? None of you got
[36:53] it with your iPhone 13. I promise you,
[36:56] right? you you had the you had the
[36:59] iPhone mini, you had the 4S or whatever,
[37:01] and you get the Uber Pro Max uh Tundra
[37:05] Platinum Expedition Edition, and and you
[37:08] open it up like, yeah, it's just bigger
[37:10] than the other one.
[37:12] And you're looking for this. Woo, that's
[37:15] awesome.
[37:16] And we're always looking for something
[37:17] to wow us and and and we and looking for
[37:20] enjoyment. The Bible's talking about
[37:22] this process that takes place in our
[37:23] lives that we're in bondage to on a
[37:25] daily basis whether we realize it or
[37:27] not. And so what I want to divide right
[37:29] now is that part of you that wants
[37:32] something and desires something but the
[37:35] part of you that rather really likes
[37:37] something and is happy by it.
[37:40] Because this and and this is we're
[37:42] looking at the practical application of
[37:43] these biblical truths because the
[37:45] dopamine I've been talking about in your
[37:47] brains and this pleasure center of our
[37:49] brain as it's used to refer to pleasure.
[37:51] It doesn't determine happiness.
[37:53] Right?
[37:55] It doesn't even determine enjoyment.
[37:56] Right?
[37:57] The dopamine effect in your brain, this
[37:59] pleasure center of your brain does not
[38:01] mediate what you like.
[38:05] The dopamine drives desire.
[38:09] In other words, it determines what you
[38:11] want and doesn't indicate what you like.
[38:16] This is what the Bible's telling us.
[38:18] Because why else do you eat bread of
[38:20] deceit knowing it's going to make you
[38:21] feel like you have gravel? You don't
[38:22] like gravel in your mouth,
[38:24] but you still eat the bread.
[38:25] Why? Because there's something that your
[38:27] mind is doing to you and makes you want
[38:30] it even if you don't like it.
[38:33] I know that might sound like the
[38:34] beginning of an Old Spice commercial,
[38:35] but it's not.
[38:37] It's the truth.
[38:38] You want it and you want it but you
[38:40] don't like it. And so our dopamine
[38:43] system, that part of our pleasure sent
[38:44] in our brain, it fuels our wants. It
[38:46] fuels our lust. It fuels our desires.
[38:48] Even against our liking of something,
[38:51] even against whether or not that thing
[38:53] makes us happy, even against whether or
[38:55] not we feel that we enjoy it. So it's
[38:56] not indicative of love. It's not
[38:58] indicative of like. It's not indicative
[39:00] of happiness. It's not indicative of
[39:01] true pleasure or satisfaction.
[39:04] And so when it comes to this is where
[39:07] it's definitely relevant when it comes
[39:09] to addiction and this has been studied
[39:12] to great detail and and the way that
[39:14] they are able to determine this is just
[39:16] to me it's complete that when it comes
[39:18] to addictions
[39:20] the wanting of something becomes
[39:22] detached from liking it.
[39:25] The the addict it will even admit it's
[39:28] not something they like. It's not
[39:30] something they enjoy. They don't even
[39:31] like the consequences of it. but they
[39:33] can't stop wanting it.
[39:35] And so this is on a maybe on a really
[39:38] destructive level when it comes to
[39:39] certain kind of addictions. But our
[39:41] pleasure center, that dopamine system,
[39:42] as we've been referring to it, learns
[39:44] that certain cu cues indicate a reward.
[39:48] Oh, when I see that, it tells me that
[39:50] something's about to happen. When when I
[39:53] see that, it cues there's going to be a
[39:54] dopamine rush. When I say cue, there's
[39:56] this cue of, oh, there's something that
[39:58] comes from that that makes me feel good,
[40:00] that gives me a certain sensation. And
[40:02] this is how uh certain behaviors are
[40:04] triggered. This is how certain
[40:05] addictions uh can be uh relapsed because
[40:08] all it takes is just the sight of one
[40:10] thing, the experience of one thing, the
[40:11] notification of something and it causes
[40:13] even against your uh your liking of it
[40:16] causes you to want it.
[40:19] Think of think of yourself. I'm not uh
[40:21] if the Lord is wanting to uncover some
[40:23] sort of nefarious addiction, God grant
[40:25] it. I hope you get you the deliverance
[40:26] you need. But it happens in a more
[40:28] innocent level on a daily basis for all
[40:30] of us.
[40:31] rewards can uh the cues the little signs
[40:34] of them can trigger these this burst of
[40:37] reward seeking motivation like a an
[40:39] emotional magnet is what they call it
[40:41] where it's not that you even like it but
[40:43] you're drawn to it to satisfy it
[40:46] and that's how the addictions get
[40:48] started
[40:50] because eventually our minds just get
[40:51] sensitized to that urge or wanting and
[40:54] once it becomes conditioned or
[40:55] sensitized to it it's never satisfied
[40:59] it can't be satisfied
[41:01] The Bible says it can't be, but it's
[41:03] sensitized for it. The ear wants to
[41:05] hear. The eye wants to see.
[41:07] The brain wants to enjoy, wants to
[41:09] experience it.
[41:12] And they
[41:14] drug addicts will
[41:16] want to use drugs even if they don't
[41:19] like them.
[41:21] Someone who's addicted to something will
[41:22] actually uh uh engage in it even if they
[41:25] admit it gives them little or no
[41:26] pleasure, but they still want it.
[41:31] But John, if you don't mind queuing up
[41:33] that cute little rat with an odd little
[41:34] hat up there.
[41:37] I want I'm gonna try to just run through
[41:39] this very very quickly and we'll just
[41:40] use this slide for just a few moments.
[41:43] Uh thankfully they don't do this to
[41:45] humans, but maybe unfortunately they do
[41:46] it to rats and they put them in these
[41:48] Skinner boxes and they come up with all
[41:50] sorts of experiments and tricks to try
[41:52] to determine how how these mice and
[41:55] these rats are motivated.
[41:57] Uh they proposed years ago um to replace
[42:00] rats in studies with lawyers.
[42:04] Uh because there's so many of them.
[42:08] Uh not everybody, you know, nobody likes
[42:10] lawyers and there's just some things
[42:13] that rats won't do.
[42:17] But they use these studies to try to
[42:18] determine uh I identify you the way
[42:21] human behavior works. And so the in
[42:24] these Skinner boxes, there's one where
[42:25] they just put them in there and there
[42:27] was a lever that they would bump into.
[42:28] Whenever they touch the lever, food
[42:30] would come out. And what happens is the
[42:32] rat begin to realize if I touch this, I
[42:34] get food, right? So they condition them
[42:37] and there's this process of condition to
[42:38] perform a certain behavior through
[42:40] reinforcement.
[42:41] And then they would use different ways
[42:43] uh uh uh like if we do something and
[42:45] that conditions them and they're going
[42:46] to do it through reinforcement, keep
[42:47] doing something over and over again. But
[42:50] then what they did is they put in a
[42:52] lever that whenever they touched it and
[42:54] they attached this, you know, this
[42:56] zapper, right, to the part of their
[42:58] brain that would induce dopamine.
[43:01] And so there would, it would activate
[43:03] the pleasure center, this sense of, ooh,
[43:05] I like that, that good feeling. And they
[43:07] put this lever in the Skinner box. And
[43:10] whereas before if they touched a lever
[43:11] they would get food. Now if they touched
[43:13] a certain part of the cage or they went
[43:14] into a particular corner and and they
[43:16] got that they got that shock in their
[43:18] brains um then they would get this
[43:20] feeling of excitement kind of like what
[43:22] you get when you get your dopamine
[43:23] release. And what would h what happened
[43:26] is the rats would repeatedly press the
[43:28] lever to activate their pleasure center
[43:31] because they're like
[43:33] yeah yeah yeah
[43:38] right. I mean, it would just be like
[43:40] over and over. Yes. Constantly doing it
[43:43] because it would trigger the pleasure
[43:44] center. And this is what the rats did.
[43:47] They did it to the point to where they
[43:48] stopped eating. They stopped sleeping.
[43:50] They stopped drinking. To the point to
[43:51] where they eventually died from
[43:53] exhaustion.
[43:55] I don't know where they're at on the
[43:56] lawyer study yet with in the Skinner
[43:58] boxes.
[44:00] But they would do it over and over and
[44:02] over again. This is the catch. Not
[44:04] because they liked it,
[44:06] but because they wanted it.
[44:09] And because they wanted it, this empty
[44:10] pleasure took over. They got nothing out
[44:12] of the lever.
[44:13] Just a sensation,
[44:14] right? They got nothing out of the
[44:16] scroll. They got nothing out of the
[44:17] click. They got nothing out of the
[44:18] experience. Just the sensation. And they
[44:20] did it at the risk of their own health.
[44:22] They didn't eat. They didn't sleep. They
[44:24] actually did it to where they died from
[44:25] exhaustion, not because they like it,
[44:27] because the want took over.
[44:29] Wow.
[44:30] And say, "Well, how do they figure?"
[44:31] They did ways where they controlled it.
[44:32] They could determine whether or not
[44:34] there certain situations where they gave
[44:36] them um salty water and they gave them
[44:37] sweet water to determine whether or not
[44:39] it was a condition of them liking it
[44:42] because they could completely take the
[44:43] dopamine system and kill it.
[44:46] And show that it had nothing to do with
[44:48] like. It has everything to do with the
[44:49] want.
[44:53] In a later study,
[44:55] they took a a metal stick and put it in
[44:58] a cage
[45:00] and and if they touched it, it would
[45:01] shock them.
[45:03] And they said typically the rats would
[45:05] learn their lesson after a few times and
[45:06] stay away.
[45:08] Now, let's make this applicable.
[45:11] Let's think about ourselves. That
[45:12] there's this rod in this cage and that
[45:14] whenever they bumped up against it, it
[45:15] shocked them, caused it physical pain,
[45:18] and after a while, they knew, don't go
[45:20] near the the stick,
[45:22] right? just stay away from that. When
[45:23] you do, you get bit. It's not a good
[45:25] thing. But then what they did is they
[45:27] did this right here. They put a a a
[45:31] electrical current into the dopamine
[45:33] center of their brain. And what they did
[45:35] is every time they would touch that
[45:38] stick, they would activate their
[45:39] dopamine system.
[45:41] So now, even though it caused them pain
[45:44] and even though it hurt, they got the
[45:46] sensation. They got this sensation of
[45:48] dopamine and they would actually become
[45:51] obsessed with the stick,
[45:53] right?
[45:54] They'd become engrossed with it and they
[45:56] would go over there and it would they
[45:58] would get the dopamine and it would zap
[46:00] them and they'd go away and they like
[46:02] go over there and they and they'd go
[46:04] away and after what maybe 10 minutes
[46:06] they'd stay away. Then it would be five
[46:07] and they'd get to the point where they
[46:08] would approach it, sniffle it. They said
[46:10] it would nuzzle it, touch it with its
[46:12] paw or nose, it would become enamored
[46:14] with it.
[46:17] because the it doesn't have to like it.
[46:20] It just wants it.
[46:22] You can take the picture down.
[46:25] If we're using this as an example of how
[46:27] our brains work in our dopamine system,
[46:30] even without the expectation of good,
[46:33] even without the satisfaction or the
[46:35] happiness, it couldn't help itself.
[46:38] It was no longer under in control. It
[46:40] was under the forces of that I want that
[46:42] release in my brain. I need this certain
[46:45] release. I I need I need to do this when
[46:48] I get up in the morning. I've got to go
[46:49] and make this this hot beverage of this
[46:52] dark substance that I don't even like
[46:54] the taste of, but I need to do it. Come
[46:58] on, somebody. You know it's true,
[47:01] right? You feel that you need to do it.
[47:04] And in that way, we're not very much
[47:06] unlike the rats,
[47:08] right? Because we just nuzzle it and we
[47:10] paw it and we touch it, right? And we're
[47:13] over there just kind of holding it.
[47:15] Honey, get a picture. Right. You know,
[47:17] like, you know, you don't really like
[47:19] it, but you want it.
[47:27] I think you should make practical
[47:28] application.
[47:32] Are we returning to things that we know
[47:34] don't really satisfy?
[47:36] 2 Corinthians chapter 2:1, "Lest Satan
[47:38] should get an advantage of us, for we're
[47:40] not ignorant of his devices." is that
[47:41] advantage means to defraud us or swindle
[47:43] us. I'm just going to go quickly now. We
[47:46] are not ignorant of his devices. That's
[47:47] his scheme. That's his trick. It's the
[47:49] way that he wants to. He's designed
[47:50] something a particular way to trick us.
[47:52] I believe that we're living in the
[47:54] climax of Satan's Eden and we're having
[47:56] to navigate through so many things. I
[47:57] was going to use the scripture of using
[47:59] the world but not abusing it. Uh use the
[48:01] scripture on the principle Paul saying,
[48:03] "I die daily." That there's things that
[48:04] daily we have to be recognizing. And to
[48:07] think that there's a way that Satan
[48:09] wants to trick us and defraud us and get
[48:11] advantage of us, but we can keep him
[48:13] from doing that by being aware of his
[48:15] tricks.
[48:16] Yeah.
[48:16] By being aware of the downside, we can
[48:18] use the world, but we don't want to let
[48:20] it abuse us.
[48:21] We we need to die daily to certain
[48:23] things. And we need to be aware that
[48:25] certain activities can stimulate the pre
[48:27] pleasure center and become habitual to
[48:29] us, become addictive, and there's things
[48:31] that we do without even thinking, and
[48:32] we're doing it over and over again. And
[48:34] it's the product of not what you like,
[48:37] but a product of what your mind wants.
[48:39] And I believe the world is getting us to
[48:41] a place where it's constantly trying to
[48:42] stimulate our pleasure center.
[48:44] Constantly trying to to give us this
[48:46] thrill. Constantly trying to in it's
[48:47] designed to entice us.
[48:50] It's designed to get us the to act not
[48:52] because we like something or because we
[48:54] love something or because we think it's
[48:56] going to make us happy, but because of
[48:57] the way that we're made. We're drawn
[49:00] away from safety. We're drawn away at by
[49:02] our own desires and our wants and our
[49:04] likes and our wants and our lust, not
[49:06] our love.
[49:08] We're not drawn We're not drawn by what
[49:10] we know will truly satisfy and give us
[49:12] hope.
[49:14] Now, if the in this next slide, I think
[49:18] I hopefully you can see this and it'll
[49:19] work.
[49:21] It the the headline says never offline.
[49:25] Says the Apple Watch is just the start.
[49:27] how wearable tech will change your life,
[49:30] like it or not.
[49:32] And and and it it's and this is kind of
[49:35] conveys this idea. This was the cover of
[49:36] Time magazine and and the the article
[49:40] was how Apple is invading our bodies.
[49:45] Kind of a type of the original sin
[49:46] there.
[49:48] How Apple is invading our bodies. Now,
[49:52] you want to anybody want to guess the
[49:53] year that this article was published in?
[49:56] Good guess. It's 2014.
[50:00] We're we're 8 and a half years beyond
[50:02] this.
[50:03] September 10th, 2014.
[50:05] And we're so much further.
[50:08] I mean, if we think in terms of Moore's
[50:10] law, God rest his soul. He just passed
[50:12] away this past week. In terms of how
[50:15] this technology is increasing in
[50:16] capacity and everything that's evolving
[50:18] and where it's getting to, we're a
[50:19] million miles from even what they
[50:20] thought it would be maybe in 2014.
[50:24] And this is a statement that they made
[50:25] in this article. The reality of living
[50:27] with an iPhone or any smart connected
[50:29] device is that it makes reality feel
[50:32] just that little bit less real.
[50:38] The the problem with the cell phone and
[50:39] a smartwatch and all these uh connected
[50:42] devices and these smart devices and now
[50:44] we have to have internet for our
[50:45] refrigerators and our toasters are
[50:46] talking back to us and everything's
[50:48] connected and everything is
[50:50] communicating. It says it makes reality
[50:52] feel less real. In other words, the
[50:55] things that are real feel less real. If
[50:57] you want an example of this, now
[50:58] synthetic leather is better than real
[51:00] leather.
[51:02] They can make fake leather better than
[51:04] the cows can make the real leather.
[51:07] That's where we've gotten to in Satan's
[51:08] Eden. Like, wow, is this fake? Yeah. Oh,
[51:11] I like that. Oh, that's the real
[51:15] Yeah.
[51:17] Yeah. I like this other stuff over here.
[51:21] It's the way that things have become.
[51:22] makes it feel less real. One gets
[51:25] overconnected to the point where the
[51:27] thoughts and opinions of distant
[51:28] anonymous strangers start to feel more
[51:31] urgent than those of your loved ones who
[51:32] are in the same room as you.
[51:36] One forgets how to be alone and
[51:37] undistracted.
[51:39] And that's the part to me that stands
[51:41] out. We don't know what it's like to
[51:42] just sit anymore,
[51:44] to just be alone with our thoughts. To
[51:46] be to be undistracted, we have to have
[51:48] something next to us. Is I know we've
[51:50] all had this thought over the last
[51:51] couple years. What in the world did we
[51:52] do at a doctor's office? Right? And now
[51:55] you're saying, "Who in the world goes to
[51:56] a doctor's office anymore?"
[51:59] Right? It's all telealth now.
[52:02] And just wait till they start setting up
[52:03] the 3D printers in your living room to
[52:04] do your surgeries. The doctor's just
[52:07] over there in his pajamas, right? He
[52:09] sleeps in his scrubs. He's like, "The
[52:11] surge will be over in a minute. Just
[52:12] keep still doing it remotely." Or maybe
[52:16] it'll be surgeon GPT
[52:20] be. But this is where we're going to.
[52:23] And if you think about the devices we
[52:25] use and the way that we're interacting
[52:26] with them, we're like in our own little
[52:27] Skinner boxes.
[52:28] We've got our levers. We got the things
[52:30] that we return to, the things that we
[52:32] are conditioned to expect a reward from.
[52:35] And as if there's anything these
[52:36] scriptures teach us is that the flesh
[52:38] tends to addiction.
[52:40] That there's a there's a repetitive
[52:43] behavior that we engage in, but it can
[52:46] never be full. It can never satisfy.
[53:02] Just have a few more scriptures I want
[53:03] to share with you, but we're closing.
[53:05] We're closing with just a a run of
[53:07] thoughts here.
[53:11] Anybody ever heard of the unit bias?
[53:14] It's fascinating. could talk about it at
[53:15] lunch if you want to.
[53:18] But there's this bias in our hearts that
[53:21] believes that the amount we're given is
[53:23] the right amount.
[53:25] Right? So therefore, we want to we
[53:28] that's why we we and we've been told
[53:29] since we're kids, finish the food that's
[53:30] on your plate. Nowadays, when we go to a
[53:31] restaurant, we just assume that that
[53:33] chicken fried steak is the right amount.
[53:36] So we feel compelled to finish it. You
[53:38] get you have a drink, you buy a 32 ounce
[53:41] drink, you feel compelled to finish it
[53:43] because you have this compulsion and
[53:44] this belief that the amount you're given
[53:46] is the right amount. So, we try to
[53:47] finish it.
[53:49] This is they they've come up with ways
[53:50] to figure this out. How does a person
[53:52] determine what's enough?
[53:54] Okay. And this is relevant in that the
[53:57] eye is never satisfied with seeing nor
[53:58] the ear hearing. And and if all there
[54:01] all there was in the world was one book,
[54:04] right?
[54:05] Right. after you read it, you'd be like,
[54:07] "Well, there's no there's nothing else
[54:08] to read,
[54:09] feel pretty good until, you know, they
[54:11] bang out another one, right?"
[54:13] But now there it's endless. The things
[54:16] you can read, the things that you hear,
[54:17] the things that you can see. And just as
[54:19] an example of the unit bias, they put
[54:21] out a bowl of candy and and they put out
[54:23] a little spoon in the bowl and they
[54:25] said, "Uh, you can have as much as you
[54:28] can get in a scoop."
[54:30] And so people took a scoop and they took
[54:32] it and they had it and they and they
[54:33] were happy with their little teaspoon.
[54:35] But what they kept doing is they kept
[54:36] increasing
[54:38] the size of the scoop.
[54:40] And people always adjusted their
[54:43] consumption based on the size of the
[54:45] scoop.
[54:47] In other words, they might have had just
[54:48] a tablespoon. Might have been very, very
[54:49] sweet candy. They used M&M's and
[54:51] different things and you get a little
[54:51] handful and you eat it and the person
[54:54] seemed to be satisfied. But you could
[54:55] keep increasing it. And the people never
[54:58] stopped the amount of candy they ate
[55:00] because the scoop told them that's the
[55:03] right amount.
[55:04] So they had like this unit bias that
[55:06] whatever's given to me is what is the
[55:09] amount that I want to consume.
[55:11] Whatever's available is the amount that
[55:13] I cons can consume. Welcome the infinite
[55:16] scroll.
[55:18] Right? Welcome our devices and platforms
[55:21] and technology today that doesn't have
[55:23] an end. And the only point you stop is
[55:25] when you finally get to where you were
[55:27] before
[55:29] and you tell yourself, "I'm done
[55:32] because you have there's this you have
[55:34] this appetite. You have this drive. You
[55:36] have this hunger and this and the you
[55:38] can get on whether it be uh whatever
[55:40] platform, Instagram. I was I was
[55:43] watching it in particular as I traveled
[55:44] the last few days on how people sat
[55:46] there. I don't know if it's Instagram or
[55:48] YouTube or uh Tik Tok probably is what
[55:51] it was. And they're all all, you know,
[55:53] biting off one another. They're all
[55:54] impersonating vine and uh it just one
[55:58] after another after another. There's no
[56:00] end to it.
[56:02] They were never satisfied either,
[56:04] right?
[56:05] They threaten to hijack the plane if the
[56:07] Wi-Fi goes down.
[56:09] I'm not done. I haven't reached the
[56:10] bottom yet. There is no bottom.
[56:14] There is no end. Right.
[56:16] That's why they want you on their
[56:17] platforms. That's why they want you on
[56:18] the app is because they'll always be
[56:21] next.
[56:23] That's right.
[56:23] And if you don't think it's right, test
[56:25] it the next time. What you read before
[56:27] you go to bed and what you'll read when
[56:28] you get up the next morning is up to
[56:31] where you were when you went to bed.
[56:34] This is practical. This is just
[56:35] practical stuff.
[56:40] We will adjust our consumption based
[56:41] upon what's available. And now that
[56:44] everything's available, we don't adjust
[56:45] our consumption.
[56:47] The Bible says in Jeremiah 17:9, "The
[56:49] heart is deceitful above all things and
[56:50] desperately wicked. Who can know it?"
[56:54] The heart wants it. Right? The heart
[56:58] wants it, but it doesn't even like it.
[57:01] The mind wants it, but it doesn't bring
[57:04] happiness. The heart is deceitful above
[57:06] all things. It wants things that hurt
[57:09] you. It wants things that aren't
[57:10] profitable. It wants things that don't
[57:11] satisfy. Brother Brandham in the sermon,
[57:14] the greatest battle ever fought says,
[57:15] speaking of the devil, he tries to show
[57:16] you something better, an easier way, a
[57:19] more sensible plan.
[57:21] That's what's being presented today
[57:23] through this ease through Leodysia, the
[57:25] conspicuous consumption, the the the
[57:28] being rich and increased with goods and
[57:30] saying, "I have need of nothing." There
[57:32] it is. It's it's still this insatiable
[57:34] desire and this this lust and this want.
[57:37] But he says, "There's no more sensible
[57:38] plan than that God laid down at the
[57:40] beginning, his word." word. He says,
[57:42] "Hold that word." I know this might seem
[57:44] maybe theological or it might seem uh
[57:46] maybe abstract to you, but get a grip on
[57:48] it. Let it get a grip on you. Stay there
[57:50] with it.
[57:52] It's our only hope.
[57:54] It's our only hope. We're all just being
[57:56] dumbed down. It says how how technology
[57:58] is invading our bodies. How they're
[58:00] wanting to put devices on us that
[58:02] monitor everything. And then we
[58:03] rationalize, well, I know how many steps
[58:05] I took,
[58:06] right? And and if they if they had this
[58:08] when they were doing the Oregon Trail,
[58:10] they would have known the Donner party
[58:12] would have survived. Like we get in our
[58:13] minds that this is the only way we can
[58:15] keep up is if I know how many steps we
[58:17] need to have water bottles that remind
[58:19] us to drink it.
[58:23] You need your water. And what we're
[58:25] doing is we're relying on all these
[58:27] things to give us the cues. We're
[58:28] relying on all these things that you
[58:30] know what happens to my water bottle
[58:31] when I drink it enough? It unlocks a new
[58:33] light strobe.
[58:35] or the reason why I do this is because
[58:36] if I do this I unlock another level and
[58:38] I get a new skin and you're constantly
[58:41] looking for ways and you're connected
[58:42] and fit into that and you're driven by
[58:45] all these other things and it's it's
[58:46] it's it's a it's a it's a Skinner box.
[58:49] It's a rat lab. It's the rat race that
[58:51] brother Benham talked about and we're
[58:52] all fully investing in it and we're
[58:54] getting integrated into it and we're
[58:56] living by. You may not think so, but I'm
[58:58] being very very sincere today. There's
[59:01] some who are maybe not prone to certain
[59:03] addictions that get the headlines. But
[59:05] many of us have addictive personalities
[59:07] that are in the soft things, in the
[59:08] innocent things, and we're driven by
[59:10] nature to immerse ourselves in things.
[59:12] And we're driven by nature to experience
[59:14] rewards and benefits through certain
[59:16] things. And we've got to take a step
[59:17] back and realize we're now slaves to
[59:20] that.
[59:22] We're caught up in it when what we need
[59:24] to do is lay a hold of the word. The
[59:26] devil's offered a sensible plan, an
[59:27] easier plan, and we've just locked into
[59:29] it. But we got to somehow get away from
[59:31] it.
[59:32] And this is a scripture I just I I think
[59:34] this might be the last one I have in the
[59:35] slide. I Matthewap 11 28.
[59:38] Come unto me
[59:41] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[59:44] and I will give you rest.
[59:47] Come unto me
[59:48] all ye that are labor as as the writer
[59:51] said. Oh, everything's full of labor.
[59:53] And and we labor for things that don't
[59:54] satisfy. We labor for things that don't
[59:56] fulfill us. and we're seeing and we're
[59:58] hearing and we're driving and we're
[59:59] pursuing and it never satisfies. And he
[1:00:01] says, "All you that are seeking that,
[1:00:02] all you that are caught in the Skinner
[1:00:04] box, all of you who are caught in this
[1:00:05] this dopamine cycle and you're wanting
[1:00:08] things and desiring things that you
[1:00:09] don't even like," he says, "Come unto me
[1:00:11] and I'll give you the rest your soul
[1:00:13] wants."
[1:00:14] I'll give you the rest that you really
[1:00:15] desire. And I and I was thinking about
[1:00:17] this last week and I I wanted to start
[1:00:19] writing it down and I just realized I
[1:00:21] there was just maybe a few key phrases
[1:00:23] that kept coming to my mind, but I was
[1:00:25] thinking about all the songs that we
[1:00:26] sing
[1:00:28] a and and the words to these songs that
[1:00:30] we we sing and how that can we really
[1:00:32] say when we say you're all I want.
[1:00:36] Is that true?
[1:00:40] You're all I want oat milk extra hot no
[1:00:43] cream.
[1:00:44] Right.
[1:00:45] like the what else? What else? What else
[1:00:47] do we need him to add to it?
[1:00:50] You're all you're all I ever need. And
[1:00:52] we talk about his wonders and we sing
[1:00:53] about his grace and nothing compares to
[1:00:56] you and how wonderful he is. And we have
[1:00:58] these things and these sayings, but
[1:01:00] we're less enamored with him.
[1:01:03] We're we're less engaged with him. We're
[1:01:06] over there in the corner tapping the
[1:01:08] lever. We love you, Jesus.
[1:01:11] We love you so much, God. You're so
[1:01:13] wonderful. The cross is so amazing,
[1:01:18] right?
[1:01:20] Is it even true anymore?
[1:01:23] I I I guess I'd like to make the
[1:01:24] challenge,
[1:01:26] but I would be afraid of the silence.
[1:01:28] Don't sing it if it's not true.
[1:01:32] Is it really true?
[1:01:34] Do you do you really love them?
[1:01:36] And and I believe what we're introducing
[1:01:38] today at least bringing it back to your
[1:01:40] memory or to like bringing it up in your
[1:01:42] hearts to recognize that we could
[1:01:44] acknowledge there's things that this
[1:01:46] mind wants that my heart knows I don't
[1:01:49] like.
[1:01:50] There's things in my mind and my body's
[1:01:53] drawn to that I feel that I want. I have
[1:01:55] some sort of compulsion. It gives me
[1:01:58] some sort of feeling uh uh that I some
[1:02:00] sort of itch that I'm trying to scratch.
[1:02:02] But I know that I I don't even It's not
[1:02:04] that I like it. It's not that I love it.
[1:02:05] But it's not that it really brings me
[1:02:06] joy. This isn't my life. This isn't my
[1:02:08] peace. It's not my all in all. It's not
[1:02:10] all I want. It's not all I ever needed.
[1:02:13] It's not my rest. It's not my hope. And
[1:02:15] you realize that deep down inside, he is
[1:02:17] my hope. He is what I want. He is whom I
[1:02:21] love. Can you not think about how how
[1:02:23] you felt when he saved you from your
[1:02:25] sins? Can can you not think about how
[1:02:27] you felt when the message began to dawn
[1:02:29] on you? Can you not think of how you
[1:02:31] felt when he delivered you? Can you not
[1:02:33] think about the moments when he became
[1:02:35] real and his presence is strong and you
[1:02:38] realize how much the rat cage and the
[1:02:40] skinner boxes in the infinite scroll is
[1:02:43] trying to draw you away from those real
[1:02:46] moments.
[1:02:48] He says come unto me all you that labor
[1:02:50] and are heavy laden and I will give you
[1:02:52] rest. Do we stand in awe in the presence
[1:02:55] of the Lord? Amen.
[1:03:00] How can he become what we really sing
[1:03:02] about him?
[1:03:05] And I'm saying it with as much grace as
[1:03:07] I can. I believe there's things that
[1:03:08] have captured our attention that aren't
[1:03:09] what we really want.
[1:03:11] They're not what we really love. They're
[1:03:13] not what we really enjoy, but they
[1:03:14] become our addictions
[1:03:16] in contradiction to what gives us real
[1:03:17] satisfaction. They become our addictions
[1:03:20] and our habits and our manner of life in
[1:03:23] contradiction to what we know deep down
[1:03:25] inside is our hope
[1:03:26] and what gives us our satisfaction.
[1:03:28] But the heart is desperately wicked,
[1:03:32] deceitful above all things. The deceived
[1:03:35] heart wonders after things that do not
[1:03:36] satisfy to the neglect of true
[1:03:38] happiness.
[1:03:40] He says, "Come unto me all you that
[1:03:42] labor and are heavy laden and I will
[1:03:43] give you rest." He says, "If any man
[1:03:46] thirst, let him come unto me and drink."
[1:03:49] In other words, come back to the tree of
[1:03:50] life.
[1:03:52] Reawaken our hope
[1:03:54] because these things that you pursue
[1:03:56] when it comes to Christ are never in
[1:03:58] vain.
[1:03:59] There's no vanity in it.
[1:04:01] There's no emptiness in it. The world
[1:04:03] can only offer you vain pursuits. The
[1:04:05] world can only offer you uh uh trophies
[1:04:07] that you that that are destroyed, that
[1:04:09] become meaningless, that mean nothing at
[1:04:10] the end of the day. But he says, "Come
[1:04:12] unto me. If any man thirst, come to me."
[1:04:15] What'd he tell the woman at the well? I
[1:04:17] offer you water that when you draw from
[1:04:19] it, out of you will come a well of
[1:04:20] living water. This will satisfy. This
[1:04:22] will quench. But what did he castigate
[1:04:24] them for? He says, "You won't come unto
[1:04:26] me that you can have life.
[1:04:28] You'll go to everything else, but you
[1:04:30] won't come to me to have life. You'll go
[1:04:32] to everything else, but you won't come
[1:04:34] to me." He says, "You will not come to
[1:04:35] me that you might have life." What I'm
[1:04:37] wanting to show you that there is a hope
[1:04:39] in Christ. There is a reality in Jesus
[1:04:42] Christ. There's something real and
[1:04:43] living in the word of God where you can
[1:04:45] come back to life.
[1:04:48] Hallelujah.
[1:04:50] He says the thief come not cometh not
[1:04:52] but for to steal. The thief comes to
[1:04:54] steal and to kill and to destroy. That's
[1:04:56] what this world is grabbing. You're the
[1:04:57] commodity. It's taking something away
[1:04:59] from you. It's drawing things away from
[1:05:01] you. It's changing the way we think.
[1:05:03] It's changing our expectations. He says,
[1:05:05] "But I am come that they might have life
[1:05:07] and that they might have it more
[1:05:08] abundantly." Amen.
[1:05:09] What I want to uh express to this phrase
[1:05:12] coming back to life. It's the reviving
[1:05:14] of hope. It's the reawakening of things
[1:05:16] that we ought to look forward to. It's
[1:05:18] sobering up from the intoxication of the
[1:05:21] technology and media that we consume on
[1:05:23] a daily basis. And I believe that if we
[1:05:25] could somehow get distance from that, if
[1:05:28] we could somehow get a little bit
[1:05:29] distance from that, you'll find that
[1:05:31] hope is still alive. That there's still
[1:05:33] good things to feed on. There's still
[1:05:35] good things to think about. and you can
[1:05:37] begin to awaken to the wonder of Christ
[1:05:39] that is all around us.
[1:05:42] If Apple is invading our bodies and
[1:05:44] things are becoming a little bit less
[1:05:46] real, we like people's avatars and their
[1:05:48] digital life more than we like the flesh
[1:05:50] and blood life that's right there with
[1:05:52] us.
[1:05:53] We fall in love with the the the the
[1:05:55] artificial uh uh images that they make,
[1:05:58] the fakes that they can make and the way
[1:06:00] that they can present themselves and the
[1:06:02] filters that people put. I preached a a
[1:06:04] couple sermons on no filter. You know, I
[1:06:06] I I think it would be a good idea for
[1:06:08] some of us to stop looking at ourselves
[1:06:10] on our cell phones through a veneer and
[1:06:12] through a filter and accept the way that
[1:06:14] we are and the way that God made us and
[1:06:16] not try to present ourselves to other
[1:06:18] people. They know you don't look like
[1:06:21] that. The only person you're fooling is
[1:06:23] yourself.
[1:06:26] Amen.
[1:06:27] And the reason why it works is because
[1:06:29] the way you feel when you see it.
[1:06:32] You need to sober up from the
[1:06:34] intoxication.
[1:06:34] Amen. says in Isaiah, "Ho, everyone that
[1:06:37] thirsteth, come ye to the waters. He
[1:06:39] that hath no money, come ye buy and eat.
[1:06:41] Come buy wine and milk without money
[1:06:43] without price. Why do you spend money
[1:06:45] for that which is not bread and labor
[1:06:46] for that that doesn't satisfy? Hearken
[1:06:48] diligently unto me, and eat ye that
[1:06:50] which is good, and let your soul delight
[1:06:53] in fatness. Incline your ear, and come
[1:06:56] unto me here, and your soul shall live."
[1:07:00] This is what the Bible invites us to do.
[1:07:02] I know it might not seem flashy like a
[1:07:05] cell phone and in in the full color and
[1:07:07] the way that these cell phones just have
[1:07:08] a way that they're inviting just even
[1:07:10] the way that the apps are designed and
[1:07:12] the way that things are done. They've
[1:07:13] been studying human nature. They've got
[1:07:15] billions of dollars and trillions of
[1:07:17] hours into it trying to figure you out
[1:07:20] and they're giving you what they know
[1:07:22] your brain wants. But it's not what your
[1:07:25] heart needs. It's not what gives joy.
[1:07:28] It's not what gives satisfaction. And he
[1:07:30] says, "Incline your ear unto me. Let
[1:07:33] your soul delight in fatness." There is
[1:07:35] a true abundance. There's true living.
[1:07:38] Oh, it's my desire that we as believers
[1:07:40] in this end time would come back to
[1:07:42] life.
[1:07:43] Amen.
[1:07:45] Amen.
[1:07:46] The Bible says, "The hope of the
[1:07:47] righteous shall be gladness." Proverbs
[1:07:50] 10:28, "The hope of the righteous shall
[1:07:52] be gladness, but the expectation of the
[1:07:54] wicked shall perish."
[1:07:56] That's the word.
[1:07:59] Cursed is the man that trusteth in his
[1:08:00] arm.
[1:08:02] He trustth in man, makes his flesh his
[1:08:05] strength. But blessed is the man whose
[1:08:07] hope
[1:08:09] the Lord is.
[1:08:11] He'll be like a tree
[1:08:14] whose roots will spread out.
[1:08:18] And can handle a drought,
[1:08:21] can handle the sun
[1:08:23] when things get boring, when things get
[1:08:25] tough. Jesus.
[1:08:27] It's like, yeah, I
[1:08:31] don't need a cheap thrill.
[1:08:32] I know it really satisfies.
[1:08:36] I I I'm not going to just take what the
[1:08:38] world's going to give me right now. I'll
[1:08:39] just wait on the Lord.
[1:08:41] I'll just think.
[1:08:43] I'll just meditate.
[1:08:46] I will seek the wonder of Christ in his
[1:08:48] word. I will incline my ear unto him. I
[1:08:51] will come unto him.
[1:08:53] This is the truth.
[1:08:55] Come unto him and he'll give you rest.
[1:08:58] Will
[1:08:59] the hope of the righteous shall be
[1:09:00] gladness. That's that satisfaction, that
[1:09:03] expectation, that joy. But the
[1:09:05] expectation of the wicked is death.
