TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but let's stand let's read in the word of the lord i'd like to read ruth chapter 1 verse 22 and then verse 1 of chapter 2. thank you brother micah just tremendous this evening ruth chapter 1 verse 22 and then i'd like to read the first verse of chapter two and tonight i trust i'm hoping to kind of bring to a conclusion um a series that we started when we preached began when we preached a sermon called hungry with the question mark hungry and it kind of continued on am i hung i am hungry and are you being fed and and eating to live and then it just it came to this i was pondering this thought that we're coming to tonight and it just kind of seemed like there was such a long prelude to it we're saying come to bethlehem and that when ruth came to bethlehem she didn't know who was going to be feeding her um she just came because of circumstances and that's really what i've been pondering this whole time is if you as the bride of christ are hungry there's only one who can feed you there's only one thing you can feed on and uh and even though it's been 16 something services we've been looking at this that's not suggesting at all it's taken that long for you to pick up on that but god is just kind of as a prelude looked at different things we've walked through these uh walk through it in a little bit of a lengthy way and so tonight we're trusting that we're able to come come to a conclusion in this ruth chapter 1 verse 22 so naomi returned and ruth the moabitus her daughter-in-law with her which returned remember that peculiar phrasing which returned saying that ruth is also returning returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest and we've been looking at that phrase in the bread of life bringing forth the bride this this uh god had visited his people and bringing them bread and now it's bringing this gentile with naomi and naomi had a kinsmen of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of elimelech and his name was boaz and we're going to try to read maybe all of chapter 2 tonight verse by verse but just following the lord as he would lead us if we could bow our heads heavenly father thank you for this gathering that we have this evening lord we've gathered in your name we have felt your presence my the voice is being lifted up and i rejoice to hear the people so comfortable worshiping and learning that it's not for show it's not what the next person hears lord but it's just open up our heart and open up our mouth and letting praise pour forth lord i pray i am so thankful that we have not structured our service by tradition nor are we coming traditionally but you've done something new and you've done it in a unique way that's bringing us out of our comfort zones and maybe the little boxes we've tried to put you in and tonight father you've identified yourself with us through worship in the worship lord now we pray that you take the bread of life and feed us and lord as i try to maybe deliver my closing burden on this thought of the bread of life and it feeding the bride in this hour and it's the only thing that really suffices and satisfies i pray that it would hit the mark and do so in a special way for each person individually because that's the part lord that may be so important for us to recognize that it's not a group move it's not a church move it's an individual affair in this hour so speak to us individually we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you may be seated just i want to make a few comments that kind of connect to where we were last time on a roof in the the statement we just read there in verse 22 how they came to bethlehem and that was uh kind of where we begin to look at the book of ruth is when we started looking at the statement the bread of life bringing forth the bride and we actually were using the sense of come to bethlehem that there's an invitation and there's a call and it was it was really looking at this verse right there which says they came to bethlehem in the time at the beginning of the barley harvest so we looked at that um how that naomi is returning at the beginning of barley harvest and that timing the timing of the barley harvest we looked at how remarkable it is in scripture all these different events that coincide with that whether it be the exodus out of egypt or the entrance into uh the promised land or the the timing of the crucifixion of jesus christ and the outpouring of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost you see these different junctures and so though it held the significance in terms of a very strict calendar in the order of the feast to the gen the jews to the gentile we begin to see the types that emerge and so it's not that we have to come to the lord on a certain day of the calendar that coincides with the jewish feast but we see these types and so ruth was coming to bethlehem at harvest time and last time we looked at just even the parallel the things that have transpired over the last 120 years and how that we see this move of god and the pentecostal move and the restoration of the gifts and how pentecost organizes and it is fallen away and as it falls away there's a there's a bride that's going to be coming forth at the same time orpah turns her back and goes back but then at that very same time ruth who types the bride she's coming forth and what we saw is a very striking parallel that i think just continues to support what we see in the scripture naomi returned it says in the barley at the beginning of barley harvest but she's returning in the season of the fig tree putting forth its leaves and we looked in the scripture we found that jesus gave that as a parable and a signal saying that when you see uh the this fig tree putting forth its leaves and and beginning to put forth a tender branch uh that this was a significant scriptural sign of the end time and then we see israel returns to its homeland and this zionist movement begins to pick up steam and we just looked at it historically and saw these very specific dates matching up and coinciding to where even israel then in 1940 declaring itself a declaration of independence identified as as a nation and so we see then naomi returned to her homeland then there's got to be a roof that's there got to be a ruth that's coming on the scene and making herself known and the statement we're just reading this is one of the last ones we had read last time oh the picture now ruth the gentile church just coming in and naomi the jewish church coming back now naomi type in israel the jewish church coming back to their homeland and then we're going to see what we're seeing is a restoration or bringing back of the body of christ that had even just quickly fallen away and organized even after just the revival that took place in the 1900s early 1900s he says and notice when they turned and went got back to the homeland they come in just in barley season and he's looking right there ruth chapter 1 verse 22. now anyone knows what barley season was it was pentecost the first fruits so we see that coinciding with these different spring feasts how the gentile church was brought in under the wings of the almighty god at pentecost the gentile church the bride and when she returned it was barley season now when you read that i can see that even in the way he just described it saying she was brought in at the feast of pentecost he was brought in on the day of pentecost she was brought in on the wings of almighty god and now when she's returning and now when she's coming back she's coming back in barley season now that she's being brought back through the word of god and being restored back to the original faith which was introduced introduced by jesus christ she's coming back to that the very scriptural time a very perfect time as she's coming back there's the fig tree putting forth its branch there's the barley season here's the harvest time and everything's just matching up perfectly so as we continue to read in chapter 2 verse 1 and now the story we took several services just to background chapter one and there's um there's no question that we could have spent more time in ruth chapter one even just on that last phrase the beginning of barley harvest so many other types and scriptural things we could put in there one thing and i don't believe i've mentioned it to you but one thing the lord reminded me of over and over and over again and this is this says uh maybe um giving some insight into how god was dealing with me personally he kept reminding me that this was a good this was it was good to do this verse but verse by verse to show you just how much is in the word of god and to teach you that when we read our bibles and we hear the word to open up our minds and ask god to give us understanding and to ponder things and wait on things and to realize just how much depth there is in the word that we've received and how it lines up with scripture and how much the word we've received opens up the scripture and so something the lord was constantly reminding me of in in doing this that he was wanting to show that we could just we could take a book in the bible we could take statements from the message of the hour and we can begin to line these things up and realize just a study that can unfold verse verse by verse and it'd be very instructive to us and enlightening to us and open up things that are very practical to us and so we are looking at these things uh verse by verse and as we come to this particular verse i want to start begin to read but remember how we have this perfect picture of today at this very moment we begin to read this we have pentecost has been restored and we have the jews going back into palestine then we must be in rapture time must be harvest time and there must be a bride that's going to be raptured so it says in verse 1 of chapter 2 and naomi had a kinsmen of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of elimelech that was naomi's husband elimelech and his name was boaz now the first thing i'd like to point out is it uses a very interesting word here for kinsmen it says naomi had a yada i had a kinsmen of her husband's of her husband elimelech and that means acquaintance so it really just means somebody that you would know or be acquainted with and the chapter introduces him and if we were reading this for the first time we might have thought well that's a little bit peculiar and let's say we didn't know anything else about the story we're just reading it we would be gathering that naomi had someone that she knew and someone that her husband knew acquaintance to her husband who had a lot of money or had a lot of wealth and so we might begin to think oh it's kind of signaling to us that she knows this person so she's going to go to him and ask for help or go to him and request that maybe she can get some assistance and so the word there is acquaintance it says he's a mighty man of wealth it's actually a phrase that's used i believe of gideon a mighty man of valor it's a to be valiant to have valor and he was a in one translation i think it's in the county it says a mighty man of the law it's meaning that kind of a paradox they even saved the time that was someone who's well versed in the law well versed in the word but also a man of great wealth says in his name was boaz that word means i think if you looked it up in your lexicon it would mean fleetness someone who's very quick to movement someone very fast but it means in him is strength he had strength of riches he had strength of power he had a great virtue he had a grace about him even when solomon built the temple he named one of the two uh pillars in the temple boaz because it signified just this strength this pillar that he was in the temple of god and so knowing that later on in solomon of one of two pillars names that boaz kind of shows us that this is the very important figure even in the temple of god that building of god the place that god is going to dwell boaz is a very important character in it he is the grandson of nashon he's the prince who is a prince of the tribe of judah his father was salmon who married rahab and so we know and we read this i think in this series in matthew chapter one verses four to six it's a we're looking at the lineage now of boaz and it's so important that unlike any any other place it goes through and it kind of drops down it's not just saying dad son dad son dad son when it comes to this passage it does something very unique amram begat amna dab and amna dab begat nashan and the sean beget salmon in salmon boaz of rahab and so this is the captain of the lord of hosts salmon who came in who is this general this great captain in the army he marries rahab who is a gentile harlot he marries her and then boaz begat obed of ruth so right back to back it stops and it backs up and it gives us this mystery of rahab this mystery of of of of ruth and then obed beget jesse and jesse beget david the king and david the king begat solomon of her that had been the wife of uriah again bringing in a gentile woman and this is really the mystery of the old testament kind of being joined together here at the beginning of the new testament but it shows us just how important boaz in the lineage of jesus christ boaz mary uh beau has his begotte of salmon and rahab than boaz marries ruth so we kind of know the end of the story we know that he's going to have a child he has obed whose son is then jesse jesse begets david the king david's son solomon takes the throne and builds the temple and names one of the pillars after boaz so this is a very important figure that's introduced as we read it now we have the benefit of going fast forward in history and and seeing it though that may be a paradox to go forward in history we have the book that tells us the whole story we can see being forward looking what who boaz is going to be and what he's going to represent so now it kind of introduces that and then it's important maybe we just read that he's an acquaintance of of of naomi so maybe they're going to go to him for help but notice how this story unfolds it's very remarkable verse 2 in ruth the moabitess they keep reminding us who she is said unto naomi let me now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him and whose sight i shall find graves and i want you to recognize this expression of humility on ruth's part and the submission that she can continues to have to naomi that she ask of naomi whether she can do it let me go she's asking permission let me go and notice the grace that she has to glean ears of corn after him and whose sight i shall find grace and she said under naomi says go my daughter so she got permission she's submitting herself to naomi it's a tremendous expression of humility and what she's going to do is she wants to go in labor she's going to go glean she's not saying hey is there anybody that knew my father-in-law that knew your husband that maybe we could go ask him for help and go with the handout she's saying i'm willing to work for this i'm willing to glean and such a beautiful expression of humility and a beautiful expression of the bride's character and i wanted to read in a couple places in leviticus 19 in deuteronomy chapter 24 of the law that ruth could have availed herself too it says in leviticus 19 verses 9 and 10 and when you reap the harvest of your land thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field neither shalt thou gather the gulenians of thy harvest and thou shalt not glean the vineyard neither shalt thou gather every grape of the vineyard thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger i am the lord your god these blasted socialists i'm telling you they're ruining us they are ruining us deuteronomy chapter 24 verse 19 notice it says when thou cut us down thy harvest and thy field and hast forgot a sheaf in the field thou shalt not go again to fetch it it shall be for the stranger for the fatherless and for the widow that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of thine hands now i know we like to trumpet the virtues of capitalism but i want you to think for a moment there's no virtue in capitalism anymore it's been taken over by greed the love of money is the root of all evil and if we had men of integrity and people who are christian had christian character and had morals at their core then capitalism would be wonderful because what we're reading here of people who would have been capitalist and they would have had great harvest and they would have had a lot of bounty and they would they would have harvested in such a way to where they would have left something for the poor to come and to work of their own accord and work by their hands and still have something to support themselves and the owner of the field wouldn't be like you know what if i could even just get the corners here and i could get everything then i could sell it so much a bushel or so much a weight i can get so much more at the market and then just try to sell everything so he could maximize his gains and maximize his profits this is the lord god sharing a principle with the the wealthy of israel to say look when you when you harvest your field leave some for the poor so that they can come and work themselves and get something out of it and i know it sounds like socialism but if anything and if and if i've roiled you up a little bit you'll forgive me by the time i get back in town in a few weeks but uh it's it's really just to cause you to think a little bit let's stop thinking politically but think more scripturally stop allowing ourselves to be polarized by democrat and republican and capitalism and socialism and just realize there's really a scriptural way to do things and when you leave the scripture then it's left to the democrats it's left to the republicans and capitalism won't work neither will socialism work because it's no longer governed by the lord thy god because god says here look if you will do this i will bless the work of your hands if you will labor have your field and you will harvest and in harvesting leave some and give some to the poor i will bless your gains i will bless your margins i will continue to give you wealth because you provided also for those the fatherless the widows and the poor it's beautiful in the scripture how it lays in there and now ruth could have availed herself to this because it says in the corners they can go and glean uh if you've left some behind you forgot to say if you left a sheaf in the field you actually harvest it and you left it don't go back and collect it leave it for somebody it's very very beautiful now ruth could have done that but the scripture phrases it a little bit differently says i want to go glean ears of corn after him and whose sight i shall find grace so leviticus 19 in deuteronomy 24 imposed upon them an obligation according to the word to leave it but now ruth is actually saying that if one would give me permission i would like to actually not wait until they're done or go into the corners but follow behind the laborers and pick up some things in the field while they're gleaning and while they're harvesting so that's when she says she actually wanted to enter into a little bit more of a special relationship because leviticus 19 in deuteronomy 24 would have been one of obligation that was required by the law but to do what ruth was doing one would have to grant her permission so in chapter verse three now as we continue ruth chapter two verse three and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging into boaz who was of the kindred of elimelech again kindred there just means he was family relation it wouldn't give us any kind of indication exactly who boaz was so we know that boaz is a mighty man of wealth in him is strength he is a kinsman or an acquaintance of elimelech now we know that maybe he's actually family of a limelit but still don't really know to what degree in what this will really mean in the story but as the way this is written and i've alluded to this a number of times in the last several services and it's been this verse that has really really excited me if you could just for a moment uh and do it with perfect recall recall all 15 other services that we preached and the trajectory of them and the emphasis that was being made from the time that we begin in ruth 1 chapter 1 verse 1 and all the things that are starting it opens with this famine and they run they run away to moab and there's a two three funerals and then there's an exodus out of moab and orpah goes back and ruth is coming in and they're all coming in because the lord had visited bethlehem judah and giving them grain and ruth is coming along out of death and out of out of this horrible situation she's coming along and she's not coming along with the perfect revelation and understanding of the law even here when she says can i go glean ears of corn after him whom i shall find grace she's not invoking the law she's not saying can i go to the corners and can i go see if anyone's left behind a chief she's just going trying to find grace and it's it's possible that naomi could have informed her of different things but even then the scripture wants us to know that even as it introduces a boaz he's just an acquaintance and then when he introduces him again he's a family member but notice what it says about ruth when she went begin to glean it says her hap in other words as it were by chance by coincidence and she just or she just happened it wasn't that she had the ways opened up or she had google maps open and she was saying you know how what's the directions to walk to the field to boaz she just was going out trying to find people who are harvesting so she was going out looking and she found some reapers and gleaners and we would see later on that we kind of get the back story a little bit do you mind if i follow behind and pick up some grain i'm a widow my mother-in-law's also a widow and we need some grain and they're like sure go ahead and she's beginning to labor and it says as it were by chance she happened to be going to the field belonging into boaz then there would have been no fences there would have been no uh structures put up they would not have built the wall and had their neighbor pay for it there would have been uh just landmarks that would indicated where the um where the land was boaz is where it was somebody else's and so there was actually no fence there was no sign put up there she just girls and finds people who are harvesting and as it were by chance she finds herself in the field of boaz she was not led of her own accord she wasn't being very deliberate she wasn't conspiring and she wasn't saying well boaz is a wealthy man maybe i can find favor with him she was just being she was being led there and drawn there by maybe a natural need in her own life but it was god it was divine providence that's leading her to that field i want you to think about it with everything that we've emphasized through several services and the things we've seen in the word of the hour that teach us just how important this book of ruth is and how she represents a type of the bride and how the the conditions she had to come out of the opposition that she faced the showdown that she went through so she is walking through these different steps and it's important then that she's not premeditating and figuring it all out and saying oh i know what i'm going to do i'm going to go to the wealthiest man i know related to to elimelech or related to my husband who's now dead but she is led by divine providence why because she's a type of the bride and so god has to draw ruth out of moab and then begin to direct her steps even on this very day within this this 24-hour period god is going to take her and she's just humble and she's willing to work and she's willing to serve and she's humbling herself to naomi and she's saying oh let me go work with my hands and find us some grain and glean a little bit so we have something to live off of and then god begins to work with her heart and draws her and moves her and brings her right by chance as it were to the very field to boaz oh my she has to do that because she's a type of the bride and then verse four and behold boaz came from bethlehem you'll find that the mystery of his coming unfolds in the book of ruth boaz came from bethlehem now it's not just ruth in the field gleaning and trying to harvest and doing these things now boaz who's the christ type is coming to where she is catch this part this to me is the beautiful the beautiful part this is part to me what god revealed to me part of that hidden mystery the hidden meaning in ruth that when you see it it brings you real close to god he says that she came boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reapers the lord be with you and they answered the lord bless thee so notice how the story goes and just the the conjunction of verse 3 and verse 4 once ruth came to the field the lord of the harvest appears in the field once ruth is there it says boaz came from bethlehem now ruth doesn't know him but this isn't a story this isn't a story of coincidence we've just pointed out in verse three even though the bible says oh she just kind of happened in the field of boss something is leading her something is getting her this isn't but this isn't coincidence saying oh well this happened can you believe this happened and that happened and you're just reaching for straws we took several services looking at how many parallels there are to the what god is doing in this day so we know these things aren't coincidence we know god is watching over this story because it speaks such a beautiful thing to us so it's not just a story of coincidences there's a hidden meaning in it that when we see it it brings us close to god and then ruth she comes to the field and she's going to find substance to feed her soul or to feed herself and to feed naomi and as the time that she arrives boaz decides to come so beautiful verse 5 then said boaz unto his servant that was said of the reapers whose damsel is this now notice there was one who was the head over all the reapers one who is the head over all the laborers and boaz meets with the messenger first that's who he meets with first he meets with the messenger first he meets with the the one who set over the reapers and he's there one set over the labors he'd be like a prophet and ministry underneath that prophet they're all subject one to another boaz he goes to the one who said of the reaper says whose damsel is this so when boaz wants to talk he wants to start talking about one person he's not talking about all the other reapers he's not talking about all the other women all the other people in the field his subject is the bride and and i want to suggest this and i appreciate you that uh just kind of bearing with me to say this boaz came and it's i would like to say this it's not even that she stood out but he knew beforehand yeah she might have dressed a little bit different and when he says whose damsel is this he might have asked what nation is she from because she might not look like all the other women and she might have been dressing just a little bit different but as i continue to read in this story boaz inquires of ruth because that is why he came it's not again it's not just coincidence that boaz shows up but boaz is coming god had been leading ruth now he's directing boaz and when boaz comes it's as if there's something already in his heart that he wants to know about ruth he wants to know about her he's wanting to become acquainted with her he wants to have an introduction with her but before he can talk to her he comes to the messenger first and then the introduction is made to ruth think about the type to the time that we're living in then in verse six and seven and the servant that was said over the reapers answered and said it is the moabitess damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab and she said again look at the humility of ruth i pray you let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she came and have continued even from the morning until now that she carried little in the house she wasn't busying herself with anything else she was staying in the field from the morning even until now labor and she asked permission first and she's there laboring in this field gathering of these sheaves and trying to bring in grain that she could feed herself and naomi and so it speaks again to the character of ruth and it kind of gives it gives us a precursor of what had happened so she shows up led by god's divine providence and there's a messenger there there's a one who's over the reapers and he's the one there that's going to allow her to begin to glean and to begin to reap and it would be under his direction that she begins to be able to gather some grain and to gather these things together so that it can support her and so it kind of gives us a backstory what had happened that morning but now after the messenger after the servant who is said of the reapers has this conversation with boaz verses 8 9 it says then said boaz under ruth here is thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens notice what he's telling her notice the instruction that he's given her this is this is how christ ought to speak to you you ought to have a conviction that what you're feeding on is the truth you ought to be convinced that the thing that is leading you and guiding you is the lord himself and not to have this attitude well i just want to hedge a little bit and i want to i want to dabble in this and dabble in that and seek out this and seek out that and kind of hedge yourself with all sorts of ideas and theologies and groups and doctrines and belief systems you want to know that where god has led you is the place where there is an absolute there's a place where the voice of god is where the word is feeding you and there's no question that there's a source of life that's going to lead me and guide me something that's going to wash me something has a source of salvation a source of healing and this is exactly what boaz is trying to get ruth to understand there's no other place to go go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be in the field that they do reap and go thou after them stay in the field have i not charged the young men that thou shalt that they shall not touch thee and when thou art the thirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn he said i'll provide whatever you need i'm gonna have young men labored in this field who are charged that they are you're not her property you're you are not their their token you are not theirs to abuse they are not you are not theirs to tell what to do but they're there merely to feed you and to support you and to be there to labor together with you in the harvest to see that you get what you need and what i want you to take from this is you set your eyes upon these verses and ponder what is being said by boaz to ruth ruth still doesn't know exactly what's transpiring she doesn't know how this story ends but boaz being led by god and maybe even beforehand knowing who she was goes to her and says don't go anywhere else to feed don't go anywhere else for ideas don't go anywhere else for support but stay right here in the word of god and that listen this is a word to us there is no other message there is not to be an eighth messenger there is not to be another move of god there is not to be some other bible that's to be written christ is the name of the lord jesus christ is the only name under heaven given whereby men shall be saved and there's only one savior there is only one atonement there is no other message he's saying i'll give you servants who will feed you i'll give you water that'll quench your thirst and i'm telling you come to a place in the word of god you've come to a word in this hour where it's a field that you should not leave it's a place for us to stay not to another field don't glean in another field don't get your eyes caught into something else you want to know that you've come to that field verse 10 notice again her humility she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground covering her face as it were veiling herself as it were and said why have i found grace and thine eyes that thou should just take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger why why me why would you show this kindness to me why would you express such words to me now verse 11 i'd like to read verse 11 and 12 from the targum as we read from it before so that you could see this if you go ahead and get that up there verses 11 and 12. i want to read it from the targum so that again this is more conversational and it injects certain things in there so you could catch how the traditionally how they viewed this exchange between boaz and ruth boaz replied and said to her it has surely been told to me concerning the word of the sages that when the lord decreed concerning them he did not decree any against any but the men and it was told to me by prophecy that there will come forth from you kings and prophets because of all the kindness which you have done for your mother-in-law he's not there she just happened to feel the boaz but boaz just didn't run into a beautiful moabite girl that morning and say oh she's cute i'd like to get her number hey what's your snap can you give me your phone number hey can we keep in touch can i you know can i hit you up on instagram no he knew by prophecy god had already spoken to this man in him who is his strength this valiant man this man as the bible tells us that he was a mighty man of valor a man of great wealth a man who was mighty in the law and knew the word and was in tune to the prophecies he says it was told to me by prophecy that from you would come kings from you would come prophets because of your kindness to your mother-in-law because you have supported her after your husband died and you forsook your god and your people and your father and mother in the land of your birth and went to become a proselyte and to dwell among the people who are not known to you before may the lord repay you a good payment in his world for your in this world for your good deeds and may your reward be perfect in the next world from before the lord the god of israel to whom you've come to become a proselyte and to sh and and to shelter under the shadow of his glory of shekinah and by that marriage you will be saved from the judgment of guyana which is hell so that your portion notices your portion may be with sarah and rebecca and rachel and leah there's no other place he could have put her that would have been greater to a hebrew for an israelite to say it these matriarchs of sarah rebecca rachel leah there could be none greater if you say the god of abraham isaac and jacob that would speak of the eternal omnipotent omniscient god of abraham isaac and jacob who was the god of israel but then to say sarah rebecca rache and leah were then to bring in the motherhood the wife and the the very matriarchs of the people of israel kind of like the keystone joining the children to these men of abraham isaac and jacob this is such a tremendous statement that he makes he's saying look may god give your portion may god give your portion as a gentile woman with sarah rebecca rachel and leah how could this be unless she be a type of the very bride of the heavenly bridegroom the very wife of the lord of glory so ruth now in this scene as you see here now you have a woman and a man standing in the field ruth has been brought to boaz and what he's doing is he's prophesying over her you may not realize it but you're going to give birth to kings you're going to give birth to prophets you're going to be counted among sarah rebecca rache and leah what's happening they're acting out redemption portraying that bride type and in this as he speaks and he brings ruth is there with boaz in the field he speaks of rebecca and may your portion be with rebecca and in genesis chapter 24 i'd like to read verses 63 to 67 just to see this the symmetry now with with isaac and it speaks of how that isaac had come down he had been dwelling in the south country comes back to this he's in this other place now it says isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening tide at evening time he comes he arrives to a place he arrives to meditate in the field he comes to a certain place in the field and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and this is the camel train of the servant of abraham and what is he doing he's bringing back rebecca and so he had come to a specific place where his bride was going to be coming to he was coming to the place to where the shout the messenger bringing the bride forth bringing it to isaac and this is the very place that isaac finds himself we see this parallel that there's been a shout a messenger the bread of life bringing forth the bride where is it going to bring her to not some geographical location in indiana and not some a sparse place in alaska we're not all going to be herded into railcars and shipped off to some concentration camp no it's the word of god gathering us to christ and she comes he comes to this place in the evening time he lifts up his eyes and sees the camel's coming and rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel she jumped off the camel she began to run to this one and i think it's beautiful how the bible then tells us why for she had said unto her servant so before she ran to him she had said what man is that walking in the field to meet us who is this man and the servant said it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself at the very time when ruth is standing there before boaz and boyz begins to speak these wonderful things to her and tell her how he's going to take care of her she fell on her face and covered herself she veiled her face before boaz and now when when rebecca finds out who is this man coming towards us in the field she's not sure who it is but something in her prompts her to ask the question and the master the servant of the master says it is my master it is isaac the one i told you about behold your bridegroom cometh he comes out to meet you and then she covered her face and humbled herself and ran out to meet him in the field do you see the parallel to what what has happened for us in the word of god in this hour and whereas it's not us that's asking the questions but the messenger begins to preach sermons like who is jesus what is the attraction on the mount who is this melchizedek who do you say this is right and asking these questions and the questions weren't his the question was actually ours the question was actually that of the bride the question was actually the response of the people who is jesus who what is the attraction of the mouth who is this melchizedek who do you say this is where are we now identified christ of all ages i believe the subtitle is where where are we now what what's transpiring now what's happening who is this man what are we confronted with what are these signs speaking of what's taking place in this hour and those sermons were an answer to the question that was in our heart and when we catch the answer it is your master behold the master is come once again the master's here and he call it for thee then that's what motivates us to run into the field and this is what's transpiring in genesis 24. it's what's taking place in ruth chapter 2. and these are just maybe little things that i don't i don't know that they mean much but the kind of the types of people who love the numbers it's in verse 65 that the introduction is made chapter 24 verse 65. april six at five o'clock in the morning a prophet was born on the 24th day of the 12th month of 1965 the 24th day of last month a year 1965 he passes away the introduction had been made his job had been done so the next verse and the servant told isaac all the things he had done the servant now can go report beyond the curtain of time he can go make the report and say i've done my part i've done what to do and then what transpires this is where the mystery is and isaac brought her into his mother sarah's tent and took rebecca and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was comforted after his mother's death this is the mystery that unfolds after the introduction we see that in genesis chapter 24 back to ruth chapter 2. i know we really amplified verses 11 and 12 but as he brings the picture of sarah rebecca rachel and lee into the picture then ruth responds in verse 13 then she said let me find favorite thy sight my lord for that thou hast comforted me we see the comfort now being given and for that thou has spoken friendly unto thine handmaid though i be like unto one of i'd be not like under one of thy handmaids and boaz said unto her listen this is the if you go back and just remember the whole thought theme of this if you're hungry you need to be fed right you need to feed on the right things you need to be eating to live this is this is where we ought to be in our revelation this is what we ought to be certain of and boaz said unto her at meal time come thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar now this is an invitation that you just don't give to anybody it's not yeah there's you know there's a soup line over here there's a bread line over here yeah just you can come and you can pick what you want but no he's inviting her to the table at meal time come and sup with me revelations 3 20 come and eat with me at meal time don't just get the scraps don't be begging for bread but at meal time come thou hither let me just express this to you you ought to have a relationship with god and something that's leading you to when it comes time for church you know you're showing up at a table where you belong where you can eat bread and you can dip your morsel in the vinegar listen this is not an hour we say well if we can't get a whole loaf i want a slice find a whole loaf we're not living in the hour of scraps we're not living in the hour begging for bread we're living in the hour where a full seven course meal has been made available to the bread we ought not to be beggars anymore we ought to be at a table where we know we can dip in the vinegar and meal time come and eat eat of the bread dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the reapers and she's close to him because he reached her parts corn i guess maybe the grammar tea english teachers might be like what can you borrow me a pen says he reached her parts court it means he handed it out to her he gave her parts corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left what a privilege what a privilege is being extended to roof she's not quite sure what's happening she just knows this is wonderful this is great can't we all testify when god got a hold of us we started walking in the blessed light of the word of god we said this is wonderful this is great the fellowship we have the provision we have the churches we're going to and the things we're fellowshipping it oh i haven't known such joy this is so wonderful this is so great the privilege that god extended the fact that he passed to her the parched corn and as she eats it it's satisfying in her it's given her something she needs oh are you hungry this is what will satisfy are are you being fed this is the only kind of table that's going to feed you to where you can be satisfied when you leave oh so beautiful now i'm going to skip verses 15 and 16. i want to come back to them i want to come back to it just because i feel like the emphasis there will fit in a moment in verse 17 now after she's been given these wonderful things it says so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she had gleaned and it was about an ifa of barley and she took it up and went into the city now this is a lot and ethan this would be what would have been offered as a wave sheath this is just not a few scraps let's see if we can make a little biscuit she's got she's got a whole fifa of barley and she took it went to the city and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave it to her that she had reserved and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed and her mother-in-law said in her where is thou gleaned today and where rodist thou bless be he that did take knowledge of thee and she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought so she knew wow what look at this bounty that she's bringing this is marvelous and said the man now ruth says the man's name with whom i wrought today is boaz now this is this is just ruth trying trying to tell the story oh you know i just kind of ran into this field saw some people gleaning i thought i asked permission if i could follow behind the reapers and i began to gling and and so she's saying in the man's field the man's name i wrought today because that's the question that naomi had was boaz and naomi said under her daughter-in-law her her response is very effusive it's it is she has this great excitement blessed be he of the lord who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead naomi and ruth the the living but then when she says also to the dead she's evoking this this connection to redemption that they which are lives then remaining and those that were dead had gone past the hope of redemption had to be made through those that were alive and she's saying we who are living you ruth who are alive have made contact with one today that gives hope to those that are dead this can revive those that are dead this can give life to a limit like this can give life to muhammad this is this is amazing his kindness to the living of the dead and naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us this is not just an acquaintance of my husband this is not just somebody that your your father when he was a child would have known but she says he is one of our next kinsmen this is though it's translated the same but this isn't the same word that's used in verse one in verse one it's yadda he's acquaintance yeah i know him he's an acquaintance but now when it got uses this word in chapter in verse 20 of chapter two he is our girl it means he is one that can redeem or act as a kinsmen redeemer when she says he is the next kinsman it's actually taken from the word this word is actually translated to redeem in the old testament it was he is our redemption he is our redeemer and so there's a revelation that comes from the word there's a revelation that comes from naomi which we are using even to be reflective of the scripture that listen ruth you haven't just happened into some field where someone is being kind to you you haven't just happened into an assembly or into a belief system where they're going to kind of take care of you and have systems in place that help the struggling widows and help those who don't have this and kind of show you the ways of salvation and teach us the 12 steps to get along in a wicked age none of those things are transpiring for she's saying you have actually came into the field unknowingly to you to the one who can redeem us she had no idea what was happening but that's where she found herself and if you could place yourself right here in the harmony of this word and see yourself in the trajectory or even the journey of ruth when god led us to this word we knew that something told us to stay here and we've never left it we knew that something was in this word that satisfied and we stayed in this word and we stayed faithful to it regardless of what was happening and he began to feed us and he began to sustain us but in the process of time the scripture comes alive and we realize it isn't just a son of man but where we've actually been feeding and where we've been fed it's not just a field but it's the field of the son of man these aren't things that all became apparent to us and opened up to us on day one oh yeah well no this is where i'll be no it was progressive to us and some of us can have this revelation as of late whoa i thought i was just biding my time in this field until something else was going to happen but the very thing i've been asking for the very thing i was hoping for the very thing that we thought we were all waiting for is happening right next to us very thing we fasted for and prayed for and shouted for and tried to call the caps down for the very thing we all believed that was was so supposed to be happening but would happen one day is happening right around me this is redemption listen it's not by accident we've been drawn together going for a second just think don't think about what god's doing here is just natural don't don't think about though our challenges as of late have been in natural things and where are we going to meet and what's what's the next step for us as far as having a natural building it could be that god is just sparing us the natural building because we're going to a new tabernacle one that won't dissolve and here we are gathered around things that matter things that are important it's not by accident we've been drawn together what have we been drawn together for not to play church not to start a church but for the fullness of redemption that's our objective and that's our aim is the fullness of redemption and that's what brought ruth to that field that day and she went home with a full bag she had no idea wow this is quite a haul and it was naomi that says ruth this just isn't a man just this isn't some nice guy this just isn't some rich guy this is the very one that can redeem you and so ruth says in verses 21 and 23 she says well he said unto me also thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest this is what he said stay in this field i've got servants that'll keep look out after you true servants who won't abuse you true ones who'll look out after you true ones that'll feed you stay fast by my young men these young men are going to take this message in a more powerful way than it is now that they're going to take these things and preach them to you stay with them this is my this is my field this is my word stay in the field i've got servants who will feed you shepherds that's my own heart who who will look out after you who will feed you and you'll feel no fear no more he's telling to stay in this field and it's even what we skipped in verses 15 and 16 and when she began when she was risen up to gleam boaz commanded his young men saying this is what he told him this is the mystery of why ruth was going away with such a big haul this is what he had told the servants let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her knot don't hassle her don't manipulate her don't control her don't scare her off don't tell her that that's your corn don't tell her that that's your field don't tell her that it's your job and your your testimony and your ministry you make sure she gets the grain you make sure she can harvest reproach or not shame or not buff it or not turn it away not and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not as he had ordained servants in the field to be sure that ruth would get everything she needed that's why he said hold fast to my young men why because these young men were under a commission they had been under commission that until the rapture is over you see that ruth is fed until this harvest is done you see that she's looked out after you remain faithful i've commanded them not to touch you i've commanded them that they're not yours but you will harvest among my sheaves and in my field as one that has a right to it as your own just as it says in first kings 17 9 that it when elijah had been sustained at the brook jericho the ravens had come and ravens were feeding him but then it turned and it said go to zeraphath because there i've commanded a widow woman to sustain you just as there have been a widow woman of zarephath this woman to sustain elijah the prophet sustained his ministry we see in type here in ruth chapter 2 that there had been young men commissioned and ordained to look after ruth to be sure that she received everything everything she needed in the harvest time this is this is where i'm concluding is we should be able to see ourselves in this this is the place ordained to satisfy your hunger this is the revelation that it's not just a message it's not just a messenger it's not just a religion it's not just a thought process it's not just a way of viewing things to try to make sense of the world but it is the living bread of life it is christ who satisfies your hunger this is where we eat to live what we see in taipei ruth chapter 2 this is where we eat to live this is what we eat to live the word of god and when i say the word i'm talking about the the fullness of it we should be in it we should be feeding on it not not have a pet doctrine where we just want to kind of feed on this one area and really drill down in this one area or we just want to go over here and drill down in this and feed on that but we want the whole word of god we want the promises for this day to be made alive to us by revelation we want to be walking where he is and in his presence where the shekinah glory is this is where we're this is what satisfies the hunger but mike if you'd come brother braham says and proven his word in the last days there's got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest and we're now living by the evidence of the new land the son of man living by it that means it's what's causing us to live we're living by it it's our substance it's what sustains us and what's the evidence of the new land the son of man in one way we could say he is that land it's the land of the son of man the son of man we're living with the evidence of it we're living with the fruits of it it's what feeds us so the chapter ends verses 22 and 23 and naomi said unto ruth her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other field and this is what it speaks of ruth so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of the barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother-in-law there's a place where you can be satisfied where he reaches you parks corn where he allows you to dip the morsel in the vinegar where you can eat and be satisfied [Music] and in all our satisfying and all the pleasure that we derive from the word sometimes there's just a greater revelation that shows us just exactly who's feeding us it's not personality it's never been a man it's never been associated merely with people but it's about christ there's a place there's got to be a place where the word is made manifest and we can live by this absolutely live by it are you hungry i am hungry then there's a word that can feed us there's a word made available this in this hour where we eat it we don't live to eat we eat to live it's not pretense it's not for show it's not to put on it's not to have put on these airs of having church and and in some formidable group that needs to be reckoned with but it's about coming to a place where we're at a table to eat and what i get on a wednesday night is is to feed me on a thursday morning what i feed on a sunday morning should be paying dividends on a tuesday afternoon making differences in my relationships making differences in how i relate to money making differences and how i perceive offenses and and talk about things and process things and experience things there's a place there's a table that i can be eating at there's a there's food that i can be processing towards causing me to be healthy spiritually it is the bread of life in this hour so we've been invited to come to bethlehem and we realized that as we come to bethlehem there's a condition that we must come out of and as we come out of that condition and fight through that condition there's an opposition that'll come against us and certainly we know it comes to a showdown but this is what awaits you when you've made that clear-cut decision and say i'm going all the way with the lord i know i've made up my mind i've got to enter into this promise i've got to come into this place when you come into this place what awaits you is your boaz who will give you the clean profiter who'll give you the word of god who's ordained servants to look out after you and it's that very promise of christ boaz in the field that's even brought you forth to begin with how did you ever make it out of the condition how did you ever make it past the opposition why did you ever win in the showdown because there was one going to meet you in the field it was always the living bread of life bringing forth the bride that's what's going to feed you praise the lord let's stand to our feet thank you jesus thank you lord [Music] bow your heads with me please [Music] i know that in walking through these scriptures reading even that statement i read at the last there's things contained in this and even things that i'm alluding to you might even say well it seems almost cryptic or you're pointing to certain things if those things aren't quicken to you or you don't understand those things then you don't don't try to view it through my eyes don't try to figure out well what point is brother aaron trying to make or what what's he alluding to ask yourself what does christ want me to see what does he want you to see tonight what more does he have for you that you're not feeding on what greater understanding could you have of the word that he can give you and just look at it very personal tonight because these things must be personal to us with heads bowed you want the lord to touch you tonight you need healing lift your hand to him you need deliverance lift your hand to him whatever you have need of he's here present tense to meet those needs a gracious heavenly father hands are raised all over this church tonight and it could be dozens of different needs lord dozens of different expressions and a request dozens of different circumstances even within the same household you could have different personalities and different approaches and different perceptions and different needs even within a marriage a husband crying out for one thing a wife crying out for the other but lord it is striking to know that there can still be one that satisfies and the lord you know just what kind of corn to reach to us tonight you know just what kind of morsel to put in our hands and invite us to dip into the vinegar lord i pray that tonight you could impose yourself upon us tonight lord as boaz showed up in that field moved by prophecy moved by understanding to seek out ruth and begin to speak in a gentle way towards her in a way to encourage her in a way to bless her lord come to my field tonight come to my defense come to my aid lord and speak to me the things that are necessary the things that i need to hear to know that i'm going to make it the things that i need to hear to know the price has been paid the provision is available i pray father you have a grace for us tonight help us strengthen us and encourage us lord i commit the people to you tonight praying that you bless them for their attentiveness and their faithfulness bless those who are unable to be here sickness and families and sudden obligations lord that keep some out of the house of god some traveling many lord out for different reasons i pray you would bless them lord may it be your compassion that would woo anybody who through disobedience stayed out of church tonight may it be your compassion lord no condemnation but just a tenderness that deals with their hearts to know that where they should be is at this table bless them i pray lord unless your people are here the hands that were raised may they receive that touch that they so desire in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
