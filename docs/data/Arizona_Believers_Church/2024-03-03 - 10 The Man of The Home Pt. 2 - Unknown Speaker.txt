TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'd like to just jump right into it um there will be a few things here at the outset that might be a little bit of a call back to Wednesday night but we're continuing on the man of the home we're not calling it The Mel of the house we're calling it The Man of the home to express some particulars about what it means to be a man but then also uh not just having houses but having those houses to be homes and so a lot of things that we're kind of gathering together and when we talked about the man of the home on Wednesday our thought was a man that's in his rightful place uh and a house that's in order a house that's not divided it becomes a home and so we're those are some of the principles we've been building on and so just here at the outset there's going to be a few things a couple scriptures or three scriptures and a couple quotes uh that we did Wednesday night but I'd like to just jump into it not so much as a review but as uh going forward now in verse 23 of Ephesians chapter 5 having just read this we we're right in the middle of this our minds are uh focused on this it says for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body now what we re should take away from this isn't so much that the man is the head of the wife but that how it's characterized that he's the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church so man's headship is defined his headship of the wife in the home is defined by the headship of Christ over the church now let's just admit it you couldn't get more absolute you couldn't get more total if we could say total control or total dependence however you'd want to describe that uh but it is describing the leadership that the man has over the woman now I'm going to acknowledge and come to it maybe here in a little bit that that could begin to cause some people to get a little bit uncomfortable when we think about what Christ is to the church and that the man somehow is going to be that to his family but there's a there's a side of Christ that if we don't put it in the picture yeah it's going to lead to something it's not supposed to be but this is how Paul is presenting it as brother bradam says in Jehovah Gyra he says you're supposed to be the boss of the house he says this to the man you're supposed to be the boss of the house he says you are the ruler the Bible said the man shall rule so that this is establishing this relationship of the man to the woman the relationship of the man within the family and he says he's the he uses the phrase boss of the house you're the ruler and and we bring that we see that in Genesis he says not a dictator now so you may be a boss but don't be bossy right there's a there's something he's saying here not a dictator and you could say well you may be the boss of the house but not in the sense of being an employer or being one that has been tasked with oversight of somebody who's trying to uh increase the company's bottom line so when he says you're the boss of the house he's kind of using that in a way to as a type to show what what a man would be within the home cuz he says not a dictator not not a floor matat that's right so the man isn't the woman isn't to be a floor matat and be under his feet and he says he made him a helpmate a sweetheart so the woman is to be a help meet she's a sweetheart she's a companion and even brother Brandon when he's talking about church order he says we feel that no one person then is a dictator or something in the church so even though a church may have an ultimate Authority and you have a pastor who would be the head of the local body and in this government and this Gathering it it's not there's no office and there's no excuse to become a dictator to be bossy uh to turn those that you lead into a floor matat so he says that no one person is a dictator though he might actually have control brother Bram says in one place that and not to make anybody nervous he says but the pastor can fire the whole board the trustees and the deacons and start all over says he's got power to do that and he's speaking to the brandom Tabernacle and he says we hope it never comes to that but he has that he has that Authority now what a dictator would do is probably just do that on the regular and everybody like oh you know it's getting to that time of year where the pastor's ready to you know chop some heads and send out some pink slips and start all over again because there's a way that that power can be exercised the wrong way brother brandham says in the sermon is your life worthy of the Gospel he says may you men that's got your wives and let them be the boss of the house and lead you around he's saying this is May the god of heaven give you Grace to set your foot down and bring that woman back to a right mind again he says yeah and you all might be thinking yeah and so there's this quite a statement that a woman who's the boss of the house and leading you around he says you've got to have Grace to set your foot down you don't want to do it in the wrong way he says but in order to bring that woman back to her right mind and he says and realize that that's your place in Christ what what's his place in Christ to be the one that's leading because he says she is the boss of the house and leads you around he says you got to realize that's your place in Christ in Christ he says not a boss so we got some competing statements here which one you going to take from you know in February of 1961 or do you want to go with June of 63 which one is it which one do you want to take he says not a boss so in other words it's not a literal boss it's not one that you know can fire you and those different things he says now but you are you are the head of the house so the man is to be the leader he's to be a boss in one sense and by type but then he's not to be a dictator and in another way saying not a boss you can't take that too far but realize that it's your place in Christ to do the leading First Corinthians 11:3 says but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ now that's first the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man now when it says that it's clearly orienting the man as the head to the woman but not before he says that the head of the man is Christ so what's happening he's ordering this correctly and then I love how he circles back to Christ and says the head of Christ is God this is the this is the proper order of things just here in one this one sentence it lays out such a beautiful architecture in God's mind this is God's word that's arranging all things this is his arrangement for the home a and this is him putting things in order in other words it's it's kind of being aligned proph ly you have man whose head is Christ and then this man now whose head is Christ he's to be the head of the woman and if he moves out from underneath the headship of Christ then the alignment's not right even if he maintained headship of the woman if he's not aligned under Christ then something's not right because Christ's head is God and our head is Christ it's in order for things to be lined up properly so Christ is it says the head of every man that speaks of the male also is translated to husband the man is to be the husband is to be the wife or the woman's head now there's may be a lot that we could get lost in in just this quick uh type I'd like to point out but if a man is in his place if the head is in its rightful place then the rest of the family can be in alignment so because there's there's God there's Christ and then the man we see the man's kind of in here now if the man gets out of place and then everyone else lines up under him then they're all out of place so the man has to be in place in order for the rest of the family to be in alignment in other for it to function properly and if we were to draw just from the natural type of the human body and we see that Paul does this in many different places how the body works together and is formed together that when you speak of alignment it's when the head the shoulders the spine the hips the knees and the ankles all kind of relate and line up properly and if this is critical this alignment is critical for the body's movement for the mechanics of the of the body for your posture to be right there's all these different things that have to be in alignment sometimes you might be experiencing some pain in certain parts of your body and you go to the doctor the chiropractor and you see a specialist and you're thinking oh man my uh uh my shoulders really bother me my shoulders really bother me and they point out another part of the body that's really tight or or out of order and it's caused the other part of the body to compensate or get pulled itself where a lot of times there's back pain that you might have here and it's all because of tightness in the front because you're you're get there's this atrophy there's this tightening up and you feel it in your back oh my back's hurting what you need to do is open up more and stretch out because there's times when certain parts are out of alignment or suffering and it causes other parts to suffer so proper alignment or improper alignment put stress on the spine put stress on the on the nervous system so if things can be lined up properly it puts less stress on the other parts of the body it relieves the nervous system and there's even you know some approach to Wellness that begins with the alignment of the head and neck and they in some practitioners in this area they're going to look at the body and no matter what's in it they're going to start by saying we need to get your head in place we need to get your neck and spine lined up right and then it can begin to address everything else and that may be an approach to uh maybe in some ways a holistic look at the body in a way of uh addressing maladies within person's sickness and within their flesh and whether it be bones or muscles it's a matter of getting the head right now I'm not advocating for that approach necessarily I'm just acknowledging that it's there but the truth is that the word tells us get the head right and the rest will be right so the man must be in his place to keep the other parts of the body from being pulled out of their place and stressed because if you take the head of Christ is God so God Christ and then the man is supposed to be in alignment with this and you have a man that leaves his place and the family is trying to hold their place in Christ that man being out of his place is going to put stress on the rest of the family going to put pressure now when Paul establishes man's headship or the husband as he says the the the head of the woman is the man this man translated to husband so we're looking at it in that specific relationship this isn't this isn't for men and males to kind of look out on all women and you know you're at the grocery store woman you know just all every random stranger every female out there you're the head of but it's talking about the relationship is what defines uh establishes this but as he places the man as the head he defines it he doesn't just say well the man is the head of the woman and then we're kind of left to interpret that how we want to or uh demonstrate that how we think it should be but he defines it as I say like Christ and and the phrase he uses is even as Christ we've already read it twice uh today or we can look at it again in Ephesians chapter 5:21 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church so you're to nourish and cherish your wife it's it's to take care of and he uses that phrase even as Christ even as Christ is the head even as the Lord the church this phrase even as keeps coming up and he and he says the head is we've already read this the head is the savior of the body he's the deliverer he's the preserver he's the one that keeps safe he's the one that keeps sound makes well so when it says that the the the man is the head I know maybe kind of like the idea that the head is on top and everything supporting it you know and everything's just in awe the head right and we're all going to do we're all going to just serve the head and serve the head but then the way it's described is kind of this it's kind of turns it around it's kind like the head is the one that preserves and the the head is the one that nourishes and the head is the one that delivers and keeps safe and keeps sound and makes well it says in verses 25 and 26 in chapter 5 of Ephesians husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it notice how that when Paul refers to uh this alignment he kind of helps us understand what it means by giving us some description love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it so this love is sacrificial this love is giv it's not selfish that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word now so in the same way that Christ is a sanctifier and a washer and a giver the man is to be that way to the woman or to the family the as a giver he gives himself for his wife as The Giver as the head as the Lover he gives himself to his family it means he allows himself to be used for them doesn't take the attitude of I'm I'm the head I'm the boss this is what I love to do this is what makes me happy this is what you know we all need to do what I want to do but he's a little bit more sensitive to figure out you know what's best for the family what's best for my wife and my children and how can we work together in this he's a sanctifier that means he separates from Wicked things set apart from things that spoil sets apart from things that harm that's the primary duty of a husband is to give watch out over his home and and to look out after so can separate from Wicked things and separate things that harm and and and get away from things that spoil and he's the cleanser in other words he frees from wickedness he guides from faults and mistakes he washes away every fear he washes away the world that's the that's the role that the head should have he shouldn't be someone that strikes fear right in the heart of his wife and his children like dad's home right and and you say that we kind of chuckle a little bit but you know there's people that the sound of a garage door opening is a trigger and I'm not being ridiculous because they can Rec they and growing up they knew that when Dad got home from work the atmosphere would change in a really really bad way and everybody's uptight and everybody's nervous because the way that he uh uh the way that he conducts himself and yet the husband ought to be one that would relieve that stress he's a giver he's a sanctifier he's a nurturer he's a cleanser he nurtures he feeds he brings up he tenderly cares for He Fosters that's what the idea that's embodied in some of these phrases that are used he's looking out after with tender care that's not that's the body's not doing that to the head the head is doing that to the body in this in this description so when Paul says as Christ uh it gives a man a place in the family which is like the role of Christ in the church now could you agree maybe not all of you collectively but individually as you feel Liberty to say Amen or nod your head or give me the side eye could you agree that when Paul is using this language he places the man in the family in a role which is like Christ relationship to the church or his body now this is where I'd like to acknowledge that this Arrangement can be used to abuse that's right this Arrangement or this a relationship can be used to manipulate because I'm the head and I'm the boss and I'm the master and I that it it can be used in a way to where uh it it lends itself to manipulation and control and abuse and and a lot of negative things but man must be becoming Christlike and I I say it that way because I realize the challenge that we face in being like Christ but there should be some uh evolution in our life where we're becoming Christlike because if not the our evolving stewardship uh can be unscriptural that's right God places Us in relationship to our wives as the head now if we're not becoming more like Christ then as our stewardship evolves it's becoming more and more unscriptural and I say maybe worse not just unscriptural but destructive and and even satanic because a man must lead he must rule he's called To Rule The Bible's showing us very clearly the Bible said a man shall rule he shall give rule be have rule over Thee the Bible says uh and that was the less we learned in the Book of Esther that a man has to rule his home the right way uh man must rule but it has to be done the right way brother says a man without character cannot Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is what fit to rule and it would apply to our relationships where there's a um Authority or headship and I believe this forms the proper inspection of Our Lives when it comes to the Way That We Rule now by men or by man within our relationships and the sermon the message of Grace brother BR says I think we're always hollering about women do right so brother Bram often times is characterized as just balling out women he acknowledges even how uh people characterize him and you listen to the sermons you realize he's very hard on women he acknowledges even a complex that he had and I don't think we should water down or trivialize some of the observations that brother Brandon was making or any of the observations he made but he steps back a little bit here and he says you sons of God men I know you're the stronger Bunch that's right the stronger sex you're over the woman that's true so act like it in other words we can put a lot of pressure on the woman but you know she's the weaker vessel you're the stronger one and yes you're over the woman we acknowledge that you're over the woman but he says act like it don't overpower them so the idea isn't just to over is to overpower and use opportunity or use position or use privilege in a way where I'm going to I'm going to make this work a man should never use opportunity uh privilege power to accomplish something that God wants us to accomplish by his word through humility there there's certain things that God wants to accomplish and we can do it through Power we can do it through popularity and Prestige we can opportunity take advantage and say up I got it I got it but he's given us way to do it by the word and humility he says you you don't overpower them try to take some little girl and ruin her life but be a Son of God he says tell her she's in the wrong and stand like a Son of God so you have to stand like a Son of God that's in your place so that you can bring a woman into her place that's why you need Grace to put your place your foot where you belong in order to get bring that woman back into her right mind again he says but we can't try to overpower and he says she your sister he's reminding us that she may be your wife and they they may be your kids but they're both Gods they're all God they belong to God and you have some stewardship over them and you may be able to by force align them but if you're out of your place they're out of their place right oh yeah the head of uh Christ is God so God Christ the man the family the woman the everything's ly up properly then you get out of your place and you remember wait a minute I'm the boss so I'm going to get them in place and you may accomplish getting everybody in their place under you through Power and through threats and through just brute strength or through culture whatever it might be intimidation and you got them in place but you've only got them out of their place because you're not in your place is everybody with me awesome we can answer for one another in Colossians 3: 19- 21 hopefully I can read this times just read this and then move on here but the way he phrases this I I could get hung up here for a little bit I trust we can take a further step here husbands love your wives this is not unlike what he's already said in Ephesians 5:25 husband love your wives but then he adds the phrase and be not bitter against them so he tells us one thing to do one thing not to do children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing to the Lord fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged here in Colossians you'll find it also in Titus you see it in Ephesians chapter 5 Paul is giving the orders or I'd like to say the charges the marching instructions for the office of a husband and a father he he's given us some very specific things though we might say they're General in uh maybe on this higher level but he's saying to love and to provoke not and he's given us these charges and we can say the husband now in relation to his wife is charged to love his wife says and be not bitter against them and not be harsh or resentful to her that you should love and not be harsh so love without being harsh is what's being encouraged here and they says father uh provoke not so a father is charged with raising his children by godly encouragement and not provoking it says in Ephesians 64 maybe we should just read this first and ye fathers provoke not your children to Wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord so the not comes first but we can say fathers bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and provoke not your children to wrath so it tells the fathers what they're to do they're to raise their children by using godly encouragement to do it in a Godly manner to nurture them and admonish them uh uh in the way of the Lord that the Lord would bring them up the right way now I I want you just to catch this on its face there's this general order that's very positive for husbands to love and to fathers to nurture with the caution against the wrong approach so there's a way that we are related to the wife related to the children and there is a charge that that this office has that the man has to love his wife and to nurture his children but it doesn't just tell you to do that without pour out that the relationship can give rise if it's perverted it can give rise to the wrong approach or the negative you have the positive manifestation of the relationship then you kind of have this uh this weaker sense or this uh Corruption of their leadership love without bitterness to bring up without provoking he's addressing even a natural tendency or corruption in these relationships that a husband has the head can be harsh that that's a that's a sinful tendency that as as recognizing being the head or the The Strain that can come in that and the responsibility that comes with that there can be this resentment there can be this hard hardness that comes even that contempt we talk about so he says love that's what you ought to do that's positive and watch out for bitterness love without getting Bitter Love without being hard love without being harsh Love Without overpowering Love without trying to uh Force into a particular way and also bring up nurture encourage your children because you've got to do it the right way because if you don't if you're upset if you're frustrated if you're impatient you just so anger to them so he's kind of addressing the the Dark Side of leadership where it becomes hard and overpowering and insensitive now in Matthew chapter 20: 25 to 28 I think it's just wonderful that brother Jason Watkins when he was here was addressing these very things and the continuity that it had with the things that we were ministering on I appreciated that just myself personally it's encouraging and it says now but Jesus called them unto him and we'll look at this in another place I think here in a little bit where it gives us some more background he says you know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them so within the the Gentile culture you look out amongst the Gentiles and you have princes that use the phrase exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise Authority upon them now catch what he's saying in this verse verse 25 do you see the Gentiles who do not have the word do not have the law do not have a relationship with God that the great exercise Authority upon and the the princes exercise dominion over so he's he's identifying a particular way of leadership particular Arrangement and the way that people relate to princes and and uh people relate to Authority and then he makes this statement in verse 26 but it shall not be so among you now that's quite a statement because he's in one way we just look at and say well there's a dominion and there is Authority and there is structure and there is headship and there are arrangements and and a proper alignment but he says that the Gentiles exercise dominion and Authority the wrong way in other words they claim superiority over others the es uh exercise dominion over the Gentiles claiming to be superior they Lord over those who are under them because he says they exercise Authority upon them and over them they Lord over them as being they're beneath them they're below them and the the great ones are over them you see this it's an attitude that the princes have it's an attitude that the Great have that because of power and because of wealth and because of a lineage or whatever I'm greater you're you're you're less we're more powerful and he says but that's not the way it should be among you amen this isn't the way that it ought to be he says but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you now calling back to the princes and those that are great amongst the Gentiles he say now uh in this Kingdom it's different whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister in the Lord's House in his kingdom let the Chief the greatest be your minister which is let him be your servant CU in the Gentile Kingdom you'd have the Lords and the Surfs you'd have the Lords and all those that serve and you'd have the peasants and and you'd have a way that it's it it's described to where well we just serve him he's the one that owns the land and and we just look out after it for him and we owe him this and we owe him that that's not the way it is the one who's the greatest the land owner in that sense would be the servant I own this land and I can give it to you and you can use it and and we can make sure that it's free from enemies and we'll watch out over you and we'll do all sorts of things to protect you the economy and protect the region and protect your land it's it's one of these ideas that I'm here a as the owner because you need to be taken care of and and I want to look out after you and I want to protect you and it's not the other way around so let him be your servant and whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant so the Great and the chief the first the preeminent now he gives us the even as portion even as the son of man as Paul said even as Christ even as Christ even as the Lord even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many the chief is the one who's first in rank the one that has the highest influence and the greatest honor he's the one that's to be the servant even as the son of man which is Christ even as Christ is not the head to be served but to serve he's the head not to be to to to receive but to give I think a little some time ago in the last few Services we kind of asked the question is if is Christ the head and we all agreed and I said now which one of you serve him better or more than he serves you and we kind of all went yeah that's a trick question I and it's true he the head has done more for us than we could ever do for him that's kind of what births the beautiful Mutual dependency that we would have to him is because of what he's given and how he's lived and how secure we are in his love I saying I the son of man I do not exercise Dominion or exercise authority over those that are in my house if anything he exercise this Dominion control of authority over those that would harm the house that would come against the house it's those that He cast out it's those that he spoke would uh would subdue and and bring subject but to his house he would nurture he would ser serve brother brandom the sermon thirsting for life and he uses it thirsting for life as a a sermon even in different years when he preached and he touched on these things he says speak to the woman her place is home that's it here she's supposed to be at home and we could all just like right we like that highlight it stop there take the name of Jesus with right let's all go home he said he's he's showing that but he says and Mister you might call yourself ever so good but if you've got lodges and other things ah I love it when he says other things because we might say I don't go to a lodge but you know what there's other things he says that call you away from her at night on you ought to be ashamed of yourself if you have okay I'm not going to a lodge but if you have other things that keep you out of the house in the evenings if you've been at work all day long or maybe you work from home and you're in your dungeon all day long and you you come out to go out right he says if you have other things that call you away you ought to be ashamed of yourself this is and you can say well brother Aaron don't lean too hard into that because you can take this out of context well you just think about it a little bit I'll just I'll just read it to you and you think about it God gave you a home to cherish and comfort and things like that you have you have a home to cherish you have a you have a home to comfort now brother B I'm saying this in the way we recognize that the home's to be a comfort to the man and the home's to cherish the man and there kind of like this Synergy that's to go this Dynamo that's supposed to be working he says when a man leaves the home to go find to go cherish other things and give attention to other things and he forsakes his home you should be ashamed God gave you a home to cherish a home to comfort things like that and it's a shame to see the way men does their wives and wives do men he says the Womanhood and fatherhood of the nation is tore to Pieces divorce courts piled full because the man isn't attendant upon his duty he has the other things a and other things he enjoys and things he needs and way ways that he wants to be benefited and he think he's only thinking of himself and doing that called away from the home Time After Time After Time and he says you should be ashamed of yourself because a man's place and and and I guess uh maybe I should take some more time on this he's saying the Woman's Place is in the home but how could that ever be her place if the man's not in it too right you say A Woman's Place is in the kitchen and and and you know that's a phrase that's kind of used more maybe more jokingly than literally anymore but you know what goods the kitchen if the man's not there what what good's the home if the man's not there the man has to have that place mister if you've got other things that are calling you away from your post- of Duty you should be ashamed because you've got a home you need to cherish you have a wife you need to take care of and comfort he says it's a shame to see what a man does to his wife by forsaking his duty because the man just doesn't exercise Dominion he doesn't just exercise Authority he's just not the head of the house and I work all day so I can go out and do these things he is a servant to the family in Matthew chapter 23 we'll read uh to verse verses 1 to 12 I think we're doing okay on time says then spake Jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples saying the scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses's seat that's quite a statement they have authority legal Authority all therefore whatsoever they bid You observe that observe and do now this he's saying that those who are in Authority do what they say is that not what he's saying he he's saying that they the scribes and Pharisees whatever they tell you to do and whatever they tell you to observe you do but he says because they're in Authority this is how this is what's established in the structure that exist within uh within their tradition he says but do not ye after their works for they say and do not now just as uh just as Jesus kind of called out the way the Gentiles work he's saying and your model within our Jewish Tradition now in the nation of Israel we've got it kind of backwards too because the Gentiles ex Dominion exercise dominion over and Authority upon he says now you're being told to do things and you ought to do it but you know notice those who are in Authority how it's been corrupted because they say and do not do and what does that tell us the best way that a man can lead is by example it's the best way he can lead is by being an example instead of telling the people what to do you show them what to do that's why a a pastor should be the husband of one wife so you don't have to tell them to be the husband of one wife you just show them that's what you're supposed to do he says for they say and do not for they bind heavy burdens and Grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders look at this this is the wrong kind of leadership the wrong kind of this would be the wrong way to pastor this would be the wrong way to be a scribe or Pharisee wrong way to be a husband wrong way to be a father you bind heavy burdens and Grievous things to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not even move them with one of their fingers just all put it all on the people put it all on the wife put it all on the children says but all their Works they do for to be seen of men so there's the heavy the these laboring things these burdensome things they put on the people but where do they labor where do they spend their time what is it they're concerned about Optics popularity a little bit of pretense everything they do they' be seen of mean they make broad their felies and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uppermost rooms at the feast and the chief seats in the synagogues ingredients in the markets and to be called of men Rabbi Rabbi right they they like the idea that they sit in Moses seat they they're drunk on their own crowns they there there's a there's they're drunk on this power and they get caught up in that that this is what a man is and this is what it means to be a husband and this is what it means to be a dad and a father and a and a real man and a pastor whatever a minister and and you start reading this you realize yeah you know sometimes we're guilty of kind of carving out the elites and we carve out the ministers and they sit on the platform a A or they sit at their own tables and they always get to eat first and you wonder why they always way too much or you know there's just a way that we kind of just honor and L and and we separate them out and in a way you create this dichotomy in this structure to where you have those that exercise dominion over and we're no longer in it together right you're just the Surfs he says but be not called Rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye are Brethren that's one of the most important things we need to recognize we're we're brothers we're sisters he said that your wife she's your sister this isn't one greater and and one's more important in that Gentile sense he says we're all together we're Brethren and and call no man your father upon the Earth for one is your father which is in heaven like what what what do the Catholics do with that he you he says he's not saying that's not what he's saying that's what they're saying right some some oddom CL like that however you use it to get out of it but he says and neither be ye called Masters for one is your master even Christ but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and it completely is a paradigm shift of what the Gentiles do and what the Jews do because you have these kingdoms but now in our Kingdom In My Kingdom he's saying he that is greatest is going to be your ministry he's going to be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted he that is greatest let him be the minister so if someone's a minister it's not to be served they're declaring that they ought to be the one with the burden to serve a minister is not the one that I say myself I'm a minister and I'm a minister because you guys serve me or minister to me no it's exactly the opposite right that if it never came my way my calling is to serve you if I never got any feedback if I never got an encouragement if I always had to go home look in the mirror say raise your hand pat yourself on the back if that's what I had to do every Sunday afternoon I still have to stay faithful to my calling to serve and to serve because it's not about me it's not about my ego it's not about my pride it's not about my uh what makes me look good I have to have and I'm saying this uh openly in public so that you can hold me accountable if my actions are ever contrary to this I've got to keep you in mind and your health in mind in Minister and serve you and I believe and F with all my heart that if I do that part right I don't have to worry about your part that you will turn encourage me and it's worked that way my family and are constantly encouraged by you and supported by you and made to feel uh um a part of you and if we can keep that Focus right that we're servants one to another we're brothers and sisters in Christ and we don't get topheavy then we can make we can be healthy and I think the responsibility begins with the head as Jesus is identifying both in the Gentiles and now even with the Jews that there's this wrong kind of attitude of you know I sit in Moses seat so you guys need to do this and you guys need to do that and you guys need to do this and it's just binding the people so much and he's over there saying and they won't even lift their finger to do any of that but they they do a lot of things to make themselves look good publicly and that's what they focus on is making themselves look different seemingly not having the same burdens as everybody else and he said that's not how it ought to be let the greatest serve let them Minister the sermon thinking man's filter says the Bible is speaking in Ephesians the women seeing she reverence her husband reverence her husband and we're like yeah end it there brother Aaron it's 11:15 moving on then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a Son of God so it's kind of showing he says yeah the woman has to reverence her husband but why make it so hard for her right right why why make it to where she just has to keep reading her Bible every day see that you re your husband God help me reverence my husband God please help me reverence my husband and that's her biggest burden is I I can't respect him and I can't have it's so hard for me to reverence him it's so hard and he said well make it easy on her make it easy on the the wife by making Christ your head by living such a life to where she could reverence you as a Son of God and if he doesn't live that kind of life now I don't now be careful here he says well then of course she wouldn't reverence him because she knows what he's made of of but he's not saying you shouldn't reverence some right he's just saying you wouldn't you're like now you're just being a lawyer and you know I am but that's not what I'm doing he's just saying it makes sense yes if you're running off to lodges and other things at night and abandoning the home that you've been given to cherish and care for and things like that and comfort then she's like I can't have respect for that now she ought to reverence her husband but you've made it really hard on her to do it so he says she knows what he's made of but when a when it's a man that is reverent man reverent and clean kind of I can kind of notice his language doesn't escape me a woman should reverence her husband and I said but if he's a reverent man just brings it out of her God made the man the woman to bring out whatever the man swws into her that's just the way that he ordained it in the very beginning we knew this is how God had arranged them and so when the man is reverent he SS reverence into her and that's what he gets in return but when a man that is reverent and clean with his wife and before his family a real servant of God then the women children and all should respect that servant of God with reverence so in one place he says if you're not living the life you wouldn't be reverenced he's saiding it's really hard for that to happen but he comes back and says if he's living the right kind of Life he's now it's a challenge to those who who maybe aren't reverence he says you should respect that you should give r and and I I believe that Bear's saying here on both sides that if the woman's to be reverent to the man and she's not then that doesn't give a man license to not love her it doesn't give him license to not nourish and Char it doesn't give him license to run off to The Lodges and other things and here if the man is not reverent and the man isn't clean he doesn't live the right kind of life it doesn't give the wife license to ridicule him doesn't give her license to shame him and to lead say well my husband H's my husband's not spiritual my husband's ignorant my husband's this my husband's that and and I'm more spiritual than my husband and I got a better understand of the message and I'm more holy and I pray more and I I lead the children in prayer and I do this and I do that it's kind of like the the woman the woman the woman the woman she's the one that's leading and and she has this attitude towards her husband you realize with that kind of attitude the man will never take his place I mean because this is what it looks like the man should be the head of the home and the woman's going to say you get in your place right now he's like yes I look at me I'm the head right it's like my my brother had a voicemail prompt one time on Verizon he said warning a woman's about to tell you what to do and next thing you hear is a woman saying please leave a message after the tone right and a lot of us our GPS tells us it's a woman telling us turn here stop there turn around and we're just kind of used to it we go home and the wife tells us what to do we're like y That's and there's a way that we we can't we can't properly assume headship if the woman's snapping her fingers and say take the lead right how does that work now I I'm calling out an obvious Dynamic that exists within some of our relationships when families get a little bit cold and they're not in the Rhythm that they ought to be in a and and it creates this coldness and this Chasm to where the man doesn't feel like he has the respect that he needs in order to operate in that capacity and sometimes a man through his sincerity is reluctant to assume that role because it's going to look as if he's either being told or he's overpowering and men have to have the grace to be able to assume that and step into their place and women we they we they them women yans the Royal the women need to have a sensitivity to say Lord I want my husband to take that place but I can't demand it I can't create the wrong kind of of environment and I need to yield and pray and just as him being reverence coaxes reverence out of me maybe if I yield and I pray it'll bring out Ser the the the servitude of a husband the servitude of a father because that's what a man is called to do a man is called to pick up the woman and put her in her place not stand off to the side and point and say you get here and if there's a way that you yield and pray you're actually mirroring something that's within him to yield and to serve to get beneath because a real man of God is going to oh God help me to say it the right way he's able to get lower than the woman and pick her up and she's not the one that needs to stoop the lowest to lift everything up you're the one at the end of the day that can get the lowest to pick it up I think that uh I hope I hope that you're listening to that now can we take an anonymous poll maybe somehow I just I'm torn here and and whether or not I should just stop at this go forward don't say anything don't nod I'm not even looking at you this isn't I'm not pandering was that was awfully quiet Luke chap 22: 22- 27 I can go through this at a reasonable pace and be done here soon now this is this is looking back even to what was happening in Matthew chapter 20 because it's uh he's going to he's going to use the same language and you'll recognize the companionship of this and there was also Strife among them the disciples which of them should be accounted the greatest they're they're they're arguing amongst each other who's better who's greater I wish they would spent more time telling us but obviously maybe it's it's in maybe some of these disciples best interest not to tell us and he said unto them the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them who's the greatest and they're talking I'm I'm the greatest you're no I think you're the greatest he says and so he kind of says where does this what is this attitude like this is an attitude of people who are unhinged from headship themselves the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise Authority upon them are called benefactors right cuz what does it flow up to they are it's uh they are the beneficiaries you serve me is what he's saying but ye shall not be so this is not the way it shall be for you disciples this is not the way it is in my kingdom but he that is greatest among you let him be as the youngero right because don't we always really talk about the elders you know I'm an elder you listen to me I'm your boss right this is the way he says but you know let the one who's greatest let him be younger and he that is Chief as he that doth serve this is totally different and I'm using these as a as a way to point to the rule of a man has to mirror this as the man who is the chief the greatest in the head he is to be as the younger he is to be the one that serves for whether is greater he that sth at meat or he that serveth is not he that sth at meat but I am among you is he that serveth and the way he's saying well who is it that's greater at a table the one that's eating or the one that's serving they like well the one that's eating he gets the steak all right he's the one that's eating he says okay all right and I'm the one serving and what does he say that to do for them to be like oh oh just because I'm the one eating wait a minute I wouldn't be eating if you weren't serving wait a minute you're the greatest you're the one this is the way it is in God's Kingdom in Mark chapter 9: 33 to uh maybe we'll just read to verse 33 he says and he come to capernum and being in the house I just love that image because our series is called the house of the Lord here the Lord is in the house and they've been arguing along the way about who's the greatest and he says uh what is it that you guys were arguing about on our way here they're kind of like oh nothing yeah and he says they held their peace for by the way they had disputed among themselves who should be the greatest they're arguing about who's the best who's the greatest who's the strongest who has the most and and Jesus says so what were you guys arguing about and they're kind of like arguing to were we arguing Thomas I wasn't arguing were you huh and Judas is over there going don't look at me right everybody's pointing fingers and he so he sits down nobody says he sits down and he calls the 12 under them and he says if If any man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and servant of all so you realize he's just given him a way to settle the argument who's the greatest the one that serves the most you want to be the greatest serve with all that's in your heart be the last of all be the servant of all in other words if you're you're not the greatest because you can win a game of King of the Hill you're not the greatest because you're stronger because you're smarter because you're older because you've been in it longer you're not the greatest because of all these other things you're great because you've become the servant what is it brother brandham teaches us it came up within our family devotion last night uh one of the children mentioned that brother bam said that a great man makes you feel great a and what makes him a great man the fact that he makes you feel great right that that's really what makes him great a man who has power and that's what he is he's a powerful man he's going to make you feel his power a man that's wealthy that he's going to make you feel that he's wealthy but a man that's great is one despite wealth and power and popularity and everything else he makes you feel great a good man makes you feel good whereas a rich man will make you feel poor and a strong man will make you feel weak a great man will make you feel great if any man desire to be first then just be the servant of all be the last of all and I'll end with this and this will I'm going to use this maybe to segue into Wednesday night next Sunday there's lot that I I I wanted to go this route to close but he says sanctify them Jesus speaking now sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth so this Christ whose head is God the supplication of God sanctify them through truth as thou Hast sent me into the world even so have I sent them into the world now here is the headship of Christ to the body they're going to be sent out into the world and they're going forth to minister they're going forth to serve and he says for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth here's one in in in a responsibility that as a head he's asking that those he's leading be Sanctified but he doesn't step out of the way in the sense of so just if you could sanctify them he says I've Sanctified myself he recognizes that if there's going to be a sanctification to those he's leading he himself needs to be Sanctified so I sanctify myself that that they might also be Sanctified let us not use the excuse that we're older uh that we have the Holy Ghost to live UNS Sanctified lives and demand it of our 16year olds who don't even have the Holy Ghost that's right no we can have all sorts of nonsense going on in our lives because you know I'm the man I know how to handle my drugs right I know how to handle my liquor but you young man you shouldn't drink that that it just doesn't work that way he says if I want my home to be Sanctified right if I want my children to be Sanctified if I want to have a a home that's right then this is to me this is the example of the head being a giver and a sanctifier of the body a sanctifier of the wife and the children Christ can be a sanctifier because he Sanctified himself Christ can be a cleanser because he cleansed himself and brother Bram says in God's wrapped G gift he says I think one of the most pathetic words that Jesus ever said was when he said father I sanctify myself that they might be Sanctified quite a statement he says it's pathetic and then he kind of highlights if I could say this before we read this in other words as a man he could do whatever he wanted as a man he had opportunity and power and maybe even the right to indulge and to enjoy certain things but he recognized his role and his responsibility and in light of that great responsibility there's things that he did and did not do in order for those that he was leading in other words he had a right he was a man he had a right to a home he had a right to a family he was a man as much as you are or I am as much a human in his manhood as we are he had a right to it I think there's just this incredible Paradox how that he had a right to those things and Sanctified himself and denied him the privilege of those things so that we could exercise our right role and control in those very [Music] things that if he had somehow was able to marry and have a family I tell you what it would have been a perfect family but you would have never been able to achieve it yourself because in order for you to be in your place he had to do his part he had a right but then notice the statement that he makes he had a right to it but he was training 12 men that we going to take the gospel to all the world so he Sanctified himself for their sake I sanc myself for their sake a gift of God keeping himself Sanctified why because he was training someone he was Raising somebody up they were going to one day leave his training and go into the world and do likewise he said that was what a gift of God did he kept himself Sanctified and with him sanctification we know required sacrifice for us sanctification requires sacrifice and I'll just I'm going to skip I am just going to go ahead and skip things but let me just refer to it a father is a priest of the home so he must be Sanctified first as the headen and let me put it this way if we could say this musicians if you'd come if we could say it this way men our duty first our duty first not to demand reverence from our wives but I have a duty to be reverent not to demand submission from our wise but I have a duty to love not to demand obedience from our children but I have a duty to encourage to nourish my duty first let me say this a clean man is the best way to keep the family clean we sanctify ourselves that they might be Jesus said these words I sanctify myself that they might be Sanctified through the truth and then Paul comes later and he says let a man love his wife love even her as his own body and a man nourishes and cherishes himself Christ Sanctified his own body and he he's given us this image and how did Christ ever how did he even begin he Sanctified himself in the sermon the way of a true Prophet brother bam says a real man or woman that's born of the spirit of God will set hour after hour drinking in the word of God wait a minute what am I skipping for we're in the after hour a real man or woman that's born of the spirit of God will set hour after hour dream thinking in the word of God and then I love this part not only that you know some people just like to itch their ears with message theology he says but not only that but when it hits there it anchors and changes the life a real man or woman that's born of the spirit of God will listen to the word and the word can hit here and anchor and change their life so he says it's our people's desires our whole setup's corrupted and decayed it's our people's wants he says you take a good good man a good man put him in a family that's a bunch of pleasure lovers they'll lead that man a dog's life or good woman either one put them in a family that's mixed up it's out of order it's chaotic things aren't in the proper alignment he says take a good man or a good woman you put him in the wrong kind of family Dynamic he said to lead a dog's life he'll become corrupted they'll lead that man a dog's life because the family order isn't right this is exactly what he's saying a good man in the wrong place in the wrong in his in the wrong atmosphere in the wrong home good kids really good kids can be uh rough necks and delinquents and and bullies and all sorts of things and we're like man that kid just got a mean streak and that kid this man that kid that we're all we're all can't wait till the kid can just go to college somewhere else right and you realize the it's he's a product of his home he's a good kid at heart good women at heart even h a good men but in a home that's mixed up we lead dog lives and then he makes this beautiful statement why the whole family should surrender to God it's our business men take this me my duty first it's our business to pray till our children are saved keep our house in order if I can say this way it's our business to keep our house in order and I can't stand off out of place and all disjointed over here and like I know I'm out of my place but you need to get in your place I need to take my place and it's my business to keep the house in order it's in my business to pray till the children Sav don't stop praying until they're saved we can should continue to believe and speak a language that's positive whether it be about our spouses whether it be about our children be positive believe all things are possible but do as it says here drink the word of God and let let it hit anchor and change your life change your desires so that we can be in the right place to affect others and I hope this doesn't stand too far out of place as we close on this this image Christ the head the chief the greatest the rabbi the master and he says you call me master he says you've said well because that's exactly what I am but as he was coming to the end as he had Sanctified himself as he had denied himself as he was coming to fulfill his calling as a lamb to give his life they're sitting down they're partaking in dinner and the Bible says in John Chapter 13 he rose from supper laid aside his garments and no she's stripping himself in this act of humility say that I will not be judged by how I dress I will not be judged by any Any Garment that may suggest I'm a master that may suggest I'm a rabbi I'm going to lay myself be so that you see me as a man and he took a towel inured himself and he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel that he had girded himself with this is the man in the home at a table if at that very moment those that Judas had uh conspired with had arrived into this room to seize the Messiah and at that very moment Christ was kneeling with the towel GED about him washing someone's feet they would have never considered the foot washed flunky who was kneeling before a basin they would have looked at the man whose feet were being washed they would have looked for the man at the head of the table not the one serving not the one kneeling to me this affords to us the greatest example of what it means to be the greatest is we're willing to kneel and to perform the duty of washing it wasn't Christ who made those feet dirty it wasn't necessarily his own biddings and his own leading and Direction perhaps it made those feet dirty but he took responsibility for washing their feet as the head and I believe that's the role and responsibility that the man of the home has is to be the one that can kneel and to wash his wife's feet to serve his children it's in the man of the home a clean man is the best way to have a clean home I acknowledge the uh I don't want to say the loftiness of this but I I acknowledge the High Calling um someone was testifying to me that you know after hearing these Services you go home and you're you're you're so busy analyzing and scrutinizing your own lives you don't have time to talk and gossip about other people and I actually felt kind of bad if it's if it's coming out so challenging to where there's no encouragement in it but let me say it this way this is this is who you are yes this is what you can do no matter how much you've been told no matter how much the example's been the opposite God has called you and equipped you as men you feel it in you you know this is what you're called to if you maybe you don't feel that you're good this at this maybe you don't feel you're good at that but as the man God is equipping you God has put this in you God wants to bring it out of you and there's so much that the the world and situations and circumstances try to Bow us down like well I can never recover I can never do this I can never be reverenced I can never take the spiritual lead yes you can and and maybe the way that you say you can't is the wrong image that you feel that you have to get rid of that idea of being the strong Burly man who presents himself to the family as I'm the head everybody kneel and pray it's time for devotions but find a way just to get beneath everybody else and and lead by example and steering them in the right direction and begin just as brother brandham did without opening his mouth and laying hands on his wife and Away rebuke this evil spirit and I'm going to take control of this home in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he just begin to contact he begin to serve he begin to Humble himself he said the atmosphere changed it's in us as men to lead just as much as it's in our sisters to submit or to follow or to reverent therefore we call to that which God has already placed inside of us and say Lord make me the man that I'm supposed to be I want to be this kind of man not one that's flipping over tables and the temple or the one that's walking on water but I want to be the one who can kneel before even his own disciples and the one he's training and leading and say I've Sanctified myself so that you can be sanctified not in a self-righteous Manner and say well you know look what I'm giving up but this acknowledgement recognition that I love you I love you for who you are what God's called you to be and all the potential that's in you and I want you to I want you to know the blessedness that I have I want you to be free I want you to be pleasing to the Lord and out of love I can humble myself and sanctify myself and nurture and cherish and do all these things that I know I ought to do because it's in me and I want you to succeed I think it's a beautiful picture I should just stop there could you stand today with me
