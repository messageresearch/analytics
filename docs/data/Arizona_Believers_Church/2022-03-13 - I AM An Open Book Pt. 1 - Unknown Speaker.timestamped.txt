[0:00] john chapter 5
[0:01] verses 30 to 40.
[0:04] i have uh i think i accidentally noted
[0:06] just to verse 39 on the slides and then
[0:08] even later i might actually just have it
[0:11] noted to verse 39 but it is going to be
[0:14] um john chapter 5 verses 30 to verse
[0:19] 40.
[0:21] and i make i'll make some comments now
[0:23] um
[0:25] before we've been reading my title is i
[0:28] am
[0:28] an open book
[0:30] and as you pondered that phrase as you
[0:33] pondered that title
[0:35] there is a clear indication speaking
[0:38] about the i am
[0:40] and then also i want you to think about
[0:42] who you are
[0:45] john chapter 5 verse 30 i can of my own
[0:48] self do nothing as i hear i judge and my
[0:51] judgment is just
[0:53] because i seek not my own will but the
[0:54] will of the father which hath sent me if
[0:57] i bear witness of myself my witness is
[0:59] not true
[1:00] there is
[1:01] another that beareth with witness of me
[1:04] and i know that that that the witness
[1:06] which he witnesseth of me is true
[1:09] he sent unto john and he bear witness
[1:11] under the truth but i receive not
[1:12] testimony from man but these things i
[1:15] say that ye might be saved
[1:17] he was a burning and shining light and
[1:19] you were willing for a season to rejoice
[1:20] in his light but i have a greater
[1:23] witness than that of john for the works
[1:25] which the father hath given me to finish
[1:26] the same works that i do bear witness of
[1:28] me that the father hath sent me
[1:30] and the father himself which has sent me
[1:32] hath born witness of me you have neither
[1:35] heard his voice at any time they're seen
[1:37] as shape
[1:38] and ye have not his word abiding in you
[1:39] for whom you he hath set
[1:41] him you believe not search the
[1:43] scriptures from them you think you have
[1:45] eternal life and they are they which
[1:48] testify of me
[1:49] and you will not come to me that you
[1:51] might have life
[1:53] god bless you you can be seated
[1:57] consider this title i am
[1:59] in laying some foundational things i am
[2:02] an open book if you turn with me to
[2:05] exodus chapter 3 this is where i'd like
[2:06] to start this morning exodus chapter 3
[2:08] verse 14.
[2:10] this is god speaking unto moses
[2:13] and it says and god said unto moses i am
[2:16] that i am
[2:17] and he said thus shalt thou say unto the
[2:19] children of israel i am have sent me
[2:22] unto you i know that we're all familiar
[2:25] with this phrase and i know that in
[2:26] touching on these things in the outset
[2:28] it's things that we're already very
[2:30] conscious of very aware of so it's not
[2:32] breaking new territory but i do want you
[2:34] to ponder this phrase i am that i am and
[2:38] then he says to let the children of
[2:40] israel know i am hath sent me unto you
[2:43] in our english language that might seem
[2:45] to be a very peculiar phrase this has
[2:47] very very deep meaning and significance
[2:49] to a hebrew
[2:51] and to say i am that i am i just want to
[2:53] take some time to kind of amplify that
[2:55] phrase i am who i am i will be who i
[2:58] want to be
[2:59] he's saying i am that i am this is the
[3:01] person of god
[3:03] this is the self-existing one the i am
[3:06] that i am is the being of beings
[3:08] and when god says this and he uses this
[3:10] language to describe himself i am that i
[3:13] am and tell the children of israel that
[3:15] i am
[3:16] i am hath sent me unto you
[3:19] it's god declaring himself as eternal is
[3:22] god declaring himself as immutable god
[3:24] declaring himself to has existed at all
[3:26] times and will to never cease to exist
[3:29] to say i am that i am i am who i am it's
[3:31] to say i am past present and future
[3:34] i am what i am presently
[3:36] but i am what i have been
[3:38] and i am what i shall be and i shall be
[3:40] what i am
[3:42] that's what he's declaring i am what i
[3:44] am presently i have been what i have
[3:46] been i will but will i shall be and i
[3:48] shall be what i am i'm unchanging i will
[3:51] be
[3:52] brother abraham says from i am he was
[3:54] the i am and i am is everlasting it's
[3:57] eternal not i was i will be but i am
[4:00] present tense all ages the same
[4:03] yesterday today and forever
[4:05] i am and for him to say i am what i
[4:07] shall be and i shall be what i am this
[4:09] is what's represented in this phrase i
[4:12] am that i am the the word m in the
[4:16] hebrew is hayah which means to be or to
[4:18] become
[4:20] it means to come to pass or to exist or
[4:22] to happen so we say i am it's in the
[4:24] same sense
[4:26] it's a condition i am it's to be i exist
[4:29] i've come to pass to become known
[4:31] and it's from this phrase that they get
[4:34] jehovah
[4:35] the word i think we've touched on this
[4:37] in the past
[4:38] it comes from this word
[4:40] which means he is the eternal
[4:42] self-existing one who will become what
[4:45] he is
[4:46] he's the becoming god i am so this is
[4:49] what i am i'm something i'm essential to
[4:52] my character there's something about me
[4:53] there's attributes but it's i am not i
[4:55] was not even what i will be but i am
[4:58] because i will be what i am that will
[4:59] never change
[5:01] and and this is connected with jehovah
[5:03] because in the next verse exodus chapter
[5:05] 3 verse 15 it says and god said moreover
[5:07] unto moses thou shalt thus shalt thou
[5:10] say unto the children of israel the lord
[5:12] god of your fathers the god of abraham
[5:14] the god of isaac the god of jacob hath
[5:16] sent me unto you this is my name forever
[5:19] and this is my moral unto all
[5:20] generations the lord jehovah god elohim
[5:24] jehovah elohim this is the i am this is
[5:27] what god is expressing to moses i am
[5:30] that i am this is the lord god jehovah
[5:33] elohim and so we know who the i am is
[5:38] it's god himself
[5:40] it is the one that existed before time
[5:42] in john 1 1 in the beginning was the
[5:43] word and we know that that word is god
[5:46] that god is his word this is who the i
[5:49] am is
[5:51] now that's uh that i think it kind of
[5:53] helps preface we're breaking down maybe
[5:55] just the title i realize now uh this is
[5:58] probably a way just to kind of uh put
[6:00] this that is the i am in the i am an
[6:03] open book now let's ponder this this
[6:05] idea of an open book
[6:07] in first corinthians chapter 13 verse 12
[6:11] paul says for now we see through a glass
[6:14] darkly
[6:15] but then face to face
[6:17] now i know in part but then shall i know
[6:20] even as also i am known now there's a
[6:24] now we see through a glass darkly now i
[6:26] know in part and then those are
[6:28] companion phrases but then face to face
[6:32] then shall i know even as also i am
[6:35] known this is
[6:36] i've been pondering this scripture and
[6:38] have many things to share from it but i
[6:40] want to just take a very uh
[6:42] narrow thought right now is how he says
[6:44] for now we see through a glass darkly to
[6:47] see through a glass the word that is
[6:49] represented there the image that is
[6:50] represented would be a mirror
[6:53] now we see in a mirror but ancient
[6:55] mirrors were made of polished metals
[6:57] and so you wouldn't get an exact perfect
[7:00] reflection
[7:01] now i'm seeing through a gla through a
[7:03] mirror and this mirror is a partial
[7:06] reflection because he says now i know in
[7:07] part i'm seeing impart i'm not seeing
[7:09] the full complete picture and he's and
[7:12] he uses this phrase to describe what
[7:14] he's looking at in the glass so he's not
[7:17] questioning the reality of what he's
[7:19] looking at he's not questioning the
[7:20] truth of what he's looking at
[7:22] or the existence of it but he's just
[7:24] recognizing that in this glass he says
[7:27] it's darkly
[7:29] and it literally means in enigma
[7:32] we're looking and that's the word that
[7:33] is used and exactly what it means an
[7:35] enigma is a person or thing that is
[7:36] mysterious an enigma is something that
[7:39] is a puzzling or difficult to understand
[7:42] you ever heard of what an enigma is
[7:44] and so an enigma is a statement which
[7:46] conceals a hidden meaning or a statement
[7:49] or something that conceals something
[7:50] that's known uh that conceals something
[7:52] that's a known thing
[7:54] uh that is hidden under obscure words or
[7:57] or some other form that's what it means
[7:59] for something to be enigma paul said
[8:01] right now i see through a glass darkly
[8:04] what i'm looking at i know it's there
[8:06] but i'm i don't fully understand it
[8:08] there's things that are hidden there's
[8:09] things that are concealed and it's
[8:12] obscured under certain forms so to say
[8:14] that i see through a glass darkly i see
[8:17] even an enigma it's an obscure thing
[8:19] it's a riddle
[8:20] even in the
[8:21] the greek it says an enigma a riddle
[8:24] this is a riddle to me uh where i'm
[8:26] still trying to understand the full
[8:27] meaning and rep what it represents
[8:30] so to contrast that now i'm seeing an
[8:32] image and it's a riddle to me it's
[8:34] obscure it's not perfectly clear
[8:37] it says but then face to face
[8:39] then shall i know even also
[8:42] i am known face to face means with
[8:44] clarity then
[8:45] if on one hand it's darkly
[8:47] to say that he sees face to face is to
[8:49] recognize distinctly
[8:52] and and we can immediately begin to just
[8:54] think in the natural when you see
[8:55] something face to face you come face to
[8:57] face with something
[8:59] it's in its reality form you you can
[9:01] it's not just an image or a reflection
[9:03] and paul is certainly he's wanting us to
[9:05] consider that that now i'm seeing in a
[9:07] mirror darkly it's an enigma it's a
[9:09] puzzle but then it's going to be clear
[9:11] and when he says face to face and i
[9:13] shall know even also as i am known it's
[9:15] in the sense of removing the mystery
[9:18] to be able to look at something and
[9:20] appreciate it and know it and see it for
[9:22] what it is
[9:24] and now not to trigger people who hated
[9:27] their
[9:28] uh english classes or literature classes
[9:30] in high school or college i wanted to
[9:31] quote from romeo and juliet
[9:34] brother shakespeare
[9:36] uh in
[9:38] in this it's uh
[9:40] uh juliet's mother that makes this
[9:42] statement but it to me it just uh
[9:45] and i had to kind of stop reading it
[9:46] because like wow you could start
[9:47] bringing out a lot of types here but i
[9:49] only i just wanted to express this one
[9:51] aspect of seeing something face to face
[9:54] and notice this is a common uh this
[9:57] would be a common thing and maybe it
[9:58] seems to be an odd reference to trying
[10:00] to make this point but i it's to get
[10:02] this concept of reading something
[10:04] looking into something and seeing
[10:06] something
[10:07] and so juliet's mother lady capulet says
[10:09] read or the volume which is a book read
[10:12] the book read the volume of young
[10:14] paris's face and find a light writ there
[10:16] with beauty's pen examine every married
[10:19] liniment and see how one another lends
[10:22] content and they talk about the lines of
[10:24] someone's face where lines are joined
[10:26] the the car the uh the visage the image
[10:30] the countenance of this one and it says
[10:31] and what obscured
[10:33] in this fair volume lies find written in
[10:35] the margin of his eyes it's described in
[10:38] a book
[10:39] look into the volume or the book of his
[10:41] face and and look at the lines how they
[10:44] laid and then what seems to be obscure
[10:46] or hidden or there's enigma
[10:48] in this book find it written in the
[10:50] margin
[10:51] it's alluding to something that would be
[10:53] explained it's there you you read
[10:55] something i don't know what that means
[10:56] but there's a footnote there's something
[10:57] written
[10:58] today it would be a footnote but even
[11:00] then they wrote explanatory phrases in
[11:02] the margin saying read the book look
[11:04] into the book of this one and you'll
[11:06] learn who he is and you'll recognize the
[11:08] beauty or the character and this is just
[11:10] being used in a very
[11:12] in literature and shakespeare just being
[11:14] the incredible writer that he was or
[11:17] maybe they believe it was a team of
[11:18] writers whatever the mythology is today
[11:21] basically she's saying to her daughter
[11:23] read him like a book
[11:25] and this is what paul is alluding to
[11:27] says right now we see in a glass darkly
[11:29] but then face to face you'll see it
[11:31] clearly you'll be able to see it as a
[11:33] the true person who they are
[11:36] and we even have this phrase to read
[11:38] someone like a book or if someone else
[11:40] is an open book you say we read someone
[11:42] like a
[11:42] like a book is to discern someone's
[11:44] thoughts
[11:45] you can read them like a book you know
[11:47] what they're thinking you know what
[11:48] they're feeling you know their character
[11:50] and as paul says then shall i know even
[11:52] also as also i am known
[11:55] in psalms 139 verses 1 and 2 it says oh
[11:58] lord thou hast searched me and known me
[12:00] thou knowest my down sinning and my
[12:03] uprising thou understandeth my thought
[12:06] afar off
[12:07] there's a few translations that
[12:08] literally render this to i am an open
[12:10] book to you
[12:12] you know me you can read me you can read
[12:15] my mind you know my thoughts you know
[12:16] what i'm going to do you know my
[12:18] beginning you know my end you can flip
[12:19] back and forth through me i am you've
[12:21] read me like a book you know everything
[12:24] about me i you know the sum and
[12:25] substance beginning middle and end you
[12:28] know my origin you know my back story
[12:29] you know my motive you know the plot you
[12:31] know everything about my life you have
[12:33] searched me and known me you've read me
[12:35] you know my downswing my uprising you
[12:37] know my thoughts from afar off you know
[12:39] me like an open book
[12:42] it says revelations chapter 20 verse 12
[12:44] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[12:47] before god and the books were opened
[12:50] and another book was opened which is the
[12:51] book of life and the dead were judged
[12:53] out of those things which were written
[12:56] in the books according to their works
[12:58] paul refers to this time as the day when
[13:00] god shall judge the secrets of men
[13:03] these books are being opened and these
[13:05] books contain the works of man and
[13:07] they're judged according to their works
[13:09] and so it's in the opening of the book
[13:11] that a man is judged it's in the open of
[13:13] that book that you know the character
[13:14] the thoughts the motives and the
[13:16] objectives of that person
[13:19] paul is expressing this now we see in a
[13:21] glass darkly it's an enigma it's a
[13:22] puzzle but then face to face and then i
[13:24] shall be opened up and i shall know even
[13:27] also as i am known there's going to be
[13:29] things disclosed and things revealed
[13:32] even pogba says i'm going to be read
[13:34] like a volume
[13:36] and so an open book pondered this phrase
[13:38] with me together an open book is a
[13:41] person or thing that is easily
[13:43] understood
[13:44] or thoroughly understood or easily
[13:46] interpreted
[13:47] it to say that a something is an open
[13:49] book it's you can understand it and and
[13:52] you can read it and you can recognize it
[13:54] a person or thing that is easily or
[13:55] thoroughly understood or easily
[13:57] interpreted that some it's not cryptic
[13:59] it's not an enigma it's not a puzzle
[14:02] to say that a person's life or a
[14:04] character is an open book it means you
[14:05] can find out everything
[14:07] about them because nothing's kept secret
[14:10] you say that that person's an open book
[14:12] they tell you what they're thinking
[14:14] they're telling what you're what they're
[14:15] feeling
[14:16] they're not mysterious to you
[14:18] to be an open book it's something that
[14:20] is easy to understand or to figure out
[14:22] if someone is an open book it's one who
[14:24] acts honestly
[14:26] and not secretive and not hypocritical
[14:28] that they there's some integrity the way
[14:30] that they're acting they say oh well
[14:32] so-and-so told me that they wanted me to
[14:34] be successful and they'd say well that
[14:35] person that they were being honest they
[14:38] just weren't making that up
[14:41] something or someone that can be readily
[14:43] examined or understood that's what's
[14:45] meant behind an open book this idea this
[14:48] concept of an open book it can be
[14:49] examined it can be understood david said
[14:52] search me you've searched me and known
[14:54] me you've poured through my pages you
[14:56] know my volume
[14:57] it's someone or something that can be
[14:59] examined searched and understood
[15:01] that's an open book kind of understand
[15:03] what i'm looking at in terms of an open
[15:05] book
[15:06] now okay maybe we should start with the
[15:08] what the literal thing would be this is
[15:10] a closed book this would be an open book
[15:12] right that's the first part now we're
[15:14] looking at more of a figurative sense
[15:16] and what it looks at and what it
[15:17] represents and those are important
[15:19] because these phrases are used in a very
[15:21] figurative way and sometimes we get in
[15:23] our minds that these things are very
[15:24] literal so we're we're imagining right
[15:27] now that there is a
[15:28] literal
[15:30] uh chair in heaven that says mercy on it
[15:32] right because we think we take things
[15:34] very literally and it's not always
[15:37] intended to be literal so there's on the
[15:39] one hand the open book
[15:41] now on the other hand even what paul is
[15:43] describing for now we see through a
[15:45] glass darkly now i know in part it's not
[15:48] all available it's not all opened up
[15:50] it's not complete and so that would be
[15:53] described in a closed book
[15:55] someone who is a closed book or
[15:57] something that is a closed book it's
[15:58] someone or something that's difficult to
[16:00] know or difficult to understand
[16:03] if something is a closed book it is a
[16:05] secret is a mystery it is a puzzle
[16:08] paul said that this now it is an enigma
[16:10] to me it is a puzzle it is secretive it
[16:12] is not fully fully available to me so
[16:15] it's an illusion the information that
[16:16] one can't obtain
[16:19] and say well i can't get that
[16:20] information that's a closed book to me i
[16:21] don't have access to that if something
[16:23] is a closed book is something you can't
[16:25] comprehend or something you can't obtain
[16:27] you don't have access to it
[16:29] just a couple scriptural examples in
[16:31] isaiah chapter 29 verses 11 and 12 it
[16:34] says in the vision of all is become unto
[16:36] you as the words of a book that is
[16:38] sealed
[16:39] the vision of all things the
[16:40] understanding of all things the
[16:41] knowledge of all things he's saying it's
[16:43] a book that's closed
[16:44] it's a book that is sealed
[16:46] which men delivered to one that has
[16:48] learned saying read this i prayed then
[16:49] he saith i cannot for it is sealed it's
[16:52] a closed book to me it is a puzzle it is
[16:54] mysterious i cannot understand it i
[16:56] cannot read it and then it says and the
[16:58] book is delivered to him that has not
[17:00] learned saying read this i pray they
[17:01] said i am not learned that means the
[17:04] vision of all this understanding this
[17:06] knowledge remains sealed up
[17:09] it remains mysterious it remains an
[17:11] enigma puzzle that people can guess at
[17:12] and wonder at its contents and so
[17:14] there's a
[17:16] uh uh this is what a closed book means
[17:20] in daniel chapter 12 verses eight and
[17:22] nine he says and i heard but i
[17:23] understood not
[17:25] so daniel here's but he does not
[17:26] understand he says it's a there's a
[17:28] understand comprehension is lacking and
[17:31] being able to fully grasp it is not
[17:33] there maybe i know in part and i see a
[17:35] little bit and i know it's truth or i
[17:36] heard something i see something but it's
[17:39] not fully understood then said i oh my
[17:42] lord what shall be
[17:44] the end of what shall be the end of
[17:46] these things and he said go thy way
[17:48] daniel for the words are closed up and
[17:50] sealed till the time of the end
[17:53] god then is speaking to daniel's
[17:56] question i want to understand i don't
[17:58] understand these things
[18:00] tell me what these things are open up to
[18:02] me the understanding i i know there's
[18:04] something here that i
[18:06] i want to grasp i want to understand i
[18:08] want to be able to uh apprehend myself
[18:10] and then articulate and god says it's
[18:13] closed
[18:15] this book is closed
[18:17] this is something that's difficult to
[18:18] know and to understand because you're
[18:20] not going to be able to readily obtain
[18:22] its understanding i'll be able to grasp
[18:23] it because it's a secret it's a mystery
[18:25] it is a puzzle
[18:27] this is what i i want you to ponder an
[18:29] open book
[18:31] and a closed book
[18:33] so our title is i am an open book the
[18:36] subject that we're exploring and just
[18:38] beginning to look at i am an open book
[18:41] but i ask the question
[18:44] is it an open book or a closed book
[18:47] i am i thought about just putting the
[18:49] question mark i am an open book
[18:52] or is it a closed book which is he
[18:55] job chapter 37 verse 5 it says god
[18:57] thundereth marvelously with his voice
[19:00] that means difficult it's marvelous it's
[19:02] hard he thundered marvelously with his
[19:04] voice great things do with he which we
[19:06] cannot comprehend
[19:09] these things are mysterious
[19:11] to not be able to comprehend something
[19:13] it means that
[19:15] you can
[19:16] recognize its existence
[19:19] you can see that it is
[19:21] and you can
[19:23] you can understand that it has some
[19:25] being it has some purpose it has some
[19:27] attributes and characteristics but when
[19:29] you can't comprehend somebody uh let's
[19:31] just look at it this way there's times
[19:33] that we see somebody do something and
[19:35] we're not arguing about why they the
[19:37] fact that they did it we're having a
[19:39] hard time comprehending why
[19:42] hey like there's no doubt this was done
[19:45] it's very clear to me that you just did
[19:46] what you just did
[19:48] but what we can't comprehend is mode of
[19:50] objective purpose intent like what were
[19:52] you thinking
[19:54] why did you do that and there's this
[19:55] you're wrestling with it he said god
[19:57] does marvel he thunders marvelously
[19:59] difficult hard with his voice and the
[20:01] voice can be heard and he does great
[20:03] things but we cannot comprehend them we
[20:05] cannot fully know them he's saying it's
[20:07] mysterious to us in his even his motive
[20:10] and his intent
[20:12] and his purpose is hid to us it's not
[20:14] revealed
[20:15] and that's what a mystery is a mystery
[20:17] is something difficult to understand
[20:20] and so god is a puzzle to mankind
[20:23] god can speak i heard what he said but
[20:25] it can still be mysterious marvelous
[20:28] god can speak god can act god can even
[20:30] provide things
[20:32] and they can be very tangible but yet to
[20:34] fully comprehend them
[20:36] it would seem to be unsolvable
[20:40] in isaiah chapter 45 verse 15 verily
[20:42] thou art a god that hides thyself o god
[20:46] of israel the savior
[20:48] this is speaking to
[20:52] the
[20:53] an attribute of god a quality and a
[20:55] character of god
[20:57] thou art a god that hideth thyself it
[20:59] means to hide carefully to be concealed
[21:03] you are a god who is secretive
[21:06] you are a god
[21:07] that uh remains mysterious to man though
[21:10] we see your handiwork and though you may
[21:13] act in a way and even the god of israel
[21:15] the savior and even though he had spoken
[21:16] to them so often they say you are a god
[21:19] that hides yourself because you can't
[21:21] just clearly be explained you cannot
[21:23] fully be grasped and i want to point
[21:25] this out that it says verily thou art a
[21:27] god that hideth thyself that it is in
[21:29] his nature
[21:30] to hide himself
[21:33] it's a god who is hidden
[21:36] he hides himself even in simplicity but
[21:38] it's his intent to hide
[21:41] psalm 77 19
[21:43] says it this way thy way is in the sea
[21:45] and thy path and the great waters
[21:48] there's whenever a boat passes through
[21:50] the sea you can't go back later and find
[21:52] its tracks
[21:55] the waters return and cover it up it
[21:57] covers the path that covers the way the
[21:58] way thy way is in the sea and thy path
[22:00] in the great waters and thy footsteps
[22:02] are not known
[22:05] as a a ship passing through the sea or
[22:08] as a boat through the waters thy way is
[22:10] in the sea thy path of the great thy
[22:11] footsteps are not known you can see the
[22:14] impact of the presence something could
[22:15] have been there but the tracks are
[22:17] undiscoverable
[22:20] it's a very
[22:22] very rich scripture just to ponder
[22:26] as job is saying it and in isaiah god
[22:29] you're a god that hides yourself and
[22:31] your footsteps are not known but yeah we
[22:33] know that you've been here we know
[22:34] you've passed this way but to go back
[22:36] and figure it all out and see your
[22:38] imprints and your your steps and default
[22:40] solve them and follow them
[22:42] they're they're too hard for us
[22:44] in romans chapter 11 verses 33 and 34 oh
[22:48] the depth of the riches
[22:50] both of the wisdom
[22:52] and knowledge of god
[22:54] how unsearchable
[22:59] you want to know the definition of
[23:00] unsearchable
[23:02] you can't search it
[23:06] how unsearchable are his judgments and
[23:08] his ways past finding out
[23:11] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[23:13] or who have been his counselor
[23:16] this phrasing and realize that paul is
[23:19] drawing from job as he makes these
[23:21] statements in other places and we see a
[23:23] similar thoughts expressed even in the
[23:25] psalms his unsearchable judgments his
[23:28] ways that cannot be found out
[23:30] his his judgments cannot be searched out
[23:34] you know google may be very very good at
[23:36] this
[23:38] but it cannot search it
[23:42] and it's unsearchable judgments his ways
[23:44] past finding out a diligent examination
[23:46] cannot uncover them
[23:48] you can say oh well i haven't tried hard
[23:50] enough let give me more time i can
[23:52] figure this out i i'm very good at
[23:54] research let's put a team on this i just
[23:56] need the right search string i just need
[23:57] a more robust search engine he's saying
[23:59] his judgments are unsearchable his ways
[24:02] are past finding out even diligent
[24:04] examination isn't going to achieve the
[24:06] result of finding them out
[24:10] why is the scripture says in isaiah
[24:12] chapter 55 verses 8 to 9 for my thoughts
[24:14] are not your thoughts neither are your
[24:16] ways my ways saith the lord
[24:19] and this is
[24:21] this is not merely to point out a
[24:23] difference
[24:24] because as human beings
[24:26] uh we know mankind and we understand and
[24:29] appreciate one another because we're
[24:31] possessed with the same human spirit and
[24:33] we have though there may be a vast
[24:35] difference in how we have experienced
[24:38] things and even the things we've
[24:39] experienced and how we appreciate and
[24:41] interpret our experiences can be very
[24:43] different on some level what's beautiful
[24:45] about being a human is we at least ought
[24:47] to be able to uh sympathize with
[24:49] somebody else saying i can relate to
[24:51] pain that may not hurt me but i can
[24:54] relate to pain and i don't like that
[24:56] food but i know what it's like to like
[24:58] food that people don't like and i may
[25:00] not ever want to go there but there's
[25:01] places i want to go that people don't
[25:03] like and we begin to appreciate that we
[25:05] have differences but that's not what god
[25:08] is saying
[25:09] he's not saying you like thai food i
[25:12] like mexican food and you like to hunt
[25:13] and i like to fish no he's saying my
[25:16] ways are not your ways my thoughts are
[25:19] not your thoughts they are completely
[25:22] and totally different on different
[25:24] planes
[25:25] not just differences of opinions but if
[25:28] even i can say it this way god doesn't
[25:29] have opinions
[25:31] right we have opinions we have
[25:32] assessments we have takes on things and
[25:35] and we have feelings and and and we can
[25:38] change god just is immutable and
[25:40] everything's fact everything's truth
[25:43] and so he says it this way for as the
[25:44] heavens are higher than the earth so are
[25:46] my ways higher than your ways and my
[25:49] thoughts than your thoughts he's wanting
[25:51] to create the greatest difference and
[25:53] distinction between thoughts and ways
[25:55] from ours and here so that we can
[25:57] realize it's not like if we just try
[26:00] hard enough we'll get it
[26:03] why because god is mysterious to us
[26:07] he's a god that thundereth marvelously
[26:10] and he speaks but yet it's still
[26:11] difficult to understand
[26:13] god speaks and one man hears a voice and
[26:15] another man hears a thunder
[26:17] imagine that
[26:19] god speaks and one person says that's
[26:22] that's nothing but the truth and
[26:23] somebody else says that's a lie
[26:25] this is the puzzle this is the enigma
[26:27] this is how god is he's a god that hides
[26:30] himself he's a god that passes through
[26:32] in his footsteps are not known his
[26:33] judgment's unsearchable his ways past
[26:35] finding out who can know the mind of the
[26:37] lord who can
[26:38] sympathize let alone empathize who can
[26:40] even begin to grasp and comprehend
[26:43] because these things are so beyond
[26:45] ourselves
[26:48] is god an open book or a closed book
[26:52] in matthew chapter 11 verse 27 he says
[26:55] all things are delivered unto me of my
[26:57] father jesus speaking
[26:59] so now all things are delivered to him
[27:01] the father has given him placed in his
[27:03] care given him this understanding and
[27:05] possession of all things
[27:07] and no man knoweth the son
[27:10] but the father
[27:12] now this
[27:13] trying to put ourselves in the shoes of
[27:14] those who'd walked with him and had
[27:16] following him as master
[27:18] and then they're told that no man knows
[27:20] the son but the father
[27:22] he's using a language that would cause
[27:24] them to ponder and consider well we
[27:27] thought we were getting to know you we
[27:28] thought we knew you
[27:29] he's referencing something that maybe
[27:32] begins to take it out of this realm of
[27:34] well we know jesus who his mother was we
[27:37] know his brother we know his sister we
[27:38] know his father his mother we know these
[27:40] things about we've been with him
[27:42] through this time but now he's saying no
[27:45] man knows the son but the father so it's
[27:48] saying nobody knows me but god
[27:51] and and we could say well that certainly
[27:54] we could appreciate that
[27:56] who knew the son who understood him
[27:58] as he's trying to plainly declare hey
[28:00] guys i'm going to need to die and
[28:01] they're like no you're not we're going
[28:02] to fight for you we'll die for you
[28:05] he wasn't understood he wasn't
[28:07] appreciated he wasn't felt and
[28:10] uh uh and and known
[28:12] except by the father and then
[28:14] reverses it neither knoweth any man the
[28:17] father saved the son
[28:20] now this means there's only one person
[28:22] that knows the son and only one person
[28:24] that knows the father and that's it this
[28:26] is a very exclusive club
[28:29] all right there's the father and the son
[28:31] it's the father and son club and if you
[28:33] ain't the father and you ain't the son
[28:34] you ain't getting in
[28:37] because only one person knows me and
[28:38] that's my dad and only one person knows
[28:40] my dad and that's me and everybody else
[28:41] is like who you talking about who's the
[28:42] father who's the son we know who you're
[28:44] talking about
[28:46] some people sometimes say
[28:48] uh brother aaron whatever you do
[28:50] please don't share them you'll say what
[28:52] and then they start saying it yeah
[28:54] i don't know what you're talking about
[28:55] and then they just want to keep
[28:56] explaining it to you it's like
[28:58] in other words i'm not going to tell
[28:59] anybody
[29:02] it's like oh i thought maybe you really
[29:04] didn't know
[29:05] but this case no man knows the son no
[29:07] man knows the father except one another
[29:10] and then he says and he to whomsoever
[29:12] the son will reveal him this is an
[29:14] exclusive club and the only way you can
[29:15] get in is by revelation
[29:18] and and you have to come by way of the
[29:19] son
[29:21] so you cannot know god
[29:23] just by finding him in his creation you
[29:27] cannot know god truly no god to
[29:28] appreciate god just by
[29:31] recognizing that there has to be one who
[29:33] is above it all controlling the affairs
[29:34] of man it has to be through a revelation
[29:37] of jesus christ
[29:39] you cannot know god outside of christ
[29:42] revealing the person of god to you
[29:46] and so this is maybe maybe we've arrived
[29:49] at a point to where you start to
[29:50] understand yeah he can be a closed book
[29:52] and he can be an open book because this
[29:54] god who is marvelous and he's wondrous
[29:55] and he cannot be comprehended and he
[29:57] hides himself and his footsteps are not
[29:59] known and his judgment's unsearchable
[30:00] his ways past finding out because
[30:02] they're higher and thoughts are higher
[30:03] his ways are higher and at some and it's
[30:05] only known by the sun and only the son
[30:07] is known by the father but by revelation
[30:09] he can become known to you
[30:13] this is the i am
[30:16] john chapter 8 verses 52 to 59
[30:19] i appreciate just your attentiveness
[30:21] this morning
[30:23] and your your diligence just to listen
[30:25] and to ponder these things and think
[30:27] about these things
[30:28] and john chapter 8 verses 52 to 59 then
[30:31] said the jews unto him now we know that
[30:33] thou hast the devil
[30:36] abraham is dead in the prophets and thou
[30:38] sayeth if a man keep my saying he shall
[30:40] never taste of death and so when he said
[30:43] and you can even go back to a lot of
[30:44] things he's saying in john chapter 6
[30:46] just to kind of see how this is building
[30:47] this is building and he's really just
[30:49] getting
[30:50] getting them really hot under their
[30:51] sports collar
[30:53] and he's saying if you said that if a
[30:55] man will keep your sayings and he said
[30:57] in john if you eat this you'll never die
[30:59] if a man will keep your saying he's
[31:00] never going to taste to death and
[31:02] abraham and all the prophets are dead
[31:04] now we know you have a devil
[31:07] art thou greater than our father abraham
[31:09] which is dead and the prophets are dead
[31:11] who maketh thou thyself
[31:14] who maketh thou thyself and jesus
[31:15] answered if i honor myself my honor is
[31:17] nothing it is my father that honoreth me
[31:20] of whom you say that he is your god
[31:23] yet ye have not known him but i know him
[31:26] it's almost like nah
[31:29] but i know him
[31:32] and if i should say i know him not i
[31:34] shall be a liar like unto you but i know
[31:37] him and keep his saying these are
[31:39] these are hard things
[31:42] your father abraham rejoiced to see my
[31:45] day and he saw it and was glad
[31:49] this is if we could again just think
[31:51] about this jesus says hey if you keep my
[31:53] sayings you're never going to die like
[31:54] all right we know you've got a devil now
[31:56] you know i got a devil because abraham's
[31:57] dead the prophets are dead and you say
[31:58] if anybody will keep your words they're
[32:00] going to never die are you greater than
[32:01] abraham are you greater than all the
[32:03] prophets who do you think you are he
[32:05] says hey
[32:06] if i honor myself it's nothing but my
[32:08] father honors me and my father is god
[32:11] even the one you claim is your god but
[32:13] you don't really know but i do
[32:17] and if i said i didn't know them and
[32:19] then i'd be a liar like you
[32:21] right why are they liars because they
[32:22] say they know him but they don't
[32:24] and he's saying but i know him and i
[32:26] keep his saying your father abraham this
[32:28] to me is really the meat your father
[32:30] abraham rejoiced to see my day
[32:33] and
[32:34] he saw it
[32:36] now this i know we touched on i believe
[32:38] in the the subject of the supreme faith
[32:42] of abraham supreme faith revealed in
[32:43] abraham
[32:45] and how what what this would mean and
[32:46] what it would represent but he was he
[32:48] was long too and he rejoiced to see and
[32:50] was excited to see my day and he saw it
[32:52] and was glad there's something this is
[32:55] just really in their face and this is
[32:57] their response
[32:58] then said the jews unto him
[33:00] thou art not yet 50 years old and hast
[33:03] thou s seen abraham
[33:07] i would say based upon what jesus did to
[33:10] them this is a very weak reply
[33:13] but they just they're they're uh
[33:16] they're uh
[33:18] they're non-plus they're shocked they
[33:20] don't know what to say
[33:22] and you are you're a man who's not yet
[33:24] 50 not even 50 years old and you say
[33:26] you've seen abraham jesus said unto them
[33:29] catch this
[33:30] verily verily i say unto you before
[33:32] abraham was
[33:33] i am
[33:36] now you catch how remarkable that
[33:37] statement is
[33:39] hey before abraham was
[33:41] i am
[33:43] and this is it's very clear the jews
[33:44] caught what he intended because now
[33:46] notice what they say
[33:47] what they do then they took up stones to
[33:49] cast him
[33:50] but jesus hid himself
[33:53] and went out to the temple
[33:54] going through the midst of them and so
[33:57] passed by
[33:59] he still he still
[34:00] blended in he hid himself from them and
[34:03] passed it passed through
[34:05] before abraham was i am it's a phrase
[34:08] that to us in english ought to catch us
[34:12] that when you're referring to something
[34:14] in the past tense you would not want you
[34:16] you could not use a language to say
[34:20] if you want to say where you were
[34:22] yesterday you would use past tense and
[34:24] says before friday it was thursday
[34:28] you wouldn't say before friday it is
[34:30] thursday you're you're looking backwards
[34:32] you're looking in a sense that things
[34:34] change and things evolve and conditions
[34:37] and states but he says before abraham
[34:40] was i am before abraham was brought into
[34:42] being i am
[34:45] i there i had an existence before
[34:48] abraham had existence and like i said
[34:50] the jews know exactly what he meant he
[34:53] was already kind of needling a little
[34:54] bit i mean hey if i said i didn't know
[34:57] god i'd be a liar just like you and you
[34:58] claim to know god but you don't
[35:00] but i know i mean it's it's already
[35:02] getting to the boiling point but if
[35:04] there was something that was going to
[35:06] tip them over it was this phrase to say
[35:09] i am
[35:10] before abraham was i am because this is
[35:14] the very one
[35:15] that declared himself when he began to
[35:18] fully vindicate and affirm the promise
[35:20] that was given to abraham even as he
[35:22] said that unto your father abraham was i
[35:25] not known as this in other words i have
[35:27] made promises that he had not yet seen
[35:29] fulfilled but now the i am is here
[35:32] fulfilling to the children of israel the
[35:34] promise that i made to abraham and for
[35:36] him to say before abraham was i am it
[35:39] upset everything they believed
[35:43] why because there was only one before
[35:45] abraham and that is the i am because
[35:47] their religion their faith everything
[35:49] began with abraham
[35:51] they don't go before that
[35:54] they don't deal with nimrod they don't
[35:55] deal with cain they're not they're not
[35:57] relating themselves they find their
[35:59] faith embodied in abraham for him to use
[36:02] the language not before abraham was i
[36:04] was or before abraham
[36:06] he uses it so purposely i am
[36:10] it's then that they took up stones to
[36:11] stone them
[36:13] in john 5 18 he says therefore the jews
[36:15] sought the mort to kill him because he
[36:17] not only had broken the sabbath this
[36:19] happened prior
[36:21] but all said also that god was his
[36:23] father
[36:24] making himself equal with god
[36:28] so what prompted them
[36:30] what was
[36:31] burning in their hearts
[36:33] to make them want to stone him in john
[36:36] chapter 8 because he said i am
[36:40] he identified himself with the i am he
[36:42] identifies himself with the father not
[36:44] so much to a father-son relationship but
[36:46] now the embodiment the expression of he
[36:49] identifies himself with the i am and
[36:51] then there's this is exactly what
[36:52] angered them in john chapter 5 he said
[36:54] that god was his father and it makes
[36:57] himself equal with god
[37:00] so for jesus say before abraham was i am
[37:03] jesus is connecting his life with that
[37:06] of god himself
[37:09] and i it's very important that we
[37:12] that we
[37:13] pray
[37:14] for revelation and that we seek to have
[37:16] an understanding of the godhead and the
[37:18] person of god
[37:20] and the expression the manifestation of
[37:22] jesus christ because we don't we know
[37:24] that we're not trinitarians
[37:26] right
[37:28] and you know the number one mark of a
[37:30] cult
[37:31] is they deny the trinity i i think it's
[37:33] number one in larsen's book of cults is
[37:36] if you don't if you deny the truth of
[37:37] the trinity they just put you in that
[37:39] bucket
[37:40] so
[37:41] uh you you know you know who's writing
[37:43] the book now right
[37:45] now we know that you're a devil
[37:47] because you believe in the trinity now
[37:49] there's a uh
[37:50] that there's a we need to have a greater
[37:53] appreciation than just to deny the
[37:55] trinity and then wholesale swallow a upc
[37:58] idea of oneness
[37:59] we can't do that either
[38:02] it's a revelation of the godhead it's a
[38:04] revelation of god himself and so there's
[38:06] a when he says before abraham was i am
[38:09] he's making this connection and if i can
[38:11] say it this way jesus christ was the
[38:14] manifestation of the i am
[38:18] the one that met moses and was making
[38:20] himself known oh if i could just see you
[38:22] and he allowed that uh his backside to
[38:24] pass over he hit him in the cleft of the
[38:25] rock and passed by him jesus christ is
[38:27] making himself akin to that and
[38:29] identifying himself with that he says i
[38:32] i am that's making christ
[38:35] a part of this puzzle
[38:38] this one who his way he thunders
[38:40] marvelously whose
[38:42] ways are are unsearchable and unable to
[38:45] find out and thoughts are higher ways
[38:47] are high this one god that we cannot
[38:49] comprehend now this god is expressed in
[38:53] this person that's standing before him
[38:55] he is that sealed secret he is this
[38:58] hidden mystery this god we cannot
[39:00] comprehend
[39:02] the bible puts it this way in john
[39:04] chapter 1 verse 18 no man have seen god
[39:07] at any time
[39:09] the only begotten son which is in the
[39:11] bosom of the father he hath declared him
[39:15] the only begotten son
[39:17] this one who is at the heart of god
[39:20] he declares the father no man has seen
[39:23] god at any time but the father is
[39:25] declared by the son
[39:29] it it's meant to express that no man had
[39:31] seen god at any time
[39:33] but the son
[39:35] has unfolded this one to us that we may
[39:38] see him
[39:40] john chapter 14 verses 5 to 9
[39:44] if you had known me you should have
[39:45] known my father also
[39:47] and from henceforth you know him and
[39:49] have seen him
[39:51] that i i in pondering it now
[39:54] that we could slow down just on this
[39:56] statement alone but i see time is moving
[39:58] rather quickly
[40:00] if you know me if you had known me
[40:02] you know the father
[40:04] and then he says and from now on you
[40:06] know him and have seen him
[40:08] now
[40:09] philip
[40:11] and if you want to go back and read the
[40:12] a larger portion of this prior to this
[40:15] and then afterwards very key statements
[40:16] relating to the end time in john chapter
[40:18] 14
[40:20] it's philip catches this lord show us
[40:22] the father and it sufficeth us
[40:26] just show us the father will be
[40:28] satisfied it is enough that we would see
[40:31] the father
[40:32] and in that and we've expressed this to
[40:34] you before we might read them like oh
[40:36] silly philip but in this philip is
[40:39] catching the tr the purpose of christ
[40:42] he's realizing this is what you're for
[40:45] that he's starting to burn within him
[40:47] and he's starting to get it yes
[40:49] god god sent his son that we might know
[40:52] him he he's sending his son to so that
[40:54] we could see him and feel him and touch
[40:56] him and handle him and this is this is
[40:58] the introduction this is the messenger
[41:00] this is gonna be the only way we're ever
[41:01] gonna see jehovah elohim so he says just
[41:03] show us to him show him to show him to
[41:06] us and it'll satisfy everything
[41:10] and then but jesus kind of catches maybe
[41:11] this element that's missing because
[41:13] philip is getting very very close to the
[41:15] truth but maybe just the parts missing
[41:17] have i been so long time with you and
[41:19] yet hast thou not known me philip
[41:22] didn't he asked to see the father but
[41:23] jesus said you don't know me he that
[41:25] hath seen
[41:27] the father or excuse me he that have
[41:29] seen me hath seen the father
[41:33] this is the this is the force with which
[41:35] he wanted to get philip's attention this
[41:38] longing this passion this desire this
[41:40] hunger i will be satisfied my heart will
[41:42] be full i i will no longer weep and
[41:46] grieve i will no longer feel bankrupt i
[41:48] would no longer feel hopeless this
[41:50] agonizing pain that we have as jews to
[41:53] see jehovah elohim to see his person
[41:56] this one we couldn't even touch the
[41:58] mountain he was on no man could see him
[42:00] and live and you're bringing me so near
[42:02] him jesus just let me see him jesus
[42:05] wanted to meet him with this forest and
[42:07] say philip when you've seen me you have
[42:10] seen him
[42:13] oh what a what a revelation that could
[42:15] have been in that very moment he says
[42:17] then how can you say show us the father
[42:20] when you're looking at jesus christ you
[42:22] are seeing the father
[42:24] and brother branham and the message
[42:26] god's chosen place of worship he says
[42:28] when he met moses
[42:29] he had not a name yet and he told moses
[42:32] i am that i am.
[42:34] and when we see jesus on earth speaking
[42:36] saint john the eighth chapter he said i
[42:38] am that i am. he said oh no i thought he
[42:41] said i am well they said why you're a
[42:43] man not over 50 years old and say you
[42:46] seen abraham he said before abraham was
[42:49] i am
[42:51] this is what and just a very in two very
[42:53] very small words three letters i
[42:56] am could you what is what what could we
[43:00] say in three letters that would want
[43:01] people to kill us
[43:03] right
[43:05] i am was enough for them to take up
[43:07] stones why because there's such a
[43:09] revelation represented in this
[43:12] i am that i am
[43:14] he says and i am was the one the burning
[43:16] bush the pillar fire that was in the
[43:18] burning bush back in the days of moses
[43:20] the i am
[43:21] the i am i am who i am i am the being of
[43:24] beings i am the self-existing one i am
[43:27] this
[43:28] this i am the lord god i am the jehovah
[43:31] elohim
[43:36] in question and answers part three and
[43:38] at the end of august in 64 brother rams
[43:40] asked the question has the name of the
[43:41] lord changed
[43:43] in the different dispensations he says
[43:45] yes yes
[43:46] he was called the i am
[43:49] as he said in exodus 3 15 this is
[43:51] he says i am that i am and he says this
[43:53] is my name forever the lord god he says
[43:56] he begins with he was called the i am he
[43:58] was called jehovah he's changed many
[44:00] times
[44:01] the last time it was changed was when
[44:03] god became flesh and took a human name
[44:06] jehovah i am and all those are titles to
[44:08] a name if you were baptized in the name
[44:10] of jehovah it have to be the name of
[44:12] jesus christ
[44:13] if you were baptized in the name of
[44:14] jehovah rapha jehovah manasseh jehovah
[44:17] jiren all those it have to be jesus
[44:19] christ
[44:20] the i am is jesus christ
[44:24] jesus said he came in his father's name
[44:26] he said the i am is jesus christ
[44:28] remember standing there that day and he
[44:29] said you say you eat man in the
[44:31] wilderness our fathers eat manna
[44:34] and are dead
[44:35] and he said and he's taken even from
[44:37] john 6 john 8 and they said well we know
[44:40] that you're crazy because you're just a
[44:42] man not over 50 years old and you say
[44:44] you've seen abraham he said before
[44:46] abraham was i am
[44:49] he was the i am
[44:51] and all the titles and names that ever
[44:53] belonged to god was made one human name
[44:55] the lord jesus christ
[44:58] that's a that's a remarkable climax
[45:00] would you not say
[45:02] that this mysterious god who dwelt in a
[45:04] realm all by himself unknowable
[45:06] unapproachable he was all that there was
[45:11] and
[45:12] no man knows him sees them
[45:16] but then now one day
[45:18] one comes
[45:20] and says he's the son of god
[45:23] and and says that when you see me you
[45:26] see this mysterious one
[45:28] could we just put aside maybe our
[45:29] christianity just from now don't go
[45:31] crazy with that
[45:32] pus just push aside the idea that we've
[45:35] accepted this just it's in our hearts we
[45:37] believe that we're made to believe it
[45:38] and just kind of try to get that
[45:41] you know what that would even mean
[45:44] that we're just kind of going along
[45:46] right we're just kind of living our
[45:47] lives and all somebody somebody shows up
[45:50] and it's like i'm the son of god
[45:55] i'm it this is me i'm the son of god i
[45:58] have come from god before abraham was
[46:01] i am
[46:03] this is strange right this would be very
[46:05] very strange i know we have the benefit
[46:07] of doubt being a couple thousand years
[46:09] later and not having to really wrestle
[46:10] with the idea of who's this guy right
[46:13] but think of the process think of the
[46:15] principle
[46:16] and i'm i've been reading i've been
[46:18] reading a book and trying to think of a
[46:20] way just to succinctly put it but i'm
[46:23] reading of the dozens and dozens of
[46:25] false messiahs that have existed
[46:27] throughout time
[46:28] and their histories and their stories
[46:31] and there's even ones that the jews say
[46:32] you know what this guy was more like the
[46:34] messiah than jesus was
[46:36] and so depending on which book you're
[46:38] reading jesus is just in the list of
[46:39] crazies right
[46:41] and they have and there's and when you
[46:43] start thinking about that way
[46:46] and and i want to i'll say this as i'm
[46:48] thinking about it because it's it said
[46:50] when you think about it that way it
[46:52] sounds just to us to some people it's
[46:55] exactly what it sounded like when
[46:56] brother brown said and the seals were
[46:57] open to us the other day in
[46:58] jeffersonville
[47:00] like who's this guy
[47:02] right
[47:04] what are you talking about this is this
[47:06] can't be
[47:08] this is what's happening to the the jews
[47:09] in that day when he says i am
[47:12] in john chapter 5 this is what we took
[47:14] our text in i'm just going to start with
[47:15] verse 37 i would like to read to verse
[47:17] 40 even though i think i indicated only
[47:19] verse 39 on the slide
[47:21] making mistakes
[47:22] in john chapter 5 verses 37 to 40 and
[47:24] the father himself which hath sent me
[47:26] hath born witness of me just think of
[47:28] all these
[47:29] different places where jesus is
[47:33] jesus and the father just kind of have
[47:34] this they're woven together
[47:36] no man had seen god or the father at any
[47:38] time but the only begotten son he who
[47:40] was in the bosom of the father he's
[47:41] declared him show us the father when
[47:44] you've seen me you've seen the father
[47:46] you claim to believe in my father whom
[47:48] you say is your god but you don't know
[47:50] him but i do and if i said i didn't know
[47:53] god who is my father then i'd be a liar
[47:54] like you who claim him to be
[47:56] your god and abraham to be your father
[47:58] there's this
[47:59] this emphasis no man knows the son but
[48:02] the father no man knows the father but
[48:04] the son and if you want to know the
[48:05] father you've got to come by me
[48:08] and so he says this
[48:11] and the father himself which hath sent
[48:13] me had borne witness of me you have
[48:14] neither heard his voice at any time
[48:17] neither seen his shape
[48:20] now in john chapter 5 he's looking at it
[48:24] and
[48:25] i'll say this and maybe catch this as a
[48:27] principle
[48:29] you could read this and say what jesus
[48:31] said they had never seen the father and
[48:34] never seen his shape so jesus you've
[48:36] never heard his voice or see the same so
[48:38] then jesus couldn't have been his voice
[48:40] and he couldn't have been in shape
[48:42] right
[48:43] couldn't we do that just try to nail pin
[48:45] jesus down on his words but you have to
[48:47] catch what he's what he's expressing to
[48:49] them the father himself which hath sent
[48:51] me hath born witness of me you have
[48:52] neither heard his voice at any time nor
[48:55] seen his shape and you have not his word
[48:57] abiding in you for whom he have sent him
[48:59] you believe not now this would apply not
[49:01] just to jesus but to john
[49:04] this would apply to to many others that
[49:05] he's been sent now this is kind of the
[49:07] thrust of what i've been studying
[49:10] and i just want to introduce it i'll
[49:11] come back to it in the future search the
[49:13] scriptures
[49:14] for in them you think you have eternal
[49:16] life
[49:17] and there
[49:19] they which testify of me
[49:22] and you will not come to me that you
[49:23] might have life
[49:26] there's the symmetry that he has just
[49:28] made here is christ standing there
[49:31] speaking but you're not hearing his
[49:33] voice or seeing his shape you haven't
[49:34] seen it any time
[49:36] and because you have not received me you
[49:38] have him not abiding in you
[49:41] so he says search the scriptures
[49:44] search the scrolls search the written
[49:46] word search the old testament
[49:48] search your torah search your
[49:51] search what is your scrolls the the
[49:53] words of the prophets that which has
[49:54] been transcribed and say search the
[49:56] scriptures it's a reference to these
[49:57] things which have been written down he
[49:59] says search them
[50:02] because in these you think you have
[50:04] eternal life it's in this that you have
[50:06] this representation of life but this
[50:10] these writ this written word is what
[50:12] testifies of me
[50:14] he says but you will not come to me that
[50:16] you might have life and he's saying that
[50:18] here's the written book
[50:20] here's the book that was delivered to
[50:22] you here are the scriptures made
[50:23] available to you he says and you think
[50:26] there's life in them but whatever life
[50:28] is in this you have to come to me to get
[50:30] the life that the book speaks of
[50:35] jesus christ was the living word making
[50:37] god present amongst them he was the
[50:40] written word he says search the
[50:42] scriptures diligently examine them go
[50:44] through them probe them you think you
[50:45] have eternal life in them it's the
[50:47] written word that testifies of me he was
[50:49] the written word made flesh he was the
[50:52] fulfillment of what moses prophesied
[50:56] jesus christ was then the tangible
[50:59] manifestation of the promise
[51:03] this god who was mysterious who weighs
[51:04] you could not figure out the one who
[51:07] dealt with the people in sundry times
[51:08] through prophets
[51:10] and signs and wonders and they could see
[51:12] the hand of god they could see the
[51:14] presence of god they could see the
[51:16] prophets who speak on behalf of god but
[51:18] now one is standing there saying i am
[51:23] i am an expression
[51:25] of a god who is invisible to you
[51:29] in the message man that can turn on the
[51:31] light
[51:33] if you could
[51:35] just steady yourself
[51:36] and
[51:39] be very deliberate
[51:41] in in listening to this
[51:44] and these remaining things that i'd like
[51:45] to share
[51:46] because i'm just going to kind of come
[51:49] to an abrupt stop
[51:51] and i not that i want you to stop
[51:54] with me
[51:55] i want you to have enough momentum that
[51:57] when i stop you can you could just take
[51:59] off
[52:01] you say i that you're you're you're
[52:03] you're kind of in the momentum of it and
[52:04] if i have to stop the the spirit doesn't
[52:06] stop working in your heart and the lord
[52:08] can continue to express these things to
[52:10] you
[52:11] so in the message there's a man here
[52:12] that can turn on the light so life is
[52:14] only by the word of god made manifest
[52:17] the only way that there's life but the
[52:18] word of god made manifest he says it
[52:19] search the scriptures and then you think
[52:21] you have eternal life
[52:23] those scriptures testify of me and you
[52:26] have to come to me to have life
[52:29] so brother ram says so life is only by
[52:31] the word of god made manifest if christ
[52:34] wasn't the word of god made manifest
[52:35] they could not come to him to have life
[52:38] then he says life comes only by the word
[52:40] of god made manifest i love the emphasis
[52:42] the repetition this is the part i want
[52:44] you just to let it kind of strike you a
[52:46] little bit as long as it's just in the
[52:49] book like this it can still
[52:52] it still can be questioned
[52:56] as long as it only exists in written
[52:58] form as long as it is only the product
[53:01] of the human writer as long as it is on
[53:03] the indian
[53:05] paper and the leather binding as long as
[53:08] it only exists in the book and he's
[53:10] actually re pointing to the bible and
[53:13] you might think oh my we know the
[53:14] reverence that brother branham had for
[53:16] that book and he wouldn't place other
[53:18] things on it and we know the confidence
[53:19] he instilled us to believe that this is
[53:21] the word of god and that this is jesus
[53:23] christ in written form and that this
[53:25] this bible declares the person of god
[53:27] but he's saying as long as it is just in
[53:30] the book like this he gives some
[53:32] validity to questioning it
[53:36] as long as it's just written on paper it
[53:38] can still be questioned but when it's
[53:40] made manifest
[53:43] then you see the product of what it
[53:44] spoke of being manifested
[53:47] when it says one thing when the
[53:48] scriptures testify of a jesus christ and
[53:52] then the jesus christ comes when it's
[53:54] made manifest then you see the product
[53:56] of what it what it spoke of being
[53:58] manifested when you see the
[53:59] manifestation then that is light on the
[54:02] word
[54:04] you can have the word in written form
[54:06] you can have the word in paper form you
[54:07] can have the word in scripture form he
[54:09] says but when this translates the flesh
[54:12] he says that light on the word
[54:15] it's not just merely an understanding
[54:17] it's just not this mental acuity to
[54:20] grasp something and be able to parse
[54:21] things out and type things and and just
[54:23] run the concordance and read every
[54:25] scripture about something or just print
[54:26] quotes out and start reading things
[54:28] there's got to be a manifestation
[54:31] and when it's expressed with life and
[54:33] breadth behind it then that's light on
[54:36] the word
[54:38] said the word said so and then when it
[54:40] comes to past that is life in light
[54:43] light bringing life
[54:47] now
[54:48] i hope that you're able to kind of take
[54:49] this thought and there's a lot more that
[54:50] he uses in shalom in this sermon in
[54:52] particular about the light on the word
[54:55] bringing manifestation
[54:57] and the manifestation and vindication
[54:59] let's look at a scripture that expresses
[55:01] the same thing john chapter 1 verses 4
[55:03] to 11
[55:04] in him was life
[55:06] and the life was the light of men
[55:10] you do not come to me that you might
[55:11] have life
[55:13] and he uses a language to express that
[55:15] they're stumbling in darkness and they
[55:16] have not come to the life they have not
[55:18] come to the light but yet light has
[55:20] sprung up
[55:21] in him as the life was the light of men
[55:24] and the light shineth in darkness and
[55:26] the darkness
[55:28] comprehended it not
[55:30] still a puzzle
[55:32] still mysterious
[55:34] it doesn't mean the light wasn't shining
[55:36] right
[55:38] let me consider this
[55:40] jesus is standing there saying when
[55:41] you've seen me you've seen the father
[55:43] but they didn't see the father
[55:45] does that mean they didn't see him
[55:48] does that mean he didn't exist does that
[55:50] mean jesus was lying
[55:53] the darkness comprehended it not the
[55:55] light was shining but darkness
[55:56] comprehended it not there was a man sent
[55:58] from god now the symmetry to even what
[56:00] jesus is saying about john that we read
[56:02] in our text
[56:04] it's it's just picking up this
[56:07] this expression
[56:09] he was a burning and shining light
[56:11] and you were willing for a season to
[56:12] rejoice in his light
[56:15] he said but i have
[56:16] a greater witness than that of john
[56:20] a greater witness is that not what he
[56:22] expressed to the disciples of john
[56:24] greater things shall you see
[56:28] and there was a man sent from god whose
[56:31] name was john the same came for witness
[56:33] to bear witness of the light that all
[56:35] men through him might believe he was not
[56:38] that light
[56:40] but was sent to bear witness of that
[56:42] light
[56:43] scripture wants to be very diligent
[56:45] and purposeful to delineate between
[56:48] the one who perceives the one that
[56:49] foreruns and the one that speaks and
[56:51] testifies who himself is a great shining
[56:54] light
[56:56] but is not
[56:57] that light
[57:00] that was the true light
[57:02] which lighteth every man that cometh
[57:04] into the world
[57:06] and this is speaking of christ the one
[57:07] that we could come to later says that
[57:09] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[57:12] us
[57:12] it says he was in the world
[57:14] and the world was made by him
[57:17] and the world knew him not this is
[57:19] speaking of christ and i know it's a
[57:20] tremendous paradox
[57:22] these things
[57:23] he was in the world and the world was
[57:25] made by him and the world knew him not
[57:27] he came unto his own
[57:29] and his own received him not
[57:34] that's amazing
[57:37] so
[57:38] if i could think of it this way
[57:41] you have a book
[57:42] the scripture search the scriptures
[57:45] brother man says as long as it's in the
[57:47] book like this it can be questioned
[57:50] so
[57:51] in this form
[57:54] it can be questioned in this form it's
[57:55] probed at its guest at it's mysterious
[57:58] it's an enigma it's a puzzle
[58:00] but then
[58:01] when this
[58:03] is opened
[58:05] and it's made manifest
[58:10] it's not that all of a sudden everyone
[58:12] goes
[58:13] yes
[58:14] of course
[58:15] that's it
[58:18] because the light comes in the world and
[58:20] instead of the darkness dissipating the
[58:22] world rejoicing instead of his own
[58:24] receiving him
[58:27] he's rejected
[58:29] as long as it's in the written form
[58:32] it's still close it can it's still
[58:33] closed
[58:34] all right so let let me come back to
[58:36] just even this image
[58:38] as long as it stays like this it's an
[58:41] enigma
[58:44] when this happens
[58:47] it may still be an enigma but now it can
[58:50] be solved
[58:53] but if it never becomes this all we do
[58:56] is talk about it
[58:58] as long as it's a closed book we can
[59:00] just talk brother what are you thinking
[59:02] and honey what do you think about this
[59:03] and what do you think about that and we
[59:05] just talk about it
[59:07] we guess and we probe but once it
[59:09] becomes this
[59:11] it's only after it opens up it's only
[59:13] after the light comes on the word then
[59:16] he can be known but as long as it stays
[59:18] shut it's still a puzzle
[59:21] we're still just talking about it we're
[59:22] still just guessing about it but then
[59:25] once once it's once it's opened up this
[59:27] so then he says search the scriptures
[59:30] and i've got a i've got to close so i
[59:32] don't want to i'll just have to express
[59:33] this into greater detail
[59:36] later so then he says search the
[59:38] scriptures
[59:39] they had the written word
[59:42] but as long as it just remained written
[59:45] it remained closed
[59:48] but now he's saying search the
[59:50] scriptures because they testify of me
[59:52] that if there was a way that they could
[59:54] go back to what had once been closed
[59:57] and searched them then it would begin
[1:00:00] the process to recognize this is now
[1:00:03] open to us we can now see and thank god
[1:00:07] there were those that saw the book
[1:00:10] opened in that day
[1:00:14] let me bring it to this i want you to
[1:00:15] think very deeply about today then
[1:00:18] and it is very important and i feel a
[1:00:20] tremendous burden
[1:00:22] to be very zealous to def to to
[1:00:25] lift up and to preach jesus christ
[1:00:28] and and to preach the truth of the son
[1:00:30] of god to preach the deity of jesus
[1:00:32] christ
[1:00:33] to to reaffirm and acknowledge and lift
[1:00:37] up that there's christ in him crucified
[1:00:39] there is not another way of salvation
[1:00:41] there is not another blood there is not
[1:00:42] another birth that we've got to come by
[1:00:44] the way of the scripture
[1:00:46] and and he's been so obscured and so
[1:00:48] muddied and so mixed up with theology
[1:00:50] and christianity
[1:00:52] has has even against
[1:00:54] their their desire made a christ a
[1:00:57] mystery all over again
[1:01:00] but i also want you to think about today
[1:01:05] is the i am an open book or is he a
[1:01:07] closed book
[1:01:11] think deeply about today brother branham
[1:01:13] says now over in the book he's referring
[1:01:15] to the bible he says we find that the
[1:01:16] book was closed and shut up
[1:01:19] and sealed into the end of
[1:01:22] time this is the book tells us right we
[1:01:26] read it in daniel we can read it in
[1:01:27] revelation
[1:01:28] that the book is sealed
[1:01:31] the book tells us that the book is
[1:01:32] sealed
[1:01:34] now in this sermon god's power to
[1:01:35] transform i just want you to think about
[1:01:37] this
[1:01:38] but since the opening of those seven
[1:01:40] seals of them angels just behind the
[1:01:42] mountain yonder
[1:01:43] this
[1:01:44] has become
[1:01:46] a new book
[1:01:49] this has become a new book
[1:01:52] now
[1:01:53] what does it mean that the bible's
[1:01:55] become a new book
[1:01:57] what does it mean to say that we have an
[1:01:59] open book or we're the people of the
[1:02:01] open book what does it mean to express
[1:02:03] these principles and allude to these
[1:02:05] things i'm ending with this these of
[1:02:07] course i have one more statement to read
[1:02:09] you but this is what i want you to think
[1:02:10] about when you leave here today
[1:02:12] there may be two classes of people maybe
[1:02:14] three that would respond to these maybe
[1:02:17] those that would just outright reject it
[1:02:19] and then there's a class that might say
[1:02:21] well it's not opened and maybe there's a
[1:02:23] class that says it is opened
[1:02:24] different opinions and different takes
[1:02:26] on this
[1:02:27] but let's just take it for what he says
[1:02:31] since the open of those seven seals
[1:02:34] this has become a new book
[1:02:37] what does that mean
[1:02:39] and when i say what does it mean i am
[1:02:41] not
[1:02:43] asking i guess i'm not asking for it in
[1:02:46] just its meaning
[1:02:48] that well what it means when the book is
[1:02:51] open is that this happened and that
[1:02:54] happened and this transpired and this
[1:02:56] transpired no that's that that that's
[1:02:59] not what i mean when i say what does it
[1:03:01] mean what i mean is what's the
[1:03:03] implication
[1:03:06] when something happens and we can say
[1:03:08] well that happens well what does that
[1:03:09] mean you say well it means that it means
[1:03:11] this that this that and the other and
[1:03:13] the question no what i what i was
[1:03:15] intending by the inquiry is what do we
[1:03:17] do now
[1:03:19] what what impact does this have is i
[1:03:21] heard the testimony last week of the uh
[1:03:24] the brother and his wife and kiev that
[1:03:26] the bombs start falling they're woken at
[1:03:28] four o'clock in the morning with the
[1:03:29] bombs falling upon their city and they
[1:03:32] immediately begin to pack because they
[1:03:34] know what it means
[1:03:36] like
[1:03:38] honey what does that mean well that
[1:03:40] means that somebody manufactured a bomb
[1:03:41] with an explosive in it
[1:03:44] and it's kind of no no no no no no you
[1:03:46] missed my point what do we do now
[1:03:50] what what's the what are the
[1:03:51] consequences of this
[1:03:53] and
[1:03:54] and if i can say this with respect
[1:03:56] it is it is very important that we fully
[1:03:58] understand and appreciate what brother
[1:04:00] branham
[1:04:01] meant when he said the bible has become
[1:04:04] a new book it is very important for us
[1:04:05] to understand what he meant when he said
[1:04:08] the seals are open but then once we get
[1:04:10] that and we know what it is it is even
[1:04:13] more important that we get the
[1:04:14] consequences
[1:04:17] like we say oh that's what he meant then
[1:04:18] there has to be something that
[1:04:20] reverberates there has to be something
[1:04:21] that comes from there has to be a
[1:04:23] response to every action there's an
[1:04:25] equal and opposite reaction if this
[1:04:27] bible became a new book then what does
[1:04:29] that do to me
[1:04:31] what does that mean for me i know what
[1:04:32] it means that the bible became a new
[1:04:34] book i can accept that but what what's
[1:04:37] the consequence for me what what does
[1:04:39] that mean for my life
[1:04:43] and consider this as we close
[1:04:46] in souls that are in prison now
[1:04:49] when these seven seals were opened
[1:04:52] that opened up the entire bible
[1:04:55] i i again i i know i'm
[1:04:57] provided in slide form
[1:04:59] those that are streaming the service are
[1:05:01] unable to see it but you have access to
[1:05:03] the message
[1:05:05] these aren't my words
[1:05:08] that opened up the entire bible
[1:05:13] it's a new book now
[1:05:15] they may got a new translation nope
[1:05:20] he said the seven seals it was sealed
[1:05:22] with seven mysteries
[1:05:24] and in these seven seals held the entire
[1:05:27] mystery of it
[1:05:28] and this is the part you have to
[1:05:30] like i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm doing a
[1:05:32] handoff if this is a run pass option
[1:05:35] you're getting the ball
[1:05:37] all right
[1:05:38] i'm handing the ball to you
[1:05:41] and it was the book of redemption
[1:05:44] new testament
[1:05:46] not the old
[1:05:47] it only proclaimed for the new testament
[1:05:51] now think about that
[1:05:54] the standard
[1:06:08] with our heads bowed let us pray
[1:06:13] express your
[1:06:14] desires to the lord
[1:06:18] present with us he's with us now
[1:06:22] express your desires to him
[1:06:24] heavenly father
[1:06:26] as we are standing in your presence this
[1:06:28] morning
[1:06:30] we come before you
[1:06:32] deliberately lord

[1:06:36] [Music]
[1:06:38] and we offer thanksgiving in our hearts
[1:06:40] for health
[1:06:43] for protection
[1:06:47] lord even when
[1:06:48] we have had financial difficulty
[1:06:52] you've met us in that need
[1:06:54] when we've had physical difficulties
[1:06:56] you've met us in that need
[1:06:59] ailments that we have wrestled with for
[1:07:01] a long time you've made yourself known
[1:07:03] to us through certain certain stages and
[1:07:06] reminded us that you're with us
[1:07:08] that you'll see us through
[1:07:10] and even lord in incidences where we
[1:07:12] fall and could have been very
[1:07:15] uh treacherous and cause great physical
[1:07:17] harm we recognize that your hand of
[1:07:20] protection is about us
[1:07:21] [Music]
