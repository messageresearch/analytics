[0:00] Matthew chapter 16 I'm going to title
[0:01] this the order of anointing the
[0:05] order of anointing the FES also with the
[0:09] Sadducees came and tempting desired him
[0:12] that he would show them a sign from
[0:15] heaven isn't it amazing that everyone
[0:19] needs a
[0:22] sign everyone needs proof need a
[0:25] physical something I could put my hands
[0:28] upon something I can prove something I
[0:30] can scientifically measure and monitor
[0:33] and I could and and if I could just have
[0:35] proof isn't it amazing that's how people
[0:38] are well if you'd be honest that's
[0:40] exactly how you are that's exactly how I
[0:43] am he answered and said unto them when
[0:46] it is evening so notice here this is now
[0:48] prophecy it's not just him Jesus
[0:50] answering these men these Sadducees and
[0:52] Pharisees but now is going to go to
[0:54] something prophetic notice he answered
[0:57] and said to them when it is evening you
[0:59] say it will be fair weather for the sky
[1:01] is red and in the morning it will be
[1:03] foul weather today for the sky is red
[1:05] and lowering oh you Hypocrites you can
[1:07] discern the face of the sky but can you
[1:10] not discern the
[1:12] signs of the
[1:15] times a wicked now here's the prophecy
[1:18] and I believe this is for Our
[1:21] Generation would TR go scripture has
[1:24] compound meaning and so it would be true
[1:26] in the generation that Jesus speaks it
[1:28] but it would have an ultimate of
[1:30] fulfillment or a climax in the end time
[1:33] or as Jesus says in the evening time can
[1:37] you say Amen am a wicked and adulterous
[1:40] generation seeks seeketh after a sign
[1:45] isn't that amazing so there would come a
[1:47] wicked and adulterous generation and one
[1:50] of the signs of that generation would be
[1:53] they would seek proof right and there
[1:58] shall no sign be given unto it but the
[2:01] sign of the Prophet Jonas it's amazing
[2:04] Jonah didn't know when he was in the
[2:05] belly of a whale wrapped in seaweed he
[2:07] was fulfilling his tribulation was
[2:10] fulfilling a Messianic prophecy of Jesus
[2:13] going into the Earth for three days and
[2:16] he left them and departed Matthew 26
[2:19] we'll just turn there and have you read
[2:21] before you're seated Matthew chapter
[2:24] 26 amen verse 31 we'll just begin
[2:28] reading love to hear those Bibles the
[2:30] rustling of the leaves amen this morning
[2:33] Matthew chap 26:31 let's read it
[2:36] together then SE Jesus unto
[2:40] them all you shall be offended because
[2:43] of me this night for it is written I
[2:46] will Smite the shepherd and the sheep of
[2:49] the flock shall be scattered abroad
[2:52] let's just pray Lord we give you thanks
[2:54] for you are good and your mercy endures
[2:56] forever from generation to generation
[2:59] Lord
[3:00] how men can make that their testimony
[3:02] your mercy your grace endureth forever
[3:06] we're thankful Lord for that promise
[3:08] here this morning knowing god Lord that
[3:10] in our own human ability we stand with
[3:13] no kind of enticing words or knowledge
[3:16] Lord I don't have anything here this
[3:19] morning that would be in maybe some way
[3:22] would intellectually impress anybody
[3:25] Lord but I've got your
[3:27] word and I put my confidence in that
[3:29] this morning Lord for these people that
[3:32] are gathered these are your children
[3:33] Lord every single one of them didn't
[3:35] come here they didn't come here Lord for
[3:37] a ill purpose or a negative reason Lord
[3:40] but everyone that's gathered here Lord
[3:42] they came to church this morning because
[3:44] they wanted to commune with you Lord and
[3:47] so I pray that you would come and move
[3:49] remove all obstacles remove any
[3:51] hindrances Lord God and may we just be
[3:54] caught up now in a supernatural realm
[3:57] Lord where you can deliver your thoughts
[3:59] Lord in your word to the hearts of your
[4:01] children how we need it Lord how we need
[4:05] you how we need your word how we need it
[4:07] to be fresh and real to our lives Lord I
[4:10] pray that you would help us may you
[4:12] bless brother Aaron Lord and the family
[4:15] as they are away Lord on vacation Lord I
[4:17] pray that you'd give them rest may you
[4:20] renew their strength Lord I pray God for
[4:22] each and every single person Lord that's
[4:24] here maybe some sick in body maybe not
[4:28] feeling well Lord I pray I pray you'd
[4:30] touch them great physician Lord I pray
[4:32] that you would set the captives free
[4:34] Lord answer the prayers of your children
[4:36] we ask we pray Lord all these things in
[4:38] your name amen amen you can be seated
[4:42] this
[4:43] morning I want you just to continue
[4:46] looking at this with me in Matthew
[4:48] chapter
[4:49] 26 and I'm going to uh just read some of
[4:52] these uh verses here and we'll reference
[4:55] them and come back to them but just keep
[4:57] keep your Bible open in Matthew chapter
[4:59] 26
[5:00] and just read this uh uh as we read this
[5:03] notice what he says here in Matthew 26
[5:05] and we just read the first verse but
[5:06] after verse 32 but after I risen again I
[5:09] will go before you into Galilee Peter
[5:12] answered and said unto him though all
[5:15] men should be offended because of thee
[5:18] yet will I never be offended Peter what
[5:22] a faith what a boast what a bold
[5:26] declaration that Peter makes and we
[5:28] could say Manet it's so zealous Peter's
[5:31] here the Lord saying I'm going to be
[5:33] betrayed and Peter says though everybody
[5:36] Lord is offended and though everybody
[5:38] walks away from you and though everybody
[5:41] rejects you Lord I will never be
[5:45] offended in you I would venture to say
[5:48] brother Peter was very sincere when he
[5:51] said this I actually would to go further
[5:54] and say that Peter believed what he was
[5:56] saying this wasn't just some put on or
[5:58] hype or caught up in the moment but
[6:00] Peter really truly out of his the bottom
[6:03] of his heart he was declaring this and
[6:06] he says Lord though everybody be
[6:09] offended uh the Peter said though all
[6:11] men shall be offended verse 33 because
[6:13] of thee yet I will not be offended Jesus
[6:17] said unto him verily I say unto thee
[6:19] that this night before the Crow
[6:22] Thou shalt deny me three
[6:26] times Peter said unto him though I
[6:29] should die wow now he's really going far
[6:34] though I should give my life though I
[6:37] should die Lord I I I I I I'm I'm so
[6:40] connected I'm so a part of you I'm so
[6:43] not ashamed of you I'm so going to stand
[6:45] for you though I should die with thee
[6:49] yet will I not deny
[6:53] thee likewise said all of the disciples
[6:56] and if you were there you would have
[6:58] said the same thing
[7:00] and if I was there I would have said the
[7:03] same thing notice here in in in in Luke
[7:07] chapter 22 just turn flip over to Luke
[7:09] chapter 22 notice what happens here in
[7:12] Luke 22 we're just going to pick this up
[7:15] uh let's just start at verse 53 when I
[7:18] was daily this is Jesus with you and
[7:20] Matthew records the same thing but Luke
[7:23] just gives it a little more detail when
[7:25] I was daily with you in the temple you
[7:26] stretched forth No Hands against me but
[7:29] this is your hour what an amazing
[7:31] statement and the power of Darkness so
[7:35] the word has an hour that it must be
[7:37] betrayed the word I'll say that again
[7:40] has an hour where it must be betrayed
[7:44] there's a generation there's a time when
[7:46] it must be accepted and masses follow it
[7:49] and masses and multitudes come for the
[7:51] fishes and the Loaves and the hillings
[7:53] but Jesus recognizes this is not that
[7:56] hour this is your hour to manif EST who
[8:00] you are he says this is your hour notice
[8:03] here then they took him and brought him
[8:05] to the high priest verse
[8:07] 54 and Peter followed a far
[8:10] off when they had kindled a fire in the
[8:13] midst of the hall and were sat down
[8:14] together Peter sat down among them but a
[8:16] certain maid beheld him as he sat by the
[8:19] fire and earnestly looked upon him and
[8:22] said this man was also with him and he
[8:25] denied him saying woman I know him
[8:30] not and after a little while another saw
[8:32] him and said thou are also of them and
[8:35] Peter said man I am not about the space
[8:40] of one hour after another confidently
[8:43] affirmed saying of a truth this fellow
[8:45] also was with him for he's a Galilean
[8:48] verse 16 and Peter said man I don't know
[8:52] what you're talking
[8:55] about how dare you identify me with this
[8:58] notice what a
[9:00] contrast between just in Matthew just a
[9:03] few verses before I'll never deny I'll
[9:06] Never Walk Away what happens to Peter
[9:12] what happens to his faith can I just get
[9:14] you to look at this rationally with me
[9:15] here what happens to this man who is so
[9:18] sincere and just zealous before the Lord
[9:21] and he's Lord I'll never leave you I'll
[9:24] I'll never I I'll I'll never walk away
[9:27] from you notice what brother brandham
[9:28] says here and I guess I don't have
[9:29] control so that's fine you can just
[9:31] Advance the slide notice what brother
[9:32] brandom says here in the first he says
[9:34] see how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man
[9:37] but it's got to be in the order of the
[9:40] anointing there's my title the outside
[9:43] Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy
[9:46] Ghost and the soul is dark as pitch
[9:51] right the cockabur grows on the same
[9:53] water puts life into the wheat puts life
[9:55] into the Cocker but at the bottom of the
[9:58] Cocker it's a cocko bir life it's
[10:01] rejoicing and blooming and got life and
[10:04] doing everything that the wheat
[10:08] does follow it's doing
[10:12] everything right that the wheat
[10:16] does it's doing everything that the that
[10:19] the that the wheat does it's blossoming
[10:21] and blooming got life but the soul of it
[10:24] it's a Cocker see FSE teachers can rise
[10:29] teaching all kinds of trinitarianism and
[10:31] everything else and be Anointed with the
[10:34] Holy Ghost and perform just as many
[10:40] miracles as the true gospel can but by
[10:44] the word here that's what does it see
[10:48] what I mean amen so brother Brandon
[10:51] would stand and we're going to we're
[10:52] going to cover this here this morning he
[10:53] would stand and he would identify a
[10:56] ditch on this side and he would identify
[10:59] a ditch on this side and he would say
[11:01] that you can so know the word
[11:04] intellectually in your mind and you
[11:06] could so read the word and scholarly
[11:08] academically can understand it say
[11:10] brother man is that wrong that's not
[11:12] wrong now that's where a lot of people's
[11:13] going wrong is they've called that wrong
[11:15] that's not wrong it's good to know the
[11:17] word it's part of the Gospel to know the
[11:19] word brother Bron when he'd identify
[11:21] this ditch he would say now I'm with
[11:23] Calvinism as long as a calvinist stays
[11:25] with the Bible but when the calvinist
[11:27] leaves the Bible I'm not with the
[11:28] calvinist anymore I'm an Armenian as
[11:31] long as he stays with the Bible but when
[11:32] he leaves the Bible I leave the Armenian
[11:34] ISM right so he says in this did you
[11:37] have knowledge and intellect and you
[11:39] know the word and you he says but to
[11:41] know him to not to know his word is
[11:45] life but here's the middle but to know
[11:48] him is life it'd identify this man over
[11:51] here in this ditch a Pentecostal fanatic
[11:53] and he'd say now he thinks it's all an
[11:55] emotion and because of what he felt in
[11:57] his flesh or in sensation that he jumped
[12:00] or he danced or chills went down his
[12:02] back or he spoke in tongues and he says
[12:04] now that's true all of that comes with
[12:06] it
[12:07] right but if you take it so far it
[12:10] becomes a ditch on this side or a ditch
[12:14] on this side and I want to stay out of
[12:17] ditches can you say Amen notice here he
[12:20] says that's what does it see what I mean
[12:22] trying to do God a service without his
[12:23] will he says see that's what does it see
[12:27] what I mean so notice this here Peter's
[12:29] faith comes to this point to where under
[12:32] pressure under the right circumstance or
[12:35] we could say under this right
[12:37] squeeze and the right conditions
[12:40] suddenly that faith that was so
[12:42] boisterous and loud and jumping and
[12:44] shouting or or puffed up in knowledge
[12:47] whatever it was couldn't hold Peter when
[12:50] pressure came under pressure words only
[12:54] take you so
[12:56] far right can you say amen amen
[12:59] so words are good it's important that
[13:01] the redeemed of the Lord say so but but
[13:04] really emotion's good it's good that we
[13:07] feel him in our flesh I love it when the
[13:09] Holy Spirit comes and I feel the breezes
[13:11] of Calvary and you begin to feel the
[13:13] anointing of the Holy Spirit I love that
[13:16] but it must not stay there it must go
[13:18] deeper and contact a realm where the
[13:21] real you is located and it's not in your
[13:24] intellect of what you learn it's good to
[13:26] learn but it must not stay there it must
[13:28] go go deeper it must go past an
[13:31] intellectual experience or an emotional
[13:34] experience and it must be the word
[13:38] transforming you on the
[13:41] inside now I know brother Aaron's got
[13:43] such a good Ministry and Teaching
[13:45] Ministry and I I and I and I'm he's a
[13:48] just a great person I've went to with to
[13:50] brother Aon many times we've had such
[13:52] good fellowship and he's help me in many
[13:54] situations see something and and so I
[13:56] know you're well taught here so I don't
[13:58] need to and maybe in other places I
[14:00] would need to cover a lot of ground and
[14:02] foundation so I just trust you're with
[14:03] me this
[14:04] morning and so it must go it must go
[14:07] further than that it's important as we
[14:09] said to have an understanding it's
[14:12] important on this ditch it's important
[14:14] to have a feeling it's important to feel
[14:17] God it's important for the redeemed of
[14:18] the Lord to say so it's an it's
[14:20] important to know him to know his word
[14:23] right
[14:24] yes you see it always starts there I can
[14:29] say that this morning it always starts
[14:31] in the flesh you say well you're just in
[14:34] the flesh well it always starts in the
[14:36] flesh I almost titled this message from
[14:39] your head to your
[14:40] heart it always starts in the flesh you
[14:43] always start everything that you do you
[14:46] start up the worship service uh a
[14:48] brother came up here and he led songs
[14:50] and he's singing and musicians start to
[14:52] play and they're using physical hands
[14:54] and physical instruments as far as I
[14:56] seen now was the brother not using his
[14:58] hands to this morning playing the piano
[15:00] he was just so caught up in a spiritual
[15:02] realm he was just watching it was was
[15:04] that what happened when I was in the
[15:05] back office come on be honest the
[15:08] brother was up here leading songs he was
[15:10] raising his hands you were raising your
[15:12] hands what is it it always has to start
[15:15] in the flesh it always starts with a
[15:17] with a subset of something but the
[15:19] prayer is is to say Lord don't let it
[15:21] stay there the reason we're in the flesh
[15:23] is to enter beyond the Flesh and move
[15:26] into a dimension where the Holy Spirit
[15:29] drops in the building and he deals with
[15:31] hearts I started this sermon speaking to
[15:34] you but an anointing is here right now
[15:36] to where the Lord takes over the service
[15:38] and he starts to discern hearts and
[15:40] discern minds and he says things that
[15:42] weren't even on my notes what is it it's
[15:44] the Holy Spirit taken control because I
[15:47] started with something and then the Holy
[15:50] Spirit took over oh what did had he
[15:52] right do it was important for her to
[15:54] verbally say that's nothing but the
[15:56] truth brother brandom what was it it was
[15:59] something she was doing that God was
[16:01] requiring in the flesh but the prophet
[16:03] said when she spoke those words it moved
[16:07] heaven and brother brandham says sister
[16:09] hadie whatever you ask right now God
[16:12] will give it to you what was it she
[16:14] started somewhere brother Brandon picks
[16:16] up a rock and throws it up in the air
[16:18] and he said a little Whirlwind just
[16:20] begin to spin it broke the atmosphere
[16:23] and when it landed that that tornado
[16:25] that hurricane that that Cyclone it
[16:27] nearly sunk Alaska
[16:30] right I hope you're getting what I'm
[16:32] saying here it must start somewhere
[16:35] Jesus says he that calls upon the name
[16:37] of the Lord shall be saved so what is
[16:39] that that's something that you're doing
[16:41] in the flesh it's something that you're
[16:43] saying it's a physical something that
[16:46] you do we don't just sit here on and
[16:50] absorb right right brother Brandon says
[16:53] Paul saw it come in a way of worship
[16:55] that excluded the leoty and the Holy
[16:57] Ghost Ministry and the best we can see
[16:59] today as a few ministers with inspired
[17:01] preaching while the flock just sits
[17:03] there and tries to absorb it brother bam
[17:06] says this is a far cry from what Paul
[17:08] said when all come together in a
[17:10] building and a church and a gathering
[17:13] all participate in spiritual
[17:16] worship right so notice the man speaks
[17:19] in tongues and brother rham is confused
[17:21] he he's so in admiration of this gift
[17:23] that he sees and the man's just speaking
[17:25] and the man interprets and brother bam
[17:27] goes outside and Shak his hand and the
[17:30] prophet says when I touched him he
[17:31] breaks into vision and realizes this man
[17:34] who was just speaking in tongues is
[17:36] living with a woman that's not his
[17:39] wife and he says what and brother benam
[17:43] says it so bothered him he goes to his
[17:44] cave he's praying he's saying Lord How
[17:46] could a gift how could this man operate
[17:49] such a true gift and what he said here's
[17:51] an interpretation it comes to pass and
[17:53] he's living in adultery and the the the
[17:56] Holy Spirit takes him to Hebrews 6 and
[17:58] says for the the rain falleth on the
[18:00] just and the unjust the same rain that
[18:03] Waters the tears also water the wheat
[18:05] both of them Rejoice together the wheat
[18:09] and the cocko bird does the same exact
[18:12] thing
[18:14] right that's why the prophet would say
[18:16] this you could cry real
[18:19] tears and it not be the Holy Spirit at
[18:23] all uhoh come on he says you could cry
[18:27] real tears David he brother B uses that
[18:29] reference to David was rejoicing said
[18:31] everything that looked like a Revival
[18:34] but God wasn't in it at all so the
[18:36] believer doesn't come notice what he
[18:38] says here was when Peter when Peter
[18:41] comes to this point and says I don't
[18:42] know him Lord I he comes from one point
[18:45] Lord I'll never deny you I'll never walk
[18:47] away from you and now he's his his faith
[18:50] is Shipwrecked I don't know him I don't
[18:52] know what you're talking about and the
[18:54] Bible says he
[18:55] curses now what happens was he a making
[19:00] believer come on
[19:03] no Peter was a real
[19:05] believer really
[19:07] believed intellectually he believed in
[19:11] his mind he believed in his eyes he
[19:13] believed was he an unbeliever no he was
[19:16] a True Believer with an anointing on his
[19:19] flesh but not in his soul Luke chapter
[19:22] 22 we just read it notice what James
[19:23] chapter 2 says I want you to turn James
[19:25] chapter 2 this all right this morning
[19:28] verse 19 notice this thou believest very
[19:31] familiar I'll wait for you to get there
[19:32] James James chapter 2 just have that
[19:35] ready and brother if you could be ready
[19:37] also when I ask for the slide brother
[19:39] John notice what he says here in James
[19:41] chapter
[19:44] 2 verse 19 thou
[19:48] believest thou
[19:50] believest that there is one God I'm
[19:53] going to just hold for just a moment
[19:56] thou believest that there is one God how
[19:59] many believers do we have here today
[20:00] that would raise their hand and say I
[20:02] believe there is one God James says Thou
[20:06] doest well thank you James the Devils
[20:09] also
[20:11] believe I was feeling really high up
[20:13] here and now I'm like wait a minute hold
[20:16] on I'm I'm right with the
[20:19] devil right thou believest that there is
[20:21] one God thou doest well the Devils also
[20:27] believe that word here in the slide this
[20:30] word is pisto and you could display that
[20:33] for me this is what it means it means to
[20:35] think to be true the Devils also believe
[20:40] to be persuaded of to give credit place
[20:42] confidence in of a thing believed to
[20:45] credit to have confidence in a moral
[20:47] religious reference mere acknowledgment
[20:50] of some fact that's an important word
[20:53] today or
[20:56] event mere acknowledgement of some fact
[20:59] or event
[21:01] intellectual Faith the the the you
[21:03] believe in God thou doest well the
[21:06] Devils also pistu they also have faith
[21:10] to this level they also believe they
[21:13] also UST to a thing to one his Fidelity
[21:16] to be entrusted with a thing let me tell
[21:18] you something the devil believes the
[21:20] message of the hour as much or more as
[21:24] you want to say that you believe the
[21:25] message of the hour there's been many
[21:27] people who's left the message I promise
[21:29] you there's not been one demon or one
[21:31] devil that has created a website
[21:33] denouncing the message of the
[21:38] hour there's not been one you go to the
[21:40] good
[21:41] www.google.com and try to find it
[21:43] there's not been one devil that has ever
[21:45] left the message they believe it that
[21:47] that that I can promise you no devil has
[21:49] ever questioned uh the the the
[21:51] Vindication of God's Prophet no devil
[21:54] ever did I mean it'd be almost like me
[21:56] like me questioning you know Mike Tyson
[21:58] and if we never had videos of Mike Tyson
[22:01] of his of his punches or his Knockouts
[22:03] and all we had was a radio in those days
[22:06] and all we could do is hear and listen
[22:07] and you could hear the crowd and oh Mike
[22:09] he hits him with the left oh he's down
[22:12] all we had was just uh audio sir audio
[22:15] cliets of Mike Tyson's fights it'd be
[22:17] like me getting up here Generations
[22:19] later and saying you know what guys I
[22:21] mean I get it that Mike was good but
[22:24] really was he really all that I mean
[22:27] Luke I think think I could have took
[22:32] Mike come on I mean I I think I I mean
[22:36] really Mike wasn't all that I mean come
[22:38] on I mean I think I I think really you
[22:40] talk about Iron Mike I mean I don't know
[22:42] guys I don't think you know that'd be
[22:43] one thing for me to say it but you have
[22:46] the YouTube top 10 Knockouts of Mike
[22:48] Tyson put up one of his I won't call
[22:50] them opponents I'll call them victims
[22:52] put up one of his victims behind this
[22:54] pull pit and let him testify about
[22:56] Mike's uppercut amen
[22:59] now you laugh but put up a demon Spirit
[23:01] of cancer and let him testify you about
[23:04] the ministry of William brandham let a
[23:06] demon of tuberculosis or heart trouble
[23:09] or nervousness testify about the
[23:11] Vindication of the ministry of God's
[23:13] Prophet you'd get a very different reply
[23:16] or story than what you get
[23:20] today can you say Amen so the Devils
[23:23] also listen to what listen to what some
[23:25] of these men said no notice the next
[23:26] slide forgot I had it here notice this
[23:29] is just what some of the witnesses said
[23:31] you can go past that to the the next one
[23:34] I think oh you don't brother John I sent
[23:36] you I always do this to Brother John I
[23:38] sent you an updated one more recent than
[23:40] that do you have it can you try to get
[23:42] it amen just just try to try to grab it
[23:44] try to grab it see if you got it I got a
[23:46] confirmation there will be no Liars in
[23:48] heaven and there will be no wires in
[23:51] heaven and it won't be Wireless either
[23:53] that won't be anything like
[23:55] that so notice here the devil's also
[24:00] believe to have confidence in to have
[24:02] trust to have faith in to give c credit
[24:06] to notice how far this goes to have
[24:09] credit this is the word here he says the
[24:11] Devils also
[24:13] believe and
[24:16] tremble so there's the two SIDS they
[24:19] intellectually and
[24:22] emotionally believ in
[24:26] God but is a devil saved is he redeemed
[24:28] is he born
[24:30] again notice here uh well it didn't come
[24:33] through all right that's fine I'm just
[24:34] going to read him you can hold that up
[24:36] there I want to read you what some of
[24:37] the witnesses some of the some of the
[24:40] some of the men said around brother
[24:41] bram's Ministry this is the house that
[24:43] the Lord built Gordon Lindy and I they
[24:45] have it there but it's you just have to
[24:47] I'm going to read it to you I I I
[24:48] something came through wrong notice just
[24:50] listen never had we known of any
[24:53] preacher calling deaf mutes and blind
[24:56] people to pray for and then to see those
[24:58] people delivered on the spot a Ministry
[25:01] that was beyond any that we had before
[25:06] witnessed James Morris in the book the
[25:08] preachers you can go to the next slide
[25:10] it was brandom I'm going to read you a
[25:12] quote it was brandom more than any other
[25:15] evangelist who started the postor war II
[25:17] fundamentalist hilling Revival following
[25:20] his Encounter With An Angel on May 7th
[25:22] 1946 word radiated in every direction
[25:28] that all manner of diseases and
[25:31] afflictions were healed instantly by the
[25:34] little Indiana preacher even cases of
[25:37] raising the dead were
[25:39] published this is in the William Brandon
[25:42] memorial service notice what it says
[25:43] here God has chosen diverse and
[25:46] mysterious ways to reveal himself to his
[25:48] servants especially those called for
[25:51] dispensational purposes as was brother
[25:53] branham's call in short the man we know
[25:56] is William brandham was to demonstrate
[26:00] God again in
[26:04] flesh FF Bosworth you know very well
[26:07] Christ the Healer when the gift is
[26:09] operating brother brandham is the most
[26:11] sensitive person to the presence and
[26:13] working of the holy spirit in the
[26:14] spiritual realities of any person I have
[26:17] ever known Morris cell and wind over the
[26:20] 20th century God called this humble man
[26:24] and anointed his ministry to a degree
[26:26] that within a few short years his name
[26:29] was known in the most remote jungle out
[26:32] station wherever you would go in this
[26:35] world you would find that the name of
[26:38] this messenger has preceded
[26:41] you for gospel businessman men's voice
[26:45] Magazine February 1961 in Bible days
[26:49] there were men of God who were prophets
[26:50] and seers but in all the sacred records
[26:53] none of these had a greater Ministry
[26:56] than that of William brandham of a
[26:58] prophet and Seer of God whose photograph
[27:01] appears on the front cover of this issue
[27:03] of Full Gospel uh Full Gospel men's
[27:06] voice brandom has been used by God In
[27:10] The Name of Jesus to raise the
[27:15] dead now what Facebook ad for a local
[27:18] event that's coming to you have you ever
[27:19] read coming in October is a minister
[27:22] we're going to bring in and he's going
[27:24] to raise the Dead
[27:29] wow yeah what Ministry come on what BR
[27:32] what man do you know I see all kinds of
[27:34] healing Revival I see all kinds of
[27:35] charismatic see all kinds of men great
[27:38] men not diminishing any of their
[27:40] Ministry but what other Ministry do you
[27:42] know what other advertisement do you
[27:44] have for a man come into your town to
[27:46] come and raise the
[27:49] dead so as we said here they the the
[27:53] devil had an intellectual head knowledge
[27:55] so it starts there Peter says I'll never
[27:57] deny you pressure comes and pressure
[28:00] says oh I believe in it I believe in it
[28:02] I believe in it I believe in it I stand
[28:05] with it I'm identified with it I I I I
[28:07] I'm going to it's important listen to me
[28:11] friends to say you're identified with it
[28:15] and to submit yourself to it is two
[28:18] different
[28:20] things I he in a man the other day and
[28:22] he was saying you know you get resumés
[28:24] and of these men he said you know you
[28:26] you ask you know questionnaire do you
[28:28] believe the message of the hour I do
[28:30] with all my heart you believe Malachi
[28:31] 4's fulfillment I do with all of my
[28:33] heart you believe that there's not three
[28:35] Gods there just one God I believe that
[28:37] not a trinity I oh I brother I believe
[28:39] that with all that's within me you
[28:41] believe that we have a fulfillment of
[28:43] Luke 1730 the ministry of William
[28:45] brandom brother I believe that with
[28:47] everything that was with that's within
[28:49] me and he said now some of you would
[28:51] make that man your
[28:53] pastor but I just read you the resume of
[28:55] Lucifer
[29:02] feel good
[29:04] [Laughter]
[29:07] right you see brother brandham says to
[29:10] the true evidence of the baptism of the
[29:11] Holy Ghost is to accept the message or
[29:13] the word for your day to believe the
[29:15] message for your day now there's very
[29:17] different in saying you believe
[29:18] something and your life submitting
[29:21] itself to
[29:23] that right hope that's clear enough you
[29:26] say brother Matt what does it mean a
[29:28] true evidence that you've never been
[29:29] born again is that you don't accept the
[29:31] word for your day but is the evidence
[29:33] just to say you believe it no that's not
[29:36] that that doesn't mean listen don't
[29:39] confuse and I'm I'm going to say this in
[29:42] the the way that I wrote this because
[29:44] it's it's so important to believe that
[29:46] so you say brother man I've got
[29:48] something so don't confuse the something
[29:52] with with with the person in other words
[29:54] don't confuse the gift with The Giver
[29:58] right so even if you move even if you
[30:01] say something you've got to move from
[30:03] intellect and you've got to move from
[30:05] emotion to True revelation we know
[30:07] that's what brother bandam says true
[30:10] faith is a
[30:12] revelation Deus believed followed Paul's
[30:16] Ministry but there came a point in
[30:18] deus's life where he looks at Paul and
[30:20] says you know what Paul's just washed up
[30:23] now brother Bram says Deus wasn't a
[30:25] hypocrite wow de wasn't a make believer
[30:29] he seen the really Revival watched the
[30:32] healing but you know it's so easy to
[30:35] accept Paul when he's renowned and
[30:39] everybody loves him and everybody
[30:41] accepts him and you say I believe it
[30:43] it's so was so easy to follow Jesus when
[30:46] the multitudes were following him when
[30:48] the fishes and Loaves and miracles and
[30:50] blind eyes and Deads being raised it's
[30:52] so easy to believe and follow him when
[30:55] he's accepted by the masses oh but how
[30:58] much a very different thing when he's
[31:04] rejected I stand I'm identified I
[31:07] believe it yeah so does everyone else
[31:09] right now I I believe it with all of my
[31:12] heart yeah so does everyone else they
[31:15] they believe it also but watch what
[31:16] happens when Jesus doesn't becomes so
[31:19] unpopular because of the word he
[31:21] preaches unless you eat my flesh and
[31:25] drink my blood you have no part with
[31:27] with me the Bible says many of them said
[31:31] this is a hard
[31:34] saying what was it what is that mean
[31:36] that means intellectually there was a
[31:38] there was a a a a a crisis
[31:41] intellectually that's doesn't it goes in
[31:44] and it doesn't come out
[31:46] it unless I eat his flesh and drink his
[31:49] blood I have no part many of them that
[31:52] walked with him walked with him no
[31:56] more could you imagine had you been
[31:59] there and there was a 100 people in that
[32:02] church and and I'll make it bigger than
[32:04] that let's say there were 500 people in
[32:06] that church you say oh boy 500 you know
[32:07] in the message our churches are 25
[32:10] probably 25 people would be an average
[32:12] size Message Church man you got 200 you
[32:15] got a big church you got 500 you got a
[32:17] message mega
[32:26] church notice here Jesus says now not
[32:29] what would you do had you were in that
[32:31] crowd and out of a out of a 100 people
[32:35] 88 people get up with their families
[32:38] grab their children grab their
[32:39] belongings and they walk out
[32:42] right and everyone's leaving now he's
[32:44] not popular anymore I can't I no brother
[32:47] H that's just a little too far for me I
[32:49] mean was okay for a while but my
[32:52] goodness you people are
[32:54] weird it's just odd that's doesn't fit
[32:57] rationally intellectually in my mind I
[32:59] just can't go that far honey let's go
[33:02] let's go get the kids let's go and
[33:03] everyone gets up and walks out and
[33:05] everyone's leaving and ushering and
[33:07] everyone's leaving and you're sitting
[33:08] there and you're watching as this person
[33:10] and this person is leaving not one at a
[33:11] time but a mass is leaving and then you
[33:14] hear the door shut and Jesus looks up
[33:17] and says hey what what are you doing
[33:21] here what are you doing
[33:25] here to whom would I go Lord
[33:29] amen do you imagine that's the
[33:31] Revelation that's sunk in their heart
[33:34] you alone have the words of anything
[33:37] that doesn't make sense here but
[33:39] something in here that's the only thing
[33:41] I found that resonates with inside of me
[33:44] it's the only thing I have that I know
[33:46] in the whole world is true though none
[33:50] go with me still I'll follow though the
[33:53] world turn its back on me still I'll
[33:55] Stand you say was it going to be you and
[33:57] your intellect no your emotion no but an
[33:59] anchor of Revelation that Jesus says the
[34:02] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[34:11] that it's amazing that I'm just going to
[34:13] turn a corner
[34:15] here and and we're just going to just
[34:18] going to turn a corner because I just
[34:19] feel led to it don't had a Direction but
[34:22] we'll
[34:22] turn it's amazing when we use this word
[34:25] truth
[34:29] truth is an absolute standard we could
[34:31] read the definition of it truth is the
[34:33] absolute standard by which reality is
[34:35] measured truth in God's view on any
[34:37] subject situation question or idea so
[34:41] let me just say this to you this morning
[34:42] pilate asks a question and says what is
[34:46] truth Jesus is standing in front of him
[34:49] and he's asking this question what is
[34:52] truth now this is a wrong question the
[34:54] right question pilot is who is truth
[34:57] because truth is not an idea it's not
[34:59] something you learn academically or a
[35:01] scholar teaches you or or you you learn
[35:04] by your intellect or rationale or
[35:06] reasoning but truth is a person who is
[35:10] personally revealed to you individually
[35:15] not as a group but truth is something
[35:18] that's communicated divinely to a person
[35:21] and Jesus says the gates of hell can't
[35:24] Prevail Flesh and Blood didn't teach you
[35:27] that Peter but my Father which is in
[35:29] heaven hath revealed it to you and the
[35:32] gates of hell can't Prevail against that
[35:35] so truth is not what scholar is is pilot
[35:38] asked the question what is truth what is
[35:42] it it's not about what it's about who is
[35:46] truth amen you see truth is not what you
[35:50] learn even pilate did you know that
[35:53] hundreds for hundreds of years there was
[35:55] no physical proof that this this man
[35:58] pilot you read about in the Bible ever
[36:03] existed and for hundreds of years you
[36:05] imagine that
[36:08] person brother help me what what's wrong
[36:10] brother I just found
[36:12] out gole Google Google
[36:16] says there's no such a person as
[36:21] pilot and it's shaken my faith what do
[36:23] you mean brother I I Googled it brother
[36:25] Matt there's nothing there
[36:30] hundreds of years this is what people
[36:32] believed until one day in 1962
[36:35] archaeologists uncover a site and they
[36:37] uncover incription in a in a in a pillar
[36:40] an inscription of pontis pilot now I
[36:43] wonder what happened to that person as
[36:44] they suddenly have the evidence oh now
[36:47] I'm a
[36:50] Believer I can believe it now but what
[36:53] happens when maybe a hundred years later
[36:55] they say that actually wasn't Pilot's
[36:56] inscription and
[37:00] you see where the facts go when a person
[37:02] says you got to have facts well whose
[37:03] facts are we talking about facts is not
[37:06] something that you intellectually
[37:08] academically learn but see to the real
[37:11] believer you didn't need an inscription
[37:13] of pilot you didn't need archaeologist
[37:15] to tell you that pilot ever existed
[37:17] because you met the author of the book
[37:19] you met the man who wrote about pilot
[37:22] and he's been revealed to you and so you
[37:24] accept his word
[37:28] so it's not let me just go further and
[37:30] say truth is not what I say it is no
[37:33] matter how dogmatically I can sound this
[37:35] morning no matter how loud I raise my
[37:37] voice about a Doctrine and what is the
[37:39] truth that doesn't make it
[37:42] true doesn't make it true just because a
[37:45] person says that and they could they
[37:46] could intellectually get you and and
[37:48] they could they could uh you know
[37:50] rationalize it with you and suddenly ah
[37:52] I get it 2 + 2 equal 4 and it must be it
[37:54] and I can see that it was adultery in
[37:56] the beginning it was in an apple and and
[37:58] oh I understand all these things listen
[38:00] to me friends brother Baron makes a
[38:02] makes a statement and I don't have the
[38:03] quote here but I'm going to quote it
[38:04] paraphrase it for you he says you can
[38:06] have all of the knowledge of the
[38:09] Revelation and miss the
[38:12] Revelation what a profound statement you
[38:15] could have the knowledge of the
[38:16] Revelation and miss the Revelation so
[38:19] you say brother the Matt what is it the
[38:20] message of the hour ago can I bring it a
[38:22] little bit further the message is not
[38:24] what I say it is right the message is
[38:27] what any man preaches no matter how I
[38:29] got all the truth and I've got the you
[38:31] know I've got the truth and and you got
[38:33] to come to me to get it and it's my
[38:35] Revelation and and I I got the
[38:37] interpretation on what brother randam
[38:38] says now you may have some of it you may
[38:40] have all of it I don't know but that
[38:41] doesn't make it
[38:43] true let me go further and say it's not
[38:46] my interpretation of what the prophet
[38:48] taught it's not my interpretation of
[38:50] what it says of what the truth is let me
[38:52] just give you something the lord gave me
[38:54] the truth speaks for itself
[38:59] the truth speaks for itself and when it
[39:04] speaks it's not in English it's not in
[39:06] Spanish it's not in German it's not a
[39:08] human dialect it's not a chalkboard of
[39:10] what I write out it's a Heavenly
[39:12] language to the heart that only that
[39:15] person can say amen I believe it not cuz
[39:18] Mom said or dad said or the bastard said
[39:20] but God has revealed himself to
[39:25] me right
[39:27] as the message as let me just go further
[39:30] and say the message of the hour was not
[39:31] William branham's
[39:36] message you say you're out on a limb
[39:38] brother man the message of the hour was
[39:41] not William branham's message he was
[39:44] just the messenger with the message from
[39:47] the
[39:48] throne this is why brother brandham says
[39:50] I wasn't the one you have it there on
[39:51] the slide brother John he says I wasn't
[39:53] the one that appeared down on the river
[39:56] I was only standing in there when he
[39:58] appeared am I'm not the one that
[40:00] performs these things and foretells
[40:02] these things that happen as perfect as
[40:03] they are I'm only one that's near when
[40:06] he does it I was only a voice that he
[40:10] that he used to say it it wasn't what I
[40:13] knew it's just it's what I just
[40:16] surrendered myself to that he spoke
[40:20] through it isn't me it wasn't the
[40:22] seventh angel oh no it wasn't the
[40:25] manifestation of the son of man you can
[40:27] go go to the next slide he says it
[40:29] wasn't the manifestation it wasn't the
[40:31] angel his message it was the mystery
[40:33] that God unfolded it's not a
[40:36] man it's
[40:39] God the angel was not the son of man he
[40:42] was the messenger from the son of man
[40:45] the son of man is Christ he's the one
[40:47] that you're feeding on you're not
[40:49] feeding on a man a man his words will
[40:52] fail but you're feeding on the unfailing
[40:55] I'm so glad it's unfailing
[40:57] body word of the son of
[41:00] man now you can take that to this
[41:03] ditch or you can take that to this ditch
[41:07] but true Revelation puts you right in
[41:08] the middle of the
[41:10] road John it's no more you say brother
[41:13] the mat the message wasn't wasn't we no
[41:15] no more than the Book of Revelation was
[41:17] John's book it wasn't John's book John
[41:19] didn't write that book John was just the
[41:21] Scribe Jesus was the
[41:24] author the revelation of Jesus Christ
[41:27] which God gave un unto him and this is
[41:29] John H this is the testimony of what I
[41:32] heard and what I seen so the truth
[41:34] speaks for
[41:37] itself right can you say amen amen so
[41:40] brother brandom says no no I'm just
[41:41] going to go a little bit past this so
[41:43] what is truth it's the word which is the
[41:45] thought of God expressed it's
[41:48] communicating a language that I can't
[41:49] speak though I use languages to express
[41:51] it but beyond my voice speaking to you
[41:54] the Holy Spirit has a voice and if you
[41:56] hear the voice
[41:57] behind the voice then you hear truth so
[42:01] we we could say this that's why brother
[42:02] Ram says above all else you should pray
[42:05] for Revelation for True Revelation in
[42:08] your life the Gates of Hell won't
[42:09] Prevail against you but you will prevail
[42:11] against them how many believe that here
[42:13] so God is a god of Truth the Bible says
[42:15] the spirit of God is the spirit of
[42:20] Truth the spirit of God is the spirit of
[42:23] truth I am the way the truth and the
[42:24] life so God functions in this I'm just
[42:27] going through this quickly if you just
[42:29] stay with me so God functions only in a
[42:32] realm of Truth whereas evil the Bible
[42:34] calls him the father of Lies so evil
[42:37] functions in distortions and perversions
[42:40] brother Brandon would say to take the
[42:41] truth and distort it but God functions
[42:44] in pure truth so the spiritual battle
[42:47] that you're in today is a battle against
[42:49] lies and Truth or a battle against Satan
[42:52] and the Lord as simple as it sounds so
[42:55] you can have the fact
[42:57] facts and not the
[43:00] truth you can have the gospel the facts
[43:04] of the gospel and not have the gospel
[43:06] itself to know him is life not to to not
[43:10] to know his word listen to what brother
[43:12] Bram says here and you could go to the
[43:13] next slide and he says he says as I've a
[43:16] often said I found two classes of people
[43:18] one of them is fundamental positionally
[43:21] he knows where he is in Christ because
[43:22] the word but he doesn't have any faith
[43:24] in what he's doing he hasn't received
[43:26] the Holy Spirit then I find the
[43:27] Pentecostals many of them has received
[43:30] the Holy Ghost but don't know who they
[43:31] are just like a man who's got money in
[43:33] the bank and can't write a check and the
[43:35] other one can write a check and got no
[43:37] money in the
[43:39] bank on he says if you could ever get
[43:42] those two together if you could get the
[43:45] Pentecostal to realize who he is and
[43:48] come back to the real full word of God
[43:49] with the baptism of Holy Ghost that'll
[43:51] set the world a fire again with a new
[43:52] Pentecostal revivor brother sister
[43:54] that's true listen in the next slide
[43:57] here uh he says some people make the
[43:59] gospel a funeral
[44:01] possession ditch
[44:04] one they go to church and just like it
[44:07] was funeral possession others make it a
[44:08] Frolic did you too some of them just
[44:11] make it a Frolic just a big time to go
[44:13] and play a bunch of music jump up and
[44:14] down on a platform Dance all over the
[44:16] platform down the aisle run sit down and
[44:17] talk about their
[44:19] neighbors some of them thinks that
[44:21] there's the other D some of them think
[44:23] that they ought to stand and say the
[44:24] doxology and the Apostles Creed and
[44:25] so-called keep going
[44:28] I want somebody to show me one thing
[44:29] written there in Apostles Creed I
[44:30] believe the Holy Roman Catholic church I
[44:32] don't I believe in communion of saints
[44:33] that's spiritualism I don't but they're
[44:35] so busy making those things up and they
[44:37] make it a funeral possession it's not
[44:39] notice he comes to the middle it's not a
[44:42] funeral possession and neither is it a
[44:45] Frolic it's a
[44:48] feast and a feast with Christ when the
[44:51] Believers come and
[44:53] die sir is it dead cold dry worship no
[44:58] is it just shouting and jumping like
[44:59] Pentecostals that's part that it is it
[45:02] is intellect it is
[45:04] emotion it's both don't don't do away
[45:07] with either
[45:08] one that's what happens today people
[45:10] want to cut things out why cut things
[45:12] out when God is giving you the whole
[45:15] thing some people cut out tapes we need
[45:19] tapes some people cut out preachers we
[45:22] need preachers some people cut out
[45:24] teachers we need them some people cut
[45:27] out this they cut out that they cut out
[45:29] emotion we need it some people cut out
[45:31] intellect and knowledge we need it no
[45:33] matter what you want to name here today
[45:35] they cut it out let me just say this you
[45:36] need the books you need the tapes you
[45:39] need your Bible you need preachers you
[45:41] need teachers you need to fill the Holy
[45:43] Spirit you need to know his word you
[45:45] need to say Lord I want everything that
[45:48] you want to give me I want to be a
[45:50] recipient of every single bit of it Lord
[45:53] let me make me a vessel that can receive
[45:57] all of it
[45:59] Lord and not just some of
[46:01] it so you can have information notice
[46:03] what brother random says here does go
[46:05] through these listen they're too good to
[46:06] skip over when a man is converted his
[46:08] eyes are set towards Calvary if he's
[46:09] just a little bit nervous if you don't
[46:11] watch him he'll go over to the fanatic
[46:14] side if he's just a little bit scholarly
[46:16] he'll go over to the starchy side but
[46:19] right in the middle of the road is the S
[46:22] sensible Born Again spirit-led endowed
[46:26] Church of the Living God going straight
[46:28] down the road to Christ notice how he
[46:31] says this that's the real coming
[46:36] from both sides one went one way one
[46:40] went the other shows fanaticism or
[46:42] either scholarly and too stiff to Bow
[46:43] you can go to the next one brother
[46:45] John he says that shows scholarly are
[46:47] too stiff to Bow they know more about
[46:49] the word than they know about the author
[46:51] to know the words not life but to know
[46:54] him is life to know him you don't have
[46:58] to be a scholar how many hands would say
[47:00] thank the
[47:02] Lord this is this is so profound I could
[47:05] preach a whole sermon on it you have to
[47:09] be a
[47:11] submitted
[47:14] person you have to be a
[47:19] submitted
[47:21] person so very different and how you
[47:25] live at wherever everybody sees you and
[47:28] everybody hears you and they hear your
[47:30] your your boast and they hear you watch
[47:32] your life it's so very
[47:34] different if you're a submitted person
[47:37] you see saying you believe something and
[47:39] submitting to the to that something is
[47:42] very
[47:43] different when you say you believe the
[47:45] message then you submit to him who the
[47:49] Lord hath
[47:51] sent right not to a man but through the
[47:55] voice of God that came through that man
[47:57] you surrender your
[47:59] ideas I take all of my theories and all
[48:02] of my ideas and all of my opinions and I
[48:05] come subservient to the word that's been
[48:07] revealed through a Vindicated
[48:11] Prophet you see that's submitting
[48:15] yourself Satan believes the word but he
[48:17] can't submit himself to
[48:20] it he says you have to be a submitted
[48:24] person and when you submit yourself to
[48:27] Christ Christ is obligated to F that
[48:30] vacancy that you've poured out on the
[48:32] altar to him he's obligated to his word
[48:35] to do it and he will not fail you the
[48:39] next
[48:41] Slide the Methodist said when we shouted
[48:43] we had it but they didn't the nazarin
[48:46] said when they lived holy they had it
[48:50] but they didn't Pentecost said when we
[48:52] speak in tongues we got
[48:55] it no no no they didn't see see notice
[48:59] the next one God unfolding himself not
[49:02] in
[49:04] Sensations now I want you to remember
[49:06] that word sensation you may think of as
[49:08] just shaking an emotion that sensation
[49:10] is anything on the flesh whether it's
[49:12] your mind intellectually your body
[49:14] speaking in tongues not in Sensations
[49:17] yet is with it and I love this you see
[49:21] the place it just gets so humble till
[49:25] anybody can see it
[49:27] if you don't try to put inject your own
[49:30] mind to it and your own thoughts it's
[49:34] God
[49:35] Amen now and then they become a bunch of
[49:37] Fanatics then here's the code formers on
[49:39] this side here's the Fanatics on the
[49:41] other side and here goes the bride right
[49:43] straight through it all calling from
[49:46] both sides God vindicating it as he goes
[49:49] along his word can we go just a little
[49:53] bit
[49:54] further you all right amen am so if you
[49:58] want Victory you've got to have truth
[50:01] not emotion not intellect you've got to
[50:02] have the person if you want Victory so
[50:05] in reality our scope of knowledge is
[50:08] very limited I don't care what subject
[50:10] you're an expert you can be called in a
[50:11] courtroom as an export witness and you
[50:14] could know a subject so well and study
[50:16] it and academically have degrees but
[50:19] really if you were to take all of the
[50:20] knowledge of man and you were to put
[50:23] everybody the greatest Minds we've ever
[50:25] had in all of history it would just be a
[50:27] drop in a
[50:29] bucket of what there is to be
[50:32] known so of what there is if all you see
[50:36] if is what you see then you don't see
[50:38] all there is to see so if all we have is
[50:41] what we see we really don't see because
[50:44] it's spiritual it's an invisible battle
[50:47] and so let me just say this I want the
[50:49] truth I want the whole truth and I want
[50:52] nothing but the truth help me God to
[50:55] have the truth as Jesus Jesus says no
[50:57] sign will be given except the sign Jonah
[51:00] so notice as Peter asked this question
[51:02] who is truth and so it's a question a
[51:05] philosopher if you study philosophy and
[51:07] I do not recommend that you do but if
[51:09] you do you'll notice that there's a
[51:10] there's a there's a constant refrain you
[51:13] hear from Scholars asking the same
[51:16] question what is life what is the
[51:17] purpose what is the meaning who am I
[51:19] what is real what is truth that's the
[51:22] question that they ask about religion
[51:24] one religion claims that there's only
[51:26] one God and then another religion claims
[51:28] there's 30 million Gods go study
[51:31] Hinduism and we're arguing over one or
[51:35] three and they believe in 30 million
[51:39] Gods so one says there's one one says
[51:41] there's three there's denominations all
[51:43] different interpretations and so pilot
[51:46] asks the same skepticism that many
[51:49] people today have what is truth how do
[51:52] you know how how do you find out who who
[51:55] really is the Arbiter of where can you
[51:57] go to to to find truth that the the
[51:59] answer was standing 10 feet in front of
[52:03] him that's right on the reality was the
[52:06] truth was right there but he's looking
[52:09] everywhere and the truth the Bible says
[52:12] even nature
[52:15] itself
[52:16] testifies and screams out to a living
[52:20] God brother bam says even the trees
[52:23] testify of the death the burial and
[52:25] Resurrection
[52:27] all of Nature and so the answer to this
[52:30] Jesus says I am the
[52:33] truth but there's a reason why that
[52:36] claim was so hated and unaccepted by
[52:41] masses talk about some isms today let me
[52:44] look at them if you have the slide the
[52:46] very first one rationalism so if you had
[52:49] asked the apostles or anyone in the book
[52:51] of Acts what they would have is a simple
[52:54] answer for you if you were to ask them
[52:55] what is truth God's word
[52:58] Jesus is truth no one questioned God's
[53:02] word uh and it was during the
[53:04] Reformation that people rose up and said
[53:06] you know TR truth truth isn't what the
[53:10] church says or decrees listen I mean
[53:13] truth truth isn't what the word what
[53:14] your Bible says but truth is what the
[53:16] church
[53:18] says and Men rose up and said no the
[53:21] truth is what the word of God says
[53:23] right then a few hundred years go by and
[53:26] there was a great shift in our world we
[53:29] call it the
[53:31] enlightenment I like to call it the
[53:33] endarkenment CU really that's what it
[53:35] was thank God for the enlightenment I
[53:36] don't I make a I'm joking but thank God
[53:39] we have modern medicine and things but
[53:41] really the enlightenment really was the
[53:44] darkening of man's mind that's why
[53:46] brother Brandon would say the further
[53:47] you move towards civilization and
[53:50] education the further you go from God
[53:53] that's right right true now now we live
[53:57] in an imperfect world and you've got to
[53:59] have education you've got to have
[54:00] science You' got to thank God for
[54:02] medicine but he says the further you go
[54:05] the further you go to to to science and
[54:08] education the further you go so the
[54:10] shift in our
[54:12] generation was truth is no longer it's
[54:16] no longer what what what God tells us
[54:20] but truth truth can't be truth isn't
[54:22] what the word says truth is what I
[54:24] discover it's what I find out I'm a
[54:27] human mind and I can find out for myself
[54:30] I can use critical
[54:33] thinking love that word I can love
[54:37] critical thinking God gave you a mind
[54:39] common sense and so we can find it out
[54:41] and to put it simply human reasoning and
[54:45] rationalizing replaced revelation of
[54:49] Jesus you no longer accepted what the
[54:51] word taught because it taught it but you
[54:53] thought it through for yourself you use
[54:56] your own thinking and and Truth is what
[54:58] I think it's the heart of listen that's
[55:01] the heart of rationalism it's what I
[55:02] rationalize it makes man his own God he
[55:06] could discover Truth for
[55:09] himself what was the prophecy of the
[55:12] generation you and I live in men shall
[55:14] become
[55:15] lovers of their own
[55:18] self they stand in the mirror and they
[55:20] say oh I'm so beautiful I just love me
[55:24] just look at me no it's not what it is
[55:28] it's man shall become lovers of their
[55:30] own
[55:32] self what they can learn what they can
[55:34] reason with what they can rationalize
[55:36] what they think I read a bumper sticker
[55:38] that says don't believe everything you
[55:43] think but they've so exalted the man's
[55:46] mind has been so exalted in education
[55:48] it's what I learned it's no longer
[55:50] accepted it's it's it's what I it's it's
[55:52] it's it's it's what I discover for for
[55:55] myself that's what's truth I don't I
[55:57] don't need you know I could use men I
[55:59] could use God I could use the Bible but
[56:00] I'm going to discover it with my own
[56:02] mind God gave me five
[56:04] senses and you know what that opened the
[56:06] door for science it's wonderful open the
[56:11] door for Science and Discovery and
[56:13] observation of what is
[56:16] true and so it it's scientific discovery
[56:20] let me say this most scientists original
[56:22] scientists believed in God they weren't
[56:24] atheist most original scientists you
[56:27] look at cernus and and and and men men
[56:31] like Isaac Newton these were men who
[56:33] believed in God the first scientists
[56:35] believed in God can you say Amen so
[56:37] science would believe in what he can
[56:39] learn Galileo believed in God uh bacon
[56:42] and cernus these were men who believed
[56:44] but notice Watch What Happens in that
[56:46] shift when they start to go towards
[56:48] education now there comes a question and
[56:51] it leads to them what we have our next
[56:53] ism is deism and deism is the belief the
[56:56] belief in the existence of a Supreme
[57:00] Being specifically of a Creator but one
[57:03] who doesn't intervene in the universe he
[57:07] created the term is used chiefly of an
[57:10] intellectual movement of the 17th and
[57:12] 18th century that accepted the existence
[57:15] of a Creator on the basis of reason but
[57:18] rejected belief in a supernatural deity
[57:21] who interacts with humankind it means
[57:23] God created the world but he doesn't
[57:25] control control the world it's just like
[57:28] a clock that he winds up and then he
[57:30] sits it down and it just sort of goes at
[57:31] its own pace he has no control uh over
[57:35] over it's like a watch that's wound up
[57:37] and can't be altered and and and and and
[57:40] and according to it it acts according to
[57:42] its own laws so while believing in God
[57:45] many of the scientists believe that God
[57:47] himself couldn't change nature can't
[57:49] control the order of nature so they give
[57:51] their minds to discovering the laws of
[57:54] nature and they became so proud of their
[57:58] own
[58:00] Discovery and by reasoning we became
[58:03] people in charge of our own Universe in
[58:05] order in other words the authority of
[58:07] human reasoning took over from the
[58:09] authority of divine
[58:12] revelation and this introduced the age
[58:14] of
[58:16] skepticism it's one that's prophesied in
[58:18] the Bible Skeptics would arise saying
[58:21] where is the promise of the father since
[58:23] our fathers have fallen asleep all
[58:25] things remain as they were right it's
[58:28] this age of skepticism that's prophesied
[58:30] also in Jude and so people never don't
[58:33] people don't just believe a thing
[58:35] because they're told they want to find
[58:37] out for themselves whether it's true
[58:40] whether whether really what they what
[58:42] they want to find out is does it appeal
[58:44] to my
[58:45] logic does it make sense to me you see
[58:48] that's what the problem when you lack a
[58:50] revelation of election and when you lack
[58:53] the revelation of the Plan of Redemption
[58:56] and when you lack the Revelation not of
[58:58] history but of his
[59:01] story and when you lack that view of
[59:04] time in the
[59:05] timeline then intellectually it doesn't
[59:08] work and that's why Jesus said God says
[59:11] through Isaiah for my thoughts are not
[59:15] your thoughts the word in other words
[59:18] what what he's saying here is I don't
[59:19] think like you think we don't even think
[59:21] on the same sphere so don't try to
[59:23] relate what you see naturally uh with
[59:26] How could a God who loves how what
[59:28] you're really saying is is I couldn't do
[59:31] that I wouldn't do that but God says as
[59:34] high as the heaven is from the earth so
[59:37] high are my thoughts above your thoughts
[59:39] we don't even think the same many times
[59:42] the way God viewing us is viewing a
[59:44] situation is entirely different than how
[59:46] I look at it right and so people know
[59:49] they appeals to their logic you know
[59:51] it's tragic it's very tragic when a man
[59:53] can only believe
[59:56] in the things that he
[59:58] sees
[59:59] intellectually it's a tragic thing when
[1:00:01] we can only believe that which can be
[1:00:03] intellectually proven or what let me say
[1:00:06] it even greater it's a tragic thing when
[1:00:08] a person can believe only in what they
[1:00:13] understand let me say this you'll never
[1:00:15] fully understand God or his word he's
[1:00:19] Everlasting and brother brandom says in
[1:00:21] the ceaseless ages to come he'll be
[1:00:23] revealing himself amen amen
[1:00:27] my brain just
[1:00:30] goes in fact what happens is the result
[1:00:33] of rationalism is that we become with
[1:00:36] the creation and we we become exalting
[1:00:39] of the created things or the things that
[1:00:41] we see and we forget the Creator as the
[1:00:46] Bible says they became vain in their own
[1:00:48] imaginations they worshiped the creation
[1:00:51] more than the Creator they became vain
[1:00:54] what does that mean it means
[1:00:56] intellectually that that they look at
[1:00:58] themselves say oh I'm I'm something I
[1:01:00] found something out I really I've really
[1:01:02] learned something this is what brother
[1:01:03] brandom stood against when you hear him
[1:01:04] talking about intellectual sermons and
[1:01:07] intellectual people it wasn't that
[1:01:09] intellect or knowledge is wrong is that
[1:01:10] they so exalt what they found or what
[1:01:13] they've discovered and they reject the
[1:01:15] revelation of God's
[1:01:17] word I can't understand it so it can't
[1:01:20] be true or no you got to explain it to
[1:01:22] me and if it understand and it makes
[1:01:25] sense and now go okay got it understand
[1:01:29] I remember in China there for a
[1:01:31] missionary trip and dealt with a kept uh
[1:01:34] ministered a sermon to a church women
[1:01:36] where there were two women pastors Lord
[1:01:38] opened their eyes showed them the
[1:01:39] message of the hour that they were in
[1:01:41] dresses and they came to me afterwards
[1:01:42] and said pray that God sends us a man to
[1:01:45] lead this church and in that sermon a
[1:01:47] little w a woman college student maybe
[1:01:49] in her 20s very not not didn't speak
[1:01:52] spoke perfect English she was Chinese by
[1:01:55] her appearance but she was born in
[1:01:57] America and very well educated she was
[1:01:58] going to college in Switzerland and I
[1:02:00] made a comment she said sir she said I
[1:02:02] just want to ask you a question because
[1:02:04] they had witnessed to her and brought
[1:02:05] her in she he said you said that the
[1:02:06] beginning in the beginning uh of the
[1:02:08] Garden of Eden it wasn't an apple it was
[1:02:10] adultery she said did you say that right
[1:02:13] I saides ma'am she said you said that
[1:02:15] right I said yeah she said I've never
[1:02:17] heard that
[1:02:19] before she said that's not what my
[1:02:21] church teaches I are you where are you
[1:02:23] getting that from is that that's not in
[1:02:25] the Bible
[1:02:26] I said we didn't have time I said 'why
[1:02:28] don't you do this and I told the brother
[1:02:30] I said' come back here and the Believers
[1:02:31] were all gathered I said' let's have us
[1:02:32] sit down with this sister and let's talk
[1:02:34] to her so we had met later that
[1:02:36] afternoon and she came she was very
[1:02:37] sincere she came and she sat down we had
[1:02:40] a round table maybe 10 or 15 Believers
[1:02:42] and they were all there and there was
[1:02:43] she was there and she had her Bible and
[1:02:45] she had her notes and her paper and
[1:02:46] she's like okay I'm ready I want to I
[1:02:48] read this I said now hold on a
[1:02:50] minute I Saidi want you to do me
[1:02:52] something I want you to do me a favor I
[1:02:54] said you see I could go through all of
[1:02:57] these scriptures and I could show you
[1:02:58] and I could try to train you and teach
[1:03:00] you and and you may see it and you may
[1:03:02] not see it and you may maybe and I said
[1:03:05] but you know let me just say this if
[1:03:07] what I'm speaking is true then the Lord
[1:03:11] has to reveal that to you am and I said
[1:03:14] I want you to pray before we start I'm
[1:03:16] not going to pray you're going to pray
[1:03:17] we're going to pray with you I said I
[1:03:18] want you to pray and I want you to ask
[1:03:20] the Lord and I want you to say Lord if
[1:03:22] what this man is saying is false if it's
[1:03:24] a cult if you don't if this is something
[1:03:27] that's a false Doctrine it's a heresy
[1:03:29] then Lord deliver me from this man amen
[1:03:32] and I said but I want you to pray but
[1:03:34] Lord if this is something that you want
[1:03:35] to reveal to me Lord then open my eyes
[1:03:39] and she said Okay Lord Jesus and she
[1:03:40] started to pray pray that same prayer
[1:03:43] open my bible take her to Genesis we go
[1:03:45] to First John we go all over showing her
[1:03:48] H Cain who was of that Wicked Wine and
[1:03:51] showed her the scientific evidence of
[1:03:52] twins being born from one man and and
[1:03:55] all of that and the whole time she's
[1:03:57] uhhuh um okay oh
[1:04:00] wow never seen that
[1:04:02] before hold on let me read that I had to
[1:04:05] read the scriptures and she's oh my
[1:04:08] she's writing
[1:04:09] notes and and she's coming through and
[1:04:11] we're sort of getting to the tail end of
[1:04:12] it and I take her from Cain who was of
[1:04:14] that Wicked one Oh you mean ah wait a
[1:04:16] minute he was of that Wicked one
[1:04:18] couldn't be evil no so who was that
[1:04:20] Wicked one that Cain was of of his prity
[1:04:22] of his of his offspring uhuh
[1:04:26] H and then I said now the last scripture
[1:04:29] I took over to Proverbs I want you to
[1:04:30] read it and so she opens her Bible she
[1:04:32] starts to read I'll never forget
[1:04:34] it such as the way of an adulterous
[1:04:38] woman she eateth and wipeth her
[1:04:42] mouth and she looked straight up and she
[1:04:44] said such is the way of an adulterous
[1:04:48] woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth
[1:04:52] and she said Lord Jesus I see it Lord
[1:04:55] you've opened my eyes Lord I see and she
[1:04:57] stood to her feet and you could watch
[1:04:59] the revelation of God start falling into
[1:05:01] that woman and her eyes that were blind
[1:05:04] could now see what was that it was more
[1:05:07] than me teaching or training it was the
[1:05:10] Holy Spirit coming and revealing himself
[1:05:13] to her and her submitting herself to
[1:05:16] what God had showed her oh my brother we
[1:05:18] can raise our children and teach them
[1:05:20] the truth and we should but we should
[1:05:22] pray God make it more than a knowledge
[1:05:24] make it more than what I train them let
[1:05:26] yourself be revealed to their hearts
[1:05:29] personally
[1:05:33] lord it's not what you learn it's not
[1:05:36] what academically you find out it's what
[1:05:37] the Lord reveals to you am I can't
[1:05:41] understand it so it can't be true I I've
[1:05:43] got to have it this reaction of
[1:05:44] rationalism is what called the movement
[1:05:46] the next one of Romanticism also called
[1:05:49] the Romantic Era Romanticism was an
[1:05:52] artistic literary Musical intellectual
[1:05:56] movement it originated in Europe toward
[1:05:59] the end of the 18th century and in most
[1:06:01] areas was at its peak in the approximate
[1:06:04] period from 1800 to 1850 some of the
[1:06:07] main characteristics of
[1:06:09] Romanticism can I have just a few more
[1:06:11] minutes is this okay so some of the main
[1:06:14] characteristics of Romanticism
[1:06:15] literature includes a focus on the
[1:06:18] writer or the
[1:06:19] narrator's emotions ah now we've
[1:06:23] identified one ditch now let's identify
[1:06:25] the other it's what I
[1:06:28] feel it it was the celebration of Nature
[1:06:31] and beauty and Imagination and and a
[1:06:35] rejection of of of of organized religion
[1:06:38] and rationalism and social convention it
[1:06:41] says humans uh aren't just thinking
[1:06:45] creatures we're feeling
[1:06:48] creatures we can feel reality and Truth
[1:06:52] needs to be felt in order for it to be
[1:06:54] true what is true is what I feel is
[1:06:59] true why don't you believe that I don't
[1:07:01] know I just don't feel like
[1:07:04] it and so there came a desire not just
[1:07:06] for a scientific explanation but a
[1:07:09] desire for an
[1:07:11] experience of things people want to fill
[1:07:13] it they don't know it's real unless they
[1:07:15] can fill it that's even the the test
[1:07:17] some people apply to worship it it's
[1:07:19] only good worship if I failed it well
[1:07:21] what if the Lord failed it and you
[1:07:23] didn't then that's real worship amen
[1:07:26] I can only enter in when it's real when
[1:07:28] I can really feel it well what if you
[1:07:29] don't feel it is he still God what if
[1:07:32] you don't sense him this morning is he
[1:07:33] still God is he still the same so you
[1:07:36] had the cold clinical rationalism which
[1:07:39] led to science as we said and then we
[1:07:41] had the Romantic Era which led to arts
[1:07:44] and the field of arts and painting and
[1:07:46] music and these were helped to helps to
[1:07:50] help us feel what's real and to feel
[1:07:52] reality and people look at the world and
[1:07:55] they and around us and they want to feel
[1:07:57] it they want to feel mother nature and
[1:07:59] they want to become one with it and oh
[1:08:01] it's an experience spiritualism came out
[1:08:04] of
[1:08:05] this if you can't understand let me say
[1:08:08] it this way it's like people today they
[1:08:11] they uh you know you have artwork and
[1:08:13] Modern Art and you have these pictures
[1:08:15] in this of this nothing and it's this
[1:08:17] splatter of paint and you think I don't
[1:08:21] understand it now you've understood it
[1:08:26] yeah but oh I don't get it now you get
[1:08:29] it you're getting it you feel it you
[1:08:32] feel that there been thousands and th if
[1:08:35] you're into artwork I don't criticize
[1:08:36] you this morning I'm not but that's
[1:08:40] okay and so you understand Modern Art
[1:08:43] because you've UND if you can't
[1:08:45] understand Modern Art then that means
[1:08:46] you've understood it because what it
[1:08:49] saying is the world doesn't make sense
[1:08:51] it's I look at it and it's crazy it's
[1:08:53] nonsense if you don't understand modern
[1:08:55] art or music than you don't than you've
[1:08:58] actually understood it because how why
[1:08:59] because I could feel it say brother man
[1:09:01] is that true it's true both were true
[1:09:04] remember
[1:09:06] hello rationalism says truth is what I
[1:09:08] learn or understand Romanticism says
[1:09:10] it's what I feel then Jesus steps right
[1:09:13] through the middle and says I am the
[1:09:17] truth I am the person it's not truth not
[1:09:21] the left not the right it's right down
[1:09:23] the middle of the road
[1:09:25] and it's not in what you feel it's not
[1:09:27] in what you learn he's not what you
[1:09:29] learn he's not what you feel he's truth
[1:09:32] and unless you have him you don't have
[1:09:37] truth so both of these isms bring us to
[1:09:40] the last which is the ism of relativism
[1:09:43] brother John relativism is what's in our
[1:09:46] day that's what's truth is not what I
[1:09:49] feel it's not what I learned truth is
[1:09:50] relative it's not
[1:09:52] absolute truth is not absolute it's in
[1:09:55] simple terms you really can't be
[1:09:58] sure you can have an opinion that's okay
[1:10:01] you can have as long as you
[1:10:03] specify it's just in my
[1:10:06] opinion in my humble
[1:10:09] opinion long as you specify and it's my
[1:10:12] opinion then you don't offend anybody
[1:10:15] but you try to make an absolute truth
[1:10:17] man you'll get everybody hating you what
[1:10:20] are you saying you say what are you what
[1:10:22] are you trying to say I'm just quoting
[1:10:24] what Jesus said
[1:10:26] well Jesus was a man for his time but
[1:10:27] he's not a man for our time you see the
[1:10:30] word is culturally
[1:10:34] conditioned it just means it was right
[1:10:37] for his culture but it's not really you
[1:10:39] got to sort of make it an update it
[1:10:41] brother Matt can't really it's a little
[1:10:43] archaic and you know the Bible's true I
[1:10:46] mean I accept the Bible I I believe the
[1:10:48] truth but you know brother Brandon was
[1:10:50] in a different era and you got to be
[1:10:51] real careful because we're different and
[1:10:53] you know it's a modern age and you sort
[1:10:55] of it's culturally conditioned you see
[1:10:57] the way of the world the way that demon
[1:11:00] Spirits want to water down and water
[1:11:02] down the message of the hour water down
[1:11:04] the truth of God's word but let me say
[1:11:06] this the watered down word will never
[1:11:08] get you in a
[1:11:09] Rapture the watered down word will never
[1:11:11] give it'll give you a religion it'll
[1:11:13] give you a nice form and you fit fit the
[1:11:15] attire but it'll never give you the
[1:11:17] person and I want the
[1:11:19] person oh you've got to you've got to
[1:11:21] it's a truth is just a consense all
[1:11:23] things are relative brother it's you
[1:11:25] know this is my opinion of the truth and
[1:11:28] that's my understanding that's my
[1:11:29] feeling and you know and but you may you
[1:11:32] may feel differently and you may
[1:11:33] disagree and you may have your opinion
[1:11:34] and you know what am I right yes are you
[1:11:37] right yes we're both
[1:11:39] right we can both be right why can't we
[1:11:42] all just get along why can't we all just
[1:11:43] be friends All Things become relative
[1:11:47] and and in s such an atmosphere you
[1:11:49] can't be sure of anything you you know
[1:11:51] what it is you have no
[1:11:53] absolute and you've got to have an
[1:11:55] absolute you've got to have a place you
[1:11:58] could take down and say this is where I
[1:12:00] stand this is how I raise my children
[1:12:02] this is why I live the way that I do
[1:12:04] it's my absolute it isn't the truth is
[1:12:06] not a consensus of what everyone
[1:12:08] believes truth truth speaks for
[1:12:12] itself in relativism atmosphere there's
[1:12:15] no such division as truth and true and
[1:12:18] false and right and wrong it's all not
[1:12:21] black and not white it's all gray you
[1:12:22] could never say that's wrong
[1:12:25] and just one example Islam has 99 names
[1:12:28] for God father is not one of
[1:12:32] them because Islam's the Quran states
[1:12:35] God has no Sons there's not a son he's
[1:12:36] never had a son yet we believe that God
[1:12:39] is a
[1:12:40] father because we are his
[1:12:43] sons in an absolute age one of those is
[1:12:47] true and one of those is false but in a
[1:12:49] relative age everything both of those
[1:12:51] are true they're just different aspects
[1:12:54] of Truth
[1:12:56] but the real question like pilate said
[1:12:58] what is
[1:13:00] truth relativist says everything and
[1:13:02] everyone's right the Bible has been
[1:13:03] questioned now as the absolute sourth of
[1:13:05] truth it's regarded as a record of
[1:13:08] relative truth the Bible as we said it's
[1:13:11] conditionally cultured it it conditioned
[1:13:13] it it it means that it's it's a reliable
[1:13:15] record of those in biblical times how
[1:13:17] they viewed truth but it's not reliable
[1:13:19] for me today it may not apply to our
[1:13:21] culture even Jesus was you know we got
[1:13:23] it we he was a man of his his time but
[1:13:25] not really of you know what you know the
[1:13:28] problem with this lack of true or false
[1:13:30] in belief is the is the lack and the
[1:13:32] lack of right or wrong is because that
[1:13:34] determines how you
[1:13:37] live and when you have an absolute truth
[1:13:39] that absolutely controls your life and
[1:13:42] that life whether it's pleasing to the
[1:13:44] Lord or not is how you live can you say
[1:13:47] Amen so it's no longer notice it's clear
[1:13:50] from the words of Jesus everyone that is
[1:13:52] of the truth in other words that truth
[1:13:55] is not something but rather it's someone
[1:13:59] amen truth doesn't come by scholarship
[1:14:02] or Superior human intelligence or
[1:14:04] research because it's a person and that
[1:14:07] person said no man can come to me except
[1:14:11] the father draws him first so what do we
[1:14:15] need brother Matt we need everything the
[1:14:16] Lord has given us we don't need to
[1:14:19] settle let me just preach to you just
[1:14:20] for a minute as I close don't let the
[1:14:22] devil allow you to settle for for
[1:14:25] anything less than everything God has
[1:14:29] don't let him get you in the right ditch
[1:14:31] and miss the left ditch don't let him
[1:14:33] get you in the left and miss the right
[1:14:35] let him put you right say Lord Keep Me
[1:14:37] in the center of your channel how many
[1:14:40] could pray that and say Lord let my life
[1:14:42] be in Harmony and in sync with your word
[1:14:45] Lord let me surrender and submit myself
[1:14:49] to whom the Lord have S I don't want to
[1:14:51] be on one side and then not the other I
[1:14:54] want to have all the truth the whole
[1:14:55] truth and nothing but the truth amen I
[1:14:58] want to have a proper understanding Lord
[1:15:00] let it be in the order of anointing
[1:15:02] anoint my faith to believe your
[1:15:06] word anoint My Flesh so that I can
[1:15:08] worship you in spirit anoint my mind
[1:15:11] Lord so that I can believe your word and
[1:15:13] believe your promises keep me from any
[1:15:16] distortions and let me live in the truth
[1:15:19] the whole truth could you stand to your
[1:15:21] feet musicians could you come nothing
[1:15:24] but the truth Lord that's our prayer
[1:15:27] could you bow your heads with me every
[1:15:28] head bowed every eye
[1:15:46] closed
[1:15:48] United under one God brother brandham
[1:15:50] says she said it's good to look at it
[1:15:53] brother brandham says oh if he can make
[1:15:54] you reason and out if he can make you
[1:15:56] think with your mind but God doesn't use
[1:15:59] a man's head God uses his
[1:16:02] heart God works on his heart while the
[1:16:05] devil works on his head God chose the
[1:16:09] heart the Bible says as a man thinketh
[1:16:12] in his heart so is
[1:16:15] he the devil uses your
[1:16:18] eye but when God can come to a
[1:16:21] man he comes to his heart and he lets
[1:16:24] him believe things by his heart through
[1:16:27] faith that his eyes does not
[1:16:31] see the scripture says faith is the
[1:16:33] substance of things hope for the
[1:16:35] evidence of Things Not Seen see God's
[1:16:38] working here brother Adams Point to the
[1:16:40] heart Satan's working here greatest
[1:16:43] battle ever fought it's happening in
[1:16:45] reasoning
[1:16:47] rationalizing listen friend you can't
[1:16:49] know Truth by uh I don't care if it's an
[1:16:52] emotional how good it was in ual how
[1:16:55] good it was and how well you understand
[1:16:57] it he's got to be revealed personally to
[1:17:01] you how many could just say Lord I
[1:17:04] submit myself I Surrender myself I want
[1:17:07] to be that submitted
[1:17:10] person and would you reveal yourself to
[1:17:13] me Lord oh I believe hands up on sincere
[1:17:16] Hearts all over this church right now
[1:17:18] saying Lord I want you to reveal
[1:17:20] yourself not by a preacher not by an
[1:17:22] emotion not by a workup not by elect but
[1:17:26] make yourself known to me Lord make
[1:17:29] yourself to known to my children to my
[1:17:32] family to my home Lord to my faith to my
[1:17:35] church Lord that's what we
[1:17:38] need brother Ram says too many times it
[1:17:40] pulls from up here when God says
[1:17:42] anything we don't look at it no more
[1:17:44] intellectually When God says anything we
[1:17:47] don't look at it no more
[1:17:49] intellectually we let it soak right down
[1:17:52] in our heart and call anything contrary
[1:17:54] to it as though it wasn't do you need to
[1:17:57] look at a promise this morning and say
[1:17:59] Lord you've said it I believe it that
[1:18:03] settles it I'm not going to look at it
[1:18:04] anymore I'm going to let it soak right
[1:18:06] in you're the one who gave the promise
[1:18:09] you're more than able to keep it he says
[1:18:12] that's where the world's so tangled
[1:18:14] today it's so much intellectual
[1:18:15] preaching instead of Spirit-filled
[1:18:17] churches worshiping in the spirit
[1:18:19] they're listening to intellectual
[1:18:21] messages and you can't reason this out
[1:18:23] there's no way at all to do
[1:18:27] it we got the best dressed crowds
[1:18:30] biggest organization smartest Minister
[1:18:33] we don't have a use for the holy spirit
[1:18:35] in that way anymore the way it was back
[1:18:40] there God our seminaries and brain of
[1:18:42] their being coming together discussing
[1:18:44] this thing more able more intellectual
[1:18:47] to set a church in order better than the
[1:18:49] Holy Spirit could do it so they don't
[1:18:51] need it any longer it's something that
[1:18:53] we don't need today it's the days of the
[1:18:55] days past we don't need the Holy Spirit
[1:18:58] to heal the sick we got doctors I'm
[1:19:02] thankful for doctors friends but we need
[1:19:03] the Holy Spirit
[1:19:05] still we don't need him to speak with
[1:19:07] tongues we're intelligent people when
[1:19:08] you do that you take right from your
[1:19:12] framework the
[1:19:15] lifeline we don't need this we don't
[1:19:18] need Old Testament prophets to set us in
[1:19:19] order we understand it and he said
[1:19:22] they've adopted a man-made system to
[1:19:24] take the place of the Holy Spirit but
[1:19:27] there's a people that's
[1:19:28] elected that has their names on the
[1:19:31] Lamb's Book of Life are you one of those
[1:19:34] people today friends he says there's a
[1:19:36] people that's elected and they can't go
[1:19:38] for that they're spiritually minded they
[1:19:41] can't stand for it no matter if their
[1:19:43] father and mother lived in whatever
[1:19:45] organizational Church they can't stand
[1:19:47] for that they stand for the
[1:19:51] word I want to say Lord Jesus I want to
[1:19:54] stand for you
[1:19:56] today Lord I ministered this message
[1:19:58] here because you Lord instructed me I
[1:20:01] just am your servant Lord now going to
[1:20:03] close my
[1:20:06] laptop Lord your word has went forth
[1:20:10] and it's a liberating word it's one that
[1:20:14] sets us
[1:20:16] free I pray Lord there'd be someone here
[1:20:19] today that could reach out in faith true
[1:20:22] faith and could grab a hold of it while
[1:20:24] it's
[1:20:26] here grab a hold of it Lord as as that
[1:20:29] little woman who had that blood issue
[1:20:31] grabbed the Hemm of your garment and
[1:20:33] said if I could just touch him if I
[1:20:36] could just grab a hold of him I pray
[1:20:39] Lord that someone in faith could reach
[1:20:40] out with that same faith of that little
[1:20:42] woman and say through their pain she
[1:20:45] whispered these words touching Jesus is
[1:20:48] all that really
[1:20:50] matters then my life will never be the
[1:20:53] same oh there's only one way to touch
[1:20:57] him you must
[1:20:59] believe when you call on his name Lord
[1:21:03] we're calling on you this morning we
[1:21:06] raising our hands Lord this morning in
[1:21:08] this church mothers and fathers
[1:21:10] ministers and deacons and Lord those
[1:21:12] that are listening online Lord may hear
[1:21:15] these musicians with their heart Lord
[1:21:16] lifting up their hands to say oh how we
[1:21:19] need you today Lord in this day age Lord
[1:21:22] of skepticism and relativism how we need
[1:21:25] a truth Lord we don't just need doctrine
[1:21:28] that's wonderful Lord we don't just need
[1:21:30] a dress code though that's good we
[1:21:32] believe in that Lord but what we need is
[1:21:34] the person we need the person to come
[1:21:37] and live in our lives we need the person
[1:21:39] to come and preach in our pull pits we
[1:21:41] need the person to come and live in our
[1:21:42] young people Lord that's the true
[1:21:45] Revival it's not the emotion it's the
[1:21:48] Revival making himself known to your
[1:21:50] children and with that comes emotion
[1:21:53] with that we lift up hands with that we
[1:21:55] raise our voices yes Lord with that we
[1:21:58] believe your word not because of
[1:21:59] anything within us or any any part of us
[1:22:02] that's good but because you placed a
[1:22:04] seed down inside of us before the
[1:22:06] foundation of the world and that real us
[1:22:09] believes this message with all of our
[1:22:12] heart give us that real something give
[1:22:16] us that something that takes us past an
[1:22:17] intellectual Faith as Peter had Lord
[1:22:20] give us that something that he says
[1:22:22] Silver and Gold Have I None but such as
[1:22:24] I have have I give unto thee what was it
[1:22:27] Lord you gave him a deposit an
[1:22:28] inheritance a down payment and we have
[1:22:31] it this morning Lord dwelling within us
[1:22:34] anything we need your Prophet said for
[1:22:36] this Earth Earthly Journey even the
[1:22:38] Rapture is inside of us right now may we
[1:22:42] believe it Lord God more than ever
[1:22:44] before may we submit oursel to
[1:22:47] it may we check all of our ideas and all
[1:22:50] of our own theories and all of our own
[1:22:52] opinions and all of the things we think
[1:22:53] Lord our Minds even our own minds Lord
[1:22:56] are just fragile fra Lord in vanity upon
[1:23:00] vanity Lord may we check all of our
[1:23:02] ideas and all of the things that we
[1:23:04] think and may we submit ourselves one
[1:23:08] individual could there be a father to
[1:23:10] say Lord I submit myself to the word
[1:23:13] that you've spoken oh would there be a
[1:23:15] mother would there be a young person
[1:23:17] here that would say Lord I want to
[1:23:18] surrender and submit
[1:23:20] myself to him who the Lord has sent
[1:23:26] Grant it Lord grant it
[1:23:31] Jesus Grant it Lord
