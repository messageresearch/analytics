TRANSCRIPT
========================================
tonight I have a small thought I hope that I don't take too much I was talking to the brother uh there in the back when I am uh down uh uh not in the Pulpit I feel like 45 minutes is not that long of a time but when I'm on top of the pulpit here it it it just seems like it's hard the time just went away ER now this evening I want to speak over something that I've been meditating on and although this uh month is almost the first month is almost gone of this year and but just let me tell you something uh a few years back I I would uh resist from believing in depression you and I would have a hard time understanding why people would be depressed or maybe I didn't understand them even though I had already gone through an episode of that and depression it is is it's such a sickness that it's already uh doing this this uh in humanity these end times and it's one of the uh spirits that is it's really attacking humanity and and it's a very deceiving spirit because it is uh creeping in little by little and it's making uh oneself believe that uh yourself is nothing you're not worth anything not believing in yourself uh believing that no one loves you it is a very uh astute spirit and it begins to create or it makes us uh to create that atmosphere in our homes uh in our room at work so that it can become a a real strong uh in in our spirit now if you look at a person that's falling into depression uh if you just go into h room one of the first things that you will notice that that room will be completely dark the other thing it will be disorganized and that Spirit BEC uh be starts to create that atmosphere every Spirit has a personality that we should know ourselves our our our very self that it is a spirit that begins to separate us from other people uh I'm not a psychologist and I'm not against psychology but I believe that God has given us a message uh so powerful and with better knowledge than from any psychologist so so we could know every Spirit every anointing uh one time we went to a home and they had they had asked for prayer for a young lady that wanted to commit suicide and speak speaking to them I I would see that the young lady would avoid what we were talking about and normally when there's a depression it's because something happened in their life maybe a deception perhaps some sort of trauma psych uh psychologically and you have to go to the origin but the only thing they would say is that just pray for her because she wants to commit suicide yes we are going to pray but thanks to this message that has taught us how to go and look for that origin of that problem until I asked them now is there something that happened uh during uh the time of her in her family and they all just looked out at each other until a person finally spoke they she said they said yes somebody committed suicide in this home okay all right so then I've I've asked the young lady what kind of music do you listen to heavy metal uh what posters do you have in your walls and she told me uh you know about this music uh I asked her does your room is it lighted no she said no so then we begin to speak we can pray for you and that spirit will flee but if you don't change that atmosphere that spirit will come back and it's not going to come back just by itself again to begin with you have to change everything that you are doing to cast out this devil take this power that it has over you because us the Bible says that we are children of a God that's orderly uh God loves order and and the devil disorder and we prayed for that person and we recommended that she makees some changes in her life a person in depression just look at them or look at yourself you become and start to be a person that's disorganized little by little now why do I comment on this about two years ago I applied for uh my license as an instructor um for barbering school in Texas and as I was studying this course I found out how important is to have a purpose and normally every time there is a cycle that is being [Music] closed uh every time that a year is ending we always make plans and uh purposes of what we're going to do for the next year and in this course I learned get by that for motivation it is good to have a purpose for it it doesn't matter what age uh you have it is always good to have a purpose that would motivate us because depression is really something else now a person that's depressed doesn't have any purpose in its life what purpose do we have for this year do you have one you should have one it's good as uh children of God we we have a lot to choose from whatever purpose we want you know I went to the dictionary and I really love the definition in Spanish in the dictionary and it says that purpose is is that is is that action or intentions to not do something uh to do something or do or for not to do anything because even uh a purpose if you say well you know what I don't have any purpose that's a purpose because you're going to have to reject a lot of things in order for you not to do anything but but then that's going to take you to a state of depression and not having anything that is worthwhile in your life what is your purpose for this year I believe as Christian families that we believe in this message we should have a an individual purpose uh individually and as a family also for which we all must do something and that it would keep us United all of us all of us are striving for a a a goal in our life what is your purpose now what is your purpose in coming to church uh to do something or not do nothing because if you don't do anything is there is a prophecy that must be fulfilled every time you come to church or you you come in better or you exit worse every time you come to church that has to be fulfilled that's going to depend on that day that you're going to come to church it's going to be fulfilled what is your motivation what motivates you what is your desire for this year when a year begins or starts uh the purpose or goal at least in Spanish is some of the words that you hear the most a lot of us ask ourselves what is your purpose or in other words what motivates you for the next year what is it that makes you feel alive what is it that you desire or want for the next year A lot of times we just don't have anything or a lot of times it's just well I'm just gonna live and that's it I don't believe that if you and I are God's children we believe in this message we should have uh purposes that should be coming uh like is it right off right right away or maybe in the middle of the year or perhaps until the year it's over because we have a God that planned everything before the foundation of the world he didn't leave anything to see well see what happens and we are his children and we should take his example brother brandham said plan like you're going to live for a hundred years but live like you're going to encounter God today but at times we don't even have a purpose I believe that it would be a good thing and it would be good to plan a purpose that would motivate us we uh I know that sometimes we're going to very difficult times that at times we just don't want to do anything but it's right there and then when that purpose should come out I've noticed that one of my purposes of last year was to start doing something for my family and I begin to uh do services at my home and believe me that uh the atmosphere at my home really changed quite a bit and I we did was just get together uh there in the living room that's what we do I'm not saying that you should do it that way I'm just saying what and sharing with you what we do and we're beginning to uh read book by book of the Bible we read a chapter uh each one then we pray and that purpose that God permitted us to fulfill last year even my character it helped me to control my character the atmosphere at my home now is different uh a lot of tensions have gone away just by doing something it's having a purpose as a family a goal what is a goal it is a terminology that it's uh that is for the purpose for is to have a career or a or a goal uh the term uh for uh a purpose and or a go they're almost very similar it's the same thing and we should have it and I really like this uh quote from brother brandham I'm going to read a quote from Brother brandham uh on this on on the on the book I am the resurrection and the life uh last year I had really really beautiful experi experiences with the Lord but my goal my purpose is that after reading this quote from Brother Bram it's not to uh lean on these experiences uh to look for new experiences with God this year Brothers brother Bron says uh today uh people depend on the experiences that they had like 20 years ago how many times do we uh remember all these experien that we had way before and then we depend on those experiences a lot of times we have an experience for example on a Sunday and then it's it's good enough for us and then a week goes by and then two weeks three weeks and then we don't have the desire to keep looking for these experiences with the Lord because we already had one I want a better year than the previous year this year I don't want the devil uh play with my mind and take me to that uh to to be happy with that of this experience that I had uh the previous year I want new experiences this year and better ones with him but then if we don't even have a purpose if if we don't even know what we want we're not going to go there look I'm I'm I'm going to with with this little uh piece of quote or this book as as I read as I read it it it happened to me like a a joke uh and it relates that there there was a a a boy that his father was living with him and this young man had some uh some people were going to come and visit him but his father was a Christian and and this young man was always yelling and every time he he'd make a fuss about he said oh praise God glory be to God and he or he would listen to something he would just shout amen and this young man didn't want his friends to listen to that so then what he planned he said well I'm just going to uh send my dad to the second floor that way when uh the visitors come in the friends they they won't even listen to him and then I'm going to put Discovery Channel on him that way he won't see nothing religious and that won't motivate him to yell or say anything about religion and then in this channel it just so happened there were uh uh there there was something like about to see and on this program they began to say and they would say that no one had even gone down to the very bottom of the sea the brother began to yell glory be to God blessed be God because no one has has found my sins the because that's where God sent them and see that's what happens to me at times when I was uh uh reading this book I identified as a Christian and what I want to be as one of my purposes for this year and it says on one of these paragraphs of this book and it says on this on this book uh a bar a barber an instructor for for being a barber now you tell me if a Christian should have this characteristics of what it says here he says as my career as an instructor uh in in barber in being a barber you will find yourself in the role of being a motivator uh an instructor Mentor a mentor amig friend disciplin uh someone who disciplines paciic a pacifier nego negotiator um refere a referee and also to take care of someone or to animate someone then I started to Rejoice I I don't only have to just do this as an instructor I should have had this characteristics as a Christian for a long time ago we were called if me and you have the Holy Spirit that we should have these characteristics we should be pacifi we should correct things with love we should guide someone even if we find someone that doesn't have a motive a lot of times what a person might need is that for someone to listen to him perhaps that person just wants to be listened to without someone judging him and that's going to help him a lot a lot of times you need to approach someone and just tell him you know be a comfort to him and I'm not talking about someone uh that's unknown or that you don't know a stranger but maybe our own very home a lot of times our children I am uh learning to uh gain the conf confidence of my son because when he makes a mistake I can correct him with love and uh maybe chastise him or punish him but with love without me getting upset I'm on my way to that because before I was quick to just get upset I wouldn't pacify the situation I want to calm the situation I'm not saying that everyone should just run all over me but but have the knowledge to know when how I don't think it's wrong for me to get upset when when it's wrong is how I react when I get upset because brother brandham says that when we get upset it is uh the beginnings of going crazy or insane if me and you get upset and we don't and we lose control we are going towards Insanity says here to have a motivation I really love this because when you have a motivation you don't permit anxiety for example to take a hold of you you don't let depression it says to have a fruitful uh modification you you must find a need a goal or a specific uh something that you need for that motivation remember one thing a lot of times we're doing the death walk just running around in circles and we say that we are believers and that we believe this message but then where are you going uh where God wants to no God already told you what he wants what is it that you want what is your goal what is the end it says here if you feel like you need a personal motivation there is some things that you can do so you can be uh positively motivated one of those things is do things that you like to do and right here I ask myself do I like to come to church is it a motivation for me to come to church because if it's not then I'm going to exit out of here worse than when I came in another the thing that it says here associate yourself with people that are you know uh positive they're they're positive and they actually have accomplished something in life uh associate yourself with persons that that that have accomplished something in their life do you want me to tell to you uh the Christian way uh associate yourself with persons that have the Holy Spirit because those persons are going to take you to succeed and a lot of times that's where the Christian fails the Christian fails that we don't want to leave our Social Circle that are dragging us to places that we shouldn't be there see that's right uh look at Abraham he was not blessed until he left of all his Kindred Family now he was called out to be by himself but he he he he brought with him a lot no I'm not saying that you know you should just uh go by yourself and just be alone but I hope that God will reveal to you what I am trying to say now it says here another thing it says eliminate the I can't do this from your vocabulary that's one of those things that's going to help us to reach our goals and me myself as a Christian that's what I lack most and I am defeated of that because it affects the faith of the Christian uh unbelief I can't just eliminate it because it's not what you are are it is not for what I am it is who is in me look there's there's another one the next one it says change the desire for the desire of I'm going to do it and brother Bram says H A lot of people just uh uh don't uh or don't know misunder misunderstand a lot of people the hope uh with faith change the desire or the hope for Faith and you you will see how marvelous things will happen it is not the same Faith and Hope principal and the main one identify the main principle goals of your life what is it that you want for your life in everything what is it that we want what is it that you want what is it that you desire do you have a goal I'm going to read a quote a quote then I'm going to read a scripture I'm going to try to hurry there are righteous people walking in the light of the Lord that's the kind of a home that God can get into now if you're serving bring all kinds of parties and beer and everything that's in your home God will never visit you there that's right but if you got a clean a a a home that's cleaned up and living for God with the prayer and Bible open and a few tear stains on it God can visit you and maybe we can say also I don't go to parties and I don't drink beer but there is other things that we need to clean from our homes we all know know that listen listen sometimes we forget let's read 2 Samuel 9 one [Music] second Samuel chapter 9 verse one I think this should identify every Christian and with this scripture we should take out any depression whatever thing that is WR wrong that is making us feel bad God says in this manner and David said is anyone here in the house of Saul here in the House of Mercy for Jonathan is anyone here in the serf in the house of of of God where Saul is called siba for whom you which are called in David the the the king said is it you siba and he responded you yes sir the king then asked him is anyone still alive from Saul's family if so I want to show God's kindness to them CRA replied yes one of Jonathan's son is still alive he is crippled in both feet where is he and the King asked in loar Zeba told him at the home of mck son of Amel so David sent for him and brought him for mck's home and his name was meth his name was m and he was Jonathan's son and Saul's grandson when he came to David he bowed low to the ground in deep respect David said GRE Don't Be Afraid David said I intend to show kindness to you because of my promise to your father Jonathan I will give you all the property that once belonged to your grandfather saw and you will e here you will be with me at the king's table May soet bow respect and exclaim who is your servant that you should show such kindness to a dead dog like me Brothers if you do not identify with him he was he was the son of a king meib said was was going to be the king he was the son of of a king maybe he wasn't treated as a son of a king but one day the king arrived he had mercy on him he called him to his table so he could eat everything that was on his table the same thing that the King was going to eat uho said was going to eat you and I are the sons of a king and we are called to sit down to dine at the king's table in Heavenly places that is the King's table what do you want we are in Heavenly places just depends on you what do you want that's already served on the table you're not outside anymore you're not out there eating what maybe was was there available it's you're here in Heavenly places the buffet is there what do you extend your hand that woman uh the one with the blood issue she was healed even the other woman that had her daughter which had Legions of demons she didn't have a promise she was a gentile she was treated just like a dog but her goal her purpose made her to be a to be a promise where there was no promise what is it that you want tonight uh we are just like said through our veins uh Emmanuel's blood flows perhaps we've been battered by life but we've been called to dine at the king's table now if you're not dining uh sufficiently or enough that's because you don't want to extend your your hand to reach out for whatever you need let us stand and let us pray
