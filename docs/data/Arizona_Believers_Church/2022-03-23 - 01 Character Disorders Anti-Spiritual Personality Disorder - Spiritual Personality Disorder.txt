TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ecclesiastes chapter one i'm gonna read verses one to three i'm gonna hold off on my title um for some time i will give it and maybe the after about 15 minutes or so just reading some foundational things here in ecclesiastes and i will say this it is a very a very unique subject matter it is one that i've been studying now for several years and maybe have ministered on just little glimpses of it uh in the past but god having dealt with my heart even recently on certain things he just gave me this complete liberty this week to minister on this subject and so i don't i'm just going to open up my heart and share share with you and then i i don't have any um i don't necessarily have any kind of long-term vision in terms of all the things i'd want to cover but we're just introducing something and i believe it'll be a great context for god to deal with your hearts but i do ask that you'd be very intentional and you're listening and if there's any kind of uncertainty or if you might feel a little funny about what's being said that i would trust trust the word of god trust the discernment you have and just ask god to place it just right in your heart to see it the way he would want you to see it and and i believe that god will bless you and i'm not going to provide the scriptures and quotes as i normally would in the slideshow because i just didn't want you to be distracted by any changes i want you to be very focused on the words i'm using tonight ecclesiastes chapter 1 verse 1 to 3 the words of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem vanity of vanity saith the preacher vanity of vanities all is vanity what prophet hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun very foreboding very dark gloomy vanity of all vanity of vanities say at the preacher vanity of vanities this repetition of it for emphasis all is vanity and then this phrase what prophet hath the man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun amen you can take your seats as we read these words and he uses these phrases and he's introduced as the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem widely regarded and we believe this to be solomon who wrote these things it is vanity of vanities vanity of vanities all is vanity there's really no qualification in terms of some some is vanity others are not vanity he's just saying everything under the sun is vanity and he makes this statement what prophet hath the man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun what does he gain what comes from it what real enjoyment does he get from it and i want you to ponder this um for a while i was thinking back in terms of some of the things we ministered last year and we looked at some of these very same scriptures about a year ago and i'm not wanting to look at a little bit differently but i want just to ponder it from a different perspective but these are the observations of someone who's frustrated with the pursuit of meaning and and i've just i've thought about it and just tried to enter into maybe the perspective of solomon not trying to draw from any kind of meaning of the words necessarily but taking the whole book together what is what's driving him to conclude this and you just get this sense that solomon must have let out a kind of a deep sigh and just was like you know what what's the point what's it all about what what's it all worth and he's expressing this uh a frustration with even his his pursuit of something fulfilling or something that gives it gives him happiness and joy and when he uses this word vanity and he concludes that all is vanity it's a very remarkable statement and i'd like to say this that it's not that he's making it an observation about creation or the purpose of god but he's just looking at man and what he's trying to achieve and what he tries to accomplish and the happiness he's trying to get out of everything he's saying at the end of the day what prophet hath the man of his labor he said that's the vanity so much given so much potential so much before us and everything seems to be vanity and vanity is something that's empty it's something that is meaningless the word speaks of meaningless and so he's expressing a sentiment of hopelessness and what i'd want you to kind of just think about the despair that maybe solomon is expressing in this as he's saying there's nothing gained in everything we do or at least we can say for himself now and we're looking at at the beginning of the book we kind of know where he concludes and we realize this has been a fruitful exercise so maybe i'll just say it now once solomon's gone through all of this writing he comes in and said there's nothing better than from someone just to serve god uh and so he comes to the right conclusion in the end but as he starts to go through the formula and put the pieces together he has this real internal struggle in this real wrestling he says there's nothing grasped there's nothing gained and what what do i have to show for all my labor and this is i want you to really grab ahold of this because it's not just solomon in his wisdom that's doing this mental exercise but in his wisdom he's a he's enlighten us to something that's inherent in every single person and it's a mark of humanity uh we are driven as humans to explain our existence with with respect to animal uh life and there's something i was uh pondering recently or had learned recently about animals and and and how that they have no certain senses and things that they don't feel like they have to justify and rationalize and they just can do what they're made to do where with humans we have to explain our existence we have to make sense of things if something goes flying through the air it may startle an animal but the animal doesn't have this sense of well where did it come from and where did it land and why was it doing that and what is it doing here but but we have to make sense of things and in phoenix i think it's on a cycle where every year we have to explain the phoenix lights and everyone wonders what are they doing there how did they get there what is this we're being invaded by aliens and that's just just our human nature to try to attribute meaning to things and and something and i'm not i'm not trying to i'm not i'm just making observations and i want you to think i'm trying to put any kind of spin on it but uh some very innocuous things can happen but we'll try to attribute meaning to it like oh hey did you hear that you know brother aaron used exactly 777 words in his prayer and try to attribute some meaning to it and it's like well no that was just luck you know right i mean we're just reaching for something there's times where we're really trying to attribute meaning and assign uh some purpose to things and in doing so we tried to this is for us personally i think that we're always in a position of uh in some way or another one of these three different phases we're either trying to find meaning and purpose in what we've experienced meaning and what we're going through now or in some ways meaning in what we're pursuing and we're doing that so that it kind of gives purpose to what's happened what's happening and what will happen so we can find some value in it and this is i want to say that that's with everything and then victor franco has made this it's been attributed to him and and i don't know that he makes the exact statement in his writings but it's been attributed to him and i think it is an accurate summary of some of the things he wrote that despair is suffering without meaning so when when you suffer and we understand that we're taught that you suffer according to the will of god and that we we suffer and god does it all with a purpose and so as christians we're we're very aware how that god has a purpose to our suffering and that suffering is to make us perfect and that there is through suffering god has found no better way to perfect our character than suffering and and and so we we have these things in our minds and they seem very relevant to us and and it's easier said than done right it's really easy to tell our neighbors in the apartment next store that when they're really going through it god's just perfecting your character and then when we're going through it we just lose all character i don't know it just doesn't make sense but yet we have some some understanding of the divine purpose of god as christians but so we so to despair would be to suffer without there being any value in your suffering or out without any meaning in your suffering so you have what he posits is that you have a choice then whatever you're going through as this free moral agent by free will you can choose to to have a meaning and you can you can choose to uh see that there's some meaning and value and even what you're suffering but now i want to point out that with solomon and this is the part that seems more remarkable to me solomon's observations are even more staggering because you tell someone who's suffering and if they could somehow find in their suffering meaning then it's not despair but solomon's observations are in light of even all of his indulgences you continue to read chapter two and all the things he has and everything he enjoys and solomon's not lamenting as job was on the ash sheep solomon's saying i've got everything i've got entertainments i've got food i've got women i've got wine i've got everything i would want he's still saying through that there's no fulfillment and it would be easy to understand um job writing these things it would be easy to understand victor frankel and his experience saying ah life is frustrating life is without meaning and and bad things happen to good people and to despair to some extent but here's solomon who has so many natural things tangible things at his disposal and he's saying hey they don't bring me any fulfillment and he continues in verse 14 ecclesiastes 1 14. i've seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit means it's a it specifically speaks of no satisfaction or fulfillment there's a striving there's a longing i'm not getting anything out of it continues in chapter 2 verse 17 therefore i hated life you could people who suffer extensively and endure injustices and things happen that are unexplainable we talk about attributing meaning and given explanation there's people that go through things and if we didn't have the word of god we'd be at a loss to explain it if we didn't have the word of god saying god does all things for a purpose and that these things strengthen us and god can use it you can be in a better position to help somebody else if we didn't have the word of god we'd just be like i don't know what to say i think in my family in flagstaff and some of the things that they've endured and if we didn't have the word of god as a typos and it's evident that they do and the way that they conduct themselves to their tremendous losses in their family but without the word of god i don't know what to say and you would understand why some would hate life this is solomon exercise solomon kind of expressing these things to us and again i'm glad he didn't stop posting after chapter two i'm glad he continued to write until he got to the end but he says therefore i hated life because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me for all is vanity and vexation there it is again vexation of spirit to be grievous it's distressing it's injurious everything solomon yeah everything what about those nice chariots that what about all the nice food that what about all the nice houses that what about the cedar's 11 on that everything the ointments the perfumes everything it's all vexing and this is man at his best this is the man of his riches this is the wisest man one of the richest most wise men and there's this a twirling this dissatisfaction and this disconnect now i know this is going to be a tremendous leap and i didn't do the math but i want to go from solomon in those days uh live and large and come all the way up to the time we're at now and there's not a solomon on earth right someone who would let's say in in the literal sense a real sense that there's no king in jerusalem there's no son of david and someone endued with the wisdom that he had and the the riches that he had and here is one that certainly if if money could buy you something and buy you relief and through wisdom you could find meaning and make sense of life then and solomon would have it then how worse off is mankind today than solomon was in his day i think i got you thinking and brother brandon makes this statement in the message communion one of the very last things he's going to share with us and it was so important for him to zero in on this he says as we and again i'm not providing these with you so you can just try to stay very open in your hearts and focused on what i'm saying so the lord could speak to it and he says we also can look around and see that the way that the human mind is leaving the people we might say losing their minds he says the human mind is leaving the people there is this loosening of wits and there's this watering down of rationale and you could you could you could try to figure it out from the standpoint of what's the cause and what has done this and and you can even look at societies at large that were non-christian and you could look at um the pervading of christianity and the imperialism that spread the gospel and you could try to just figure out some uh curve and how did this happen and how did mankind come to this place and and i know we often make the statement that things are worse now and it's never been this way but i mean man there's been a lot of insane people that have lived and they've done a lot of awful things it's not like just all of a sudden in in the in in the 1900s or the two 2000s that they figured out how to sin and commit evil but what you're finding which maybe could be isolated on a smaller scale and could be endemic within the catholic church and their crusades and the genocides that were accomplished and then the evils that are done in other societies and other cultures throughout time and history it just seems as if this madness that was within mankind on a certain level to perpetuate great harms against people that were weaker than them it just keeps getting sewn into nature to where now mankind all of mankind is losing their mind and it might and i appreciate the fact that on a wednesday night i'm speaking to those who can draw from such the rich teaching of the message of the hour to know that brother branham's talking about the world's fallen apart and and things are insane and all the things that are out of control and and i think it would be healthy for us to recognize if you have the baptism of the holy ghost then you are you have access to a right mind that other people don't have and i mean that and if it seems to be somewhat exclusive i i we could just take it right down to the to the word of god paul said if our gospel be hid it's hit to them that are lost well that's rough he's just saying if you don't see it you're lost and i'm saying that those who have the baptism of the holy ghost they have access to a mind a thinking a rationale a reasoning a stability that the rest of the world doesn't have and i'm not talking about people who are a murderous and vile and filthy perverted people that seem to be very sane and rational do not have the benefit of the wisdom that you have in the mind of christ through the new birth so it says the human mind is leaving the people he says we can't stay too much longer we'd be in a complete insane institution the whole world would be he says so we're at the end time and could it be that we haven't arrived to where the whole world has become an insane institution and we are unreasonably locked up in it and that's what the rapture is all about is letting the same people escape the insane asylum have you ever thought about how awful it would be if someone said hey that person's crazy and so they just went locked you know took you and threw you in and uh and uh put you know had to come under psychiatric care and they're just kind of like are you crazy no no i'm not crazy i don't know why i'm in here and the more upset you get the fact that they think you're crazy the crazier you look right i think this guy's crazy and the more you adamantly protest that you're not crazy the more more they're going to believe that you are they'd be kind of a scary situation but in one sense as he says hey we can't stay too much longer december 12 1964 we'd be in a complete insane institution the world would be an insane institution have we arrived at the time when those without the baptismal holy ghost are scripturally insane the decency has been lost integrity is honesty everything's turned upside down things don't make sense anymore so with this is my foundation uh brother john if you want to share this slide this is the last slide i want to share just so that you can get the title down but i want to start what i i'm using this this nomenclature in a way that i start in the segment so i don't know if it's going to be a series and i'll pick it up next wednesday kind of like kids eat free how many enjoyed last wednesday kids eat free all right a lot of hands those who aren't here kids eat free and and we used that was it like a segment and we did an installment on digging for gold i i want to do the same thing because i don't feel necessarily like i just want to pick this up every service but something i feel that we ought to revisit and so the the thought is character disorders and to tonight i want to just begin and i'm just going to touch on it just point to it say hey think about this anti-spiritual personality disorder and so if you want to if you'd want to write it out as a title you could say this is the first in a series or segments of character disorders and an anti-spiritual personality disorder as the title he's still with me all right because this is where i need you to be very very focused and and thank you brother john for using that i would i just if you've got that down if you need anything from me just let me know and i'll provide um some of these statements to your scriptures i'm going to give some background just to help you to understand how i've arrived at this and some of you may have some background already to realize what this might relate to but there is what is called the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders it's in its fifth edition now released by the american psychiatric association and uh i think is it the uh the dsm 5-5 i think is what they call it and in this when they released it in 2013 i think there's been some recent updates but i don't know how they codify it or how they make it official but there's 157 different diagnoses in this uh manual it's actually less than what they had before there's been some consolidation and some subcategories i believe but if you go through the list which i have there's a lot of a lot of disorders that they relate to um substance abuse uh substance in toxic intoxication from substances or even some uh some things things that are induced so abuse intoxication or even something that's induced by a substance and this is a number of different mental uh disorders that they attribute to some substance that is cause you to think differently alcohol and cocaine and there's a lot of different things that they reference in this so that's part of the 157 different uh diagnoses and then there's some others that relate specifically to trauma or physical things that happen to a person that cause them to think a certain way and and then also certain infections or diseases that might cause a mental process or way to think and i just mentioned that so that we could think very broadly at first that this is science remember this is me just saying what science is saying i'm not wanting to write this down as this is the gospel there's 157 and again try to attribute meaning there's a one there's a five there's a seven one god five's grace it look come on don't don't do that but there is uh it's just so you could think that there's this broad scope of man humanity i think i want to come back to this at the end so lord help me to do so man is trying to make sense of things you know this person these people act this way these people like this way and they have this data that they're accumulating over over centuries now in a sense and and they're saying well people act this way we put them in this category they're just trying to make sense of human behavior and it's really the best that science can do now in this 157 different mental disorders there's 10 specific personality disorders and don't get nervous we're not doing any diagnosing we're not going to pass out any quizzes we're not going to have a breakout session we have psychiatrists standing by right now and these personality disorders are divided into three different clusters again this is just me giving you background just so i feel like i can speak to you about this in a way that's spiritual and you understand where i'm coming from it's an abc cluster uh the a's and the c's we won't think about tonight i don't know if i'll ever mention them there may be the even more rare diagnoses and things very specific but there's a cluster called the cluster b personality disorders and now i'm going to summarize it this way they're characterized by impulsive self-destructive emotional behavior so it's impulsive self-destructive emotional behavior and i will say that even from a clinical standpoint actual clinical diagnoses of these things are rare and i say rare uh i i think even with respect to these 10 specific personality disorders it's less than two percent so can we all just start relaxing a little bit like that this is not not you getting discovered fine finding out you have a personality disorder we knew that already but it's impulsive self-destructive emotional behavior and sometimes incomprehensible interactions with others and then all of a sudden just got real incomprehensible interactions with others now this is a personality disorder this is clinical this is more scientific this is not me trying to instill in you some understanding when it comes to the word of god but let's just use this as a basis as a reference so now personality since we're talking about personality disorders and we're using the phrase anti-spiritual personality disorder i'm wanting us to think about a personality disorder personalities the individual differences in characteristic patterns of thinking feeling and behaving see there's individual differences this is individual specific to the individual this is subjective uh this is to you you're uh to who you are as a person you're thinking you're feeling and behaving and the way that they uh the even the the psychiatrist would look at it is that it's a kind of a coming together various parts that make a whole person so personality is it's recognizing different things work together to make a personality and there's different ways that they study it from different perspectives but it's just different characteristics of thinking feeling and behaving and now on personality brother baron says you cannot be a person without being a personality so if you are a person you you have a personality and if you are a personality you are one personality to yourself you are a separate individual being so personality relates to an individual there's something i i wanted to say very unique about being an individual but that's kind of like stating the obvious but uh when you look at the word of god and how the revelation the new birth is a personal revelation of jesus christ or revelation jesus christ personally to you there's something very beautiful about the person about the individual that that god does not want to sacrifice in in the whole so we think about the bride of jesus christ the bride of jesus christ your identity and recognizing who you are and becoming the the the overcomer and the powerhouse of god's spirit that's for you individually and it ought not to be lost in the church movement or the body movement or the bride movement it's for you individually and there should be some personal ownership of it to where it's like everything everything around me god would desire that these things that are being achieved around me would have some impact in me individually that i could come to the place that god wants me to be and not just settle for a while i guess it's not for me i guess it's not for me it's guess it's not for me and just rejoicing if it's for everybody else but there's got to be something inside of you that recognizes god has something for you and i want it and he wants to give it to you and so he's saying you cannot be a person without being a personality then the most uh frequent place you come across brother i'm talking about personality or i say frequent but most pronounced is when he refers to the godhead and in the church age book he's writing in chapter eight he says indeed the godhead is not three per a a three-person god with one personality if it takes a personality personality to make a person if there's one personality there is but one person so your personality is who you are can we just think about that for a moment when the bride recognizes who she is is kind of the wording we use and what she is and what she stands for it's who she is as a person what her personality is it relates to the individual recognizing who i am as a person and there's a personality a personality makes a person and and so that's what we're thinking about when we think about personality it has this it may have some scientific clinical application but i'm a person you're a person we are we all have a personality that's what makes a person and it's precious in the eyes of god it's something he watches out over it's something i believe has been stated before that you notice that god uses the spirit of elijah five times there's something about that personality there's something about that nature and those characteristics the way of thinking feeling and behaving that god likes where he would use it five times it has to do with personality so if it's a personality disorder a disorder is a group of symptoms involving abnormal behaviors or psychological conditions so disorder they're looking at a group of symptoms that relate even to abnormal behavior or some condition of the mind the thinking that would be a disorder another way to describe a disorder would be some sort of intense distress persistent or intense distress if you're going through in some sort of moment where there's this intense distress uh from a clinical standpoint so that's a they could diagnose that as some disorder because it's something very intense or persistent or a disorder can be described as a disruption of the psych physiological functioning so it's something in the mind the way the mind's working the mind the way some interruption i said well he's not thinking properly he's not acting properly and i don't even know if this is something that's i guess it didn't memorize the list of 157 things but they've they recognize that there's even these what they call disorders where people something happens and they clearly begin to behave in an abnormal way inconsistent with even their own pattern of behavior or something that would not even be socially acceptable and while they're acting that way they recognize something's not clicking in their minds and they're and they're behaving inconsistent with what would be right what would be acceptable and so these are things that they would call a disorder now this i'm just giving you background and i appreciate just the open spirit tonight to share these things i i realized too that perhaps think these are things i've studied for years and felt there's such a important important things to talk about because listen the world's talking about all time right how many of us had things said about us labels put on us categories were put into things we're processing things we're thinking about trying to make sense of our lives and all we have is the dsm-5 to grab grab to make sense of life and what i'm wanting to do by this is let you know god knows better than they do that's what i want you to reckon this god knows better than they do and i'm wanting to i realized i'm going to run out of time tonight but if i could say it now i'll have maybe a piece if i have to leave off short is that the world uses a language and things are said and there's a common vernacular that's used today uh whether we talk about gaslighting or triggered and social justice and cancel culture and all these phrases that are used and i want you to realize that by the word of god we can bring it back to what it really is and find the right approach because solomon and his lamenting recognize there's nothing new under the side and nor is there today anything new that god's word hasn't already uncovered or spoke to or can address so that with that background of kind of the academic scientific stuff and if you didn't get anything out of it i hope you know that's fine you're just listening to me kind of walk you through how god has dealt with my heart and so this is where kind of things got quickened to me here recently as i learned of a kind of a consistent misunderstanding of the anti-social personality disorder or even the phrase that someone is anti-social and it might be used in describing a psychopath or um someone's a sociopath they might use this phrase they're anti-social how many have heard that before anti-social now when we think anti-social and and i recognize i think that this exists this understanding exists to a very large degree with most people that anti-social means they don't like to socially interact or that anti-social means they're a loner or they're an introvert and so uh this is this is kind of what we think anti-social is but that's not what anti-social is at all and this is where i i hope it kind of starts to get interesting we think a person if they're in this particular category of a narcissist or whatever and they have these anti-social personalities we're thinking oh they're just alone or they keep to themselves they're a hermit they're quiet no to be anti-social is not that at all but this is a way that i uh it was phrased and it caught my attention anti-social personality disorder they have a disregard for laws norms and rules of society and they they believe that these rules don't apply to them and it was put in this way that someone who has an anti-social uh personality disorder or is antisocial is a part of some other uh pattern of behavior it's they're not it's not that they don't socialize sometimes they are the most social sometimes they can be the most charismatic or engaging it's not that the hermit in the corner they don't have don't have a way of communicating they don't have a way of engaging they don't have a way of getting you excited or talking to you but the what makes them anti-social is they disregard laws they disregard the rules of society and they they don't think they apply to them so they think they can do things and they can get away with it or it doesn't matter it doesn't apply to them now i think you're really getting you can really start to think and this is where i thought of a spiritual application of this i thought of like a the word view of this i thought my in the sense that some people are not anti-social and that the anti-social person can be very social but the anti-part is they don't regard what the actual rules of being social are society it's anti-society they can be very involved in society but they're actually working against what the norms and expectations and rules are of society now think of it in a spiritual sense there's a lot of people when we think anti-spiritual we think oh they're carnal they're not spiritual they're not religious but on the contrary someone who's anti-spiritual can come off as very spiritual very engaging but they're not operating according to what the norms of the capital s spirit spirit is singular spirit all right i just gave you it all there that was now you know what i'm going to be amplifying now for the next several minutes now let me just read to you a very uh the the definition of the anti-social personality disorder we kind of touched on personality disorder now the anti-social aspect the presence of a chronic pervasive disposition to disregard violate or disregard and violate the rights of others we're kind of piggybacking a lot of momentum we have on some of the things we've ministered for some time now a chronic or pervasive disposition to disregard or violate the rights of others that's someone who's anti-social manifestations include repeated violations of the law exploitation of others deceitfulness impulsivity aggressiveness reckless disregard for the safety of self and others and irresponsibility accompanied by a lack of guilt remorse and empathy you know i don't think we have to try hard to see the the the biblical characteristics being brought out i don't think we'd have to try hard to be able to flip through the word of god that's that's in the word of god that's in the word of god a lack of guilt a lack of remorse a lack of empathy the disregard for the safety of others irresponsibility someone who is exploits others deceitful impulsive and repeated violations of the law and these are things that we say are often said with a psychopathic personality or even a sociopathic personality some will bring a distinction between the two but there's a lot of overlap and they say about this is what i thought was very interesting when it comes to the anti-social personality sorts one of the most researched disorders that there are there are today one of the most researched disorders and they say the most difficult to treat they don't know how to treat it well if you just pick up another manual right their manual well we can we can diagnose it all day long but they don't know how to treat it because i think at times they're just not willing to consider the cause so this was this is kind of my thought is it i'm just you're walking it's very unique service for me i'm just kind of walking you through my thought process as god has done with my heart there are natural even if we look at character disorders specifically there are natural and spiritual applications of these principles and i'll say both in the natural and spiritual the word is for both and they're not in natural there's actual natural circumstances uh there can be actual mental conditions that need healing there can be actual uh disorders or disruptions or patterns of behaviors infections addictions all these things that need attention that need deliverance that need to be dealt with and i believe the word of god does so and then there's the spiritual the spiritual side to it this is the part i think may be hard for me to express even as because i want to be very i want to be very careful with how i express it i want you to be able to have some understanding in your hearts how god would want to make this applicable for you but maybe making kind of a a another side of this spiritual side there's issues that relate to the expression of christian character that could be used in similar terms that there's there's a way that we ought to be living walking in the spirit the fruits of the spirit conducting ourselves in the nature and the personality of jesus christ there's something about the way that we ought to be living and expressing christian character to where we could borrow from some of these uh natural things just like you could have um a spiritual amnesia right we recognize there's a spiritual amnesia where somebody doesn't recognize who they are and it's that we see this type in the natural someone has a head trauma they have some sickness and they forget their past they forget who they are there's a spiritual side of it i'm looking at this in the same sense there can be a spiritual amnesia that there's a spiritual application of some of these disorders and i'm just using that language to use things that are maybe familiar to us today to get our attention to what the word of god is supposed to produce in our lives and so my inspiration was when i heard this with spiritual disorders when i thought of how in the context this to be anti-social didn't mean you were withdrawn or you're an introvert it just meant you didn't operate according to the rules and the laws and you violated things and it was this kind of aggression against what was expected and what was right immediately thought oh they're spiritual disorders and i thought there's types of these things in the word of god and so i would even say that maybe we could ask ourselves are there types of these things in the word of god and to this specifically this is what's been a very beautiful study for me personally is actually identifying these disorders in the bible you ever thought about that in terms of the things we hear today and well this person has you know they need to have their appendix removed and you flip through the bible and you try to find where they talk about someone with an inflamed appendix or did anybody ever have an ingrown toenail or did anybody have this and where's the cancer in the bible and you try to find things and there's certain things we wonder we have a language today in a way we describe things today even ways that are recorded for us in the tape lines of all this diseases and situations that brother branham faced and the terms that he uses to address these spirits and you think mike what what about today that the diseases we have the sicknesses we have the diagnosis we have the terminologies we use and you can go back in in the bible and read these stories and find characteristics and and the nature of people and say oh that's the classic case of this matter of fact when i originally was going to preach this last year is going to be don't be a narcissist that was going to be my title don't be a narcissist because you can find it in the word of god the bible is basically telling you you know don't be a narcissist don't be rude don't be insensitive and so i started thinking about these characteristics in terms of the scripture the fruits of the spirit are we able to identify in the bible people that today science would say had some diagnosable mental disorder like where you think you speak of legion and we recognize that he is possessed with devils and to a to a practitioner they might look at him and say well he has this problem this problem this problem we never call it a devil they'd never call it a demon this problem this problem this probably had this in his past these things have happened and then when they happen upon him later on they and they see him dressed and clothed and eating they would say he's in his right mind just as they did in the scripture they say well he's no longer he's no longer acting under these impulses he's no longer he's actually been cured or this is something that's intermittent or something that comes and go and this would be something that they a practitioner today would begin to look at things in the scripture and say oh this is a this is a case of this and you start looking at some of the personality types in the bible and there's some really rough characters and then it crystallized to me as i was thinking how how do i express this how do i share the share this to the people and it just struck me that in the context of our crystallize in the sense of our birth and our character that by natural birth we are endured with certain inherent inherited characteristics and there's a lot of science that says your personality is dictated by your genes by what you inherit from your parents and and and we could say that we recognize that there ha there's there's certainly a truth to that and then kind of your characters developed in that in the environment so it's sort of this expression within these parameters of who i'm going to be and what i'm going to become and then a person as they grow they that you know their character this is what they are this is how they live and and so i see that in a spiritual sense our birth and our character and so and and i want to say this that i believe the bible the bible and i'm not going to have time to get to some of these scriptures the bible addresses the human condition and by human condition the weakness of the mind the susceptibility to spirits the the tendency to think negative and the the the uh propensity to perceive things in a way that's not true the bible's telling us that how deceitful the heart is and it's it's even dividing between the soul and the spirit it's the the bible is the best manual the best book and so it it became pronounced to me that not what we're not necessarily looking at personality disorders because maybe that's a phrase for us that seems to be more uh uh with medicine and science but it's okay it has to do with character and this is how the apa defines character the totality of an individual's attributes and personality traits particularly moral social and religious attitudes and they say it's often used synonymously with personality so the phrase that i want to use with you the subject that i hope to explore at times together is character disorders and that would be abnormal behaviors or mental states abnormal behaviors or abnormal thought patterns that are not in harmony with what the word of god says a christian ought to have persistent or intense distress disruption of spiritual functioning hey we've experienced that this week haven't we we found ourselves this week not feeling like we were in the spirit not feeling like we had the right attitude you might think the way you said that didn't seem to have the fruits of the spirit what i'm trying to say is there's times that we don't feel like we're very spiritual there's times that we feel like i don't really have a lot of faith there's times that you ought to just grab your family's hands and get on your knees and pray you know is i don't really feel like that right now and what would that be there'd be a disorder something something's been disrupted something's not right and if i could say this and i i mean this was with as much uh uh thus saith the lord that i could muster it's important that we begin to recognize the factors and influences that are working on us to create the incongruent expression of the holy ghost we have and no longer be beaten up to question our experience but to start denying the lies that are keeping it from manifesting the way that it ought to it seems as if the devil just wants to constantly keep us in this cycle well you just must not have the holy ghost and i'll say right now if you don't got it you need it because no amount of teaching and babying and medicines and diagnosis is going to help you until you get the new birth and i am going to come to that hopefully here in a minute you're going to you're going to need that you're going to need that birth but what what would be worse i say it's certainly awful that someone who doesn't have the holy ghost would be tricked into thinking they have it would we say that's awful it's equally awful for someone who has it to constantly be told they don't and there's and there's an equal detriment and and so this character disorder it could either be exposing the lack of a birth or it's showing that you must grow from a child to maturity you've got to be growing in this experience brother branham says and this is just to kind of amplify character some man is not measured by how much his biceps are how big a muscle he is he's measured by his character let's say this way that we're going to measure man by his personality so the the apa would get out their dsm-5 right and they would kind of look at your attributes your characteristics what you're going through what you've been kind of tell me let's let's diagnose let's look at these symptoms let's look at these characteristics these things that have been been expressing and they're going to take the word of god or they're going to take this their manual and look at it and try to assess your personality and give you a label and tell you you know what what characteristics you're exhibiting so they can even say well even though you may not clinically be diagnosed with this disorder you're exhibiting certain characteristics associated with it they're going to try to put some of these labels on you but brother branham says and character comes from the word of god and that alone we're not using we're not using the methods of science we're not using the tools of psychiatry we're not using what's available to us in the world today to determine who we are as people to find my category to find my identity but we use the word of god to determine what character we have even if it's defined that we line up short in one way we could just compare ourselves to the world and leave tonight and feel pretty good about ourselves right but we don't want to just compare ourselves to this church or that what this was doing that one's doing uh we want to compare ourselves to the word of god he says character comes from the word so there is a proper measure of what the right character is there's a proper measure of what the wrong character is if somebody acts contrary to the word of god that is disorderly that is something contrary to the spirit because the spirit acts according to the word brother branham emphasizes it over and over and over and over again he says the spirit will not act contrary to the word someone says i got the spirit i'm enthused with the spirit i'm speaking of the spirit but speaks contrary to the word he says that can't be the spirit and so they look at what would be this baseline average temperament of a human being or what's socially acceptable or what we consider to be normal and they look at someone's pattern of behavior and they consult their manual they say oh they're deviating this is more akin to this this is not normal this is a disorder this is a disorder we want to judge ourselves by the word of god to know whether or not the word is working in us in science a personality disorder is considered a type of mental disorder this is in science but let me say this in life a character disorder is a type of spiritual disorder that can be remedied by the word i don't mean to take away from any anything that would be of a benefit that could be scientifically prescribed or medically prescribed i i i believe that the message of the hour teaches us a very positive balance on medicines positive balance on vaccines positive violence on hospitals and doctors and and things that can help us there's a very positive balance in the message of the hour and and if someone in it with their brother ram said when you're sick your first duty is to go to the doctor that's what he said and so in doing so i would not want to take away at all that doctors can prescribe things to help people through anxiety and help people through difficult situations help them to alleviate pain but what i would never want you to forget is that the word of god can heal the person so that they never need them again sister naomi was diagnosed with the peanut allergy right and basically talk about something that could follow your whole life she believed for her healing and guess what the power of god delivered her from it this is a diagnosis this is a this is some people can be a sentence you know you have to live your whole life and you can't eat this you'll have to live your whole life and be worried about that and this is something that the word of god remedied so there can be in life there can be what the world would call a personality disorder but the word of god can come and bring order where something's wrong bring healing bring deliverance ready the mind stabilize it and i'm not suggesting that there needs to be any kind of clinical diagnosis because as i mentioned earlier actual clinical diagnosis of these things is rare very rare but what i'm wanting to also i guess what i'm wanting to consider in the terminology is that there are some people that are religious psychopaths and you shouldn't be one there are some people who are spiritual psychopaths anybody with me i want you to think about this for a moment because we're not thinking in the sense of and i'll get into it more later because sometimes we think psychopaths are thinking right but in a spiritual sense if somebody assassinates your character right i think somebody told me here recently about the phrase you know why don't you just bury the hatchet and it's like well if you'll help me get it out of my back you'll just help me get the hatchet you dug into my back out maybe we can bury it why because there's some religious psychopaths and a psychopath a psychopathic someone who's a psychopath they have antisocial behaviors they lack empathy and they have a disregard for others and they exhibit narcissism so to be psychopathic if i could use this as an example a psychopathic sees morality as a colorblind person sees color so now if you begin to think in a spiritual sense what a psych and even some would argue that a psychopath or even a narcissist or these people with these disorders they have their own moral code or their own moral system and their own values and they just operate by different rules and they're going to hold you to some rules and this is kind of the nastiness of it even in reality but a colorblind person's unable to see color a person who's psychopathic is unable to see moral values and obligations and their responsibilities they just don't see it they just don't see that it applies to them they don't see that they have a duty they have a responsibility they don't see that they're accountable they don't see that they should have to answer for what they say and what they do they just kind of live and act in such a way to where none of these rules apply to them anymore and what we're wanting you to consider is how some people can come across as very spiritual very religious very social very ardent believers but when it comes to following the word of god and the things that they even say in the way that they judge others no longer applies to them if that's the case they're a religious psychopath it's i i know i know it's maybe a little bit of a attention-getting statement but i want you to consider it because that's how it struck me is god help us to never be the kind of spiritual psychopath where we can talk the message be very ardent supporters of it and pay it a lot of lip service then act completely inconsistent with it and that has done the greatest harm to the message of the hour is is the the hypocrisy and and the intense brother brother lowell now we're speaking about it in the office and it's something that i i i want to be very careful to express because it's something i just put aside tonight because i wanted to be able to articulate it very faithfully but we've we've taken being right because if we believe we have truth in the message of the hour it's changed toward we believe we're right and we're no longer connected to the truth we're more connected with the idea that we're right and then what we've done is we've let us be in right serve in the place of being in the spirit and having the spirit of christ and we've substituted being right with being in love and we lose our first love which is christ the word but we still believe we're right and then when we we assert our moral authority and we assert that we're right it's completely detached from the spirit and love and it never quite works out the way that we think it should so what do we say well they're just serpent seed it's just the devil right because we've detached spirit from truth because we're not even dealing with spirit and truth anymore we've we've relegated ourselves to right and it's not speaking the truth as love it's speaking the truth in love just speaking the truth and reading quotes and say well brother brown said it it must be the truth that's not that's not truth it can't be truth unless it has the nature of christ behind it how could we stand in the place of god and judge people and tear them down and look down on people and say well it's the truth isn't it when we don't have the foreknowledge we don't have the understanding of what has been and what will be we cannot stand in that place therefore we're responsible as believers of recognizing truth and being lovers of truth and be married to truth and being faithful to truth and let god decide who's right i'll just end on that i i'm not going to touch on the anti-spiritual personality disorder but i will say this just to get you thinking what i was wanting to express is that it's something incongruent with the spirit you may not be clinically diagnosed with it but let's become available to god to show us whenever we're acting anti-spiritual we may be far beyond ever being antichrist right we're just so settled in it we know our calling we know our election we're far beyond ever being antichrist but god help me to not crown my life with a spirit that's contrary to the nature of christ anti-spiritual is not someone who is carnal or appears unspiritual someone antichrist or unreligious is somebody who presents themselves as very spiritual but their lives and their attitudes and their actions are incongruent with it but the branham said and i have to say this before i close so that you don't lose sight of this he says you're a different person a different personality because you're a new creation when you're boarding in new personality new person and then the greatest battle ever fought starts between the old man and the new man and let's never justify the old man let's lift up the new man don't justify the old man lift up the new man i'll just close with this psychiatric labels these things i have to just share this in my heart i've left out a lot tonight i guess i realize now uh maybe even in that wisdom is not having a bunch of slides as i wasn't even going to use them but these labels we've read tonight these things we've referenced in my background the diagnostic and statistic manual of mental disorders they're man's attempt to address the deterioration of the mind as brother man said the human mind is leaving the people and educated people are trying to figure out what's going wrong with man what is happening and science is describing an individual's behavioral behavioral patterns and emotional patterns over time and say well this person's always doing this and doing this and doing this and they're trying to make sense of it they're trying to figure out how how can we address this and how can we alleviate this but as the world might the scientists might have some sort of clinical diagnosis of a person with some mental disorder whether it be a class a b or c whatever these uh clusters of disorders might be the depravity of it the the dissonance of it the disorder itself is because of evil adam in the beginning wasn't made to be a narcissist there's those that say you know is is there a psychopath in the bible and they say yes god's the first one why because they attribute these human notions of things to the divine and to deity it's like no our our own the only way that we can even begin to conjure the idea of evil is through satan that's the only way that god everything he says is the truth everything he does is right and just there is no concept of evil when it comes to god and we have to accept that and we ought to worship him because of that there no one else just do worship except god because he alone is the only one who when he speaks it's truth when he acts as just and if you just worshiped him on that basis alone he would receive your worship and and this this sentiment that uh that if you look in the bible evil only exists because of sin and there are only these disorders and these complexes and these problems of depression and anxiety there is only addictions and abuses and inducements and intoxications and infections because of sin and science is really really really really really good at describing the symptoms science is sometimes really good at diagnosing the condition but the same discipline that describes and the same discipline that diagnosis is not the same discipline that can deliver mankind all day long can try to can figure out what's wrong with man but it's only god that can solve man's problems science is very good at telling us when you have this disorder and you have this disorder and you have this health problem you have this bad thought process and they can tell us all day long take this pill of the help or do these things walk it'll help exercise it'll help talk it'll help those things are wonderful and those things are fine and i'm even an advocate for those if we had personal time to discuss your situation but there's one thing i know for sure for a son or daughter of god that this word is for them and the word is interested in your total person and we we're so often we so often can lift up that god can take a cancer a water on a woman's neck and cause it to disappear and we're so sensitive to the fact that god could take a broken limb and heal it the same god that heals the body is the same god that heals the mind that heals broken hearts that heals fractured spirits can take somebody who's absolutely insane and set him in the right mind this word this word is enough i believe in it brother adam says in the message identification we want to be want to make this bible our looking glass and let ourselves be molded by his character by having his character his mind letting the mind that was in christ be in us i want to make the bible my looking glass and i want myself to be molded into his character that's what i want i want myself to be molded into his character i want him to have the preeminence there's a lot said about the moving of the spirit and i think it's necessary and we ought to be open to that and there ought to be liberty to do it but let me say something beautiful about the message of the hour where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty and that by all means doesn't have to end in a church service it ought to be in our lives and i believe the perfecting of our character involves the healing of our minds the harmonizing of our emotions does it take away pain does it take away suffering does it take away anxiety does it take away certain things no but there's a process of bringing things under the looking glass of god's word and even molding those things to fit his character i believe god wants to do it for us i know i've spoken some very different things tonight there's maybe a uniqueness to the the uh the way that it was delivered sometimes when i'm nervous i use humor uh but tonight i hope that you understand you'll give me grace i've introduced some things that may be very interesting and very unique but let god speak to your heart you you can pin me down later i said well brother aaron you said this about the dsm and you said this about personality disorders and i'll say i'm willing to say i understand it's unique or it's different take this thing to say but let the lord speak to your heart tonight that's the most important part we bow our heads i asked in the beginning for you to be very deliberate and purposeful in how you pray and i want to ask right now that if you have in your heart believe that god has discerned your heart and you would want to acknowledge his care acknowledge that he has spoken to you tonight in direct connection by discernment direct connection to what you spoke to him in prayer you'd want to acknowledge that by standing before him tonight and say lord i receive it from you i'm receiving this right now you've spoke to me in a very personal way it's undeniable i i asked i asked god to speak to me i came expecting i put these things before you and i had no idea what brother aaron would be speaking therefore we don't need to give the accolades to to brother aaron let's give it to god to whom the honors do give it to god to whom the glory is due and you're standing now and i would even say lift up hands to thank him and give him the glory give him the recognition and submit to his prescription how many of us go to the doctor and they tell us oh well you've got this problem do this do that do this do that and we do it exactly exactly like they say expecting to get the results let's be honest with ourselves i've heard some of the diets that we go on and the extreme things we do and the way we enter into a regime and discipline ourselves to rid ourselves of toxins or certain sicknesses or certain diseases and we're very disciplined and very ardent to do those things would you tonight be willing to submit to the lord's prescription though it may be hard though it may be difficult maybe though it may seem to come with great sacrifice you say lord i came tonight with a prayer i prayed it in my heart you discerned it exactly i've got confidence tonight lord that you're mindful of what i need god bless so many of you standing tonight so many with hands raised he loves you he's so mindful of you just think of how he would even take a minister and drag him through the dsm-5 to put things in a context to get your attention that he cares for you let's pray our gracious heavenly father there's a very beautiful atmosphere here tonight that you have created there is a faith bank that is rising and a power present amongst us right now that is so powerful lord because you're here and i believe that we sense it some of us having come out of special meetings and uh been in the moving of god and the atmosphere lord we we sense that you're near right now you're present with us and the power of god is here present to heal us to set us free and to deliver us and lord i want to be like that one that cried out to you don't pass me by lord jesus jesus all right by faith i'm reaching out to touch the hem of your garment by faith i'm crying out your name lord i'm laying by the pool of bethesda and others are jumping into the waters before me when it's stirred but lord i i need not fall into those waters i just need you to come to me now and touch me [Music] and to heal me lord i say under inspiration that our opportunity has not passed us by that we have not missed our chance but you stand ready to heal as you stand ready to deliver as you stand ready to open up our understanding and i pray tonight that in your grace you've spoken to us in your tender mercies you've spoken to us tonight and we need your healing we need your grace we need your deliverance and i would pray that what could rise tonight as we said let the worshipers arrive the worshipers are those that do so in spirit and truth lord i'm done being intimidated by the world i'm dying being bullied by my emotions i'm done being backed into melancholy into a corner and not taking my position as a son of god i'm one i'm willing to stand i'm going to be used by you i'm willing to walk in your path i'm willing to do the things that i ought to do and i pray lord may there come a deliverance in the people's hearts may there be a setting right of the home may there be a setting right of our ambitions lord may all of our excuses be destroyed right now we've put labels on ourselves we found we found comfort in our diagnosis the lord i pray tonight that we would get so sick and tired of the way that we've been living below our privileges that we're willing to fight for this truth oh god i pray that you would deliver them in the name of the lord jesus christ the hands raised they'll stand upon their feet those that have lifted their palms to heaven i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ you would bring such a stark distinct healing that they would know your present with them [Music] may there be a definite experience lord just as much as sister naomi ate her peanut butter and jelly may there be others lord that can walk in their deliverance granted i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord praise the lord [Music]
