[0:00] just to mention that to you ephesians
[0:03] chapter 4
[0:04] verses 22 to 24
[0:08] it says that you put off concerning
[0:13] the former conversation the old man
[0:15] which is corrupt according to the
[0:17] deceitful lust
[0:18] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[0:20] mind and that you put on the new man
[0:24] which after god is created in
[0:25] righteousness and true
[0:27] holiness amen you may be seated
[0:34] we've been uh we're looking at uh who is
[0:37] that
[0:37] who is my neighbor we're asking
[0:39] ourselves that question
[0:40] not necessarily trying to determine who
[0:42] your neighbor is but rather who
[0:44] our own personal neighbor is and we've
[0:46] had several services on it to date
[0:48] and i want to just pick up in luke
[0:50] chapter 10 again if you could turn there
[0:53] and i want to read just a couple verses
[0:55] verses 33 and 34
[0:58] and so we're we're jumping right into
[0:59] this subject and we'll
[1:01] capture a few things we mentioned last
[1:03] time uh in order to connect it
[1:05] uh further it says in luke chapter 10
[1:08] verses 33 and 34
[1:09] in answering the question of the
[1:13] the lawyer well who is my neighbor then
[1:16] why you know who
[1:17] who do i have to be good to who do i
[1:18] have to love uh as myself
[1:21] jesus uses this parable and comes to
[1:23] this one
[1:24] whom even the lawyer acknowledges well
[1:26] the one who showed mercy
[1:27] he was neighbor to him who fell among
[1:30] thieves and it says this but a certain
[1:31] samaritan
[1:32] as he journeyed came where he was and
[1:35] when he saw him
[1:36] he had compassion on him it's important
[1:39] to note and we'll expand upon this
[1:41] later it says a certain samaritan so
[1:44] it's not just
[1:45] some random samaritan it implies
[1:47] election or some quality
[1:49] to where he was a certain samaritan and
[1:51] he came to where this man was in verse
[1:53] 34 it says and he went to him
[1:55] and bound up his wounds pouring in oil
[1:58] and wine
[1:59] and set him on his own beast and brought
[2:02] him to an end
[2:03] and took care of him and these words are
[2:05] describing what is commonly referred to
[2:07] as
[2:08] the good samaritan and jesus is
[2:10] contrasting
[2:11] the lawyer's attitude and that attitude
[2:14] and actions of the priest and the levite
[2:16] with the conduct and attitude of the
[2:18] samaritan
[2:20] and this had to be an incredible rebuke
[2:21] to jews that he would use a samaritan as
[2:24] being the one who's fulfilling the law
[2:26] fulfilling the commandment in the law
[2:28] to be neighborly to this one who fell
[2:30] among thieves but jesus is wanting to
[2:32] take
[2:33] the samaritan's conduct and his
[2:36] ministering to this one who is in need
[2:38] and use it as a rebuke and instruction
[2:41] to this lawyer and last time we looked
[2:44] at different social dynamics that
[2:46] influence our behavior
[2:48] and and we were identifying uh things we
[2:51] called them maybe
[2:52] devices we use the scripture devices in
[2:54] our hearts there's many
[2:55] devices in our thinking and our
[2:57] psychology and our instincts and our
[2:59] attitudes
[3:00] but we're looking at these different
[3:02] social dynamics that influence our
[3:03] behavior
[3:05] and looking at even how in romans it
[3:06] speaks of a conforming power of the
[3:09] world
[3:09] that means there's a mold the world
[3:11] wants you to be in and there's a
[3:12] pressure that it can exert upon you
[3:14] to put you in that mold and we looked at
[3:18] the power of the crowd and how that we
[3:21] in our
[3:21] we have these instincts and these
[3:23] desires to conform
[3:24] uh we uh much rather mimic somebody else
[3:27] than be the oddball or mimic a group
[3:29] and do what the group is doing uh if we
[3:31] if you had fallen asleep right now and
[3:34] you woke up and you saw everyone
[3:35] standing
[3:36] you would stand up with everyone else
[3:38] regardless of what prompted them to do
[3:40] so
[3:41] you wouldn't want to be the one uh who
[3:43] is left
[3:44] understanding you would just mimic the
[3:46] group thinking well
[3:47] they must all be standing for good
[3:49] reason a good purpose and so you would
[3:51] just mimic
[3:51] instinctively and so we have these
[3:53] devices in our hearts we looked at them
[3:55] as
[3:56] biases and prejudice and different
[3:58] things from a social economic standpoint
[4:01] these ways that
[4:02] work within our psychology and these
[4:04] devices in our hearts sway our thinking
[4:06] if it can influence our thinking it can
[4:08] influence our acting
[4:10] and we mentioned the the group
[4:12] experiment
[4:13] and i want to show you that slide again
[4:15] of this group experiment where
[4:18] in they had a they had a room of six
[4:20] people
[4:21] and the of the six people and it was a
[4:23] study that was conducted
[4:25] and of the six people five were actors
[4:27] and one was a
[4:28] participant now there's the subject of
[4:30] the study and the question was
[4:32] very simple which line on the right
[4:35] is the same length as the line on the
[4:37] left and so that seems like a very
[4:39] simple question we would all say
[4:41] that c is the right is the right answer
[4:44] c
[4:45] is the same length as the line on the
[4:47] left
[4:48] and the uh what happened is the five
[4:51] actors all gave the wrong answer they
[4:53] may have said a
[4:54] and b they may have all joined in saying
[4:56] a and then they all
[4:57] or they all joined in saying b and by
[4:59] the time the participant
[5:01] had to give his answer in the presence
[5:02] of these five actors
[5:04] who were all given the wrong kind of
[5:05] information he would have to answer and
[5:08] they found that 75 percent of the time
[5:10] the non-actor the subject the one who
[5:12] was not in on the game
[5:14] he joined with the rest in giving the
[5:16] wrong answer
[5:18] in one study 97 conformed
[5:21] to the wrong answer and so it just
[5:24] showed the power of the crowd
[5:26] and how that we we experience pressure
[5:28] to conform that if everybody
[5:30] else is doing it then we want to do it
[5:32] and it's a it's a peer pressure that
[5:34] works within age groups it works within
[5:36] certain classes
[5:37] certain professions in certain ways that
[5:39] we identify with others
[5:40] and if they're doing it we feel the
[5:42] pressure to do it and it's remarkable to
[5:44] think that someone could absolutely know
[5:46] the right answer
[5:48] absolutely no that sees the correct
[5:50] answer but when
[5:51] five people give the wrong one you
[5:53] experience this pressure
[5:55] and and you say well it's a knowing
[5:58] better
[5:59] knowing that your eyes aren't full on
[6:00] you maybe some even begin to wrestle
[6:02] well i do have bad eyes maybe i'm on the
[6:04] wrong side of the slide
[6:05] whatever it might be but instead of
[6:06] sticking to your conviction
[6:08] that the answer seems very clear sees
[6:10] the right answer
[6:11] in a situation where there's no
[6:12] consequence they would just
[6:14] join in giving the wrong answer think
[6:17] about that there's no consequence in
[6:18] giving the right answer
[6:21] and so they would join like they would
[6:22] have said i think it's c
[6:24] and who cares if these other five guys
[6:26] uh think it's uh a
[6:28] i i know that it's c and it's not like
[6:31] they're going to take you out in the
[6:32] hallway and beat you up
[6:34] i mean it'd just be five people you
[6:35] don't know that you disagree with
[6:37] but it just goes to show in a situation
[6:40] like that
[6:40] how powerful the crowd can be and if it
[6:43] can be powerful in that kind of dynamic
[6:45] how much more powerful can it be when
[6:47] those five other people are in your
[6:48] family or your youth group or people you
[6:50] love or you're close to
[6:51] or people that you share camaraderie
[6:53] with or you associate with or
[6:55] professionally
[6:56] work with it creates this pressure upon
[6:58] the individual
[6:59] to join in something that they otherwise
[7:02] would not do
[7:03] and it's a pressure to conform and so we
[7:06] were looking at
[7:07] now i wanted to use that example because
[7:09] i want to come back to it in the end
[7:11] we're looking at how that our minds are
[7:12] the product of a fallen nature
[7:15] and then also the nurture of a world and
[7:17] a devil
[7:18] who is the god of this evil age who's
[7:20] the prince of the power of the air
[7:22] so our minds our thinking this circuitry
[7:24] all these ways that we
[7:25] process information is the product of a
[7:28] fallen nature
[7:29] and then also a worldly nurture and
[7:31] therefore we're subject to carnal
[7:33] influence
[7:34] if you want to know what qualifies you
[7:36] to be subject to carnal influence
[7:38] it's just have a breath just be
[7:41] breathing
[7:41] just be the product of a man and a woman
[7:44] a man born of a woman is subject to a
[7:46] woman
[7:46] born of a woman is subject to these
[7:48] carnal influences
[7:49] and we looked at first john chapter 2
[7:51] verse 16
[7:53] where it says for all that is in the
[7:54] world the lust of the flesh
[7:57] the lust of the the lust of the eyes and
[7:59] the pride of life is not of the father
[8:02] but is of the world so all that is in
[8:04] the world
[8:05] is the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[8:07] eyes and the pride of life
[8:09] in these avenues of temptation these
[8:11] weaknesses
[8:12] we could say within human nature it
[8:14] exists within all human beings
[8:16] and it says all that is in the world all
[8:18] that is in our worldly nature all that a
[8:20] man could be tempted to
[8:21] is the lust of the flesh to the lust of
[8:22] the eyes and the pride of life and it
[8:24] stands contrary
[8:25] to the father's nature stands contrary
[8:28] to the word
[8:29] and if we were if we replace it in this
[8:33] way we're all born with the lust of the
[8:34] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[8:35] of life inside of us
[8:37] it would beg the question well then what
[8:38] would it take to overcome this and he
[8:40] said you must be born again
[8:43] there has to be some other source some
[8:44] other power some other influence
[8:46] on the inside and then we could we could
[8:48] put it in this context and how
[8:50] how can i overcome these instincts even
[8:52] as a born-again believer
[8:54] and you're going to find the word is the
[8:55] answer to all of it
[8:57] and so the answer we found in being
[8:59] transformed
[9:00] changed into another form by the word by
[9:03] the word itself
[9:04] renewing our minds it and bringing our
[9:07] minds
[9:08] subject to the word of god at changing
[9:09] our thinking changing our instincts
[9:11] you have an instinct a base instinct in
[9:14] the first nature by your first birth
[9:16] and it's the very first thing you do and
[9:18] we can even find that even in innocent
[9:20] things that when you're sick the very
[9:21] first thing you're going to do
[9:22] have a headache go get an advil if you
[9:25] have a pain or something that's creeping
[9:26] up on you you go to the doctor i need to
[9:28] get that looked at
[9:29] that's just first nature and and and
[9:32] that's just what we do
[9:33] humanly that's our experience that's we
[9:34] know to do brother branham says when
[9:36] you're sick your first duty is to go to
[9:37] your doctor
[9:38] but we know that there's another
[9:40] instinct to commit things to the lord to
[9:42] pray to ponder things
[9:44] to to to even lay hands on the sick and
[9:46] they shall recover
[9:47] there's other things that don't come
[9:49] with the first nature that don't come
[9:50] instinctively
[9:51] by our first birth and those are the
[9:53] things that we want to be energized to
[9:55] be fed to come to the surface kind of
[9:57] rise to the top in our lives until we
[9:59] begin to act upon his word
[10:01] with that with the spirit of god instead
[10:04] of our human nature
[10:06] we read it a couple places in the church
[10:08] age book where brother brown says but
[10:09] jesus
[10:10] overcame by the word and he says and
[10:13] right now let me say that this is the
[10:15] only way to be an overcomer
[10:17] also it is the only way that you can
[10:18] know if you're overcoming because that
[10:20] word cannot fail
[10:22] so you can only overcome by the word so
[10:25] the only way that you can be an
[10:26] overcomer is by the word
[10:27] and the only way that you can know if
[10:28] you're overcoming is by the word
[10:30] the word is our measuring stick as to
[10:32] whether or not we're overcoming
[10:34] not are you successful are you on top do
[10:37] people preserve
[10:38] uh perceive you as being a a powerful
[10:41] person and perceive you as being popular
[10:43] perceive you as being successful it's
[10:45] not a question of whether or not we
[10:47] ourselves are successful
[10:48] by worldly metrics but rather are we
[10:51] doing what the word says that we ought
[10:52] to do
[10:53] and if we are following in the pattern
[10:55] of the word and we're looking to the
[10:56] word and we're lining up with the word
[10:58] then we can say we are overcoming
[10:59] because i've looked to the word and the
[11:01] word says
[11:01] that i ought to be doing this and i'm
[11:03] doing it then we know we're overcoming
[11:06] and that's the only way that you can
[11:07] overcome is by the word
[11:09] and then brother branham says in his own
[11:11] personal life
[11:12] speaking of jesus contending with
[11:14] himself
[11:15] now if you could just think very uh
[11:19] uh just in an expansive way about this
[11:21] this phrase in his own personal life so
[11:23] this is
[11:24] him as a person and we realize that
[11:26] jesus was a person he was one that had
[11:28] a will he had a desire uh he was he was
[11:30] tempted in every point and manner that a
[11:32] man would be tempted so
[11:34] he had to have this individuality he had
[11:36] this part of him where he had a will he
[11:38] had a desire
[11:39] and then this man had a communion with
[11:40] the father and made his will subject to
[11:42] the father's will
[11:43] in his own personal life says contending
[11:45] with himself
[11:46] so there was things that jesus would
[11:48] have thought of and things that would
[11:49] have been presented to him
[11:51] things that he would have had to
[11:52] overcome and the bible says by obedience
[11:55] he by through the things which he
[11:57] suffered learned he obedience by the
[11:58] things which he suffered
[11:59] and he became perfect through that what
[12:02] was this it was contending with himself
[12:04] he says he overcame by obedience to the
[12:06] word
[12:07] in his own personal life contending with
[12:09] himself he overcame by obedience to the
[12:12] word
[12:12] so if you're contending with yourself
[12:15] which we all do
[12:16] our worst enemy is our self and i know
[12:18] there's that one person that
[12:21] is a really close second
[12:24] but our our worst enemy is ourselves
[12:28] and that's the only uh that's the only
[12:30] only way that we can truly begin to
[12:32] overcome is when you recognize that
[12:33] you're part of your
[12:34] uh enemy so he says contending with
[12:38] himself he overcame by obedience to the
[12:40] word
[12:42] now i'm going to take a quote from how
[12:44] can i overcome and i'm going to break it
[12:45] up into three different statements
[12:47] and kind of separate them out so that we
[12:50] can i just
[12:50] study this in a little bit more detail
[12:53] not a lot of detail but just a few more
[12:55] aspects
[12:55] because he's speaking about overcoming
[12:57] by the word and i'm doing this in the
[12:59] context of
[13:00] us recognizing that there's uh
[13:03] there's powers that influence a group
[13:06] there's powers that influence the
[13:08] individuals in that group
[13:10] i'm speaking to you as a church speaking
[13:12] to you as a body of believers that god
[13:14] has called together supernaturally has
[13:16] called together
[13:18] is bringing together to be a local body
[13:20] and so we we have this opportunity at
[13:22] the genesis of something
[13:23] to think about how god wants to shape us
[13:26] and to begin to
[13:27] let the word have the preeminence not
[13:29] politics not pretense
[13:31] not popularity but let the word have the
[13:34] preeminence
[13:35] so that we have a pattern within our own
[13:37] uh
[13:38] our own dna of how we ought to act and
[13:40] how we ought to think and how that we
[13:42] ought to treat others
[13:43] and be motivated to be a light to others
[13:46] be motivated to to do more than just
[13:49] come to church but be empowered
[13:51] through these gatherings through our
[13:52] fellowship with one another to be
[13:54] overcomers in our personal life
[13:56] and so in this uh and we're using this
[13:59] parable
[13:59] of who is my neighbor to challenge
[14:02] ourselves
[14:03] uh to have the right kind of attitude
[14:04] and obey the word so how can we overcome
[14:07] these negative influences that are even
[14:09] ingrained in our
[14:10] our human psyche ingrained in our human
[14:12] behavior how can we overcome it by the
[14:14] word
[14:15] now brother branham says and how can
[14:16] overcome overcome means
[14:18] to stand the test you've heard it said
[14:20] before we all want a testimony but we
[14:22] don't want to test
[14:23] can't get a testimony without a test and
[14:26] so to overcome means to stand
[14:28] the test in ephesians chapter 6 verse 11
[14:31] it says put on the whole armor of god
[14:33] that you may be able to stand against
[14:35] the wiles of the devil
[14:36] so you're going to be tested not just in
[14:38] an innocent way but you're going to be
[14:39] tested by the devil
[14:41] we realize this whole evil age is to
[14:43] prove that you're not like eve
[14:44] that you're not that type of a woman so
[14:46] you as an individual
[14:48] are going to come in contact with the
[14:50] temptation of the enemy
[14:52] you're going to have to contend with
[14:54] yourself which is your worst enemy
[14:56] you're going to have to wrestle out your
[14:57] own salvation with fear and trembling
[14:59] there's things that you're going to be
[15:00] tested on things are going to need to be
[15:02] made firm and made sure
[15:03] so it says put on the whole armor of god
[15:07] that you may be able to stand against
[15:08] the wiles the cunning arts the deceit
[15:10] the craft or the trickery of the devil
[15:14] so the devil's just not you know just
[15:15] sitting there waving his right hand
[15:16] saying here i'm coming with a
[15:18] with a right hook and so you know what's
[15:20] coming but he's going to try to be
[15:21] deceitful
[15:22] he's going to try to be crafty or trick
[15:24] you it's his cunning arts so we
[15:26] what we need the whole armor of god to
[15:28] be able to stand
[15:29] we need the whole arm of god in order to
[15:31] overcome because overcome means to
[15:33] stand the test and brother man said he
[15:36] fell to the personal temptation of satan
[15:38] by failing to use the word so the whole
[15:41] armor of god
[15:42] is the word of god and we need to use
[15:44] the word
[15:45] in order to stand against the personal
[15:47] temptation of satan
[15:49] satan will tempt us personally in order
[15:51] to stand against it
[15:52] we must use the word to stand against it
[15:55] in james chapter 1 verse 14 it says but
[15:58] every man
[15:59] is tempted when he's drawn away of his
[16:02] own lust
[16:03] and enticed so there's the test
[16:06] we need to overcome means to stand the
[16:08] test it doesn't mean you're going to be
[16:09] without temptation
[16:11] doesn't mean you're not going to be
[16:12] without something coming to buffet you
[16:14] to challenge you to get you
[16:16] cause you to begin to think well am i
[16:17] right am i wrong do i really believe do
[16:19] i really have the holy ghost
[16:20] those those are challenges that we all
[16:22] face and not
[16:23] we don't always face them all the time
[16:25] but we've all at some point or another
[16:27] been challenged in certain areas and
[16:29] when we pass the test
[16:30] then there's it's a way of making that
[16:32] firm so that when the devil comes around
[16:33] and tries to pick her on that you say no
[16:35] sorry pass that test and so there's a
[16:38] way that the devil comes to us and he
[16:40] tempts us
[16:40] different avenues different weaknesses
[16:42] different levels of temptation
[16:44] and each one of us have a personal
[16:46] temptation
[16:47] and personal temptations and if we have
[16:50] if we could as a church collective as a
[16:52] body a local church collectively
[16:54] be tempted there's ways that we can all
[16:55] be tempted together but it says every
[16:57] man is tempted when he's
[16:59] drawn away from his own lust and enticed
[17:02] now james continues to expound upon this
[17:04] how that once it's conceived then you
[17:06] when lust is conceived then it brings
[17:08] forth
[17:08] uh sin but we're just looking at the
[17:11] dynamics of you now
[17:12] under personal temptation being
[17:14] confronted with something
[17:16] and we're recognizing that the dynamics
[17:18] how that you would come to a place where
[17:20] lust can be deceived
[17:21] you have to first be drawn away of your
[17:23] own lust
[17:24] and there has to be an enticement not
[17:27] just the temptation but an enticement
[17:28] not just saying
[17:29] would you do you want to do this or you
[17:31] should do that or you should be feeling
[17:33] this way or you should go do this
[17:34] but rather the enticement where it seems
[17:36] to hook you
[17:38] and i want you to when we read this when
[17:41] every man is tempted when he's drawn
[17:43] away of his own lust and enticed
[17:44] think about your instinct as a human
[17:48] think about your base nature and
[17:52] not tempted to sin like the thieves not
[17:55] tempted to lust attempted to do drugs
[17:57] and
[17:58] tempted to steal from your neighbor
[18:01] and i'm not i'm those this is applicable
[18:03] to those temptations and
[18:04] temptation to to do things that defile
[18:06] your body
[18:07] but rather just think now about the
[18:09] priest and the levite
[18:11] think about your base nature your base
[18:13] instinct in other ways whether it be
[18:15] social ways or
[18:16] personal opinions of others and
[18:18] different things what leads you to act
[18:20] critically what would lead you to
[18:22] treating someone harshly what would
[18:23] cause you
[18:24] to to judge with prejudice or to do
[18:26] something
[18:27] that would be unkind it's it's all
[18:29] within this same temptation
[18:31] it's not that there's a category of of
[18:34] sins that
[18:35] are deal with lust and perversion and
[18:37] fornication and that's when a man is
[18:39] tempted and that's when a man is enticed
[18:41] to do anything contrary to the word
[18:43] operates according to the same the same
[18:45] rules you're drawn away from the word of
[18:47] god
[18:47] you're enticed to have an attitude
[18:49] towards someone that's not pleasing to
[18:51] the lord you're
[18:51] enticed to judge someone incorrectly
[18:53] that's unfair
[18:54] it's all according to the same dynamics
[18:57] so we're not thinking about being
[18:58] tempted like a thief would be to rob
[19:00] somebody but rather how the priest and
[19:02] the levite would see man in need and
[19:04] would pass by him
[19:05] and i said how am i tempted to mistreat
[19:09] someone how do i treat somebody
[19:10] how how can i be neighbor to the less
[19:12] fortunate and in doing so
[19:14] recognize these impulses these instincts
[19:17] or the enticements
[19:18] or my own lust my innocent uh the
[19:21] innocent biases that dwell within my
[19:23] thought process
[19:24] by a natural birth and so we we're
[19:27] standing this
[19:28] personal temptation we're contending
[19:30] with ourselves
[19:31] overcome means to stand the test
[19:34] overcome means to recognize when i'm
[19:36] being drawn away by my own
[19:38] lust my own desires my own opinions my
[19:41] own draw
[19:42] something and then we recognize that oh
[19:43] wait a minute something's happening here
[19:45] and then you fire something towards it
[19:47] say wait a minute hold on stop
[19:50] i i'm becoming more and more conscious
[19:52] of it and i i
[19:54] i think it's something that if as you
[19:55] become more conscious
[19:57] you might say well this is really
[19:58] discouraging i'm beginning to think my
[19:59] first thoughts aren't very good
[20:01] that's great because before you never
[20:02] thought about it
[20:04] but now you're thinking about it man my
[20:06] first thought is to assume the worst and
[20:08] my first thought is to think this and
[20:10] my first thought when i see that is
[20:11] these instincts well if you're gonna be
[20:13] that way i'm gonna be this way but now
[20:14] i'm starting to realize whoa wait a
[20:16] minute
[20:16] and it's okay that first thought it's
[20:18] you have it but the challenge is saying
[20:20] wait a minute hold on
[20:22] let me run that through the word filter
[20:24] let me check whether or not this is
[20:25] pleasing to the lord
[20:26] is this something that's going to bring
[20:28] god glory is this for that person's
[20:30] benefit
[20:30] is this for my his edification for my
[20:32] growth and my benefit
[20:33] it's pausing now you're all familiar
[20:35] with these statements and they're all
[20:37] reside together within one paragraph but
[20:39] the man says overcome means
[20:41] to recognize the devil in every one of
[20:43] his tricks
[20:45] so overcome means to stand the test
[20:47] that's one part of it
[20:48] and it means to recognize the devil in
[20:50] every one of his tricks
[20:52] so you cannot overcome unless you have
[20:55] recognized a trick of the enemy
[20:57] you've recognized which means to know or
[20:59] to recall to mind to
[21:00] recover knowledge it means you remember
[21:02] i recognize this i remember this this is
[21:04] the test
[21:04] i've been here before i've done that or
[21:07] i've been told before i've been warned
[21:08] beforehand this is how the devil
[21:10] operates this is how he works
[21:11] overcomes to means to recognize the
[21:13] devil
[21:14] in every one of his tricks if there's
[21:18] anything you could take away from this
[21:19] it's that the word of god says that you
[21:22] can and have the ability to recognize
[21:24] every single one of his tricks devil
[21:27] there's not
[21:28] one scheme you can pull on us that god
[21:30] can't expose
[21:31] there's not one trap there's not one
[21:33] weakness there's not one lie
[21:35] there's not anything that you've been
[21:36] scheming to do for 6 000 years
[21:39] that i have not been commanded by the
[21:41] word
[21:42] to recognize brother john and i were
[21:45] fellowshipping
[21:47] a couple weeks ago on the way to church
[21:49] and how that you if you're required to
[21:51] do something and you have a
[21:52] responsibility
[21:53] what good is the responsibility if you
[21:55] haven't been given the power to fulfill
[21:56] it
[21:57] if you haven't been authorized with the
[21:59] authority to
[22:00] to to meet the responsibility it's your
[22:02] responsibility
[22:03] to to sweep this floor but you don't
[22:05] have the authority to go get the broom
[22:08] you don't have the authority to come in
[22:09] the room and sweep the floor what what
[22:10] is the responsibility without the
[22:12] authority
[22:13] to fulfill the responsibility god has
[22:15] not given you the responsibility
[22:17] to recognize the devil in every one of
[22:19] his tricks without
[22:20] giving you the authority to do so
[22:23] without
[22:24] authorizing you and given you the
[22:25] authority to recognize these tricks
[22:28] and so this is part of our overcoming to
[22:31] recognize the devil
[22:32] in every one of his tricks in second
[22:34] corinthians chapter 2 verse 11
[22:37] paul says lest satan should get an
[22:38] advantage of us for we are not ignorant
[22:41] of his devices
[22:42] and let me phrase it this way because we
[22:44] are not ignorant of his devices
[22:46] we don't let satan take advantage of us
[22:49] because we recognize the devil and his
[22:51] tricks
[22:52] i don't put myself in a position to be
[22:54] taken advantage of
[22:56] so you don't even have to know and see
[22:58] the trap you just have to know
[22:59] that's a trap he lays i know that if i
[23:03] do this i know i'm putting myself in a
[23:05] ground to compromise
[23:06] i know that if i do this this is where
[23:08] this say this is where satan
[23:10] take advantage of me so we when we
[23:12] overcome it's to recognize the devil in
[23:14] every one of his tricks
[23:15] and because we are not ignorant of his
[23:16] devices it means even his mental
[23:19] perceptions
[23:21] thought process and even his purpose so
[23:23] it's his ambition
[23:25] we're not ignorant of his ambition and
[23:26] we're not ignorant of his imprint
[23:28] on the human thinking his imprint on the
[23:31] human thought process his imprint
[23:33] in his programming brother bam teaches
[23:35] us that he has designed the modern woman
[23:38] well not only has he designed the modern
[23:39] woman but he's designed our modern
[23:41] thinking
[23:42] to to be manipulated and be controlled
[23:45] by human things
[23:47] so we're subject to these temptations
[23:48] we're subject to biases
[23:50] we're subject to weaknesses i want to
[23:52] conform i want to fit in
[23:53] i i want to i want to achieve i want to
[23:55] be successful he says because we're not
[23:57] ignorant of his
[23:58] devices we do not let satan get
[24:02] take advantage of us and in first
[24:04] corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 he's
[24:06] specifically referring to how a lack of
[24:08] forgiveness
[24:09] by a body by a church can give satan an
[24:12] exploitable advantage
[24:14] so i want you to think about this the
[24:16] context of verse 11 is him
[24:18] of him saying that we're not ignorant of
[24:20] his devices and because we're not
[24:21] ignorant of his devices
[24:22] we'll conduct ourselves in a certain way
[24:24] so that we do not let satan get the
[24:26] advantage of us
[24:27] and notice what verse 10 says says to
[24:30] whom you forgive
[24:31] anything i forgive also for if i forgave
[24:33] anything to whom i forgave it
[24:35] for your sakes forgive i it in the
[24:38] person
[24:38] of christ so paul is saying if you have
[24:41] a body
[24:42] as a body have forgiven him then i also
[24:44] forgive him
[24:46] unless this perception that i have not
[24:49] forgiven him
[24:50] becomes an exploitable weakness in this
[24:52] person's mind and in his heart
[24:55] so paul is willing to humble himself and
[24:57] join with
[24:58] others who have forgiven this one who
[24:59] committed a horrible sin
[25:02] anybody read it and know what it is in
[25:04] first corinthians
[25:06] it's it was an awful you know what we
[25:08] could say at a very fornication like oh
[25:10] yeah that's bad but
[25:11] it was really bad i mean if you have
[25:13] degrees and levels of it it was
[25:14] something like how could you let this
[25:16] happen
[25:16] how could this be going on the church
[25:17] and paul rebukes them and he
[25:19] exposes it you know what the church did
[25:21] they did what they were supposed to do
[25:23] and he said i find that you have made
[25:25] this right and the one
[25:26] that had done it repented and made
[25:28] things right he says as you have
[25:30] forgiven him
[25:31] i forgive him also so that
[25:34] lest satan should get an advantage of us
[25:38] we're not ignorant of his devices i
[25:40] realize that and if i could put it in
[25:42] this way
[25:43] he says he's referring to how a lack of
[25:45] forgiveness can create
[25:46] an advantage that satan would want to
[25:48] exploit he's specifically saying that
[25:50] satan exploits our treatment of others
[25:53] to that person and our own detriment
[25:57] the way we treat someone satan can
[25:59] exploit it the words we say how many
[26:02] times has he just taken
[26:03] the things we've said and we haven't
[26:04] really given much thought and it didn't
[26:06] come out the right way
[26:07] and it's like man satan just seems to
[26:09] grab a hold of it and just
[26:11] it makes it makes it hit with a lot more
[26:13] punch than we meant to
[26:14] we might have meant to cause a little
[26:16] bit of hurt but man he just takes it and
[26:18] he ramps it up and it
[26:19] causes a lot more hurt and then when we
[26:21] go to apologize like man i didn't know
[26:22] you were that sensitive
[26:25] i mean get some thicker skin paul
[26:27] realizes no
[26:28] we the way we treat others creates an ex
[26:32] something a scenario a thought process a
[26:34] feeling a
[26:35] a complex that satan can exploit so
[26:37] within the context
[26:39] of forgiveness as the body has forgiven
[26:41] paul
[26:42] also wanted to forgive because he
[26:43] realized that satan can take advantage
[26:46] of the way one is feeling
[26:48] so he took the responsibility himself
[26:52] to be sure that nothing he said or did
[26:55] gave put put a weakness in that person's
[26:58] spirit for satan to take advantage of it
[27:00] and he also says that lest he would take
[27:02] advantage of us
[27:05] paul realized that even his attitude and
[27:07] his behavior could leave a weakness
[27:08] within the body within himself
[27:10] so he was wanted to forgive with the
[27:12] others unless satan would take advantage
[27:14] of him
[27:15] he says because we're not ignorant of
[27:16] his devices he's like this is something
[27:18] satan would love to get a hold of
[27:21] loves to find something like this and
[27:22] just wear somebody out with it make him
[27:24] feel
[27:24] small make him feel weak make him feel
[27:26] like an outcast make him feel
[27:28] reluctant to not serve and reluctant to
[27:31] not go to church
[27:31] oh he really loves to work that in
[27:38] so we are we overcome by standing the
[27:41] test we overcome by recognizing the
[27:42] devil in every one of his tricks
[27:44] and then the next part and this is a
[27:46] necessary component now to overcoming
[27:48] to overcome you must recognize
[27:52] that the god in you is greater and
[27:54] mightier
[27:55] than he is and everybody says it as i've
[27:57] kind of parsed this out in a way to
[27:58] where we just weren't reading the
[27:59] statement
[28:00] at the same time that you recognize that
[28:03] he's a devil
[28:04] that's always at the same time that you
[28:06] recognize he's a devil and he wants you
[28:07] and he's after you
[28:08] you have to also recognize at the same
[28:10] time that the god that is in you is
[28:12] greater and mightier than the devil
[28:14] and that the one that's in you has
[28:16] already overcome him
[28:18] do you realize how horribly overwhelming
[28:20] it would be for you to truly recognize
[28:22] the devil in every one of his tricks
[28:24] i know a lot of us are arrogant just
[28:26] because we know how to play chess we
[28:27] think we can just beat anybody in chess
[28:29] and then you finally play somebody in
[28:30] chess you're like
[28:32] well i don't think i've ever played
[28:34] chess before
[28:36] and because you realize man there's so
[28:37] many more moves and there's i mean
[28:38] there's so many
[28:40] other this guy's thinking a million
[28:41] miles ahead of me
[28:43] and if you if you really could see how
[28:45] satan plays chess
[28:48] no matter how many years i've got in
[28:49] this game he's got thousands more than
[28:51] me
[28:52] no matter how strong i think i am he's
[28:55] craftier than i am
[28:57] a man who thinks he standeth beware
[29:00] lest he fall i'm not standing on my own
[29:03] i'm standing because he stood
[29:04] i'm standing in a firm foundation i'm
[29:07] staying on something solid
[29:08] because he's placed me there he set me
[29:10] there so you can't you don't want to
[29:11] just
[29:12] merely recognize the devil in every one
[29:13] of his tricks because if you're honest
[29:15] with yourself you're like how in the
[29:17] world could i ever
[29:19] overcome any one of these tricks it's
[29:21] just like the sleight of hand
[29:22] and a magic trick you know what's coming
[29:26] and you know there's not real sorcery
[29:30] that they actually made it disappear
[29:31] though some people actually think that
[29:33] pin and teller can catch a bullet in
[29:34] their teeth
[29:36] you know you know there's more to this
[29:38] right you know this is slightly hand
[29:40] there's
[29:40] there's some trickery going on but you
[29:43] couldn't figure it out you couldn't do
[29:45] it
[29:46] and if you i'm gonna i'm gonna catch it
[29:47] this time i'm gonna catch it this time
[29:49] there it goes again you can't catch it
[29:51] so then you realize it's not just
[29:53] there's got to be something greater
[29:54] there's got to be a discernment there's
[29:56] got to be a power
[29:57] and so listen if you thought oh i can
[29:59] recognize every one of his tricks oh i
[30:00] know what you're doing devil
[30:01] i'm going to get you i knew of a young
[30:03] man who said one time he testified
[30:05] that he said one time about the devil he
[30:07] said that devil he goes
[30:09] i got the devil's number just says this
[30:11] arrogantly in a group of young people
[30:13] and as far as i know to this day he has
[30:15] not been able to recover from
[30:16] homosexuality
[30:19] makes a comment like that i got the
[30:21] devil's number in a very arrogant way
[30:22] and i'm not saying it was that statement
[30:23] alone
[30:24] that was his own demise but we can't
[30:26] have that kind of arrogance when we look
[30:27] i can recognize the devil and every one
[30:29] of his tricks
[30:29] bring it devil come on no at the same
[30:31] time you've got to recognize
[30:33] that through christ you're more than a
[30:35] match for the devil and that you can
[30:37] overcome him because he that is in you
[30:39] has already done it i have this
[30:42] precedent
[30:43] i have the overcomer inside of me that's
[30:45] the basis upon which i can overcome
[30:48] and so in first john chapter four verse
[30:50] four
[30:52] and you'll notice there's this uh
[30:53] continuity with first john and james on
[30:55] some of these things as we've read
[30:57] already
[30:57] first john chapter two and james chapter
[30:59] one here in first john chapter four
[31:01] verse four
[31:02] year of god little children and have
[31:04] overcome
[31:05] them because greater is he that is in
[31:08] you've overcome the antichrist
[31:10] in the world you've overcome the
[31:11] worldliness you've overcome these things
[31:12] why
[31:13] because greater is he that is in you
[31:15] than he that is in the world
[31:17] this is why we overcome and when we're
[31:20] bowed down
[31:21] when we recognize just how weak we are
[31:23] when we've made a mistake and we're
[31:25] and we're made very conscious and
[31:27] self-aware of how weak we are and i keep
[31:29] making the same mistake we want to say
[31:31] i'm so stupid i'm so foolish how come i
[31:33] keep doing this
[31:34] realize in that moment that that's a
[31:36] product of your own weakness
[31:38] and that you don't overcome because
[31:40] you're strong
[31:42] you overcome because he already overcame
[31:45] him
[31:45] and greater is he that is in me than he
[31:47] that is in the world if you
[31:48] failed then realize it's not him that
[31:51] failed it was you that failed
[31:52] and that all you've got to do is yield
[31:54] to him and there'll be no failure
[31:56] amen do not lose hope that he's not able
[31:58] we do not lose hope that he has not
[31:59] promised
[32:00] we realize that if i have if i have
[32:02] fallen it's not him that has fallen it
[32:04] is i that have fallen and is he that
[32:05] will pick me up
[32:06] and is he that will overcome when this
[32:08] test comes again because greater is he
[32:09] that is in me than he that is in the
[32:10] world
[32:12] so now there's a component of
[32:14] recognizing human weakness
[32:16] recognizing our own human tendencies and
[32:19] then
[32:19] even recognizing satan and his schemes
[32:23] we in our own personal life continuing
[32:25] with ourselves we realize overcoming
[32:26] means to stand the test i need to put on
[32:28] the whole armor of god
[32:29] i need to overcome these personal
[32:30] temptations but then i also have to
[32:32] recognize the devil in every one of his
[32:34] tricks his evil schemes his
[32:35] plans his trickeries so i recognize my
[32:38] human weaknesses i recognize group
[32:39] dynamics i recognize these different
[32:41] heuristics and biases and these
[32:43] tendencies in my own life even family
[32:45] strains this is the weakness in the
[32:46] family
[32:47] we've got all these things but that's
[32:48] only a part of overcoming
[32:52] you could actually identify every single
[32:54] genetic weakness in your family
[32:56] identify every single predispo
[32:58] predisposition you have
[33:00] by worldly nature and worldly nurture i
[33:01] know all my weaknesses i know all my
[33:03] sinful tendencies
[33:04] i know i've got a temper i know i have
[33:05] this problem i know i have that problem
[33:06] i know the devil i know what he's doing
[33:07] he's around the corner right now he's
[33:08] about to ambush me
[33:09] you could know all those things and if
[33:11] you don't recognize greater is he
[33:15] even though i guess it was gi joe that
[33:16] said and knowing is half the battle
[33:19] that's only half the battle amen
[33:23] we must recognize there's a greater
[33:26] power in us
[33:28] a transforming power a power to bring
[33:30] things subject
[33:32] i cannot within myself of my own
[33:34] humanity see humanity get under my
[33:36] humanity
[33:38] i need something greater i need divinity
[33:39] i need deity on this inside of me i need
[33:41] the spirit of christ that says
[33:43] to sit down i keep under my body by the
[33:46] spirit of christ i bring it under
[33:47] subjection
[33:47] paul even uses the language says i beat
[33:49] my body up
[33:50] i punch it i buffer it i keep it under
[33:52] subjection
[33:54] i make it hurt why because it's by the
[33:57] power of christ which is inside of us
[33:58] it's a transforming power that's the
[34:00] power that i've got to recognize
[34:01] is greater than any weakness in my flesh
[34:04] any tendency that's been in my family
[34:05] any power of economics or social uh
[34:08] social things
[34:09] in the world today greater is he that is
[34:11] in me than all that is in the world all
[34:12] the politics all the economics
[34:14] it's greater than all the political ads
[34:16] greater than all the polls
[34:19] greater than everything now james
[34:22] chapter 4 verse 7
[34:25] this is a very familiar scripture but
[34:26] unfortunately the part that's most
[34:28] familiar is resist the devil he'll flee
[34:29] from you
[34:31] and we use that just resist the devil
[34:33] brother
[34:34] resist the devil sister he'll flee and
[34:36] we miss the most important part
[34:38] submit yourselves therefore to god
[34:41] resist the devil
[34:42] and he will flee from you you probably
[34:44] some of you may be familiar with the
[34:45] phrase resistance is futile
[34:47] its resistance without submission is
[34:48] futile
[34:50] that's exactly what the bible's saying
[34:52] resist all you want but if you have not
[34:53] submitted it's futile
[34:55] resistance is futile if you have not
[34:57] submitted so the bible's saying
[34:59] you must first yield to the word of god
[35:02] you must first
[35:03] submit yourself to god and only by first
[35:05] submitting to god have you been put
[35:07] in a position of proper resistance
[35:10] to cause the devil to flee that's why it
[35:13] hasn't worked you say well i resisted
[35:14] the devil i said i rebuked
[35:16] you satan and i did this and i did that
[35:17] but if you have not first submitted
[35:19] yourself to god
[35:20] there really is no shove there really is
[35:23] no push
[35:24] the devil's like seriously
[35:28] you you think you're resisting me this
[35:30] is just you talking
[35:31] this is just you spouting words this is
[35:33] just you trying to make something happen
[35:35] and then all it plays for the devil
[35:36] thing is oh yeah i got him now i'm going
[35:37] to come after him then you realize oh
[35:38] wait a minute lord i submit myself to
[35:40] you
[35:41] i stand i stand in my place i make
[35:42] things right i repent lord i submit
[35:44] myself to you and the satan comes and
[35:45] says i rebuke you satan i resist you and
[35:48] it's through the submission
[35:49] that you channel the supernatural power
[35:51] of god to resist the devil and to cause
[35:52] him to flee
[35:53] the devil flees from your submission
[35:56] more than it is your resistance
[36:00] submit yourselves therefore to god
[36:01] resist the devil and he will he will
[36:04] flee from you there's no he may he might
[36:08] he's going to consider it he's going to
[36:10] run the the metrics on it and the
[36:11] algorithm and going to see if this is
[36:13] the time
[36:14] to flee now if you have submitted
[36:15] yourselves to god
[36:17] and you resist the devil he will flee
[36:24] and so this scripture here in ephesians
[36:26] chapter 4
[36:28] verses 22 to 24 i felt like it just
[36:30] really captured
[36:32] we'd used it last time but i felt it
[36:34] really captured these things that were
[36:36] were pondering in
[36:41] this overcoming and these personal
[36:43] temptations and these weaknesses in our
[36:45] flesh and in our mind
[36:47] paul writing ephesians chapter 4 verses
[36:49] 22 to 24
[36:51] as he's talking about he's taught us not
[36:54] to walk as gentile walks who walk in the
[36:56] vanity of their mind their understanding
[36:58] is darkened and he
[36:59] just talks about how they're corrupt
[37:00] according to deceitful lust and so
[37:02] we could we could have read all that
[37:04] just to say that there's this
[37:06] idea that we have by our first birth
[37:08] we're all gentiles any jews present make
[37:10] you
[37:10] declare yourself but he's talking about
[37:12] the gentiles and the vanity of their
[37:13] mind they walk a certain way they have
[37:15] no promise they are not heirs
[37:18] and so they're disconnected from god and
[37:19] his promises they're disconnected from a
[37:21] promise of a messiah
[37:22] so they only live to their by their base
[37:24] instincts just need to eat i need to
[37:26] drink i need to be clothed i need to
[37:27] have a place to live
[37:28] i need i i need bartering uh a power the
[37:32] all these things he said we ought not to
[37:33] live that way
[37:35] and he brings it down that we then ought
[37:37] to says that ye
[37:39] put off concerning the formal
[37:41] conversation the former
[37:42] conversation the old man which is
[37:45] corrupt according to the
[37:46] deceitful lust these are the lusts that
[37:49] james talked about that were drawn away
[37:51] by
[37:51] these are the devices in our hearts
[37:53] these are the tendencies
[37:55] this is what you contend with yourself
[37:56] in this
[37:58] life that we once lived the former
[38:00] conversation the former way of life
[38:02] he said we ought to put off this because
[38:04] it was a corrupt according to the
[38:06] deceitful lust
[38:06] he describes it as the old man put off
[38:10] he says the old man that means lay aside
[38:11] or cast away
[38:12] your old way of thinking your old way of
[38:14] acting your old
[38:16] manner of life it would be nice just to
[38:18] do an audit sometime
[38:20] of the habits and the ideas the sayings
[38:23] the
[38:23] the the whatever it might be the the
[38:26] recreations
[38:27] however you want to describe it and just
[38:29] say what let me take inventory
[38:31] what's here what's residual from the old
[38:33] man
[38:35] what are the things i say and do that's
[38:37] just really the product of this old man
[38:39] and his deceitful lust
[38:40] and not be afraid to do some house
[38:42] cleaning you know what i don't really
[38:44] need that around
[38:45] i don't really need that instinct i
[38:46] don't need that habit i don't need that
[38:48] catchphrase i don't need to be doing
[38:49] those things
[38:51] and so he said lay it aside cast it away
[38:54] put off the the old man and verse 23
[38:57] says
[38:58] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[39:00] mind
[39:01] there's the transforming power be
[39:03] renewed in the spirit of your mind so
[39:05] the renewing it's going to be a changing
[39:07] of your mind
[39:08] humans think this way this is the way i
[39:11] thought as a migiri
[39:12] this is the way i thought as a texan
[39:14] this is the way i thought as an american
[39:15] this is the way i thought as a
[39:16] republican
[39:17] this is the way i thought as a lawyer
[39:18] this is the way that i thought this is
[39:20] the way that this person
[39:21] thought by all natural influence in
[39:24] nature that he was born with but now
[39:27] i want to renew my mind i want the mind
[39:30] of christ i have the premise i actually
[39:32] want my character to be changed
[39:35] i want this the spirit of me to be
[39:37] perfected
[39:38] do we not believe in a perfection that
[39:40] to where it's not just a perfect
[39:42] soul and one day a perfect body could
[39:44] you imagine that sandwich in the
[39:45] millennium
[39:46] got a perfect body and a perfect soul
[39:48] and an imperfect spirit
[39:49] as the meat in there somewhere no
[39:52] you're gonna have your god is perfecting
[39:54] character now god
[39:56] is perfecting your spirits now that's
[39:58] the beauty of this life that we're
[40:00] living it's not that man once i'm sealed
[40:01] by the holy ghost well
[40:03] if everybody else would just catch up no
[40:05] i'm i'm
[40:06] i'm in the i'm in the trenches now i
[40:08] need to grow to maturity i need to be
[40:10] perfected
[40:11] god perfect my spirit renew
[40:15] the spirit of my mind change my way of
[40:18] thinking
[40:20] and then verse 24 that ye put on the new
[40:22] man which
[40:24] after god which like god is created in
[40:27] righteousness
[40:28] and true holiness this phrase put on the
[40:32] new man it means be endued endued with
[40:35] the new man
[40:36] be arrayed in the new man and the idea
[40:39] is he says put off the former
[40:40] conversation
[40:41] put on the new man put off the old man
[40:44] put on the new man it's
[40:45] speaking of a garment or clothing and
[40:47] the phrase actually speaks of
[40:48] sinking into clothing you just sink into
[40:52] it
[40:54] you yield to his life that is in you i'm
[40:56] going to sink into his image
[40:58] i'm going to fall into his likeness i'm
[41:01] going to come into this new man
[41:03] i'm going to get myself out of the way
[41:10] the new man actually means unprecedented
[41:16] unheard of uncommon you can say well
[41:20] that's just the way the word is used in
[41:21] other places
[41:22] okay i'll i'll accept that
[41:26] but if you really do put on the new man
[41:28] he's unheard of
[41:29] he's certainly not common we could we
[41:32] not all except at least in our own lives
[41:34] it was unprecedented because he hadn't
[41:35] been there yet
[41:37] until we were born again but this man
[41:40] this daughter of god this son of god his
[41:43] nature's unprecedented when it comes to
[41:45] human behavior
[41:47] it's unheard of when it comes to human
[41:49] thinking
[41:50] it's uncommon when it comes to human
[41:52] acting
[41:54] it's something opposite to the expected
[41:56] norm
[41:58] so you have these this former life this
[42:00] former manner of living which was
[42:01] corrupted by deceitful lies
[42:03] paul's saying stop acting that way have
[42:05] your mind renewed
[42:06] and put on the new man because that old
[42:08] way that's a common way that's the human
[42:10] way everyone does it that way
[42:11] but you need to put on the sinking to
[42:13] the new man which is unprecedented which
[42:15] is unheard of which is uncommon
[42:17] something opposite to what is expected
[42:19] by people in your station
[42:22] by people in your str your strat of life
[42:24] and your social economic status
[42:26] the people in your position this is
[42:28] unheard of people like you typically act
[42:30] this way
[42:31] you're waspy white anglo-saxon
[42:32] protestant you should be thinking this
[42:34] way you should be acting that way but no
[42:36] no no i've been born again
[42:38] i'm a new creature in christ jesus i
[42:41] don't act
[42:42] waspy i act christ-liked
[42:45] listen we ought to not become so oh i
[42:47] better be careful
[42:50] i'm a pause i'm going to think about
[42:51] this we ought not become so aligned
[42:54] with our politics we adopt the manners
[42:58] and the beliefs
[43:00] and the ideas of a political party just
[43:03] carte blanche whatever it is yeah i just
[43:06] checked the box
[43:08] you know just vote but just vote by
[43:11] you realize just how
[43:15] opposite the people of the world are in
[43:19] any political
[43:20] party did brother branham not say
[43:22] they're both corrupt
[43:24] so let's try to whitewash one of them
[43:26] and make them out to be messiahs and
[43:28] make them out to be the
[43:29] you know the bastions of truth and oh my
[43:32] what we need is we need to put a
[43:33] you know this party in every office and
[43:35] then we'll see god
[43:37] have his way again with america
[43:39] america's rejected god
[43:41] so if you think god is animating right
[43:43] now joe biden
[43:45] and god is animating uh donald trump
[43:49] you've lost it you don't even believe
[43:52] the message anymore
[43:54] and so we're not identified and i i
[43:56] encourage you to vote do your civic duty
[43:58] but know exactly what arena you're
[44:00] dealing in
[44:02] and realize that at the end of the day
[44:04] satan is in charge of all these kingdoms
[44:06] and god will use satan's ambition to
[44:08] fulfill his word
[44:10] so what we need is the word that makes
[44:11] all these modern events made clear to us
[44:14] understand the prophecies that's been
[44:16] given and not get caught up in the
[44:18] atmosphere and the politics of it
[44:19] and be uncommon and unheard of actually
[44:22] be by the spirit of christ that person
[44:24] who could not get the rancor and the
[44:27] vitriol of all the people who are so
[44:28] political
[44:29] riled up to where we could talk to a
[44:31] democrat we could talk to republican
[44:32] we can have conversations and not be the
[44:35] one instigating and provoking and
[44:37] meeting and
[44:37] ferocity and spitting at one another and
[44:39] getting all mad
[44:42] and leaving coffee and key in the car of
[44:45] the person who's got the biden sticker
[44:52] he's unheard of it's uncommon and you
[44:55] know it's
[44:55] it's a challenge to act the opposite way
[44:58] to what is naturally instinctive it's a
[45:01] challenge
[45:02] this new man unprecedented unheard of
[45:04] uncommon
[45:06] the opposite of what you would expect to
[45:07] someone it's a challenge
[45:09] to act opposite to that
[45:14] many times it's not even socially
[45:16] acceptable
[45:18] you're expected to act a certain way
[45:20] you're expected to conform this is the
[45:21] way we ought to think this is the way we
[45:22] ought to act this is what we ought to do
[45:24] and it might have been expected of a
[45:25] priest to pass on by it might have been
[45:27] expected the levite to pass on by
[45:29] but jesus is specifically implying that
[45:30] they should have stopped and helped
[45:33] because they were required to buy the
[45:34] word they would have done something
[45:35] which would have been
[45:36] unprecedented can you believe it that
[45:38] priest was on the schedule to ogre for
[45:40] sacrifice yet tomorrow
[45:41] but he stopped and he helped this man
[45:42] who was half dead and now he's gonna
[45:45] he's gonna purge himself he's not gonna
[45:46] offer soccer he's gonna take seven days
[45:48] off
[45:48] like that's unheard of to take that risk
[45:51] can you believe it but that's what they
[45:55] ought to have done
[45:57] and the way it strikes me in all these
[45:59] things
[46:00] really is that overcoming is doing the
[46:02] opposite of what you're being pressured
[46:04] to do
[46:05] doing the opposite of what the world
[46:06] would want you to do doing the opposite
[46:08] of what satan wants you to do
[46:11] you're you're you're going the different
[46:12] going a different way
[46:15] and these are three questions that
[46:17] brother branham's asked and i failed to
[46:18] write it down because i just to piece
[46:20] these out as separate questions
[46:21] i don't have the slides for these
[46:23] because i want to go through them uh
[46:25] without necessarily just projecting a
[46:27] slide and focusing on the slide
[46:29] but he's asked these questions in
[46:31] question and answers and i want to go
[46:32] through three of them and i want to read
[46:34] his answer
[46:36] this is the person's questions questions
[46:38] three question 389
[46:40] and i believe these are all from when he
[46:41] was answering questions in the summer of
[46:43] 64.
[46:44] he says when a person realizes he has an
[46:46] inferior complex
[46:47] or some sort of complex how may he
[46:50] overcome this
[46:52] should it be if he was the only child
[46:55] should it be if he was the only child
[46:57] caused this in his early youth
[46:59] so if a person has a complex and
[47:03] inferiority complex
[47:05] whatever complex then how can he
[47:06] overcome it and he says in the context
[47:08] of maybe being an only child
[47:10] so you think it's only child it doesn't
[47:12] know how to get along with others
[47:13] selfish
[47:13] you know you know difficult playing by
[47:15] the rules or whatever it might be
[47:17] brother answers this question of how you
[47:19] can overcome a complex or an inferiority
[47:21] complex
[47:22] or the nature that maybe someone would
[47:24] have if they were only child early on in
[47:25] the youth he says
[47:27] take exactly the opposite
[47:30] now i remember reading these one time
[47:31] and i tried to take it from the
[47:33] standpoint of a person asking these
[47:34] questions
[47:35] who didn't have the holy ghost i thought
[47:37] man i would be terribly frustrated with
[47:38] his answer
[47:40] he says just take exactly the opposite
[47:41] it's almost as if yeah easy take exactly
[47:43] the opposite next question
[47:45] but he says take exactly the opposite if
[47:47] you're always wanting your way
[47:49] and that one little brat that wants to
[47:51] always have everything your way
[47:52] so he's talking to i'm not pointing to
[47:54] any of you but he said you
[47:56] this this brat that only wants to you
[47:58] that always wants to have your way
[48:00] turn right back around and get
[48:02] everything you got
[48:03] the other way he has to be speaking to
[48:07] something greater in the brat
[48:11] because if the brat tells the brat you
[48:13] know to give everything away the brat's
[48:15] going to say uh
[48:16] uh right so this isn't psychology
[48:20] with the brat he's actually telling this
[48:21] person it has the holy ghost you want to
[48:23] overcome something you have an
[48:24] inferiority complex
[48:25] you you're selfish because of the way
[48:27] that you're raised you take
[48:28] exactly the opposite dig deep and find
[48:30] there's something inside of you
[48:32] that says when i want to be selfish i'm
[48:34] going to be giving
[48:36] when i'm only concerned about myself i'm
[48:37] going to be concerned about others is if
[48:39] you only want your way and your little
[48:40] breath that always wants to have
[48:41] everything your way
[48:42] turn right back around and give
[48:43] everything you got the other way
[48:45] if you want it to be this way then you
[48:48] step back
[48:49] and make sure it's another way it could
[48:51] be that way with just how everybody sits
[48:53] at a table at a restaurant
[48:55] um so let's see you sit here you sit
[48:57] there you sit there and you say here
[48:58] this is the way it needs to be oh no no
[49:00] don't mess this up this is perfect
[49:02] just take a step back and let everybody
[49:04] sit where they want to sit
[49:06] and you might be going the whole time
[49:08] greater is he that is in me
[49:11] greater is he and you what you'll be an
[49:14] overcomer pf changs
[49:18] there's a plug for mr fleming so he says
[49:21] turn
[49:22] everything and give everything you've
[49:23] got the other way if you're selfish and
[49:25] you want to hold everything
[49:26] then start giving away what you got
[49:30] doesn't that just i love how the word
[49:32] isn't going to kind of dance around it
[49:33] like some kind of psychology
[49:35] well what you need to do no he just says
[49:38] you're selfish give stuff away
[49:41] i i don't even need to enroll i don't
[49:43] need to listen to an audio book i don't
[49:44] need to
[49:45] i don't need to be hypnotized and so
[49:47] begin to think about when you first
[49:49] begin to have this problem
[49:50] you're getting very sleepy no i just do
[49:52] the opposite
[49:53] i'm a christian i'm a born-again
[49:55] believer i'm selfish i'm stingy just do
[49:58] the opposite
[50:00] do you realize how much you deny
[50:03] yourself when you live selfishly
[50:04] yeah let me just use a very uh
[50:08] innocent example
[50:12] if you don't want someone eating your
[50:14] food
[50:15] you'll never ask to eat somebody else's
[50:18] do you really
[50:18] realize how many bites you've missed out
[50:20] on if you're just
[50:22] open hey can i try that go for it
[50:25] can i try yours go for it but since
[50:28] you're selfish you would never think to
[50:29] ask to borrow
[50:31] right unless you're the worst kind of
[50:33] narcissist you know that
[50:34] you do have those i would never let you
[50:37] borrow my shovel can i have your rake
[50:40] we're just talking about how much you
[50:41] can deny yourself because you're selfish
[50:43] you think this way i would never ask
[50:44] somebody for that
[50:45] because i would never i would never want
[50:47] them to ask me that right
[50:49] and there's a way that brother brown was
[50:51] like breaking these ideas and these
[50:53] molds and these character
[50:54] thought processes say look if you have a
[50:56] tendency do the opposite
[50:58] that's his advice this is godly counsel
[51:02] if you're selfish you want to hold on to
[51:04] everything then start giving away what
[51:05] you got
[51:07] he says just go the vice versa
[51:11] i'm selfish i have a hard time i don't
[51:14] like to
[51:14] i don't like to give things away give
[51:16] things away
[51:18] start you realize how good it feels to
[51:20] not be selfish
[51:22] it really is how bound up and even how
[51:24] physically sick someone can be
[51:25] when they're so selfish then start
[51:28] giving away and their spirit begins to
[51:30] relax and their health begins to come
[51:31] back
[51:33] just go the vice versa that's the way to
[51:36] overcome
[51:36] anything is the antidote the antidote
[51:40] means
[51:40] the antidote the remedy against the
[51:42] poison
[51:44] what's the poison in my thought process
[51:45] what's the poison in my thinking
[51:47] what's the poison the way that i view
[51:48] others what would i instinctively do by
[51:51] the old man to somebody who's backslid
[51:53] what would i instinctively do to the old
[51:54] man to somebody who's left my church
[51:56] what would i instinctively do to
[51:57] somebody who's hurt me or harm me and
[51:59] what's the new way that ought to be
[52:00] thinking
[52:02] so that a root of bitterness does not
[52:03] come up so i'm not prejudiced so i don't
[52:06] close the door so that i'm not
[52:07] the one that pushes somebody away when
[52:09] they're just begging for somebody to
[52:11] bring them back and call them back
[52:14] the antidote is the remedy against the
[52:16] poison the vice versa
[52:19] so he says take exactly the opposite i
[52:21] think this is profound
[52:23] i just weighed in with my opinion on it
[52:24] i think it's profound
[52:26] if you have an inferiority complex some
[52:28] sort of complex a selfishness a
[52:29] stinginess
[52:30] take the opposite do something uncommon
[52:34] do something unprecedented that brother
[52:36] he's selfish
[52:38] he's boy he's stingy and he gives
[52:40] something away unprecedented
[52:43] uncommon but you know what overcoming
[52:47] so brother branham's asked this question
[52:49] it's question 405 brother branham
[52:52] when someone gets on me or steps on my
[52:54] toes as the old saying is
[52:56] my temper rises natural correct
[53:00] say that natural instinct otherwise you
[53:03] just don't have feeling maybe
[53:04] how can i overcome this thing i know the
[53:06] lord's will
[53:08] would have to do it the lord will have
[53:10] the lord will have to do excuse me
[53:11] i know the lord will have to do it but
[53:13] what can i do in my heart
[53:15] i don't want this thing beautiful
[53:18] acknowledges that it's going to take
[53:19] something
[53:20] from the lord but then take some
[53:22] responsibility to themselves
[53:24] how can i overcome my temper brother
[53:27] graham says sweeten your temper with
[53:28] prayer
[53:31] so if you have a temper sweeten it with
[53:33] prayer there's something you can do
[53:34] prayer sweetens our emotions tempers
[53:37] them tampers them down
[53:39] takes them and if they're out of 11
[53:41] brings them down a notch
[53:42] because they take them down down further
[53:44] and further and further sweeten your
[53:45] temper with prayer he says
[53:46] then make up your mind pray
[53:50] then make up your mind there's actually
[53:52] a resolve where you say you know what
[53:54] i'm not gonna get angry
[53:56] i'm not going to let this bother me i'm
[53:59] going to
[53:59] die to it if we could learn the
[54:03] that we have the power to die to things
[54:05] oh my goodness
[54:07] can i just testify for a moment
[54:10] i'd love to have an organ right now just
[54:12] really working it over because i just
[54:13] want to testify
[54:15] when i learned that i could die to
[54:17] things
[54:19] i was liberated i could become free
[54:22] that's horrible that's awful oh that
[54:25] just really really
[54:26] bothers me you know what i'm just gonna
[54:28] die to it you know what i'm fine
[54:30] i'm gonna pray for that situation i hope
[54:32] the lord gets his way in that i'm gonna
[54:34] be glorified somehow how can i help i'm
[54:35] not bothered by this i'm dead to it
[54:38] the ability to die to things that one
[54:39] time just eat at you and bother you
[54:42] and you're not you're not the problem
[54:43] you're not part of the solution what are
[54:45] you what are you worried about it for
[54:46] die to it
[54:48] the ability to just make up your mind
[54:50] i'm not gonna let that bother me
[54:53] you actually have power over it to just
[54:54] make that decision no
[54:56] this passive aggressiveness this
[54:57] narcissistic behavior
[54:59] this this needling me this picking on me
[55:01] all these dif i'm not gonna let it
[55:02] bother me
[55:04] we have to see ourselves as the eagles
[55:07] sitting there out in that field
[55:08] while that squirrel is just chirping
[55:10] away let them chirp all they want
[55:12] let them say what they want about you
[55:13] about where you fellowship about what
[55:15] you believe let them chirp all day long
[55:17] all you gotta do just lift right above
[55:20] it
[55:21] you're not squirrels you don't have a
[55:22] squirrel mentality as an eagle you could
[55:24] create a squirrel
[55:26] don't let him bother you he says then
[55:29] make up your mind
[55:31] he says i don't guess there's too many
[55:32] people in this building that have ever
[55:34] had
[55:35] any more temper than i did to begin with
[55:37] oh i had a mouth mashed all the time
[55:41] and i'd taken a lot of my meals out of a
[55:42] straw he's getting into fights
[55:45] why through a fence you offend me you
[55:47] pick on me you say something about me
[55:49] we're going to fight them fighting words
[55:51] all right you're going to go ahead and
[55:52] start swinging now
[55:54] it's important to note that as brother
[55:56] badam walks through this
[55:59] he's going to identify that this nature
[56:01] to fight died when he was born again
[56:05] and when you see a brawler there's a
[56:07] question mark
[56:09] there's a question mark on a brawler's
[56:10] experience because there's got to be
[56:12] when someone's quick to fight and when i
[56:14] say fight not just pick a
[56:15] argument but will actually physically
[56:17] assault somebody
[56:19] that's problematic and so what you that
[56:22] person would need to do
[56:23] if you are born again you must realize
[56:26] greater is he that is in you
[56:28] but if someone is characterized as a
[56:30] brother one that you know could
[56:31] physically punch you physically lay
[56:32] their hands on you
[56:33] physically assault you but everyone's
[56:34] identified there's something wrong with
[56:36] this attitude
[56:37] so if you have a temper you as a
[56:39] born-again believer sweeten your life
[56:41] with prayer
[56:41] your temper with prayer then make up
[56:43] your mind he says i used to have a
[56:44] mashed mouth all the time
[56:45] i'd taken a lot of meals out of a straw
[56:47] in other words he got mad at somebody
[56:48] because they offended him he got in a
[56:50] fight and he could no longer chew
[56:53] my mother's you know was a half indian
[56:55] and my father was an irishman a kentucky
[56:56] irish at that
[56:57] and both of them had enough temper to
[56:59] fight a buzz saw and all the time my
[57:01] mouth was mashed
[57:02] i was little to begin with and they'd
[57:04] just pick me up and knock me down and
[57:06] i'd get up again they'd knock me down
[57:07] again
[57:08] so i just got too unable to get up
[57:10] anymore that's always and then when i
[57:12] got able to get up i got up again they
[57:14] knocked me down again
[57:15] so that's just the way i had it i
[57:17] thought i can never be a christian
[57:20] but when the holy spirit came into my
[57:22] life that done it
[57:24] no more greater is he that is in you
[57:29] now this is an answer now i don't
[57:31] believe that what brother branham is
[57:32] trying to imply
[57:33] is this person who has a temper
[57:36] doesn't have the holy ghost but he's
[57:38] certainly making the point
[57:40] if you don't have it you're probably
[57:42] always going to be subject to that alone
[57:43] there's no nothing else to bring a
[57:44] subject
[57:46] when the holy spirit came to might that
[57:47] done it no more i had a woman one time i
[57:49] went to have the
[57:50] to cut the lights off and that day i had
[57:52] hair on top of my head
[57:54] at and he says and that day i had hair
[57:56] on top of my head she said you little
[57:57] kinky-headed idiot
[57:59] i told her said woman you ought to curse
[58:00] like that oh don't you fear god
[58:02] she said you little kinky-headed idiot
[58:05] if i wanted somebody to talk to me about
[58:06] those things i wouldn't get a halfwit
[58:08] like you
[58:08] whoo then she called me a blankety blank
[58:11] name oh my it had been a year farther
[58:14] i always said a man that strike a woman
[58:15] wasn't man enough to strike a man
[58:17] but i might have broke that at that time
[58:19] calling my mother a bad name like that
[58:22] he found the exception
[58:25] so this woman really pushed his buttons
[58:27] he said if it had just been a year
[58:28] earlier
[58:29] he would have said i've always had this
[58:30] rule that a man will hit a woman is not
[58:32] man enough to hit a man but i found my
[58:34] exception you know
[58:37] this world up and let her have he says
[58:38] but i might have broke it for that time
[58:40] calling my mother a bad name like that
[58:41] but you know what it never even phased
[58:43] me
[58:44] i said i'll pray for you never bothered
[58:47] i knowed right then
[58:48] something had happened to me i thank god
[58:51] that we have those things in our lives
[58:53] we realize something's happened to us
[58:56] this use this would have bothered me
[58:57] before something's transformed
[58:59] something's changed
[59:00] whether it be by virtue of the new birth
[59:02] or the maturing of your character and
[59:03] your spirit
[59:04] say that doesn't bother me anymore we're
[59:06] grateful to god when you say something
[59:07] happened
[59:09] i said if you have a temper sweeten your
[59:11] temper with prayer
[59:13] then make up your mind instead of
[59:16] fighting
[59:16] do the opposite of what the instinct is
[59:19] fight back say something back
[59:21] well if you don't say something back or
[59:22] you're going to do something no not my
[59:24] battle
[59:25] battle's the lords
[59:30] question 330. he said brother branham
[59:33] this is the question how am i supposed
[59:35] to show my wife that i really care for
[59:37] her
[59:38] and yet stay with the word but still
[59:41] have a question like this said
[59:43] why don't you practice what you preach
[59:44] or believe
[59:46] okay this is interesting how can i show
[59:50] my wife love and stay with the word
[59:52] when she's always saying why don't you
[59:53] practice what you preach or believe
[59:55] so he's acknowledging that within the
[59:57] context of a marriage and it could be
[59:59] assumed that he does
[1:00:00] love his wife and they're together but
[1:00:01] yet she doesn't believe what he believes
[1:00:03] so whenever he does something that's not
[1:00:05] he does something she uses what he
[1:00:07] believes against her
[1:00:08] against him and he's like this is a low
[1:00:10] blow this is cheap how can i keep loving
[1:00:12] my wife that's always throwing what i
[1:00:14] believe in my face
[1:00:15] how can i stay with the word and i don't
[1:00:17] know what word he might have been
[1:00:18] thinking about
[1:00:19] you know how can i stay with the word
[1:00:20] and you know i always had this word a
[1:00:22] man that hits a woman's not man enough
[1:00:23] to strike another man
[1:00:24] how can i stay with that when she sits
[1:00:26] there and throws this in my face
[1:00:27] why don't you practice what you preach
[1:00:29] or believe listen to his answer
[1:00:31] well then if the wife is saying this to
[1:00:33] you when she has a right to say it
[1:00:35] you better get right
[1:00:40] i love how the word deals with the one
[1:00:42] who professes the word
[1:00:44] somebody has an unbelieving spouse and
[1:00:47] the count the counsel doesn't go to the
[1:00:49] unbelieving spouse it goes to the
[1:00:50] believing spouse
[1:00:51] that this is what you can do this is
[1:00:54] what you're empowered to do you have a
[1:00:55] power you have a grace
[1:00:57] you have you can have a resolve and it's
[1:00:59] a word that's given to this man hey i'm
[1:01:01] in a bad situation here what can i do
[1:01:03] says well if he
[1:01:04] if she's thrown in your face and has a
[1:01:06] right to do it then you better get right
[1:01:08] since then if she's saying it just to be
[1:01:10] evil remember the bible said it was
[1:01:12] better than a millstone was hanging
[1:01:13] around your neck
[1:01:14] and drown in the depths of the sea then
[1:01:15] even defend the least of these my little
[1:01:17] ones
[1:01:18] now then that puts the this idea on the
[1:01:21] believing spouse's
[1:01:22] heart to realize oh my this isn't
[1:01:25] trivial the way they're treating me
[1:01:28] is an offense to god they're not just
[1:01:31] abusing you
[1:01:32] emotionally they're just not verbally
[1:01:34] abusing you they're just not
[1:01:35] manipulative or controlling of you
[1:01:37] they're actually doing this to a son or
[1:01:38] daughter of god brother i said hey if
[1:01:39] they're doing that to be evil just
[1:01:41] remember
[1:01:41] that if they do something like this to a
[1:01:43] little one of god a child of god
[1:01:45] it'd be better that a meal still be hung
[1:01:46] around their neck that's to provoke
[1:01:48] care or concern then for the other
[1:01:51] person
[1:01:53] not be like ha ha i forgot about that
[1:01:54] thanks brother branham
[1:01:57] next time she says son how's that
[1:01:58] millstone hanging huh
[1:02:00] i mean it's to provoke concern or care
[1:02:02] like oh my i don't want that to be i
[1:02:04] love her
[1:02:05] he goes now just that's just your
[1:02:07] question he says and maybe that this
[1:02:09] wife is not that type of person maybe
[1:02:11] she's not an evil person maybe she's not
[1:02:12] doing it maliciously
[1:02:14] maybe she's different maybe she's a good
[1:02:16] person
[1:02:17] maybe she's just testing you to see what
[1:02:19] you do
[1:02:21] so he says now stay in love with her and
[1:02:23] let her see jesus in you
[1:02:25] you do that he says so brother
[1:02:29] just be salty so brother just be salty
[1:02:32] she'll get thirsty
[1:02:33] if there's anything in her to thirst for
[1:02:37] do the opposite of what's instinctive
[1:02:41] because i realize that in your instinct
[1:02:43] you'd wanna you you wanna fight back
[1:02:45] that your instinct is maybe not to love
[1:02:47] your instinct
[1:02:48] is withdraw yourself he's saying you be
[1:02:50] salty stay in love with her
[1:02:52] he says how can i how am i supposed to
[1:02:54] show my wife that i care for her
[1:02:56] when she's always throwing this in my
[1:02:57] face don't let it affect you
[1:03:00] do the opposite of what someone would
[1:03:02] normally do in this situation
[1:03:04] meet the the criticism with the same
[1:03:05] intensity oh yeah well you're not a
[1:03:08] christian yourself and just
[1:03:10] fireworks back and forth guns are
[1:03:12] blazing
[1:03:14] why don't you practice what you preach
[1:03:15] or believe he's saying just stay in love
[1:03:17] with her
[1:03:18] let her see jesus in you just be salty
[1:03:22] he says because she could be testing you
[1:03:26] in each one of these questions i i felt
[1:03:28] to kind of walk through these because
[1:03:30] and i realized maybe i didn't do them
[1:03:31] justice and because of the timing
[1:03:34] and getting time getting away from us
[1:03:36] and you could have
[1:03:37] dealt more specifically with some of the
[1:03:39] nuances of each one of these scenarios
[1:03:41] but the counsel that brother branham's
[1:03:42] given giving
[1:03:45] it's opposite to what you would
[1:03:47] instinctively want to do in each
[1:03:48] situation
[1:03:50] we acknowledge this is good godly
[1:03:52] counsel take the opposite sweeten your
[1:03:53] temp with prayer and make up your mind
[1:03:55] and
[1:03:56] and let the holy ghost change you and
[1:03:58] just stay salty just stay in love with
[1:04:00] her
[1:04:01] it's really challenging the believer and
[1:04:03] this these could only be questions
[1:04:05] answered this way to someone who already
[1:04:08] has the holy ghost
[1:04:09] otherwise you'd say well you guys need
[1:04:11] counseling for sure
[1:04:12] because you're both going to have to
[1:04:14] moderate your behavior and your thinking
[1:04:16] to get on the same page and not that
[1:04:18] counseling is wrong in the context of
[1:04:19] holy spirit
[1:04:20] believers but he's actually in that with
[1:04:22] in the absence of counseling
[1:04:24] recognizing a solution as brother harold
[1:04:28] beckham said divorce is
[1:04:29] is too selfish people living under the
[1:04:31] same roof
[1:04:32] in other words if one person will be
[1:04:34] self-sacrificial if one person would be
[1:04:36] willing to say you know what i'll
[1:04:37] sacrifice myself
[1:04:39] i'll humble myself i'll be salty i'll
[1:04:41] get beneath him
[1:04:42] he said that's enough to turn the thing
[1:04:44] turn things around
[1:04:47] and i want to bring it to a close with
[1:04:50] this
[1:04:52] as we're looking at putting on the new
[1:04:53] man taking off the old man
[1:04:56] and doing the opposite the samaritan
[1:04:58] represents the rule breaker
[1:05:00] he did what was unprecedented he did
[1:05:03] what was uncommon or unexpected he was
[1:05:05] the outlier
[1:05:07] all these data points would all be
[1:05:09] lumped together the priests the levite
[1:05:10] and even maybe the samaritans they all
[1:05:12] would have passed on by they all would
[1:05:13] have been found within this particular
[1:05:15] segment but then a
[1:05:16] certain samaritan the bible just doesn't
[1:05:19] say
[1:05:20] any samaritan a certain samaritan this
[1:05:22] was one that was an outlier this wasn't
[1:05:24] one that was maybe even like all other
[1:05:25] samaritans certainly wasn't like the
[1:05:26] priest or the levite he wasn't like
[1:05:28] every other man that walked by that way
[1:05:30] he was an outlier they had been taking a
[1:05:34] poll
[1:05:35] and by the polls that have been taken
[1:05:38] they would say that
[1:05:39] the group of thieves and the priests and
[1:05:41] the levite they'd say that you know
[1:05:43] so far three out of three don't like
[1:05:45] this guy
[1:05:48] and then finally one comes along and you
[1:05:51] have this
[1:05:52] outlier it doesn't fit within the data
[1:05:54] set doesn't fit with the trend doesn't
[1:05:56] fit with the norm
[1:05:57] he's way outside the what would be
[1:05:59] expected
[1:06:00] he didn't even conform to the
[1:06:02] stereotypes of the three
[1:06:04] of the two that passed by the priest and
[1:06:06] levi they would have been expected to
[1:06:07] stop the samaritan may have been given a
[1:06:09] pass
[1:06:10] well i mean these guys don't really get
[1:06:11] along anyways
[1:06:13] when it came time when jesus met the
[1:06:15] woman at the well in john chapter 4
[1:06:16] verse 9
[1:06:18] said woman give me a drink this is her
[1:06:19] first instinct then saith the woman of
[1:06:21] samara unto him
[1:06:22] how is it that thou being a jew asked
[1:06:26] asketh drink of me which am a woman of
[1:06:28] samaria
[1:06:30] for the jews have no dealings with the
[1:06:32] samaritans
[1:06:34] she's immediately recognizing that this
[1:06:37] is not
[1:06:37] normal for a jew to ask a samaritan for
[1:06:40] a drink of water
[1:06:42] it would not be expected for one of us
[1:06:44] to ask the other for
[1:06:45] something nor would it be expected that
[1:06:48] the other would acquiesce and grant what
[1:06:50] was what
[1:06:50] requested she said this is bizarre
[1:06:54] you're a jew i'm a samaria samaritan i'm
[1:06:56] a samarian
[1:06:57] i'm not somebody you would normally talk
[1:06:59] to
[1:07:00] let alone ask a question of ask for a
[1:07:03] drink
[1:07:04] by our social norms and what's socially
[1:07:06] accepted i could say
[1:07:08] forget you i'm not getting you a drink
[1:07:09] get your own jew
[1:07:12] but this is this is this is just drawing
[1:07:14] attention to the fact
[1:07:15] that the samaritan didn't conform to
[1:07:18] what would have been socially acceptable
[1:07:20] at the time
[1:07:21] what he would have been given a pass if
[1:07:22] he had walked on by
[1:07:27] it example it is an example to me this
[1:07:30] amplifies john 4 9 amplifies
[1:07:32] his willingness to do the right thing
[1:07:35] and then if you look at luke chapter 10
[1:07:37] verse 35 i know we didn't read it
[1:07:39] tonight but we'll read it now
[1:07:40] his willingness to do the right thing
[1:07:42] then influenced others
[1:07:46] because he he acted alone but for him
[1:07:49] acting
[1:07:51] this man probably would have died and
[1:07:54] but for him
[1:07:55] acting no one else would have been given
[1:07:56] an opportunity such as this host
[1:07:59] to likewise help and i want to phrase it
[1:08:03] this way though i don't think it's
[1:08:04] apparent in the text and if i'm taking
[1:08:06] some liberty
[1:08:07] please forgive me if it's too much and
[1:08:09] on the morrow when he departed
[1:08:11] because he went and went to an end took
[1:08:12] him to an end had the man stay with him
[1:08:15] and on the moral he departed he took out
[1:08:16] two pence and gave them to the host
[1:08:19] and said unto him take care of him and
[1:08:22] whatsoever thou
[1:08:23] spend this more when i come again i will
[1:08:25] repay thee
[1:08:27] and i'm assuming this but i believe it's
[1:08:29] implied by the text
[1:08:31] that the host of this inn took the two
[1:08:34] pence
[1:08:35] and this man who was beaten and wounded
[1:08:39] and was willing to take the two pence
[1:08:40] and use it for his care
[1:08:43] and then spend of his own in trust
[1:08:46] that this man would return and pay him
[1:08:48] back
[1:08:51] and this inspired then the host
[1:08:54] to do something that would be going
[1:08:56] above and beyond what an innkeeper would
[1:08:58] normally do
[1:09:00] this this inspires now the host sees
[1:09:02] this and maybe he recognized this man
[1:09:04] who's beaten
[1:09:05] and he recognized this is a man this is
[1:09:07] a man this is the jew that stayed with
[1:09:08] me before
[1:09:10] i recognize this man and a samaritan
[1:09:12] brings him in
[1:09:13] maybe he knew the path to know well
[1:09:14] enough who had passed by that day also
[1:09:18] i saw a priest go by and he didn't bring
[1:09:20] this guy in
[1:09:21] i saw levite go in i
[1:09:24] i just gave a room to a levite he didn't
[1:09:27] stop and help this guy
[1:09:28] and a samaritan does
[1:09:32] and if this man may have if he had
[1:09:33] crawled up
[1:09:35] to this inn half naked half dead or
[1:09:38] naked and half dead
[1:09:39] the innkeeper said sorry this ain't a
[1:09:40] hospital
[1:09:42] but the samaritan because he acted in an
[1:09:44] uncommon way
[1:09:45] in an unprecedented way another was
[1:09:48] willing to do the same and again let's
[1:09:52] look at this slide for this group
[1:09:53] experiment
[1:09:57] remember this which line on the right
[1:10:01] is the same length as the line on the
[1:10:04] left
[1:10:04] does anyone know can we all just say it
[1:10:06] together c
[1:10:08] see c is
[1:10:12] now i'm not tricking you i'm all of a
[1:10:13] sudden going to put a ruler over here
[1:10:14] and it's a and you're like oh
[1:10:16] no need to reevaluate everything i've
[1:10:19] been thinking
[1:10:20] oh that's the right answer
[1:10:23] and so when they did this study one time
[1:10:26] they thought they they figured let's
[1:10:28] just do it a little bit differently
[1:10:31] you have five actors and one participant
[1:10:35] in the prior experi experiments five of
[1:10:38] them gave the wrong answer
[1:10:40] 97 percent of the time 75 percent of
[1:10:43] time i think another time is 67
[1:10:44] of time the the participant the subject
[1:10:47] of the study
[1:10:49] joined the five and given the wrong
[1:10:51] answer
[1:10:53] then they redid the experiment and had
[1:10:56] four
[1:10:56] give the wrong answer and one
[1:10:59] give the right answer and they found
[1:11:03] that
[1:11:03] one actor all it took was one
[1:11:06] actor to give a different answer than
[1:11:09] the majority
[1:11:10] just one person tell the truth
[1:11:13] and conformity to the group was reduced
[1:11:15] to 36 percent from 97
[1:11:18] in one study all they needed was
[1:11:21] one dissenter one
[1:11:24] outlier in the group a a
[1:11:27] a a c c
[1:11:32] that's all it took so they could have
[1:11:35] said 97 percent of time in this study
[1:11:37] the subject the participant gives the
[1:11:40] wrong answer when five people
[1:11:41] give the wrong answer and so it would
[1:11:44] have been expected
[1:11:46] a a a and then all you would say well
[1:11:48] this one would probably say
[1:11:50] a and maybe they begin to change their
[1:11:53] answer
[1:11:54] and they begin to purpose i'm going to
[1:11:56] say a but then all of a sudden someone
[1:11:57] says
[1:11:58] see and they're inspired
[1:12:02] to tell the truth they're inspired to do
[1:12:05] the right thing
[1:12:06] and this is what one of the studies
[1:12:07] concluded the present of a dissenter the
[1:12:10] presence rather
[1:12:11] the presence of a dissenter made it
[1:12:13] possible to deviate from the majority
[1:12:16] and give the right answer the dissenter
[1:12:20] and
[1:12:20] some of these studies were called
[1:12:21] blockers or objectors
[1:12:25] someone willing to say the truth
[1:12:28] someone willing to do what's right even
[1:12:30] when everyone else isn't doing it and i
[1:12:32] know it's easy for us just to put
[1:12:33] blinders on and think about the
[1:12:34] the ramifications of this with respect
[1:12:36] to the study but let's just think about
[1:12:38] our lives how people are treated
[1:12:40] politics and churches and and group
[1:12:43] dynamics and even in our neighborhoods
[1:12:45] and our families thanksgiving's coming
[1:12:46] up this is all really good teaching
[1:12:48] for family dynamics and during the
[1:12:50] holiday season
[1:12:52] right think about how we ought to be
[1:12:54] thinking differently acting differently
[1:12:56] not going along with the flow not
[1:12:58] allowing the crowd to influence us
[1:13:00] and it says all it took was for one
[1:13:03] to act differently than the rest
[1:13:06] and it empowered the next person to do
[1:13:09] the same
[1:13:10] you realize in the book of daniel
[1:13:12] daniel's the one that said hey you know
[1:13:13] what i don't want to eat the king's meat
[1:13:15] i don't want to drink the king's wine
[1:13:17] just give me vegetables one man
[1:13:19] said no and three others joined
[1:13:23] just one man that's the power of the
[1:13:25] dissenter
[1:13:27] that's the power of the blocker i'm so
[1:13:29] glad that in laodicea when the whole
[1:13:31] church world was going one way
[1:13:33] a little a little kentuckian named
[1:13:35] william branham stood up as an objector
[1:13:38] stood up as a dissenter stood up as a
[1:13:39] blocker and here you are
[1:13:46] and this is the part to me that is so
[1:13:48] remarkable oh my
[1:13:51] getting late we'll sing fewer songs
[1:13:54] the dissenter doesn't need to be popular
[1:13:58] the dissenter doesn't need to be
[1:13:59] charismatic or gifted or or one that
[1:14:01] would have a better
[1:14:02] view of the screen as it were they just
[1:14:04] had to be willing to stand
[1:14:07] and so they tested this they wanted to
[1:14:08] there's if you do a study and that's why
[1:14:10] if someone says well they did a study
[1:14:12] and they said that all these people
[1:14:13] you know um did this and did that you
[1:14:15] got it what kind of study was it was
[1:14:17] there proper controls in place what
[1:14:19] was the size of the group that they
[1:14:21] studied i mean it was only three people
[1:14:24] all three people got a sunburn when they
[1:14:25] were out in the sun so
[1:14:27] anybody who stands out in the sun is
[1:14:28] going to get a sunburn you want to
[1:14:30] you want to study a little bit more
[1:14:31] expansive than that and so they're
[1:14:33] trying to control for the
[1:14:35] whether or not what was actually a bias
[1:14:37] what was actually moving inside these
[1:14:39] people
[1:14:39] they controlled for it this way or
[1:14:41] actually presented the study differently
[1:14:42] this way
[1:14:43] and les the person who is objecting
[1:14:46] something about that person was the
[1:14:48] influencing factor
[1:14:50] on the the participant they took
[1:14:53] somebody and they put him in the room
[1:14:55] beforehand and i know i'm getting
[1:14:56] bogged down in the details of this but i
[1:14:58] hope it just strikes you with with some
[1:15:00] encouragement
[1:15:01] they took the participant and they put
[1:15:03] them in room
[1:15:04] in the room with the actor who would
[1:15:06] give the right answer
[1:15:08] and he had coke bottle glasses on
[1:15:12] and they put him in the room and they
[1:15:14] said you have to fill out this form
[1:15:17] and so this guy with the coke bottle
[1:15:19] glasses went in there
[1:15:20] and he said could you fill this out for
[1:15:23] me i can't see a thing
[1:15:26] or it might have been you have to write
[1:15:27] what's on this board down on this piece
[1:15:29] of paper you say
[1:15:30] hey i'm practically blind with these
[1:15:32] glasses on
[1:15:33] could you do this for me and so the
[1:15:35] participant
[1:15:36] was like man this guy's blind with
[1:15:38] glasses that thick you'd think he'd be
[1:15:39] able to magnify things
[1:15:41] you know all right fine fills it out
[1:15:43] they go into the room
[1:15:44] and lo and behold the question is asked
[1:15:46] you could put those lines up
[1:15:50] which line on the right is the same as
[1:15:52] the line on the left
[1:15:55] and all the well sighted people said a
[1:15:59] a a a a and then all of a sudden the
[1:16:01] blind guy goes
[1:16:03] see and that was enough
[1:16:08] to empower the participant to say see
[1:16:11] also
[1:16:13] because they weren't relying on that
[1:16:14] person's ability it wasn't that whether
[1:16:16] charismatic whether gifted
[1:16:17] didn't matter if the if the the
[1:16:19] everything was beautiful and well placed
[1:16:21] it was oh this is a fancy place or
[1:16:23] whatever it might be
[1:16:24] just the truth was lifted up
[1:16:28] all it took was one willing to stand
[1:16:30] they didn't have to be the best
[1:16:31] they didn't have to be the most popular
[1:16:33] didn't have to be the most gifted they
[1:16:34] just had to be one who could speak truth
[1:16:37] and that would empower the other one to
[1:16:39] say i stand for truth also
[1:16:42] and let me let me close with this and
[1:16:46] and i and i i
[1:16:47] not certain just how far the lord will
[1:16:49] continue to
[1:16:50] explore this subject to who is my
[1:16:52] neighbor and i want i've been inspired
[1:16:54] by certain things about the samaritan
[1:16:56] that i want to share with you
[1:16:57] but let me just maybe seal this part as
[1:17:00] we before we go deeply into who the
[1:17:02] samaritan is
[1:17:03] what i'm talking about now is this
[1:17:05] samaritan was willing to take a risk
[1:17:09] and i want you to see yourself as the
[1:17:11] samaritan
[1:17:12] in a world that's gone insane as a world
[1:17:14] that's gone crazy
[1:17:15] you are the gentile bride you're not the
[1:17:17] priest you're not the levi you're a
[1:17:19] spiritual king spiritual priest
[1:17:21] raised up as gentiles in this last day
[1:17:23] to be god's
[1:17:24] army to be god's bride and we also like
[1:17:28] whether it be this
[1:17:29] participant in this study or this
[1:17:30] dissenter we must like this
[1:17:33] outlier samaritan who is a rule breaker
[1:17:35] we must be willing to take the risk
[1:17:39] to endure the criticism
[1:17:42] to suffer rejection
[1:17:48] you have to be willing to take the risk
[1:17:51] and let me say this
[1:17:53] i'm looking at a people who are willing
[1:17:54] to do that
[1:17:56] the people who are here tonight are
[1:17:59] people who've walked this path
[1:18:02] willing to follow the leadership of the
[1:18:03] lord regardless of what the costs are
[1:18:06] and the things that god can do with
[1:18:08] people who are willing
[1:18:10] to risk popularity
[1:18:13] willing to risk social acceptance
[1:18:15] willing to break out of their comfort
[1:18:16] zone and what's normal to them
[1:18:18] willing to do things that they know is
[1:18:19] not the normal path willing to be
[1:18:21] do something unprecedented or unheard of
[1:18:25] willing to endure the pain for the
[1:18:26] moment knowing that there's glory that
[1:18:28] comes from pain
[1:18:31] willing to do the opposite
[1:18:34] that's what we must be willing to do and
[1:18:36] as a church we must be willing to do
[1:18:38] that
[1:18:40] i've been pondering this and it's just
[1:18:41] been really uh
[1:18:45] inspiring me and challenging me
[1:18:48] spiritual inertia is the death of a
[1:18:49] church
[1:18:52] and of our our personal joy you say
[1:18:55] spiritual inertia
[1:18:57] what kind of classes are you taking
[1:19:00] inertia it's just basically the
[1:19:02] principle that however something is it's
[1:19:03] going to remain that way
[1:19:05] the tendency to do nothing or to remain
[1:19:08] unchanged
[1:19:10] and that's that's that would be the
[1:19:12] death to a church that's the death of
[1:19:14] our spiritual joy that's the death
[1:19:16] of our spirituality when we're so inert
[1:19:19] we just remain as we are oh i've been
[1:19:22] this way for 40 years
[1:19:23] really i'm sure there's a lot of upsides
[1:19:27] to it
[1:19:27] a lot of positives but that's not the
[1:19:29] gospel we're walking in
[1:19:31] the light is always moving it doesn't
[1:19:34] say if we stand in the light as the
[1:19:36] light is always standing still
[1:19:38] we have fellowship with one another and
[1:19:39] the blood of jesus christ cleanses us
[1:19:40] all our unrighteousness says if you walk
[1:19:42] in the light
[1:19:44] as he is in the light so you have to be
[1:19:46] walking in the light
[1:19:48] this inertia this just remaining
[1:19:50] unchanged remaining as they are the
[1:19:51] tendency to do nothing
[1:19:52] that's going to be the death of your
[1:19:54] spirituality
[1:19:56] and a certain samaritan walked by and
[1:19:59] did what every other samaritan every
[1:20:01] other jew
[1:20:01] would not have done and they did
[1:20:03] something uncommon did something unheard
[1:20:05] of and it made the difference in a
[1:20:06] person's life and i want you to likewise
[1:20:09] be challenged
[1:20:10] to break the spiritual inertia be
[1:20:11] willing to take the risk willing to be
[1:20:13] rejected willing to endure pain
[1:20:16] to see that christ is glorified
[1:20:20] and to do what is the hardest thing to
[1:20:23] do

[1:21:02] you have a need you have that
[1:21:04] liberty a son or daughter of god to make
[1:21:06] your needs known to him
[1:21:07] whether you lift your hands to him or

[1:21:12] come forward for prayer whatever it
[1:21:13] might be you have that
[1:21:15] you follow the leadership of the lord in
[1:21:16] your heart this is the prayer that i
[1:21:19] i want to bring together as a body
[1:21:22] lord i'm willing to change
[1:21:26] i'm willing to do things that are
[1:21:27] unprecedented
[1:21:29] i'm willing to do that which is uncommon
[1:21:34] you say lord
[1:21:38] create in me lord
[1:21:41] say tonight lord i'm putting on a new
[1:21:43] man
[1:21:45] i know it's challenging i know there's
[1:21:47] life circumstances that are very
[1:21:49] difficult
[1:21:50] i even realize that it's easy for
[1:21:51] someone to hear these things and
[1:21:53] create a general rule that we want to
[1:21:54] impose upon everybody and
[1:21:56] you know just like we're just trying to
[1:21:58] beat something into submission no that's
[1:22:00] not it
[1:22:02] but it's allowing ourselves to come
[1:22:03] under god's microscope
[1:22:05] say lord search my heart see if there be
[1:22:08] with our heads bowed i'd like to pray
[1:22:10] for god to change us
[1:22:13] our gracious heavenly father tonight
[1:22:15] lord as we stand in your divine presence
[1:22:20] we take fully lord this instruction from
[1:22:23] your prophet
[1:22:25] to do the opposite to sweeten our temper
[1:22:29] with prayer and to
[1:22:30] make up our minds to be salty
[1:22:34] to get right whatever it might be lord
[1:22:37] we realize that his advice is uncommon
[1:22:39] we realize the direction he's pointing
[1:22:41] it is against the grain
[1:22:45] and so lord as we accept these truths
[1:22:48] we ask that you would change us
[1:22:53] let me not remain as i am
[1:22:57] but change me o god
[1:23:00] lord i i am not despising what i am
[1:23:05] because i'm not what i used to be
[1:23:08] but lord i'm not what i want to be so
[1:23:11] change me
[1:23:14] and i pray lord that as you have begun a
[1:23:16] good work in us
[1:23:18] we know that you will finish it
[1:23:22] and as a church lord you've led a number
[1:23:24] of people many people lord in a very
[1:23:26] unique uncommon way
[1:23:29] to come and gather and be part of a
[1:23:30] church
[1:23:33] and lord i see the sacrifices
[1:23:36] that are made the losses that have been
[1:23:39] experienced
[1:23:41] the treachery that faces some and
[1:23:46] the intimidation the threats of being
[1:23:48] ostracized
[1:23:51] lord the feeling that they could
[1:23:52] immediately be put out of a circle lord
[1:23:56] but yet they're willing to take a risk
[1:24:00] to be an outlier to do what's uncommon
[1:24:03] or unprecedented
[1:24:05] lord not by joining a church
[1:24:09] but by following the leadership of the
[1:24:11] holy spirit
[1:24:12] and i pray that as you have led your
[1:24:14] people
[1:24:16] not just to a new church that's starting
[1:24:19] but lord as you have led them throughout
[1:24:20] their lives may they never despise it
[1:24:22] may they never belittle it
[1:24:23] may they never get far from it father
[1:24:25] may you continue to lead them
[1:24:27] and tonight lord we humble ourselves
[1:24:29] before you
[1:24:30] and say change my heart oh god
[1:24:33] continue lord to do what in me what i am
[1:24:36] unable to do
[1:24:37] lord i identify with the one that said
[1:24:39] lord i i need god to do it if he will do
[1:24:42] it
[1:24:42] but lord what can i do in my heart to
[1:24:45] change
[1:24:47] changes we pray commit the people to you
[1:24:50] specifically tonight desire and that
[1:24:52] there's something
[1:24:53] imparted something done something begun
[1:24:55] super something supernatural
[1:24:57] put an emotion tonight for us
[1:25:00] that we could see a change and a benefit
[1:25:02] by it lord may we all who have heard
[1:25:04] tonight
[1:25:05] leave and be the objector be the
[1:25:07] dissenter be the blocker
[1:25:10] contrary to the statistics contrary to
[1:25:13] the prevailing flow
[1:25:14] may we stand against the tide go the
[1:25:16] opposite way and lord because we're
[1:25:18] willing to do so may our son follow us
[1:25:20] may our daughter follow us may our loved
[1:25:22] ones follow us
[1:25:22] may they find that we've stood for truth
[1:25:25] we're following the light
[1:25:28] and may it inspire others to live for
[1:25:30] you to leave sin
[1:25:34] to walk in a plain path commit your
[1:25:37] people tonight to you
[1:25:39] as you have cared for them may they sink
[1:25:41] into that care
[1:25:43] and yield to you in the name of the lord
[1:25:45] jesus christ we pray
[1:25:48] amen
