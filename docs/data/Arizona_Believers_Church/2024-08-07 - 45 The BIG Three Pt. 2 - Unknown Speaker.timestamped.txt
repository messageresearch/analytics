[0:00] I know we're past the middle part of the
[0:03] year but we're continuing on uh subject
[0:05] we start at the very beginning on the
[0:06] house of the Lord and these things are
[0:10] I'm keeping it within this uh Channel
[0:12] and this subject of the house of the
[0:14] Lord because these things have been
[0:15] inspired by the different subjects we've
[0:17] already ministered on in this subject of
[0:19] the house of the Lord and I'll I want to
[0:22] do part two on the big three and we did
[0:25] Sunday on the first part I'll take time
[0:28] uh just to recapture some of that in the
[0:30] outset but I will tell you tonight I
[0:31] just want to do uh two things I want to
[0:34] show that money women and popularity are
[0:36] connected with the big three and for
[0:38] some of the visitors think of the big
[0:39] three give me their names brother Aaron
[0:42] want to know who they are but um I want
[0:44] to just show that money women in
[0:46] popularity are connected with that big
[0:47] three and number two those of us who are
[0:50] familiar with the money women and
[0:51] popularity I want us to understand it
[0:53] applies to us all not just preachers and
[0:56] I'm glad to have a pastor here tonight
[0:57] who can really get behind me on this now
[0:59] in first John 2: 16 And1 17 this is
[1:03] where we'll see what I'm calling the big
[1:05] three for all that is in the world the
[1:07] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[1:09] and the pride of life is not of the
[1:12] father but is of the world and the world
[1:14] passeth away and the lust thereof but he
[1:16] that doeth the will of God abideth
[1:18] forever so here in John chapter 1 John
[1:21] Chapter 2 we could see what I'm calling
[1:23] the big three the lust of the flesh the
[1:25] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[1:28] brother bandom shows us that these three
[1:31] uh things that are all that is in the
[1:33] world are the three ways that Jesus was
[1:35] tempted in the wilderness and was also
[1:38] present in the Temptation and the Garden
[1:39] of Eden and then in the Ser sermon
[1:42] Harvest Time which we've been studying
[1:43] out of for quite some time now he says
[1:45] the three Temptations of Jesus the three
[1:48] Temptations of ministers today where
[1:50] they make the fall three Temptations of
[1:52] the church and where they make their
[1:54] fall three Temptations of an
[1:56] organization where it makes its fall and
[1:58] the three Temptations in the individual
[2:00] and where they make their fall now if
[2:02] John says all that is in the world is
[2:04] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[2:05] eyes and the pride of life then we're
[2:07] not necessarily coming up with 12 to 15
[2:09] different Temptations but we'll find
[2:11] that these three Temptations would have
[2:14] root in any one of these three to
[2:16] ministers to churches to organizations
[2:18] or individuals I have to come back to it
[2:20] sometime uh even if it's not exactly
[2:23] specifically the same thing it'd have to
[2:24] come back to one of these big three now
[2:27] let me just go through by review very
[2:29] quick Qui L on these
[2:32] three in lust of the flesh we looked at
[2:35] how this implies some lack of moderation
[2:38] lack of self-control uh some
[2:40] intemperance and it was putting bodily
[2:43] hunger above uh anything else and bodily
[2:46] hunger bodily thirst whatever that body
[2:48] wants it goes first we saw how the Bible
[2:51] says I've esteemed your word more than
[2:52] my necessary meat and had a brother tell
[2:55] me that on on earlier this week I think
[2:57] it was yesterday that he and his wife
[2:59] had been really wrestling with something
[3:01] I said on Sunday and said that uh they
[3:03] usually use vanity uh to Oppo overcome
[3:06] gluttony or gluttony to overcome vanity
[3:08] and they haven't been able to eat since
[3:10] W uh Sunday and I said well just choose
[3:12] the lesser of two evils and he said my
[3:14] wife is baking right
[3:16] now and so we did want to kind of focus
[3:19] on the idea that you it's kind of
[3:21] whenever the what Sprite has told us to
[3:23] do obey your thirst right that if the
[3:25] body wants something go get it feed it
[3:27] satisfy it and this was Satan's first
[3:30] line of attack with Jesus in Luke
[3:32] chapter 4 where he tempted him when he
[3:34] was hungry to turn stones to bread and
[3:36] Jesus was very quick to say I'm hungry
[3:38] and I do need to eat if I if this body
[3:40] is going to be sustained but man shall
[3:42] not live by bread alone the bodily
[3:45] hunger uh the the senses of this body do
[3:48] not govern us ultimately but the word
[3:51] must be our meat and so it was uh we
[3:53] could see the wrong emphasis being put
[3:55] on it the wrong perception and
[3:57] priorities even in the garden when the
[4:00] woman was tempted when in Genesis 3:6
[4:03] the woman saw that the tree was good for
[4:06] food so the wrong kind of emphasis was
[4:08] placed on it that she was Finding
[4:10] feelings in her body and this desire to
[4:13] satisfy things saw it as good for food
[4:16] and her priorities are wrong and her
[4:18] perception was wrong that's in the lust
[4:20] of the eyes we saw that it was uh
[4:22] satisfying the pleasures of our
[4:24] imagination and this uh The Temptations
[4:26] of vain entertainment and to covet
[4:29] things that are visible and to uh want
[4:32] what you see and how that that pertained
[4:35] though there were outward things that we
[4:36] see but that eye is a gate to the spirit
[4:40] and how we'd have these senses in our
[4:41] spirit how the eye brother B says almost
[4:43] governs them all even in our natural
[4:45] senses and it's a governing of our
[4:47] spiritual senses to where there's things
[4:49] that you're lusting after and you want
[4:50] and it has more to do with the Optics of
[4:52] things uh and what it makes your spirit
[4:55] feel and so Jesus in Luke chapter 4 he
[4:58] was offered all the kingdoms shall shown
[5:00] all of them in a moment and they were
[5:02] offered to him and it would have spoke
[5:04] to Something in Jesus's heart like yeah
[5:06] this is this is something you want isn't
[5:07] it something you want but it was
[5:09] contrary to the will of God and and and
[5:12] not in the right order the right way
[5:14] that it ought to be enjoyed or to be
[5:16] received and then in Genesis 3:6 the
[5:17] woman saw that the tree was pleasant saw
[5:20] it as pleasant to the eyes different
[5:22] than um good for food and it's different
[5:25] than being beautiful but it was pleasant
[5:26] to the eyes other some something excited
[5:29] in her spirit
[5:30] I think I've used the example before the
[5:32] way that she was looking at this fruit
[5:33] is not the way that we look at a really
[5:35] good green chili burrito am it was now
[5:39] something in her spirit to lust and to
[5:41] desire after so she saw it as pleasant
[5:44] and then the pride of life and the pride
[5:46] of life there's a whole lot here that's
[5:48] we touched on it very quickly on Sunday
[5:50] this desire for recognition or honor uh
[5:53] the seeking of attention or certainly
[5:55] seeking of status and and position there
[5:58] was this try to point out um and not in
[6:01] great detail but very quickly how it's
[6:03] kind of showing off where the Pharisees
[6:05] wanted to make broad their felies and
[6:07] how many how many people went and looked
[6:08] it up right and they wanted to make
[6:10] things look bigger where they kept the
[6:12] word their Scrolls and they wanted to
[6:13] make their garments look a certain way
[6:15] because they wanted to be noticed and so
[6:17] they were kind of uh like peacocks
[6:19] trying to show off a little bit or maybe
[6:22] black birds with peacock feathers they
[6:23] were wanting to show off and make
[6:25] themselves look like something they
[6:26] weren't so they're coming across as
[6:28] hypocrites and in there we see that
[6:30] there's the wrong
[6:32] motivation maybe maybe they're you're
[6:34] doing the right thing but your your
[6:36] motivation and objective is wrong
[6:38] because you're trying to call attention
[6:39] to yourself and in Luke chapter 4 you
[6:41] can find these also in Matthew 4 Satan
[6:44] tempted Christ to tempt God he tempted
[6:48] him to tempt God by wanting him to jump
[6:50] off the Pinnacle of the temple in front
[6:51] of everybody and force God to rescue him
[6:55] and he says Thou shalt not tempt the
[6:56] Lord thy God and brother bradam uh
[6:59] equated that to uh snake handlers and
[7:01] those that drink poison and some of
[7:02] those things and he said answer that
[7:04] question I'm among snake handlers what
[7:06] about it and so there's this uh a show
[7:09] where I want to God said he would keep
[7:11] us from getting snake bit so let's just
[7:12] tempt God by handling snakes and God
[7:15] said that he would rescue you if you
[7:16] jump down before all the people in the
[7:19] temple and then God will come and back
[7:20] up his word won't he back up his word
[7:23] and so there was this tempting him to
[7:25] force God to do something publicly to
[7:27] vindicate him to prove he was what the
[7:29] Son of God right and the woman in
[7:32] Genesis 3 she lusted for knowledge she
[7:34] saw that the tree was be to be desired
[7:36] to make one wise and she wanted to know
[7:39] beyond what was right she wanted to know
[7:42] beyond what was holy she wanted
[7:44] knowledge of of Good and Evil something
[7:46] that God had withheld from her in his
[7:49] wisdom so those are that's the big
[7:52] three and now money women in popularity
[7:56] I believe that these can line up with
[7:58] the lust of the flesh the of the eyes
[8:00] and the pride of
[8:01] life now I'm going to take uh years
[8:05] worth of statements or covering over
[8:08] years worth of or just the entirety of
[8:10] brother bram's Ministry just some quick
[8:11] bullet points of things that he said he
[8:13] said money women and popularity are
[8:15] three things that a minister must watch
[8:19] he says it that that hurt ministers that
[8:21] hinder a minister that bring a minister
[8:24] back to the rut that wreck a ministers
[8:27] life from the start uh how many of you
[8:29] already had those memorized right just
[8:31] da da da da you can read them off they
[8:33] he must watch this it hurts ministers it
[8:35] hinders a minister it brings them back
[8:36] to a rut uh it wrecks his ministry or
[8:39] his life from the start these three
[8:41] things money women and
[8:43] popularity and this is what brother BR
[8:45] says often when he's talking about
[8:47] ministers and one thing that I thought
[8:49] was very interesting and I've kind of
[8:50] got lost in it in studying maybe
[8:52] distracted might be a better word is
[8:54] that brother random usually mentions
[8:55] this when he's telling the story about
[8:57] the third pole and about the vision
[8:58] coming to him and where he was at in his
[9:01] life and quitting wanting to come off
[9:03] the field and he owed a bunch of money
[9:04] in California and uh and he didn't want
[9:07] to be pulling for money and so it's
[9:09] within the context of God showing him
[9:12] how great his ministry was going to be
[9:14] in the Vindication of his ministry that
[9:16] he brings these things out about money
[9:17] women and popularity and how he studied
[9:19] the scripture and he's seen things and
[9:21] how these things will hurt or hinder or
[9:23] cause a minister to fall into a rod or
[9:25] wreck his life now in 1 Timothy 4:6 we
[9:28] see that it's ministers that brother bam
[9:30] typically addresses in this if thou put
[9:33] the brethren in remembrance of these
[9:34] things Thou shalt be a good minister of
[9:37] Jesus Christ nourished up in the words
[9:39] of faith and of good Doctrine whereinto
[9:42] thou Hast attained I like this because
[9:45] we could say that Timothy was filled
[9:46] with the Holy Ghost that he was
[9:48] following after the prophet's Ministry
[9:49] he was being taught and the prophet is
[9:51] teaching him that you're to be nourished
[9:53] up in the word of faith and the good
[9:55] Doctrine which you've already attained
[9:57] to so no matter how many years we spend
[9:58] in the message of the hour we ought to
[10:00] be
[10:00] growing I I'll let let the cat out of
[10:03] the bag my working title for a series of
[10:04] sermons that I'm thinking about
[10:06] ministering is message daycare just chew
[10:08] on that for a little bit but we should
[10:10] be nourished up in the words of faith
[10:12] and good doctrine that we've already
[10:14] attained to but nourished up in it and I
[10:17] would say that Paul no doubt admonishes
[10:19] Timothy along the same lines that
[10:21] brother brandham uh is teaching
[10:23] ministers are referencing a minister
[10:24] that watch these things we must watch
[10:26] these things hurt or hinder or cause you
[10:29] to to get back into a w or wreck of life
[10:31] I'm sure that Paul is admonishing
[10:33] Timothy in much the same
[10:35] way and this the money women and
[10:38] popularity brother Bram always ties this
[10:40] Trinity to a trap or weakness for
[10:44] ministers or preachers whenever whenever
[10:46] I've read it that's who he he zeros in
[10:48] on initially in the sermon the second
[10:51] Miracle he said there's three things
[10:52] that I've watched in my life in the
[10:54] reading of other ministers when God
[10:56] blesses a minister just a little bit he
[10:58] goes now we're all friends aren't we me
[11:01] must have just felt like I'm in a good
[11:02] place I can say this he says when he
[11:04] blesses him just a little bit above
[11:06] maybe someone else or give him an
[11:08] opportunity to do a little more work for
[11:10] him or something the first thing that
[11:12] Satan goes to working with that minister
[11:14] is three things he says major things the
[11:18] first thing is money women popularity I
[11:21] found in many places where he says the
[11:23] first thing is and he mentions these
[11:25] three things so the first thing is money
[11:27] women popularity he'll work on him with
[11:29] money or if he can get him to like his
[11:32] first bait that's like in the Garden of
[11:35] Eden so now he's making this
[11:37] connection between money women and
[11:40] popularity and how he tried to use the
[11:42] bait in the Garden of Eden says well or
[11:44] if he can get him to thinking he's
[11:45] something when he ain't nothing he's got
[11:48] him right then so there's this humility
[11:50] that we must carry ourselves with and we
[11:53] could say that this is directed at the
[11:54] ministers that are here tonight and
[11:56] there's just maybe a few of us here and
[11:57] so we don't mind being examined by the
[11:59] word of God if you're going to handle it
[12:01] you better be judged by it and I I was
[12:04] just thinking today that the easiest way
[12:06] to not be judged by something is just to
[12:08] reject it as
[12:10] true just to reject it as as being right
[12:13] that way you don't have to be judged by
[12:15] it but I believe these things are true
[12:17] and then in the sermon the angel of God
[12:19] he said if a minister three things if he
[12:21] goes to full and with he's ruined that
[12:24] is first thing was money then women and
[12:26] then popularity when he goes to thinking
[12:28] he's someone right there he's on his
[12:30] Road out that's right so there's these
[12:33] three things it's often mentioned in
[12:35] this way where it's putting a bull's eye
[12:37] on a
[12:38] minister a and if he goes fooling with
[12:40] this money women are popularity and he
[12:43] and he he surfaces Pride a little bit
[12:45] here if he gets to thinking he's
[12:46] something then he's on his Road out now
[12:51] I I believe that we would all agree and
[12:53] all of us is just Believers not
[12:55] ministers if we agree if you agree with
[12:57] this and believe this is true understand
[12:59] it go ahead and say Amen am all right so
[13:02] ministers must watch these things hurt
[13:05] ministers it hinders a minister it
[13:07] brings him back to a run it'll recom
[13:08] Minister his life these are things that
[13:10] he must watch that he must be on guard
[13:12] for if he goes to full in with it he's
[13:14] ruined so you don't want to fool with it
[13:16] you don't want to get mixed up in
[13:18] it now in 1 Timothy 4:12 Paul's telling
[13:22] Timothy says let no man despise thy
[13:24] youth but be thou an example of the
[13:27] Believers in Word in conversation in
[13:30] charity in spirit in faith in
[13:34] Purity
[13:36] now I maybe I can't remember just how
[13:40] much I have here but I believe that I
[13:42] could establish that money women in
[13:44] popularity and maybe we've already seen
[13:46] enough here to see that maybe you could
[13:48] just see how there's some connection to
[13:50] lust of the eyes lust of the Flesh and
[13:51] the pride of life and and that whe
[13:54] however you would want to arrange that
[13:55] and put it together there's got to be
[13:57] some there's some continuity to that so
[14:00] what I'm I'm wanting to begin to focus
[14:01] on is that this applies to all of us not
[14:05] just ministers so to the minister he
[14:07] says let no man despise thy youth he's a
[14:09] good minister of Jesus Christ as Paul
[14:11] said and if you can be nourished up in
[14:13] these words of faith and good Doctrine
[14:15] uh then you're going to be successful or
[14:17] you'll be able to help other people so
[14:19] he says let no man despise thy youth but
[14:22] be thou an example of the Believers in
[14:24] word in conversation in charity in
[14:26] spirit in faith in purity in other words
[14:29] as Paul is telling Timothy that he's a
[14:31] good minister of Jesus Christ and as a
[14:33] minister you must be an example of
[14:35] Believers to
[14:37] Believers that you're an example not
[14:39] only within but you're also an example
[14:41] without and so that your life matters
[14:44] and because you are a minister of the
[14:47] gospel and because you are to be an
[14:49] example of the Believers and to
[14:51] Believers Satan would love to shape your
[14:55] image he would love to design you in the
[14:58] same way that he's been successful in
[15:00] designing the woman if there is a
[15:02] Ministry to be had and a minister is
[15:04] handling the word of God and he's to be
[15:05] an example Satan would love to confuse
[15:08] the example shape the example do
[15:09] something to the
[15:11] example Timothy is told by Paul neglect
[15:14] not the gift that is in thee this gift
[15:17] that was in him was with the purpose in
[15:19] Christ useful to the body of Christ and
[15:22] therefore it was something that he had
[15:24] to honor something that he had to be
[15:26] conscious of something that was helpful
[15:29] to Elizabeth and I in our family is we
[15:31] realize that God calling us to minister
[15:33] the gospel myself being called to be a
[15:35] minister that as a family we had to
[15:37] honor that gift we had to in some ways
[15:39] serve that gift and recognize that it
[15:42] was something that was special to the
[15:44] people of God and not not mine in
[15:46] particular but just that gift and so
[15:48] there was a respect that you had for it
[15:50] and therefore it governed your
[15:52] conduct remember how that brother
[15:54] brandham tells the story many many times
[15:56] that as a young child this voice spoke
[15:58] from the bush and said from that tree
[16:00] don't ever smoke or drink or defile your
[16:03] body in any way there'll be a work for
[16:06] you to do when you get
[16:08] older and that smoke drink or defile
[16:10] your body you could see the lust of the
[16:12] eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of
[16:14] life brother R in other places brings it
[16:16] down to women and these other things you
[16:17] could see money women and popularity he
[16:20] tells them three things don't drink
[16:22] smoke or defile your body in any way
[16:24] because as a prophet who's going to have
[16:26] a message just think of how can
[16:28] confusing the gospel could have been yes
[16:31] sir if these things existed in his
[16:33] testimony if these things were there and
[16:35] he's going to be teaching marriage and
[16:37] divorce teaching on Satan's Eden sh
[16:40] preaching on these very relevant things
[16:42] in this day and age of sexual perversion
[16:43] in leod DEA and so God is telling them
[16:46] is you better keep yourself now because
[16:48] Satan would sure love to cause confusion
[16:50] on these
[16:51] things and I think it's a shame the more
[16:54] we get along with these
[16:56] modern uh interpret ations of the
[17:00] Bible and and Lifestyles and past that
[17:03] people have they're just trying to water
[17:05] down the truth of God's word instead
[17:07] will humble themselves to it sir so
[17:10] continuing to Timothy and looking at
[17:12] Timothy as an example Paul says to him
[17:14] in verse 7 but refuse profane and old
[17:18] wives
[17:19] fables now I think you could have a lot
[17:23] of fun with this and I begin to think
[17:25] that today I think you'll find these
[17:27] things social
[17:30] media and uh Twitter X as they call it
[17:34] now X formerly known as
[17:37] Twitter and they're just
[17:39] fables and there's just endless
[17:42] speculation and he's telling the man of
[17:45] God to refuse profane and old wives
[17:47] fables I I think it's it's very a very
[17:49] large heading that covers this these
[17:51] irrational fantasies and these endless
[17:54] questions and genealogies and debates
[17:57] and fables and all these different
[17:58] stories he said refuse them it it it it
[18:01] might be instructive today to say you
[18:03] know a man of God probably should be
[18:06] avoiding uh uh you know getting mixed up
[18:09] in social media and these different ways
[18:10] and these different channels not that he
[18:12] couldn't use them for good but don't be
[18:14] getting your information from there all
[18:16] right come on I'll just be honest I I
[18:18] don't know how many times I've been uh
[18:21] well I got to be careful how I say this
[18:23] but being in different chat groups and
[18:25] things and you'll find maybe a group of
[18:26] ministers are all part of a chat and
[18:28] somebody send something through on a
[18:30] Wednesday morning and all the ministers
[18:31] are like oh my goodness we never knew
[18:33] this and you've got to be the guy that
[18:35] says uh that's not
[18:36] real come
[18:38] on knowing that if you don't say
[18:40] anything people from their pulpits are
[18:43] going to be saying did you read the
[18:44] paper did you see this did you see that
[18:46] it's completely
[18:47] fabricated and I think that it kind of
[18:50] speaks to just how important it is that
[18:53] the one that is is ministering or the
[18:55] one that gets uh has FaceTime with the
[18:58] people and would go for song leaders and
[19:00] musicians and different people in
[19:01] positions that be careful what you're
[19:03] feeding on uh because he Paul has being
[19:07] teaching Timothy refus profane in old
[19:09] wise fables but he says exercise thyself
[19:11] rather un
[19:13] godliness there's something better to
[19:15] spend your time in right and then he
[19:18] says for bodily exercise profiteth
[19:20] little but godliness is profitable so
[19:23] what does that refer to well bodily
[19:25] exercise at least it profits some and
[19:27] maybe some of us need more more bodily
[19:29] exercise and maybe we want to get a
[19:30] little profit out of it but just being
[19:32] all excited and working yourself up and
[19:34] different things you can do with the
[19:35] body doesn't have as much profit as
[19:38] godliness is profitable that's right
[19:40] brother brandom often called out how
[19:43] emotional people could be and how
[19:45] Sensational things could be but the most
[19:46] important thing is how you lived your
[19:47] life right it's profitable unto all
[19:50] things having the promise of the life
[19:52] that now is so it'll profit you now and
[19:54] that which is to come he says this is a
[19:57] faithful Saint and worthy of all except
[19:58] ation not just for ministers but all and
[20:02] I believe that as ministers were placed
[20:04] to serve Timothy's being instructed as a
[20:08] servant therefore being servants your
[20:10] visible
[20:12] examples in 2 Corinthians Chapter 3
[20:14] Verse 6 he says who also hath made us
[20:18] able Ministers of the New Testament not
[20:21] of the letter but of the spirit for the
[20:23] letter kth but the spirit giveth life if
[20:26] we were to attribute this to Paul alone
[20:28] I don't I don't believe it would be
[20:29] wrong to say that Paul was speaking of
[20:31] himself and those that are stewards over
[20:33] the mysteries of God as Ministers of the
[20:35] Gospel but I could say that he's made us
[20:38] all able Ministers of the New Testament
[20:41] then he says the letter kth but the
[20:43] spirit giveth
[20:44] life this is why he's not just
[20:47] admonishing Timothy to be well learned
[20:49] and to know the doctrine which thou H
[20:50] has been taught and to rightly divide
[20:52] the word of Truth so that people can
[20:54] understand what I've taught and people
[20:55] know to say what's on the tapes and
[20:57] things like that but it's do do what you
[20:59] ought to do live your sermon uh uh shun
[21:02] these certain things and and act these
[21:04] certain ways because the letter the
[21:06] doctrine of it the letter of it will
[21:08] kill but it's the life the spirit that
[21:10] gives life to it right in the sermon
[21:13] there is a man here that can turn on the
[21:14] light he said life only comes by the
[21:16] word of God made manifest life comes
[21:19] only by the word of God made manifest he
[21:22] repeated himself he says as long as it's
[21:24] just in the book like this it still can
[21:27] be questioned right as long as it's
[21:30] letter as long as it is just Book and
[21:32] Tape for us today it can just be
[21:34] question still be questioned but when
[21:36] it's made manifest then you see the
[21:38] product of what it spoke of being
[21:39] manifested then that is light on the
[21:42] word so as long as it's just letter form
[21:45] it doesn't give life or it doesn't speak
[21:47] it doesn't testify but whenever it's
[21:49] life it's lived then it's proved it's
[21:53] Vindicated you have that that
[21:55] Vindication as long as it's just letter
[21:57] can be questioned letter kills but
[21:59] spirit gives life it's proven it's
[22:01] Vindicated and that's so as he says as
[22:03] able Ministers of the New Testament
[22:05] we've got to we we are to spir ad
[22:07] Minister the spirit of it and the life
[22:09] of it not just the letter of
[22:12] it in 1 Peter chapter
[22:14] 5 verses 1 2 3 and
[22:17] 4 the elders which are among you I
[22:20] exhort whom also an elder and a witness
[22:23] of the sufferings of Christ and also a
[22:25] partaker of the glory that shall be
[22:27] revealed now we recognize speaking to
[22:29] Elders in maybe this office of a bishop
[22:32] or Pastor feed the flock of God which is
[22:35] among you taking the oversight thereof
[22:38] not by constraint but willingly not for
[22:40] filthy lcer but of a ready mind neither
[22:43] is being Lords over God's Heritage but
[22:45] being examples to the flock I believe
[22:48] that you can see the threes in this
[22:49] again feed the flock take oversight and
[22:52] be an example in taking oversight it's
[22:55] willingly and of a ready mind and not is
[22:58] a lord over God's Heritage for filthy
[23:00] lucer and nor by constraint so feed the
[23:04] flock of God take oversight thereof a
[23:07] and and do it not by constraint but
[23:09] willingly not by for filthy lucer but of
[23:11] a ready mind he's he's dealing with
[23:12] money women and popularity lust of the
[23:14] eyes lust of the flesh the pride of life
[23:16] he says but being being examples to the
[23:20] flock so ministers must be examples amen
[23:25] and when the chief Shepherd shall appear
[23:26] you shall receive a Crown of Glory that
[23:28] fadeth not away we believe that Christ
[23:31] has provided for us the best example he
[23:34] has shown laid for us a path that we
[23:37] must also take even in his suffering and
[23:39] there's many different scriptures we
[23:41] could use in John 15 he says I or John
[23:43] 17 I've Sanctified myself for your sake
[23:46] he had a right to many different things
[23:48] he maybe was lawful for other things but
[23:50] yet he Sanctified himself as an example
[23:53] for other people's sake that's right
[23:56] Matthew 20: 25 5 to 28 Jesus calls them
[24:00] together he says you know that the
[24:01] prince of the Gentiles the princes of
[24:03] the Gentiles exercise dominion over them
[24:07] and they that are great exercise
[24:09] Authority upon them so they with a
[24:12] gentile you knew who was boss
[24:15] right you knew who the head guy was
[24:18] because there was just a way that he was
[24:19] going to carry himself and the way that
[24:21] everyone else was going to carry
[24:22] themselves around him to where he likes
[24:24] to exercise Authority he likes to be
[24:26] honored he likes to be recognized likes
[24:28] to be uh kind of separate and apart and
[24:31] so you'd kind of tell that uh that's the
[24:34] one uh that he would be the one
[24:37] demanding you are subject to me you're
[24:39] under my authority they exercise
[24:41] dominion and now Jesus turns this idea
[24:43] on its head and says but it shall not be
[24:45] so among you I believe he's speaking
[24:48] under the New Covenant shall not be so
[24:50] among you whosoever will be Chief among
[24:52] you let him be your servant
[24:55] amen the chief as it says when the chief
[24:57] Shepherd shall appear this is Christ he
[25:00] is the chief but now he's the shepherd
[25:02] who's become a servant Amen to the flock
[25:05] for somebody else's
[25:06] benefit and he's humbling himself to
[25:09] serve he's humbling himself to look out
[25:11] after something that needs to be taken
[25:13] care of so the one that is the greatest
[25:15] let him be your minister one that is
[25:17] Chief let him be your servant even as
[25:20] the son of man came not to be ministered
[25:22] unto but to minister and to give his
[25:24] life a ransom for many whoever is great
[25:27] among you let let him be your minister
[25:29] whoever is Chief among you let him be
[25:31] your servant whereas under the Gentiles
[25:33] the chief he served to the Gentiles the
[25:36] greatest he served and no doubt you
[25:38] could tell who's who but in the body of
[25:41] Christ let those who are chief let those
[25:43] who are great let them be
[25:45] servants be wonderful if people were in
[25:48] a in a certain setting and they they
[25:50] didn't know who was who because of the
[25:52] respect everybody had for one another
[25:54] the love they showed to one another
[25:57] yes we we are to follow his example as
[25:59] the son of man came not to be ministered
[26:01] unto but to minister see him kneeling to
[26:03] wash his disciples
[26:05] feet and as he came not to be ministered
[26:08] unto to be recognized uh to be benefited
[26:11] from to satisfy his desires or his needs
[26:14] but rather to serve the needs of others
[26:16] we also too must
[26:19] Minister that is what Peter's drawing
[26:21] from when he says that
[26:24] Elders are to feed the flock of God to
[26:27] take oversight thereof and be examples
[26:30] to the
[26:31] flock Jeremiah 3:15 and I will give you
[26:33] pastures according to my heart which
[26:35] shall feed you with knowledge and
[26:38] understanding it's that persuasiveness
[26:40] that persuasiveness of Love or
[26:42] persuasiveness by Love by way of a per a
[26:45] good example that shows the right way to
[26:48] live and shows the word
[26:51] plainly why are there requirements as we
[26:53] come to it uh for that a man must be the
[26:56] husband of one wife because that's what
[26:59] the Bible
[27:00] teaches that's what the the messenger of
[27:02] the hour comes and teaches you know H uh
[27:05] uh God's going to have a Grace on you we
[27:06] don't have time to fix these things up
[27:08] but don't you ever make a mistake like
[27:10] that again and teach your children not
[27:12] to do it and if you had all the pulpits
[27:14] that preach the word we're saying well I
[27:16] mean I know I've got a couple eyes but
[27:18] you can't people like whatever brother
[27:21] Aaron right it it completely undermines
[27:25] so it's not that ministers have an
[27:27] example that all of us don't have but if
[27:30] you're going to minister the word you
[27:32] have to be servant to the word and
[27:35] willing to subject yourself to it and by
[27:37] God's grace hopefully be a reflection of
[27:40] it
[27:42] sir now again I I say this quite often
[27:45] and I don't say it to be
[27:48] different but no earthly Pastor is your
[27:52] spiritual
[27:53] husband no earthly Pastor is your
[27:56] husband period unless you're married of
[27:58] the literal
[27:59] pastor but still he should live an
[28:03] example we cover this quite often too
[28:05] that headship should demonstrate how to
[28:09] lead a home how to guide children how to
[28:12] influence others our most effective
[28:15] witness in the home before our children
[28:19] is how we live our lives something
[28:21] that's becoming more and more apparent
[28:24] to me as a
[28:25] parent is that no matter how much I try
[28:28] try to teach and instruct my children
[28:30] about screens and screen time the most
[28:34] critical thing in their perception of
[28:36] screen time and their desire for it is
[28:38] how much time I spend on
[28:40] it and they have found time and time
[28:42] again that that at the end of the day
[28:44] that seems to be the biggest issue when
[28:47] it comes to screen time with children
[28:48] not how much you can limit it not what
[28:50] you keep them from but at the end of the
[28:52] day what the parents are doing with it
[28:53] as
[28:55] well and so as a pastor is set as an
[28:59] example and ministers are to live an
[29:01] example brother Bram says in the sermon
[29:03] God keeps his word you go into a church
[29:05] and you'll find usually the way the
[29:06] pastor acts that's the way the
[29:08] congregation will act he says I believe
[29:11] they get one another Spirit instead of
[29:13] the Holy Spirit sometime come on now I
[29:16] believe that we could read
[29:18] this and we could say well that's just
[29:20] the way that it is brother Braham said
[29:23] that's the way it is and that's the way
[29:24] it should be and I don't think that's
[29:26] what he's
[29:27] saying there's times you I remember one
[29:29] time I went to preach at a church and uh
[29:31] it been a while since I preached there
[29:33] and I showed up on a Wednesday night and
[29:34] I had a tie on a suit on dressed like
[29:36] this and the pastor was in a two button
[29:38] Under Armour shirt the Deacon was in a
[29:40] two button Under Armour shirt the
[29:41] trustees were every everybody it's like
[29:44] what is this twins Tabernacle what's
[29:45] going on here everybody was dressed the
[29:47] same I thought maybe they had to have a
[29:48] uniform now and it's because that's the
[29:51] way the pastor dressed that's how
[29:52] everybody ends up dressing when you take
[29:54] on the spirit of the pastor
[29:58] a and if and and if that's what's
[30:00] presented and that's what's expressed
[30:01] and that's what's broadcast and that's
[30:03] what has the preeminence really some
[30:04] people just can't help but do it because
[30:06] it's human nature you go to church
[30:08] you'll find they act the same way he
[30:09] says you take a real good woman and
[30:11] marry her to a no account man he'll
[30:13] either become a gentleman or she'll
[30:15] become no account
[30:17] influence so I guess it's not a a death
[30:20] sentence if a girl good man marries a
[30:22] woman who's or or a good woman marries a
[30:23] no account man just goes to show if
[30:26] she's not watching she's not careful
[30:29] right amen if she's not if she's not the
[30:32] example of the believer she's not
[30:34] honoring the word of God as it says how
[30:36] a wife should honor her husband if she's
[30:38] not doing the things that the Bible says
[30:40] a sister should do I say this even to
[30:42] the point when sisters said oh brother
[30:44] brandham my my husband doesn't believe
[30:46] what you preach and he wants me to go to
[30:48] church with them and brother brandham
[30:50] says brother Theo would say duh go to
[30:54] church with them you don't have to be
[30:56] worry about anything dear you don't have
[30:58] anything to worry about you know the
[30:59] truth why because she has got to be sure
[31:02] to remain a Christian otherwise she can
[31:04] become a no account but if she lives the
[31:06] word of God and she lives it right he
[31:08] can become a gentleman he says you just
[31:11] take one another's Spirit you do birds
[31:13] of a feather flock together and you're a
[31:16] spirit being brother B related it to the
[31:19] influence through the senses and this
[31:20] passage way passage here I believe he
[31:22] says the eye is the gate to the spirit
[31:23] he maybe he says soul and this one but
[31:25] we realize when he's breaking it down by
[31:27] Body Spirit Soul the eye is the gate to
[31:29] the spirit lust of the eyes the lust of
[31:31] the flesh that Pride the influence of an
[31:35] image that is set before you the
[31:36] influence of a person that you're near
[31:38] the influence of parents within a family
[31:40] the influence of what you read what you
[31:42] watch what you see the influence of an
[31:45] example so Paul teaches Timothy again my
[31:50] my premise tonight is I want you to
[31:52] consider whether money women and
[31:54] popularity are somehow related to The
[31:56] Big Three the L of the the flesh less of
[31:58] the eyes and the pride of life and that
[32:00] money women and popularity though in the
[32:02] message is often associated with things
[32:04] that a minister must watch in reality
[32:07] all of us can be hindered by
[32:10] them in the ways that they manifest and
[32:13] it's not just now I'm kind of getting
[32:15] into Sunday morning a little bit it's
[32:17] not that money is the problem because
[32:19] you have a lot of it and it's not just
[32:21] women have a problem because a minister
[32:23] lust after him or he has multiple wives
[32:25] or that popularity becoming pop is a
[32:27] problem there's ways that those things
[32:29] become problems that aren't in those
[32:31] literal ways that we think
[32:40] of in 1 Timothy Chapter 3: 2
[32:44] to7 now we can realiz this is just prior
[32:47] to the text that we read now he's
[32:49] teaching Timothy more a bishop then must
[32:51] be blameless the husband of one wife now
[32:55] take your uh own ability your own
[32:59] understanding of how God has dealt with
[33:00] your heart you're understanding the
[33:01] scripture and some of these words here
[33:03] and begin to think of how closely these
[33:05] would connect with the lust of the flesh
[33:07] lust of the eyes the pride of life and
[33:09] how that Paul is also dealing with women
[33:12] money popularity a bishop then must be
[33:15] blameless the husband of one wife
[33:17] leadership by example headship by
[33:20] example says Vigilant sober of good
[33:24] behavior given to hospitality AB to
[33:28] teach I believe it's this verse here
[33:30] that the Baptist and drafting some of
[33:32] their bylaws and things put that a
[33:33] deacon must be apt to teach but
[33:35] scripturally he's talking about this
[33:36] bishop this office of a pastor here
[33:38] Timothy's being told you ought to be apt
[33:40] to teach then it says not given to Wine
[33:43] no Striker not greedy a filthy looker
[33:46] but patient not a brawler not Covetous
[33:50] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride
[33:52] of life money women popularity I'm sure
[33:55] we could all work on this in our home
[33:57] school classes tomorrow morning and come
[33:59] out with a lot of good stuff here one
[34:01] that ruleth well his own house having
[34:03] his children in subjection with all
[34:06] gravity for if a man this is the
[34:08] principle look notice this for if a man
[34:10] know not how to rule his own house how
[34:12] shall he take care of the Church of
[34:15] God that that that becomes the man's
[34:17] life that he lives not just the position
[34:19] you grant him not the one that he's
[34:21] taken himself or assumed or was given
[34:24] some time ago or whatever but rather it
[34:26] is something that he he's got to to know
[34:28] how to live he's got to know how to act
[34:29] he has to know how to rule his own house
[34:31] because if you can't live a a private
[34:34] life and and a Sanctified life outside
[34:36] the pulpit you can't guide the Church of
[34:40] God not a novice L being lifted up with
[34:43] pride again I think you see how that
[34:45] connects back into the popularity and
[34:47] these different lust he shall he fall he
[34:49] fall into the condemnation of the devil
[34:52] moreover he must have a good report of
[34:53] them which are without a good report on
[34:56] those who aren't mess message
[34:58] Believers a good report with those who
[35:01] only know him in the
[35:03] neighborhood could you imagine if you
[35:05] went to visit a brother's house and
[35:07] you're invited over for dinner and uh
[35:09] and you knocked on the wrong door and
[35:11] you're sitting there holding your nice
[35:12] freshly baked fail cake a and and you're
[35:15] getting ready to hand it off to the
[35:16] pastor because he's you're thinking he's
[35:17] going to answer the door and they open
[35:18] it up and say oh I'm sorry I thought you
[35:21] were brother so and so or so and so and
[35:22] they Oh you mean that Rascal that liar
[35:25] that
[35:25] cheat that fornicator you be like no I
[35:28] mean the other one
[35:30] obviously like the one who pastors the
[35:32] church that's my pastor oh you're the
[35:34] bunch he pastors I think it would be
[35:39] mortifying and that's exactly what
[35:42] Timothy is pointing or Timothy's being
[35:44] told you got to have a good report even
[35:47] among those who aren't your those you
[35:50] associate lest he fall in reproach and
[35:52] the snare of the
[35:53] devil it's that influence by example and
[35:56] doors in door brother as you go into
[35:58] church and watch the pastor if he's real
[36:00] wild and Carries On the congregation
[36:02] will do the same they take the spirit of
[36:05] one another instead of the Holy Spirit
[36:07] that's the reason we got so much
[36:08] perverted teaching of the
[36:10] Bible why because people take on the
[36:13] pastor Spirit the minister spirit and
[36:16] not the spirit of Christ so whatever
[36:18] he's selling they're
[36:20] buying and they don't exercise the
[36:22] discernment and say whoa wait a minute
[36:25] stop I was with you until then yeah on I
[36:30] was with you until you started deviating
[36:33] from the spirit of the word of God you
[36:34] started deviating from the truth of the
[36:36] word of God you you took a little bit
[36:37] too far I'm sorry my Revelation can't
[36:39] take me there but if you take on the
[36:41] spirit of someone else you can become
[36:43] fanatical like somebody else oh man I
[36:45] never saw that before that's wild that's
[36:48] great that's deep and brother B talks
[36:49] about you could be starch and
[36:51] stiffy or maybe it was starchy and
[36:55] stiff but maybe it is worse to be
[36:59] stiffy but starchy and stiffer you could
[37:01] be wild and into fanaticism but you know
[37:05] what he told the Tabernacle they be
[37:06] thank should be thankful for a sane
[37:09] sensible Pastor that's right who
[37:11] preached the Full
[37:13] Gospel full of power but preach the full
[37:16] word sane and
[37:18] sensible brother M says you go into a
[37:20] church where the pastor's kind of a
[37:21] flighty wild fired up in a
[37:24] moabit please brother brand expound upon
[37:26] that flighty Wildfire up moabit watch
[37:31] the congregation be the same thing not
[37:34] because we ought
[37:36] to right I don't want you all going to
[37:38] get JDs and practice insecurities law
[37:41] there not enough work to go around right
[37:45] you you just take on the spirit of your
[37:46] pastor no matter how nice and kind he is
[37:49] let's not all get brother bram's Spirit
[37:52] let's not try to act like the prophet be
[37:54] like the prophet that you don't just
[37:56] want to get somebody else's Spirit you
[37:59] want the word that's what you want to
[38:02] have but there's this human tendency to
[38:04] become what you behold to become what
[38:06] you value to become what you hear and if
[38:08] the pastor's flighty which means easily
[38:11] excitable maybe impressionable maybe
[38:13] unstable frequently changes their mind
[38:17] irresponsible silly just immature has
[38:20] never grown
[38:21] up he said the congregation will be
[38:23] flighty that's right that's right
[38:25] pastors fired up people will be fired up
[38:31] God help us to be
[38:33] ourselves whether we're in the Pulpit or
[38:35] behind the piano or in the seat God help
[38:38] us to be ourselves and be true to what
[38:40] God wants us to do worship Him in spirit
[38:43] and truth and the manner which pleases
[38:44] God relieves our heart and fulfills the
[38:46] burden we have in our lives and let
[38:48] nobody who's stiffy keep you from crying
[38:52] if that's what you want to do and let
[38:54] nobody who's wild and excitable make you
[38:56] feel ashamed because you just bow your
[38:58] head pour your out be heart out before
[39:01] God in
[39:04] silence I'm hitting on this I guess in
[39:07] the sense that brother Bam's identifying
[39:10] that ministers become examples they set
[39:12] the
[39:14] tone and as I've been making this point
[39:16] throughout these traps these attacks
[39:18] these hindrances however you want to
[39:20] look at it the money women popularity
[39:23] different ways that Paul is admonishing
[39:25] Timothy ways that Peter spoke to Elders
[39:28] the way that Christ afforded us an
[39:29] example the things that brother brandham
[39:31] is saying these
[39:32] things that are attacks and traps and
[39:35] hindrances for ministers are the same
[39:36] for all of
[39:38] us 1 Timothy chapter
[39:42] 10 verses 11 to 14 I'll skip just a
[39:45] little bit because I want to hold some
[39:46] for later he says now all these things
[39:47] happen unto them for
[39:49] examples even talking about that in the
[39:51] Exodus and the children of Israel and
[39:52] they are written for our admonition upon
[39:54] whom the ends of the world are come how
[39:57] much more applicable is that for us
[39:58] today whether it be the Old Testament
[40:01] New Testament of the church ages it's
[40:03] for our admonition upon whom the ends of
[40:05] the world are come wherefore let him
[40:07] that thinketh he standeth take heed lest
[40:09] he fall there's your pride right there
[40:12] hath no temptation taken you but such as
[40:15] common to man let me say that whatever
[40:18] it is money women popularity lust of the
[40:20] flesh lust of the lust of the eyes or
[40:22] the pride of life it's all common to man
[40:25] all mankind humankind brothers or
[40:27] sisters young or old are tempted in some
[40:30] way through these channels we might
[40:33] think oh well only only young men are
[40:34] going to battle with lust and
[40:36] pornography only ministers are going to
[40:37] have to wrestle with popularity do you
[40:39] realize sometimes it's not even the the
[40:41] the preachers that are wrestling with
[40:43] popularity at all they already think
[40:44] they're popular so they're not worried
[40:45] about it but it's people that sit in
[40:47] pews and sit at home and their
[40:49] Housewives who are hungry for acceptance
[40:51] hungry for popularity and they try to
[40:53] find it through some other
[40:54] channel why because they're fighting
[40:56] with
[40:57] popularity women who have a problem with
[41:00] women women who have a problem with
[41:02] money
[41:04] yes and men too not just
[41:07] preachers right good and this is to me
[41:12] it's it's kind of catching that Paul
[41:13] says in verse 14 wherefore my dear dear
[41:16] beloved dearly beloved flee from
[41:20] idolatry flee from it free from the
[41:23] emulation free from patting yourself
[41:25] after somebody else and not after Christ
[41:27] don't let anyone spoil you through
[41:29] vanity and pretense and pride make sure
[41:32] that your Christ is at the heart of it
[41:34] and the center of
[41:38] it in the sermon here his voice in 1958
[41:42] brother B was talking about a radio
[41:44] program that he had heard on his way to
[41:46] church and he said that in this radio
[41:48] program which was a Church's Ministry
[41:51] they were teaching how that you ought to
[41:53] teach or they're teaching their
[41:55] congregation and showing how you ought
[41:56] to teach teach uh young people or though
[41:59] your congregants how to drink
[42:01] moderately so instead of saying don't
[42:03] drink they saying well you know just
[42:04] kind of be moderate with these
[42:07] things and and brother brandham is kind
[42:10] of making the point like what are you
[42:12] thinking and so I want you to catch what
[42:14] he's trying to say it just to me it it
[42:18] is it's it's it stops me in the day and
[42:21] age that I'm living in as a as a father
[42:24] it stops me and it causes me to think
[42:27] God help
[42:29] me that I don't
[42:32] allow my my children to become
[42:36] intoxicated I I may not have a box of
[42:38] wine in the
[42:39] refrigerator and I may not have uh
[42:42] liquor in a cabinet somewhere vodka in
[42:44] the freezer and different things that I
[42:46] got to worry about them getting into and
[42:48] I'm like oh hey hey Elliot just just a
[42:49] shot okay you know tap the brakes there
[42:51] buddy you still got school this morning
[42:53] I I I it may not be those things but
[42:55] what other things could they be drunk on
[42:57] that's
[42:58] right and he says and that will wreck
[43:01] and ruin and damn any
[43:04] home I I was studying on this and I was
[43:07] working with the title of
[43:09] dam because brother B Tomo what dams
[43:11] your home and dams this and dams that
[43:13] and so it's not it's not a curse word
[43:15] it's a
[43:16] reality it'll wreck ruin and damn any
[43:19] home how could the voice of God speak
[43:21] among a family that's half Sauced up
[43:25] with whiskey and their minds paralyzed
[43:26] with smoking and drinking and all night
[43:30] carousing oh my how could the voice of
[43:33] God speak among a
[43:36] family in that condition and then he
[43:39] begins to talk about something he says
[43:40] men that wait upon God come into His
[43:43] presence
[43:46] wow men that wait upon God come into His
[43:49] presence they told a story how that
[43:51] sister ma saw an Amish woman and sister
[43:53] ma describes her countenance and
[43:55] different things and she makes the
[43:56] comment she was sweet her soul was
[43:59] mellow her eyes were
[44:01] clear brother B said she had been in the
[44:03] presence of God said her senses weren't
[44:06] DED by whiskey and tobacco and all kinds
[44:10] of things of the
[44:11] world now we know that being Amish
[44:14] though we might all have some really
[44:15] good handmade Furniture some good cheese
[44:18] nice summer
[44:20] sausage even though there might be some
[44:22] pluses to living an Amish
[44:24] lifestyle we're we're not going to find
[44:26] this
[44:27] clear-headedness in a mellow Soul just
[44:29] by abstaining but notice he says a a a
[44:32] sense is dulled by intoxications and
[44:34] influences and all kinds of things of
[44:36] the world she was refreshed from the
[44:39] presence of God reading her Bible
[44:41] studying God's
[44:43] word but we modern Americans what we
[44:47] do remember how brother Brandon made the
[44:49] statement and we touched on it here
[44:51] recently how in America you can get away
[44:53] with
[44:54] anything talking about the fanaticism in
[44:56] church and all the much to do about
[44:58] nothing he says and what are we doing he
[45:00] says and the false prophets behind the
[45:02] pulpit say that's all right and that's
[45:05] exactly what you have is when somebody
[45:07] says something's going to happen and it
[45:08] doesn't happen that's a false prophet
[45:10] when they speak in the name of the Lord
[45:11] over you and it doesn't happen that's a
[45:13] false prophet or they've prophesied
[45:15] falsely and if they're a real Prophet
[45:16] they would apologize and repent and get
[45:18] that Spirit cast off of them a real
[45:20] Christian would but false prophets
[45:22] behind the pulpit saying it's
[45:25] right contrary to to the word of God he
[45:28] said I'm kind of in the notion of saying
[45:29] this if I'm wrong God forgive me and I'm
[45:31] persuaded that a lot of them don't know
[45:34] God he says and the congregation will
[45:36] never live any higher than its Pastor
[45:39] you anyone familiar with those
[45:40] statements they're hotly debated Topic
[45:42] in certain circles he says you'll never
[45:44] live any higher than your pastor
[45:46] teaches and you might say I I I just
[45:49] have a hard time accepting that if
[45:51] someone choose chooses
[45:54] to they're only going to live up to a
[45:57] certain level so if you never live any
[45:59] higher than your pastor teaches you
[46:02] better hope he's teaching all of
[46:04] it if you never live any higher than
[46:06] your pastor you want one that's
[46:08] continuing to strive and to reach
[46:12] right God judged my heart I'm not saying
[46:15] this in a in a manner to try to prop
[46:17] myself up if anything just putting it on
[46:19] the record so you guys can hold me
[46:21] accountable he said no wonder the
[46:23] scripture says these Shepherds how
[46:24] they've scattered the flock woe unto
[46:25] them they are the branches that bear not
[46:27] fruit and will be plucked off and
[46:29] burned again it shows how serious it is
[46:32] to be a minister how serious it
[46:36] is to be a man of God to be a
[46:39] pastor and how even within a church when
[46:41] there's different offices and positions
[46:43] that there's a certain testimony in a
[46:45] life that would be required with it
[46:46] because other people are
[46:50] watching in Romans 14: 12 and 13 it so
[46:54] says so then every one of us shall give
[46:56] account of himself to God we will all be
[47:00] held accountable to God not not just
[47:03] ministers not just pastors and even the
[47:05] prophet himself said he would have to
[47:07] answer for thousands of souls on that
[47:09] day we must give an account of ourselves
[47:11] to God let us not therefore judge one
[47:13] another
[47:15] anymore right but judge this rather
[47:19] think of how quickly we judge somebody
[47:22] else and just imagine this that he says
[47:25] let's not judge anybody anymore and
[47:27] we're all thinking okay I'm I'm real
[47:29] judgy he says but judge this that no man
[47:32] put a stumbling block or an occasion to
[47:34] fall in his brother's
[47:37] way could we be judging people that fell
[47:41] and they tripped over our block
[47:43] on on could we be judging other people's
[47:46] flightiness could we be judging other
[47:48] people's unbelief other people's
[47:50] problems and we're the one that caused
[47:52] the occasion for them to fall because he
[47:54] says let us all give account of
[47:56] ourselves and let's not just judge
[47:58] everybody anymore but judge this am I
[48:01] being the right kind of
[48:04] example that even when I mistake make a
[48:07] mistake or fall I can repent I can get
[48:10] back up I can humble myself and make it
[48:12] right Paul told Timothy let no man
[48:16] despise thy youth brother brandom says
[48:18] in the token sermon age means not a
[48:21] thing let no man despise your youth but
[48:24] be an example he says age means not a
[48:26] thing you've done past from age you're
[48:28] in eternity cuz you are in him he is
[48:32] eternal Don't Mean a Thing whether
[48:33] you're young old middle AG or whatever
[48:35] you are pretty ugly short
[48:39] fat just find yourself in the word
[48:43] tonight it don't matter a thing I can
[48:46] find that I'm pretty ugly pretty short
[48:48] pretty
[48:50] fat it doesn't matter a thing you don't
[48:54] go around in all these other things
[48:56] you've done p from that you're dead now
[48:59] remember this central theme to House of
[49:00] God your life is hid in God through
[49:02] Christ you're sealed in there by the
[49:04] holy ghost walking in Christ the only
[49:07] object you see is Christ no more
[49:10] idolatry from then on comes the word and
[49:12] the word only not patting ourselves
[49:14] after church ages not patting ourselves
[49:16] after denominations not even patting
[49:18] ourselves after church age Messengers
[49:20] you've been introduced to your
[49:21] bridegroom we follow one head that's
[49:23] Christ it's the only object you see
[49:26] that's all that's only you walk but oh
[49:29] my no wonder we used to sing that little
[49:31] song fill my way every day with love as
[49:33] I walk with the Heavenly Dove he says
[49:35] let me go all the while with a song and
[49:37] a smile and listen to what he says let
[49:40] me live the example of what Christ said
[49:44] a man should
[49:46] be let me be a brother to a brother a
[49:49] brother to a sister let me be a minister
[49:52] to the ministers let me be an example of
[49:55] examples Amen Let me show to the world
[49:58] that this word is Christ yes sir you
[50:02] want marching orders you want to know
[50:03] what you should be doing every day live
[50:05] an example of what Christ said a
[50:07] Believer ought to be if you're a man be
[50:10] a man what that Christ said you should
[50:12] be if you're a daughter of God be a
[50:13] daughter of God that Christ said you
[50:14] should be let me be a brother to a
[50:16] brother a brother to a sister let me be
[50:18] a minister to ministers let me be an
[50:20] example of
[50:21] examples the only way I can do it is to
[50:24] come into him because I can't do it
[50:26] myself
[50:27] you can't do it take heed him who thinks
[50:30] he stand lest he fall but let the word
[50:32] and you become one then it lives itself
[50:36] out your walk a walking Epistle of Jesus
[50:39] Christ when he's got complete control
[50:41] control of you to make every
[50:47] word Brothers if you could come to your
[50:51] instruments we'll just close here in
[50:53] just a moment let's read again 1
[50:55] Corinthians chap 10: 11 to
[50:58] 14 all these things happened in the Old
[51:00] Testament to the children of Israel as
[51:02] examples written of and recorded for our
[51:05] instruction and our admonition wherefore
[51:07] let him that thinketh he standeth take
[51:09] heed lest he
[51:10] fall there hath no temptation taken you
[51:13] but such as common to man less of the
[51:16] eyes less of the flesh the pride of life
[51:20] young old brother bam said middle-aged
[51:22] pretty ugly short fat everyone battles
[51:25] with the pride of life
[51:27] you might think sometimes man they're
[51:28] just so short fat and ugly how could
[51:30] they have any pride in their in in life
[51:32] and any Pride we all battle it we all go
[51:35] through it we all money women populari
[51:38] somehow some way in some form every
[51:40] human being is going to be tempted with
[51:42] these things going to be hindered by
[51:44] them in their wrong application the
[51:45] perversion of these things can become a
[51:47] Vias can become an addiction become a
[51:49] real struggle for
[51:51] anybody that's why when John is writing
[51:53] he says I ride under you little children
[51:56] because you're sins are forgiven and
[51:58] that's where the little children are
[51:59] most grounded need to be rooted in that
[52:00] they they've been forgiven that the
[52:02] blood of Jesus Christ is is an atonement
[52:04] for them and then young men because
[52:05] you've overcome the wicked one and the
[52:07] Holy Ghost is living inside you the word
[52:08] of God inv by you and then you fathers
[52:10] why because you've continued from the
[52:12] beginning why because these things hit
[52:15] you at every stage of
[52:16] life there's little children becoming
[52:19] subject to tormenting
[52:20] Spirits there there there there's
[52:22] wrestling with lust and all sorts of
[52:24] evil things that will grip people long
[52:27] before they're
[52:28] teenagers why because there's no
[52:30] temptation that takes a man but such as
[52:33] common to man but God is
[52:37] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[52:39] tempted above that you are
[52:41] able but will with the Temptation also
[52:44] make a way to escape that you may be
[52:47] able to Bear
[52:48] it the woman in the beginning was given
[52:52] sufficient
[52:53] resources to escape
[52:57] the Temptation God had already said
[52:59] beforehand this is what will happen and
[53:01] this is what you're to do the Commission
[53:04] in the prohibition she could have stayed
[53:06] with it but she didn't Christ in the
[53:08] wilderness is tempted in the same way
[53:09] and what does he say it is written it is
[53:11] written it is
[53:14] written and he has made for us in light
[53:17] of money women and popularity the lust
[53:19] of the flesh the lust of the eyes and
[53:21] the pride of life as I said on Sunday I
[53:23] believe that God wants by the word of
[53:25] God to deliver some of us from things
[53:28] that have either been in family history
[53:30] whether it be sick sickness whether it
[53:31] be family history and and emotional
[53:33] mental mental illness or whether it be
[53:35] things of vices and addictions chemical
[53:37] or lust or otherwise I believe that God
[53:41] wants us to know that the power of the
[53:43] word is greater than money women and
[53:45] popularity and that Satan can be exposed
[53:47] by the word of God to bring great
[53:49] Deliverance to his
[53:51] people and there's ways that certain
[53:53] thing certain of these things have been
[53:54] weaponized
[53:56] to where certain offenses are very that
[53:59] that one would fall in an offense and
[54:02] this one has sinned and they've made a
[54:03] tremendous mistake they've fallen in
[54:05] money but then the devil tries to turn
[54:07] around and weaponize it toward somebody
[54:08] else is now the victim and it spirals
[54:11] out of control and no one ever gets out
[54:12] of it CU he's weaponized the whole
[54:17] thing through support groups and
[54:20] opinions online and other people have
[54:23] experienced the same thing it places
[54:25] stigma on the offender it it changes the
[54:28] word of God and it makes things just
[54:30] this Labyrinth that one could never
[54:32] escape from but God will with the
[54:36] Temptation there's no temptation that
[54:38] has taken a
[54:41] man but such as every man has faced it
[54:45] but God is faithful that he will not
[54:46] suffer you to be tempted above that you
[54:48] are able that means with every
[54:50] Temptation he will with the Temptation
[54:52] with every Temptation there is a way to
[54:55] escape amen yeah talked about the big
[54:57] three and we question it is it really
[54:59] the big three when there's the greatest
[55:01] one who is the way the truth the life
[55:04] amen who has overcome these things will
[55:07] make a way of Escape that you may be
[55:09] able to Bear it wherefore my beloved
[55:10] Brethren flee from idolatry flee from it
[55:13] why by his help under the shadow of his
[55:16] wings for as Hebrews says for we have
[55:18] not a high priest which cannot be
[55:20] touched with the feeling of our
[55:22] infirmities but was in all points
[55:24] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[55:27] he was tempted with the lust of the
[55:29] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[55:30] of life he was tempted with money women
[55:32] and
[55:33] popularity constantly tempted with these
[55:38] things don't you see how often they
[55:40] money became an
[55:42] issue how often he was asked these
[55:44] different
[55:45] questions how he was trying to cast with
[55:48] this lot and cast with that lot crowds
[55:51] hovering around him the crowd gets
[55:53] thinner he was tempted with money he was
[55:55] tempted Ed with women he was tempted
[55:57] with
[56:00] popularity but was without
[56:03] [Music]
[56:04] sin in all points tempted like as we are
[56:09] no temptation but such his common Dem
[56:11] man John says for whatsoever is born of
[56:14] God overcometh the
[56:16] world if you overcome the world you can
[56:18] overcome all that is in the world the
[56:20] big three lust of the flesh lust of the
[56:22] eyes the pride of life money women
[56:24] popularity you name it I don't believe
[56:26] there's anything that we should just say
[56:28] this is just the way it is and the way
[56:29] it's going to be that's right the same
[56:31] God that's that we believe for physical
[56:33] healing is the same one for Spiritual
[56:35] healing and the Very one that has power
[56:37] to change this body in a moment in
[56:39] twinkling eye can change anything in
[56:40] your life anything in your life in a
[56:43] moment and twinkling of an
[56:45] eye whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[56:48] the world and this is the victory that
[56:50] overcometh the world even our faith who
[56:52] is he that overcometh the world but he
[56:54] that believeth that Jesus is the Son of
[56:57] God he that believeth he has come in the
[56:59] flesh he that believeth Jesus Christ the
[57:01] son of God who came into the world and
[57:03] and he has overcome he was tempted in
[57:07] the same way that I might be tempted and
[57:09] he's one that I can go to who can be
[57:11] touched by the filling of our
[57:13] infirmities there's a lot of people that
[57:15] can't understand
[57:16] temptation of certain things so well
[57:19] I've never been tempted to jump out of
[57:20] an airplane with a
[57:21] parachute and and I've never been
[57:23] tempted to do this and I've never been
[57:25] tempted to do that and there's a lot of
[57:26] people that can't relate to certain
[57:27] Temptations there's some things that a
[57:29] woman struggles with and wrestles with
[57:31] and can't quite get over with complexes
[57:33] and fears and men look at them like come
[57:35] on what's the problem suck it up and
[57:38] then the vice versa there's things that
[57:39] women can't understand that a man goes
[57:43] through great test and temptations and
[57:46] battles and
[57:47] failures but I don't want anyone rather
[57:50] what side you are on this to think
[57:52] that's just the way that it has to be
[57:54] but God Amen is merciful God is
[57:59] faithful and we can by the grace of God
[58:03] overcome we can just as Paul admonished
[58:05] Timothy to be nourished up in the words
[58:07] of faith and of good Doctrine we too can
[58:09] do the same we don't have to be
[58:12] flighty we can be mature we can grow we
[58:15] can
[58:17] overcome so I hope we put some things
[58:19] out there for you to consider
[58:21] tonight Lord will maybe Sunday morning
[58:23] we'll touch on money women and
[58:24] popularity just to see just to get real
[58:27] with some of these things the lust of
[58:29] the flesh the lust of the eyes and the
[58:31] pride of life don't stay
[58:33] home come we want to say goodbye to the
[58:35] Cleveland Sunday morning so we need
[58:37] everyone we need everyone here God bless
[58:39] you let's stand
