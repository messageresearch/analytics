[0:00] so um last or on Sunday we were speaking
[0:03] on um uh power or authority without
[0:08] character it's satanic and it's a quote
[0:11] that brother brandham uh it's a really
[0:13] good quote it's one of those things that
[0:15] I've learned that I need to use in my
[0:17] daily life it's not something so far
[0:20] away something so deep that I can't just
[0:22] put it in my back pocket but I can apply
[0:24] it in my daily life every single day
[0:27] that that um God has has placed the
[0:31] bride a Christian a child of God with an
[0:36] authority with a
[0:38] position and Jesus said even before the
[0:41] disciples were even born again he said
[0:43] you are the light of the world so that's
[0:46] a great position this you're not just
[0:49] the light of your own family you're not
[0:50] the light of a little tiny group you are
[0:53] the light of the world so that is
[0:56] something that God has placed in us and
[0:58] and we see that that um The Authority
[1:02] without the character backing it up it
[1:04] becomes
[1:05] satanic and we see that with Satan how
[1:09] how he saw the image of God he saw the
[1:13] likeness or to be like God it was it was
[1:16] a skewed way of looking at it he said I
[1:19] want to be like God and he wanted
[1:21] everything he wanted the authority he
[1:23] wanted the position he wanted the
[1:25] greatness and the glory without having
[1:28] the character of God with within himself
[1:31] and I begin to think about um of what is
[1:35] the goal of of a Christian development
[1:38] the growth of a Christian because that's
[1:41] what we're uh aspiring to be is to be
[1:45] like God to be more like
[1:48] him and and um and we we grow every
[1:52] single day and why is there that
[1:54] necessity of development or or where
[1:56] does it lead us to and and we see that
[2:00] if we're not careful what we do with
[2:02] this development process that brother
[2:04] brandham has laid out for us and the
[2:06] word has laid out for us what we do is
[2:09] that that becomes degrees or or steps to
[2:13] our Salvation right so so different
[2:17] degrees of if you don't do this or if
[2:19] you do this and you do this then you can
[2:21] attain your
[2:22] salvation but but the word clearly tells
[2:26] us when you are saved you are saved when
[2:29] you received the Holy Spirit you are in
[2:33] the body already you have already been
[2:36] glorified when you have been
[2:38] Justified so so there there you have
[2:41] been saved but but a lot of times what
[2:44] we try to do you know in our human mind
[2:46] we've seen it many times is we'll take
[2:49] those development stages and say well
[2:51] hey if you don't have this you're not
[2:53] saved or if you're not here you haven't
[2:57] ascended to a higher degree of salvation
[3:01] but but it when you are saved then there
[3:04] is a development
[3:06] process that's what it is it's it's when
[3:09] we're saved now God can mold us into
[3:13] that perfect image of God and and we see
[3:16] that in Genesis 1 126 where where this
[3:20] is the the ultimate here this is what
[3:24] we're trying to be what we're trying to
[3:27] every single day live up to
[3:30] it says and God said let us make man in
[3:33] our image after our likeness and he also
[3:38] says which this is very important he
[3:40] says and let them have dominion over the
[3:42] fish um over the fish of the sea over
[3:44] the fowl of the air over the cattle and
[3:47] over all the Earth and over every
[3:49] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[3:51] Earth so God's last and his greatest
[3:55] creation was man and women in His image
[4:00] that that was the the ultimate he had
[4:04] 6,000 years or 6 days however you want
[4:06] to see it that way but in the end his
[4:10] ultimate was I need a creature that can
[4:13] behold my very image my very likeness
[4:18] and whenever he reached that ultimate
[4:21] see that is our goal Brothers our goal
[4:24] is to be like him to be like God to have
[4:29] his image to be in his likeness and
[4:32] whenever that had been achieved in in
[4:35] the Garden of Eden the Bible says that
[4:38] he
[4:38] rested that means that it's
[4:41] done he has reached what what he wanted
[4:45] from the creature and there is no
[4:48] creation no thing that has been created
[4:52] that has been made into the image of God
[4:55] no Beast no animal we don't see anything
[4:58] that was made to Bear God's image the
[5:02] image of God it's it's not
[5:04] physical if I could say it this way it's
[5:07] not this might sound wrong but it's not
[5:10] Supernatural or it's not
[5:13] Angelic it it's
[5:15] invisible you there there is no
[5:17] substance to it so so how is Man created
[5:21] in the image of God when it's it's
[5:24] beyond our sense of of of visibility and
[5:29] matter and touch and
[5:32] tangibility how is it he created
[5:35] something that that we cannot
[5:39] see it's beyond
[5:42] that what what makes or what a person
[5:46] does I is is they they try to make a
[5:50] mental picture of this uh image of God
[5:55] and it's hard you can't mentally picture
[5:57] it and and and what what we see a lot of
[6:00] times is is we see oh well we are the
[6:03] image of God and what happens is we
[6:05] almost reverse it and we say God is in
[6:09] the image of man now right and say oh we
[6:12] are the image of God and and we look at
[6:15] the suits and we look at how our
[6:16] churches are and we look at
[6:18] denominations and we look at at certain
[6:21] doctrines and we see now this is the
[6:24] image of God and what we're doing is
[6:26] we're making the image of man God
[6:31] so we're reversing it when the image of
[6:34] God wasn't
[6:36] this because in the second chapter it
[6:39] shows that he formed Man Out of the Dust
[6:41] of the
[6:42] earth that that when man was formed in
[6:45] the dust of the earth he was in the
[6:47] image of
[6:48] beasts he was in the image of the earth
[6:52] earthy so whatever this image was we
[6:56] can't we can't duplicate it amen I
[6:59] believe that's what Satan tried to do I
[7:02] honestly believe that's what Satan tried
[7:04] to do and in Romans
[7:06] 1:23 it's showing how men corrupted that
[7:10] image it says and changed the glory of
[7:14] The Incorruptible God into image made
[7:18] like unto corrup corruptible man and
[7:21] birds and four-footed Beast and creeping
[7:24] things what was it they were making
[7:27] Idols they created their own own form of
[7:30] God and say this is our God whether it
[7:34] was a a thought a religion a Doctrine or
[7:38] a
[7:39] person we could make people into the
[7:42] image of
[7:44] God and it's not it's not saying well
[7:47] this person is has the image or is the
[7:50] image of God but we begin to put that
[7:53] God is in that image of that man
[7:57] power what is this image of God um in in
[8:03] the Hebrew it's imod
[8:05] day man has been created with the
[8:09] capacity to reflect and to mirror the
[8:13] character of God that is his
[8:16] image no other creature can do that let
[8:20] us create man in our image what was it
[8:24] I'm going to have him bear my nature
[8:26] amen bear my character
[8:30] something that nothing else could
[8:34] do and in Hebrews
[8:37] 13 um the the scripture that we we read
[8:41] it says that Jesus he was the brightness
[8:44] of his
[8:45] glory the expressed image of his person
[8:50] now the word the Greek word here only
[8:53] shows up once in this in the Bible here
[8:55] the expressed image and that is the word
[8:58] character
[9:01] that is the Greek word character and it
[9:03] means a Graver or a tool or even a
[9:06] person an engraving something that is
[9:10] stamped or a stamping
[9:14] process um they they it says that when
[9:17] uh Greek Artisans they carved classical
[9:19] figures out of block blocks of marble
[9:22] they used a series of sculpting tools
[9:24] one of these was known as a
[9:27] character this tool was was used to
[9:29] Chisel into the marble and stamp the
[9:32] sculptor's name or distinctive Mark into
[9:35] the finished
[9:37] product so that is where character comes
[9:40] from and it says that gradually however
[9:42] the word broadened in its meaning and
[9:44] itcl it not only included the tool used
[9:48] but the tooling process from beginning
[9:51] to end so it it that the character is
[9:55] what molds the
[9:57] image the word came to represent a
[10:01] formation process by which the marble
[10:03] was shaped by the Creator and ultimately
[10:06] marked and stamped by his hands as the
[10:10] word evolved Through the Ages the word
[10:12] character began to refer as an a
[10:15] distinctive Mark token or feature then
[10:19] in early 16th century the word came to
[10:22] describe a person's distinguishing
[10:24] qualities and and now we know like what
[10:27] character and what how people use the
[10:29] word
[10:30] character but but it was it was a a a
[10:35] marble
[10:37] chiseled to create an
[10:40] image brother brandham he says in the
[10:43] the message the Masterpiece he says and
[10:46] then in the beginning was the word and
[10:48] the Word was with God and the Word was
[10:51] hewed out and reflected what the word
[10:54] was in the
[10:55] beginning him the word reflected in the
[10:58] mass Masterpiece in his own
[11:01] likeness God back um back again in his
[11:05] own likeness the word form being
[11:08] reflected in the image of a man the
[11:11] Masterpiece so when God created Adam and
[11:15] Eve or when God created man in his
[11:17] likeness he created His Image which was
[11:21] his
[11:22] character that's what it was and brother
[11:24] brandham when he starts that message
[11:26] Masterpiece he talks about the image of
[11:29] God that's the first thing he begins to
[11:31] talk about after he reads these
[11:33] scriptures he says how he began to
[11:36] create his Masterpiece in the image of
[11:39] God in his own
[11:42] image that is the image of God now on
[11:45] the other
[11:47] hand where the scripture says that that
[11:49] Satan he was made
[11:53] perfect now there is no other scripture
[11:56] that shows a creature that was made
[11:59] perfect you can't see it of course you
[12:03] you we can look into it Jesus was
[12:06] perfect but he was not a created
[12:08] being but here the Bible says that you
[12:11] were created
[12:14] perfect but in his perer Perfection or
[12:17] his beauty that was that it was an
[12:20] outward
[12:21] appearance and that outward Perfection
[12:24] or that outward Beauty it caused him to
[12:27] want to be like God
[12:30] it wanted him to to uh uphold an
[12:33] authority uphold something but his
[12:36] Beauty his Perfection was wanted him to
[12:40] be like God but when man and women they
[12:43] are created in the image of God the
[12:45] Bible says we weren't created perfect
[12:48] but the Bible says we were created like
[12:51] him and and this this image it's not a
[12:56] Perfection of outward Beauty like
[12:58] Lucifer but when he created us it was
[13:01] something
[13:03] inwardly that our flesh it could never
[13:05] attain our flesh it can never aspire to
[13:08] those things it has to be a supernatural
[13:12] work of God this
[13:14] character we we we want to be like God
[13:18] and we want to have his character but we
[13:21] need a supernatural
[13:25] experience him he was always partly and
[13:31] almost but we are like him we are in the
[13:36] image of
[13:38] him now now I I like how God does these
[13:42] things he says let us make man in our
[13:45] own image now we know that brother Bram
[13:47] he says that was his character that was
[13:50] his
[13:51] qualities and and right after that after
[13:55] he created them in the image then he
[13:58] said let them have
[14:00] dominion and this showing that your
[14:04] character is your qualification for your
[14:06] Dominion amen so first before you have
[14:10] leadership before there is the power or
[14:13] that that Authority the character has to
[14:16] take place so he said let them have the
[14:20] image of me my character now they can
[14:23] have the power or that
[14:25] Authority good so we see that in in uh
[14:30] in Genesis 1 127 there brother Bram he
[14:35] says in the Masterpiece he
[14:37] says now before I go into this so they
[14:40] had this
[14:43] Dominion then he rested and here he's
[14:46] showing how the Masterpiece fell he says
[14:50] while he was
[14:52] resting and trusting to his Masterpiece
[14:55] his enemy come in and found and found
[14:59] this Great Masterpiece and he by deceit
[15:03] he crawls under the garden walls and
[15:06] then he marred this beautiful
[15:08] Masterpiece he marred it so that it
[15:12] fell Satan he gave Eve a false
[15:16] conception of what to be like God
[15:20] is he gave even though she was already
[15:23] like
[15:24] God maybe he had an outward appearance
[15:28] he had a a thought of what he wanted as
[15:32] God and he be to project to
[15:35] her he be to project and he said this is
[15:38] the way you be like God even though her
[15:42] her character even her image was already
[15:44] like God and he and she was deceived
[15:49] because of
[15:50] it and when she accepted it she
[15:53] conceived and she birthed the
[15:56] seed now you you got you have to
[15:58] understand these people were in the
[15:59] image of
[16:01] God brother bradam says that Masterpiece
[16:03] was marred we know what happened she
[16:07] birthed a seed that had satanic Char
[16:12] characteristics and that's where the
[16:14] image of God it became marred the
[16:16] Masterpiece
[16:18] fell now we have all these the the
[16:22] characteristics of of being murderers
[16:25] and haters and and all of these evil
[16:28] things
[16:30] that uh in reality we find in
[16:34] ourselves those one of those things that
[16:36] need to be be chiseled out of us every
[16:39] single
[16:41] day now we see it in the human
[16:45] race brother brandham he says this in
[16:47] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[16:50] the Ephesian Church age and he lays it
[16:52] out perfectly here he says but God has
[16:56] revealed or reserved to himself that
[17:00] right he's talking about indwelling in
[17:03] man Satan cannot do that God Alone
[17:07] appeared in human flesh Satan could not
[17:10] do that he does not have creative Powers
[17:15] the only way for uh for Satan to
[17:17] accomplish what he wanted was to enter
[17:19] into the serpent in Eden even as the
[17:23] evil um as even as he entered by evil
[17:25] spirits into the swine of GAD God does
[17:29] not enter into animals but Satan can and
[17:32] will to accomplish his ends he could
[17:36] have not had a child directly by Eve as
[17:39] as God did by Mary so he entered into
[17:42] the serpent he beguiled Eve he seduced
[17:46] her by by her um seduced her and by her
[17:51] did San have a child
[17:53] vicariously Cain bore the full spiritual
[17:57] characteristics of Satan an animalistic
[18:02] censal fleshly characteristic of the
[18:05] serpent no wonder the holy spirit said
[18:09] that Cain was of that Wicked one he was
[18:13] now something that that stood out to me
[18:15] he had the spiritual characteristics of
[18:19] Satan and then he had the fleshly
[18:22] characteristics the animalistic
[18:25] characteristics of the serpent
[18:29] and and we see that that Adam and Eve
[18:31] were kicked out of the the Garden of
[18:33] Eden well that's where eternal life sat
[18:36] at that's where God's full presence was
[18:40] that and and he separated them brother
[18:42] bandam said that he he formed a Chasm
[18:44] between them he separated them and he
[18:47] said that that if he ever if anybody
[18:51] ever entered into that place they would
[18:54] have eternal life now I don't understand
[18:57] why brother brandham said it that way
[18:58] but but I know it's because that they
[19:03] didn't have the characteristics to hold
[19:06] eternal life
[19:07] anymore they they they could not re
[19:10] that's why they tried to make the Tower
[19:12] of babbles they tried to make all of
[19:14] these things we tried to make religions
[19:16] and all of that to get back to God but
[19:19] we're trying to get to a position that
[19:21] we don't have the nature to
[19:24] hold so God kicked him out
[19:28] Brothers we solely we are the only ones
[19:32] that were made for that
[19:34] Holiness but when it escapes us we
[19:38] suffer
[19:40] deprivation a deep rooted sense of
[19:42] lostness and restlessness because we are
[19:45] out of sync with the nature we were
[19:48] created to
[19:50] bear that that's the The Thirst that you
[19:53] see in the world that's why people want
[19:56] to go and worship gods and and all of
[19:58] these things why they're out of sync
[20:00] with the nature that they were created
[20:03] to
[20:04] Bear now God's
[20:06] values his word that used to
[20:09] liberate his word that used to allow
[20:12] them to do whatever they wanted to do in
[20:14] the Garden of Eden now it
[20:17] arrests now now it puts into
[20:20] prison whenever they they created the
[20:24] law which was God's word which was God's
[20:27] values which was what showed God's
[20:30] righteousness and his judgment now
[20:32] whenever they tried to receive it it
[20:35] Arrested them it took them into
[20:38] judgment God's own character because I I
[20:41] remember telling you guys on Sunday that
[20:44] his word is his
[20:46] values so now he tried to give his
[20:50] values to his children and all it did
[20:52] was condemn their
[20:54] sin it condemned the
[20:57] flesh it arrested them and put them to
[21:00] jail and it could not save
[21:04] them in Romans
[21:06] 8 8 uh verses 3 and 4 it says for what
[21:11] the law could not do in that it was weak
[21:16] through the
[21:17] flesh what was it it was weak through
[21:20] the
[21:21] flesh because our our body our character
[21:25] did not match with his
[21:27] values so no matter how much we try no
[21:30] matter how much we try to conform into
[21:34] the image of God we're always going to
[21:36] create
[21:37] denominations we're always going to
[21:39] create a a form of godliness we're
[21:43] always going to think okay this is to be
[21:45] like God and we're going to arrest
[21:48] people we're going to put people down
[21:51] why because we're using it without the
[21:54] freedom of the spirit without his
[21:57] character right
[22:01] so here A Commentary it said in that it
[22:05] was weak through flesh there is no
[22:08] constant
[22:09] impediment in the way of the success of
[22:12] the
[22:13] law that it had to be carried out by
[22:16] human agents so this had to be carried
[22:18] out but it was beset by our human human
[22:21] uh human Frailty a Frailty naturally
[22:24] consequent upon that physical
[22:27] organization with with which man is
[22:30] endowed Temptation and sin have their
[22:32] roots in the physical part of a human
[22:35] nature and and they were too strong for
[22:38] the purely moral influence of the law
[22:41] the law was limited in the operations by
[22:44] them and failed to overcome them so
[22:48] God's word that's his
[22:50] values that's that's his character that
[22:53] shows who he
[22:55] is these are the principles and ideas
[23:00] of his character and w a w unable to
[23:04] fulfill or to fully follow God's law
[23:07] because the lack of character or nature
[23:10] that embodies God's
[23:12] values in other words humans are
[23:14] imperfect were Pro or prone to to fail
[23:18] and adhere completely to God's standards
[23:21] due to the inherent flaws such as
[23:24] sinfulness and moral
[23:26] imperfections so there is no no way that
[23:29] we can sink up to God anymore there was
[23:33] no way for us to to go to God and and uh
[23:37] actually they couldn't even see God
[23:40] anymore they they couldn't even see his
[23:43] image
[23:44] anymore why we were so imperfection we
[23:47] were so in
[23:49] imperfect here in brother uh in
[23:51] Masterpiece brother Bram says all the
[23:54] prophets had flaws all the ones uh was
[23:59] was a all the ones was a portion but
[24:02] here at last coming up through that
[24:04] finally comes the Masterpiece the
[24:07] perfect one no fault in him at all so
[24:13] perfect reflected of the Builder himself
[24:16] his own image was reflected in his
[24:20] work God and Christ were one in so much
[24:23] that he put his own Spirit into him and
[24:26] then even the image and the Builder
[24:29] became one if you continue to read
[24:33] Romans 3 it says God sending his own son
[24:37] in the likeness of sinful flesh so the
[24:41] image that brother bram's talking about
[24:43] it wasn't a physical image it wasn't
[24:46] something that was glorious that we were
[24:48] going to see but it was the fullness of
[24:50] the characteristics of God and finally
[24:54] he came to take us out of the hole take
[24:58] us out of the the the prison that Satan
[25:01] put us in how did he do it by his own
[25:06] characteristics he said there must be
[25:08] something to save this creation and
[25:11] nothing could save it because the
[25:13] highest species of the creation has had
[25:15] fallen and every everything under it
[25:19] fell with it because it fell there's
[25:21] only one thing left that did not fall
[25:24] and that was God the heavens so
[25:27] something of the heavens had to come
[25:30] down and redeem his creation because
[25:33] there was nothing here that could create
[25:35] it and God's Own love for the World
[25:39] created um for the World created the
[25:42] character
[25:44] expressed in Christ let me let me refra
[25:47] let me say that again God's Own love for
[25:49] the
[25:50] World created the character expressed in
[25:53] Christ he was God's character he was
[25:57] God's expressed image in him was God God
[26:01] in Christ revealing himself to the world
[26:04] and no one could love ever no one no
[26:07] love could ever be greater than that
[26:09] love such a person would come that he
[26:13] did in order to redeem what was
[26:17] lost if we continue it
[26:22] says that Jesus it says that God sending
[26:26] his own son in the likeness of the
[26:28] sinful flesh and sin condemned in
[26:32] sin condemned sin in the flesh that the
[26:36] righteousness of the law might be
[26:38] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[26:40] flesh but after the spirit now I I think
[26:44] about it and I believe that the the
[26:46] fullness of God was with Adam and Eve
[26:49] the fullness was of because they were
[26:51] holy so so God didn't have to truly Veil
[26:56] himself the way he did in the Old
[26:58] Testament and even the way he does
[27:01] now but brother Brenham says that that
[27:05] God could not fully reveal himself
[27:08] through Adam and Eve he could not fully
[27:12] Express his attributes so no matter what
[27:15] form or whatever God showed himself
[27:18] because we know that God is an invisible
[27:21] Spirit he's just not this thing floating
[27:24] around it's something that is outside
[27:26] our of our realm of thinking yeah so and
[27:30] whatever form he showed Adam and Eve it
[27:33] was greater than what was in the Old
[27:35] Testament yet he did not reveal himself
[27:40] fully because as what brother bham said
[27:43] in in the unveiling of God he says that
[27:45] the veiling of God or the hiding of God
[27:49] reveals
[27:50] himself so whenever God would hide
[27:52] himself in a certain form he would
[27:54] reveal himself in a certain
[27:57] characteristic whenever he he uh came
[28:00] down to Adam I mean to Abraham when
[28:02] Abram was about to sacrifice his son he
[28:05] goes and he reveals himself there and
[28:09] what does he call himself I am Jehovah
[28:12] Gyra what was it a
[28:15] characteristic and he revealed himself
[28:17] he revealed himself to Moses as a pillar
[28:19] of fire and he says I am that I
[28:23] am so you would see little tiny glimpse
[28:27] of the image of God and that wasn't
[28:30] physical images but he was showing his
[28:33] characteristics there was one time where
[28:36] Moses he said Lord let me just see you
[28:40] you know you get to a relationship with
[28:42] God you get so close to God that you
[28:45] just say Lord I just want to see you
[28:48] Moses got so close to God his
[28:51] relationship to where he said Lord I I
[28:53] just want to see your face and God says
[28:57] okay he says but you're not going to see
[28:59] my face because no one has ever looked
[29:01] upon me and lived you will die at seeing
[29:06] my reflection seeing who I am my image
[29:09] so as he begin to pass he saw the back
[29:12] of a man but what's amazing is whenever
[29:15] he begin to walk by he begin to declare
[29:19] his
[29:20] attributes he declared how graceful he
[29:24] was how great his word was because that
[29:27] is his characteristics that is his
[29:31] image so he couldn't fully Express
[29:34] himself to Adam and
[29:36] Eve and as as the fall
[29:40] came this is what amazing about about us
[29:44] is is when there's Falls in our lives
[29:47] when there's problems when there's
[29:49] things um um
[29:52] setbacks that's when character comes
[29:56] out that's when character is
[29:59] expressed and and whenever the world
[30:02] seemed like it was completely lost there
[30:05] was no way for it to be redeemed
[30:08] character begin to flourish with God
[30:12] that's how God shows his character the
[30:14] more stressful the situation the more
[30:17] trials character
[30:20] blossoms and that's why under suffering
[30:23] under problems under things character is
[30:26] molded that's where character
[30:28] is its
[30:30] best see that's why sometimes whenever
[30:33] we're going through something we have to
[30:35] look within ourselves and say Lord am I
[30:37] displaying God's
[30:39] character whenever we're going through
[30:41] something and and and we begin to to
[30:44] become wild man we say whoa something's
[30:47] not
[30:48] right if I can't take this little
[30:51] tribulation if I when that beating comes
[30:54] brother Bram says it's it's only the
[30:56] beating of the maker right cuz we're
[30:59] we're we're it's a trial of faith that
[31:02] is more precious than gold so it is us
[31:05] we are that gold and the more he beats
[31:08] the more he he tests us the more we look
[31:12] like
[31:13] him man that's that's easy to say Amen
[31:16] but it's hard to live there it's hard to
[31:20] live in our flesh but the spirit's going
[31:22] to lift you up every single time the
[31:25] spirit is going to allow you to change
[31:27] change and mold into those things so
[31:30] that you can
[31:32] overcome and whenever God sees you he
[31:34] sees his own image his own reflection
[31:37] why because your character was a victory
[31:40] over your trials your tribulations and
[31:42] God shows us that through the act of
[31:45] recondition what did it cause him to do
[31:48] caused them the Bible says to be formed
[31:52] into the very image of sinful flesh to
[31:55] look like us to go through what we went
[31:58] through so that he can understand our
[32:01] faults so that he could be
[32:04] projected his very
[32:07] image so his character it it it would
[32:10] produce a
[32:11] body his character produced the body of
[32:14] Jesus
[32:16] Christ and that's what I love about
[32:19] God because you look at at Jesus and you
[32:24] see the fullness of God you see the full
[32:27] fullness of his
[32:29] character you want to know how God acts
[32:32] how what would Jesus do what would God
[32:35] do look at
[32:37] Jesus look at what he did everything
[32:41] that he did projected the very heart of
[32:43] God and I I love what brother brandham
[32:45] he always or he would say this and it
[32:47] would just stuck in be stuck in my mind
[32:49] he'd say I would think that God was
[32:51] angry with me but Jesus loved me then he
[32:55] realized that Jesus was the very heart
[32:57] of of God now now God he puts himself in
[33:01] a vulnerable
[33:03] situation I don't I don't know about any
[33:05] of us but to put your heart out in the
[33:09] line knowing it's going to be
[33:12] crushed knowing that it's going to be
[33:15] despised taking all of all of the walls
[33:19] away and putting it out there that's
[33:22] what God did he took the very heart of
[33:26] himself and and he showed his
[33:29] love because he brother Bram says it
[33:33] it's God's three-fold
[33:35] purpose he what what is he trying to do
[33:38] he had to make himself vulnerable he had
[33:40] to manifest himself first so that he
[33:42] could dwell in
[33:44] US brother Bram says he says God veiled
[33:48] in a form of a man he says this in
[33:52] unveiling of God he says he hid himself
[33:54] from their view they could only see a
[33:56] man but those predes inated seed seeing
[34:00] God one saw a man the other one saw God
[34:03] see and it was God veiled in a human
[34:06] being making both of them right but your
[34:10] faith is what you don't see man I like
[34:14] that I like that sometimes it's hard to
[34:18] see behind the
[34:19] flesh sometimes we we see somebody
[34:22] coming up and we know their past and we
[34:24] be like no not this
[34:26] guy oh not not this girl not knowing
[34:31] that God he placed a seed in
[34:34] there man what an amazing thing and
[34:36] whenever the Pharisees saw Jesus Christ
[34:39] it wasn't to their
[34:41] liking they they created by the law this
[34:45] whole concept of what God should be and
[34:48] you know what I believe they got that
[34:50] from Satan because even brother brandham
[34:51] says that Satan he couldn't believe that
[34:54] that was the son of God he said how
[34:57] could he allow people to spit on him how
[35:00] could he allow him to put up with those
[35:03] things not God not the one that I saw
[35:07] see brother Adam said that he thought
[35:09] God dwelt in Beauty and when maybe when
[35:12] he would see God he would see the glory
[35:14] of God but he didn't know the virtue
[35:17] that that you have to hold in order to
[35:20] hold that
[35:22] position and whenever that virtue came
[35:24] down and he showed himself completely
[35:28] am I pray that I I could do that I pray
[35:32] that I can be like God man that's a bold
[35:36] statement I want to be like
[35:39] God and how to be like
[35:43] Jesus to have Christ in
[35:45] me see our flesh we cannot fulfill God's
[35:49] word no matter how much we try we can
[35:52] come to church we can read the Bible and
[35:55] all it's going to do it's going to
[35:56] arrest us yeah it's going to form a
[36:00] religion it's going to create a Tower of
[36:04] Babel we're going to create a concept of
[36:06] what God should be or God maybe God is
[36:09] this why because it's our fleshly
[36:13] character trying to grasp the values of
[36:18] God trying to grasp his
[36:21] thoughts and and his what he wants for
[36:25] us but in in
[36:28] Hebrews it tells us in in four it says
[36:32] that the righteousness of the law might
[36:34] be fulfilled in US sin was condemned by
[36:38] his
[36:39] flesh so that the righteousness of the
[36:42] law might be fulfilled in us who walk
[36:45] not after the flesh but walk after the
[36:48] spirit Brothers I realize this is not a
[36:52] command we're not commanded to follow
[36:55] the
[36:56] law you as young
[36:59] people you know me as a young person
[37:02] that's what I try to do I grab this word
[37:06] and I arrested My Flesh trying to
[37:09] fulfill the law without the
[37:12] spirit but but Paul is giving us a fact
[37:16] and not a command that Jesus he did this
[37:21] so that the spirit within us might be
[37:24] able to fulfill God's values and his
[37:27] desires
[37:29] what is it our character our nature
[37:31] sinking up with his once more so that
[37:35] even in our flesh we're not walking in
[37:37] our flesh no more but we're walking
[37:39] after the
[37:40] spirit and we're following the word not
[37:44] because we have to but because it's our
[37:46] nature now amen it's a character it's a
[37:49] character change and there's no way we
[37:53] could do it only by the Holy
[37:55] Spirit that's what I like about God is
[37:59] that he's not going to give us a
[38:01] religion he's not going to give us his
[38:02] word he's going to give us the power to
[38:04] overcome everything that we need and
[38:08] once the trials and the tribulations
[38:11] come it's all right you can trust in his
[38:14] word you can trust in his values knowing
[38:17] that his values are now
[38:19] yours and whenever Trials come up you
[38:23] can be just like Jesus and trust in him
[38:27] and give him all the honor and the
[38:30] glory let us stand to our feet I had
[38:33] small little U
[38:34] message but for me this this is
[38:38] something that God has been working with
[38:41] me every single
[38:44] day knowing that our flesh it's it's of
[38:49] this Earth it's fleshly it's
[38:52] Earthly but if we allow the Holy Spirit
[38:56] to live in our lives
[38:58] if we allow the word to be born in
[39:01] within us because like Moses his mom
[39:06] brother Bram says her character was
[39:09] great it was a great character but it
[39:12] could never match up to the character of
[39:14] God and no matter how much how good we
[39:18] were raised no matter what life we've
[39:20] lived no matter what things that molded
[39:23] our fleshly character it will never
[39:25] amount to the word of God we'll never be
[39:28] able to live up to it but if we allow
[39:31] the Holy Spirit to come in and you allow
[39:33] Jesus Christ the one that is here today
[39:37] the one that that has revealed the word
[39:40] has revealed this word through our
[39:43] Prophet he's here
[39:45] today so that we could take in that word
[39:47] and we don't see it and we're like oh my
[39:49] goodness this is too much you know I I
[39:52] don't know about you guys but sometimes
[39:53] you see the message you're like
[39:55] whoa allow the Holy Spirit to come in
[39:59] and those things that are so great
[40:01] become as as brother uh Aaron was
[40:04] preaching it becomes
[40:06] simplified you begin to live it in your
[40:08] daily lives every single day it becomes
[40:11] a a a lifestyle instead of a
[40:14] religion that's something that I want in
[40:16] my life I want a
[40:19] lifestyle I I I don't want to be part of
[40:22] anything else but Jesus
[40:24] Christ and if that's the goal if God
[40:28] um if that's something that you want to
[40:31] be in the image of God he's here he's
[40:34] here so that you can accept it let us
[40:37] bow our
[40:38] heads Heavenly
[40:41] Father Lord we're just so thankful
[40:45] father for your grace and your mercy
[40:48] Lord Lord if it wasn't for you I who
[40:51] knows where we would be at
[40:53] father maybe we'd still be here but but
[40:57] our hearts would be far away Lord but
[41:01] father by your grace you have bestowed
[41:04] the greatest thing which was your word

[41:10] just receive words father but Lord we
[41:13] receive your Holy Spirit and it can
[41:15] change us father it can change our very
[41:18] actions our very thoughts every single
[41:20] thing that that tries to hold us back
[41:24] from more of you Lord Jesus father I ask
[41:28] Lord that each and every person you just
[41:30] touch them Lord whatever they need
[41:32] father if they need more of you Lord I
[41:34] ask father that you give them more of
[41:36] you father you have given us that
[41:39] promise Lord You Have Not held it back
[41:42] from us you didn't create certain things
[41:45] that we have to do in order to receive
[41:47] it you said
[41:48] believe believe and receive it Lord and
[41:51] I just ask father that you raise up the
[41:53] faith of each and every person that we
[41:55] receive more and more of you father that
[41:58] we can reflect your image father to our
[42:02] families to our children to our
[42:06] co-workers Lord that every time we see
