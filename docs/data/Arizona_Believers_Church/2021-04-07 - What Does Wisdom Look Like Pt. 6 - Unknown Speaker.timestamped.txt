[0:00] revelations chapter 2 verses 1 to 6
[0:03] unto the angel of the church of ephesus
[0:05] write
[0:06] these things say of he that holdeth the
[0:08] seven stars in his right hand
[0:10] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[0:12] golden candlesticks
[0:14] i know thy works and thy labor and thy
[0:16] patience and how that can't
[0:17] not bear them which are evil and thou
[0:20] hast tried them which say they are
[0:21] apostles and are not
[0:23] and has found them liars and that's born
[0:26] and has patience and for
[0:27] my namesake has labored and has not
[0:30] fainted
[0:31] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[0:32] thee because thou has
[0:34] left thy first love remember therefore
[0:37] from whence thou art fallen and repent
[0:38] and do the first works or else i'll come
[0:41] unto thee quickly and will remove thy
[0:42] candlestick out of his place
[0:44] except thou repent but this thou hast
[0:48] that thou hatest the deeds of the
[0:49] nicolaitans which i also
[0:52] hate amen you may be seated
[0:56] our subject is still um the question of
[0:58] what does wisdom look like
[1:01] and our uh subtitle or the
[1:04] the kind of the answer to that question
[1:06] that we're having using this evening is
[1:08] cultivating
[1:09] and if that seems a bit odd what does
[1:11] wisdom look like
[1:12] it's cultivating it's it's something
[1:14] that cultivates and so we want to
[1:16] expound upon that a little bit this
[1:17] evening i feel in my heart that we may
[1:19] move on from at least this naming
[1:22] convention of the
[1:23] of the services and just trying to wrap
[1:25] up this particular question of what does
[1:27] wisdom look like
[1:28] but by no means uh exhausting the
[1:30] subject but just
[1:31] feeling that this will kind of help
[1:33] round out how we have been looking at
[1:35] how
[1:35] things are complicated and it takes the
[1:38] wisdom of god to navigate the
[1:39] complications that exist in life
[1:41] and we've been using the wisdom from
[1:44] above and even this question of what
[1:45] does wisdom look like
[1:47] so that we could have principles that we
[1:49] can use scriptural principles very clear
[1:51] scriptural principles that we use to
[1:53] judge our thoughts so that when we're
[1:55] thinking something is this wisdom from
[1:56] above or is this
[1:57] wisdom from below and we can use this as
[2:00] a measuring stick as a as a microscope
[2:02] as it were to say well
[2:04] are my decisions are my actions are they
[2:06] are they measuring up with the
[2:08] characteristics of wisdom which is from
[2:10] above
[2:11] and so in asking what does wisdom look
[2:13] like we're really looking at what's the
[2:15] fruit of wisdom
[2:16] and in james chapter 3 he's using the
[2:19] thought
[2:20] even in the book of james he's looking
[2:21] at fruits and product and what comes
[2:23] forth
[2:24] as a means to determine whether or not
[2:26] someone has wisdom
[2:28] is there one that claims to be wise let
[2:30] him show it by his work let him show it
[2:31] by his fruits
[2:33] and we've used we've looked at how that
[2:36] wisdom is confident
[2:37] in being confident it's fully assured it
[2:40] is it means that you can be firmly
[2:42] trusting it's reliant it's bold and
[2:44] daring it's reliable
[2:45] and you can trust in it and last
[2:47] wednesday we were looking at the
[2:49] specific aspect
[2:50] of wisdom as being uh consistent which
[2:52] means to stand firm or to take a
[2:54] a take your position and to be at rest
[2:57] even
[2:58] and so what we were ending on is how
[3:00] that wisdom has
[3:01] stable footing that if you're going to
[3:03] make a decision and it's wisdom then you
[3:05] feel that you've got solid ground
[3:07] and it's a it's a stable place to launch
[3:09] from
[3:10] they say well god has given me this
[3:12] wisdom i know this is the right decision
[3:14] you know you have solid footing
[3:15] and you're willing to put your foot down
[3:17] or you're willing to to trust in it to
[3:19] rely upon it
[3:20] and take a firm stand because you know
[3:22] that this is a solid
[3:24] foundation wisdom gives you solid
[3:26] footing wisdom gives you a solid
[3:28] foundation
[3:29] it's it's that basis upon which you can
[3:31] act or think
[3:32] like this is what i'm resting on this is
[3:34] what i'm counting on
[3:36] this is wisdom so then i have confidence
[3:38] going forward
[3:39] and in having that you can be consistent
[3:42] and
[3:43] one thing that was emphasized last time
[3:45] that i want to carry over to tonight
[3:47] is how that wisdom from above is
[3:49] connected with the heart of god
[3:52] that when we we have the wisdom of god
[3:53] we're not just kind of mimicking his
[3:55] outward motions
[3:56] because anyone could look at somebody
[3:58] and just impersonate oh well he's doing
[3:59] this then i'm going to do this and while
[4:01] he's doing that
[4:02] i'm going to do that but wisdom is
[4:03] connected with the heart of god
[4:05] where we're not just merely
[4:06] impersonating but we we're demonstrating
[4:08] because we have the same nature and the
[4:10] same life
[4:11] and we do not want to be a church or a
[4:13] family
[4:15] or a believer in the individual sense
[4:17] that's merely just impersonating the
[4:19] attributes and characteristics of
[4:20] christianity
[4:21] but have the life and the nature on the
[4:23] inside so that we're demonstrating it
[4:25] and you could only do that you
[4:27] impersonate by education
[4:29] just learn and learn how someone talks
[4:31] learn how they act and there's certain
[4:32] mannerisms or something to where
[4:34] once you get the you get a certain
[4:35] characteristic in someone's voice
[4:37] then all of a sudden you could just
[4:38] start talking like bill clinton
[4:40] why because you just pick up on some
[4:42] little aspect and by education you can
[4:44] impersonate
[4:45] but when it comes to actually having the
[4:47] life when you have a revelation you
[4:49] demonstrate
[4:50] i do not impersonate aaron mcgeary i am
[4:52] aaron mcgeary therefore i just
[4:54] demonstrate
[4:54] what his nature is and what his
[4:56] character is and what his life is
[4:58] and so we want to be connected with the
[5:00] heart of god
[5:01] so that our actions aren't just shallow
[5:04] just mimicking
[5:04] and just doing the things that we see
[5:06] others doing but we understand his
[5:08] intent
[5:09] and so when we when we see the word of
[5:11] god and we see what the word requires
[5:13] revelation
[5:14] connects you with his intent so you're
[5:16] not just following the letter
[5:18] outwardly you'll be following the letter
[5:20] but inwardly you'll be connected with
[5:21] what he's wanting to accomplish
[5:22] you have the thought behind it the logos
[5:24] behind it and that's much more effective
[5:27] as the letter killeth and the spirit
[5:29] giveth life it's that that same emphasis
[5:31] that i want to know the heart of god
[5:33] not just so that i'm legalistic and i'm
[5:34] technically complying with what's
[5:36] required of me
[5:37] but i know what he's wanting i know what
[5:39] he wants to accomplish i see the wisdom
[5:40] behind
[5:41] why he asks sisters to dress a certain
[5:43] way why he requires brothers to be a
[5:45] certain way
[5:46] i know the wisdom behind it therefore
[5:48] it's more than just the rules
[5:49] that um that we see in them black and
[5:51] white
[5:52] and we were emphasizing how that stable
[5:56] relationships are upheld by
[5:59] uh and really held together and stand
[6:01] upon the consistency of wisdom
[6:04] and that's really what we're bound
[6:06] together as believers that's what binds
[6:08] us to truth and this is what's going to
[6:09] be effective
[6:10] in the relationships that we have to one
[6:12] another in the body of christ in the
[6:14] husband to wife and the parents to
[6:15] children
[6:16] the one thing that we could always
[6:18] strive for is a greater consistency in
[6:20] relationship
[6:21] again not resorting to just a rule a
[6:23] list of things to do and
[6:25] and list of what to say and what to do
[6:27] because if you have the list
[6:28] you can fulfill the list but yet they're
[6:31] not any
[6:32] any real connection in your heart to one
[6:33] another and you say well i'm doing
[6:35] everything that's on the list you told
[6:36] me you wanted me to do this you told me
[6:37] you wanted me to do that
[6:38] but there's really no connection in the
[6:40] heart and so
[6:42] stable relationships relationship we
[6:43] have to one another in in
[6:45] marriage to one another in the body of
[6:47] christ parent to child
[6:49] it's really upheld by the consistency of
[6:51] wisdom not the rigidity of rules
[6:53] not just the discipline to these are the
[6:55] rules these are this is the way things
[6:56] are done
[6:57] it's really connected with the wisdom
[6:59] and we quoted oswald chambers how that
[7:01] he said most of us are not consistent
[7:03] spiritually
[7:04] because we're more concerned about being
[7:06] consistent externally
[7:08] we want things to look right but really
[7:10] inwardly we're not right
[7:11] and we spend so much time trying to get
[7:13] the optics right and the way it looks
[7:14] and
[7:15] and and get everything done in the list
[7:17] or the rules and
[7:18] and be disciplined externally but yet
[7:20] all we really need to do is get
[7:22] consistent internally
[7:24] uh really tap into what the the heart is
[7:26] telling us and what the word of god says
[7:28] and catch in his heart and then once we
[7:30] can become spiritually consistent
[7:32] the rest really follows but when we're
[7:34] very good
[7:35] consistently externally uh we we get
[7:37] wore down externally and all of a sudden
[7:39] there's
[7:39] there's some friction and then there's
[7:41] some tearing down or some breach
[7:43] in in our actions and that's when we
[7:45] failed to uphold
[7:46] the consistency of the word so we're not
[7:48] concerned about being compliant
[7:49] externally but we're really this is the
[7:52] then looking at the wisdom of god it's
[7:53] making sure that we're consistent
[7:55] internally within our hearts and
[7:57] consistent spiritually
[7:59] because external compliance is shallow
[8:03] it's if we say beauty is skin deep you
[8:04] know that that's to meant to make the
[8:06] point that
[8:07] really what if your beauty beautiful
[8:09] outwardly that's only what's on the
[8:10] surface
[8:11] but what's inside what's lurking beneath
[8:13] that what's the heart of someone what's
[8:14] their character what's their personality
[8:16] really what kind of attitude they have
[8:18] are they are they nice are they sweet
[8:19] that's what's
[8:20] conveyed by that uh phrase that beauty
[8:22] is only skin deep
[8:24] and external compliance just getting
[8:26] everything to fit externally is very
[8:27] shallow
[8:29] and the goal of wisdom is not just to
[8:31] get the outside to look right but it's
[8:33] to form the correct character in
[8:35] someone's heart
[8:36] and it's to inspire the heart this works
[8:39] on the individual level
[8:41] as god deals with us he's not just
[8:42] trying to wash us out on the outside
[8:44] but he wants to inspire us in the heart
[8:47] as paul even writes it i want to
[8:49] invigorate you in the inner man i want
[8:50] to inspire the inner man
[8:52] i don't want to just give you a list of
[8:53] do's and don'ts and you guys got it all
[8:55] figured out when i show up and i visit
[8:56] you
[8:57] everything looks good on the outside his
[8:59] intent and his purpose was to inspire
[9:01] the inner man to invigorate him to
[9:03] motivate him and to quicken him because
[9:05] he knew if that guy can be motivated
[9:08] then the rest takes care of itself and
[9:10] that's the one you're motivating that's
[9:11] the one that you're teaching and
[9:12] instructing
[9:13] so as we are even following the
[9:16] trajectory of in the beginning god
[9:17] created a family and there's certain
[9:19] family dynamics that the word speaks to
[9:21] and there's
[9:21] ways that we ought to uh function as a
[9:24] father and as husband and his wife and
[9:26] his mother and his children
[9:27] it's not a matter of figuring out what
[9:29] all the rules are but it's a matter of
[9:31] forming the right kind of character in
[9:33] our hearts an inspiring heart
[9:35] and that's what wisdom does wisdom does
[9:38] that
[9:38] and it can be different in every
[9:40] situation the decision a parent makes
[9:41] the direction of family goes
[9:43] it can be different it won't move
[9:44] contrary to the word but the wisdom of
[9:47] it will be the same that this is what
[9:48] we're trying to produce this is what
[9:49] we're trying to accomplish
[9:51] and so tonight as we've already
[9:53] mentioned that wisdom what does wisdom
[9:55] look like
[9:55] cultivating it's cultivating it
[9:57] cultivates and it means to prepare to ra
[10:00] it raises it prepares it develops
[10:02] it produces so when we're saying it it
[10:04] call it's cultivating what does it look
[10:06] like it's
[10:06] it cultivates how we're looking at how
[10:09] even the word
[10:10] it comes from to teal or to labor to
[10:12] tend
[10:13] and if you just looked up a definition
[10:15] of cultivate it means to prepare
[10:17] or use prepare or use land uh primarily
[10:20] for crops or for gardening
[10:22] and that would be what we think about oh
[10:24] they cult they're cultivating they're
[10:25] working in a field they're preparing the
[10:27] land
[10:27] or they're using the land for crops and
[10:29] that would be the sowing of seed to
[10:30] produce
[10:31] fruit that is harvested and that is
[10:33] utilized but then we also say
[10:35] cultivate in the way that we might say
[10:37] cultivate a relationship or
[10:38] cultivate something so it's used to to
[10:41] speak of acquiring or developing
[10:43] equality a sentiment or a skill and this
[10:46] is what exactly what i mean by
[10:48] cultivating when we talk about what does
[10:49] wisdom look like
[10:51] wisdom cult is cultivating in that it
[10:54] produces the right results
[10:57] and that this really is repetitive i
[10:58] know for some of you are very very keen
[11:00] you're like well that's kind of what
[11:01] you've been telling us
[11:02] in the first five parts and so that's
[11:03] just what i want to tell you again
[11:05] that way if you only get one out of six
[11:07] you've got it all
[11:08] you've got it all but wisdom produces
[11:11] the right results
[11:12] so it's all about bringing forth good
[11:14] fruit and that was the emphasis we found
[11:16] in james chapter three
[11:17] a tree bringing forth fruit and the
[11:18] fruit of righteousness is received by
[11:21] those who
[11:21] sow in peace and so wisdom is
[11:24] demonstrated by the fruit that it bears
[11:27] so it's cultivating it prepares it it
[11:29] acquires it develops and it's
[11:31] it's chilling and it's laboring it
[11:33] raises up and these all the things
[11:35] that wisdom does so it ought to bring
[11:38] and produce the right kind of
[11:40] manifestation
[11:42] and that gives us a way to ask ourselves
[11:43] well we've been doing this
[11:45] do we see the fruits of it do we see the
[11:46] results of it in proverbs chapter 10
[11:49] verse 16 it says the labor of the
[11:50] righteous tendeth to life
[11:53] the fruit of the wicked to sin so the
[11:56] wages or the reward of
[11:58] uprightness the wages or the reward the
[12:00] labor of
[12:01] upright correct behavior is something
[12:03] that's meaningful or beneficial
[12:05] the labor the righteous tend it to life
[12:07] it's beneficial it's meaningful
[12:09] it's it's good and that's what exactly
[12:12] what the scripture is saying the labor
[12:13] the fruit
[12:14] of righteous labor tends to life it
[12:16] manifests itself in meaningful
[12:18] beneficial things and but the fruit of
[12:20] the wicked
[12:21] is sin so there's a way that you examine
[12:24] conduct you is this righteous is the
[12:26] correct is this upright
[12:27] because that will tend to life it does
[12:29] not corrupt does not bring curse but it
[12:31] brings life it brings blessing
[12:33] and the question of what does wisdom
[12:35] look like and then we say that it's
[12:37] cultivating then we're at what are we
[12:40] cultivating
[12:41] if we look at our own spirits or our
[12:43] families our spouse or
[12:44] our children what is it we're how is it
[12:47] we're preparing them
[12:48] what is it we're sowing into them what
[12:50] is it we're watering what are our
[12:51] thoughts
[12:52] what are our thoughts our actions in our
[12:54] decisions what are they yielding
[12:57] you think in terms of seed is being sown
[12:59] seed is being watered and nurtured well
[13:01] let's look at the harvest of it let's
[13:03] look at the fruits of it
[13:04] and many can testify that i've noticed
[13:06] that whenever we do this
[13:08] this happens and when you notice well it
[13:11] just seems to be
[13:12] that when we allow this so we do this or
[13:14] this happens that it produces this
[13:16] particular result and that can be in a
[13:18] good way
[13:18] so have you ever noticed that when we as
[13:20] a family set out to do this that it
[13:22] always brings the right kind of attitude
[13:24] and it creates the right kind of spirit
[13:26] or
[13:26] whenever you fellowship with someone in
[13:28] particular it just leaves you in courage
[13:30] or maybe
[13:30] you go do a particular activity and you
[13:32] find that your spirit is revived
[13:34] and then there's other ways you could
[13:35] find that on the flip side there's
[13:36] things that kind of
[13:37] make us a little bit more agitated and
[13:39] frustrated and we get a little bit more
[13:40] irritable
[13:41] that's that's inspecting the fruits of
[13:43] something we can ask ourselves
[13:45] am i am i producing the right kind of
[13:47] crop with my thoughts
[13:48] with my decisions and with my actions
[13:50] and that's the question that's being
[13:52] answered is what does wisdom look like
[13:54] so we're asking
[13:55] what are we cultivating are we using
[13:57] wisdom to cultivate
[13:58] as a way of challenging ourselves
[14:00] whether or not we're getting the right
[14:01] kind of fruits
[14:04] now in second timothy chapter three and
[14:06] this is where we'll just
[14:08] or we're beyond our foundation now
[14:11] and and we're gonna build upon this the
[14:13] bible says in second timothy chapter 3
[14:15] verse 16
[14:16] that all scripture when it says all
[14:19] scripture that means all scripture
[14:22] is given by inspiration of god and is
[14:25] profitable for doctrine for reproof
[14:28] for correction for instruction in
[14:30] righteousness
[14:32] the time i'm going to give this
[14:33] scripture tonight does not do it justice
[14:35] in any way because it has so much depth
[14:37] but the bible says all scripture is
[14:39] given by theoph nustos which is
[14:41] the breath of god all scripture is the
[14:43] breath of god
[14:45] and it being the breath of god it has
[14:46] come from his inspiration
[14:48] his instinct this is an utterance of his
[14:50] thoughts and his mind
[14:52] and so it says that the word of god all
[14:54] scripture which is
[14:55] the breath of god is profitable
[14:58] that means it yields a benefit the word
[15:00] of god all scripture is profitable for
[15:02] that means it's beneficial
[15:04] it is useful and in luke chapter 11
[15:07] verse 49 we don't have this
[15:09] scripture on this slide but jesus is
[15:11] quoting from the old testament he says
[15:13] therefore also
[15:14] said the wisdom of god i will send them
[15:16] prophets and apostles
[15:18] and some of them they shall slay and
[15:20] persecute
[15:21] so jesus when he's quoting scripture he
[15:23] says therefore also said
[15:25] the wisdom of god so read it this way
[15:28] all scripture is given by inspiration
[15:31] all
[15:31] scripture is the wisdom of god or the
[15:33] wisdom of god is given by his
[15:35] inspiration and the wisdom of god is
[15:38] profitable the word is the wisdom of god
[15:41] it is god's wisdom and the word then
[15:43] which is the wisdom of god
[15:44] yields a spiritual and moral benefit
[15:48] all scripture which is the wisdom of god
[15:50] is given by god's inspiration and is
[15:52] profitable it yields a
[15:53] benefit to the individual it is useful
[15:56] he says for doctrine it is profitable
[15:58] useful and beneficial
[15:59] for reproof for testing examination and
[16:02] for correction to
[16:03] to to correct conduct and to uh to get
[16:06] in step to get in
[16:08] line so the word of god the wisdom of
[16:10] god is profitable
[16:11] think about how useful it is it's
[16:12] profitable for doctrine for reproof for
[16:14] correction
[16:15] and then it says for instruction
[16:18] and this word instruction i know that we
[16:20] we could think well we know what
[16:21] instructions
[16:22] are and i just it pops in my mind now
[16:25] that i'm sure some of us have had that
[16:27] uh test before where we're we're taught
[16:29] from the very beginning
[16:30] read all the instructions first before
[16:32] you start taking the test
[16:34] and so and it's all it may be italicized
[16:37] at the beginning and you're always
[16:38] supposed to read the instructions before
[16:39] you start answering questions
[16:41] and so at some point in your academic
[16:43] career a teacher hands out a test
[16:45] and it looks like it's a list of
[16:48] instructions and one of them says
[16:49] you know raise your hand or stand up and
[16:51] stomp your feet and there's a list of 30
[16:53] instructions
[16:54] and you get to the end and the last one
[16:56] says do all of them
[16:58] do not don't do any of these just turn
[17:00] your paper over
[17:01] and and be quiet and so there's a
[17:04] for the next 10 minutes people are
[17:06] standing up and stomping their feet and
[17:08] there's always that one person who knows
[17:10] read all of them first who reads
[17:12] silently reads all of them and then just
[17:13] turns their paper over
[17:15] and sits there quietly where everyone
[17:16] else is making frog noises and standing
[17:18] up and turning around and doing
[17:20] everything that's in the instructions
[17:21] why because they didn't they didn't
[17:23] learn read all the instructions first
[17:26] and what's the first thing we do when we
[17:27] open up a box an ikea box
[17:29] we throw the instructions away the first
[17:32] thing we do we just throw the
[17:33] instructions away
[17:34] because we know even if we follow them
[17:36] we're probably not going to get it right
[17:38] but that's not what these instructions
[17:40] are speaking of so don't get all anxious
[17:42] instructions we hate them but it's it
[17:45] means
[17:46] that which instruction this is what the
[17:47] word mean it means that which
[17:49] cultivates character so instruction is
[17:52] not just a list of rules but it's an
[17:54] approach
[17:55] it's something that cultivates character
[17:58] it's something that corrects mistakes
[18:00] and curbs our passions
[18:01] or increases one of the means to the
[18:03] word is it increases virtue
[18:05] so it's not just a list it's not just
[18:07] rules it's not just take side a
[18:09] and side b and do them this way and make
[18:12] sure the grooves are facing out
[18:14] but rather it's something that
[18:15] cultivates character and i will say this
[18:18] about ikea furniture if perfect
[18:20] character simply never made without
[18:22] suffering
[18:23] then the instructions certainly
[18:25] certainly do that
[18:27] make you suffer therefore promoting
[18:29] virtue so maybe i was right in the
[18:30] beginning or wrong in the beginning
[18:32] that's exactly what the ikea
[18:33] instructions do they promote virtue and
[18:36] increase
[18:36] character by teaching us patience
[18:42] and that there's never any leftover
[18:43] parts you've just done something wrong
[18:48] so that when it says that the word of
[18:50] god or wisdom is good for instruction it
[18:52] speaks of the whole
[18:53] training and education of a person to
[18:55] cultivate their morals and their
[18:57] thinking so it's more than just
[18:58] the word of god is good for telling
[19:00] people what to do
[19:02] which we like that like when we know
[19:04] what the word says well you know what
[19:05] the bible says right
[19:07] you know what brother branham says right
[19:08] and we love we love instructing that way
[19:11] that is not what the bible is saying
[19:13] when it says it's good for instruction
[19:15] it means whatever even the clear letter
[19:18] of the word
[19:18] is when it says thou shalt not then we
[19:21] have to
[19:21] it's knowing the application of it or
[19:24] the wisdom behind it
[19:25] in order to teach it receive it and live
[19:28] it that brings forth virtue
[19:30] and promotes character and right moral
[19:32] thinking such that if you ever really
[19:33] catch the wisdom behind an instruction
[19:36] you may find yourself in a situation
[19:38] where it may seem very very murky and
[19:40] the black and white isn't lining up just
[19:42] correct
[19:42] but you have tapped into the instruction
[19:45] of it and you have the kind of character
[19:47] that can benefit you in the murky areas
[19:50] that's what it means this instruction
[19:51] it's the whole training and the develop
[19:53] of a person's morals and their thinking
[19:55] and the word of god is good the wisdom
[19:57] of god is good for
[19:59] instruction or cultivating
[20:02] in hebrews chapter 12 verse 11 we find a
[20:05] different
[20:06] uh translation of the word instruction
[20:09] in
[20:09] second timothy it's good for instruction
[20:11] the same word is now used this way
[20:13] now no chastening so now the word
[20:16] instruction is used as chastening
[20:18] now no chastening for the present
[20:20] seemeth to be joyous
[20:21] but grievous amen nevertheless
[20:25] afterward if it's wisdom
[20:28] if the chasing has been uh it done it
[20:31] with a wisdom behind it
[20:33] and the appropriate kind of motive and
[20:34] objective even though it may not feel
[20:36] good in the moment
[20:38] real godly correction real chastening
[20:40] afterwards
[20:41] yields the peaceable fruit of
[20:43] righteousness unto them which are
[20:46] exercised thereby have you ever used
[20:48] that phrase to uh
[20:49] to your children before you chasten them
[20:51] i'm going to exercise you a little bit
[20:54] uh this is it means when you're
[20:56] exercising everybody in other words you
[20:57] have
[20:58] received chastening that those who've
[21:01] received chastening from the lord it may
[21:03] not feel really good at the moment
[21:05] but since there's real love behind it
[21:08] and wisdom behind it and a goal behind
[21:10] it
[21:10] eventually it yields peaceable fruit of
[21:13] righteousness
[21:14] so it's the same word for instruction it
[21:16] cultivates
[21:17] a character and it molds somebody and
[21:19] instills in them the right kind of
[21:21] discipline and thought process
[21:23] and chastening does that very thing to
[21:25] us
[21:26] it is done not for just the uh not for
[21:29] the purpose alone
[21:30] of letting someone know they did
[21:32] something wrong but for imparting some
[21:34] kind of virtue
[21:35] or promoting some kind of virtue it
[21:38] teaches
[21:39] ephesians chapter 6 verse 4 and ye
[21:42] fathers provoke not your children to
[21:44] wrath
[21:45] and now there's this uh
[21:50] contrast fathers provoke not your
[21:52] children to wrath
[21:53] but bring them up in the nurture and
[21:56] admonition
[21:57] of the lord provoke it means
[22:00] to bring out or to excite
[22:04] to induce to stimulate so
[22:07] parents don't stimulate anger in your
[22:10] children
[22:11] don't bring out anger in them
[22:14] and this is wonderful that the bible
[22:16] speaks to it that way
[22:18] it means it lets us know that we have
[22:21] the ability to cultivate
[22:24] and to produce frustration anger wrath
[22:27] a temper temper tantrum a fit
[22:30] we can produce that in our children
[22:33] and then we're getting the fruits of it
[22:35] and you're the seed sower and you're the
[22:37] seed water
[22:38] and now you're the harvester and you're
[22:39] the one that's eating the bread
[22:41] of your labor so the bible is apprising
[22:44] us
[22:44] of the reality that we can as parents
[22:48] bring out anger in our children or
[22:50] induce or
[22:51] stimulate frustration or anger in them
[22:53] so it says
[22:54] instead of provoking them to wrath bring
[22:57] them up in the nurture
[23:01] and admonition of the lord
[23:04] our actions our instructions our
[23:06] decisions can stimulate wrath or anger
[23:08] or frustration
[23:10] in our own children
[23:14] and it is when we see this fruit
[23:18] i want to say this in a very gracious
[23:19] way
[23:21] it may be the evidence of our own error
[23:25] and not just their rebellion
[23:28] because when you see a kid acting out
[23:29] you're like well he's stubborn and he's
[23:31] rebellious and
[23:32] he's got a mean streak in them and we
[23:34] start we start judging the child
[23:36] i mean you take a six-year-old he's just
[23:38] got an evil heart
[23:39] and uh you know he's just you know he's
[23:41] just bent on deceiving and causing
[23:43] problems
[23:45] and and that's that's what we say about
[23:47] a six or seven-year-old and we don't
[23:48] step back and say
[23:50] is this my creation have i
[23:53] sown these fruit am i making this child
[23:56] frustrated
[23:56] am i setting himself him up for failure
[23:59] and he's constantly failing and
[24:01] expressing his frustrations and his
[24:02] confusion
[24:03] and he's getting upset and we're the
[24:05] ones that are bringing it out of him
[24:07] and we're just real quick so you're
[24:08] hard-headed he's rebellious we he's our
[24:10] problem child
[24:11] that's what we say and be very very
[24:14] careful
[24:15] what you say about your children
[24:17] especially when they're listening
[24:20] because they will oftentimes just repeat
[24:23] what you've said about them
[24:24] yeah i'm the difficult one yeah i don't
[24:27] get it the first time or i'm the one
[24:28] that acts out or i'm the one that does
[24:30] this
[24:31] and we create kind of the persona that
[24:33] they feel they've got to live up to
[24:36] because we've sold those seeds with our
[24:38] words
[24:40] and so with this is us examining
[24:43] ourselves
[24:44] that maybe it's not that they are
[24:46] rebellious but that i'm
[24:47] sowing this into them and i'm bringing
[24:49] it out of them
[24:50] or maybe they may have that tendency and
[24:53] you're just pushing all the right
[24:54] buttons
[24:55] and bringing that out of them that's
[24:57] what the bible is speaking to
[24:59] is how that we can stimulate induce or
[25:02] stimulate or excite or bring out of
[25:03] children wrath
[25:04] but it says instead of doing that
[25:08] it says bring them up now in colossians
[25:10] chapter 3 verse 21
[25:12] it says fathers provoke not your
[25:14] children to anger
[25:16] lest they be discouraged now
[25:19] i i'd like to point this out that the
[25:21] bible says in each one of these places
[25:23] that children obey your parents and the
[25:24] lord as this is right
[25:26] so it gives instructions to to children
[25:28] to obey their parents
[25:30] but paul is not making that instruction
[25:32] in a vacuum
[25:34] in other words if we can have parents
[25:36] that will
[25:37] not provoke their children to anger but
[25:40] will bring them up in the right manner
[25:42] then we create a situation for our
[25:45] children to succeed
[25:47] and we're giving them the right
[25:48] opportunities to do things which are
[25:50] right and we're making ease we're making
[25:51] it
[25:51] easier on them to obey instead of making
[25:54] it harder
[25:59] pro fathers provoke not your children to
[26:01] anger unless they be
[26:02] discouraged i want to bring out the
[26:04] meaning of this word it means
[26:05] disheartened or broken in spirit
[26:08] and when one is disheartened and broken
[26:11] in spirit
[26:12] they are not motivated to act let alone
[26:15] act correctly
[26:17] and maybe we could just put in the
[26:18] simple way that they're not motivated to
[26:19] act correctly
[26:20] or they are not benefiting from the joy
[26:24] that ought to be produced in obedience
[26:27] they're not finding the satisfaction and
[26:30] the pride that a child would have
[26:32] when he does what mom or dad says he's
[26:34] when he said well you clean your room
[26:35] and they clean the room they're not
[26:37] they're not saying oh
[26:38] i i've made them proud i've done what
[26:40] they've said there's a conflict within
[26:41] their own spirit
[26:42] so it says fathers provoke not your
[26:44] children to anger in light of the fact
[26:46] that you will be giving them rules in
[26:47] light of the fact that you'll be guiding
[26:48] their hearts
[26:49] in light of the facts that you'll be the
[26:50] holy ghost to the for your children
[26:52] before they get it
[26:53] and especially in light of the fact that
[26:55] they must be obedient to the parents
[26:57] then parents be sure that what you're
[27:00] telling them to be
[27:01] obedient to does not provoke them to
[27:03] wrath
[27:05] be certain in the way that you're
[27:06] teaching them and instructing them and
[27:08] bringing them up
[27:09] that it tends to life and promotes
[27:12] blessing instead of cursing
[27:16] you can actually provoke to the wrong
[27:17] kind of emotional state of being the
[27:20] wrong kind of feelings of anger and
[27:22] frustration and depression and anxiety
[27:24] and then discourage them so that's
[27:27] that's the negative side
[27:28] fathers don't discourage your children
[27:31] but bring them up that means to nourish
[27:33] up to maturity but bring them up
[27:35] means bring out their potential
[27:38] you have been given a child a child of
[27:41] god this should be the confession of
[27:43] every single one of us
[27:44] if you have a child i don't care if
[27:45] they're 46 years old or if they're six
[27:47] months
[27:48] old that is a child of god you should
[27:50] look at all of them as being children of
[27:52] god it doesn't matter how long they've
[27:53] heard the message whether or not they've
[27:55] walked away from it
[27:56] look at your seed your progeny those
[27:58] that have been given to you and say
[27:59] this who i am beholding is the daughter
[28:01] of god this one whom i have been given
[28:03] is the son of god
[28:04] and never very from it just believe that
[28:07] that's what he has entrusted you
[28:09] in and that if someone else says well
[28:11] surely they would have believed the
[28:12] message by now say well i'm sorry
[28:15] they're still a child of god
[28:18] bring them up it means bring out their
[28:20] potential
[28:22] in other words as paul said whatever you
[28:25] do don't discourage your children he's
[28:27] saying
[28:28] never but actually instead of
[28:30] discouraging them
[28:31] encourage them this is what wisdom does
[28:34] wisdom
[28:35] does not break their spirit and make
[28:37] them useless and disheartened and
[28:39] unable to act or not motivated to act
[28:41] correctly or
[28:42] uh una you know and and actually acting
[28:45] incorrectly
[28:46] or if they do what's right they're doing
[28:48] everything they're obedient but they're
[28:49] depressed on the inside that's not
[28:51] wisdom
[28:54] bring them up in the nurture
[28:58] if i could use this word the cultivation
[29:00] of christ
[29:03] how he plants you plant how he waters
[29:06] you water
[29:07] how he prunes you prune in order to
[29:10] yield the kind of fruit that christ
[29:11] brings
[29:13] bring them up in the nurture bring them
[29:15] up in the cultivation of christ
[29:18] we want to instruct the way he has we
[29:20] want to water and nurture the way that
[29:22] he has
[29:22] we want to if necessary to prune or to
[29:24] dig around or to do the right things
[29:26] we want to do it so that we yield the
[29:28] right kind of fruit
[29:30] think about it for ourselves christ is
[29:31] our encourager
[29:34] christ is our supporter
[29:37] that's what he is he's your biggest fan
[29:40] you say i used to think that god was
[29:42] angry with me and christ loved me
[29:44] it's not god is your biggest supporter
[29:48] he he god i would say he wants you to
[29:50] succeed and that is certainly true he
[29:52] wants you to succeed but he also
[29:54] knows you're going to succeed so god
[29:56] never says anything to you that's going
[29:58] to be a detriment to you he's never
[30:00] trying to
[30:00] stop your progress he's never trying to
[30:02] turn you upside down and frustrate you
[30:04] he's your biggest fan he's your biggest
[30:05] supporter
[30:06] even when he's dissuading you he's doing
[30:09] it for your own benefit because he knows
[30:10] you can make it
[30:13] even when he is even when we're going
[30:14] through the most difficult things we
[30:16] feel that he's abandoned us
[30:18] he's sitting there saying son i would
[30:20] love to talk to you i would love to make
[30:22] my presence
[30:23] known to you but i know you've got this
[30:25] i want to teach you something about your
[30:27] fortitude
[30:28] i want to teach you something about your
[30:29] character you don't need me to hold your
[30:31] hand all the time
[30:32] you don't need me to always tell you
[30:34] what to do so i'm just kind of letting
[30:35] you on your own and you feel
[30:37] uncomfortable right now and you're
[30:38] getting out of your comfort zone but
[30:39] you're going to find out at the end of
[30:41] this that i'm with you every step of the
[30:42] way
[30:43] and that you're growing and you're
[30:44] maturing and i'm your biggest fan son
[30:46] hold on you got this
[30:48] that's how god is he never shames us
[30:52] he never makes us start second guessing
[30:57] my goodness you guys are pulling
[30:59] something out of me right now
[31:01] i i want to i want to say it
[31:04] and i want to say it with with grace god
[31:07] god is never wanting to question your ex
[31:10] get you to question your experience
[31:12] so that you would be be worse off for it
[31:15] be fearful and question your election
[31:17] and think well i gotta do this all over
[31:19] again i gotta do that all over again
[31:20] god would only make you aware of
[31:23] something lacking
[31:24] because he's given you the opportunity
[31:25] to make it firm and settle it
[31:28] not get you frustrated i guess i'm just
[31:29] a hypocrite i'm just gonna quit no no no
[31:31] you got it all wrong
[31:32] i'm just letting you know there's
[31:33] something deeper there's something
[31:35] greater there's something higher
[31:36] or you thought you had it you didn't get
[31:38] it son here's the handoff take it
[31:40] you didn't get it the first time and god
[31:43] he is
[31:44] he is encourager he he supports you
[31:47] he wants he knows you're going to
[31:48] succeed
[31:51] and even when we feel that we're being
[31:52] corrected he's doing it for your good
[31:55] never for your for your loss paul writes
[31:58] this in first thessalonians chapter 2
[32:00] verse 11.
[32:01] and i i'd like to make this comment
[32:04] there is so much more
[32:06] in this vein and in this channel
[32:09] that are just i'm not even scratching
[32:11] the surface
[32:12] so if you want to in your own in your
[32:15] own
[32:15] prayer life or even in your own study of
[32:18] scripture
[32:19] just take this thought of god the
[32:20] encourager christ the encourager paul
[32:22] the encourager
[32:24] and how a father praises his children
[32:26] and you'll find the bible
[32:28] is so consistent from beginning to end
[32:31] with this
[32:32] paul second thessalonians chapter 2
[32:34] verse 11 and says as you know how
[32:36] and i know it may seem a little bit
[32:37] disjointed because it's out of context
[32:39] but i just want to focus on his
[32:40] character
[32:41] his demeanor his behavior as you know
[32:43] how we exhorted and comforted and
[32:46] charged every one of you as a father
[32:49] doth his children
[32:51] paul the messenger to the age says that
[32:53] we have exhorted
[32:54] we have comforted we have charged every
[32:57] single one of you
[32:58] as a father does his children we didn't
[33:00] have favorites
[33:02] we didn't leave anybody out we we didn't
[33:05] create a caste system where there were
[33:06] some that had certain benefits and
[33:08] privileges and access to wisdom
[33:09] and others didn't and felt like they
[33:11] were orphans but rather we have exhorted
[33:13] comforted and charged all of you as a
[33:16] father does his children
[33:18] we have exhorted that means to console
[33:20] to encourage and strengthen by
[33:22] consolation
[33:23] to encourage and strengthen by or to
[33:25] comfort
[33:27] we have encouraged you strengthened you
[33:30] we have comforted you and then he says
[33:31] and comforted but then the word is
[33:33] a little bit more deep it means to use
[33:35] words or to be alongside of speaking
[33:39] to use words if you could just imagine
[33:41] it means i put my arm around you
[33:44] and i've been there encouraging it
[33:45] you've got this and you're going to
[33:47] overcome and listen when you come into
[33:48] this situation
[33:50] be watching out for these certain things
[33:51] and you're going to be able to do this
[33:53] and this is what the scripture's
[33:54] painting this picture of of one who is
[33:56] alongside of
[33:57] speaking and using words to calm to
[34:00] encourage to console
[34:02] to comfort it means to address someone
[34:04] whether by way of admonition or
[34:06] incentive
[34:06] in order in other words to encourage or
[34:09] to console we have exhorted you
[34:10] we have comforted you each one speaks of
[34:12] encouraging encouragement being
[34:14] alongside
[34:15] speaking to you go go you can do this no
[34:18] you're able to do it don't doubt
[34:19] yourself
[34:20] just stay with what i promised
[34:24] charged it means to utter honorable
[34:26] testimony
[34:27] we have charged every one of you we have
[34:29] given a good report in other words we've
[34:31] praised you
[34:32] we've lifted you up we've built you up
[34:36] let me say it this way wisdom cultivates
[34:40] the belief in a person that they can do
[34:42] it
[34:46] when an instruction is given in wisdom
[34:49] something's going to be imparted with
[34:51] the instruction
[34:52] that lets the here know that they are
[34:56] they have authority to do it and power
[34:58] to do it
[35:01] that you're not asking them to do
[35:02] something that they
[35:04] are not that you're not confident that
[35:06] they can do
[35:09] think about how frustrating that is when
[35:12] we get an
[35:12] instruction or we're asked to do
[35:13] something like i can't do this there's
[35:15] no way in the world
[35:16] i can do this but god would not ask us
[35:18] to do something wisdom does not
[35:21] give some a requirement
[35:24] without ultimately instilling in the
[35:27] person i can do this wisdom instills
[35:30] greatness it gives
[35:32] grants courage it builds somebody up
[35:35] as you know how we exhorted and
[35:36] comforted and charged
[35:38] as a father does his children so paul
[35:41] says in philippians chapter 4 verses 12
[35:43] and 13.
[35:45] i know how excuse me i know both how to
[35:48] be a based and i know how to abound
[35:52] everywhere and in all things i am
[35:54] instructed both to be full and to be
[35:56] hungry both to abound
[35:58] and to suffer need quite a contrast in
[36:00] abounding and suffering
[36:01] to be full and to be hungry to be a base
[36:04] and to abound he's bringing up these
[36:06] contrasts and this is what paul is
[36:07] referring to when he says
[36:09] i can do all things through christ with
[36:11] strengthen of me
[36:13] we use that phrase all the time and
[36:15] we're usually using it in the thought i
[36:16] can
[36:17] jump leap over a wall i can run through
[36:19] a troop i can leap over a wall i can
[36:21] tunnel through a mountain i can fly over
[36:23] it and we think
[36:24] we only think of these supernatural
[36:26] things i can do all things through
[36:28] christ which strengtheneth me
[36:29] and that means you would know how to be
[36:31] happy when you're hungry
[36:33] and when you're full it means you you
[36:35] can you know how to be a base
[36:37] and to be abound when he says i can do
[36:39] all things through christ
[36:41] it doesn't just mean that i know how to
[36:43] succeed wonderfully but it shows
[36:45] i know how to conduct myself in
[36:47] adversity i know how to keep my head up
[36:49] through
[36:49] the the lack of things when i'm wanting
[36:52] i know that i can make it
[36:54] through christ which strengthens me so
[36:56] it speaks to the sufficiency of christ
[36:59] but i want you to notice that paul is
[37:01] saying hey whether i'm abounding or
[37:03] whether i'm a base whether i'm full or
[37:05] whether i'm hungry whether i'm suffering
[37:07] in a need or whether i'm abounding he's
[37:09] saying that i
[37:10] can make it i've got this i can do all
[37:13] things through christ which
[37:15] strengtheneth me
[37:17] he strengthens me he's the strength
[37:19] giver he's my supporter
[37:20] paul is coming from a place of
[37:22] confidence which has been cultivated by
[37:24] christ
[37:25] paul could not have said this if he
[37:27] wasn't trusting christ
[37:29] paul could not have said this is like
[37:30] well i remember that one time he told me
[37:32] to do this and it didn't work
[37:33] out so paul had this absolute trust he
[37:38] just knew
[37:39] that this is gonna work out and even to
[37:41] where he's like hey stay on the boat
[37:42] this is the only way you're gonna make
[37:44] it he just knew
[37:45] he could trust him and so when paul
[37:47] speaks this he's coming from a place
[37:50] that christ has cultivated within his
[37:52] spirit
[37:53] i can do all things through christ with
[37:55] strengthen me this means that his
[37:56] heavenly father
[37:58] had brought paul to such a place of rest
[38:01] that he could believe he could do it
[38:04] whatever he was asked i can do all
[38:06] things through christ which
[38:07] strengtheneth me
[38:08] this means as christ who has given us
[38:11] the model behavior
[38:12] or given us these instructions that
[38:13] we're ought to pursue christ
[38:15] is as we're to raise our children in the
[38:17] nurture and admonition of the lord
[38:19] this is the cultivation of christ where
[38:22] we can be producing
[38:23] confidence in one another strength and
[38:25] sureness and security
[38:27] and we do this by promoting the right
[38:28] kind of things
[38:31] first timothy chapter 1 verse 12 and i
[38:33] thank christ jesus our lord
[38:36] who hath enabled me
[38:39] too often i think we use the word
[38:41] enabler in the negative context where
[38:43] you're just enabling them you're just
[38:45] enabling them you're just enabling them
[38:46] well okay we realize that there's a dark
[38:48] side of enabling
[38:50] but paul is saying my god christ jesus
[38:53] our lord has
[38:55] it's the same word strengthened but i
[38:57] love the way that it's translated he has
[38:58] enabled me
[38:59] he has made me able
[39:03] he's loosed me he's given me liberty
[39:04] he's given me confidence he's
[39:06] he's given me this courage to believe
[39:08] he's asked me to do it you know
[39:10] by golly i can do it i've got
[39:13] i can handle this i can take what's
[39:15] coming my way and i can and i can make
[39:17] it through this
[39:17] oh thank christ jesus our lord who hath
[39:20] enabled me and i love this for that he
[39:23] have counted me faithful
[39:27] this is in the enabling he has enabled
[39:30] me
[39:31] counted me faithful where are we putting
[39:33] that in in her own works no in the fact
[39:34] that he's enabled me
[39:36] putting me oh this is so beautiful paul
[39:38] as a minister of the gospel says
[39:40] he's enabled me in that in that he
[39:43] counted me faithful putting me
[39:45] into the ministry i have been called and
[39:48] nurtured
[39:48] and i have been encouraged by christ
[39:52] not that he just gifted me and said well
[39:53] let's see how you handle this bub
[39:56] but he has enabled him he has counted
[39:58] him he has put me
[39:59] he's the one that's over he is the one
[40:01] that's looked out after this
[40:04] this is the cultivation of christ
[40:07] this is what wisdom looks like
[40:13] this is the nature and the
[40:14] characteristic of christ
[40:16] so in revelations chapter 2 we're going
[40:18] to read
[40:19] from verses 1 to 6
[40:22] don't everyone turn in your bibles at
[40:23] one time the sound is just
[40:26] deafening i don't do
[40:29] do people turn in their bibles anymore
[40:33] and no one wants to answer and
[40:36] people just start doing this real quick
[40:40] i'm not angry it's okay no you don't
[40:41] have to turn your bibles i put it up
[40:42] there for a reason
[40:44] revelations chapter two now follow this
[40:48] we're going to read to verse six unto
[40:50] the angel of the church of ephesus
[40:52] right these things sayeth he
[40:56] that holdeth the seven stars in his
[40:58] right hand how is he characterized he's
[41:00] characterized as the almighty
[41:01] he is the faithful there's different
[41:03] ways that he is referred to in the
[41:05] scripture
[41:06] under the angel the church of ephesus
[41:08] right these things saith he
[41:10] that holdeth the seven stars in his
[41:12] right hand who walketh in the midst of
[41:14] the seven golden candlesticks
[41:16] this is christ we know in the midst of
[41:19] his church
[41:20] he is now something is being written to
[41:22] the angel of that church
[41:24] and i want you to notice how brother
[41:26] brown i haven't put these statements on
[41:28] a slide so we're just going to read
[41:29] through them very quickly
[41:31] this is christ in the midst of his
[41:33] church and in light of the fact that we
[41:35] are told as parents to
[41:36] to raise our children to bring them up
[41:38] in the cultivation of christ
[41:40] and that paul says that he hath enabled
[41:42] me and he strengthened me and i have
[41:44] exhorted and comforted and charged you
[41:46] as a father does his children this
[41:48] scripture gives us some essential
[41:50] characteristics and attributes
[41:52] of how that christ what he's actually
[41:54] doing in the midst of the church
[41:56] he's not in the midst of the church as
[41:58] an auditor hmm let's see here
[42:01] who's messing up who's not doing well
[42:04] but brother man says the only light they
[42:05] have this is the church is his light
[42:07] even the messengers
[42:08] how dark it is how spiritually cold yet
[42:11] when he
[42:12] comes into the midst it is light and
[42:14] warm
[42:15] and the church is empowered and through
[42:18] him does the works that he did
[42:20] so he is in the midst of the church as
[42:22] the empowerer
[42:24] he's empowering this is what the
[42:25] presence of christ does he empowers he
[42:27] is the
[42:28] uh we have the branches he is the vine
[42:30] the vine furnishes energy to the
[42:32] branches to be fruitful
[42:35] it's he is not we are not the branches
[42:37] and he's the vine so that we live our
[42:38] whole lives going
[42:41] right looking over our shoulders is he
[42:44] going to cut me off
[42:45] but no he furnishes energy to the
[42:48] branches
[42:49] the church is empowered he says later
[42:51] and not only in their midst as a
[42:52] complacent onlooker
[42:54] or as a recording angel so he's not in
[42:57] the midst just kind of looking down with
[42:59] the furrowed brow like oh what are these
[43:00] guys doing these
[43:01] these knuckleheads they need to get
[43:02] their act together he's not just a
[43:04] recording angel oh wow
[43:06] you're going to hear about this later he
[43:08] says but there he stands
[43:10] expressing exactly what he is the life
[43:13] and sustainer and giver of all good
[43:16] gifts to the church
[43:17] he's not only your life but he's a
[43:19] sustainer and he's a giver god is a
[43:21] giver
[43:22] a sustainer he's an empowerer he's a
[43:24] sustainer
[43:25] he's a giver of good gifts this is what
[43:26] he is in the midst as he walks
[43:28] in the midst of the seven golden
[43:30] candlesticks these are characteristics
[43:32] and attributes of christ
[43:33] whom we are modeling his behavior he's
[43:35] an empowerer he's a sustainer he's a
[43:37] giver
[43:38] bill graham says but with him in her
[43:40] midst with him in her midst
[43:43] with him motivating her
[43:47] she becomes to the wonderment of all his
[43:49] body
[43:50] the fullness of him that filleth all
[43:54] in all and it thundered when he spoke
[44:00] but with him in the midst and with him
[44:04] motivating her
[44:05] she becomes the wonderment of all his
[44:07] body the fullness of him
[44:09] that filleth all in all
[44:19] testing one two we good all right see
[44:22] devil you can't stop this if it's not
[44:25] the devil if it's just
[44:27] sennheiser or countryman or whatever it
[44:29] is what whatever equipment we're sure
[44:30] wait
[44:31] we're we're not taking sides here in
[44:33] this
[44:34] don't want to offend anybody but we go
[44:36] forward
[44:38] this is what christ is he's the
[44:39] empowerer he's the sustainer he's the
[44:41] giver
[44:42] with him in her midst motivating her
[44:45] he's a motivator we all know what it's
[44:48] like to not be motivated
[44:50] and the worst is when you have zero
[44:52] motivation and you don't know why
[44:56] that's really what depression is as you
[44:58] get zero motivation zero ambition and
[45:00] you can't figure out why you just feel
[45:02] broken you feel unable but christ
[45:04] is a motivator he empowers he sustains
[45:07] he gives he motivates he doesn't
[45:09] he doesn't break our spirits where we
[45:10] feel unable and we feel discouraged and
[45:13] man this message just seems so hard to
[45:15] live and my goodness how am i ever gonna
[45:17] make it
[45:18] there's just something about the word no
[45:19] matter how high it's preached
[45:21] when it's him you're like i can do it
[45:25] i know i know i can do it i don't know
[45:27] how and i don't know when
[45:29] but i know somehow we're gonna make it
[45:32] did you hear that the preacher was
[45:34] preaching that the mark of this age is
[45:36] perfection
[45:37] and i know i'm not perfect but somehow
[45:39] someway
[45:40] i know that christ is gonna enable me to
[45:43] meet the mark
[45:45] not walking away and say well i just
[45:47] must not be good enough and i must need
[45:48] to get baptized again or
[45:50] maybe i don't have the holy ghost or
[45:51] maybe i'm not elect maybe i'm just
[45:53] foolish virgin
[45:54] and listen there's ministries and
[45:55] there's relationships and there's people
[45:58] that'll work very very hard to make you
[46:00] feel broken
[46:02] and that they're the only ones that can
[46:04] fix you
[46:06] so that you always stay real needy at
[46:07] their side
[46:09] and you're always subject to their
[46:10] ministry
[46:12] listen the the statement that the bride
[46:15] is the sickest body
[46:17] that he knew of was right then
[46:20] but she's begun to be risen she's risen
[46:23] the vitamins have been poured into the
[46:25] church you you can make it you're strong
[46:28] enough uh this isn't a peptide you're
[46:30] smart enough
[46:31] you're good you're gonna make it no this
[46:32] is just the reality of it god has built
[46:34] you to win
[46:38] motivating you not discouraging you
[46:42] don't you hate it when you come to
[46:44] church and you know you're actually
[46:45] excited to come to church
[46:47] and you just drag yourself away thinking
[46:49] well i guess i'm just no good and
[46:51] just been beat up and bullied that's not
[46:54] christ
[46:57] so he says in verse 2 i know thy works
[46:59] and thy labor and thy patience and how
[47:01] thou canst not bear them
[47:03] which are evil and thou hast tried them
[47:05] which say they are apostles and are not
[47:07] and has found them liars
[47:08] and that's born and has patience and for
[47:10] my name's sake has labored and has not
[47:12] fainted
[47:14] what's amazing is christ the empowered
[47:17] the sustainer giver the motivator the
[47:19] life
[47:20] says i know your works
[47:23] i it's not even listen you're nothing
[47:25] without me okay
[47:27] the only reason why you even have an
[47:28] ounce to be able to bear those that are
[47:30] evil
[47:31] or can't bear them they even the only
[47:32] way that you've tried the apostles is
[47:34] because i'm in you doing all this to
[47:35] begin with
[47:36] so don't you for a minute begin to brag
[47:38] this is the motivator
[47:39] this is the sustainer this is the giver
[47:41] this is the empower saying
[47:42] i know your works and your labor and
[47:44] your patience
[47:47] how you can't bear them which are evil
[47:48] you've tried them which say they're
[47:49] apostles
[47:50] and they're not and you've found you
[47:52] found them to be liars
[47:54] and you've borne you've borne you've had
[47:56] patience from my name you've labored you
[47:58] haven't fainted
[48:00] this is christ giving praise to the
[48:02] believer
[48:03] this is not him saying you're nothing
[48:05] without me
[48:06] this is not him leading with their sins
[48:08] and his complaint
[48:09] but this he's building them up
[48:12] he's beginning by affirming his love
[48:14] he's showing them that he's committed
[48:16] he's actually this is the source of
[48:18] their motivation wow you've done
[48:19] wonderful you're doing great you've
[48:21] borne this you've borne that
[48:22] this is christ praising his own this is
[48:25] demonstrating to us
[48:26] a good example
[48:30] brother branham tells a story in a
[48:31] couple places where he says one night i
[48:33] was going
[48:34] out of the church and someone said oh
[48:35] brother branham i sure appreciated that
[48:37] sermon
[48:38] and i said thank you and somebody's
[48:41] standing at the door minister he said
[48:42] this is some time ago minister said
[48:44] well bless god i don't want nobody
[48:46] telling me that
[48:48] i wonder if he just never heard that
[48:51] right so he's like well i don't need it
[48:52] you know he's just because he doesn't
[48:53] ever hear it
[48:54] he says well bless god i don't want
[48:56] nobody to tell me that that's certainly
[48:57] not gentleness
[49:00] wouldn't he say yeah you know what
[49:01] brother random i enjoyed that too that
[49:02] was really good
[49:04] he said i want all the glory to go to
[49:06] god
[49:09] so someone says brother branham i sure
[49:10] appreciated that sermon this other
[49:12] mister well bless god
[49:13] i don't want nobody telling me that i
[49:14] want all the glory to god glory to go to
[49:16] god brother man says well it does
[49:19] and while i like it myself i really like
[49:22] it
[49:25] amen
[49:28] and he said i have to be truthful and he
[49:30] said well i don't like for people to say
[49:32] that about me bless god
[49:35] and i said there's just one difference
[49:36] between me and you i'm honest about it
[49:38] and you're not
[49:43] so think about that this is this is the
[49:46] context for what he's about to say
[49:48] if you take a little child brag on him a
[49:52] little
[49:52] he'll do a better job
[49:55] if they're not doing a good job making
[49:57] their bed instead of saying you call
[49:59] that maid
[50:00] they're teaching monkeys to read and you
[50:02] can't even make your bed
[50:09] i'll never forget the first time i ever
[50:10] heard that i was really funny
[50:14] and it wasn't my dad telling me that if
[50:15] some of you are thinking that
[50:18] but that doesn't motivate the kid to get
[50:20] out of bed the next morning
[50:21] and make the bed right he said why don't
[50:24] you just have a monkey do it
[50:27] because you kind of cultivated this
[50:28] attitude you're horrible you can't do it
[50:30] he says all you've got to do is take a
[50:32] little child brag on him a little
[50:33] he'll do a better job that's right and
[50:36] god always he likes to tell his children
[50:41] when he does right you like to tell them
[50:45] when they're doing wrong
[50:46] so why not tell them when they're doing
[50:48] right wisdom
[50:51] this is wisdom we're always very quick
[50:54] to point out when things are not done
[50:56] right and how things are not done well
[50:58] and where things are short and where
[50:59] things aren't good and you don't do this
[51:01] and you don't do that and i asked you to
[51:03] do this and you didn't do that and i
[51:04] asked you this and didn't do that
[51:05] and the wisdom is that you can actually
[51:07] get the right result
[51:09] not by telling them that they're doing
[51:10] it wrong but maybe humbling yourself to
[51:13] say
[51:13] that is so good you tried so hard
[51:17] try it again or tomorrow when you do it
[51:21] just do it this
[51:22] way and this is something that's you're
[51:23] empowering you're sustaining you're
[51:25] motivating
[51:26] with you as a motivator things can get
[51:29] done
[51:30] he likes to tell his children god always
[51:32] likes to tell his children
[51:34] when they do right he always does
[51:37] and if we are in the mode in the habit
[51:39] of telling people
[51:40] when they do wrong why not tell them
[51:43] when they're doing right
[51:46] brother brown says in the message
[51:47] jehovah jireh daddy used to make me work
[51:49] twice
[51:50] as hard as i would done
[51:54] because he told me i was doing a good
[51:57] job
[51:59] how did his dad motivate him to work
[52:02] twice as hard
[52:04] not by telling him he was soft not by
[52:06] telling him he was lazy
[52:08] not by telling him he was no good and he
[52:10] can't get it through his thick head
[52:12] what he told him is you're doing a good
[52:14] job
[52:16] and he'd be motivated to work twice as
[52:18] hard
[52:19] so we all like that that's what he says
[52:23] so we all like that we like to be told
[52:26] and then i do appreciate good friendly
[52:28] criticism
[52:30] when someone says now you made a mistake
[52:34] there you did something then i know i'll
[52:36] try to straighten that up
[52:38] i always admire criticism don't you
[52:42] come on now you believe the message
[52:47] huh you believe him to be a prophet
[52:51] i always admire criticism don't you
[52:55] next slide when it's in the right
[53:00] that's when we admire it when it's in
[53:02] the right
[53:03] spirit when it's in the right motive and
[53:05] objective when it's in the right from
[53:07] above
[53:07] we actually enjoy the criticism when
[53:09] someone's like hey
[53:11] hey there's a better way you're doing a
[53:13] great job but
[53:14] did you notice you're not quite getting
[53:16] it done right we appreciate that
[53:18] when you make a mistake you did you made
[53:20] a mistake there you did something
[53:22] then i know i'll try to straighten up i
[53:23] always admire criticism when it's in the
[53:25] right don't you yes when it's in the
[53:26] right
[53:27] see if you're doing something wrong you
[53:29] don't wish to be that way someone said
[53:30] well i would have told you but i
[53:32] well sure if you're my brother you
[53:34] should tell me i want to know it
[53:38] don't you like it when people say listen
[53:40] if i'm doing something wrong you can
[53:41] just come tell
[53:42] me what you don't think i can hear it
[53:45] huh you don't trust me you don't think
[53:48] i'm gifted
[53:49] you're like no absolutely i can't wait
[53:51] to ask your advice
[53:54] and brother branham means that he's
[53:56] saying hey if if i'm your brother you
[53:57] should tell me i want to know it
[53:59] brother ben i'm always in the right kind
[54:01] of spirit solicited constructive
[54:02] criticism
[54:04] he said listen tell me if i'm your
[54:06] brother if i do something wrong you're
[54:07] obligated to come tell me
[54:09] he even said about his trustees he says
[54:11] i don't want a bunch of yes men on my
[54:13] board
[54:13] i've got you there because i know that
[54:15] if you disagree with me you'll tell me
[54:17] that's why you're there they're not
[54:20] there to be bobble heads
[54:24] yes on everything that they said and
[54:25] everything that's done no i want to know
[54:27] is this right is this good how do you
[54:29] feel solicit from the people
[54:31] whether or not this is tending to
[54:32] righteousness tending right i always
[54:34] admire criticism when it's right
[54:35] i want to come back to what he's saying
[54:37] if you're my brother you'll tell me and
[54:39] he's saying the right kind of approach
[54:41] will promote the right kind of result
[54:43] because i would work
[54:44] twice as hard when my daddy said i was
[54:47] doing a good job
[54:52] is what christ does
[54:55] christ says i know your works you're
[54:57] doing a good job
[54:59] i know your labor your patience you
[55:00] can't bear them that are evil you've
[55:02] actually tried apostles
[55:04] and you discovered that they weren't
[55:05] apostles you've labored you've been
[55:08] patient you've been heavy laden
[55:09] for my name's sake you have labored and
[55:11] you have not
[55:12] fainted you were doing good
[55:16] what did he do he affirmed his pleasure
[55:17] in them he praised them he exhorted them
[55:20] he comforted them
[55:21] he was in the midst of them with his arm
[55:22] around him lifting up these virtues
[55:24] what is it this is wisdom how that you
[55:27] could take someone and brag on them a
[55:28] little and they'll do a better job
[55:31] he likes to tell his children when
[55:33] they've done right you'll work twice as
[55:34] hard
[55:35] because you're told you're doing a good
[55:36] job we like to be told we like
[55:38] people who who not only share criticism
[55:40] but people who can praise us too
[55:44] and then verse four nevertheless i have
[55:47] somewhat against thee
[55:50] let me just point this out he doesn't
[55:51] lead with this
[55:55] they wouldn't even be in the right frame
[55:56] of my mind to really get
[55:59] the praising and the compliments you're
[56:01] really doing horrible i mean you're like
[56:03] on the verge of becoming
[56:04] antichrist but great good job by the way
[56:09] it just there was this is the wisdom of
[56:12] christ the cultivation of christ
[56:13] to affirm his love first his commitment
[56:15] to lift them up and praise them and
[56:17] exhort them and comfort them
[56:19] and then once they're in this position
[56:20] of confidence
[56:22] that he's still interested he's still
[56:24] mindful he's still instructing this is
[56:26] her sometimes
[56:26] insecurities are bred and the way that
[56:28] we address situations or confront
[56:30] problems
[56:31] is the person's afraid that this is a
[56:33] deal breaker
[56:34] does this mean things have changed and
[56:36] and nothing's going to be the same again
[56:38] and things are turned upside down
[56:39] i need to know first that we're do we're
[56:41] engaged in this exercise
[56:43] because you still believe in me like
[56:46] about come in the office and be like oh
[56:48] no what's going on
[56:49] like and you want to you want to know
[56:51] first hey look you're doing a great job
[56:53] we're going to give you a raise and and
[56:55] we want to keep you on we want to extend
[56:56] your contract but
[56:58] going forward we need you to do this
[56:59] that and the other if you led with you
[57:01] know what
[57:01] um you need to do this you need to do
[57:03] that you need to do this you need to do
[57:04] that puts that person in a state of
[57:05] well am i out of here are they done with
[57:07] me are they upset with me
[57:10] so now he says nevertheless i have
[57:12] somewhat against thee this is on the
[57:14] backdrop of
[57:16] the praising of verse verses two and
[57:18] three
[57:19] because thou has left thy first love so
[57:21] this is some very heavy criticism
[57:23] remember therefore so this is his
[57:25] complaint
[57:27] you've left your first love so he
[57:29] doesn't just say
[57:31] he just drop the mic and leave and say
[57:33] that'll burn
[57:35] he follows it up with remember therefore
[57:38] from where you've fallen and repent
[57:41] and do the first works he's telling them
[57:44] a way back
[57:46] this is the wisdom of it you're doing
[57:48] great you've done this you've done that
[57:49] these things have all done well
[57:50] but there's just one little problem
[57:51] you've left your first love and then he
[57:53] says now
[57:54] all you need to do is repent remember
[57:55] your first works or else i'll come unto
[57:57] thee quickly and now he's saying hey
[57:59] there's a consequence for not doing it
[58:00] these are all
[58:01] parts and elements of the cultivation of
[58:03] christ and i will remove thy candlestick
[58:05] out of his place
[58:06] except thou repent so there's a call to
[58:08] action there's a consequence if you
[58:09] don't follow it
[58:10] but it's not arising in a vacuum
[58:13] it's not just a dm that says hey you are
[58:15] messing up buddy and there's
[58:16] consequences for it
[58:18] it's look you're doing a good job this
[58:20] is an area you can improve if you don't
[58:21] improve these are the consequences
[58:24] and then he follows it right back up
[58:25] with but this thou hast
[58:27] another attaboy another another
[58:29] confirmation another affirmation that
[58:30] thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitans
[58:32] which i also hate
[58:34] he ends it with another affirmation
[58:37] is this wisdom
[58:41] some of us thinking man i wish this is
[58:42] the way i was treated my whole life
[58:45] and this is exactly how that we ought to
[58:47] treat others
[58:49] this paradigm where it's not jealousy
[58:51] and we're not embittered and we're not
[58:52] mad and we're not trying to shame and
[58:54] we're not trying to
[58:55] uh you know we're not using the wrong
[58:56] kind of motivators to get the response
[58:59] this is how christ deals with the church
[59:01] knowing where it's going to end up this
[59:02] is how he addresses the situation
[59:05] through praise through accolades
[59:09] through encouragement through addressing
[59:11] the problem
[59:12] giving a solution the consequence if
[59:16] they don't
[59:18] and then saying you're doing good
[59:21] this is another thing i like reaffirming
[59:23] it in wisdom the rebuke come
[59:26] came after the affirmation
[59:29] therefore the rebuke of the correction
[59:31] builds up it doesn't tear down
[59:34] because they've already put them they've
[59:35] already put them in the frame of mind
[59:37] that they can trust that this is a
[59:38] trusting relation this is love
[59:40] that that there's an effort being made
[59:41] to provo promote the relationship
[59:43] there's an interest in how i'm behaving
[59:45] there's a desire to see the kind of
[59:46] correct behavior this just isn't going
[59:48] to shame me or make me feel bad for not
[59:49] meeting the mark
[59:50] but there's it's with this backdrop of
[59:52] all this affirmation
[59:54] that he corrects and gives a very stern
[59:56] rebuke and then says hey if this doesn't
[59:58] happen
[59:58] then this is the consequence for it
[1:00:00] therefore the very stern
[1:00:02] very stern rebuke promotes the right
[1:00:05] kind of virtue and doesn't just take
[1:00:07] away and make bear
[1:00:09] it actually builds up
[1:00:13] brother of adam says this as my closing
[1:00:16] my closing statement in referring
[1:00:20] specifically to these verses how
[1:00:22] beautifully the savior praises
[1:00:24] and commends his children
[1:00:28] he takes full account of their fine
[1:00:30] spiritual attitudes and behavior
[1:00:33] he knows that there's weakness among
[1:00:34] them but as yet he does not cry out
[1:00:37] against it
[1:00:39] isn't that just like the lord
[1:00:42] he knows there's weakness he knows
[1:00:45] things aren't doing
[1:00:46] aren't being done right he knows there's
[1:00:49] room for improvement he knows there's
[1:00:50] actually
[1:00:51] pretty terrible disobedience he knows
[1:00:52] that this first step away is the
[1:00:54] the effect of the antichrist but brother
[1:00:56] i'm saying he knows there's weakness he
[1:00:58] knows their sin he knows there's
[1:00:59] compromise
[1:01:00] but he doesn't lead with it he doesn't
[1:01:03] confront it right out coming against it
[1:01:04] and he says isn't that just like our
[1:01:06] lord in other words the nature of christ
[1:01:08] isn't to come with sleeves rolled up and
[1:01:11] and a whip
[1:01:12] and a whatever else you say i'm going to
[1:01:14] get in your face and i'm going to tell
[1:01:15] you you're doing things wrong
[1:01:16] said that's not the nature of christ
[1:01:18] isn't that just like our lord
[1:01:19] when we've left our first love he
[1:01:22] affirms our love to us to make it easier
[1:01:24] to come back to it
[1:01:30] how many times have the efforts
[1:01:34] to kind of bring us back only push us
[1:01:36] further away
[1:01:38] because we weren't sure we were being
[1:01:40] invited to what we wanted to begin with
[1:01:44] how beautifully the savior praises and
[1:01:45] commends his children taking full
[1:01:47] account of their
[1:01:48] fine spiritual attitudes and behaviors
[1:01:49] before he rebukes and before he corrects
[1:01:51] him he gives him this praise
[1:01:53] isn't that just like our lord and then
[1:01:54] he says he knows how to encourage us
[1:01:57] in the right matters and discourage us
[1:01:59] in the wrong manners
[1:02:02] pay very close attention it doesn't mean
[1:02:04] on one hand he knows how
[1:02:06] to encourage us and on another hand he
[1:02:07] knows how to discourage us no
[1:02:09] there is no discouragement in christ
[1:02:11] there is only christ discouraging us
[1:02:13] from acting wrong
[1:02:16] he knows how to encourage us he does
[1:02:19] encourage us in the right matters he
[1:02:21] does discourage us from doing the wrong
[1:02:24] things is exactly what's expressed
[1:02:26] in revelations chapter 2 verses 1 to 6
[1:02:28] is christ
[1:02:29] encouraging us to keep doing things
[1:02:30] right and then discouraging us from
[1:02:32] doing the things that
[1:02:33] we're doing wrong and through that even
[1:02:35] though there's correction there's no
[1:02:37] discouragement
[1:02:40] that proceeds from it not only does he
[1:02:43] know how but he does encourage us
[1:02:45] he does discourage us just to use the
[1:02:47] words that i
[1:02:48] place in the beginning this is
[1:02:50] cultivating
[1:02:52] he's the encourager
[1:02:56] he's the one that is alongside of us
[1:02:59] using words
[1:03:00] to bring out of us the gold that's in us
[1:03:05] to bring out of us his nature and his
[1:03:08] life
[1:03:09] i know what's on the inside of you i
[1:03:12] know it's in there
[1:03:13] i know how to get it out and then in
[1:03:16] that context he says now whatever you do
[1:03:18] don't do this
[1:03:20] that's not trying to break your heart
[1:03:22] that's strengthening your heart
[1:03:25] that's not breaking your spirit that's
[1:03:26] perfecting your spirit
[1:03:28] and then he says we could all learn
[1:03:30] notice he says we could all
[1:03:32] learn a good lesson right here
[1:03:35] in it running the church and our
[1:03:37] families
[1:03:40] i really feel that this this is so
[1:03:41] important that if you don't
[1:03:43] if you're not able to write it down i'll
[1:03:45] email it to you
[1:03:46] i want you to read this i want you to
[1:03:48] see this i want you to know that this is
[1:03:50] what it says we can email you the slide
[1:03:51] deck
[1:03:52] he knows how to encourage us in the
[1:03:53] right matters how to discourage us in
[1:03:55] the wrong matters
[1:03:56] this wisdom is how what we can use
[1:03:59] in running the church and running our
[1:04:02] families
[1:04:07] listen and he says better still we could
[1:04:09] all learn a good lesson
[1:04:10] in that god deals with each one of us in
[1:04:13] exactly this way
[1:04:15] this is how he deals with each one of us
[1:04:16] as an encourager
[1:04:18] as a motivator as a sustainer as a giver
[1:04:21] as a champion he's your champion
[1:04:24] he's in your corner he's praising you oh
[1:04:27] no
[1:04:27] no don't do that that's not gonna work
[1:04:29] that's that's instructive that's
[1:04:31] that's corrective yes it is but this is
[1:04:33] coming from a heart that loves you and
[1:04:35] wants to see you do well this is where
[1:04:37] brother says we admire criticism when
[1:04:39] it's in the right
[1:04:40] christ gives the right kind of criticism
[1:04:43] because it's promoting the right kind of
[1:04:44] virtues so we are in the
[1:04:46] we want to emphasize this to you as
[1:04:48] individual sons and daughters of god
[1:04:50] that this is a lesson that we ought to
[1:04:52] learn that god deals with us by
[1:04:53] encouraging us
[1:04:55] to do the right things and then
[1:04:56] discouraging us from the wrong things
[1:04:59] that's wisdom that brings out the right
[1:05:01] kind of fruit
[1:05:04] that's what wisdom does it's cultivating
[1:05:09] he says we could all learn a good lesson
[1:05:11] right here in how we run the church
[1:05:12] and how we run our families let me say
[1:05:16] this just as i speak from my heart
[1:05:19] you who are seeking answers you will
[1:05:22] find them
[1:05:24] you'll find them and we're here to
[1:05:27] support you
[1:05:28] and encourage you and give you the
[1:05:30] resources and the confidence
[1:05:32] to find them not just give you all the
[1:05:35] answers
[1:05:38] because you'll find him why you're his
[1:05:40] son
[1:05:41] you're his daughter you've been given a
[1:05:43] responsibility
[1:05:44] you'll find the answers that you need
[1:05:47] don't despair they'll come in time
[1:05:49] we're here as a body of christ we each
[1:05:51] one of us are here not to give everybody
[1:05:53] the answers
[1:05:54] but to help them find them we're not
[1:05:56] here to give you a list of rules of do's
[1:05:58] and don'ts that we think if you just do
[1:06:00] these you'll
[1:06:00] you'll come out right on the other side
[1:06:02] there's certain things that are very
[1:06:03] clear
[1:06:04] prescriptions in the word of god that we
[1:06:06] teach that we preach
[1:06:08] but we're all aware as we're maturing
[1:06:09] believers that there's areas in life
[1:06:11] where we seek the wisdom of god we want
[1:06:14] an answer we want to know what to do
[1:06:15] right i'm telling you
[1:06:16] you'll find it these things i'm sharing
[1:06:18] are things that you can use to find them
[1:06:23] you can utilize them all the days of
[1:06:24] your life
[1:06:26] and this is a good lesson be a motivator
[1:06:30] be an encourager be a cultivator
[1:06:34] of the right things
[1:06:38] encourage one another provoke one
[1:06:41] another unto love into good works
[1:06:43] how are we gonna do that by shaming
[1:06:45] people and making them feel that if they
[1:06:46] don't dress right
[1:06:47] that they're going to be ostracized by
[1:06:49] shaming people into worship
[1:06:51] by shaming people and do you feel that
[1:06:53] you better told the line better do what
[1:06:54] everybody else is doing no
[1:06:57] by making someone feel the love of god
[1:06:59] enough where they can just be
[1:07:01] who they are in christ and just bring
[1:07:03] out the gold
[1:07:05] you are i if i could just say this give
[1:07:07] me something i'm sitting on a literal
[1:07:08] gold mine here
[1:07:10] spiritual gold we're all go we're all
[1:07:12] gold miners
[1:07:13] it's there and i believe that god can
[1:07:16] bring it out of you
[1:07:18] and that's what wisdom does it
[1:07:19] cultivates
[1:07:21] and i believe that's what you can all be
[1:07:23] as cultivators
[1:07:25] god bless you let's stand this evening
[1:07:29] i feel the love of god with us tonight
[1:07:31] musicians please come
[1:07:34] i feel he's very near to us
[1:07:47] i believe that god has encouraged you
[1:07:48] tonight
[1:07:50] just like he does he's encouraging you
[1:07:53] he's your champion
[1:07:55] we use that phrase maybe to express that
[1:07:57] someone has conquered something but
[1:07:59] he's your champion and that he's
[1:08:00] championing you
[1:08:05] [Music]
[1:08:06] that's the nature of god that's what i
[1:08:09] want to have in my
[1:08:10] life i think that's what we should
[1:08:12] aspire to in our own lives
[1:08:15] is to be encouragers be motivated
[1:08:19] to inspire others especially in our own
[1:08:21] families if in the beginning god created
[1:08:23] the family
[1:08:24] and in the end of the beginning it's
[1:08:26] complicated
[1:08:28] and what we need
[1:08:31] is not so much a list of technical rules
[1:08:33] and standards and things that we can do
[1:08:35] but primarily and most of all what we
[1:08:37] need is wisdom
[1:08:39] wisdom that cultivates
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:43] wisdom that's consistent wisdom that's
[1:08:46] confident
[1:08:47] with our heads bowed tonight i encourage
[1:08:50] each one of you just to express your
[1:08:51] love back to god
[1:08:55] thank him
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:09:02] praise him
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:05] for always being the empowerer
[1:09:10] the enabler the sustainer
[1:09:14] the giver your head's bowed think about
[1:09:17] those times in your life where you
[1:09:19] despaired
[1:09:22] and you don't know how but somehow you
[1:09:25] persevered
[1:09:27] who was that your motivator
[1:09:32] that was your love for christ motivating
[1:09:35] you
[1:09:36] enabling you picking you up
[1:09:40] encouraging you yes we realize there's
[1:09:44] times when god has
[1:09:45] chastised us and did the chastening but
[1:09:47] the chastening with wisdom
[1:09:50] was bookended by praise and affirmation
[1:09:54] such that in the end it yielded the
[1:09:56] peaceable fruit of righteousness
[1:09:59] that only his chastening can bring
[1:10:03] i'd like to confess tonight as a man
[1:10:05] that i have not always
[1:10:08] exercised wisdom in my relationships
[1:10:12] but tonight lord i want this
[1:10:15] instilled in me that i could lead with
[1:10:19] motivation
[1:10:20] lead with inspiration lead with
[1:10:22] encouragement
[1:10:24] before i discourage from something
[1:10:29] there's one thing
[1:10:31] that we can always do as parents as
[1:10:33] spouse
[1:10:35] as brother and sister we can always work
[1:10:38] on our relationships
[1:10:41] it's one thing we can always do i
[1:10:43] encourage you to do that
[1:10:45] with heads bowed we're praying our
[1:10:46] gracious heavenly father
[1:10:48] lord there's so much we can share from
[1:10:49] our hearts now
[1:10:51] so much that we could express
[1:10:56] we're overwhelmed by your presence right
[1:10:58] now lord
[1:11:00] [Music]
[1:11:01] maybe an observer would say well then
[1:11:03] why isn't there weeping and shouting and
[1:11:05] why isn't that the manifestation of
[1:11:08] certain gifts
[1:11:13] it's just not what you're motivating us
[1:11:14] to do right now
[1:11:18] for i believe if you were desiring to
[1:11:20] enable us to speak with tongues that we
[1:11:22] would be speaking with tongues if you
[1:11:24] desired to motivate us to motivate us to
[1:11:26] praise and
[1:11:27] exultation that we would be doing it but
[1:11:30] lord
[1:11:31] we have been so overwhelmed with your
[1:11:34] love we're like that
[1:11:35] iron that has been beat with the axe
[1:11:40] cut by the saw has now been enveloped by
[1:11:44] fire
[1:11:46] we just find ourselves melting into you
[1:11:51] feeling such a strong love
[1:11:54] [Music]
[1:11:59] we're getting our breath back
[1:12:04] we're getting our confidence back
[1:12:08] that zealand enthusiasm we felt when we
[1:12:10] first began to serve you
[1:12:14] it feels so much better now than it's
[1:12:16] ever felt before
[1:12:18] because now it's with wisdom now it
[1:12:21] knows there's heart trials ahead
[1:12:23] now it knows the foolishness of
[1:12:25] self-pride
[1:12:26] lord it's just
[1:12:33] it's not it's not even within reach lord
[1:12:35] it's within us
[1:12:37] and i thank you for this deposit of
[1:12:40] yourself that you've placed inside of us
[1:12:44] and the fact that you would praise us
[1:12:47] that we've done a job well when we know
[1:12:51] it's you
[1:12:51] both in us to will and to do of your
[1:12:53] good pleasure
[1:12:55] that you still praise us and lift us up
[1:12:59] and strengthen us and encourage us lord
[1:13:02] may we have
[1:13:03] eyesight to see what wisdom is
[1:13:07] and to act according to wisdom which is
[1:13:09] from above that is confident consistent
[1:13:11] cultivating
[1:13:13] that we might see it at work in our
[1:13:15] lives
[1:13:17] i say thank you lord i say thank you
[1:13:20] jesus
[1:13:21] thank you father
[1:13:25] i commit these people to you bless them
[1:13:28] i pray as we are dismissed

[1:13:42] name of the lord jesus christ i pray
[1:13:44] amen amen
[1:13:48] praise him
