[0:00] James chapter 5, we'll read verses 1
[0:03] to8. Go to now, ye rich men. Weep and
[0:07] howl for your miseries that shall come
[0:09] upon you. Wow, he's just uh that's
[0:11] interesting. Kind of really hard right
[0:14] in your face. For the rich men, weep and
[0:16] howl for your miseries that shall come
[0:18] upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and
[0:20] your garments are moth eaten. Your gold
[0:22] and silver is cankered, and the rest of
[0:24] them shall be a witness against you, and
[0:26] shall eat your flesh as it were fire.
[0:29] you have heaped treasure together for
[0:30] the last days. And and so you can see
[0:33] he's uh rebuking the rich and even those
[0:36] who with their riches do not do well. He
[0:39] says, "Behold, the hire of the labors
[0:40] who have reaped down your fields, which
[0:42] is of you kept back by fraud, crith, and
[0:45] the cries of them which have reaped for
[0:47] reap are entered into the ears of the
[0:49] Lord of the Sabbath. Ye have lived in
[0:51] pleasure on the earth and been wanting.
[0:53] Ye have nourished your hearts as in the
[0:54] day of slaughter. You've condemned and
[0:56] killed the just, and he doth not resist.
[1:00] Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto
[1:02] the coming of the Lord. Behold, the
[1:04] husband and waited for the precious
[1:05] fruit of the earth, and hath long
[1:06] patience for it, until he received the
[1:09] early and latter rain. Be ye patient,
[1:12] establish your hearts, for the coming of
[1:14] the Lord drawth nigh. Amen. You can be
[1:17] seated.
[1:19] I'll give you my title very quickly and
[1:21] then I'll just jump right into a quick
[1:23] recap of Sunday morning and then uh get
[1:26] further back into this subject. But I'm
[1:27] just using the title today, another
[1:29] garden of Eden. And we are familiar with
[1:32] the original garden of Eden. I'm
[1:34] implying that there is another one uh
[1:36] that is coming forth at least in type as
[1:39] we see these different truths in the
[1:40] Bible even being expressed spiritually
[1:42] now. So that's my title. But on Sunday,
[1:45] we used this scripture in Ecclesiastes
[1:47] chapter 3:1.
[1:49] Uh, Brother Phillip singing that song,
[1:51] Solomon concluded all his vanity. We've
[1:53] been looking at the different complaints
[1:54] that the preacher had in Ecclesiastes.
[1:57] Solomon being the writer, and he says,
[1:58] I've seen all of man's labor under the
[2:01] sun, and it's just all vanity and
[2:03] vexation because no matter how rich he
[2:04] is, how wise he is, there's this leveler
[2:07] called death. Um, there's nothing that a
[2:10] man enjoys after death that he
[2:12] accumulates in this life. And so there's
[2:14] this real frustration uh that he sees in
[2:17] this vanity in the world and he's
[2:18] closing the door to everything but faith
[2:21] because he concludes there's no in the
[2:23] end of all of this I see there's nothing
[2:24] better than to fear God. This is the
[2:26] duty of man to fear God to reverence him
[2:28] to have faith in God and to keep his
[2:30] commandments. But right in the middle of
[2:32] all these uh observations he's making he
[2:34] says heath made everything beautiful in
[2:36] his time. That's the nature of God as a
[2:38] creator is he has a process where he
[2:41] brings forth something beautiful. Also,
[2:43] he hath set the world in their heart. We
[2:46] saw in different translations I believe
[2:48] even in the amplified Bible it says he
[2:50] hath planted eternity in man's heart.
[2:53] And I I think that it's a truth that we
[2:56] believe in and I want you to see it in
[2:57] the scripture here if we could that he
[2:59] has set the world but that word there
[3:02] even implies a an eternity in our hearts
[3:04] a divine purpose. So in mankind there is
[3:08] a thirst, there's a hunger, this this
[3:10] longing of the soul that only God can
[3:13] satisfy. And that's why James castigates
[3:16] the rich man because he trusts in his
[3:17] wealth and he thinks through gaining
[3:19] things he can find rest. But truly the
[3:21] soul of man is only going to be
[3:24] satisfied by eternal things and by the
[3:26] word of God. So God having planted
[3:29] eternity in our souls, we have a duty to
[3:32] the title we used on Sunday is the
[3:33] planting of eternity. We have a duty to
[3:35] this. We used last Wednesday a
[3:37] responsibility of being what we are now
[3:40] and what we're becoming. And this is a
[3:43] divine trust that's given to each one of
[3:45] us. So we have a responsibility to
[3:46] cultivate to care for and look after and
[3:49] protect things that God has given us. If
[3:52] you have eternal life, we want to
[3:54] express that eternal life. If you have
[3:55] gifts and talents, even as a an artist
[3:58] or someone that would sing or write
[3:59] songs, whatever those talents may be,
[4:01] you have a responsibility to those gifts
[4:03] that God has given you naturally to see
[4:06] that you employ them skillfully to bring
[4:08] him glory. We could say according to the
[4:10] word of God, the seed of eternity is
[4:12] planted into God's children. The seed
[4:14] having been planted in the hearts of
[4:16] God's children, we're called
[4:18] individually to serve that germ of
[4:19] eternal life. If it's in us, we want to
[4:21] live a life that honors that. We want to
[4:23] believe that we're raising children that
[4:25] offer have that in them. So we're made
[4:27] in this image of God. A man uh made in
[4:30] the image God was given a divine purpose
[4:32] to care for and to cultivate life. These
[4:35] are things that we are wanting to touch
[4:36] on Sunday. So in this subject of another
[4:39] Garden of Eden, let's look at Genesis
[4:41] 2:8. And I'd like to ask you to consider
[4:44] what are you planting and also what are
[4:46] you growing or cultivating. Says, "And
[4:48] the Lord God planted a garden eastward
[4:50] in Eden." That's why we call it the
[4:52] garden of Eden. God planted a garden
[4:55] eastward in Eden and there he put the
[4:57] man whom he had formed. So now he has
[5:00] established an enclosure. You read in
[5:02] further in these verses you find that
[5:04] there was trees and plants and flowers
[5:06] and fruit. This was the garden of God's
[5:09] delight. In the Persian it means a
[5:10] king's garden. And I want to use this
[5:13] phrase. I hope it doesn't stumble
[5:14] anybody. I'm not trivializing God nor am
[5:16] I trying to elevate a green thumb to the
[5:18] status of a deity. But God was the first
[5:20] gardener.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; He plants a garden eastward in Eden. And
[5:25] there he put the man to what? To till
[5:27] the soil. Put the man there to dress it
[5:29] and keep it. So man is placed in the
[5:31] garden to do the same. To be a gardener.
[5:34] And gardening, if you ever studied this,
[5:36] and I'm just curious here, how many
[5:38] people have been studying the Wikipedia
[5:39] entry of gardening this past week? But
[5:42] gardening, gardening is not just
[5:43] throwing seeds in the ground, but it's
[5:46] the laying out of and the care of the
[5:48] plot of ground that's devoted to growing
[5:50] plants. And it requires the right
[5:53] arrangement of plants. I can remember
[5:55] times in my life when flowers have been
[5:58] planted and things have been shoved into
[5:59] flower gardens a and someone comes along
[6:02] and looks at says, "You can't do that."
[6:04] Like, "Well, why not? They all fit."
[6:05] It's like, "Well, as they begin to grow,
[6:07] it's just going to get crowded over and
[6:09] it's going to look just like a
[6:10] hodgepodge." and this one isn't going to
[6:12] survive because this one's going to grow
[6:13] faster and block the sunlight and that
[6:15] one doesn't belong in Texas and this one
[6:17] can't survive this. And you realize, oh,
[6:19] I thought they were just seeds and we
[6:21] had a lot of soil here and and you just
[6:23] plant them. But you have to give thought
[6:25] to harmoniously arrange plants to each
[6:28] other, put them in the right kind of
[6:30] ground with the proper conditions and
[6:32] environment and then you just don't
[6:33] plant the seed and cross your fingers it
[6:36] comes up, but there's a cultivation that
[6:37] goes with it. And so gardening is even
[6:40] considered an art form. And that may not
[6:42] be a surprise to you. They have
[6:43] competitions in gardening. And I don't
[6:45] know when it'll make our Olympics, but
[6:47] we may be on our way there. Maybe with
[6:48] the more woke we get, we'll have the
[6:50] gardening Olympics. But it there's a
[6:53] creative process that goes with it. Even
[6:54] with gardening, there's this emotional
[6:56] resonance to those who uh do it. There's
[6:58] skill required in gardening. uh even in
[7:02] I think it was in the Renaissance period
[7:03] that gardening began to view be viewed
[7:05] as you know more than just cultivating
[7:08] land to have uh produce so you can eat
[7:10] but it's a place of enjoyment it was a
[7:12] place of respite or relaxation and so it
[7:14] was took on this meaning of an art form
[7:16] and gardening is not like other forms of
[7:19] art as we've been looking at it this
[7:20] year using that subject but in the in
[7:22] gardening that you're partnering with
[7:23] nature a life something living to to
[7:26] nurture a living organism to bring it to
[7:28] fruit so it's something I believe that
[7:30] akin to the nature of God who planted a
[7:34] garden. And Adam and the woman were
[7:36] placed in this garden of Eden. The
[7:38] scripture says to dress it, to keep it,
[7:40] and to also enjoy it. And I think that
[7:42] maybe is that what's at the heart of
[7:44] what I'm wanting to express tonight. If
[7:46] you could just remember that they were
[7:47] to dress it, to keep it, but not just to
[7:49] labor in it and sweat and figure this
[7:51] out and figure that out, but they were
[7:52] also to enjoy it. And so I'll say this
[7:55] to us uh as something relevant. We're
[7:57] not just looking at historically, but
[7:58] the bride's been placed on the earth to
[8:01] dress, to keep, and enjoy this planting
[8:04] of the Lord. A child of God is put on
[8:06] earth to look after, to care for, and
[8:08] enjoy the fruits of this planting of
[8:11] eternity that's been put into our hearts
[8:13] &gt;&gt; individually. I could say that you are a
[8:16] garden of Eden. You there's a planting
[8:18] of God in your heart, a part of divine,
[8:20] a divine purpose that's swn into you.
[8:22] Spiritually, we're being restored to an
[8:24] Eden condition. And so there's something
[8:26] that you individually embody because
[8:28] there's a germ of life inside of you
[8:30] that God wants to quicken and bring to
[8:32] life and bring forth the fruits of the
[8:34] spirit in your life. And then there's
[8:36] even this collective view of the body of
[8:38] Christ. Even in the Hebrew, the the term
[8:41] and the phrase for garden is figurative
[8:43] of a wife. That when the Lord planted a
[8:45] garden eastward in Eden, he was
[8:47] foreshadowing his body, his bride, that
[8:50] this was going to be something of his
[8:51] planting. And so we see a garden as the
[8:54] soil being like a womb where whatever
[8:56] seed is sewn it produces.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; And so that's what uh what we have
[9:00] something we look at ourselves as being
[9:02] as we are uh whatever seed is sown it's
[9:04] going to pre bring it forth
[9:06] &gt;&gt; something to think of a as men our wives
[9:08] are made that whatever seed you sew
[9:10] they're going to bring forth. So if you
[9:11] sow harshness and bitterness and
[9:13] jealousy and all sorts of things then
[9:15] you're just going to get that out of
[9:16] your garden. And so God has these laws.
[9:19] He's not mocked. It's the laws of
[9:21] reproduction and the harvest that
[9:23] whatever we reap for better or for worse
[9:25] is what we've already planted.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[9:28] &gt;&gt; What we plant, we will reap. We will
[9:30] reap what we have planted. Again, just
[9:33] another look at this scripture in 1
[9:35] Corinthians 3 6-9. Paul says, "I have
[9:39] planted, Apollos watered, but God gave
[9:41] the increase." So, you could see that
[9:43] there's instances where someone does the
[9:45] labor of planting the seed. Another may
[9:47] do the labor of watering, but it's God
[9:49] that's in all this. So then neither is
[9:51] he that planteth anything, neither he
[9:52] that waterth, but God that giveth the
[9:54] increase. Then he says, "Now he that
[9:56] plantth and he that waterth are one." So
[9:59] there's this common labor, this common
[10:00] goal, and every man shall receive his
[10:03] own reward according to his own labor.
[10:06] This is where I was wanting to focus
[10:08] specifically. We are labors together
[10:09] with God. Ye are God's husbandry. You
[10:12] are God's building. Even if we looked at
[10:15] it in the sense of Paul and Apollos,
[10:16] Paul saying, "I've planted, Apollos
[10:17] watered, but it's God who brings the
[10:19] yield." And we as ministers are serving
[10:22] God's seed. We're serving this garden of
[10:25] God. So, we are co-labors together with
[10:27] God. God being a gardener, being a
[10:29] planter, being a husbandman, being a
[10:31] keeper and dresser of a vineyard. We saw
[10:33] those different scriptures on Sunday,
[10:34] how God looked at Israel as his vine.
[10:37] This planting that he looks after, that
[10:38] he'll water, that he'll keep, watch over
[10:40] night and day. And so he says, "You are
[10:42] God's vineyard, husbandry. You are God's
[10:44] garden." And then God's building is just
[10:46] another type of what God is doing in
[10:48] you. He's building these things up. I
[10:50] want to put us in the same uh category
[10:53] as Paul and Apollos says being co-abors
[10:56] together with God in his garden. That he
[10:59] just doesn't indiscriminately throw seed
[11:01] out there and he's just hoping it into
[11:03] the wind. God says that we shouldn't do
[11:05] that that neither has he done it. and he
[11:08] has swn seed and then given us care over
[11:10] how that will grow. Now, in James
[11:13] chapter 5, I'd like to jump in the
[11:14] middle of it to verse four, but if we
[11:16] could just recap as we've been reading
[11:18] this, he James has been dealing with
[11:20] different things. He's warned against
[11:21] worldliness. He's admonishing the
[11:23] believer to be humble. And then we see
[11:25] he begins to censor uh the rich and he
[11:28] really lets them have it there in the
[11:29] first few verses. Then in verse four, he
[11:32] is uh expressing these different sins
[11:34] that are worthy of God's wrath. This
[11:36] first one here is this injustice to
[11:37] laborers. Behold, the hire of the
[11:40] laborers who have reaped down your
[11:41] fields, which is of you kept back by
[11:44] fraud, crith. So the the rich men have
[11:47] hired people to work and labor in the
[11:49] field, and they are due a reward. And he
[11:53] says, you've kept it back by deceit or
[11:55] by fraud. You haven't given them what
[11:56] they're due. And he says, and the cries
[11:57] of them which have reaped are entered
[11:59] into the ears of the Lord of the
[12:00] Sabbath. So the Lord of Sabbath. So he's
[12:02] saying that even to God, this is an
[12:04] injustice to God. You've defrauded them.
[12:07] And there's this injustice of
[12:08] withholding what one is owed when they
[12:10] have labored and worked in this in
[12:12] reaping. As he says, they have reaped
[12:14] down your fields and their cries have
[12:16] come to the Lord of Sabbath because you
[12:18] owed them something. instead of getting
[12:21] into the the laws and the Levitical laws
[12:24] and even in Deuteronomy, but you could
[12:25] see in the Old Testament when someone
[12:27] labored in your field, you gave them
[12:30] some of that portion of their labor as a
[12:32] reward for them working. So there's
[12:35] something that I want you to take from
[12:37] here is that is when one labors in a
[12:39] field, there's something due them. Even
[12:40] if it's not their field,
[12:42] &gt;&gt; even if they've been hired to reap and
[12:44] they've been hired to labor, to not pay
[12:46] them or to not let them enjoy the fruits
[12:48] of that labor being directly connected
[12:50] with what they're harvesting. Do you
[12:52] realize that even in the law there was
[12:54] this uh social consideration given and
[12:57] we might we might have different terms
[13:00] uh for it. Uh but there was welfare that
[13:02] was given to the poor that when you
[13:04] gleaned your fields and you harvested
[13:06] the field, you didn't cut the you kind
[13:07] of left a little bit in the corners and
[13:09] you didn't pick everything up because
[13:10] then the poor who didn't have fields who
[13:12] didn't own land could come and begin to
[13:14] glean and pick up these different things
[13:16] and have some fruit of the field to live
[13:18] by.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Here it's saying that when one works and
[13:21] labors in a field there do some of the
[13:23] fruits of those field. Proverbs chapter
[13:26] 27:18, "Who so keepeth the fig tree
[13:28] shall eat the fruit thereof." So he that
[13:31] waiteth on his master shall be honored.
[13:34] So this is how the master, the owner of
[13:36] the vineyard uh honors the laborer by
[13:39] letting them eat or partake of the fruit
[13:42] that they're harvesting. They don't keep
[13:44] 100% because that wouldn't wouldn't be
[13:46] worth it to the master to hire somebody
[13:48] who's going to keep all of it. But he
[13:50] allows them to eat the fruit thereof. He
[13:52] that keeps the fig tree. He may not have
[13:54] been the one that planted it. May not be
[13:55] the one that owns it, but he looks out
[13:57] after it. Looks out after the fruits of
[13:59] it. He is allowed to eat the fruit
[14:00] thereof. This keeper, this steward. So,
[14:02] what I want you to catch tonight, he has
[14:04] a right to enjoy the fruits of the field
[14:06] that he's laboring in.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; And as James is dealing with these sins
[14:10] that are worthy of God's wrath, we see
[14:11] this injustice to labors. Then next
[14:13] couple verses, he's going to talk about
[14:15] those who's just are self-indulgent,
[14:17] even those that oppress the righteous.
[14:18] And he says in verse 5, you've lived in
[14:20] pleasure on the earth and been wanting.
[14:22] You've been negligent. You've been
[14:23] reckless. You've nourished your hearts
[14:26] as in a day of slaughter. So notice how
[14:27] there is this self-centeredness,
[14:29] selfishness, sewing to the flesh. That's
[14:31] that self-indulgence. And you've
[14:33] condemned and killed the just. This is
[14:35] the oppression of the righteous. And he
[14:37] doth not resist you. So they've been uh
[14:40] unfair and unrighteous. Then I believe
[14:43] he's kind of changing his uh uh audience
[14:47] because he's there. He's kind of
[14:48] rebuking the rich. He says, "Be patient,
[14:50] therefore, brethren, unto the coming of
[14:52] the Lord." But he still uses this theme
[14:56] of the husbandman and the vine. Behold,
[14:59] the husbandman waiteth for the precious
[15:01] fruit of the earth and hath long
[15:03] patience for it until he received the
[15:05] early and latter rain. So now he's still
[15:08] in that theme of one that works and
[15:10] labors in a field should enjoy uh the
[15:12] fruits of that field. And now he's
[15:14] saying not just one who would labor for
[15:16] the rich who own the field, but now
[15:18] there is one who's actually uh God is
[15:21] the husbandman who's waiting for this
[15:23] precious fruit of the earth and he waits
[15:26] a long time for it until he received the
[15:28] early and latter rain. It's an illusion
[15:30] to the fact that in to the Jews they
[15:33] received usually just two rains. They
[15:35] received the early rain at the time of
[15:36] the planting and a rain later at the
[15:39] time of the harvest. So he says, "Be ye
[15:41] also patient. Establish your hearts for
[15:44] the coming of the Lord drawth nigh. And
[15:46] what is he looking for? He's looking for
[15:48] fruit.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; As he says that the husband waits for
[15:52] the precious fruit of the earth and he
[15:53] waits long for it. There's a
[15:55] considerable amount of time between the
[15:57] sewing of seed and that ripening of the
[16:00] fruit. So what happens? The husbandman
[16:02] waits. He waits for that to come. The
[16:06] goal of planting seed is to enjoy the
[16:08] fruits of that seed.
[16:10] You plant and keep and water and
[16:13] cultivate. The husbandman waits a long
[16:15] time to enjoy the fruits of the earth.
[16:17] And the Bible here calls it precious
[16:18] fruit of the earth. Why is it precious?
[16:20] Because the benefit it gives to both man
[16:22] and beast. The benefit it gives to the
[16:25] labor. He sws even grain. And what does
[16:27] he eat? Eats bread. And so it's the
[16:29] precious fruit of the earth. Because
[16:31] though he labors and toils and waits
[16:33] long for it, he enjoys the fruits of it.
[16:35] And in partaking of it, it's precious.
[16:37] Amen.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 9:7 it says, "Who
[16:41] goeth a warfare any time at his own
[16:44] charges?" We could say these seem to be
[16:47] rhetorical questions where the answer is
[16:49] obvious. He says, "Who planteth a
[16:50] vineyard and eateth not of the fruit
[16:52] thereof?" In other words, who would
[16:54] plant a vineyard and it would grow fruit
[16:56] and not partake in it?
[16:59] &gt;&gt; Or who feedth a flock and eateth not of
[17:01] the milk of the flock? See, it's only
[17:03] right that one that would tend to the
[17:05] flock would enjoy the milk of that
[17:06] flock. It's only right that one that
[17:09] would be a planter and one who plants a
[17:11] vineyard would not eat that they would
[17:13] enjoy the garden that they planted.
[17:17] I would say that anybody who's labored
[17:19] and tried uh maybe here in Phoenix, I
[17:21] can remember my brother gave me a a
[17:23] citrus tree and and the goal was that it
[17:25] would grow citrus fruit, not so that it
[17:28] looked beautiful on a tree so that you
[17:29] could eat it. Maybe some hand fruit and
[17:31] and the one that he gave me didn't last
[17:33] very long. That's on me. But the goal
[17:36] would be to plant it, water it, keep it
[17:38] so that one day you could eat the fruit
[17:39] of that tree. That's why you look after
[17:41] it. And that's why when you get a tree,
[17:44] sometimes you don't know, I don't know
[17:45] if this is the kind that does this. I
[17:47] don't know if I'm going to get olives. I
[17:48] don't know if I'm going to get fruit
[17:49] from this tree. But that's the reason
[17:50] why you would plant something, a fruit
[17:53] tree, is to enjoy the fruits of it. He
[17:55] that plants fruit plants a tree should
[17:57] enjoy the fruits of that tree. In
[18:00] Deuteronomy 20, when it's talking about
[18:02] the exclusions to war and these
[18:05] different things, it says, "And what man
[18:06] is he that hath planted a vineyard and
[18:08] hath not yet eaten of it? let him also
[18:10] go and return into his house, lest he
[18:12] die in the battle and another man eat of
[18:14] it. That may seem to be trivial, but the
[18:17] Bible is saying that if a man plants a
[18:19] vineyard and the time has not yet come
[18:22] where he can finally in that year enjoy
[18:25] and eat of it, saying that man is able
[18:27] and allowed in that year to go back and
[18:30] leave war and eat the fruit of his
[18:33] field, lest this horrific thing of him
[18:35] dying and a stranger enjoy it and he has
[18:38] never enjoyed it.
[18:41] So he's saying it's unjust for a man to
[18:43] die before enjoying the fruits of his
[18:45] labor.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; This should speak to us in the way that
[18:48] we begin to understand that God is
[18:49] saying that he that keeps a fig tree
[18:52] should eat the figs of that tree. Even
[18:54] if he doesn't own it, he's the keeper of
[18:56] it. And there that by the owner
[18:59] uh honors the laborer by letting him eat
[19:02] of that fruit
[19:04] because the the the husband waits for
[19:06] the precious fruit of that which he
[19:08] planted. It's only right that he that
[19:10] plants a vineyard should eat the fruit
[19:12] thereof. And a man who plants a vineyard
[19:14] and he goes out to war, if he hasn't
[19:16] eaten of that vineyard, if that time and
[19:18] that year comes when he ought to partake
[19:20] in it and it's a year that's for him and
[19:22] it's not to be given away or to be
[19:23] storless he die in battle, let him leave
[19:26] war to go back and eat of the fruit of
[19:28] the vine. I think that's pretty
[19:30] remarkable.
[19:32] What I'm trying to emphasize to you is
[19:34] that if there's if there's fruit to be
[19:36] had and you have any part in that
[19:38] process, it's all right as believers to
[19:40] enjoy the fruits.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; I want to cover several scriptures and
[19:45] doing so just glean uh from them this
[19:47] principle of planting to enjoy fruit or
[19:50] enjoying that which we labor over. And I
[19:53] think that it'll probably go by pretty
[19:54] quickly tonight. and making no promises.
[19:58] I think it should go by pretty quickly
[20:00] because I just want to kind of go
[20:01] through this very uh in a way very
[20:04] surfacy just to see these teachings. In
[20:06] Mark 12:es 1 to 12 and he began to speak
[20:09] unto them by parables and this is the
[20:12] parable that he expresses. A certain man
[20:14] planted a vineyard and set an hedge
[20:15] about it and digged a place for the wine
[20:18] fat and built a tower and led it out to
[20:21] husbandmen and went into a far country.
[20:24] Now, what's covered in just a few
[20:25] statements here cannot be overlooked.
[20:27] But he plants a vineyard. He builds
[20:29] hedges around it, digs a place for the
[20:32] pressing, and builds a tower to watch
[20:34] out over it. That's a lot of work.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; I want you to catch this. A lot of work
[20:38] that goes into planting a vineyard. A
[20:40] lot of different ancillary things that
[20:43] relate to this so that it can be
[20:44] successful.
[20:46] And he gives it to tenants as some of
[20:48] the Bibles will say. This is a parable
[20:50] of tenants. says, "And at the season he
[20:53] because he lets it out to husband men
[20:55] and at the season," this is the time of
[20:56] a harvest time where there's been this
[20:58] the wine perhaps is being made. He sent
[21:00] to the husband of a servant that he
[21:02] might receive from the husband men of
[21:04] the fruit of the vine. The husbandman is
[21:07] the one there keeping it. The owner
[21:09] certain man planted a vineyard. He
[21:10] planted it. He's made all the
[21:13] arrangements. Now he's let someone keep
[21:14] it who's called the husbandman. But now
[21:16] the owner, the planter, wants to enjoy
[21:18] the fruits of it. There's one there
[21:20] who's laboring for it, but he wants the
[21:22] fruit since he planted it. Sends a
[21:24] servant to get it. They caught him and
[21:26] beat him and sent him away empty. And
[21:28] again he sent unto them another servant.
[21:29] And at him they cast stones and wounded
[21:31] him in the head and sent him away
[21:33] shamefully handled. And again he sent
[21:35] another and him they killed and many
[21:37] others beating some and killing some.
[21:39] Pretty violent husbandmen. These are
[21:42] violent tenants. These are worse than
[21:44] squatters. having yet therefore one son,
[21:46] his well-beloved. He sent him also last
[21:48] unto them, saying, They will reverence
[21:50] my son. But those husbandmen said among
[21:52] themselves, "This is the heir. Come, let
[21:55] us kill him, and the inheritance shall
[21:57] be ours." If I could point one thing
[22:00] out, I'm not wanting to use this as my
[22:03] main point, but notice one man planted a
[22:06] vineyard. Others were given
[22:07] responsibility over it, and now they're
[22:09] being unfaithful to what they've been
[22:11] given.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Want to claim it as their own. They want
[22:13] to disregard the servants of the one who
[22:15] uh uh God is sending or the planter is
[22:17] sending to them to instruct them and
[22:19] they want to enjoy everything without
[22:21] accountability even rejecting the son
[22:23] Jesus Christ. So there's this image of
[22:25] Israel in this no question. But then so
[22:28] there's this responsibility also we
[22:29] could see that if we haven't planted it
[22:31] but we're given responsibility over it.
[22:33] We have a responsibility to him that
[22:34] planted it.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; And they took him and killed the son and
[22:38] cast him out of the vineyard. What shall
[22:40] therefore the lord of the vineyard do?
[22:42] And in some of the other readings, they
[22:43] answered said, "Oh, surely he's just
[22:45] going to destroy them all." And he says,
[22:46] "He will come and destroy the husband
[22:47] and will give the vineyard unto others.
[22:50] And have you not read the scripture? The
[22:51] stone which the builders rejected, he's
[22:53] become the head of the corner." This was
[22:55] the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in
[22:57] your eyes, in our eyes. So, he's he's
[23:00] challenging them. And I I picked Mark
[23:02] because this is what the Mark writes,
[23:04] "And they sought to lay hold on him, but
[23:06] feared the people, for they knew that he
[23:08] had spoken the parable against them, and
[23:11] they left him. and went their way. They
[23:13] saw themselves or at least they felt
[23:16] pinned down by this parable that they
[23:18] having been given a responsibility have
[23:20] not been faithful with it. And they even
[23:23] wanted to lay hold on him to kill him
[23:25] even in the image of this parable that
[23:26] they will kill his son.
[23:28] A and they recognize this guilt or this
[23:31] consciousness that they are the ones who
[23:33] have been unfaithful.
[23:35] And this is Jesus is giving this image
[23:38] of Israel which was God's vineyard. He
[23:40] was a planting. They were this planting.
[23:42] Some look at this scripture that he
[23:44] hedged up Israel by the law. That he
[23:46] planted there even amongst them this
[23:48] wine press of Jerusalem. That the tower
[23:50] could even be seen as the temple. That
[23:51] God had done thing things in Israel and
[23:54] expected this fruitful bow, this
[23:55] fruitful harvest. But they had become
[23:57] unfaithful.
[23:59] And in this is there not only an image
[24:01] of Israel, but it's an image of the
[24:03] world.
[24:05] God created a beautiful world for us to
[24:07] live in and to enjoy. But what has
[24:09] happened to it? has become overcome with
[24:11] wickedness. It's the image of even the
[24:13] individual.
[24:15] But God plants expecting something from
[24:18] what he planted. And when he's not able
[24:20] to get back what he wants, there's
[24:21] consequences. We can see this here in
[24:24] the parable of the man who planted a
[24:26] vineyard.
[24:28] Seeing this from just a different
[24:29] perspective in John 15:es 1:9,
[24:33] Jesus says, "I am the true vine and my
[24:36] father is the husbandman." So now we
[24:38] even see God as being the one is the
[24:40] dresser, the keeper, the one who's
[24:42] looking out after it. Every branch in me
[24:44] that beareth not fruit, he taketh away.
[24:47] And every branch that beareth fruit, he
[24:48] purgeth it, that it may bring forth more
[24:50] fruit. So if you're being purged, praise
[24:52] the Lord. It means the potential for
[24:54] fruitfulness is there.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; Now you are clean through the word which
[24:58] I have spoken unto you. Abide in me and
[25:01] I in you. As the branch cannot bear
[25:03] fruit of itself except it abide in the
[25:05] vine, no more can ye except ye abide in
[25:08] me. So now this brings the individual
[25:10] into this that he is the vine, the
[25:12] father's the husbandman. But now you're
[25:14] a branch of the vine. Verse 5, I am the
[25:16] vine, ye are the branches. He that
[25:18] abideth in me and I in him, the same
[25:20] bringeth forth much fruit. For without
[25:23] me ye can do nothing. So the branch
[25:25] which ye are must abide in the vine in
[25:28] order to be fruitful.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you're going to be
[25:31] fruitful, there's some purging. There's
[25:33] some pruning. There's some care that God
[25:35] gives to a fruitful branch so that it
[25:37] can bring forth or even to that vine and
[25:41] the branches of that vine so it can
[25:42] bring forth fruit.
[25:45] The vine is what furnishes the life or
[25:47] the energy to the branches to be
[25:49] fruitful. So without Christ, you can do
[25:51] nothing. Verse six, if a man abide not
[25:54] in me, he is cast forth as a branch and
[25:56] is withered. and men gather them and
[25:58] cast them in the fire and they're
[25:59] burned. An unfruitful branch is pruned
[26:02] and burned.
[26:05] But that fruitful branch, it's it's it
[26:07] wants to continue to be fruitful. He
[26:09] says, "If you abide in me and my words
[26:10] abide in you, you shall ask what you
[26:12] will and it shall be done unto you."
[26:14] Read this Sunday and how this
[26:15] glorification of the Lord herein is my
[26:17] father glorified that you bear much
[26:20] fruit. How is God glorified when we're
[26:23] fruitful? How is it that the Lord is
[26:25] honored when we're fruitful? Not just by
[26:27] the confession of our mouth. Not by
[26:29] putting a bumper sticker on our on our
[26:31] cars or maybe just by a decal that we
[26:33] like to wear, but there God is glorified
[26:36] when we bear. And I hope you caught this
[26:39] much fruit
[26:42] &gt;&gt; that we want our fruit to abound. We
[26:43] want it to grow more and more. This is
[26:45] how God is glorified that you bear much
[26:47] fruit. So shall you be my disciples. And
[26:48] the father hath loved me, so I have
[26:50] loved you. Continue ye in my love. So
[26:53] there's this uh commandment that we as
[26:56] the children of God must abide in the
[26:58] vine. The vine will give us energy and
[27:01] by that energy we can be fruitful
[27:02] branches because that's what glorifies
[27:04] the Lord. Because God as the father has
[27:08] planted a vine that brings forth
[27:09] branches and what does he expect? He
[27:11] expects fruit because the principle
[27:13] we're looking at in the scriptures that
[27:14] he that plants a vineyard and he that
[27:16] labors in a vineyard has a right to
[27:18] enjoy the fruits of that. So if there's
[27:20] if there's not the fruits aren't
[27:22] received in return, he's like, "Well, I
[27:24] didn't I didn't build this plant this
[27:26] grove just to get firewood, could have
[27:28] planted other trees that are good for
[27:30] firewood, right? I could have planted
[27:33] one that smells a little bit better,
[27:34] burns a little bit longer." He didn't do
[27:36] it just to have kindling. He planted it
[27:38] for fruit.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[27:40] &gt;&gt; there are those that we see in the
[27:42] scripture that are good for burning.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; We we see that in scripture. There's the
[27:47] hay, the wood, the stubble, all those
[27:48] things are going to be burned. But those
[27:50] things that are precious are going to be
[27:51] purified and purged because they're
[27:53] something precious to them. Luke 13 6 7
[27:58] 8 and n spake of also this parable. A
[28:01] certain man had a fig tree planted in
[28:03] his vineyard and he came and sought
[28:05] fruit thereon and found none. Now none
[28:07] of us read that and be like, well what a
[28:09] narcissist this guy is expecting food or
[28:13] figs from a fig tree. But he planted a
[28:15] fig tree in his vineyard and he wanted
[28:18] fruit from that and not finding it he
[28:20] said unto the dresser of his vineyard.
[28:22] So a man planted it but he has someone
[28:24] else caring for it. I hope you could see
[28:26] yourself in this too. And he says behold
[28:29] these three years I've come seeking
[28:31] fruit on this fig tree and find none.
[28:33] Cut it down. Why cometh it the ground?
[28:37] And he answering said this is the the
[28:39] dresser of the vineyard now. Lord, let
[28:41] it alone this year also till I shalt dig
[28:44] about it and dung it. And if it bear
[28:46] fruit well, and if not, then after that
[28:48] thou shalt cut it down. This is the kind
[28:51] of attitude that we ought to have to be
[28:53] a little bit long-suffering and patient
[28:55] to say, Lord, let me continue to work
[28:57] with this tree, this vineyard, this
[28:59] planting. I I don't want to be quick to
[29:01] judge it or condemn it, but let me dig
[29:03] about it. Let me dung it, fertilize it a
[29:05] little bit. let me see if there's
[29:06] something I could do to promote growth
[29:08] so that it can give and yield to you the
[29:10] figs that you're desiring to see.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; A man plants a fig tree in his vineyard.
[29:15] He hires somebody to take care of it and
[29:17] he comes expecting figs on that fig
[29:20] tree. Having not received them, he wants
[29:22] to cut it down and burn it because what
[29:23] else would it be good for? He says,
[29:24] "It's just taking up space in my
[29:26] garden." But here's the heart of a true
[29:29] uh dresser of the vineyard who knows the
[29:32] desire of the masters to see fruit. It's
[29:34] not just uh sympathy for the tree. He
[29:37] sees he knows the desire and the labor
[29:39] and the investment that the master has
[29:40] and he intervenes. He says, "Let's just
[29:42] work a little bit more." We see the
[29:44] image of Christ in that. We see the
[29:46] demand that God wants to see fruit. We
[29:48] see the intercession of CHRIST WHO SAYS,
[29:50] "HOLD ON. JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE
[29:52] TIME THAT it might be fruitful." And I
[29:54] hope that we can see an image of
[29:55] ourselves that God gives us the
[29:57] responsibility. And we want to take that
[29:59] responsibility seriously so that not
[30:02] just that we would see fruit but that we
[30:03] could also be partakers of the fruits
[30:05] thereof.
[30:07] in Isaiah 5:es 1-7.
[30:11] This is uh there a little bit more maybe
[30:14] weight to this one uh because it does um
[30:19] it does express some judgments. A lot I
[30:23] would say maybe just a lot here to
[30:24] really wrestle with um in terms of what
[30:27] is being represented. He says, "Now I
[30:29] will sing to my well-beloved the song of
[30:31] my beloved touching his vineyard."
[30:35] We read also in Isaiah on Sunday about
[30:37] that vineyard of red wine. My
[30:39] well-beloved hath the vineyard in a very
[30:41] fruitful hill.
[30:43] Remember these parables in Mark chapter
[30:46] 12, how he sends his well-beloved unto
[30:49] him, his son. So now these Jesus is
[30:51] drawing from these scriptural prophecies
[30:54] of their own prophets. So we can see
[30:56] this connection to these parables he's
[30:58] given. My wellbeloved hath the vineyard
[31:00] in a very fruitful hill. And he fenced
[31:02] it and gathered out the stones thereof
[31:05] and planted it with the choicest vine
[31:07] and built a tower in the midst of it and
[31:09] also made a wine press therein. Now what
[31:12] is that pattern after? Those parables of
[31:15] the tenants in ma Matthew and Mark and
[31:17] Luke wherein he set a hedge about it. He
[31:19] digged a place for the a wine press,
[31:21] built a tower, lent it out to a
[31:23] husbandman. So here he says that he
[31:25] gathered the stones out. cultivated the
[31:27] ground, got the stones out, built the
[31:28] fence, placed the uh planted the
[31:31] choicest vine, built the tower to watch
[31:33] out over it, and also made a wine press
[31:35] in order to get the the juice of that to
[31:37] press it to have wine. And he says, "And
[31:39] he looked that it should bring forth
[31:41] grapes." Why? Why would he do that? He's
[31:44] not being unreasonable. That's why he
[31:46] went through this work. There's uh I
[31:50] think that and I don't want to get lost
[31:52] in this, but I think this really
[31:54] challenges our mindset in this day and
[31:56] age where we're really about the the
[31:58] picture
[32:01] and not even so much the faithful
[32:02] process or even the the proof or the
[32:05] enjoyment of it, but we want it just to
[32:07] look good. And we'll achieve it by uh
[32:10] filters if we can. Even if it isn't
[32:12] really good, we'll just fake it so that
[32:14] everybody else thinks we made it.
[32:17] And here all this labor if you can't
[32:19] grow the actual fruit and it actually
[32:22] tastes good. I don't care how well it
[32:23] looks on Instagram.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not doing this for the views.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Changes the meaning of do it for the
[32:29] vine. In other words, do it right so you
[32:32] can enjoy the fruits of it.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Gather the stones out. PLANT THE BEST
[32:36] seed for the choice is fine. BUILD A
[32:38] TOWER AND COME LOOKING FOR GRAPES. HE
[32:40] SAYS, "BUT IT BROUGHT FORTH WILD
[32:42] GRAPES." That shouldn't have happened.
[32:45] So he says now, "Oh inhabitants of
[32:46] Jerusalem," now you can see where his
[32:48] parable in Matthew 12 gives this image
[32:50] of Israel and Jerusalem and the temple.
[32:52] He says, 'Oh inhabitants of Jerusalem
[32:53] and men of Judah, judge, I pray you,
[32:55] between me and my vineyard. What could
[32:58] have been done more to my vineyard that
[33:00] I have not done in it?
[33:03] Rhetorical question. He did everything
[33:05] that you would want. Find the plot,
[33:08] fence it, take the stones out, plant,
[33:11] build a tower, watch over it, cultivate
[33:13] it, do what you need to. He says,
[33:15] "Wherefore, when I looked that it should
[33:17] bring forth grapes, brought forth wild,
[33:18] it brought forth wild grapes. Why? When
[33:20] I planted the choice vine, is it now
[33:23] yielding to me wild grapes?" Now, we
[33:26] might uh be able to gather from this, it
[33:29] had to get in there somehow,
[33:31] &gt;&gt; right? I want you to think about this
[33:33] maybe for on Sunday. this responsibility
[33:36] of not sewing the wrong kind of seed.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; That then overtakes the field and now
[33:42] you no longer see fruits of the spirit.
[33:43] You see fruits of the flesh.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Now you see the the Oh, you say, "Well,
[33:47] it's Isn't aren't A BUNCH OF WILD GRAPES
[33:50] JUST AS good as no grapes."
[33:53] I haven't kind of heard a similar
[33:55] proclamation, right? I'd rather have I'd
[33:57] rather have something wild than nothing
[33:58] at all. Well, God wants what he planted.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; We don't want to. He's saying, "Well, I
[34:05] I PLANTED SOMETHING. I'M WANTING TO SEE
[34:06] I'M EXPECTING a yield from it. Ju don't
[34:10] bring to me your works
[34:12] &gt;&gt; and the yield of your own planting." And
[34:14] say, "Well, accept this as a
[34:15] substitute." He'll say, "Depart from me,
[34:16] ye that work iniquity."
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; So, he says, "And now go," and, this is
[34:20] the part that's really uh uh heavy. He
[34:22] says, "I will tell you what I will do to
[34:24] my vineyard. I will take away the heads
[34:26] thereof, and it shall be eaten up, and
[34:29] break down the wall thereof, and it
[34:30] shall be trotten down. And I will lay it
[34:32] waste. It shall not be pruned nor
[34:34] digged. But there shall come up briars
[34:36] and thorns. I also will also command the
[34:39] clouds that they rain not no rain upon
[34:41] it. There's the judgment
[34:44] judgment on the field, the planting that
[34:48] brought forth wild grapes when God was
[34:50] expecting fruitful grapes. Grapes that
[34:52] could be made into wine. And it gives
[34:55] this explanation. And I think even these
[34:57] things here tell us that the hedge is so
[34:59] that it's not eaten untimely. The wall
[35:02] is to keep it from being run over. The
[35:05] pruning, the digging is to keep the
[35:07] briars and thorns out. God sends the
[35:09] rain that it might grow. He says, "For
[35:11] the vineyard of the Lord of the hosts is
[35:12] the house of Israel and the men of
[35:14] Judah, his pleasant plant."
[35:18] See these beautiful these beautiful
[35:19] types in scripture. And he looked for
[35:21] judgment, but behold oppression. That's
[35:24] what James points out in James chapter
[35:26] 5. When you want to see righteousness
[35:28] and the treatment of the poor the right
[35:30] way, he looked for justice, judgment,
[35:31] discernment, but he saw oppression. He
[35:33] looked for righteousness, but behold,
[35:35] the cry, a cry of those that have been
[35:36] defrauded. When he wanted to see these
[35:39] peaceable fruits of righteousness, when
[35:41] he wanted TO SEE THIS UPRIGHT character
[35:42] and conduct, he didn't see it.
[35:44] Therefore, there's judgment upon the
[35:46] field because God, HE SAYS, "WHAT MORE
[35:48] COULD HAVE I DONE? WHAT MORE COULD HAVE
[35:50] I provided? But yet, I'm not getting the
[35:52] fruit that I should be getting from
[35:54] this." I believe these scriptures and
[35:56] just these few that we've covered there
[35:58] in these four different passages and
[35:59] these four different readings and
[36:01] especially this last one in Isaiah speak
[36:03] to us about the duty that we have as
[36:06] stewards over God's planting.
[36:09] Unless we just look at it solely as well
[36:11] the Lord's the one that plants alone.
[36:13] Let me just say that we are also have to
[36:16] give great care over what we're sewing
[36:17] and what we're planting.
[36:21] Just in our our our our last view here
[36:23] as we bring it to our closing thought,
[36:27] God established his garden in Eden or
[36:30] even this garden of Eden by his word.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; And by his word, these seeds were sown.
[36:37] And these seeds would bring forth, if
[36:38] you look in Genesis chapter 1, we'll
[36:39] read verses 11 and 12, they would bring
[36:42] forth fruit. And he gave the fruit of it
[36:44] to man for food
[36:46] &gt;&gt; to enjoy.
[36:48] Verse 11. And God said, "Let the earth
[36:50] bring forth grass, the herb yielding
[36:52] seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit
[36:54] after his kind, whose seed is in itself
[36:58] after his kind, his seed is in itself."
[37:00] Grass and herb yielding seed after his
[37:02] kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose
[37:04] seed was in itself after his kind, that
[37:06] seed that was in itself was would
[37:09] propagate again. You recognize that the
[37:12] fruit is the fleshly part around the
[37:14] seed. So the fruit is attractive.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; For what purpose? It's even for the
[37:20] purpose of reproduction.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; If the flesh doesn't have any use, you
[37:24] you may not want to plant the seed
[37:26] again.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want that. That kills you
[37:28] if you eat it. Or maybe I'll plant it
[37:30] strategically so that when someone comes
[37:32] and tries to steal my grapes, they eat
[37:34] wild poison and they die. And so there's
[37:37] something to there's a utility to the
[37:39] flesh of the fruit even in nature that
[37:41] the flesh of the fruit is what causes uh
[37:44] uh birds and animals to go and they eat
[37:46] the flesh and what happens the seeds get
[37:48] scattered behind and what comes back
[37:50] planting it brings forth trees it brings
[37:53] forth fruit and God sees this process
[37:56] and he sees that it's good.
[38:00] I want you to just recognize this PR or
[38:02] what I'm wanting to express uh u is God
[38:06] brought forth an Eden by his word.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; In the sermon Satan's Eden, brother
[38:12] Bradom, catch that title, Satan's Eden.
[38:14] He said, "Having faith in all his word,
[38:15] his seeds, God brought a Eden of
[38:17] holiness, love, and eternal life."
[38:20] That's what God's Eden produced,
[38:22] holiness. It brought an Eden of
[38:24] holiness, love, understanding,
[38:26] perfection, and eternal life. That's
[38:28] what God produces.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; That that's the that's the measure of
[38:32] the thing that God wants to bring forth.
[38:34] And he says that's what God is planting
[38:37] his word, his seed. That's what his
[38:40] church will be at the end. It'll be the
[38:42] same thing. So when God planted a garden
[38:45] of Eden in the beginning, it was in Eden
[38:47] of holiness and Eden of righteousness.
[38:48] It was to bring forth fruit. He put man
[38:50] there to watch out over it. See, this is
[38:52] what happens. Each seed bringing after
[38:53] its kind. man was to be fruitful,
[38:55] multiply, replenish the earth, and
[38:56] subdue the earth and enjoy the fruits of
[38:59] that garden, not to delay its growth or
[39:02] remove its growth, but to enjoy the
[39:03] fruits thereof. And now God has planted
[39:06] again in a spiritual sense a garden of
[39:08] Eden
[39:09] &gt;&gt; by his word. And that's what you are in
[39:11] the end is to be a fruitful garden.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; But not this. I don't want this to be
[39:16] kind of a dark turn, but we're living in
[39:18] a wasteland far removed from the Eden
[39:20] that God planted. Yes,
[39:21] &gt;&gt; we're not in an Eden condition anymore
[39:23] where even in in the fall when man was
[39:26] banished, it's saying it's not going to
[39:27] yield like it used to.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 2:es 1:3
[39:32] speaking to those who've been elect to a
[39:34] new birth and you hath he quickened who
[39:36] were dead in trespasses and sin. When
[39:39] when in times past you walked according
[39:40] to the course of this world, according
[39:44] to the prince of the power of the air,
[39:45] the spirit that now workketh in the
[39:47] children of disobedience, among whom
[39:49] whom also all we all had our
[39:51] conversation in times past in the lust
[39:53] of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of
[39:55] the flesh and of the mind, and were by
[39:57] nature the children of wrath, even as
[39:59] others.
[40:01] I if if I could point this out, you have
[40:04] been quickened to new life. That means
[40:06] there's a different nature.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; You're no longer uh under the same
[40:11] influence as that spirit that works on
[40:13] the children of disobedience. So now you
[40:16] had this you live this life in the lust
[40:17] of the flesh and you fulfilled the
[40:19] desires of the flesh and the mind
[40:20] because you had the nature that was
[40:22] given to you through a natural birth.
[40:23] But now having been born again, there's
[40:25] a new nature inside of you. YOU'VE BEEN
[40:26] QUICKENED NOW OUT OF YOUR sins and
[40:29] trespasses. There's new new creatures in
[40:31] Christ Jesus.
[40:33] And and that's the promise to those that
[40:35] are born again. But it says the course
[40:37] of this world according to the prince of
[40:40] the power of the air. Who is he talking
[40:41] about? Satan
[40:44] &gt;&gt; or as the young people say Satan. Now I
[40:46] think is what they say
[40:48] because I said it once and now I guess
[40:50] it's kind of a a thing. But there is
[40:53] that's who did it. The course of this
[40:56] world. It's the product of this unholy
[40:58] influence.
[41:00] The prince of the power of the air. the
[41:01] spirit that now works and children
[41:02] disobedience causing them to satisfy the
[41:04] desires of the flesh and the mind.
[41:08] So the course of this world, that's not
[41:10] the course of God's original planting.
[41:12] That's a deformed perverted course. In 2
[41:15] Corinthians chapter 4:4, in whom the God
[41:17] of this world says that if the gospel be
[41:20] hid, it's hid to them that are lost is
[41:22] what he's saying.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; The lost in whom the God of this world
[41:25] hath blinded the minds of them which
[41:27] believe not, lest the light of the
[41:28] glorious gospel of Christ who is in the
[41:30] image of God should shine unto them. He
[41:33] calls him the god of this world. Who is
[41:36] it? It's the devil who is the god of
[41:38] this evil age.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Is the devil who has brought forth his
[41:42] own Eden
[41:44] by deforming
[41:46] &gt;&gt; by hybriding is maybe how we can even
[41:49] see that God gave very clear
[41:51] instructions that each seed in itself
[41:54] would bring forth of its kind. But then
[41:56] it's through mixing of the seeds which
[41:57] was pro prohibited even in the in the
[42:00] law. It would bring forth something
[42:02] other than the original that couldn't
[42:04] bring forth of itself.
[42:06] or couldn't bring it couldn't you
[42:07] couldn't bring back out of that the
[42:09] original once it had been mixed and here
[42:11] we see the god of this evil age creating
[42:14] this this lessa as we would call it this
[42:17] dark world that we're living in AND JUST
[42:19] BY FAITH GOD BY FAITH IN HIS OWN WORDS
[42:21] BROUGHT FORTH an eden now unbelief in
[42:23] God's word brings forth this seed of
[42:25] unholiness in the last age
[42:31] shortly after brother Brandham
[42:32] ministered that sermon on
[42:35] Satan's Eden. He spoke on thirst. He
[42:36] said God took 6,000 years and made a
[42:38] perfect Eden. Well, you could argue with
[42:41] that and say, "Well, wouldn't God just
[42:42] be able to do it like that?" Yeah, he
[42:44] could. But what did he want to do?
[42:46] Express himself in creation.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; He's a God of process. He makes
[42:50] everything beautiful in its time,
[42:52] &gt;&gt; in his time.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; We said, "God, just do it all perfect
[42:56] and powerful at once." Well, let's just
[42:58] say if he did that, wouldn't we all just
[43:00] leave tonight and say, "Well, he ain't
[43:02] started yet."
[43:04] Or would I be the only one? Marvin,
[43:06] maybe you and I, we could go to In-N-Out
[43:08] and enjoy a burger and talk about, "Hey,
[43:09] he began a good work in me, but I ain't
[43:11] perfect and all powerful yet."
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Right? If if that's the work that God
[43:15] did in the beginning in one moment,
[43:17] everything was perfect and we felt it
[43:19] and could do it and operate according to
[43:21] it. If that's the way God did it, we'd
[43:23] all look at each other and say, "Man, I
[43:24] don't have it yet, but I sure really
[43:26] want to be like brother Elliott." Hey,
[43:29] you just take catching strays, Brother
[43:30] Elliot. I I'm sorry. We all think of
[43:33] that one who's they just seem perfect,
[43:35] but nobody's perfect on the first shot.
[43:38] God's a god of process. But he says,
[43:40] Satan come over and sprayed those seeds
[43:42] and deformed them. Now, Satan has had
[43:44] 6,000 years and he's built his own
[43:46] scientific Eden, and it's right back on
[43:49] perversion.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "This is the age of hybriding."
[43:53] What do we see even more over and over
[43:55] and over again? Ultrarocessed foods. You
[43:58] know, it's getting bad when Texas is
[44:00] banning something, right? Ultrarocessed
[44:03] foods are killing you. Hybriding is
[44:06] killing.
[44:08] And he says it's even gotten in the
[44:09] churches today till they're hybrid.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; They get in there and they just go to
[44:14] church. He says it becomes a lodge
[44:15] instead of a church. Church is a place
[44:18] where people come together and worship
[44:20] God in spirit and in truth. And today
[44:22] it's a lodge.
[44:24] We go there and have a little time to
[44:26] shake hands, fellowship, and some black
[44:27] coffee in the back of the building. I
[44:29] know some of you are saying, "Amen,
[44:31] black coffee."
[44:33] But you might as well said macchiatoos
[44:35] and frappuccinos and lattes and
[44:37] everything else and your matcha with oat
[44:39] milk and lavender.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Did someone say yuck
[44:48] then GO HOME TILL NEXT WEEK AND WE DONE
[44:50] OUR religious duty? He says, "Now it's a
[44:52] perverted age." Kind of like matcha.
[44:56] He says, "Satan's perverting th these
[44:58] thirsts that God put in you to thirst,
[45:01] Satan is perverting them."
[45:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; You know, God gave you a desire to plant
[45:06] and to cultivate life.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; That's one of the powers given to the
[45:10] church, even this power of of life,
[45:13] &gt;&gt; and he perverts it.
[45:15] He's given you a desire to look after,
[45:17] to care for life, and we project it to
[45:20] all the all so many different things
[45:24] to things that aren't even real, things
[45:26] that are virtual. I remember uh brother
[45:28] David when he was ministering a couple
[45:29] weeks ago talked about how just engaging
[45:31] these games could be and just how much
[45:33] it takes up the minds of the of the
[45:35] youth and they're pouring themselves
[45:36] into these games and then you forget
[45:38] your login or you get your account
[45:40] blocked, boom, your life is over,
[45:43] &gt;&gt; right? It's all gone.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Everything you've worked for is gone in
[45:46] just a moment. And we're taking this
[45:49] energy that God's given us to real life
[45:50] that we could give towards real life and
[45:52] he's perverting these thirst.
[45:55] And you live in Satan's Eden. He's the
[45:56] God of this evil age. He's a deformer.
[45:58] He's a perverter. And you have inside of
[46:01] you the planting of eternity. I say this
[46:03] to all of us. You have inside of you the
[46:05] planting of eternity with the calling to
[46:07] look out after that,
[46:08] &gt;&gt; to bring forth fruit that you can enjoy,
[46:11] others can enjoy. But most of all that
[46:13] God can be glorified in.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Each one of us have that responsibility.
[46:17] Now if we could look at it from the
[46:18] responsibility we have as parents, we
[46:20] look at our children say that is a
[46:22] field. That is a garden. And I have a
[46:24] responsibility to that garden to see
[46:26] that I watch out over it and care for
[46:27] it. So that God who sends the rain, the
[46:29] God that will deal with that heart, that
[46:31] at the right time that planting of
[46:33] eternity can come forth.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's not as many briars and
[46:37] thorns and complexes and scars and
[46:39] hedges being torn down, but that it can
[46:41] come forth and burst forth into new
[46:43] life.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; And be fruitful.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; I close with the familiar scripture to
[46:49] us here at this church who've been here
[46:51] for some time as we used uh a subject
[46:53] years ago on our family tree. We use
[46:55] Genesis 21:es 33-34.
[46:59] The scripture means a lot to me. I
[47:01] appreciate brother Scott who gave me
[47:03] this Essel tree, this tamarisk where it
[47:05] says a grove here. It's a tree. I have
[47:07] one that's growing in my office recently
[47:10] planted. It's going through shock. Pray
[47:11] for it, brother Scott.
[47:14] It was just in a a a vessel with water
[47:17] with clear instructions to water it, to
[47:19] feed it, to watch out over it. It was
[47:20] doing great. Came time to plant it.
[47:23] Went on vacation, got a little dry, but
[47:27] it looks like there's life growing. It's
[47:29] green. One side's a little sad, the
[47:32] other side's happy.
[47:34] Now that I think of it, it's the side
[47:35] that faces me that's sad. It's the side
[47:37] that faces the sun that's happy.
[47:42] It says, "Abraham planted a grove in
[47:45] Beeba." Beeba is described as a
[47:47] wilderness
[47:49] and called there on the name of the
[47:50] Lord. We saw how it meant and God the
[47:52] name of God was invoked there in that
[47:54] garden in that grove. He worshiped God
[47:56] from there. And it says, "And Abraham
[47:57] soldiered in the Philistines land many
[47:59] many days. He took his abode in the
[48:02] Philistines land. He lived in the
[48:05] wilderness, dwelt, he inhabited it. It
[48:07] means he he was continued there. Here we
[48:11] know we have no continuing city, but
[48:13] we've made our home here in the valley.
[48:15] We live in Arizona. We're here until God
[48:17] takes us home. So, we're souljouring in
[48:20] Leodysia. We're sojouring in the world,
[48:22] in this Satan's Eden, in this fallen uh
[48:25] fallen world. But it says Abraham
[48:28] planted a grove. This planting is this
[48:30] act of establishing or fixing just as
[48:32] God had planted a garden in Eden.
[48:35] Abraham's creating a garden just as God
[48:38] did. And if I could just point this out
[48:40] in closing, he's not planting a garden
[48:43] in paradise.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; He's doing it in Beerseba.
[48:49] He's planting A GARDEN THAT ITSELF WILL
[48:51] BE A PARADISE. HE'S NOT PLANTING a
[48:54] garden in Eden. He's planting a garden
[48:56] in Beerseba to be in Eden. Right?
[48:59] &gt;&gt; He's doing this in the image of God.
[49:00] He's doing it in contradiction to the
[49:02] barrenness and the godlessness of all
[49:04] those that surrounded him. Philistines
[49:06] weren't calling on God.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Beha wasn't in Eden.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; But what God what Abraham does is he
[49:12] plants a tree in the desert.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; It's the beginning of a grove or a
[49:17] garden that God's name IS GOING TO BE
[49:18] GLORIFIED. He could BE HOSPITABLE TO
[49:20] TRAVELERS AND those that are thirsty and
[49:22] those that ARE WEARY. AND HE DOES IT IN
[49:24] CONTRADICTION TO THE GODLESS
[49:25] PHILISTINES. HE DOES IT IN CONTRADICTION
[49:27] to the barren wilderness.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; And there that garden became a place
[49:31] that Abraham worshiped God in the
[49:34] presence of those that did not believe
[49:35] in God.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; We could see it as an act of stewardship
[49:39] over the land that God had promised him.
[49:41] I give you this land. You say, "Well,
[49:43] this land's a wasteland. It's barren.
[49:45] Change it."
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Well, it's so dry and hot in Arizona and
[49:51] it's so people are godless and there's
[49:53] no CHRISTIANS AT WALMART. WELL, I
[49:55] THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING.
[49:57] YOU'VE JUST INDICTED YOURSELF. THAT'S
[49:59] WHY I JUST do uh have all my groceries
[50:02] done by Door Dash and I get all my food
[50:04] through Uber Eats because there's no
[50:06] Christians anywhere. YOU BE THE ONE.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; It was an act of stewardship over the
[50:12] land that God promised. Do you realize
[50:13] we're going to come back here and rule
[50:15] and reign?
[50:16] &gt;&gt; So, right now, we can give this act of
[50:18] stewardship over the land that God gave
[50:20] us. Amen.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; And he's not just planting
[50:23] um a tree and all anxiously waiting. He
[50:26] does it with a vision.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Because he knows one day it'll provide
[50:29] shade.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; One day they'll be protect it'll provide
[50:32] protection. It'll provide fruit. It'll
[50:34] bring joy.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Musicians, if you could come to your
[50:37] instruments, we should be faithful. Let
[50:40] us be faithful then to sew.
[50:42] be careful we're sewing good seed,
[50:44] complimentary seed,
[50:47] &gt;&gt; and that we're given the right kind of
[50:48] nurture to that which has been sown.
[50:51] We all have different stages in life. We
[50:54] have an opportunity to raise our
[50:56] children, but there'll come a point
[50:57] where they're going to be influenced
[50:58] more by the society and the world
[51:00] they're raised in than us.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; That's why children resemble their
[51:03] times, not their fathers,
[51:06] because of the influence that the time
[51:08] and the age has on them. You want to be
[51:10] sure that in the time that you have that
[51:11] you're cultivating them so that though
[51:13] they may look different than you because
[51:15] of the generations of the time, they can
[51:17] have a legacy of Christlike character
[51:20] and they can have the kind of character
[51:22] that you have, they can have the kind of
[51:23] fruits of the spirit that you enjoyed.
[51:26] And I believe that we can in Satan's
[51:29] Eden bring forth a garden of God's
[51:31] delight.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Remember a few months ago, we preached
[51:34] wasteland.
[51:35] It's been a continuation of that thought
[51:37] that this is a wasteland we're living
[51:38] in. But God has planted eternity inside
[51:41] of you.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; So that you could be that which blooms
[51:43] in the desert.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; The desert will break forth. It'll
[51:48] bloom. Behold, I do a new thing. There's
[51:50] going to be rivers of waters flowing out
[51:52] from you.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Can be fruitfulness. Where? Where? I'm
[51:56] looking everywhere. I'm trying to see
[51:57] you.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; You can be the one that's fruitful.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; And we have to take it serious. Maybe
[52:03] I've used a lot of shadows and types in
[52:05] a language that implies, you know,
[52:07] gardening. And we're just looking at
[52:08] these scriptures so you can be
[52:09] established in the word of God that
[52:11] these are the things he teaches. But you
[52:12] must take it seriously what's being swn
[52:15] into your spirit.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Remember the the the belly for the meats
[52:20] and the meats for the belly.
[52:22] That there's a natural food for your
[52:24] belly. What food are you giving your
[52:27] spirit?
[52:28] &gt;&gt; I eat a lot so I gain weight. I get
[52:30] bigger. I grow. All those things that
[52:32] happens just through the process of
[52:34] digesting nutrients and calories working
[52:36] together with your genetics to produce a
[52:38] physical image. Do you realize your
[52:41] spirits are a reflection of how you've
[52:44] been feeding it?
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[52:46] &gt;&gt; And if God could give some sort of
[52:47] spiritual counsel and you say, "Wow, you
[52:49] need to you need to restrict these
[52:51] calories. You're eating too many worldly
[52:52] carbs.
[52:54] You have way too much of that in your
[52:56] diet. You have way too much of that."
[52:57] And it's expressing itself in these
[52:59] spiritual feelings and these anxieties
[53:02] because there's these deficiencies or
[53:04] there's too much of this and too much of
[53:06] that. And it gets down to very literally
[53:08] what you're feeding on, what you're
[53:10] reading, what you're watching, what
[53:12] you're desiring for because that's
[53:14] what's sewn into your spiritual garden.
[53:18] We have to take care of over of that. We
[53:20] have to watch over that.
[53:23] All right. But I want to I want to
[53:26] sew the word to that eternal planting.
[53:29] Feed on the word of God. Pray, read my
[53:31] Bible, listen to the message of God. I
[53:33] want to feed that eternity inside of me.
[53:35] And then I want to look at my children
[53:36] and I say, "Lord, I can't take
[53:39] everything away. I'm I'm not just by
[53:41] putting up hedges and building walls and
[53:43] putting up towers and getting all the
[53:45] rocks out. That's not going to be
[53:47] enough.
[53:49] I need to water and sew and nurture the
[53:52] planting of eternity
[53:55] so that we could see that God would do
[53:57] the same for them that he's done for us.
[53:58] That's my prayer for my children is I
[54:00] want them to meet the same God that I
[54:01] met. It's my prayer for those that are
[54:04] being baptized this Sunday that they
[54:05] meet the God that you've met
[54:07] &gt;&gt; because I believe that God's still in
[54:09] the business of saving souls.
[54:11] And so let's be faithful gardeners. this
[54:14] art of gardening.
[54:16] That's a green thumbs up.
[54:18] Let's be faithful to this word of God
[54:20] that we could see the fruits of what
[54:22] he's planted because the Lord will bring
[54:24] it forth. We could stand together this
[54:26] evening. Thank you for your patience
[54:28] tonight.
[54:30] Our gracious heavenly father, tonight,
[54:31] Lord, as we close this service, I do
[54:34] believe that your presence is with us
[54:37] and that your your heart is for us. The
[54:40] devil many times gets us to look at
[54:43] circumstances and events in our lives so
[54:45] that we could think that you're angry
[54:46] with us, you're mad at us, and that
[54:48] you're done with us, and that you're not
[54:49] for us. But truly, Lord, any purging or
[54:52] any distance we may feel from you or any
[54:55] correction.
[54:57] You're doing it all with the purpose of
[54:59] causing us to be fruitful.
[55:03] And Lord, in fellowshipping with a
[55:04] friend here recently and just sensing a
[55:06] a heaviness in their hearts,
[55:09] I I recognize in my life when I was
[55:11] really suffering, my biggest regret is I
[55:13] didn't trust you.
[55:16] And Lord, if we're suffering, if we're
[55:18] anxious, if we're going through a
[55:19] difficult time, may we trust that you're
[55:22] still yet working all things for good.
[55:25] And may our hearts be to the harvest.
[55:28] Not the harshness of summer, not the
[55:30] difficulty of the pruning, not the
[55:32] uncomfortableness of the donging or the
[55:34] digging, but may our minds be on the
[55:37] harvest
[55:39] that we would with patience wait for
[55:41] that fruitfulness that we know is to
[55:43] come. Because Lord, I believe that you
[55:45] have planted seeds of eternity and in
[55:49] this last days in this barrenness of
[55:51] Satan's Eden, the God of this evil age
[55:54] working in ways that he is trying to
[55:58] snuff out light and bring confusion and
[56:00] perversion. Lord, there will be another
[56:02] Garden of Eden. Break forth. Be fruitful
[56:06] with your nature and your character in
[56:08] your life.
[56:10] I'm speaking to
[56:12] those trees of this great garden.
[56:15] May we be more fruitful in these things.
[56:17] Lord, we commit ourselves to you and we
[56:20] pray that you'd give us grace in these
[56:21] things. Give us wisdom. In the name of
[56:23] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[56:25] Amen.
