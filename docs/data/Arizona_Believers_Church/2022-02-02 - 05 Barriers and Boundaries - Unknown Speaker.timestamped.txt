[0:00] galatians chapter 6 verses
[0:03] 1 to 10
[0:04] brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[0:06] fault ye which are spiritual restore
[0:08] such a one
[0:10] in the spirit of meekness considering
[0:12] thyself lest thou also be tempted bear
[0:15] you one another's burdens and so fulfill
[0:16] the law of christ
[0:18] for man think himself to be something
[0:20] when he has nothing he deceiveth himself
[0:22] but let every man prove his own work
[0:24] then shall he have rejoicing in himself
[0:26] alone and not in another for every man
[0:29] shall bear his own burden
[0:30] let him that is taught in the word
[0:32] communicate unto him that teacheth in
[0:33] all good things
[0:35] be not deceived god is not mocked for
[0:37] whatsoever man soweth that shall you
[0:38] also reap for he that soweth his flesh
[0:41] will of the flesh reap corruption but he
[0:42] that soweth to the spirit
[0:44] shall of the spirit reap life
[0:46] everlasting this is a labor and this is
[0:48] a work and all these things are building
[0:50] even to this verse and let us not be
[0:52] weary in well doing for in due season we
[0:55] shall reap if we faint not so that's the
[0:57] admonition to persevere and as we have
[0:59] therefore opportunity let us do good
[1:01] unto all men especially unto them who
[1:03] are of
[1:04] the household of faith so we are
[1:06] admonished to do good unto all men that
[1:09] that way our days are do not consist of
[1:11] trying to find out who's good and who's
[1:13] bad who we can be good to who we don't
[1:15] have to be good to but do good unto all
[1:17] men especially those of the household of
[1:19] faith you can be seated
[1:22] i have a lot that i'd like to get to
[1:24] this evening so we're
[1:26] going to jump right into it and as i
[1:28] look out upon
[1:29] the congregation tonight i see that most
[1:31] of you have been with us in this subject
[1:34] matter so far on barriers and boundaries
[1:37] and then
[1:38] which we could say just even
[1:40] backgrounding that there's a difference
[1:42] between a boundary a boundary expresses
[1:44] the limits of something and how far
[1:46] something reaches whereas a barrier
[1:47] would be an obstacle or a hindrance
[1:50] and we looked at on sunday on the pride
[1:53] paradox and i want to go further in this
[1:55] subject matter not sure if we'll get as
[1:57] far as i'd like to tonight or just
[1:59] exactly how the lord would lead i'm just
[2:01] taking a uh
[2:03] exhaling and just going to relax and
[2:06] share what's in my heart but we want to
[2:08] continue on this subject and we kind of
[2:10] identified on sunday how pride can be
[2:13] both a boundary and a barrier there can
[2:15] be an upside to it a downside to it and
[2:17] i think maybe
[2:19] the idea that there can be a good pride
[2:21] may seem foreign to some of us but i
[2:22] think we're
[2:24] zeroing in on that and hopefully
[2:26] understanding a little bit better in
[2:27] terms of a godly jealousy there's a way
[2:29] that we could have certain feelings and
[2:30] emotions that have a positive aspect to
[2:33] it and pride in its truest sense isn't
[2:35] always negative or wrong
[2:38] but in pride it can both hinder us and
[2:40] that would be the bad side or it can
[2:42] help us and that's the positive positive
[2:44] pride that we're talking about
[2:46] and where we were
[2:48] ending on sunday is some statements
[2:50] where brother brown was saying stay in
[2:52] your territory using that exact language
[2:54] that phrase you have to stay in your
[2:55] territory and so that's a place that god
[2:57] has called us to it's a jurisdiction
[2:59] something we have control over as the
[3:01] children of israel were being placed in
[3:03] the promised land it was like you belong
[3:05] here to this mountain city to this area
[3:08] to this region and it was they were to
[3:10] stay in their territory to stay in their
[3:12] place
[3:13] and so that's something that we're
[3:15] expressing to you tonight wanting to
[3:16] continue on and piggyback on that we
[3:19] have to stay in our territory as it was
[3:21] stay in our place
[3:23] and i'm just going to express this maybe
[3:25] now as i think about it and i'm just
[3:27] trying to
[3:28] rearrange my
[3:30] audio pack here just in case it could be
[3:31] the side that i'm placing it on if
[3:33] that's causing the signal to drop
[3:35] but um i'm going to take a unique
[3:37] approach tonight to scriptures that
[3:38] we're very familiar with
[3:40] and i'm trusting that in in referencing
[3:43] them and kind of bringing them into our
[3:45] conversation on this subject that you
[3:46] can allow the holy spirit to quicken
[3:48] these things to you uh because we want
[3:51] to bring these things up and maybe just
[3:53] add add some emphasis that might help
[3:55] you and i think it may be a little bit
[3:57] of a unique approach um so you might
[3:59] have to again just be very deliberate
[4:02] and
[4:02] and trying to
[4:04] uh
[4:05] kind of catch what god is wanting to say
[4:07] to you because i don't ever want to just
[4:09] think that you have to see it my way
[4:11] what i want you to do is see it the way
[4:12] god wants you to see it and so in
[4:15] proverbs chapter 7 21 i'm just going to
[4:17] start here
[4:18] and jump into the subject of pride and
[4:20] bring it from a more traditional
[4:22] viewpoint in terms of what pride is it
[4:24] says in proverbs 21 4 a high look and a
[4:26] proud heart and the plowing of the
[4:29] wicked is sin
[4:30] so a high look and a proud heart the
[4:33] bible is saying or sin and that's a
[4:35] haughtiness that's an arrogance
[4:37] it is when the bible says a high look
[4:39] and a proud heart it's speaking of a
[4:40] swollen estimate of oneself
[4:43] and one thing i want you to kind of
[4:44] catch in this when the bible's talking
[4:46] about a the nastiness of pride or pride
[4:48] that is nasty
[4:50] it's it's a place where you begin to
[4:52] think of yourself in such a way to where
[4:54] you look down upon everyone else and so
[4:56] on one hand it's good to think of
[4:58] yourself as you are that you have maybe
[5:00] some gifts or some talents or some
[5:02] calling or some position
[5:03] and so there to see yourself as
[5:06] appropriately and there be some be some
[5:08] value and worth there's one thing but
[5:10] where it kind of flips and you're seeing
[5:12] yourself the wrong way is it from that
[5:14] place of blessing and benefit you start
[5:16] looking down upon everyone else and
[5:18] that's what the bible's identifying as a
[5:20] bad pride is this looking down on others
[5:24] and seeing yourself as better than them
[5:26] in proverbs chapter 16 verse 18 it says
[5:29] pride goeth before destruction and a
[5:31] haughty spirit before a fall
[5:34] if you looked at the hebrew of these two
[5:36] words a pride and haughty spirit you'd
[5:39] find that in their use in other places
[5:42] they don't always take on a negative
[5:43] connotation and so if you just kind of
[5:45] had this word and said pride and used it
[5:47] maybe in the sense that a hebrew would
[5:49] your immediate thought wouldn't be oh
[5:51] destruction if you even used
[5:53] uh
[5:54] one of the
[5:55] the root of holy spirit you look at they
[5:57] think that maybe something's exalted or
[5:59] something's lifted you wouldn't
[6:00] necessarily immediately think just in
[6:02] that hebrew word alone that something
[6:05] a fall is going to take place but the
[6:07] context is narrowing the meaning of
[6:09] these words pride and i don't think
[6:11] there's a way that you could use haughty
[6:12] spirit in a positive context like man
[6:14] i'm really proud of your holy spirit and
[6:16] so it's just the way that it's
[6:17] translated kind of puts it in the
[6:19] context that it's meant pride in a holy
[6:21] spirit it's showing us there's an
[6:23] arrogance there
[6:24] and so pride goes before destruction
[6:26] holy spirit before a fall the context is
[6:29] telling us there's an attitude there's a
[6:31] thought process there's a way that you
[6:32] can be yourself that is negative and
[6:35] detrimental and that's the bible's
[6:36] narrowing in on this
[6:38] in james chapter 4 verse 6 speaking of
[6:41] god but he giveth more grace wherefore
[6:43] he saith god resisteth the proud but
[6:46] giveth grace unto the humble so god is
[6:48] going to give grace to the humble a
[6:50] broken and contrite spirit he'll not
[6:52] despise and so this is the lifting up of
[6:55] a brokenness it's lifting up of someone
[6:57] who has a modest estimation of their
[6:59] self but it says god resist the proud i
[7:02] just think of that how pride is a
[7:04] barrier to god dealing with you or a
[7:07] boundary that god won't cross it becomes
[7:09] a barrier to you receiving his presence
[7:11] and how that that pride is something has
[7:13] to be torn down something that god has
[7:15] to address to
[7:16] which keeps him from enveloping us and
[7:18] blessing us because he resists the proud
[7:21] but this is what if you just looked up
[7:22] the definition and the the greek lexicon
[7:26] for proud it's showing oneself above
[7:28] others
[7:29] actually says over topping so someone is
[7:31] always wanting to outdo somebody else
[7:33] someone tells a story and it's like oh i
[7:34] got a better one you know it's somebody
[7:37] you know somebody's somebody's family
[7:39] member just died it's like well when my
[7:41] mom died and all it is is about their
[7:42] grief and what they're going through
[7:44] that can be an evidence of pride there's
[7:46] always this overtopping out doing so
[7:48] showing oneself above others over
[7:50] topping
[7:51] conspicuous wanting to be conspicuous
[7:53] above others look at me
[7:55] to have the preeminence
[7:56] and it says with an overweening estimate
[8:00] and over when it means an excessive
[8:01] pride and excessive confidence in others
[8:03] it's not appropriate an overweening
[8:04] estimate of one's means or merits just
[8:08] also despising sort of the
[8:10] overestimation of one's means their
[8:12] abilities their gifts their talents or
[8:13] their merits what they've accomplished
[8:15] or despising others or even treating
[8:18] them with contempt hardiness
[8:20] this is what the bible says that it god
[8:23] resists the proud so this isn't uh
[8:26] rejoicing in something this isn't being
[8:27] proud of your children or or you you did
[8:30] a good job and thinking it to be worthy
[8:32] of something it's a very specific
[8:34] mindset it's a pride is synonymous with
[8:37] vanity or vainglory it's an empty
[8:38] pretender it's somebody who boasts and
[8:41] it's just a vanity because there's
[8:42] really nothing there
[8:44] and so we could put it this way that
[8:46] there is a we've talked about a good
[8:48] pride on sunday and where this thought
[8:50] process
[8:52] uh veers into something that's
[8:53] detrimental or destructive is when it
[8:55] goes beyond a proper boundary you could
[8:58] think well of yourself and think highly
[8:59] of yourself but you begin to you cross
[9:02] the boundary of thinking that you're
[9:03] better than somebody else because of
[9:04] that or you cross this boundary and
[9:06] think more of yourself than you actually
[9:08] are that's when you've gone from
[9:09] something that could be healthy very
[9:11] healthy thought process into this
[9:13] baseless empty vein
[9:16] destructive thought process
[9:18] that the scriptures are identified in
[9:19] proverbs 21 proverbs 16 chapter 4 and
[9:23] countless other scriptures that we could
[9:25] use to zero in on the nastiness of pride
[9:29] and i feel that we hear a lot about that
[9:31] kind of pride right when we all agree we
[9:33] hear a lot about that pride so we maybe
[9:35] don't need to reinforce that
[9:37] but i do think it's necessary to
[9:39] emphasize a little bit as we're trying
[9:40] to contrast it with good pride but then
[9:43] put it in the context of barriers and
[9:45] boundaries
[9:46] and a a bad pride doesn't respect
[9:50] boundaries
[9:51] if someone has a haughtiness
[9:52] your your
[9:55] your boundary is a barrier to them
[9:58] they'll look at that and they don't have
[9:59] respect for that well that limits them
[10:01] that keeps them from saying what they
[10:02] want to say that keeps them from doing
[10:03] what they want to do or that that's kind
[10:05] of walled you off from them and they'll
[10:07] perceive it a certain way and so a bad
[10:09] pride doesn't respect boundaries and
[10:12] i i'm just saying this and trusting that
[10:14] it resonates within your heart someone
[10:16] who's arrogant and has pride is
[10:17] impulsive
[10:19] because the only thing they're answering
[10:20] to is their needs the only thing they're
[10:21] answering to is their desires the only
[10:23] thing they're answering to is this sense
[10:24] of self and if me wants it me gets it
[10:26] right
[10:27] if it's something they desire something
[10:29] they think they ought to have so bad
[10:30] pride is very impulsive
[10:32] and bad pride always acts with the self
[10:36] in view so bad pride is self-preserving
[10:39] so i'm going to act to preserve myself
[10:41] and it's also self-protecting i'm going
[10:44] to do something to protect myself
[10:46] and this is something that uh
[10:48] in itself is a is a barrier
[10:52] uh and acts against someone's even good
[10:54] intentions
[10:56] and and i'm i hopefully can
[10:58] touch on it maybe later
[11:00] and i'm just kind of glancing here on
[11:02] some of my scriptures just to know
[11:03] whether or not i could maybe insert this
[11:06] later on
[11:07] but there's times when we act and we
[11:10] think that we're acting out of someone
[11:12] else's benefit but we're actually doing
[11:13] it for our own selves
[11:16] and it's really easy to justify a
[11:18] service a labor a given a word an
[11:20] intrusion you say well i'm doing it for
[11:23] them
[11:24] i'm doing it for you and not realizing
[11:26] that what we're really trying to do is
[11:28] pat ourselves on the back or appease our
[11:30] own conscience or do something for
[11:31] ourselves and so we've justified a
[11:33] behavior we've justified something we've
[11:35] said we justified
[11:37] even a conduct or even a certain
[11:38] discipline because it's for somebody
[11:40] else but not realizing really in reality
[11:44] it's more feeding our pride and our
[11:45] sense of accomplishment our own merits
[11:47] or our own abilities our own means so
[11:50] it's something just to keep in mind if
[11:52] we don't touch on it later
[11:54] and so if we look at humility antithesis
[11:56] to pride that you have pride but then
[11:58] you have this humility humility respect
[12:01] boundaries
[12:02] uh if you have the ability to do
[12:04] something and you have power you have
[12:05] strength you have opportunity
[12:08] and you have privilege
[12:10] if you have humility with that then
[12:12] you'll respect somebody else's boundary
[12:13] even though you have power to bypass it
[12:15] or the right to do so
[12:18] because humility will allow you to do
[12:20] something one thing we have to remember
[12:22] that as a christian we never do
[12:23] something out of power privilege or
[12:25] opportunity that we can otherwise
[12:27] accomplish by the word and humility
[12:29] just because you can do it doesn't mean
[12:30] you need to do it just because you have
[12:32] the power the opportunity the privilege
[12:34] to do something don't do it by those
[12:37] means when you can do the same thing
[12:38] through the word and humility
[12:40] and so humility which is the opposite of
[12:42] pride will respect boundaries
[12:44] and and with humility even if you look
[12:47] at the definition of humility it's the
[12:48] lack of false pride
[12:51] because there can be a pride that's
[12:52] false a pride that is is arrogant and
[12:54] self-serving and beyond the natural
[12:56] bounds and beyond what is reasonable and
[12:58] so humility itself is modesty and
[13:00] attitude modesty and spirit that's kind
[13:02] of what is thought of in terms of
[13:04] humility
[13:05] and again
[13:06] humility is different than poverty
[13:10] because you could you look at somebody
[13:11] and they're broke and they don't have
[13:12] anything so oh he's humble
[13:14] well no he's broke
[13:16] you look at somebody's very very weak
[13:18] and can't fend for themselves and and
[13:20] they don't have any power they don't
[13:21] have they don't have this they don't
[13:23] have that they don't have means they
[13:24] don't have opportunity they don't have
[13:25] privilege and those things you say oh
[13:26] well he's real humble well that could
[13:28] just be something that's been stripped
[13:29] of everything
[13:31] and so it's not just in that alone but
[13:33] it's a modesty
[13:35] that uh is coming from a sense of
[13:38] it's even a modesty that may seem
[13:40] incongruent with what they actually have
[13:42] i hope that you can understand what i'm
[13:44] trying to say
[13:45] that when you we often are going to say
[13:47] somebody's humble when we in our minds
[13:50] we think they have every right to act
[13:51] the opposite
[13:53] somebody who's not always flaunting
[13:55] their wealth and we're like man they
[13:56] could but look at how they live or
[13:58] somebody who could always be inserting
[13:59] themselves they could but look at how
[14:01] they act maybe you're in a situation
[14:02] where people are talking about something
[14:04] and somebody's going on and on about a
[14:06] particular subject and this person is
[14:08] just running their mouth telling you
[14:09] everything you know and you're kind of
[14:10] looking at the guy who's the expert like
[14:12] this guy spent like 12 years on this you
[14:15] know he's a doctor like this guy knows
[14:17] what he's and he never never says
[14:19] anything and just oh wow that's
[14:21] interesting that's really neat that you
[14:22] say that because the people how many
[14:24] have heard the story before someone's
[14:25] got some real hot sports opinions about
[14:27] something they're going on and on about
[14:28] something and they're talking to the
[14:29] very person who wrote the book
[14:31] they're talking about the very person
[14:32] who who came up with the idea the very
[14:34] one that uh the very one that is the the
[14:37] progenitor of an idea i had a professor
[14:40] in law school who was um he's such a
[14:42] brilliant uh professor
[14:44] brilliant um legal scholar he's called
[14:46] the god of texas trial law
[14:49] and people would actually call the law
[14:51] school just to see if the guy was real
[14:52] is there really a guy named dorsenio
[14:54] and uh and i interned for him at one
[14:56] time and he's a very brilliant person
[14:58] and he's such a brilliant legal scholar
[14:59] that sometimes entities would put him on
[15:02] retainer just to keep him out of the
[15:03] fight
[15:04] like we want you on our side you're not
[15:06] gonna do a thing you're on retainer that
[15:07] way the other guys can't go and hire you
[15:09] and he's in an appellate argument one
[15:10] time and an attorney was making the
[15:12] argument says when the writers of this
[15:13] rule wrote this rule they meant exactly
[15:16] this and so it came his turn to talk and
[15:18] he says your honor i wrote that rule and
[15:20] i'll tell you what i meant when i wrote
[15:21] it
[15:23] and that's because god bless him
[15:24] professor der sanyo who just recently
[15:26] retired was not humble
[15:28] right he's going to let you know
[15:31] i wrote the rule and i'll tell you what
[15:32] i meant and so humility would be just to
[15:34] get up there and argue the opposite say
[15:36] well the writers of this rule meant this
[15:38] that and the other and then find out
[15:40] later oh he's the one that wrote it
[15:43] that makes sense what a kind of to
[15:45] understand humility a little bit better
[15:47] and so this a bad pride disrespects
[15:50] boundaries and becomes a barrier even to
[15:53] your good intentions
[15:55] and then um
[15:57] a good pride which is joined with
[16:00] humility
[16:01] is going to be what you need to set your
[16:03] own boundaries
[16:05] and that it just kind of dawned on me
[16:07] now i know where i'm going to end up
[16:08] where i'm going with this and so i'm
[16:10] kind of i'm not hiding the ball tonight
[16:12] that's what i'm wanting to emphasize
[16:13] tonight is how a good pride is what's
[16:15] actually going to help you set
[16:16] boundaries
[16:18] it's going to what causes you to say
[16:19] this is enough
[16:20] but then it's also going to be what
[16:22] causes you to persevere beyond barriers
[16:26] and and that's when paul says be not
[16:27] weary and well doing we're talking about
[16:29] uh we looked at how brother graham
[16:30] identified this great characteristic of
[16:32] being perseverant
[16:33] it's a good pride that makes us
[16:35] persevere it's a good pride that makes
[16:36] us to be persistent it's a good pride
[16:38] that will cause us to keep knocking up
[16:40] against a barrier something in our way
[16:42] until we beat it
[16:43] and we don't shriek back and oh i'm not
[16:45] going to do it i'm a failure it takes a
[16:47] little bit of that persistence and a
[16:48] good pride to do it
[16:50] now i'm going very very slow tonight
[16:53] unintentionally but if we could look at
[16:55] galatians chapter 6
[16:57] i'm going to read verses 1 to 5 and
[16:58] hopefully just take off here
[17:00] brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[17:02] fault we're going to read through this
[17:04] and then and then back up to it because
[17:06] i want you to kind of look at it all
[17:07] together
[17:08] ye which are spiritual restore such a
[17:10] one in the spirit of meekness
[17:12] considering thyself lest thou also be
[17:14] tempted so
[17:15] one has fallen you haven't
[17:18] but you could
[17:20] you need to consider yourself brethren
[17:22] he says bear ye one another's burdens
[17:24] and so fulfill the law of christ bear ye
[17:27] one another's burdens for if a man think
[17:29] himself to be something when he is
[17:30] nothing he deceiveth himself
[17:32] but let every man prove his own work
[17:35] that he and this is something where you
[17:37] prove you deem it worthy to prove your
[17:38] work means my work is worthy
[17:41] to prove your work means this is worthy
[17:42] of labor this is worthy of doing and
[17:44] then shall he have rejoice in himself
[17:46] alone when you realize that what you've
[17:48] been called to do has value then you'll
[17:50] rejoice in the fruits of your labor and
[17:52] you can do that alone in your own
[17:54] calling your own works and not by
[17:55] comparing your works to somebody else's
[17:58] and on another for every man every man
[18:01] shall bear his own burden notice how
[18:03] interesting that is to verse two bear
[18:04] you one another's burdens but now for
[18:06] every man shall bear his own burden
[18:09] now in verse
[18:10] nine paul is admonishing us to be
[18:13] perseverant
[18:15] saying be not weary and well doing
[18:17] and i i what stood out to me in the
[18:20] scripture is how that he's telling us to
[18:22] be not weary and well doing because it's
[18:24] a characteristic of even what he's
[18:26] talking about here in verse four to
[18:27] prove your own works that you have
[18:29] rejoicing in yourself alone it's a
[18:31] characteristic of this good pride that
[18:33] we're talking about
[18:35] but before before he tells us to be not
[18:37] weary and well doing and to persevere
[18:39] into as we have opportunity to do good
[18:42] and to sow to the spirit because all
[18:44] these things are worthy labor
[18:45] and god is not mocked if you sow good
[18:47] things you're going to get good things
[18:48] if you sow bad things you're going to
[18:50] get bad things before he even comes to
[18:52] that place he addresses a bad pride in
[18:54] verse 1 and verse 3.
[18:57] look at how he says it brethren if a man
[18:59] would be overtaken in a fault you which
[19:00] are spiritual restore such a one in the
[19:03] spirit of meekness considering thyself
[19:04] lust but also be tempted and then verse
[19:06] three for if a man think himself to be
[19:08] something when he is nothing he
[19:09] deceiveth himself
[19:11] he addresses this bad pride in verse one
[19:13] and verse three as a barrier to
[19:14] fulfilling verse two
[19:16] because he says forebear ye one
[19:18] another's burdens and so fulfill
[19:21] remember this phrase the law of christ
[19:23] so there's a law of christ there's a
[19:24] command of christ and in order to
[19:26] fulfill that we have to bear one
[19:27] another's burdens
[19:29] and he's telling us verse 1 and verse 2
[19:32] identify the barriers to bearing one
[19:33] another's burdens
[19:37] i know you're listening
[19:39] and trying to pay close attention
[19:41] because that's some uh this is we're
[19:43] dissecting this
[19:45] and maybe uh bringing causing to ponder
[19:47] this a little bit differently
[19:49] but he's he's talking about an attitude
[19:51] of superiority
[19:53] if a man thinks himself to be something
[19:55] when he's not that thing
[19:57] and he's talking about bury you one
[19:58] another's burden so fulfill the law of
[20:00] christ be saying before you just roll up
[20:02] your sleeves and rush out there to help
[20:04] somebody with what's bringing them down
[20:05] and
[20:06] and overloading them you cannot go into
[20:09] that thinking that you're better than
[20:10] them and you can't do it with this
[20:12] attitude of superiority so as much as
[20:14] i'd want to run on that course for 88
[20:16] parts i'm wanting just to kind of bring
[20:18] that up in your mind how he's talking
[20:20] about this attitude of superiority so in
[20:22] verse 1 he says you must do it in a
[20:25] spirit of meekness considering your own
[20:27] selves a spirit of meekness and an
[20:29] honesty about yourself
[20:31] so he's talking about an arrogance and a
[20:33] pride and he's bringing up what these
[20:34] anecdotes will be to that is this
[20:36] meekness which would be humility with
[20:38] your power
[20:39] because meekness is not weakness
[20:42] right doesn't that sound good meekness
[20:44] is not weakness we've heard it a million
[20:45] times meekness is not weakness it is the
[20:47] truth just because you're meek doesn't
[20:49] mean you're weak and so if you have
[20:51] meekness it's not i'll go in there all
[20:53] week unable to help and you're just
[20:54] complete worthless junk bag and you're
[20:56] just getting in the way but that's what
[20:57] we want you to do it's going in there
[20:59] with this humility a meekness and an
[21:01] honesty about yourself
[21:04] this is the anecdote this is the song
[21:05] this is how you can avoid this arrogance
[21:08] barging into a situation to help
[21:10] somebody is by being meek and by being
[21:13] honest about yourself
[21:15] i i wonder this if i could just ask
[21:17] everybody here and anybody who'll hear
[21:19] this on archive anybody streaming right
[21:20] now be honest
[21:22] do you look down on anybody
[21:25] and if you do
[21:26] you should think long and hard
[21:29] about the whole act of looking down on
[21:31] somebody else
[21:33] i mean i almost thought we'd stop now
[21:34] and have a prayer meeting right
[21:37] and we'd have a prayer line but i'd need
[21:38] someone to pray for me so we wouldn't
[21:39] have anyone to start it right
[21:42] but that's the truth
[21:44] who do you look down on i don't
[21:46] go ahead let your imagination run wild
[21:48] in this day and age of all the rights
[21:50] and all all the genders and everything
[21:51] who do you look down on
[21:53] and if there's if you answer that at all
[21:56] you should start asking yourself why in
[21:57] the world would i do that
[22:01] and so paul is talking about
[22:04] a meekness and honesty about yourself
[22:08] and he's talking about a proper opinion
[22:11] and care for yourself
[22:13] because he's he says
[22:15] it's it's not he's not working maybe
[22:18] in progression
[22:20] in terms of he says well bear you want
[22:21] to know there's burdens and then you're
[22:23] working in progression in maturity it's
[22:26] he's
[22:27] if we could look at this bear you want
[22:29] to know the burdens as his subject
[22:30] matter
[22:31] and what he's kind of bringing the
[22:32] church to
[22:33] at the end of this galatians book
[22:36] you're going to bear one another's
[22:37] burden so he's saying if you're going to
[22:39] help somebody
[22:40] even you can say start with that
[22:42] brethren there's going to be people that
[22:43] make mistakes and you're going to need
[22:44] to be the ones that help them because
[22:45] you're spiritual but if you're going to
[22:47] help them
[22:48] you got to do with the spirit of
[22:49] meekness so what is he doing he's kind
[22:50] of backing up
[22:52] spirit of meekness and a proper
[22:53] estimation of yourself so when paul gets
[22:55] to for every man shall bear his own
[22:57] burden he's not necessarily saying take
[22:59] care of everybody else's burdens and
[23:01] then take care of your own he's talking
[23:03] about a proper opinion about yourself
[23:05] prove your own work think of it to be
[23:06] worthy so you can have rejoicing in
[23:08] yourself alone and take care of yourself
[23:11] then take care of others
[23:13] i want to circle back to that maybe in a
[23:15] little bit hold that in your minds right
[23:16] now because when paul is talking about a
[23:19] bad pride there's also a good pride and
[23:21] pride is about self estimation
[23:24] right
[23:25] if anybody agrees with that say amen
[23:27] pride is about self estimation
[23:30] and pride is about self perception
[23:32] and so boundaries even if we're talking
[23:34] about boundaries boundaries that you set
[23:37] boundaries are critical we will set
[23:39] boundaries when we have the proper
[23:41] self-estimation or just a boundary that
[23:43] we said is based upon our own
[23:45] self-estimation and our own
[23:47] self-perception so notice what i just
[23:49] did there pride is about self estimation
[23:52] boundaries about self-esteem
[23:55] think about it
[23:56] pride has to do with self-perception but
[23:58] boundaries also have to do with
[24:00] perceiving who you are what defines me
[24:03] who am i what do i do what's my
[24:05] responsibility so there's some
[24:06] understanding and an estimation of your
[24:09] of your jurisdiction of what you're
[24:11] responsible for who you are what god's
[24:13] made you to be
[24:14] and really galatians chapter 6 are just
[24:16] some beautifully deep scriptures about
[24:18] barriers and boundaries and the role of
[24:20] pride
[24:21] they're just linked together
[24:23] so paul is talking about this proper
[24:25] opinion of yourself and even caring for
[24:27] yourself when he says every man shall
[24:29] bear his own burden and remember every
[24:31] man shall bear his own burden what god
[24:33] has given him to bear and but bear you
[24:35] one another's burdens that's in a
[24:37] different sense a different word
[24:38] altogether of bringing somebody else
[24:40] down
[24:41] now in romans chapter 12 verse 3
[24:44] it says for i say through the grace
[24:46] given unto me to every man that is among
[24:47] you not to think of himself more highly
[24:50] than he ought to think but to think
[24:52] soberly according as god hath dealt to
[24:55] every man the measure of faith
[24:57] and i know we're just putting on a
[24:59] another layer of paint over what we
[25:01] ministered on sunday but he says every
[25:04] man should not think of himself more
[25:05] than he ought to think but think soberly
[25:08] according as god have dealt to every man
[25:10] the measure of faith so we shouldn't
[25:11] think more highly or inappropriately
[25:14] of ourselves but we ought to think of
[25:16] ourselves within our measure
[25:19] so we shouldn't think no more no less
[25:23] when the bible tells us not to think
[25:25] more of ourselves it's not given us full
[25:27] liberty to think less of yourself we are
[25:29] not called as christians to think less
[25:31] of ourselves and devalue ourselves and
[25:33] degrade ourselves
[25:35] and to humiliate ourselves in a nasty
[25:38] way but whereas they to think of
[25:40] yourself within measure measure means a
[25:41] determined extent or a portion some sort
[25:44] of limit think of yourself within your
[25:45] boundaries or the abilities that god has
[25:48] given you says every man has a measure
[25:50] of faith
[25:51] and any measure of faith is valuable
[25:55] and and there's a
[25:58] if i could say this i've been very
[25:59] pulled into this area and i almost
[26:01] thought i was gonna just uh even at the
[26:02] last minute thought i might minister on
[26:04] the subject how that when we put when we
[26:07] have the holy ghost with measure it has
[26:08] not limited the power of the holy ghost
[26:11] so though there's measure it doesn't
[26:12] mean limits
[26:14] doesn't mean limits to blessing and
[26:15] power and and and the things that god
[26:18] wants to pour out upon us
[26:20] so
[26:21] let's notice this word he uses but we
[26:23] ought to don't think more of yourself
[26:25] but think soberly
[26:27] and soberly means to be in the right
[26:29] mind to be in a sound mind
[26:31] to exercise self-control
[26:34] so when you think soberly about yourself
[26:37] is to think of yourself in your right
[26:39] mind
[26:40] because someone could be drunk on
[26:42] themselves
[26:43] and have a a inappropriate estimation of
[26:46] their ability
[26:47] and this is what they when they talk
[26:48] about someone who's intoxicated and they
[26:50] think oh i could jump over that they
[26:52] they've kind of overestimated their
[26:54] abilities i could do that they've
[26:55] overestimated their power their strength
[26:57] and they do it through intoxication and
[26:59] so when you are sober you're in your
[27:01] right mind and you're able to exercise
[27:04] self-control
[27:07] you you have a sense of moderation
[27:09] and so self-control if you could uh take
[27:12] this subject matter and i'm throwing in
[27:13] there and again i know i'm just hitting
[27:14] high points in this and i could drill
[27:16] down a lot deeper on each one of these
[27:18] things but i feel just to present it
[27:20] this way self self control is at the
[27:22] heart of barriers and boundaries
[27:25] because it's going to take self-control
[27:27] to not uh trespass across someone else's
[27:30] boundaries but it's going to take some
[27:32] self-control to push your past yourself
[27:34] past past a barrier
[27:36] because some of us some of us are really
[27:38] good it's like oh oh no that's going to
[27:39] be hard no that's going to be difficult
[27:41] and we don't want to do it but you need
[27:42] to have self-control what do we often
[27:44] think about self-control causing
[27:46] ourselves not to but sometimes
[27:47] self-control is causing us to do
[27:50] you control yourself i'm going to
[27:53] persevere through this i'm going to push
[27:55] beyond this barrier this this thing that
[27:56] is limiting that is keeping me from my
[27:58] full potential i'm going to press beyond
[28:00] that so self-control is at the heart of
[28:02] barriers and boundaries you control
[28:04] yourself
[28:06] and you set you set the boundaries and
[28:08] parameters for yourself but then you
[28:09] also respect somebody else's
[28:13] and then pride
[28:15] is related to self-control
[28:18] boundaries are related to self-control
[28:20] what i just did there
[28:22] i said pride
[28:24] has to do with self-control
[28:25] boundaries has to do with self-control
[28:30] and a good pride which is a the healthy
[28:32] self view i don't think we're at any um
[28:36] disadvantage tonight by not taking more
[28:38] time to expound upon a good pride i
[28:39] think you're just right there with me
[28:41] a good pride this healthy view of your
[28:43] person a healthy view of the job you're
[28:45] doing let every man prove his own work
[28:47] and demon worthy will lead to a greater
[28:49] perseverance
[28:51] and even as paul talks about hey those
[28:53] that strive for the mastery and natural
[28:55] things discipline themselves and keep
[28:57] themselves under their uh bring their
[28:59] body into subjection they control
[29:01] themselves and they do it to obtain a
[29:02] corrupt crown when you deem your labor
[29:05] worthy and the goal worthy you're
[29:07] willing to control yourself because it
[29:09] makes it more expedient to the end and
[29:12] so you have to have a healthy view of
[29:14] what you're doing and you have to have a
[29:16] healthy view of what you're going to get
[29:17] from what you're doing in order to in
[29:19] order to have the kind of self-control
[29:21] that's going to cause you to persevere
[29:23] and cause you to do the right things in
[29:25] order to achieve the goal
[29:27] i i don't think that would sound foreign
[29:29] to us tonight can you get the word
[29:31] picture in your mind
[29:32] that there's a there's a healthy pride
[29:35] that we can have of our labor and what
[29:36] we're going to get from it that's going
[29:38] to cause us to stay on task but then
[29:41] also cause us to be future looking
[29:42] saying this is going to pay off one day
[29:45] this is going to be worth it where is it
[29:47] a lot of us fail even in rearing our
[29:49] children is we we're not willing to make
[29:51] the sacrifices early on and be proactive
[29:54] to do things and stick to it and take
[29:56] the difficult times and the hard nights
[29:58] and the and the arduous process of
[30:00] disciplining our children and making the
[30:02] right decisions because we believe it's
[30:04] worth it and we can see down the road
[30:06] that one day it's going to have a payoff
[30:08] but instead we give in
[30:10] and we become very reactive instead of
[30:12] proactive
[30:14] and reactive parenting the root of it's
[30:16] often in pride
[30:18] because your children do something that
[30:20] makes you look bad
[30:23] should we just for all the single people
[30:26] without kids are like go hit it brother
[30:27] him go for it
[30:30] brother loyal's over here saying go
[30:32] ahead brother aaron
[30:34] hit it
[30:36] but it's true a lot of times when we act
[30:37] as parents knee-jerk in the moment and
[30:40] it's pride that's motivated because we
[30:42] feel shamed
[30:43] but to be very careful the emotions were
[30:45] given into in those moments but if you
[30:47] have if you could if you have this lack
[30:49] of parenting parental pride and you can
[30:52] operate in an area of humility and
[30:54] self-control respect your own child's
[30:56] boundaries uh respect the boundaries of
[30:58] a parent then you're willing to control
[31:00] yourself and you're willing to look at
[31:02] the fruits that to be gained later on by
[31:05] all by the identifying the goal
[31:09] some of you some of the parents are
[31:11] pulling me into this area like now
[31:12] forget the single people i want to hear
[31:13] about this
[31:15] it's a very important principle and the
[31:17] message perseverant and i was looking at
[31:20] i've been asked by a few people which
[31:21] one are you quoting from which one are
[31:22] you quoting from there's like nine
[31:24] different times where abraham preached
[31:25] this sermon so i hope some of you have
[31:26] listened to all of them trying to figure
[31:28] out which one it was i was studying
[31:30] but the message perseverance says men
[31:31] through all ages that's ever tried to
[31:33] achieve something has been persistent
[31:35] and
[31:36] it's important to note when brother
[31:37] brand preaches something consistently 62
[31:39] 63 64 he preaches this sermon multiple
[31:42] times in the year men through all ages
[31:44] that's ever tried to achieve something
[31:46] has been persistent man in order to be
[31:48] persistent he said i might quote again
[31:50] this is interesting in order to be
[31:52] persistent is to know what you were
[31:54] after
[31:55] that sounds like confidence doesn't it
[31:57] that person knows what they're after
[31:59] they're confident they know what they're
[32:00] going for and if you do not know you are
[32:02] not certain of your standing
[32:05] you are not certain of your standing
[32:07] again that speaks to confidence someone
[32:08] being certain someone you might even
[32:10] speak of a pride if we could use that
[32:11] word you have to know what you're after
[32:13] you do certain of what you have what of
[32:14] your standing but when you thoroughly
[32:17] understand what it is what you are after
[32:19] and are satisfied you're going to do it
[32:22] this is confidence
[32:24] this is not an arrogance this is not a
[32:25] cockiness this is not a presumption but
[32:28] this is a this is at the root of being
[32:29] persevered and being persistent you're
[32:31] satisfied you're going to do it then you
[32:33] can be persistent get really
[32:35] holding on
[32:37] and this is
[32:39] you'll find in these series of sermons
[32:41] in a number of places brother-in-law's
[32:42] talking about perseverance being what it
[32:44] takes to get past barriers
[32:46] it becomes a consistent theme that
[32:48] brother brahma identifies if you're
[32:49] going to get past a barrier if you're
[32:50] going to get past the sin barrier i
[32:52] think he says the sound barrier is the
[32:54] sin of unbelief the the barrier the
[32:56] sound barrier between
[32:57] faith and disbelief
[32:59] you've got to get past that
[33:01] you've got to get past that berries and
[33:02] you're going to have to be persistent so
[33:04] there has to be there has to be some
[33:05] spiritual confidence there to be some
[33:07] spiritual know-how there has to be some
[33:09] spiritual uh pride and knowing where you
[33:11] stand in jesus christ and and knowing
[33:13] that you can do it and i can do all
[33:14] things through christ who gives me
[33:15] strength with man this is impossible but
[33:17] with god all things are possible and
[33:19] this is what it takes to be perseverant
[33:23] and there are some remarkable things
[33:25] that exist within the academic world of
[33:27] how even in academia they're picking up
[33:30] on this connection between pride and
[33:32] perseverance
[33:33] tenacity and grit and resilience and how
[33:36] important some of these characteristics
[33:37] are and they'll write these big huge
[33:39] articles on it being wow you'll never
[33:41] know and malcolm gladwell right now is
[33:42] probably working on this great treatise
[33:44] on perseverance and grit and resilience
[33:46] it's like yeah buddy paul beat you to it
[33:49] right the bible the old testament new
[33:52] testament speaks of these
[33:54] characteristics that a a true son or
[33:56] daughter of god ought to have in order
[33:58] to become all that christ has ordained
[34:00] them to be and it lays right within the
[34:02] word of god to be persevered to be
[34:04] persistent
[34:05] and to do that there has to be some
[34:07] shoulders back some chin up right
[34:09] i can do this i can do this i need to i
[34:12] need to know what i'm after i'd be
[34:13] certain of where i'm standing thoroughly
[34:14] understand what it is and what you're
[34:15] after and then be satisfied
[34:18] that's powerful so they've done these
[34:20] studies where
[34:22] uh and
[34:23] immediately i think our homeschool kids
[34:25] like are just the kids like yeah that's
[34:27] what they do to us every day in school
[34:29] but they come up with an annoying task
[34:31] and they ask someone to come in they get
[34:33] all these participants come in and
[34:34] participate in this study and they ask
[34:36] them to do this real annoying task but
[34:38] once they've accomplished it with the
[34:41] not the control group but with the group
[34:43] that they're wanting to see how they
[34:44] respond they make them feel really good
[34:46] about it
[34:47] like wow you you are amazing 94th
[34:49] percentile you are better than 94 of the
[34:52] other people in this world when it comes
[34:53] to this very annoying mundane made up
[34:56] task
[34:57] it's actually made up statistic that
[34:58] they're better than 94 but what they're
[35:00] wanting to induce is pride
[35:02] not in a nasty way but in a good way
[35:04] to try to bring up
[35:06] instigate the right kind of ambition and
[35:08] aspiration and not oh wow you're really
[35:10] smart but that right kind of praise that
[35:12] provokes uh this like well you know what
[35:14] this is worthy this is good i should try
[35:16] this and this is what they found people
[35:18] who are feeling proud of their abilities
[35:21] significantly increased their efforts on
[35:23] the difficult mental rotation tasks so
[35:25] then they came up with a mundane task
[35:27] boring this is easy but they told
[35:29] somebody wow
[35:30] you're really good at this
[35:32] and then when they had them do an
[35:33] actually difficult con task they called
[35:36] it the difficult mental rotation they
[35:39] upped the time devoted to building their
[35:41] skills by 40 percent compared with the
[35:44] other people who weren't proud
[35:46] now this isn't a controlled kind of a
[35:48] they try to control it for different
[35:49] ways self-efficacy and ability and all
[35:51] these different things and and reading
[35:53] through some of the details of it i i
[35:55] thought it was really brilliant the way
[35:56] they structured these to where they can
[35:58] actually determine the impact a positive
[36:01] pride will have on somebody's effort
[36:04] and found that the people who had had
[36:06] this right kind of pride inspired inside
[36:08] of them
[36:09] they spent more than 40 percent compared
[36:12] to the other people
[36:14] who did the annoying task and they were
[36:15] asked to do the next one they did it 40
[36:18] they spent 40 percent more time trying
[36:20] to hone their skill
[36:22] improve their ability to accomplish this
[36:24] difficult mental task than the other
[36:26] group that hadn't had their pride
[36:28] instigated
[36:29] was it talking about
[36:31] talking about practice talking about
[36:33] being perseverant
[36:35] and in order to do that there has to be
[36:37] something that's inspired and quicken on
[36:39] inside of the person
[36:40] and having this kind of pride this
[36:42] self-respect this this self value
[36:46] they find that it also is related to
[36:47] self increase in self control
[36:50] that it gives people a reason to
[36:52] moderate it gives people a reason to
[36:53] focus it gives them a reason uh to say
[36:56] no it gives them a reason to say yes to
[36:57] the right things
[36:59] and to have this kind of pride this
[37:00] right kind of self-respect in this right
[37:03] kind of self value not only increases
[37:05] your self-control to not transgress
[37:07] somebody else's boundaries but it's also
[37:09] going to give you the kind of
[37:10] self-control you need to defend your
[37:11] boundaries
[37:15] and i'm just going to throw this this
[37:17] one scripture out there i just
[37:19] actually when i put it in there
[37:21] and i'd put this scripture in my notes
[37:22] it's like wow that's just kind of
[37:24] out of the middle of nowhere but i want
[37:25] to come back to it later because i've
[37:27] been studying on what love is and what
[37:29] love ain't
[37:30] and
[37:31] and the boundaries and barriers in love
[37:33] and in marriage
[37:34] and in first thessalonians chapter 4
[37:36] verse 4 says that every one of you
[37:38] should know how to we ought to know how
[37:40] to possess his vessel
[37:44] now based upon the context of this these
[37:46] verses
[37:48] there are some that believe that paul is
[37:50] referring to a man's wife
[37:52] there's others that believe and when i
[37:54] say psalm i'm not talking about people
[37:55] here i didn't poll everybody
[37:58] and asked who which one do you think it
[37:59] is but just within the theological
[38:02] realms and the different approaches in
[38:03] the scripture even minister friends of
[38:05] mine
[38:06] take it differently or see it in a
[38:08] different approach
[38:09] some see it as your own that possess his
[38:11] vessel speaks to his wife some see it as
[38:13] their own body
[38:14] that either way you need to know how to
[38:16] possess it appropriately
[38:19] because notice if it's your own body or
[38:20] if it's your wife or even both as it
[38:22] would have application you still have to
[38:24] know how to do it appropriately
[38:26] so there's no attitude this is mine
[38:28] because it's mine i i can do whatever i
[38:30] want this is mine i can behave however i
[38:32] want this is mine it it's within my
[38:34] control my power he says let every man
[38:37] every one of you know how to possess
[38:39] your vessel in sanctification and in
[38:42] honor
[38:43] so there's a right way to possess it if
[38:46] possession
[38:47] matters and it's within what's within
[38:48] your control then there has to be done
[38:50] it has to be done in sanctification it
[38:52] has to be undone in honor it has to be
[38:54] done the right way
[38:57] so there is a there's a positive pride
[39:00] that will cause us to be persevere it
[39:02] causes us to be exercise self-control
[39:05] and it's relating to these barriers and
[39:06] boundaries that we're talking about
[39:08] but this bad pride this hubris that
[39:10] we've mentioned before this bad pride
[39:13] because again
[39:15] the good pride is going to cause you to
[39:17] persevere even in the absence of
[39:19] immediate results
[39:21] because you see the long-range vision
[39:22] you have the goal in mind something
[39:24] that's coming at the end
[39:26] but when you're but bad pride it's only
[39:28] interested in immediate gratification
[39:32] it's looking to the the just the
[39:33] momentary monetary rewards or the
[39:35] conspicuous rewards that everyone else
[39:37] can see that everyone else can know and
[39:39] there's a lot of things we'll do
[39:41] impulsively
[39:42] as far as conspicuous spending or we
[39:44] want other people to think we have money
[39:46] or we want other people to think of how
[39:47] we dress and where we go to eat and what
[39:50] we wear and what we're doing it's kind
[39:51] of this pretense and it's all rooted in
[39:53] pride this bad pride will do that
[39:56] because it's only interested in lifting
[39:58] up the self and gratifying the self
[40:01] and this bad pride is at the root of
[40:03] boundary violations
[40:05] it's at the root of it
[40:07] it's at the it's at the root of boundary
[40:09] violations and at the root of barrier
[40:10] setting
[40:17] just as pride is at the root of all sin
[40:21] it's at the root
[40:22] of boundary violations because in the
[40:25] beginning what did brother branham say
[40:26] about the woman she couldn't wait
[40:30] it was an oncoming promise it was going
[40:32] to happen in god's time but she didn't
[40:33] wait
[40:34] she felt this sense of urgency what
[40:36] caused her to push past this boundary of
[40:39] god's word this sense of needing to be
[40:41] immediately gratified this sense of
[40:43] accomplishing something and so she
[40:44] couldn't wait this bad pride is
[40:47] impulsive he needs immediate
[40:48] satisfaction needs to be immediately
[40:50] gratified
[40:51] and in first john chapter 2 verse 16
[40:54] for all that is in the world this is a
[40:56] very uh all-inclusive statement all that
[40:58] in the world is in the world the lust of
[41:00] the flesh and the lust of the eyes and
[41:02] the pride of life is not of the father
[41:04] but is of the world
[41:07] lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and
[41:08] the pride of life it's greed and pride
[41:10] joined together lust of the flesh and
[41:12] less of the eyes is almost summing up
[41:14] it's summed up in the pride of life
[41:17] this is what is in the world this is
[41:18] what's at the nastiness of our base
[41:21] instincts this is kind of at the root of
[41:23] satan's sin this is at the root of the
[41:25] original sin the lust of the flesh to
[41:26] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[41:27] life all three of those correspond to
[41:30] the temptation of the woman in the
[41:31] garden of eden
[41:32] and all three of them correspond to the
[41:34] temptation of christ in the wilderness
[41:36] and one was enticed to transgress
[41:38] boundaries but jesus christ remained
[41:40] firm and didn't transgress the boundary
[41:43] he had self-control he was perseverant
[41:45] he was persistent he was even offered
[41:47] some things that he might find in the
[41:49] end all kingdoms but he realized there's
[41:51] a way that i could come into possession
[41:53] of all these things and it'd be a glory
[41:55] and honor to god and i'm not willing to
[41:56] bypass the hard parts to get what i'll
[41:59] ultimately get i cannot bypass god's
[42:02] program of god's order i've got to do
[42:04] the right thing the right way there are
[42:06] no shortcuts
[42:07] so i'm going to honor god's way i'm
[42:09] going to honor the right way to do it
[42:10] whereas this bad pride sometimes go oh
[42:12] it's just a means to an end in the end
[42:14] if the right thing is done
[42:16] that's all that matters no that's not
[42:18] the case
[42:20] and so this left of the flesh the less
[42:22] of the eyes and the pride of life
[42:24] kind of at this at the root of boundary
[42:26] by boundary violations
[42:28] and even putting up barriers and keeping
[42:31] the word of god from dealing with the
[42:32] hearts or even allowing other people to
[42:33] help us
[42:35] if i could say this generally i must
[42:37] want to say always generally
[42:39] but again maybe it's always boundary
[42:42] violations are self-serving
[42:45] if we if we cross somebody else's
[42:47] boundary
[42:48] we'll do it because what because
[42:50] ultimately what it does for us not for
[42:52] what it does for the individual
[42:54] i'm not saying it's a conscious boundary
[42:56] violation but if this is what goes back
[42:58] to what i was thinking about in the
[42:59] beginning when i said sometimes we act
[43:01] and we're thinking it's altruistic we
[43:03] think that we're acting because we want
[43:04] to help somebody but if it's bad pride
[43:07] that's operating you're actually doing
[43:09] it to serve yourself not the person
[43:11] because if you recognize that you were
[43:12] transgressing a personal boundary if you
[43:15] recognized you were doing something
[43:16] insensitive or inappropriate no matter
[43:18] how much you'd want to help that person
[43:19] you'd say i can't help them that way
[43:22] that's that's not going to bring the
[43:23] healing they need that's not going to
[43:24] bring them the comfort they need that's
[43:26] not going to that you know that's that's
[43:27] not going to be what's appropriate in
[43:29] the moment there's some of us that have
[43:30] experienced situations where something
[43:32] very horrible has happened and the
[43:34] person who's there trying to comfort us
[43:36] makes some kind of outlandish statement
[43:38] that might be true but it does nothing
[43:39] to help
[43:41] and if they're called out it's like well
[43:42] i was just trying to help them i just
[43:44] thought if they recognized that or did
[43:45] this or did that it would help them but
[43:47] you have to realize when that happens
[43:48] you say or do something and you cross
[43:50] that boundary you act inappropriately
[43:52] with pride i'm going to be the one that
[43:55] helps this is going to make me look good
[43:57] i've got something to say i can be of
[43:58] help to you i i'm an expert in this area
[44:01] or i've been here before i've got
[44:02] something to say and you're just serving
[44:04] yourself and your own willingness to
[44:05] help and your own achievements pat
[44:07] yourself on the back you're doing it
[44:08] through some selfish ambition and
[44:10] generally if not always a boundary is
[44:13] crossed because the person crossing it
[44:15] is doing something to serve themselves
[44:16] and not somebody else
[44:23] proverbs chapter 25 verse 17
[44:26] withdraw thy foot from thy neighbor's
[44:28] house
[44:30] lest he be weary of thee and so hate
[44:31] thee
[44:32] i'm not saying that that gives us
[44:33] permission to hate those who don't leave
[44:35] timely
[44:37] but what's what's the proverb actually
[44:38] speaking to human nature
[44:41] and the bible's needing to tell us
[44:44] in general like this wasn't just
[44:46] something that was going to be buried
[44:47] within the hearts of certain people and
[44:49] they were just shared at the appropriate
[44:50] moments like anybody who reads the bible
[44:51] needs to hear this
[44:53] all christians need to hear this
[44:55] withdrawal thy foot from thy neighbor's
[44:56] house why all right if you don't have
[44:59] enough sense to figure out why
[45:01] you can weary them and they'll end up
[45:02] hating you what because there's some
[45:05] boundary that's crossed
[45:08] the bible's actually having to speak to
[45:10] the fact that we can be insensitive
[45:15] that's where i wish i had the hammond
[45:16] just hammering down on a b-flat major
[45:19] third diminished or whatever to give me
[45:20] a little
[45:22] so i could get an eight-man or get a
[45:24] witness
[45:25] there's there's there's times we can be
[45:26] just really really insensitive
[45:30] and and we we act to this insensitivity
[45:32] maybe we act through insecurity
[45:36] it's it's really a a real toxic brew
[45:39] that all these things combined together
[45:40] by saying hey don't stay too long remove
[45:43] your foot from your neighbor's house yes
[45:45] you've been invited yes you obviously
[45:46] are welcome because it's not dealing
[45:47] with the thief hey you snuck in don't
[45:50] stay too long you've been invited but
[45:51] it's saying you've got to recognize at a
[45:53] certain point there's there's boundaries
[45:55] to even hospitality there's boundaries
[45:57] to giving there's boundaries to
[45:59] availability and access is saying don't
[46:01] go too far through
[46:04] into somebody's goodness or their
[46:05] graciousness or their willing help don't
[46:07] take advantage of people
[46:09] if they open up the door which is the
[46:11] appropriate boundary entry into
[46:13] someone's house you climb through the
[46:15] window get out of there
[46:17] shouldn't even be in there but if you
[46:18] come to the door by invitation there
[46:20] still has to be the awareness that even
[46:22] though i've been invited beyond the
[46:24] boundary i'm in someone's home i just
[46:25] don't go snooping around i've always
[46:27] wondered what a master bath looked like
[46:29] in this home
[46:30] plan we're wanting to build a house do
[46:31] you mind if i just go in here and see
[46:32] your master closet just kind of
[46:33] traipsing through right
[46:35] that would be inappropriate
[46:37] but the bible's talking about us being
[46:39] conscious and aware of someone else's
[46:41] boundaries and says withdrawal your foot
[46:43] from your neighbor's house why because
[46:45] you can cross a boundary
[46:48] and they'll get weary
[46:51] it's just a it's even a lack of
[46:53] social awareness
[46:54] he's talking to brother michael about it
[46:56] how maybe some of us that we need to
[46:57] create our own spectrum
[47:00] right we're just completely clueless
[47:01] yeah they say things that that's
[47:03] inappropriate
[47:04] i shouldn't have said that
[47:06] and it's just they've been diagnosed
[47:08] with pride is what it is
[47:14] and what's even more remarkable is that
[47:16] the core of bad pride is a fragile ego
[47:20] it's been a great time for everyone just
[47:22] to say man real loud like yep not me
[47:26] the core of it is a fragile ego
[47:29] and because there's a fragility there
[47:30] and there's an insecurity there they
[47:32] always have to act aggressively
[47:35] in order to prove themselves
[47:37] and it's not what paul was told he says
[47:38] prove your own work this is the paradox
[47:40] right you got to prove your own word but
[47:42] he's not talking about from a place of
[47:43] insecurity we always got to put yourself
[47:45] forward always got to prove yourself and
[47:46] i'm good and i can do this but there's
[47:48] this fragile ego which is going to
[47:49] motivate aggressive behavior
[47:55] why you have to maintain the illusion of
[47:57] control
[47:59] you have to maintain the illusion of
[48:01] competence
[48:03] i need them to at least think it's like
[48:05] the man behind the curtain remember the
[48:07] wizard of oz
[48:08] that was a complex acting out
[48:11] this is something you got something i
[48:12] want you to just take deep into your
[48:13] hearts and think about this to where if
[48:15] you're operating from a place of
[48:17] insecurity that doesn't mean you're
[48:19] always going to be this humble meek
[48:20] broken uh contrite person but some
[48:23] people have the most fragile egos are
[48:25] the ones that are most loud and
[48:26] boisterous
[48:27] compensating for something it's you're
[48:29] trying to maintain this illusion i'm
[48:30] strong i'm powerful i'm in control i'm
[48:32] confident i know what i'm doing
[48:37] and it's in that way that people act
[48:39] inappropriately and is the bible saying
[48:41] you wear your friends out
[48:44] you wear the people that love you the
[48:45] very people that invite you into their
[48:47] lives the very people that are welcoming
[48:49] to you you don't know how to remove your
[48:51] foot
[48:52] you don't know how to stop and not go so
[48:54] far and that's what causes the
[48:56] complications in relationships because
[48:58] you don't have this consciousness of
[48:59] what a personal boundary is
[49:03] but on the other hand studies have found
[49:05] that good pride is associated with the
[49:07] increase in social support
[49:09] that so when someone has a good pride
[49:10] these positive thought problems they
[49:12] have an increase in social support they
[49:13] have lower anxiety and they have a
[49:15] greater desire to help others by sharing
[49:17] their experiences and their expertise
[49:20] think about that
[49:22] that if there's a good pride this
[49:24] healthy sense of pride not this
[49:25] fragility not this weakness not this
[49:26] insecurity
[49:28] that there's actually more social
[49:29] support even in your willingness to give
[49:31] it and you and you also receive it
[49:33] there's less anxiety and you're
[49:35] characterized by someone who's willing
[49:36] to help i'm willing to help i'm willing
[49:38] to be able to help you for your own
[49:39] benefit let me share something with you
[49:41] for your own
[49:42] benefit so brings me back to this in
[49:45] galatians bury you one another's burdens
[49:48] but first
[49:50] every man shall bear his own burden
[49:53] i know i'm putting it in those that
[49:54] terminology but i think this bears out
[49:56] as you look at the word of god it's not
[49:58] it's not saying you that well get
[50:00] everybody else fixed and then fix
[50:01] yourself
[50:04] and you that are broken and needy and
[50:06] helpless you just start helping
[50:07] everybody else first and then once you
[50:09] get everybody else helped you you get
[50:11] the help no this is just like maybe
[50:13] sister nicole could give this if i mess
[50:15] it up what do they teach you when when
[50:16] there's the masks come down
[50:19] and and all the oxygen masks are
[50:20] dropping it doesn't tell all the men to
[50:22] get up and put mask on the women and
[50:24] children first and then put on a mask
[50:27] they say no immediately you put on your
[50:29] mask
[50:30] you the adult put it on immediately and
[50:32] then you help those who can't who can't
[50:34] put the mask on themselves why because
[50:36] if you go deprived of oxygen for too
[50:38] long you'll start thinking really really
[50:40] crazy and silly
[50:42] so what happens
[50:43] oxygen deprivation starts happening and
[50:45] you won't even think you won't even
[50:46] think clearly like
[50:48] jack why don't you have your mask on you
[50:50] silly boy you should really have your
[50:52] mask on
[50:53] no put your ears on first so you could
[50:54] think clearly and so there is this
[50:56] process where we oh no men and women
[50:58] first no take care of the babies first
[51:00] sometimes there's an order that you have
[51:02] to take in god's word so that you could
[51:04] ever be qualified to help
[51:07] you think we could just go out today and
[51:08] find all these broken people in the
[51:10] world today and somehow turn their lives
[51:12] around by just telling people who are
[51:14] broken in sin and laying with their own
[51:16] sins and burdened by their own
[51:18] weaknesses and have never felt the love
[51:19] of god that oh all you need to do is
[51:21] just start loving other people man all
[51:23] you need to do is start living for other
[51:24] people all you need to do is serve serve
[51:26] serve and they'll fall flat on their
[51:28] face and never find that place of real
[51:30] security in jesus christ because they're
[51:32] taught some false narrative of what it
[51:34] takes to be a christian
[51:38] there's a mouthful in that
[51:40] describes a lot of just the
[51:42] remodel projects that the denominational
[51:44] christianity wants to do
[51:46] but you can never bear another's burden
[51:48] until you bear your own
[51:50] take care of yourself then you could
[51:52] properly care for others
[51:54] because first it's going to sound a
[51:55] little bit odd first we have
[51:56] responsibility for ourselves
[51:58] i say whoa
[52:00] this this seems a little bit contrary to
[52:02] everything i've been taught you'll find
[52:04] that
[52:06] maybe i it doesn't mean what you think i
[52:07] mean when i say it
[52:09] because what responsibility does a
[52:10] sinner have first to do repent
[52:13] you find that there's a process in god's
[52:15] word
[52:16] and it's maybe reverse of the worldly
[52:18] thinking but there's a process where you
[52:19] are responsible for yourself and
[52:20] yourself first when the bible says bear
[52:23] you one another's burdens then it
[52:24] amplifies this what it means
[52:26] and you'll find that you have to be
[52:28] burying your own first before you can
[52:30] ever take somebody else's
[52:32] in first corinthians chapter 6 verses 18
[52:34] to 20.
[52:36] i've got one two three four
[52:39] five-ish six
[52:42] or five six different scriptures i want
[52:44] to read and a quote is it all right if i
[52:46] continue
[52:48] all right i was just wanting to see if i
[52:50] could gauge beforehand anybody that
[52:51] would be yeah and i just focus on that
[52:53] one person
[52:55] we're going to take a poll of the front
[52:56] row is it okay if we continue
[52:59] okay good there we go 100
[53:00] 100
[53:02] unanimous first corinthians chapter 6
[53:04] verses 18 to 20 flee fornication
[53:07] every sin that a man doeth is without
[53:08] the body but he that committeth again i
[53:11] said there's familiar scriptures but
[53:12] just want to take a little bit different
[53:14] angle to it
[53:16] but he that committed fortification
[53:17] sinteth against his own body what know
[53:20] you not that your body is the temple of
[53:22] the holy ghost which is in you
[53:24] which you have of god and ye are not
[53:26] your own i think we're gonna have to
[53:27] think deeply on this your body is the
[53:30] temple of the holy ghost which you've
[53:32] received from god and you are no longer
[53:34] your own for you are bought with a prize
[53:37] therefore glorify god in your body and
[53:40] your spirit which are gods
[53:42] so there is actual glorification that we
[53:44] can do in our body not glorifying our
[53:46] body or glorifying our spirit but our
[53:48] bodies can glory and our spirits can
[53:50] glory because our body is not our own it
[53:53] is the holy ghost
[53:56] but let me say this when i bring that
[53:57] into view and god just
[53:59] struck me very particularly this week
[54:01] and pondering this your body is the
[54:03] temple of the holy ghost that
[54:05] immediately should invoke some
[54:06] self-worth
[54:09] and and when it says but your body is
[54:11] the lord's and you are not your own it's
[54:13] not to kind of turn this around like oh
[54:15] i guess i'm just somebody else's slave
[54:16] no there's a way that things get
[54:18] perverted and misrepresented which
[54:20] actually robs the believer from the real
[54:23] power that there's kind of the name
[54:25] claim it pat yourself on the back you're
[54:26] a great person in the maybe the joel
[54:28] olsteen way in the world today that's
[54:31] going to take you down the wrong path
[54:32] without re without repentance without a
[54:34] birth without a dying without obedience
[54:36] to the word of god and that's so far
[54:38] away from what i'm trying to express you
[54:39] today but then there's another side of
[54:41] it that's always going to try to beat
[54:42] you down and beat you down and beat you
[54:44] down and make you feel like you're
[54:46] broken
[54:47] there's so much in the word of god that
[54:48] we can identify where at the end of the
[54:50] day it's almost as if we're just thrown
[54:52] into a corner as a broken mess
[54:55] and we just always need to be reminded
[54:57] of it
[54:59] and if we're not careful we just think
[55:00] that's the way christ sees us
[55:03] when i found you you're nothing but a
[55:04] broken mess you were good for nothing no
[55:07] good nothing this that and the other and
[55:08] you know what you still are so you
[55:10] better stay in your place
[55:12] and that's how christ views us
[55:15] just always looking at us in the corners
[55:16] a broken mess
[55:18] complex rejected
[55:20] uh bad this bad that and that's the way
[55:22] things always remain and there's
[55:24] scriptures we can start to use to kind
[55:26] of support that idea and you're missing
[55:27] something
[55:28] because the idea that the truth of
[55:31] self-denial the truth of sacrifice the
[55:33] truth of humility
[55:34] cannot be misunder understood to the
[55:36] point of our detriment our spiritual
[55:38] detriment
[55:40] where we make ourselves doormats
[55:43] we make ourselves out to be nothing we
[55:44] constantly have a negative testimony we
[55:46] constantly say negative things we're
[55:47] never quite overcoming we make ourselves
[55:50] doormats or even worse we allow others
[55:51] to treat us the same way
[55:54] and we do it all
[55:56] in the name of christian virtue
[56:00] we think that it's christ-like to do it
[56:02] we think that it's virtuous to do it
[56:04] but when the bible tells us to turn the
[56:06] other cheek please i hope you can stay
[56:07] very faithful to what i'm trying to say
[56:09] when the bible tells us to turn the
[56:10] other cheek it's not an invitation to
[56:12] endure abuse
[56:15] it's not a it's not an invitation to
[56:17] constantly and consistently and forever
[56:19] endure boundary breaking
[56:22] when it says turn the other cheek and
[56:24] say christians just have to be
[56:25] manipulated and abused and taken
[56:27] advantage of and they just have to put
[56:29] up with it
[56:31] i've had to endure things i'm just going
[56:33] to be very honest with you right now it
[56:34] comes to my heart i've had to endure
[56:35] hurts and when i've tried to bring them
[56:37] up the response i got was you're a
[56:39] christian forgive
[56:44] what you're told
[56:45] you may be hurt and you may be broken
[56:46] you really you want to get somewhere
[56:48] it's like you just need to get over it
[56:49] buddy where's your thick skin
[56:51] and the devil would want to say if
[56:52] you're going to be a real christian just
[56:54] keep putting up with it
[56:56] just get under their thumb let them
[56:57] treat you however they want to treat you
[56:59] that's your pastor that you're you're a
[57:01] christian you just get under it buddy
[57:03] and i'm telling you right now as your
[57:05] brother and your friend you don't have
[57:06] to
[57:10] in mark chapter 8 verses 34 to 35
[57:18] and when he called the people unto him
[57:20] with his disciples also he said unto
[57:23] them
[57:24] whosoever will come after me let him
[57:26] deny himself and take up his cross and
[57:29] follow me
[57:30] for whosoever will save his life shall
[57:32] lose it but whosoever shall lose his
[57:33] life for my sake and the gospels
[57:37] the same shall save it
[57:39] never lose sight of the fact that losing
[57:41] your life has to be for his sake and the
[57:43] gospel's sake
[57:44] and not for the sake of somebody else
[57:46] claiming the gospel
[57:47] or claiming christ
[57:50] the losing of our life for his sake is
[57:52] the salvation of it it's not in the
[57:54] losing of our life for any sake
[57:57] right
[57:58] it's not just well get lost get views
[58:00] get mistreated get mishandled and and
[58:03] i'll redeem it all in the end no it's
[58:04] not an invitation to be marginalized
[58:06] it's not an invitation to be abused it's
[58:07] not an invitation to subject yourself to
[58:10] hurts that christ has not asked you to
[58:12] be subjected to
[58:15] but notice how beautiful this is let him
[58:17] deny himself and take up his cross
[58:19] to deny yourself is to not lose yourself
[58:22] in the sense of just i'm going to let
[58:23] myself go
[58:25] to be mistreated or be abused
[58:29] to deny yourself
[58:31] is to by choice become a servant of
[58:33] christ
[58:35] self-denial is to not deprive you of the
[58:37] healing you need self-denial should not
[58:38] deprive you of the love that you need
[58:39] self-denial is not to subject yourself
[58:42] to hurts and to pains and offenses and
[58:44] difficult things all in the name of
[58:45] christian virtue i guess this is just
[58:47] what the cross is for i guess it's just
[58:49] what a christian does no it's not and i
[58:51] hope you realize i'm speaking in a very
[58:52] direct sense a very narrow sense uh
[58:55] because there ought not to be any
[58:56] hardiness or any misunderstanding that
[58:58] we will endure things we do go things
[58:59] through things we suffer
[59:01] doing good and we have to take it
[59:02] patiently and all things work together
[59:04] for the good
[59:05] and god will allow us to endure bitter
[59:07] trials for his glory for our benefit and
[59:10] there's things that we go through that
[59:11] in his love he's ordained them for our
[59:13] perfection
[59:15] but to deny yourself is not to think of
[59:17] yourself as nothing
[59:19] but as to by choice become a servant of
[59:21] christ
[59:23] you've been given freedom to choose
[59:24] freedom
[59:26] in christ
[59:28] because it says take up a cross
[59:31] let him deny himself and take up his
[59:34] cross this is the balance to deny
[59:35] yourself
[59:37] because on what happens is just deny
[59:38] yourself it almost be like this
[59:39] abandonment of self just deny yourself
[59:41] there could just be this casting down
[59:43] himself there could be this unreasonable
[59:45] estimation of what christ is wanting to
[59:46] do like you're just going to be trampled
[59:48] on but then it says take up your cross
[59:51] immediately focuses on personal
[59:53] responsibility
[59:57] take up your cross
[59:59] it's the balance then deny yourself but
[1:00:00] take up your cross
[1:00:02] he's bringing something beautifully
[1:00:03] balanced into view
[1:00:05] because
[1:00:06] and i i want to finish this
[1:00:10] and i'm just looking now
[1:00:13] and this thought upon my heart
[1:00:16] take up your cross
[1:00:18] deny yourself but take up your cross
[1:00:21] our identity who we are our value our
[1:00:24] worth our identity and the identity of
[1:00:26] christ are united in the cross
[1:00:29] it's where it becomes one
[1:00:31] so it's not it's not just in this image
[1:00:34] of deny yourself and take up this cross
[1:00:36] of self-sacrifice dragging this way to
[1:00:39] calvary in order to be crucified he did
[1:00:41] that part
[1:00:43] so when there's a take up a cross yes
[1:00:44] there's a burden yes there's a reproach
[1:00:46] yes there's a hardship that comes with
[1:00:47] it but denying yourself and taking up
[1:00:50] the cross is then to take yourself into
[1:00:52] union with christ because it's our
[1:00:54] identity and the identity of christ
[1:00:55] become one in the cross
[1:00:58] so we become identified i was there take
[1:01:00] up your cross his cross was my cross i'm
[1:01:03] going to find myself there in his
[1:01:05] sacrifice for me and i'm not going to
[1:01:07] take this perverted view that i'm just
[1:01:09] cast down i'm forsaken i'm demoralized
[1:01:12] i'm abused i'm good for nothing and i'm
[1:01:15] proving it day by day but i'm gonna be
[1:01:17] at that place at the foot of the cross
[1:01:19] from there i'm gonna rise into this
[1:01:21] glorious position as a son and daughter
[1:01:23] of god
[1:01:26] let him deny himself and take up his
[1:01:28] cross in mark chapter 10 verses 21 to
[1:01:30] 22. the rich young ruler
[1:01:33] was challenged he kept every every
[1:01:35] commandment from his uh his youth and
[1:01:37] jesus beholding him loved him and said
[1:01:39] unto him
[1:01:40] one thing thou lackest
[1:01:43] go thy way
[1:01:44] sell whatsoever thou hast and give to
[1:01:47] the poor
[1:01:48] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[1:01:50] and
[1:01:51] come take up the cross and follow me
[1:01:55] this is just later after christ has
[1:01:56] already espoused this before he called
[1:01:58] the people unto him and his disciples
[1:02:00] and he's teaching if a man's going to
[1:02:02] follow him he has to take deny himself
[1:02:03] and take up his cross
[1:02:07] so then he's he's amplifying now he's
[1:02:09] putting this into practice and he comes
[1:02:11] to the rich young ruler who seems to
[1:02:12] have everything both morally and
[1:02:14] physically he's a moral man he's a
[1:02:17] wealthy man and yet he's saying you lack
[1:02:18] something because in all your morality
[1:02:20] and all your natural possessions
[1:02:22] something's missing that you're not a
[1:02:23] true servant of god he says so go ahead
[1:02:25] and sell all you have
[1:02:27] give it to the poor take up the cross
[1:02:30] and follow me
[1:02:33] he was living unto himself alone
[1:02:37] through all his morality in all of his
[1:02:39] possessions all his money
[1:02:42] he was without any other purpose than
[1:02:43] personal gain
[1:02:46] even his morality was a badge of pride
[1:02:48] very quickly
[1:02:49] you know i keep his commandments now
[1:02:50] that you're asking i'm so glad you asked
[1:02:56] he was just living unto himself
[1:02:59] and when we talk about denying yourself
[1:03:02] taking up the cross humbling yourselves
[1:03:05] looking upon the needs of others the
[1:03:07] goal is not poverty the goal is service
[1:03:11] and it's exactly what christ told them
[1:03:12] to do he said sell whatever you have
[1:03:14] he said give to the poor
[1:03:17] don't you know you recognize there's
[1:03:18] something very deliberate in that
[1:03:20] he wasn't like hey sell it to some guy
[1:03:22] and sell at the highest price and
[1:03:24] and make some money off of this he said
[1:03:26] go ahead and take everything that you've
[1:03:28] gained that is value to you and sell it
[1:03:31] and make turn everything you've
[1:03:32] accumulated into something good and give
[1:03:35] it to the poor and then take up your
[1:03:36] cross and start following me and that'll
[1:03:38] begin to resolve what's wrong with you
[1:03:40] because you're too insular you're too
[1:03:42] much about yourself you're too much
[1:03:43] about what you've gained and you think
[1:03:45] you are who you are by what you observe
[1:03:47] and what your possessions are and trust
[1:03:49] me your value is a lot more than what
[1:03:51] you possess and what you do
[1:03:56] and he is taking it
[1:03:58] he is identifying how in some way
[1:04:02] he had to get things in balance before
[1:04:04] he could ever be of service
[1:04:07] and what i'm wanting to express to you
[1:04:08] and maybe just a real chopped up way i i
[1:04:11] see now that what i'm looking at maybe
[1:04:13] doesn't always come out in my heart the
[1:04:15] right way come out of my mouth the way
[1:04:16] it is in my heart
[1:04:18] but we can only only when we've taken
[1:04:20] care of ourselves
[1:04:22] or taking care of our own
[1:04:23] responsibilities
[1:04:25] can we truly take care of others
[1:04:28] bear you on another's birthday
[1:04:29] wait before you do
[1:04:31] paul just starts nailing it
[1:04:34] there you want to bury you your own
[1:04:35] words every man must bear his own burden
[1:04:37] you've got to have your sack packed you
[1:04:39] got to have your backpack on you have
[1:04:40] you have to have your gear you have to
[1:04:42] be prepared you have to be ready and
[1:04:43] then when you're in that position then
[1:04:45] you can go on a rescue mission
[1:04:48] now what lifeguards know if someone's
[1:04:51] drowning
[1:04:52] they they know enough because they're
[1:04:54] prepared they're going to take care of
[1:04:55] themselves they're never going to put
[1:04:56] themselves in a position where they're
[1:04:57] going to drown also and so they're going
[1:04:59] to maintain distance and know how to get
[1:05:01] the right thing out there
[1:05:03] for someone to swim
[1:05:04] someone to be rescued and people who
[1:05:07] don't know will jump in instinctively
[1:05:09] into something and they end up drowning
[1:05:10] themselves
[1:05:11] now you're thinking very literally we
[1:05:13] all think of situations that we might
[1:05:14] know even personally where people have
[1:05:16] been drowning and loved ones jump in to
[1:05:18] try to save them and what happens
[1:05:19] instead of having one person drown you
[1:05:20] have two sometimes you have three
[1:05:22] sometimes you're multiple people because
[1:05:24] they don't they're not prepared
[1:05:25] themselves they don't know how to rescue
[1:05:27] they don't know how to save and they
[1:05:28] just jump into something now take that
[1:05:29] in a spiritual way and you want to
[1:05:31] really quick jump into somebody's
[1:05:32] emotional mess guess who comes out an
[1:05:34] even bigger emotional mess
[1:05:36] come on somebody
[1:05:38] right we do why because you didn't take
[1:05:41] care of yourself first
[1:05:44] in philippians chapter 2 verses 3 to 8
[1:05:47] let nothing be done through strife for
[1:05:49] vainglory but in lowliness of mind let
[1:05:51] each esteem other better than themselves
[1:05:54] look not every man on his own things but
[1:05:56] every man also on the things of others
[1:05:59] these are very striking scriptures no
[1:06:01] pride vainglory strife vainglory
[1:06:03] politicking party making bringing
[1:06:05] followers to yourself but if you're
[1:06:06] going to do anything let it be done
[1:06:07] through loneliness of mind
[1:06:09] clear admonishment esteem each other
[1:06:11] person better than yourselves
[1:06:13] that's a healthy
[1:06:15] a viewpoint like man i am the greatest i
[1:06:18] am the greatest but you are greater
[1:06:21] right
[1:06:22] just as long as you think everybody else
[1:06:23] will be better right someone's the
[1:06:24] better the best the best the best and
[1:06:26] somebody's better that you can have that
[1:06:28] kind of attitude i'm good i'm good i'm
[1:06:30] good but you're gooder
[1:06:32] he says let us esteem each other better
[1:06:34] than yourselves
[1:06:35] look not every man and his own things
[1:06:38] but every man also on the things of
[1:06:40] others
[1:06:41] so this is clear admonishment hey you've
[1:06:43] got to be concerned about other people
[1:06:45] you've got to be looking out after other
[1:06:46] people but then he says this let this
[1:06:49] mind be in you which was also in christ
[1:06:50] jesus now this takes an odd turn right
[1:06:53] no strife or vainglory no arrogance no
[1:06:56] personal ability but loneliness of mind
[1:06:58] you're going to steam others better than
[1:06:59] yourselves so you're going to esteem
[1:07:01] somebody else better than self
[1:07:02] look not on your own things but the
[1:07:04] things of others this real call to
[1:07:05] service a real call to lifting other
[1:07:07] people up but he says but let this mind
[1:07:09] be in you which was in christ who being
[1:07:11] in the form of god
[1:07:15] you following
[1:07:17] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:07:18] god
[1:07:20] you feel me
[1:07:22] i mean this is he in order to do verses
[1:07:25] three and four you've got to have a
[1:07:27] particular mindset that begins with this
[1:07:29] understanding i am made in the likeness
[1:07:31] of god i am made in the image of god i
[1:07:33] am a son or daughter of god and i am
[1:07:36] equal i am called to be co-equal joint
[1:07:38] heirs with christ and he says but made
[1:07:40] of himself of no reputation
[1:07:42] so we do not begin with no reputation
[1:07:45] but we begin with being in the image of
[1:07:46] god who by a new birth or brought into
[1:07:48] relationship with jesus christ who have
[1:07:50] some equality with jesus christ our
[1:07:51] joint heirs but do not need to make of
[1:07:53] ourselves of any reputation but took up
[1:07:55] upon him the form of a servant
[1:07:59] and was made in the likeness of men
[1:08:01] and being found in fashion as a man he
[1:08:04] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:08:06] death even the death of the cross that
[1:08:08] is exactly what we can do as being sons
[1:08:11] and daughters of god we can see our
[1:08:12] position in christ but now through this
[1:08:14] great power and potential and privilege
[1:08:16] we have of being his sons and daughters
[1:08:18] we can take upon ourselves this the form
[1:08:21] of a servant and need not make ourselves
[1:08:23] a reputation
[1:08:24] but just do the good because it's
[1:08:26] required of us not because we need to be
[1:08:28] noticed
[1:08:32] and if we could just catch this because
[1:08:34] i'm running out of time
[1:08:36] i'm not going to pull the front row
[1:08:37] again but i'm running out of time but
[1:08:39] the humiliative humility of christ the
[1:08:42] humility of christ was first born
[1:08:45] from the confidence of christ
[1:08:49] that's what it came
[1:08:50] from it was it was deity expressing
[1:08:53] humility
[1:08:59] brother brahm says and it is i be not
[1:09:00] afraid that's what makes him god to me
[1:09:03] because he humbled
[1:09:04] himself god is in humility
[1:09:08] don't never forget that humility is god
[1:09:10] never boastful it is always humility
[1:09:14] but what makes that so great because god
[1:09:16] is great but he can humble himself
[1:09:19] that's real power a man who can humble
[1:09:21] himself
[1:09:22] show me show me a church that's humble
[1:09:24] and sweet and not arrogant that's the
[1:09:26] church that's got the favor of god in it
[1:09:28] show me a man who can humble himself
[1:09:30] control himself and not run all over the
[1:09:31] building he says that's a man who's got
[1:09:33] more power than the man that runs all
[1:09:34] over the building
[1:09:36] why because it's the greatness it's the
[1:09:38] power that's being channeled correctly
[1:09:42] and these scriptures as i look at them
[1:09:43] and i'm just going to have to summarize
[1:09:45] some of this this language here at the
[1:09:46] end
[1:09:49] lowness of mind to steed other better
[1:09:51] than yourselves look upon the needs of
[1:09:53] others not just your own things
[1:09:56] he starts with this being in the form of
[1:09:57] god thinking of this equality with god
[1:10:01] and then from this position of power
[1:10:04] you're going to become a servant
[1:10:06] from this position of position of
[1:10:08] ability and confidence and knowing who
[1:10:10] you are you're going to become a servant
[1:10:13] we hear the say and it's a true saying
[1:10:15] eternal life is living for others
[1:10:17] so immediately self-denial
[1:10:20] a self-sacrifice giving
[1:10:22] sell all you have take up the cross all
[1:10:24] these images of christianity did it ring
[1:10:26] true that there's times when we're we
[1:10:28] feel that it's expected of us to be
[1:10:30] completely pushed over because that's
[1:10:32] the christian virtue
[1:10:34] and there's a way that we defer there's
[1:10:36] a way that we take a step back there's a
[1:10:38] way that we say we're sorry there's a
[1:10:40] way that we defuse a situation there's a
[1:10:41] way that we can humble ourselves and get
[1:10:43] beneath somebody but that doesn't mean
[1:10:44] that we're just sticking our neck out to
[1:10:46] let them step on it right
[1:10:48] and so it's not that we just make
[1:10:50] ourselves available to be abused and
[1:10:51] make ourselves available to torn down
[1:10:53] and while i guess i'm a christian so i
[1:10:55] can be battered and abused and
[1:10:56] mistreated and all these other things
[1:10:58] that's not that's not the image that
[1:10:59] we're conveying and so we say eternal
[1:11:01] life is living for others let's just
[1:11:03] join that to all that other language and
[1:11:05] imagery i'm trying to bring up we think
[1:11:06] eternal life is living for others if
[1:11:08] we're not careful then we actually turn
[1:11:10] it into eternal life in our minds is
[1:11:13] actually not living for others we're
[1:11:14] dying for others
[1:11:16] you're not living you're killing
[1:11:18] yourself
[1:11:19] you're dying
[1:11:21] and in order to truly live for others we
[1:11:22] have to must we must first appreciate
[1:11:24] the eternal life we possess
[1:11:28] and it's only in recognizing our
[1:11:29] boundaries
[1:11:31] and then addressing barriers
[1:11:33] that we can help others burdens
[1:11:40] i i'm gonna leave
[1:11:42] i think i might just have to leave some
[1:11:43] stuff off here
[1:11:46] when we give
[1:11:49] you're not giving from
[1:11:52] deficit but we give because we've got
[1:11:55] something to give
[1:11:56] and you should value what it is you're
[1:11:58] giving
[1:11:59] the bible not teach us to not cast our
[1:12:01] pearls before swine
[1:12:02] so that means if you have a big bag of
[1:12:04] pearls
[1:12:05] the goal isn't just to get rid of them
[1:12:08] and if you've got virtue and you have
[1:12:09] something to give it's not just give it
[1:12:10] to whoever demands it
[1:12:13] if you've got a life to live for christ
[1:12:15] it doesn't mean you have a life to live
[1:12:17] or to give
[1:12:19] to death at the demands and whims of
[1:12:21] other people
[1:12:23] paul said in second corinthians 12 15
[1:12:25] and i will very gladly spend and be
[1:12:28] spent for you
[1:12:30] what remark what remarkable statement i
[1:12:32] will gladly spend
[1:12:34] and be spent
[1:12:36] there's a humility there isn't there
[1:12:38] there's a sacrifice there there's
[1:12:40] something this is something we're here i
[1:12:41] want to i will gladly very gladly spend
[1:12:44] and be spent for you and it's
[1:12:45] interesting what he reads he says and
[1:12:47] because i'm crafty i exposed your guile
[1:12:49] very humble paul
[1:12:51] but he's he's saying i will very gladly
[1:12:54] spend and be spent for you
[1:12:57] but do you realize that there's an
[1:12:59] acknowledgment of a resource
[1:13:01] and a preciousness of it and that i've
[1:13:05] got something worth spending
[1:13:08] and i'm a resource that i that is
[1:13:10] valuable enough to be given i will very
[1:13:12] gladly spend and even myself be spent
[1:13:15] but it will never work unless you have
[1:13:17] boundaries and know what barriers are
[1:13:20] because you'll never know when to give
[1:13:21] past a barrier and you'll never know
[1:13:23] when to stop beyond a boundary
[1:13:28] but the mica if you could come musicians
[1:13:29] i'll just stop
[1:13:30] there let me say this not every wall is
[1:13:33] a boundary
[1:13:34] sometimes a wall is a barrier
[1:13:41] musicians you can come
[1:13:43] lord help us tonight
[1:13:46] ponder these things
[1:13:51] if i could say this
[1:13:54] boundaries and barriers
[1:13:57] start with yourself first
[1:14:01] not arrogantly
[1:14:02] but soberly
[1:14:05] see yourself
[1:14:08] then you can see others
[1:14:12] luke chapter 6 but john if you want to
[1:14:14] bring that up
[1:14:17] verses 41 and 42
[1:14:20] and why behold is thou the mote that is
[1:14:22] in thy brother's eye but perceiveth not
[1:14:24] the beam that is in thy own eye remember
[1:14:27] bear you one another's burdens but first
[1:14:29] bear your own
[1:14:31] either how can't thou say to thy brother
[1:14:33] brother let me pull out the molt that is
[1:14:35] in thy eye when thy thyself
[1:14:37] thou thyself behold it's not the beam
[1:14:39] that is in thine own eye jesus is being
[1:14:41] really uh
[1:14:44] pointed in his words
[1:14:46] your brother just has a splinter
[1:14:48] just just has a little splinter as i and
[1:14:50] you're over here with the beam
[1:14:52] the moat
[1:14:54] i mean yours is obvious there you're
[1:14:55] just you're really straining i wouldn't
[1:14:56] have seen it if you hadn't said
[1:14:57] something here let me get it out
[1:14:59] and meanwhile they're like whoa what
[1:15:00] about yours
[1:15:01] [Music]
[1:15:03] i want to help you with your marriage
[1:15:04] hey what about yours like some of the
[1:15:07] books we read were like man this guy's
[1:15:08] really figured out how to raise kids
[1:15:09] doesn't have a relationship with his
[1:15:10] kids at all
[1:15:12] like wow this guy's got to be the best
[1:15:13] expert on marriages yeah because he's
[1:15:15] had five of them
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:17] right
[1:15:19] and there is this idea
[1:15:21] of getting your house in order first
[1:15:24] before you try to get somebody else's
[1:15:25] house in order
[1:15:27] my it just seems to be that way
[1:15:29] sometimes
[1:15:30] that the house cleaner is the one with
[1:15:32] the dirtiest house
[1:15:36] that the lawyer is the one without the
[1:15:38] will
[1:15:40] right and the estate planning documents
[1:15:41] that he does every day for his clients
[1:15:43] there's just can be this tendency to
[1:15:45] always give give give give and take care
[1:15:46] of everybody else's needs but yours
[1:15:48] aren't even taken care of
[1:15:50] and i know we look at this scripture and
[1:15:51] it's red and i believe it's appropriate
[1:15:53] to be some sort of a rebuke to those who
[1:15:55] are always out eager to take something
[1:15:57] and deal with somebody else's pain and
[1:15:58] take care of somebody else and resolve
[1:16:00] somebody else's problems and not ever
[1:16:02] take care of their own but just think of
[1:16:04] how innocently sometimes we want to go
[1:16:06] forth to get the sliver out of somebody
[1:16:07] else's eye but you know what how about
[1:16:08] we start with our own eyes
[1:16:12] thou hypocrites so he does kind of it
[1:16:14] does have an edge on it
[1:16:15] cast out first the beam out of the own
[1:16:18] eye
[1:16:19] and then just think of how applicable
[1:16:20] this is on so many levels and then shalt
[1:16:22] thou see clearly to pull out the mold
[1:16:24] that is in thy brother's eye
[1:16:27] i know we're castigated as being uh
[1:16:30] [Music]
[1:16:32] hypocrites but you realize just how
[1:16:35] pointed this is when it speaks to
[1:16:37] service oh here let me help you with
[1:16:39] your burden let me help with you with
[1:16:40] your burden well don't you need to bear
[1:16:42] yours
[1:16:43] first
[1:16:44] don't you need to get balanced don't you
[1:16:46] think don't you think you should take
[1:16:47] care of your sinking ship oh let me put
[1:16:49] your mask on let me put your mask on mom
[1:16:51] don't you think you should put yours on
[1:16:53] first
[1:16:54] be so worried about our kids getting the
[1:16:56] holy ghost so worried about our kids
[1:16:57] doing this so worried about this person
[1:16:58] needs to do that this person needs to
[1:16:59] they all need to get in shape what about
[1:17:01] you get in shape
[1:17:04] it wouldn't be very good for me to be up
[1:17:06] here let's just say that we all came
[1:17:07] here and we're here just to get in fit
[1:17:09] physics get in shape physically and eat
[1:17:11] well and you guys all show up with your
[1:17:12] yoga mats and you're going to be working
[1:17:14] out and jogging and you're going to be
[1:17:15] getting yourself in shape and i'm just
[1:17:17] over here with a bucket of chicken just
[1:17:18] saying yep come on now
[1:17:20] come on exercise eat right drink your
[1:17:23] water
[1:17:24] it's like man practice what you preach
[1:17:26] by there
[1:17:29] and so when jesus is expressing this
[1:17:32] we have to start with our own eye
[1:17:35] because how are you even able to see
[1:17:36] clearly
[1:17:38] until you remove the barrier from your
[1:17:40] eye
[1:17:42] until the barrier it causes you not to
[1:17:44] see the barrier that limits your
[1:17:45] abilities until that barrier is removed
[1:17:48] until you can actually see yourself
[1:17:49] soberly as you ought to be seen then how
[1:17:53] can you ever see somebody else
[1:17:55] because there's an upside and a downside
[1:17:57] that when you see yourself for what you
[1:17:58] are then you also you can be do it in a
[1:18:01] spirit of meekness considering your own
[1:18:02] self really reach out to somebody not
[1:18:04] because you think you're better oh look
[1:18:05] at you again in a big mess you're like
[1:18:07] man brother i feel you i know what
[1:18:08] you're going through
[1:18:10] they go with me but for the grace of god
[1:18:12] you can empathize you're willing to hell
[1:18:14] and not not because you're above
[1:18:16] something lord and utter but you just
[1:18:17] might find the right way to get beneath
[1:18:19] them so that when you're helping them
[1:18:20] you're pushing them up
[1:18:22] and that always makes somebody feel a
[1:18:23] lot better when someone's kind of down
[1:18:25] in the mud with them pushing them up
[1:18:27] then somebody looking down at you in the
[1:18:28] hole and say you're in a hole again huh
[1:18:30] this seems to be happening all the time
[1:18:34] but when we see ourselves properly
[1:18:36] we just it just has this way of leveling
[1:18:38] us
[1:18:40] listen if you could just do this
[1:18:43] you don't ever have to think of yourself
[1:18:44] better just think of yourself as
[1:18:45] something else
[1:18:48] if somebody if somebody has something
[1:18:51] that you don't have
[1:18:53] it's not something better it's just
[1:18:55] something else
[1:18:56] [Music]
[1:18:58] and then it just kind of takes away the
[1:18:59] mattress always trying to compare always
[1:19:01] try to compare
[1:19:03] i'll end on this
[1:19:05] i promise i promise i promise i promise
[1:19:07] i'll end up coming to a boundary
[1:19:10] when it tells us then
[1:19:12] to remove the beam out of our own eye
[1:19:13] it's telling us there has to be some
[1:19:16] lack of hypocrisy humility say i've got
[1:19:18] a problem i need to address it right
[1:19:20] but then realize how there's also some
[1:19:22] self-care involved
[1:19:24] taking care of yourself
[1:19:26] and you're not always the one that's
[1:19:27] broken trying to fix other people
[1:19:30] and so when we live for others and
[1:19:32] there's so many scriptures i'd love to
[1:19:33] use for you for you right now and if
[1:19:34] there's if there's enough inspiration
[1:19:36] and weight still there in the future i
[1:19:38] can just bring this in in this context
[1:19:40] but for to live for others as a husband
[1:19:42] your first others your wife
[1:19:46] to live for others as a parent your next
[1:19:48] other are your children
[1:19:50] because you'll never have a proper
[1:19:52] ministry or help beyond
[1:19:54] your home
[1:19:56] until you've served that first
[1:19:59] some of you say well brother aaron why
[1:20:01] was it you was 45 years old before you
[1:20:03] ever became a pastor hey it took me that
[1:20:05] long
[1:20:06] to finally get everything else in line
[1:20:08] and to learn through the different
[1:20:10] processes of what it takes to serve and
[1:20:12] to humble yourself and go through
[1:20:14] different circumstances to to know what
[1:20:15] it feels like to be sheep there's a lot
[1:20:17] of things a lot of training a lot of
[1:20:18] processes where you step into that
[1:20:20] position not as a novice not as somebody
[1:20:22] that came to him very easy not as
[1:20:23] someone who just got the opportunity a
[1:20:25] young age but i can step in and say lord
[1:20:27] i know even if i'm not very good at it i
[1:20:29] know my responsibility first to my wife
[1:20:31] and then my children
[1:20:33] and i know that no matter regardless of
[1:20:35] what kind of success i can have as a
[1:20:36] pastor it'll always be undermined if i'm
[1:20:39] not successful as a husband and as a
[1:20:40] father
[1:20:42] because that's where my first service is
[1:20:44] to living for others begins in my family
[1:20:47] begins at home charity begins where
[1:20:49] at home
[1:20:51] and so if you're being pulled to serve
[1:20:53] you're being called to serve other
[1:20:55] people you're being called to give and
[1:20:56] to give and to give if you're in your
[1:20:58] mind you have you want to just take
[1:21:00] opportunities to help everybody else but
[1:21:02] you're not willing to first serve at
[1:21:04] home
[1:21:06] you're probably crossing somebody else's
[1:21:07] barrier
[1:21:10] and not removing the beam from your own
[1:21:12] eye
[1:21:13] oh just stand with me or i'll just keep
[1:21:14] going
[1:21:17] there's a lot there isn't there
[1:21:20] there's a lot there
[1:21:22] god bless you tonight
[1:21:25] as the lord of the lord spoke to your
[1:21:27] hearts
[1:21:28] has it been personal
[1:21:31] would you could you admit tonight that i
[1:21:32] could get a lot more detail than i have
[1:21:37] and then for you hopefully what's
[1:21:38] happening
[1:21:39] is the holy spirit's doing its own
[1:21:41] discerning in your life
[1:21:42] and it doesn't mean i have to stand up
[1:21:44] here and bring attention to myself and
[1:21:45] say you who lives at one two one two
[1:21:47] west way
[1:21:49] and call your name out but make it even
[1:21:51] more personal that god could deliver a
[1:21:53] word that begins to uncover the things
[1:21:55] in our hearts
[1:21:57] and that's his grace
[1:21:59] and do you love him tonight
[1:22:01] isn't it good to us
