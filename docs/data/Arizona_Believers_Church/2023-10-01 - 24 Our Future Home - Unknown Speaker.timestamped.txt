[0:00] my title today is our future home I'm
[0:03] not sure if there'll be a a second part
[0:06] to this or we may just use a little bit
[0:07] of a different title but um we're
[0:09] looking at the subject of our future
[0:11] home the theme today I think is going to
[0:14] center a lot on Redemption and God's
[0:16] Plan of Redemption and there's just a
[0:19] lot of things that have been impressed
[0:20] upon my heart a lot of things have very
[0:22] heavy in my spirit to minister a lot of
[0:25] things that we've been ministering on
[0:26] over the last month or so on character
[0:29] expression the order and the home and
[0:30] those things we like to continue on but
[0:33] I just feel impressed to kind of zero in
[0:35] on the original inspiration for the
[0:37] subject of Heaven's mystery Earth glory
[0:40] and to
[0:42] uh and kind of the very things that
[0:44] we've been pointing to over the last
[0:46] several services from the very beginning
[0:47] of this so there'll be a lot of things
[0:48] that maybe sound familiar to you but
[0:51] it's uh there's this theme of within the
[0:54] sermon future home that really caught my
[0:56] attention and it spoke to me about how
[0:58] and I was studying on the life of Paul
[1:00] and it spoke to me on how that this
[1:03] future home that exists uh we live there
[1:07] are certain things about this this theme
[1:08] in the future home there was things
[1:09] about it I realized that we live in
[1:11] right now and I'm sure that some of you
[1:13] can recall that as you read the sermon
[1:15] future home the way that brother Branham
[1:17] emphasizes it that it's it's the future
[1:20] home is so imminent that brother bam
[1:22] doesn't even really spend much on the
[1:24] Millennium and it's as if there's the
[1:26] very next thing is that Eighth Day and
[1:29] he tells us that even our souls are
[1:30] already resurrected in that position and
[1:32] so there's just a lot of things that
[1:33] begin to realize and that principle that
[1:36] we're just going to emphasize a lot
[1:37] today on how program talks about the
[1:39] Earth being preserved that there's
[1:41] things about the future that relate to
[1:44] where we are right now and that the
[1:46] Earth is just not a throwaway
[1:48] well I think we could all we'd all say
[1:50] well this life is not a throwaway and
[1:52] this this world this life is a Proving
[1:53] Grounds there's a lot of things we might
[1:55] say but even just to slightly get that
[1:58] out of balance like ah one day this is
[1:59] going to all be gone and we choose
[2:01] between heaven and hell kind of waters
[2:03] down some things in my opinion at least
[2:05] in my heart as I was looking at it and
[2:08] the kingdom of heaven that's going to be
[2:10] established it's not just going to
[2:11] abandon the Earth it's not just going to
[2:14] be done away with and so we've been
[2:15] pointing at that quite a bit over the
[2:16] last several services and so I just want
[2:18] to bring that out in the sermon future
[2:21] home today now in Revelations chapter 1
[2:25] verse 6
[2:26] it says and this is going to pick up
[2:28] from the Wednesday night uh the last
[2:30] time that we ministered he says and hath
[2:32] made us Kings and Priests unto God and
[2:35] his father to him be glory and Dominion
[2:38] forever and ever we have been made it
[2:42] says Kings and Priests unto God
[2:45] and it says to him be glory and Dominion
[2:48] forever and ever and I think it's a key
[2:50] phrase to the very idea that we have
[2:52] been made Kings and Priests brother
[2:54] Brahman said this is one of those truths
[2:56] that needs to be emphasized and he says
[2:59] that the importance of Revelation to the
[3:01] True Believer can never be over
[3:02] emphasized and so there's a this is a
[3:05] truth it needs to be emphasized I say
[3:07] the revelation of this truth cannot be
[3:10] over emphasized that there is a
[3:12] spiritual Kingdom in effect right now he
[3:15] hath brother Branham uses that in in the
[3:18] churches but he hath made us Kings and
[3:20] Priests not will make us Kings and
[3:22] Priests but he hath made us Kings and
[3:24] Priests and being made a king we have
[3:27] dominion being made a priest we have a
[3:29] service we have something we ought to do
[3:30] so we have been made Kings and Priests
[3:33] right now with power over worldly
[3:35] Kingdoms brother Branham says in the
[3:38] church age book
[3:40] and I'd like to uh you know zero in on
[3:43] God's purpose because we'll come to that
[3:45] out of the future home he says he
[3:46] redeemed us for a purpose he bought us
[3:49] for purpose there's a purpose uh in
[3:51] redeeming us there's a purpose in buying
[3:53] us not just for the sake of redemption
[3:56] alone but he has a reason for doing it
[3:57] we are his King's spiritual Kings
[4:01] and this is where brother Brown kind of
[4:03] acknowledges he says oh we're going to
[4:04] be Kings upon the earth when him when he
[4:06] sits on his throne so there's going to
[4:08] be a domain if we could even look at it
[4:10] as far as the Millennium in the
[4:12] millennial Reign the king of the son of
[4:13] David reigning on his throne for a
[4:15] thousand years and that has uh
[4:18] implications and that's a that's a
[4:19] kingdom and it's a kingdom Reign and
[4:21] that's a Dominion uh yet it's not
[4:23] without opposition because we know
[4:25] there's going to be another battle
[4:27] there's going to be judgments that come
[4:29] and then we know that there will be an
[4:31] eighth day there's going to be a rain a
[4:33] glorious rain that will be an eternal
[4:34] rain that Without End we'll want to
[4:36] emphasize that a lot this morning he
[4:38] says we will one day Reign upon Earth
[4:40] with him when he sits on his throne he
[4:41] says but now we are spiritual Kings and
[4:45] we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom
[4:48] now that's uh that's something that
[4:51] needs to be emphasized because he says
[4:52] he hath made us Kings then the emphasis
[4:55] is to understand really what does that
[4:57] even mean and what's the point and what
[4:59] does it mean to be made a king and I
[5:02] think there's a way that we look at this
[5:03] and say that I I'm a spiritual King and
[5:05] I ran over spiritual Kingdom we might we
[5:08] might think in a sense of well that's
[5:10] the the message and that's the word of
[5:12] God and that's church and that's my home
[5:14] and there's a way that maybe we try to
[5:16] identify certain things and what's a
[5:17] spiritual Kingdom so we think of the
[5:19] elements of church and we think the
[5:20] elements of religion and the elements of
[5:22] a Christian life but brother Graham says
[5:24] right now we reign with Christ having
[5:26] dominion over sin the World the Flesh
[5:31] and the devil
[5:32] he doesn't say over church over parking
[5:35] spaces over seats in the sanctuary Over
[5:37] Feet washing and communion and all these
[5:39] different things and over leading
[5:41] worshiper over the base it doesn't
[5:43] that's not even he doesn't even bring
[5:45] the elements of those kind of things
[5:46] when it comes to Christian Life and of
[5:48] you he says right now we reign as
[5:50] spiritual Kings in a spiritual Kingdom
[5:52] and we have dominion over sin the World
[5:56] the Flesh and the devil showing forth
[5:59] his praise and glory showing forth
[6:01] himself how do we show it how do we show
[6:03] forth Christ by the Dominion that we
[6:06] exercise
[6:07] showing forth himself for it is Christ
[6:09] in US willing and doing of his good
[6:11] pleasure
[6:12] when he uses the phrase Dominion means
[6:14] control over
[6:15] it means the government Dominion is just
[6:18] another word for Domination
[6:20] and in the scripture when man was given
[6:22] Dominion it was the right to dominate it
[6:24] was to possess absolute control over so
[6:28] right now as spiritual Kings we are to
[6:30] dominate sin we are to dominate the
[6:33] world we're to dominate The Flesh we're
[6:35] to dominate The Devil so if there's any
[6:37] denomination that we believe in it's the
[6:39] domination of the devil it's the
[6:41] domination of sin the World the Flesh
[6:43] and the devil we believe that we right
[6:46] now are spiritual Kings with a dominion
[6:48] over those things the right to
[6:50] absolutely control it
[6:53] the Bible says right now we've been made
[6:55] Kings and Priests now I want to point in
[6:57] this direction for a moment and I think
[7:00] there's a lot that you can mine out in
[7:01] this I'm kind of just setting it out
[7:03] there with the emphasis on how that we
[7:05] are made Kings and Priests but there's
[7:07] certainly an end time element to this I
[7:09] think we should consider and when the
[7:11] seven the book was open the book of
[7:13] redemption those seals were loosed it
[7:14] says they sung a new song
[7:16] Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to
[7:18] open the seals thereof for thou were
[7:21] slain and has redeemed us to God by the
[7:23] blood out of every Kindred tongue in
[7:25] people and Nation
[7:26] and have made us unto our God Kings and
[7:29] Priests he says and we shall reign on
[7:33] the Earth
[7:34] now these that are in heaven at the time
[7:36] singing this song as John was caught up
[7:39] in Revelations chapter four he's there
[7:40] in heaven these Elders are singing this
[7:43] song Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[7:45] and to loose it the seals thereof and
[7:47] redeemed us and you have made us unto
[7:51] God Kings and Priests and now he says
[7:53] and we shall reign on the earth now that
[7:57] doesn't do away with the current rain
[7:58] but it points to a future ring a future
[8:01] time and brother bam takes this in the
[8:03] first seal and he says the Saints under
[8:04] the altar screamed out where the art
[8:06] thou lamb for you have redeemed us and
[8:08] you've made us Kings and Priests and we
[8:10] shall rule on the earth he says oh my in
[8:12] that so when he opened that book
[8:15] now the the way this strikes me is that
[8:19] there's something about the rule on
[8:21] earth when that book is open now just I
[8:24] wouldn't ask you to necessarily humor me
[8:26] but just just give me a moment just to
[8:29] kind of refer to things some quickly and
[8:31] if it doesn't quite connect for you
[8:33] there's something to pray about
[8:34] something digging to the message about
[8:35] but if this book is the title deed to
[8:38] Redemption and it represents everything
[8:40] Adam lost in the fall Dominion control
[8:43] and fellowship and now that book is
[8:45] being opened and it's coming back down
[8:47] to earth in Revelations chapter 10 then
[8:49] it has something to do with the bride
[8:51] receiving power and receiving the rights
[8:54] of redemption to have Absolute Total
[8:56] Control so he says in that Saul when he
[8:59] opened the book I believe that something
[9:01] is being ushered in at the time that
[9:03] this book has been delivered to the
[9:04] bride the time that we're taking it and
[9:06] eat it to where now there is a
[9:08] dispensation of dominion that has been
[9:10] dispensed and given to his bride
[9:15] and brother Brandon when he's preaching
[9:17] uh the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[9:19] he's preaching those the church ages he
[9:21] takes Revelations chapter four part two
[9:23] he's preaching on the the four and 24
[9:25] Elders he says
[9:28] he says this first he was in heaven
[9:30] above
[9:32] and shining in the Stars
[9:34] second he's talking about The Throne a
[9:36] lot of us in Parts one and two he's
[9:38] focusing a lot on the throne in those
[9:40] verses as he's just using Revelations
[9:42] chapter four and describing that before
[9:44] you get to the scene of Revelations 5.
[9:46] and it's just so beautiful how he
[9:48] carries that in setting the scene when
[9:50] he's preaching the church ages because
[9:51] he sensed that something was happening
[9:53] he sensed that something was coming and
[9:55] it's the very events of Revelations
[9:56] chapter 5 that come after that
[9:59] so he says he was in heaven the heavens
[10:01] above shine in the stars the second he
[10:04] was on Earth shining through the
[10:05] Shekinah Glory next he come and was made
[10:08] flesh and dwelt Among Us still wearing
[10:11] his patience and he's talking about
[10:13] blaspheming the Holy Ghost and Jesus
[10:15] saying that day is going to come and
[10:16] when you do there'll be no more
[10:18] forgiveness for that then he redeemed
[10:20] Man by his blood came into his church in
[10:22] the form of the Holy Ghost and speak
[10:24] against that it's a finished thing done
[10:28] this is very remarkable things that he's
[10:30] saying and he touches on it in the two
[10:32] sermons he preaches on Revelations
[10:33] chapter four he says now you can see
[10:36] where the shaking come where at the end
[10:38] time they don't realize people can't
[10:41] comprehend what it means
[10:43] and he refers to this a few times over
[10:45] those two days
[10:46] um here it's January 1 and the night
[10:48] before he's referring to it how God is
[10:51] moving God is doing things and it's not
[10:53] in the way that the world would think it
[10:55] should be and it's not in the big flashy
[10:57] flowery things it's not in the great big
[10:58] things but God was doing it in such a
[11:00] humble way and the world was rejecting
[11:02] it why because the kingdom manifests
[11:05] itself in a way that's different than
[11:06] how humans perceive how the kingdom
[11:08] ought to manifest itself
[11:10] I says this is where that shaking comes
[11:12] and the people just can't comprehend it
[11:14] and it's God who at one time was in the
[11:17] heavens who then was manifest himself in
[11:19] the Shekinah Glory Then Came In the
[11:21] Flesh of his son who said you can speak
[11:22] against me but if you speak against the
[11:24] holy ghost that will not be forgiven you
[11:26] then he says he came into the church in
[11:28] the form of the Holy Ghost so then he
[11:29] summarizes it this way now the first
[11:31] Throne was in heaven the Judgment seat
[11:33] the second Throne was in Christ the
[11:37] third Throne is in manner
[11:39] that's quite a statement
[11:41] God who is in the heavens and then Moses
[11:45] patterned the Tabernacle uh the the
[11:47] Tabernacle in the wilderness after what
[11:49] he saw in heaven and so he's describing
[11:51] brother Brown in these areas around this
[11:53] is talking about the mercy seat and
[11:55] God's judgment seat and that's what he's
[11:57] referring to he says the first Throne
[11:59] was in heaven then it was patterned in
[12:01] the Tabernacle on the holy of holies The
[12:03] Mercy Seat was there and then he says
[12:05] that was in Christ
[12:07] so this is the mercy seat or the throne
[12:09] and think about those elements the
[12:10] throne and The Mercy Seat being one
[12:12] thing that's quite a quite an image to
[12:14] gather together but now he says that
[12:16] God's Throne is in the Earth right now
[12:19] God's Throne is in flesh right now so we
[12:23] say well God is in the heavens and he's
[12:25] the god of the the Heights and he's the
[12:27] god of the stars but he's not just a God
[12:30] in heaven who has a a throne that Moses
[12:33] patterned in the Tabernacle in the
[12:35] wilderness but now his throne is in
[12:37] Earth right now in flesh
[12:40] his throne is
[12:42] n't it now
[12:44] you would if someone has a kingdom and
[12:46] they set up a throne
[12:48] that Throne is typically in some sort of
[12:51] fortified place
[12:53] that is where it exercises Dominion
[12:58] that is like maybe the focal point of
[12:59] the center part of the kingdom and it's
[13:01] like hey if you want to see the king you
[13:03] got to go to where the castle is you got
[13:04] to go you got to go to the house of
[13:06] government you got to go to the place
[13:07] where he is and even that Throne
[13:09] symbolizes his authority in power and it
[13:13] doesn't just where it's anchored isn't
[13:15] his soul place of authority but it shows
[13:18] where the throne is the the kingdom is
[13:21] there the Dominion is there
[13:24] we need to really consider the
[13:27] implications of that
[13:29] so there is a present Dominion
[13:32] and as brother Brown says oh we're going
[13:33] to be Kings upon the Earth with him when
[13:35] he sits on his throne and we could
[13:37] either look at the millennial Kingdom or
[13:38] that perfect Kingdom that's coming I
[13:41] would say the perfect Kingdom that is
[13:42] coming
[13:44] is reflected in our current position in
[13:46] Christ
[13:48] it's it's reflected right now
[13:51] in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 6 it says
[13:53] in hath raised us up together
[13:56] and made us sit together in Heavenly
[13:59] places in Christ Jesus
[14:02] you are his bride right now you're not
[14:06] going to be but right now you are you
[14:08] are Daughters of God now you are sons of
[14:10] God now you're not will be but you are
[14:12] those things right now
[14:15] so there's a we have to consider that if
[14:17] I am his bride now I need to think about
[14:20] my authority right now and and the the
[14:23] power that is exercised by that
[14:25] Authority
[14:26] brother Brandon says in the sermon a
[14:28] greater than Solomon is here it says
[14:30] we're sitting in Heavenly places in the
[14:32] presence of Christ Lift It Up Above the
[14:35] cares of the world into a realm of faith
[14:39] now if there's
[14:41] if there's a part of you that likes to
[14:43] think that the Heavenly places just
[14:45] exist between Beyond these uh in here
[14:47] Beyond these uh French doors or these
[14:50] doors that we walk through into this
[14:51] Sanctuary that's not what's referred to
[14:53] he says we're seated in Heavenly places
[14:55] in Christ Jesus Paul didn't write this
[14:57] letter to the Ephesian church and send
[14:58] it to their church address and say but
[15:01] you can only read this and believe this
[15:02] when you're in the sanctuary he's
[15:04] talking about the Believers every day
[15:05] condition and position is that we are
[15:08] made to sit together that's placed
[15:11] positionally in Heavenly places in
[15:13] Christ
[15:14] therefore it's not just when we come
[15:16] here and we've sung songs for 20 to 25
[15:18] minutes that were lifted above the cares
[15:21] of this world whether you feel it or not
[15:23] you should confess that I positionally
[15:26] am above the cares of this world whether
[15:28] you can see it whether you can feel it
[15:30] and I'd say even if you don't believe it
[15:32] get your mouth to talking to it oh come
[15:34] on it's so easy for us to tell a little
[15:36] bit of white lies and say well I'm on my
[15:38] way and we haven't even left our bedroom
[15:40] and it's so easy to say that how come we
[15:43] can't just say I'm lifted above the
[15:45] cares of this world even if we don't
[15:47] think it
[15:50] start putting the word on our lips
[15:53] lift it up above the cares of this world
[15:55] he says into a realm of faith
[15:58] we ministered on this from this
[16:00] statement we're preaching on faith and
[16:02] uh Divine Healing that we are in a realm
[16:05] of faith that means a kingdom the very
[16:07] word realm speaks of the Kingdom or a
[16:09] domain of life
[16:11] so realm is not just a space that we've
[16:13] carved out as a sanctuary realm is not
[16:16] an atmosphere that we try to get
[16:18] ourselves into by meditation this realm
[16:20] is a domain of life it's where we're
[16:22] living now
[16:24] Heavenly places is a state of being
[16:26] connected with that perfect Kingdom
[16:29] it's a Heavenly places is a state of
[16:32] being right now that's connected with
[16:33] that perfect existence
[16:35] it's Heavenly on Earth
[16:38] we are made to sit together in Heavenly
[16:40] places in Christ Jesus if my spiritual
[16:43] baptism or baptism baptized into the
[16:45] body of Christ and I believe that I'm
[16:47] there positionally in a supernatural
[16:50] spiritual way my soul is now fused
[16:52] together with God by that baptism of the
[16:54] Holy Ghost and I'm in the body of Christ
[16:56] that is Heavenly on Earth
[16:59] and look at that in two ways it's it's
[17:02] Heavenly in this flesh which is Earth
[17:04] but now it's his throne in Earth
[17:09] now in Ephesians chapter one we're going
[17:11] to back up to what he mentions before
[17:13] because he has raised us up to sit in
[17:16] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so we're
[17:19] in Christ Jesus now let's just find
[17:20] where he is
[17:22] and Paul will start with verse 15
[17:23] because I just love this background
[17:25] these words he uses of the the church at
[17:27] Ephesus wherefore I also after I heard
[17:29] of your faith in the Lord Jesus in love
[17:31] unto all Saints cease not to give thanks
[17:33] for you making mention of you in my
[17:35] prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus
[17:38] the father of Glory may give unto you
[17:40] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[17:43] the knowledge of him what was his prayer
[17:44] for the Ephesian Church
[17:47] a spirit of wisdom in Revelation and the
[17:49] knowledge of him
[17:50] the eyes of your understanding being
[17:52] enlightened
[17:54] that you may know what is the hope of
[17:55] his calling these are the things that he
[17:57] desired for the Ephesian Church remember
[18:00] brother Brown says Ephesians parallels
[18:01] Joshua and the Ephesian church was being
[18:03] positionally placed with the Corinthian
[18:05] Church a lot of Correction a lot of
[18:07] place in the gifts and trying to get
[18:08] every you know ones trying to have the
[18:09] premise with this and one brings this
[18:11] and one brings that there's a lot of
[18:12] carnality in the Corinthian Church and
[18:14] it manifested in the things that Paul's
[18:16] having to address but now when it comes
[18:17] to the Ephesian church he has he hasn't
[18:19] he hasn't needing to address that he
[18:21] says you've got to go into the knowledge
[18:22] of him understand and be enlightened to
[18:25] know the hope of his calling and what
[18:27] the riches of the glory of his
[18:28] inheritance in the Saints
[18:30] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[18:33] his power to us word who believe
[18:35] according to the working of his mighty
[18:37] power so these are great statements and
[18:39] prayers for us he says which he wrought
[18:42] in Christ when he raised him from the
[18:44] dead and set him at his own right hand
[18:49] in the Heavenly places
[18:51] so when Paul writes in Chapter 2 that
[18:53] he's raised us up together and made us
[18:55] sit together in Heavenly places in
[18:57] Christ Jesus He is wanting the Ephesians
[18:59] believers who read this to think about
[19:01] what is intended by saying we sit in
[19:04] Christ in Heavenly places because Christ
[19:07] has set down at the right hand but I
[19:09] said right hand means in power and
[19:10] authority of God it doesn't necessarily
[19:13] mean the literal right hand but it
[19:14] speaks of the power and authority of God
[19:16] we have been made to sit together in
[19:18] Heavenly places in Christ where is this
[19:21] believer's position in Christ says at
[19:23] the right hand in the Heavenly places
[19:25] far above all principality and power and
[19:29] might and Dominion in every name that is
[19:32] named not only in this world but also in
[19:34] that which is to come that tells you
[19:36] something about this Dominion everything
[19:38] that is in the earth now and everything
[19:40] that will be and hath put all things
[19:42] under his feet and gave him to be the
[19:44] head over all things to the church the
[19:47] church which is his body the church
[19:49] which is the fullness of him that
[19:51] filleth all and all
[19:53] you are his body you are his voice and
[19:56] the bride is the fullness of him that
[19:59] finishes all
[20:02] and there at the right hand in Heavenly
[20:04] places it is above all principality
[20:06] which speaks of the first place a rule
[20:09] or magistrate if one is a principality
[20:11] they're the chief the leader the ruler
[20:13] they're in Christ and Heavenly places
[20:15] you are above every leader every ruler
[20:17] every Chief far above every Power which
[20:20] is the power of authority and influence
[20:22] or the right of influence the right of
[20:25] power just because One Believes then
[20:28] even to say far above every Power just
[20:30] because they have a right doesn't mean
[20:32] you have to let them
[20:36] speaks of government whether by
[20:38] relationship or judge what the the right
[20:40] to influence by relationship by position
[20:44] far above every might the power and
[20:46] influence because of wealth
[20:48] power and influence arising from numbers
[20:50] or forces or people this is what he's
[20:53] using Pharma principality power in might
[20:55] doesn't matter how many resources they
[20:57] have it doesn't matter how rich they
[20:58] have doesn't matter how many people they
[21:00] have in Christ we are far above
[21:02] principality power might and Dominion
[21:04] which is any government any power any
[21:06] lordship
[21:08] over any anyone who possesses Dominion
[21:12] so if someone has a domain of influence
[21:14] and a sphere of influence he's saying
[21:15] you're above it
[21:18] and they may have control in this realm
[21:19] they have control in that realm but you
[21:21] have power over them that gives you
[21:23] power although over their domains you
[21:25] have power to bind the greatest and the
[21:27] least they can say well this is my
[21:29] domain I'm the ruler I have authority I
[21:31] have a right to this I have a right to
[21:32] that I have a right to the body I have a
[21:34] right to cause this I have a right to
[21:35] cause that I have a writer that you have
[21:37] power over it
[21:42] now I hope this isn't too much of a a
[21:45] turn here
[21:47] but I I had moved these statements and
[21:50] scriptures around several times just
[21:52] figuring which should go first which
[21:53] should go first and this is the way that
[21:55] it ended up and I didn't just randomize
[21:57] it or ask uh being AI to you know tell
[22:00] me which way it should go but this is
[22:02] just where I felt impressed to bring it
[22:03] now this is a little bit of a step
[22:05] forward
[22:07] but I want I hope that we've established
[22:10] right now we are Kings and Priests
[22:13] that one's the future home brother
[22:14] Branham and we are his body the fullest
[22:17] of him that filleth all in all that's
[22:18] the body of Christ that's his bride
[22:20] now in the sermon the future home
[22:22] over the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[22:24] Earthly bride brother Branham draws this
[22:27] parallel over and over again it's one of
[22:28] the main themes to it between the bride
[22:30] and the Earth
[22:32] and there is a there is a reference to
[22:34] the bride he kind of uses the Bride As
[22:36] we already understand this we know this
[22:37] and then he looks at the Earth in a
[22:40] future sense to say now what he's done
[22:41] here he's going to do there and I'm
[22:43] going to go over this for a little bit
[22:44] he says we understand that this great
[22:45] home of the Bride is to be here on Earth
[22:48] so what I'm wanting you to uh to think
[22:51] about is the future is now
[22:54] we have a we have a Reign spiritual
[22:57] Kings right now we are right now in a
[22:59] realm of faith and we are seated in
[23:01] Heavenly places which is that right and
[23:03] the power and authority of God over all
[23:06] principality power might and Dominion
[23:08] right now
[23:09] and he says we understand that the great
[23:11] home of the Bride is to be here on Earth
[23:14] but right now where it's it's okay to
[23:17] sing this world is not my home I'm just
[23:19] passing through because we see the
[23:21] cosmos of it uh we see the order the
[23:23] governments we see the things around us
[23:25] and we look out and we realize uh that
[23:27] these things aren't or what God
[23:30] envisioned in his mind to be our
[23:32] inheritance this isn't the Garden of
[23:34] Eden this is what Satan's eating this is
[23:36] when the devil's made something of this
[23:38] and so I say this world is not my home
[23:40] I'm just passing through it doesn't mean
[23:42] that this Earth is a temporary stop
[23:45] before we go to an eternal heaven and
[23:47] then somehow this is just forgotten and
[23:48] left to the demons he's saying that the
[23:51] bride will have the great home of the
[23:53] Bride will be on Earth right now
[23:56] so where we are now is our future home
[23:59] right I know there's Babies there may be
[24:02] some things there you'd want me to kind
[24:03] of lay out a little bit more clearly but
[24:05] hopefully we'll see this and then what
[24:07] he does is he kind of outlines
[24:09] how God established a pattern of
[24:11] redemption in the scriptures so he's
[24:13] using numbers and threes and these
[24:15] different things he's talking about
[24:16] Redemption and he takes second Peter
[24:19] chapter three Verses 4 5 6 and 7.
[24:23] and he and he takes this he says and
[24:26] saying where is these are the scoffers
[24:28] and the mockers in the last day saying
[24:30] where is the promise of his come in
[24:33] so for since the fathers fell asleep
[24:37] all things continue as they were from
[24:39] the beginning of the creation now this
[24:41] is something to really chew on and enjoy
[24:43] today when you have that green chili
[24:45] burrito mixed with cheese enchilada
[24:47] style red sauce at Rito's
[24:50] the promise of his coming
[24:53] and how the perception is nothing's
[24:56] changed
[24:57] everything's just the way that it was
[24:59] from the beginning
[25:00] he says for this they willingly are
[25:02] ignorant of
[25:04] there's just a lot to chew on here a lot
[25:06] to ponder
[25:08] that by the word of God the heavens were
[25:11] of old and the Earth standing out of the
[25:13] water and in the water he's going all
[25:16] the way back to the beginning
[25:19] he said they said where's the promise of
[25:20] his coming nothing's changed since the
[25:23] beginning of creation and he's saying is
[25:26] that so
[25:27] he says they're ignorant of the fact
[25:29] that the world in the beginning the
[25:30] heavens and the Earth standing out of
[25:31] the water and in the water whereby the
[25:33] world that then was that's the phrase
[25:35] the world that then was that's one world
[25:37] the world that then was being overflowed
[25:40] with water perished
[25:43] so here's think of this the mockers and
[25:46] the scoffers in the end time ah brother
[25:48] Branham said this was going to happen
[25:49] brother man said that was going to
[25:50] happen his mission was to fall on this
[25:52] and where is the promise of his coming
[25:54] nothing's happened for 60 years and
[25:55] where is this and where is that and a
[25:57] lot of talk he says because nothing's
[25:59] changed
[26:01] Peter says these guys are ignorant
[26:03] the world that then was was overflowed
[26:05] with water and perished
[26:08] he says but the heavens and the Earth
[26:09] which are now by the same word
[26:12] are kept in store so the word that then
[26:16] there that then was and the world the
[26:19] heavens and the Earth which we could say
[26:20] which are now of the world which is now
[26:22] there's there's two different worlds we
[26:24] could say the world that then was the
[26:26] world which is now is kept in store by
[26:28] the same word so it's it's waiting it's
[26:30] being preserved reserved unto fire
[26:33] against the day of judgment and
[26:35] Perdition of ungodly men so he's saying
[26:38] that the world which is now is being
[26:39] reserved for fire on the day of judgment
[26:42] and that's a clear reference to White
[26:43] throne
[26:45] uh and
[26:46] the the the Earth being judged with fire
[26:49] and Peter is describing brother Brown
[26:51] brings this out and other Scholars have
[26:53] done the same and brother Branham even
[26:56] references uh some places where we you
[26:59] can see where he was getting these
[27:00] things and being very precise with it
[27:02] but Peter's describing the three stages
[27:04] of the world or that we could call that
[27:07] the heavens and earth as one one unit he
[27:09] says the world that then was
[27:12] of old and going back to the beginning
[27:14] he's talking about the heavens and earth
[27:16] in the beginning we got God in just one
[27:17] in the beginning God created the heavens
[27:19] and the Earth
[27:20] it says in verse 2 this is chaotic this
[27:23] is confused and the world that then was
[27:24] and the Earth was without form and void
[27:27] and darkness was upon the face of the
[27:29] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[27:31] the face of the waters
[27:33] this is the world that then was
[27:35] and now it's chaotic it's confused and
[27:38] it's Darkness it's just this Mass it's
[27:40] indistinguishable standing out of the
[27:42] water in the water water overflowing it
[27:44] and he says the spirit of God moved upon
[27:47] the face of the waters
[27:48] brother Brown says in God's power to
[27:50] transform in Genesis 1 this world was
[27:52] without form and it was void Darkness
[27:54] was upon the Earth nothing but a
[27:56] complete chaos and when this world was
[27:58] in that condition the spirit of God
[28:00] moved upon the face of the water and the
[28:03] entire picture this is the part I want
[28:05] you to catch the entire picture was
[28:07] changed from a total chaos to a Garden
[28:09] of Eden
[28:11] and now this the world that then was was
[28:15] overflowed with water and it's changed
[28:18] from Total Chaos to a Garden of Eden
[28:20] belram said that's the transforming
[28:22] power of God that can take something
[28:24] that's nothing and makes something
[28:26] wonderful out of it
[28:29] so Peter says there's a world that then
[28:31] was God transforms the world that then
[28:34] was to the heavens and the Earth which
[28:36] are now
[28:37] you catch that the world that then was
[28:40] he says they're ignorant they're they
[28:42] since the beginning everything's been
[28:43] the same where's the promise of his
[28:44] coming so things haven't been changed
[28:46] the way they think they ought to but God
[28:48] is transformed he says you're ignorant
[28:50] because the world that then was was
[28:51] transformed to the heavens Earth which
[28:53] are now
[28:54] let's skip to verse 10. because now he's
[28:57] going to bring come back to this
[28:59] world that is now that's reserved for
[29:01] fire against the day of judgment but the
[29:04] day of the Lord will come as a thief in
[29:05] the night
[29:06] in the which the heaven shall pass away
[29:09] with the great noise
[29:11] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[29:14] Heat
[29:15] and the Earth also and the works that
[29:17] are therein shall be burned up
[29:19] now that's that is the
[29:22] world the heavens and earth which are
[29:25] now so you've got to look at verse 7.
[29:27] and verse 10 is describing
[29:30] how it's kept in store reserved unto
[29:32] fire against the day of judgment the
[29:33] prediction of ungodly men he says when
[29:34] the heaven shall pass away with great
[29:36] noise the elements will melt with
[29:37] fervent heat the earth and the works
[29:38] that are in the shall be burned up
[29:41] now Paul thinking about this says see
[29:43] and then Peter rather saying then that
[29:45] all these things shall be dissolved
[29:48] what mannered persons the heavens and
[29:50] the Earth he's referring to what
[29:51] mannered persons ought you to be in all
[29:54] holy conversation and godliness the
[29:56] heavens will pass away the Earth is
[29:57] going to be dissolved these things are
[29:59] going to uh this is gonna happen what
[30:01] men are persons ought to be to be in all
[30:03] holy conversation and godliness right
[30:05] now
[30:07] looking for and Hasting unto the coming
[30:09] of the day of God wherein again he
[30:12] describes it where in the heavens being
[30:13] on fire shall be dissolved and the
[30:15] element shall melt with fervent Heat
[30:17] this is the heavens and the things that
[30:19] make up the Earth he says going to melt
[30:20] with fervent heat so nevertheless we
[30:22] according to his promise look for new
[30:24] heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelth
[30:26] righteousness
[30:27] Peter sets forth this image
[30:30] of the heavens and the Earth and I think
[30:32] that that would be the world because we
[30:34] have the the actual Earth the things
[30:36] that we can see the what we're grounded
[30:38] to it gravity tells us to and then the
[30:41] atmosphere is above the the holds in the
[30:44] elements and the oxygen of the ecosystem
[30:46] keeps it together how it is that's the
[30:49] world he says it's going to be they're
[30:50] going to be on fire they're going to be
[30:52] dissolved met with fervent Heat
[30:54] he says but we look for I say that
[30:56] they're all going to be melted and
[30:58] dissolved he says but there's new ones
[30:59] emerging
[31:01] we're going to see heavens and earth
[31:03] dissolved but we are going we're looking
[31:06] for new heavens and a new Earth
[31:08] now in Revelations chapter 21 verse 1
[31:12] . John says and I saw a new Heaven and a
[31:14] new Earth
[31:15] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[31:17] were passed away and there was no more
[31:21] sea
[31:24] as Peter wrote the heaven shall pass
[31:26] away with the great noise the Earth also
[31:29] and the works that they're in shall be
[31:30] burned up John now says I see the new
[31:33] Heaven and new earth the ones that Peter
[31:35] said in verse 13 he was looking for new
[31:37] heavens and a new Earth now John sees
[31:39] them coming or he sees them and he says
[31:42] the first Heaven on the first Earth were
[31:43] passed away and there was no more sea
[31:47] you I'm not
[31:49] brother Branham a lot of these things
[31:52] are just even accepted broadly the
[31:54] Birmingham is focusing on some things I
[31:55] want to come to in a moment to me that's
[31:57] the real the real meat to this
[31:59] but as we read this this is what brother
[32:00] Branham points out and this is what's
[32:02] looking at is you look at these
[32:03] Scriptures it may seem like that the
[32:06] world which is now
[32:07] in second Peter is going to be destroyed
[32:09] entirely the world being the heavens and
[32:11] the Earth and cease to exist going to
[32:14] melt away
[32:15] if something melts it's gone yeah that's
[32:18] why some speculate that an ice pick
[32:19] would be an icicle would be the perfect
[32:21] murder weapon right because it once it
[32:24] melts it's gone no fingerprints no
[32:26] evidence you know maybe just a puddle of
[32:28] water and you know huckle cat could
[32:30] figure it out and say ah it must have
[32:31] been an icicle but there's a
[32:34] this is when something melts it
[32:36] dissipates it changes and even it's
[32:38] evaporating there's something here that
[32:40] Peters look at saying oh Heaven's gone
[32:42] Earth Gone dissolved when something
[32:45] dissolves it loses its distinction it's
[32:47] completely gone
[32:49] but verse 5 and II Peter
[32:52] chapter 3 says that the world that then
[32:54] was perished
[32:57] how do you catch that it perished now we
[32:59] think something perishes it's gone
[33:01] but when he's what he's describing the
[33:03] world that then was being overflowed
[33:04] with water perished it what perished but
[33:07] it wasn't completely annihilated what
[33:09] happened it changed
[33:11] the chaos was gone the disorder was gone
[33:15] the the confusion was gone the darkness
[33:18] was gone somebody says it perished it
[33:20] was in its former State when God began
[33:23] to move on it even those overflow with
[33:25] water it didn't dissolve and completely
[33:27] disappear and this is what Peter's
[33:29] saying everybody thinks all the Lord's
[33:31] going to come and everything is just
[33:32] going to Boop the Earth is going to
[33:34] vanish and we're all going to be in
[33:35] heaven or whatever however they're
[33:37] thinking about it's going to say but you
[33:38] know what you're ignorant of how God
[33:39] works that the world although it
[33:42] perished it still remained it was just
[33:44] changed
[33:46] so he says it's perished it doesn't
[33:47] cease to exist it's changed
[33:50] and brother Bram says in the future home
[33:52] he says and notice how God makes plain
[33:54] to us his Plan of Redemption
[33:58] he says all this just thrilled my soul
[33:59] when I saw it how he makes plain to us
[34:02] here now his Plan of Redemption brother
[34:06] Branham is adding this emphasis of this
[34:08] Plan of Redemption
[34:09] now compare what we see with our own
[34:12] eyes what God has done to redeem his
[34:15] world
[34:16] he's done the same plan to redeem his
[34:19] people
[34:21] as Paul as Peter refers to
[34:24] the the Earth the world in one condition
[34:28] Water World in another condition and the
[34:31] third condition as it refers to this
[34:33] later instance
[34:35] of this fire and this burning and what's
[34:37] going to come afterwards Brad Brown says
[34:39] he's done the same plan to redeem his
[34:41] people for the unchangeable god changes
[34:43] not any of his plans or anything such a
[34:46] glorious thing
[34:49] how he led us now if I could just
[34:51] interject here when Jesus says Heavener
[34:53] shall pass away
[34:55] but my word shall not pass away
[34:58] there's going my word will not change it
[35:00] only manifests Heaven and Earth will
[35:03] change but my my word will not change
[35:06] he led us to himself
[35:10] to Tabernacle in Us by three stages of
[35:12] Grace now that you have to put yourself
[35:14] in there the person just like he's led
[35:17] the world in three stages to come
[35:18] through the world
[35:20] as God will come to the world after it
[35:22] has gone through three different stages
[35:24] of purification that's exactly how he
[35:27] comes to us through the three stages of
[35:29] Grace
[35:31] so in John writes and I saw a new Heaven
[35:34] and a new Earth for the first Heaven and
[35:36] the first Earth were passed away
[35:38] it doesn't mean that this one's dead and
[35:42] another one's taking its place
[35:44] it means to pass from one state to
[35:47] another
[35:48] so you have the world that then worries
[35:50] that perished but it emerged as the
[35:52] world that then is now but the world
[35:55] that is now is going to pass away it's
[35:58] going to be completely renovated
[36:00] completely changed and it's going to
[36:03] pass from one state to another
[36:05] so this isn't replacement this is a
[36:08] transition this isn't a replacement this
[36:10] is a transformation
[36:12] this speaks of a process of regeneration
[36:15] it speaks of a process of renewal it
[36:18] speaks as brother Braham says the Plan
[36:20] of Redemption to renew it and regenerate
[36:23] back to its original purpose that God
[36:25] had in the beginning
[36:28] says that the Earth is going to be
[36:29] dissolved
[36:31] that word dissolved is used and other
[36:33] places as a loosing
[36:36] when Peter Jesus told Peter I give you
[36:38] the keys of the kingdom and whatsoever
[36:41] Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be
[36:43] loosed in heaven it's the same word as
[36:45] dissolved in second Peter
[36:48] it doesn't mean that it's going to be
[36:49] dissolved Heaven and the elements shall
[36:52] be dissolved they're going to be loosed
[36:54] the very things that are tainted now the
[36:57] very things that marit now all the the
[36:59] asphalt and all the sin and all the
[37:02] mockery everything that clings to it now
[37:04] the stain of man that's been left in the
[37:07] imprint of the earth it's going to be
[37:08] loosed from that
[37:10] that's going to be dissolved
[37:12] all the all those things that speak of
[37:15] Satan's Eden
[37:18] there's going to be releasing a setting
[37:20] free
[37:22] I'm so appreciated the word that was
[37:24] brought while we were gone appreciate
[37:26] the ministry that was here and I trust
[37:28] that I haven't had a chance to
[37:29] fellowship with you and get some
[37:30] feedback don't do it now but maybe after
[37:32] service just let me know how it went but
[37:34] the very thing that we administered on
[37:36] before we left is if God before us
[37:38] they're in Romans and then I believe
[37:40] Sunday what the true shall make you free
[37:42] the dissolving is a looseness setting
[37:46] free and making free
[37:49] so when it says the new Heaven and new
[37:51] earth is a liberated Earth
[37:53] it's a liberated heaven
[37:55] now this is you know those of you who've
[37:58] gone and listened to and studied it and
[38:00] read it know that this theme is in more
[38:02] places than just these few that I'm
[38:03] bringing up
[38:05] but brother Brian says in the future
[38:06] home he says by these passages and he's
[38:09] taken from Peter in Revelation one might
[38:11] think or be led rather to believe that
[38:13] the whole planet of this Earth will be
[38:14] destroyed I will make a new Heaven A New
[38:16] Earth
[38:16] that the heavens will be gone and the
[38:18] Earth will be gone completely
[38:20] annihilated but a close study and with
[38:22] the help of the Holy Spirit we can see
[38:25] the truth of this and that's what we're
[38:27] going into
[38:28] it is only the atmospheres around it and
[38:32] the sin that's upon the Earth that will
[38:33] be destroyed
[38:36] now we realize that the heavens means
[38:38] the atmosphere is above what does it do
[38:40] it's then these thistles and sickness
[38:42] and death and politics and sinful man
[38:44] and sinful women and evil spirits will
[38:46] all be gone away and annihilated
[38:49] it has to be done that way because we're
[38:51] going to live right here
[38:54] right here
[38:56] it's where we're going to live
[38:58] we'll prove that by the Bible right here
[39:00] is where we live
[39:03] that shifts things
[39:05] not going to heaven and then we're going
[39:07] to live there for eternally in heaven
[39:09] we're coming back to Earth
[39:12] we should start looking at Earth a
[39:13] little bit differently
[39:15] notice thistles germs all sickness and
[39:17] things will be completely taken away all
[39:18] this it's existence that's in the earth
[39:20] now man-made systems politic sins all
[39:24] kinds of evil spirits that the world is
[39:25] contaminated with and all that happens
[39:27] above us in here it's contaminated with
[39:30] evil spirits
[39:32] now when he lays out the dimensions for
[39:34] us the scientific Dimensions uh long
[39:36] before he even comes to this in August
[39:38] of 64. he's about how science these
[39:41] radio waves
[39:42] and these things just keep filling up in
[39:44] the atmospheres
[39:45] this is this needs to be Sanctified this
[39:49] needs to be purged
[39:50] it says all this exist in Heavens or
[39:52] atmospheres and the Earth which is now
[39:55] Peter referred to it the Earth which is
[39:57] now this Earth holds those things but it
[40:01] wasn't made for that purpose
[40:03] remember you're made for a purpose so
[40:06] here's this parallels he said that the
[40:08] plan of God does not change what he does
[40:10] to the individual to redeem his people
[40:11] he's doing to redeem the Earth so
[40:13] there's something we can learn about
[40:14] what God's doing for us
[40:16] to learn about what God's going to do
[40:18] for the Earth but what I'm really
[40:19] wanting you to do is though we've
[40:21] accepted what he's done for us if you
[40:23] can see what he's patterned for the
[40:25] Earth it might expand our understanding
[40:28] of what he's done for us
[40:31] the Earth holds these things but it
[40:33] wasn't made for that purpose and you
[40:34] weren't made for that purpose either
[40:37] sin cause it to be like that sin has
[40:39] caused us to be a lot of ways but you
[40:41] are made for that purpose you weren't
[40:43] made to lust you weren't made for
[40:45] compulsion you are made for despair you
[40:47] are made for despondency you aren't made
[40:49] for those things you are made for fear
[40:52] you are made for jealousy
[40:55] amen
[40:57] he says it was made by God the Creator
[41:00] and this is something really really chew
[41:03] on and all our bodies that we live in
[41:04] now were put on the earth when God
[41:06] created it
[41:08] God was laying out all his material
[41:11] he laid us out there thinking of you
[41:13] when he created you were in the earth in
[41:15] the beginning when he made it this is
[41:16] why brother Graham can make such a
[41:17] strong parallel what he does to you he's
[41:20] doing to the Earth
[41:22] because you were the dust of the earth
[41:23] it was all laid out there
[41:25] when God himself created it you were in
[41:27] his thinking
[41:28] and him the great Eternal was the
[41:30] thought which is his attribute and now
[41:33] sin caused all this to happen and God
[41:35] through this age is gathering up his
[41:38] material
[41:40] in other words he wants to use it for
[41:42] the purpose he ordained it for
[41:45] I want you to see Redemption
[41:47] see the plan of God this predestination
[41:52] brother Brandon says right here is where
[41:53] we're going to live our future home will
[41:55] be on the Earth
[41:57] the new heavens and the new Earth are a
[42:00] redeemed world
[42:01] the world that then was perished
[42:04] it is now the world that is
[42:06] but the world it is now that we live in
[42:08] is going to be completely renewed and
[42:12] changed into a new heavens and new earth
[42:15] and that is a redeemed world
[42:17] a world brought back to its original
[42:19] purpose
[42:20] Revelations 21 2 says and I John Saul
[42:23] this is after he said I saw a new Heaven
[42:25] and a new Earth
[42:26] and the old Earth the first heaven and
[42:28] first Earth were passed away
[42:30] and I see the holy city New Jerusalem
[42:33] coming down from God out of Heaven
[42:35] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[42:38] husband
[42:39] so John is looking at a New Jerusalem
[42:41] that descends Out of Heaven unto a
[42:44] completely renovated and renewed Earth
[42:47] God didn't create a new one a
[42:49] transformed one
[42:50] the world that then was perished the
[42:53] world that is now is completely changed
[42:55] not alive annihilated but things are
[42:57] melted things are dissolved elements are
[42:59] changed and now this New Jerusalem is
[43:02] coming to settle down upon the Earth
[43:05] something out of heaven in this
[43:08] invisible Dimension is now coming back
[43:10] to a new Heaven and new earth
[43:13] that's New Jerusalem in heaven the bride
[43:15] where she is united with her with her
[43:18] groom
[43:20] there's this it's in a place just as he
[43:23] says he's holding the world and he's
[43:24] reserving the World by his word and he's
[43:27] going to completely melt it and renovate
[43:29] it
[43:30] there is a New Jerusalem in heaven I go
[43:32] to prepare a place for you
[43:34] that where I am there you may be also
[43:36] and now we see this coming back down to
[43:39] earth
[43:40] and so in this we see this image of the
[43:43] world being changed while we're being
[43:45] preserved or we're kept away from all
[43:48] the annihilated because we don't need to
[43:49] be purged by fire
[43:50] the New Jerusalem doesn't need to be
[43:52] renovated that but there's a change that
[43:55] happens to this world
[43:56] and in second Peter chapter 2 verse 5.
[43:59] he says and God spared not the old world
[44:02] but save Noah the eighth person
[44:05] a preacher of righteousness bringing in
[44:07] the flood upon the world of the ungodly
[44:11] the world was judged by the flood
[44:15] completely changed now it still existed
[44:18] but it had it received its baptism of
[44:20] water there's water that over and
[44:22] Brother Band even uses those two
[44:23] different ones you have one in the very
[44:24] beginning you have this water there with
[44:26] Noah now as this water is completely
[44:28] renovating and changing the world
[44:31] Noah's preserved by the ark from the
[44:34] Judgment that's on the Earth
[44:37] and it carries him back to the Earth
[44:40] and it's different from the earth he was
[44:42] on before it's the same Earth but it's
[44:43] changed
[44:45] things have been annihilated things have
[44:46] been destroyed things have been covered
[44:48] up and buried
[44:50] and now
[44:52] just as Noah was preserved on the ark to
[44:54] come back to the Earth the New Jerusalem
[44:56] after its the world Earth is judged
[44:58] comes back down under the Earth
[45:00] the world the Heaven and Earth
[45:02] that is being renovated and changed it
[45:05] is a spoken word attribute of God
[45:08] it was part of God's original plan and
[45:10] purpose when he made the Earth we were
[45:13] the dust of the earth we are part of his
[45:15] material that was all laid out there
[45:18] and so God will preserve it
[45:21] he has made us Kings and Priests
[45:24] and we shall reign on the Earth
[45:29] the meat shall inherit the earth
[45:32] the Earth is going to be preserved he
[45:36] says compare what we see with our own
[45:38] eyes what God has done to redeem his
[45:40] world he's done the same plan to redeem
[45:42] his people
[45:43] just as you have three stages of the new
[45:46] birth
[45:47] is Holy Ghost is that fullness of the
[45:49] new birth it places it's in the body of
[45:51] Christ as Sons and Daughters of God you
[45:52] have you as you have the three stages of
[45:55] New Birth to the individual
[45:57] he's saying that there's three stages of
[45:59] the Redemption of the Earth
[46:01] that the three stages redeems the soul
[46:04] of the individual that there's three
[46:06] stages that redeems the world
[46:09] brother excuse me the scripture says in
[46:11] Romans chapter 8.
[46:12] verses 29 30 and 31 for whom he did for
[46:15] no out we're thinking about the
[46:17] individual but now I want you to think
[46:19] about the Earth
[46:20] because he says that compare what we see
[46:21] with our own eyes what God has done to
[46:24] redeem his people it's what he does to
[46:26] redeem the world for whom he did for no
[46:29] the world is a spoken thought a thought
[46:31] of God original thought of God he also
[46:34] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[46:36] image of his son that he might be the
[46:38] firstborn among many brethren
[46:40] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[46:42] he also called and whom he called them
[46:45] he also glorified and whom he justified
[46:47] them excuse me them he also justified in
[46:50] them who he justified them he also
[46:52] glorified
[46:53] what shall we say to these things if God
[46:56] before us who can be against us
[46:59] now as God has planned it this way that
[47:02] homie did for no he's predestinated
[47:06] and if he's predestined he's called you
[47:08] if he's called you he's Justified you if
[47:10] he's Justified you he will glorify you
[47:13] that means the believer does not need to
[47:15] adopt some thought process that relates
[47:18] to a Judas who can profess to be saved
[47:20] who can profess to be justified who can
[47:23] profess to be Sanctified but cannot be
[47:25] sealed with the Holy Ghost he hath
[47:27] perfected forever them that are
[47:30] Sanctified the believer is part of a
[47:32] different plan
[47:35] no matter what's happened to this world
[47:37] what we do to it it will come forth
[47:39] tried and true it will be preserved it
[47:42] will be brought back to glory and no
[47:44] matter what happens to the believer here
[47:46] on Earth he's called you he's ordained
[47:49] you he'll justify you he'll sanctify you
[47:52] he'll fill you he'll glorify you
[47:55] you cannot miss it
[48:00] but around picks us up and who's this
[48:01] Melchizedek
[48:03] I don't know if I have it here but he
[48:04] says it's only the predestinator that
[48:06] are included in Redemption
[48:07] he says we see here plainly the complete
[48:09] secret of our lives and journey and
[48:12] death and where we go after we die
[48:15] predestination is in plain view here
[48:18] now listen as we teach this closely the
[48:20] stages of the Eternal purpose he had in
[48:23] his secret has now been revealed
[48:26] there are still three stages to
[48:28] perfection
[48:30] just like he redeems the world
[48:32] same way he redeems his church
[48:35] he redeems the people in three stages
[48:37] now this is true of every member of the
[48:41] body of Christ
[48:43] he says look first is justification like
[48:45] Luther priests
[48:47] second sanctification like Wesley
[48:49] preached third baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:53] these are the three stages of the new
[48:54] birth
[48:55] man future home is saying we can see
[48:58] this these same stages and type to what
[49:00] he does to the Earth
[49:02] because when he baptizes us with the
[49:04] Holy Ghost he dwells in our soul
[49:06] and he's gonna I think we may be reading
[49:08] it here in a moment when he baptizes the
[49:10] world with fire it's because we're
[49:12] coming down to live on it
[49:13] and it has to be a fit place for us to
[49:15] live on
[49:16] but now notice he says that's right then
[49:19] comes the rapture
[49:22] so this Plan of Redemption that all
[49:24] believers participate in is the soul
[49:26] being redeemed that's why everyone's
[49:28] preaching the future home he's saying
[49:30] our souls already in this future home
[49:31] condition Eighth Day condition he says
[49:34] but then comes the rapture
[49:36] there's still another piece to this
[49:38] Redemption
[49:39] then comes the rapture
[49:45] and it says in Revelations chapter 1
[49:46] verse 3
[49:48] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[49:50] saying as we've seen the
[49:53] first or Heaven and the first Earth are
[49:55] passed away I knew heaven and a new
[49:57] Earth
[49:58] and then the New Jerusalem descending
[49:59] Out of Heaven from God
[50:01] and he says now I heard a great voice
[50:03] out of Heaven saying behold the
[50:05] Tabernacle of God is with men
[50:10] the Tabernacle of God is with men I'm
[50:13] what I've been studying on
[50:15] thinking maybe they would over it would
[50:17] be part of the Kingdom but I may just
[50:19] transition a different series on the
[50:20] temple in the Tabernacle and those
[50:22] elements because they're all the same
[50:23] they're just types to understand the
[50:25] truth
[50:26] it says the Tabernacle of God is with
[50:28] men think of that
[50:30] his habitation is dwelling where his
[50:32] presence is and he will dwell with them
[50:35] and they shall be his people and God
[50:37] himself shall be with them and be their
[50:39] God
[50:40] Berman takes this verse in future home
[50:42] the Tabernacle of God will be with men
[50:44] the former things have passed away this
[50:47] thing has passed away this means that
[50:50] heaven has come down to resident with
[50:53] man
[50:56] that now there's no longer this
[50:58] distinction
[50:59] of a God in heaven and this dichotomy is
[51:03] splitting this bridge or this Chasm that
[51:05] heaven has come down with man he says
[51:07] Heaven and Earth are embraced
[51:09] not the heavens that create the
[51:12] atmospheres that form the world that now
[51:15] is or even the new heavens and the Earth
[51:17] that will form the world that will be
[51:19] after it's purging but he's saying
[51:21] heaven where God was has embraced
[51:25] this is a this is in relation to the
[51:27] perfect Kingdom in the Eighth Day
[51:29] there's this Union of Heaven and Earth
[51:33] Heaven and Earth are going to embrace
[51:35] they're going to fuse together the
[51:37] Tabernacle of God that Moses saw in
[51:39] heaven that he patterned in the
[51:40] wilderness it's not going to be there
[51:42] anymore it's now going to be perfectly
[51:44] Unified
[51:46] so now I want you to catch this this
[51:48] image of the future home that will be
[51:50] this relationship and this this image of
[51:53] the perfect Kingdom in the Eighth Day
[51:54] think about what it presently means to
[51:57] the for the bride now what's the present
[51:59] reality now
[52:02] because brother Brown's using the type
[52:03] of us
[52:04] to describe that
[52:06] he's actually using listen what has
[52:09] already happened to you
[52:13] to describe what's going to happen to
[52:15] the Earth
[52:16] [Music]
[52:17] oh Hallelujah
[52:19] he says it this way but now it has to go
[52:21] through a baptism of Fire
[52:23] Holy Fire from God which cleanses the
[52:25] earth and the heavens around it
[52:27] then it's purchased so that the redeem
[52:29] can live on it living it in peace
[52:31] notice the baptism of fires to cleanse
[52:33] it from sin sickness disease germ
[52:35] sinners from the devil and all his group
[52:37] he has to be cast out into the Lake of
[52:41] Fire
[52:42] Holy Fire from God comes down from God
[52:44] out of Heaven Burns it up to make it
[52:46] ready for God to dwell in
[52:48] for God and the new world that is to
[52:51] come is to dwell on the Earth because
[52:53] you say God he dwells on the human heart
[52:56] really I'm gonna I'm gonna end I'm gonna
[52:58] stop a promise I'm going to stop today
[53:00] promise
[53:02] he dwells in the human heart
[53:04] but can the bride becomes one
[53:08] and they go to their home in the new
[53:10] world where is it
[53:12] here and the same Plan of Redemption is
[53:15] used to redeem both world and the
[53:18] persons that live in it
[53:20] so he's describing a future home he said
[53:23] it's going to be renovated completely
[53:24] annihilated completely changed
[53:27] so that God could come down and live in
[53:30] the Earth
[53:32] and what's going to happen in that
[53:33] Eighth Day forever no sickness no germs
[53:36] no disease no sin no world no flesh no
[53:38] Devil he's saying God burns the world up
[53:42] to make it a fit place for him to live
[53:44] in the future but what he's pointing to
[53:46] is the example now what he's done for
[53:49] you now describes what will be then for
[53:52] the Earth
[53:53] Hallelujah
[53:55] I can say if it's true then of the new
[53:57] Heaven's A New Earth then what about his
[53:59] New Creations right now if it's true
[54:02] then now then what about now
[54:07] oh praise the Lord
[54:13] I don't like the way my voice sounds
[54:15] after I breathe Mountain Air
[54:17] for a week
[54:19] I never could develop a preacher's voice
[54:20] but
[54:22] maybe they'll have some
[54:24] DNA therapy for that or something
[54:29] our future home reflects
[54:31] what the kingdom
[54:33] is on Earth right now
[54:36] the future is now
[54:38] we say oh one day one day that's going
[54:40] to be burned up
[54:42] Earth the devil sin cast the Lake of
[54:44] Fire everything's gonna be destroyed
[54:46] it's going to be perfect then
[54:48] could we agree
[54:49] scripturally could we no sin no doubt no
[54:53] fear no one belief no opposition no
[54:56] rivals
[54:57] one day one day God's going to do that
[55:00] to the Earth
[55:01] and what he's going to do to the Earth
[55:04] to create that
[55:08] he's already done for me
[55:11] what he's going to do for the Earth one
[55:14] day he's already done for me
[55:17] he's already done it
[55:20] oh my you know what it makes me want to
[55:22] do start Millennial reigning right now
[55:23] in this
[55:25] yeah there's going to be opposition but
[55:27] I want the kind of character to Reign
[55:28] this in yeah there's going to be
[55:30] unbelief yeah there's going to be those
[55:31] who aren't in the bride but I want
[55:33] character right now to be able to look
[55:35] at my thoughts and my attitudes my
[55:37] wanderings and all the all the things
[55:39] that kind of try to prick at me I want
[55:40] right now to know let the king arise
[55:43] let the kingdom arise in my heart
[55:47] let me bind him now here on Earth as we
[55:50] said
[55:51] now the world one day is going to be
[55:53] redeemed he's going to make this Earth a
[55:55] fit place to live
[55:57] that means the earth is waiting
[56:00] Paul picks up on Romans 8 chapter 19.
[56:04] read a few verses here to 22 for the
[56:07] earnest expectation of the creature
[56:09] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[56:11] of God
[56:15] I know there's a lot going on in our
[56:16] heads
[56:17] there's a lot that goes on in our bodies
[56:19] but there's Redemption for both of those
[56:21] too
[56:22] right
[56:23] God the perfect Redemption is not just
[56:25] your soul
[56:27] it's not just your body
[56:29] it's also your heart your spirit your
[56:31] minds
[56:32] I know there's a lot that goes on in our
[56:33] body a lot that goes on in our minds but
[56:35] brother Branham says our bodies came
[56:38] from this Earth
[56:39] there's this part of us that's in this
[56:41] image that God is redeeming and I even
[56:44] as the creature creation the Earth the
[56:46] world and all the creatures therein are
[56:48] groaning and longing for the
[56:50] manifestation of the sons of God could
[56:52] it be that there's a part of you
[56:54] that you think you fight with there's
[56:56] still yet a part that's crying out for
[56:59] the manifestation of the spirit of God
[57:01] that's inside of you
[57:02] there's a part of your body when it gets
[57:04] sick and all my weak body and I've got a
[57:06] tendency to this I got a tendency that
[57:07] could there be some strain within it
[57:09] that says oh one day one night in this
[57:13] body that can be riddled with cancer and
[57:15] rashes and disease and and diabetes and
[57:18] whatever else it might be there's a part
[57:19] of it saying oh one day one day that
[57:22] will not be high cholesterol one day
[57:24] they'll not be high blood sugar one day
[57:27] one day I'm gonna be changed and this
[57:29] mind that can be bowed down with so much
[57:31] fear so much doubt and confusion could
[57:34] it be that there's a part inside of it
[57:36] groaning waiting for the manifestation
[57:41] it says of the
[57:43] of the Earth for the creature
[57:46] was made subject to vanity
[57:49] not willingly
[57:51] yeah the earth the earth didn't say here
[57:53] it is in the garden of English is like
[57:55] oh man this is awesome
[57:56] isn't this good I just love it the way
[57:58] Adam walks on me like that and just
[58:00] everything's amazing and then one day
[58:02] the world's just like you know what
[58:03] let's mess this up
[58:05] let's just do something different it
[58:07] didn't have a choice
[58:09] but it says but by reason of him
[58:13] who has subjected the same
[58:16] so there's a purpose there's a plan
[58:19] in Hope
[58:21] it's been subject to vanity
[58:24] it's been subject to sin it's been
[58:27] subject to thistles and politics
[58:30] man-made systems and all kinds of evil
[58:32] spirits
[58:33] because the creature itself because it
[58:35] says in Hope
[58:36] think of this the Earth has a hope
[58:39] all of creation has a hope because the
[58:42] creature itself also shall be delivered
[58:46] from the bondage of corruption
[58:49] this Earth will be delivered it will be
[58:53] dissolved it will perish yet again but
[58:56] not to be replaced not to be annihilated
[58:58] but to be changed it notices delivered
[59:01] from bondage into
[59:03] the Glorious Liberty of the children of
[59:07] God
[59:08] what is it longing for you to establish
[59:12] the kingdom for you to manifest it back
[59:15] to its original owner back to its
[59:17] original ruler back to its original
[59:19] Dominion
[59:22] for we know that the whole creation
[59:24] groaneth and travaileth in pain together
[59:27] until now
[59:29] it's groaning it's desire and what for
[59:32] you
[59:33] for us to come
[59:35] and manifest
[59:38] deity
[59:44] one of the
[59:46] I think reading listening to things that
[59:49] are to be will be a really good spot
[59:51] remember says now you're risen with him
[59:53] and manifested attributes of God setting
[59:56] in Heavenly places
[59:58] already raised resurrected to New Life
[1:00:01] and set it in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:00:04] Jesus he says oh that means so much
[1:00:06] nowadays church that means so much to us
[1:00:10] to see ourselves positionally placed in
[1:00:12] Jesus Christ
[1:00:14] Brothers if you could come to your
[1:00:15] instruments if we're those attributes of
[1:00:18] God we cannot live by creeds
[1:00:20] we cannot live by denominationalism
[1:00:23] we must live by the word
[1:00:25] because the Bride is a part of the
[1:00:27] bridegroom like any wife is a part of
[1:00:28] her husband
[1:00:29] I know we read this statement already
[1:00:31] therefore we must be that word bride and
[1:00:34] what is that word bride the
[1:00:35] manifestation of this hour
[1:00:38] the bread not a creator of denomination
[1:00:39] but a living Oracle of God a living
[1:00:42] attribute of God displaying to the world
[1:00:45] the attributes of God in the formation
[1:00:48] of the brightness to be expressed in
[1:00:50] this hour that we're now living
[1:00:53] a living Oracle
[1:00:55] in fact in fact it says there's not a
[1:00:57] lot from the world that see this
[1:01:00] what happens in this I don't even know
[1:01:01] what kind of shape you'd call this
[1:01:03] but what happens in this Tabernacle in
[1:01:05] this Sanctuary the world not the world's
[1:01:08] not consistent even those people that
[1:01:09] stream they think that this is just a
[1:01:11] green screen and I'm in my bedroom
[1:01:13] right and we're just we're just putting
[1:01:16] In Crowd noise that was canned laughter
[1:01:17] right more of it push the button right
[1:01:20] just got a drop pad kind of they said he
[1:01:23] should cue the a man's more or something
[1:01:24] that but nobody sees what's going on
[1:01:27] here the world doesn't see it
[1:01:29] so listen as awesome as I want these
[1:01:31] services to be I want it more awesomer
[1:01:33] out there
[1:01:35] I I I hope these Services just get more
[1:01:38] Dynamic we find ourselves enjoying the
[1:01:40] presence of God more I hope that we
[1:01:42] learn better as a pastor how to
[1:01:44] structure the services and to minister
[1:01:46] the word of God I hope that we're
[1:01:47] learning these song leaders and
[1:01:48] musicians and all of us coming early
[1:01:50] doing our part to make these church
[1:01:52] services the best that they can
[1:01:54] absolutely be that it would be heaven on
[1:01:55] Earth that he would have the preeminence
[1:01:57] the signs and wonders would be
[1:01:58] manifested among us but listen I don't
[1:02:01] want the manifestation to be in church I
[1:02:04] want what takes place here to help you
[1:02:06] out there because the world has got to
[1:02:09] see a living Oracle not a structured
[1:02:11] church service not four walls not a
[1:02:14] Pulpit and a an a Nord grand piano but
[1:02:16] oh God to see a living Oracle
[1:02:21] live in Oracle living out in the world
[1:02:22] today
[1:02:24] the expression of the message of the
[1:02:26] hour
[1:02:27] Bill bam says on the sermon God of this
[1:02:28] evil age I'm just wrapping this up and
[1:02:30] now we're seated with him
[1:02:32] with power and authority
[1:02:35] over every devil
[1:02:40] he says oh if you could only believe
[1:02:41] what God has given now you have to just
[1:02:43] listen to me because I this statement's
[1:02:44] not in the slides you can only believe
[1:02:47] what God has given
[1:02:49] but if you're not seated there you don't
[1:02:51] have it
[1:02:54] it's quite a statement
[1:02:56] if you're seated there you have power
[1:02:57] and authority over every devil
[1:02:59] if you can only believe what God has
[1:03:01] given
[1:03:02] it says but if you're not seated there
[1:03:04] you don't have it
[1:03:05] and then he just gives this wonderful
[1:03:07] Grace
[1:03:08] and if you're seated there and don't
[1:03:09] believe it
[1:03:12] and then that's Grace isn't it you're
[1:03:14] seated there but you have a hard time
[1:03:16] accepting it
[1:03:17] you're seated there but you have a hard
[1:03:19] time believing it you're sitting there
[1:03:20] but you have a hard time understanding
[1:03:22] he says unafraid to move you'll never
[1:03:24] lose it use it
[1:03:27] so you could be seated there
[1:03:29] but at B church we are seated there
[1:03:33] but maybe we don't fully understand it
[1:03:34] maybe we don't fully believe it or we're
[1:03:38] afraid to move and if so he says you'll
[1:03:40] never use it
[1:03:42] I don't want to be afraid to use the
[1:03:44] authority of the word of God I don't
[1:03:46] want to be afraid to use the authority
[1:03:48] that brings the power over every devil I
[1:03:51] don't I don't want to be afraid to use
[1:03:53] that
[1:03:54] he says but if you are seated there you
[1:03:56] will use it for your ordained to do what
[1:03:59] you do
[1:04:00] I'm ordained to do what I do
[1:04:04] for Dane to do what I do what does he
[1:04:06] mean when he says that you may be seated
[1:04:09] there and you may not believe it you may
[1:04:12] be seated there and afraid to move but
[1:04:14] if you're seated there you will believe
[1:04:16] it one day you will move one day you
[1:04:20] will use it because you ordained too oh
[1:04:23] I want to use it
[1:04:26] oh Lord help us
[1:04:28] to do what we're ordained to do
[1:04:32] to be a living Oracle
[1:04:36] to satisfy the earnest expectation of
[1:04:38] the creature
[1:04:40] satisfy the groaning
[1:04:43] and travailing of creation
[1:04:47] it says in Psalms 145 verses 10
[1:04:49] 11 12 and 13 all thy Works shall praise
[1:04:52] thee O Lord
[1:04:53] are you not the works of his hands
[1:04:56] all of creation testifies
[1:04:59] he says thy Saints shall bless thee
[1:05:01] they shall speak of the glory of thy
[1:05:03] kingdom and talk of thy power
[1:05:06] to make known to the sons of men his
[1:05:09] mighty Acts
[1:05:11] and the Glorious Majesty of his kingdom
[1:05:15] thy kingdom

[1:05:42] represented in flesh yet again

[1:05:46] maybe it's abused by a lot of other
[1:05:48] people and it causes the other people to
[1:05:50] stumble but don't lose the truth that in
[1:05:53] you now is the fullness of him that
