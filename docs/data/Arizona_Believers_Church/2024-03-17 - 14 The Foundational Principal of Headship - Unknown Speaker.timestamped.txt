[0:00] this is the I think it's the 14th
[0:02] service that we've had on the subject of
[0:03] the house of the Lord and I'm hoping
[0:07] that there's some continuity among the
[0:08] different parts that we've gone through
[0:10] and the different subjects that we've
[0:11] addressed um I've just kind of been
[0:13] looking back over it we've covered a lot
[0:14] there's still a lot of things in my
[0:15] heart that I feel the Lord would like us
[0:17] to look at but I'd like to at the very
[0:20] outset today quickly go back over two
[0:23] principles one of headship uh that we've
[0:25] been looking at over the last several
[0:26] services on the role of the husband and
[0:28] the father and then just quickly revisit
[0:31] the context of the subject the house of
[0:33] the Lord in terms of a home so those are
[0:35] two things I'd like to review very
[0:37] quickly and then U I'll give you my
[0:39] title here just in a few moments and if
[0:41] you could just stay close to me um it's
[0:44] a close enough facility to where you
[0:46] everyone's within Arms Reach it seems
[0:48] but just stay with me as we go forward
[0:50] uh and focus as much as possible the
[0:52] fewer distractions and the less getting
[0:54] up and down the the I say this to the
[0:56] kids the quicker we'll get out of here
[0:59] and uh and so there's some incentive to
[1:01] stay in their seats and then my luck
[1:03] I'll preach longer than I ever have
[1:04] before and they'll like that didn't
[1:06] work but first Corinthians 11:3 says but
[1:09] I would have you know that the head of
[1:11] every man is Christ and the head of the
[1:13] woman is the man and the head of Christ
[1:16] is God and we can see that this verse
[1:18] here establishes order very very quickly
[1:21] and whether it be Christ man and the
[1:23] woman all are under headship that's
[1:26] definitely something we want to take
[1:27] from this the head of Christ is God
[1:29] Christ is the head of the man the man is
[1:30] the head of the woman everyone is under
[1:32] headship and as it says the head is uh a
[1:36] Christ of the church and of the man the
[1:40] woman those
[1:41] things and and we look at those that
[1:43] meaning of head it speaks of the Supreme
[1:46] the very word means the supreme or the
[1:48] chief uh The prominent and when you
[1:50] think of that the chief of the woman is
[1:52] the man and the chief of the man is
[1:54] Christ and maybe there's some people
[1:55] that really like that especially Chiefs
[1:57] and there's uh there's this emphasis of
[1:59] the minent one the powerful one the
[2:01] Supreme one and it it does allude to
[2:04] supremeness and chiefess and that's uh
[2:07] the god to Christ Christ to the man man
[2:09] to the woman so we see there's some
[2:10] order established there then Ephesians
[2:14] 5: 23 and 24 it says the husband is the
[2:17] head of the wife even as Christ is the
[2:20] head of the church and he is Christ is
[2:22] the savior of the body so again we see
[2:25] uh just using these two scriptures to
[2:27] look at the image of Christ as the head
[2:30] of the church and now the man as the
[2:32] head of the woman and that parallel that
[2:34] Paul is drawing and saying the as the
[2:36] Christ is a savior and is a nourisher a
[2:39] and a an an adorer of the church and one
[2:43] that serves and washes and cleanses the
[2:45] man should be that to the woman and I'm
[2:48] saying by extension to his children to
[2:50] the family and so the husband is the
[2:52] head of the wife as Christ is the head
[2:56] of the church Christ is the head of the
[2:58] church he's priest and King over his
[3:00] body he is a servant he is uh he is
[3:03] sacrificial and we see that example in
[3:05] the scripture so the man is to be a
[3:07] priest in the home he's to be the head
[3:09] of his home and those are two things
[3:11] we've covered in great detail so there's
[3:13] the man as the head as the chief as a
[3:16] supreme and the role that he has to his
[3:18] wife and to his children and it's like
[3:21] that of Christ and we catch that this is
[3:24] the this is the standard for uh headship
[3:26] as a
[3:27] man and then as uh this is kind of going
[3:30] back quite a ways earlier in the year
[3:32] the house of the Lord when we began this
[3:34] some of the subjects we looked at is how
[3:36] there's a three- room house or there's
[3:37] three different houses and we looked at
[3:39] you as a house your home as a house and
[3:42] also your church so there's ways that
[3:44] you could say well you are the house of
[3:46] God your family is the house of God or
[3:48] it's the household and this church is a
[3:50] house and we want to make all these
[3:52] houses homes those are some of the
[3:53] things that we were looking at and
[3:55] whether it be you your home your family
[3:58] or this church reflection of Christ and
[4:01] his body so Christ and his bride or that
[4:04] image of Christ is what we reflect and
[4:07] we are a type of in our families in our
[4:10] homes and as a church and we uh those
[4:13] very things about Christ were
[4:15] foreshadowed in the Tabernacle in the
[4:17] wilderness and the temple that those
[4:19] things spoke of Christ Christ being a
[4:21] three room house and Christ uh being the
[4:24] Fulfillment of all those sacrifices and
[4:26] all those images and I hope you can
[4:28] remember that that the house house of
[4:29] the Lord in the Old Testament was
[4:31] foreshadowing Jesus Christ so something
[4:34] in the way that those things were
[4:35] structured and built that spoke of
[4:37] Christ now that's my review portion how'
[4:40] I do in two minutes I don't think that's
[4:42] too bad if or maybe it was five minutes
[4:45] but I want to explore the subjects of
[4:47] Foundations and beginnings and as we
[4:49] look at um and now you have it uh there
[4:53] in the title as we've looking at the
[4:55] house of the Lord and we talk about
[4:56] foundations and Beginnings there's a lot
[4:57] of things you could begin to entertain
[4:59] in that
[5:00] but I want to draw from the image of the
[5:03] h a house and the house of the Lord and
[5:06] uh from in headship I want to look at
[5:08] those two things together and my title
[5:11] is the foundational principle of
[5:13] headship and hopefully kind of tie
[5:15] together some of these recent uh
[5:16] subjects on headship and the role of the
[5:19] man and so you could jot this down you
[5:21] could write this the foundational
[5:23] principle of headship maybe a longer
[5:25] title than normal but this is to me
[5:28] really captures what I'm trying to
[5:29] emphasize on if there's a foundational
[5:32] principle I want to look at it in terms
[5:34] of headship and I'm going to cover a lot
[5:36] of scripture so this in some of it
[5:38] review but in doing so I think you'll
[5:41] understand what I mean by this title
[5:43] what we're pointing to now if you could
[5:44] just look at our text again 1
[5:46] Corinthians chapter 3 we'll start with
[5:47] verse 9 we'll go to verse 13 I believe
[5:50] it says for we are labors together with
[5:52] God you're God's husbandry you're God's
[5:55] Building now this is about you as an
[5:57] individual the statement you are his
[5:59] Vineyard that he's going to dress he's
[6:00] going to keep he's going to see that
[6:01] it's fruitful you're also his building
[6:03] that he's building up to a finish and so
[6:06] he says according to the grace of God
[6:07] which is given unto me as a wise master
[6:09] builder I have laid the foundation Paul
[6:12] is this prophet in that first church age
[6:14] if you want to look at it that way
[6:15] Apostle he is laying the foundation and
[6:18] once the foundation is laid he says
[6:20] there's going to be those that build
[6:21] upon this foundation and so every man
[6:24] ought to take heed how he builds upon
[6:26] that Foundation we use the scripture in
[6:29] looking make your heart a home for
[6:31] Christ and make your uh make your house
[6:33] a home make this church a home for
[6:35] Christ we looked at all those different
[6:37] uh things using this scripture and even
[6:39] referred to how men are to be
[6:40] homebuilders and women are to be home
[6:42] makers and so this was a scripture that
[6:44] we've used and Paul says I've laid the
[6:46] foundation it speaks of the foundation
[6:48] of a building or a wall or a city and it
[6:52] has its roots in the beginnings of
[6:54] something I've laid the foundation or
[6:55] the first principles of
[6:57] something and that's uh that's what's
[6:59] meant I have laid the beginning I've
[7:01] laid the foundation of this for other
[7:03] foundation in verse 11 this is the
[7:05] foundation that Paul has laid for other
[7:07] Foundation can no man lay than that is
[7:09] laid which is Jesus Christ so Jesus
[7:12] Christ is the foundation that Paul laid
[7:14] I'm going to emphasize this maybe for
[7:16] the next half hour Jesus Christ is the
[7:18] foundation he is the beginning he is the
[7:21] first principle uh uh that is laid
[7:24] down and now he says for If any man
[7:27] build upon this Foundation of Christ and
[7:30] he says build gold silver precious
[7:32] stones he's saying that that work is
[7:34] going to be made manifest but then also
[7:36] if they build wood hay and stubble
[7:39] that's going to be tried it's going to
[7:40] be revealed by fire for the day shall
[7:43] declare it because it shall be revealed
[7:45] by fire and the fire shall try every
[7:47] man's work of what sort it is and so the
[7:49] gold the silver the precious stones
[7:52] those are things that will survive the
[7:54] trial but wood hay and stubble will be
[7:56] burned up and it will not remain uh once
[7:59] it's examined and once it's been tried
[8:01] by fire now I want to say this as it
[8:04] kind of struck me yesterday as I was
[8:06] looking at this uh in great detail that
[8:09] if Christ is the foundation and he's
[8:11] perfect if the structure fails it's not
[8:14] because of the the foundation it's
[8:16] because of how a man built and that's
[8:18] what Paul is saying he's saying I've
[8:20] laid the foundation and Christ is the
[8:22] perfect foundation and so if something
[8:24] is failing or something is rickety or
[8:26] something's out of kilter it's not
[8:28] because the found Foundation it's
[8:30] because the the structure was built
[8:32] incorrectly proper Foundation but as it
[8:35] begin to grow and build thereupon the
[8:38] right kind of things weren't being added
[8:40] whether it be gold silver and precious
[8:41] stones maybe too much wood hay and
[8:43] stubble a and maybe you're not following
[8:45] the blueprint so the foundation is good
[8:48] but the way that we build upon it is
[8:50] weakening the intended structure but
[8:53] Christ is the foundation in Ephesians
[8:56] chapter 2:
[8:58] 19-22 now therefore ye are no more
[9:00] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[9:02] citizens with the Saints and of the
[9:04] household of God you are his family you
[9:08] are the household of God his Dwelling
[9:10] Place you are his husbandry you are his
[9:12] building and are built upon the
[9:15] foundation so now you are built upon the
[9:18] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[9:21] Jesus Christ himself being the chief
[9:24] cornerstones this is just an image now
[9:27] he says Christ is the foundation he's
[9:29] saying the apostles and Prophets are
[9:32] part of that Foundation which brother
[9:33] brandham teaches us that uh Moses was in
[9:36] Christ and Joseph was in Christ because
[9:38] Christ comes as the Fulfillment he even
[9:40] calls him a Capstone to the to that
[9:42] Jewish time period the Jewish Church
[9:44] ages and so we see that the apostles and
[9:46] Prophets are represented in Jesus Christ
[9:48] but Christ is called the Chief
[9:51] Cornerstone there's that Chief again
[9:54] this prominent one this Chief
[9:55] Cornerstone in whom all the building fit
[9:59] framed together groweth unto a holy
[10:02] Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are
[10:05] builded together for a habitation of God
[10:07] through the spirit I hope those words
[10:09] are plain English though they're written
[10:11] in that old English style that you are
[10:14] part of the habitation of God you are
[10:16] the dwelling place of God together we
[10:18] make the entire habitation of God
[10:20] through his Spirit we all together
[10:22] become the Holy Temple of the Lord so
[10:25] Christ is the foundation we are built
[10:28] upon the foundation of Christ Christ
[10:29] Christ is now described as the Chief
[10:31] Cornerstone and we are built on that
[10:34] built means to build upon or to build up
[10:37] and it means to finish the structure of
[10:39] which the foundation has already been
[10:41] laid so as we read this there's this
[10:44] constant increase in the knowledge of
[10:46] Christ there's this constant expression
[10:48] of Christ that's taking place as you
[10:50] grow up and as you build up so the
[10:52] foundation is there and then there's
[10:54] this continuing finish of the structure
[10:57] upon which the foundation
[10:59] uh which is built upon a foundation does
[11:02] that make sense that we we're built upon
[11:04] a foundation so it is the finishing of
[11:07] the structure that is built upon the
[11:10] foundation that is already laid and
[11:12] Christ is it says the Chief Cornerstone
[11:15] of the foundation in whom all the
[11:18] building so this is speaks of a
[11:20] foundation stone or the setting Stone
[11:23] and and it's used it's used just to help
[11:26] us to understand what Christ means and
[11:27] and what this Foundation means
[11:30] and to call it the Chief Cornerstone
[11:32] it's the first stone that's set in the
[11:34] construction of a foundation and you'll
[11:37] find that in masonry and in construction
[11:39] there's a lot of ceremony that's even
[11:40] given to the
[11:42] Cornerstone and a lot of things that
[11:44] relate to it not necessarily wanting to
[11:46] get into those things because I think
[11:47] the meaning is is fairly obvious and
[11:50] what it means to be the Cornerstone and
[11:52] once you have the foundation stone or
[11:54] the setting Stone if we could even maybe
[11:57] there's a little bit of a distraction in
[11:58] me referring during the ceremony this
[12:00] had significance in masonry especially
[12:03] back then because when they would use
[12:05] this foundation stone of the setting
[12:07] Stone it became the very reference point
[12:09] for everything else all other Stones
[12:12] were set in reference to the Cornerstone
[12:16] that had to go down first you couldn't
[12:17] just start in the middle and work your
[12:19] way to the Cornerstone you started with
[12:21] the beginning the the beginning was the
[12:23] Chief Cornerstone and then everything
[12:25] else in the foundation would have to be
[12:27] set according to that foundation stone
[12:31] therefore it it determines the position
[12:33] of the entire
[12:35] structure so if you don't have a Chief
[12:37] Cornerstone you're just guessing at the
[12:39] the position of the entire structure but
[12:41] using the Chief Cornerstone it would
[12:44] determine the position of the entire
[12:47] thing and with the Chief Cornerstone all
[12:50] the building fit fitly framed together
[12:53] grow with so all the building grows so
[12:56] from the foundation it's built up to a
[12:59] full structure so once you have the
[13:01] Cornerstone you're like Oh What a
[13:03] Beautiful
[13:04] Cornerstone and you're happy with the
[13:06] Cornerstone and you and you go on and
[13:08] you don't just get the foundation say Oh
[13:10] What a Beautiful Foundation it has the
[13:12] building growth so it's from Foundation
[13:14] to full structure so when we look at the
[13:17] house of the Lord It's from the
[13:19] beginning and the foundation to the
[13:20] finishing or the Perfection Perfection
[13:23] different elements but from that very
[13:25] beginning Christ is the Chief
[13:27] Cornerstone he's set as the reference
[13:29] point for everything else you get him
[13:31] wrong everything else is wrong
[13:33] everything else is a
[13:35] guess and so this is the the the the
[13:37] beginning is the foundation and the
[13:39] finishing is the
[13:41] perfecting now to substantiate my my
[13:45] emphasis this morning is on the
[13:48] foundation and Christ being the
[13:50] foundation is and in Zechariah chap
[13:54] 10:4 just a short verse but it speaks of
[13:58] Christ it says out of him and it's
[13:59] speaking of Judah we know the Messiah
[14:01] was going to come from Judah the lion of
[14:03] the tribe of Judah there's a lot of
[14:04] prophecies that speak to this King that
[14:06] would arise from Judah out of him Judah
[14:09] cometh came forth the corner out of him
[14:12] the nail out of him the battle bow out
[14:15] of him every oppressor together now as
[14:18] it's
[14:19] spoken out of him came forth the corner
[14:21] out of him the nail it's prophecy
[14:24] there's some historical application uh
[14:27] in the days of Zachariah but this this
[14:29] is prophecy of Jesus Christ out of him
[14:32] out of Judah will come forth the
[14:34] Cornerstone it says out of him the nail
[14:37] in Isaiah 22: 22- 24 says and the key of
[14:42] the House of David will lay upon his
[14:43] shoulder so he shall open and None Shall
[14:46] shut he shall shut and None Shall open
[14:48] we know this is speaking of Christ the
[14:50] Messiah and I will fasten him as a nail
[14:53] in a sure place this is this is an image
[14:56] of a building this is the image of a
[14:59] structure he's going to be a nail in a
[15:01] sure place and he shall be for glorious
[15:03] Throne to his father's house this is
[15:05] something thick something permanent and
[15:07] they shall hang upon him all the glory
[15:11] of his father's house The Offspring and
[15:13] the issue all vessels of small quantity
[15:15] from the vessels of Cups even to all the
[15:17] vessels of flaggin and so there's a a
[15:19] lot that's expressed in this and I had a
[15:20] much lengthier reading and I just cut it
[15:22] down to these few verses to see how that
[15:25] out of Judah will come this nail he's
[15:27] going to be the strength of the house
[15:30] he's going to be the thing that holds it
[15:32] together I'll fasten him as a nail in a
[15:34] sure place he's going to be for the
[15:35] glory of the Throne of the father's
[15:37] house we're going to hang upon him all
[15:39] the glory of the father's house so that
[15:41] it will not fail it will not fall and
[15:43] that's what Christ is he's this he's the
[15:45] one that's holding it all together he is
[15:47] the he is the Cornerstone and he's also
[15:50] looked at as the nail something that's
[15:51] fastening it all together so out of
[15:54] Judah will come the corner and that's
[15:55] the Corner Stone that foundation stone
[15:58] the setting Stone
[15:59] of a foundation or the beginning of a
[16:01] structure the beginning as it says here
[16:04] of the father's house or his father's
[16:06] house of the house of the Lord as I
[16:07] would like to
[16:08] say now in Isaiah chap 28:1 16 speaking
[16:13] again of Christ therefore thus saith the
[16:16] Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a
[16:19] foundation stone a tried Stone a
[16:22] precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation
[16:25] he that believeth shall not make haste
[16:28] so there's going to be a stability to
[16:30] those that believeth upon this
[16:32] Foundation I will lay in Zion now we
[16:35] could say Zion is the brightest brother
[16:36] says always I will lay in Zion for a
[16:38] foundation stone I'm going to lay a
[16:41] foundation stone a Cornerstone and it's
[16:43] going to be a tried Stone a precious
[16:45] stone a sure foundation so there's going
[16:49] to be a foundation that Foundation or
[16:52] that beginning this is going to be a
[16:53] beginning I will lay for a beginning a
[16:56] stone which is a tried Stone a COR press
[16:58] ious Cornerstone a sure foundation and
[17:01] who is that Jesus Christ is the
[17:03] beginning Christ is the first he is the
[17:06] sure Foundation I will lay in Zion for a
[17:08] foundation stone a tried Stone Christ
[17:10] was tried he was a precious stone he is
[17:13] a sure Foundation Jesus says in Matthew
[17:16] 16:18 he's speaking about who do men say
[17:19] that I am and Peter who do you say that
[17:20] I am Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[17:22] Living God he says Flesh and Blood hath
[17:24] not revealed this to you but my Father
[17:26] which is in heaven has revealed this
[17:28] unto you and I say also unto thee that
[17:30] thou art Peter which is Stone and Upon
[17:33] This Rock I will build my church and the
[17:35] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[17:38] it this rock is the revelation of Jesus
[17:41] Christ and that is the foundation upon
[17:43] which we are built and when he says Thou
[17:45] Art Peter and he's changing his name to
[17:48] Stone because the church is built upon
[17:50] the foundation of the Apostles and
[17:52] Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief
[17:54] Cornerstone so now Christ is the
[17:57] foundation the stone and then it's Stone
[17:59] upon stone that builds up the entire
[18:02] body that builds up the church Thou Art
[18:04] Peter and Upon This Rock the revelation
[18:06] of Jesus Christ I I will build my church
[18:10] I'm not just building a foundation I'm
[18:12] building a building I'm not just tilling
[18:14] the ground I want a I want a Vineyard I
[18:17] I want a planting and this Christ is a
[18:20] foundation that is so sure he's a nail
[18:22] and a sure place he's going to be the
[18:23] glory of the Throne of his father's
[18:25] house the glory of the father's house
[18:26] everything shall hang on him it's going
[18:28] to be so sure that the Gates of Hell
[18:31] cannot Prevail against it it's a sure
[18:33] Foundation it's unassailable it's
[18:35] permanent it's solid it's not
[18:38] shifting the
[18:40] Cornerstone I lay a a tried Stone a
[18:43] precious Cornerstone that's that
[18:44] foundation stone it had to be laid first
[18:49] brother Brandon when he's touching on
[18:50] this I've just been studying the way he
[18:52] approaches this Cornerstone this
[18:54] foundational Stone and he makes
[18:56] reference to how he had to be received
[18:59] first before they could go
[19:01] on he had to be accepted first other
[19:04] words God has these great plans for
[19:06] Israel but God's never going to fulfill
[19:10] those plans unless they receive the
[19:12] foundation stone if they don't receive
[19:14] the beginning they can't have them in
[19:16] the end or they can't have the finished
[19:18] product and so Jesus Christ must first
[19:21] be revealed or laid in order to build
[19:24] the
[19:25] church or even the individual so we we
[19:28] have to have a revelation of Jesus
[19:30] Christ personally to us in order for us
[19:31] to be built into the statue of a perfect
[19:34] man we have to have the beginning of
[19:36] faith in Jesus Christ he's the
[19:38] foundation Jesus Christ must first be
[19:40] revealed in order for Christ to be built
[19:43] in
[19:44] us he is this foundation stone a tried
[19:48] Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure
[19:51] Foundation good man we're making awesome
[19:54] time you guys are going to get to
[19:55] Portillos before 2
[19:57] o'clock
[19:59] in Psalms
[20:02] 118:22 and again as I mentioned there's
[20:04] a lot of lot of scripture
[20:06] here I want to look at this in detail
[20:11] the stone which the builders refused is
[20:13] become The Headstone of the corner so
[20:16] this phrase the stone which the builders
[20:20] refused this is Jesus Christ in the
[20:23] beginning the stone is the tried Stone
[20:26] the precious Cornerstone the sure found
[20:28] found out of him come forth the corner
[20:31] this is the Chief Cornerstone as Paul
[20:33] said it this is the foundation that no
[20:35] one else can lay and which is late as
[20:38] Jesus Christ in notice it is
[20:41] refused that's interesting because
[20:43] that's what we're referring to him
[20:44] brother said he had to be accepted first
[20:46] or received first before they could go
[20:49] on but he's been
[20:50] rejected so if you reject the
[20:53] Cornerstone you can't build the
[20:56] building you got to find something else
[20:58] to build around you have to find
[20:59] something else to orient yourself to
[21:01] he's the true he's the tried he's the
[21:03] precious he's the one that comes and
[21:05] they refuse
[21:06] him now in Matthew chap 21: 42 43 and 44
[21:12] Jesus saith unto them did you ever read
[21:14] in the scriptures the stone which the
[21:16] builders rejected the same has become
[21:18] the head of the corner and then he also
[21:20] repeats verse 23 this is the Lord's
[21:22] doing and it is marvelous in our eyes
[21:25] see have you read what the psalmist
[21:27] wrote and they wouldn't have necessarily
[21:29] said Psalms 118: 22 and 23 but this
[21:32] would have been something the stone
[21:34] which the builders rejected has become
[21:36] the head of the corner this is the
[21:37] Lord's doing it's marvelous in her eyes
[21:39] and they' say okay all right we know
[21:40] what we're referring to therefore say I
[21:42] unto you the kingdom of God shall be
[21:45] taken from you and given to a nation
[21:47] bringing forth the fruits thereof in
[21:50] other words I come to my own and my own
[21:52] is receiving me not I am the stone and
[21:56] you're rejecting me you were called to
[21:59] be a kingdom of priests you were called
[22:01] to build up the name of God this was
[22:03] your calling so you're to receive me as
[22:05] the foundational Stone upon which the
[22:07] kingdom of God was going to be built
[22:09] that everything's been foreshadowing to
[22:11] this moment but now you're going You're
[22:13] rejecting me and because you're rejected
[22:15] me the kingdom is going to be taken from
[22:16] you and given to a gentile
[22:19] bride and then he says and whosoever
[22:21] shall fall on this Stone shall be broken
[22:24] but upon whomsoever it shall fall it
[22:26] will grind him to powder
[22:29] quite quite an image but if you could if
[22:32] I'm careful how I point to this if you
[22:35] could think about this whoever this
[22:38] Stone whoever falls on this stone is
[22:41] going to be
[22:42] broken and whomever this Stone Falls on
[22:46] it'll grind him to
[22:47] powder so even in that statement it
[22:50] shows something foundational but then
[22:53] something
[22:56] coming now Christ here identifies
[23:00] himself as the rejected foundation stone
[23:03] very clearly says you know Psalms 18:22
[23:05] and 23 you're rejecting me this word is
[23:08] going to go this kingdom is going to be
[23:10] given to somebody else a and this Stone
[23:13] me if you fall on you'll be broken and
[23:16] it'll grind to powder him that it falls
[23:18] upon in Acts 4: 8-12 this is where I
[23:22] think some of the reading I just want to
[23:24] read it I think it's obvious what's
[23:26] being mentioned but I want you to see
[23:27] the repetition these principles of Jesus
[23:29] Christ being the foundation stone then
[23:33] Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said
[23:34] unto them ye rulers of the people and
[23:36] Elders of Israel if we this day be
[23:38] examined of the good deed done to the
[23:40] import imp impotent Man by what means he
[23:43] is made whole be it known unto you all
[23:45] and to all of the people of Israel that
[23:48] by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[23:50] whom ye crucified whom God raised from
[23:53] the dead even by him doth this man stand
[23:56] here before you oh quite a quite a
[23:58] statement you remember Jesus Christ the
[24:00] one you crucified the one you rejected
[24:02] it's by that name one whom God raised
[24:05] from the dead that this man this
[24:07] impotent man is made whole and he says
[24:09] this very plainly this is the stone
[24:12] which was said at not of you Builders
[24:13] which is become the head of the corner
[24:16] so he's he's quoting Psalms 18:22 and
[24:20] quoting Jesus Christ who said that he
[24:22] was that stone this is the stone which
[24:25] was said at not by the by you build
[24:28] ERS you've rejected
[24:31] them he says which has become the head
[24:33] of the corner and then he says neither
[24:35] is their salvation and any other for
[24:38] there's none other name under Heaven
[24:39] given among men whereby we must be saved
[24:43] Christ is the rejected
[24:45] Cornerstone and he's foundational and it
[24:48] says in this beautiful image of him
[24:50] being the Cornerstone but it says
[24:52] there's not
[24:53] salvation in any other name under Heaven
[24:56] except that name Jesus Christ
[24:59] so if there's the banner of Heaven you
[25:00] have to have this basement this
[25:02] Foundation uh uh this footer this
[25:04] beginning of Jesus Christ and if he's
[25:07] rejected there's no
[25:09] salvation because he's the beginning
[25:11] he's that trid stone a precious
[25:12] Cornerstone a sure Foundation this is
[25:15] Jesus Christ the stone which was set at
[25:17] not by the
[25:19] Jews now Peter again visits this in his
[25:21] first epistle 1 Peter chapter 2: 5
[25:25] to10 says ye also as as Lively stones
[25:29] are built up a spiritual house again
[25:32] this is looking at the very things as
[25:34] Paul said that you are a household of
[25:35] God you are the building of God uh I've
[25:38] laid a foundation take heat how you
[25:39] build thereup but we're all part of the
[25:41] temple of God being built up so Peter's
[25:44] language is perfectly in line with
[25:46] Paul's teaching you are Lively Stone so
[25:49] you are part of God's habitation you're
[25:52] part of his building a holy priesthood
[25:55] so now not only are you the house but
[25:57] you're the priesthood that offers
[25:58] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[26:01] by Jesus Christ in the house of the Lord
[26:03] so you're all these types are being
[26:05] fulfilled in this beautiful relationship
[26:07] that we have through our Union with
[26:08] Christ where all wherefore also it is
[26:11] contained in the scriptures in the
[26:13] scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief
[26:16] Cornerstone elect precious now this is
[26:18] Isaiah 28 and he that believeth on him
[26:21] shall not be confounded so this is he
[26:24] that believeth shall not make haste he's
[26:26] not going to be ashamed he's not going
[26:27] to be confounded he's not going to be
[26:29] disappointed so he that believeth in
[26:31] this elect precious Cornerstone
[26:34] Chief Cornerstone unto you therefore
[26:37] which believe he is precious that's what
[26:40] he is right to us who believe because we
[26:43] shall not make case we will not be
[26:45] confounded unto you therefore which
[26:47] believe he's precious and I want I'm
[26:49] transitioning a little bit now I'm going
[26:50] a little bit further to those who who
[26:53] see him and he's been foundation's been
[26:55] laid and therefore you have having
[26:57] accepted him you can go on he's precious
[27:00] but then the language
[27:03] changes but unto them which be
[27:06] disobedient the stone which the Builder
[27:09] disallowed so he is there's the
[27:11] Disobedience that reject him the stone
[27:12] which the builders disallowed the same
[27:14] is made the head of the corner now
[27:16] there's there's a lot that was just said
[27:17] there but to you he's the precious
[27:19] Foundation but then this is the stone
[27:21] which the builders rejected to the
[27:23] disobedient they've rejected him he's
[27:25] not precious he's not their orientation
[27:28] he's not determining their bounds and
[27:30] their and the the the the remaining
[27:33] structure they have he he hasn't
[27:35] determined he's not a fixed point that
[27:37] they determine them judge themselves by
[27:39] they're
[27:40] disobedient now having been rejected
[27:44] verse 8 and a stone of stumbling and a
[27:46] rock of offense even to them which
[27:49] stumble at the word being disobedient
[27:51] wherein to also they were appointed so
[27:53] I'm thank God we have a different
[27:55] appointed of election to receive the
[27:57] chief Cornerstone but to the disobedient
[28:00] now he's still a stone but it's a stone
[28:03] of stumbling he's still a rock but it's
[28:05] a rock of offense and what do they
[28:07] stumble at the
[28:09] word and they're they're appointed to
[28:11] this but ye are a chosen
[28:14] generation and this phrase I hope this
[28:16] phrase just begins to mean more to you
[28:18] in its paradoxical structure a royal
[28:21] priesthood in the Old Testament there
[28:23] was such a division between the throne
[28:26] and the temp the altar uh a king and the
[28:29] priest but yet through Christ we are
[28:31] made Kings and Priests in order to be a
[28:33] royal priesthood we're not forbidden as
[28:35] royalty to enter into the most holy
[28:38] place and offer up a spiritual
[28:39] sacrifices we can present our bodies as
[28:42] a Living Sacrifice and it's acceptable
[28:45] to God you are a chosen generation a
[28:47] royal priesthood a holy nation A
[28:49] peculiar people that ye should show
[28:51] forth the Praises of him who hath called
[28:53] you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous
[28:54] Light which in time past were not a
[28:56] people but now but are now the people of
[28:59] God which had not obtained Mercy but now
[29:01] have obtained Mercy with beautiful
[29:03] prophecies about the body of Christ this
[29:05] Gentile bride it's not the house of
[29:08] Israel that has rejected Christ but it's
[29:10] the elect of God who have received him
[29:12] it's the very ones that Jesus said I
[29:14] will take the kingdom of God and give it
[29:16] to a nation that's going to bring forth
[29:19] fruits thereof going to show forth the
[29:21] Praises of him who called you out of
[29:23] Darkness into Marvelous Light we have
[29:25] obtained Mercy to us he is precious
[29:29] amen think of that to to some a stone of
[29:34] stumbling but a stepping stone to
[29:36] others a rock of offense to others a
[29:39] building block to someone else the very
[29:42] thing that causes some to stumble
[29:44] becomes the very thing that causes
[29:45] someone to be to stand firm the very
[29:48] thing that is an offense is the very
[29:49] thing that somebody else is being built
[29:51] up
[29:52] by these are some of the scriptures that
[29:54] are being referred to I realize maybe I
[29:56] out have trunc this a little bit but in
[29:59] Isaiah veres
[30:01] 8:14 he shall be for a sanctuary that's
[30:04] what he is to us but for a stone of
[30:07] stumbling and for a rock of offense to
[30:09] both the house of houses of Israel for a
[30:11] Jin and for a snare to the inhabitants
[30:13] of Jerusalem he's a sanctuary to some a
[30:17] snare to others it's a safe place to to
[30:20] some a a rock in which we hide but a
[30:22] stone of stumbling and a rock of offense
[30:24] to others this is what Peter's pointing
[30:26] back to is Isaiah 8
[30:28] and then Paul picks it up in Romans 9:33
[30:30] as it is written behold I lay in Zion a
[30:32] stumbling stone and a rock of off fence
[30:35] and whosoever believeth on him shall not
[30:37] be
[30:39] ashamed it's it's it's interesting
[30:41] language I'm going to put a stumbling
[30:43] Stone in an offensive Rock it's going to
[30:46] bring it right out into Le oysa and it's
[30:48] going to be offensive and it's going to
[30:49] stumble but whosoever believes on him is
[30:52] not going to be confounded not going to
[30:54] be disappointed doesn't have to make
[30:55] haste they can stand secure so Christ is
[30:59] offensive he is a stumbling Stone he is
[31:02] a rock of offense he has always been and
[31:06] will always will be this is what he is
[31:08] in the Cornerstone this is the very
[31:10] thing that they
[31:12] reject now this
[31:15] is I I I want to I guess I don't really
[31:18] need to hide anything but I want to be
[31:20] careful that I don't open up the door a
[31:21] door
[31:22] prematurely but if you reject a stone in
[31:25] the corner you're not going to use it's
[31:28] a a stone rejected the corner is is not
[31:31] deemed
[31:33] worthy maybe you'll find another place
[31:35] for it use it somewhere else you're
[31:37] going to give some thought to that
[31:40] Cornerstone and so it being rejected as
[31:43] a Cornerstone the phrase is just even
[31:45] more outstanding in Psalms
[31:47] 18:22 the stone which the builders
[31:49] refused who is that
[31:51] Christ the psalm says is become The
[31:54] Headstone of the corner now when we read
[31:57] that we think the the stone that's
[32:00] refused has become the Cornerstone and
[32:02] that's true they rejected him but he
[32:05] began to lay another Foundation which
[32:07] was his church wasn't going to be Israel
[32:09] it's going to be his body it's going to
[32:10] be a bride but it says is become The
[32:13] Headstone of the corner it means The
[32:16] Headstone or the
[32:20] Capstone
[32:22] now there is a lot of things that we
[32:25] could bring out in quotations from the
[32:26] message of the hour a lot of teaching I
[32:27] hope you're able to uh that you're
[32:29] listening to the word of God you've
[32:30] studied it I know you all have been well
[32:32] taught in your different assemblies and
[32:34] as God has brought us together here we
[32:35] have the benefit of the labor of
[32:37] Ministries for decades in your lives in
[32:38] your own personal studies so I realize
[32:41] we're working with good
[32:43] material but as it says the stone which
[32:46] the builders
[32:48] refused is become The Headstone of the
[32:50] corner this is
[32:52] prophecy and this verse contains two
[32:55] entirely different dispensations
[32:58] the foundation stone is
[33:01] rejected and the foundation stone has
[33:03] become the
[33:05] Capstone and I and I want you to see
[33:07] this want do this very quickly how that
[33:09] you could have within one sentence uh
[33:12] two different dispensations separated by
[33:14] hundreds of thousands of years in Isaiah
[33:16] chapter 9:6 For unto us a child is born
[33:18] unto us a son is given and the
[33:21] government shall be upon a shoulder so
[33:23] we see that in Christ he came he was a
[33:26] child he was a son but this fullness of
[33:29] the government being upon his shoulder
[33:31] this is something that happens later so
[33:33] when you have this colon and this is a
[33:36] separation it's a space between one
[33:38] fulfillment and another
[33:40] fulfillment Isaiah chapter 61:2 is he
[33:44] Jesus stood up in the temple and began
[33:45] to open up where it was written I come
[33:48] to bind up the Brokenhearted and I've
[33:50] sent to do these things says to proclaim
[33:52] the acceptable year of the Lord and he
[33:53] says he closed the book and he stopped
[33:57] comma and this is a gap and the day of
[34:00] Vengeance of our God to comfort all that
[34:03] mourn so here's uh 2,000 year comma and
[34:07] So within the same sentence you have one
[34:09] fulfillment but then and and it's true
[34:11] it's Christ it's one thing but then he
[34:14] comes later and fulfills another part so
[34:17] in Psalms
[34:18] 118 Verse 22 the foundation has been
[34:22] refused but the very one that was
[34:24] refused to the foundation will become
[34:27] the head stone to the
[34:30] Cornerstone he will become the head of
[34:32] the corner or the top
[34:35] Stone not only bonding the walls
[34:38] together but completing the
[34:40] building and so the one that they
[34:43] rejected in the beginning would never be
[34:46] considered as the finishing Stone so the
[34:49] statement is this the one that you
[34:51] refuse to even use as a Cornerstone is
[34:54] the one that's going to be the actual
[34:55] capping and finishing Stone of the
[34:58] entire thing Christ is the foundational
[35:01] Stone he is the one that sets everything
[35:03] in its bounds he's the one that
[35:05] everything is fixed in relation to he's
[35:07] the one that determines the position of
[35:09] the entire structure he is the beginning
[35:12] but he's also going to be the
[35:15] finishing he is the Chief Cornerstone
[35:17] and he is to become the
[35:20] Capstone Zachariah 4: 6 7 8 and 9 then
[35:25] he answered and spake unto me saying
[35:27] these are the the scriptures that we
[35:28] point to in this saying this is the word
[35:31] of the Lord UND deseral saying not by
[35:33] might nor by power but by my spirit
[35:35] sayith the Lord of hosts the one that's
[35:36] going to build back up the temple build
[35:38] up the walls lay the foundation again
[35:41] who art thou oh great Mountain before
[35:44] zerel Thou shalt become a plain and he
[35:47] shall bring forth The
[35:49] Headstone thereof with he shouting is
[35:52] crying Grace Grace Uno it this shows a
[35:56] Capstone coming
[35:59] headstone verse n the hands of zerubabel
[36:02] have laid the foundation of this house
[36:05] now in this foundation and whether we
[36:07] want to talk about the foundation of the
[36:09] word the foundation of Faith the
[36:10] foundation of Jesus Christ there's a
[36:13] foundation that's laid his hand shall
[36:15] also finish it and thou shalt know that
[36:18] the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto
[36:21] you he shall bring forth The Headstone
[36:24] is his hand shall also finish it those
[36:27] two things connected together to finish
[36:29] it means to complete to accomplish so
[36:32] The Headstone is the finishing it is the
[36:34] capping Stone it's what caps it off so
[36:37] Christ is the beginning Stone but Christ
[36:41] is the finishing Stone you see what's
[36:44] happening here he's the Cornerstone he's
[36:46] the foundation but he's also the head
[36:47] that comes in the end The Headstone
[36:50] Revelations 18 I am Alpha and Omega the
[36:54] beginning and the ending sayeth the Lord
[36:56] this is what he the Lord which is the
[36:59] which was which is and is to
[37:04] come the
[37:07] almighty so the foundation stone that
[37:10] was rejected if it's rejected as a
[37:12] foundation stone maybe you'll use it
[37:14] somewhere else but if it wasn't fit to
[37:17] be a Cornerstone it's not fit to be a
[37:21] Capstone and it's saying the very one
[37:23] you rejected to be a
[37:25] Cornerstone is the perfecting of it all
[37:28] he is the Capstone so Christ is the
[37:31] Chief Cornerstone he's the base the
[37:34] basis the most critical to the
[37:37] subsequent building and therefore to the
[37:39] building
[37:40] itself but he's also the Capstone the
[37:44] final piece that perfects it and holds
[37:45] it all
[37:47] together in Colossians chap 1: 17 and 18
[37:51] and he is before all things he's the
[37:54] foundation and by him all things consist
[37:57] I want to come back to that and he is
[37:59] the head of the body in the church who
[38:02] is the beginning the firstborn from the
[38:05] dead that in all things he might have
[38:07] the preeminence he is before in other
[38:10] words he's the beginning he's the
[38:11] foundation and he is the from the
[38:15] beginning notice he's from the beginning
[38:18] and he's the head he is before all
[38:20] things but by him all things consist
[38:22] that all things consist means by him all
[38:24] things are held together beh by him all
[38:27] things are united or banded together by
[38:29] him everything becomes capped and
[38:31] perfected finished complete amen words
[38:34] there must be there must come one who
[38:37] becomes that Keystone as it were there
[38:40] there must be something that comes
[38:41] that's going to hold it all together you
[38:43] have the right kind of foundation and
[38:45] Paul says be careful how you build
[38:48] because how you build that that part may
[38:50] fail so there's a foundation that comes
[38:53] there's a building that comes he says
[38:54] now kind of like the last thing that
[38:56] secures it and seals it and makes it
[38:58] sure is the
[39:03] Capstone he is the one before all things
[39:07] and he's the one that's going to have
[39:09] preeminence in all things now at this
[39:12] point at this stage what time is I don't
[39:13] have a clock there it is I got it right
[39:15] in front of me wake up your neighbor
[39:17] your spouse I know it's getting a little
[39:18] hot I don't know if it needs to be cold
[39:20] whatever it needs to be but I'm almost
[39:21] done and I'd really hate for you guys to
[39:22] miss this part you've missed the first
[39:24] part some of you but don't miss this
[39:26] part
[39:28] please do not miss this part and if this
[39:30] part doesn't make sense you'll have to
[39:32] get the
[39:34] tapes Christ is the Chief
[39:38] Cornerstone Christ is the
[39:42] Capstone this is the foundational
[39:44] principle of
[39:46] headship Jesus Christ was the first he
[39:50] is the
[39:51] foundation and the
[39:54] campstone the head is the foundation
[39:58] first so some of you when I said the
[40:00] foundational principle of headship might
[40:02] have
[40:02] thought it's not how you spell it but I
[40:06] meant it this way the foundational
[40:08] principle of headship as an adjective
[40:09] it's the main the chief the dominant the
[40:11] greatest the most
[40:13] important the principal theme or the
[40:16] principle of the flock the way the
[40:18] scripture the chief The prominent the
[40:19] principal H uh of something as an
[40:23] adjective but then as a noun it's the
[40:24] chief man the leading representative the
[40:27] one who takes the
[40:29] lead so the foundational principle of
[40:32] headship is the one who is Chief the
[40:34] greatest the most important the the
[40:36] principles that leading representative
[40:38] the one who takes the lead Christ is the
[40:41] foundational
[40:42] principle of headship the one who takes
[40:46] the lead he was the captain of our
[40:47] Salvation the one that takes the lead in
[40:49] something remember how brother Brown
[40:51] talked about the Jeffersonville fire
[40:52] department squirt a little there squirt
[40:54] a little there yeah and then the captain
[40:55] from Louisville showed up and he said
[40:57] come on boys and he led the charge
[40:59] that's what a captain does he takes the
[41:01] lead in something amen and in John 13:
[41:04] 15 to 17 after Christ had humbled
[41:07] himself and knelt before his disciples
[41:09] and washed their feet and we could see
[41:11] in Peter's reaction saying whoa you're
[41:12] the master you're the teacher we should
[41:14] be washing your feet and Peter wants to
[41:16] refuse uh this service but he says I
[41:19] have given you an example that you
[41:22] should do as I've done to you he's the
[41:24] master he's the teacher he's the head
[41:26] he's the Chief and he's kneeling
[41:29] debasing himself dering putting on a a
[41:31] towel and washing their feet as an
[41:34] example so he says verily verily i s to
[41:36] you the servant is not greater than his
[41:37] Lord neither he that is sent greater
[41:39] than he that sent him and if you know
[41:41] these things happy are you if you do
[41:44] them I'm teaching you I'm demonstrating
[41:47] to you humility I'm demonstrating to you
[41:49] service I'm demonstrating to you as the
[41:51] master how I can get beneath you and
[41:53] serve you and wash your feet and I've
[41:55] given you example that you also o should
[41:59] do so being the principal
[42:03] Foundation you understand the
[42:05] principle of the foundation he was able
[42:08] to become the head of the church you
[42:12] following this I'm I'm just just a few
[42:15] more moments here and we're going to be
[42:16] done that's why I woke you up I didn't
[42:18] want you to miss the dismissal
[42:20] song and John 10: 14 and 15 he says I am
[42:25] the Good Shepherd and know my sheep
[42:27] and am known of Mind of mine as the
[42:30] father knoweth me even so know I the
[42:33] father and I laay down my life for the
[42:37] Sheep am if you could please just focus
[42:40] with me a few more moments this is some
[42:43] of the clo this is this is my I've got
[42:45] one thing I want to use at the very end
[42:47] about a Shepherd but right now I've
[42:48] built this this thought to this point
[42:50] this foundational principle of headship
[42:54] he says I'm the Good Shepherd
[42:58] Christ could be the Good Shepherd and I
[43:00] know we've mentioned this before but I
[43:02] want to mention this context with this
[43:03] kind of foundation he could be a good
[43:05] shepherd because he was first first he
[43:07] became a
[43:09] lamb he says I I am a good shepherd and
[43:13] I laid down my life for the Sheep yes
[43:17] the Bible says that the lion of the
[43:19] tribe of Judah hath prevailed to take
[43:21] the book but the lion that conquered and
[43:24] prevailed was first the lamb that had
[43:26] been slain
[43:28] so there's there's this image of Christ
[43:30] The Lion but he's a lion after he had
[43:33] become a lamb he is Christ the Good
[43:36] Shepherd but he first lays down his life
[43:38] for his sheep so he teaches the
[43:41] foundational principle of headship he
[43:44] demonstrates himself to be the
[43:45] foundational principle of headship him
[43:47] being the principal him being the chief
[43:50] but he's also given us a
[43:53] principle this is another word you might
[43:55] have thought that I should have spelled
[43:56] at this way the foundational principle
[43:59] that's the origin the source of the
[44:00] beginning or that rule of conduct that
[44:03] basic assumption this is a fundamental
[44:05] truth upon which everything else is
[44:07] established so when we talk about
[44:09] building the house of the Lord you as an
[44:11] individual or your family or your house
[44:13] becoming a home or this church there's
[44:15] got to be a basic principle a
[44:17] fundamental truth upon which the home is
[44:20] established we must have that amen we
[44:23] have to have some as we talked about the
[44:25] family you know the wisdom of a the
[44:27] instructions the Commandment of a father
[44:29] well what is it there has to be some
[44:30] foundational element to these things
[44:33] something that serves as a Bedrock for
[44:35] shaping values in the character of the
[44:38] home so for us if I'm speaking to heads
[44:41] and I could speak to all of us before we
[44:43] can be a lion we must first be a
[44:46] lamb and to be the head you have to
[44:49] learn to be the
[44:51] floor if you're ever going to be the
[44:53] head you have to first be the
[44:55] floor to be to be the Principal to be
[44:58] the chief to be the great one to be the
[45:00] dominant one to be the head of the home
[45:03] you have to first be the
[45:05] Bedrock because that's how Christ came
[45:08] he he he didn't come as a head first he
[45:12] came as a
[45:13] foundation he came meek and lowly came
[45:16] humble he he he came in a certain way
[45:19] and because he's the foundation he could
[45:21] become the head before this is what I'm
[45:24] saying in this foundational principle of
[45:27] headship to be the head you must first
[45:28] become the foundation to be the head the
[45:31] ruler the most prent you have to first
[45:33] become the basis amen does I hope you
[45:36] see the picture in this the the the
[45:39] Cornerstone that was laid in the
[45:40] beginning becomes the Capstone but it's
[45:43] not aead and a Capstone first it's a
[45:45] beginning point it's the solidifying
[45:48] force it's the thing that orients and
[45:50] gives position the entire thing you
[45:52] can't be out of your place as a
[45:54] foundation you can't be out of your
[45:56] place as a Ro and try to impose yourself
[45:58] as a head you first have to be a
[46:03] foundation before you can ever be
[46:06] ahead
[46:08] am Revelations
[46:11] 3:12 he that
[46:14] overcometh I make a pillar in the temple
[46:17] of my
[46:17] God he begins to talk about the name of
[46:20] my God which is Jesus Christ the city of
[46:22] my God the New Jerusalem this is the
[46:23] bride she's in this she's in this
[46:25] picture and you are to be a pillar in
[46:28] the
[46:29] temple to be a pillar in the temple you
[46:33] become part of the
[46:34] foundation a pillar in the house of the
[46:36] Lord you can look at those three rooms
[46:38] those three houses this the Temple of my
[46:40] God and its
[46:42] application I to him that overcometh I
[46:45] will make a
[46:46] pillar I want I'm using this just to
[46:49] point back to what a what it means to be
[46:50] a c a Cornerstone what it means to be a
[46:52] foundation brother Bram writes this in
[46:54] chapter 8 of the church age book now
[46:57] he's not only giv crowns but he says
[47:00] that these and the bride will be made
[47:01] pillars in the temple of God but what is
[47:04] the temple of God Jesus spoke of his
[47:06] body as being the temple it was Destroy
[47:09] This Temple and I'll raise it up it was
[47:11] the temple of God but now that we are
[47:13] his body the true church is the temple
[47:15] of God by the Holy Ghost within us now
[47:18] he's going to make the Overcomer a
[47:20] pillar in the temple but what is a
[47:23] pillar a pillar is actually a part of
[47:25] the foundation for it holds up the super
[47:29] structure amen if we are to be pillars
[47:32] in the house of God if we're to be
[47:33] pillars in our in our home life as
[47:36] husbands and and fathers if we're to be
[47:38] a pillar we have to be part of the
[47:40] foundation that holds
[47:43] up that holds up the rest of the
[47:46] structure so the first Principle as a as
[47:51] a that principle with the IPL that first
[47:54] principle of headship is we must be a
[47:56] sure Foundation
[47:58] we can think of headship in a certain
[48:00] way the chief the Supreme The prominent
[48:02] one the ruler the leader and that's the
[48:04] principle one but we have to first
[48:06] become that principle of the
[48:09] foundation we have to be a support we
[48:11] have to be a strength we have to be one
[48:13] that's a
[48:14] lifter the entire structure is depending
[48:17] on
[48:18] us I guess listen I this is I I have
[48:21] some scriptures here I want to read and
[48:23] I'll say this before I get there because
[48:25] i' been holding off on this part it it
[48:27] had some context and the man of the home
[48:29] and the priest in the Home and these
[48:30] other places but there's this idea of
[48:33] headship where it kind of gets real
[48:34] topheavy right you have this great one
[48:36] at the top and he's like well I'm so
[48:39] unstable because you sheep you guys are
[48:42] worthless you guys are horrible you guys
[48:44] are awful you need to hold me up what
[48:46] are you doing you need to hold me up and
[48:48] there's this idea that the head is
[48:50] lifted up by the body and and and and if
[48:53] there's any weakness in the head it's
[48:54] your fault and if the head does this
[48:56] it's because you did this and you made
[48:58] me do it and the whole idea it becomes
[49:01] topheavy because it's all about the head
[49:04] and and we don't realize that that whole
[49:06] system is built upon the fact that
[49:09] you're not the head unless you're the
[49:11] foundation and therefore the foundation
[49:13] is ones that's lifting up the super
[49:15] structure and you've got to be a good
[49:17] foundation and this is a challenge to us
[49:19] as men if there's some weakness
[49:21] somewhere in the family maybe it's not
[49:23] because everyone else is out of their
[49:25] place maybe you're trying trying to be a
[49:27] head when you need to be a flooor maybe
[49:29] you're trying to be a Capstone when you
[49:30] need to be a foundation and the
[49:32] instability is where you're trying to
[49:34] position yourself and you've got to get
[49:36] in position first and become stable amen
[49:40] you'll never be able to lead running
[49:43] around that's right says he that Shall
[49:46] Believe will not make
[49:49] haste and you can't you can't you can't
[49:52] try to lead out in front I'm going to SC
[49:55] the blaz of TR just to go you got to
[49:57] become
[49:59] stable now in Zechariah 13:7 this will
[50:03] kind of tie into what I was just saying
[50:05] about this everything's on the head and
[50:07] well I'm not going to argue it all goes
[50:09] to Christ and it all goes to him and
[50:12] we're going to give him our best and
[50:14] we're going to grow into the him which
[50:15] is the head but where do you start you
[50:17] start in
[50:18] him he's not asking you to grow into the
[50:21] head which is Christ and not be in
[50:23] you not be beneath you building you up
[50:26] planting you making you
[50:28] secure we we know we're going to make it
[50:31] to the top because he's got
[50:32] us and he's in us working through us to
[50:35] get us to the top he's not at the top
[50:37] lording over saying come on man get up
[50:40] here he's behind you saying you got this
[50:43] I'm going to get you there you're going
[50:45] to make it to the top oh you're going to
[50:47] be perfect you're going to be complete
[50:49] ah the Lord will do this and he's
[50:51] holding you up lifting you and oh no I'm
[50:55] afraid no I got you don't don't worry
[50:57] don't worry this is going to we're going
[50:59] to make this and Zechariah 13:7 awake o
[51:04] sword against my shepherd and against
[51:06] the man that is my fellow sayith the
[51:07] Lord of hosts Smite the shepherd and the
[51:10] Sheep shall be scattered and I will turn
[51:12] my hand upon the little ones God so
[51:15] supernaturally confirmed this to
[51:17] me I that I just I can say it with
[51:19] confidence no one that's going to hit
[51:20] home in some way maybe uniquely for
[51:23] everyone else but as I close this Smite
[51:25] the head the body d
[51:29] he says Smite the shepherd the Sheep
[51:32] scatter and now we say oh that that we
[51:35] look at that and you say oh W the
[51:37] shepherd now the shepherd but notice how
[51:39] Christ uses this Matthew 26:31 then said
[51:42] Jesus said unto them all ye shall be
[51:44] offended because of me this night for it
[51:46] is written I will Smite the shepherd and
[51:50] the sheep of the flock shall be
[51:51] scattered
[51:52] abroad the shepherd is he to whose care
[51:54] and control others have committed
[51:56] themselves
[51:58] the sheep have committed themselves to
[52:00] the care of the
[52:02] shepherd and being under the care of the
[52:05] shepherd there there's this
[52:07] vulnerability but remember Christ just
[52:10] wasn't a Shepherd lording over the flock
[52:13] he was a servant to it and he said that
[52:16] he would give himself up for the Sheep
[52:20] sake not that they would be scattered
[52:24] though they would be offended and though
[52:25] they would be fearful he was going to
[52:27] lay his life down he was going to be
[52:29] smitten and being smitten they were
[52:32] going to
[52:32] scatter and as Christ is crucified and
[52:35] later on in this same chapter it gives
[52:37] us some great detail it says all this
[52:39] was done that the scriptures of the
[52:40] prophets might be fulfilled then all the
[52:42] disciples forsook him and
[52:44] fled so all the disciples fleed now I'm
[52:47] wanting to use Christ as the shepherd
[52:49] because in him we see a Good Shepherd
[52:52] he's a chief Shepherd because he was a
[52:53] lamb he's the Good Shepherd because he
[52:56] was sheep something that we should never
[52:58] lose sight of when it comes to
[52:59] leadership if you're going to be a good
[53:01] leader you should have been a good
[53:02] follower if you're ever going to be a
[53:03] head you have to first learn to be the
[53:04] feet there's a way that we have to look
[53:06] at this in a way that is a complete
[53:08] picture so Christ was their leader he
[53:12] was the head he was the shepherd but he
[53:14] first became their foundation and when
[53:16] Christ was smitten their Foundation was
[53:19] shaken their protection their support
[53:22] the one that was serving them the one
[53:23] that was leading them the one that was
[53:24] guiding them so when we say Smite the
[53:27] shepherd this isn't some kind of Mantra
[53:29] uh uh to be used to be protective of the
[53:31] head oh Smite the shepherd this is an
[53:33] attack on the shepherd oh the they're
[53:35] trying to attack the pastor trying to
[53:36] attack the Shepherd no no no no no no
[53:39] the goal is to scatter the Sheep the
[53:41] goal is to get to you to get to the body
[53:44] and so it's not a manster to be
[53:45] protective of the top it's a reminder to
[53:47] us that that that this is a reminder of
[53:50] just how important our headship is to
[53:53] those that we're leading and this is
[53:55] this is this is a mantra to the heads
[53:58] and to the heads of households and the
[53:59] heads of the family to the heads of the
[54:01] church that if the shepherd are smitten
[54:03] he's the one that's the foundation he
[54:05] should be the protector he should be the
[54:07] lifter he should be the one that's
[54:09] looking out after him and so if you
[54:10] forsake your duties as a foundation
[54:13] they're going to scatter just the
[54:15] same Jeremiah says wo and you who
[54:18] scattered the
[54:19] flock so there's a work there's a
[54:21] sacrifice to be
[54:23] done by the founding principle
[54:30] the foundational principle of headship
[54:33] is that
[54:34] principle has got to be in the
[54:37] foundation I know it's a little bit of a
[54:39] word
[54:40] play and some of you probably thought I
[54:42] got it wrong in the
[54:43] beginning but you've got to be the
[54:45] founding
[54:46] principle if you're going to be if
[54:48] there's ever going to be any headship if
[54:50] you're ever going to be at the top you
[54:51] got to start at the very bottom and say
[54:53] this is where it begins and there's work
[54:55] to be done amen a lot of work to be done
[54:58] in the beginning and God may be having
[55:01] some of us work back a little and come
[55:04] back to the foundation to the Bedrock
[55:06] let's stand
