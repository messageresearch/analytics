TRANSCRIPT
========================================
prophecies that he brought before us ephesians chapter 5 verses 21 and 22 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord two very short verses they're not often joined together usually it's just wives submit yourselves to your husbands but notice what he prefaces it with submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves and your own husbands as unto the lord amen you may be seated we're picking up on where we were on sunday and uh and speaking on a family we hadn't done this subject necessarily on wednesday nights but we want to continue and i think there's tremendous continuity as the lord's dealt with my heart even with respect to who is my neighbor and some of those themes and elements we referenced and even the direction that i felt the lord was leading me in terms of who's my neighbor i kind of see this developing and coming together but we're looking at how in the beginning god created a family and that family would be an expression of god because he began to make man in his likeness and adam brother bram said was the son of god eve was a daughter of god and they start out they are the start of that family of god in genesis chapter 1 verse 27 this is where we focused on sunday so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and we identified how that god had made the the sex or what we could call later gender and that he had a male and a female and this was only one couple and being only one couple there'd be only one family since there's only one family there'd be only one flesh and it we could possibly speculate that maybe the dna would have been the same for every single one of them such that if you took a dna test and you said well you know who stole the cookie from the cookie jar and you say number two stole the cookie from the cookie jar and he said well let's do a num let's do a gna test on number two and you find that the dna of number two is also the same dna for number six number seven number twelve and number thirty because it would have been one flesh it would have been one one family one couple and so we we looked at how that gender denoted the role of the responsibility that the male and the female had considering god's purpose for creation which comes forth in verse 28. and so the image of god and i want you to think of it that way that it's the image of god we're talking about required very specific and essential designations of male and female and that with the male and with the female there was a certain quality given to them there was characteristics that they would bear there was virtues that they would have that they would have to protect and these were very specific to the expression of god and we saw how in malachi malachi said that god had residue he had the ability he had power to make many males and many females and at least he's suggesting that god had power to make adam and to give him many wives but god was not just wanting uh to have procreation but he wanted to have an expression of himself so it was one man and one woman and this was to have a family bill abraham said he desired in love a family of his own a family of sons sons like himself and so to have a family these are those who descend from a common ancestor in order to have that continuity to have that harmony there'd be one man one woman and they would all descend from the same source they would be coming from god they'd come the way that he ordained it and planned it not many different families but one family coming forth as an expression of god so god desired one family in agreement in harmony of one flesh and one spirit and so if if that being review and that was all the amens i get on a review then i'm just expecting a really quiet night for the next hour i know you're listening i'd say that uh i say that just to be funny not that i am but just trying and then now just continuing so this is more review so here's your chance just to get right back on board with it this is more review this is a statement we used last time god one couple one flesh one dna no subspecies no other genus one man we wouldn't even have homo sapien this would just be man humankind and he says this in satan's eating therefore that was god's purpose to display his attributes in fellowship when i was in my father i knew nothing about it but when i become his son and was born of him i was an attribute a part of my father and you are a part of your father and as children of god we are part of god's attributes that were in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have fellowship one with the other as a family of god upon the earth and he says and that was god's purpose at the beginning so what was god's purpose at the beginning that sons would be an expression of him daughter would be an expression of him that they would all become a part of god and that eventually god is going to be expressed as a family so that's what god wanted at the beginning so family was god's ultimate family is what god was wanting to accomplish and i realized that's kind of a general term that encompasses a lot of different things but we see god in the beginning creating a family and it's going to be through that dynamic that god is going to be made known and going to be expressed so in genesis chapter 2 verses 22 to 23 it says and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man so it's not just male and female but now there's a different language that's being used and brought her unto the man and now adam's speaking adam which is the same word for man it's mankind but it's given as a proper noun a proper name and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh essence of my essence she shall be called woman because she was taken out of the man so god separates male and female he gives each one a very specific fleshly characteristics and they have this they have a representation in the flesh they are given each a different spirit masculine spirit feminine spirit and god divides them and separates male and female and it becomes man and woman so this is divine design this is how god orchestrated it we're not talking about what happens subsequently once mankind becomes deluded and and through uh procreation for thousands of years it begins to change and redesign humanity and so god did not make the body so that in natural in the bringing forth of of children according to the original design as god had fathomed it that it would bring forth something that would be perverted or something that would be fallen or something that would uh that would be riddled with cancer or something that would have a deformity that's not how god originally planned it but even scientists today in geneticists would show you that the reason why we have deformities in maladies and certain birth defects and certain conditions is because it's something in the dna something in the coding something in the seed as it comes forth and certain factors come to bear to create a variance from what should have been but in the beginning it was god's divine design that there would be male and female and god divided humanity so that humanity could fulfill genesis 1 28 which was the divine it was a divine division so that mankind could fulfill its commission and in doing so god created complementary differences these were differences that complemented each other they didn't create uh the budding of heads and and become uh opposites where they were angry at each other and i hate you and and these different things it was differences but they were complimentary to fulfill god's purpose for mankind and then also to express the nature of god so this is and maybe that concludes the review portion but i want to use those scriptures in genesis 2 verses 22 and 23 just to see this is god's unfolding family in genesis 1 it's male and female now it's man and woman and what you'll find later in verse 24 it's father and mother so there's an unfolding of god's family and adam was called adam or adam he's just called man but now he receives a new title after the woman comes forth because adam is now ish and we've mentioned this before but i'm using this just building these blocks together so we can come to a point in this the second part of the service and so when he's now and this is how it's phrased he sees her and this is adam speaking she shall be called woman so it's adam naming her because she was taken out of man and now he renames himself he's not adam anymore he calls himself east and so the manifestation of the woman let this let this be the part you begin to just kind of focus on and strike you the manifestation of the woman brought out another attribute of the man so now when the woman comes forth he's just he's adam he's man but now when the woman comes forth the title or the name that he's given it's not adam it's east that's used in the hebrew and so now it confers upon him a different title now i can use title and name interchangeably merely just a reference to the way that you're going to speak about somebody or describe somebody and so the title changed because man had entered into a different relationship and you can see how that proper name can change under the same circumstances but here adam who is given a name now he's referred to in a different way and he's actually called man with the capital m and the woman is called woman with the capital w and this doesn't happen until adam now is in relationship with creation differently than he was before the woman was created adam was the god on earth he was the master over creation but now he names himself differently and he gives the woman a name she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man genesis chapter 2 verse 19 it says and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air he says this immediately after saying it is not good for man to be alone in verse 18 and brought them unto adam mankind would be the what's being referenced there humanity one man adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and it begins continues to say and adam gave names to the fowl to the creatures to all the beasts upon the earth and so it says that adam is going to is going to call these animals something and whatever he calls these living creatures that will be the name and to call it means to give a name to or call by but it has a deeper meaning it means to commission or to appoint to endow if he calls them they're being commissioned they're being appointed and he says whatever he calls them that will be the name thereof to name it means to set to ordain to establish to a point to constitute or to make something to determine something or to fix something so there's something to a name listen if a name didn't matter we wouldn't stress like we do over a baby's name what's one of the number one rules when you have a name don't tell somebody else the number one rule is not because they will they will steal it but because they'll say oh i remember i had an aunt who was a nancy and boy she was awful or oh i remember i had a sister named peg and she tried to kill me when i was eight or you know there's always a horror story and you go away going oh my goodness i mean i don't ever want to name my kid after that so you keep it a secret but there's something to a name there's something significant to it and i was kind of getting pulled down that channel and i just thought well maybe maybe we'll just leave that off and the lord may quicken it at another time but adam is now not just giving a nomination where so we can know well that's a giraffe or that's a that's a kangaroo but they it appointed something it was determining something it was identifying characteristics and quality and nature and so this naming and this calling establishes something that fixes something and point something so man which was adam is placed as ish which is man so you can say man and man those are the the same words but in the hebrew you had adam but now when the woman comes forth he's placed his ish because he's placed with the woman isha he wasn't ish before there was an esha but now that there's a woman which is esha he comes forth and he changes his own name and he's like well i'm not just adam but i'm also husband he steps into a different relationship now this change of name already is not unfamiliar to us because in verse 4 of genesis chapter 2 it says these are the generations of the heavens and the earth that when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens we read in chapter one in the beginning god elohim created the heavens and the earth but now that man has come forth and now that creation is complete god takes on a different designation because god which is elohim is now lord god which is jehovah elohim and we identified this before and kind of reviewed this together as we're all solid message believers with good teaching this reflected a change in god's relationship to creation and now it expressed creation's relationship to god it identified the position of creation it's not just elohim a strong one but now it's jehovah elohim it's god becoming in relationship to his creation and since there's creation god is now lord god not just a god in in a supernatural realm and so the name or the title changed because relationship changed we could say this about god or maybe more particularly about adam but there's a new role elohim once he creates becomes lord god jehovah elohim because now there's a creation he's in a different kind of office you say well if you need a little bit more help on that god wasn't even called god until there was there was angels to worship him and then elohim became god so now that there's those that will reverence him and adore him he's not just elohim but he's an object of worship he's referred to as a god because relationship changed and you could see how this this expression of god as it unfolds and he's known in one way in one sense as elohim but now he makes himself known in a different dispensation and now he's called god even the mess the word godhead is the is godhood like fatherhood what is fatherhood it's a man in the office or the hood of a father and when a man steps in that office and under that hood he becomes a father and that's fatherhood and so if you become a robin so once in this new office it's not just elohim it's god he's an object of worship if the godhead is the office of elohim as a god and it becomes a new role a new responsibility it gives rise to certain duties and this is this is my this is kind of my thesis statement for the next several moments the name did not change the relationship the relationship changed the name so you can't just call yourself something and be some be that call it what you want but it's the relationship that defines the role right you can call yourself whatever you want to call yourself but it's the real it's the work that defines the role it's the work that defines the person that's why some peop sometimes people get caught up in just what you're going to call them and just make me a vp just make me a vp it's like fine you're the vp of office maintenance they're like yes i'm the vp of office maintenance but in the work they're the janitor right and the work they're doing and the labor and it's the work and the labor and it's the pay it's the reward that really defines what the office is don't just get hung up on a title oh there's a posting for this fancy job listing get down in the details what kind of work is being done what kind of pay is there and don't get worried about the the name on the marquee or the name on the sign or the name on the business card you want to know what the work what work is being done because it's the work that determines who the person really is so the name didn't change the relationship man adam said i'm now man i'm no longer adam and then he became husband but once his relationship changed and there was a further expression of the woman now because of a real genuine role and responsibility and change of relationship he could take on a different name so remember that it's not just calling it something but it's the operation and function of it that determines the descriptive heading or the name that's given to it biller branham says this and a man running from the presence of the lord he said if i was a young man and looking for a wife to be married and here stood a girl that meant every qualification that i thought it took to make a woman why morally she was a king queen excuse me and lovely and a fine personality a real christian everything that i could think of to make me a good wife no matter how much i say she's perfect she's exactly right she isn't mine until i accept her and the responsibility of her being my wife and it's in you could just it's what brother brahms alluding to oftentimes maybe somebody feels like oh man i got the revelation she's the one she's my wife hey no matter how much you've got the revelation she's not yours until there's a uniting that takes place no matter what it is that you feel god has shown you and how strong you feel about that conviction brother ben said hey she could be perfect she could be the perfect choice she can be everything that you want but she's not yours and you don't have claims on her or responsibility to her until you accept her and you're joined together as husband and wife and it's at that time of that union that there's a there's a transfer of headship there's a time of that union when you actually take on the responsibility is that true that's why that's why men and brothers and young brothers especially have a sacred trust to to not defile the headship that a father has over his daughter and within his family and not try to usurp that and cause it to transfer before its time because that you she's not yours and you don't have responsibility until you take her to be a wife and that's something that god you're going to do before the presence of witnesses and that's when the father gives her over symbolically maybe just in the wedding ceremony but that's when the transfer takes place and so it's this is just using this by way of an example brother man says that it's when you take her you accept her and the responsibility of her being your wife that's when she's yours and that's when the man goes from fiance to husband and so there's a change of title by virtue of the change of relationship now the the emphasis then by just raising those principles and laying them down very quickly is that family is defined by relationships and it's the uh a relationship is um it's something a state or a condition a position of being related to something else and that's just your textbook definition of what a relationship is that state or position the ship state or position or an office of being related or connected to something so you can have a relationship of two inanimate objects and how they're connected or how they relate to each other so relationships can extend beyond personal relationships but that's what we're looking at family is defined by personal relationships among different people as it says in psalm 68 verse 6 we read it sunday god setteth the solitary in families what is he saying he places someone who is alone in association to others for a purpose because someone on their own and by themselves uh they they're not family except for the relationship to something else adam was an expression of family how not because he was alone but because he was a son of god and so because of his relationship to god it's an expression of family when the woman comes forth you see an expression of family because you see man and woman but also son and daughter as an expression of family so it's when the solitary are set in families that that's what creates relationship and that's what a family is it's a it's a set of relationships among different people or between two people god set at the solitary in family so family is defined by relationships and that's where you get headings that's where you get names and titles now in the message spiritual amnesia and this principle is uh a worthy of a lot more attention because it has much breadth he says we are identified with our families in this human life by marriage so we are identified with our families by marriage and with our wives we marry and our family is identified by the union of our marriage this is very obvious to all of us because on the most basic level even our names are identifying us in natural life with family and we were talking about this the other day as a family that you can legally go and petition a court to have your name changed and you can legally change your name so that it has nothing to do with natural family but we're not looking at the exceptions to the rule but the general rule is that even by virtue of your last name you're identified with a family and brother bam is using it further than just names says we're identified with our families by marriage our family is identified by the union of our marriage well that's a very deep statement because family strains and family characteristics and family tendencies are joined together now when man and a woman unite there's a joining of family history there's a joining of family genetics there's things that come together and so the children of that union are identified by or in the union and so a person our personal identity is strongly connected to family relationships and and i don't i don't say that at all to discourage you brother branham said it himself he says you know i'm a brand i don't have a lot to brag on with being a brand and so we may not have a lot to brag about in our natural lives but we're looking at the concept that we are personally identified with our family and by our family relationships we could use the the gender-neutral term spouse parent child so you're identified they say well are you are you are you married well that's given you uh that's given you an identity of who you are yes i'm married i'm a husband and or do you have children yes i'm a father so these family relationships begin to define and clarify who a person is and isn't those those are some of the questions we ask when we want to know about somebody well are you married yes i'm married do you have children yes you have grandchildren you're learning about that person and you know more about them because of their family now that's just maybe on um on a very surface level but brother bannon makes the statement in influence of another and i don't have the statement here before you but it says family is what you are and he says and he and when he makes that statement he begins to talk about how the atmosphere in a family produces a particular product so family atmosphere family standards uh the the the discipline of mom and dad the things that mom and dad lift up it actually produces an imprint causes an imprint in the child and produces an image in the child he says family is what you are we're identified with our families our families identified by the union of our marriage so characteristics of the family influence the development of the person you become this is brother branham saying this family dynamics who you are in a family it's defined by relationships it's defined by influence and it's kind of making the person that you are would you agree now so that's the i've been through two parts this is a three-part sermon not counting the part two of the power prophecy of a powerful woman so it's three parts this is the third part now relationship if families divine by defined by relationships and we see that a man becomes a husband and he takes on a different role a different title steps into a different hood by virtue of marriage i want to kind of introduce this principle to you relationship requires responsibility so by virtue of relationship we have a duty to one another and there is there's a particular general duty of care that even society and law would impose upon somebody that we all have a general duty in relationship to one another as human beings that you would have a duty not to create a dangerous situation that could harm somebody that you would and this is a general duty we all have in our relationship to one another as human beings but then that that duty becomes greater by special relationship and so we could be walking home tonight from church and we could look over in and surprise lake and we could see you thinking man you'd walk to church that far well we're just telling the story and you see somebody drowning in surprise lake and you'd be like oh my goodness you know uh do i you know this is really awful this is horrible and if you didn't do anything to save them they'd say well there was they just had a general duty of care and absent any special relationship they shouldn't be obligated to wade into the water and try to save them now this may be a poor example even from a legal standpoint but have if the relationship changes the standard changes if somebody's kid is out there throwing rocks in the parking lot you might be able to say well that's going to hurt somebody or that's going to bust a window and you wouldn't have any liability but if someone's kid is your kid guess who may be on the hook for the medical bills or the damage to the vehicle because you have a duty by special relationship to the child to ensure that his conduct doesn't result in damages or harm to someone's property or somebody else and so relationship imposes a greater duty now that's just from a legal standpoint but think about this then even scripture or within our families by virtue of relationship it creates a duty one to another in first timothy chapter 5 verse 8 but if any provide not for his own especially for those of his own house he have denied the faith and is worse than an infidel now what is paul drawing on as he instructs timothy to come to the conclusion that a man who doesn't provide for his family is worse than an infidel how in the world does he come up with that standard why would he why would he make such bold claims if you provide not for his own especially those in his household those in his family he's denied the faith he's saying it because his relationship to his own and his relationship to his family or his household has established a duty of care to provide so it's the very relationship that the man was in that births the responsibility so paul is drawing from and it goes unstated that a man who has responsibility has a responsibility over his own especially over his family to provide for them and if he doesn't he's breached to duty and in breaching the duty he's saying he's denied the faith and this duty is so significant he says he's worse than an infidel he would be better off if he didn't even believe so paul is drawing on the fact that this man by virtue of relationship had a responsibility to provide in genesis chapter 2 verse 24 it says therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh this entire concept was not fattenable just by the image of man being on earth alone and then god creates the help means say oh well now man has a help meet they can rule and reign together but adam's prophetic utterance goes deeper it's not just a man and a woman but now he introduces the concept that a man's going to leave father and a man is going to leave mother because as long as that man is under father and mother he has a scriptural duty to honor them and is a scriptural duty to them but now it says he's going to leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh what happens responsibility changes as he enters into a new office it's important for a young man and even a young sister to recognize this when a man and a woman get married they begin to form their own family identity and it becomes a distinct identity separate from the one that the man had under his father and mother in one different than the girl had under her father and mother why because now that you become husband and wife the responsibility is to each other and your family and you no longer remain responsible in the same way you were when you were a child in the home it's not that you disrespect them anymore or you don't respect them anymore and that you show them disrespect but now your obligation changes because your relationship has changed are you able to follow just kind of these very simple things we're wanting to express that this is what's said to us in genesis 2 24 that a man who is at one time under his father and mother is has to leave and by obligation cleave and be responsible to his wife and cannot shirk his responsibilities he has to his wife in the name of being responsible to his father and mother that there has to come a time when that division is made when that separation is made and someone gives themselves over to that family and to that wife and it may not just be father and mother it could be brother it could be bros right your buddies could be hobbies it could be recreation a man has to separate from those things of youth and and cleveland to his wife and now there's a different focus and this is what paul touches on in first corinthians chapter 7 verse 33 but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife and all the brothers said amen and now we feel like an excuse we have an excuse to concentrate on the things that are worldly but paul in this says they that have wives be as though you had none and you're thinking great this means i get to act like i'm single again no see we're just kind of boxing you in here he said hey the single person cares about the things of god how he may please the lord what because not being married they don't have the obligation to the wife so the single person the solitary is is focusing on christ and does the things that he may please the lord but he identifies how this shift of burden that when a man gets married and it even says it about the woman when she gets married now she cares about the things of the world how she may please her husband and the man cares about the things of the world how he may please his wife and paul recognizes this is a very strong influence and dynamic within marriages so he says look because time is short change your focus don't put family first put god first family second you third and he orders it differently then he says look we ought to not get so sidetracked that when a man gets married and he cares for the things of the world that he may please his wife at the sake of pleasing god no that's that's not what we must do but i'm using this scripture to point out that this is an obligation that a man takes on when he gets married it's an obligation a woman takes on when she gets married and these are the things that the scriptures are pointing out that relationship gives rise gives rise to responsibility again in the message of man running from the presence of the lord brother brown says we got so many things that we have to do so much responsibility that we have to face everybody has got to face a certain responsibility when you come to choose your wife to get married or choose your husband you've got to take a responsibility maybe you build a home it's a nice pretty home and then remember as a married woman you got to think about the responsibility of raising children and you got to think of them pretty slick walls are going to have little dirty hand prints all over them that's why you want to use the right kind of gloss or finish right wrong finish you can't wipe those dirty slimy little dirty hand prints off of them but he's saying this is the reality this is the reality of marriage this is the reality of raising children there's responsibility then you've got a responsibility of educating your children then you've got the responsibility of clothing and feeding everything is a responsibility now i know what some of you thinking everything is a chore but he's calling it a responsibility and it's so easy when the responsibility faces us to shirk from them and we find out that marriage is a responsibility in all manners brother brahm identifying that in natural life by virtue of the relationship a parent has to a child you have a responsibility to educate and to clothe and defeat you have responsibility to one another marriage is a responsibility what is its relationship because i'm in relationship to you there's mutual responsibilities that we have to one another so when you say a family is defined by relationships those relationships come with requirements responsibilities duties and things that we owe one another and that's what further defines what kind of family it is when brother branham identifies an awful family talks about wife going one way husband going another that's two people shirking their responsibilities and it creates an awful family but two people fulfilling their responsibility says creates the portrait of god a true family he says and that it's because of whether or not one is fulfilling their scriptural responsibility to one another so family is not just merely slapping a name on it and calling it a family not just merely entering into getting married well i guess i'm married i'm a husband now but it must carry with it it carries with it responsibility now in our in the text that we use in matthew chapter 5 verses 21 and 22 excuse me ephesians chapter 5 rather verses 21 to 22. he says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god this is not spoken solely to the woman this is spoken to man and woman this is this is not paul says it to the woman and says oh well i better be very particular here and make her realize i'm talking to her she's out he's telling both man and woman boy girl all of us he said we submit ourselves one to another and more particularly as he begins to get into marital relationships he's telling the man to submit to the woman the woman to the man but then he says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord so this image now that we create and a lot of us just immediately carnally begin to create this image of an authority figure and a woman in submission to the authority figure and that's kind of the idea we get the strong burly head and the woman under submission and we get the image of a gigantic thumb right and somebody under somebody's thumb and that submission well that may be by name but not in the reality that god is intending that may be submission in some relationships that may be submission that some want it to be and they turn marriage into an ultimate fighting bout trying to get the other to submit you're gonna tap out honey and that's kind of how how the relationship's working is the war of attrition are you going to give up i can argue all night long are you going to give up but that's not the submission that god that the prophet paul here is lifting up it's not submission that god is talking about submission carries with it the idea of cooperation submission here carries with the idea of agreement and the very words submit that you submitting yourselves one to another and the fact that it says one to another and then wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands it speaks of assuming a responsibility one to another so submission is not just cowering down and getting underneath something but submission is res assuming a responsibility to someone so when a wife submits herself to her husband she assumes a responsibility for and to her husband she has certain things that she must do for her husband she has a certain responsibility to her husband but it doesn't just work that one way the husband himself likewise even if it was just by virtue of the fact that his wife submitted to him he now has a mutual obligation to her because she has submitted herself to him there must be agreement there must be cooperation and then now he is responsible to her submission doesn't create one-way responsibility where the the the the the one that's submissive is now being dominated and they owe all the all the respect and all the care and everything and all the all the work goes one way to the one who's the head no it works both ways by virtue of the fact that there's one who's submitting and voluntarily yielding themselves to the other it creates a responsibility on the submitted part but also the one who's being submitted to now has a responsibility to the one who's yielded because now they have a duty to them by virtue of relationship a special relationship and they're even more responsible they would they're more responsible than they would have been without the submission right because now there's a greater care that's required the greek word submitting the who potasso is to place in a certain order or to arrange to mutually appoint or to agree upon so the submission is not one way accountability the submission isn't one way uh um uh dependency where there's where there's codependency and i'm absolutely convinced of this and you could just take this principle and identify it time and time again in all sorts of relationships whether it be in churches or or marriages or in business where there's a codependency there's abuse manipulation and control and fear and and one party being dissatisfied with the outcome but where there's mutual dependency there's cooperation there's a core there's harmony there's compromise in a good sense to achieve achieve a right result it's not it's my way or the highway if you don't like it there's the door there's there's a way of working together because the one party realizes well i'm dependent upon you and they say well i'm also dependent upon you so we're depending upon each other and that's exactly what paul is trying to lift up when it says submitting yourselves one to another he has not created a hierarchy where one is greater and better and stronger and more blessed than the other but he's arranging parts in relationship to each other and he says submit yourselves one to another that means husband must be submitting himself to his wife not that she would be the head to rule over him but in responsibility for her and the wife submitting herself to the husband so then you would ask if when paul sets it up that way and i'm i'm just using this this is an example of what relationships mean and how it gives rise to duty because otherwise if it's not creating that mutual dependency and it's not a two-way street wherein each party is complementing one another there's cooperation and agreement and it's an arrangement to place in a certain order so there's an order but there's a relationship one to another how do we submit to one another and how do we do as the scripture says submitting yourselves one to another how do we submit to each other if submission only means to be under somebody else ponder that how do we submit to each other if submitting means the other is under the other and i know maybe i'm using a language that begins to turn our whole concept upside down of what it means to be under headship but if if submitting only means the woman is under the man but the man has to submit also but that doesn't mean he has to get under the woman it suggests cooperation agreement harmony to their working together to be a church family and for us to operate as a church it's not a matter of being under the pastor and i know it's a language we often use and it's something you can study out and study very deeply in the message and even in the scripture and find that the phrase under someone's ministry or under this pastor can you sit under him and i'm under this ministry it's a phrase that we use and in our minds we're using a language that suggests there's some sort of hierarchy and that you have the pastor and everyone's underneath him as an uh you know look we're just kind of stuck underneath the man but really it's a language we use and the phrasing if you go back to scripture you go back to the message it's really to say we come to church to sit under someone's teaching or preaching that's why you're here you're sitting there while i'm standing listening to what i'm preaching so regardless of who's sitting here or who's standing here preaching you're sitting there under what they're preaching and you're listening to it and if you choose to come to a church and you come to church you sit under preaching and you yield to the order of the local church service those in authority the authorities of the local church so that you can we can have a church that governs and functions we don't all show up and someone say you know what i want to lead songs tonight and so everyone's up here fighting i got here first let me lead songs i want to lead songs get off the piano i don't want to have a piano tonight and everyone just kind of vises for who's playing who's leading songs what songs are sung but you come and you submit to the order of the local church and you sit under the preaching of the word but when you leave you retain your individual authority as a husband you retain your autonomy as a family when you leave the church service you don't leave thinking well i guess i'm under brother aaron i wonder what brother aaron would think about where we're going tonight for dinner i don't care if you don't go doritos am i on a roll now have i mentioned it now for four straight services you know it's getting bad when last night i was invited to go to dinner at ritos and i went with the family and it was good but think about that you come and you sit under teacher or a pastor or preacher and with with respect to your relationship in a local church if he's the highest order it creates arrangement and order and there's certain answerings too and certain decisions that are made and that relates to the local church but you retain your own headship of your family if you're if you're if you're going to church and we use the phrase you're sitting under someone's ministry you still remain personal responsibility for responsible for your wife and for your children you you retain your autonomy and your individuality as a son and daughter of god and the decisions you make outside of the context of a church service to where there's never this card that a preacher can pull and say well you're not under my ministry clearly you're not under my ministry because of what well i mean if you tried to bully the guy out of the pulpit during service say hey tonight's my night you know i want to preach you say hey you're clearly not submitting to the rules of order in this church and and then we've asked someone to speak and you're wanting to take their place and you're interrupting the service that's the time you say you're clearly not under uh the authority of the local church to listen to what the local church is doing but there's certain things and certain functions that you retain as a husband that you retain as an individual family unit and as a man and a person of god certain responsibilities that a church has to keep the local church clean and there's certain things that function within the local church that go beyond the scope of what i'm what we're dealing with tonight but i believe that sometimes submission has been perverted into something that's not scriptural not even not even close to being christ-like and it creates the wrong picture of leadership it creates the wrong picture of relationships and it's it it creates weakness or a vulnerability that the devil exploits and i believe god's wanting to wash his bride of the wrong concept of headship and a washer of the wrong concepts of leadership and i believe with all my heart this message calls out the bully with the three-pointed stick and says you've you stopped beating her you stop mistreating her and so submitting yourselves one to another so in a family then god has arranged us together with responsibility among the members and these are scriptural obligations that we owe one another and i think you could even look at it in the terms of maybe legally like a contract and that's what marriage is it's a covenant that's what parents have to their children they have a covenant they have a contract it's an agreement it's god's divine order order not just in the sense of arranging things but order in the sense of a command or something that should be obeyed god places us in a family and then god arranges a family a particular way and in that arrangement there's responsibilities among the members some members have responsibilities that others don't could you imagine if i went home tonight and i said well elliot did you pay the rent and he'd be like pay the rent how many baseball cards is that but he doesn't have that responsibility he shouldn't have that responsibility at least not yet and so the virtue of the office and and the relationship it dictates what responsibilities you have and their scriptural roles and scriptural responsibilities that were owed under a contract to one another and it's so even within the local church within the the unity of the local body and i want to end with this thought as the closing part of part three of par three parts it's through those relationships and the fulfillment of our duties one to another that the attributes of god are manifested that that's how we begin to understand god and that's why we as humans we use the relationship of father the son and husband to wife to begin to understand god and his love for us because it's in those relationships that god was the original parent that god is a husband and there's a certain relationship he wants to have with his creation and we be we're the part that unfolded first and so it's actually in the office of husband in the office of wife in the office of father in the office of mother in the office of child that if we meet our scriptural responsibilities god is actually being expressed and we paint a picture of the divine god's attributes are manifested through our relationships and it's a wonderful opportunity and it actually gives context i say rather i'd like to say that it gives context to our character when you see one acting a certain way and you see them do certain things you might think well that doesn't seem that really seems odd why would they do that and then you realize they have a responsibility over something and you realize that's why they made that decision why didn't he just stick it out why didn't he just do that so why did he do that oh i didn't realize he was responsible i didn't realize he was facing that decision i didn't know those were the circumstances so it our actions and even our what we lift up and what we promote it gives context to our character it gives context to our behavior you say somebody running out and doing something you might think oh that's that's harmless that's great did they enjoy it i said yeah they had a blast but they left their wife and children at home for a month while they did it like oh wow why'd they do that for it gives a different context to to callings and uh to conduct and behavior and so i want you to think of that the contract the covenant as we read this last statement brother brown in the message one it says now the first man and the first woman in the garden of eden were in perfect harmony with god so much that god could come down at any time he desired and talked lip to ear with adam and eve now that is perfect oneness god in his creation god speaking lip to ear with adam and eve don't you want to kind of create the kind of atmosphere in your life that god's welcome in his presence says welcome in he says and they were so perfect in harmony with god till they were one with god so he talked about man and woman perfectly together in harmony with god it creates an environment conducive to the presence of god god and his family were one any man in his family a correct good noble obedient family is one with another any family so the unity of the family some family relationships a good correct noble obedient family is one if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right that family's broken somewhere that's disharmony disunity there's a broken the agreement now you can have one member submitting in that that uh unnatural sense and they're clearly under submission but if there's not cooperation if there's not harmony if they're not on the same page but it's like that makes an awful family so he said there's something they're broke somewhere they should all be one father with mother mother with father children with parent parent with child all in agreement integrity we're operating according to the same covenant we're meeting our responsibilities under the covenant we're all in agreement we're all in harmony there's no breach of contract there's no anticipatory breach there's no one's threatening to sue one another you keep doing that and i'm going to sue you no we're all in agreement we're all in harmony it says when you see that you'll see one lovely picture it says that's god's purpose what's his purpose that our families would be that way to paint a lovely picture why was it one man and one woman in the beginning that he might have a godly seed and that's god's purpose and his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family his earthly family adam and eve the statement we've been reading from in the masterpiece but in agreement with love one to another that's a family so families defined by relationships these relationships we have one to another it's the relationship that gives rise to the name husband it's a relationship that gives rise to the name mother it's a relationship that gives rise to the the name child and then you can find yourself by those names in the word right you mean identify yourself write in the bible by what not because i'm looking for aaron david but i'm looking for what does god require of a man what does god require of a woman brother aaron was testifying he's reading the book of proverbs he's like my goodness this is so on point this is those are my words this is directly where i'm living right now why because it speaks to a young man because to tell them what to look for what to watch for and the bible is instructive to men it's instructed to young women it's instructed to the aged women it's instructed to to husbands and wives and we can find this bible in this message by virtue of the names it addresses the roles and responsibilities it means something to me every day of my life because the relationships i have in agreement he says fulfilling in other words fulfilling our responsibilities as dictated by scripture according to our position in the family and so we'll invite the musicians to come i want to end with this statement now i'll say that i agree with it but before you get all excited and start flipping over chairs and run the aisles i want to preface that i have a follow-up to it but we've heard this statement before character is what you are when you are by yourself and there's there's a tremendous truth to that identifying how that you can act one way around people and you could do something or you could kind of hold your tongue or keep from doing certain things when you're around others but when you're all by yourself what is it you conspire to do what is it you're thinking about what is it you're doing and it tells us it speaks to the principle that when you're all alone and you're at liberty to do whatever you want that that's going to really reveal someone's character right that's kind of the idea to it so i'm not taking exception to that statement but let me just say this if character is what you are when you're by yourself there's nothing like relationships to bring that real character out nothing like relationships to finally figure out whoa i didn't know you had that in you and what brings it out relationships conflict in relationships responsibilities that one has in a relationship you think immediately you begin to think negatively like wow i didn't know you could get mad like that i didn't know you could be jealous like that i didn't know you could punch like that and it's all in the context of some kind of rivalry or some kind of uh a fight between two people in relationship but sometimes you're impressed like wow where'd that come from because someone steps into a position or an office and they start acting out in ways you never realized before man i didn't realize they had that gift i didn't realize they had that had that um ability like you take brother michael for instance volunteers to lead songs because he's either had enough with me and brother tom or he feels a burden and he's like hey maybe there's a way that i can help and i see someone stepping into an office and begin to lead songs like wow this this had to always been there a sensitivity to the spirit a willingness to to lead the worship and humility in the way that it's done that's a gift operating and what created that a relationship to the congregation responsibility to god to do something that was pleasing to him and bring the right kind of atmosphere so it's not always negative then i get in a relationship i'm going to know i'm jealous and i'm impatient and i raise my voice no it'll bring out the best in you too and that's what god desires to do by virtue of relationships not place us in relationship to one another where we repeatedly fail i made a mistake in that relationship i made a mistake in that relationship and it brought out the worst of me here and the worst of me there listen you're still here today doing this breathing why because god's not finished with you yet because god's putting you in relationship so that you can he can bring out the gold that's in you and you look back and you're like man i failed here and i failed there and i didn't do this right and i didn't do that right and i could fret over me as a father and say man through the first 12 years of being a father i didn't do this right i didn't do that right but you know what i'm still a daddy i'm still a papa to jack and i'm still i'm still one that has an opportunity by virtue of that relationship not to keep making the same mistakes to bring out the real father in me to bring up the patience and the grace that a father ought to have i still have a marriage by the grace of god and that it gives me the opportunity to not remain obstinate to not remain harsh to not make the same mistakes that can be made in a marriage the opportunity is still there to bring out the real husband in me well and what gives me the opportunity relationship he said well brother and i don't have that i don't have that but you're still placed in family you're still in the house of god you're still placing a relationship as a brother as a friend and even as a dad or a grandparent all for what the opportunity that the real you could come out and it being the real you it's christ that's expressed and so we could perhaps cower a little bit when we think there's nothing like a relationship to bring out the real you there's nothing like a relationship to bring out the real you and i thank god for relationships i thank god for the relationship he gives us within church because it brings things out of us not always the bad but ultimately the good i'm glad he's placed us within families in this natural life to do what to bring out the best in us not to constantly highlight our worst uh instincts and and our worst uh attributes but he awakens us to him why do i keep doing that why because there's a better you on the inside and he's going to bring it out of you and i think that's the promise that we can yield to thank god for relationships i'm glad i'm not solitary i'm glad he's placed me in a family a church family where i'm responsible to you and i is the one who's standing up here now i voluntarily and willingly make myself accountable to you i'm accountable to you i do that and i thank god for that because what it'll bring out of me in the end is a christ-like characteristic why because you'll hold me accountable you'll say brother aaron that wasn't really christ like oh you're right that wasn't it's saying so if you don't agree with it right you hold yourself accountable so i thank god for relationships thank god he's placed us in a church family i thank god that he's given his family his husbands and wives his uncles and aunts his grandparents that we can express the attributes of christ i trust this extends of grace to you tonight and it is a strength to you let's stand to our feet [Music] let's bow our heads [Music] let's express our love to him tonight say lord it's the relationship i have with you as a daughter that i come to you and it's the relationship i have with you tonight as a son that i approach your throne and i'm mindful lord that you said in your word that if a natural father would give his son the things the necessary things that he asked for then how much more does our heavenly father give us the spiritual things that we need so i have the boldness tonight to inquire of god said lord what is it that you desire to see in me lord what is it that i must yield to more well and there then also lord help me help me in my in my calling as male female man woman husband wife father mother child son daughter grandmother grandfather you name it we all can come under this obligation together let's just express our love to him our gracious heavenly father tonight as we close this service and as we have been blessed in your presence lord we start with the very beginning yes lord i realize that i ventured as a preacher into areas of politics and statements that your prophet made in relationship to a powerful woman and vice presidents and presidents even the very image of a woman wearing royal purple like colors [Music] lord we see a striking image reflected today as vice president harris was inaugurated sworn into office and lord we could only go back to what we see already in your word that your prophet identified according to that prophecy that there would be a rise of a union in ecumenical realms realms lord that there'd be a union of in denominational realms and there'd be a union of the mother and her daughters and this would be a spiritual union and it'd be a force that would strike out against the word wrote in the church age book that once we see these this catholic president no doubt there be another one he says there's nothing left but a shaking lord and lord we realize that once more this world was shook when those seals were being opened fathers we sit under the anointing of the word of god and the open of the word of god in this hour it's there that we place our focus it's there that we place our trust and father if you could give liberty and our spirits to catch a revelation of a modern event by what your prophet has prophesied father we yield to we would accept it in your name but father we want to be very careful if we do not have the liberty to say this day this is fulfilled that we would just wait for you to bring that kind of unction and that kind of clarity but no doubt father we are excited we are thrilled to see symbols and images that perhaps our prophet saul come up before the people all around the world today and we have a special connection to a voice and to a message that spoke things beforehand and placed them in modern events beforehand and showed us what satan was doing beforehand and now to for what else would i ask men to do tonight except to go home and love their wives as christ loves the church what else could i ask children to do today except to go home and be obedient to their parents what else could we ask of the sisters except to reverence their husbands what could we ask of one another except to pay our tithes and give our offerings and baptize in the name of jesus christ and and to take communion and feet washing and do the ordinances of the church lord what else could we do except what the word has asked us to do and how else are you going to be expressed unless we have lives lived by the word [Music] and lord i can't fulfill my wife's part i have to fulfill my part and lord i know if i do my part i can make her part easier and what i pray that that be the unction and the inspiration that comes within our hearts today is may each one of us from myself uh to brother micah brother loyal and brother john lord in each one and that would be here from the this front of the room or the mission brother aaron all the way to the back lord may we realize that we consecrate ourselves as individuals to you tonight to do our part that it may work to the efficient operation of our families to the body of christ not taking ourselves even out of the context that we're operating on a global scale tonight as one ransom body of christ oh lord let us do our part and i don't want it to be in some kind of fantastic some kind of pie in the sky great things with headlights and the whole world notices the lord in the quietness of my home and my relationship to my family may i fulfill my responsibility and endure
