[0:00] Acts chapter 16 veres 1
[0:02] to5 and uh pretty remarkable story as I
[0:06] was studying it this week um and I think
[0:08] it'll be a blessing to you just these
[0:09] few
[0:11] verses Acts chapter 16 verse1 then came
[0:15] he to Derby and lra and behold a certain
[0:18] disciple was there and he's speaking of
[0:19] Paul and this is actually Luke writing
[0:22] so he has a very unique way of uh
[0:25] expressing certain details and behold a
[0:28] certain disciple was there named Timothy
[0:30] the son of a certain woman which was a
[0:32] Jewish and believed but his father was a
[0:35] Greek which was well reported of the of
[0:37] by the Brethren there that were at lra
[0:41] and Iconium him would Paul have to go
[0:43] forth with him and took and circumcised
[0:45] him because of the Jews which were in
[0:47] those quarters for they knew all that
[0:49] his father was a Greek and as they went
[0:51] through the cities they delivered them
[0:53] to the decrees for Te keep that were
[0:55] ordained of the Apostles and Elders
[0:57] which were at Jerusalem and so were the
[0:59] churches established l in the faith and
[1:01] increased in number daily let's bow our
[1:04] heads and pray our gracious Heavenly
[1:06] Father Lord we are standing in your
[1:08] divine presence today there's those that
[1:11] would look at us and say I think you're
[1:13] mistaken you're standing in a hotel
[1:15] conference room but Lord we believe that
[1:17] we're in your presence we believe that
[1:19] we as your sons and daughters come
[1:21] boldly before the throne of grace though
[1:23] we do not enter into a physical hall
[1:26] pass down Regal corridors or stand
[1:28] within a palatial throne room but yet we
[1:31] believe that we stand before the
[1:32] almighty and that we come before you
[1:34] with a heart uh full of faith and
[1:36] Assurance knowing that you're rewarder
[1:39] and that father having diligently sought
[1:41] you we could ask and not ask a Miss Lord
[1:43] I pray that you bless the many that have
[1:45] gathered this evening you know the
[1:47] unique circumstances that they've uh
[1:49] departed from this evening to be here
[1:51] you know the circumstances that await
[1:53] them you know the anxieties that they
[1:55] hold the trials that they endure and I
[1:57] pray that you would bless them and
[1:59] strengthen them and encourage them Lord
[2:01] there's no desire of condemnation or
[2:03] judgment upon them Lord we just desire
[2:05] that your will would be done that you
[2:07] would lift them up give them those
[2:09] things that they have need of and may we
[2:10] be willing to acknowledge that it's in
[2:12] your word Lord there's provision so
[2:15] father we ask that you bless the word
[2:17] which we have read the time that we
[2:18] spent together around your word we
[2:20] commit all things to you in the name of
[2:21] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen may
[2:24] be
[2:26] seated I'm continuing on the subject
[2:29] that we began last week uh true family
[2:33] no filter and uh I actually thought that
[2:36] maybe I'd opened up a little bit of a
[2:38] can of worms by using a hashtag in a
[2:40] mixed audience and uh maybe it would be
[2:43] more appropriate for a youth meeting but
[2:45] we're using that hashtag to uh uh in
[2:49] conjunction with true family and it's a
[2:52] social media uh tool we're utilizing it
[2:54] to address misconceptions when it comes
[2:57] to family and when you say we want to
[2:59] speak on a family and then we even use
[3:01] this statement where brother brandham
[3:02] says that this masterpiece family
[3:05] husband and wife All In Harmony in
[3:07] agreement and love and then makes a
[3:09] statement you know all true family here
[3:11] portrays that and so we ask ourselves
[3:14] well are we really a true family uh and
[3:16] then so it kind of puts this sets this
[3:18] bar for family relationships family
[3:20] Dynamics and even the image that our
[3:23] family is in and how we live our lives
[3:25] and how this is expressed and manifested
[3:27] to others and so we're using this hasht
[3:29] tag no filter to kind of deal with some
[3:31] of the misconceptions we make about
[3:33] ourselves misconceptions we make about
[3:35] teaching some of the conclusions that we
[3:37] draw and to use a hashtag which would be
[3:41] uh you know a pound sign or a sharp
[3:43] symbol in music and uh you know maybe
[3:45] different ways that you might look at it
[3:46] but to use that in the context I'm using
[3:49] it is it's used uh basically as a a way
[3:52] to label a post label a picture label
[3:54] content that's posted to many different
[3:57] uh forums or or different ways of
[3:59] disseminating information and it allows
[4:02] for searching you can search by hashtag
[4:04] it allows for connecting certain topics
[4:06] or getting people's attention organize
[4:08] certain things or to promote things and
[4:10] so it's something you would use on your
[4:12] Instagram account if you wanted to
[4:13] invite everybody to church you'd say uh
[4:15] we're having church Sunday at 10:00 a.m.
[4:18] at the Courtyard by Marriott and say
[4:20] hash having fun or something like that
[4:22] and people who want to have fun could
[4:24] search that hashtag and sister Elizabeth
[4:27] I I came up with a hashtag for
[4:28] Gettysburg a few years ago hashtag never
[4:31] gets old because you just you go and
[4:33] it's always beautiful you always enjoy
[4:35] it so just kind of a way of of modifying
[4:37] something or or amending something and
[4:40] so that's what it's that's what its use
[4:42] is and I didn't want to mislead anybody
[4:44] wanted to kind of throw that out there
[4:45] that maybe there's some actual utility
[4:47] within uh the social media context but
[4:50] then this phrase no filter hash no
[4:53] filter is used when posting photos and
[4:57] to give the impression or at least
[4:59] suggest that the image itself has not
[5:01] been manipulated or changed in any way
[5:04] so I took this picture this Sunset is
[5:06] exactly what you're scene is what hit
[5:08] the lens and if it looks beautiful
[5:10] that's compliments to the camera it's
[5:12] compliments to the photographer it's
[5:13] compliments to the framing and the
[5:15] lighting and everything that they were
[5:16] able to achieve naturally without using
[5:18] a filter to enhance certain colors or or
[5:21] photoshop to get rid of certain people
[5:23] say this is just raw this is what it is
[5:27] and so to say true family # no filter it
[5:30] conveys the idea that that I'm
[5:32] challenging you as an individual to not
[5:35] create a carnal image of what a family
[5:38] is supposed to be in other words brother
[5:40] Brown makes a statement oh well then I
[5:41] guess my family has to be this way and
[5:43] since my family can't be this way then I
[5:45] guess I can't I can't be a true family
[5:47] or or uh any kind of teaching you just
[5:50] kind of draw this conclusion it can only
[5:52] be this way and since it has to be this
[5:54] way and I don't fit the mold then even
[5:56] what's being taught isn't relevant to me
[5:58] so you can take uh certain things that
[6:00] are said and then filter it and create
[6:02] the wrong kind of picture and then also
[6:04] we're challenging us as individuals to
[6:06] not try to filter our lives and just use
[6:09] something artificial to gain a
[6:11] particular expression but just let the
[6:13] Lord live through me I want it to be
[6:15] authentic I want to be genuine I want
[6:17] him to be working from the inside out
[6:19] and just be who I am and there was a
[6:22] number of different statements that we
[6:23] used to express that and we took this
[6:26] statement from the Masterpiece how the
[6:27] brother bam is saying a true family is a
[6:30] picture of Harmony and love then if
[6:32] that's the picture of a true family I
[6:34] don't want to carnally grab a hold of
[6:35] that picture and then fabricate a
[6:38] representation of that image whether to
[6:40] wrestle with the teaching or to try to
[6:42] produce that in my own life and if we do
[6:45] that if we filter things the wrong way
[6:47] and I pondering a lot on brother bram's
[6:49] teaching on a thinking man's filter and
[6:52] how that there's a proper filter that we
[6:53] ought to use and there there's a way
[6:54] that we ought to filter things from the
[6:56] world and we have that word filter but
[6:58] then the word we we don't filter it
[7:00] through our own ideas we don't filter it
[7:02] through man's understandings we just
[7:03] take the word raw we just let it come we
[7:05] let Faith grab a hold of it and so if we
[7:08] use a filter on certain things then what
[7:10] it does is it creates a pressure and we
[7:13] were using this in light of just the
[7:14] phen social media phenomena it it puts a
[7:17] pressure to achieve a visual Perfection
[7:19] I want my family to look the part I want
[7:21] I want my as a couple we want to looked
[7:23] AP part we want everything to be in
[7:25] order and so we kind of have this
[7:26] pressure to always have visual
[7:28] Perfection or maybe we're even pursuing
[7:30] the wrong image it has to be this way it
[7:32] must look this way and so it creates
[7:34] pressure and then not only can It create
[7:36] pressure but it can create
[7:38] paralysis and uh and I guess I'm
[7:40] speaking to everybody who's always
[7:41] motivated but there's times when the
[7:43] pressure Rams up but instead of getting
[7:45] a job done you get paralyzed there's so
[7:47] much pressure you can't get anything
[7:49] done and then it happens to all of us
[7:51] and some of us are overachievers and
[7:53] some of us are very ambitious and some
[7:55] of us have never had a sad day in our
[7:57] lives and we get out of bed and we just
[7:58] start knocking down the to-do list but
[8:00] there's times in our lives for some
[8:01] people that we can be so overwhelmed
[8:04] that even if we don't have a lot to do
[8:06] we get paralyzed and we can't do
[8:08] anything and so the wrong kind of filter
[8:10] the wrong kind of expectations the wrong
[8:12] kind of understanding of teachings and
[8:15] scriptures and quotations can not only
[8:17] produce pressure but it can produce a
[8:19] paralysis where you just can't even do
[8:20] anything and you can't go
[8:22] forward and so I'd like to just connect
[8:26] the things that we were speaking on on
[8:27] Sunday with what we spoke last
[8:31] Wednesday and say at its foundation or
[8:33] if you just boiled it down to a basic or
[8:35] its single most important component the
[8:38] true family is one that puts God
[8:40] first and if you're doing that if you're
[8:43] doing that at whatever level of Faith
[8:44] you have if you're doing that in
[8:45] whatever circumstance you're in if
[8:47] you're doing that in the in the path
[8:49] that you're presently in that's the most
[8:51] that you could ask from somebody you can
[8:53] see some individuals that are very far
[8:55] down the road in their walk with God and
[8:57] we use the the idea of hike your own
[8:59] hike and you see somebody who's serving
[9:01] the lord and surrendering to God and
[9:03] they have many years of experience and
[9:05] they could be at a particular place in
[9:07] their walk with God and here you're just
[9:08] starting out you're just starting your
[9:10] journey to begin to compare yourself to
[9:12] somebody at that stage can produce
[9:14] discouragement but if you're putting God
[9:16] first if you're walking in the light
[9:17] that he's shown you that's really all
[9:19] that you can do and so true family is
[9:22] one that puts God first the word is
[9:23] first we want Christ to have preeminence
[9:26] and we use the scripture we use the
[9:28] story of the Widow of Zar F on Sunday
[9:31] morning and how that here she was caught
[9:33] in this scene of Elijah's Ministry and a
[9:36] time of famine and she was out grabbing
[9:39] two sticks to make bread for her and her
[9:42] son and then they were going to die and
[9:43] Elijah comes and says get me water and
[9:46] she instinctively went I'm going to go
[9:48] get him water and he says and also make
[9:50] me a cake and she said I'm being honest
[9:53] with you I was getting ready to go make
[9:55] a cake one last meal for me and my son
[9:58] and we were going to die because that's
[9:59] all we have left is a little bit of Mill
[10:00] and a little bit of oil and Elijah said
[10:03] I tell you what make me one first and
[10:06] then one for you and your son and she
[10:08] did exactly that and by at the word of
[10:11] the Prophet she had provision and she
[10:12] was sustained and it said in First Kings
[10:15] chapter 17:9 arise get ye to zerath
[10:18] which belongeth to ziden and dwell there
[10:20] behold I have commanded I have appointed
[10:23] I have ordained a widow woman there to
[10:25] sustain thee and the simple image I
[10:28] wanted to draw from this though we view
[10:30] her as a widow and we view it with
[10:32] somewhat of a distance this story being
[10:35] thousands of years old to us I want just
[10:37] to kind of take it and unfilter it but
[10:39] look at it within its context and
[10:41] realize that this was a single mother
[10:45] here she she's a single mother she was a
[10:46] victim of circumstance and she's not the
[10:49] image that we imagine a true family to
[10:51] be in like who would be worthy to
[10:53] sustain the messenger who would be
[10:55] worthy to be identified with Elijah who
[10:57] would be worthy cuz God told him go and
[10:59] dwell there and they figure it was about
[11:01] 2 years that he dwelt with this family
[11:03] and we say well the prophet he's got to
[11:04] stay with royalty he's got to stay with
[11:06] somebody of a particular status and it's
[11:08] got to be this situation or that
[11:10] situation but this is who God chose a
[11:12] single mother was appointed by God to
[11:15] preserve the prophet and his ministry
[11:18] this is who God chose a woman in
[11:20] unfortunate circumstance he chose her
[11:22] and she was going to want be the one
[11:23] that had the initial resources that God
[11:26] could use and now her testimony is great
[11:29] and we're encouraged by her testimony
[11:31] and we we gain uh great comfort in
[11:33] seeing the hand of God but I want you to
[11:35] look at it in that sense that maybe just
[11:37] looking at it optically we'd say well
[11:39] this is a single woman we don't know the
[11:41] exact circumstances of how her husband
[11:42] died but here she is a mother of a child
[11:45] she's uh maybe we could take exception
[11:47] that she hasn't been able to manage the
[11:48] meal well and manage the oil and she's
[11:51] given up and she thinks she's going to
[11:52] die but this is who God chose say man
[11:55] this woman was a mess but God said I've
[11:56] ordained her I've commanded her and
[11:59] brother Bram said she put God before her
[12:01] children she put God before anything
[12:03] else she taken the kingdom of God first
[12:07] and really that's all that we can do
[12:10] that that's the first thing that we must
[12:11] do is individually now uh we talk about
[12:14] families but what makes up a family
[12:16] individuals it's not this body that we
[12:19] kind of melt into and we lose our
[12:21] individuality but it's something that
[12:22] individually we must do we must put the
[12:24] word first Christ must have preeminence
[12:26] in our individual lives because if not
[12:29] the family unit isn't some Dynamic that
[12:31] overcomes all other Dynamics as an
[12:33] individual we have to take our place as
[12:35] an individual we operate within the
[12:37] dynamic of the family and so just to by
[12:41] way of trying to summarize some of the
[12:43] things that have been burdened my heart
[12:44] last Sunday uh last Wednesday but then
[12:46] just to kind of marry it with putting
[12:48] God first and and seeking him first and
[12:51] family not being greater than the word
[12:52] of God I want to say in this context
[12:55] that as a woman she as just as an
[12:57] individual she could not change her past
[13:00] and I might just maybe chasing this idea
[13:02] for the remainder of the service all she
[13:04] could do she couldn't change her past
[13:07] all she could do is just set the word
[13:10] before her as her
[13:12] aim all she could do is she could she
[13:15] could tell she could tell the prophet
[13:16] well my husband died and and this person
[13:19] took advantage of me and I had someone
[13:20] break into my home and steal my meal and
[13:22] and the first batch of oil I got was
[13:24] spoiled and and she could have just had
[13:26] a whole bunch of explanations to them
[13:28] and really there's nothing you could do
[13:30] there's nothing she could do about her
[13:31] past be relevant to understand her
[13:33] situation and give context but her if
[13:35] she's going to place her faith on
[13:37] anything she couldn't Place her hope in
[13:39] that her past would change but she could
[13:42] put her faith in a path towards change
[13:45] she could look she could put the word
[13:46] before her as her future and just go
[13:48] forward and I was pondering it this week
[13:51] and I just and even last week I was like
[13:53] my there's just so many different
[13:54] examples you can use when you put it in
[13:56] this context but really the Bible as you
[13:58] read from Genesis to Revelation it gives
[14:00] us an unfiltered story of
[14:02] redemption it just gives it to us just
[14:05] exactly the way it is and uh and you
[14:08] read of different ones and why I mean it
[14:10] seems like the story about Tamar I mean
[14:12] maybe they could have just put it in a
[14:13] little bit different context uh but yet
[14:15] you read that story you're like okay
[14:17] this is it's getting
[14:18] real and then you read in other places
[14:20] you're like oh my goodness could they
[14:22] just I mean brushed over that but God
[14:25] allowed the writers of the Old Testament
[14:27] and even the New Testament to kind of
[14:28] just give to us the way that it was and
[14:31] it was written that way to give us hope
[14:34] we read about somebody like David who's
[14:35] a man after God's Own Heart and we read
[14:37] about his failures and his weaknesses
[14:39] and what he goes through and it's done
[14:41] not so that we could justify ourselves
[14:43] but it's done to give us hope as human
[14:45] beings that there's Redemption out of
[14:47] our mistakes there's Redemption from a
[14:49] horrible past and that even God can use
[14:51] a Tamar can use a Rahab can use a bath
[14:53] Sheba in the very lineage of Jesus
[14:55] Christ and so the Bible is really an
[14:58] unfiltered Raw Story of redemption and
[15:01] you think that if we're going to sit
[15:02] down and write a book we try to cover
[15:04] this and cover that make everything
[15:05] match but God allowed it to come forward
[15:07] in a way to give us confidence that the
[15:10] same God who made the promise is the
[15:12] same God who's working in our lives
[15:14] because none of us have a perfect
[15:17] narrative so what has God done in the
[15:19] Bible he's preserved mistakes and
[15:20] blemishes and even the failures of his
[15:22] people for our
[15:25] edification and so I believe that it's
[15:27] an encouragement to us because God would
[15:29] not write that so that we could make M
[15:31] uh make mistakes and then justify them
[15:34] and listen there's a there's a there's a
[15:36] way that God wants to comfort us and
[15:39] there's a way that God wants to redeem
[15:40] us from our mistakes and encourage us
[15:42] about a path forward in our failures and
[15:45] the things in our past but there comes a
[15:47] point where we can no longer just wallow
[15:50] in the past and our complexes and what
[15:52] somebody else did to us there's a point
[15:53] where God's going to say hey it's time
[15:55] to move forward I've given you a promise
[15:57] for that I've given you examples of that
[16:00] I've touched you I've done something for
[16:01] you and you could see that Moses would
[16:03] be an example of that God trains him for
[16:05] years establishes uh vindicates his
[16:08] ministry establishes his presence with
[16:10] Moses and it finally got to a point of
[16:12] God nurturing him through all these
[16:13] years he finally said hey stop crying
[16:15] just speak and thank God that's not what
[16:18] he did in the beginning and that's not
[16:20] what he does to us in the beginning but
[16:22] I mention that now to say if we're
[16:24] looking at um our Brokenness if we're
[16:26] looking at weaknesses and failures and
[16:27] mistakes and saying hey you can't change
[16:29] your past let's go forward I don't want
[16:31] to phrase it in such a way to ref feel
[16:32] that you can always play that card or
[16:35] call back on well I was abused as a
[16:37] child or well I've never sat uh I've
[16:39] never had this opportunity and this has
[16:41] happened and that's happened and kind of
[16:42] always use as an excuse for where you
[16:44] are now that it's because of my past I
[16:47] am where I am now but rather take it as
[16:50] God gives you a Grace God knows those
[16:51] things God will deal with those things
[16:53] and then at some point using the
[16:54] momentum of God vindicating his presence
[16:57] in your life say Lord I can go forward
[16:58] from this I'm not going to be a prisoner
[17:00] to my past I'm not going to be a
[17:01] prisoner to mistakes that I've made so
[17:03] regardless of the situation God can take
[17:06] our Brokenness God can take our mistakes
[17:08] and make something beautiful out of it
[17:11] it's remarkable he's the only one that
[17:12] can do it only God could say I can work
[17:15] all things and not qualify it to the
[17:19] good so looking at this in Acts chap 16:
[17:22] 1 to5 and we'll kind of read through
[17:25] this uh just wasn't sure exactly how to
[17:27] attack it so I just have the scriptures
[17:29] before
[17:30] me and it's speaking of Paul and Silas
[17:33] and they come to uh uh Derby and Lyra
[17:36] and behold a certain disciple was there
[17:38] named timotheus and this is Timothy and
[17:41] it says he's a disciple so he was
[17:42] already believing and it says he was the
[17:45] son of a certain woman now that's
[17:47] remarkable that they want to identify
[17:50] who he is and he was the son of a
[17:52] certain woman and it seems to be a
[17:54] peculiar phrase uh we would we would
[17:56] just assume he was the son of a certain
[17:58] woman and not just a bunch of women but
[18:00] it's phrased this way to give us this
[18:02] idea that this woman was significant or
[18:04] report there was something about her
[18:06] that uh that Luke is alluding to and it
[18:08] says which was a Jewish so she was Jew a
[18:10] Jew and she believed so now think about
[18:13] Timothy now this Timothy we're talking
[18:15] about is the one that Paul writes later
[18:17] Paul says you're like a son to me and
[18:19] this is the one that Paul establishes as
[18:21] one that's going to take the church
[18:22] forward and says many many complimentary
[18:25] things to him and says many things to
[18:27] Timothy that um are
[18:29] so well you could just say they were so
[18:31] important for us to understand that God
[18:33] memorialized these letters to Timothy in
[18:35] the scripture as instructive to us so
[18:37] now this is Timothy's life now his
[18:40] mother was a Jew and she believed so she
[18:43] was a Jew that had become a Christian so
[18:44] it says and believed this is a Jew
[18:46] that's converted to Christianity but his
[18:48] father was a Greek so we know his father
[18:51] was not a Jew which was well reported of
[18:54] by the Brethren that were at lra and
[18:55] Iconium so maybe his testimony the
[18:57] conversion of his mother and the fact
[18:59] that his father was not a Believer him
[19:01] would Paul have to go forth with him
[19:03] this is the one that Paul chose to
[19:06] travel with him become an understudy to
[19:07] become a student and took and
[19:09] circumcised him because of the Jews
[19:11] which were in those quarters for they
[19:13] knew all that his father was a Greek
[19:15] kind of now feels like Luke's trying to
[19:17] make a point I don't know if you caught
[19:19] this the first time but his dad was a
[19:22] Greek I don't know if you caught this
[19:24] the first time but his dad was a gentile
[19:27] wasn't a Believer and as they they went
[19:29] through the cities now Timothy's a part
[19:30] of this they delivered them the decrees
[19:32] for to keep that were ordained of the
[19:34] Apostles and Elders which are at
[19:36] Jerusalem and now Timothy this believer
[19:38] and so were the churches established in
[19:40] the faith and increased in number daily
[19:43] this is part of the ministry that
[19:44] Timothy's called to and begins to engage
[19:46] in now if we look at it as it's
[19:48] presented here in the scripture Timothy
[19:50] has a very unique family structure and
[19:53] let's just look at it for what it is
[19:54] he's the product of a mixed marriage
[19:56] between a Jew and a gentile his mother
[19:58] was a Jew his mother was a Believer but
[20:00] he was not raised a Jew because Paul now
[20:03] has him circumcised so here he's the son
[20:05] of a Jew and the son of a gentile so
[20:08] he's in a mixed he's in a mixed family
[20:09] one's one's a Jew of the faith of the
[20:12] Jews one that would was called that God
[20:14] was sent the Messiah to and you see that
[20:16] she has followed uh uh his mother has
[20:19] followed in this pattern of of
[20:21] conversion from being a Jew to being a
[20:23] Christian but then the dad he he he
[20:25] remains
[20:26] unconverted so Timothy comes you say
[20:29] maybe a mixed family not maybe a broken
[20:31] family in the sense that there being a
[20:33] separation but here's the mom who's a
[20:34] Believer the dad who's an unbeliever and
[20:37] the son becomes a Believer and a
[20:39] follower of Christ and Paul chooses him
[20:41] to go with him into the field into
[20:43] Ministry and becomes a very Dynamic
[20:45] figure in the New Testament and so if
[20:48] you look at his family situation he's
[20:49] not coming from the Upper
[20:51] Crust he doesn't have the pedigree that
[20:54] maybe sometimes we require of certain
[20:56] people when we come in contact with with
[20:57] them in the message here he is coming
[20:59] from this this situation now this is how
[21:02] that is how the Luke wrote it but then
[21:04] Paul may be KNN a little bit more about
[21:06] the situation says it this way in 2
[21:08] Timothy chapter 1 Excuse Me 2 Timothy
[21:12] 1:5 says when I call to remembrance the
[21:14] unfeigned faith the sincere faith that
[21:17] is with thee now notice how Paul begins
[21:22] to identify and amplify this Faith
[21:23] Timothy you have a sincere Faith you
[21:26] have a genuine faith and this faith that
[21:28] is with the first dwelt or dwelt first
[21:30] in thy grandmother Lois in thy mother
[21:33] Eunice and I'm persuaded that it's in
[21:35] thee also that in thee also so Paul once
[21:39] again now Luke was quick to point out
[21:41] the fact that his father was a Greek
[21:44] we've heard it twice Paul just kind of
[21:46] Skips over it Paul doesn't even mention
[21:48] it and it's suggesting that his father
[21:51] remained an
[21:52] unbeliever so you have now a a little
[21:54] bit deeper picture here's the
[21:56] grandmother Lois she would have been a
[21:59] and now she becomes a Christian Lois
[22:01] becoming a Christian by her witness
[22:03] converts and maybe I'm just telling the
[22:04] story because Paul says it dwelt first
[22:06] in the grandmother having first dwelt in
[22:09] the grandmother now she becomes a
[22:11] Christian now there's places in the New
[22:13] Testament where the couples are
[22:15] identified a and and the the husband and
[22:17] wife being Believers they're given
[22:19] they're identified and Paul could have
[22:21] done so here but he doesn't make mention
[22:22] of the grandfather so I'm just going to
[22:25] say it let's just make the Assumption
[22:26] and I'm not saying it's true but that
[22:29] the grandpa wasn't a
[22:30] Believer and so now the Grandma's a
[22:33] Believer and here's a family of
[22:35] believing and unbelieving and maybe she
[22:37] was a Jew married to a Jew maybe she was
[22:39] married to a gentile but now she comes
[22:41] from a Jew and she converts to
[22:42] Christianity and I could just see the
[22:44] grand Paul saying well make up your mind
[22:45] what are you circumcised uncircumcised
[22:47] reprobate or Jew is your father Abraham
[22:50] is your father Jesus who is it sure
[22:52] there could be some conflict in the
[22:55] house my grandpa voice is going to ruin
[22:58] my voice
[22:59] excuse
[23:00] me but uh so now it's Lois the grandma
[23:05] who by her witness to her daughter
[23:07] Eunice converts her daughter to
[23:10] Christianity and now her son Timothy is
[23:12] being raised in the faith it wasn't a
[23:15] Jew you could say that he was being
[23:16] raised in a mixed family he wasn't
[23:18] raised as a Jew but now it says at first
[23:20] dwelt in your grandma then this is a
[23:22] faith that your mother Eunice had Lois
[23:24] Eunice and now Timothy has this what's
[23:27] the point I make it's very simple God
[23:29] took a son who is a product of a mixed
[23:31] marriage a marriage between a gentile
[23:33] and a Jew a marriage of believing and
[23:35] unbelieving unbelieving and made him a
[23:36] leader in the New Testament Church
[23:39] that's an example of how that God could
[23:40] take a situation that on the surface
[23:43] it's like yeah I don't know about that
[23:44] but yet God can take it and still use
[23:47] it and this and there's so many other
[23:50] instances in scriptures that we could
[23:52] use but not only does does the scripture
[23:54] take care to share this example to us in
[23:57] Acts chapter 16 and then Paul mentioned
[24:00] in 2 Timothy chapter 1 but the New
[24:02] Testament self addresses many different
[24:05] uh difficult issues and one in fact Paul
[24:07] goes ahead and says hey look there's
[24:09] situations where there's going to be
[24:10] believing and unbelieving and he does it
[24:12] to the Corinthian Church in First
[24:14] Corinthians chapter
[24:15] 7:14 says for the unbelieving husband is
[24:18] Sanctified by the wife and you could
[24:21] just read it as the believing wife
[24:23] because in this setting he's saying hey
[24:25] if they if they're pleased to dwell
[24:26] together let them dwell together so he
[24:28] says the unbelieving husband is
[24:30] Sanctified by the wife and the
[24:32] unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the
[24:34] husband else were your children unclean
[24:36] but now are they
[24:38] holy Paul is Paul is is not hiding it
[24:41] this is not a varnished view of what
[24:43] Christianity is but it it goes ahead and
[24:45] kind of opens up acknowledges that
[24:47] there's going to be situations where
[24:48] husband and wife may not be in harmony
[24:51] they may not be in agreement but it it
[24:53] gives you the word of God and the mind
[24:54] of God a and God's wisdom on how to
[24:57] handle these situations says not
[24:59] everybody's going to be able to be in a
[25:00] perfect
[25:01] family my title I was going to give
[25:03] tonight is pobody's
[25:05] nerfect right I mean nobody's
[25:10] perfect little spoonerism
[25:13] there and so in that we realize that God
[25:17] in the scripture takes Timothy from a
[25:19] unique situation Paul admonishing
[25:21] believing wives and believing husbands
[25:23] to not despair if they have unbelieving
[25:25] spouses he said' look these things are
[25:27] going to happen
[25:29] and in the day and age we're living in
[25:30] we live in a time when there's very
[25:32] unique things that are going to happen
[25:35] at the church I went to in Texas and uh
[25:37] there was uh in one particular service
[25:39] we noticed that there was a couple at
[25:40] the back of the church with a young baby
[25:42] and they just come in from the
[25:43] neighborhood and we found out uh that
[25:45] they were unmarried but they had a a
[25:47] baby together they're raising a baby and
[25:50] we noticed that through time uh the boy
[25:52] would come with the baby and the girl
[25:54] wasn't coming and uh they sat down at
[25:57] one time with the pastor p and asked you
[25:58] know we'd like to have the baby
[25:59] dedicated and and it's like well you
[26:02] know we need to know a little bit more
[26:03] about your situation and then uh the
[26:07] pastor was out of town and so as the the
[26:09] associate I got a phone call said hey uh
[26:11] I need you to counsel with so and so
[26:13] this morning I said well I said okay
[26:16] what's the situation he says well he's
[26:18] actually a
[26:19] she and it was a young girl who's
[26:22] dressing and pretending to be a man and
[26:23] was trying to raise this baby uh with
[26:26] this with his or her I they them baby
[26:30] situation the as a as a girl she was
[26:32] wanting to live and identify as a boy
[26:35] and was and ra raising this baby and
[26:38] they were living together and comes over
[26:39] with this baby and she sits down and she
[26:41] wants to talk about how that she's come
[26:43] to church and the word just begin to
[26:44] wash her and she no longer wants to live
[26:46] this life and she just begin to change
[26:48] she turned into a very beautiful young
[26:50] lady and uh shortly after that that we
[26:53] didn't see her anymore and then we got
[26:55] uh I I one one Sunday morning service at
[26:58] the end a lady came up to the front and
[27:01] she said do you remember do you remember
[27:03] my daughter so and so yes we remember
[27:05] she said she was murdered last week and
[27:08] she said but I wanted to come here
[27:09] because she said this is where her life
[27:11] changed and I wanted to thank you for
[27:13] changing her life and there a very
[27:16] there's a lot of details that we could
[27:17] share but that's a really complicated
[27:20] situation how many of us would be
[27:22] willing to uh believe for redemption in
[27:25] a case like that how many of us would be
[27:27] willing to let someone like that uh uh
[27:29] walk Within These doors a and let the
[27:31] word of God make a difference let the
[27:33] word of God wash them let the love of
[27:34] God be expressed and those are the kind
[27:36] of situations you deal with in the day
[27:38] and age that we're living in and these
[27:40] things have always been but there's a
[27:41] lot of uh difficult marriage situations
[27:43] a lot of difficult personal situations
[27:46] and we got to lead a lot leave a lot of
[27:47] opinion and personal judgment aside and
[27:49] believe in a God who can amen and that's
[27:53] what we can get from this realizing
[27:54] pobud is nerfect that God can use
[27:56] dysfunction for his glory
[27:58] that God could take situations that are
[28:01] certainly not ideal and broken and hard
[28:03] to understand and very difficult and he
[28:05] can use it for his glory if we will
[28:08] yield ourselves to
[28:10] him so what I want to challenge you with
[28:12] tonight is we're trying just to sum up
[28:14] these initial thoughts on the family is
[28:17] from this moment on as individuals just
[28:19] purpose in our hearts that I will take
[28:21] your picture God I will take your
[28:23] picture and I'll walk towards it in
[28:26] faith what you would desire to me to
[28:28] Lord unfold this image before me let me
[28:30] walk in this image that you have for me
[28:32] and I'm not going to keep looking back
[28:33] I'm just going to look forward to what
[28:34] you have for me I'm not going to
[28:36] rationalize I'm not going to make
[28:37] excuses but Lord take me as a vessel now
[28:39] I yield myself to you and I want to walk
[28:41] forward in a plain path and I want to
[28:43] walk into that image that you have for
[28:44] me now in Luke Chapter 9:62 it says and
[28:48] Jesus said unto them no man having put
[28:50] his hand to the plow and looking back is
[28:53] fit for the kingdom of God using this
[28:56] idea this image of one who is sewing and
[28:58] one who's plowing one who's plowing and
[29:01] sewing with the purpose of uh reaping
[29:04] this the one that sews seed his eyes
[29:08] looks toward the fruit of his
[29:10] labor he can't second guess he can't go
[29:12] back and try to change things once the
[29:14] things that have happened you just have
[29:15] to keep going forward and no man who's
[29:17] going to work and going to labor and go
[29:19] forward with Christ you can't keep
[29:20] looking
[29:21] back there can't be reluctance there
[29:23] can't be regret there's we apologize we
[29:25] make mistakes we ask for forgiveness but
[29:27] it's some point we got to ask God to
[29:29] forgive us we have to acknowledge our
[29:30] mistakes and our transgressions before
[29:32] the Lord if we have to make something
[29:33] right with somebody we do that we say
[29:35] Lord I'm going forward now say Lord help
[29:38] me with my memory help me with my
[29:40] affections help me with the things that
[29:41] drag on to me but we got to lay aside
[29:43] the weight I wanted to really amplify
[29:45] that scripture this evening and I just I
[29:47] took it out of the notes for time sake
[29:49] but if we're going to be looking towards
[29:51] Jesus who the is the author and finisher
[29:53] of our faith we must lay aside the
[29:55] weight and the thoughts and the memories
[29:58] the reasons and the affections that so
[29:59] easily beset us and say Lord I'm coming
[30:01] toward you I'm walking towards you I'm
[30:03] going to grow in your grace and I don't
[30:04] want all this baggage to hold me
[30:07] back so a farmer as Jesus uses this
[30:10] image he labors with the Harvest in view
[30:13] he's not doing all the work in the
[30:14] winter uh without the knowledge that
[30:16] there's a harvest in the in the in the
[30:18] fall all his labor all his work is with
[30:20] the Harvest in View and if you think
[30:22] about one on the plow and you're plowing
[30:24] a field if you begin to look back what's
[30:26] going to happen to your line
[30:28] you look back your Line's going to vary
[30:30] you're going to deviate from the path
[30:32] you're going to cause the rose to not be
[30:34] in line so he says if you're going to
[30:35] put your hands to the plow if you're
[30:37] going to go forward if you're going to
[30:38] serve Christ if you're going to take his
[30:39] grace from this moment on and go forward
[30:41] with a new start and a new beginning if
[30:43] you're going to confess and believe that
[30:44] we're new creatures in Christ Jesus all
[30:46] things have become new then what we want
[30:48] to do is put our hands on the plow put
[30:49] our eyes on the word and just go
[30:54] forward brother Bram makes this
[30:56] statement in the message how can I
[30:59] overcome and there's another part here I
[31:01] don't believe I provided the quote but I
[31:03] I'll I'll come to it in a moment to
[31:04] provide some
[31:06] context he says whatever you do who is
[31:08] listening now or who will listen
[31:10] Hereafter the hour is very
[31:12] late and you do have good intention but
[31:15] be caught inside he's talking about how
[31:17] those in the days of Noah were caught
[31:19] outside the ark and so you could have
[31:21] good intentions be sincere but make sure
[31:22] you're in that word you're in that body
[31:24] by one baptism we're baptized into the
[31:27] body of Christ Christ now he says this
[31:29] because we have this uh this yielding
[31:32] and or well we want to be new creatures
[31:34] we want to be seal with the Holy Ghost
[31:35] which is the new birth this is what we
[31:36] want God to do for us and then he
[31:38] identifies you want to be caught inside
[31:40] but then we you don't want to make this
[31:42] the wrong kind of effort he says now
[31:44] don't
[31:45] struggle not him that willth or him that
[31:48] runneth but God he says just let God
[31:51] just yield yourself to him and walk on
[31:54] with the perfect satisfied faith that
[31:57] what God is promised he is able to
[31:59] perform so it's not it's not up to you
[32:02] to try to filter your past to make sense
[32:04] of it it's not up to you to try to
[32:06] figure out how to make the picture work
[32:08] going
[32:09] forward Lord I am what I am I I I've
[32:13] made mistakes I can't change that even
[32:15] some things I can't help being what I am
[32:17] because of this circumstance or that
[32:18] circumstance Lord I acknowledge this
[32:20] this is who who I am this is where I am
[32:23] but Lord I'm going to trust in a God he
[32:24] says that has made the promise and he's
[32:26] able to perform it and what is perfect
[32:28] is my satisfied
[32:30] faith I'm going forward what God has
[32:32] promised he's able to perform and he and
[32:34] then he just relates it to all the
[32:36] things we try to do not joining one
[32:37] denomination another denomination it's
[32:39] not going to fix it just because you
[32:40] join a
[32:41] church running this that or the other
[32:44] trying this all these little things we
[32:45] may try to do he says just yield
[32:48] yourself to God and walk with him
[32:50] peaceful quiet not interrupted wow I
[32:54] like that where what what app do I need
[32:57] to download for that just yield yourself
[33:00] to God walk with him peaceful quiet not
[33:02] interrupted just keep on walking with
[33:05] him attending to the Lord without
[33:08] distraction keeping him first that's
[33:10] right he says that's what I told our
[33:11] brother that just had the breakdown now
[33:15] I'm going to go ahead and just do it
[33:15] maybe a little bit I just want to stop
[33:17] there he says that's what I told our
[33:18] brother that just had the breakdown so
[33:21] you can keep that this statement up
[33:22] there and maybe you're reading the head
[33:24] but I'll just read what brother Bram
[33:25] says earlier paragraph eight of how can
[33:27] I overcome just went into the room just
[33:29] now and a brother about my age and his
[33:30] wife sitting there and the Holy Spirit
[33:32] there came down amongst us in the room
[33:34] and just think making mention of a
[33:36] healing service there he was and he told
[33:39] this brother all about what he had done
[33:42] and what he had been doing and what
[33:43] caused his trouble and where he come
[33:45] from and all about him so we can say the
[33:48] Holy Spirit read his life story and knew
[33:51] what he had been doing his past says and
[33:53] there was a great Dark Shadow hung in
[33:55] the room and then it started getting
[33:56] lighter lighter lighter lighter lighter
[33:58] than the Holy Spirit took hold they come
[34:00] from around near Yakima Washington and
[34:02] drove in and he's a minister of the
[34:04] Gospel but just to see the grace of God
[34:06] there where the man had been in the
[34:08] institution had treatments and
[34:09] everything the Holy Spirit revealing all
[34:11] this when the doctors trying hard to do
[34:13] everything that they could perhaps for
[34:15] the man but it just took that certain
[34:17] little touch from God to turn the tide
[34:20] shock treatments is all right but that's
[34:21] kind of what we'd call a shot in the
[34:22] dark you know it might make you worse
[34:24] cuz you'd forget everything you ever
[34:26] knew when they put that medicine in you
[34:28] but the Lord God how his grace and mercy
[34:31] even before I ever offered a word of
[34:33] prayer for him it was already over just
[34:35] took that certain something of God that
[34:38] certain touch to do
[34:40] it now there's a lot that you could read
[34:43] into this but it was all he had done
[34:44] what he had been doing what caused his
[34:46] trouble where he come from and all about
[34:48] him and all it took was for God to touch
[34:50] him for him to come on the scene that
[34:53] little certain touch from God and it
[34:54] turned the tide of everything that he
[34:56] had done what he had been doing what
[34:58] causes trouble where he come from and
[34:59] all about him and so brother bandam is
[35:01] not saying look you've done a lot of
[35:03] dirt you've done a lot of damage you've
[35:04] done a lot of different things we know
[35:05] where you've been we know what you've
[35:06] done uh we know where you come from and
[35:09] all about you so there's going to be
[35:10] some kind of qualification on your faith
[35:12] going forward as a result of all the
[35:14] stupid things you've done before that's
[35:16] not what God
[35:18] said that's not how God dealt with the
[35:20] individual that's not how God was saying
[35:22] well you're going to have to pay the
[35:23] price but he says it just took a certain
[35:25] something from God in that touch to he
[35:27] say it was all already over so notice
[35:29] how brother brandham puts it in these
[35:31] words I find this just so beautiful and
[35:34] and it's something you want to write
[35:35] down and remember he says that's what I
[35:36] just told our brother that just had the
[35:38] breakdown just yield to him he's here he
[35:41] knowed what you have done and what
[35:43] caused your being and doing this way and
[35:45] all that look at it from a the the the
[35:49] 55,000 foot view in the sense that he
[35:51] knows the makeup of your nature he knows
[35:54] the kind of nurture you've been under he
[35:56] knows the relationship ship you've had
[35:58] he knows the sufferings that you've had
[35:59] by the hands of people he knows the lies
[36:01] he knows the failures he knows the
[36:03] failed expectations he knows all the
[36:05] lies you've told he knows your ins and
[36:06] outs and your ups and downs he knows
[36:08] everything you've done what caused your
[36:09] being what to be that way doing this way
[36:11] and all that he knows all about you and
[36:14] now he's just told you back just what to
[36:16] do and what is he to do only thing you
[36:20] have to do is just go do
[36:22] it
[36:24] okay that is forget all about the Past
[36:28] walk live for the future in the glory
[36:31] and presence of
[36:33] God could you do that tonight forget
[36:36] about the past From This Moment On
[36:39] you're not trying to revise
[36:41] history not trying to even not even
[36:43] trying to make sense of History not
[36:45] trying to connect the dots say God I
[36:47] know where you've called me to this
[36:48] point now I know where I am now and and
[36:51] I I I'm not I can't change the past and
[36:54] there and I can't go back and redo
[36:56] certain things so here I am today say
[36:58] Lord I'm going to yield to you you take
[36:59] it from here and in this very passage
[37:02] brother brandham uses the example of a
[37:03] child trying to put on the
[37:05] coat and how they struggle with the arm
[37:07] and say just this is what we do as
[37:09] Believers we say Lord you go ahead and
[37:10] do it and this is the only thing you
[37:12] have to do and so you should just go do
[37:15] it and you say well this sounds easy
[37:17] forgetting is very hard to forgive is
[37:20] human to forget is divine right often we
[37:23] say to a is human but even to forgive is
[37:26] something that we ought to do as humans
[37:28] it's God who says he can forget but yet
[37:30] this is something that we must try to
[37:32] practice is there some sort of
[37:34] forgetting or letting go of the past and
[37:36] then don't just let go of the past and
[37:38] just kind of sit there staring at it
[37:40] looking at it rehashing it he says
[37:45] walk live for the future in the glory
[37:48] and the presence of God this is what we
[37:50] can do when we've uh had these things in
[37:53] our past these circumstances and these
[37:55] difficulties and maybe we haven't
[37:56] started out right in our marriage maybe
[37:58] we haven't started outright in our
[37:59] families maybe it's too far gone for us
[38:01] to restore a marriage and and things
[38:03] have broken down but we say Lord from
[38:05] here on I know I can go forward and I
[38:07] can't keep looking back and dwell in the
[38:09] past I want to live for the future in
[38:10] the glory and the presence of God and
[38:12] I'll say this and believe under
[38:14] Supernatural expectation that great
[38:16] things are going to happen that all the
[38:19] promises of the fruits of the spirit are
[38:20] yours you can walk in joy you can walk
[38:22] in peace and that you can be used of God
[38:25] to do many exploits
[38:29] forget about all that's in the past walk
[38:31] live for the future in the glory and the
[38:33] presence of God Philippians chapter 3:
[38:36] 3- 14 says Brethren I count not myself
[38:38] to have apprehended Paul didn't count
[38:40] himself as being perfect then I'm not
[38:42] going to count myself as being perfect
[38:45] and he even goes so far as to say and
[38:46] those who are perfect still think this
[38:49] way still be thus minded but this one
[38:52] thing I do forgetting those things which
[38:54] were be which are behind and reaching
[38:56] forth under those things things which
[38:57] are before I press toward the mark for
[39:00] the prize of the High Calling of God in
[39:02] Christ Jesus so this is the one thing he
[39:05] did the one thing I do brother B says
[39:08] there's only one thing you have to do
[39:09] only thing you have to do is just go do
[39:11] it the only thing you have to do is
[39:14] forget all about the Past walk live for
[39:15] the future in the glory and the presence
[39:17] of God this is what Paul is saying this
[39:19] one thing he does it's I press toward
[39:22] the mark for the prize of the whole High
[39:24] Calling of God in Christ Jesus that's
[39:26] the one thing he does
[39:28] I press toward the mark That's the
[39:30] distant goal I press towards the mark
[39:32] there's something that it has in view
[39:34] the very word I think that is used H is
[39:36] even the Greek that we would use for
[39:38] scope he he scoped it out he zeroed in
[39:41] on he's bringing it into Focus it's in
[39:43] view it's his aim this one thing I've
[39:44] scoped it's this one thing that's a
[39:46] distant goal to me this is the one thing
[39:48] that I've set before me I'm pressing
[39:50] towards what I've set before me is the
[39:51] mark and I'm going to press towards that
[39:53] Mark but then he amplifies it that he
[39:56] could not accomplish that one thing
[39:58] unless he first forgot about the past
[40:01] and reached
[40:02] forward so this one thing I do I press
[40:05] towards the mark for the prize of the
[40:06] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and
[40:08] if I'm going to be able to do that I've
[40:09] got to forget the things which are
[40:11] behind and not making any qualifications
[40:13] He suggests that we're not just going to
[40:15] sit back in glory in the Glory Days I
[40:18] remember this and remember that and
[40:20] remember this and remember that past or
[40:21] good we got to keep our eyes forward
[40:24] focused on what God the in the presence
[40:26] of God now in the glory and presence of
[40:28] God now I'm going to live for the future
[40:30] walking forward I'm going to set this
[40:32] Mark before me for the prize of this
[40:34] High Calling and so I've got to forget
[40:36] the things which are behind and then I
[40:37] begin to reach forth to the things which
[40:39] are before me the promises of God the
[40:42] future The Joy which is set before us
[40:46] that's what we are to do we're to go
[40:48] forward so the preaching of the word if
[40:51] it's to if the preaching of the word
[40:53] would to bring up anything from our past
[40:56] then it's po it's it's possible that the
[40:58] word would do that so that you could
[40:59] make it right I forgot all about that I
[41:02] need to make that right you told a lie
[41:04] on somebody and maybe it's just last
[41:06] week you lied and the words being
[41:07] preached and you remember that lie you
[41:09] don't go forgetting those things which
[41:10] are behind forgetting those things which
[41:12] are behind I I press towards the mark
[41:14] now you'd say well you know what I need
[41:16] to make that right so there's times when
[41:18] the word of God preached actually deals
[41:21] with us in an emotional way to bring us
[41:23] to the place and God will use our
[41:25] emotions to be able to say I'm sorry
[41:27] to acknowledge certain failures
[41:29] acknowledge mistakes or or to make
[41:31] things right and so God will God will do
[41:33] that and then once once that that has
[41:35] been processed and once we go through
[41:37] that that dealing of the Holy Spirit
[41:39] they've got to go forward we can't
[41:40] wallow in that Misery we can't we can't
[41:43] a woe is me because I made this mistake
[41:45] let's go forward let's March forward
[41:46] this one thing I'm going to do forget
[41:48] the things which are behind me I'm going
[41:49] to take the momentum of the good and go
[41:51] forward and I'm going to take all the
[41:52] bad and bury it in the sea of God's
[41:54] forgetfulness I've been forgiven I'm
[41:56] putting it under the blood I'm going
[41:57] forward knowing that God's with
[42:01] me brother B says in the message Shalom
[42:04] we're not going to have a rearview
[42:06] mirror
[42:08] Affair I like that rearview mirror only
[42:11] looks back to see where you've been
[42:14] we're looking forward to see where we're
[42:16] going we don't want to have a rearview
[42:18] mirror
[42:20] Affair it it that that we can't always
[42:22] have that instinct to where we're always
[42:25] just kind of looking over our shoulder
[42:26] and always look back behind us and
[42:28] always wondering about the past and I I
[42:30] know what it's like to have a mind that
[42:31] just won't shut down you're constantly
[42:34] going back over things that are said
[42:35] things that are done and you'll go so
[42:37] far back in your past and all of a
[42:38] sudden you begin to experience the shame
[42:40] and the embarrassment of something you
[42:41] did 20 years before why you're mining
[42:44] for that you're going back searching it
[42:47] out you're thinking about you're oh this
[42:49] and that and this mistake and that
[42:50] mistake and before you know it you have
[42:52] this ability of resurrecting feelings
[42:53] you start feeling it all over again and
[42:56] so this can be something very difficult
[42:58] to stop the mind and and put it off but
[43:00] we need to be able to just rest in God
[43:02] and say Lord I can't keep looking back
[43:04] it only causes me anxiety it only causes
[43:06] me fear it only brings me down lord I
[43:08] want to start new in you I want to look
[43:10] forward not looking in the review mirror
[43:12] I want to look forward I know you've got
[43:14] great things for me I see you working in
[43:15] my life I see the hand of God in my life
[43:18] I see it in my marriage I see it in my
[43:19] family I see it in my church I hear it
[43:21] in the testimonies of the believer I
[43:22] want to look forward to see where we're
[43:24] going cuz if you look back you end up
[43:26] going back
[43:28] we got to go
[43:30] forward and I believe that we we should
[43:33] be
[43:34] positive and we should be forward
[43:36] looking for ourselves and
[43:38] others and I I I I could say it this way
[43:44] it's easier to believe for
[43:46] others we could be going through
[43:48] difficulty and be burdened and be
[43:50] anxious and really suffering from trial
[43:52] and somebody visit the church and say
[43:54] I'm just going through the worst time of
[43:55] my life I'm just despairing from life
[43:57] you're listen God's with you he's for
[43:59] you you don't doubt you just go forward
[44:02] he's going to do great things for you
[44:03] you know what you should do you should
[44:04] just take all that sorrow and just put
[44:06] it behind you the joy of the Lord is
[44:08] your strength and you could just really
[44:09] witness to them and encourage them and
[44:10] they just kind of take you at your word
[44:13] and just believe and they just go
[44:14] forward enjy and you walk away and
[44:16] someone says how you doing brother I'm
[44:17] just really going through
[44:19] it right because it's it's easier to
[44:22] believe for somebody or at least it's
[44:23] easier to tell somebody else what to
[44:25] do and
[44:27] and though that's true I I think we
[44:30] should be positive for ourselves forward
[44:33] looking for ourselves in other words not
[44:34] a riew m fair but looking to where we're
[44:36] going what God is doing the great things
[44:37] he has in store for us but do it not
[44:39] only just for ourselves and for members
[44:41] of our family and those we have
[44:43] relationships with but for the others
[44:44] that God wants to bring in our midst God
[44:47] is has brought together a group of
[44:49] people that he wants to use to minister
[44:51] to others to to be there as a strength
[44:53] to those that need ministering who need
[44:55] support who need friendships you need a
[44:57] family because they otherwise don't have
[44:58] one we can become that family and we
[45:00] want to believe for them we want to be
[45:03] positive and someone comes say well
[45:05] where are you from well I'm I'm from
[45:07] Peoria oh that's great that's wonderful
[45:08] what part I'm from there you say so do
[45:10] you have a job yeah I've got a job so
[45:11] tell me a little bit about yourself and
[45:13] they start they said we're so glad
[45:14] you're here just God's really moving and
[45:16] and we really believing and we just
[45:18] begin to testify and they said well so
[45:19] tell me about yourself and they start
[45:20] telling their story and you start
[45:22] going um you know there's other churches
[45:25] um I mean well that's a that's a pretty
[45:28] difficult case I think I might have
[45:30] mentioned it over the pulp recent where
[45:32] that one Minister that someone came up
[45:33] and really had a demon they said call
[45:35] the authorities this person really does
[45:37] have a demon all a sudden we just I
[45:39] don't know if God can help you man I
[45:41] don't know that's that's a really rough
[45:42] situation we want to have faith for
[45:44] those who need God to intervene for
[45:50] them I I just let me read this statement
[45:52] this is a very lengthy but I just I want
[45:55] to share this so our faith could be
[45:58] raised I think we're doing okay on time
[46:01] I just had a couple statements to read
[46:02] before I closed I hope this doesn't
[46:04] interrupt the flow here brother R's in a
[46:06] prayer line says how do you do young man
[46:08] do you believe me to be the servant of
[46:09] God I don't have the uh this on the
[46:11] slides many other servants are here but
[46:13] I'm his servant immediately there's a
[46:16] spirit pulling from this young man this
[46:18] boy is in trouble he's deeply in trouble
[46:21] this boy is suffering from a mental
[46:22] disorder you just come from an
[46:24] institution I see them giving you it's
[46:26] it's a shock treatment they give you
[46:27] shock treatments and you have a an a
[46:29] phobia that is you you see a face before
[46:32] you all the time and it's your mother's
[46:34] face that you see this is very
[46:37] interesting uh something that he's going
[46:39] through something he's
[46:40] suffered uh maybe even in his familyes
[46:44] he says it's his mother's face that's
[46:45] before him he says you're a married man
[46:47] you have a wife and two children Jesus
[46:50] Christ that come along and delivered the
[46:52] man of gdor is here tonight to deliver
[46:54] you from this and take that phobia from
[46:56] from you and drive the devil devil from
[46:58] you that you can return to your home
[47:01] well this is somebody who for whatever
[47:04] reason had a mental disorder the fact
[47:07] that he brings his mother into this
[47:08] something maybe he's had through his
[47:10] lifetime it's the phobia he says now I
[47:12] want to pray that this would drive this
[47:14] from you do you believe that do you
[47:15] believe that he sent me to do this for
[47:16] you would you bow your heads and be
[47:18] reverent this is very treacherous and
[47:19] dangerous keep your head bowed till you
[47:21] hear my voice say raise your head come
[47:23] here young man before I ask this
[47:24] blessing I'm going to ask you something
[47:26] will you obey as his servant and do as I
[47:28] tell you to do you're going to get well
[47:31] the time of Deliverance is at hand this
[47:33] is a devil doing this young
[47:35] man he would drive you Stark mad keep
[47:39] you that way the rest of your life but
[47:42] God can restore you in your right mind
[47:44] and right mental conditions I see
[47:46] another thing you've been to
[47:47] psychiatrist somebody tried to talk to
[47:49] you but that's the I that's not the idea
[47:51] it takes more than that for you it takes
[47:53] the power of the Living God you
[47:55] understand me if you don't you will in a
[47:56] moment moment bow your head in reverence
[47:58] believe that God raised up his son Jesus
[48:00] to deliver you and listen to this prayer
[48:02] Heavenly Father this young man standing
[48:04] here fine looking young fellow standing
[48:06] here in the stature of Young Manhood and
[48:08] Satan has come to tear up his home break
[48:11] up his family and drive this young man
[48:14] out into the Wilds but oh God now think
[48:17] about what that home life must have been
[48:19] like mental disorder phobia and shock
[48:23] treatments and Mental Hospitals and
[48:25] psychiatrist but oh God who made the
[48:27] heavens and the Earth who created all
[48:29] things through Jesus Christ I come as
[48:31] your servant in prayer of faith for this
[48:33] young man knowing that just now he can't
[48:36] have faith for himself because of his
[48:39] conditions wow that's
[48:43] remarkable that's remarkable so then I
[48:45] and this this gives me this I believe
[48:48] this gives us charge as Believers that
[48:50] there can be times in our lives where we
[48:52] need to have faith for those who can't
[48:54] have
[48:55] it these difficult situation these dark
[48:58] situations these times of Despair where
[49:00] it's so easy for us to get judgmental
[49:02] and get condescending and lose our
[49:04] patience and have no Grace but think
[49:06] Lord can I have the faith for this
[49:08] person right now because they don't seem
[49:10] to have enough
[49:12] Faith Lord hear the prayer of your
[49:14] servant and Satan is haunting at him and
[49:17] making him his life a misery but the
[49:19] Lord Jesus that set the maniac free that
[49:22] was Far Beyond this boy you can make
[49:24] this boy well tonight and Satan you who
[49:26] bound him you've escaped the
[49:28] psychiatrist you've escaped the Medical
[49:30] Treatments but you can't escape the
[49:32] power of God Amen Hallelujah they can
[49:34] escape a lot of different things but
[49:36] they can't escape the power of God come
[49:38] out of him in the name of Jesus Christ
[49:40] go for him go from him young man look
[49:43] here now it's over you're healed now he

[49:54] your hands and give him thanks for your
[49:55] healing you feel all right now don't you

[50:03] heaven knows I'm not a fanatic I'll be
[50:05] judged at the day of judgment the thing
[50:06] whed away passed out of the boy going in
[50:08] that direction it even felt like a wind
[50:10] going that way when it left him the evil
[50:13] Powers left the boy go get to your wife
[50:15] and family and rejoice and be happy
[50:18] rejoice in the
[50:20] Lord live like a real Christian go give
[50:23] him praise and sing praises day and
[50:24] night I want to have this kind of faith
[50:28] for myself and for others for those who
[50:31] may not have it because that's what God
[50:33] positions maybe a lot of this is uh I
[50:36] found it just being an extension of the
[50:38] question we asked ourselves who is my
[50:40] neighbor to believe all things are
[50:43] possible with men this is impossible but
[50:45] With God all things are
[50:47] possible and where someone's Faith may
[50:50] not be able to believe may we create the
[50:53] kind of atmosphere to loose their faith
[50:56] we're in a family situation where the
[50:58] wife is uncertain and the kids begin to
[50:59] get a little bit nervous Lord let me
[51:01] have the faith to believe when they
[51:03] can't do
[51:04] it looking forward to see where we're
[51:07] going having a positive Faith being
[51:08] forward looking for our families for
[51:10] ourselves and for others what is it it's
[51:12] it's having a faith that he's working
[51:15] all things for the
[51:17] good now this statement I want to read
[51:19] from why Christ speak I think you're
[51:22] mature enough to be able to do this he's
[51:24] using the very specific example but I
[51:26] want you to be able to identify these
[51:28] mechanisms that brother R refers to in
[51:30] lot and even Moses and how that we may
[51:33] not be in the exact situation that lot's
[51:35] in and using the same kind of viewpoint
[51:39] to hinder our faith but I want you to
[51:41] look in the sense of what the image we
[51:42] put before us the things we idolize the
[51:44] things that we desire to achieve the
[51:46] filter we have the image we have or even
[51:48] the things that we idolize how it all
[51:50] gets us off the wrong track and it
[51:51] doesn't feed our faith doesn't help us
[51:54] go forward but it holds us back or even
[51:55] causes us to fall fall back he says now
[51:58] we find out that Moses's Faith led him
[52:00] to watch what would be not what
[52:03] was that's the faith the that that I
[52:06] want to have I want to have the faith
[52:08] that leads me to believe what will be
[52:11] not what's
[52:12] been I don't even need Faith to know
[52:14] what I've done I don't need Faith to
[52:17] know that I've made mistakes I don't
[52:18] need Faith to know that I I I backslid I
[52:20] don't need Faith to know that I I was
[52:22] raised in the message and I took seems
[52:24] like I wasted a lot of wonderful
[52:25] opportunities I don't need Faith to
[52:27] believe that I just need a memory amen
[52:30] and he's saying now this he had the F he
[52:32] had the kind of faith that led him to
[52:35] watch what would be and not watch what
[52:38] was but he says look at tomorrow instead
[52:41] of today guess there's not supposed to
[52:43] be a butt there so look at tomorrow
[52:46] instead of today look at the promise
[52:48] instead of the
[52:49] glamour I thought that was very unique
[52:53] so you're looking at tomorrow instead of
[52:55] today you're looking at the future
[52:56] future instead of yesterday then he says
[52:58] look at the promise instead of the
[53:00] glamour some kind of idea something be
[53:02] presented to you something some kind of
[53:04] fantastic that would distract you he
[53:06] says look at the people instead of the
[53:08] organization God did that and now he
[53:11] uses lot as a contrast to
[53:14] Moses he says lot could see the glamour
[53:17] of prosperity down in
[53:19] Sodom now let's use that as a mechanism
[53:22] where we ought to not look at what has
[53:25] been and even what is but have a faith
[53:27] that leads us to watch what will be
[53:29] according to a promise we're living for
[53:31] the future as brother says we're looking
[53:32] forward to see where we're going says
[53:34] let's forget about the past walk live
[53:36] for the future and the glory and
[53:37] presence of God that's what we're
[53:39] supposed to do but now we can see the
[53:41] glamour of something
[53:43] else some other image some other
[53:45] filtered picture where we we're not
[53:47] really seeing if you want you see the
[53:48] glamour of Sodom but if it's filter to
[53:51] you don't look at all the bad things
[53:52] that come with it lot could see the
[53:54] possibilities of a lot of money it's the
[53:57] pretense it's the prestige it it's the
[53:59] it's the visual Perfection lot could see
[54:01] the possibilities when he looked over to
[54:03] Sodom and he could maybe become being
[54:05] that he was a Hebrew he might become a
[54:06] great man there because he was a great
[54:08] intellectual figure and the nephew of
[54:10] Abraham so he chose to go towards Sodom
[54:12] lot's intellects led him to see the
[54:15] glamour of prosperity lot's intellects
[54:17] led him to see the blessing of
[54:19] Glamour now as I'm challenging you to
[54:23] have no filter a true family with no fil
[54:26] filter and to not filter the word of God
[54:28] with our intellects with our thought
[54:30] processes with our imagination and our
[54:32] affections and our reasons and those
[54:33] things we want to take the word of God
[54:35] as it's taught and see it for what God
[54:37] wants to do yield ourselves to say Lord
[54:39] you produce the image of what this seed
[54:41] is to produce and not put pressure on
[54:44] ourselves to conform to a particular
[54:45] idea and and be a a cookie cutter family
[54:48] and try to get everybody to eat at the
[54:50] same place I'm realizing Ros is becoming
[54:52] very popular because I keep mentioning
[54:54] it but we're not trying to drive
[54:55] everybody like battle to all conform and
[54:57] be the same way and drive the same car
[54:59] and do the same thing with their kids
[55:00] but we want to be what God's called us
[55:02] to
[55:03] be and avoid these biases where lot saw
[55:07] his intellect led him to see the glamour
[55:09] of prosperity his intellect led him to
[55:11] see the blessings of Glamour so there's
[55:13] a drawing power of these filters a
[55:15] drawing power of these images that are
[55:17] all carnal he says but his faith was
[55:19] paralyzed by
[55:21] it but his faith was so paralyzed by it
[55:24] he didn't see the fire that was going to
[55:26] destroy that sort of life and that's the
[55:29] way the people are today they see the
[55:31] possibilities of belonging to a great
[55:32] organization it it's achieve a social
[55:34] standing my role socially within a
[55:37] particular social dynamic or Social
[55:39] Circle let's not measure ourselves by
[55:41] that whatever we do let's not just
[55:43] become
[55:44] that and see the possibilities of having
[55:47] social standing with the people of the
[55:49] city but they don't see their faith is
[55:52] paralyzed let me repeat that so it won't
[55:54] be misunderstood in other words when you
[55:56] get your eyes on the wrong thing the
[55:58] glamour you get the P the the wrong kind
[56:00] of picture being painted that kind of
[56:03] expectation that kind of ambition will
[56:06] paralyze your faith so he says women
[56:09] today they want to act like the movie
[56:10] stars the men today they want to act
[56:12] like the television
[56:14] comedians now let's just put it within
[56:17] uh the context today what it is it's the
[56:20] influencers the Instagram Stars the Tik
[56:23] Tok Stars the the YouTube celebrities
[56:25] those are the things that we can I the
[56:27] movie stars the social media Stars men
[56:30] today want to act like the television
[56:32] comedians they say television comedians
[56:34] we don't have a TV okay you want to act
[56:36] like Dude
[56:37] Perfect all right come on somebody can I
[56:41] get an
[56:43] amen there's things you begin to idolize
[56:45] there's certain things you begin to want
[56:46] to pursue things you want to do and
[56:48] brother bam says they paralyze the
[56:50] little faith that they did have by
[56:52] putting your eyes on the wrong things by
[56:54] glamorizing the wrong image he says it
[56:56] can't can't work said now Moses give
[56:58] away to that what did Moses do he led
[57:00] him to watch what will be not what had
[57:02] been not where he was Moses gave way to
[57:04] that and his faith paralyzed the
[57:07] world did you catch that others the
[57:10] world paralyzes their faith but Moses
[57:12] had an ambition who for knowing that
[57:16] this was a reproachful thing but he knew
[57:18] there was a reward knowing the riches of
[57:20] Christ were greater than all the things
[57:21] had to offer the world had to offer he
[57:23] could set his eyes on the future not
[57:25] worried about his past and he could look
[57:27] forward to the things which were before
[57:28] him so he gave away to the things of the
[57:31] world the Glamour the intellects the
[57:32] filters all the things that tried to
[57:34] paint this pretty picture to get you to
[57:35] run after it and his faith paralyzed the
[57:39] world either your faith will paralyze
[57:41] glamour or either the glamour will
[57:43] paralyze your faith you have to take one
[57:46] or the
[57:47] other I believe we ought to have the
[57:49] kind of faith that paralyzes the
[57:51] glamour that when the wrong image is
[57:53] being set before us we have the kind of
[57:55] Faith to believe when the devil says
[57:56] well if you're not this if you can't be
[57:58] this you can't be anything say I believe
[57:59] in a God who can I believe in a God who
[58:03] that may not be what I'm called to do in
[58:04] this life we're taught time and time
[58:07] again even with respect to Ministries
[58:09] that you may never go overseas and
[58:11] preach you may never Lay Your Hands on
[58:13] the sick brother man talks about and
[58:14] feel that charge of God raise a dead
[58:16] person up or heal somebody's limb but we
[58:18] all have a part to
[58:20] play and we can't make the mistake of
[58:22] elevating certain manifestations and
[58:24] certain gifts and certain H mannerisms
[58:27] as being more Dynamic and more powerful
[58:29] and more necessary than others we're all
[58:33] working together we all have a hike that
[58:35] we need to hike we all have a role that
[58:36] we need to play we all have a life that
[58:38] we need to live and I want to walk in
[58:40] the path that he's called me to walk in
[58:41] I want to Ho the road that he's asked me
[58:43] to hoe if he wants me to plant potatoes
[58:46] I want to plant my potatoes if he wants
[58:48] me to build a house I want to build a
[58:49] house I want to live the life do what
[58:51] he's called me to do and have the kind
[58:53] of faith that paralyzes the wrong filter
[58:56] that that puts puts away and pushes away
[58:58] all the wrong kind of ideas that try to
[59:00] make me feel condemned and make me feel
[59:01] unworthy or make me uh just cause me to
[59:04] like I don't feel like I can go forward
[59:05] anymore let my faith paralyze the
[59:07] glamour I love how he says his faith
[59:10] paralyzed the
[59:12] world that's what I want just a faith
[59:17] taser now the world just comes at
[59:20] me the world just drops doubt unbelief
[59:23] fear drama just have the kind of faith
[59:26] that just puts it at Bay he says it's
[59:28] either going to paralyze your faith or
[59:29] you're going to paralyze it well I'm
[59:31] just going to choose to have paralyzing
[59:33] Faith a faith that
[59:35] paralyzes I don't want my faith to be in
[59:37] a
[59:39] wheelchair I believe this faith is
[59:41] strong it's got
[59:43] muscles invite the musicians to come
[59:58] why we just stand to our
[1:00:05] feet as I was um pondering these things
[1:00:10] today that song The Winds of Faith came
[1:00:12] on my
[1:00:13] heart and that's what we can
[1:00:15] do we can just set our wings to The
[1:00:18] Winds of
[1:00:20] faith and he said Lord I I could choose
[1:00:22] now brother man says you could choose
[1:00:24] two different ways you can either have
[1:00:25] your faith paralyzed or your faith can
[1:00:28] paralyze the world say Lord I'm going to
[1:00:29] choose the one by faith I'm going to
[1:00:31] choose a pathway that believes for the
[1:00:34] impossible I'm going to choose a pathway
[1:00:37] that listen let's just be honest
[1:00:39] regardless of what it holds there's joy
[1:00:41] in
[1:00:42] it regards to what the circumstances may
[1:00:44] be there's peace I'm going to commit to
[1:00:47] that that's what I'm going to believe
[1:00:49] for and I realize and I've been very
[1:00:52] disappointed with myself over even over
[1:00:54] the last few years
[1:00:56] where there's still anxiety and there's
[1:00:57] still pain there's still bitterness
[1:00:59] despite all the the promises you believe
[1:01:01] in the things you even
[1:01:03] preach yet you fret over hurts and you
[1:01:06] fret over estrangement you fret over
[1:01:08] difficulty you fret over uh things that
[1:01:10] are said and done and and it's a you
[1:01:13] believe those things have happened you
[1:01:15] believe they're wrong and you couldn't
[1:01:16] be moved from it but what you really
[1:01:17] need to do is take your
[1:01:19] faith that so perfectly can explain
[1:01:22] what's happened and how it's really
[1:01:23] wrong but take some of that same
[1:01:25] conviction and faith and believe that
[1:01:26] God you can turn things around for the
[1:01:29] better that even this Lord I believe in
[1:01:32] this there's good and then I want to
[1:01:34] take my faith and put it out before me
[1:01:36] and live for the future forget all about
[1:01:38] the Past walk live for the future but
[1:01:40] you're going to lose this you're going
[1:01:41] to lose that you can't have this you
[1:01:42] can't have that you should have invested
[1:01:44] in Bitcoin when you had the opportunity
[1:01:45] a few years ago I'm not worried about it
[1:01:48] anymore you should have waited to sell
[1:01:50] your house you should have taken that
[1:01:51] opportunity you should have done this
[1:01:53] hey those things are in the past I can't
[1:01:55] change them that's right I'm not going
[1:01:57] to spend my time wondering if there
[1:01:59] really is a time machine I'm not going
[1:02:01] to spend my time wondering well maybe if
[1:02:02] I get in now and say Lord I'm just going
[1:02:04] to yield to
[1:02:06] you if I missed it then and I was
[1:02:08] supposed to do it it would have only
[1:02:10] been because I wasn't fully
[1:02:12] surrendered so Lord I don't want to make
[1:02:14] the mistake now of not fully
[1:02:18] surrendering I so brother Brandon makes
[1:02:20] this statement in the message of super
[1:02:24] sign and I I was reading around this at
[1:02:27] the end of the year last year and up to
[1:02:29] our watch Night
[1:02:31] Service and he makes mention in this
[1:02:33] month prior or during that same month
[1:02:36] different things as dedications and
[1:02:37] things is very
[1:02:39] extraordinary and this is I I read this
[1:02:41] now before we go to prayer because you
[1:02:43] we're just saying I'm going to start
[1:02:44] right now from this moment
[1:02:46] on I'm going to put this the the word
[1:02:49] before me and by faith I'm going to walk
[1:02:51] towards
[1:02:52] it forget all that's behind me live for
[1:02:54] the Future walk walk in the glory and
[1:02:56] presence of God this is what I'm going
[1:02:57] to do then I think we can just
[1:02:59] consecrate ourselves tonight make a new
[1:03:02] dedication he says after I made a new
[1:03:05] dedication my own self and my wife so
[1:03:08] this is this is instructive to US
[1:03:10] December 27th 1959 I've made a new
[1:03:13] dedication of myself my wife and I we've
[1:03:15] rededicated ourselves we've noticed
[1:03:17] things so different around
[1:03:19] home just a
[1:03:22] rededication a reconsecration can make
[1:03:24] things different at home now I hope you
[1:03:26] can really let these words sink in not
[1:03:28] as nervous as we were shaky and jumpy
[1:03:32] you know how you're just on
[1:03:34] edge and you don't have the patience you
[1:03:36] should have with children who are just
[1:03:38] being innocent they're just being
[1:03:39] inquisitive that they really need
[1:03:42] something you're the one that has the
[1:03:44] answer you've always told them if you
[1:03:45] ever need this come talk to me and then
[1:03:47] the moment they do it's like I'm
[1:03:49] busy like oh you had just told me if I
[1:03:52] ever really needed you wa you're jumpy
[1:03:55] you're shaky he says we won't get this
[1:03:58] we won't get that goes we just go at it
[1:04:01] just quietly and get more done he says
[1:04:05] just yield yourself to him walk on with
[1:04:07] the perfect satisfied Faith just yield
[1:04:09] yourself to God and walk with him
[1:04:10] peaceful quiet not interrupted this is
[1:04:13] what you can do when you make a new
[1:04:15] dedication you're less shaky and jumpy
[1:04:17] we won't get this we won't get that we
[1:04:19] just go at it just quietly and get more
[1:04:22] done so now there's a coming new year
[1:04:25] and we don't believe in turning new
[1:04:27] pages and how is this relevant yet we're
[1:04:29] here at the beginning of a new year
[1:04:30] we're also looking at something we want
[1:04:32] to go forward in the word of God our
[1:04:33] past calls to us as a a hindering Force
[1:04:37] to keep us looking back and looking back
[1:04:39] he says we don't believe in turning new
[1:04:41] pages we just believe in burning the
[1:04:44] old I'm just going to drop kick the old
[1:04:47] book Into the Fire today just put it in
[1:04:51] the fire so just keep yourself
[1:04:53] consecrated to God through the coming
[1:04:56] year that's all that we can do so let's
[1:04:58] do this together as a body of Christ

[1:05:02] dedication we have we have uh dedicated
[1:05:06] ourselves
[1:05:07] individually we don't have a we've
[1:05:09] dedicated this place of
[1:05:11] worship and we could say that there's
[1:05:13] church dedications and moments where we
[1:05:15] rededicate ourselves but let's make a
[1:05:17] new dedication of ourselves individually
[1:05:20] tonight let's make a dedication as a
[1:05:22] body of Believers that we're going to go
[1:05:24] forward without filters

[1:05:28] without pretense go forward without
[1:05:31] without
