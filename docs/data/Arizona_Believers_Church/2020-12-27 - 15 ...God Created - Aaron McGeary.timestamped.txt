[1:54] while we're standing i'd like to read
[1:56] from hebrews chapter 1
[1:59] hebrews chapter 1 verses 1 to 13.
[2:03] and take just a little bit of a lengthy
[2:06] scripture reading here at the outset and
[2:08] in doing so
[2:11] mention some things that we won't come
[2:13] back to but yet it just
[2:14] it seems to capture just a full picture
[2:18] of jesus christ
[2:19] and some points that we want to visit
[2:23] this morning
[2:24] hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 to 13.
[2:29] happy belated christmas for those who
[2:31] might have missed christmas greetings
[2:33] and we're glad to see many at the hou in
[2:35] the house of the lord some who haven't
[2:36] been here in a while so we welcome you
[2:38] back
[2:38] uh so happy to see you i know that
[2:40] there's some that are traveling that are
[2:42] away several that aren't here this
[2:43] morning
[2:44] many that are streaming we trust that
[2:46] god would be with them and
[2:47] protect them and keep them safe as they
[2:49] travel happy new years to you if we
[2:51] don't see you this thursday
[2:53] instead of having a wednesday service
[2:54] we're having a watch night service
[2:56] on this thursday so we're moving
[2:57] wednesday to thursday if enough of you
[3:00] want a wednesday service we could still
[3:01] do that but we thought it might just be
[3:03] nice to move wednesday
[3:04] to thursday and have a watch night
[3:05] service at 10 o'clock here
[3:07] and uh we don't really have a program or
[3:10] anything we're just going to
[3:11] watch that night and so we're you're
[3:13] welcome to come but if you're not able
[3:14] to make it we say happy new year to you
[3:17] and we're looking forward to what god
[3:18] has in 2021
[3:20] not just because we're leaving uh 2020
[3:23] behind i mean just
[3:24] i saw somebody posted something that
[3:26] said just wait till 2020 turns 21.
[3:30] oh oh what do we have what do we have in
[3:31] store for us once it turns 21 but we
[3:34] just believe god
[3:35] has something great in store for us in
[3:37] the coming year i think it would be
[3:38] wonderful of what we
[3:39] what we have in 2021 as a meeting in the
[3:41] air amen could we all agree
[3:44] new bodies we're all 18 to 21 years old
[3:47] i think it would be wonderful the
[3:48] eternal youth meeting would be kicked
[3:50] off with the meeting in the air
[3:52] that's what i'm looking forward to
[3:54] hebrews chapter
[3:56] 1 verses 1 to 13 god who at sundry times
[3:59] and in diverse manners spake in time
[4:01] past unto the fathers by the prophets
[4:04] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[4:06] by his son
[4:07] whom he hath appointed heir of all
[4:09] things by whom also
[4:11] he made the worlds who being the
[4:14] brightness of his glory
[4:15] and the expressed image of his person
[4:18] and upholding all things by the word of
[4:20] his power
[4:21] when he had by himself purged our sins
[4:23] sat down on the right hand of the
[4:25] majesty on high
[4:27] being made so much better than the
[4:29] angels
[4:30] as he hath by inheritance obtained a
[4:33] more excellent name
[4:34] than they for unto which of the angels
[4:37] said he at any time thou art my son so
[4:40] this is he's asking kind of the record
[4:42] rhetorical question at what time is he
[4:44] asking told an angel or said an angel
[4:45] thou art my son
[4:47] this day have i begotten thee and again
[4:49] i will be to him a father and he shall
[4:51] be to me a son
[4:52] and again when he bringeth in the first
[4:54] begotten into the world he saith
[4:56] and let all the angels of god worship
[4:58] him and of the angels he saith who
[5:00] maketh his angels spirits
[5:01] and his ministers a flame of fire but
[5:04] under the sun he saith thy throne o god
[5:07] is forever and ever a scepter of
[5:09] righteousness is the scepter of thy
[5:11] kingdom
[5:12] thou hast loved righteousness and hated
[5:14] iniquity
[5:15] therefore god even thy god hath
[5:18] appointed the anointed thee with the oil
[5:20] of gladness above thy fellows
[5:22] and thou lord in the beginning has laid
[5:25] the foundation of the earth and the
[5:26] heavens are the works of thine hands
[5:29] they shall perish but thou remainest and
[5:32] they all shall wax old as death the
[5:33] garment
[5:34] and as a vestureth shalt thou fold them
[5:36] up and they shall be chained they shall
[5:38] be changed so he's speaking of even the
[5:40] changing of the heavens and the earth
[5:41] but thou art the same and thy years
[5:43] shall not fail
[5:45] but to which of the angels saith he at
[5:47] any time
[5:48] sit on my right hand until i make thine
[5:50] enemies
[5:51] thy footstool oh my what remarkable
[5:54] words paul is using
[5:56] to the hebrews to get them to thinking
[5:58] about who this christ is
[6:00] so desire god would bless these
[6:01] scriptures that we've read
[6:03] you may be seated we continue on the
[6:07] subject of god created
[6:09] and i realize um i get
[6:12] as the as i'm looking into these things
[6:15] and studying them
[6:16] they can just seem very very fresh
[6:18] because they're newly inspired and
[6:20] recently inspired
[6:22] and the whole subject to me can seem
[6:25] as if it's new inspiration and we're
[6:27] looking at something
[6:28] new for the first time and then i kind
[6:30] of take a step back and i begin to look
[6:32] at a few things and i realized well
[6:34] uh we've been ministering on this
[6:36] subject uh
[6:37] and vain staying very tight to certain
[6:39] scriptures in the beginning of the
[6:41] of the bible in genesis chapter one uh
[6:43] through even chapter four
[6:45] some very consistent themes that we've
[6:46] been looking at and so this morning i
[6:49] realized well
[6:50] i'm repeating and probably revisiting a
[6:52] lot of familiar themes
[6:54] even scriptures and quotations and this
[6:57] morning i want to
[6:58] revisit specifically some principles
[7:00] from a couple of earlier parts and
[7:03] um i can't recall just offhand where
[7:05] there was a couple things that we
[7:07] uh mentioned and didn't go into great
[7:09] detail on but i felt just to continue on
[7:11] where we were last time um and then go
[7:14] back and pick up just a couple
[7:15] scriptures and maybe some statements we
[7:17] had used
[7:17] a couple months ago and a few services
[7:19] ago
[7:20] and revisit them in greater detail and
[7:23] in doing so my burden
[7:25] is that we would see christ would come
[7:28] into plainer view
[7:30] i believe we're all looking at him and
[7:32] he's becoming sweeter to us he's
[7:33] becoming more real
[7:35] but we realize that there's still
[7:36] greater clarity and a more perfect
[7:38] understanding that we can have of christ
[7:40] and that would be my desire in
[7:42] ministering
[7:44] i i believe that one of the uh greatest
[7:46] things that could happen as we listen to
[7:48] the word is we
[7:49] fall in love with christ all over again
[7:51] um that there's something rekindled and
[7:53] something fresh that's inspired inside
[7:55] of us so
[7:56] we'd want christ to come into plainer
[7:58] view and also
[8:00] my burden is that and in revisiting some
[8:02] of these things
[8:04] and it's not going to be don't kind of
[8:05] brace yourself for just a repeat
[8:07] uh but in revisiting some particular
[8:10] things and emphasizing
[8:11] things again the burden is that you it
[8:14] would be able to become
[8:15] more personal and maybe for some of us
[8:17] for the first time personal
[8:19] that the word would become very personal
[8:21] to us or more personal
[8:23] and i pondered this and i realized it's
[8:25] easy and i think we could all agree it's
[8:27] very easy
[8:28] to read the bible to this to listen to
[8:31] the prophet preach these things
[8:32] and teach these things about the bride
[8:34] and it's very easy to believe it about
[8:36] the bride
[8:38] they say yes that's we believe that we
[8:39] believe that but it's
[8:41] it's important that you believe it about
[8:43] yourself
[8:44] there's no bride without you i'm not
[8:47] talking about how you spell it i'm just
[8:48] saying there's no
[8:49] you maybe you could look and say there's
[8:50] no bride without i
[8:52] right there's an eye in bride there's
[8:54] got to be
[8:55] really for to mean something to you uh
[8:58] you want to catch the personal
[8:59] revelation that you the eye is in the
[9:01] middle of this bride that you're part of
[9:02] it
[9:03] and because i find that we can often
[9:06] times you find out somebody's sick you
[9:07] know you know what i just believe god
[9:09] can heal you
[9:10] and i believe you're going to be made
[9:11] well and we can believe for somebody
[9:12] else but then when it's our own
[9:14] difficulty our own trial
[9:15] try to place ourselves in the promise
[9:17] it's a little bit more difficult
[9:19] and it's so important not that you just
[9:21] believe these things are true about the
[9:23] bride
[9:23] but that you believe them about yourself
[9:26] that you are a part of this and
[9:28] and not believing about this person or
[9:29] that person
[9:31] but rather you see yourself being
[9:33] positionally placed within the body of
[9:35] christ
[9:36] you recognize that the work of god is
[9:38] for you personally
[9:39] that he which have begun this work it's
[9:41] a work he's begun in you
[9:43] when you begin to think about in the
[9:44] beginning god created it's something
[9:47] he had thoughts about you not about this
[9:49] just this bride and we're like oh the
[9:51] bride is fantastic the bride is
[9:53] marvelous the bride is sinless the bride
[9:54] is perfect
[9:55] the bride will never fall and the bride
[9:57] is justified and the bride is going to
[9:59] conquer every sin and the brian has
[10:01] perfect faith
[10:02] and then you're not part of it
[10:06] listen a perfect bride cannot be made up
[10:08] of imperfect members
[10:09] you can't have a bride with perfect
[10:11] faith and then all of us just kind of
[10:13] kind of luke warm no whatever speaks of
[10:16] the bride speaks of you individually
[10:17] you've got to believe it for yourself
[10:20] and so that's my real uh real the real
[10:22] burden that's being placed upon my heart
[10:24] and revisiting some of this
[10:25] is not to look at it so much from the
[10:28] the standpoint of the bride
[10:30] but for christ to come into plainer view
[10:32] and as he comes into plain of you
[10:33] you recognize your position in christ
[10:36] now
[10:37] let's look at revelations chapter 3
[10:39] verse 14
[10:41] as we just took a few moments there to
[10:44] kind of set the foundation in
[10:46] revelations chapter 3 verse 14
[10:49] i'm picking up with the thought we were
[10:50] looking at last time about jesus christ
[10:52] being the beginning of the creation of
[10:54] god
[10:54] and then i'm going to use a few uh new
[10:57] quotations and maybe
[10:58] and then a couple familiar ones or at
[11:00] least one that we used before
[11:01] just to see how brother branham
[11:03] identified who the beginning of the
[11:04] creation of god was
[11:06] he says and under the angel of the
[11:07] church of the laodiceans
[11:09] right now this is the address to the
[11:11] seventh church age
[11:13] and what he's about to say is remarkable
[11:15] because now that he's speaking to the
[11:17] last
[11:17] church age he's going to signify the end
[11:20] of the ages
[11:21] and how the god's ultimate purpose and
[11:23] his cr
[11:24] and what he was desiring to do is going
[11:26] to be finished at the end of the seventh
[11:28] church age
[11:29] she says under the angel of the uh of
[11:31] the church of the laodiceans right these
[11:33] things say
[11:34] the amen which is the last now it's the
[11:36] finishing
[11:37] the faithful and true witness the
[11:40] beginning
[11:41] of the creation of god so by bringing in
[11:44] this phrase the beginning of the
[11:45] creation of god it does he's not
[11:47] referred to this
[11:48] uh in these addressed to the churches
[11:50] until the last age
[11:52] and it's signaling that now what god has
[11:55] begun is going to be finished
[11:57] we're nearing the end now with the very
[11:59] purpose of god it with creation
[12:01] and brother branham makes this statement
[12:04] referring to this scripture
[12:06] in the future home he says the holy
[12:07] blood that was created by god
[12:10] the blood the life the creation of god
[12:13] jesus was the beginning of the creation
[12:16] of god
[12:18] so when god began to form within the
[12:20] womb of mary
[12:21] jesus christ the body of jesus christ
[12:24] this was not gentile blood it was not
[12:26] joseph's blood it wasn't mary's blood
[12:28] he didn't use any elements of the flesh
[12:31] of man of any kind
[12:32] but god began to form within the womb of
[12:35] mary a son which was going to have the
[12:38] blood of god the dna of god
[12:41] he was deity from birth amen why because
[12:44] god took the word and began to form
[12:46] within the womb of a virgin
[12:48] flesh and it's genesis i mean i just
[12:50] wonder if they could take a dna test
[12:52] they look and go well this is different
[12:55] because it was not it wouldn't have bore
[12:57] any resemblance to
[12:58] some other markers that humans would
[13:00] have had but yet it was something that
[13:02] god was creating it was divine it was
[13:04] deity
[13:05] being formed within the womb of a virgin
[13:08] so the holy blood that was created by
[13:10] god
[13:11] and brother brahman says does this begin
[13:13] to form jesus is the beginning of the
[13:15] creation of god
[13:16] and he says god made in creation
[13:19] he was spirit the bible said he is the
[13:22] beginning of the creation of god
[13:23] how did he begin in the womb of a woman
[13:27] so that this is looking at a very
[13:30] specific
[13:31] expression of god's creation
[13:35] or god creating himself and it comes
[13:38] into view now it's going to be expressed
[13:40] through jesus christ now we know there
[13:43] has been creation
[13:44] before this in the beginning god created
[13:47] but all of this is foreshadowing and
[13:49] leading up to this expression
[13:51] in jesus christ so all these other
[13:53] things had to be here
[13:54] in order for christ or god even himself
[13:57] to have reason and purpose of being for
[13:59] him to express himself
[14:01] because god cannot be expressed fully
[14:03] expressed outside of redemption
[14:05] so the momentum of everything was coming
[14:07] to this place
[14:08] but now this is something distinct this
[14:10] is something
[14:12] supernatural he says god being a spirit
[14:15] is now going to be
[14:16] expressed in the flesh now skipping to a
[14:19] later part this is just a few paragraphs
[14:22] several paragraphs later in the same
[14:23] message but she received seed now
[14:26] speaking of the woman what was it
[14:28] god himself he was the beginning of the
[14:31] creation of god
[14:33] now let's we can we can admit that when
[14:36] it comes to the godhead there's somewhat
[14:37] of a paradox
[14:39] and that that's why you know
[14:40] trinitarianism and a lot of these other
[14:41] isms try to explain the godhead but god
[14:44] is one
[14:46] but yet god being one expressed himself
[14:48] in his son
[14:50] and then the son helps us to understand
[14:53] god becoming
[14:54] in god's desire because he says father i
[14:57] pray
[14:57] that they also you and i would be one
[15:01] even as the son and the father were one
[15:04] so we realize that there's something to
[15:06] the expression of god and the oneness
[15:07] that god has
[15:08] with the son we are also invited to
[15:11] share
[15:12] in that so the oneness is god's not one
[15:14] like your fingers one
[15:16] there's something something particular
[15:18] about this godhead and then
[15:19] it's even the oneness like your fingers
[15:21] one the trinitarians say well you have
[15:22] three parts to your finger and you have
[15:24] this part this part
[15:25] this part and they have this uh multiple
[15:28] personalities and multiple persons that
[15:30] make one
[15:31] and i had a friend who'd gone to
[15:33] theological school trying to explain it
[15:35] to me and he said
[15:36] you know really we can't ever we can't
[15:38] fully understand the trinity because it
[15:40] would be like
[15:41] if we lived in a one-dimensional world
[15:42] and a three-dimensional object dropped
[15:44] down into it you wouldn't be able to
[15:46] relate to it when he was done i said
[15:47] that's just really
[15:49] that's just kind of kind of some weak
[15:50] sauce there my friend and i think he
[15:52] kind of admitted it
[15:53] but we can we are to know god and know
[15:57] him as the one true god
[15:59] the lord is one but now god this one god
[16:02] who formed himself into the logos still
[16:05] spiritual still supernatural
[16:07] is now becoming flesh in jesus christ
[16:10] it's not another god and he's coming
[16:13] becoming flesh
[16:14] and it's god himself that's being
[16:17] expressed so then now
[16:18] skipping several paragraphs again
[16:20] paragraph 3 58
[16:22] the germ of god the life of god was
[16:24] designed
[16:25] in the womb of a woman which was the
[16:28] earth
[16:29] and then the life of god come in so he
[16:32] was the beginning of the creation of god
[16:35] so the germ of god
[16:37] is formed in designed in the womb of a
[16:39] woman
[16:40] and this woman representing the earth
[16:42] she came from the earth
[16:43] and then the life of god comes in he was
[16:45] the beginning of the creation of god
[16:47] in this mernian church age revisiting
[16:49] the same the same principle god come
[16:51] down in a blood cell not through a man
[16:53] but by the holy ghost
[16:55] and in that virgin womb a tabernacle for
[16:58] the purpose of death was built
[17:00] that's a heavy phrase a tabernacle for
[17:03] the purpose of death
[17:07] my cup runeth over glory you know there
[17:10] was that much
[17:11] much water in that one i can go longer
[17:13] the more water i have so this is really
[17:16] good
[17:18] so a tabernacle for the purpose of death
[17:20] was built the seat of the woman came
[17:22] that's bringing us to genesis 3 15. the
[17:24] seed of the woman came in order
[17:27] that he be bruised to bring us our
[17:28] salvation
[17:30] when the holy ghost came upon mary he
[17:32] created within her womb the cell
[17:34] that would multiply and become the body
[17:37] of our lord
[17:38] that cell was created it was the
[17:41] beginning of the creation of god
[17:44] that is who jesus is and that holy one
[17:47] was filled with holy blood
[17:49] even the blood of god that tabernacle
[17:52] came to birth and notice
[17:54] he grew to be a man this is remarkable
[17:58] to see that god designed it this way
[18:00] that god had it come forth this way the
[18:03] very tabernacle which was built for the
[18:05] purpose of death
[18:06] it is built by the very spoken word of
[18:09] god it is god's word being made flesh
[18:13] materializing in this body which is
[18:15] jesus the son of god then this
[18:18] it was the blood of god the holy one was
[18:20] filled with holy blood
[18:23] and that's what brother adam identified
[18:24] when we talked about the deity of jesus
[18:26] christ
[18:26] he specifically identified the fact that
[18:29] he was the blood of god
[18:30] and he says this it came to birth then
[18:33] it we scripture tells us he increased in
[18:35] stature
[18:35] and wisdom and favor with god and man
[18:38] and this is the son of god
[18:39] the sinless one the perfect one
[18:41] increasing
[18:42] that becomes a lesson to us that there's
[18:46] that he's being made he's growing he's
[18:48] coming into his own
[18:49] expression of perfection he grew to be a
[18:51] man and then
[18:52] this one who is filled with the blood of
[18:55] god this
[18:56] divine one this deity one he has there
[18:58] comes a time when the logos now comes
[19:01] and steps into this body for his
[19:03] ministry at 30 years old
[19:05] when he comes to the jordan river to be
[19:07] baptized and now the word is fully made
[19:09] flesh in jesus christ
[19:12] brother branham in the message seed of
[19:14] discrepancy says jesus christ
[19:16] for he was the seed of god he was the
[19:18] beginning of the creation of god
[19:20] he was nothing less than god
[19:25] this is the beginning of the creation of
[19:26] god jesus christ
[19:28] this comes in the middle of the book the
[19:30] momentum from
[19:31] in the beginning god created the heavens
[19:33] and the earth you could just imagine
[19:35] that everything was building for this
[19:36] climactic expression
[19:38] of this messiah this redeemer this one
[19:41] jesus christ
[19:42] god himself now the beginning of the
[19:44] creation of god
[19:46] how was it that god just kind of hid
[19:48] this plan and let it lay dormant and hid
[19:50] it from
[19:50] the wise and prudent and now he comes
[19:53] forth his the beginning of himself
[19:55] being made manifest himself being
[19:57] expressed though foreshadowed
[19:59] in creation now it's coming to its
[20:01] perfection and it's a little baby laying
[20:03] in a manger
[20:05] in the message why it had to be
[20:06] shepherds and i believe we read this
[20:08] statement last time
[20:09] he started a new creation what was it
[20:12] a creation of himself actually this
[20:15] i think this statement we didn't read
[20:17] last time maybe but he started
[20:19] a new creation a creation of himself now
[20:22] keep that in mind
[20:24] a new creation so this is something
[20:27] it's not the same creation where you're
[20:30] doing the same thing you can
[20:31] you can make pancakes uh for breakfast
[20:35] and then you do the same thing the next
[20:36] morning it's the same recipe it's the
[20:38] same elements
[20:39] and you wouldn't say oh a new creation
[20:41] your kids would say uh
[20:43] we had that yesterday yeah but it's new
[20:44] pancakes i real i get that
[20:46] it's different pancakes but it's the
[20:48] same process it's the same elements it's
[20:50] the same
[20:51] it's the same pancakes we're eating the
[20:52] same thing no we're not eating the same
[20:54] thing you ate those those are
[20:55] this is something new it's the same it's
[20:58] the same thing
[20:59] just repeat it again but now this is a
[21:01] new creation
[21:04] it it it's nothing that had been done
[21:06] before
[21:07] a creation of himself god was made flesh
[21:10] and dwelt among us
[21:12] the bible said in the beginning of the
[21:13] creation of god god was created
[21:16] in human form in jesus christ his son
[21:21] god dwelt so now this is god in human
[21:24] form
[21:24] now just remember some of the statements
[21:26] we've been reading over the last few
[21:28] months about
[21:29] how the bride is god in human form
[21:34] so you see the the symmetry now to when
[21:36] we say things about the bride we're not
[21:38] you can't say anything about the bride
[21:40] that wouldn't be represented in christ
[21:42] she's not greater than christ she is who
[21:45] she is because of christ
[21:47] god created a human form in jesus christ
[21:49] his son god dwelt
[21:50] he built his tabernacle of flesh and
[21:52] bones and lived in that tabernacle
[21:55] god emmanuel god with us he built
[21:57] himself a house to live in it
[21:59] so he could reflect his word to his
[22:01] subjects through that
[22:02] and we did read this last time you know
[22:04] what god is when you see christ
[22:08] you know what god is when you see christ
[22:10] you want to know god you can only know
[22:11] him as the son reveals him
[22:14] so you know what god is when you see
[22:15] christ so now god is going to become
[22:18] known
[22:18] he's not going to be the unknown god
[22:20] he's not just going to be the god that
[22:21] thundered upon the mountain he's not
[22:22] just going to be the god that gave
[22:24] commandments to moses
[22:25] he's not going to be just remain this
[22:26] mysterious one but through jesus christ
[22:29] god is going to become and i want to be
[22:32] careful maybe even saying this but god
[22:34] can be apprehended
[22:35] ultimately as paul said i desire to
[22:37] apprehend as i am apprehended
[22:39] as god fully knows and understands me
[22:41] through jesus christ
[22:43] god can begin to be known and through a
[22:46] process of revealing himself
[22:48] we can come to a place where we can
[22:49] apprehend him oh to know him
[22:53] it's beautiful jesus christ the
[22:55] beginning of the creation of god
[22:58] now in colossians chapter 1 verse 15.
[23:04] speaking of christ says who is the image
[23:07] of
[23:07] the invisible god the firstborn of every
[23:11] creature
[23:12] now i want to take this phrasing here
[23:16] and i want to and i want to kind of take
[23:18] the image and look at that a little bit
[23:22] when it says who is the image of the
[23:23] invisible god the first
[23:25] born of every creature him being the
[23:28] beginning of the creation of god this
[23:30] must be a greater
[23:31] or more perfect creation than what had
[23:34] prior that had been previously
[23:36] he is the image of the invisible god so
[23:39] when
[23:39] christ becomes the creation of god or
[23:42] god created himself
[23:43] it's the creation of something greater
[23:46] now that you could say this is my thesis
[23:48] statement that jesus christ the
[23:49] beginning of the creation of god
[23:51] it was ushering in something greater
[23:53] than what had been created previously
[23:56] and when god created as we read through
[23:58] it in genesis chapter one when god began
[24:00] to create
[24:01] it says that he saw that it was good and
[24:04] he expresses this six different times as
[24:06] he
[24:06] as he goes through each day of creation
[24:09] he sees it
[24:10] and it's expressed at different points
[24:12] in each day or at different times and
[24:14] god does something
[24:15] but six different times god sees what he
[24:17] has spoken into creation
[24:19] and what has come to be and he says he
[24:21] saw that it was
[24:22] good which means excellent it means
[24:25] agreeable it means pleasant or pleasing
[24:28] to god god saw that it was good
[24:29] this is pleasing to me god could very
[24:32] well say
[24:33] he saw god saw that it was pleasing to
[24:35] himself that it pleased him
[24:37] for this to be expressed this way and
[24:39] then in genesis chapter 1 verse 31
[24:42] it says then god saw everything that he
[24:44] had made and behold because now he's
[24:45] coming to the
[24:46] end of creation he sees everything that
[24:49] he had made and behold it was
[24:51] very good so god could create something
[24:54] god says let there be light and there's
[24:55] light and god said that's good
[24:57] now was it this is the light
[25:00] by the spoken word this is perfect light
[25:03] no no no weakness in it no no nothing
[25:06] defile in it nothing
[25:07] uh nothing about it that would be
[25:09] imperfect he calls it good
[25:11] because it was a perfect creation let
[25:13] there be light this is perfect light
[25:15] it's shining
[25:15] but now god looks at the process as it's
[25:18] unfolded and he looks at it
[25:19] and it's not just good it's very good
[25:23] exceedingly greatly good so you can have
[25:26] good
[25:26] which means it's not bad and not in a
[25:28] dismissive sense when somebody's how is
[25:30] that you know that's not bad
[25:32] and you say and if you say good it's
[25:35] something that there's not bad in it god
[25:37] saw and it was good but now it's
[25:38] exceedingly or
[25:39] greatly good now
[25:42] ponder this again as we're just
[25:44] referring back to some things that we've
[25:46] mentioned over the last several services
[25:48] in genesis chapter 1 verse 27 god
[25:51] made man or man was made in god's image
[25:54] and after the bible
[25:56] says after god's likeness and so man's
[25:59] made in the image of god
[26:01] after god's likeness so there's a holy
[26:03] image that adam possesses
[26:05] and there's a likeness or resemblance
[26:07] that he has
[26:08] but yet still being in that image and
[26:11] after that likeness there was still a
[26:13] more perfect
[26:14] image that could come forward and be
[26:15] expressed
[26:17] and we saw that in genesis chapter 3
[26:18] verse 22
[26:20] where after adam had taken of the tree
[26:23] of knowledge of good and evil god
[26:24] actually makes this declaration
[26:26] that man has become as one of us
[26:30] so though he was made in the image of
[26:32] god and after his likeness
[26:34] adam did something and then knew
[26:36] something that made him more like god
[26:38] and god said he's become like us not
[26:41] perfectly like us otherwise he would
[26:43] he could not have died but he says he's
[26:45] become as one of us to know something
[26:47] so this knowledge brought him into a
[26:49] further expression of god are more
[26:52] like god and then it says lest he put
[26:55] forth his hand and take of the tree of
[26:56] life and live forever
[26:57] we need to guard the tree of life so he
[27:00] saw that though adam was
[27:01] made in the image of god and after his
[27:03] likeness there was a more perfect
[27:05] image or knowledge or understanding or
[27:07] expression that could still come forth
[27:09] so there was still yet a more perfect
[27:12] image not expressed
[27:13] by adam so christ who is in the image of
[27:17] the invisible god the firstborn of every
[27:18] creature
[27:19] in colossians chapter 1 verse 19 says
[27:22] for it please
[27:23] the father that in him should all
[27:26] fullness dwell so in creation god said
[27:29] it is good it is good it's pleasing it
[27:30] is pleasing and displeasing he looks at
[27:32] all of creation he says
[27:33] this is very pleasing but now with
[27:35] christ again this pleasure this being
[27:38] agreeable
[27:38] he says for please the father we can say
[27:40] it was exceedingly
[27:42] and greatly pleasing that in christ
[27:44] should all
[27:45] fullness completeness dwell
[27:48] so now this is christ this is a
[27:51] different expression than adam
[27:53] because adam we could adam the fullness
[27:55] of god did not dwell in adam
[27:57] though he was in the image of god and
[27:59] after the likeness of god
[28:00] it pleased god it was pleasing to god it
[28:02] was after his desire his purpose and his
[28:04] will
[28:05] that not in adam but in christ all the
[28:08] fullness would dwell
[28:10] so then christ is as it says in verse 15
[28:13] he is the image
[28:14] of the invisible god
[28:17] the exact likeness so it says he is the
[28:20] image of the invisible god
[28:22] god remained invisible though man made
[28:25] after his image
[28:26] or in his image and after his likeness
[28:28] was clearly tangible and visible
[28:30] god remained invisible so there's a
[28:33] distinction now being made how that
[28:35] christ is now the exact
[28:36] likeness or the perfect representation
[28:40] of god
[28:42] and you'll find that even in the hebrew
[28:44] and as you think about it just
[28:45] think about our language and how we
[28:47] would use something an image is greater
[28:49] than the likeness
[28:52] adam was created in the image of god
[28:55] but christ perfectly expressed
[28:58] the invisible god christ
[29:01] expressed glories that the first adam
[29:03] only in part
[29:05] represented or only in shadow expressed
[29:08] this is part of my thesis adam in the
[29:11] beginning
[29:12] expressed certain glories and had
[29:13] certain things but yet christ now
[29:15] expresses
[29:16] glories and expresses things and does
[29:19] things that adam only was expressing in
[29:21] shadow or type or in part
[29:24] because christ who is the image of god
[29:26] when it speaks of this
[29:27] and we come to later places where paul
[29:29] is continuing to write
[29:31] to understand who christ is and his
[29:32] difference from adam
[29:34] to say he is in the image of the
[29:35] invisible god this image speaks of more
[29:38] than a resemblance because it relates to
[29:41] coming from
[29:42] the original if you could think of it
[29:45] this way
[29:46] like a child becomes the living image of
[29:48] a parent
[29:50] and you say well he that's the image he
[29:53] now possesses
[29:54] the life the dna he's come forth he says
[29:57] he looks like his parents why
[29:59] he is now in the image of his parents
[30:01] it's not just somebody
[30:02] who looks like so-and-so but he's in the
[30:05] image of it the image of something would
[30:07] be
[30:07] looking in a mirror or a reflection in
[30:09] the water when you see your reflection
[30:11] of what you said
[30:12] that's my image why because it is you
[30:14] being reflected
[30:16] but then you see something in the clouds
[30:18] you go oh that looks like a lion that's
[30:20] likeness
[30:22] because it's not an image when you look
[30:25] in the mirror it's not a likeness it's
[30:26] the image
[30:28] i want you this is an important
[30:29] principle to catch the the the image and
[30:32] likeness is one thing but to be in the
[30:34] image of the invisible god it speaks of
[30:36] more than a resemblance
[30:37] a likeness is merely a resemblance
[30:42] a likeness isn't literally derided from
[30:44] the original you could use the original
[30:46] as a pattern
[30:47] and it can be like it it's not but
[30:49] there's no derivative from an original
[30:51] an image is derived from the original a
[30:53] likeness is merely a resemblance of an
[30:55] original
[30:56] but an image is the expression or the
[30:58] reflection of it
[31:00] you have the original and then a
[31:02] reflection it comes from it
[31:03] it's in the image of it like a son comes
[31:06] forth and he's part of that original
[31:08] father
[31:08] he's in the image of his father but then
[31:10] you could run into somebody said man if
[31:11] i didn't know better
[31:12] you just you look just like brother
[31:14] so-and-so and they say brother who
[31:17] i don't know him not related to him
[31:20] even brother david was at the beginning
[31:23] of service or
[31:24] not at the beginning of service but when
[31:25] we were coming in this morning he comes
[31:27] in and he points to brother michael and
[31:28] he says
[31:29] he goes now i don't know this young man
[31:32] he goes but he's in the image he might
[31:33] even use those very words
[31:35] he's the expressed image of his father
[31:39] what because the characteristics that he
[31:41] would have that we'd be akin to brother
[31:43] paul
[31:43] you say yeah i could see brother paul
[31:45] jenkins in and the way that he looks and
[31:47] and especially this morning when he said
[31:48] it i don't know if your beard's just
[31:50] coming to the place when it
[31:51] accentuates it or what i was like you
[31:52] know what i can see that
[31:54] i can absolutely see that and you see
[31:56] now he's not
[31:57] doesn't just look like him because he's
[31:59] derived from brother paul what has he
[32:01] become
[32:02] he's in the image of him oh man that's
[32:05] just
[32:06] exciting this is really good stuff
[32:08] brother aaron
[32:14] the image is the expression of something
[32:17] it's derived from the original or
[32:18] the reflection of it so it's directly
[32:20] connected to there has to be an original
[32:22] that's being portrayed and let's express
[32:25] this
[32:25] in john chapter 1 verse 18 no man hath
[32:28] seen god at any time
[32:34] the only begotten son so at this point
[32:36] he's the only
[32:37] birth begotten son which is in the bosom
[32:40] of the father so now it speaks to his
[32:42] heart purpose
[32:44] origination this is where he comes from
[32:45] he comes from the bosom of the father
[32:47] the only begotten son he hath declared
[32:50] him so no man had seen god
[32:54] the expression of god they can see his
[32:56] backside they can see types and shadows
[32:59] there could be ways that he's
[33:00] represented even in flesh but to see
[33:02] god no man had seen god at any time but
[33:04] now the only begotten son
[33:06] is declaring the invisible god because
[33:08] he's the image of the invisible god he's
[33:10] the reflection of the invisible god not
[33:12] just a likeness in something that
[33:14] resembles him
[33:14] he is the image of the invisible god
[33:19] and the bible says he have declared him
[33:21] it's not just a snapshot
[33:24] jesus wasn't a snap of god that would
[33:27] kind of go away after a while and you
[33:29] better be sure to take a screenshot so
[33:30] you can keep it
[33:31] no this is something that to declare
[33:34] means to unfold as a narrative
[33:36] you would have to watch him and keep
[33:38] your eyes focused on him
[33:39] and you'd see him unfold and as he
[33:42] speaks and as he moves and as he makes
[33:44] himself known
[33:45] god is unfolding as a narrative so you
[33:48] can't just take a snapshot
[33:49] of jesus distributing bread and say well
[33:52] in that the fullness of god has
[33:53] expressed no
[33:54] you've got to keep your eyes on him
[33:56] you've got to keep focused on him
[33:58] you have to stay connected to him
[34:00] because it's through christ that god is
[34:02] declared
[34:03] he unfolds as a narrative i'm so glad
[34:06] that we're walking
[34:07] in this today that god is unfolding to
[34:10] us
[34:10] as the bride of jesus christ as a
[34:12] narrative as i listen to brother branham
[34:15] preach
[34:15] go christ is unfolding to me as a
[34:18] narrative as we come together and sit
[34:20] under the preach of the word
[34:21] god is unfolding to me as a narrative as
[34:24] i watch
[34:24] your life as i hear of testimonies as i
[34:27] see healings as we fellowship together
[34:29] god is unfolding as a narrative
[34:33] it's becoming known to us being declared
[34:38] and so as we come to hebrews chapter one
[34:41] we'll pull from it
[34:42] verses two to six as he's talking about
[34:45] jesus christ and lord laid the
[34:47] foundations of the heavens and the earth
[34:49] they'll be folded up and they'll be
[34:51] changed just as a garment that
[34:53] waxes old but god is the same
[34:58] and he said to his son thy throne is
[35:00] forever
[35:02] the scepter of righteousness is the
[35:03] scepter of thy kingdom he's speaking of
[35:04] jesus christ
[35:06] and it says this god now verse two god
[35:08] hath in these last days
[35:10] spoken to us by his son whom he hath
[35:13] appointed
[35:14] heir of all things now as a son
[35:17] he has been appointed
[35:20] god making this divine appointment this
[35:22] ordination
[35:26] by whom also he made the worlds
[35:29] who being the brightness of his glory
[35:32] christ now is the brightness of god's
[35:34] glory who being the brightness of his
[35:35] glory
[35:36] and the express image of this person
[35:40] and upholding all things by the word of
[35:42] his power when he hath
[35:44] by himself purged our sins
[35:47] sat down on the right hand of the
[35:49] majesty on high
[35:50] so now god is expressed through his son
[35:53] christ is the brightness of god's glory
[35:55] he's the expressed
[35:57] image of god and the holding of all
[35:59] things by his power
[36:00] when he had by himself purged our sins
[36:02] and god
[36:03] by himself purged our sins through the
[36:06] creation
[36:07] of god the beginning of the creation of
[36:10] a god created a man god created a body
[36:13] because we know this is again the
[36:14] paradox of the god god cannot die
[36:17] so he created his son jesus christ he is
[36:20] now
[36:21] through the the purge by the shedding of
[36:23] his own blood he purges
[36:24] our sins he's raised up seat at the
[36:26] right hand of majesty on high
[36:28] verse 4 being made so much better than
[36:31] the angels
[36:33] now the bible actually says being made
[36:36] lower than the angels right
[36:39] speaking of the condescension down to
[36:41] flesh being made lower than the angels
[36:43] as we see some sort of hierarchy in
[36:45] realms and
[36:46] dimensions but now he's saying even
[36:48] though he came as a man in the image of
[36:50] a man
[36:51] he's made so much better than the angels
[36:53] this places him
[36:54] differently in the the economy of god as
[36:58] he hath by inheritance
[37:01] well how is it because he's a son that's
[37:03] appointed he hath by inheritance
[37:05] obtained
[37:06] a more excellent name than they this is
[37:08] god's plan this is god's will
[37:10] this is the way god established it if we
[37:13] in the flesh drew up a will or we could
[37:15] say i want all of this to go to this
[37:17] person i want all this to go here this
[37:18] one gets my estate
[37:20] it's by appointment by inheritance by
[37:21] what's been ordained he has been by
[37:23] god's own divine ordinance he's obtained
[37:26] a more excellent name than the angels
[37:29] for under which are the angels that
[37:31] any time thou art my son this day have i
[37:33] begotten thee
[37:35] they were beings that were created by
[37:37] god but now he he
[37:39] an angel doesn't share in what jesus
[37:41] christ says he is a begotten son and
[37:43] again i will be to him a father
[37:45] and he shall be to me a son and again
[37:47] when he bringeth in the first
[37:49] begotten into the world he said and let
[37:52] all the angels of god worship him
[37:55] christ obtaining the more excellent name
[37:57] than of the angels
[37:58] and he is the brightness of god's glory
[38:00] the express
[38:01] image of his person christ is the
[38:04] image of the invisible god not just a
[38:06] likeness
[38:08] we can see likenesses even in the old
[38:10] testament characters we can see a
[38:11] likeness
[38:12] of god in adam but now this is the
[38:14] express image
[38:15] of his person the bible calling in
[38:19] colossians 1 15
[38:21] he says the first born of every creature
[38:24] this is god's firstborn and being the
[38:28] firstborn this is god's rule and this is
[38:29] god's law in the beginning
[38:32] that being the first born
[38:35] of god he now becomes heir
[38:38] of all things the firstborn of every
[38:41] creature speaks of dominion
[38:43] the government shall be upon his
[38:44] shoulders it speaks of him uh
[38:46] uh his his dominion his government is
[38:48] going to be his
[38:50] it speaks of him being the highest rank
[38:53] the firstborn in a family and this is
[38:56] why
[38:57] with god this was god's rule in god's
[38:59] law from the beginning
[39:00] and then we see it expressed in israel
[39:03] the law of the firstborn
[39:05] and that's where you find and this is uh
[39:09] actually you know i just thinking about
[39:11] it i think man praise the lord i
[39:12] probably could have an opportunity to
[39:14] minister on it
[39:14] brother of another says the law of
[39:16] adoption the law of adoption it refers
[39:17] to the old testament
[39:19] the law of adoption in the old testament
[39:21] but and and you don't necessarily you
[39:23] can't go back in the scripture and find
[39:24] specifically it says
[39:26] this is the law of adoption what was it
[39:28] it's the law of the firstborn
[39:30] therein you see the law of adoption the
[39:32] first born
[39:33] son would be heir to all things and if
[39:36] his conduct and his character
[39:38] remained in harmony with that of the
[39:40] father he would
[39:42] become heir of all that the father had
[39:44] that's the law of adoption you say well
[39:46] where do you get that from look at
[39:47] reuben
[39:48] who by his character and by his actions
[39:51] was disinherited
[39:52] that's the law of adoption he remained a
[39:55] son
[39:56] but he lost something and so now we
[39:59] could look back and see god always had
[40:01] this law on this principle
[40:02] that the firstborn all government is
[40:05] going to be his
[40:06] the firstborn of god is going to have
[40:08] dominion he's going to be heir of all
[40:10] things he's going to obtain all things
[40:11] he's going to be the most preeminent
[40:13] he's going to be the highest one in rank
[40:15] he is going to be the one that's going
[40:16] to receive me and be in my stead this is
[40:19] going to be the son
[40:20] so adam was not the first born from god
[40:23] jesus christ was and you look to the old
[40:26] testament and it's always pointing to
[40:27] the law of the firstborn
[40:29] which now is made manifest in scripture
[40:31] says the first
[40:32] begotten or the only begotten
[40:35] the first born of every creature
[40:40] and so the psalms actually speaks of it
[40:42] prophesies it 80 psalm 89 27
[40:45] also i will make him my firstborn higher
[40:48] than the kings of the earth
[40:51] speaking of this i will make him he will
[40:53] be created the firstborn
[40:55] higher than the kings of the earth and
[40:57] to the jews the word firstborn was
[40:59] synonymous to king
[41:01] if you said firstborn it was the
[41:02] preeminent one the one highest in rank
[41:04] and that's why you even see in
[41:05] monarchies that's the first born son
[41:07] is going to be the heir to the throne
[41:10] that's why it was so it'd be so
[41:12] important to have a son
[41:13] because he then becomes the heir and you
[41:14] know your domain
[41:16] your kingdom your name the son becomes
[41:18] the bearer of the family name
[41:20] he obtains that name he obtains the
[41:22] inheritance and he goes forward as a
[41:24] builder and continue to build that
[41:26] legacy
[41:26] and a builder of the family name this is
[41:28] all contained in the language in the
[41:30] words of the hebrews and even within
[41:32] their kingdoms
[41:33] this son is going to come forth he's
[41:35] going to be a king so to a jew to say
[41:37] firstborn spoke of the preeminent one a
[41:39] king
[41:40] a great one it even speaks of prince
[41:44] now i know that we're maybe thrown off a
[41:46] little bit by the united kingdom
[41:50] because you have the queen of england
[41:51] and then you have the princes and you
[41:52] have so many different princes
[41:54] and then you're like well you have
[41:55] prince william and you have this prince
[41:56] prince henry and you have
[41:58] uh i don't know all that maybe you can
[41:59] just start naming traditional names
[42:00] george and henry and all these
[42:02] they're the princes right and not
[42:05] princesses but they're princes and you
[42:07] still have princesses and we think
[42:09] oh king queen prince but there's
[42:12] something about the word prince in
[42:13] scripture
[42:14] got to be careful doesn't mean a junior
[42:17] to the king
[42:18] in revelations 1 5 think about this if
[42:20] we take the
[42:21] united kingdom queen of england approach
[42:24] to this you get things really backwards
[42:26] and from jesus christ
[42:28] who is the faithful witness and the
[42:30] first begotten of the dead
[42:33] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[42:37] you read that with the carnal
[42:38] understanding say oh isn't that nice all
[42:40] these kings have a little prince
[42:42] isn't that cute but the word prince
[42:44] there means
[42:46] the chief the ruler
[42:49] the leader he's the prince of the kings
[42:52] of the he's the chief of the kings
[42:54] he's the commander of the kings he's the
[42:56] greatest of all the king he has a more
[42:58] excellent glory than all the kings
[43:00] wow he's the firstborn he's the king of
[43:03] kings
[43:04] that's what it means he's the prince
[43:06] he's the prince of peace that doesn't
[43:08] mean the devil's the king of peace he's
[43:09] the prince he's the leader he's the
[43:11] commander he's the highest
[43:13] nobody else has power over your peace he
[43:15] alone has power over it
[43:17] give yourselves to him claim it yes
[43:20] he's the prince he's the command he's
[43:21] the leader of the kings that's what it
[43:23] means when he's the image of the
[43:24] invisible god the express image of his
[43:26] person
[43:26] the firstborn the king of every creature
[43:30] so in christ who is the image of the
[43:32] invisible god the firstborn of every
[43:34] creature
[43:35] in him it pleased the father that all
[43:36] the fullness of god would dwell
[43:38] who'll be in the brightness of his glory
[43:40] the expressed image of his person
[43:42] the first begotten into the world he
[43:43] says when he bringeth the first begotten
[43:46] into the world
[43:46] all the angels of god were to worship
[43:48] him
[43:50] we looked at it last sunday matthew
[43:51] chapter 1 verse 18.
[43:53] now the birth of jesus christ was on
[43:55] this wise
[43:57] when as his mother mary was espoused to
[43:59] joseph before they came together
[44:01] she was found with child of
[44:04] the holy ghost the birth
[44:08] of jesus christ to beget the to engender
[44:11] the genesis the genos the genes of jesus
[44:14] christ
[44:15] he has begotten his birth god is
[44:18] developing them
[44:20] god is creating again
[44:24] now there's and we looked at the birth
[44:27] of jesus christ
[44:28] is on this wise it's in contrast to all
[44:31] the other begets that we see
[44:34] in genesis matthew chapter one uh those
[44:36] first several 16 verses there
[44:38] so and so begat so and so begat but now
[44:40] jesus christ
[44:42] is not the product of a man and a woman
[44:44] therefore he comes from the man
[44:46] and joseph begat jesus christ
[44:49] not mentioned it has to change the
[44:51] narrative
[44:52] because now god who is the holy ghost
[44:55] the child within mary
[44:57] is the creation of god god is
[45:00] engineering god's
[45:01] genesis the genes of god are now being
[45:03] projected into this sinless flesh
[45:05] who bypasses the original sin god is
[45:08] developing
[45:10] blood cells god this is such an
[45:12] incredible moment
[45:13] god by the original spoken word of
[45:16] genesis 1 28
[45:17] god is creating again and in creating
[45:20] again
[45:21] it's the redemption of the creation that
[45:23] fell
[45:25] god's not starting all over had god
[45:28] wanted to start all over he could have
[45:29] just taken that seed and said all right
[45:31] another
[45:32] galaxy or he could have just planned it
[45:34] that way
[45:35] i'll create uh i'll create the milky way
[45:38] and i'll have an earth there
[45:39] and we'll start we'll see where that
[45:41] goes but i'll also have a snickers
[45:42] galaxy over here
[45:44] so that if something goes wrong over
[45:45] here in the milky way then i could just
[45:47] take the word there in the milky way
[45:49] and place it over on the earth and the
[45:50] snickers galaxy and there we can get
[45:53] our our creation that's perfect
[45:58] how come so many chocolate bars or
[46:00] things in the galaxies they're named
[46:01] after chocolate you've got mars you've
[46:03] got sn wait wait
[46:04] it's not a snickers galaxy that's just
[46:05] creation of my own
[46:11] hey brother the bible says you the word
[46:13] that we have go create a world and live
[46:15] on it
[46:16] i've just created the snickers galaxy
[46:19] glory
[46:21] all that chocolatey nutty goodness
[46:25] the milky way doesn't have nuts right
[46:28] that's that's not really a type this
[46:30] galaxy's full of nuts
[46:35] now there's two things i want to mention
[46:38] very quickly before we go forward
[46:40] because god is creating again
[46:43] and this is this is part of
[46:47] this thesis the principles of creation
[46:52] let me say this way the principles of
[46:53] redemption
[46:55] require that it be greater that what's
[46:58] coming forth is greater because that's
[46:59] the mystery of redemption
[47:01] that it's it's when it's when it's
[47:03] brought back it achieves a greater glory
[47:06] and we see that's just the principle of
[47:07] this body when it's redeemed is not just
[47:09] going to be the same body
[47:10] it can get sick and die right it's going
[47:12] to be glorified
[47:13] and so the redemption of our souls
[47:15] didn't put us in a state to where it
[47:17] could fall again
[47:18] it's sealed right can never can never be
[47:21] defiled never be corrupt
[47:22] so the principle of redemption then when
[47:24] something has fallen and
[47:26] been redeemed in redemption is an
[47:28] expression of something greater and
[47:30] that's a prince that's one of the
[47:31] mysteries of redemption
[47:32] because redemption is not i got sick to
[47:35] get sick again
[47:37] that's not redemption that's healing
[47:41] so the redemption of something to it the
[47:43] redemption of our body
[47:44] is to not put us in a body that could
[47:46] then get sick and die again
[47:47] so there's something great this is the
[47:48] glory to be revealed in us
[47:51] so redemption requires and necessitates
[47:53] something greater
[47:54] so that's the principle of redemption
[47:56] that requires something greater then the
[47:58] principles of creation also require
[48:00] that if god creates a new then it's
[48:03] greater than the prior creation
[48:06] if god creates again it's greater
[48:10] and this is where i'm i'm referring back
[48:12] to some principles maybe we'd mentioned
[48:13] before
[48:14] but i'm going to take more time just to
[48:15] kind of nail this down tight
[48:17] so the message why it had to be
[48:18] shepherds god says god is fixing to make
[48:21] another
[48:21] creation he's creating mortal earth
[48:24] mortal life angels sing in heaven so in
[48:26] the beginning when god created
[48:27] mortal earth mortal life the angels were
[48:29] singing in heaven
[48:30] but here he's creating new life
[48:34] so another creation new life not adam's
[48:36] life now
[48:37] it's not gonna be adam's life living in
[48:39] a body that wasn't uh
[48:40] uh made through the combination of a man
[48:43] and a woman it's new altogether
[48:45] new life eternal life for man and he's
[48:47] singing to his subjects through angels
[48:49] on earth
[48:50] not in heaven heaven had eternal life
[48:52] they sang to the heavens when the mortal
[48:54] creation come in
[48:55] and here the immortal creation is coming
[48:58] in
[48:58] and now they're singing to earthly
[49:00] people
[49:01] so it's another creation it's different
[49:03] it's distinct from the prior
[49:05] creation that god had had that god had
[49:08] brought forth and that
[49:09] involves now this this god is fixing to
[49:13] make another creation because it's
[49:14] distinct from the
[49:16] prior because it's distinct from the
[49:17] difference
[49:19] the prior creation and it being
[49:21] different it evokes
[49:22] something about god a law of god comes
[49:24] into play
[49:26] there's something about god now if he's
[49:27] creating something new
[49:29] there's a characteristic of god that's
[49:31] made manifest
[49:33] now this is drawing on a lot of things
[49:35] that we've tried to make very plain in
[49:36] the in the word
[49:38] creation is an expression of the
[49:40] invisible god
[49:42] brotherhood is teaching us this that the
[49:43] creation is an expression of the creator
[49:46] so as a creator creates he with each
[49:50] creation it's moving closer to
[49:52] his full expression so an artist could
[49:55] create something
[49:56] and said that expresses something about
[49:57] the artist but the more you have of his
[49:59] work
[49:59] the more you understand his thought
[50:01] process and his style
[50:02] you can look at one pain he says well
[50:04] what do you think an impressionist
[50:05] what's your thoughts on this say well
[50:07] it kind of favors this a little bit but
[50:09] then you see the nectar say okay i kind
[50:10] of see
[50:11] maybe something developing and then you
[50:12] see the next one the next one and you
[50:14] look at the body of work and you can
[50:16] even see some evolution and style and
[50:18] and refinement of certain characters are
[50:20] honing in on a particular way that an
[50:22] artist wants to express themselves
[50:24] and you look at the whole body of work
[50:25] and you say this is who this person is
[50:28] and so god is not just merely one who
[50:31] creates
[50:32] uh who just does one little thing say oh
[50:34] there's all of god but if god
[50:36] creates something he's expressing his
[50:37] creation if he creates again he's
[50:40] expressed in that creation
[50:41] and so go as with each creation it's
[50:43] moving full to a fuller expression
[50:45] of the creator we read a statement that
[50:48] brother branham said when god's creating
[50:50] from the smallest
[50:51] form and the single cell organism uh
[50:54] those are my words
[50:55] but god created from the very beginning
[50:56] the first few cells and as he begin to
[50:58] create
[50:59] uh with more cells and more cells and
[51:01] comes out with the polywog or a frog
[51:03] and then evolutes up and creates another
[51:05] he says god working
[51:07] in a pattern that's the phrase he uses
[51:10] god working in the pattern
[51:12] he says kind of a evolution rising
[51:15] praise higher in another place looking
[51:18] at how god created in the beginning he
[51:19] says making something
[51:21] greater and greater he makes this
[51:24] statement
[51:24] they kept getting higher blood higher
[51:28] form of life
[51:29] higher form till it climbs up into the
[51:32] man
[51:32] realm so higher blood higher form
[51:36] of life until it climbed up into the the
[51:38] man realm now remember
[51:40] brother abraham is saying that the blood
[51:41] of jesus christ isn't the blood of man
[51:45] so he say higher blood if you start out
[51:47] with the blood of a frog
[51:48] and then if in just and you evolved up
[51:50] he said higher blood
[51:52] higher blood higher blood higher life
[51:55] and you come to this form of a man if
[51:58] god ever created another blood
[52:00] would he drop back that wouldn't be the
[52:02] nature of god
[52:04] if god creates a new blood it's got to
[52:07] be
[52:08] higher each the expression then as god
[52:11] climbs up into the man realm the
[52:13] expression evolved with each creation it
[52:16] says greater
[52:17] higher greater higher so when god
[52:19] created the monkey
[52:21] the monkey was perfect
[52:24] it's perfect you have nothing else to
[52:26] compare it to
[52:27] it's the evolution of perfection it's
[52:29] evolved up to that
[52:31] but then when it takes another step
[52:33] perfections evolved
[52:36] the frog was perfect but with another
[52:37] creation it became
[52:39] more perfect became more excellent it
[52:41] was good it was good it was good it was
[52:42] pleasing and pleasing
[52:43] and so it's an evolution of god creating
[52:46] in the message the serpent seed brother
[52:47] man said the highest form because it
[52:49] evolves climbs up into the man realm the
[52:52] highest form is the human being
[52:54] god started at the bottom and made right
[52:56] up until he brought plum
[52:57] into his image brought it from the birds
[52:59] and the beast and on until he got to the
[53:01] image of god
[53:02] he made man in that image that's the
[53:04] highest form
[53:06] so man in creation man was the highest
[53:09] form
[53:12] now when i read these you might feel
[53:13] like brother aaron you're kind of
[53:16] building a box to impeach yourself just
[53:18] stick with it
[53:21] this just notice this principle's got to
[53:23] be understood as god creates when he
[53:24] comes to the man that's the highest form
[53:27] why because that was the last creation
[53:30] he says and after in the message mark of
[53:32] the beast and the sill of god after a
[53:33] while brewed a little more god brooding
[53:35] over the earth what come out next
[53:36] was probably the flowers and vegetations
[53:38] and the birds flew out of the dust of
[53:39] the earth
[53:40] and then come the animal life and kept
[53:42] getting higher life higher life higher
[53:44] life higher life until finally a man
[53:45] come up
[53:46] in the very image of god highest form
[53:49] higher life higher life it keeps
[53:50] evolving involving evolving
[53:51] in the message conferences he kept
[53:53] getting greater greater greater greater
[53:55] so it's great
[53:56] it's greater greater greater greater
[53:58] greater and finally the earth reflected
[54:00] the reflection of him that was brooding
[54:02] so this is now a likeness that we see in
[54:05] the earth because god looked upon man
[54:07] he sees a likeness or an expression of
[54:09] himself he says
[54:10] the the like is the reflection of him
[54:11] that was brooding god and he was
[54:13] in the image of god never did anything
[54:16] come
[54:16] higher than a man even to our beloved
[54:18] sisters a woman
[54:19] she's not in the original creation so
[54:23] brother branham
[54:24] deals with this in a few other places he
[54:26] says in flashing red light the last
[54:28] creative being that god ever created was
[54:31] a man
[54:32] a woman is a byproduct from a man
[54:35] and the reason why brother benham goes
[54:37] through this uses this language
[54:39] and you'll find that in the the sermons
[54:40] where he's referring to this
[54:42] it's to make the expression to make it
[54:45] understood
[54:45] that the woman was not a new creation
[54:50] god created man and then man was the
[54:52] highest form
[54:54] man was the highest life man was in the
[54:56] light after the likeness of god and had
[54:58] the image of god upon him
[55:00] if the holy image that he loses when he
[55:01] falls but then he didn't then create
[55:04] the woman because had he created the
[55:06] woman next
[55:09] she would have been greater it would
[55:11] have been a higher life
[55:13] so then he takes from the original adam
[55:16] and he makes a woman who's the same
[55:18] material
[55:20] as adam he separates her out so now
[55:24] she is not greater than adam
[55:27] and we've heard it expressed in the
[55:28] marriage ceremony that he didn't take a
[55:30] heel bone
[55:31] so the woman would be under the feet he
[55:32] didn't take the head a bone from the
[55:34] head that she would rule over man but he
[55:36] took
[55:36] something from his side because she's a
[55:38] counterpart she's co-equal
[55:41] it's the it's the highest life but now
[55:43] she's a further
[55:44] expression of the same life the same
[55:48] flesh the same blood had god just
[55:51] created something new
[55:52] she would have been greater it'd have
[55:54] been a higher blood because god doesn't
[55:56] bat
[55:56] god doesn't fall back it's the devil
[55:59] that did that
[56:00] it's the devil that corrupted the devils
[56:02] defiled and weakened the nations
[56:05] so if god had created eve apart from
[56:08] adam it would have been a greater
[56:09] creation
[56:10] because whenever god creates anew it is
[56:14] greater because god's an evolutionist
[56:16] god evolves in his creating
[56:19] if it's if he creates something
[56:22] and it's the same as what's been created
[56:24] already then it's not a new creation
[56:26] he's made pancakes again same recipe
[56:29] same element
[56:30] same image same expression so now in the
[56:33] message power of transformation
[56:35] so now you can see how this evolved to
[56:38] where man
[56:39] after the likeness of god god achieved
[56:41] something in man he says i'm going to
[56:43] stop right there because that's the
[56:44] highest form that i want it to evolve to
[56:46] but notice how god brother bannon places
[56:48] it it come like by evolution power of
[56:51] transformation
[56:52] like he was learning more all the time
[56:54] like he was learning all time
[56:56] and that's what science says you know
[56:57] what all these elements now
[56:59] evolve and it takes some of the same
[57:01] characteristics
[57:02] but now you have a different life a
[57:04] higher life they
[57:05] see that he says making something
[57:07] greater and greater
[57:09] he says but see now this is the image i
[57:11] want you to catch
[57:12] he was above it all right
[57:16] there's a statement that i thought i had
[57:17] had that i'd used at one time and i've
[57:19] it's been several years now where i
[57:21] haven't been able to find it so maybe
[57:22] i'm kind of giving up that it was there
[57:24] but it was something that where brother
[57:26] man expresses this thought
[57:28] that god is always moving to the kingdom
[57:30] it's a momentum
[57:32] and god is always moving to express the
[57:34] perfect
[57:35] god is moving to express the eternal
[57:37] there's a light that shines and it
[57:39] shines what more and more as unto a
[57:41] perfect day it's it's not an imperfect
[57:44] light but god is always moving to
[57:45] perfection he's always moving to full
[57:47] expression
[57:48] and so now when you see this trajectory
[57:51] or this
[57:51] image that's being expressed something
[57:53] greater something higher higher higher
[57:54] higher greater greater greater greater
[57:55] greater
[57:56] then he makes this statement god's above
[57:58] it all
[57:59] so then you see like this almost like a
[58:02] thermometer or some kind of something
[58:03] that's being measured
[58:04] as it evolves up he was above it all and
[58:07] just let it evolve
[58:09] up to that so he stops at man everything
[58:12] he began to bring upon the earth
[58:14] from botany life and fish and so forth
[58:16] come on into birds and animals and then
[58:18] something in his own image a man and
[58:20] stop there
[58:21] because it was up to his perfection of
[58:24] what he
[58:24] wanted at the time what god wanted
[58:28] because
[58:29] he had this place creation in a
[58:31] particular state that it would express
[58:33] something about his character
[58:34] but then satan had to come and defile it
[58:37] to create a sin
[58:38] to deform the creation because then he
[58:41] says
[58:41] when satan accomplished what was
[58:45] necessary so god allowed it
[58:48] this is now it's evolved up to what he
[58:51] wanted
[58:52] this is god above it all he lets it
[58:54] evolute up to that
[58:56] but we know adam is not god he's like
[58:59] god
[59:00] he's in the image of god there's a
[59:02] likeness now
[59:04] there is there's a mold where god has
[59:06] now taken himself
[59:08] and he's created a likeness which is
[59:11] a resemblance in the earth
[59:14] now you could still use the same
[59:16] language of image and likeness
[59:18] but now brother branham says the holy
[59:19] image of god leaves adam when he falls
[59:22] so that's taken away but when you come
[59:24] to image and likeness in the new
[59:26] testament
[59:26] when the christ is the expressed image
[59:28] of his person
[59:29] or the image of the invisible god that's
[59:32] something
[59:32] different than what adam was so now
[59:36] listen to this statement in the message
[59:38] it wasn't so from the beginning he says
[59:40] i'd like for
[59:41] science to answer this one if there's
[59:43] such a thing as evolution and they claim
[59:45] it came some other way
[59:47] they claim it could come some other way
[59:49] why don't something rise higher than a
[59:51] man
[59:53] we have no species higher than a man
[59:59] so brother graham's identifying this
[1:00:00] species homo sapien er
[1:00:03] nothing higher than a man because he's
[1:00:05] in the image of god
[1:00:07] but then he makes this statement nothing
[1:00:10] can go beyond
[1:00:11] its creator so god then
[1:00:15] as he creates is above it all
[1:00:19] and he lets it evolute up to man so then
[1:00:21] man
[1:00:22] is the highest the next is god
[1:00:26] god is above it all higher blood higher
[1:00:28] form of life higher form greater greater
[1:00:30] higher life higher life higher life
[1:00:32] higher life
[1:00:32] until finally it comes into the realm of
[1:00:34] man here comes the man who comes in the
[1:00:36] image of god
[1:00:37] so now god has created up to where he
[1:00:39] has a resemblance
[1:00:41] he's god here's the resemblance
[1:00:45] he says nothing can go beyond
[1:00:48] its creator so now the phrase
[1:00:52] the beginning of the creation of god has
[1:00:54] to take on new life to us now
[1:00:57] god brought man up to a likeness and an
[1:01:00] expression
[1:01:01] but he was not the creator
[1:01:04] he was in the likeness of the creator
[1:01:06] man cannot go beyond his creator
[1:01:08] the beginning of the creation of god is
[1:01:11] the creator
[1:01:13] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:01:14] jesus christ then is the last
[1:01:17] evolution of god into himself
[1:01:20] because it's god creating himself in the
[1:01:23] beginning of the creation of god
[1:01:25] god becoming tangible god becoming flesh
[1:01:29] and it can't go beyond its creator but
[1:01:31] it's come to
[1:01:32] its creator the becoming god has become
[1:01:36] in jesus christ
[1:01:38] so then there's so many statements we
[1:01:40] could use here but let's just use one
[1:01:41] from the message lean not unto thy own
[1:01:43] understanding
[1:01:44] jesus was a virgin born son and was not
[1:01:46] altogether a man
[1:01:48] but he was god the god man
[1:01:52] and he was more than a man he was a man
[1:01:55] plus adam was a man adam
[1:01:59] man jesus christ is a man plus
[1:02:03] what was he adam plus god amen
[1:02:07] it evolved up to the perfection that god
[1:02:09] wanted but now
[1:02:10] in jesus christ man becomes
[1:02:14] god or better yet god becomes
[1:02:18] man that's he called a god man
[1:02:22] more than a man he calls him a man plus
[1:02:24] now we could read
[1:02:25] dozens dozens of quotations to you to
[1:02:28] emphasize that
[1:02:31] but we realize this is something that
[1:02:33] god had become
[1:02:36] so now let's look at this statement i
[1:02:38] try not to say so now so often
[1:02:41] in the church age book chapter 9 the
[1:02:42] laodicean church age says as he stands
[1:02:45] there revealing who he is in this last
[1:02:46] age this is to
[1:02:48] support what we've just shown you higher
[1:02:50] blood higher form of life higher form
[1:02:52] god is fixing to make another creation
[1:02:54] here he's creating a
[1:02:55] new life immortal life is coming in so
[1:02:58] this is a
[1:02:59] this is even higher higher than what
[1:03:01] adam had as he stands there revealing
[1:03:03] who he is in this last age he calls
[1:03:04] himself the author of the creation of
[1:03:06] god
[1:03:07] which is the beginning of the creation
[1:03:08] of god this is
[1:03:10] another creation this has to do with the
[1:03:13] church
[1:03:14] this is a special designation of himself
[1:03:18] he is the creator of that church the
[1:03:21] heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:03:23] bride
[1:03:24] now in the image of adam and the woman
[1:03:27] where did the woman come from
[1:03:29] from adam so where is this bride come
[1:03:32] from
[1:03:33] she's not in a sandbox and god just kind
[1:03:36] of creating some that's what the earth
[1:03:37] was that's what adam was that's what
[1:03:39] creation was
[1:03:39] but when the woman come forth she came
[1:03:41] forth from adam not in another sandbox
[1:03:43] when the bride comes forth god's not
[1:03:45] using another galaxy another sandbox
[1:03:48] it's the same material as the groom
[1:03:51] so he says the bride the same as the
[1:03:54] groom
[1:03:56] so this is a special designation of
[1:03:58] himself
[1:03:59] designed from himself he is the creator
[1:04:01] of that church the heavenly bridegroom
[1:04:03] created his own bride
[1:04:04] as the spirit of god he came down and
[1:04:06] created in the virgin mary
[1:04:08] the cells from which his body was born i
[1:04:10] want to repeat that
[1:04:12] he created the very cells in the moon of
[1:04:14] mary for that body
[1:04:15] it was not enough for the holy spirit to
[1:04:17] simply give
[1:04:19] life to human ovum supplied by mary that
[1:04:21] would have been sinful
[1:04:23] mankind producing a body this would not
[1:04:25] have produced
[1:04:26] the last adam it would have produced
[1:04:30] something like the original adam of him
[1:04:32] it was says lo
[1:04:33] a body thou father prepared for me
[1:04:36] god not mary provided that body mary was
[1:04:39] the human
[1:04:40] incubator she carried that holy child
[1:04:42] and brought him to birth
[1:04:43] it was a god man he was the son of god
[1:04:47] he was the new creation
[1:04:51] man and god met and joined he was the
[1:04:54] first
[1:04:54] of this new race he is the head of this
[1:04:58] new race
[1:05:00] adam represents uh and maybe race might
[1:05:02] confuse us a little bit because we think
[1:05:04] of ethnicity
[1:05:05] this is not ethnicity this is not
[1:05:07] culture
[1:05:08] this is a new species this is something
[1:05:11] god evolved god evolved and he made man
[1:05:13] pure man full man full homo sapien
[1:05:15] adam represents humanity represents from
[1:05:18] from the earth and he
[1:05:19] and it represents life and a triumph
[1:05:21] being but now
[1:05:22] the next step in the evolution of god's
[1:05:26] creation
[1:05:27] in the next creation was the beginning
[1:05:29] of the creation of god
[1:05:30] it is a new creation man and god now
[1:05:33] meet
[1:05:35] the capping of the the capstone it's the
[1:05:38] capstone now united with humanity
[1:05:40] to make one beautiful creation
[1:05:44] oh hallelujah he was a new creation
[1:05:47] i think even brother branham used the
[1:05:48] language it's not adam just patched up
[1:05:51] right not adam just kind of with some
[1:05:54] new clothes on come here adam let's give
[1:05:56] you a makeover ah
[1:05:58] this wasn't some kind of remodeling job
[1:06:01] we're
[1:06:01] kind of all brought into the room all
[1:06:02] right open your eyes you're like oh
[1:06:05] it looks so different that's just
[1:06:07] something that's been patched up
[1:06:09] listen i don't want i just don't want
[1:06:11] this house to get a chip in joanne's
[1:06:13] makeover
[1:06:14] i want a new one no in this one covering
[1:06:18] up some old moldy studs
[1:06:19] i want a new body to match a new soul
[1:06:23] clean inside and out completely
[1:06:25] renovated
[1:06:27] completely changed in its atoms so he
[1:06:30] was of the new creation
[1:06:32] man and god met and joined together the
[1:06:34] first of a new race a new species
[1:06:36] using that word he's the head of this
[1:06:38] new race
[1:06:39] god then if he created again god had
[1:06:41] created something
[1:06:44] greater second adam's greater than the
[1:06:47] first
[1:06:49] although adam typed christ although adam
[1:06:52] foreshadowed christ
[1:06:53] he's not greater than christ first
[1:06:56] corinthians 15 45 to 47 i have
[1:06:58] i must go quickly here as so it is
[1:07:00] written the first man
[1:07:02] adam was made a living soul what does
[1:07:05] that connect him with
[1:07:06] it connects him with the earth he's made
[1:07:09] a living soul he has life just like the
[1:07:11] animals
[1:07:12] when adam has made a living soul he now
[1:07:14] is that spirit adam in a body
[1:07:17] and now adam in the completion of the
[1:07:19] man his
[1:07:20] soul spirit body the only difference
[1:07:24] from him and the rest of animal life is
[1:07:26] he has a soul
[1:07:28] and so but he's now has this affinity to
[1:07:30] the earth his body's come from the earth
[1:07:32] he has this uh affinity to animal life
[1:07:34] he's called a living soul this is
[1:07:36] remarkable
[1:07:37] god ordains him as a living soul to be
[1:07:39] the preeminent living soul over all
[1:07:40] creation
[1:07:41] that's the commandment in genesis 1
[1:07:43] 29-31 this is the commandment that he's
[1:07:46] to live under
[1:07:46] the first adam was made a living soul
[1:07:48] and you could just put a butt in here
[1:07:50] but
[1:07:51] but the scripture has just a semi-colon
[1:07:53] the way we haven't written out
[1:07:54] the last adam was made a quickening
[1:07:57] spirit
[1:07:59] that's different one thing to be a
[1:08:02] living soul
[1:08:03] being something totally different to be
[1:08:05] a quickening spirit
[1:08:07] it's one thing to be living another
[1:08:10] thing to be life-giving
[1:08:12] adam was made a living soul christ is
[1:08:14] made a life-giver
[1:08:16] adam was made alive christ makes you
[1:08:19] live
[1:08:20] what's greater it's greater to be one
[1:08:22] that can give life to be life-giving
[1:08:24] to just be merely living oh hallelujah
[1:08:27] christ was made a quickening spirit how
[1:08:29] be it that was not first which is
[1:08:31] spiritual but that which is natural
[1:08:33] and afterward that which is spiritual
[1:08:34] talk about first man adam
[1:08:36] second man christ the first man is of
[1:08:39] the earth
[1:08:40] earthly adam the second man is the lord
[1:08:42] from heaven
[1:08:45] now why would god do it that way
[1:08:49] god principles of redemption require it
[1:08:52] and then also for us to understand
[1:08:56] we all come by first birth natural
[1:09:00] but we need a second birth supernatural
[1:09:05] it's in there that we not get
[1:09:06] discouraged listen anything you could
[1:09:08] complain about any sin
[1:09:09] any temptation any weakness i i know
[1:09:11] this gets some people getting oh it's
[1:09:13] kind of maybe that pentecostal in them
[1:09:14] they don't believe in predestination
[1:09:15] they go
[1:09:16] oh don't go there you're going to make
[1:09:17] them so predestinated they're just going
[1:09:18] to sin every day of their life
[1:09:20] no no no no a revelation of
[1:09:21] predestination delivers you from sin
[1:09:23] amen
[1:09:24] you're like wait a minute i'm ordained
[1:09:26] from the beginning to be sinless then i
[1:09:28] want to start
[1:09:29] sinning i don't want to do it anymore i
[1:09:30] want to stop it
[1:09:32] it doesn't drive people into more on
[1:09:34] goddess and more filthiness no
[1:09:35] preach predestination preach it sure
[1:09:38] preach it plain
[1:09:40] listen so i can say this with absolute
[1:09:42] shirt to the elect
[1:09:43] all your ups and downs and in and outs
[1:09:45] and backslidings and doubts and
[1:09:47] weaknesses
[1:09:48] that's a product of the first birth
[1:09:52] it's there you're sticky you've got
[1:09:53] hooks in your elbows however you want to
[1:09:55] say it
[1:09:56] but listen to be born again from above
[1:09:59] put you in connection not with just a
[1:10:01] living soul
[1:10:02] but a quickened spirit and we feed this
[1:10:06] flesh with our doubt we feed our first
[1:10:07] birth by listening to false doctrine
[1:10:09] and the reasonings of man let this
[1:10:12] message raise you
[1:10:13] up out of first birth mentality and let
[1:10:15] the mind of christ have preeminence in
[1:10:17] you
[1:10:19] that's why even the perverting of the
[1:10:21] teachings of how a son of god comes into
[1:10:23] the image
[1:10:24] of christ it tries to bring you into
[1:10:27] bondage and legalism and keep you broken
[1:10:29] so you always need some man to fix you
[1:10:32] but listen meet christ
[1:10:34] get the inside teacher
[1:10:38] the first man is of the earth the second
[1:10:41] man is the lord of heaven it says
[1:10:44] earlier in that chapter first
[1:10:45] corinthians 15 22 for as in
[1:10:46] adam all die
[1:10:50] that's where that's where we get that's
[1:10:51] that's what adam does for us
[1:10:54] we all die in adam even so in christ
[1:10:57] shall all be made alive
[1:11:01] something about this life-giver
[1:11:03] something about this quickener romans 5
[1:11:05] 12 wherefore
[1:11:06] as by one man's sin entered in the world
[1:11:08] referring to adam
[1:11:10] and death by sin and so death
[1:11:13] passed upon all men for that all
[1:11:16] have sinned this is because of adam
[1:11:20] the first man the first human humanity
[1:11:23] so adam
[1:11:24] has allowed sin to enter humanity so now
[1:11:26] death by sin
[1:11:27] so death passed upon all men for that
[1:11:30] all
[1:11:31] have sinned that's man that's adam
[1:11:34] that's you and i by first birth we've
[1:11:37] been reading
[1:11:38] romans 3 23 for all have sinned adam
[1:11:41] sinned we've all sinned
[1:11:42] in adam by one man's sin entered and
[1:11:45] come short of the glory of god
[1:11:47] that includes adam
[1:11:51] adam fell short of the glory of god we
[1:11:54] all fall short of the glory of god
[1:11:56] because of sin
[1:11:57] but christ is the expressed
[1:12:01] image of his glory
[1:12:04] so it says in romans 8 3 for what the
[1:12:07] law could not do and that it was weak
[1:12:08] through the flesh
[1:12:09] just men keeping ordinances god sending
[1:12:13] his own son
[1:12:14] notice how beautiful this is i hope that
[1:12:16] you can fully grasp this and i
[1:12:18] i'll go ahead and just tell you what
[1:12:19] you're thinking i know i've preached
[1:12:20] over an hour at this point but i really
[1:12:22] hope this really strikes you
[1:12:23] god sent in his own son in the likeness
[1:12:27] of sinful flesh
[1:12:29] the likeness of simplifies it resembled
[1:12:31] sinful flesh but it wasn't
[1:12:33] sinful flesh it just looked like it
[1:12:36] because
[1:12:36] in the likeness of sinful flesh was the
[1:12:39] express
[1:12:40] image of the glory of god oh that gives
[1:12:43] me hope
[1:12:44] that gives me hope that this flesh
[1:12:46] though it looks like a man who's fallen
[1:12:49] the express image of christ can be seen
[1:12:52] in me
[1:12:54] god sending his own son in the likeness
[1:12:57] of sinful flesh
[1:12:58] and foresin condemned sin in the flesh
[1:13:02] what a beautiful love story
[1:13:07] he was in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:13:09] and then what did he do he didn't sin
[1:13:11] he took it on he didn't sin he became it
[1:13:15] by hanging on a cross in the likeness of
[1:13:19] sinful flesh but sinless
[1:13:22] why he was a different creation
[1:13:26] it was a different specie a new creation
[1:13:31] all man and all god
[1:13:36] the bible says in second corinthians 5
[1:13:38] 19 to wit that god
[1:13:40] was in christ reckless
[1:13:43] reconciling the world what world the
[1:13:46] world that god had created
[1:13:47] the world that god loved everything
[1:13:50] embodied in the perfect garden of eden
[1:13:52] that's the world that god loved
[1:13:54] why because the bible says if you love
[1:13:55] the world and the things the word the
[1:13:56] love of god is not in you
[1:13:58] so it's not all the cosmos not all the
[1:14:01] things that are worldly and in the world
[1:14:02] but the world that god loved the world
[1:14:04] he wanted to reconcile
[1:14:05] is in the beginning god created the
[1:14:07] world the heavens and the earth
[1:14:09] and all the things that were therein by
[1:14:11] the original spoken word the seeds that
[1:14:13] are laying there that's how what god
[1:14:14] wanted to reconcile
[1:14:16] how is he going to do it by this last
[1:14:18] step evolution
[1:14:19] where now man and god become one and
[1:14:22] when
[1:14:22] that happens when it seals what does it
[1:14:24] do it redeems the whole thing
[1:14:27] just something tran something connects
[1:14:30] and now a way is made the breach is gone
[1:14:33] man and god can be joined together in
[1:14:35] the
[1:14:36] to achieve what god had in his heart in
[1:14:39] the beginning
[1:14:42] was a new creation god in christ god and
[1:14:44] man perfectly joined
[1:14:46] the beginning of a new species he was
[1:14:48] the first
[1:14:49] man of a new brother man uses the term
[1:14:52] race but again
[1:14:53] new race to define something different
[1:14:55] than mankind or humanity
[1:15:01] let me just find orient myself
[1:15:08] here
[1:15:11] we had to uh pause a few services so
[1:15:14] i've got to somehow
[1:15:15] fit i got to find a way to capture back
[1:15:17] those three services we lost so i might
[1:15:19] just
[1:15:20] i'll grab a little bit from that sunday
[1:15:21] we didn't have if you don't mind
[1:15:25] doesn't mean i'm going to preach four
[1:15:27] hours
[1:15:29] i could no question that's definitely
[1:15:32] possible to be the group like you guys
[1:15:34] people someone said the other day man
[1:15:36] you preached more than an hour you know
[1:15:37] i think i said my dad would leave or
[1:15:39] something like that and i'm like
[1:15:40] uh is he wanting to visit anytime soon
[1:15:45] now an identified masterpiece of god
[1:15:48] i'll try to read through these quickly
[1:15:49] because i want you to catch this
[1:15:52] the image of christ he was so much in
[1:15:53] the image of god until him and god
[1:15:55] became one
[1:15:56] i and my father are one what a living
[1:15:59] that was for god to so live in him
[1:16:02] that his whole life was wrapped in god
[1:16:04] no wonder it was a masterpiece
[1:16:06] satan come to him every time god thought
[1:16:08] he had a masterpiece
[1:16:10] satan got in adam and the woman
[1:16:14] god's first masterpiece he god and moses
[1:16:16] he broke the commandments
[1:16:18] but when he come to this masterpiece
[1:16:20] that was god's own
[1:16:22] choosing why god had appointed this one
[1:16:24] to be the firstborn
[1:16:25] god appointed this one to be the first
[1:16:27] begotten god had appointed this one to
[1:16:29] be the heir of all things
[1:16:30] he had foreigned him it didn't do him
[1:16:33] satan no good
[1:16:35] he stayed true to god when god looked at
[1:16:37] him and seen he was tempted 40 days in
[1:16:38] the wilderness like moses of course
[1:16:40] all those men foreshadowed him the law
[1:16:42] was broken but when he satan
[1:16:44] the great tempter and tried to tempt him
[1:16:46] he found
[1:16:47] he didn't find moses there no sir he had
[1:16:50] a 5 000 watt volt that singed his wings
[1:16:52] when he jumped up against that one
[1:16:54] it is written he said adam took
[1:16:57] down but jesus ii out of the masterpiece
[1:17:00] that had been come for the redeemer
[1:17:02] he said it is written man shall not live
[1:17:04] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:17:06] proceeds out of the mouth of god
[1:17:08] there he had a masterpiece yes sir he
[1:17:10] said something else he said it's also
[1:17:12] written thou shalt not tempt the lord
[1:17:14] thy god
[1:17:14] get thee hint satan there was a
[1:17:17] masterpiece
[1:17:19] he said it is written that's what he put
[1:17:21] his first adam behind
[1:17:24] and he fell and satan marred it but he
[1:17:26] could not mar
[1:17:28] this one no matter what he done in so
[1:17:31] much so god said
[1:17:32] this is my beloved son hear ye him
[1:17:36] everything i give everything over to him
[1:17:38] you hear him
[1:17:39] they were one they were the same one
[1:17:44] god lived in him making him god emmanuel
[1:17:47] on earth
[1:17:48] he was a perfect lamb all the perfect
[1:17:51] masterpiece
[1:17:52] of redemption
[1:17:56] now he says adam satan came to adam and
[1:17:59] through the
[1:17:59] temptation when he put his first adam
[1:18:01] behind that
[1:18:03] he fell in satan martin why he put adam
[1:18:06] behind the word
[1:18:08] right and as long as they stayed behind
[1:18:11] the word
[1:18:12] they wouldn't fall but satan could tempt
[1:18:14] him
[1:18:15] and it was possible that they step
[1:18:18] outside
[1:18:19] of the word because they were behind the
[1:18:21] word the conditional covenant if you
[1:18:23] don't do this they were behind the word
[1:18:24] but now with abraham god makes an
[1:18:27] unconditional covenant
[1:18:29] and it's i will but who is the covenant
[1:18:33] with
[1:18:34] the seed after him and the seed was not
[1:18:39] too many as israel jacob and judah and
[1:18:41] all these different ones
[1:18:42] but to one christ so the unconditional
[1:18:45] covenants to christ
[1:18:46] i will so he doesn't just place christ
[1:18:49] behind the word
[1:18:50] the word becomes christ the word is in
[1:18:54] christ i can stand behind this pulpit
[1:18:57] use your imagination
[1:18:58] if you put this pulpit in me i can't get
[1:19:01] out from behind it
[1:19:03] why not become part of it that's why it
[1:19:06] says you cannot mar
[1:19:08] this one they were one
[1:19:11] in god's power to transform he says and
[1:19:13] satan tried and tried
[1:19:15] again do everything one night laying in
[1:19:17] the back of the ship
[1:19:18] he seen him asleep he said i'll destroy
[1:19:20] him right now but he couldn't
[1:19:24] he tried to tempt him into doing the
[1:19:25] wrong thing but he couldn't do it
[1:19:27] why christ now he'd been sprayed with
[1:19:30] the repellent of
[1:19:32] predestination now what have you been
[1:19:35] sprayed with
[1:19:37] that's what did it are you predestined
[1:19:40] are you predestinated are you ordained
[1:19:43] are you elect you've been sprayed with
[1:19:45] the same thing
[1:19:46] hallelujah listen we've got the oil
[1:19:50] there's only one essential oil
[1:19:54] i don't mean to offend anybody i'm not
[1:19:55] talking doterra young living or anything
[1:19:57] else somebody wants to create
[1:19:58] the only essential oil is the baptism of
[1:20:01] the holy ghost
[1:20:02] wherein you become baptized in the body
[1:20:05] of christ and only those
[1:20:06] who've been sprayed with the repellent
[1:20:09] of predestination
[1:20:13] i put lavender well elizabeth sister
[1:20:15] listen puts lavender on my big toe if
[1:20:17] i'm not feeling well
[1:20:18] so i i'm i'm not preaching against
[1:20:20] essential oils
[1:20:22] one of the funniest things i've ever
[1:20:23] seen was a medic a cartoon of a medic
[1:20:26] on a battlefield treating a wounded
[1:20:27] soldier all shot shot up he goes
[1:20:29] he touched me says don't worry i've got
[1:20:31] some lavender oil
[1:20:33] on you and he goes i feel it working
[1:20:34] already i'm calm
[1:20:38] sprayed with the repellent of
[1:20:39] predestination
[1:20:41] it can't be deceived go back to that
[1:20:44] statement
[1:20:45] he's been sprayed with repellent of
[1:20:47] predestination it
[1:20:48] can't be deceived no no the word said
[1:20:51] he'd be here but not only he but
[1:20:55] she not only him but you the word
[1:20:58] said she would be here sprayed with the
[1:21:00] repellent of predestination
[1:21:02] the bible says in romans 8 29 to 31 for
[1:21:05] whom he did for no
[1:21:06] he also did predestinate he foreknew you
[1:21:09] therefore he predestinated you
[1:21:11] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:21:15] his son is the expressed image of the
[1:21:18] glory of god
[1:21:19] now you likewise become a bear of the
[1:21:22] image of god
[1:21:23] why by predestination
[1:21:26] thanks be to god he's also predestinated
[1:21:29] you to be changed quick and translated
[1:21:31] transformed
[1:21:32] into the image of his son who is the
[1:21:34] expressed image of his person
[1:21:37] why so that christ would be the
[1:21:39] firstborn
[1:21:40] among many brethren same parent
[1:21:48] same thing so if you have a recipe and
[1:21:50] you make pancakes on sunday
[1:21:52] and then you make they use the same
[1:21:53] recipe and you make pancakes the next
[1:21:55] morning it's the same thing
[1:21:57] why same same material same process
[1:22:01] so then christ is a new creation
[1:22:05] deity in flesh and then if he's going to
[1:22:08] have a brother
[1:22:10] right you can't make pancake water or
[1:22:14] you know you can't make pumpkin waffles
[1:22:17] and say it's the same thing as the
[1:22:18] buckwheat pancakes you made the day
[1:22:20] before
[1:22:21] different recipe different thing but now
[1:22:23] this is a new creation
[1:22:25] and then we likewise predestined to
[1:22:28] become in the image of his son
[1:22:29] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:22:31] many brethren
[1:22:33] and then he says this moreover whom he
[1:22:35] did predestinate
[1:22:36] them he also called and whom he called
[1:22:38] them he also justified
[1:22:40] and whom he justified them he also
[1:22:42] glorified
[1:22:45] the image of being justified but not
[1:22:48] sanctified
[1:22:49] and sanctified and not sealed with the
[1:22:51] holy ghost
[1:22:52] and there be any chance to fall short
[1:22:55] only applies to the make-believer who
[1:22:57] confesses justification
[1:22:59] and confesses sanctification but to the
[1:23:02] elect
[1:23:02] you can not miss it
[1:23:06] if you are justified you by scripture
[1:23:10] are already glorified by scripture if
[1:23:13] you are sanctified you are already
[1:23:15] perfect
[1:23:16] you have perfected forever them that are
[1:23:19] sanctified
[1:23:20] him that have been justified they're
[1:23:21] already glorified why you've been
[1:23:23] sprayed
[1:23:24] with the repellent of predestination you
[1:23:27] can not miss it if i'm justified i'm
[1:23:31] already glorified i might as well walk
[1:23:32] into my sanctification
[1:23:34] i might are you might as well walk into
[1:23:36] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:23:37] why i'm ordained to it
[1:23:43] he's already glorified you if you're
[1:23:44] justified what shall we say then to
[1:23:47] these things
[1:23:48] what things anything anything
[1:23:52] if god before us who can be against us
[1:23:57] he's for you if god before you
[1:24:01] who can be against you let them
[1:24:02] withstand you let them lie about you
[1:24:05] whether it be health whether it be a lie
[1:24:07] whether it be rumor whether it be found
[1:24:08] let it stand
[1:24:09] it will fall why if god before us
[1:24:14] and so much is meant in that not that
[1:24:17] he's just on your side but he's in you
[1:24:19] he is you improving his word he was the
[1:24:23] beginner of the creation of god god and
[1:24:24] creation god with a little part of the
[1:24:26] creation here that god was living in
[1:24:27] himself
[1:24:28] he was the beginning of that creation of
[1:24:30] god from him begets
[1:24:32] many sons so this new creation
[1:24:36] is going to be surrounded by others who
[1:24:38] have the same material
[1:24:41] so the bible says in second corinthians
[1:24:42] 5 17 therefore if any man be
[1:24:44] in christ he is a new creature
[1:24:48] a new creation old things are passed
[1:24:52] away
[1:24:53] behold all things are become
[1:24:56] new all things are become
[1:25:00] new this is a promise saints any man be
[1:25:03] in christ how do you get in christ by
[1:25:04] one spirit you're baptized in the body
[1:25:06] of christ
[1:25:07] and when that happens all things become
[1:25:10] new it speaks that you have now
[1:25:12] left pure humanity and you're coming
[1:25:16] into fellowship with deity
[1:25:18] and now when you speak deity speaking
[1:25:22] now it's christ being formed in you
[1:25:25] now there's something that's connected
[1:25:28] you you've bridged the gap
[1:25:30] you've come to the missing link it's
[1:25:31] been your your person
[1:25:33] is being perfected oh it's so wonderful
[1:25:36] to be born again
[1:25:39] brother branham in the church age book
[1:25:40] says he was of the new creation
[1:25:43] man and god met and joined together he
[1:25:46] was the first of this new race
[1:25:48] he is the head of this new race then he
[1:25:50] quotes second corinthians 5
[1:25:52] 17 if any man be in christ so now you
[1:25:55] are connected to this
[1:25:56] he's a new creature all things are
[1:25:58] passed away behold all things have
[1:25:59] become new
[1:26:00] it says there you can see that though
[1:26:02] man was of the old order or creation
[1:26:06] now in union with christ he has become
[1:26:09] the new creation of god he quotes
[1:26:12] ephesians 2 10 for we are his
[1:26:14] workmanship
[1:26:15] created in union with christ jesus unto
[1:26:18] good works
[1:26:19] ephesians 4 24 and that ye put on the
[1:26:22] new man
[1:26:23] which is after god
[1:26:26] is created in righteousness and true
[1:26:28] holiness
[1:26:29] as this is the new man you're created
[1:26:32] anew by the new birth you are a new man
[1:26:34] after god created in god's image
[1:26:37] not just in his likeness but now you're
[1:26:40] an
[1:26:41] image of god so he says the new creation
[1:26:45] is
[1:26:45] not the old creation made over it or it
[1:26:48] could not be called a new creation
[1:26:51] if it was adam patched up and renovated
[1:26:54] if it was adam just with a little
[1:26:56] something a little bit of flavor and
[1:26:57] added in
[1:26:58] this is not the new creation then but
[1:27:00] the new creation is not the old creation
[1:27:02] made over it could not be called a new
[1:27:04] creation
[1:27:05] this is exactly what it says it is new
[1:27:07] creation
[1:27:08] it is a another creation distinct from
[1:27:11] the old one
[1:27:12] now let's pause take a deep breath i'm
[1:27:13] not doing this for myself now
[1:27:16] but who's he talking about you
[1:27:19] he's quoted second corinthians 5 in a
[1:27:21] man being christ he's a new creature
[1:27:23] ephesians 2 10
[1:27:24] we are his workmanship created in christ
[1:27:25] jesus ephesians 4 24 that ye put on the
[1:27:28] new man
[1:27:29] so he's not talking about jesus anymore
[1:27:30] he's talking about you the brethren that
[1:27:32] were to come
[1:27:34] he says this is another creation
[1:27:35] distinct from the old one no longer is
[1:27:37] he dealing by ways of the flesh that's
[1:27:38] how he dealt with israel he chose
[1:27:40] abraham and of abraham's issue through
[1:27:42] the godly isaac line
[1:27:43] but now out of every kindred tribe and
[1:27:46] nation he's purposed a new creation
[1:27:48] he is the first of that creation he was
[1:27:51] created in the form of man
[1:27:53] now by his spirit he's creating many
[1:27:56] sons
[1:27:57] unto himself god the creator created
[1:28:00] himself
[1:28:01] a part of his creation now this is my
[1:28:04] words now
[1:28:04] in who in creating sons and daughters of
[1:28:08] god
[1:28:08] by a new birth god the creator created
[1:28:12] himself in a part of his new creation
[1:28:13] this is the true revelation of god this
[1:28:16] was
[1:28:16] his purpose colossians 3
[1:28:20] 10 and have put on this is us now by
[1:28:22] virtue of the new birth and have put on
[1:28:24] the new man which is created in the
[1:28:26] image of god
[1:28:27] which is renewed in knowledge after the
[1:28:30] image of him
[1:28:31] that created him
[1:28:34] wow you put on a new man renewed in
[1:28:38] knowledge
[1:28:39] what's this knowledge after what's this
[1:28:41] mind after it's after the image of him
[1:28:44] that created you
[1:28:45] the image it's derived from
[1:28:49] it's the likeness just like a child
[1:28:51] bears the image of a parent
[1:28:55] in that in that image it's not divisible
[1:28:58] from him you can't take it out the child
[1:29:00] bears the image he just doesn't resemble
[1:29:03] somebody
[1:29:04] he's in the image of somebody god having
[1:29:07] children
[1:29:08] does not have men he has god daughters
[1:29:11] god sons
[1:29:15] and the revelation of jesus christ
[1:29:16] personally to you quickens you
[1:29:18] to what a higher life a new life
[1:29:24] a new man this new man is christ
[1:29:27] formed in the believer it's the image of
[1:29:31] god being formed in flesh think of all
[1:29:33] the scriptures you could start using
[1:29:34] to support them and i
[1:29:38] want to close with this uh
[1:29:41] this is my closing thought i'm not
[1:29:43] closing it's my closing thought
[1:29:48] i'll try to make this very quick it's
[1:29:49] just a lengthy statement i want to read
[1:29:51] here in a moment
[1:29:52] so in god so that we see them that we
[1:29:54] are new creations
[1:29:56] created new in christ
[1:30:00] this is god now creating again as it
[1:30:02] were
[1:30:04] but in this new creation you know what's
[1:30:07] foreshadowed in the beginning
[1:30:10] the new creation is portrayed in the
[1:30:12] first creation of man
[1:30:14] because god makes man in his image and
[1:30:17] after his likeness
[1:30:20] but now there's a knowledge that we're
[1:30:23] the new man is renewed in knowledge
[1:30:25] after the image of him that created him
[1:30:28] second corinthians 4 6 for god
[1:30:30] who commanded the light to shine out of
[1:30:32] darkness
[1:30:33] so now he's going back to in the
[1:30:34] beginning when god spoke
[1:30:36] and commanded light to shine out of
[1:30:38] darkness he now says
[1:30:39] hath shined in our hearts by what spoken
[1:30:42] word creation again
[1:30:44] just as god created in the beginning
[1:30:46] what did we see it was foreshadowing
[1:30:47] the creation that god would do in you
[1:30:49] light driving away darkness
[1:30:51] to give the light of the knowledge of
[1:30:53] the glory of god
[1:30:54] in the face of jesus christ your new
[1:30:58] creations foreshadowed
[1:30:59] in the beginning when god created
[1:31:03] brother braham says in god's provided
[1:31:05] place of worship you are then not
[1:31:07] yourself
[1:31:07] you are a new creature for the greek
[1:31:09] there means a new creation
[1:31:11] you've been recreated again the power of
[1:31:14] god comes upon you
[1:31:16] and you become created a new creature
[1:31:19] which brings the whole physical being
[1:31:21] spiritual being in everything
[1:31:22] in subject to the word of god no
[1:31:26] other way that's the promise
[1:31:31] you are created new a new creature
[1:31:35] as so then as the second adam which the
[1:31:38] bible says is the lord of heaven
[1:31:40] is more glorious than the first man of
[1:31:42] earth right
[1:31:44] so is god's image created in us by the
[1:31:47] new birth
[1:31:48] greater than the image that adam held
[1:31:53] if the second adam was more glorious
[1:31:56] than the first man of earth
[1:31:57] then we by a new birth
[1:32:00] created in the image of god by the new
[1:32:02] birth it's a more glorious image
[1:32:04] than the image that adam held
[1:32:09] it's just afternoon
[1:32:13] let me read this statement from the
[1:32:14] church age book brother braham says in
[1:32:16] revelations 2 8 these things saith the
[1:32:18] first
[1:32:18] and the last which was dead and is alive
[1:32:21] and the brother man says
[1:32:22] now these are not the words of a man
[1:32:26] a mere man could he speak from the grave
[1:32:28] could he speak from the grave would say
[1:32:30] i am the first and the last which was
[1:32:32] alive and is dead
[1:32:35] right he has an end the first thing that
[1:32:38] happens to a man is that he is born
[1:32:40] is alive and the last thing that happens
[1:32:41] to him is that he dies but this is one
[1:32:43] where he says was dead
[1:32:44] and is alive so he says so this is not a
[1:32:47] man speaking this is deity
[1:32:48] now as brother brahman starts doing the
[1:32:50] contrast remember how brother brahman
[1:32:51] says
[1:32:52] on one hand the woman is this on the
[1:32:53] other hand the woman is that right one
[1:32:55] hand she's foul on the other hand she's
[1:32:56] glorious and virtuous now
[1:32:57] brother man's going to do the same thing
[1:32:59] and he says man adam
[1:33:01] took life and turned it into death but
[1:33:03] this man jesus took death and turned it
[1:33:05] into life
[1:33:06] adam took innocence and turned it into
[1:33:08] guilt this one took guilt and turned it
[1:33:09] into righteousness
[1:33:10] adam took a paradise and turned it into
[1:33:12] a waste howling wilderness
[1:33:14] but this one is coming back to turn an
[1:33:16] earth rocking and reeling with
[1:33:17] destruction into another eden
[1:33:19] adam took a life of fellowship and joy
[1:33:21] with god and turned it into a desert a
[1:33:23] spiritual darkness that brought forth
[1:33:24] all sin
[1:33:25] moral decay pain suffering delusion and
[1:33:27] corruption that wars within the souls of
[1:33:28] men
[1:33:29] but this one from all the tragic death
[1:33:32] and degradation that filled mankind
[1:33:34] brought forth a life of righteousness
[1:33:36] and beauty so that as sin once reigned
[1:33:39] unto death even so might
[1:33:40] men now reign in righteousness by one
[1:33:44] christ jesus oh
[1:33:47] hallelujah thank god for the gift of his
[1:33:50] son
[1:33:52] thank god that he's not just another
[1:33:54] adam not just another prophet not just
[1:33:56] another man
[1:33:57] that was redeemed by the blood of god
[1:33:59] listen don't make the mistake of
[1:34:00] preaching some third adam doctrine
[1:34:03] jesus christ is the last adam brother
[1:34:06] branham is not the third adam some
[1:34:08] prophet from africa is not the third
[1:34:10] adam there's not a third or a fourth or
[1:34:11] fifth or sixth adam
[1:34:12] there's the last adam jesus christ
[1:34:18] listen when you recognize him you don't
[1:34:19] need an eighth messenger
[1:34:22] when the seventh introduces you to
[1:34:24] christ you don't get an eight
[1:34:26] you don't come to an eighth messenger
[1:34:28] amen you're not looking around for
[1:34:30] something to come back and be used again
[1:34:32] you've been married to christ
[1:34:37] so let's just look at it here i'm not
[1:34:39] going to read it you just look at it
[1:34:40] here genesis chapter 1 verses 26 to 28
[1:34:43] god said let us make man in our image
[1:34:45] and after our likeness
[1:34:47] you realize that's prophecy again
[1:34:51] partly expressed in adam so god when he
[1:34:54] speaks he's not only prophesying
[1:34:56] the creation of man the first creation
[1:35:00] of humanity
[1:35:01] but he's also prophesying the new
[1:35:03] creation of himself
[1:35:05] because adam came in the likeness god
[1:35:07] with the resemblance of god
[1:35:08] but there was going to come one who was
[1:35:10] god
[1:35:12] was the god man so in the beginning god
[1:35:14] created man in genesis 1
[1:35:16] which typed the beginning of the
[1:35:19] creation of god
[1:35:20] brother graham says adam was a type of
[1:35:22] christ in every figure
[1:35:24] he says the first adam and eve typed the
[1:35:25] second adam and eve what was it a type
[1:35:28] it was always a type
[1:35:31] and brother branham said this i thought
[1:35:33] i had this earlier in my notes i might
[1:35:34] have skipped right over it
[1:35:36] but i wanted to read it again at the
[1:35:37] close but listen what brother braham
[1:35:38] says then about
[1:35:39] adam and christ he says satan couldn't
[1:35:42] cross him up
[1:35:44] talking about adam satan crossed
[1:35:47] adam or talking about christ satan
[1:35:49] crossed adam up
[1:35:51] right but now he says satan couldn't
[1:35:54] cross him up no no
[1:35:55] he was a different type of adam
[1:36:00] wouldn't it it wasn't adam again he's
[1:36:01] different than adam christ
[1:36:03] the original seat of genesis 1 is what a
[1:36:06] new man adam typed him adam may have
[1:36:10] looked like him he may have looked like
[1:36:12] adam
[1:36:12] adam may have foreshadowed him adam may
[1:36:14] have portrayed him might adam might have
[1:36:16] acted
[1:36:16] out things that christ would ultimately
[1:36:18] do but christ
[1:36:20] is the full supreme perfect reflection
[1:36:24] of god
[1:36:25] as a god man he's the express image of
[1:36:28] his person
[1:36:29] the perfect image of the invisible god
[1:36:31] but adam only came so
[1:36:33] far and foreshadowed him
[1:36:38] so satan could cross him up
[1:36:41] adam then not being deceived though
[1:36:43] could walk out portraying foreshadowing
[1:36:45] christ
[1:36:46] but christ being the original seed he
[1:36:48] could not fall
[1:36:50] but the baby says and knoweth it not in
[1:36:52] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:36:54] when god to begin to create bring you
[1:36:57] into existence
[1:36:58] now we can look at this differently in
[1:37:00] the beginning of creation of god
[1:37:04] when did he begin to bring you into
[1:37:05] existence
[1:37:07] naturally you begin to come into
[1:37:09] existence
[1:37:10] when eve became the mother of all living
[1:37:14] but supernaturally you come into
[1:37:16] existence
[1:37:17] when genesis 1 27 begins to form in the
[1:37:19] womb of a virgin
[1:37:20] he says in the beginning of the creation
[1:37:22] of god now god begins to create
[1:37:24] and now your your genesis is in christ
[1:37:29] bring you into existence see you started
[1:37:32] back there as a seed
[1:37:33] and work down to where you are now and
[1:37:35] then you were all
[1:37:36] in christ who was the beginning of the
[1:37:39] creation god you're all in christ
[1:37:41] then when christ died he died to redeem
[1:37:43] all of you and you
[1:37:44] are a part of this word
[1:37:48] so now you you have connection you're
[1:37:50] connected to christ
[1:37:52] don't disassociate yourself from christ
[1:37:54] don't think of yourself as a
[1:37:55] step-brother
[1:37:57] god's adoption is not taking an orphan
[1:38:00] in making them a son you become
[1:38:03] you express sonship by a new birth
[1:38:07] and god's adoption is the placing and
[1:38:10] the maturing
[1:38:11] and the full revelation of who you are
[1:38:13] in christ coming into your heart
[1:38:15] word after word line after line precept
[1:38:18] after precept
[1:38:19] and a son of god coming to the full
[1:38:21] knowledge and revelation
[1:38:22] of who i am as a son and as a daughter
[1:38:25] we're not orphans we're not beggars
[1:38:30] were part of the word so he says christ
[1:38:34] was a different type of adam
[1:38:36] and then what does he say in god of this
[1:38:37] evil age about the bride she's not like
[1:38:39] eve
[1:38:41] she's not that type of a woman
[1:38:44] why you came not born between satan and
[1:38:47] the serpent
[1:38:48] you've come from christ by a new birth
[1:38:51] and he wasn't that type of atom
[1:38:53] nor you typed that that type of woman
[1:38:57] bible says in first peter 1 23 being
[1:39:00] born again
[1:39:05] born born born again thank god i'm born
[1:39:09] again don't ever let it become a little
[1:39:10] bee
[1:39:12] in a little a it's capital b capital a
[1:39:14] born again
[1:39:15] from above it puts eternal life into you
[1:39:21] being born again not of corruptible seed
[1:39:24] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[1:39:28] this word birth which
[1:39:29] liveth and abideth
[1:39:32] forever that brings you right back to
[1:39:36] the very thing that adam couldn't
[1:39:37] partake in
[1:39:39] adam was never born
[1:39:42] he says lest he reach forth and partake
[1:39:44] of the tree of life and what
[1:39:45] live forever something sealed off
[1:39:49] mankind goes into chaos humanity
[1:39:51] creation goes into chaos
[1:39:52] but one day this seed is going to come
[1:39:56] christ is going to come and then you
[1:39:58] being born
[1:39:59] from above by incorruptible seed live
[1:40:03] and abide forever
[1:40:11] i believe brother paul lovell sends out
[1:40:13] quotes on a daily basis sometimes at
[1:40:15] like three o'clock in the morning
[1:40:18] and he must be studying on the the new
[1:40:20] birth how it's see
[1:40:21] when you're born again you have eternal
[1:40:22] life you can't be separated from god
[1:40:24] because every quote's just been about
[1:40:25] the new birth
[1:40:26] and how lifting up that new birth and
[1:40:28] how important it is how preeminent is
[1:40:29] he sent this morning the statement
[1:40:32] brother man says your new life
[1:40:33] is the lamb's book of life your marriage
[1:40:36] certificate
[1:40:38] where your true eternal germ from the
[1:40:40] beginning
[1:40:41] takes hold that's what the new birth is
[1:40:44] your new life which was in the lamb's
[1:40:47] book of life
[1:40:48] where your true eternal germ from the
[1:40:50] beginning
[1:40:51] takes hold why it was always there
[1:40:57] so sister elizabeth if you could come
[1:41:03] i want to read this last statement my
[1:41:04] last my last quote
[1:41:11] in the church age book chapter 7. maybe
[1:41:14] we could sing that song in moments like
[1:41:15] these
[1:41:16] the key of c church age book chapter
[1:41:19] seven
[1:41:19] but the man says that great royal seed
[1:41:23] jesus christ
[1:41:26] was planted he died
[1:41:30] and that life that was in him came up
[1:41:32] through the wheat plant
[1:41:34] and is reproducing itself in
[1:41:37] multitudes of wheat seeds having the
[1:41:40] same life in them
[1:41:44] and being like the original because by
[1:41:47] spirit
[1:41:48] they are original
[1:41:52] now we can see why the redeemed
[1:41:56] bought back by the original owner bride
[1:41:58] the redeemed bride she was in him as eve
[1:42:01] was in adam
[1:42:02] notice those principles those are very
[1:42:04] thick heavy principles he just kind of
[1:42:06] puts in there bought back by the
[1:42:07] original owner there's redemption
[1:42:09] the bride was in him as eve was in adam
[1:42:12] so it's got to be the same material same
[1:42:13] life same bone same creation
[1:42:16] now we can see why the redeemed bride
[1:42:18] cannot ever have her member names taken
[1:42:20] off the record
[1:42:23] she is part of him she
[1:42:26] is in the throne she can never
[1:42:29] be judged everyone in the bride
[1:42:33] is a member of him and he
[1:42:36] loses none
[1:42:40] eliot has a shirt that says when some
[1:42:42] lose none
[1:42:43] christ got the same thing he
[1:42:46] loses none all
[1:42:50] that the father hath given me will come
[1:42:53] he will lose he will not lose one
[1:42:57] why they've been spread with the
[1:42:59] repellent of predestination
[1:43:01] that's why satan has not taken there's
[1:43:03] no depth of sin
[1:43:04] there's no depth of corruption there's
[1:43:06] nothing too great
[1:43:08] that this love of god can't reach down
[1:43:10] path
[1:43:11] and redeem an elect seed of god i say
[1:43:14] stand upon the promise
[1:43:15] use your own life as an example if he
[1:43:18] could redeem me
[1:43:19] he could redeem the worst the lost
[1:43:21] whoever it is
[1:43:22] while god will lose not one
[1:43:27] every one in the bride is a member of
[1:43:29] him and he loses
[1:43:31] none i'm resting in that
[1:43:36] i rest that i will not let the devil
[1:43:40] bring
[1:43:40] fear condemnation doubt i won't let it
[1:43:43] work he's got no room to work in that
[1:43:44] way
[1:43:46] the only thing the devil can do is just
[1:43:48] remind you that there's more work to be
[1:43:49] done
[1:43:51] thanks for reminding me devil there's

[1:44:50] pullers and listeners to let me deliver
[1:44:53] this burden with this link
[1:44:56] just thank you i appreciate it
[1:44:59] let's bow our heads
[1:45:03] we're going to bow our heads and speak
[1:45:04] to the almighty god
[1:45:09] not as a beggar not as an orphan
[1:45:14] but as his image
[1:45:18] the bible talks about us if we look into
[1:45:19] the bible he says brother branham said
[1:45:21] you're looking at
[1:45:22] god christ face to face and then what
[1:45:25] did paul say we were looking into
[1:45:26] a mirror so if we're looking into a
[1:45:30] mirror and we see ourselves what does
[1:45:31] god see when he sees you
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:45:34] he sees himself so you're not coming to
[1:45:37] him as an orphan you're not coming to
[1:45:39] him as a beggar
[1:45:40] when we pray this morning don't beg ask
[1:45:44] we kind of say it just to be a little
[1:45:46] bit pen with our grammar but when our
[1:45:48] kids say
[1:45:48] can i have a drink he said i don't know
[1:45:50] can you because we're wanting him just
[1:45:52] to ask
[1:45:54] don't worry about ability he can just
[1:45:56] ask
[1:45:58] just ask whatever you have need of today
[1:46:01] just ask
[1:46:02] not as orphans not as beggars not as
[1:46:06] children who've been merely adopted into
[1:46:08] a family and taken on a name know you've
[1:46:10] been ordained
[1:46:11] to obtain an inheritance by election by
[1:46:14] origination
[1:46:16] by image not resemblance you are bone of
[1:46:19] his bone flesh of his flesh
[1:46:21] life of his life you are a part of the
[1:46:23] word you are in the image of him that
[1:46:25] created all things
[1:46:27] you are as his daughter as his son
[1:46:30] in his image when he sees you he sees
[1:46:33] himself
[1:46:35] and he cannot deny himself
[1:46:38] so you can ask today there's so many
[1:46:41] needs that i desire to ask for
[1:46:43] that would it be for the correa family
[1:46:45] and sister ruth's father
[1:46:46] and her brother the pastor of jericho
[1:46:49] tabernacle
[1:46:50] i think of brother homer longoria sister
[1:46:52] erica
[1:46:53] uh parker's going in for treatment for
[1:46:55] her sickness and i think of all these
[1:46:57] different ones that are sick and needy
[1:46:59] and body's sister sandy contradicts
[1:47:01] i believe god's gonna bring her to this
[1:47:02] church he's gonna bring her
[1:47:04] forward and she's gonna believe she's
[1:47:05] gonna walk in her healing there's so
[1:47:07] many different
[1:47:08] needs i believe that we should just ask
[1:47:09] believing he's the same
[1:47:11] yesterday today and forever if you want
[1:47:13] deliverance this morning
[1:47:15] lift up hands that are free let those
[1:47:17] broken chains hold you back no longer
[1:47:20] there's something you desire come before
[1:47:22] god say god i believe
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:27] sister gina pinkston's sister sister
[1:47:29] desiree went in for a
[1:47:31] surgery and with the complications of
[1:47:34] the surgery came
[1:47:35] within breaths of dying just a surgery
[1:47:38] that should have been
[1:47:38] perhaps routine within a few days the
[1:47:40] doctors say there's nothing we can do
[1:47:42] for she's dying
[1:47:43] how god could come and mend and heal and
[1:47:46] raise up and make well
[1:47:49] not because god's a healer because we're
[1:47:51] asking
[1:47:52] not as beggars but his bride
[1:47:55] why do we ask for these things that god
[1:47:58] would be glorified
[1:48:04] god encourage us today let's pray
[1:48:07] heavenly father we appreciate you
[1:48:12] it means more to us today to say father
[1:48:16] it means more to us to be called a son
[1:48:18] or a daughter of god
[1:48:22] lord may it be so as i expressed in the
[1:48:24] beginning my burden is that
[1:48:26] christ would come into plainer view
[1:48:29] may they fall in love may we all fall in
[1:48:32] love with christ all over
[1:48:33] again may the image become more perfect
[1:48:39] and likewise lord as you become
[1:48:42] more understood may we
[1:48:45] personally become more connected with it
[1:48:49] but i i i can believe it about the bride
[1:48:51] it's so plain it's so clear brother i'm
[1:48:53] so particular the bride the bride he
[1:48:55] names her
[1:48:56] the scriptures named this body we can
[1:48:59] say it about the body which is the
[1:49:00] fullness of christ that filleth all in
[1:49:02] all we can say it about the bride
[1:49:04] which is the lamb's wife but lord i
[1:49:07] i am in that bride
[1:49:10] may i claim it for myself for the
[1:49:12] deliverance that i
[1:49:14] desire for the health that i desire for
[1:49:16] the peace that i desire
[1:49:18] for the liberty that i desire lord may i
[1:49:20] believe
[1:49:21] in that if it applies to christ it's my
[1:49:24] inheritance because i am a joint heir
[1:49:26] with them
[1:49:27] if it applies to the bride it applies to
[1:49:30] me
[1:49:30] because i am a member of it am i
[1:49:33] standing steadfast in my justification
[1:49:35] that i never did it in the first place
[1:49:37] that my member name can never be removed
[1:49:40] from that book
[1:49:41] that you will not lose one
[1:49:45] lord i rejoice in the testimony
[1:49:48] well i'll just speaking lord of brother
[1:49:51] aaron jones
[1:49:52] who has so been so desirous to express
[1:49:56] his testimony
[1:49:58] how he says this can be nothing other
[1:50:00] than god who's doing what he's doing
[1:50:03] there's no other way to explain it
[1:50:07] a young man who's been out of church for
[1:50:09] 10 years would call on a saturday night
[1:50:11] and i just want you to know i'm going
[1:50:13] out of town with my family
[1:50:15] so don't be alarmed if i'm not there in
[1:50:17] the morning
[1:50:18] oh god may you raise this young man up
[1:50:21] to be a fire brand for you
[1:50:23] may it be a revival sweep through his
[1:50:25] family lord may it inspire us to believe
[1:50:28] may we make a commitment to this one
[1:50:30] that we'll pray will minister to
[1:50:33] lord will believe all things are
[1:50:34] possible and i
[1:50:36] thank you lord jesus for giving us yet
[1:50:39] another example
[1:50:40] of the supernatural that's moving within
[1:50:43] our midst so that we can believe for
[1:50:45] ourselves
[1:50:46] that you will do what you have promised
[1:50:50] i commit the people to you today
[1:50:54] as we commit ourselves to your word
[1:50:57] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:50:59] pray
[1:51:00] amen amen it can be wonderful
[1:51:10] and this all climaxes with the meat and
[1:51:12] in the air
[1:51:14] and then we shall see him as he is and
[1:51:17] we'll be like him
[1:51:18] even in our bodies but until then
[1:51:23] i want to see him as he is in his word
[1:51:26] and seeing him in his word i'm changed
[1:51:31] from glory unto
[1:51:34] glory greater
[1:51:37] greater higher higher until this
[1:51:42] man becomes a god man
[1:51:46] that's the process where he now sings
[1:51:48] yield to it
[1:51:50] rest in it amen if you need anything
[1:51:53] from god we can pray for you
[1:51:56] petition the lord for you let's just
[1:51:58] worship for a few moments
[1:52:01] tell him that we love him
