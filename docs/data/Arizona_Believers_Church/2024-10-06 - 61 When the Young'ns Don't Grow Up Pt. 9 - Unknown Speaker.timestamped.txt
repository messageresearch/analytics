[0:00] I want to say thank you to brother
[0:02] elizer for ministering Wednesday night
[0:04] that was just a tremendous service I I
[0:06] really loved it and my understanding was
[0:08] opened up is very
[0:10] encouraging uh some in my family voted
[0:12] it the best service of the year
[0:15] so I if I come across as a little
[0:17] competitive today you'll know why trying
[0:20] to win back my family but I thought it
[0:22] was just tremendous and I appreciate him
[0:25] being able to fill in especially uh uh
[0:28] you such a late notice I was wasn't
[0:30] recovering like I thought I'd be able to
[0:31] and I think it would have been my own
[0:33] Pride that would have uh compelled me to
[0:35] still show up and try to preach but I
[0:37] knew you deserve better so I'm just
[0:39] really appreciate the service and the
[0:41] leave that I was granted uh to recover
[0:44] Luke chapter 23 verses
[0:47] 26-33 some of you will find this to be
[0:49] very familiar um others if you're
[0:52] keeping up with the the series it might
[0:54] seem a little out of place but let's
[0:56] just read together and as they led him
[0:58] away they laid hold upon Simon irenan
[1:00] coming out of the country and on him
[1:02] they laid the cross that he might bear
[1:04] it after Jesus so we realized now he's
[1:06] walking to Calvary and there followed
[1:09] him a great company of people and of
[1:11] women which also bewell and lamented him
[1:14] but Jesus turning unto them said
[1:16] Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me
[1:18] but weep for yourselves and for your
[1:19] children for behold the days are coming
[1:22] in which they shall say blessed are the
[1:23] baren and the wombs that never bear and
[1:25] the paps which never gave suck then
[1:28] shall they begin to say to the mountain
[1:30] fall on us and to the hills cover us for
[1:32] if they do these things in a green tree
[1:35] what shall it be done in the dry and
[1:38] there were also two other malifa LED
[1:40] with him to be put to death and they
[1:42] were come to the place which is called
[1:45] Calvary There They Crucified him and the
[1:48] malifa is one on the right hand and the
[1:51] other on the left amen if we could just
[1:54] pray again our gracious Heavenly Father
[1:57] Lord we just ask that you'd settle our
[1:58] hearts and give us a Grace today to be
[2:00] able to receive your word father I pray
[2:02] that your anointing would be upon the
[2:04] hearer and Lord we know your word is
[2:06] Anointed we know that it is inspired
[2:08] father we know that the gift that you
[2:10] give uh that you've given to the church
[2:12] to minister father is your by your
[2:15] operation so Lord I just uh step my step
[2:18] aside and allow myself to be used for
[2:20] your glory that you might speak to your
[2:22] people so may you just reign supreme
[2:24] today in your word bless these things
[2:25] which we have read in the name of the
[2:27] Lord Jesus Christ amen you can be
[2:32] seated I'm just going to jump right into
[2:35] it today and trust that you'll be able
[2:36] to follow me and we'll go as far as uh
[2:39] just as we feel led or as far as uh my
[2:42] voice will allow but we want to continue
[2:44] on part nine of when the youngans don't
[2:46] grow up it's fitting into our series on
[2:49] the house of the Lord and I think the
[2:51] image is as a household and through
[2:53] marriage you have children and you raise
[2:55] them up and could you imagine in a home
[2:57] where the kids Never Grow Up move out
[2:59] and just how big of a house you'd need
[3:01] with grandchildren great-grandchildren
[3:02] and all the burden and responsibility it
[3:04] would be on maybe just uh the The
[3:07] Matriarch and the patriarch of the
[3:09] family and so there's just a lot of
[3:10] imagery there in this subject of when
[3:13] the youngans don't grow up and the image
[3:15] of a house you be in a house our
[3:17] household our family and then even this
[3:19] church one of the themes that we're
[3:22] looking at in these past several
[3:24] Services is uh from maybe this
[3:27] adolescence from childhood from to
[3:30] fullness and to maturity and it's
[3:33] pinpointing growing to a greater
[3:34] spiritual maturity you can't you can't
[3:37] grow your salvation but you can work it
[3:39] out you can't change your election but
[3:41] you can manifest it and you've been
[3:43] destined and that's uh that's something
[3:45] God's promised you and you you arrive at
[3:47] your destiny and so we are looking at
[3:49] becoming ripe as Believers and it speaks
[3:52] of being even I could say a Rapture
[3:54] Ready that there's a Readiness there's a
[3:56] condition at this end time that we've
[3:57] got to meet and we've been drawing
[4:00] heavily from the shareport series we'll
[4:02] call it that preached in November at the
[4:03] end of November 1965 it was Thanksgiving
[4:07] weekend and uh if you've been listening
[4:10] through this and you've been yourselves
[4:12] just going through these Services you'll
[4:14] find that there's just some tremendous
[4:16] thoughts that brother Bam's taking in
[4:18] total through those series uh series of
[4:20] services he preaches the invisible Union
[4:23] and faith is works or works as Faith
[4:25] expressed and trying to do God a service
[4:27] without it being his will and and I have
[4:30] heard but now I see God's provided place
[4:32] of worship and then he ministers on the
[4:34] wings of a snow white dove on that
[4:35] Sunday evening to cap it off such Rich
[4:39] uh things that he's laying out there
[4:40] he's getting these things out and then
[4:42] the very next sermon he preaches is here
[4:43] in Arizona the Rapture and so to me
[4:45] that's quite uh and then even the things
[4:48] beyond that it's quite a uh powerful
[4:51] series of messages that he's laying out
[4:53] to pinpoint the day and time that we're
[4:55] living in and one of the things he's
[4:57] identifying especially there in Port uh
[5:00] he's identifying that the Pentecostal
[5:02] church was in no condition to finish the
[5:05] last day message that there was God had
[5:08] done great works and he had been me
[5:10] emphasizing this through the several
[5:12] times he'd been there in the past that
[5:14] there had been a genuine move of God but
[5:16] now there's a Last Day message and he
[5:18] said the modern Church uh and he makes
[5:21] this statement when he's there preaching
[5:23] it's we've been drawing from this an
[5:24] invisible union he says the modern
[5:26] Church uh doesn't want any of these here
[5:29] scream shouting tongue speaking acts 238
[5:32] youngans around her uh she doesn't want
[5:35] it the modern Church doesn't want it and
[5:37] so brother bram's audience you could
[5:38] tell by the way he says that that the
[5:41] modern Church doesn't want any of these
[5:43] here and so he's identifying Life
[5:45] Tabernacle he's saying you guys you guys
[5:48] came up as real Pentecostals and you are
[5:50] you have the gifts in operation you
[5:52] believe in Divine Healing and you've
[5:54] done well and and so it's he's using
[5:57] Life Tabernacle as a rep representation
[6:00] of something he says the modern Church
[6:02] he's kind of being gracious to them he's
[6:04] saying the modern Church doesn't want
[6:06] any of these here youngans doesn't want
[6:10] this in their church and so he did
[6:12] wonderful to not question their
[6:14] experience and more importantly not take
[6:16] it away because he wanted them to go
[6:18] further he wanted them to take whatever
[6:21] God had done and go a little bit further
[6:23] and in Isaiah chap 28 we could read in
[6:25] verses 9 and 11 where it says for with
[6:28] stammering lips and other another tongue
[6:30] will he speak to this people the stammer
[6:33] lips that points to the youngans points
[6:35] to those that have been born it points
[6:36] to the day of Pentecost and the leod
[6:41] dean Church age represents the
[6:43] restoration of the gifts it represents a
[6:45] restoration back uh to those gifts that
[6:47] are poured out and to that move of the
[6:49] Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[6:51] so that there can be a full birth and
[6:53] it's so represents that in type and in
[6:55] restoration but the message identifies a
[6:58] different age and different time h
[7:01] brother Ram is very clear especially in
[7:03] the Rapture message and during this time
[7:04] period to say these things are true
[7:06] these things are right but we're living
[7:08] in a different time we're living in a
[7:10] maturing time we're living in a harvest
[7:12] time we're living in a ripening time and
[7:14] in The Invisible unit of the bride of
[7:16] Christ he says some of you people that
[7:18] really believe this to be the truth that
[7:21] we're entering another age we're
[7:23] entering the Rapture age you know the
[7:26] church can't go in its condition and
[7:28] what was the condition he's ain't even
[7:30] Life Tabernacle where they are uh this
[7:32] Pentecostal move and Life Tabernacle to
[7:34] me represents something um significant
[7:36] because kind of that whole area is a
[7:38] real uh real strong uh move of God and
[7:42] outpouring to the Holy Ghost back in
[7:44] those days and their their own Jubilee
[7:45] and return to Pentecost and you'll even
[7:48] find that some of the most outstanding
[7:49] Pentecostal churches and some real stals
[7:52] and real powerhouse with even in UPC and
[7:54] the Pentecostal movement in that area so
[7:56] it's a real strong Pentecostal spirit
[7:58] that operates right around in that area
[8:01] and so brother brandham is identifying
[8:03] that the church in its present condition
[8:05] now it can't go and he says and it can't
[8:08] get any better it must get worse it's
[8:11] got to get worse it can't go like this
[8:13] so he says it's got to be something and
[8:17] it's moving right now friend it's on the
[8:19] move is on for the bride that's the
[8:22] truth that's thus saith the
[8:24] Lord and as he's not he's not saying
[8:28] anything else is wrong he's not tearing
[8:29] down any of the gifts he's not trying to
[8:31] uh squash put out their fire and he's
[8:34] not trying to become this identified
[8:37] with the modern church and this this
[8:39] cold formalism but he's saying now what
[8:41] God has done you youngans and what God
[8:43] has birth and what God has done it's
[8:45] time to go forward and move forward in
[8:47] the light because the bride's message
[8:49] the bride's commission it's not a
[8:51] movement it's not a repeat of a
[8:52] Pentecostal movement but it's a and it's
[8:54] not a repeat of the day of Pentecost or
[8:56] a pointing back and a restoration of the
[8:58] gifts but it is a rapturing time the
[9:00] move is on for the bride so she's moving
[9:03] she's going forward the light is
[9:05] advancing and so with samary lips and
[9:07] other tongues will I speak to this
[9:09] people but he says right there in verse
[9:10] n Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom
[9:13] Shall he make to understand Doctrine
[9:15] them that are weaned from the milk and
[9:17] drawn from the
[9:19] breast that weekend in God's provided
[9:21] place of worship he's he's talking about
[9:23] the condition the condition of the
[9:24] church the church can't go in this
[9:26] condition and he says it takes a
[9:27] particular condition he says the the
[9:29] seed has got to be watered with the type
[9:31] of the water that that seed is made for
[9:34] so and he says it takes the right kind
[9:35] of condition so there's been these
[9:38] different conditions the heat of the
[9:39] sunlight same sunlight same Holy Spirit
[9:42] but there comes a dispensation and a
[9:44] time to ripen that grain to bring the
[9:46] seed to full manifestation and he's
[9:48] identifying this condition what what is
[9:51] the move what move is this the move is
[9:53] on for the bride the staming lips and
[9:55] another tongue have been poured out but
[9:57] who is he going to teach knowledge and
[9:58] make to understand Doctrine them that
[10:00] are weaned from the milk and drawn from
[10:02] the breast there's a change in
[10:03] dispensation a change in condition to be
[10:06] weaned is to be fully dealt with dealt
[10:08] with it means to ripen to be drawn from
[10:11] it's matured away from milk now entering
[10:13] into this real meat of the word of God
[10:16] in Hebrews chap 5: 11- 14 it identifies
[10:19] how Paul is saying you've become dull of
[10:21] hearing you're slow to understand and
[10:23] you're not able to handle the word of
[10:25] God skillfully and he says you've become
[10:27] babes because you've not grown grown to
[10:30] be able to handle meat and so they kind
[10:32] of got to go back and startle over again
[10:34] to get these things in place so Paul
[10:36] even in his age his gospel was about not
[10:38] just the things that were being placed
[10:40] in the church as far as gifts but the
[10:42] individuals themselves being placed and
[10:44] coming to perfection in Joel chapter 2
[10:48] it speaks of the spirit of God being
[10:49] poured out upon All Flesh and this
[10:51] happens in the day of Pentecost and the
[10:52] Holy Spirit directs them to that word
[10:55] but in chapter three it says put ye in
[10:56] the sickle for the Harvest is ripe
[10:59] maturity must follow Perfection must be
[11:01] following this and it's a this is the
[11:03] process of life that where there's the
[11:05] seed and where the power of God's being
[11:07] poured out the the seed is germinated
[11:09] and it's quickened and it should come
[11:11] back to Perfection to fruit again and at
[11:14] the same time the Press is full the fats
[11:16] overflow for their wickedness is great
[11:19] false vines coming to maturity the false
[11:21] Church leod DEA is coming to its
[11:23] fullness of evil cup of iniquity coming
[11:26] full and then also at the same time the
[11:27] bride is becoming ripe in the presence
[11:29] of
[11:30] God so in the s report series I believe
[11:33] if you've been looking at it you'll find
[11:34] that brother brandom is pointing to
[11:36] Isaiah 2918 where the deaf ears are
[11:39] hearing the word of the book the blind
[11:40] eyes are seeing out of darkness and
[11:42] obscurity and the seals are being open
[11:45] Christ is being revealed so that in
[11:47] Isaiah 324 we can say the heart of the
[11:49] rash shall understand knowledge if there
[11:52] are understanding knowledge it means
[11:54] they've matured they've been weaned
[11:55] they've drawn away from uh just milk but
[11:58] they're going to understand and
[11:59] knowledge and the tongue of the stammer
[12:01] shall be ready to speak plainly there is
[12:04] a scriptural dispensation it's
[12:05] absolutely scriptural the speaking in
[12:07] tongues and the gifts and the move of
[12:08] God God doesn't take that away from the
[12:10] church but that very experience within
[12:12] the church will take individually
[12:15] individuals to this place of maturity to
[12:17] speak
[12:20] plainly so this growing up is the
[12:23] process of perfection it's a process of
[12:26] learning applying what you've learned
[12:28] it's process of obedience and suffering
[12:31] and today I want to ident I want to
[12:33] remind you that that's difficult that's
[12:36] not an easy process when we earlier this
[12:40] year when we were ministering on why
[12:42] houses fall we're talking about taking
[12:43] shortcuts and the man who worked hard to
[12:46] lay the proper Foundation his house
[12:48] stood and how it's easy you could take
[12:51] shortcuts or go the easy route and it
[12:52] was a difference between one that was
[12:54] wise and one that was foolish and didn't
[12:56] really want to put in the hard work just
[12:58] wanted to the easy way it's the
[13:00] principle of least effort that I believe
[13:02] all humans find themselves wrestling
[13:04] with where people just naturally choose
[13:06] whatever path they experience the least
[13:08] resistance it's why some people say it's
[13:10] easier to ask for forgiveness than it is
[13:12] for permission and so you just kind of
[13:14] follow the easy way the easiest path but
[13:17] Christians are not looking for something
[13:19] easy a a and if you are looking for
[13:22] something easy I'm reminding you that
[13:24] you don't you shouldn't be looking for
[13:25] something easy as a Christian because it
[13:27] is easy to go with the flow it's easy to
[13:29] go with nature of the world and the
[13:31] course of this world it's easy to kind
[13:33] of get caught up in these things and
[13:35] it's in doing that and getting caught up
[13:37] in it that you come under its influence
[13:39] but brother B said it's hard it's not
[13:41] hard to stand up and keep true to a
[13:44] Creed think at that it's not hard to
[13:46] keep true to a Creed he says it's easy
[13:48] for the devil's right behind all of that
[13:50] if it's a Creed it's easy to stand up
[13:52] for it if it's a Creed if the devil's
[13:54] behind it he makes it easy but it's
[13:55] something else to be true to God's word
[13:57] and go back to what the the word
[13:59] originally produced after
[14:01] Pentecost so it's easier just to accept
[14:04] a Creed it's easier just to make things
[14:06] traditional but it's hard to stand for
[14:09] God's true word and come back to the
[14:11] word that was originally produced after
[14:13] after
[14:15] Pentecost and there's a lot more that I
[14:17] was hoping to minister on this
[14:20] particular series but I've just been
[14:21] trying to draw out uh some very specific
[14:24] points and in The Invisible Union of the
[14:26] bride of Christ one thing that stood out
[14:28] to me time when I was going through it
[14:30] is how that his the focus his focus is
[14:32] on the fruit or the children of a union
[14:35] and the life that follows the seed that
[14:38] is that that Union has brought forth and
[14:41] it's not so much on the marriage aspect
[14:43] though that's there but he's saying that
[14:45] in a marriage in this Union between a
[14:47] man and a woman it produces children and
[14:49] he's saying the modern Church doesn't
[14:50] want the these kind of young ons because
[14:52] it doesn't it it it doesn't believe in
[14:54] those things this modern Church cannot
[14:56] produce children of God
[14:59] and that's one of the themes so he's
[15:00] looking at the fruit of a union and how
[15:03] that the character of a genuine birth is
[15:05] identified by receiving the word by
[15:07] obeying the word and by the fruit that
[15:10] is born through the union of the Holy
[15:11] Ghost with an individual soul and not
[15:14] only can the modern church not bring
[15:15] forth children of God it cannot also
[15:18] follow the word I think this is
[15:21] something that's important to catch is
[15:23] that not only can it not bring forth
[15:25] children of God but whatever children it
[15:27] brings forth ultimately cannot go all
[15:29] the way in the word because they're
[15:31] still producing
[15:32] something now in this sermon invisible
[15:35] Union brother brandham uses this
[15:36] scripture in Luke chapter
[15:38] 23 and verses 28-31 and I think this is
[15:42] a very important reference and it it's
[15:45] placed right there in the middle of the
[15:47] sermon it's maybe seems to come out of a
[15:49] little bit of a of the blue but he says
[15:53] Jesus turning to them said Daughters of
[15:54] Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for
[15:57] yourselves and for your children
[15:59] for behold the days are coming in the
[16:01] which they shall say blessed are the
[16:02] barren and the wombs that never bear and
[16:05] the paps which never gave suck so it's
[16:06] saying blessed are those that don't have
[16:08] children to worry about then shall they
[16:10] begin to say to the mountains Fallen us
[16:13] and the hills cover us brother man
[16:15] quotes this and says speaking of the day
[16:17] that when women would no more want
[16:20] children and what a
[16:23] remarkable uh direct implication that
[16:26] Christ is making that there come a day
[16:29] when women won't want children because
[16:32] of the conditions of the age because of
[16:34] the condition of society uh because of
[16:36] their own uh thinking and their thoughts
[16:39] they will no longer want children but
[16:40] since it's in them to Mother they'll
[16:42] bring forth something or have something
[16:44] to
[16:45] mother and so he's uses this scripture
[16:49] of blessed is the women that are Barren
[16:51] or don't have children speaking of a
[16:53] time and a condition that he's
[16:55] identifying now this day where in women
[16:58] don't want children
[16:59] and in verse 31 says for they do for if
[17:02] they do these things this such a
[17:04] remarkable statement for if they do
[17:06] these things in a green tree what shall
[17:08] be done in the
[17:11] dry if they'll do these things to the
[17:14] Green Tree a green tree which to the
[17:16] Jews was an image of a good man or
[17:19] something good what shall be done in the
[17:22] dry tree so they'll do this to a green
[17:25] tree that seems to have life in it what
[17:27] would they do to a dry tree that doesn't
[17:29] have life we know that this green tree
[17:33] is a representation of Christ it's a
[17:35] living
[17:36] tree Jesus says in John 12: 24 except a
[17:40] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[17:41] die it abideth alone but if it die it
[17:45] bringeth forth much fruit so Christ is
[17:48] this green tree and he has been cut down
[17:51] and he has been crucified and they're
[17:54] they're persecuting and destroying this
[17:56] green tree but there is a promise that
[17:58] if this seed go goes into the ground uh
[18:00] it'll bring forth much fruit other trees
[18:02] like him the firstborn among many
[18:04] Brethren so Christ is represented in
[18:07] this green tree we know there's a
[18:08] purpose to this tree uh these things
[18:10] being done to the green tree but the dry
[18:12] tree stands opposite to this and this
[18:15] dried tree in the Easter SE brother BR
[18:17] is referring to it as the old dead
[18:18] formal tree you have the Green Tree
[18:21] Christ but then you have a tree which is
[18:23] dead which is formal which is dried up
[18:26] and he uses this scripture in Luke chap
[18:28] 23 verses 28-31 and this last verse for
[18:31] if they do these things in a green tree
[18:32] what shall be done in the dry he uses
[18:34] this scripture right before he starts
[18:36] saying the screaming shouting tongu
[18:38] speaking acts 238
[18:41] youngans and it's the last scripture he
[18:43] uses before he goes on this very long
[18:45] stretch of identifying this attitude
[18:48] within the modern Church to not want
[18:50] children and and this youthfulness and
[18:52] this exuberance that takes place within
[18:54] the experience of a child of God so what
[18:56] it does to me Scriptures it brings into
[18:58] view the purpose of a tree and what a
[19:02] tree is made for and how you can have
[19:04] these two different conditions and
[19:05] stages of a tree he says a green tree
[19:09] and if they'll do this to a green tree
[19:11] maybe a young tree and what would they
[19:14] do to a dry tree Green Tree when he
[19:17] refers to this and when brother bandam
[19:18] is identifying these shouting screaming
[19:21] jubilant excitable blabbering uh uh acts
[19:24] 238 youngans he's describing the green
[19:26] they're young they're full of life they
[19:29] have energy and there's an
[19:32] enthusiasm did you know that there's an
[19:35] enthusiasm when one has a genuine
[19:37] experience with the Lord and these are
[19:39] characteristic of a birth when
[19:41] something's born it has life in it if
[19:44] it's still born there's no life there's
[19:45] no there's nothing there to make an
[19:48] announcement and brother brandham in the
[19:50] sermon influence says when they were
[19:51] filled with the Holy Spirit speaking
[19:52] about the day of Pentecost they went
[19:54] into action right quick out into the
[19:56] streets and screaming and dancing and
[19:58] acting like drunk people speaking in
[20:00] other tongues and what a carryon they
[20:03] were in action right quick as soon as
[20:05] they humbled themselves went in closed
[20:06] the door and waited on the word of the
[20:09] Lord this is what happens when the Holy
[20:11] Ghost comes in there's an enthusiasm
[20:13] there there's a life there's an energy I
[20:15] believe that's one of the things uh that
[20:17] stood out to me in my experience is
[20:19] there was a different energy a different
[20:20] life a different enthusiasm one thing
[20:23] that to me that's a real Mark of a
[20:24] genuine experience is someone's appetite
[20:26] for the word of God and how excited they
[20:27] get about the things of God brother
[20:30] brandom in the sermon thirst very near
[20:31] here to the shrif port series it was in
[20:33] September 65 he says are you enthused
[20:35] with your experience in Christ why
[20:38] because you ought to be are you enthused
[20:40] about it well if you're not maybe you
[20:42] need to think about
[20:43] it brother Bram said when you're born
[20:46] there's an enthusiasm Rises with that
[20:48] birth and sets the soul of fire so a
[20:51] green tree is a tree with life in it
[20:54] there there there's some animation there
[20:55] there's desire there's movement
[20:58] a and there's a new life there and that
[21:00] comes with the experience and I believe
[21:03] it's it we we remind you of that and
[21:05] that brother Brandon went to Great Links
[21:07] to remind us because there could be this
[21:09] misconception that you just shake the
[21:11] preacher's hand you just put your name
[21:12] on a roll uh you just light a candle and
[21:15] you believe that you're saved and
[21:17] there's real there's no change in nature
[21:19] there's no change in desire there's been
[21:21] no genuine definite experience with the
[21:23] Holy Ghost and so with a definite
[21:26] experience of the Holy Ghost it can work
[21:27] its way in different people and
[21:29] different measures but what should
[21:30] follow is an
[21:33] enthusiasm and so this is a tree with
[21:35] life in it and as I was thinking about
[21:38] this scripture green tree and uh if this
[21:40] happens to a green tree and what happens
[21:42] in a dry tree now brother brandom is
[21:44] using this scriptural image right before
[21:46] he begins to talk about what the modern
[21:47] Church doesn't want to bring forth that
[21:50] that woman is a tree and if she doesn't
[21:51] want to bring forth children then she's
[21:53] a tree that's going to be Barren but
[21:56] then there's going to be a tree that
[21:57] puts forth babes puts forth
[21:59] children and in the sermon how can I
[22:01] overcome brother R is giving the intro
[22:03] to how he came up with that sermon he
[22:04] said he jumped on this log was this old
[22:06] sturdy what looked like a big old beach
[22:08] log and he jumped on it and he said it
[22:09] fell apart really quick he said that's
[22:11] the that's how the Christian church is
[22:13] becoming and he said they can't hold
[22:15] weight and they don't know what
[22:16] overcoming means he said this is how I
[22:18] got my text overcome keep life in
[22:22] you this is what overcome is to keep
[22:25] life in you you have a green tree with
[22:27] life then you have a dried tree
[22:28] something happened to that life when
[22:30] life went out that's what brought the
[22:31] log to that condition so he says kind of
[22:34] at the end of this inro he says so
[22:36] strive to keep so strive with all that's
[22:39] in you to stay in the Life of Christ
[22:42] that you'd be fruit
[22:44] bearing notice how he brings it to that
[22:46] conclusion that this overcoming then
[22:49] I'll say it this way overcoming is being
[22:51] fruitful that to keep life in you is not
[22:54] just to remain maybe I'm giving it away
[22:57] now it's not just to remain green but as
[22:58] a tree with life in you if you can keep
[23:01] life in you you can bring forth fruit so
[23:04] it's the process as long as life can
[23:06] work freely within the tree then it'll
[23:09] produce the fruits of what that tree is
[23:11] destined to produce it'll come back to
[23:13] seed again and identify what kind of
[23:15] tree that it is and so there's a green
[23:18] tree and brother R I'm saying this tree
[23:19] at one time would strong and sturdy but
[23:22] it fell over and it died right there in
[23:23] the branch the water that could have
[23:25] given it life caused it to rot twice as
[23:27] quick so over overcome is to keep life
[23:30] in you and if overcoming is to keep life
[23:32] it's not just to be uh vivacious and
[23:37] energetic but for that energy that's in
[23:39] you to produce
[23:42] fruit now we have a Dy
[23:46] tree the Green Tree I there's so many
[23:49] scriptures we could use in the book of
[23:50] Acts and in the New Testament how the
[23:53] the green tree has life in it brother
[23:55] man even talks about the tree that the
[23:56] leaves the Clapping of hands that repres
[23:58] represents the gifts and those things
[24:00] and so there's a there's a tree that
[24:01] comes to leaves and it has a certain
[24:03] life working in it but the dried tree if
[24:05] they'll do this to a green tree what
[24:07] shall be done in the dry the dry tree is
[24:08] the condition of a tree that is dead or
[24:12] dying it's not fruitful anymore so it's
[24:14] not serving its purpose and saying if
[24:17] they'll do this to a green tree that has
[24:19] life and can fulfill the purpose what
[24:21] are they going to do to a dry tree
[24:23] that's no longer meeting its purpose but
[24:26] let me say this if they'll do this to a
[24:28] green tree what will be done in the dry
[24:30] but you know the tree wasn't born
[24:33] dry you don't plant uh seeds and the
[24:36] tree come up as a dry tree but old dry
[24:39] trees are trees that didn't mature the
[24:41] right way or if I could say it this way
[24:44] they didn't mature they just
[24:46] aged a green tree is a particular tree a
[24:50] Dy tree is a tree that did not mature it
[24:53] just aged they did not mature and we
[24:56] could tell that it did not mature by the
[24:57] fruits that they have because the the
[25:01] the fruits tell you that it didn't
[25:03] mature correctly it aged it's planted
[25:06] years ago but we've come to this season
[25:07] in time where the tree is obviously old
[25:10] but it never matured correctly because
[25:11] it's not producing fruit and so the
[25:13] fruits tell you that it didn't mature
[25:16] correctly because you don't destroy a
[25:17] good tree you'll burn a dry tree you'll
[25:20] cut chop down an unfruitful tree but you
[25:23] don't chop down a useful tree
[25:28] many of you will be familiar with this
[25:30] story that brother Braham told many many
[25:31] times he told the told the story of
[25:33] green trees and dead trees anybody
[25:37] familiar with that brother man talking
[25:38] about the old Big Trees the pine trees
[25:40] that were groaning and moaning and then
[25:42] the young trees they're right there in
[25:43] the same forest and he was in the woods
[25:46] on the Alaskan border He said Out
[25:47] hundreds of miles away from even a main
[25:49] road or something and he said he looked
[25:51] out over to this Forest that had been
[25:52] burned over and there had been a fire
[25:53] that went through there and he describes
[25:56] in these several different places these
[25:57] old stately strong trees old stately
[26:01] large but he said they were dead and
[26:03] they were dry be yet the wind be to blow
[26:06] through that Valley and blow through the
[26:07] woods and when the wind blew through he
[26:10] said those dry trees begin to moan and
[26:12] squeak and squawk he called it
[26:15] groaning and the wind's moving them and
[26:18] they making a
[26:19] sound but he said that they just kind of
[26:21] had this gloominess to him these are my
[26:23] words but he's like oh cranky and old
[26:25] and moaning and groaning but then
[26:28] underneath all the complaining and this
[26:30] grumbling he saw new trees
[26:33] growing and to him that kind of it
[26:36] identified this great difference of how
[26:38] these old stately trees had grown up to
[26:40] this place where now they're dead and
[26:42] they don't have life in them and so when
[26:44] the spirit of God moves they just
[26:45] complain and they grow and they're stiff
[26:47] and they're starchy but and it's kind of
[26:49] like oh what a shame but then he begin
[26:50] to look oh but there's a new trees
[26:52] coming
[26:53] up and listen to how he begins to
[26:55] describe these trees I've tried to read
[26:57] every single place place that he tells
[26:59] this story and pull out to understand
[27:01] this full complete picture and he says
[27:03] young trees that were coming up they
[27:04] were flexible they just give to the wind
[27:08] Frolic back and forth like this having a
[27:11] good time young trees just coming up
[27:14] when the wind blew oh they were flexible
[27:17] they just frolicked he said in another
[27:19] place they were twisting and ringing and
[27:21] shouting and having a glorious time then
[27:24] little trees begin to frolic and jump
[27:26] and dance and carry on
[27:28] the winds blew through them and they'd
[27:30] Frolic With the Wind I'm reading from
[27:32] many different sermons they were just
[27:34] flexible and jumping and rejoicing
[27:36] shouting having an old Holy Ghost
[27:38] meeting why they were flexible they had
[27:41] life they were moving with the wind just
[27:43] rejoicing they weren't moaning about it
[27:45] they were rejoicing frolicking jumping
[27:48] having an oldtime Revival sounds like a
[27:52] holy ghost
[27:53] meeting and he says he quotes the tree
[27:56] in one place I'm as green a gourd but I
[27:59] can sure give to the wind when God sends
[28:01] the wind I like Frolic with it let them
[28:03] say you're crazy I don't care just green
[28:06] enough to frolic With the
[28:08] Wind talking about the wind hitting
[28:10] those old
[28:13] trees he says but when it hit them
[28:15] little green trees that's got life in it
[28:18] it just frolics and jumps up and down an
[28:21] oldfashioned Holy Ghost
[28:23] Revival and he said the wind the
[28:26] influence he said one make made them
[28:28] moan and the same one that made them
[28:30] moan gave the others
[28:33] Frolic that's interesting isn't it the
[28:36] one that made the trees frolic the wind
[28:39] that made them Frolic same wind that
[28:40] made the others
[28:42] groan now when looking at this picture I
[28:45] want you I I hope that we've already set
[28:47] up who these green trees
[28:49] are they have life in them they're
[28:51] enthused they're coming up there's these
[28:52] young trees he says young green these
[28:56] are two outstanding characters he says
[28:57] over and over again about being green
[28:58] and being flexible being young and he
[29:00] said that this these trees that were
[29:02] young and green and flexible when the
[29:04] wind would move they would Frolic they
[29:06] dance they shout they move around real
[29:07] good but he says as each time that
[29:10] happens those roots get stronger and
[29:11] stronger and stronger and deeper and
[29:12] deeper so there's an unseen impact
[29:17] that's happening on these young green
[29:18] trees as the wind moves and they respond
[29:20] to the Holy Spirit and they Frolic
[29:21] they're getting
[29:23] stronger maybe getting more
[29:26] stately because these fried trees
[29:28] weren't always dry but brother bam
[29:31] begins to describe them and how that
[29:33] they became starchy they became formal
[29:36] they became critical they they they were
[29:39] the old cranky Fighters the old critics
[29:41] and because they weren't the one
[29:43] frolicking and because they weren't the
[29:44] ones with the hands and they weren't the
[29:46] ones with the gifts you know they
[29:47] complained if they weren't the one that
[29:49] called the prayer line oh well we don't
[29:51] believe in such a thing if they're not
[29:52] the ones preaching and the altars are
[29:54] full ah we don't believe in altar calls
[29:56] right they they want the glory they're
[29:57] the old cranky Pentecostal
[30:01] Fighters but this is the
[30:04] danger those old trees were young
[30:07] ones those old trees were green
[30:10] ones so you better grow up correctly or
[30:14] you better grow up or you'll lose
[30:17] life you better mature correctly or
[30:19] you'll lose something brother M talks
[30:22] about a cornstock that grows and and I
[30:25] say this there's nothing wrong with the
[30:26] word and there may be nothing wrong with
[30:27] the grass
[30:28] but that seed is sewn and the light
[30:30] begins to come up he said if something
[30:31] lays across that corn stock it'll change
[30:34] the way that it's growing up still corn
[30:36] still growing but something inhibits its
[30:39] growth and causes it to Veer or be a
[30:41] little bit
[30:42] deformed and it won't grow up straight
[30:44] because of an outside influence and I'm
[30:47] saying this to those who are seed and
[30:49] there's good ground there's a way that
[30:51] the world and the church and religion
[30:52] and things want to influence your growth
[30:54] so that you don't grow up you may age
[30:57] but you won't grow
[30:58] up so think with me on this think about
[31:02] the the the frolicking green trees and
[31:05] that's the beginning of something and
[31:07] then you look and see the end and it's
[31:09] dry it's going to be burned it's dead
[31:13] it's groaning it's
[31:15] unfruitful and I'm not necessarily
[31:17] trying to create two categories of where
[31:19] you end up but to see this process
[31:22] working where there's
[31:23] life brother Bram in the sermon we would
[31:26] see Jesus says when a man is converted
[31:27] his eyes are set towards Calvary and and
[31:30] I believe he's speaking of a genuine
[31:33] conversion and even what it takes to be
[31:35] genuinely converted but he says if he's
[31:37] just a little bit nervous if you don't
[31:40] watch him he'll go over on the fanatic
[31:42] side so let's just look at it this way
[31:45] that you have a a person who's Born
[31:48] Again they're converted so now they
[31:50] become new creatures in Christ he says
[31:53] if he doesn't watch it if he already has
[31:55] some other predisposition some other
[31:57] kind of nature that he's predisposed to
[32:00] if he's kind a little bit more nervous
[32:01] and more emotional and those things he
[32:03] ends up on the fanatic side if he's just
[32:06] a little scholarly he'll go over on the
[32:08] starchy
[32:10] side so the condition even of the
[32:13] individual and what he's predisposed to
[32:16] if he's not careful he'll begin to lean
[32:18] to one of these sides even after his
[32:20] experience lean either to a fanatic side
[32:22] or a starchy side but right in the
[32:24] middle of the road is the same sensible
[32:26] Born Again spirit LED endowed Church of
[32:29] the Living God going straight down the
[32:31] road to Christ that's the real coming
[32:34] from both the
[32:36] sides one went away and one went the
[32:39] other shows fanaticism or either
[32:41] scholarly and too stiff to Bow so
[32:44] there's a middle of the road that we're
[32:46] to be coming into the image of Christ
[32:47] and that the Holy Spirit should be
[32:49] operating in us to come to that place in
[32:51] Christ's image Christ being formed in us
[32:54] growing up into him which is the head in
[32:56] all things but you got to watch out out
[32:58] because if you had some kind of bent
[32:59] before you might tend to lean to the
[33:01] more the fanatic side or you might tend
[33:03] to lean to the more starchy scholarly
[33:05] side so you can have a nervous side you
[33:07] can have a starchy side brother br's not
[33:09] saying well the nervous have really got
[33:10] it they've got the Wildfire they must
[33:12] really have it and the starchy they're
[33:14] just Catholics and they're dead he's
[33:15] saying no you got to be careful because
[33:17] both of those ways lead out this way but
[33:20] you've got to come right down and Cal
[33:21] from both sides into
[33:24] Christ he says the star you know more
[33:26] about the word than they know about the
[33:27] author
[33:30] to know the word's not life but to know
[33:31] him to know him is life to know him you
[33:34] don't have to be a scholar you have to
[33:37] be a submitted
[33:39] person to be nervous you don't have to
[33:42] you can know all the word you can in the
[33:44] letter of it but you still be a nervous
[33:46] person and just because you're nervous
[33:47] and exercise a certain way and look a
[33:49] certain way doesn't mean you've got them
[33:51] but either side you've got to be a
[33:52] submitted
[33:54] person that's what it takes is to be a
[33:56] submitted person brother man says when
[33:57] you submit yourself to Christ Christ is
[34:00] obligated to feel that
[34:02] vacancy I love that even in the sense
[34:05] that as he's possessed your soul
[34:07] continue to yield and he's pushing out
[34:10] pushing out Christ is having preeminence
[34:12] that you've poured your out on the altar
[34:14] he's obligated to his word to do it and
[34:16] he will not fail you am he who has begun
[34:19] a good work will finish it will mature
[34:22] it will perfect it right so there's this
[34:25] tendency and these two sides
[34:28] es that can begin to work even in a
[34:31] genuine person brother BR saying wow I'm
[34:33] not going to say either one of them or
[34:34] wrong uh you can have your
[34:36] impersonations of that but you got to
[34:38] stay in the middle of the road to Christ
[34:40] and the sermon God hiding himself in
[34:42] Simplicity then revealing himself in the
[34:47] same this is not coffee this is a tea
[34:50] for my my throat you say well you know
[34:52] it's bad when the preacher has to drink
[34:54] coffee to stay awake
[34:57] he said the Methodist said when we
[34:59] shouted we had it but they didn't the
[35:01] nazarin said they lived holy they had it
[35:04] but they didn't the Pentecostal said we
[35:06] speak in tongues we got it but they
[35:08] didn't God unfolded himself not in
[35:13] Sensations not going to have time to get
[35:15] to it today I don't think but we'll get
[35:16] to it uh maybe uh uh in a future
[35:20] sermon he says not in Sensations
[35:23] remember one of the
[35:24] Mysteries in this last day is the
[35:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[35:28] sensation but it's the person of Christ
[35:31] working in you doing the works of Christ
[35:34] so he says not in Sensations no
[35:37] Sensations yet with
[35:39] it so it's not the evidence he says but
[35:42] yet I mean how can how can the power of
[35:44] God be present and even The Unborn again
[35:48] and unregenerate not feel it and know
[35:50] something's happening when God can move
[35:52] on such a level so there is a human
[35:54] stimulus response to it but he's saying
[35:56] God unfolds himself not in the sensation
[35:59] he says you see the place he just gets
[36:01] it so humble till anybody can see it if
[36:04] you inject your own mind to it in your
[36:06] own
[36:07] thoughts he says it's God but there's
[36:10] this a danger of injecting your own mind
[36:12] your own thoughts he said and then they
[36:13] become a bunch of
[36:15] Fanatics then here's the cold formals on
[36:18] this side and here's the Fanatics on the
[36:20] other side ah there's your two sides
[36:23] there's your nervous one that becomes a
[36:24] fanatic and your scholarly one that
[36:26] becomes starchy and he says the the god
[36:29] moves and God moves in such a way but
[36:31] then they inject their own thoughts into
[36:32] it what do they end up doing they end up
[36:33] going to either side and here goes the
[36:36] bride right straight through it all
[36:40] calling from both sides that's just God
[36:43] vindicating as he goes along his
[36:46] word so the bride she's got to stay in
[36:49] the middle she's got to be going
[36:50] straight towards Christ and as she goes
[36:52] straight towards Christ she's saying
[36:54] this is the way walk in it she's calling
[36:56] from both sides to the middle of the
[36:58] road listen if the fanatic tries to pull
[37:01] on the scholarly if the nervous person
[37:04] pulls on the scholarly guess where the
[37:06] scholarly ends up in a ditch with the
[37:09] fanatic and then the scholarly begins to
[37:11] pull on the nervous person and they just
[37:13] jerk them right across the road into the
[37:15] ditch on the other side but the bride's
[37:17] the only one in the middle who can stay
[37:20] balanced straight towards Christ and
[37:21] call from both sides and because she's
[37:24] in the middle the Fanatics don't like
[37:25] her and neither do the scholarly right
[37:27] right she takes shots from both sides
[37:30] cuz she's in the middle and they think
[37:32] they're shooting at each other but all
[37:33] they're doing is trying ultimately
[37:36] attacking the
[37:38] bride so with these injection of One's
[37:41] Own thoughts and you can either be a
[37:42] fanatic or you can be a
[37:44] formal it gives rise to these two
[37:47] different sides where there's the easy
[37:49] emotionalism and the easy
[37:51] believism it's easy to be emotional easy
[37:54] to work yourself up it's easy to cry
[37:56] it's easy to get excited it's easy to do
[37:58] these things especially for those who
[38:00] find that they're already predisposed to
[38:04] that and there's an easy emotionalism
[38:06] and an easy belief ISM and if it's easy
[38:09] the devil's behind it even though we
[38:11] realize yet sensation with it and if
[38:13] it's not if there's no emotion it's dead
[38:15] and bury it but yet there can be an easy
[38:18] emotionalism where the very fact that
[38:20] it's emotional is used to somehow make
[38:22] you feel like you've got it when that's
[38:24] not it and the same could be instead of
[38:27] easy believism even though the Bible
[38:29] tells us only believe and that we ought
[38:32] to believe and it's the only thing you
[38:33] can do but yet that kind of believing
[38:35] doesn't produce Easy Living it doesn't
[38:38] make it easy but yet the devil will use
[38:40] it to pervert it but right down in the
[38:42] middle of the road is the harder
[38:45] way and here's Christ saying if they do
[38:48] these things to a green tree what will
[38:50] they do to a
[38:51] dry in the very next picture it says
[38:53] he's going to be hung between two
[38:55] malifa there's Christ
[38:57] Christ the green tree right in the
[39:00] middle and then on each side is one that
[39:03] rejects him but the other all he says is
[39:05] this day be with
[39:07] me and he's in
[39:09] Paradise he's there saying uh rebuking
[39:14] and say remember me when you when you go
[39:15] and he says this day you'll be with me
[39:17] in paradise and yet right there the one
[39:19] that's going to be judged and the one
[39:20] that receives Grace there's Christ right
[39:22] in the
[39:22] middle Christ The Green Tree lifted up
[39:25] on a tree showing us that right down the
[39:27] middle of the road is calling from both
[39:30] sides calling out of the the the those
[39:32] that truly are word rejectors or those
[39:35] that are sinners and those that don't
[39:36] want to have anything to do and then
[39:37] maybe those that might think they could
[39:38] just take the last minute easy way out
[39:40] there's Christ right down in the middle
[39:42] of the road the harder
[39:45] way to continue on this image of the
[39:47] these trees in John 15: 1 to8 Jesus says
[39:51] I am the vine excuse me I am the True
[39:54] Vine and my father is the husbandman
[39:58] now what does that tell us the image of
[40:00] Christ being a Vine that is growing and
[40:01] God is the one that's the pruner yes
[40:04] he's the one that's watching out over
[40:05] and making sure the vine is growing up
[40:07] properly so the father to the son is
[40:10] watching out over the growth and
[40:11] development of the Sun so that the vine
[40:13] can produce the fruits that the father
[40:15] intended when he planted the seed every
[40:18] branch in me that beareth not fruit he
[40:20] taketh away notice there are branches
[40:23] then in this Vine he says if it's not
[40:25] fruitful it's taken away I I read this
[40:28] scripture to point out that if we must
[40:30] grow correctly we must mature not just
[40:32] age but mature because if we don't
[40:34] mature in the image of the dead tree or
[40:37] the dry tree you lose life but now we
[40:38] can see that you lose
[40:40] something and every branch that beareth
[40:43] fruit he purgeth it that it may bring
[40:45] forth more
[40:47] fruit so the fruits are wonderful but if
[40:50] he sees the fruit then the father
[40:52] chastised he corrects he instructs he
[40:54] teaches so it can be more fruitful now
[40:57] you clean through the word which I've
[40:58] spoken unto you there's a cleansing
[41:01] there's a sanctification there's a word
[41:02] of God that does this and the father
[41:04] wants to work these things so he says
[41:05] abide in me and I in you as the branch
[41:08] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[41:10] abide in the vine no more can ye because
[41:13] the vine furnishes energy to the
[41:15] branches so you cannot be fruitful
[41:17] except ye abide in me so there has to be
[41:20] an abiding there has to be this
[41:21] connection I am the vine you are the
[41:23] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[41:25] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[41:27] not just fruit but much fruit for
[41:29] without me ye can do nothing if a man
[41:32] abide not in me he's cast forth as a
[41:34] branch and is
[41:36] withered so whether there's a lack of
[41:38] abiding something happens to that Branch
[41:41] where it's not fruitful and so it is
[41:43] taken away it Withers it dies it's dry
[41:46] and Men gather them and cast them into
[41:47] the fire and they are burned if you
[41:50] abide in me in my words AB in you you
[41:52] shall ask what you will and it shall be
[41:54] done unto
[41:55] you here in is my father
[41:59] glorified how is the husbandman
[42:01] glorified how is it that the husband the
[42:04] dresser of the vineyard the one that
[42:06] owns it how is he going to be
[42:08] glorified when The Vineyard
[42:11] fruits and grows up when a man plants
[42:15] seed he says yeah I got 160,000 Acres of
[42:19] cotton out there and he look like uh I
[42:22] just see a field sir he like yeah but I
[42:26] planted the SE
[42:28] and nobody's
[42:29] like right said we'll find out come
[42:31] Harvest Time and then you see hundreds
[42:34] of thousands of Acres of cotton you're
[42:35] like wow that guy's a farmer man he's
[42:38] done something so herein is my father
[42:42] the husband glorified to be glorified
[42:44] means to render illustrous to make
[42:46] Renown to cause the dignity and worth of
[42:49] a person to be made
[42:50] manifest what is it that glorifies God
[42:53] what is it that going to make him Renown
[42:55] when what he's planted produces what
[42:57] it's intended to produce here in is the
[43:01] father glorified here in is the
[43:02] husbandman Vindicated that you bear much
[43:04] fruit amen so you may be my
[43:07] disciples it is in the bearing of fruit
[43:10] that the husbandman the dresser The
[43:12] Vineyard The Keeper of the garden the
[43:15] one that prunes the one that purges the
[43:17] one that has the vision it's therein
[43:19] that he
[43:21] glorified as he was the vine and the
[43:24] father was the branch or he was the vine
[43:26] and the father the husband think about
[43:28] the works that Jesus did the wonderful
[43:31] works of God that were to be made
[43:33] manifest and as Christ bore the fruit of
[43:36] an obedient son he says so shall you be
[43:38] my disciples his disciples will learn
[43:41] and be obedient likewise and in doing so
[43:44] they will bear much
[43:48] fruit brother brand I'm even looking at
[43:50] this scripture says we have life we live
[43:52] the life we live the life that he would
[43:54] live if he was here on Earth in in
[43:56] physical form it's a life that we're
[43:58] living and the sermon be not afraid he
[44:01] says now if you want to
[44:03] say I got the Holy Ghost standing on my
[44:07] head he says amen go
[44:10] on I don't care what you got you say I
[44:13] got a I seen a big light go ahead and
[44:16] see the big light amen if you live the
[44:20] life I believe you got it you say I got
[44:23] it speaking in tongues amen if you live
[44:26] the life I believe you got it if you
[44:28] don't live the life you didn't get it
[44:31] that's
[44:32] all you've got to have that life behind
[44:35] there by their fruit you shall know them
[44:39] it's the entirety of the life that
[44:42] vindicates and proves what's in the seed
[44:45] do you realize there's different stages
[44:47] of a tree where it might look just like
[44:49] another tree even to the bark in the
[44:51] branches and the leaves but it's not
[44:53] until it produces its Acorn and produces
[44:55] its seed that you know the difference
[44:57] between
[44:58] another and if that's the wrong type
[45:00] that then then that's the wrong type but
[45:03] the truth is the vine the false Vine
[45:05] wraps itself around entangles it around
[45:08] and it looks just like the True Vine but
[45:11] what it can't produce is that word it
[45:13] can impersonate all sorts of physical
[45:15] big lights standing on the head speaking
[45:17] in tongues it can even do many wonderful
[45:19] Works in his name but what it can't
[45:21] produce is the entirety of the
[45:24] life cannot impersonate that word amen
[45:28] so Jesus says in verse 16 of that chap
[45:30] chapter you've not chosen me but I've
[45:32] chosen you and ordained you that you
[45:34] should go that's what brother BR says oh
[45:36] you got to stand on your head go on you
[45:39] saw a big light hey you saw a big light
[45:41] go on you spoke in tongues you shouted
[45:43] you danced you cried go on you've been
[45:47] chosen great I've ordained you then go
[45:50] and bring forth fruit and that your
[45:54] fruit should remain
[45:57] not just that you have
[45:59] fruit not that you're just young and
[46:01] green at one point and then end up old
[46:03] starchy stale but that your fruit should
[46:06] remain that whatsoever you ask of the
[46:08] father in my name remember the name is
[46:11] not just the Lord Jesus Christ but it's
[46:15] character it's nature it's the will
[46:18] whatsoever you asking my nature my
[46:20] character my name he may give it to you
[46:22] why would he do it because it's in the
[46:24] nature it's in the character power apart
[46:25] from characters without is say anic but
[46:27] here you have a son a daughter growing
[46:30] and that your fruit should remain it's
[46:31] fruit that last fruit that comes to
[46:35] Perfection brother B in the sermon if
[46:37] God be with us then where are all the
[46:39] Miracles he says we've Twisted the word
[46:41] to make it this way and twisted the word
[46:44] to make it that way and twisted it some
[46:47] other way to make it fit a plan just
[46:50] like as I'm speaking out just like
[46:52] injecting your mind into something your
[46:54] mind and your experience and and getting
[46:56] out on these other sides he says but the
[46:59] time has come to Halt stop your pling
[47:03] church the time has come when people say
[47:05] if you can't if you can just get enough
[47:08] Spirit to dance in the spirit if you can
[47:10] just get enough to see lights before
[47:11] your eyes or a sensation to run down
[47:13] your back or some quiver some shake some
[47:15] emotion you've got it he says you've got
[47:17] something but I wouldn't say just what
[47:19] you had till I seen what kind of fruit
[47:22] it
[47:24] grew remember how he said that's what
[47:26] happens with the the little the babies
[47:28] they want to feel something they want to
[47:30] feel some sensation and he says well and
[47:33] I guess I'll put it this way even in
[47:34] this sense he's saying well yeah you got
[47:36] something and you cry and you dance you
[47:38] see lights you have a sensation runs up
[47:39] and down your back well I won't speak
[47:41] against that but what kind of fruit do
[47:42] you
[47:43] grow and notice again let's just be real
[47:46] let's think about what he's saying then
[47:48] if he's saying I still want to see fruit
[47:50] what he's saying is all that other stuff
[47:51] isn't the
[47:52] fruit it's not the fruit of the tree
[47:54] it's the actions of a tree it's what a
[47:56] tree will do when the wind blows but
[47:58] only life only life working properly in
[48:01] the tree can bring that fruit you
[48:04] listening even the old dead trees
[48:06] groaned and moan you say oh the old
[48:08] stately dead trees groaned within
[48:09] themselves for the adoption the
[48:11] Redemption of the body growing all trees
[48:14] just groing to be changed in a moment
[48:15] the twink of an ey like that'll preach
[48:18] but the the the thing that was missing
[48:20] was what a tree should be at that
[48:23] stage the tree brother says the fruit
[48:26] comes at the top not on the leaves in
[48:28] this restoration this bride tree age
[48:30] with this Union with the invisible
[48:32] bridegroom it's to fruit it's to bring
[48:33] forth fruit and the fruits not the
[48:35] leaves it's not the shouting it's not
[48:37] the dancing it's not the bark it's not
[48:38] the tongue it's not all these other
[48:40] physical things that a tree will do when
[48:41] the wind hits it and the external forces
[48:43] hit it but it's when it produces the
[48:45] word
[48:48] again he said I wouldn't say what you
[48:50] had till I seen what kind of fruit it
[48:52] grew and we went through it this morning
[48:54] so that morning on that uh New Year Eve
[48:57] in 61 he says you can't expect a baby to
[48:59] be born a man it has to grow to it and
[49:02] we grow into the stature into Christ the
[49:05] full stature now somebody get converted
[49:07] tonight and tomorrow go preach the
[49:09] gospel why because generally when his
[49:11] conversion if he was
[49:13] scarly and he gets converted then he
[49:15] might end up being a little bit more
[49:16] starch and formal if he's converted and
[49:19] he's more nervous and might become a
[49:21] little bit more fanatic so what God
[49:23] wants to do is work on that gift and
[49:27] that person to call him away from these
[49:29] other uh predisposed things he might
[49:31] have and these things in his mind and
[49:33] his spirit and his garden and train them
[49:35] and discipline them and fill up these
[49:37] VES as he yields himself and he submits
[49:39] himself so he can be fully used of God
[49:40] in these gifts says we grow up into
[49:43] manhood into the stature of
[49:46] Christ the very image of the the seed
[49:48] that's swn on those different stages of
[49:50] ground in Luke CH 8:8 and other fell on
[49:53] good ground and sprang up and bear fruit
[49:55] a h hundredfold
[49:57] one place he says some 40 60 80 100 but
[50:00] hundredfold means this to be hundredfold
[50:03] it means it's 100y right the maximum
[50:08] increase that a seed can bring
[50:11] forth if one was to bring up so much and
[50:14] say well that there was a potential
[50:16] there but it didn't bring all of it but
[50:17] to be hundredfold is full measure the
[50:20] entitiy of the life full manifestation
[50:22] fell on good ground and it bear the
[50:25] maximum yield that it was able to
[50:28] Bear to bring forth a h hundredfold
[50:30] takes
[50:32] yielding takes submission to the
[50:34] husbandman to the father takes purging
[50:37] chastisement takes working and
[50:39] dressing takes a little bit of
[50:42] dunging Luke chap 13 6-9 He spake also
[50:45] this Parable a certain man had a fig
[50:46] tree planted in his Vineyard and he came
[50:48] and sought fruit thereon and found none
[50:51] why did he plant the tree so that it
[50:53] could wiggle in the
[50:54] wind no he wanted fruit
[50:57] he came and sought fruit there and found
[50:58] none then said he went under the dress
[51:00] of the vineyard behold these three years
[51:01] I've come seeking fruit on this fig tree
[51:03] and find none cut it down why cth it the
[51:06] ground it's a burden to the ground it's
[51:08] a burden to the soil it's a burden to
[51:09] the nutrients it's a burden to the light
[51:10] it's a burden to the water all these
[51:12] things I do to it to try to make it
[51:13] fruitful it's not making it fruitful so
[51:15] it loses something but then this very
[51:18] moment this keeper The Vineyard the
[51:20] answering and said him Lord let it alone
[51:23] this year till I shall dig about it and
[51:25] dung it and if it bear fruit well and if
[51:28] not then after that thou shalt cut it
[51:30] down I Believe In This Very thing we can
[51:33] see the image of brother brandom at this
[51:35] very dark time when the church is
[51:38] blacked out and Christ has been kicked
[51:39] out of the church here stands one
[51:41] preaching a lifetime e go run for your
[51:44] life come back to Christ just once more
[51:47] and he's laying in the word he preaches
[51:49] these things he's saying oh God be
[51:52] merciful oh just give another year give
[51:54] another time give another this it's r
[51:56] rapure season it's Rapture time this is
[51:59] when fruit should be coming forth but
[52:01] just wait Lord let this word let's dig
[52:03] about it let's dun it up so that it can
[52:05] become fruitful and then after this time
[52:07] has passed then those that aren't
[52:09] fruitful cut them down burn them but
[52:12] take the rest in your
[52:14] Garner it's the image of a tree doing
[52:17] exactly what it's supposed to do brother
[52:20] BR I'm writing in the church age book
[52:21] chapter 9 on Leo DEA says the choosing
[52:23] will be his own choosing I've chosen you
[52:25] I've ordained you that you bring forth
[52:27] much fruit that your fruit should
[52:29] remain his choosing then those chosen
[52:32] ones born of his spirit will be trained
[52:36] to conform to His Image in their
[52:40] walk those born by the spirit go
[52:45] on the move is
[52:47] on the Green Grow the life moves on and
[52:52] in this living after your day of
[52:55] Pentecost is a training to be conformed
[52:57] to His Image in your
[52:59] walk and let me say this as we try to
[53:02] wind this around down to a
[53:04] close young trees May
[53:07] Frolic but trees are made to fruit not
[53:09] just
[53:11] Frolic you're made for that you have the
[53:13] life in you young green trees are
[53:15] flexible that's why I think it's
[53:17] beautiful in the Youth of one's
[53:18] experience how they can adapt and they
[53:20] can move the Holy Spirit and they
[53:21] believe for great things and in time you
[53:23] don't want to get jaded or you don't
[53:24] want to get starchy you don't want to
[53:26] get stiff and rigid but you're not just
[53:28] made to frolic you're made to
[53:30] fruit you don't want to just blow off a
[53:33] bunch of steam but you want to channle
[53:34] that energy amen Ecclesiastes 3:1 says
[53:38] there's a in everything there is a
[53:40] season and a time to every purpose under
[53:42] Heaven There is a time to cry there is a
[53:45] time to dance there is a time to plant
[53:48] but then there's also a time to
[53:51] harvest in other words the order of
[53:53] things there's a time to plant it's a
[53:55] time to water there's a time to frolic
[53:57] there's a time to grow and then
[53:59] eventually there comes a
[54:01] harvest and in that time you're not
[54:03] going back to planting again you're not
[54:06] going back to watering again necessarily
[54:08] it's everything that's been done in you
[54:10] is a part of you to that moment for the
[54:14] Harvest brother bam says this about his
[54:17] about brother Billy Paul he's given a
[54:19] trip report having gone to Africa he's
[54:21] talking about Billy Paul and he says
[54:22] that gift is laying so close to him if
[54:25] you just move over into it it would be
[54:27] wonderful I want you to catch this young
[54:30] trees May Frolic but trees aren't made
[54:31] to frolic they're made to
[54:33] fruit when that tree that the dresser of
[54:36] the vineyard the or the husbandman the
[54:38] father of the vineyard the owner of the
[54:39] vineyard said he planted a Vineyard and
[54:41] he came and he saw the Fig Tree and he
[54:43] said it doesn't have any fruit and then
[54:45] the one who dressed The Vineyard The
[54:46] Keeper of the ground he doesn't say oh
[54:48] wait till the Windstorm you'll love
[54:51] it it's not what he
[54:54] says it's fruit that he's looking for
[54:57] brother Bram said about Bly Paul but
[54:59] he's just at that Frolic age you know
[55:02] adolescence you know what I
[55:04] mean here was a gift lay there that
[55:08] could be extraordinary that he had to
[55:10] move into it but he was at the Frolic
[55:12] age this adolescence this youthful Sage
[55:15] he says I pray that God will settle him
[55:17] down someday put him on a platform to
[55:19] give him a Ministry just bring millions
[55:20] of souls to Christ he says I I do you
[55:23] pray for him
[55:24] too and this is brother
[55:28] Brandon talking about his son he says
[55:32] he's got a lot up front but I know what
[55:33] Billy is in the
[55:35] back here's a father here's a Daddy who
[55:37] knew what was in his son knew the
[55:40] potential knew the possibility but saw
[55:42] just a lot of Frolic but knew that God
[55:45] had to work on him to bring him from
[55:46] Frolic to settle him to get him to the
[55:49] place reak Abus used of
[55:52] God as Believers when we're saying when
[55:54] youngans don't grow up and we'll have
[55:56] maybe one more service on this subject
[55:58] to get in the very these aspects of
[56:00] failure to grow up and what happens if
[56:02] we just age and not mature but we must
[56:04] mature not just
[56:06] age we should neither be starchy or just
[56:08] fanatical but grow up strong and
[56:12] fruitful and I want you to consider this
[56:14] and think a lot about this that maturity
[56:17] is as we mature in Christ you're relying
[56:19] Less on the physical evidence and the
[56:20] physical sensation but moving more in
[56:24] faith that's real maturity that's
[56:26] grounded so when you're not just always
[56:29] responding to
[56:32] stuff brother bam is he poses this
[56:38] hypothetical talking about these stages
[56:40] he said if we could break it up into
[56:41] these different quarters it could be the
[56:43] first 25 years second 25 years third 25
[56:45] years or the fourth last 25 years he
[56:48] said you know which one would you choose
[56:49] he said I would choose the last if I
[56:51] could live if I could choose to live God
[56:54] told you beforehand when you live he
[56:55] said you're going to be a carpenter
[56:56] if you're going to be a runner if you're
[56:57] going to be a jumper if you're going to
[56:58] be a daath athlete you're going to be in
[57:01] the Olympics you're going to build
[57:02] something he says then choose the second
[57:04] 25 he said but I I would choose the last
[57:07] 25 as a Christian that 75 to 100 years
[57:11] he says even as a Ministry I say I I
[57:13] choose that last he says because of
[57:14] knowledge the accumulation of knowledge
[57:17] he said I was thinking about what about
[57:18] me what will I take I'd take 75 to 100
[57:21] I'd be smarter wiser I'd be more settled
[57:24] I'd know more about what I'm doing
[57:27] I'm 10 or eight years older the last
[57:28] time I was overseas now notice this to
[57:30] me the continuity with this Africa trip
[57:32] report last time he was there he's
[57:34] talking about Billy Paul when he comes
[57:35] back he gives a report he said ah he's
[57:37] in that Frolic age I just pray that God
[57:39] would settle him
[57:40] down and he's identifies this in brother
[57:42] Billy Paul that he's got a great gift if
[57:45] he could move into it God he's just in
[57:47] this Fric adolescence God just needs to
[57:49] settle him down 10 years later he says
[57:52] if I was I would be more settled
[57:56] now he said I'd be more s in my last 100
[57:59] or last 25 years he says when I went
[58:01] there 10 years
[58:02] ago he said I was when I was overseas he
[58:05] said I won't be jumping in like I'm
[58:07] killing
[58:09] snakes
[58:10] W
[58:12] interesting Billy Paul needed to grow up
[58:14] now brother BR saying you know what if I
[58:16] could go back to Africa my last 25 years
[58:19] I I'd be more settled than I was
[58:24] then jumping in like I'm killing snakes
[58:27] well I could just imagine what that
[58:28] would look like how does one kill a
[58:32] snake come
[58:37] here bite it no
[58:43] it's i' know more about it see I know
[58:45] how just like a dog fighting a
[58:48] you know about how to take a hold of him
[58:50] don't jump in there scratch you up know
[58:52] his tricks and watch what he does and we
[58:55] learn more about the enemy so we got to
[58:58] find out all his techniques and how he
[58:59] approaches and what he does and learn
[59:00] his punches then you're trained to go
[59:02] down into him so I believe now I told
[59:05] the wife I believe I'm in better shape
[59:06] now than I was when I was 40 years old
[59:08] and went over to Africa and I'm 54 but I
[59:12] believe if I live and can still get
[59:13] around as good as I can now when I'm a
[59:15] hundred if Jesus would carry that long
[59:17] I'd be in better shape than I am now to
[59:20] go because you'd know more about it
[59:22] you'd know more about what to do and how
[59:24] to handle it how to handle the
[59:26] situation be more stable wouldn't be
[59:29] jumping to everything wouldn't be just
[59:31] moved by
[59:32] things boy the devil tries to do it so
[59:34] often just to get you to
[59:38] move brother bramman the sermon works as
[59:40] Faith Express this is November 26 this
[59:43] the day after he preaches about these
[59:45] youngans these young green trees coming
[59:47] up with life he says sometimes we
[59:49] misunderstand this people gets emotion
[59:51] and they try to work on emotion that
[59:53] won't work please pay attention this now
[59:56] I'm like brother gerholz are here we're
[59:58] old men and we've been in this a long
[1:00:00] time and we've seen the pros and cons
[1:00:01] and everything and praying for the sick
[1:00:03] around the world and seeing the
[1:00:04] disappointment of people and seeing the
[1:00:06] Hallelujah from every side then all this
[1:00:08] we learn by now when as boys we started
[1:00:12] preaching this Brother G holer like we
[1:00:14] started to
[1:00:15] swim first thing you know it used to be
[1:00:18] that I'd get out and brother Jack I'd
[1:00:20] have brother Brown to walk me on the
[1:00:21] street night after night to try to get
[1:00:23] myself around to myself
[1:00:26] I'd stand there like a little kid
[1:00:28] splashing the water seeing visions you
[1:00:30] know it's working things are happening
[1:00:33] but he says he Splash in the water I
[1:00:35] remember one night I'll never forget it
[1:00:37] up in San Jose or somewhere he come to
[1:00:40] wake me up I hadn't slept for several
[1:00:41] days I didn't know I was talking to the
[1:00:43] man but I said that I told him I started
[1:00:45] crying I'm going home why he said you
[1:00:47] can't go home there's a meeting going on
[1:00:48] down there I said well I'll I'll be
[1:00:50] ready for a few minutes to go home just
[1:00:52] beside myself
[1:00:54] almost I was a boy
[1:00:57] then I think about this maturing this
[1:00:59] growing was brother brandom any less
[1:01:02] used of God then was it not God it was
[1:01:06] God said I was a boy then I was wearing
[1:01:08] myself out he says it's like learning to
[1:01:10] swim and and my when my kids learned to
[1:01:12] swim
[1:01:19] uh Jack is the fastest one-armed swimmer
[1:01:22] I've ever seen in my life he used his
[1:01:24] one arm to swim across the pool and I
[1:01:26] tell him son if you could learn to do
[1:01:27] that with both arms you'd be
[1:01:30] another Michael Phelps go
[1:01:33] Blue he said like you're learning to
[1:01:36] swim you know you splash the water and
[1:01:38] go across the pool and I made her right
[1:01:42] you ever seen
[1:01:43] it I made it I made it I made it I made
[1:01:46] it I made
[1:01:48] it now after you learn to swim more
[1:01:52] graceful the stroke and it don't wear
[1:01:54] you out so much that's it you learn how
[1:01:56] to do it and you cut every corner and
[1:01:59] make it better and that's more of an
[1:02:00] ease now don't misread that he's not
[1:02:03] saying it's easy to get there it's hard
[1:02:06] to learn how to do it
[1:02:07] right takes discipline it takes training
[1:02:09] it takes time to learn this is how you
[1:02:12] do it this is the right way to do it and
[1:02:14] the harder the more work you put in the
[1:02:16] beginning the easier it is to do it
[1:02:17] right in the end little boy that never
[1:02:20] walked would try to walk down this aisle
[1:02:21] here he'd fall down a dozen times and be
[1:02:23] wore out before he got there but any one
[1:02:26] knows how to walk an athlete would walk
[1:02:27] down the aisle and never even notice
[1:02:29] doing
[1:02:30] it well he had that to start with that's
[1:02:33] what he is now he had that to start with
[1:02:36] the little boy that stumbles over the
[1:02:38] aisle he's got the athlete in him he's
[1:02:39] got the capacity in him but he needs to
[1:02:41] learn well that's the same way with
[1:02:43] preaching Divine Healing or anything
[1:02:44] else as you go along you begin to learn
[1:02:47] if you don't learn there's something
[1:02:48] wrong you've got to learn you got to
[1:02:51] learn how to accept God and what it
[1:02:52] really
[1:02:53] means not just some young loyal you're
[1:02:56] screaming and shouting and making a big
[1:02:58] fuss and making the people cry he said
[1:03:01] but but the word lay the word stayed in
[1:03:03] the word an old veteran who knows how to
[1:03:06] handle
[1:03:07] it and he says this in the very this
[1:03:11] very serious he's saying it's like
[1:03:12] learning how to swim you can Splash a
[1:03:15] lot of water out of the pool and you can
[1:03:16] make it to the other side but you need
[1:03:18] to learn how to do it
[1:03:22] right in second Peter chapter 1
[1:03:25] Peter gives what we know to be the
[1:03:27] statue of a perfect man and the adding
[1:03:29] of Faith all the way to the Capstone
[1:03:31] which is charity and brother Bram says
[1:03:32] add add add he says you don't add
[1:03:34] nothing it's the Holy Spirit working in
[1:03:37] you from that Foundation of
[1:03:39] Faith to those who've already had this
[1:03:41] blessed experience all the potential all
[1:03:43] the gift he said that when the one he
[1:03:45] had he had it to start
[1:03:47] with that's what he is now you had it in
[1:03:51] you to begin with it's in you all these
[1:03:53] virtues all these uh abilities all this
[1:03:56] fruit is in you to begin with it's just
[1:03:58] got to be placed to come out into its
[1:04:00] full
[1:04:01] Perfection so Peter says in 2 Peter 1
[1:04:03] verse 8 for if these things be in you
[1:04:05] and
[1:04:06] abound they make you that you that you
[1:04:09] shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[1:04:11] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus in
[1:04:14] you and abound they'll make you
[1:04:17] fruitful make you Bountiful bring forth
[1:04:20] much fruit and your fruit would remain
[1:04:22] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:04:24] Christ brother R in the sermon show us
[1:04:26] the father says something has brought
[1:04:28] forth a church that believes God is the
[1:04:29] Living God and when God sends that
[1:04:31] rushing Pentecostal wind down they just
[1:04:34] Sway and Frolic in it you say they're
[1:04:37] green but they're having a good time and
[1:04:40] they're growing if they're green they've
[1:04:42] got life if you're not a little bit
[1:04:45] green you don't have any life but notice
[1:04:48] what he says they're
[1:04:50] green they're having a good time and
[1:04:53] they're growing
[1:04:55] if it has life it can grow if it abides
[1:04:58] in the vine it'll bring forth much fruit
[1:05:00] if these things be in you and abound
[1:05:02] it'll make you neither be Barren nor
[1:05:04] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:05:05] Jesus Christ it may make you stand on
[1:05:07] your head it may make you shout it may
[1:05:09] make you see a big light it may make you
[1:05:10] do all these other things but that's not
[1:05:12] the fruit he's talking about that's not
[1:05:14] the evidence he's talking about he's
[1:05:15] talking about coming into the very image
[1:05:17] and growing
[1:05:18] up first John 2:6 he that say he that
[1:05:21] saith he abideth in him this is coming
[1:05:24] right back to John 15 if you abide in me
[1:05:27] the works that I do shall you do also
[1:05:29] and greater than this shall you do he
[1:05:31] said that there's a if you abide in the
[1:05:33] vine you're going to work out these
[1:05:35] things you're going to be fruitful if he
[1:05:36] says he abides in him he ought to walk
[1:05:39] as he walked he that sayith he abide in
[1:05:42] him ought himself also to walk even as
[1:05:44] he
[1:05:45] walk if not he either becomes fanatical
[1:05:48] or he becomes starchy but either way
[1:05:50] he's not fruitful you catch that and not
[1:05:54] the start you can say well we've got
[1:05:56] we've got the doctrine down and we've
[1:05:58] got the fundamentals down and we've got
[1:05:59] the scholarship
[1:06:01] down and the Fanatics going ah well we
[1:06:04] got the gifts and we got this and we got
[1:06:05] that and what is it we've got Spirit yes
[1:06:07] we do we got Spirit how about your we've
[1:06:09] got the word yes we do we got the word
[1:06:11] how about you uh just back and forth I
[1:06:13] don't know if they do this anymore at
[1:06:14] high school football games uh but
[1:06:16] there's that's that's all they're doing
[1:06:18] and meanwhile the brides in the field
[1:06:19] winning the battle and the cheerleaders
[1:06:22] over there there's PW poms you know
[1:06:25] the rides going right down the middle of
[1:06:26] the
[1:06:27] road as Christ learned he grew therefore
[1:06:30] we must grow from green trees to
[1:06:32] fruitful trees because if you don't grow
[1:06:35] you'll get
[1:06:39] dry brother brownman the greatest new FL
[1:06:41] news flash in history says but don't you
[1:06:44] just hide your soul behind that Creed
[1:06:46] thinking that'll save you you'll never
[1:06:49] be saved until you find Christ as your
[1:06:51] personal Savior and his Spirit fill your
[1:06:52] life then these signs shall follow the
[1:06:55] that believe not a Frolic dance have
[1:06:58] you've seen a lot of the Pentecostals do
[1:07:01] not a morg like you see a lot of the
[1:07:02] rest of them do they're both the modern
[1:07:05] Church aren't they the intellectual and
[1:07:07] the emotional both still live right
[1:07:10] here but he says not a Frolic dance like
[1:07:13] you've seen a lot of Pentecostals do not
[1:07:14] a morg like you see the rest of them do
[1:07:16] and the
[1:07:17] Pentecostals are about out of their
[1:07:19] Frolic now they're back to the morg
[1:07:22] too but they probably don't think so
[1:07:26] right but they
[1:07:28] are why because they
[1:07:31] aged they didn't
[1:07:33] mature they frolicked but they didn't
[1:07:35] become
[1:07:35] fruitful they were quickened and they
[1:07:38] were enthused but when the word was
[1:07:39] presented to them they didn't
[1:07:43] submit you'll find there's a constant
[1:07:45] consistent theme in the message of the
[1:07:46] hour that brother bam identifies the
[1:07:48] response of the young trees to the Holy
[1:07:50] Ghost as being
[1:07:53] Frolic and there's nothing wrong with
[1:07:54] the frolic
[1:07:56] but if you don't mature you'll end up in
[1:07:58] the
[1:08:00] morg so Peter says wherefore the rather
[1:08:02] Brethren give diligence verse 10 of
[1:08:04] second Peter 1 give diligence to make
[1:08:06] your call in an election sure for if you
[1:08:09] do these things you shall never fall
[1:08:12] you'll never be unfruitful you'll never
[1:08:14] be Barren in the knowledge of Jesus
[1:08:16] Christ you'll never find yourself in the
[1:08:18] morg before you start when you start to
[1:08:20] get dry you'll Shake Yourself why
[1:08:22] because you're making your calling an
[1:08:24] election sure
[1:08:26] you don't make it sure by all these
[1:08:27] other things that we've talked about in
[1:08:29] these services but you make it sure by
[1:08:31] the word working in
[1:08:33] you brother Bram says in the sermon
[1:08:35] Christ revealed in his own word the
[1:08:36] thing that's the matter with the message
[1:08:38] today is those who obtain it in their
[1:08:39] hearts must lay in the presence of the
[1:08:41] sun to get ripened you can pick up the
[1:08:44] message and then let the sun bake out
[1:08:46] all the greenness out of you making
[1:08:48] matured
[1:08:49] Christians from green to fruitful from
[1:08:52] Frolic to fruitful from Frolic to
[1:08:54] fullness there's this this change
[1:08:56] changing says that in the invisible unit
[1:08:58] of the bride of Christ it can't go no
[1:08:59] further we're at the end time so what
[1:09:01] does it have to do now lay in the
[1:09:03] presence of the sun to be ripened that's
[1:09:05] exact the word to be ripened your to
[1:09:07] bring forth and live what we're talking
[1:09:11] about I hope you can see that this is at
[1:09:13] the heart this is at the core of these
[1:09:15] things next time we Minister on this
[1:09:17] subject there's a I I had it in my notes
[1:09:19] to talk about how train up a child in
[1:09:21] the way that he should go and that when
[1:09:22] you see a son or daughter who's being
[1:09:25] raised and they're not doing the right
[1:09:26] thing it says you better correct them
[1:09:28] and it said I don't think it says Beat
[1:09:30] the Devil out of them but it says you
[1:09:31] know Drive hell from them Drive
[1:09:33] stubbornness from them apply the rod and
[1:09:36] what some what has what have some people
[1:09:38] done they've used it as a way to hurt
[1:09:42] and harm and frustrate and abuse their
[1:09:43] kids using the word and the same thing's
[1:09:46] done with statements in these sermons
[1:09:47] and they'll take it and they use it they
[1:09:49] twist it this way and they twist it that
[1:09:50] way and they TR create some picture or
[1:09:52] image that's used to abuse and it's used
[1:09:54] to prop up these The Fanatic or the
[1:09:56] scholarly and right there in the middle
[1:09:58] of it brother brandham saying the green
[1:09:59] trees the youngans need to grow up lay
[1:10:02] in the presence of the sun this word to
[1:10:05] be ripened in your heart and to live
[1:10:08] what we're talking
[1:10:12] about musicians if you'd come have a
[1:10:15] last statement to read and trying to do
[1:10:16] a god of of service without it being his
[1:10:18] will this is Saturday morning at the
[1:10:20] Full Gospel businessman's breakfast
[1:10:21] there in
[1:10:23] shreport he's just preached the
[1:10:26] invisible Union works as Faith expressed
[1:10:29] in the very next service he said the
[1:10:30] Shuck's pulling away no cooperation no
[1:10:33] nothing with it always it pulls away
[1:10:36] from it some people think the shuck is
[1:10:38] the
[1:10:39] seed but they're in the middle of it is
[1:10:41] the grain the true seed he says there
[1:10:42] can't be no more it's a wheat now but
[1:10:45] we're plenty green what is he looking at
[1:10:48] what is he identifying we're plenty
[1:10:50] green that's right you have to lay in
[1:10:51] the presence of the sun to be mellowed
[1:10:53] up that's all of it plenty
[1:10:56] green we haven't got the sincerity the
[1:10:59] sacredness the thing we ought to have in
[1:11:00] our midst to know that the spirit of the
[1:11:03] Living God moving in his word and
[1:11:05] showing us the things
[1:11:07] yet notice the sincerity the
[1:11:10] sacredness had some other statements
[1:11:12] that I could have read where brother BR
[1:11:13] was talking about the Frolic and the
[1:11:14] shouting and the dancing and he says you
[1:11:16] know what we we've got to come back to
[1:11:17] the sacredness of these
[1:11:19] things how people come up and they get
[1:11:21] all worked up and he says they do that
[1:11:22] and they miss it
[1:11:25] the
[1:11:26] sacredness to know what is in our midst
[1:11:29] to let the spirit of living God move
[1:11:30] appropriate in our lives so can show us
[1:11:33] things to come it increase our knowledge
[1:11:34] of of Jesus Christ so that we can live
[1:11:37] the things that we ought to
[1:11:39] live to where we don't just have Frolic
[1:11:42] or
[1:11:43] frigid but
[1:11:45] fruitful we're not on these either
[1:11:48] sides but we're right down the middle of
[1:11:50] the
[1:11:51] road young trees May Frolic but mature
[1:11:54] trees fruit
[1:11:57] and if you're a young Green
[1:11:59] Tree move move in that wind enjoy it
[1:12:02] exercise yourself let those roots get
[1:12:04] deeper but yield to the life that's
[1:12:06] working inside of you not just the
[1:12:08] anointing that's working outside of you
[1:12:10] but yield to that Holy Ghost and let him
[1:12:12] bring you to a fruitful
[1:12:14] tree let us be youngans that grow
[1:12:18] up let's pray together today if you
[1:12:20] could just stand with me
[1:12:25] [Music]
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:38] let's bow our
[1:12:43] heads in this day and age that we're
[1:12:46] living in I think there's a there's a
[1:12:49] pressure that you've got to choose
[1:12:52] sides are you going to you going to vote
[1:12:56] for Trump or you going to tr vote for
[1:12:59] Harris got to choose the side which one
[1:13:01] are you
[1:13:02] on
[1:13:04] and I don't think you'd please either
[1:13:06] side by saying you don't have a choice I
[1:13:08] think if you are not a Trumper that the
[1:13:12] trumpers would hate you if you're not a
[1:13:14] Harris the harassers would hate
[1:13:16] you and it's really really hard to stay
[1:13:19] in the middle of the road
[1:13:22] anymore and I believe that the things
[1:13:25] that brother brandham taught he had to
[1:13:26] preach him in a way to get the attention
[1:13:28] of people on every
[1:13:29] side and we've got to be so careful you
[1:13:32] got to watch he said if he doesn't watch
[1:13:33] himself if you don't watch him we can
[1:13:35] end up in one of these sides when what
[1:13:38] God wants us to do is be right where he
[1:13:40] wants us to
[1:13:41] be fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:13:44] Jesus Christ fruitful in the revelation
[1:13:47] of the word ears loose to hear a tongue
[1:13:50] loosed to
[1:13:52] speak we can enjoy all these other
[1:13:54] things
[1:13:55] but when we make a Creed out of it it's
[1:13:57] easier to enjoy
[1:13:59] them but when we submit and yield to the
[1:14:02] husbandman he purges us he chastises us
[1:14:04] he teaches us he trains us so let us be
[1:14:07] learning let us be applying let us be
[1:14:08] suffering that we may be
[1:14:10] growing certainly don't mind a little
[1:14:12] Frolic don't mind a little
[1:14:15] Wildfire love the emotion because it
[1:14:17] proves there's life in it but ultimately
[1:14:20] the life is to prove Itself by
[1:14:22] fruit God help us to do that let's pray
[1:14:25] Heavenly Father Lord today I thank you
[1:14:27] for your grace that you've had on us
[1:14:29] both to hear and to speak Lord myself to
[1:14:32] be able to get through so much uh of a
[1:14:35] burden Lord in this morning with all the
[1:14:37] different things that you had laid upon
[1:14:38] my heart to
[1:14:40] share so Lord I pray that you just be
[1:14:42] merciful to us now as we dismiss our
[1:14:44] service soon May the word just resonate
[1:14:47] in our hearts of the positive things
[1:14:49] that we could take away from this the
[1:14:51] reminder that you are a perfector that
[1:14:53] you having begun this this work you are
[1:14:56] faithful to finish
[1:14:58] it and Lord may we as we were reminded
[1:15:02] on Wednesday night and just it opened up
[1:15:04] to us that this fear that perfect love
[1:15:07] cast out is this fear of
[1:15:08] judgment let us not fear the hand of the
[1:15:11] dress of the
[1:15:13] vineyard for we are your husbandry we
[1:15:15] are your
[1:15:16] Vineyard Lord let us not fear your
[1:15:19] tender hand as it wants to shape us and
[1:15:21] mold us for Lord we know that you're
[1:15:24] only working in us purging us because
[1:15:26] you know that we can be
[1:15:27] fruitful we're not like the modern
[1:15:30] church but Lord we are your bride in
[1:15:32] this Rapture time in this Harvest Time
[1:15:35] and therefore the word of God is pruning
[1:15:37] and he's edging and he's doing these
[1:15:40] things to us so that we could become
[1:15:41] more
[1:15:42] fruitful so father I pray that we would
[1:15:44] yield ourselves to you not create a
[1:15:47] Creed at or doctrine around silent
[1:15:48] church services and not shouting amen or
[1:15:51] not being emotional cuz Lord that could
[1:15:54] only it's only abusing and manipulating
[1:15:56] the things you
[1:15:58] said Lord not making a Doctrine out of
[1:16:02] doing those
[1:16:03] things but just let the trees do as they
[1:16:06] can in the stage that they're in but
[1:16:08] Lord let the life prove Itself by coming
[1:16:10] forth in the entirety of the life the
[1:16:13] full manifestation of the word of God in
[1:16:14] your bride in this end time to do the
[1:16:17] works that Jesus
[1:16:19] did without sensation but yet with Works
[1:16:22] bless us I pray now as we commit the PE
[1:16:24] people to you bless them Lord be with
[1:16:27] them encourage them touch mise today
[1:16:29] Lord that he would be healed quickly
[1:16:31] bless sister Grace as she cares for him
[1:16:34] those here that are not feeling well
[1:16:36] Lord those traveling be with us I pray
[1:16:40] we ask all this in the name of the Lord
[1:16:41] Jesus Christ amen
