[0:00] Judges chapter
[0:02] 3:31 we are ministering last Wednesday
[0:04] on fight for it and the Lord um really
[0:09] impressed me on this subject as I was
[0:11] praying and and burdened it was on last
[0:14] week on Monday the Lord spoke to my
[0:15] heart this subject of fight for it and
[0:17] then as a companion to it we preached on
[0:19] the cost of war in
[0:21] Flagstaff and took in a complete
[0:23] different direction and just if the Lord
[0:25] would ever lead for me to minister it
[0:27] here I think it'd be very very fruitful
[0:29] um and very very beneficial to us but we
[0:31] preached on the other side of it and how
[0:33] that anytime there's a war or fight
[0:35] there's a there's a price that comes
[0:36] with it there's something given up and
[0:38] how that uh there's a maybe a
[0:40] double-edged sword to that and how we
[0:41] need the Lord just to come by with his
[0:43] grace and soften hearts that have been
[0:45] callous through battle and I want to
[0:48] continue on the subject of fight for it
[0:50] and when I was ministering last week
[0:53] even I think it was my son Elliot said
[0:54] dad you could have used shamgar and I
[0:56] was like wait slow down I took those
[0:59] scriptures out of my notes that's what I
[1:00] want to finish on maybe Wednesday so
[1:03] he's already he's already in the
[1:04] inspiration and channel so I expect some
[1:06] amens from my right side tonight but
[1:08] Judges chapter
[1:09] 3:31 and after him was shamgar the son
[1:12] of anath which slew of the Philistines
[1:14] 600 men with an ox goat and he also
[1:18] delivered Israel it's very short verse
[1:20] I'll read it again and after him was
[1:22] shangar the son of anath which slew of
[1:24] the Philistines 600 men with an ox go
[1:27] and he also delivered Israel amen you
[1:30] may be
[1:35] seated again my title is fight for it
[1:38] and we're wanting to minister in such a
[1:40] way that would encourage you to fight
[1:43] the battle we took Ecclesiastes chapter
[1:45] 3:8 last time I just maybe have a couple
[1:48] scriptures and a couple statements just
[1:50] to catch us up and then we'll just be
[1:52] begin with shamgar says in Ecclesiastes
[1:54] chap 3:8 a time to love and a time to
[1:57] hate a time of war and a time of PE
[1:59] peace we mentioned how that we can
[2:02] accept that there's times and Seasons
[2:04] but it's not always apparent to us when
[2:07] the time to fight when the time to be at
[2:09] peace and we see all these different um
[2:11] references in those first seven verses
[2:13] before we get to verse eight and we say
[2:15] yes there's a time for this there's a
[2:17] time for that even in terms of it being
[2:19] a time to laugh and a time to cry we
[2:20] don't know always know which the what's
[2:22] the appropriate moment even some people
[2:25] express some very odd behaviors during a
[2:27] time of grief and mourning and they can
[2:28] even begin to laugh or be a little bit
[2:30] more jovial and so just as human beings
[2:33] there can always be an awkwardness is is
[2:34] that appropriate is it too soon is this
[2:36] the right time did I wait too long is
[2:39] should I reach out now should I do this
[2:41] should I do that we can accept that
[2:42] there's Seasons but knowing just exactly
[2:44] the right time can sometimes miss us and
[2:48] here we were looking at the time of war
[2:50] and then it says a time of Peace we
[2:52] expressed how that there's a paradox of
[2:54] Faith it's the Paradox of the Christian
[2:56] Life that we're both fighting the good
[2:58] fight of faith and rested in Christ
[3:01] we're rested in Christ but yet we're
[3:02] fighting the good fight of faith and
[3:04] there can seem to be a little bit of a
[3:05] give and take there when am I resting
[3:07] when am I fighting and when I believe
[3:09] for something shouldn't I just relax and
[3:11] accept it and at what point do I need to
[3:13] fight for what I believe or take some
[3:15] sort of affirmative action brother
[3:18] bradam uh and I guess I could say to
[3:20] that to that extent sometimes it's not
[3:22] always easy to know when to fight and
[3:24] when to rest and so therefore we have to
[3:26] check what we are fighting for and we
[3:29] use that state M um for things that are
[3:31] to be are actually just escaping me now
[3:32] what's from you have to check what
[3:34] you're fighting for and this sermon
[3:37] Hebrews chapter 7 part one is a thinking
[3:39] man's filter where he says check what
[3:41] you're fighting for he says all wars are
[3:43] fought for principles now if you have a
[3:45] little war in church it must be the
[3:47] right principle you must be fighting for
[3:49] the right thing and each member of the
[3:51] church is supposed to do that so there
[3:53] you go each member of the church is
[3:55] supposed to fight but fight for the
[3:57] right thing and so we accept that if you
[3:59] have a little foreign church that means
[4:00] Satan will come along and cause some
[4:02] Strife or cause a misunderstanding and
[4:04] things can take place where there's a
[4:05] little Uprising in the church and
[4:07] brother saying make sure you're on the
[4:09] right side and and let me say this you
[4:11] always want to take sides with the word
[4:14] brother brandham even talks about the
[4:15] real challenge for a pastor is not take
[4:17] sides with any with either one because
[4:19] there's going to be times when people
[4:20] are pitted against each other and one
[4:21] has a claim and another one has a claim
[4:23] it's very important for the pastor to
[4:25] look at it in such a way to where he
[4:26] takes sides with the word and calls the
[4:28] sides to the to that particular place in
[4:30] the word find a point in common he says
[4:33] we must be fighting for the right thing
[4:37] and that's exactly what Paul tells
[4:38] Timothy to fight the good fight of faith
[4:40] in SEC 1 Timothy 6:12 fight the good
[4:43] fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life
[4:46] where unto Thou Art also called and has
[4:48] professed a good profession before many
[4:50] witnesses fight the good fight of faith
[4:53] I'm glad he says the good fight of faith
[4:55] that means if you're fighting the good
[4:56] fight of Faith you're good it's okay to
[4:58] fight the good fight of faith if he just
[5:00] said fight then maybe we would just uh
[5:03] as long as we're striving and fighting
[5:04] and get and have our Dukes up we'd be
[5:06] justified but says fight the good fight
[5:08] of faith if I could put it this way Paul
[5:10] is saying fight for it amen if it it
[5:13] pertains to eternal life it produces
[5:15] eternal life if it supports eternal life
[5:17] it's a if something that is a part of uh
[5:21] the calling of eternal life fight for it
[5:22] which we know eternal life is to live
[5:24] for others and so there's something that
[5:26] we ought to be striving for and fighting
[5:27] for so if there there you can even say
[5:30] that Paul is saying fight the good fight
[5:31] of Faith so there's a time to fight and
[5:33] when you're fighting make sure you're
[5:34] fighting for the right thing certain
[5:37] things to fight for brother Braham says
[5:40] in the sermon doors and door he says I
[5:41] like a man of vision he's referring to
[5:43] Abraham Lincoln I like people that's got
[5:45] something they're fighting for just not
[5:48] laying around wellever what comes Al
[5:50] comes along will be all right oh be up
[5:52] and at it and isn't that a caution to
[5:55] maybe our our lazy faith when well I'm
[5:58] just believing we're just going to
[5:59] accept what comes and we almost have an
[6:01] attitude that faith is just accepting
[6:03] whatever takes place and faith is just
[6:05] say well if I'm elect if I'm
[6:07] predestinated if it's supposed to be
[6:09] it'll be but let's think about the other
[6:10] side of it where foot uh Faith footsteps
[6:13] is possession and that there's things
[6:16] that you must reach out for there's
[6:17] things that you must strive for and Paul
[6:19] says I I'm putting everything behind me
[6:21] and I'm pressing toward the mark of the
[6:23] High Calling he didn't say well if I'm
[6:25] ordained to the prize of the high callon
[6:26] I guess I'll just get it he says no I
[6:28] press he doesn't just tell Timothy well
[6:31] if you've got eternal life you've always
[6:32] had eternal life you were never saved on
[6:34] any particular day and and since you
[6:36] can't do anything to save yourself just
[6:37] kind of lays around a little bit just
[6:39] believing you've got eternal life he
[6:40] says no lay hold of eternal life amen so
[6:44] we shouldn't just have an attitude well
[6:45] whatever comes along I'll just accept
[6:47] but we need to have something that we're
[6:48] fighting for and if there's uh maybe
[6:53] maybe it's for our young people who
[6:54] Envision fighting and and I think maybe
[6:56] what they when they think of fighting
[6:58] they think of what they do to each other
[7:00] and it is maybe a little bit with words
[7:02] but a lot of it is with hands right
[7:03] because certainly don't know what a
[7:04] fight is by looking at us as parents
[7:07] right but amongst them and the swinging
[7:08] and the punching and the kicking and the
[7:10] words and everything they and if that's
[7:12] the image that the young people are
[7:13] getting their minds of fighting fighting
[7:15] doesn't H is not physical but it's a
[7:18] perseverance it can just be a mindset it
[7:19] could be standing for something by the
[7:21] profession of faith it could be choosing
[7:24] not to act in a manner which expresses a
[7:26] doubt it could just be I I believe this
[7:28] is a promise I believe that I'm Healed I
[7:30] believe my children are going to be
[7:31] saved I I I believe these different
[7:33] things so I'm going to act in such a
[7:34] manner that declares I have confidence
[7:38] that things are going to work out amen
[7:40] reminds me of how brother brandham
[7:42] teaches us to conduct ourselves with joy
[7:44] in midst the trials that he and his
[7:46] wisdom allows to come to pass we could
[7:48] all say it's a fight to do that right
[7:51] but that's what this fight is for
[7:52] keeping the right attitude keeping our
[7:54] eyes on the right thing and he says I
[7:56] like people that got something they're
[7:57] fighting for and it's easy with things
[8:01] just to kind of maybe relax a little bit
[8:03] just accept what comes especially if we
[8:04] want to have a good profession and and
[8:06] and there's a that that that Paradox I'm
[8:08] talking about in my resting in my
[8:10] fighting I think I expressed it this way
[8:12] last year there's been times in my lives
[8:14] where I didn't know if I was numb or if
[8:16] it was
[8:17] Faith because with by faith you can
[8:19] accept certain things you can accept
[8:20] outcomes you can just accept it as it
[8:22] comes but there can also be a flip side
[8:24] where you're just numb and it doesn't
[8:25] you don't care anymore whatever happens
[8:27] happens so you want to be sure that you
[8:29] have that feeling you have a conviction
[8:30] you have an understanding and that
[8:31] you're fighting for something amen and
[8:34] that brings us to Judges chapter
[8:37] 3:31 I'm really hoping just to amplify
[8:40] these verses here it's just one verse in
[8:42] the whole Bible that tells us of shamgar
[8:44] and after him was shangar the son of
[8:45] aath which slew of the Philistines 600
[8:48] men with an ox goe and he also delivered
[8:52] Israel this is what we know we know his
[8:55] name we know his dad we know what he did
[8:58] we know what he used we know what
[8:59] accomplished that's all we know about
[9:01] him and I want to maybe look at those
[9:02] elements tonight and build some things
[9:03] around it we know his name we know his
[9:05] father we know what he did we know what
[9:07] he used and what he accomplished and
[9:09] brother brandham expresses this about
[9:10] shamgar he says shamgar said I'm a Seed
[9:12] of Abraham and as he began to think of
[9:15] it and that's where it began with
[9:17] shamgar as he identified his rights or
[9:19] His blessings as the natural Seed of
[9:21] Abraham that there was something that
[9:23] impressed him about the fact that I am
[9:25] of this lineage naturally of Abraham and
[9:27] there's certain promises made to Abra
[9:29] certain things that Abraham did in his
[9:31] seed after him and there came a moment
[9:33] in his life where he said I have certain
[9:36] rights and privileges in this land and
[9:38] in this inheritance and that's what he
[9:40] began to think about in Genesis 22:17
[9:43] God said to Abraham that in blessing I
[9:45] Will Bless thee and multiply and I'll
[9:47] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[9:48] heaven and as the sand which is upon the
[9:50] seashore and thy seed shall possess the
[9:53] Gate of his enemies and when it says the
[9:56] Gate of his enemies it's wanting to
[9:58] represent that whether it be armies
[10:00] whether it be councils whether it be
[10:01] some fortified Place whatever is
[10:03] representative of the enemy you shall
[10:05] possess the gates what anything that the
[10:08] enemy can use against you you shall
[10:10] possess the Gate of your enemy and he's
[10:12] thinking along these lines I'm not just
[10:14] a farmer I'm not just a father I'm not
[10:16] just a person here in L to Sea I'm not
[10:18] just a laborer in the valley but I've
[10:20] got promises I have rights this blessing
[10:23] is even rehearsed to Rebecca in Genesis
[10:25] 24 and they blessed Rebecca and said
[10:27] unto her Thou Art our sister be be thou
[10:29] the mother of thousands of millions and
[10:31] let thy seed possess the Gat of those
[10:34] which hate
[10:35] them this is how the Seed of Abraham
[10:38] begin to think that if this is the
[10:40] promise that God gave Abraham this is
[10:42] the promise we could give to Rebecca and
[10:44] her seed after her that they will
[10:45] possess the gates of those that hate
[10:48] them so shamar's willingness to fight as
[10:51] we're maybe just kind of backing up in
[10:53] his mind as he begin to ponder these
[10:54] things it was first found in the word
[10:57] his will to fight was first found in
[10:59] some sort of promise that instigated
[11:01] this desire this Zeal to stand for his
[11:04] rights and the sermon convinced and then
[11:07] concerned and you'll find this theme in
[11:09] those few Services brother R preached on
[11:10] this he was concerned for his family he
[11:13] was convinced he was an
[11:15] Israelite we want to be concerned for
[11:18] our families we want to be concerned
[11:20] about things that relate to our children
[11:21] and our and their well-being and their
[11:23] spiritual their spiritual makeup and
[11:25] their character he's concerned of his
[11:26] family he's convinced he's an Israelite
[11:29] the first thing he had in his hand he
[11:30] grabbed it it was an ox goat a stick a
[11:33] little piece of brass on the end of it
[11:34] knocked them off a plow or go the ox as
[11:36] it went along and a thousand Philistines
[11:38] with armor he don't see the opposition
[11:41] he was concerned and he was convinced he
[11:44] was convinced and knew he was an
[11:47] Israelite he was convinced God couldn't
[11:50] lie he was convinced that the blessing
[11:52] was upon him he knew that it was a
[11:55] promise of God he kind of just Ratatat
[11:59] you know firing this off Amen brother I
[12:00] feel pretty religious right now he was
[12:02] convinced that it was God's promise just
[12:04] the same as acts 238 is God's promise so
[12:08] that just tells us whatever the mindset
[12:09] of shamard to look at this promise to
[12:11] Abraham that his seed shall possess the
[12:13] gates of the enemy we can look to any
[12:15] promise in the word of God and begin to
[12:17] have the same mindset that's that's
[12:19] something for me that's something for my
[12:21] family that's something for my health
[12:23] that's something for my mental
[12:24] well-being that's something for my
[12:25] future that's something that I can
[12:27] believe in to take up my AR
[12:29] go he was convinced that God said his
[12:32] seed which he was will possess the Gate
[12:35] of the enemy that's Faith so he grabbed
[12:39] the ox coat and stood out there and beat
[12:41] every one of them down why he was
[12:43] concerned and he was convinced it's what
[12:46] it takes sometimes to to not only be
[12:48] convinced but uh to be not only be to
[12:50] concerned but be convinced or not only
[12:52] just to be convinced but to be
[12:54] concerned there's a certain level at
[12:57] which we can sympathize with the message
[12:59] but it doesn't doesn't carry us over
[13:00] into that concern where we're willing to
[13:02] fight for it right he was concerned and
[13:05] he was convinced so let's look at what
[13:08] we know about him we know his name his
[13:11] name shamgar means
[13:13] sword it's so representative for us we
[13:16] know the word of God is quick and
[13:17] Powerful sharper than any two-edged
[13:18] sword we think about the very time when
[13:21] God is bringing the Vindication that
[13:22] this is the third pull it was the sword
[13:25] of the Lord that comes into his hand and
[13:27] so there's something very particular in
[13:29] this message of the hour about the sword
[13:32] the king sword and and how we're being
[13:35] christened with that sword and it's in
[13:37] it's whenever a a seal is broke with
[13:39] Trumper sounds there's a declaration of
[13:41] war so we need to have these elements of
[13:43] Warfare at our hand to be used in this
[13:45] time Commission in Ephesians 6:17 take
[13:48] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[13:51] the spirit which is the word of God
[13:54] we're not just dressing for a picnic
[13:55] we're dressing for war and we have in
[13:57] our hands the sword of the which is the
[14:00] word of God now this word there is not
[14:02] just logos but it's actually the Rama
[14:05] it's that which has been spoken the word
[14:08] spoken is a
[14:09] sword so we're not just imagining the
[14:12] word we're not just pretending we hear
[14:14] it but it's something that has been
[14:16] spoken to us in this hour something
[14:18] revealed to us and when you put it on
[14:21] your mouth it becomes a
[14:23] sword we can say as long as you're
[14:25] thinking about it you could be thinking
[14:26] about the right things L go I got the
[14:28] thought of go I got the word I got the
[14:30] word but when you put it on your mouth
[14:31] the is what carries the thought of the
[14:33] word and so it's not just thinking about
[14:35] the message but it's speaking the word
[14:37] of God it's not just thinking about the
[14:39] promise but it's something affirmative
[14:41] to show your
[14:43] conviction to show that you're concerned
[14:46] and so we have to take the sword of God
[14:48] which is the word of God in Romans 10:8
[14:51] Paul says but what saith it the word is
[14:52] nigh the even in thy mouth and in thy
[14:55] heart that is the word of faith which we
[14:58] preach it's really a beautiful picture
[15:00] that I've been studying and hoping that
[15:02] maybe we could take a sermon just on
[15:03] this thought alone how that the word is
[15:06] preached and as the word is preached it
[15:07] can be Navy it can be close to you it
[15:10] can then even be in your thoughts and
[15:12] your understanding but there comes a
[15:13] point to where now you begin to speak it
[15:16] and it's just not near and it's just not
[15:18] in but now it's coming out again because
[15:21] you become so familiar with it the word
[15:23] is nigh me it's been near me the message
[15:25] has been preached to me for decades this
[15:27] message is clearly affirmative and
[15:29] absolutely Vindicated by the end of 65
[15:32] and it's been we're familiar with it
[15:33] there comes a time though when it's not
[15:35] only ni us but it's in our mouth it's
[15:37] that word of faith which been given to
[15:40] us shamgar a sword the sword that's what
[15:44] we have brother brandom writes in the
[15:47] church age book now Paul said the word
[15:49] came in power as well as voice the word
[15:51] preached actually demonstrated itself
[15:54] like a flaming cutting sword it went
[15:56] into the conscience of man and like a
[15:58] surgeon's kn it cut out the diseases and
[16:00] set captives free now there's a paradox
[16:02] for you surgeons don't use blunt you
[16:05] know don't use uh if they're going to
[16:07] try to get rid of something well I guess
[16:08] got to be careful what I say there's a
[16:10] surgeon amongst us but it's not just a
[16:12] hatchet job if you're wanting just to
[16:13] remove something in particular there's a
[16:15] Precision there's scalples there's
[16:17] certain tools that you use for certain
[16:19] things he says this sword will actually
[16:21] cut through thing and then can also be
[16:23] very very precise like a surgeon's knife
[16:25] to to get rid of things and set captives
[16:28] free he says everywhere those early
[16:31] Believers went and I believe you're
[16:33] throwback
[16:34] Believers I believe you're vintage
[16:36] Believers you're old school Believers
[16:38] because everywhere those Believers went
[16:39] they went preaching the gospel word and
[16:41] God confirmed that word with signs
[16:42] following and that's what we believe the
[16:45] sick were healed Devils were cast out
[16:47] and they spoke in new tongues that was
[16:49] the word in action the word has never
[16:53] failed in the mouths of believing
[16:56] Christians the word has never failed in
[17:00] the mouths of believing Christians so if
[17:03] you're a believing Christian you could
[17:05] just put uh have God prove his word and
[17:08] hold God to his word by putting the word
[17:10] in your mouth it has never failed in the
[17:11] mouths of believing Christians and in
[17:13] this last age it is here stronger and
[17:15] greater than ever in the true word bride
[17:18] the word is stronger and greater than
[17:21] ever in the true word bride I know that
[17:24] may stumble some people he's saying Paul
[17:26] had the word it came in power but in
[17:28] this last age it's stronger and greater
[17:31] than ever in the true word bride that
[17:33] means you ought to have more confidence
[17:35] today to put the message of the hour in
[17:38] your mouth and begin to speak it and
[17:40] watch God back it
[17:42] up as long as it just stays in an MP3
[17:45] form as long as it just stays in print
[17:46] form as long as it just stays in your
[17:48] mind it can be lust but let it become
[17:51] the Rama which delivers the power of
[17:54] that word am put it in your mouth and he
[17:56] says oh little flock you little minority
[17:59] hold on to that word hold on to the word
[18:01] fill your heart and your mouth and heart
[18:04] with it and someday God will give you
[18:06] the
[18:07] kingdom this little flock hunted
[18:10] persecuted rejected despised he says
[18:12] hold on to the word fill your mouth and
[18:14] heart with
[18:16] it shamgar speaks of that sword that
[18:19] word that we are to fill our mouths and
[18:22] our hearts with so the Bible says and
[18:24] after him was shamgar the sword and it
[18:27] says the son of anoth so that's the next
[18:30] thing we know we know his dad and his
[18:32] dad is anath and that word means
[18:35] answer so here he is you have the answer
[18:38] and you have the son of the answer you
[18:40] have the answer and then you have the
[18:42] sword the sword of the answer whatever
[18:44] the answer is it has power behind it and
[18:47] so he's shamgar is the son of the answer
[18:50] he is the sword of that truth he is the
[18:52] sword of that answer brother man says
[18:55] God got the answer he is the answer
[18:58] Christ Christ is the answer to every
[19:00] problem we got an answer is a spoken or
[19:03] written reply to a question someone ask
[19:05] a question uh then they they have an
[19:08] answer to it Elizabeth we're after we
[19:09] were engaged she was talking about how
[19:11] wonder what our children going to be
[19:12] like and I said they'll they'll have
[19:14] answers to all their questions because
[19:16] she asked the questions and I'm always
[19:17] giv the answers and I said they'll also
[19:19] be confidently worried just that Paradox
[19:21] of our two
[19:23] personalities an answer is a a reply to
[19:26] a question and an answer is a correct
[19:29] reply so you don't want to just think
[19:31] about you know brother say someone who
[19:33] always has the right answer someone know
[19:34] at all someone always has something to
[19:36] say well to have the answer means the
[19:38] correct reply it means you have the
[19:40] solution to a
[19:42] problem that's a it's a correct solution
[19:45] even in the practice of law it can be a
[19:47] sworn statement you respond to something
[19:49] you have the answer God's got the answer
[19:51] he is the answer Christ is the correct
[19:54] reply Christ is the correct solution he
[19:56] is the answer to every question the
[19:59] solution to every
[20:01] problem I had I preached a sermon one
[20:03] time say then it was I I know the answer
[20:05] what's the
[20:07] question because Christ is the
[20:09] answer I think maybe it was more
[20:11] appropriately I know the solution what's
[20:12] the
[20:13] problem that's how we ought to feel and
[20:16] it's not that the problem doesn't matter
[20:17] but we know Christ has the answer Christ
[20:19] is the solution and the sermon Christ is
[20:22] the mystery of God revealed he says we
[20:23] see all these great three-fold
[20:24] revelation God in Christ Christ in the
[20:26] church the kingdom coming Adam and he
[20:28] redeemed back to the Garden of Eden in
[20:30] the representation of Christ and his
[20:32] bride and then the kingdom is going to
[20:34] be restored according to his promise
[20:35] praise to be to God now by the
[20:38] revelation of the three-fold mystery the
[20:40] secret and by the personal Vindication
[20:43] Vindicated word by his original
[20:46] headp think of this I I I was when I was
[20:49] looking at this earlier today I was
[20:52] thinking just how different these things
[20:54] sound after those seals were opened just
[20:57] how permanent how absolute how clear
[21:00] he's speaking these things and I'm just
[21:02] picking out a little part of this but I
[21:03] think it forms a tremendous basis to
[21:05] what the seven still meant and why he's
[21:08] preaching this sermon and catch this not
[21:10] say well glory to God we shout
[21:12] hallelujah we sing that ain't it I'm a
[21:14] missionary I've been seven times
[21:16] practically over the world I've seen
[21:17] heathens devils and everything else
[21:19] dance dance and Shout I've seen all
[21:21] kinds of fleshly manifestations that's
[21:24] carnal so it's not because we shout not
[21:26] because we dance not because we could
[21:28] work up mental tantrum or get all
[21:30] excited but he's talking about the
[21:31] Vindicated word so he says but I'm
[21:34] talking about the headship of Christ
[21:37] being personally identified by the
[21:39] original headship we have the answer to
[21:41] the devil's
[21:43] question what's the devil's question in
[21:45] the last days with these scoffers and
[21:46] these mockers where is the promise of
[21:48] his coming everything's just the same as
[21:49] it's always been we have the answer to
[21:52] the devil's question he says amen glory
[21:54] we have the answer to the devil's
[21:57] question sh was the sword of the answer
[22:01] we have the answer to the devil's
[22:03] question he Christ has risen and has
[22:04] paid the price raising up the head or
[22:06] the body so he's raising up the body the
[22:08] devil can't stand it that's the reason
[22:11] these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up
[22:13] that's the reason they're all coming
[22:14] into what they're doing now isn't it
[22:16] amazing how enemies will come together
[22:18] to fight a common enemy people had would
[22:20] never have anything to do with each
[22:21] other but they find out they have a
[22:22] common enemy like hey you know what
[22:24] maybe we do have more in common than we
[22:27] thought well they said the the saying is
[22:29] the the the enemy of my enemy is my
[22:33] friend but then you're also to keep your
[22:35] friends close and your enemies closer so
[22:37] there's a lot of counsil we trying to
[22:38] figure out here Zig Ziggler help us out
[22:41] says there and he says the the the
[22:43] acumenical kingdoms are setting up
[22:44] that's the reason they're all coming
[22:45] into what they're doing now the devil
[22:47] that's the reason he's Hing the way he
[22:49] is his scheme has been uncovered by the
[22:51] Risen resurrected Christ in the headship
[22:53] over his body Glory you think I'm beside
[22:56] myself I'm not we got the devil's
[23:00] answer this is what's Vindicated him at
[23:03] the open of the word with this the king
[23:04] sword came in his hand the king sword
[23:06] the the sword of the Lord is the
[23:10] answer the Vindication of the
[23:12] resurrected Christ in his headship The
[23:14] Headstone coming to the body is the
[23:15] Vindication he said that the Rapture is
[23:17] at hand no wonder he could get excited
[23:20] no wonder he was told that you begin
[23:22] Empower to bind him death the greatest
[23:24] and the least I mean there was nothing
[23:27] that should perplex us there nothing
[23:29] that should cause us to be destroyed
[23:30] because we have the answer even to
[23:37] death reminds me of the a book I read
[23:40] many years ago I think it was called the
[23:42] 12 things that science doesn't
[23:43] understand and one of the chapters was
[23:45] science doesn't understand
[23:48] death and and there's a very long
[23:50] chapter on how it doesn't make sense
[23:51] that we would still die based upon
[23:53] Evolution and based upon all the other
[23:54] scientific principles we just don't
[23:57] understand death and why we die but they
[23:59] said we think it has something to do
[24:01] with how we
[24:02] procreate and the next chapter was on
[24:05] procreation or sex and science has
[24:07] figured out death doesn't make any sense
[24:09] to us but we think it has something to
[24:10] do with procreation it's like you think
[24:13] you don't think the original sin that
[24:16] Pro that act is what brought death and
[24:17] science can see all the markers and the
[24:19] pointers to it and we have the answer to
[24:22] their
[24:25] questions and so he says we got the
[24:27] devil's answer
[24:29] not me that liveth but Christ the word
[24:33] living in me so important so important
[24:37] we don't ever one time any get Arrogant
[24:39] with this I got the devil's number and I
[24:40] got this figured I got no it's Christ in
[24:42] me it's not my idea it's his power not
[24:44] my idea it's his word he promised it
[24:46] here it is amen that's that's a mouthful
[24:49] what he's pointing to there not my power
[24:51] not my idea it's his word he promised it
[24:53] here it is he said it would be here and
[24:55] here it is we got his answer Christ is
[24:58] WR has paid the price for our Redemption
[25:00] what God in Christ manifested he gave
[25:02] that flesh that and blood that in that
[25:04] blood that in the blood might come the
[25:06] life and the flesh be redeemed that God
[25:09] in this redeemed flesh could manifest
[25:12] his word for the day as he did in that
[25:14] day that's that's our lot today that's
[25:17] our calling today that's how the son of
[25:19] man has been revealed today not when he
[25:21] gets in h just in brother bradon's flesh
[25:23] he said but when he gets in your
[25:25] flesh that's what we we have today we
[25:28] are the son we are the son of the answer
[25:31] we are Sons and Daughters of God we have
[25:34] the devil's answer
[25:35] today I'm hoping this is encouraging you
[25:38] for the
[25:39] battle so we have shamgar the sword uh
[25:43] the son of anath the answer what did he
[25:46] do the Bible says he slew 600
[25:50] Philistines I don't know that we could
[25:51] really grasp that 600 Philistines and
[25:56] just to make it even harder to
[25:58] understand understand if he had a Gatlin
[25:59] gun or you know an AR-15 or something
[26:01] like that maybe we could understand it
[26:03] but it says he used an ox
[26:05] go shamgar the son of anoth that's all
[26:09] we know about him but it says he has an
[26:12] ox go so we could begin to extract from
[26:13] that he's probably was a
[26:15] farmer just a just a regular
[26:18] farmer not not one NE of garrisons not
[26:21] even of even part of a legion nothing to
[26:24] indicate that he was a soldier as a
[26:25] matter of fact we find later we read
[26:27] last time that God is actually telling
[26:29] that we need to teach the children of
[26:31] Israel war it was something they weren't
[26:33] taught it was something that they had
[26:34] forgot but he was just a regular farmer
[26:37] with the conviction in the word of God
[26:39] and he used that to slay 600
[26:42] Philistines an ox coat is just a common
[26:44] Farmers tool nothing special it wasn't
[26:47] like this uh utility knife it said I
[26:50] know it looks just like an ox go but
[26:51] watch this and it turned into a flaming
[26:54] sword it wasn't anything about it like
[26:56] watch this if you point it this way it
[26:57] shoots bullets it's just an ox
[27:00] code and it was just that was the only
[27:03] thing he handed had in his hand that
[27:06] day so it was what God had put in his
[27:08] hand to use that day when he needed it
[27:11] again another sermon convinced and then
[27:13] concerned he says a man I think this
[27:15] might be the one in Tempe he said a man
[27:17] would fight for his family like that
[27:19] brother Bruna that's where your church
[27:21] is there in Tempe they have their
[27:22] Outreach in their Church there in tempy
[27:24] says a man would fight for his family
[27:26] like that under circumstances is like
[27:28] that what ought the Church of the Living
[27:31] God to fight with with the
[27:34] baptism shamgar had an ox Cod you've got
[27:37] the baptism the Holy
[27:39] Ghost so shamgar the son of anath slew
[27:42] of the Philistines 600 men with an ox
[27:45] goat and he's saying that here just a
[27:47] regular farmer who would fight for his
[27:50] family under circumstances like that
[27:52] maybe logically would' say well pick
[27:53] your battles Retreat you know live to
[27:56] live to fight another day as we might
[27:57] say there's 600 of them it's just you
[28:00] your family and some crops maybe you can
[28:01] make it through one more year and he
[28:03] says look at him under those
[28:05] circumstances and he fought with an ox
[28:07] go what ought we the Church of the
[28:09] Living God do who has more than an ox go
[28:12] but we have the baptism of the Holy
[28:15] Ghost we have the sword of the lord we
[28:18] have the answer to the devil's question
[28:20] what want we to do shamgar with an ox go
[28:23] you with the Holy Ghost what ought we to
[28:25] fight
[28:26] for okay kind of attitude are we to have
[28:29] towards the
[28:30] promise and what did it accomplish it
[28:34] says he also delivered
[28:38] Israel he delivered
[28:40] Israel this this ought to really Inspire
[28:43] us because you could look at a you could
[28:46] look at a church and all the different
[28:47] families represented a church and all of
[28:49] us are fighting
[28:50] battles but isn't it remarkable to think
[28:53] that your Victory could cause victory
[28:55] for the rest of the church
[28:58] I if if the unconfessed sins of one
[29:00] person in the church can cause the
[29:02] church to bitterly fail what about the
[29:04] overcoming of one member what about the
[29:06] faith of one member what about the
[29:08] perseverance of one member that could
[29:09] turn the
[29:11] tide that maybe there could be a lot of
[29:13] families in the church just fighting and
[29:15] fighting feeling like they're going to
[29:16] give up feel like they're going to give
[29:17] up and and and they're fighting 20
[29:18] Philistines they're fighting 12
[29:20] Philistines they're just fighting maybe
[29:21] a smaller crop that they're getting this
[29:23] year than they did before prices have
[29:24] plummeted I'm not getting as much on my
[29:26] Bitcoin trades anymore and everything
[29:28] really really hard and then you're over
[29:29] there fighting 600 Philistines and
[29:31] everybody's like woo they're not going
[29:32] to make it and you
[29:33] win and it gives everybody else courage
[29:36] to believe that everything's going to be
[29:37] all right says he accomplished the
[29:40] Deliverance of Israel the actions of one
[29:43] man out of a conviction and concern for
[29:45] his family turn the tide of a very
[29:47] Onslaught against a nation and we can
[29:49] have that kind of feeling today that if
[29:51] I could just hold my place along the
[29:53] wall if I could just fight this battle
[29:55] for the Lord then maybe my victory will
[29:57] give courage to somebody else and not
[29:59] just deliver my plot of land but deliver
[30:02] a whole
[30:05] assembly help us Lord to live beyond
[30:08] ourselves good to accomplish Deliverance
[30:10] for the whole nation
[30:12] yes because one man was convinced about
[30:15] the word and was willing to
[30:18] fight and that that's the the part that
[30:21] I think even when it first was quickened
[30:23] To Me is This
[30:25] Moment where all of a sudden you just
[30:27] kind of wake up he wait a minute I'm not
[30:31] putting up with this anymore maybe
[30:33] there's been a concussion grenade maybe
[30:34] Something's Happened and you're little
[30:36] shell shocked and your ears are ringing
[30:37] you're little concussed you're not sure
[30:39] what's happening maybe the the devil
[30:40] sucker punched you a little bit but now
[30:42] once you start getting your wits about
[30:44] you realiz whoa that devil he took a
[30:46] punch and you start saying I'm not going
[30:47] to put up with this anymore I'm not just
[30:49] going to lay around I'm not going to let
[30:51] the bell ring I'm not going to get to
[30:52] take the count no I'm I want to start
[30:56] fighting yes sir in Numbers chapter
[30:59] 25 when Israel was abiding in shom and
[31:02] the Bible says that the children of
[31:04] Israel committed whoredoms at the
[31:05] daughters of Moab and they joined
[31:07] themselves to Bel peor and the Bible
[31:09] says that when he joined them themselves
[31:11] to Bel peor that it kindled the an or
[31:13] the anger of the Lord was kindled
[31:15] against Israel because of their sins God
[31:17] now is so angry with Israel and in he
[31:21] Lord told Moses take the heads of the
[31:22] people and hang them up before the sun
[31:25] Fierce anger of the Lord is going to be
[31:26] that the anger of the Lord may be turned
[31:27] away he says to slay every man who is
[31:30] joined to B peor and and then in this
[31:33] midst of this death sentence and all
[31:34] these people that sinned the Bible says
[31:37] that one of the children of
[31:40] Israel brought a midan itis woman in the
[31:42] sight of Moses in the sight of all the
[31:44] congregation who are Weeping before the
[31:46] door of the lord of the congregation so
[31:48] here they are all those that have been
[31:49] joined need to be slain and Moses is
[31:51] weeping the these other people are
[31:53] sweeping before the Lord God let it not
[31:55] be uh pleading to him and then some just
[31:58] comes along carrying a minidish woman
[31:59] with him going into his tent
[32:02] mocking God mocking his judgment and the
[32:05] Bible says that penhos the son of elazar
[32:08] saw it rose up took a javelin and he
[32:11] went after the man into his tent and
[32:14] thrust both of them through the man of
[32:16] Israel and the woman through her belly
[32:17] so the plague was stayed from the
[32:20] children of Israel I know I just have
[32:22] verse 11 there but it says the plague
[32:25] was stayed from Israel because one man
[32:28] recognizing this what was taking place
[32:30] and recognizing the Judgment of God took
[32:32] up a javelin and I know it's a very you
[32:34] know jolting instance but he thrusts
[32:37] this Javelin through both the man and
[32:38] the woman and then God and I know you're
[32:41] already reading ahead of me but God
[32:42] takes that act and he and it says he
[32:45] stayed the plague from the children of
[32:47] Israel all by one
[32:49] man Moses is pleading all these children
[32:52] of Israel before the door weeping for
[32:53] the door of the congregation everyone's
[32:55] crying out but is anybody going to do
[32:57] anything about it anybody going say
[32:58] anything about it and it says Moses and
[33:00] it said and those that died in the
[33:01] plague were 24,000 but it's at the
[33:03] moment that penos steps up that it stops
[33:06] and then the Lord spake unto Moses
[33:08] saying verse 11 penos the son of elizar
[33:10] the son of Aaron the priest hath turned
[33:13] my wrath away from the children of
[33:14] Israel who turned it away Pinos how why
[33:18] while he was zealous for my sake among
[33:21] them that I consume not the children of
[33:23] Israel in my jealousy in my rage in my
[33:25] jealousy I was going to consume the
[33:27] children of Israel but one man stood up
[33:29] and it was his
[33:31] Zeal his Zeal for my sake to be Ze
[33:34] zealous me to be provoked to jealous
[33:38] anger this is a righteous anger this is
[33:40] a righteous indignation it is actually
[33:42] from this example of penhos that you
[33:44] find the zealots in the children of
[33:46] Israel amongst the nation of Israel and
[33:48] you find them there in in the New
[33:49] Testament they were zealous for the
[33:51] cause of Christ and they use shamgar as
[33:53] their image as their leader as their
[33:55] example he was zealous for my sake and
[33:57] he took up the javelin and he thrust it
[34:00] through the
[34:01] sin and God says it's that that jealous
[34:05] anger and the action that it provoked
[34:09] that caused the Lord to stay the plague
[34:12] from among
[34:13] Israel so he finally got to a moment
[34:16] with penos he was tired of seeing
[34:18] everyone die he was tired of seeing this
[34:20] family fail he tired of seeing this
[34:22] young person go away he was tired to see
[34:24] his family not overcoming he was tired
[34:26] he finally got to a point where he was
[34:27] sick sick and tired enough to make a
[34:28] stand for the
[34:29] truth in the sermon God's commissioning
[34:32] Moses he says now shamgar said now look
[34:33] at here I'm not a warrior I can't fight
[34:36] and there's 600 men what am I going to
[34:37] do I can see him Pace back and forth and
[34:41] I love the way brother Bram dramatizes
[34:43] this he didn't know what to do coming
[34:46] closer Trump Trump trump you could hear
[34:49] the Philistines coming Trump Trump trump
[34:53] why because it just it just happened
[34:54] that year it happened year after year on
[34:57] every year the Philistines would come
[34:58] this is how the the tradition expresses
[35:00] it every year the Philistines would come
[35:01] and take their crops after they had
[35:03] plowed them planted them cultivated them
[35:07] watered them and brought them right to
[35:08] the Harvest then the Philistines after
[35:10] you did all the hard work would just
[35:11] come around and take the crops and maybe
[35:14] even shamgar knew it was coming and that
[35:15] day he heard the steps coming from a far
[35:17] off and he doesn't know what to do he's
[35:18] like this happened last year happened
[35:21] the year before here it comes again I'm
[35:23] used to this cycle I've seen this happen
[35:27] I I've seen it seen it done in churches
[35:29] I've seen it done in my family I've seen
[35:30] it done in my own life and maybe he's
[35:32] just bracing just bracing I guess I'll
[35:34] just have to give it up again I guess
[35:36] I'll just have to go through this again
[35:37] I'll just have to go through the cycle
[35:39] everybody undergoes everybody has
[35:41] something they go through and he's just
[35:42] resigning himself to lose another
[35:46] battle coming closer Trump
[35:49] trump a few minutes all of his oats will
[35:52] be gone all the wheat and corn would be
[35:55] gone everything he laid up
[35:58] his family would be starved everything
[36:00] he had done would be taken off over into
[36:02] that big enemy country out there given
[36:04] away to the enemy then the first thing
[36:06] you know God began to move on
[36:11] him thank you Lord first thing you know
[36:14] God began to move on him I like that he
[36:17] began to get
[36:19] angry if if some of you are prone to a
[36:22] temper we might as well make it a
[36:23] righteous
[36:25] one if you want a justification for
[36:27] getting angry we let's find the right
[36:28] thing to be angry at he begin to get
[36:31] angry we can finally start clenching our
[36:33] teeth my he looked around he thought oh
[36:36] my I'm an Israelite I'm circumcised and
[36:39] that's an uncircumcised Philistine
[36:40] coming up here I'm not a soldier I ain't
[36:43] got time to go out there and take some
[36:44] lessons and learn how to duel and how to
[36:46] fight but I tell you God's my
[36:49] God in other words get rid of all the
[36:51] excuses well I'm not trained and I'm not
[36:54] a minister and I'm not this and I'm not
[36:56] that I've lost too many battles ATT
[36:58] listen you've lost too many battles
[36:59] waiting to get trained time to stop and
[37:01] say wait a minute all those losing
[37:03] battles have trained me to trust train
[37:06] me to believe I won't make the same
[37:09] mistake this time and give the devil any
[37:11] room to
[37:12] win God begin to move he begin to get
[37:15] angry I'm not a soldier but I'm God's my
[37:17] God so he reached out there and got an
[37:19] ox code you know what an ox code is a
[37:21] little old thing had a brass knob on the
[37:23] end of it you beat the cattle through
[37:24] the Corral with it he reached up there
[37:26] and got the ox C he didn't have time to
[37:29] train to be some kind of a fighter the
[37:31] emergency was at hand he had to do it
[37:35] then pushed into a corner you don't have
[37:38] time to figure it out you don't have
[37:39] time to Google
[37:41] it you don't have time to check the
[37:43] sources on
[37:44] Wikipedia you don't have time to call
[37:46] this one and that one you don't have
[37:47] time to wrestle it out all you do is you
[37:49] have time to grab what's in your hand
[37:52] it's an emergency it's for his family he
[37:54] had to do it
[37:56] then I love that God begin to move on
[37:58] him it's indignation and he begin to get
[38:03] angry and 1st Samuel 17 it tells us the
[38:06] story of David when he fought
[38:08] Goliath and as The Story Goes David
[38:11] Rises up early in the morning and he's
[38:12] just a keeper of the sheep and Jesse
[38:14] commands why don't you go out and bring
[38:16] some uh food to your brothers dur in the
[38:18] battle and it said for the the
[38:21] Philistines in Israel had put the battle
[38:23] in Array Army against
[38:25] Army and we're and we're not quite there
[38:27] yet and and David had gone and when he
[38:31] came to the place where he was where his
[38:33] Brethren were he says he ran to the Army
[38:35] saluted his Brethren and as he talked
[38:38] with them there came up a champion the
[38:40] Philistine of gath Goliath by name out
[38:43] of the armies of the Philistines and
[38:45] spake according to the same words and
[38:46] David heard them earlier I think it's in
[38:48] verse 10 he's defying the armies of the
[38:50] Living God this is something he would do
[38:52] every day he just come out and
[38:53] intimidate them and yell at him and this
[38:55] day happened to be the day that David is
[38:57] bringing cheese and bread and corn to
[38:59] his brothers and the captains and the
[39:01] generals and David just this one
[39:02] 12-year-old 13-year-old boy who's
[39:04] keeping sheep I think he's maybe a
[39:06] little bit older than that now that I
[39:07] think about it I should have probably
[39:08] looked that up he's 12 or so when he was
[39:10] anointed this is later when he shows up
[39:12] and he comes there and he hears this
[39:16] boasting and they actually said they say
[39:19] to David when he shows up have you seen
[39:20] the man that has come up surely to defy
[39:22] Israel is he come up and verse 26 I'll
[39:25] just we'll skip here and David spake to
[39:27] the men that stood by him saying what
[39:29] shall be done to the man that kth this
[39:32] Philistine and taketh away the reproach
[39:34] from Israel for who is this
[39:36] uncircumcised Philistine that he should
[39:39] defy the armies of the Living God he's
[39:42] having a shamgar
[39:44] moment shamgar wait a minute these
[39:47] uncircumcised Philistines are going to
[39:48] come and take my corn take my barley
[39:51] take my we that I've worked hard for
[39:53] they've got no right to this David shows
[39:55] up in the battlefield and here's all all
[39:57] these Soldiers with armor and Spear and
[40:00] victories under their belt and all he's
[40:01] got is some cheese and
[40:03] corn and he shows up and he said well
[40:05] who is this guy that's going to defy the
[40:07] armies of the Living God and the people
[40:08] answered him after this manner saying so
[40:09] shall it be done to the man that kth him
[40:12] and elab his eldest brother heard when
[40:14] he spake unto the
[40:16] men and eliab's anger was kindled
[40:19] against David wait
[40:21] what I mean David's coming up saying who
[40:24] is this guy that's gonna who is this guy
[40:26] trash talking
[40:27] the the army of the Living God why are
[40:30] we letting this guy guy Mad Dog us why
[40:32] are we letting him talk trash why are we
[40:34] letting him say these things who what
[40:36] what what are you going to give to the
[40:37] guy and I guess maybe by the question
[40:38] they thought maybe David was considering
[40:40] being the solution what will they give
[40:42] to the man who kills this one and his
[40:44] brother is angry against David he said
[40:46] why comest thou hither with whom hast
[40:48] thou left those few sheep in the
[40:50] wilderness I Know Thy pride and the
[40:52] naughtiness of thine heart for thou art
[40:54] come down that th mightest see the
[40:56] battle I love David's response here and
[40:59] David said what now what have I done now
[41:02] is there not a
[41:03] cause in other words as as as as I
[41:07] looked at this he's saying and a lot of
[41:09] people agree to this that he's
[41:11] saying why are you upset at these
[41:14] words is this really a reason to be mad
[41:16] at me what have I done do you even have
[41:19] a reason to be
[41:21] mad he's asking elab you're mad at me
[41:25] you really really mad at me where these
[41:27] really fighting
[41:29] words and then I I took it and turned it
[41:31] around a little bit is there not a
[41:34] cause do we not have something to fight
[41:37] for and it struck
[41:40] me here's a guy defying the army of the
[41:43] Living God and talking trash to the
[41:45] children of Israel and and a young boy
[41:47] comes up and says who's this guy to talk
[41:49] trash about us and they're not angry at
[41:51] the trash talker they're angry at
[41:55] David that's trick the devil plays on us
[41:58] on us quite a bit where we're not mad at
[42:00] the right thing we get mad at each other
[42:03] and not the devil we get mad at the
[42:05] person who's asking the right questions
[42:07] instead of the one who's causing the
[42:10] problem in other words David saying
[42:12] these are fighting words and you're mad
[42:14] at me for asking questions and so I ask
[42:16] us who are we
[42:18] fighting what are we fighting with what
[42:20] are we fighting for in the sermon life
[42:23] brother B said that way we're in a great
[42:24] battle and we're battling sin not one
[42:27] another if we're going to fight one
[42:29] another then Satan can sit back and just
[42:31] let us fight it
[42:32] out while we're fighting each other he
[42:35] doesn't have to even do anything but
[42:36] let's turn everything we got towards the
[42:38] kingdom and put our shoulders one with
[42:39] the other start moving upward and work
[42:41] for there because I don't think we got
[42:43] too much
[42:44] longer certainly not if we could do that
[42:47] we don't go toe-to-toe with each other
[42:50] we stand shoulder to shoulder if we draw
[42:53] swords it's against the enemy CU this is
[42:55] a great battle and we're battling sin
[42:57] we're not even battling The Sinner we're
[43:00] battling sin we're not fighting one
[43:01] another so easy in this battle and this
[43:03] Warfare it's one of the things I was
[43:05] preaching on Saturday night in the cost
[43:07] of War things can get so thick and you
[43:09] know things that you that aren't right
[43:10] you stand against sin that what when
[43:12] you're fighting for principal you you in
[43:15] the kind of the shock of the battle
[43:16] you're you're not fighting again for the
[43:18] principal anymore you start fighting
[43:19] against people that's right and it's in
[43:21] the thick of the battle there's Friendly
[43:23] Fire and there's those that are wounded
[43:24] in the house of friends why because the
[43:26] battle gets thick it gets hot you're
[43:28] fighting for principle and before you
[43:29] know it you're just fighting against
[43:30] people and you forgot what are we
[43:31] fighting for where did this all start
[43:35] and if you could work your way back you
[43:36] might find there was something in the
[43:37] beginning that was worth the fight but
[43:40] in the battle you lose you lose your
[43:43] focus if we're going to fight one
[43:45] another Satan can just sit back and let
[43:46] us fight it
[43:48] out and the sermon faith is our Victory
[43:51] BL re recognizes uh two daughters the
[43:53] Fulkerson daughters and he says God
[43:55] rebuke that devil that's hindering you
[43:57] beautiful little girls May the power
[44:00] that raised Jesus from the G grave cast
[44:02] that thing away and never bother you no
[44:03] more I say that on the authority of
[44:06] God's word you have to get angry with
[44:09] the
[44:11] devil here was a spirit AO on these two
[44:13] girls something afflicting them and he
[44:16] and he rebukes the devil and he says man
[44:18] it never bother you anymore I say in the
[44:20] authority of God's word you have to get
[44:22] angry with the devil God give us the
[44:25] victory we've got it right now this is
[44:27] the victory that overcomes the world
[44:28] even your faith come on we're not angry
[44:31] with one another we're angry at sin
[44:33] we're not angry at The Sinner we're
[44:34] angry with
[44:36] sin we're not battling each other we're
[44:38] battling the devil we've got to get
[44:40] angry with the devil he says in the
[44:42] sermon what is that in your hand he says
[44:44] just get a little mad at the Devil this
[44:47] is a shamgar moment just get a little
[44:49] mad at the Devil say you're old lion
[44:51] Rascal you're a liar Christ made me free
[44:53] I don't have to sit like this no more
[44:55] get out of here told the lion with him
[44:57] brother he hasn't got a bit of authority
[45:00] Jesus stripped him of every legal right
[45:02] he had when he died at
[45:04] Calvary therefore he's a
[45:06] bluff if he's been stripped of every
[45:08] legal right that he had on Calvary if he
[45:10] was stripped of every legal right he's
[45:12] just
[45:13] bluffing he does have the color of title
[45:15] he's just a
[45:16] squatter he says just get a little mad
[45:18] at the Devil we're in a great battle not
[45:22] battling one another should I we
[45:23] shouldn't be mad at each other even if
[45:26] you do something to make me mad I need
[45:29] to take a step back and realize it's not
[45:31] the person it's the spirit behind it
[45:35] that's what it is I I I can't get angry
[45:38] at my brother if I get angry at my
[45:39] brother that's a that's a distraction
[45:41] that gets me fighting the wrong cause
[45:42] because our our Warfare though we walk
[45:44] after the flesh we do not war after the
[45:46] flesh if someone sins it's not the
[45:48] person themselves that is the problem
[45:51] it's a spirit it's an
[45:54] influence and you actually treat it in
[45:56] such a way to you can save their
[46:00] soul I need to move forward in this but
[46:03] as brother brandham says that we're you
[46:05] got to get angry with the devil just get
[46:07] a little mad at the Devil that's what
[46:09] shamgar did finally said enough is
[46:11] enough time to fight for
[46:13] it no more excuses well I'm not trained
[46:17] not blaming anybody else I I could just
[46:20] imagine shamgar sitting there going he
[46:22] walked right by walked right through
[46:23] obadiah's field Jethro's field Joshua
[46:27] the 17th I mean what what's going on
[46:30] here anybody else want to fight these
[46:32] guys you didn't blame anybody else he
[46:35] just finally said you know what the buck
[46:36] stops
[46:37] here I I'm not going to blame it on the
[46:39] government for not building a bigger
[46:40] wall I'm not going to blame it on the
[46:42] generations before me that didn't do
[46:44] enough to drive out the Philistines I'm
[46:45] not going to blame it on anybody else I
[46:47] can't blame it on my parents I can't
[46:49] blame it on my grandparents I can't
[46:50] blame it on the Unfaithful Pastor I
[46:52] can't blame it on this can't blame it on
[46:54] that I'm GNA stop here and stop putting
[46:56] blame in making excuses I'm gonna look
[46:58] to the answer who's above it all better
[47:00] than it all and say oh God In This
[47:02] Moment right now I need your
[47:05] help no matter what's happened before no
[47:08] matter who's fall even if myself year
[47:10] after year after year I fell in this
[47:12] moment to the Philistines this is the
[47:15] last time I've had
[47:19] enough so brother brandom said shamgar
[47:22] had enough of it convinced and then
[47:24] concerned and tempy shamgar had got
[47:27] enough of it he said I'm convinced that
[47:29] he's God and I'm concerned with my
[47:31] family that's all it takes are you
[47:34] convinced tonight are you
[47:37] concerned in Genesis chapter 14 the
[47:40] Bible tells us that Abram Abram heard
[47:41] that his brother was taken captive I
[47:44] love how he calls a lot his
[47:46] brother he wasn't going to get by on
[47:48] some kind of technicality was his
[47:50] brother it's too too often we use this
[47:53] excuse well you know anything against
[47:55] the words my my my enemy well you still
[47:57] got to love
[47:58] them and if I haven't shared it here
[48:00] before I I would expect that I had in
[48:02] our series on who is my neighbor but one
[48:05] of the things God had to rebuke in my
[48:06] heart and correct me before I started
[48:08] the church is this legalistic idea that
[48:11] because someone doesn't see it the same
[48:12] way you do they're not your
[48:14] brother because you reason it out right
[48:17] well if I believe this and this is the
[48:19] truth and this is the revealed word and
[48:21] they don't believe it and you recognize
[48:23] that brother bandam teaches it and that
[48:24] Razor's Edge that this is the truth and
[48:27] if someone denies it or doesn't see it
[48:28] then how can they be my brother it it
[48:30] makes a lot of sense right if they
[48:32] haven't been born by the word and you
[48:33] know that there's only a birth a birth
[48:35] under the word of God you can make this
[48:37] technical distinction well that's not my
[48:39] brother but the eror wasn't necessarily
[48:41] in that they saw it differently and that
[48:43] was wrong the eror is that by my own
[48:46] confession I was saying they never could
[48:47] see
[48:49] it I said well you're my brother if you
[48:51] see it right and if you don't see it
[48:53] right you'll never see it right so I
[48:54] want even confess your brother
[48:58] instead of saying brother believing that
[49:00] if the same Grace quickened the word to
[49:01] me May it Quicken it to them and by the
[49:03] confession of my mouth I speak Grace
[49:05] over them that they too one day could
[49:07] come into the understanding the
[49:09] revelation of what God had done for me
[49:11] and so there's actually power in call
[49:13] them brother if they pastor this church
[49:14] they Pastor that church it why do we
[49:16] need to withhold the
[49:18] blessing it's not a blessing of of
[49:20] vindicating what they believe it's not
[49:22] the blessing of affirming that they're
[49:24] right but it's the blessing that as God
[49:26] had Grace on me may he have Grace on you
[49:30] too and I call you
[49:32] brother not because we see it the same
[49:35] way but because I believe in the grace
[49:37] of God to let us see
[49:39] it that was the sin of the the 10 spies
[49:42] when they crossed over if they would
[49:44] have crossed over and came back and said
[49:46] I can't possess it they would have been
[49:47] right but they said we can't and that's
[49:50] where they were
[49:52] wrong they if they would have just said
[49:54] hey as for me I can't do it God would
[49:55] have said he's right but when he said we
[49:57] can't and said Joshua and Caleb couldn't
[49:59] that's when they were wrong and when we
[50:01] withhold that blessing we're not only
[50:03] saying we're saying you
[50:05] can't we need to be
[50:08] careful Abraham saw the lot was
[50:13] taken the Bible says he went after
[50:15] him he took his trained
[50:19] servants pursued them unto
[50:22] Dan he divided himself against them he
[50:24] and his servants by night and smoted
[50:26] them
[50:27] pursued them un hoba which is on the
[50:29] left hand of
[50:30] Damascus Abraham when when you read
[50:32] about Abraham how many chapters in are
[50:35] spent in the Book of Genesis on
[50:37] Abraham's military
[50:39] training how many are spent on on his
[50:41] boot camps training Men of War and how
[50:43] many other places do you find that he
[50:45] was some kind of Jedi Warrior or ninja
[50:47] or you know some kind of you know some
[50:49] special powers where he could do the
[50:50] things he's doing here nowhere if
[50:52] anything it just sounds like he got his
[50:54] servants who worked for him in his
[50:55] farming and and and with his cattle and
[50:58] and he says come on grab your Ox gos and
[51:00] grab your pruning shares your pruning
[51:03] Hooks and your plow shares and come on
[51:05] let's
[51:06] go the guy's just over there you know
[51:08] he's the one that cooks and he's just
[51:09] grinding he's got his mortar and pestal
[51:11] over there and says yeah just bring that
[51:13] guy's just running them after the rock
[51:14] and a pest what am I going to do with
[51:16] this don't worry you'll find a use for
[51:21] it they can smell the lavender from 300
[51:25] yards away and they just get real slow
[51:26] sleepy all things work together for the
[51:30] good and it says he brought back verse
[51:32] 16 he brought back all the goods also
[51:35] got brought again his brother lot and
[51:37] his goods and the women also and the
[51:39] people why because he was concerned for
[51:42] his
[51:43] brother and he wasn't with just willing
[51:45] to let him go I think sometimes they're
[51:47] just too quick to let people go they
[51:50] start to backslide they start to wonder
[51:52] something happens we're just too quick
[51:53] to let them go you may not need to chase
[51:55] after them and grab them but get down on
[51:57] your knees before God and fight for him
[51:58] in prayer oh God have mercy on that
[52:01] family we haven't seen in a while have
[52:03] mercy on that brother we haven't seen
[52:05] while oh God go to their aid go to their
[52:12] defense in 2 Samuel 23: 8-12 it begins
[52:16] to describe David's Mighty Men says
[52:19] these be the M names of the Mighty Men
[52:21] whom David had and I'm just going to
[52:22] read through them and not amplify these
[52:24] things the T night that s sat in the
[52:26] seat Chief among the captains the same
[52:29] was adino the eite he lift up his spear
[52:33] again against 800 whom he slew at one
[52:38] time
[52:40] what this guy slew 800 with a spear you
[52:44] don't think he got
[52:46] angry right he wasn't
[52:49] sleepwalking he didn't accidentally do
[52:51] this and after him was elzer the son of
[52:54] Dodo the aite one of the three might men
[52:57] with David when they defied the
[52:58] Philistines that were gathered together
[52:59] to battle and the men of Israel were
[53:01] gone away it's just a few guys and he
[53:03] arose and smot the Philistines until his
[53:05] hand was weary and his hand clave Into
[53:07] The Sword and the Lord wrought a great
[53:09] victory that day he fought so hard to
[53:12] where he could even let go of the
[53:15] sword and when just all these men had
[53:17] left and it was just three mighty men
[53:18] with David and they gathered together
[53:20] against the Philistines and the Lord
[53:22] wrought a great victory that day by
[53:24] whose
[53:25] hand who fastened that hand by his own
[53:28] willingness to take a hold of it and use
[53:30] it God made sure it was fastened to it
[53:32] and the people returned after him only
[53:34] to spoil and after him was shamma the
[53:37] son of age the herit and the Philistines
[53:41] are gathered together into a troop I
[53:43] came across this studying about shamgar
[53:45] where was a piece of ground full of
[53:47] lentils and the people fled from among
[53:50] the
[53:51] Philistines but he stood in the midst of
[53:53] the
[53:54] ground and defended it and slew the
[53:57] Philistines and the Lord wrought a great
[54:01] Victory let us be the ones that are
[54:02] willing to stand in the middle of the
[54:04] field even if everyone else runs away
[54:07] stand in the Middle Field in the face of
[54:09] the enemy saying it's not my power it's
[54:11] not my idea but stand in the midst of
[54:14] the ground and defend
[54:16] it Lord I'm willing to stand it may look
[54:19] like it's going to cost me my life but
[54:21] Lord I'm willing to stand why why are
[54:23] you willing to fight for it this is my
[54:25] land This is my I promise this is life
[54:28] or death he stood in the midst of the
[54:30] ground and he defended and slew the
[54:32] Philistines and the Lord rought a great
[54:36] Victory how did he rot a great Victory
[54:38] because one man was willing to stand in
[54:39] the middle of a field of
[54:41] lentils I say ah lentils don't really
[54:43] like them anyways let's just leave he's
[54:46] like no this is our
[54:48] ground could have been Acres of Brussels
[54:50] sprouts have you ever roasted them with
[54:52] a little bit of
[54:53] salt fantastic
[54:56] stand your ground doesn't matter
[54:59] god-given ground is it is it worth
[55:01] fighting for that's where we're ending
[55:04] last Wednesday night if it's worth if
[55:07] it's worth keeping says if it's not
[55:09] worth fighting for it's not worth
[55:11] having stand in the midst of the ground
[55:13] and defend it and how did he def how did
[55:16] how did God write a great Victory
[55:17] because one man was willing to stand in
[55:19] the middle of the
[55:20] field we say oh well the Lord will do it
[55:22] the Lord will fight the battles well you
[55:24] there better be someone willing to step
[55:26] up
[55:27] and say the battle is the
[55:29] Lord's David knew the battle was the
[55:31] Lord's but he knew that someone had to
[55:33] stand against the Philistine someone had
[55:36] to stand and say I defy
[55:38] you may God have your head for speaking
[55:41] this way against the army of the Living
[55:45] God we got to fight for
[55:47] it that's what we need we need to fight
[55:50] for
[55:50] it this battle is
[55:53] unrelenting I think maybe it was
[55:55] Saturday I mentioned this that we have
[55:56] the saying you're either in a in a trial
[55:58] coming out of a trial or going into a
[55:59] trial I don't think that works anymore I
[56:03] think you're in a trial while you're
[56:04] coming out of a trial and before you
[56:05] come into a trial and they just all
[56:07] overlap right I mean there's no hard
[56:10] reset you're like wo this feels good
[56:14] right it's just like oh oh oh yeah oh oh
[56:17] oh oh oh no whoa and and it's just every
[56:20] once in a while you get a devil off of
[56:22] you only for another one to jump on and
[56:24] you know what you say oh you want some
[56:25] of this too you see what I did to the
[56:27] last guy you're probably always in one
[56:30] just as you come out of one and going
[56:31] into another you're always fighting at
[56:33] the end of this Leo toan age it's going
[56:36] to be a fight going to be a battle it's
[56:37] going to be hard but God promised he'd
[56:38] be with
[56:40] you may seem like you're all alone in
[56:42] the field of lentils but stand your
[56:44] ground be willing to defend this
[56:46] Ground God will fight your battles and r
[56:49] a great Victory
[56:52] am and
[56:53] the I want to use a statement I came
[56:56] came across one time um I keep referring
[56:58] to Saturday night it's not just because
[57:00] you're here from Flagstaff but uh I'm
[57:02] rejoicing what God did for you too
[57:04] brother Isaac but uh I used a statement
[57:07] that was
[57:08] written uh think in the old gray lady in
[57:11] New York Times it was in uh 1867 it was
[57:15] a statement about how this war has
[57:16] touched everything the Civil War and
[57:19] left nothing is it
[57:21] founded and and and that speaks to the
[57:24] cost of War
[57:26] but I want to just back up and P think
[57:28] about the war right now that moment that
[57:31] time of the
[57:32] war and this is a battle that been
[57:36] raging for a couple years at this moment
[57:39] I'm referring to as the summer of
[57:41] 1863 not time for another ballad but
[57:44] sounds poetic summer of
[57:47] 63 but the momentum was on the
[57:49] Confederate side even at this very
[57:51] moment that I'm referring to leading up
[57:53] to the Battle of Gettysburg
[57:56] Europe was contemplating joining the
[57:58] sides with the rebels and they were
[58:00] standing ready to join the war and
[58:02] completely destroy the
[58:03] union and because of a number of
[58:06] Victories the south then moved into
[58:07] Union territory for the first
[58:10] time and and they're poised to win a
[58:13] tremendous battle on Northern soil and
[58:16] in doing so Europe would join the fight
[58:18] against the union it would have toppled
[58:19] the the nation
[58:20] forever but it was that summer in July
[58:23] as these armies gathered in the uh Union
[58:26] chasing this way and the uh the rebels
[58:29] coming up from the south and then moving
[58:31] East and it looked as if they're going
[58:32] to try to March their way into DC so the
[58:34] Union Army comes to stand between them
[58:37] uh the the rebels and Washington DC and
[58:39] they're all zeroing in on this one spot
[58:43] Gettysburg and it was that battle that
[58:45] changed the tide of the
[58:47] war and the night the day that that
[58:49] battle started July 1st
[58:52] 1863 there was a private named Benedict
[58:56] and just hold that I'll ceue it brother
[58:57] John here just a moment he was of the 12
[59:00] Pennsylvania reserves this is where he
[59:02] was from
[59:05] Pennsylvania fighting a war a battle for
[59:07] the first time on his own soil it's one
[59:09] thing to go down to Virginia another
[59:10] thing maybe to go down and to Alabama
[59:12] it's one thing to fight these battles in
[59:13] Tennessee and all these other places but
[59:15] now it was on his
[59:17] doorstep maybe it was one thing for
[59:19] shamgar to hear about this and to hear
[59:20] about that maybe it's one thing to hear
[59:22] about all these battles but now it was
[59:23] right on his
[59:24] territory and on July 1st 1863 and I
[59:27] want this to inspire you this is what he
[59:29] wrote in his journal there's no nonsense
[59:32] about
[59:32] us we've been in the service long enough
[59:35] to know that fighting is no Child's Play
[59:39] but we want to be led against the enemy
[59:43] now because we are determined to drive
[59:45] him out of our state or perish in the
[59:49] attempt this ought to inspire us he has
[59:53] this attitude as this Soldier he'd been
[59:55] in the service for for two years it
[59:57] wasn't like he had just joined the week
[59:59] before and said I didn't sign up for
[1:00:00] this I don't want to be fighting on my
[1:00:01] own soil no he had been in the he had
[1:00:03] been in the Army long enough I can say
[1:00:05] the same thing about everyone that's in
[1:00:07] this room tonight you've been in this
[1:00:09] message long enough you've been trying
[1:00:11] to serve God long enough to know that
[1:00:13] fighting is no Child's Play that we're
[1:00:16] not just playing Church we're not just
[1:00:17] coming here for a picnic there's no
[1:00:20] nonsense about us and in this Warfare
[1:00:22] that ought to be the attitude that we
[1:00:24] have there is no nonsense about us we
[1:00:28] must be engaged in this battle we've
[1:00:30] been in the message we've been in the
[1:00:31] service of the Lord long enough to know
[1:00:34] that this is no child's place no Child's
[1:00:37] Play and we want to be led against the
[1:00:39] enemy
[1:00:40] now why because we are determined to
[1:00:43] drive him out of our land out of our
[1:00:46] state out of our homes out of our lives
[1:00:49] or die
[1:00:51] fighting I'm determined to drive them
[1:00:53] out and drive them out with everything
[1:00:56] that's in me and if I've got to Die Why
[1:00:58] trying I'm going to die while
[1:01:01] fighting is that not what Peter
[1:01:03] cartright said that when he was told by
[1:01:04] God to go hold a Revival and he had one
[1:01:07] job he knew he was going to have a
[1:01:08] Revival so he showed up and what was he
[1:01:10] doing washing windows cuz that's what it
[1:01:12] was going to take to have a Revival then
[1:01:13] a bully showed up pulled the C back to
[1:01:16] show me had a gun says if you're going
[1:01:18] to have a Revival you're gonna have to
[1:01:18] whip me first you know what Peter said
[1:01:20] well then that's the next
[1:01:23] job climbed down the ladder took his
[1:01:25] coat off and said said if I got to have
[1:01:26] a Revival I got to wash windows and I
[1:01:28] got to put up chairs and now this guy
[1:01:29] shows up and says if I'm going to have a
[1:01:31] Revival I got to beat him up I didn't
[1:01:32] know I had to beat up somebody Lord but
[1:01:34] if I must ran I must fight rolled up his
[1:01:36] sleeves and beat the tar out of the guy
[1:01:38] because it was the next
[1:01:40] job as the devil came in confront of me
[1:01:43] said then that's what I got to do we
[1:01:44] want to be led against the enemy
[1:01:46] now or die fighting man I'll never
[1:01:49] forget when I was in a chapel when I
[1:01:52] went to private school probably maybe
[1:01:54] fourth or fifth grade or something and
[1:01:56] uh I remember was a a guy a few grades
[1:01:59] above me Jeff Roberts it was his brother
[1:02:02] that was a pastor of a Baptist Church in
[1:02:03] the middle of nowhere probably
[1:02:04] Independent Baptist and we were used to
[1:02:06] the southern baptist uh style of
[1:02:09] preaching there at those chapels and
[1:02:10] this guy got up there and he was on fire
[1:02:14] and he was preaching I know you've heard
[1:02:16] this before story before was the first
[1:02:17] time I ever heard it and he said he was
[1:02:19] going to fight the devil and punch him
[1:02:20] until his hands fell off kick him until
[1:02:22] his feet fell off and then bite him
[1:02:24] until his gun teeth fell off and then
[1:02:26] gum them to
[1:02:28] death that's about how we ought to feel
[1:02:30] about
[1:02:31] it that they finally do an autopsy on
[1:02:34] the devil it's like well we can see the
[1:02:35] teeth marks but it looks like he died by
[1:02:38] gumming right I'm not going to give up
[1:02:42] this is my land this is my promise
[1:02:44] remember be sure you're fighting for the
[1:02:46] right thing and if you know you're
[1:02:47] fighting for the right thing then fight
[1:02:49] for
[1:02:51] it there's no nonsense about us fight
[1:02:55] for it
[1:02:56] God bless you today let's
[1:03:00] stand I want to be led against the enemy
[1:03:03] now because I'm
[1:03:06] determined determined to fight until the
[1:03:09] end
