TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I know we're past the middle part of the year but we're continuing on uh subject we start at the very beginning on the house of the Lord and these things are I'm keeping it within this uh Channel and this subject of the house of the Lord because these things have been inspired by the different subjects we've already ministered on in this subject of the house of the Lord and I'll I want to do part two on the big three and we did Sunday on the first part I'll take time uh just to recapture some of that in the outset but I will tell you tonight I just want to do uh two things I want to show that money women and popularity are connected with the big three and for some of the visitors think of the big three give me their names brother Aaron want to know who they are but um I want to just show that money women in popularity are connected with that big three and number two those of us who are familiar with the money women and popularity I want us to understand it applies to us all not just preachers and I'm glad to have a pastor here tonight who can really get behind me on this now in first John 2: 16 And1 17 this is where we'll see what I'm calling the big three for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever so here in John chapter 1 John Chapter 2 we could see what I'm calling the big three the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life brother bandom shows us that these three uh things that are all that is in the world are the three ways that Jesus was tempted in the wilderness and was also present in the Temptation and the Garden of Eden and then in the Ser sermon Harvest Time which we've been studying out of for quite some time now he says the three Temptations of Jesus the three Temptations of ministers today where they make the fall three Temptations of the church and where they make their fall three Temptations of an organization where it makes its fall and the three Temptations in the individual and where they make their fall now if John says all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life then we're not necessarily coming up with 12 to 15 different Temptations but we'll find that these three Temptations would have root in any one of these three to ministers to churches to organizations or individuals I have to come back to it sometime uh even if it's not exactly specifically the same thing it'd have to come back to one of these big three now let me just go through by review very quick Qui L on these three in lust of the flesh we looked at how this implies some lack of moderation lack of self-control uh some intemperance and it was putting bodily hunger above uh anything else and bodily hunger bodily thirst whatever that body wants it goes first we saw how the Bible says I've esteemed your word more than my necessary meat and had a brother tell me that on on earlier this week I think it was yesterday that he and his wife had been really wrestling with something I said on Sunday and said that uh they usually use vanity uh to Oppo overcome gluttony or gluttony to overcome vanity and they haven't been able to eat since W uh Sunday and I said well just choose the lesser of two evils and he said my wife is baking right now and so we did want to kind of focus on the idea that you it's kind of whenever the what Sprite has told us to do obey your thirst right that if the body wants something go get it feed it satisfy it and this was Satan's first line of attack with Jesus in Luke chapter 4 where he tempted him when he was hungry to turn stones to bread and Jesus was very quick to say I'm hungry and I do need to eat if I if this body is going to be sustained but man shall not live by bread alone the bodily hunger uh the the senses of this body do not govern us ultimately but the word must be our meat and so it was uh we could see the wrong emphasis being put on it the wrong perception and priorities even in the garden when the woman was tempted when in Genesis 3:6 the woman saw that the tree was good for food so the wrong kind of emphasis was placed on it that she was Finding feelings in her body and this desire to satisfy things saw it as good for food and her priorities are wrong and her perception was wrong that's in the lust of the eyes we saw that it was uh satisfying the pleasures of our imagination and this uh The Temptations of vain entertainment and to covet things that are visible and to uh want what you see and how that that pertained though there were outward things that we see but that eye is a gate to the spirit and how we'd have these senses in our spirit how the eye brother B says almost governs them all even in our natural senses and it's a governing of our spiritual senses to where there's things that you're lusting after and you want and it has more to do with the Optics of things uh and what it makes your spirit feel and so Jesus in Luke chapter 4 he was offered all the kingdoms shall shown all of them in a moment and they were offered to him and it would have spoke to Something in Jesus's heart like yeah this is this is something you want isn't it something you want but it was contrary to the will of God and and and not in the right order the right way that it ought to be enjoyed or to be received and then in Genesis 3:6 the woman saw that the tree was pleasant saw it as pleasant to the eyes different than um good for food and it's different than being beautiful but it was pleasant to the eyes other some something excited in her spirit I think I've used the example before the way that she was looking at this fruit is not the way that we look at a really good green chili burrito am it was now something in her spirit to lust and to desire after so she saw it as pleasant and then the pride of life and the pride of life there's a whole lot here that's we touched on it very quickly on Sunday this desire for recognition or honor uh the seeking of attention or certainly seeking of status and and position there was this try to point out um and not in great detail but very quickly how it's kind of showing off where the Pharisees wanted to make broad their felies and how many how many people went and looked it up right and they wanted to make things look bigger where they kept the word their Scrolls and they wanted to make their garments look a certain way because they wanted to be noticed and so they were kind of uh like peacocks trying to show off a little bit or maybe black birds with peacock feathers they were wanting to show off and make themselves look like something they weren't so they're coming across as hypocrites and in there we see that there's the wrong motivation maybe maybe they're you're doing the right thing but your your motivation and objective is wrong because you're trying to call attention to yourself and in Luke chapter 4 you can find these also in Matthew 4 Satan tempted Christ to tempt God he tempted him to tempt God by wanting him to jump off the Pinnacle of the temple in front of everybody and force God to rescue him and he says Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God and brother bradam uh equated that to uh snake handlers and those that drink poison and some of those things and he said answer that question I'm among snake handlers what about it and so there's this uh a show where I want to God said he would keep us from getting snake bit so let's just tempt God by handling snakes and God said that he would rescue you if you jump down before all the people in the temple and then God will come and back up his word won't he back up his word and so there was this tempting him to force God to do something publicly to vindicate him to prove he was what the Son of God right and the woman in Genesis 3 she lusted for knowledge she saw that the tree was be to be desired to make one wise and she wanted to know beyond what was right she wanted to know beyond what was holy she wanted knowledge of of Good and Evil something that God had withheld from her in his wisdom so those are that's the big three and now money women in popularity I believe that these can line up with the lust of the flesh the of the eyes and the pride of life now I'm going to take uh years worth of statements or covering over years worth of or just the entirety of brother bram's Ministry just some quick bullet points of things that he said he said money women and popularity are three things that a minister must watch he says it that that hurt ministers that hinder a minister that bring a minister back to the rut that wreck a ministers life from the start uh how many of you already had those memorized right just da da da da you can read them off they he must watch this it hurts ministers it hinders a minister it brings them back to a rut uh it wrecks his ministry or his life from the start these three things money women and popularity and this is what brother BR says often when he's talking about ministers and one thing that I thought was very interesting and I've kind of got lost in it in studying maybe distracted might be a better word is that brother random usually mentions this when he's telling the story about the third pole and about the vision coming to him and where he was at in his life and quitting wanting to come off the field and he owed a bunch of money in California and uh and he didn't want to be pulling for money and so it's within the context of God showing him how great his ministry was going to be in the Vindication of his ministry that he brings these things out about money women and popularity and how he studied the scripture and he's seen things and how these things will hurt or hinder or cause a minister to fall into a rod or wreck his life now in 1 Timothy 4:6 we see that it's ministers that brother bam typically addresses in this if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good Doctrine whereinto thou Hast attained I like this because we could say that Timothy was filled with the Holy Ghost that he was following after the prophet's Ministry he was being taught and the prophet is teaching him that you're to be nourished up in the word of faith and the good Doctrine which you've already attained to so no matter how many years we spend in the message of the hour we ought to be growing I I'll let let the cat out of the bag my working title for a series of sermons that I'm thinking about ministering is message daycare just chew on that for a little bit but we should be nourished up in the words of faith and good doctrine that we've already attained to but nourished up in it and I would say that Paul no doubt admonishes Timothy along the same lines that brother brandham uh is teaching ministers are referencing a minister that watch these things we must watch these things hurt or hinder or cause you to to get back into a w or wreck of life I'm sure that Paul is admonishing Timothy in much the same way and this the money women and popularity brother Bram always ties this Trinity to a trap or weakness for ministers or preachers whenever whenever I've read it that's who he he zeros in on initially in the sermon the second Miracle he said there's three things that I've watched in my life in the reading of other ministers when God blesses a minister just a little bit he goes now we're all friends aren't we me must have just felt like I'm in a good place I can say this he says when he blesses him just a little bit above maybe someone else or give him an opportunity to do a little more work for him or something the first thing that Satan goes to working with that minister is three things he says major things the first thing is money women popularity I found in many places where he says the first thing is and he mentions these three things so the first thing is money women popularity he'll work on him with money or if he can get him to like his first bait that's like in the Garden of Eden so now he's making this connection between money women and popularity and how he tried to use the bait in the Garden of Eden says well or if he can get him to thinking he's something when he ain't nothing he's got him right then so there's this humility that we must carry ourselves with and we could say that this is directed at the ministers that are here tonight and there's just maybe a few of us here and so we don't mind being examined by the word of God if you're going to handle it you better be judged by it and I I was just thinking today that the easiest way to not be judged by something is just to reject it as true just to reject it as as being right that way you don't have to be judged by it but I believe these things are true and then in the sermon the angel of God he said if a minister three things if he goes to full and with he's ruined that is first thing was money then women and then popularity when he goes to thinking he's someone right there he's on his Road out that's right so there's these three things it's often mentioned in this way where it's putting a bull's eye on a minister a and if he goes fooling with this money women are popularity and he and he he surfaces Pride a little bit here if he gets to thinking he's something then he's on his Road out now I I believe that we would all agree and all of us is just Believers not ministers if we agree if you agree with this and believe this is true understand it go ahead and say Amen am all right so ministers must watch these things hurt ministers it hinders a minister it brings him back to a run it'll recom Minister his life these are things that he must watch that he must be on guard for if he goes to full in with it he's ruined so you don't want to fool with it you don't want to get mixed up in it now in 1 Timothy 4:12 Paul's telling Timothy says let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the Believers in Word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in Purity now I maybe I can't remember just how much I have here but I believe that I could establish that money women in popularity and maybe we've already seen enough here to see that maybe you could just see how there's some connection to lust of the eyes lust of the Flesh and the pride of life and and that whe however you would want to arrange that and put it together there's got to be some there's some continuity to that so what I'm I'm wanting to begin to focus on is that this applies to all of us not just ministers so to the minister he says let no man despise thy youth he's a good minister of Jesus Christ as Paul said and if you can be nourished up in these words of faith and good Doctrine uh then you're going to be successful or you'll be able to help other people so he says let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the Believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity in other words as Paul is telling Timothy that he's a good minister of Jesus Christ and as a minister you must be an example of Believers to Believers that you're an example not only within but you're also an example without and so that your life matters and because you are a minister of the gospel and because you are to be an example of the Believers and to Believers Satan would love to shape your image he would love to design you in the same way that he's been successful in designing the woman if there is a Ministry to be had and a minister is handling the word of God and he's to be an example Satan would love to confuse the example shape the example do something to the example Timothy is told by Paul neglect not the gift that is in thee this gift that was in him was with the purpose in Christ useful to the body of Christ and therefore it was something that he had to honor something that he had to be conscious of something that was helpful to Elizabeth and I in our family is we realize that God calling us to minister the gospel myself being called to be a minister that as a family we had to honor that gift we had to in some ways serve that gift and recognize that it was something that was special to the people of God and not not mine in particular but just that gift and so there was a respect that you had for it and therefore it governed your conduct remember how that brother brandham tells the story many many times that as a young child this voice spoke from the bush and said from that tree don't ever smoke or drink or defile your body in any way there'll be a work for you to do when you get older and that smoke drink or defile your body you could see the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life brother R in other places brings it down to women and these other things you could see money women and popularity he tells them three things don't drink smoke or defile your body in any way because as a prophet who's going to have a message just think of how can confusing the gospel could have been yes sir if these things existed in his testimony if these things were there and he's going to be teaching marriage and divorce teaching on Satan's Eden sh preaching on these very relevant things in this day and age of sexual perversion in leod DEA and so God is telling them is you better keep yourself now because Satan would sure love to cause confusion on these things and I think it's a shame the more we get along with these modern uh interpret ations of the Bible and and Lifestyles and past that people have they're just trying to water down the truth of God's word instead will humble themselves to it sir so continuing to Timothy and looking at Timothy as an example Paul says to him in verse 7 but refuse profane and old wives fables now I think you could have a lot of fun with this and I begin to think that today I think you'll find these things social media and uh Twitter X as they call it now X formerly known as Twitter and they're just fables and there's just endless speculation and he's telling the man of God to refuse profane and old wives fables I I think it's it's very a very large heading that covers this these irrational fantasies and these endless questions and genealogies and debates and fables and all these different stories he said refuse them it it it it might be instructive today to say you know a man of God probably should be avoiding uh uh you know getting mixed up in social media and these different ways and these different channels not that he couldn't use them for good but don't be getting your information from there all right come on I'll just be honest I I don't know how many times I've been uh well I got to be careful how I say this but being in different chat groups and things and you'll find maybe a group of ministers are all part of a chat and somebody send something through on a Wednesday morning and all the ministers are like oh my goodness we never knew this and you've got to be the guy that says uh that's not real come on knowing that if you don't say anything people from their pulpits are going to be saying did you read the paper did you see this did you see that it's completely fabricated and I think that it kind of speaks to just how important it is that the one that is is ministering or the one that gets uh has FaceTime with the people and would go for song leaders and musicians and different people in positions that be careful what you're feeding on uh because he Paul has being teaching Timothy refus profane in old wise fables but he says exercise thyself rather un godliness there's something better to spend your time in right and then he says for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable so what does that refer to well bodily exercise at least it profits some and maybe some of us need more more bodily exercise and maybe we want to get a little profit out of it but just being all excited and working yourself up and different things you can do with the body doesn't have as much profit as godliness is profitable that's right brother brandom often called out how emotional people could be and how Sensational things could be but the most important thing is how you lived your life right it's profitable unto all things having the promise of the life that now is so it'll profit you now and that which is to come he says this is a faithful Saint and worthy of all except ation not just for ministers but all and I believe that as ministers were placed to serve Timothy's being instructed as a servant therefore being servants your visible examples in 2 Corinthians Chapter 3 Verse 6 he says who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life if we were to attribute this to Paul alone I don't I don't believe it would be wrong to say that Paul was speaking of himself and those that are stewards over the mysteries of God as Ministers of the Gospel but I could say that he's made us all able Ministers of the New Testament then he says the letter kth but the spirit giveth life this is why he's not just admonishing Timothy to be well learned and to know the doctrine which thou H has been taught and to rightly divide the word of Truth so that people can understand what I've taught and people know to say what's on the tapes and things like that but it's do do what you ought to do live your sermon uh uh shun these certain things and and act these certain ways because the letter the doctrine of it the letter of it will kill but it's the life the spirit that gives life to it right in the sermon there is a man here that can turn on the light he said life only comes by the word of God made manifest life comes only by the word of God made manifest he repeated himself he says as long as it's just in the book like this it still can be questioned right as long as it's letter as long as it is just Book and Tape for us today it can just be question still be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested then that is light on the word so as long as it's just letter form it doesn't give life or it doesn't speak it doesn't testify but whenever it's life it's lived then it's proved it's Vindicated you have that that Vindication as long as it's just letter can be questioned letter kills but spirit gives life it's proven it's Vindicated and that's so as he says as able Ministers of the New Testament we've got to we we are to spir ad Minister the spirit of it and the life of it not just the letter of it in 1 Peter chapter 5 verses 1 2 3 and 4 the elders which are among you I exhort whom also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed now we recognize speaking to Elders in maybe this office of a bishop or Pastor feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lcer but of a ready mind neither is being Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the flock I believe that you can see the threes in this again feed the flock take oversight and be an example in taking oversight it's willingly and of a ready mind and not is a lord over God's Heritage for filthy lucer and nor by constraint so feed the flock of God take oversight thereof a and and do it not by constraint but willingly not by for filthy lucer but of a ready mind he's he's dealing with money women and popularity lust of the eyes lust of the flesh the pride of life he says but being being examples to the flock so ministers must be examples amen and when the chief Shepherd shall appear you shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away we believe that Christ has provided for us the best example he has shown laid for us a path that we must also take even in his suffering and there's many different scriptures we could use in John 15 he says I or John 17 I've Sanctified myself for your sake he had a right to many different things he maybe was lawful for other things but yet he Sanctified himself as an example for other people's sake that's right Matthew 20: 25 5 to 28 Jesus calls them together he says you know that the prince of the Gentiles the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise Authority upon them so they with a gentile you knew who was boss right you knew who the head guy was because there was just a way that he was going to carry himself and the way that everyone else was going to carry themselves around him to where he likes to exercise Authority he likes to be honored he likes to be recognized likes to be uh kind of separate and apart and so you'd kind of tell that uh that's the one uh that he would be the one demanding you are subject to me you're under my authority they exercise dominion and now Jesus turns this idea on its head and says but it shall not be so among you I believe he's speaking under the New Covenant shall not be so among you whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant amen the chief as it says when the chief Shepherd shall appear this is Christ he is the chief but now he's the shepherd who's become a servant Amen to the flock for somebody else's benefit and he's humbling himself to serve he's humbling himself to look out after something that needs to be taken care of so the one that is the greatest let him be your minister one that is Chief let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many whoever is great among you let let him be your minister whoever is Chief among you let him be your servant whereas under the Gentiles the chief he served to the Gentiles the greatest he served and no doubt you could tell who's who but in the body of Christ let those who are chief let those who are great let them be servants be wonderful if people were in a in a certain setting and they they didn't know who was who because of the respect everybody had for one another the love they showed to one another yes we we are to follow his example as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister see him kneeling to wash his disciples feet and as he came not to be ministered unto to be recognized uh to be benefited from to satisfy his desires or his needs but rather to serve the needs of others we also too must Minister that is what Peter's drawing from when he says that Elders are to feed the flock of God to take oversight thereof and be examples to the flock Jeremiah 3:15 and I will give you pastures according to my heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding it's that persuasiveness that persuasiveness of Love or persuasiveness by Love by way of a per a good example that shows the right way to live and shows the word plainly why are there requirements as we come to it uh for that a man must be the husband of one wife because that's what the Bible teaches that's what the the messenger of the hour comes and teaches you know H uh uh God's going to have a Grace on you we don't have time to fix these things up but don't you ever make a mistake like that again and teach your children not to do it and if you had all the pulpits that preach the word we're saying well I mean I know I've got a couple eyes but you can't people like whatever brother Aaron right it it completely undermines so it's not that ministers have an example that all of us don't have but if you're going to minister the word you have to be servant to the word and willing to subject yourself to it and by God's grace hopefully be a reflection of it sir now again I I say this quite often and I don't say it to be different but no earthly Pastor is your spiritual husband no earthly Pastor is your husband period unless you're married of the literal pastor but still he should live an example we cover this quite often too that headship should demonstrate how to lead a home how to guide children how to influence others our most effective witness in the home before our children is how we live our lives something that's becoming more and more apparent to me as a parent is that no matter how much I try try to teach and instruct my children about screens and screen time the most critical thing in their perception of screen time and their desire for it is how much time I spend on it and they have found time and time again that that at the end of the day that seems to be the biggest issue when it comes to screen time with children not how much you can limit it not what you keep them from but at the end of the day what the parents are doing with it as well and so as a pastor is set as an example and ministers are to live an example brother Bram says in the sermon God keeps his word you go into a church and you'll find usually the way the pastor acts that's the way the congregation will act he says I believe they get one another Spirit instead of the Holy Spirit sometime come on now I believe that we could read this and we could say well that's just the way that it is brother Braham said that's the way it is and that's the way it should be and I don't think that's what he's saying there's times you I remember one time I went to preach at a church and uh it been a while since I preached there and I showed up on a Wednesday night and I had a tie on a suit on dressed like this and the pastor was in a two button Under Armour shirt the Deacon was in a two button Under Armour shirt the trustees were every everybody it's like what is this twins Tabernacle what's going on here everybody was dressed the same I thought maybe they had to have a uniform now and it's because that's the way the pastor dressed that's how everybody ends up dressing when you take on the spirit of the pastor a and if and and if that's what's presented and that's what's expressed and that's what's broadcast and that's what has the preeminence really some people just can't help but do it because it's human nature you go to church you'll find they act the same way he says you take a real good woman and marry her to a no account man he'll either become a gentleman or she'll become no account influence so I guess it's not a a death sentence if a girl good man marries a woman who's or or a good woman marries a no account man just goes to show if she's not watching she's not careful right amen if she's not if she's not the example of the believer she's not honoring the word of God as it says how a wife should honor her husband if she's not doing the things that the Bible says a sister should do I say this even to the point when sisters said oh brother brandham my my husband doesn't believe what you preach and he wants me to go to church with them and brother brandham says brother Theo would say duh go to church with them you don't have to be worry about anything dear you don't have anything to worry about you know the truth why because she has got to be sure to remain a Christian otherwise she can become a no account but if she lives the word of God and she lives it right he can become a gentleman he says you just take one another's Spirit you do birds of a feather flock together and you're a spirit being brother B related it to the influence through the senses and this passage way passage here I believe he says the eye is the gate to the spirit he maybe he says soul and this one but we realize when he's breaking it down by Body Spirit Soul the eye is the gate to the spirit lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh that Pride the influence of an image that is set before you the influence of a person that you're near the influence of parents within a family the influence of what you read what you watch what you see the influence of an example so Paul teaches Timothy again my my premise tonight is I want you to consider whether money women and popularity are somehow related to The Big Three the L of the the flesh less of the eyes and the pride of life and that money women and popularity though in the message is often associated with things that a minister must watch in reality all of us can be hindered by them in the ways that they manifest and it's not just now I'm kind of getting into Sunday morning a little bit it's not that money is the problem because you have a lot of it and it's not just women have a problem because a minister lust after him or he has multiple wives or that popularity becoming pop is a problem there's ways that those things become problems that aren't in those literal ways that we think of in 1 Timothy Chapter 3: 2 to7 now we can realiz this is just prior to the text that we read now he's teaching Timothy more a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife now take your uh own ability your own understanding of how God has dealt with your heart you're understanding the scripture and some of these words here and begin to think of how closely these would connect with the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes the pride of life and how that Paul is also dealing with women money popularity a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife leadership by example headship by example says Vigilant sober of good behavior given to hospitality AB to teach I believe it's this verse here that the Baptist and drafting some of their bylaws and things put that a deacon must be apt to teach but scripturally he's talking about this bishop this office of a pastor here Timothy's being told you ought to be apt to teach then it says not given to Wine no Striker not greedy a filthy looker but patient not a brawler not Covetous lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life money women popularity I'm sure we could all work on this in our home school classes tomorrow morning and come out with a lot of good stuff here one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity for if a man this is the principle look notice this for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the Church of God that that that becomes the man's life that he lives not just the position you grant him not the one that he's taken himself or assumed or was given some time ago or whatever but rather it is something that he he's got to to know how to live he's got to know how to act he has to know how to rule his own house because if you can't live a a private life and and a Sanctified life outside the pulpit you can't guide the Church of God not a novice L being lifted up with pride again I think you see how that connects back into the popularity and these different lust he shall he fall he fall into the condemnation of the devil moreover he must have a good report of them which are without a good report on those who aren't mess message Believers a good report with those who only know him in the neighborhood could you imagine if you went to visit a brother's house and you're invited over for dinner and uh and you knocked on the wrong door and you're sitting there holding your nice freshly baked fail cake a and and you're getting ready to hand it off to the pastor because he's you're thinking he's going to answer the door and they open it up and say oh I'm sorry I thought you were brother so and so or so and so and they Oh you mean that Rascal that liar that cheat that fornicator you be like no I mean the other one obviously like the one who pastors the church that's my pastor oh you're the bunch he pastors I think it would be mortifying and that's exactly what Timothy is pointing or Timothy's being told you got to have a good report even among those who aren't your those you associate lest he fall in reproach and the snare of the devil it's that influence by example and doors in door brother as you go into church and watch the pastor if he's real wild and Carries On the congregation will do the same they take the spirit of one another instead of the Holy Spirit that's the reason we got so much perverted teaching of the Bible why because people take on the pastor Spirit the minister spirit and not the spirit of Christ so whatever he's selling they're buying and they don't exercise the discernment and say whoa wait a minute stop I was with you until then yeah on I was with you until you started deviating from the spirit of the word of God you started deviating from the truth of the word of God you you took a little bit too far I'm sorry my Revelation can't take me there but if you take on the spirit of someone else you can become fanatical like somebody else oh man I never saw that before that's wild that's great that's deep and brother B talks about you could be starch and stiffy or maybe it was starchy and stiff but maybe it is worse to be stiffy but starchy and stiffer you could be wild and into fanaticism but you know what he told the Tabernacle they be thank should be thankful for a sane sensible Pastor that's right who preached the Full Gospel full of power but preach the full word sane and sensible brother M says you go into a church where the pastor's kind of a flighty wild fired up in a moabit please brother brand expound upon that flighty Wildfire up moabit watch the congregation be the same thing not because we ought to right I don't want you all going to get JDs and practice insecurities law there not enough work to go around right you you just take on the spirit of your pastor no matter how nice and kind he is let's not all get brother bram's Spirit let's not try to act like the prophet be like the prophet that you don't just want to get somebody else's Spirit you want the word that's what you want to have but there's this human tendency to become what you behold to become what you value to become what you hear and if the pastor's flighty which means easily excitable maybe impressionable maybe unstable frequently changes their mind irresponsible silly just immature has never grown up he said the congregation will be flighty that's right that's right pastors fired up people will be fired up God help us to be ourselves whether we're in the Pulpit or behind the piano or in the seat God help us to be ourselves and be true to what God wants us to do worship Him in spirit and truth and the manner which pleases God relieves our heart and fulfills the burden we have in our lives and let nobody who's stiffy keep you from crying if that's what you want to do and let nobody who's wild and excitable make you feel ashamed because you just bow your head pour your out be heart out before God in silence I'm hitting on this I guess in the sense that brother Bam's identifying that ministers become examples they set the tone and as I've been making this point throughout these traps these attacks these hindrances however you want to look at it the money women popularity different ways that Paul is admonishing Timothy ways that Peter spoke to Elders the way that Christ afforded us an example the things that brother brandham is saying these things that are attacks and traps and hindrances for ministers are the same for all of us 1 Timothy chapter 10 verses 11 to 14 I'll skip just a little bit because I want to hold some for later he says now all these things happen unto them for examples even talking about that in the Exodus and the children of Israel and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come how much more applicable is that for us today whether it be the Old Testament New Testament of the church ages it's for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there's your pride right there hath no temptation taken you but such as common to man let me say that whatever it is money women popularity lust of the flesh lust of the lust of the eyes or the pride of life it's all common to man all mankind humankind brothers or sisters young or old are tempted in some way through these channels we might think oh well only only young men are going to battle with lust and pornography only ministers are going to have to wrestle with popularity do you realize sometimes it's not even the the the preachers that are wrestling with popularity at all they already think they're popular so they're not worried about it but it's people that sit in pews and sit at home and their Housewives who are hungry for acceptance hungry for popularity and they try to find it through some other channel why because they're fighting with popularity women who have a problem with women women who have a problem with money yes and men too not just preachers right good and this is to me it's it's kind of catching that Paul says in verse 14 wherefore my dear dear beloved dearly beloved flee from idolatry flee from it free from the emulation free from patting yourself after somebody else and not after Christ don't let anyone spoil you through vanity and pretense and pride make sure that your Christ is at the heart of it and the center of it in the sermon here his voice in 1958 brother B was talking about a radio program that he had heard on his way to church and he said that in this radio program which was a Church's Ministry they were teaching how that you ought to teach or they're teaching their congregation and showing how you ought to teach teach uh young people or though your congregants how to drink moderately so instead of saying don't drink they saying well you know just kind of be moderate with these things and and brother brandham is kind of making the point like what are you thinking and so I want you to catch what he's trying to say it just to me it it is it's it's it stops me in the day and age that I'm living in as a as a father it stops me and it causes me to think God help me that I don't allow my my children to become intoxicated I I may not have a box of wine in the refrigerator and I may not have uh liquor in a cabinet somewhere vodka in the freezer and different things that I got to worry about them getting into and I'm like oh hey hey Elliot just just a shot okay you know tap the brakes there buddy you still got school this morning I I I it may not be those things but what other things could they be drunk on that's right and he says and that will wreck and ruin and damn any home I I was studying on this and I was working with the title of dam because brother B Tomo what dams your home and dams this and dams that and so it's not it's not a curse word it's a reality it'll wreck ruin and damn any home how could the voice of God speak among a family that's half Sauced up with whiskey and their minds paralyzed with smoking and drinking and all night carousing oh my how could the voice of God speak among a family in that condition and then he begins to talk about something he says men that wait upon God come into His presence wow men that wait upon God come into His presence they told a story how that sister ma saw an Amish woman and sister ma describes her countenance and different things and she makes the comment she was sweet her soul was mellow her eyes were clear brother B said she had been in the presence of God said her senses weren't DED by whiskey and tobacco and all kinds of things of the world now we know that being Amish though we might all have some really good handmade Furniture some good cheese nice summer sausage even though there might be some pluses to living an Amish lifestyle we're we're not going to find this clear-headedness in a mellow Soul just by abstaining but notice he says a a a sense is dulled by intoxications and influences and all kinds of things of the world she was refreshed from the presence of God reading her Bible studying God's word but we modern Americans what we do remember how brother Brandon made the statement and we touched on it here recently how in America you can get away with anything talking about the fanaticism in church and all the much to do about nothing he says and what are we doing he says and the false prophets behind the pulpit say that's all right and that's exactly what you have is when somebody says something's going to happen and it doesn't happen that's a false prophet when they speak in the name of the Lord over you and it doesn't happen that's a false prophet or they've prophesied falsely and if they're a real Prophet they would apologize and repent and get that Spirit cast off of them a real Christian would but false prophets behind the pulpit saying it's right contrary to to the word of God he said I'm kind of in the notion of saying this if I'm wrong God forgive me and I'm persuaded that a lot of them don't know God he says and the congregation will never live any higher than its Pastor you anyone familiar with those statements they're hotly debated Topic in certain circles he says you'll never live any higher than your pastor teaches and you might say I I I just have a hard time accepting that if someone choose chooses to they're only going to live up to a certain level so if you never live any higher than your pastor teaches you better hope he's teaching all of it if you never live any higher than your pastor you want one that's continuing to strive and to reach right God judged my heart I'm not saying this in a in a manner to try to prop myself up if anything just putting it on the record so you guys can hold me accountable he said no wonder the scripture says these Shepherds how they've scattered the flock woe unto them they are the branches that bear not fruit and will be plucked off and burned again it shows how serious it is to be a minister how serious it is to be a man of God to be a pastor and how even within a church when there's different offices and positions that there's a certain testimony in a life that would be required with it because other people are watching in Romans 14: 12 and 13 it so says so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God we will all be held accountable to God not not just ministers not just pastors and even the prophet himself said he would have to answer for thousands of souls on that day we must give an account of ourselves to God let us not therefore judge one another anymore right but judge this rather think of how quickly we judge somebody else and just imagine this that he says let's not judge anybody anymore and we're all thinking okay I'm I'm real judgy he says but judge this that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way could we be judging people that fell and they tripped over our block on on could we be judging other people's flightiness could we be judging other people's unbelief other people's problems and we're the one that caused the occasion for them to fall because he says let us all give account of ourselves and let's not just judge everybody anymore but judge this am I being the right kind of example that even when I mistake make a mistake or fall I can repent I can get back up I can humble myself and make it right Paul told Timothy let no man despise thy youth brother brandom says in the token sermon age means not a thing let no man despise your youth but be an example he says age means not a thing you've done past from age you're in eternity cuz you are in him he is eternal Don't Mean a Thing whether you're young old middle AG or whatever you are pretty ugly short fat just find yourself in the word tonight it don't matter a thing I can find that I'm pretty ugly pretty short pretty fat it doesn't matter a thing you don't go around in all these other things you've done p from that you're dead now remember this central theme to House of God your life is hid in God through Christ you're sealed in there by the holy ghost walking in Christ the only object you see is Christ no more idolatry from then on comes the word and the word only not patting ourselves after church ages not patting ourselves after denominations not even patting ourselves after church age Messengers you've been introduced to your bridegroom we follow one head that's Christ it's the only object you see that's all that's only you walk but oh my no wonder we used to sing that little song fill my way every day with love as I walk with the Heavenly Dove he says let me go all the while with a song and a smile and listen to what he says let me live the example of what Christ said a man should be let me be a brother to a brother a brother to a sister let me be a minister to the ministers let me be an example of examples Amen Let me show to the world that this word is Christ yes sir you want marching orders you want to know what you should be doing every day live an example of what Christ said a Believer ought to be if you're a man be a man what that Christ said you should be if you're a daughter of God be a daughter of God that Christ said you should be let me be a brother to a brother a brother to a sister let me be a minister to ministers let me be an example of examples the only way I can do it is to come into him because I can't do it myself you can't do it take heed him who thinks he stand lest he fall but let the word and you become one then it lives itself out your walk a walking Epistle of Jesus Christ when he's got complete control control of you to make every word Brothers if you could come to your instruments we'll just close here in just a moment let's read again 1 Corinthians chap 10: 11 to 14 all these things happened in the Old Testament to the children of Israel as examples written of and recorded for our instruction and our admonition wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there hath no temptation taken you but such as common to man less of the eyes less of the flesh the pride of life young old brother bam said middle-aged pretty ugly short fat everyone battles with the pride of life you might think sometimes man they're just so short fat and ugly how could they have any pride in their in in life and any Pride we all battle it we all go through it we all money women populari somehow some way in some form every human being is going to be tempted with these things going to be hindered by them in their wrong application the perversion of these things can become a Vias can become an addiction become a real struggle for anybody that's why when John is writing he says I ride under you little children because you're sins are forgiven and that's where the little children are most grounded need to be rooted in that they they've been forgiven that the blood of Jesus Christ is is an atonement for them and then young men because you've overcome the wicked one and the Holy Ghost is living inside you the word of God inv by you and then you fathers why because you've continued from the beginning why because these things hit you at every stage of life there's little children becoming subject to tormenting Spirits there there there there's wrestling with lust and all sorts of evil things that will grip people long before they're teenagers why because there's no temptation that takes a man but such as common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear it the woman in the beginning was given sufficient resources to escape the Temptation God had already said beforehand this is what will happen and this is what you're to do the Commission in the prohibition she could have stayed with it but she didn't Christ in the wilderness is tempted in the same way and what does he say it is written it is written it is written and he has made for us in light of money women and popularity the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life as I said on Sunday I believe that God wants by the word of God to deliver some of us from things that have either been in family history whether it be sick sickness whether it be family history and and emotional mental mental illness or whether it be things of vices and addictions chemical or lust or otherwise I believe that God wants us to know that the power of the word is greater than money women and popularity and that Satan can be exposed by the word of God to bring great Deliverance to his people and there's ways that certain thing certain of these things have been weaponized to where certain offenses are very that that one would fall in an offense and this one has sinned and they've made a tremendous mistake they've fallen in money but then the devil tries to turn around and weaponize it toward somebody else is now the victim and it spirals out of control and no one ever gets out of it CU he's weaponized the whole thing through support groups and opinions online and other people have experienced the same thing it places stigma on the offender it it changes the word of God and it makes things just this Labyrinth that one could never escape from but God will with the Temptation there's no temptation that has taken a man but such as every man has faced it but God is faithful that he will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able that means with every Temptation he will with the Temptation with every Temptation there is a way to escape amen yeah talked about the big three and we question it is it really the big three when there's the greatest one who is the way the truth the life amen who has overcome these things will make a way of Escape that you may be able to Bear it wherefore my beloved Brethren flee from idolatry flee from it why by his help under the shadow of his wings for as Hebrews says for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin he was tempted with the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life he was tempted with money women and popularity constantly tempted with these things don't you see how often they money became an issue how often he was asked these different questions how he was trying to cast with this lot and cast with that lot crowds hovering around him the crowd gets thinner he was tempted with money he was tempted Ed with women he was tempted with popularity but was without [Music] sin in all points tempted like as we are no temptation but such his common Dem man John says for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world if you overcome the world you can overcome all that is in the world the big three lust of the flesh lust of the eyes the pride of life money women popularity you name it I don't believe there's anything that we should just say this is just the way it is and the way it's going to be that's right the same God that's that we believe for physical healing is the same one for Spiritual healing and the Very one that has power to change this body in a moment in twinkling eye can change anything in your life anything in your life in a moment and twinkling of an eye whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God he that believeth he has come in the flesh he that believeth Jesus Christ the son of God who came into the world and and he has overcome he was tempted in the same way that I might be tempted and he's one that I can go to who can be touched by the filling of our infirmities there's a lot of people that can't understand temptation of certain things so well I've never been tempted to jump out of an airplane with a parachute and and I've never been tempted to do this and I've never been tempted to do that and there's a lot of people that can't relate to certain Temptations there's some things that a woman struggles with and wrestles with and can't quite get over with complexes and fears and men look at them like come on what's the problem suck it up and then the vice versa there's things that women can't understand that a man goes through great test and temptations and battles and failures but I don't want anyone rather what side you are on this to think that's just the way that it has to be but God Amen is merciful God is faithful and we can by the grace of God overcome we can just as Paul admonished Timothy to be nourished up in the words of faith and of good Doctrine we too can do the same we don't have to be flighty we can be mature we can grow we can overcome so I hope we put some things out there for you to consider tonight Lord will maybe Sunday morning we'll touch on money women and popularity just to see just to get real with some of these things the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life don't stay home come we want to say goodbye to the Cleveland Sunday morning so we need everyone we need everyone here God bless you let's stand
