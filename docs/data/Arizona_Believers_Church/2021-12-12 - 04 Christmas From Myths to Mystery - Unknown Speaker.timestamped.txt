[0:00] luke chapter one i'm gonna start with
[0:02] verse five luke chapter one verse five
[0:06] and read to verse 17.
[0:12] luke chapter one starting with verse
[0:14] five
[0:15] there was in the days of herod the king
[0:16] of judea a certain priest
[0:19] named zacharias of the course of abeah
[0:22] and notice this telling the story of
[0:24] jesus and it starts with zacharias a
[0:28] priest and his wife was of the daughters
[0:30] of aaron and her name was elizabeth and
[0:32] they were both right just before god
[0:34] walking in all the commandments and
[0:36] ordinance of the lord blameless they had
[0:38] no child because that elizabeth was
[0:40] barren and they both were now well
[0:42] stricken in years
[0:43] it came to pass that while he executed
[0:46] the priest's office before god in the
[0:48] order of his course according to the
[0:50] custom of the priest's office his lot
[0:53] was to burn incense when he went into
[0:55] the temple of the lord and the whole
[0:57] multitude of the people were praying
[0:59] without a time at without at the time of
[1:01] incense and there appeared unto him an
[1:04] angel of the lord standing on the right
[1:06] side of the altar of incense and when
[1:08] zacharias saw him he was troubled and
[1:10] fear fell upon him but the angel said
[1:13] unto him fear not zacharias for thy
[1:15] prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth
[1:17] shall bear thee a son and thou shalt
[1:19] call his name john thou shall have joy
[1:21] and gladness and many shall rejoice at
[1:24] his birth
[1:25] for he shall be great in the sight of
[1:27] the lord and shall drink neither wine
[1:29] nor strong drink and he shall be filled
[1:31] the holy ghost even from his mother's
[1:33] womb and many of the children of israel
[1:35] shall he turn into the to the lord their
[1:37] god and he shall go before him in the
[1:40] spirit and power of elias to turn the
[1:42] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:44] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[1:46] just to make ready a people prepared for
[1:48] the lord
[1:49] zacharias said unto the angel whereby
[1:51] shall i know this for i am all an old
[1:54] man and my wife real stricken in years
[1:57] and he's continued to read he's stricken
[1:59] uh
[2:00] dumb because of his disbelief
[2:02] let's just pray for a moment here
[2:04] gracious heavenly father we appreciate
[2:06] the time that we have today together as
[2:08] family
[2:09] as your children gathered around
[2:11] a table as it were to feast upon the
[2:14] things
[2:15] that are prepared for us in the word
[2:16] that have been preserved for us things
[2:18] in the bible things from the message of
[2:19] the hour
[2:20] and lord just asking that you come to
[2:23] settle our nerves lord and just comfort
[2:25] our hearts and be with us as we approach
[2:27] this particular subject
[2:29] myself lord just feeling
[2:31] the weight of certain things and just
[2:33] desiring to
[2:35] just be
[2:36] be appropriate lord and be sensitive and
[2:38] i just pray that you'd come in a special
[2:40] way this morning take the things which
[2:41] we have read and bless them in the name
[2:43] of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
[2:46] you can be seated
[2:48] this is part four of our christmas
[2:50] series that we begin to minister on
[2:53] and
[2:54] i will warn you um that i think i've
[2:57] been doing a lot maybe to whet the
[2:59] appetite for mysteries
[3:01] and um i think sometimes we use that
[3:03] phrase we expect maybe to hear something
[3:04] we haven't heard before
[3:06] but i believe the message was perfect
[3:08] it's complete
[3:09] delivered to us those things that are
[3:10] relevant for us and so in the subject of
[3:13] a mystery
[3:14] your mind might be thinking oh we're
[3:16] gonna something's gonna be some
[3:17] territory is going to be explored that
[3:18] we've never heard of before and if
[3:20] that's what you're expecting then well
[3:22] maybe you'll get what you expect but
[3:24] then also i'd say you might be
[3:25] disappointed because i'm not going to be
[3:26] bringing anything new but i want to
[3:28] start transitioning
[3:30] as we've been preaching on myths i want
[3:32] to transition from myths to mystery so
[3:34] we're still speaking on the subject of
[3:35] christmas and go from myths to mystery i
[3:38] just want to point out a couple things
[3:40] here at the outset in our text how that
[3:42] in luke wanting to tell a very complete
[3:45] story and record of christ and his
[3:47] ministry in his life
[3:49] and he's wanting he could have began as
[3:51] other writers do with the birth of
[3:53] christ but he starts with the birth of
[3:55] john and it's with the birth of john
[3:57] that we begin to read things
[3:59] relating to joy and gladness and
[4:02] rejoicing and it says thou shalt have
[4:04] joy and gladness and many shall rejoice
[4:06] at the birth of john and so this is how
[4:09] he chooses luke is going to choose to
[4:12] introduce the messiah and he
[4:14] appropriately very appropriately begins
[4:16] with introducing the forerunner and i
[4:18] think that's just something i want you
[4:20] to
[4:21] leave with you at the outset and i want
[4:22] to come back to these verses
[4:24] uh later on this morning
[4:26] so i want to
[4:29] just recap some things that we've talked
[4:30] about in christmas myths i'm not going
[4:32] to go back through the
[4:33] first few parts but what we've been
[4:35] looking at is identifying as brother
[4:37] branham put it the real fundamentals of
[4:39] christmas
[4:40] and in looking at the real fundamentals
[4:42] of christmas what you're doing is you're
[4:44] going to separate fact from fiction
[4:46] you're going to find out what is uh what
[4:47] is kind of just the mythology that's
[4:49] developed and what's what's the lore the
[4:51] folklore the legends related to the
[4:53] birth of christ or the season that he
[4:55] was born in and identify the facts if we
[4:59] can there's some situations that we'll
[5:01] find this morning that i uh or will make
[5:03] reference to this morning that you can
[5:04] say well i want to find out exactly when
[5:06] or i want to know this i want to know
[5:08] that and there's a lot of things that
[5:09] god has just hid that we may never know
[5:11] and and even in eternity there's things
[5:13] that maybe mean a lot to us right now
[5:15] but in eternity those completely fade
[5:17] away and you're like man what were those
[5:19] questions i was wanting to ask god
[5:20] doesn't matter anymore and so that's one
[5:22] of the things that we can begin to look
[5:24] at when we talk about
[5:25] myths and now i want to move moving from
[5:28] myths to mystery it's really getting
[5:30] into what's been covered up what's been
[5:31] hit what's been convoluted
[5:34] and on wednesday night i'm so happy to
[5:36] see all of you who are there wednesday
[5:37] night back tonight
[5:39] or today and i'm not inviting you to
[5:41] service this evening but uh back today
[5:44] because we went in a very exhaustive
[5:47] uh tedious maybe maybe a better word in
[5:50] looking at the mythology related to
[5:52] santa claus as one of the myths related
[5:54] to christmas one of the most prominent
[5:55] symbols related to the modern day
[5:57] celebration of christmas uh but we
[5:59] looked at the origins of santa claus and
[6:01] we realized that there's a lot a blend
[6:03] of a lot of different traditions a
[6:05] blending of a lot of different folklore
[6:07] to where when you want to get and find
[6:08] out who is santa claus today it's
[6:10] convoluted because so many things have
[6:12] been added in and you have a real person
[6:15] saint nicholas and then you have another
[6:16] mythological character here and you have
[6:18] one from german tradition you have one
[6:20] from english tradition you have one from
[6:22] nordic tradition and you have different
[6:23] greek mythologies and everything kind of
[6:25] gets bundled up and it's personified in
[6:27] one person we know today is jolly saint
[6:30] nick or santa claus and we recognize
[6:32] there's a lot of mythology a lot of
[6:34] stories a lot of origin stories a lot of
[6:36] different myths related to even that
[6:39] element of our of christmas celebrations
[6:42] today
[6:43] and
[6:44] we spoke about even the mythology and
[6:47] the origins of the christmas tree
[6:50] and
[6:51] uh we realize there's a lot of different
[6:52] narratives as it relates to the
[6:53] christmas tree there's some that uh
[6:56] posit that it's strictly a pagan symbol
[6:58] there's others that say well it really
[7:00] began with very devout german christians
[7:03] in western germany
[7:04] at the time of wanting to honor christ's
[7:06] birth brought in the christmas tree we
[7:08] even realized we could blame martin
[7:10] luther for um kris kringle and the
[7:13] christ child and blame him for the
[7:14] tradition of opening gifts on a
[7:17] christmas morning in front of a tree and
[7:18] he's the one that added light to the
[7:20] tree
[7:21] so if you want to hang somebody for
[7:22] christmas maybe martin luther would be a
[7:24] good place to start but
[7:26] we realize there's a lot of even
[7:27] religious significance attached to the
[7:29] christmas tree but then on the other
[7:30] hand there's still a lot of
[7:33] non-religious symbolism and even
[7:34] cultural symbolism related to it and i
[7:37] thought it was very interesting i'm just
[7:38] sharing this with you
[7:40] um today because i found it very
[7:42] interesting and very intriguing of just
[7:44] how polarizing a symbol can be
[7:46] how many heard about the fox news tree
[7:49] getting burned down
[7:50] they've already caught the suspect so
[7:52] you don't have to be worried about
[7:53] having too much knowledge
[7:55] but the fox news tree was burned down
[7:57] and then
[7:58] i i saw an article on it and this was a
[8:01] i had a couple statements
[8:02] uh that i wanted to point out and this
[8:04] is a
[8:06] i don't know what kind of personality
[8:08] they are with fox news but i believe
[8:10] it's a woman
[8:11] aired heart she said it's a tree that
[8:13] unites us
[8:14] it brings us together it's about the
[8:16] christmas spirit it's about the holiday
[8:18] season it's about jesus
[8:21] this is what fox news believes the tree
[8:23] this is what the tree represents to fox
[8:26] news and this is what they are
[8:27] suggesting it means to all of us is that
[8:30] the tree is about jesus so do you
[8:32] recognize just how much starts getting
[8:35] poured into the tree because even when
[8:37] you go back and you look at different
[8:39] things you'll find well there really
[8:40] wasn't that much significance placed on
[8:42] it it was just a symbol maybe it was
[8:44] used in paradise plays where they're
[8:46] using it as an allegory of the tree in
[8:48] the garden of eden or even the garden of
[8:50] eden itself and things kind of evolve
[8:52] around
[8:53] around it
[8:54] and um
[8:56] and here it's like this really overt
[8:58] very direct the tree is about jesus
[9:02] and this is why there was such umbrage
[9:04] when it was burnt down this was uh oh my
[9:06] goodness this is an affront this is an
[9:08] attack and it was brother tuckel carlson
[9:11] uh who tweeted this and i don't follow
[9:13] him so um i i had to get this through
[9:16] different sources
[9:17] uh he didn't dm me with this
[9:20] but tucker carlson said this a christmas
[9:23] tree is a symbol and i could go with
[9:25] that it's a it is symbolic of a specific
[9:28] culture this builds it's a symbol of a
[9:31] much-loved tradition that's hundreds of
[9:33] years old above all it's a symbol of a
[9:36] religion the world's largest and he's
[9:39] speaking about christianity because he
[9:40] says torching christmas trees is an
[9:42] attack on christianity
[9:45] now i don't know if we ever would have
[9:46] felt that way before fox news put this
[9:48] out there but i imagine there's millions
[9:51] of people today that now view the
[9:52] christmas tree as jesus
[9:55] and that if you burn down a christmas
[9:57] tree it's an attack on christianity
[10:00] itself and i found that very striking
[10:04] very even again it's kind of the
[10:06] rhetoric that polarizes people because
[10:08] you may have some people are kind of
[10:09] like ah well i have a tree because it
[10:10] looks good and all of a sudden they're
[10:12] being told that you have a very overt
[10:14] symbol of christianity in your living
[10:16] room and like well no it doesn't mean
[10:18] that oh yeah oh yeah you're just a
[10:20] closet christian because if jesus christ
[10:22] is sitting all tinseled up in your
[10:25] living room
[10:26] and that's what they've made it and what
[10:28] you once kind of noticed kind of the
[10:29] sensationalism resulting around it and i
[10:32] felt just so extreme and really
[10:35] imbalanced in something that just pushes
[10:37] the needle a little bit further on what
[10:39] the christmas tree is to where now it's
[10:41] a symbol of christ and a symbol of the
[10:44] world's largest religion christianity
[10:47] and by burning a tree
[10:49] in new york i believe it was in new york
[10:51] this was an attack on christianity
[10:54] i guess they're unable to view it as
[10:55] maybe someone not liking fox news they
[10:58] had to attribute this animus to
[11:00] christ himself and i think that's kind
[11:02] of maybe just a common trope that a lot
[11:04] of people like to drag out there um
[11:06] instead of recognizing themselves as
[11:08] being the one that needs to shape up and
[11:09] change their attitude they just say
[11:11] that's just the devil persecuting me
[11:13] because i'm a christian
[11:16] and so i i just mentioned that just to
[11:18] kind of
[11:19] as a kind of like a exercise kind of
[11:21] like a pregame a little bit for where
[11:23] for more today
[11:24] but the true origin story this is kind
[11:26] of just backtracking a little bit on
[11:28] some of the things we've mentioned
[11:29] already the true origin story of
[11:31] christmas celebrations has really been
[11:33] lost largely lost to myths that if you
[11:36] asked anyone where does christmas come
[11:37] from um and you hear the different
[11:39] stories that might be shared you'll find
[11:41] that it combines this element adds this
[11:43] element in and there's a lot of things
[11:44] that kind of come together to where to
[11:46] know the real origin of the celebration
[11:48] of christmas there's so much that's
[11:50] added into it it's kind of hard to
[11:52] distill it down and figure out when did
[11:53] it start and who started it and what was
[11:55] it all about
[11:56] because any
[11:59] any christian connection if there was
[12:01] some christian connection to it if we
[12:03] were able to go back and say oh aha look
[12:05] this church in rural england was
[12:07] celebrating christmas or oh look these
[12:09] germans in the 400s were celebrating
[12:11] christmas and they're devout christians
[12:13] anything that might have been connected
[12:15] with christians in a christian
[12:16] expression has been blended and mixed
[12:18] with culture
[12:20] culture tradition it's been blended in
[12:21] with other religions to where these
[12:23] things get so blended in it's not really
[12:26] that clear what it represents and that's
[12:28] why it's very bold on tucker's part to
[12:30] say this is a symbol of jesus christ in
[12:33] christianity itself because everything
[12:35] just gets muddied over
[12:37] it it's not something that christians
[12:38] alone can truly claim
[12:40] because modern christmas as we celebrate
[12:42] it today the the the things that we
[12:45] identify as being very prominent during
[12:47] this time of year is a product of
[12:49] 1800 years of evolution
[12:51] it's not just something that has always
[12:53] been it's been evolving and joining
[12:55] together and kind of fusing together
[12:57] different things over 1800 years
[13:00] and
[13:01] i think this is something that's obvious
[13:02] but i want to state it
[13:04] the
[13:05] present-day
[13:06] christmas traditions the ones that we
[13:08] even would participate in ourselves even
[13:10] as believers and christians they in
[13:12] themselves are not traditions that honor
[13:14] christ
[13:16] they are just traditions related to a
[13:17] holiday uh the traditions that we do
[13:20] whether it be exchanging gifts or
[13:21] putting up lights or baking christmas
[13:23] cookies or having a christmas tree
[13:25] all these different things that we've
[13:27] seen that we call festive and part of
[13:29] the season are not derived from the
[13:32] bible
[13:33] they're not derived and centered on the
[13:34] word of god we do not find in third
[13:36] corinthians paul expressing to the
[13:38] corinthian church how they ought to
[13:40] celebrate christmas
[13:42] and complimenting the church at ephesus
[13:44] on how well they celebrate christmas and
[13:46] how they had the best uh cookie exchange
[13:49] uh ever and that the trees were always
[13:51] trimmed just right
[13:52] and um and they they're we don't have
[13:55] these kind of instructions in the word
[13:56] of god so
[13:58] the present day christmas traditions
[14:00] that we participate in
[14:02] we're not deriving them from the word of
[14:05] god
[14:06] but what christmas is today and this is
[14:08] what i want to express is the true
[14:09] danger of christmas christmas today is
[14:12] very hedonistic
[14:14] self-indulgent all about self-pleasure
[14:16] and one thing that we are warned of over
[14:18] and over again in the message of the
[14:19] hour is christmas today has become
[14:21] driven by commercialism
[14:24] christmas today brother brandon even
[14:26] makes reference to i think a shop owner
[14:27] talking about how they made all their
[14:29] money on christmas time it's about
[14:31] capitalism it's about commerce it's
[14:32] about economy and that's really what
[14:34] drives christmas like a lot of other
[14:37] days that we celebrate in north america
[14:40] and around the world they are the
[14:41] fiction of hallmark they're the fiction
[14:44] of a commercial entity in order to drive
[14:47] commerce and that's the real danger of
[14:49] the christmas season isn't its origins
[14:51] or even its mythology but what it's
[14:53] become
[14:54] and that's this hedonistic festival
[14:56] that's commercially driven
[14:58] i want to take some time
[15:00] this morning
[15:02] kind of clarifying some things that we
[15:04] made reference to wednesday night on
[15:06] christmas being a secular celebration i
[15:09] just want to view it from a standpoint
[15:10] for a moment that and kind of looking at
[15:12] christmas as a secular holiday
[15:15] and because i want to i want to make
[15:16] this very very clear
[15:18] um and again i don't know if anybody's
[15:20] kind of been anticipating where i'm
[15:21] going with this
[15:23] or if i've
[15:24] emphasized certain things to a certain
[15:26] degree where i've come off as being
[15:28] defensive and i want to make it clear
[15:29] this series is not a defense of
[15:31] christmas
[15:33] i don't know that it needs a defensive
[15:35] modern day christmas celebrations or
[15:37] some defense of christmas and coming to
[15:40] its defense
[15:41] i'm not going to retweet a tucker
[15:43] carlson as this christmas tree been a
[15:46] symbol of christianity in this holiday
[15:48] this this time of year it's about the
[15:50] christmas spirit it's about the holiday
[15:52] season
[15:53] uh that's not what my these series of
[15:55] sermons is about it's not a call it's
[15:57] not even a call or a mandate to
[15:59] celebrate christmas and to make oh well
[16:01] then we ought to be celebrating
[16:02] christmas and the shackles are off and
[16:04] here's our opportunity i'm not doing any
[16:06] of those things
[16:07] but uh so i want you to recognize really
[16:10] what i'd want to do is kind of place
[16:11] christmas more in this
[16:13] uh
[16:13] more benign but potentially
[16:16] caustic place to where maybe in itself i
[16:19] mean there's really nothing wrong with
[16:20] it but you can make it wrong real quick
[16:23] but the ascendancy the the rise of myths
[16:26] really underscore just how secular
[16:28] christmas has become
[16:29] as the myths have gotten more and more
[16:31] intertangled into these things christmas
[16:33] has become more secular and by secular
[16:37] it means living in the world kind of the
[16:39] original use of the word secular was
[16:41] living in the world or not belonging to
[16:43] a religious order so the word in its
[16:45] etymology it means of the world it just
[16:47] means of man
[16:49] and so something was secular saying well
[16:50] that's just secular like going going out
[16:53] and eating lunch is secular
[16:55] right it's not a religious activity and
[16:58] and it's not a we're not going out to
[16:59] lunch today and picking a place because
[17:01] the bible determines where we ought to
[17:04] eat today and the message of the hour
[17:05] says you ought not to do this so you
[17:07] can't go eat pizza you can't go eat
[17:09] indian food and so we're by eating we're
[17:11] doing something that's honoring the lord
[17:13] so that would be a secular activity that
[17:15] makes sense so if it's secular it's just
[17:17] kind of of the world it's uh it's not
[17:19] belonging to religious practice or or
[17:22] it's one if one was secular they
[17:24] wouldn't even be belong to a particular
[17:25] religion
[17:27] and so the word secular is used to
[17:29] define attitudes or activities or eat
[17:31] anything that has no religious or
[17:33] spiritual basis so it's an activity that
[17:36] doesn't have a religious basis it's
[17:37] something that doesn't have a spiritual
[17:39] basis
[17:40] now i'm not i'm not creating a category
[17:43] to
[17:44] make it seem that
[17:46] well some things don't have any any
[17:48] influence and some things in themselves
[17:50] are or there's no spirituality behind
[17:53] her there's no spirit or force behind it
[17:55] just using the word secular it's an
[17:56] activity that has no religious basis
[17:58] it's a it's something or an attitude
[18:01] that doesn't have a religious or
[18:03] spiritual basis you don't like something
[18:05] maybe not for religious reasons maybe
[18:07] not for spiritual reason that's just
[18:08] secular
[18:09] now in 2019 in a gallup poll from 2019
[18:14] it said that 93
[18:17] of americans it determined that 93 of
[18:19] americans would celebrate christmas that
[18:21] year so in december of 2019 pre pandemic
[18:24] it said 93 of all americans would
[18:26] celebrate christmas and the next year it
[18:29] said only four it determined they had a
[18:31] poll that showed that less than 50
[18:33] percent i believe it was 47 percent of
[18:35] americans actually belonged to church
[18:37] first time they had dipped below half
[18:40] a very very striking figure see 93 of
[18:42] americans are celebrating christmas but
[18:44] less than half actually go to church
[18:48] so think about the these statistics and
[18:50] when they polled them of these 93 of
[18:52] americans which celebrate christmas 35
[18:55] only 35 said they were it was a strongly
[18:58] religious celebration 26 percent said
[19:01] not too religious
[19:03] so this is kind of the attitudes ah it's
[19:05] not too religious 36 percent says it was
[19:07] strongly religious and they found that
[19:09] it was the attitude towards christmas
[19:11] was becoming more and more secular as a
[19:13] matter of fact what was increasing was
[19:15] that how the non-religious were
[19:17] participating more and more in christmas
[19:19] celebrations let's say maybe at one time
[19:22] christmas was something that was
[19:23] attributed to the birth of jesus christ
[19:26] but as more and more things get added to
[19:28] it it becomes less about the birth of
[19:30] christ and more about you know
[19:33] candy canes and snow and cakes and pies
[19:36] and cookies and christmas movies and
[19:39] christmas musics and gift swapping and
[19:41] trees and lights and a lot of things
[19:42] that kind of really grab our attention
[19:45] and as those begin to have the
[19:46] preeminence more non-religious people
[19:48] begin to celebrate it because they
[19:50] didn't feel as if they were celebrating
[19:53] a christian
[19:54] a a christian
[19:56] a festival or something related to
[19:58] christianity
[19:59] and even
[20:00] even when they studied the jews and they
[20:02] asked these questions of the jews and
[20:04] practicing jews they'd find that where
[20:06] they didn't believe that jesus in the
[20:07] birth of jesus christ and they had their
[20:10] celebration of hanukkah they still
[20:12] incorporated a lot of different other
[20:13] elements of the christmas celebration
[20:16] because it was part of the season it was
[20:17] festive and they're seeing a rise of
[20:19] non-religious people secular people
[20:21] celebrating the holiday so this is the
[20:25] conclusion
[20:27] a statement that was made in the poll
[20:28] christmas is growing more secular and
[20:30] has been doing so for decades
[20:32] but anxiety among religious
[20:34] conservatives on this issue like
[20:35] countless others this year has magnified
[20:38] many times over by the force multiplier
[20:41] of the trump campaign
[20:43] and so this was related to the the poll
[20:46] and the campaign of trump and how that
[20:48] christmas was growing is growing more
[20:51] secular but there's a group of people
[20:53] that continue to have increased anxiety
[20:57] over the subject of christmas and it's
[20:59] political forces that begin to drive
[21:01] this narrative and make people more and
[21:03] more sensitive to this subject to
[21:06] christmas and try to make it more and
[21:07] more religious where really the the
[21:10] world is
[21:11] in society at large is making it more
[21:13] and more secular
[21:15] now i i used that statement to
[21:17] underscore this
[21:19] there are very strong currents different
[21:21] currents trying to pull us in opposite
[21:23] directions
[21:24] you could just see from the tweets that
[21:26] we read earlier and the statements
[21:28] earlier and even this conclusion of the
[21:30] gallup poll and how they recognize them
[21:32] among certain uh political segment of
[21:35] those polled that they were much more
[21:37] adamant and strong about christmas and
[21:39] its origins and what it meant and they
[21:41] could see that there was something that
[21:43] was stoking those feelings and causing
[21:45] people to be a little bit more uh and
[21:48] anxious about the time and so there's
[21:50] these forces that are driving things as
[21:52] we could see by the response of fox news
[21:55] and you can see how things are becoming
[21:56] more and more secular but then there's
[21:57] this
[21:58] uh movement to try to make them more and
[22:00] more and more religious than even what
[22:02] was intended so these these strong
[22:04] currents cause wanting to make you
[22:06] either embrace it and defend it or
[22:08] reject it
[22:10] uh to reject its meaning or reject any
[22:12] symbolism related to it i'd say if
[22:14] anything is trying to knock you off
[22:15] balance
[22:17] i read a statement in one book where it
[22:18] said there's two christmases
[22:20] one secular and the other one's sacred
[22:24] and it's very true how this dichotomy
[22:26] begins to take shape where there's uh
[22:28] two christmases there's one that's a
[22:29] secular christmas and there is a there's
[22:32] a sacred christmas or religious
[22:34] christmas or spiritualized uh christmas
[22:37] and the two have been warring against
[22:39] each other
[22:40] for 1800 years
[22:42] and and i think the clarifying statement
[22:44] was made one time it's not a war on
[22:46] christmas a war over christmas
[22:48] because one side wants to make it this
[22:50] and another side wants to make it that
[22:51] and so these things kind of collide and
[22:53] this is kind of the environment we're in
[22:54] now it's becoming more and more secular
[22:56] and i would argue that the holiday that
[22:58] we celebrate now is secular it doesn't
[23:00] really have religious basis it's really
[23:02] not spiritual but people are trying to
[23:03] come behind it and add spiritual
[23:05] significance to certain things and kind
[23:07] of push us one way or push you the other
[23:10] way
[23:11] and that's kind of the climate that i
[23:13] think we should identify the secularism
[23:15] of it and not so much maybe this uh
[23:18] demonic
[23:20] uh you know that the tree is a symbol of
[23:22] satan
[23:23] i don't think it's a symbol of christ
[23:25] either
[23:26] now i want to i want to look at a myth
[23:28] because i think it's a perfect
[23:30] opportunity to kind of segue into
[23:33] um
[23:34] the way brother branham begins to
[23:35] identify the origins
[23:37] and the kind of the color of the
[23:39] christmas celebrations and it's the
[23:41] happy holiday myth
[23:43] and how many of uh
[23:45] aware of a controversy related to happy
[23:48] holidays
[23:49] right anybody heard of it before
[23:51] and so it's kind of the controversy of
[23:53] what canceling christmas there's a war
[23:55] on christmas they're canceling christmas
[23:57] because people begin to use wanted to
[23:58] use the phrase or we're using the phrase
[24:01] holiday happy holidays instead of merry
[24:04] christmas
[24:05] and so there's
[24:06] a narrative that wants to take the
[24:09] phrase happy holidays and turn it into a
[24:11] liberal creation that was intended to
[24:13] take christ out of christmas
[24:16] and so is that not kind of there the
[24:18] story that we heard and there was even
[24:20] the texas women's university actually
[24:22] banned the use of happy holidays because
[24:25] it was wasn't inclusive enough
[24:27] so you can see there's kind of this
[24:28] trend no merry christmas happy holidays
[24:30] no that's still not good let's just go
[24:32] to uh good xmas i don't know what they
[24:35] would go for but this phrase happy
[24:37] holidays is kind of seen as this liberal
[24:39] idea to take christ out of christmas but
[24:42] the phrase has been in wide use since
[24:45] the 1800s
[24:46] here's a couple examples one from 1863
[24:49] and another one from 1890 and you
[24:51] probably can't read them
[24:53] but since i have the benefit of being on
[24:54] the front row or the frontis row
[24:56] this one on the left i think this one
[24:57] was from the
[24:59] 1863 the philadelphia inquirer maybe it
[25:01] says happy holidays are coming christmas
[25:03] presents presents for old and young
[25:06] and then um on the other side it's happy
[25:08] holidays this one i think was from 1890
[25:10] and these are there's multiple instances
[25:12] of the use of the phrase happy holidays
[25:14] even in the 1800s so it's not really a
[25:17] recent invention
[25:19] as a matter of fact we all know what
[25:20] holiday comes from right
[25:23] raise your hand if you know what holiday
[25:24] comes from the word holiday is an old
[25:27] english holy day
[25:30] holy moly that's what it means
[25:33] holy day that's exactly what it means so
[25:35] the word itself to say happy holidays is
[25:38] saying good holy day have a good holy
[25:41] day wonderful holy day and it means a
[25:43] consecrated day or religious anniversary
[25:47] and so there's a to say a holy how many
[25:50] of in canada they go on holidays right
[25:52] they don't go on vacation they go on
[25:53] holidays and it's this this uh its
[25:56] origin is from this phrase
[25:57] holy day these days that were set aside
[25:59] for as consecration days when people
[26:02] wouldn't work days of religious
[26:03] ceremonies a days that were consecrated
[26:05] certain religious anniversaries and so
[26:07] there was different holidays during the
[26:09] year we know that we have different
[26:11] holidays of easter and thanksgiving we
[26:13] calm holidays but these are originally
[26:15] the term is holy days and it's kind of
[26:17] taken from the old english
[26:19] a holiday and that's kind of where it
[26:20] comes from holy day is what it refers to
[26:24] now when the term holidays is used
[26:26] during this season historically it was
[26:28] used to refer to this these four weeks
[26:30] or four sunday cycle
[26:32] which would begin at a point so that the
[26:34] ends on christmas eve and sometimes they
[26:37] would extend it out to january 6th for
[26:38] the epiphany but that's what the
[26:41] holidays referred to originally is a
[26:43] four week period four sundays
[26:45] of this season leading up to christmas
[26:48] how many have heard of the advent
[26:51] and this is something that's very
[26:52] prominent i think it's more in catholic
[26:54] tradition and some of the protestant
[26:55] denominations uh a lot of different
[26:57] denominations celebrated and different
[26:59] sects but the advent
[27:00] is a season of the church year that
[27:03] celebrates the birth of christ but then
[27:05] also prepares for his return this is
[27:08] what the advent is and they with respect
[27:10] to that they have advent trees they have
[27:12] advent calendars they have different
[27:13] things to represent
[27:15] uh the advent and it's this four sunday
[27:18] cycle the advent the holy days the
[27:19] holidays it's there in that time where
[27:22] they're celebrating and look and uh and
[27:25] honoring the birth of christ as they
[27:26] lead up to the day that they believed he
[27:28] was born but then it's a time of
[27:29] preparation of his return because they
[27:32] make this symbol symbolic connection
[27:34] between his first coming and the second
[27:36] coming and so it's during this season if
[27:38] you just think about it there's four
[27:40] weeks
[27:41] of celebrating this these holidays and
[27:44] this holiday time it's during the season
[27:46] that a greeting of happy holidays would
[27:48] be religiously appropriate
[27:50] right the advent we have many many days
[27:53] and so it's it's it you come to this
[27:55] time as happy holidays happy holidays
[27:57] and so it would seem and i know this may
[27:59] be a little bit of a stretch
[28:00] uh in terms of trying to drill down and
[28:02] make this um
[28:05] an absolute but
[28:07] you don't go around wishing people happy
[28:09] birthday
[28:11] 25 days before their birthday well some
[28:13] of us do but we say happy birth month or
[28:16] birth week
[28:17] uh we could say curse days maybe happy
[28:20] curse days coming up leading up
[28:21] expecting uh your birthday coming
[28:24] there's uh it's appropriate
[28:26] during this time following thanksgiving
[28:28] leading up that you say happy happy
[28:31] holidays because many different things
[28:32] and significance uh attached to the
[28:35] advent and these different church
[28:36] celebrations and things that this would
[28:38] be a common commemoration of birth and
[28:40] an expectation of his return and so it
[28:43] was an appropriate seasonal greeting of
[28:45] religious people because you would say
[28:47] merry christmas on or very near
[28:49] christmas but during this time you would
[28:51] say happy holidays
[28:53] but as christmas became more and more
[28:55] secular the phrase evolved
[28:58] and even kind of itself became somewhat
[29:01] of used in such a way to say well we
[29:03] can't say merry christmas because it has
[29:05] christ in it but we can say happy
[29:07] holidays because we don't realize it's
[29:09] actually a holy day which would
[29:11] represent you know a date set aside for
[29:13] christian celebration or christmas
[29:15] christian consecration so the phrase
[29:17] happy holidays begins to become more
[29:19] inclusive
[29:21] and i just wanted to give you some
[29:22] examples here from rj reynolds tobacco
[29:25] company
[29:26] how they begin to feature this very
[29:28] prominently in their ads and i think
[29:30] this one's from 1939
[29:34] and it says happy holidays i think it's
[29:36] in there happy holidays and happy
[29:38] smoking
[29:40] and it's in this kind of the left column
[29:41] here an advertisement of camels it's not
[29:43] so i started looking up at this that i
[29:45] finally i realized what the prank was
[29:47] when you called someone and said you
[29:48] have prince albert in a can
[29:50] and they'd say yes you said well then
[29:51] you better let him out that was kind of
[29:52] like the the prank call kids would do
[29:54] back in the 80s
[29:56] but uh this was prince albert i know his
[29:58] fresh tobacco or something in a can but
[30:00] this is an ad for christmas here's
[30:01] wishing you all the happiest holiday
[30:03] season ever happy holidays and happy
[30:05] smoking and this is kind of the
[30:06] symbolism that's entered into marketing
[30:09] of the holidays and then from 1935 in
[30:13] this one
[30:14] this one is seasons greetings you can
[30:16] see how festive it is but this was the
[30:17] part that really stood out to me of
[30:20] course and i believe it's uh right down
[30:21] in the first column at the very
[30:23] bottom
[30:24] uh it said well i think it's in there
[30:26] somewhere i can't remember where this is
[30:27] at oh it's at the top camels the very
[30:29] look at that
[30:31] i love this
[30:32] of course
[30:34] you'll give him you'll give cigarettes
[30:36] for christmas
[30:37] they're such an acceptable gift
[30:40] of course
[30:41] i hadn't thought about it thank you for
[30:43] i've been struggling as to what in the
[30:44] world i was going to get my wife but now
[30:46] i know
[30:47] prince albert in a can is exactly what
[30:50] she would want and is it in this one
[30:52] they have all the people on the bottom
[30:54] maybe you can zoom in on that if it's
[30:55] okay go back to the other one if you can
[30:57] zoom in on what these people are saying
[30:59] here here's these characters i hope the
[31:01] boys know that a girl always appreciates
[31:03] a gift of camel cigarettes
[31:06] and it's this whole each one and it
[31:08] presents something the everyday
[31:10] all-american woman the everyday
[31:12] all-american man hard-working man
[31:13] christian conservative man
[31:15] is what this is the gift that you can
[31:17] give of course happy holidays happy
[31:19] smoking rj
[31:21] reynolds tobacco says go out and buy
[31:24] cigarettes for christmas
[31:26] and then notice what brother adam says i
[31:27] don't believe i provided this statement
[31:28] but it says and this is something comes
[31:30] up in different places when he's talking
[31:32] about these the holidays she got him a
[31:34] carton of a certain kind of cigarettes
[31:36] he's over here in a conversation she got
[31:38] him a carton of a certain kind of
[31:39] cigarettes and the other one said she
[31:41] got him a fifth of whiskey in a deck of
[31:42] cards now if that ain't given a memorial
[31:45] gift for the birth of the lord jesus
[31:47] christ
[31:48] and that's the way it goes you see it's
[31:50] just a big bunch of tinsel it hasn't got
[31:53] christmas in it at all
[31:55] so you see how it's changed where phrase
[31:58] happy holidays might have been
[31:59] originally intended to represent holy
[32:02] days or the advent or chris christian
[32:04] celebration of the season looking
[32:06] forward uh to the celebration of his
[32:08] birth and also looking forward to the
[32:10] time of his return and this time of
[32:12] preparation of his return and you have
[32:14] all these different symbolisms that are
[32:15] mixed in and i'm not saying that the
[32:17] origins are correct or that they're
[32:18] these celebrations are even right or
[32:20] scriptural but they had some sort of
[32:22] significance with respect to
[32:24] christianity there would have been a
[32:25] season that's honoring the birth of
[32:27] christ looking forward to the return of
[32:29] jesus christ but as commercialism begins
[32:32] to enter the picture they take these
[32:34] phrases and co-opt them so now happy
[32:36] holidays is synonymous with happy
[32:38] smoking
[32:40] and then merry christmas no longer means
[32:43] anything about the birth of christ it's
[32:45] just hey this is the season of giving
[32:46] this is the season of buying this is the
[32:48] festive season this is the time of good
[32:49] share this is the time of jingle bells
[32:51] and santa claus and elves and all these
[32:53] different things and that's what it
[32:55] becomes so there's no apparent
[32:57] contradiction or paradox when a
[33:00] cigarette company says hey merry
[33:02] christmas buy some cigarettes
[33:04] but brother branham begins to identify
[33:06] the contradiction
[33:07] he said this does this doesn't make
[33:09] sense and notice how he says this
[33:10] doesn't have christmas in it at all
[33:13] the buying of cigarettes the buying of
[33:15] whiskey as a memorial for the birth of
[33:17] jesus christ let's call it what it is
[33:19] you're not buying a carton of cigarettes
[33:21] you're not buying a fifth of whiskey
[33:23] you're not buying these different things
[33:24] and all these other gifts to honor the
[33:26] birth of jesus christ you're doing it
[33:28] because it's what everyone else is doing
[33:30] it's the season it's the time
[33:34] and this is where it to me it just
[33:36] beautifully begins to segue into
[33:39] the things that brother branham begin to
[33:40] identify about the dangers of christmas
[33:43] and this use this phrase happy holidays
[33:46] to me really just emphasizes it because
[33:48] satan's tactic this is satan's tactic
[33:50] and i think we've identified this
[33:51] through a number of services even over
[33:53] the last several months and maybe over
[33:54] the last year satan wants to
[33:57] he can't create he can he only can
[33:59] pervert right
[34:00] so
[34:01] satan is not the purveyor of positive
[34:03] messages
[34:04] like he's not somebody that's got some
[34:06] good news he's not somebody that can br
[34:08] bring forth something clean and
[34:10] something pure so what satan one of
[34:12] satan's tactics not being able to create
[34:14] and only be able to pervert one of his
[34:16] tactics is to create a lightning rod
[34:19] something that's going to draw attention
[34:21] uh divert something towards like a
[34:23] lightning rod is meant to attract the
[34:25] attention of the lightning so they can
[34:27] properly divert it through a safe
[34:29] channel
[34:30] satan wants to create a lightning rod in
[34:32] order to divert our attention we have
[34:34] energy we have focus we have drive we
[34:35] have ambition there's things we want to
[34:36] do
[34:37] things we want to accomplish we have a
[34:38] desire to serve god we've got the holy
[34:40] ghost burning inside of us uh whatever
[34:42] it might be our youth
[34:44] or zeal our passion whatever it might be
[34:46] insane wants to somehow distract that
[34:49] so that we channel it towards something
[34:51] else and not put it towards the right
[34:53] things now that that goes for december
[34:56] and then january through november 2.
[34:57] that's any time 365 that satan's tactic
[35:00] to try to create a diversion
[35:03] and what he wants us to do even in the
[35:05] context of christmas is he wants to
[35:07] direct our energy towards a straw man
[35:10] something that doesn't have any life in
[35:12] it something that's not even real
[35:13] something that's just fabricated
[35:15] something that in many instances has no
[35:17] real backing or real truth behind it but
[35:20] it kind of gets propped up and says see
[35:21] this they're telling us to say happy
[35:23] holidays and this is a an attack against
[35:25] christmas why don't you spend the next
[35:27] two hours trying to write a letter to
[35:28] your senator to tell them to bring back
[35:30] merry christmas and put the nativity
[35:32] scene back at the post office and do
[35:34] this and do that and you get all riled
[35:35] up you're like these are just straw man
[35:37] arguments
[35:39] that you typically in a straw man
[35:40] argument and guess what luther is one of
[35:42] the earliest noted people using the
[35:44] phrase once again he just crops up in
[35:46] these things and he talks about the
[35:48] catholic church and these people
[35:49] creating a straw man just to burn it
[35:51] down and that's what happens in an
[35:52] argument you create a fake person a fake
[35:55] argument a fake principle and then you
[35:57] attack it and tear it down ooh see that
[35:59] there really was nothing to it but
[36:01] that's what even the devil's getting us
[36:02] to do
[36:04] we're getting in the fight with
[36:05] something that there's nothing to it and
[36:06] we're trying to tear it down what's
[36:08] happening is we're getting we're
[36:09] directing our energy towards something
[36:10] there's nothing to it it's false it's
[36:12] fake it's empty it's void but yet we're
[36:14] directing our energy towards it
[36:17] notice these four different scriptures
[36:19] in
[36:20] timothy and titus
[36:24] in first timothy chapter 1
[36:27] verse 4 neither give heed to fables
[36:30] in endless genealogies which minister
[36:32] questions
[36:34] rather than godly edifying which is in
[36:36] faith
[36:38] this
[36:39] this i i realize here i have a typo in
[36:42] my in my notes and so i'm wanting to be
[36:44] sure that i've got
[36:45] i know the scripture will be right it'll
[36:47] be read correctly but i just want to
[36:48] make sure
[36:50] yeah i don't know what i put in here but
[36:52] i know the uh might just have it in here
[36:55] twice so
[36:57] i'm going to start looking off of this
[36:58] in a moment i think i got my notes mixed
[37:00] up here but nick don't give heed to
[37:03] fables and endless genealogies
[37:06] fables if you if you look at that word
[37:08] as far as a fable it's a narrative
[37:10] or a story
[37:12] just a narrative just a story
[37:14] but a fable is typically referring to a
[37:17] fiction or an invention or a falsehood a
[37:20] fable is a legend something spurious a
[37:23] species something that doesn't maybe
[37:24] have any truth to it or any origin or
[37:26] foundation something superstitious
[37:29] this is what a fable is neither give
[37:31] heed to fables and endless genealogies
[37:34] which minister questions rather than the
[37:36] godly edifying which is in faith
[37:39] peter even refers to it as cunningly
[37:41] devised fables they're cunningly devised
[37:44] they're devised for a reason they take
[37:45] things and cherry pick and put things
[37:47] together and create this this monster
[37:49] create this idea create this lord create
[37:51] this mythology and they do it so that it
[37:53] can get our attention maybe one if i can
[37:56] get them to believe it and they get
[37:57] mixed up in this that's gonna hold them
[37:59] back but also just think if you're
[38:01] trying to roll up your sleeves and punch
[38:02] against it
[38:04] and it's just a tar baby it's just
[38:06] something that's going to get you
[38:07] distracted something's going to get you
[38:08] all mixed up it's trying to bait you
[38:10] into a fight he's saying so don't give
[38:12] heed to fables and endless genealogies
[38:14] this and that and he's he says they just
[38:16] minister questions
[38:18] oh i'm going to prove this well i got to
[38:20] prove that oh i got to prove that and
[38:21] you just keep going through and he says
[38:22] it doesn't edify it's not godly edifying
[38:26] which is in faith so he's saying what
[38:27] should we do we should use godly
[38:29] edifying which is in faith faith which
[38:32] is edifying godly edifying he's bringing
[38:34] this contrast between the fables and
[38:36] this edifying
[38:38] he says in first timothy 4 7
[38:41] but refuse profane and old wives fables
[38:46] and exercise thyself rather undo
[38:48] godliness profane it's a profane it has
[38:50] this meaning a godless myth
[38:54] for re refuse profane fables a godless
[38:58] myth a godless fiction something that's
[38:59] superstitious refuse profane fables it
[39:03] would say don't give heed to them don't
[39:04] argue with them don't try to figure them
[39:06] out don't make them part of your
[39:07] repertoire don't build your life around
[39:10] it don't give heed to them refuse old
[39:13] wives tables something superstitious
[39:16] something without any basis something
[39:18] just sort of narrative that's passed
[39:19] along refuse profane and old wives
[39:21] fables but exercise yourself into god
[39:24] unto godliness
[39:26] what's the next one i have there
[39:29] yeah it's duplicated that okay
[39:32] and titus 1 14
[39:34] and you can see what's being uh
[39:35] juxtaposed here is the truth which is
[39:39] godliness the truth which is godly
[39:41] edifying in faith versus things that are
[39:43] false are empty
[39:45] then in titus he says not given heed to
[39:47] jewish fables
[39:49] and commandments of men
[39:51] that turn from the truth
[39:54] don't give heed to jewish fables that
[39:56] kind of brings it really close to home
[39:58] and commandments of men that turn from
[40:00] the truth he's referring to here these
[40:03] jewish fables commandments of men we can
[40:04] see these things even today that would
[40:06] exist within christianity that there's
[40:09] church fables
[40:10] there's church tradition there's church
[40:12] legends there's church things that
[40:14] evolved through different uh sects of
[40:17] protestant denominations and through the
[40:19] reformation that became part of
[40:20] religious celebrations and religious
[40:22] beliefs doctrines and theologies and
[40:24] saints and orders and certain things
[40:27] that even the catholic church later on
[40:28] goes oops let's dig up their bones let's
[40:30] make them a saint and so there's like
[40:32] this cross-section of all these things
[40:33] being added together this is instructive
[40:35] to us to not give heed to church fables
[40:38] i'll just say it don't give heat to
[40:39] conservative fables
[40:42] don't give heat to political fables
[40:44] liberal fables don't give heed to him
[40:46] because a fable means there's no truth
[40:48] in it
[40:49] it's something that there's nothing to
[40:51] it it's empty
[40:52] and this is what when i refer to how
[40:54] christmas has become secular if there
[40:56] was any truth to it it's stripped out of
[40:59] it
[41:00] and we know there is a truth to it if
[41:02] there was a real meaning or spirit
[41:03] behind it it's been stripped out of it
[41:05] so that now it's it's void of any real
[41:07] religious significance it's void of any
[41:09] real spiritual significance it's void of
[41:11] any real undergirding of truth and
[41:14] sanctification
[41:15] and any kind of ceremony that would make
[41:17] it the real honor of the birth of christ
[41:19] and so now what it's become is christmas
[41:21] has become part of the fables and the
[41:23] fiction that we live with every day
[41:28] and the connection that brother brennan
[41:29] makes most often is the christmas
[41:31] the connection of christmas to paganism
[41:35] and and i think this is going to be it's
[41:37] very obvious to us because it's the
[41:38] maybe the what we hear most often
[41:40] mentioned about christmases it's pagan
[41:42] it's pagans pagan
[41:43] and so for the the connections of
[41:45] christmas to paganism paganism
[41:48] scripturally
[41:49] refers to idol worship
[41:51] paganism scripturally
[41:53] more in a more broad sense would refer
[41:55] to false religions so if there's use of
[41:57] paganism or heathen religions
[42:00] i like to say heather and i'm going to
[42:01] get myself on that that slide again and
[42:04] maybe not be able to get back but
[42:04] heathen traditions
[42:06] and it would refer to or uh false
[42:09] religions as maybe the word that would
[42:10] be used
[42:11] but it's really something oh let me just
[42:14] read this scripture because in the
[42:16] scripture an idol is something with
[42:18] nothing first corinthians chapter 10
[42:19] verse 14
[42:20] an idol even the word in the etymology
[42:22] in the hebrew an idol means nothing it's
[42:24] worthless there's nothing to it and so
[42:26] paul instructs the corinthian church
[42:28] wherefore my deliver my dearly beloved
[42:31] flee from idolatry
[42:34] flee from the worship of things that are
[42:36] empty flee from the consecrating
[42:38] ourselves and giving ourselves over to
[42:39] the things that are worthless flee from
[42:41] adultery the worship of things that are
[42:43] false as we mentioned before idolatry
[42:45] can be defined as anything that strays
[42:46] from the word
[42:48] into worship whether it be worship or
[42:50] just a belief or conviction
[42:52] but it's typically associated with with
[42:54] worship
[42:56] and so the word pagan in more modern
[42:58] parlance
[43:00] maybe our vocabulary when we speak of
[43:01] pagan
[43:02] it would be used to define someone who's
[43:04] not a jew christian or muslim
[43:07] and that's the real strict use of the
[43:08] word pagan is someone who's not a
[43:10] christian not a jew or a muslim or maybe
[43:12] more particularly in our use is be
[43:14] something that is non-christian
[43:17] sometimes it's not based on the
[43:18] principles of jesus christ it doesn't
[43:20] draw from maybe uh uh the bible and so
[43:23] we could say pagan on a broadway as well
[43:25] if you're not a jew a muslim or a
[43:26] christian then you're pagan even though
[43:29] you may be religious
[43:30] even though you may not be religious you
[43:32] may not even worship false idol but if
[43:33] you're not in one of these major
[43:35] christian a christian jew or muslim then
[43:37] you're considered a pagan even if you
[43:39] don't believe in any deity at all
[43:41] and you'll find that when it comes to
[43:42] paganism paganism is identified as in
[43:45] its genesis as beginning at the tower of
[43:47] babel in babylon and balaam and
[43:50] different these different elements that
[43:51] we can see from babel and nimrod that's
[43:53] where paganism began
[43:56] so paganism is closely associated with
[43:58] babylon
[44:00] and currently
[44:01] there's many many pagan influence
[44:04] traditions that kind of clutter our
[44:05] seasonal celebrations a lot of pagan uh
[44:09] influenced traditions oh this isn't
[44:11] pagan influence well you know it might
[44:14] have started out non-pagan but pagans
[44:16] always up to something co-opted right
[44:20] and so now a happy holidays happy
[44:21] smoking
[44:22] and things get covered up and things get
[44:24] twisted and things kind of take on a
[44:25] different meaning and so there's a lot
[44:27] of real genuine things that have a
[44:29] genuine pagan origin that kind of muddy
[44:31] up this christmas time and these
[44:33] seasonal celebrations
[44:34] and even historically if you want to
[44:36] even go back before christmas begin to
[44:38] be celebrated there's a lot of pagan
[44:39] asso traditions associated with this
[44:42] time of year winter festivals and and
[44:44] winter gods and gods of uh uh of seasons
[44:47] and certain images and idols that are
[44:49] related to this time of year so if
[44:51] there's things that are related to this
[44:52] time of year there's a way that they
[44:54] kind of begin entering into the picture
[44:56] old man winter and these different
[44:57] things of yule time and a lot of
[44:59] different elements
[45:01] and if you go back even further
[45:04] and and i'm leading to something here so
[45:06] just stay with me
[45:08] there are specific customs of
[45:10] non-christian cultures you can say pagan
[45:12] cultures
[45:13] that predate christ
[45:15] that are part of our modern day
[45:16] celebrations there's a lot of uh pagan
[45:19] non-christian cultures uh different
[45:21] customs that predate the celebration of
[45:23] christmas that are somehow part of now
[45:27] the celebration of christmas
[45:29] and this is how brother bradham
[45:30] summarize i feel he uses a statement to
[45:32] refer to christianity in general that
[45:34] it's what it's become but he uses this
[45:36] phrase babylonian paganism wrapped up in
[45:38] christian terminology
[45:41] notice this phrase babylonian paganism
[45:44] wrapped up in christian terminology in a
[45:46] lot of ways there's a lot of babylonian
[45:48] paganism wrapped up in christmas
[45:50] terminology
[45:54] there's a merging of heathen worship
[45:57] with christian things
[45:59] and here's a here's a number of
[46:00] statements connecting present day
[46:01] christmas celebrations to paganism i'm
[46:03] going to rattle off about seven
[46:04] different statements here uh because i
[46:06] want you just to see how brother banham
[46:09] goes down this track and identifies it
[46:11] he called the celebration of christmas
[46:13] pagan devil worship
[46:16] and another place he called
[46:18] it a pagan superstition
[46:22] elsewhere he said christmas is no more
[46:24] worship it's a celebration drinking
[46:26] gambling carousing just pagan to the
[46:29] limit
[46:31] he says they've just paganized it and
[46:33] paganized it until it's all become pagan
[46:36] so notice there's a paganizing of it
[46:38] even in the language that he's using
[46:40] uh that we see now it's become all pagan
[46:43] but there's something that has been
[46:45] paganized
[46:46] it's a great commercial day of
[46:48] celebration paganized paganist become
[46:50] pagan it's a great commercial day of
[46:52] celebration how a christmas tree has
[46:54] anything to do with the birth of christ
[46:56] it's pagan friends we've got off the
[46:58] path somewhere
[47:00] again in a few weeks or even right now
[47:01] there's reindeers and santa clauses and
[47:03] jingle bells and all kinds of things
[47:05] hanging up which is pagan ceremony it's
[47:07] an article of the catholic church
[47:10] so there's where he identifies paganism
[47:12] people paying great prices and swapping
[47:15] presents and things like that pagan
[47:18] notice where he's putting this thing's
[47:19] starting to get a little bit tighter now
[47:21] i mean we're all feeling very free and
[47:23] we're regretting that we didn't wear a
[47:24] candy cane tie today
[47:27] and then we start reading these things
[47:28] about pagan ceremony pagan superstition
[47:31] and it's all pagan pagan to the limit
[47:33] he says and still worship christmas
[47:36] now it's santa claus oh mercy still more
[47:38] pagan festivals added to it
[47:41] and so they're still trying to worship
[47:43] christmas but now it's santa claus and
[47:44] they're still adding more and more pagan
[47:46] things to it and then the last one we
[47:48] find at this christmas time with all
[47:50] tinsel of christmas the santa claus
[47:51] light the pagan traits and things
[47:54] dropped into both catholic and
[47:55] protestant churches and just as corrupt
[47:57] as it can be
[47:59] this is brother branham recognizing or i
[48:02] say recognizing but
[48:04] identifying and highlighting that
[48:06] there's a lot of paganism that relates
[48:08] to modern day christmas celebrations and
[48:10] what is it it's things that are
[48:12] non-christian
[48:13] things that are non-biblical things that
[48:15] do not relate to things that have no
[48:17] spiritual basis things that don't have
[48:19] any spirituality to it and
[48:21] behind it he starts roping it into
[48:24] certain elements of babylon which is
[48:25] devil worship
[48:27] he calls it devil worship that's a very
[48:29] strong phrase to talk about the
[48:30] celebration of christian christmas is
[48:32] pagan devil worship
[48:34] these are very very very strong
[48:36] statements
[48:37] and the one place that brother branham
[48:39] identified that
[48:41] these pagan symbols
[48:43] unite with christian symbols and these
[48:45] things begin to mix he focuses often on
[48:48] the date of december 25th
[48:50] and i know you you're familiar with
[48:52] these things and i want to start
[48:54] transitioning now looking at the
[48:55] specific date
[48:57] these things kind of begin to collide
[48:59] december 25th there's a lot of pagan
[49:01] ceremonies and customs prior to
[49:04] invented later
[49:06] as a response to christmas celebrations
[49:08] and then christian traditions begin to
[49:09] mix in and then you even see where
[49:11] uh constantine began to encourage the
[49:14] blending of different festivals and
[49:15] christian things and now as they begin
[49:18] to mix it creates a lightning rod
[49:21] for criticism it creates a lightning rod
[49:23] or an alternative counterculture for
[49:25] celebrating and it can get us caught up
[49:27] in this idea that christmas is being
[49:29] co-opted this is a war on christmas and
[49:31] we don't want to get knocked off balance
[49:33] but when it comes to the exact date of
[49:36] christ's birth we mentioned before and
[49:37] i'm coming back to these things the
[49:39] bible and the very earliest christian
[49:41] writers paul irenaeus and different ones
[49:43] never gave a specific date to the birth
[49:46] of christ isn't that interesting
[49:48] they never said yep he was born on this
[49:50] day he was born on that day and it seems
[49:51] that they being very familiar with the
[49:53] times and the events
[49:55] would have been able to affix at least
[49:56] some season to it and say well he was
[49:58] born in the first quarter he's born in
[49:59] the last quarter one some and i'm
[50:01] talking about of the year like fiscal
[50:03] quarters and
[50:04] financial statements not football or
[50:06] basketball but he's born in some
[50:09] some segment of time and be able to
[50:11] identify during some season even related
[50:13] to some feasts while he's born during
[50:14] this feast or he's born near that feast
[50:16] but these things are not emphasized in
[50:19] the bible nor is it even emphasized in
[50:21] the very earliest writers
[50:24] of the christian church
[50:25] but the earliest writing they can find
[50:27] is around 200 a.d clement of alexandria
[50:30] he was an egyptian he's from egyptia
[50:31] egypt and he wrote something that was
[50:33] kind of called miscellaneous it's called
[50:35] the
[50:35] stromatius and it just means
[50:37] miscellaneous musings i guess and it's
[50:40] the early earliest known writing that
[50:42] actually refers to very specific dates
[50:44] and what he's trying to do is
[50:46] very uh interesting he's trying to count
[50:48] the number of days basically
[50:50] or a number of years from adam to christ
[50:52] and to the end of the world he's using
[50:53] all these
[50:54] complex arguments and different things
[50:56] and so he's referring to this very
[50:58] specific time period that from the death
[51:00] of christ to the death of this other
[51:01] person or the uh that this was so many
[51:04] days or so many years and so people take
[51:06] that reference because he's trying to
[51:07] tell the whole story of everything the
[51:09] whole universe and give day give dates
[51:11] and times they take from that and they
[51:12] back out of that one statement november
[51:15] 17th and january 6. how they do it is
[51:17] very weird but they do it they come up
[51:19] with it and someone says no it's this
[51:21] thing go well you didn't count for the
[51:22] leap years and you didn't count for this
[51:24] and you didn't translate that right and
[51:25] they all get this big fight over really
[51:27] what uh clement was talking about and
[51:28] who how did he know that people
[51:31] in this day and age would be debating
[51:32] his calculation or just these number of
[51:35] days he threw out there
[51:36] but then he makes this statement and
[51:38] there are those who have determined not
[51:40] only the year of our lord's birth but
[51:42] also the day
[51:44] now one thing he was highlighting
[51:45] emphasizing is when he died the passion
[51:47] of christ he gives very specific dates
[51:48] to that but mixed into this he says
[51:50] there's those who have determined not
[51:51] only the year but the day
[51:54] and he gives these different dates of
[51:56] and he uses the egyptian
[51:58] month and day which would uh you you
[52:00] then have to convert to the julian
[52:01] calendar and he gives the dates of may
[52:03] 20th april 19th or april 20th
[52:06] and when i was looking at myself just
[52:08] fact checking i looked at it and it was
[52:10] like it showed april 16th and i was like
[52:12] i knew it i knew it
[52:14] and then i was looking at the wrong day
[52:16] but it's april 19th and april 20th are
[52:18] these dates that
[52:20] and him being in 200 a.d he's saying
[52:22] there's many people so this is the
[52:23] narrative that exists within the
[52:24] christian church and this guy was a very
[52:26] devout christian very student of the
[52:28] word and these are the early this is the
[52:29] early church uh and they're trying to
[52:32] know more about christ and share these
[52:33] things and pouring through the bible in
[52:35] the writings and digesting everything
[52:37] that they could and this is the
[52:38] narrative that exists broadly because he
[52:40] was well traveled that christ was born
[52:42] on may 20th or christ others that say he
[52:44] was born on april 19th or april 20th
[52:47] and then there's others that were
[52:48] associated with him that also wrote and
[52:51] referred to him and they have these
[52:52] writings they can go and they have these
[52:54] these manuscripts it's very very
[52:55] fascinating to go back and find how
[52:57] they've preserved some of these things
[52:58] and where they're located but he had
[53:00] contemporaries those that were
[53:02] identified as not students of his but
[53:04] associates
[53:06] that also in their writings would affix
[53:08] a date of christ's death
[53:10] and many of them said that christ died
[53:12] on march 25th and that was the date that
[53:14] they affixed his death to
[53:17] and and then this is this is in the
[53:18] original and um and i actually i don't
[53:21] know if i should admit to this
[53:23] but i actually found the original greek
[53:25] in the original latin
[53:26] and i used google translate
[53:30] to translate
[53:31] what was actually being said going back
[53:33] to the original text in the original
[53:34] manuscript because i wanted to know
[53:35] exactly what was being said and not what
[53:37] was being said later because what
[53:39] happened with these manuscripts is later
[53:41] the translators when someone said in the
[53:43] year of when the christ was born in
[53:46] bethlehem
[53:48] it was so many years later until his
[53:50] death in his passion in the year in the
[53:53] 15th year the reign of tiberias so they
[53:55] make reference to something but then the
[53:57] later on the translator is going in the
[53:58] year of his birth in bethlehem which was
[54:00] on january 6 or which was eight days
[54:04] after december 25th they went in and
[54:07] added it later
[54:09] and they started adding this is people
[54:10] who aren't being honest with it they're
[54:12] not uh uh they're not using uh they're
[54:15] not saying well let's just convey what
[54:17] was being said they want to say what
[54:18] they think it meant and so they begin to
[54:21] translators and these scholars begin to
[54:23] insert december 25th into the translated
[54:26] date but you don't have a lot of men you
[54:28] don't have anybody really saying yep
[54:30] even those early
[54:31] 200s 300s you don't have any of these
[54:34] early church writers saying yep it was
[54:35] on this day until the catholic church
[54:37] begins to get involved
[54:39] and then the proclamations are beginning
[54:40] to me this is when it is made that this
[54:43] day should be and this day is
[54:46] uh the date when christ was born
[54:50] and so there's really a lot of
[54:53] uh fables related to the date december
[54:56] 25th
[54:57] there's a lot of fables but then there's
[54:58] also some interesting
[55:00] facts that people try to bring into it
[55:03] i want to i'm going to do this as an
[55:06] exercise
[55:07] if we haven't had enough already i
[55:09] apologize
[55:10] but there i want to look at some
[55:12] scriptural clues that are used to piece
[55:14] together a date of birth not necessarily
[55:16] a year so much even though there's some
[55:18] debate on that when did herod die was it
[55:19] this year was it that year
[55:21] and there's always a debate as to where
[55:23] it might be
[55:24] but there's different scriptural clues
[55:26] let's look at luke chapter one
[55:28] and i'm just going to pull from this a
[55:30] few verses that we read already because
[55:32] many used the birth of john luke uses
[55:34] the birth of john to set up the birth of
[55:36] jesus christ
[55:37] but many many scholars many theologians
[55:39] many researchers use the birth of john
[55:41] because there's details given to the
[55:42] birth of john that people can use to say
[55:45] kind of back into when christ was born
[55:47] and i'm gonna just use this exercise to
[55:49] make a point i'm not trying to say thus
[55:51] saith the lord or this is actually what
[55:52] it is but just notice this scriptural
[55:54] exercise in luke chapter one verse five
[55:56] there was in the days of herod the king
[55:58] of judea a certain priest named
[55:59] zacharias of the course of abia and his
[56:02] wife was of the daughters of aaron and
[56:04] her name was elizabeth so this scripture
[56:05] is telling us that zacharias was part of
[56:07] a particular order of the priest the
[56:10] priesthood he was of the course or the
[56:11] division of abia
[56:13] and then it gives us this detail in
[56:14] verse 8 and it came to pass that why he
[56:16] was he executed the priest's office
[56:19] before god in the order of his course so
[56:21] there was an order that his course the
[56:23] course of abia would have been there at
[56:26] the temple serving in the temple so this
[56:28] place is zechariah in the temple
[56:31] according to a certain order
[56:33] and a certain
[56:34] um
[56:35] process according to the custom of the
[56:37] priest's office his law was to burn
[56:39] incense when he went into the temple of
[56:41] the lord
[56:42] that's in first chronicles chapter 24 i
[56:43] believe that lists 24 different
[56:45] divisions of the priest
[56:47] and scripturally and even historically
[56:49] these divisions of priests were
[56:51] instituted so that it wasn't just always
[56:54] a group of men that always served in the
[56:56] temple but they rotated they had shifts
[56:59] and they rotated their temple service
[57:01] and so the bible tells us that zacharias
[57:03] was the priest after the order of of
[57:05] abeah and you might when you read it in
[57:08] chronicles you might when you anglicize
[57:10] it say abhija but it's the eighth order
[57:13] and these orders each serve twice a year
[57:15] now i know i already lost you at the rj
[57:17] reynolds uh
[57:18] you know slide but just stay with me i
[57:20] know this is very very dry and we may be
[57:21] losing people
[57:23] around christmas time which would be a
[57:24] shame but just stay with me this is very
[57:26] i think this is important it's a good
[57:28] exercise
[57:29] so we can scripturally determine that
[57:31] there were priests that served at
[57:32] different intervals
[57:34] this is like a word problem that you
[57:35] dread right
[57:36] and zacharias was part of the eighth
[57:39] interval the eighth order that served
[57:41] twice a year
[57:43] and so luke 1 tells us this is very
[57:45] striking luke 1 tells us despite the
[57:47] ebbs and flows of the priesthood luke 1
[57:50] tells us that the system was in place
[57:52] and that they were actually honoring the
[57:54] system in the second temple they were
[57:55] back they were serving and so the priest
[57:57] would serve once uh served for one week
[58:00] twice a year
[58:01] 24 divisions rotating one two three four
[58:04] and then starting all over again
[58:06] and so they had these divisions that
[58:08] went uh served back and forth so if you
[58:10] could look at a schedule and say well if
[58:12] you work three days you're number one
[58:14] and you work three days then number two
[58:15] works three days
[58:16] and you can lay out the schedule
[58:18] now what's interesting as there's very
[58:20] very good this is the method that's used
[58:22] there's very very good historical
[58:23] records that can tell us
[58:27] which division was serving on a
[58:29] particular day
[58:31] and i think josephus does it the talmud
[58:34] does it there's a lot of different
[58:34] rabbitical traditions and writings that
[58:37] indicate which priest division was
[58:39] serving when jerusalem was sieged when
[58:42] titus besieged jerusalem and there's
[58:43] some maybe some scholars
[58:46] scholarship related to the ex date 70
[58:47] a.d 69 a.d there's different dates that
[58:49] are given but they know that's just like
[58:51] the moving year a d and b c can move but
[58:54] the events don't change in their and
[58:56] their distance from one another but they
[58:59] usually say oh well yahori was serving
[59:02] in the temple and it has a very unique
[59:04] scriptural significance to to prior
[59:06] invasions but now when the temple fell
[59:08] they know for a fact that this division
[59:11] was serving in what week it was and when
[59:13] their service was ending so you can
[59:15] actually and it's a
[59:17] others have done it for us so we don't
[59:18] have to do it but i got 80 slides i want
[59:20] to show you the work
[59:22] they back into
[59:24] all right if they were serving on that
[59:25] day and they're this order then this
[59:27] order was serving for a week this order
[59:29] was serving for a week and they do the
[59:31] math and they show the work
[59:34] and they come to where they identify
[59:36] that it was on august 4th that the siege
[59:38] the siege of the temple and they begin
[59:40] to work backwards
[59:41] so they can find out what time of
[59:44] year that zacharias may have been
[59:47] working narrow it down to the week and
[59:49] the time of year
[59:51] so now notice this in luke chapter 1
[59:53] verse 23
[59:55] verse to 27.
[1:00:00] luke chapter 1 verses 23 to 27 and it
[1:00:02] came to pass that as soon as the days of
[1:00:04] his administration were accomplished so
[1:00:06] this is he had a week to serve his days
[1:00:09] are over he departed to his own house
[1:00:11] according to the custom at the time he
[1:00:13] would have kept to himself and not had
[1:00:14] any uh he would have waited for a
[1:00:16] purification for sanctification and so
[1:00:18] the days of administration were
[1:00:19] accomplished he departed to his own
[1:00:21] house and after those days his wife
[1:00:23] elizabeth conceived and hid herself five
[1:00:26] months saying the lord hath dealt with
[1:00:28] me in the days when he looked on me to
[1:00:30] take away my reproach among men
[1:00:33] so we can affix a date of john's
[1:00:36] conception
[1:00:38] to the time after zechariah served in
[1:00:40] the temple and he comes home and
[1:00:42] sometime soon after zechariah comes home
[1:00:45] and they can fix it to a time of
[1:00:46] purification where he would have been
[1:00:48] set aside and not been with his wife
[1:00:50] that this is the time that she would
[1:00:51] have conceived and so there's actually a
[1:00:53] way to back into a date of john's
[1:00:55] conception isn't that interesting
[1:00:58] just saying this is a method this is a
[1:00:59] process that people use but then notice
[1:01:01] how extraordinary this is verse 26 and
[1:01:03] in the sixth month the angel gabriel was
[1:01:06] sent from god under a city of galilee
[1:01:07] named nazareth so in the sixth month of
[1:01:10] her pregnancy
[1:01:11] the angel gabriel appears and who does
[1:01:13] he come to in verse 27 to a virgin
[1:01:15] espoused to a man whose name was joseph
[1:01:17] of the house of david and the virgin's
[1:01:19] name was mary
[1:01:22] thinking catholicism they called the
[1:01:23] annunciation
[1:01:25] the conception the proclamation the
[1:01:27] announcing of the birth and that at this
[1:01:29] time the holy ghost was going to
[1:01:30] overshadow it very near to this time and
[1:01:32] this this date has very strong
[1:01:34] significance amongst catholics it's a
[1:01:36] very strong significance because you
[1:01:37] know it begins to revolve more around
[1:01:39] mary to even i think now the immaculate
[1:01:41] conception is mary's birth not even the
[1:01:43] birth of christ so there's a lot of lore
[1:01:45] and mythology related to mary here but
[1:01:46] notice the bible lays this out zacharias
[1:01:50] gets off of work one week comes home and
[1:01:52] sometime within the next couple weeks or
[1:01:54] so his wife conceives and then we have a
[1:01:56] date where the holy ghost is going to
[1:01:58] overshadow mary and then mary is going
[1:02:01] to be is going to conceive
[1:02:04] and now
[1:02:04] this is something that i found very very
[1:02:06] interesting
[1:02:08] what the catholic tradition does or the
[1:02:10] church did is they swapped the date of
[1:02:12] his birth
[1:02:13] for the date of conception
[1:02:16] and they took his they took what would
[1:02:18] have been his date of birth and they
[1:02:20] swapped it as the date of conception so
[1:02:22] you count forward from what they believe
[1:02:23] to be the date of conception he account
[1:02:25] for nine months guess what magically
[1:02:27] happens he's born on around december
[1:02:29] 25th
[1:02:31] because they take anything that would
[1:02:32] indicate when he was born and they say
[1:02:35] no that's when he was conceived
[1:02:38] because they put the miraculous they put
[1:02:40] the they put the uh the focus on mary
[1:02:44] conceiving
[1:02:45] and so this is what the church has done
[1:02:47] they've actually swapped things around
[1:02:49] and then that's what stays and begins to
[1:02:50] stick it's part of how that mythology
[1:02:52] develops
[1:02:55] but many scholars then taking these
[1:02:57] intervals of when the priests would
[1:02:59] serve being able to identify when
[1:03:01] zacharias would have been serving
[1:03:03] in year one two three or four
[1:03:06] bc or even one two three or four a.d
[1:03:09] they're very very tightly close together
[1:03:11] many scholars and i'm so i'm not just
[1:03:13] sharing my opinion because i did the
[1:03:14] math i'm just showing you a method many
[1:03:16] scholars estimate that john was born in
[1:03:18] late september
[1:03:20] based upon his date of service they say
[1:03:23] that he was born in late september and
[1:03:25] it says in luke chapter 1 verse 36 and
[1:03:27] behold this is mary coming to
[1:03:30] uh this is what the angel says
[1:03:33] uh to mary and behold thy cousin
[1:03:35] elizabeth she have also conceived a son
[1:03:37] in her old age this is what the angel is
[1:03:39] telling mary at this time and this is
[1:03:41] the sixth month with her who was called
[1:03:44] barren
[1:03:45] so the bible's telling us very clearly
[1:03:47] that if john was born on a particular
[1:03:49] month you can go back and find that
[1:03:51] there's a six month difference from the
[1:03:53] time that
[1:03:54] elizabeth conceived and about the time
[1:03:57] that mary would conceive
[1:03:59] even the bible tells us that mary went
[1:04:00] to visit elizabeth and she carried with
[1:04:02] her three months
[1:04:04] and it would have and the dates worked
[1:04:05] perfectly if she's six months pregnant
[1:04:07] and then mary goes and visits her and is
[1:04:09] there about this the language suggests
[1:04:10] she's there about three months leaves
[1:04:12] just prior to birth which would have
[1:04:13] made sense as far as her not being
[1:04:15] defiled and and participating in the
[1:04:17] birth and different things mary leaves
[1:04:19] the scene the child john is born and
[1:04:22] based upon a particular interval of when
[1:04:24] john would serve
[1:04:26] or when zacharias would serve it's easy
[1:04:28] to kind of back into the date
[1:04:31] that john was born in september and if
[1:04:33] mary conceived six months later then
[1:04:35] jesus was likely born in march or april
[1:04:39] if she was conceived six months later
[1:04:41] then elizabeth trust me the math checks
[1:04:43] out i did it by hand even it's all right
[1:04:46] six months this date that date and they
[1:04:48] find that this is when jesus was likely
[1:04:50] born if john was born
[1:04:51] in september six months later late
[1:04:54] september six months later gets you in
[1:04:56] march or april
[1:04:58] and this is one way that you can begin
[1:05:00] to identify that maybe christ wasn't
[1:05:02] born if we use scriptural clues on
[1:05:04] december 25th
[1:05:06] but
[1:05:08] just change the date of zechariah's
[1:05:09] service to the other interval
[1:05:11] right because we don't know right
[1:05:13] we're not sure which one it is but he
[1:05:15] changed it to the later rotation then
[1:05:16] elizabeth conceives in late september
[1:05:18] john is born in june at the summer
[1:05:20] solstice and guess what
[1:05:23] jesus was born in the winter between
[1:05:25] december 21st and december 27th at the
[1:05:27] at the at the winter solstice just
[1:05:29] change just swap the dates of service
[1:05:32] so as soon as you thought you had it
[1:05:33] figured out right
[1:05:35] no it was the second rotation that that
[1:05:37] the scripture is referring to
[1:05:40] and i
[1:05:41] and i i want to make this note
[1:05:44] really not all the justifications for
[1:05:45] christmas being on december 25th are
[1:05:47] pagan
[1:05:49] there's a lot of scholarship there's a
[1:05:50] lot of study there's a lot of um
[1:05:53] piecing together scriptures and
[1:05:54] narratives and birthdays and ceremonies
[1:05:56] and emperors and caesars and uh feast
[1:05:59] days and there's a lot of research
[1:06:01] trying to in this sincerity we got we
[1:06:03] need to know the date we need to know
[1:06:04] the date we need another day how can we
[1:06:05] figure it out and then things begin to
[1:06:07] get defend you get locked into a
[1:06:08] position no there's a there's a real
[1:06:10] strong sect of people that believe that
[1:06:12] christ was born on september 11th
[1:06:15] and i'm thinking yeah that makes a lot
[1:06:16] of sense now right because they say
[1:06:17] that's the reason why the muslims bombed
[1:06:20] the world trade center twice on the same
[1:06:22] date and and that's the reason why this
[1:06:24] was used in different times because it's
[1:06:26] so special to the birth of christ
[1:06:27] september 11th and it has some sort of
[1:06:29] symmetry with the jewish traditions but
[1:06:31] notice it's this argument these things
[1:06:33] you say well brother and that's what
[1:06:34] you've been doing for three services all
[1:06:35] right i get it i'm transitioning i'm
[1:06:38] getting out of this
[1:06:39] but not all the justifications for
[1:06:41] december 25th being the birth of christ
[1:06:43] are derived from paganism some of it's
[1:06:46] just scholarship and research trying to
[1:06:47] figure out when christ was born
[1:06:49] but this is the point
[1:06:51] god has almost intentionally allowed the
[1:06:53] date to be shrouded in mystery for a
[1:06:55] reason
[1:06:57] it's almost as if he has allowed it to
[1:06:58] be so inconclusive
[1:07:00] where you can't definitively nail it
[1:07:02] down to where you're not going to make a
[1:07:04] mistake of just idolizing any one
[1:07:06] particular day
[1:07:08] and then building all of your theology
[1:07:09] around it because there's some people
[1:07:10] that say no christ had to be born on
[1:07:13] this day and therefore this is where he
[1:07:15] was when this happened this is where he
[1:07:17] was in that ham then this this has to be
[1:07:19] wrong because that can't be true and
[1:07:21] they start rearranging pieces and then
[1:07:23] they re-modify the entire bible
[1:07:26] in order to make it fit around this
[1:07:27] critical date that christ came that's a
[1:07:30] very critical event but the date begins
[1:07:33] to become preeminent
[1:07:35] and we believe in we know this and my
[1:07:37] wife explained this to me yesterday she
[1:07:39] said all we need is is you say hey all
[1:07:41] we need to know is what brother branham
[1:07:42] taught to know
[1:07:43] to have it like so this in other words
[1:07:45] this could have been covered in one
[1:07:46] quote three weeks ago
[1:07:49] but we know the truth is that christ
[1:07:51] wasn't born on december 25th
[1:07:53] jesus christ wasn't born in the winter
[1:07:56] and we believe that by faith perhaps
[1:07:58] having been taught in the different
[1:07:59] things that we see in the scripture we
[1:08:01] realize there's
[1:08:02] the things that we are pointed to the
[1:08:04] things that are identified we have this
[1:08:05] conviction and believe that christ was
[1:08:07] not born in december he was not born in
[1:08:09] the winter but he would have been born
[1:08:11] in the springtime
[1:08:13] in luke chapter 2 verses 7 and 8 it says
[1:08:15] and she brought forth their firstborn
[1:08:17] son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes
[1:08:19] and laid him in a manger because there
[1:08:22] was no room for them in the end
[1:08:24] now we can
[1:08:26] piggybacking off of whenever christ
[1:08:28] john was born in the service of
[1:08:30] zacharias there's those that can feel
[1:08:32] very confident in a fixing a date in
[1:08:33] april or march as to the time of his
[1:08:36] birth and that this uh this is when he's
[1:08:39] born and then this scripture kind of
[1:08:40] seals it in for him and there were in
[1:08:42] the same country shepherds and notice
[1:08:44] these clues abiding in the field which
[1:08:47] wouldn't be odd but notice this keeping
[1:08:48] watch over their flock by night
[1:08:52] and so it's this scripture that begins
[1:08:54] to kind of ease in and begins to
[1:08:55] identify this time where it's pointing
[1:08:57] to the springtime a time when shepherds
[1:09:00] would not be corralling the sheep during
[1:09:02] the winter and put him in some enclosure
[1:09:04] but it'd be a time when even at night
[1:09:06] they can be out by night with the flocks
[1:09:08] it's in this springtime
[1:09:11] where they're identifying the time when
[1:09:13] lambs would be born this is the season
[1:09:14] this is the time of christ's birth
[1:09:17] and almost as if just to kind of throw
[1:09:19] us off
[1:09:21] that time was from march to the end of
[1:09:23] september in october so
[1:09:25] once again maybe you're not able just to
[1:09:27] drill it down
[1:09:29] but we know we're taught
[1:09:31] that there's significance to the time
[1:09:32] that christ was born
[1:09:35] and this is where i've run out of time
[1:09:38] and so i'm just going to
[1:09:41] move from myths to mystery and leave it
[1:09:43] a mystery maybe
[1:09:44] when i'm one i'm identifying
[1:09:47] but the birth of christ relates to the
[1:09:49] purpose of christ
[1:09:50] right this just isn't a child that was
[1:09:52] born and a a you know a man born of a
[1:09:56] woman is a few days and full of sorrow
[1:09:58] life is but a vapor it's not just it's
[1:10:00] appointed under men wants to die and
[1:10:02] then judgment jesus doesn't fit that
[1:10:04] mold his birth had a particular
[1:10:05] character his birth is associated with
[1:10:08] the character his birth is associated
[1:10:09] with his purpose and this is where to me
[1:10:11] i want to really begin to identify the
[1:10:12] true purpose of christmas what we're
[1:10:14] honoring
[1:10:15] is in his birth it's so closely
[1:10:17] associated with other things it's
[1:10:19] inseparable from it
[1:10:21] you can't isolate his birth and it's
[1:10:23] almost as if the scriptures say no we're
[1:10:25] not going to let you isolate the birth
[1:10:26] now i'm kind of getting into it a little
[1:10:27] bit and i don't mean to but i want just
[1:10:29] to put these things out there notice
[1:10:31] what paul points to he says i preached
[1:10:33] christ in him crucified he pointed to
[1:10:35] christ crucified not christ born
[1:10:37] not christ's birth or something that
[1:10:39] becomes a part of the message of jesus
[1:10:41] christ that's inseparable from him
[1:10:45] but the mythology only focuses on one
[1:10:48] part
[1:10:49] the mythology of this season of this
[1:10:51] time it leaves
[1:10:53] it focuses only on the aspect of his
[1:10:55] birth it leaves out his life it leaves
[1:10:56] out his death it leaves out his burial
[1:10:58] it leaves out his resurrection
[1:11:00] everything is distilled down to this
[1:11:02] this idea of this poor child laying in a
[1:11:04] manger and the cold snowy bethlehem and
[1:11:07] that's the mythology trying to take
[1:11:09] something and divide it down and zero in
[1:11:11] on just one element when you can't
[1:11:13] separate the rest from it
[1:11:16] because god is intentional even with
[1:11:18] this timing and the timing of the birth
[1:11:20] of christ as we believe it to be in the
[1:11:22] springtime it connects with this purpose
[1:11:24] and this is where you begin to move from
[1:11:26] just all the mythology of december 25th
[1:11:28] and all the mythology of pagan
[1:11:29] celebrations in the winter time and how
[1:11:31] we swap the date of conception for the
[1:11:33] the date of birth and we try to get all
[1:11:35] these dates to match up just look at
[1:11:36] what he was born for look at what his
[1:11:38] purpose was and he began to move from
[1:11:40] mythology to mystery
[1:11:43] i mentioned it before the new testament
[1:11:45] in no place doesn't mention the exact
[1:11:47] date of birth of christ or more
[1:11:49] particularly the celebration of it
[1:11:51] there's nowhere in the bible the
[1:11:52] anniversary of his of his birth is
[1:11:54] commemorated as mentioned earlier maybe
[1:11:56] today and even a couple weeks ago the
[1:11:58] earliest christian writings do not
[1:12:00] mention the celebration of christ's
[1:12:01] birth at all
[1:12:03] it wasn't a part of it what they did
[1:12:05] talk about is his death
[1:12:07] well some of them did mention is the
[1:12:08] date that he died but you don't find
[1:12:10] them putting down this hard date of his
[1:12:12] birth
[1:12:14] the scriptures in the old testament
[1:12:16] point forward to his birth
[1:12:18] then once he's born there's no new
[1:12:20] testament scriptures pointing back to a
[1:12:22] commemoration or anniversary or
[1:12:24] celebration of it
[1:12:26] but there is something and i notice this
[1:12:29] let's look at the statement as soon as
[1:12:31] we would see jesus
[1:12:36] i'm going to end with these these
[1:12:37] statements three statements
[1:12:40] sir as we would see jesus look notice
[1:12:41] how
[1:12:42] the bible's not pointing it now notice
[1:12:44] the attitude of jesus christ himself
[1:12:47] now jesus never said
[1:12:49] now he's going to bring them to
[1:12:50] bethlehem
[1:12:52] jesus never said i'm going to bring you
[1:12:53] to bethlehem
[1:12:56] jesus never said to the greeks when they
[1:12:58] come up because this is sirs we would
[1:12:59] see jesus they wanted to see him now
[1:13:01] just a moment if you want to see it i'll
[1:13:03] take you back to bethlehem where i was
[1:13:05] born and i'll tell you how it happened
[1:13:07] back there
[1:13:09] this is he's using a very beautiful
[1:13:11] scripture
[1:13:13] a unique
[1:13:15] uh exchange and using this as this
[1:13:17] christmas text this is on december 24th
[1:13:19] serves we would see jesus and he's using
[1:13:21] this as an example that they wanted to
[1:13:22] see christ he didn't point them to
[1:13:24] bethlehem he said come with me let me
[1:13:26] tell you about my birth let me tell you
[1:13:27] where i was born let me tell you when i
[1:13:28] was born he says it wasn't that this is
[1:13:30] so beautiful he pointed them to a future
[1:13:33] place if they wanted to know him
[1:13:35] if you wanted to know him you had to
[1:13:37] know where he was going to be revealed
[1:13:39] if you wanted to know him you had to
[1:13:40] know the man in which he was going to be
[1:13:41] made known if you want to know me in
[1:13:43] other words i won't take you back and
[1:13:45] tell you when i was born to bethlehem
[1:13:47] and all about that
[1:13:49] not one time did he point any person to
[1:13:51] any creed any denomination or to his
[1:13:54] birth or even to christmas not one time
[1:13:57] did he ever do it
[1:13:59] so even the emphasis of christ was not
[1:14:02] to point back to bethlehem not to point
[1:14:05] back to the time of his birth and not to
[1:14:07] point back that something could be
[1:14:09] commemorated and fellowshipped around
[1:14:10] but he knew that he always was unfolding
[1:14:13] and revealing himself so he had to point
[1:14:15] to a future place if you're gonna know
[1:14:17] me you have to be where i'm being
[1:14:19] revealed
[1:14:20] in the prophecy for your season and the
[1:14:22] prophecy for your time you have to catch
[1:14:24] me in the moment that i'm expressing
[1:14:26] myself to the shepherds in luke chapter
[1:14:28] 2 that's where they found him as a baby
[1:14:31] in the manger but that's not where you
[1:14:33] found him then
[1:14:35] and that where he was then before the
[1:14:37] greeks is not where they would find him
[1:14:38] in revelation
[1:14:41] in a personal relationship
[1:14:44] christ even in the way that brother
[1:14:45] branstad he pointed them to a future
[1:14:46] place they went to him christ was not
[1:14:48] pointing to bethlehem
[1:14:50] he's pointing to a mystery
[1:14:53] all this debate we have on a missing
[1:14:55] birth certificate and even jesus christ
[1:14:59] doesn't have one so obama-like
[1:15:05] think about this here's
[1:15:07] she brought forth her first born son
[1:15:09] wrapped in swan and clothes laid him in
[1:15:10] a major
[1:15:12] and think about just what a sublime
[1:15:14] mystery is expressed in that
[1:15:18] and all the events that start will lead
[1:15:20] up to all the events that begin to
[1:15:21] cascade
[1:15:24] in the whole world and all of judea and
[1:15:27] all the jews and even those shepherds
[1:15:29] were expecting the lion they get a
[1:15:30] little lamb
[1:15:33] and it's it's even to it's even to them
[1:15:37] that would have had no mythology because
[1:15:39] think about the jews were the only
[1:15:40] non-pagans
[1:15:42] right the jews were the only
[1:15:44] non-heathens
[1:15:46] everyone else was a gentile everyone
[1:15:47] else was a pagan everyone else was idol
[1:15:49] worship no one else worshiped the one
[1:15:50] true god they were the only ones that
[1:15:52] had it right
[1:15:55] and they would have been the ones that
[1:15:56] would have known the signs and the
[1:15:58] seasons and what was prophesied and they
[1:16:00] would have understood even the
[1:16:02] symbolisms and the date different dates
[1:16:04] and births of the patriarchs it seems as
[1:16:06] if they would have known exactly what
[1:16:08] was going to happen and what would come
[1:16:09] to be they would have been the ones that
[1:16:10] would have been expecting in waiting but
[1:16:12] yet when he came he came in such a
[1:16:14] mysterious way
[1:16:19] that they missed it
[1:16:22] and i want to say this
[1:16:23] it's amazing
[1:16:25] that it's i i want to preserve some of
[1:16:28] this but it's just so important to see
[1:16:29] this it's amazing how easy it is for
[1:16:32] some people
[1:16:33] to go back to that
[1:16:37] think about it really easy to worship a
[1:16:39] baby wrapped in swallowing clothes in a
[1:16:41] manger isn't it
[1:16:44] a baby can't tell me what to do
[1:16:46] so sweet
[1:16:47] so innocent
[1:16:49] they can worship a baby jesus laying in
[1:16:51] the manger but christ wasn't pointing
[1:16:53] them to that
[1:16:56] again in sirs we would see jesus notice
[1:16:58] this as we're going to close on these
[1:16:59] two statements
[1:17:00] i want to thank you for your patience
[1:17:03] i i know if anything what you've done is
[1:17:04] you've been very patient with me is i've
[1:17:06] worked out something maybe for myself
[1:17:09] and if that's all it was
[1:17:11] i i guess i could apologize but i just
[1:17:13] say thank you for bearing with me it was
[1:17:16] important as a burden i had to look into
[1:17:18] these things i had to identify these
[1:17:19] things i felt god driving me to mention
[1:17:22] these things and get them into the
[1:17:23] conversation and let them be a part of
[1:17:25] our fellowship and let us be honest
[1:17:26] about them and and kind of put it all on
[1:17:28] the table different people use it for
[1:17:30] different reasons and i know there's
[1:17:31] some of you but hey you know what let's
[1:17:33] just wait till the new year is over and
[1:17:35] we'll come back to church so that we
[1:17:36] don't have to worry about all this and
[1:17:37] then today i'm going to preach on
[1:17:38] valentine's day
[1:17:40] no um there's just different things that
[1:17:42] i felt really impressed my heart that
[1:17:44] the holy spirit wanted me to address and
[1:17:46] i thank you for your patience i know
[1:17:47] you've been very very patient and kind
[1:17:50] very very gracious to me and now just
[1:17:52] listen to what brother batman has to say
[1:17:53] about this because i feel like in some
[1:17:54] ways
[1:17:55] i'm just wanting to close the door on
[1:17:57] the mythology
[1:17:59] and focus on what we can going forward
[1:18:02] on same details same scriptures same
[1:18:04] elements different things but how they
[1:18:05] relate to these things that brother
[1:18:07] branham begins to identify but notice
[1:18:08] what he says in service we would see
[1:18:09] jesus this is at the very beginning i
[1:18:11] think page two paragraph six i do not
[1:18:13] believe jesus would care what day you
[1:18:15] worshipped his birthday on
[1:18:18] if it was the 25th 26th or whether it's
[1:18:20] april may june july or whenever it might
[1:18:23] be i do not think jesus would care what
[1:18:26] day you worshipped his birthday on 25th
[1:18:29] 26th whatever april may june july august
[1:18:32] you name it he's saying it doesn't
[1:18:34] matter he says just he says and notice
[1:18:36] this is so beautiful just so you worship
[1:18:38] him on any day now notice when you read
[1:18:40] that maybe you can read it two different
[1:18:41] ways
[1:18:42] he doesn't believe that jesus would care
[1:18:44] what day you would worship him so that
[1:18:46] you would just worship him on any day in
[1:18:47] other words he doesn't want it just to
[1:18:49] be on march 25th
[1:18:52] that you worship his birthday
[1:18:54] because that's carving out a piece
[1:18:56] that's separating out a component that's
[1:18:59] becoming hyper focused on one particular
[1:19:01] element that if you drill down on too
[1:19:02] much and get very very defensive of it
[1:19:04] you begin to try to bolster your
[1:19:06] conviction with other things that begin
[1:19:08] to cloud the picture and you have to
[1:19:10] carve out a lot of other stuff and you
[1:19:11] no longer have christ you have the
[1:19:14] christ child in a manger
[1:19:17] that you're worshiping he says just so
[1:19:19] that you would worship him on any day
[1:19:20] jesus wouldn't want you just to fix one
[1:19:23] particular day to his date of birth so
[1:19:24] that you worshipped him on that day he
[1:19:26] says but here's what it is they've taken
[1:19:28] the sacredness from christmas to make it
[1:19:31] not a christmas
[1:19:33] if anything maybe happy holidays is more
[1:19:35] appropriate
[1:19:37] those are my words if someone's just
[1:19:39] listening this is not part of the quote
[1:19:40] he says they've taken a sacredness from
[1:19:42] christmas to make it not a christmas but
[1:19:44] a worship day not a worship day maybe
[1:19:46] but a celebration
[1:19:47] you hear people saying we're going to
[1:19:49] celebrate christmas that's wrong brother
[1:19:51] aaron i thought you said brother brandt
[1:19:52] told us not to celebrate christmas or
[1:19:54] didn't tell us not to do it he's just
[1:19:55] saying it's wrong to celebrate
[1:19:58] but in this way we should never
[1:19:59] celebrate christmas
[1:20:01] christmas is a day of worship not a
[1:20:03] celebration
[1:20:04] what perspective
[1:20:06] in what it's become
[1:20:08] and what it would have originally been
[1:20:11] or even if at all if we would have
[1:20:13] recognized some day that we believed
[1:20:16] christ was born there'd be some respect
[1:20:18] for it there'd be some honoring
[1:20:21] some activity some service some some in
[1:20:23] our hearts contemplation just as others
[1:20:25] do the jews do around certain feast days
[1:20:27] just as we do on on the resurrection uh
[1:20:30] the annual commemoration of the
[1:20:32] resurrection it's a day of worship and
[1:20:34] in recognition that on this day christ
[1:20:36] raised from the dead and there's certain
[1:20:38] things that are supposed to be
[1:20:39] reverential but what did it become it's
[1:20:41] become flowers on the altar it's become
[1:20:44] pastels and the easter bunny and easter
[1:20:46] eggs and painted eggs and all these
[1:20:47] different things and it's losing its
[1:20:49] meaning though it stayed on the same
[1:20:50] date
[1:20:51] and he's identifying the same thing we
[1:20:53] should never celebrate christmas but we
[1:20:54] should worship
[1:20:56] it should be a time of worship not just
[1:20:58] because a baby was born but what it
[1:21:00] represented
[1:21:02] and then this one musicians if you could
[1:21:04] please come
[1:21:06] in the message god's gifts always find
[1:21:09] their places
[1:21:10] he says christianity was accepted in
[1:21:12] their way in rome then they said even
[1:21:14] prior statements are saying that there
[1:21:15] came a time when christianity was
[1:21:17] embraced and it's kind of in rome and it
[1:21:19] begins to accept be expect expect
[1:21:21] accepted
[1:21:22] accepted
[1:21:24] received in pagan rome
[1:21:27] and now it becomes this blending right
[1:21:30] of the government with this
[1:21:32] ecclesiastical power with government
[1:21:33] power it says then they said we'll make
[1:21:35] the same celebration and make the son of
[1:21:37] god's birthday the sun god s you in god
[1:21:40] jupiter's birthday the son of god's
[1:21:41] birthday the 25th of december and then
[1:21:44] this statement but what difference does
[1:21:45] it make
[1:21:48] even if that's true
[1:21:49] what difference does it make
[1:21:51] but what difference does it make even if
[1:21:52] they was doing it in july or august or
[1:21:55] whenever it might be
[1:21:57] it's still the sacredness of remembering
[1:22:00] that god gave us the hope that we have
[1:22:02] in us
[1:22:04] and now you say well the rest of them is
[1:22:05] all santa claus and going on like they
[1:22:07] do why we just might as well do it no
[1:22:09] sir
[1:22:11] no this is not a pagan celebration to us
[1:22:15] this is a sacred hour
[1:22:18] so that's what really christmas means to
[1:22:19] us it's not a pagan celebration
[1:22:22] if you're participating in secular
[1:22:24] traditions just remember this
[1:22:26] it's
[1:22:27] the tree is not a symbol of jesus christ
[1:22:30] he has not gained more
[1:22:32] preeminence in your family life by
[1:22:35] putting up a tree
[1:22:38] the token has not been applied
[1:22:41] by erecting a christmas tree
[1:22:44] and decorating it
[1:22:46] all these secular traditions we could
[1:22:48] call them pagan things that have been
[1:22:49] blended into it i don't mean to change
[1:22:50] the language but i really want to
[1:22:51] identify that as things have become
[1:22:53] secularized
[1:22:55] it's something else something different
[1:22:57] altogether
[1:22:59] but at the same time in these moments
[1:23:01] he's saying there should be something
[1:23:02] sacred to us there is a sacred christmas
[1:23:05] deal
[1:23:06] there's a secular christmas and there's
[1:23:08] a sacred christmas
[1:23:09] as he said it's not even a christmas at
[1:23:11] all he says they've taken christmas out
[1:23:13] of christmas he's using this language
[1:23:14] say it's changed it's not the way it
[1:23:15] used to be they've completely taken out
[1:23:17] of it
[1:23:18] [Music]
[1:23:19] he said we try to make so much about
[1:23:20] this day he says i don't know that jesus
[1:23:22] would even care jesus would even care
[1:23:24] what day it was because it would just be
[1:23:25] some day that you would worship him on
[1:23:27] that's not the focus and he says what
[1:23:29] difference does it make december 25th or
[1:23:32] july 8th or august 15th or whatever it
[1:23:35] might be what difference does it makes
[1:23:37] that make if this is the time then it's
[1:23:39] something sacred if this is the time
[1:23:41] we're remembering it he says
[1:23:44] and he makes this beautiful statement if
[1:23:46] there'd been no christmas there'd be no
[1:23:47] resurrection
[1:23:49] there'd been no christmas there'd been
[1:23:51] no love there'd been no peace there'd be
[1:23:53] no hereafter for the believer if there'd
[1:23:55] been
[1:23:56] no christmas
[1:23:58] christmas was just the start
[1:24:00] the birth of a baby in a manger was the
[1:24:02] beginning of something
[1:24:04] that cannot just be satisfactorily
[1:24:06] summed up
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:09] all tied wrapped up with a bow on it say
[1:24:11] here it is the neat beautiful christmas
[1:24:13] package
[1:24:15] year one
[1:24:16] or one bc
[1:24:18] september 11th
[1:24:20] or december 25th in 3ad
[1:24:24] or however you'd want to put it it's not
[1:24:26] something you're going to be able to
[1:24:27] just wrap up real neat and tidy and
[1:24:29] pretty and say this is the date
[1:24:33] what because
[1:24:34] that would be
[1:24:37] narrowing it down way too much
[1:24:40] because we don't even just worship the
[1:24:41] resurrection
[1:24:43] right
[1:24:45] we just don't venerate ourselves before
[1:24:46] an empty tomb
[1:24:48] we don't make pilgrimages to an upper
[1:24:50] room some mecca in jerusalem on the
[1:24:53] anniversary of pentecost
[1:24:55] right
[1:24:56] we're not giving ourselves over to dates
[1:24:58] and anniversaries and these different
[1:24:59] things there's people that give
[1:25:00] themselves so over to dates and
[1:25:02] anniversaries that they even in the
[1:25:04] message worship according to a calendar
[1:25:08] very structured very rigid you're going
[1:25:10] to do this on this day you're going to
[1:25:12] do this on this day you're going to do
[1:25:13] this together you're going to listen to
[1:25:14] this you're going to do that and
[1:25:15] everything's according to they have our
[1:25:16] own message advent calendars
[1:25:19] where everything's already determined
[1:25:20] beforehand
[1:25:22] and god didn't want god didn't want to
[1:25:24] distill it down to something that is
[1:25:26] backward looking
[1:25:28] he wants us even today if we're going to
[1:25:30] know him we have to know where he's
[1:25:32] revealing himself today
[1:25:34] to a place where he was going to be
[1:25:37] let's stand
[1:25:41] thank you so much
[1:25:42] again i mean that sincerely thank you
[1:25:47] from myths to mystery
[1:25:50] i want to get into it more
[1:25:52] of what jesus christ pointed us to and
[1:25:53] if you're listening to these sermons any
[1:25:55] of those ones i just read if you listen
[1:25:56] to either one of those you'll find what
[1:25:58] christ was pointing us to
[1:26:01] let's bow our heads heavenly father
[1:26:04] there's a wonderful presence that's
[1:26:05] amongst us
[1:26:07] and i know that it's very tedious
[1:26:09] to take time to instruct to teach
[1:26:12] [Music]
[1:26:13] to bring in historical references
[1:26:17] to even in with an audience lord conduct
[1:26:19] an exercise
[1:26:20] or share my experience with an exercise
[1:26:23] that tries to piece together dates and
[1:26:25] months and times
[1:26:26] [Music]
[1:26:32] and lord i
[1:26:34] accept that
[1:26:35] both manner and matter could be
[1:26:38] lacking
[1:26:42] i accept that there's a way in which
[1:26:44] i've expressed it could cause the people
[1:26:46] to always feel kind of shifting is this
[1:26:50] is this the the platitude is this the
[1:26:52] point oh no it's again it's just more
[1:26:55] confusion but lord my
[1:26:57] my desire is to
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:00] walk a straight line even though it may
[1:27:01] seem i'm
[1:27:03] bouncing back and forth
[1:27:06] [Music]
[1:27:07] and lord the more i have
[1:27:10] studied the message of the hour on this
[1:27:12] subject the more that i've looked into
[1:27:13] it historically and scripturally
[1:27:18] more than ever i believe it's
[1:27:21] it would be right
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:23] that we have a sacred christmas
[1:27:27] as a church as a family
[1:27:30] to be some purposeful
[1:27:34] recognition of your birth
[1:27:37] some personal
[1:27:39] and intimate
[1:27:42] worship
[1:27:44] of you
[1:27:46] not as a baby
[1:27:48] but in the true spirit of what christmas
[1:27:49] means
[1:27:51] not as a baby
[1:27:54] but in the true meaning of and truth of
[1:27:56] it
[1:27:58] lord may we be inspired i think about it
[1:28:00] lord that there's so much frolic and
[1:28:01] frivolity and even other religious
[1:28:04] celebrations
[1:28:06] during this time
[1:28:07] lord we should be so careful that we
[1:28:09] don't convey the wrong message
[1:28:12] because if there are those seeking you
[1:28:14] today
[1:28:15] wanting to find you
[1:28:18] may we not be so
[1:28:19] scrooge or grinch lord to the season
[1:28:22] that we don't we ba humbug it and we we
[1:28:25] believe it's so pagan we just
[1:28:27] close our lips and don't want to say
[1:28:28] anything about it to acknowledge it that
[1:28:31] we miss an opportunity
[1:28:33] to not point people to bethlehem
[1:28:37] but point you to your house today where
[1:28:39] we are being fed
[1:28:41] to be able to point you today where you
[1:28:43] are revealing yourself to be able to
[1:28:44] point you to in this hour not the birth
[1:28:47] of a baby but the
[1:28:49] birth of the word
[1:28:52] and the manifestation of things so
[1:28:54] beautiful
[1:28:56] i pray lord you bless your people i know
[1:28:58] that they've been very
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:00] patient and exhibit a lot of grace and i
[1:29:02] pray that you bless them for it
[1:29:04] be with the ministers lord brother chris
[1:29:06] brother manuel minister
[1:29:08] different families traveling and out
[1:29:10] lord i know not anyone's sick right now
[1:29:12] lord i just thank you that we're in good
[1:29:14] health continue to protect us lord i
[1:29:16] pray only by your grace that we remain
[1:29:18] healthy
[1:29:19] we know it alone lord no matter what
[1:29:22] watching we do we know it's by your
[1:29:23] grace that you've preserved us i pray
[1:29:25] that you do so for this holiday season
[1:29:27] we ask these things in the lord jesus
[1:29:29] christ amen
[1:29:32] amen amen
