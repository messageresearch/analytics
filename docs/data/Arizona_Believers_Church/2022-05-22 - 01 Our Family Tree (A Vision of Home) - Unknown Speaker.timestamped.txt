[0:00] um i think it's working a little bit
[0:01] there's just a few slides i want to take
[0:02] control of here in a little bit but
[0:03] let's start in power of transformation
[0:05] i'm gonna use this as my foundational uh
[0:08] statement to you today
[0:10] and i'm gonna be drawing from this and
[0:12] we'll give you our title here in a
[0:14] moment so if you have that place in your
[0:16] notes just hold steady
[0:18] and
[0:19] i want to focus on a number of
[0:21] statements in this because this is uh
[0:24] you know kind of like a part of the
[0:26] foundation and the structure
[0:27] says now we find everything in order he
[0:30] spoke speaking about in the garden of
[0:31] eden what we read in revelations chapter
[0:33] 22
[0:34] parallels the descriptions of the garden
[0:36] of eden it says now we find everything
[0:38] in order that's a key phrase there
[0:40] everything in order god spoke it and he
[0:41] said let there be let there be and let
[0:43] there be an eden let there be beautiful
[0:46] flowers let there be my son in my own
[0:48] image stand over there in the garden of
[0:51] eden and let his bride stand by his side
[0:53] that's kind of the quotation or summary
[0:55] of what god was speaking he says oh how
[0:57] beautiful what that was
[0:59] and the father he was a father
[1:02] and so there come his own children
[1:04] coming forth son and daughter of god
[1:06] he's a father his own children coming
[1:08] forth and if you want to
[1:11] listen to uh power of transformation
[1:13] god's power to transform there's a lot
[1:15] of themes in that that fit with this
[1:17] and he says
[1:19] and he made a paradise for them and he
[1:22] and he's connecting this to his office
[1:24] as a father he says god loves to do
[1:26] things for his children loving to do
[1:29] something for his children placing his
[1:31] son and his daughter there all his own
[1:34] children coming forth he says he made a
[1:36] paradise for them god loves to do things
[1:39] for his children don't you remember you
[1:41] mothers how no matter how if you had an
[1:43] allowance the had to allowance the table
[1:45] if junior needs a good pair of shoes
[1:47] that he liked you'd do it he's saying
[1:49] that this is what motherhood does if you
[1:51] needed to sell something in order to get
[1:52] your children something they needed you
[1:54] would do it whatever it was to do
[1:56] something for your children
[1:58] dad how you'd work a little harder to
[2:00] get something for the children is that
[2:02] not true
[2:04] i tell my kids whenever they come into
[2:06] my office which is my room which is my
[2:08] everything it's that's where i i never
[2:10] leave that room uh pray for me and um
[2:15] kids will come in and they'll and
[2:16] they'll ask me a question and i'll say
[2:18] i'm working to buy you toys
[2:20] and and
[2:21] and they're wondering where the toys are
[2:24] but but you work you work to get things
[2:26] for your children and if you need to
[2:28] work a little extra hard um to get them
[2:30] something uh you would do it and i think
[2:32] that's the heart of a parent that's the
[2:34] heart of a father
[2:35] and he says well that just shows that we
[2:37] are way down here a parent which reminds
[2:40] me of the dad joke i told in south
[2:42] carolina that ellie appreciated is when
[2:43] does a joke become a dad joke
[2:45] when it becomes apparent
[2:47] says he says that
[2:48] shows that we are way down here a parent
[2:52] and he says he is the extreme parent
[2:56] and how much more so that parallel even
[2:58] jesus saying if you ask your father uh
[3:00] for an egg will give you a serpent if
[3:02] you ask him for bread would he give you
[3:03] a stone how much more your heavenly
[3:04] father so brother brahms drawn this
[3:06] parallel that god is the ultimate parent
[3:09] he is the source of all parenthood
[3:11] and that just as we would do things for
[3:13] our own children god
[3:15] he's extreme
[3:17] he's the extreme parent he's the uber
[3:19] parent he's a supreme parent he's he's
[3:21] above and beyond what we are as parents
[3:23] so if there's some way that we can
[3:25] relate to the desires that we have in
[3:27] our heart and how we might treat our own
[3:29] children and how we would do everything
[3:30] we can to prepare for them he's saying
[3:32] he is the extreme parent
[3:35] now with that idea of god as the extreme
[3:39] parent creating a paradise
[3:41] i want to say this this is our journey
[3:44] today is going to be very vast it's a
[3:45] very vast and detailed journey and i'm
[3:48] wanting to lay a foundation for a series
[3:51] that i want to start called our family
[3:53] tree
[3:54] and that's going to be the series is our
[3:56] family tree and today my subtitle is a
[3:59] vision of home
[4:01] and so the series is going to be on our
[4:03] family tree and you can just begin to
[4:05] ponder that and realize just how rich
[4:07] this subject can be today i'm calling it
[4:10] a vision of home god dealt with me very
[4:13] very deeply over the last week and a
[4:15] half or so on some things
[4:17] and i was
[4:19] and i'm going to be very personal today
[4:21] to the church and god
[4:23] began to impress upon me certain things
[4:25] and i wanted to revisit the vision for
[4:28] this church today so part of this sermon
[4:30] is just revisiting the vision that we
[4:32] have as a church
[4:33] now as i as i do that i want you to
[4:35] recognize and i'm going to go through
[4:37] the scriptures just to make this
[4:38] connection
[4:39] that when i say a vision for this church
[4:41] i'm talking about this local church
[4:43] called arizona believer's church there's
[4:44] those that are members of this church by
[4:47] your attendance and by your service and
[4:48] by your giving
[4:50] and so we are i want to articulate again
[4:53] the vision for this church but at the
[4:56] same time
[4:57] it's not just a vision that relates to
[5:00] you know a corporate policy or method of
[5:02] operation or standard operating
[5:04] procedures procedures or what our
[5:06] purpose is this is our mission statement
[5:08] i'm not giving a mission statement just
[5:10] of the church but it will also in type
[5:13] show a vision for the family
[5:16] for your family and not only in tight
[5:18] but there's a direct connection to your
[5:20] family
[5:21] there is this is something something
[5:23] beautiful about church is it's not just
[5:25] something that the parents do as a hobby
[5:27] but it's something that all can be
[5:29] included in and benefit from
[5:31] so in this series one of my themes is
[5:34] going to be showing that parallel
[5:35] between the church even the local church
[5:37] even the body of christ and the family
[5:39] and how these things relate among each
[5:41] of the parts
[5:42] now a vision is the state of being able
[5:44] to see our vision is the state of being
[5:46] able to see all of us i see today are
[5:48] cited we can see some better than others
[5:51] but that's the being able to see or to
[5:53] have a vision would be the ability to
[5:56] think about or plan the future with
[5:58] wisdom now we're not doing it with
[6:00] imagination but to have a vision is to
[6:02] kind of be forward-looking and to be
[6:04] proactive and think about things a goal
[6:06] that you're trying to achieve or
[6:07] something that you're trying to
[6:09] accomplish and so what you do is you
[6:11] think about what you want to accomplish
[6:13] and then you use wisdom well you use
[6:14] wisdom about what you want to accomplish
[6:16] and then you use wisdom to plan what is
[6:18] it going to take to get me there if we
[6:20] use inversion we might say what's going
[6:22] to keep me from getting there and you
[6:24] use that wisdom to kind of figure out
[6:27] this is what we want to achieve this is
[6:28] what we want to accomplish
[6:30] and so when we say a vision of the
[6:32] church
[6:33] this is what we purpose to do what we
[6:36] plan to do what our desire is our goal
[6:38] is as a church now a part of that again
[6:41] is i want to express the vision of the
[6:42] church but i want you to recognize and
[6:44] we'll get this in very detailed that it
[6:46] specifically relates to the vision that
[6:48] we would have for family and the vision
[6:50] that you can have for your family and
[6:52] then ultimately what i want to do this
[6:53] morning and i'll say it now i want to
[6:55] emphasize christ and i want to emphasize
[6:58] our ultimate destiny
[7:00] because that's the only way we can have
[7:02] a vision is christ is the central part
[7:04] of that the central theme of that and
[7:06] that it's for an ultimate purpose of
[7:07] being in eternity because church is not
[7:10] for um providing access to people for
[7:13] multi-level marketing schemes um it's
[7:16] not just a place to provide babysitters
[7:18] for our kids
[7:20] uh a church has a an eternal purpose
[7:22] even the local church has a vision to
[7:25] the eternal purpose and that must always
[7:26] be in the forefront of our thoughts
[7:29] now if you'll turn to ephesians chapter
[7:31] 3
[7:32] verses 14 to 19.
[7:35] i'd like to introduce
[7:37] and i'm not they're kind of independent
[7:40] i want to use i want to be able to set
[7:41] them apart as independent but obviously
[7:44] i'm wanting to connect them but
[7:45] introduce
[7:46] the family tree or a family tree
[7:49] and then church what what the church's
[7:51] local church is
[7:53] and and even by extension the body of
[7:55] christ but just kind of introduce these
[7:57] themes and in this scripture it kind of
[7:59] marries them together ephesians chapter
[8:01] 3 verses 14 to 19 it says for this cause
[8:04] i bow my knees unto the father of our
[8:06] lord jesus christ of whom the whole
[8:09] family in heaven and earth is named so
[8:12] now there's a family and there's a
[8:14] family name and it's relating to a
[8:16] heavenly family an earthly family and so
[8:19] we're getting the concept paul is
[8:20] looking at a family he says that he
[8:22] would grant you christ now or he bows
[8:25] unto the father
[8:26] that he would grant you according to the
[8:28] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[8:31] with my by his spirit in the inner man
[8:34] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[8:37] faith now that's the number one and that
[8:40] can only be by faith and which the seal
[8:42] of your faith is the baptism of the holy
[8:44] ghost
[8:46] this is his prayer this is what he bows
[8:48] his knees to pray that christ may dwell
[8:50] in your hearts by faith
[8:52] that ye and now this phrase is inserted
[8:54] here being rooted and grounded in love
[8:56] so you can say being rooted and grounded
[8:58] in love that ye and this is the purpose
[9:01] now
[9:03] of the indwelling and the rooting and
[9:05] grounding that we may be able to
[9:08] comprehend with all saints what is the
[9:10] breadth and length and depth and height
[9:13] and to know the love of christ which
[9:15] passeth knowledge that ye might be
[9:17] filled with all the fullness of god
[9:19] now that's a mouthful i think maybe some
[9:22] of the homeschool groups should have
[9:23] this sentence be diagrammed by the
[9:25] homeschoolers
[9:26] just to see how all these parts are
[9:28] connected and which ones are modifying
[9:29] which but he's saying the purpose of
[9:31] christ dwelling in our hearts the
[9:33] purpose of us being rooted and grounded
[9:35] in love is that we could comprehend and
[9:38] that not just individually but all of us
[9:40] collectively when he gets into ephesians
[9:42] 4 the vision of that fivefold ministry
[9:44] that we reference is to do this exactly
[9:47] this that we would all comprehend
[9:49] comprehension is a part of this
[9:50] discernment is a part of this knowledge
[9:52] and understanding and wisdom is a part
[9:54] of this not just saying i believe and it
[9:56] really just being kind of a mental
[9:58] laziness
[9:59] but it's a real faith that dwells in our
[10:02] heart that's in our hearts of christ
[10:04] doing our hearts by faith comprehend the
[10:06] breath length depth and height that's a
[10:08] that's a 3d revelation
[10:11] this is something that's uh full and to
[10:13] know the love of christ which passeth
[10:15] knowledge that you might be filled with
[10:17] all the fullness of god this is the
[10:18] purpose of the indwelling this is the
[10:20] purpose of being rooted and grounded
[10:22] and so he says that
[10:24] the whole family in heaven and earth is
[10:26] named and then we christ dwelling in our
[10:28] hearts by faith makes us part of that
[10:30] family here on earth and he says that we
[10:33] ought to be rooted and grounded he's
[10:34] using an agricultural term and then even
[10:37] a um an architectural term and i just
[10:39] want to focus on the rooted part which
[10:41] was in agriculture but he's saying that
[10:44] you had been rooted the word is
[10:46] expressing that we would be as a tree
[10:48] whose roots go deep
[10:50] and not only are these roots going deep
[10:52] but they spread out far
[10:55] this is what he would like us to be able
[10:56] to do is he's like us to be rooted which
[10:59] means we are trees he's likening us to
[11:01] trees that are planted in the soil of
[11:03] love
[11:04] being rooted in love that means i'm
[11:06] going to have my roots very very deep in
[11:09] love and it's going to be spread out in
[11:11] love and that's the goal of me being
[11:13] planted in this love
[11:15] and in love having been predestinated
[11:17] that in this soil of love there's going
[11:19] to be some sort of nurturing that christ
[11:21] dwelling in my heart then i begin to
[11:23] comprehend what is the breath
[11:26] this is the largeness of it then the
[11:28] length and depth and height it's even
[11:31] expressing architecturally a building
[11:34] but then also agriculturally the plant
[11:37] that the roots would grow deep and
[11:39] spread out and then the the tree would
[11:41] grow up
[11:42] and these are the this is an image being
[11:44] expressed in the way that paul
[11:46] uh
[11:46] lays these things out so we are to be
[11:48] weird to be as trees
[11:51] in numbers chapter 24 verse 6 balaam is
[11:53] referring to
[11:55] israel and forgive me for quoting
[11:58] balaam but this is uh this is true what
[12:00] he has to say
[12:02] and uh
[12:04] brother balaam
[12:06] and
[12:07] i i mentioned merle haggard in the
[12:08] meetings in south carolina and nobody
[12:10] had a clue who i was talking about
[12:13] and numbers 2014 that's going to get
[12:14] everybody we need to look this up
[12:15] where's this thing archived
[12:18] in numbers 24 6 it says as the valleys
[12:21] are they speaking of israel spread forth
[12:24] so now he's wanting to imagine israel as
[12:26] valleys they're spread forth as gardens
[12:28] by the riverside so now israel is as a
[12:30] garden as the trees of ling alois
[12:33] aloes which the lord hath planted so now
[12:36] they're like these aloe trees trees that
[12:38] ling aloes and uh they are there's a
[12:42] maybe an image that we could provide
[12:43] with respect to that but he's likening
[12:45] israel to be in a tree here and as cedar
[12:47] trees besides the waters so he's
[12:50] describing israel as spread out as trees
[12:53] and just as israel in the natural um
[12:57] balaam could describe them we are
[12:59] spiritually as the body of christ as
[13:01] trees spread out over the earth rooted
[13:03] in love growing as cedar trees as laying
[13:05] aloes
[13:06] that the lord have planted we are the
[13:08] planting of the lord you are his
[13:10] vineyard
[13:11] and you see that symmetry maybe in other
[13:13] parts of the scripture you're his
[13:14] husbandry you're his vineyard
[13:16] agricultural reference but then also
[13:17] year god's buildings and what you
[13:20] recognize and i think this is maybe an
[13:22] important point to make that the bible's
[13:24] using types for us to kind of begin to
[13:26] comprehend just how full our literal
[13:28] relationship is with god
[13:30] and what we are to him it's not like
[13:32] well you got to choose one you can't be
[13:33] a building and a tree you have to be a
[13:35] tree cut down and turn into wood to be a
[13:36] building we're not getting legalistic
[13:38] with it these are just ways of trying to
[13:40] understand relationship you are a
[13:42] daughter of god and the bride of christ
[13:44] you are the church you are his body you
[13:46] are his building you are the trees you
[13:48] are the
[13:49] the fullness of him that filleth all in
[13:50] all these are ways just to get us to
[13:52] comprehend
[13:54] what we are in christ
[13:56] and so paul he says the whole family in
[13:57] heaven and earth is named after jesus
[14:00] christ and he says we ought to be rooted
[14:02] so i'm looking at this scripture and
[14:03] saying paul especially in the
[14:04] description of the breath length depth
[14:06] and height we are likened to trees
[14:09] and a family of trees
[14:11] in one sense we could say that we are a
[14:12] family of trees but i want to take it a
[14:15] step further since i'm preaching on our
[14:17] family tree i'd like to say we are a
[14:19] family of one tree
[14:22] a family of one tree
[14:24] we might just need to elevate that usb
[14:27] um
[14:28] dongle there but uh i'll just be more
[14:31] precise
[14:32] um if danielle won't get in my way i'll
[14:34] be able to i'll be able to catch that
[14:37] but i i this is these are a quaking
[14:40] aspens picture of them
[14:42] but it's a picture of what's called the
[14:43] pando
[14:45] which is the word means to spread out
[14:47] and these are very beautiful trees the
[14:49] very very striking images
[14:51] of this but it's a particular forest in
[14:54] utah it covers 107 acres
[14:57] with 47 000 different trees it's the
[15:01] world's and they call it the world's
[15:03] largest living organism
[15:06] and notice i was singular
[15:09] because these quaking aspen stem from a
[15:11] single root system
[15:15] and so they these 47 000 trees
[15:19] are genetically identical
[15:21] that's why they call it the world's
[15:22] largest living organism so we look at
[15:26] the trees
[15:27] i know there's a phrase you can't see
[15:28] the forest for the trees
[15:30] i had a similar i had a situation here
[15:32] recently where i couldn't see the forest
[15:34] for the trees i was so narrowly focused
[15:36] on the trees that i wasn't seeing the
[15:38] bigger picture and so here we look at
[15:40] this and we would think oh these are a
[15:41] series of trees 107 acres spread out in
[15:44] utah and over
[15:46] approximately 47 000 different trees and
[15:49] we would think each tree
[15:50] has come from a seed and that it's grown
[15:53] up from the ground and it has its own
[15:54] roots that are spread out going deep
[15:56] spreading out it grows up and i'm a tree
[15:58] i'm a tree i'm a tree in this forest i'm
[16:00] part of the pando but it's actually 47
[16:03] 000 genetically identical come on
[16:06] somebody shout right
[16:08] uh genetically identical trees that all
[16:11] stem from a single root
[16:15] and this is i think i pulled this from a
[16:18] foundation's website that seeks to
[16:19] preserve the pando not the panda
[16:23] pando there's enough of that panda
[16:25] preservation
[16:26] it's the pando that we're worried about
[16:29] it says above ground pando appears to be
[16:31] a grove of identity of individual trees
[16:34] like any other grove and they call it a
[16:35] grove
[16:37] technically it is pando appears to be a
[16:38] grove of individual trees like any other
[16:40] grove it was overlooked for years
[16:43] but underground
[16:46] everything is connected by a single
[16:48] and vast root system it is one tree
[16:53] h one
[16:54] tree
[16:55] forest
[16:56] not beautiful
[16:58] and and we could look at this church
[17:00] right now and say oh these are all just
[17:02] individual families coming from tucson
[17:04] and flagstaff and prescott and driving
[17:05] from all over the valley these are just
[17:07] all individual families that may be what
[17:09] it looks like on the surface but
[17:10] underneath we are all one tree
[17:15] we've partaken one bread we're part of
[17:17] one family a one tree forest that
[17:19] somebody should make a make a bumper
[17:21] sticker for the church no don't no
[17:23] but it's a it's a one tree
[17:26] this is not a gathering of people at an
[17:28] event where we all kind of show up for
[17:30] the event and then disperse and there's
[17:32] really no more connection beyond the
[17:34] event and so i want you to remember this
[17:36] image of the the pando forest
[17:40] this grove of over 107 acres the single
[17:43] the world's largest living organism in
[17:45] terms of the size i think they found
[17:47] some that it's weird how they uh
[17:49] quantify this but there's a humongous
[17:51] fungus
[17:53] in oregon that i believe has a different
[17:55] category of large in terms of maybe how
[17:57] heavy it is or how it's spread out i
[17:59] don't know but we are not the humongous
[18:00] fungus
[18:02] for every type there's an antitype
[18:04] whatever whatever god does satan
[18:06] perverts and so we are not a church of
[18:08] the humongous fungus we are the church
[18:10] of the one tree
[18:14] and the pastor's humongous
[18:18] and this uh
[18:20] of the
[18:21] humongous fungus church
[18:24] but so now i want you to remember this
[18:26] image because i'm going to be moving on
[18:27] from this like i said i've got a vast i
[18:29] didn't say long just vast journey i want
[18:31] to take you on today very very detailed
[18:33] so i want you to remember this and i'm
[18:35] wanting the image this our family tree
[18:37] and church and family even our own homes
[18:40] to be connected together
[18:41] now trees are ubiquitous they're
[18:43] everywhere
[18:44] so this is not just a concordant search
[18:47] for trees
[18:48] this is not just a message search for
[18:50] trees
[18:51] and i don't want anybody to be like
[18:53] oh my goodness
[18:54] i saw a tree on the way to church today
[18:58] there's trees everywhere
[19:00] so we can't just all of a sudden start
[19:02] to whisper to you over and over again
[19:03] trees
[19:04] and you're going to get some sort of
[19:05] revelation because they're ubiquitous
[19:06] they're everywhere
[19:08] but there's a there's a revelation that
[19:10] we could catch about the tree the image
[19:12] of the tree and even what paul is
[19:13] talking about here that will benefit us
[19:16] beyond just trying to have scratch the
[19:18] itch in our ears to hear something ooh
[19:20] that was deep or that was amazing so i
[19:23] really want you to focus this because
[19:24] this is not just me searching for trees
[19:27] in the bible and the message and then
[19:28] regurgitating it to you
[19:30] now vision for church is a vision
[19:34] or i say my heart but any local church
[19:38] that would have a vision or a mission
[19:40] statement it must harmonize with the
[19:42] vision of god's family
[19:44] brother chris this would fit in with
[19:45] what we were talking about last week on
[19:47] the five definite identifications of the
[19:49] true church of the living god we
[19:51] recognize as a local church we want to
[19:53] harmonize with the true church and serve
[19:56] the true church so a vision for a local
[19:58] church harmonizes with god's vision for
[20:00] his family and by extension your family
[20:04] he got is interested in you as the head
[20:07] of your family even to the point that if
[20:10] you have to separate from your parents
[20:12] in order to follow christ he does that
[20:15] so you can establish your family
[20:17] identity in the truth
[20:20] it's not that he just wants these rogue
[20:21] runaways that are running away from
[20:23] parents and separating from father and
[20:25] mother no the vision is that he could
[20:27] take you and sever you from those things
[20:29] that would keep you from growing in the
[20:31] word of god and plant you yourself that
[20:34] you might establish your own family
[20:36] according to the truth i think that's
[20:39] uh we could see that replete through
[20:41] scripture in the message
[20:42] now let's walk through a number of
[20:43] scriptures here
[20:45] uh on this subject of seeing the church
[20:48] and family connected in first timothy
[20:50] chapter 3 verse 15. again i'm wanting
[20:52] just to see these parallels and how
[20:54] these touch points so but if i tarry
[20:57] long that thou mayest know
[20:59] how thou oughtest to behave thyself in
[21:02] the house of god which is the church of
[21:04] the living god and here's a phrase the
[21:06] pillar and ground of the truth
[21:10] we have to have these churches
[21:12] because they become the pillar and
[21:14] ground of the truth
[21:16] and he's saying
[21:18] specifically that
[21:19] you may know how to behave thyself in
[21:22] the house of god he's speaking of a
[21:23] gathering just like this and our
[21:25] behavior within it not necessarily
[21:27] behavior and some sort of
[21:29] spiritual body of christ but how we know
[21:31] how to behave in the house of god and
[21:33] then he makes this connection which is
[21:35] the church of the living god
[21:37] and so this parallel now of the house of
[21:40] god and the church of the living god we
[21:42] say god's house is his church
[21:44] and therefore we know that a house is
[21:46] where the family meets it's where the
[21:48] family dwells it's where a family abides
[21:50] it's where the family eats
[21:52] and so god having a house it's where his
[21:55] church comes together to meet to dwell
[21:58] to eat to commune to see one another to
[22:00] hear from god to hear from their father
[22:03] it's a it's a point of meeting in a safe
[22:05] place and a comfortable thing all the
[22:07] images and elements of home
[22:09] ought to somehow exist at least
[22:10] spiritually in this idea of the house of
[22:12] god he says which is the church of god
[22:14] so
[22:15] paul is connecting the house of god to
[22:17] the church of god which is
[22:20] a house is where the family meets
[22:22] now just prior to that 10 verses before
[22:24] in first timothy chapter 3 verse 5 says
[22:27] for if a man know not how to rule his
[22:29] own house
[22:30] how shall he take care of the church of
[22:32] god
[22:34] once again paul has drawn a parallel
[22:36] between family or home and the church
[22:39] and he's making this uh remarkable
[22:41] statement that if a man doesn't know how
[22:42] to rule his own house then how shall he
[22:45] take care of the church of god now i
[22:48] know that it has probably been at least
[22:49] maybe we'll take the blame inferred on
[22:51] our part but i think it's been
[22:52] explicitly implied that in order for a
[22:55] man to rule his health it's with an iron
[22:57] clinch teeth
[23:00] right
[23:00] fill your house
[23:02] right and that's the way people feel you
[23:04] got a rule but rule here actually means
[23:06] to maintain or care for
[23:08] to be a protector to be a provider to
[23:11] give aid
[23:13] so if a man not know how to maintain his
[23:15] own house to care for it to be a
[23:16] protector to be a provider to give aid
[23:19] then how can he take care of the church
[23:21] of god isn't that beautiful
[23:23] in order to see it as maybe a ruler with
[23:25] an iron fist and a whip and you know
[23:27] there's where there's this fear factor
[23:29] involved where it's like well you better
[23:31] you better be careful you don't want the
[23:32] pastor getting mad and uh or even in the
[23:35] whole home that everyone's just walking
[23:37] there's people that share their
[23:38] experiences how they're home they're
[23:40] free and all of a sudden they hear the
[23:41] garage door open they know their dad's
[23:42] home from work and they completely panic
[23:45] seriously you laugh but they trigger
[23:47] you're just laughing because your dad
[23:48] doesn't use the garage door opener
[23:50] but there's it actually triggers them
[23:52] and their heart begins to race they want
[23:53] to disappear they want to stop what
[23:54] they're doing because the atmosphere
[23:57] that the father creates in the home is
[23:58] one of fear and trepidation why because
[24:01] he wants this is my castle i want to
[24:03] rule my domain so he makes even his own
[24:05] wife and children subjects more like
[24:07] servants
[24:09] than members of a household that work
[24:10] together
[24:12] and paul is saying that you have to know
[24:13] how to provide for care give aid in
[24:16] order to take care of the church of god
[24:19] it's a similar phrase when you look at
[24:21] the definition you look up take care it
[24:23] says to take care
[24:26] that's what the lexicon says but it's
[24:27] only used in one other place
[24:30] and it's used by christ in the
[24:32] parable of the good samaritan who is thy
[24:34] neighbor
[24:35] luke chapter 10 verses 33 to 35 catch
[24:38] this it says but a certain samaritan as
[24:40] he journeyed again we remember that this
[24:41] man was on his way
[24:43] down to jericho and he's been fallen by
[24:44] thieves who stripped them and left them
[24:46] half dead and the priest walks by and
[24:48] these different ones walk by and they
[24:50] avoid them they don't have anything to
[24:51] do one kind of looks like don't want to
[24:52] touch that but now the samaritan as he
[24:55] journeyed he came to where he was and
[24:57] when he saw him he had compassion on him
[24:59] and he went to him and bound up his
[25:02] wounds pouring in oil and wine and set
[25:04] him on his own beast and you could
[25:06] remember that
[25:08] it's really where it strikes me now
[25:10] revisiting this theme of the church's
[25:11] vision when we
[25:13] started the church we began two series
[25:15] in the beginning which became in the
[25:17] beginning god created a family through a
[25:18] number of services
[25:20] and we were doing on wednesday nights
[25:22] who is my neighbor
[25:24] and these were these two themes are just
[25:26] colliding this morning revisiting these
[25:28] things as the church has grown
[25:30] it says so now he says he bound him
[25:33] bound his wounds poured in oil and wine
[25:34] set him on his own beast and brought him
[25:37] to an end
[25:39] church he brought him to in and took
[25:42] care of him
[25:44] this is the only this is the one other
[25:46] place one of the other two places where
[25:48] it's used where he says take care of the
[25:50] church of god now this takes him to an
[25:52] end to take care of this member and on
[25:55] the morrow when he departed he took out
[25:57] two pens and gave them to the host
[25:59] brother venom likens this to the pastor
[26:02] and said to him take care of him and
[26:04] whatsoever thou spend us more when i
[26:05] come again i will repay thee
[26:08] i catch this how paul says
[26:11] he that rules his own house if you know
[26:13] how how can you if you don't know how to
[26:15] rule your own house care for provide
[26:17] give aid then how can you take care of
[26:19] the church of god and the only place
[26:21] that that's used is of an in and an
[26:24] innkeeper the host taking care of an
[26:26] individual that's been brought to the
[26:29] inn
[26:30] so we say taking care of the church of
[26:31] god you can't take care of the church of
[26:33] god and not take care of the members of
[26:34] the church
[26:35] it's not the building that we care for
[26:37] it's not the church order it's not the
[26:39] board that we're serving it's not the
[26:41] office of a pastor that we're serving
[26:43] anyone in any official capacity from
[26:45] song leader to musicians to deacons and
[26:47] trustees and pastor we're servants to
[26:50] the body
[26:51] working together at this end as servants
[26:54] who have been paid ahead of time and
[26:56] given the resources we need to minister
[26:59] to those that christ
[27:01] brings to the end that we might take
[27:04] care of the church of god
[27:08] that's the other place that the
[27:09] scripture is used this word is used take
[27:11] care of the church of god where the
[27:13] samaritan took care of him and then he
[27:15] admonished the innkeeper to take care of
[27:17] him
[27:19] now to continue this parallel i want you
[27:21] to catch the parallel
[27:23] among the family of god the house of god
[27:25] and your family how these things are
[27:27] interrelated and first corinthians
[27:29] chapter 16 verse 19
[27:31] it says the churches of asia salute you
[27:33] aquila and priscilla salute you much in
[27:35] the lord with the church that is in
[27:38] their house
[27:40] so this is how churches even begin in
[27:43] the in the new testament
[27:45] as they begin around families they begin
[27:48] around believers who would open up their
[27:49] home and welcome ministry and they would
[27:51] gather together in these places and so
[27:53] he's saying these churches salute you
[27:55] with the church that is in
[27:57] uh their house or quill and priscilla
[27:59] salute you together with those that are
[28:00] in their house with the church
[28:03] then colossians 4 15 salute the brethren
[28:06] which are in laodicea
[28:07] and memphis and the church which is in
[28:10] his house so again this is another place
[28:12] where there's greetings being sent from
[28:14] a church and where they gathered in the
[28:16] house and philemon 1 2 and to our
[28:18] beloved fire and archips our fellow
[28:20] soldier
[28:21] and to the church in thy house
[28:24] again these greetings to flemit and the
[28:26] church which is in his house what paul
[28:28] is doing in these few greetings is he's
[28:30] showing that there's a connection
[28:32] between the church gathering and the
[28:34] home
[28:35] that it's not uh
[28:38] it's not something that ought to be
[28:40] extricated or separated but there's such
[28:42] a continuity in harmony between an
[28:45] individual's family and their
[28:46] participation in the church to where
[28:48] churches were beginning in the homes
[28:51] they were beginning with the families
[28:53] they were beginning around the tables
[28:54] the communion was taking place within
[28:57] the family in the home they didn't
[28:58] necessarily have to go out and rebuild
[29:00] they didn't have to have a hotel they
[29:01] didn't have to have a a temple or
[29:03] cathedral a church could be had and paul
[29:05] is saying church can be
[29:07] in their house
[29:09] i don't get any ideas i love it that
[29:10] you're all here
[29:13] but this is a connection now we're
[29:14] seeing a connection between church and
[29:15] home
[29:16] now this scripture to me is outstanding
[29:19] if you haven't written one down yet
[29:20] here's your chance acts chapter 8 verse
[29:22] 3
[29:23] it says as for saul he made havoc which
[29:25] means to dishonor spot to ruin to defile
[29:29] it means to injure spot defile devastate
[29:32] ruin it's a it brings a dishonor so you
[29:34] spot something you dishonor
[29:36] saul made havoc of the church
[29:39] entering into every house
[29:41] and haley men and women committed them
[29:44] to prison
[29:46] so what does this scripture tell us
[29:48] you want to defile a church you want to
[29:50] weaken the church just enter the homes
[29:54] doesn't say paul
[29:56] wreaking havoc on the church entered the
[29:58] church you can say well brother aaron
[29:59] the churches were in their homes i know
[30:01] i just substantiated that
[30:03] but it wasn't just the church he entered
[30:05] but he entered into every house
[30:07] and took men and women and committed
[30:09] them to prison you want to weaken a
[30:11] church just enter the homes
[30:14] you want to you want to weaken a church
[30:15] break up the family separate the
[30:16] families
[30:18] if there's
[30:19] there's one thing that
[30:21] really burdens me
[30:23] is to see a family divided with one part
[30:26] part of the family attending one church
[30:28] and another one not attending another or
[30:30] even not going because they can't don't
[30:32] want to support their spouse and where
[30:33] they're going that's horrible that's a
[30:36] horrible situation to be in
[30:38] and that's how satan gets access to us
[30:41] when he breaks up family
[30:43] and when you break up the family when
[30:45] you enter in into divine and divide
[30:47] these things he says he wreaked havoc he
[30:49] made havoc of the church dishonored it
[30:51] and spotted it injured it and ruined it
[30:53] because he entered into every house and
[30:55] committed them to prison just bring
[30:57] families into bondage and the church is
[30:59] in havoc
[31:01] attendance continue to rise give can
[31:03] continue to rise things can seem to be
[31:06] thriving on the outside but do you want
[31:08] to know are they of one root system
[31:11] underneath
[31:12] they might look to be harmonious on the
[31:14] outside they might look to be a thriving
[31:16] church on the outside because we just
[31:18] kind of view them in these snapshots
[31:19] when they all get together on a sunday
[31:20] morning and maybe a wednesday night but
[31:23] are there families in bondage and if the
[31:25] families are in bondage if the families
[31:27] are broken if standards are being let
[31:28] down if things are changing in the
[31:30] family level and what they serve and
[31:32] what they live for in the relationship
[31:34] between the spouses and among the
[31:36] children if that is in bondage then
[31:39] listen let's not pretend the church
[31:41] likewise is in bondage
[31:46] i trust you're following me so far
[31:52] brother mitch did we put new batteries
[31:54] in this pack this morning okay i was
[31:55] going to suggest maybe changing them out
[31:58] we're on the endless quest to perfect
[32:01] this pack
[32:02] and it just might take another an
[32:04] investment of some sort and something
[32:06] different so apologize if the sound gets
[32:08] a little wonky at times we can blame it
[32:10] on the 5g let's just put that away
[32:13] now
[32:15] see
[32:18] he knows he's found out now or she
[32:19] whatever she whatever it is
[32:22] the 5g has been exposed
[32:26] now i'm going to show you a slide and
[32:28] it's entitled the purpose and vision of
[32:30] arizona believers church
[32:32] and this has been on our website i'm
[32:35] pretty sure maybe 85 of you have never
[32:37] heard of this before
[32:38] and probably didn't even know we had a
[32:40] website
[32:41] uh my family likes to troll me by saying
[32:43] oh you started a church in phoenix and
[32:46] where are you do you guys meet are there
[32:47] people in your church and oh you have a
[32:49] youtube channel oh and they not my kids
[32:52] but my other family
[32:54] they troll me all the time
[32:56] pretending they don't know where i'm at
[32:58] and i started a church and whether or
[32:59] not we have a website whether or not we
[33:01] stream but this is on the website and
[33:02] i'm not trolling you you can find it
[33:04] azbelievers.com
[33:06] like subscribe hit the notifications
[33:08] button and
[33:10] this is it and i've kind of summarized a
[33:12] little bit on the slide but in the
[33:13] beginning god's first masterpiece was a
[33:15] man and woman together as a family
[33:18] not a church
[33:20] in the beginning god didn't start a
[33:21] church he created a family and say
[33:24] therefore as a church as a local church
[33:27] this is our existence we exist
[33:29] not just to build i say not to build
[33:31] merely build a vibrant social community
[33:33] a thriving social community where
[33:35] everything is kind of meeting our needs
[33:37] socially and it's more of a social
[33:39] gathering that divides and breaks up
[33:40] afterwards or
[33:42] just kind of continues only along social
[33:44] touch points but to establish equip and
[33:47] encourage individuals and families in
[33:49] the word for today now i want you to
[33:51] recognize that this is a scriptural
[33:53] vision based upon these
[33:55] bible verses we shared with you that
[33:57] directly connects family and home to the
[33:59] church of god
[34:01] even acts chapter 8 verse 3 that satan
[34:03] enters into the house to bring the to
[34:05] wreak havoc in the church
[34:06] so we realize then what we have to do is
[34:08] strengthen the homes
[34:10] he says we desire true spiritual
[34:12] relationships be established between god
[34:14] and individuals by the present truth we
[34:16] seek to equip those individuals with the
[34:18] spiritual resources necessary to live an
[34:21] overcoming life according to god's word
[34:24] we strive to encourage all individuals
[34:27] through christ so that they may live for
[34:29] others
[34:30] that's our vision and goal and we
[34:31] realize these individuals is what makes
[34:32] up the family so we want to encourage
[34:35] individuals to take their part within
[34:36] their families and that's the purpose
[34:38] and vision of this church is not that
[34:41] people would come and serve the purpose
[34:43] of the church but that the church would
[34:45] serve those who are coming
[34:47] and serve their purpose and their vision
[34:49] and
[34:50] and who knows maybe in terms of church
[34:52] planting science that may not be a very
[34:54] good way of building a church
[34:56] but i would rather have that as the
[34:57] vision and have those who are coming be
[35:00] served and be enriched and benefited
[35:02] than just having a gathering that is
[35:04] structured in such a way to get a lot of
[35:06] numbers
[35:08] we had had this conversation with our
[35:10] commercial broker when we were trying to
[35:11] find a facility and even uh the other
[35:13] pastor
[35:14] another pastor of a church that was
[35:16] wanting to rent out a facility and there
[35:18] was this question of well how do you
[35:19] feel about
[35:21] the number of people and how do you feel
[35:23] about doing this and they found that
[35:25] these things work and this is what might
[35:26] work to do this and that and i just said
[35:28] if i was wanting to start a cult i said
[35:31] i would be very very strict to the
[35:32] science
[35:33] if i was just wanting to start a church
[35:35] they had a lot of people coming and that
[35:36] we we i'd be very very strict according
[35:39] to what um science is telling us in
[35:41] terms of size and number and times and
[35:43] length of service and all those other
[35:45] things you would be very in tuned to
[35:47] that but what i share from my heart is
[35:49] that the body of christ is transcendent
[35:51] it transcends all those markers all
[35:53] those influences that if we were merely
[35:56] just trying to build a group a gathering
[35:58] then we would look to group dynamics and
[36:00] the science of groups and the science of
[36:02] crowds and figure out the best way to
[36:04] have the best kind of services on a
[36:05] sunday morning
[36:07] and we probably wouldn't even have a
[36:08] midweek according to the data according
[36:10] to the numbers but the body of christ
[36:11] transcends that so we don't operate by
[36:14] the science we don't operate by the
[36:15] numbers we don't operate by the dynamics
[36:17] we actually are an outlier when it comes
[36:19] to how groups operate
[36:22] listen you all are outliers in terms of
[36:24] where you go to church because i'm
[36:25] pretty sure i haven't drilled down into
[36:27] it but i'm sure there's a gallup poll
[36:28] there's some
[36:29] statistics somewhere that tell you how
[36:31] far someone typically drives to go to
[36:33] church on sunday if they do and i'm
[36:34] pretty sure almost all of you except for
[36:37] maybe you
[36:39] drive further than anybody else you're
[36:40] like outside that zone
[36:43] like people don't normally drive 30
[36:45] minutes to church they don't pass all
[36:46] these other churches to go so the body
[36:48] of christ transcends what's normal and
[36:50] natural in the world
[36:52] now with this vision still here i want
[36:54] to leave this slide up for a moment
[36:56] and this is where i i'm i'm burying my
[36:59] heart i actually wrote these things down
[37:01] uh just last week because i wanted to
[37:03] get these things on paper that were what
[37:05] were in my heart because i want to be
[37:06] very deliberate in what i share now
[37:09] the initial vision which has not changed
[37:11] was to become a church family
[37:14] and to build a home church
[37:17] a home church in name this this is my
[37:19] home church this is where we feel home
[37:21] but then it functions as one functions
[37:23] as a home church
[37:24] and we become more than just a church
[37:25] but a church family
[37:27] and because church does not replace
[37:30] family
[37:31] and it does not replace family
[37:33] leadership i'm very clear about this
[37:35] that i am nobody's spiritual husband
[37:38] here
[37:39] okay christ is your spiritual husband
[37:42] and and i am
[37:44] i am literally not spiritually i'm
[37:46] literally the pastor of this church so
[37:48] brother brother says your pastor is your
[37:51] husband spiritually speaking he's not
[37:53] saying that i
[37:54] am spiritually anybody's husband
[37:58] i am literally your pastor not
[38:00] spiritually speaking i'm literally
[38:01] speaking you're pastor of this church
[38:03] and i watch out over your souls as god
[38:05] commands me but christ is the shepherd
[38:07] of your souls christ is the spiritual
[38:09] shepherd he's the one watching over your
[38:12] souls and i'm a helper to him and aiding
[38:14] him in that process and then at the in
[38:16] the home i am spiritually a pastor to
[38:19] sister elizabeth
[38:21] so in your homes you husbands you are a
[38:24] spiritual pastor to your wife not the
[38:25] literal pastor but a spiritual pastor in
[38:28] your homes so that nobody should be
[38:30] looking to brother aaron as their
[38:31] spiritual husband
[38:34] and so very sensitive to that that the
[38:35] church and the leadership of the church
[38:37] does not replace family and it does not
[38:38] replace family leadership and with that
[38:40] as a conviction and these things being
[38:43] uh
[38:44] part of my uh the training that god was
[38:47] putting me through when god began to
[38:48] deal with my heart and i felt i sensed
[38:50] what he was calling me to do i what i
[38:52] basically did is i took a step back and
[38:54] said all right
[38:55] i know in the natural when you go to
[38:56] school you pick a major
[38:58] and by the time you're done you take
[39:00] your
[39:01] you take your introductory courses your
[39:02] foundational courses fundamental courses
[39:04] then you take mid-level upper level then
[39:06] you get your degree and the whole time
[39:08] you know i went to engineering school i
[39:10] got an engineering education i'm going
[39:12] to be an engineer i got my engineering
[39:14] degree but it's not always as obvious
[39:16] with sons and daughters of god
[39:18] because you didn't pick your trial you
[39:19] didn't pick your major you didn't pick
[39:20] your calling these are things that you
[39:22] have sometimes have to stop take a step
[39:24] back and not be so frustrated with
[39:26] what's transpired in your life say hold
[39:28] on god's had me in school
[39:30] so what has he been teaching me what
[39:32] have i been learning and if you look
[39:34] back and know what he's been teaching
[39:35] you what you've been learning it'll tell
[39:37] you what your calling is
[39:38] it'll give you some idea of how he's
[39:40] wanting to use you now and i looked back
[39:42] at what god had been teaching me and
[39:43] showing me in my experiences and i
[39:44] realized he'd been giving me a very a a
[39:47] a deep empathy and a sensitivity to
[39:49] certain things and so with that as part
[39:52] of my training and very conscious to me
[39:54] when i set out to start a church i
[39:55] approached cautiously
[39:57] in in starting the church and even in in
[40:01] establishing it
[40:02] and i was reluctant to create an
[40:04] environment that fostered fear
[40:07] i really and i know some of you might uh
[40:10] know exactly what i'm talking about i
[40:11] wanted to avoid all these common tropes
[40:13] that bind people to church
[40:16] where you're just it's just uh it's the
[40:18] it's fear
[40:19] it's pressure it's church attendance
[40:22] it's dangling the carrot uh it's it's
[40:25] it's in some ways buying
[40:27] buying loyalty i i just wanted to avoid
[40:31] all the things that sometimes work
[40:32] within just our human spirits and get us
[40:34] to kind of like
[40:35] i guess i'll go to church today
[40:38] and and i wanted to avoid that and some
[40:40] of you here in the beginning know that
[40:41] we labeled on that quite a bit
[40:44] or we meant we had mentioned these
[40:45] things and i didn't want church
[40:47] attendance to feel compulsory i didn't
[40:48] want the you know service to the church
[40:50] to feel like a draft like well i guess
[40:52] i've been drafted i got to
[40:54] go to clean the chalkboard or whatever i
[40:56] didn't want you to i didn't want it to
[40:57] feel like it was imposed on anybody
[40:59] and so i would say for the past 20
[41:01] months we have
[41:02] made a place available for believers to
[41:05] come and hear the word that's the number
[41:06] one vision that will not change the word
[41:08] is first we provide a place for
[41:10] believers to come and hear the word
[41:12] and i have not wanted to be pushy or
[41:14] overbearing and i'm not warning you that
[41:15] i will now begin to get pushy or
[41:17] overbearing
[41:18] so if you stop streaming or if you stop
[41:20] listening at this point well brother
[41:21] aaron basically signaled they're gonna
[41:23] start to get pushing over no i want you
[41:25] to recognize i've been sensitive to that
[41:27] and so not being pushy and overbearing
[41:29] you can be almost to there's a downside
[41:32] to where you can become too hands off
[41:34] i don't want to be pushy but then you
[41:35] just you get hands off because you don't
[41:37] want to be pushy and then taking your
[41:39] hands off
[41:40] they don't you maybe don't feel the
[41:42] encouragement you don't feel the nudge
[41:44] and so in an effort to create a low
[41:45] pressure climate
[41:47] we can miss being welcoming we can miss
[41:49] being comfortable we can actually miss
[41:50] creating the right kind of climate
[41:53] and it dawned on me that you can be so
[41:55] careful as to not create a toxic
[41:58] environment that you end up with a
[41:59] sterile
[42:00] one you're so worried about not being
[42:03] taught you're so worried about not
[42:04] creating the wrong atmosphere that you
[42:06] never really get to creating the right
[42:07] one
[42:08] and and if i'm
[42:11] giving ammunition to my critics i in
[42:13] some ways i'm apologizing to whatever
[42:15] extent that it hasn't been as engaging
[42:17] or you're not as welcomed and you don't
[42:19] feel apart it's maybe been more from my
[42:21] complex side not wanting to be pushy but
[42:24] what i can say now is god has dealt with
[42:26] my heart over the last couple weeks
[42:28] we've i believe there's been a a growing
[42:30] stage and god is adding pieces together
[42:32] and i feel that we've come to a place
[42:34] now where i have a a definite burden
[42:36] that i want there to be an overt
[42:38] deliberate effort to foster the feeling
[42:41] of family amongst us
[42:43] and to where it has the feeling of home
[42:45] that resting place that quiet place the
[42:47] safe place the scripture uh
[42:50] speaks about and home has always been a
[42:53] part of our theme here
[42:56] it has always been a part of our vision
[42:57] when god first
[42:59] was speaking to me starting a church the
[43:01] the the inspiration was come home
[43:04] that there's a fold there's a fog
[43:06] there's a place that you belong and it
[43:07] was come home
[43:08] and uh maybe again my complex not
[43:11] wanting it to come across the wrong way
[43:12] i started with going home that our theme
[43:14] is the rapture wanting to go home but
[43:16] there is a there's always been a theme
[43:18] of home of making uh making this church
[43:21] a home a home for believers that's why
[43:23] it's called arizona believers church a
[43:25] place for people to come and feel apart
[43:27] and be part of a family and so now i
[43:29] want to be more deliberate in that
[43:31] vision
[43:32] i want to be more purposeful in that
[43:34] vision
[43:36] and and to begin
[43:38] to be more conscious and aware of how we
[43:41] can all be drawn in around the right
[43:43] things
[43:44] not around a schedule not making our
[43:46] schedule so busy where it's like the
[43:48] church has a cricket team now and i've
[43:50] got to go practice and
[43:52] i got to learn how to you know i'm the
[43:54] lawn dart coach and we just come up with
[43:56] so many things to keep you so busy
[43:57] that's not my vision that's not my goal
[43:59] because the way where that gets
[44:00] counterproductive we get so busy with
[44:02] the church family we neglect our home
[44:04] life we neglect our extended families
[44:06] and our responsibilities and obligations
[44:08] what i've desired to see over the last
[44:10] 20 months is that we come here and we
[44:11] get energized and we go out there and
[44:12] we're broadcasting the message and we
[44:14] win souls
[44:16] i'll delve into this much deeper when we
[44:17] talk about our family tree
[44:19] i won't even get to the real kernel of
[44:21] inspiration hopefully next sunday and
[44:23] you're like aaron you're always doing
[44:24] that but that's just my method
[44:26] uh that there's i want to touch on this
[44:28] that when coming to count there's
[44:30] something about counting the ones that
[44:32] are born there
[44:34] and that i really want to see our church
[44:35] see souls saved and birthed or delivered
[44:37] and restored like that's my that's my
[44:39] real part of my vision and that's why
[44:42] we're all here today
[44:44] is to work within god's great economy to
[44:46] see that souls are saved and it can be
[44:47] right within our own families it doesn't
[44:49] mean we have to go out there and start
[44:50] beating down the doors of the fraternity
[44:52] houses but it can be within our own
[44:54] family that we see people rescued and
[44:55] saved
[44:57] and brother so this this is where i'm
[44:59] coming back to that foundational quote
[45:01] he says he made a paradise for them
[45:05] as a father with his family he was
[45:06] called the extreme parent
[45:09] and so in that sense i want to on a
[45:12] church level commit myself to fostering
[45:14] and nurturing a family tree i want to
[45:16] commit myself to being an extreme pastor
[45:20] to uh to cultivate
[45:22] an extreme family
[45:25] and brother ram said that he made a
[45:26] paradise for them
[45:29] he said let there be let there be and
[45:30] let there be an eden let there be
[45:31] beautiful flowers let it be my son in my
[45:33] own image and stand over there in the
[45:34] garden of eden and let his bride stand
[45:36] by his side
[45:38] what a what a beautiful summation of
[45:40] creation
[45:41] it doesn't necessarily follow it
[45:43] chronologically uh and and peace break
[45:45] up the pieces but here he is he's using
[45:47] the spoken word to create an eden a
[45:49] beautiful place and let my son come in
[45:51] my image
[45:53] stand with his bride by his side in this
[45:55] garden of eden
[45:57] so let's examine this
[45:59] in genesis chapter 2 verse 8 it says the
[46:01] lord god planted
[46:03] a garden eastward in eden and there he
[46:06] put the man whom he had formed
[46:09] if anybody's keeping track how many
[46:10] times i use these scriptures i would
[46:11] like to know the score
[46:13] because we've used them
[46:14] dozens of times and dozens of sermons
[46:16] since we've started and i know themes
[46:18] are being repeated quite often
[46:20] but
[46:21] there's a
[46:23] it just seems that there's layers that
[46:24] are coming to this this is part of the
[46:26] fabric that god is wanting to weave
[46:27] together here in the outset but a garden
[46:29] is an enclosure it literally means an
[46:31] enclosure or an enclosed garden which
[46:33] may be another way it could say god
[46:34] planted an enclosed garden it comes from
[46:37] the root of to surround or to cover to
[46:38] protect so it's an enclosure
[46:40] and he planted a garden eastward in eden
[46:43] we realized by now it's been repeated
[46:45] quite a bit that that means my pleasure
[46:46] or delight so this is god's delight it
[46:48] was a ground or inclusion of pleasure
[46:51] it's what's referred to as paradise
[46:54] brother branham said he made a paradise
[46:57] for them the bible calls it a paradise
[46:59] revelations 2 7 he that hath an ear let
[47:01] him hear with the spirit saith unto the
[47:03] churches to him that overcometh will i
[47:05] give to eat of the tree of life which is
[47:07] in the midst of the paradise of god
[47:11] the paradise there means pleasure ground
[47:14] it could have been translated to garden
[47:15] but garden of eden even in different
[47:17] languages it's literally translated to
[47:20] paradise that's what kind of even in the
[47:22] root it has in the and the
[47:26] in the middle eastern languages it's
[47:28] speaking of a pleasure ground
[47:30] a park with enclosures and certain
[47:32] amenities
[47:33] and so this is god's paradise but not
[47:35] just god's paradise man's home
[47:39] it says he planted a garden and there he
[47:41] put the man that he had formed i could
[47:44] say this for adam it was literally
[47:45] heaven on earth
[47:47] because it was a paradise
[47:49] he had it this is where he lived and
[47:51] there's actually i think it's within
[47:54] judaism and maybe some other branches of
[47:56] christianity they hold paradise they're
[47:57] very strict on this that the idea of
[48:00] paradise is they believe it to be a
[48:03] higher realm that man lived in that he
[48:05] fell from
[48:06] so that man even living here on earth
[48:08] was living in a different dimension that
[48:11] there was another dimension just a
[48:12] little bit higher that he existed within
[48:13] and that makes a lot of sense we know
[48:15] that there's a paradise scripturally
[48:17] that
[48:17] empties out and there's these uh trinity
[48:20] above a trinity beneath there's
[48:21] different dimensions as we would lay
[48:22] them out and they believe that it was
[48:24] the pla paradise was between heaven and
[48:27] earth
[48:27] that's what they refer to paradise is a
[48:29] realm and a dimension between heaven and
[48:31] earth what a beautiful blending together
[48:33] probably that overlap that venn diagram
[48:35] of heaven and earth and that's where
[48:37] adam and the woman lived in the garden
[48:38] of eden that's what paradise was and
[48:40] that's what they fell from
[48:43] in the masterpiece brother bram says
[48:44] this masterpiece was walled by the word
[48:46] it was a masterpiece family is what he
[48:48] calls it
[48:49] and the masterpiece itself of the family
[48:51] remember the masterpiece was not just
[48:53] adam the masterpiece was the family and
[48:55] it was fortified by his word and it was
[48:58] enclosed by his word covered by his word
[49:01] that's the garden
[49:03] and man is a part of this paradise man
[49:06] i said how beautiful it is the flowers
[49:09] the eden the paradise in the garden of
[49:11] eden with his bride by his side
[49:14] just reading this quick statement i
[49:15] believe i have i don't have it on a
[49:16] slight says what what it was at the
[49:17] beginning
[49:18] when god put adam and eve in the garden
[49:21] that beautiful paradise without death
[49:23] without sickness without sorrow and
[49:24] everything perfect in order
[49:27] power of transformation says we find
[49:29] everything in order
[49:31] what is this
[49:33] image of what is this what is this a
[49:35] picture of what is god portraying
[49:38] in this image now
[49:40] of
[49:41] the garden
[49:45] and i want to
[49:47] let me just ponder how to express this
[49:53] i want you to there's a vision that's
[49:54] being expressed we're having we're
[49:55] looking back to genesis but then we know
[49:58] it looks there's a looking forward too
[50:00] and this is a very necessary foundation
[50:01] as i said in the beginning i want christ
[50:03] to be at the center of this
[50:04] but then i want you to see how man
[50:06] how our there's an image of us that
[50:08] starts to kind of come into this picture
[50:10] now we just read that god planted a
[50:11] garden east with eden that's his delight
[50:13] that's his pleasure it's a paradise he
[50:16] put the man that he had formed
[50:18] in this eden but look at verse 7 and the
[50:21] lord god formed man of the dust of the
[50:23] ground and breathed into his nostrils
[50:25] the breath of life and man became a
[50:27] living soul now that's a very curious
[50:29] description but we know that man was
[50:31] first made spiritual supernatural and
[50:33] that this part is the flesh which we
[50:36] inhabit now this physical body and he
[50:38] says he formed him from the dust of the
[50:40] ground now what an incredible image
[50:42] because we see elsewhere where god forms
[50:44] the beast from the ground and so we see
[50:46] that seeds are coming forth from the
[50:47] ground all nature's coming forth from
[50:50] the soil it's coming forth from mother
[50:52] earth as it was he says he formed man of
[50:54] the dust of the ground not just
[50:56] in that moment speaking the word and
[50:59] things coming together in the ether or
[51:01] something not seen but it's known that
[51:03] the spoken word earth this ground that
[51:06] came by the spoken word of god god took
[51:08] certain elements and he began to form
[51:11] man up we say dust to the ground he's
[51:13] taking him from the clay he's taken him
[51:15] from the earth he's taking him from the
[51:17] mud
[51:19] i know that we might think dust and
[51:20] we're thinking hmm
[51:22] right we're just thinking maybe just
[51:24] particles or something but it's the
[51:26] image of dirt he's forming him from the
[51:28] earth from the soil
[51:30] brings us to being rooted and grounded
[51:32] in love
[51:33] a question and answers on genesis
[51:34] brother brandon give such a beautiful
[51:36] remarkable description of this he says
[51:38] and ben but then there was no man to
[51:40] till the soil
[51:42] so there's the impetus for putting him
[51:44] in flesh and it's no man to till the
[51:46] soil so he takes man from the very thing
[51:49] he's going to attend
[51:51] that remarkable no man to till the soul
[51:53] and when god formed man genesis 2 7 this
[51:56] is a quote here out of the dust of the
[51:57] earth now we follow it he formed man out
[52:00] of the dust of the earth and put his
[52:02] supernatural spirit now he was laying
[52:04] there i have many pictures of it
[52:07] and and and when i'm thinking he says i
[52:09] have many pictures of it i don't know if
[52:10] he's talking about literal pictures that
[52:12] he's researched or if it's in his this
[52:13] prophetic mind
[52:15] but now this one he says i can see so
[52:18] watch this prophetic vision i can see
[52:20] adam standing let's take it this way see
[52:24] him standing like a tree
[52:26] god had made him and he was dead as he
[52:28] could be his toes like the roots
[52:31] sticking in the ground
[52:34] you recognize what god has just done
[52:36] according to this prophetic vision
[52:38] is he has
[52:40] brother ram sees adam
[52:42] being grown
[52:44] formed from the dust of the earth and as
[52:46] he looks at him before life comes into
[52:48] him he sees him as a tree where his toes
[52:51] are his roots in the dirt and he's
[52:53] standing up like a tree sticking in the
[52:55] ground
[52:57] so he's setting forth man as a tree god
[53:00] said let there be and breathe the breath
[53:01] of life into him and he jumped and came
[53:03] to himself breathed the breath of life
[53:05] into him and he became a living soul now
[53:06] he begin to move on move on
[53:09] why because initially man in his flesh
[53:11] is represented as a tree and he says i
[53:14] see him standing there toes standing
[53:16] like a tree and he's dead as he could be
[53:18] but his toes are roots in the earth can
[53:20] you just picture that in your mind
[53:22] listen i think we've watched enough
[53:23] youtube videos and movies to be able to
[53:25] picture adam as a trunk and a tree and
[53:27] his toes in the mud and this dirt and
[53:29] he's standing there lifeless and then
[53:30] god speaks and the tree comes to life
[53:34] does not psalms 1 teach us that
[53:37] a man
[53:38] is like a tree planted
[53:40] by the rivers of water
[53:42] was it's a type
[53:46] now we covered this in detail and just
[53:47] even mentioned it in our motherhood
[53:49] sermon
[53:50] in genesis chapter 2 verse 22 adam
[53:53] is even in the image of the tree as he
[53:55] comes forth
[53:57] and god says he planted a garden and put
[54:00] man in the garden
[54:01] so it's like a tree also now as man and
[54:04] type formed from the dust of the ground
[54:05] placed there in the garden
[54:08] and then when it comes to the woman
[54:11] god has said in genesis chapter 1 verse
[54:13] 11 let each seed bring forth of its kind
[54:15] so there has to be a tree yielding seed
[54:18] after its kind it has to be of the same
[54:20] tree so when god goes to form the woman
[54:23] he does not create again but he takes
[54:25] the adam tree
[54:27] and he says and the rib which the lord
[54:29] god had taken from the man made he a
[54:31] woman and brought her unto the man
[54:34] remember rib is the side or chamber but
[54:37] it's literally translated to beam it
[54:39] means a beam like a a plank of wood
[54:43] it's translated that very word rib is
[54:45] trying to boards of cedar
[54:48] and planks of fur in the temple
[54:52] boards of cedar rib of cedar is purity
[54:54] rib of fur nobility in the description i
[54:57] think it's first king six it's
[54:59] describing and using rib to describe the
[55:01] wooden elements of cedar and fur within
[55:03] the temple and so again in type adam is
[55:07] a tree and god has taken a material from
[55:09] that tree a seed from that tree he's
[55:12] taking something off of that tree that
[55:13] rib to build a woman and she is now of
[55:17] the same tree
[55:20] and brother graham says in marriage and
[55:21] divorce well the woman is the tree
[55:24] she is the fruit tree
[55:25] you're the fruit of your mother the
[55:27] fruit of the womb is you
[55:29] so now man is a tree and the woman
[55:31] having come from adam she is also typed
[55:33] to a tree
[55:36] in type
[55:38] the the this is the it's a
[55:39] representation
[55:41] now in verse nine i know we're kind of
[55:42] skipping around so brother aaron you
[55:43] need to learn to read your bible
[55:45] 789 not 879 but here we are genesis 2 9
[55:48] and out of the ground made the lord god
[55:50] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[55:52] the sight
[55:53] and good for food so if it grew from the
[55:55] ground and it's growing from the ground
[55:59] and you can see it then it's good for
[56:00] food it's pleasant to the site the tree
[56:02] of life also in the midst of the garden
[56:06] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[56:07] evil remember these are symbols
[56:10] these are types brother bam says in the
[56:12] writes in the church age book we start
[56:14] with the fact that there were two trees
[56:16] in the midst of the garden it says right
[56:18] here the tree of life in the midst and
[56:19] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[56:21] the tree of life was jesus
[56:23] the other tree is definitely satan
[56:26] because of what come forth of the fruit
[56:28] of that tree we're just reading it from
[56:30] the message of the hour from the church
[56:32] age book the tree of life was jesus the
[56:33] other tree is definitely satan but then
[56:35] man and woman are also in type trees but
[56:38] they're not these trees according to
[56:40] this statement the tree of life is
[56:41] christ three of knowledge of good and
[56:43] evil satan you'll recognize symbolically
[56:45] how he plays this out he says now then
[56:47] listen to how important this is we both
[56:49] we know that both of these trees had a
[56:52] relationship to man or they would never
[56:54] have been placed there
[56:56] they must have had a part in the
[56:58] sovereign plan and purpose of god in the
[57:00] relationship to mankind and to himself
[57:02] or we could never impute omniscience
[57:04] unto god
[57:06] so he places these trees there the tree
[57:08] of life and the tree of knowledge of
[57:09] good and evil and they have some
[57:11] relationship to man
[57:14] and they have some part in the sovereign
[57:16] plan and purpose of god and a
[57:17] relationship not just to man but some
[57:19] relationship to god himself or otherwise
[57:22] god didn't know what he was doing when
[57:23] he did this
[57:25] the parrot message paradox between all
[57:27] know that christ is that tree of life
[57:31] so christ is represented in this tree of
[57:34] life christ himself is foreshadowed in
[57:36] scripture as being a tree in song of
[57:38] solomon 2 3 as the apple tree among the
[57:40] trees of the wood so here's an apple
[57:43] tree among the other trees and the
[57:44] forest so is my beloved among the suns
[57:48] i saw i sat down under his shadow with
[57:51] great delight and his fruit was sweet to
[57:53] my taste
[57:54] here's christ being represented as an
[57:57] apple tree
[57:59] who provides a shadow who provides fruit
[58:02] christ is represented as fruit a fruit
[58:04] tree and a shade tree this is speaking
[58:06] of christ
[58:08] because christ is the tree of life
[58:12] this is the image of christ as a tree of
[58:13] fruit tree
[58:16] now
[58:17] you have adam and the woman typed as
[58:19] trees tree of life tree of knowledge of
[58:21] good and evil now when the serpent
[58:22] approaches the woman what's this
[58:24] conversation about
[58:26] trees
[58:27] god's god did god not say you shall eat
[58:30] you shall not eat of every tree of the
[58:32] garden in genesis 3 1 this is the
[58:35] conversation now
[58:36] immediately comes to the trees and the
[58:38] fruit of the trees
[58:40] and this is contrary to genesis 2 17
[58:42] where god said but of the tree of the
[58:44] fruit of the tree of knowledge of good
[58:45] and evil you shall not eat because the
[58:47] day you eat that day you die but now the
[58:50] serpent wants to bring the this tree and
[58:52] to view these trees into view
[58:56] and
[58:57] is everybody staying with me are you
[58:58] guys staying with me so far i don't i
[58:59] don't think it's um
[59:01] too too long or too hot at this point so
[59:03] i think we're we should be good to
[59:05] finish
[59:06] and the sermon what shall i do with
[59:08] jesus i could labor on that but i want
[59:10] just to get that in your thought that
[59:11] the serpent now this the subtle beast of
[59:13] the field comes to the woman and he
[59:16] starts the conversations about tree to
[59:18] get her to eat the fruit of the tree of
[59:19] knowledge of good and evil
[59:21] and says in the sermon what shall i do
[59:22] with jesus it says the same christ that
[59:25] tree that was in the garden of eden
[59:27] that eve left eating off of this tree of
[59:29] life to take the tree of wisdom she left
[59:32] the tree of life to take the tree of
[59:34] death
[59:35] so this is what the woman does in the
[59:37] beginning her even herself being a plank
[59:39] or beam or the wood of purity the wood
[59:42] of nobility that came forth from adam
[59:45] here she stands with sacred virtues that
[59:47] she must protect but now she has mingled
[59:49] herself and she chooses the tree of
[59:51] death instead of the tree of life
[59:54] in marriage and divorce where brother
[59:55] graham said the woman is like a tree he
[59:57] says and he says you're the fruit of the
[59:59] womb as you he continues this is in the
[1:00:01] fruit of the tree of life that was in
[1:00:02] the garden of eden is christ
[1:00:06] the fruit of the tree of life
[1:00:08] that was in the garden of eden is christ
[1:00:10] so it's the tree of life
[1:00:12] back again
[1:00:14] through the woman come death through the
[1:00:16] man
[1:00:17] capital m in the original creation come
[1:00:19] life
[1:00:20] through adam all men die through christ
[1:00:23] we are made alive
[1:00:25] and so the fruit of the christ is
[1:00:27] represented as the tree of life
[1:00:29] as the fruit coming to
[1:00:31] you know the the
[1:00:33] the tree of life coming back again the
[1:00:35] man in the original creation come he
[1:00:37] brought life
[1:00:38] now in type
[1:00:41] and i know we addressed this um
[1:00:43] at the outset when we ministered on this
[1:00:45] in the beginning
[1:00:46] that when satan comes to the woman as
[1:00:49] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:00:51] when she falls in sin satan caused a
[1:00:54] hybrid tree
[1:00:56] because now
[1:00:57] it's the wrong family tree it doesn't
[1:00:59] make it the continuity is broken
[1:01:02] you have the the
[1:01:03] the extreme parent with his son and
[1:01:05] daughter as a family on earth and there
[1:01:08] to multiply and replicity of god at the
[1:01:10] top and the way they would maybe diagram
[1:01:12] this is you have got at the top and then
[1:01:13] it would just it was to branch out and
[1:01:16] it would all be under that but when the
[1:01:17] woman does what she does
[1:01:19] it bran it takes and it creates a whole
[1:01:21] separate tree
[1:01:25] it's gone into a whole separate heading
[1:01:26] a whole separate headship you wouldn't
[1:01:28] you wouldn't even begin to chart them
[1:01:30] together because now she's left the
[1:01:31] headship and it creates a totally
[1:01:33] different tree and she violated that the
[1:01:36] commandment that trees are to yield
[1:01:38] genesis 11 are to yield fruit after its
[1:01:40] kind
[1:01:42] so it's already speaking in type to the
[1:01:45] man and the woman that it has to be
[1:01:46] after your kind and so when they violate
[1:01:48] genesis 2 17 the tree which is wood
[1:01:51] pieces timber and these are even in the
[1:01:53] meaning of tree it means plank or
[1:01:55] building materials pieces of wood a tree
[1:01:58] was good the tree or pieces of wood of
[1:02:01] good and evil
[1:02:04] you see what took place the tree of
[1:02:05] knowledge and good and evil was to take
[1:02:07] good and to take things that were not
[1:02:09] harmonious with we say evil it's not
[1:02:12] necessarily we have to kind of keep in
[1:02:14] our mind he didn't take like something
[1:02:15] clean and then take a crack pipe and
[1:02:17] smuggle it into eve's uh backpack it was
[1:02:20] he took things that ought not to mix
[1:02:22] and in doing who took good and when it
[1:02:24] mingled then you're mixing pieces of
[1:02:26] wood you're you're you're gendering
[1:02:28] things that are different and he says it
[1:02:30] and what i'm wanting to express then in
[1:02:32] this as we see this tree
[1:02:34] image he mixed the family tree
[1:02:43] so in genesis 3 15.
[1:02:50] in genesis 3 15 in the curse
[1:02:52] he says i will put enmity between thee
[1:02:54] and the woman
[1:02:57] and thy seed which is zera it's the
[1:02:59] offspring it's the seed that's even
[1:03:00] mentioned and which talk about each seed
[1:03:02] bringing forth of its kind
[1:03:04] and between thy seed and her seed it
[1:03:06] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[1:03:08] bruise his heel
[1:03:09] this is prophecy of another tree
[1:03:12] just as brother adam said it's the fruit
[1:03:13] of the tree of life that was in the
[1:03:14] garden of eden is christ this is a
[1:03:16] redemption of the family tree that's
[1:03:19] chopped down in eden
[1:03:21] so one of the most outstanding
[1:03:23] prophecies of christ is in isaiah
[1:03:24] chapter 11 verse 1. the seed of the
[1:03:27] woman her seed is going to be the tree
[1:03:30] of life brought back again it's the
[1:03:31] fruit of the tree of life in the garden
[1:03:33] of eden so when they prophesied of
[1:03:34] christ in isaiah 11 1 and it said there
[1:03:36] shall come forth a rod out of the stem
[1:03:39] of jesse and the branch shall grow out
[1:03:41] of his roots
[1:03:44] so a rod a branch or limb out of the
[1:03:47] stem or stump of jesse which the stump
[1:03:50] implies something cut close down to the
[1:03:52] roots a rod shall shoot out of the stump
[1:03:54] of jesse something cut down to the roots
[1:03:56] a branch shall grow out of his roots
[1:04:02] a branch of sprouter shoot it grow to
[1:04:04] bear to be fruitful to branch off to be
[1:04:06] fruitful and multiply a branch shall be
[1:04:08] fruitful
[1:04:09] what is he depicting he's depicting a
[1:04:11] family tree
[1:04:12] and christ is the branch zechariah 6 12
[1:04:15] zechariah 3
[1:04:17] 8 or so it refers to the servant shall
[1:04:19] be the branch behold zechariah 6 12.
[1:04:21] behold the man whose name is the branch
[1:04:25] so christ is this branch
[1:04:28] this rod that's going to come from
[1:04:30] something cut down the stump of jesse is
[1:04:32] going to sprout forth and it's actually
[1:04:34] depicting a family tree
[1:04:37] and so this is taken from a book over a
[1:04:40] thousand years old in this rendering of
[1:04:43] these scriptures
[1:04:44] that you have on the on the left side
[1:04:46] you can see that there's a branch draw
[1:04:49] growing from the stomach of jesse
[1:04:53] and then it continues it's on the next
[1:04:55] page and they have these scriptures and
[1:04:57] these remarks coming underneath i could
[1:04:58] have provided the whole page but it was
[1:05:00] just
[1:05:00] i would i don't think it would have
[1:05:02] given you the context but then the next
[1:05:04] one is david playing the harp and you
[1:05:06] can see that he thou it's represented
[1:05:08] now this branch is growing and it has a
[1:05:10] son nathan you can see that it's
[1:05:12] described there in the circle as nathan
[1:05:14] and the scriptures describing what we
[1:05:16] call today in modern parlance a family
[1:05:19] tree
[1:05:21] and even here in isaiah 11 the tree is
[1:05:24] being used as a symbol of lineage and
[1:05:25] genealogy
[1:05:27] because i'm going to take the stump of
[1:05:29] jesse but i'm going to cause another
[1:05:31] shoot i'm going to cause a branch to
[1:05:32] come out that's going to be fruitful and
[1:05:34] multiply and it's the very christ is now
[1:05:36] being used as the beginning of another
[1:05:39] tree
[1:05:51] in revelations chapter 22 verse 16
[1:05:56] let's carry this forward now
[1:05:59] to
[1:06:02] in revelations chapter 22 verse 16.
[1:06:05] if you recall i i don't know if we did
[1:06:07] it in great detail and i've pondered
[1:06:08] maybe doing this showing how that the
[1:06:10] first three chapters of the bible
[1:06:13] have these incredible connections to the
[1:06:16] last three chapters of the bible there's
[1:06:18] things mentioned in the beginning
[1:06:20] that are mirrored in the end
[1:06:22] and there's reverse things happening
[1:06:24] and it's very remarkable how what
[1:06:26] happens in the seed chapter
[1:06:28] it's come to perfection and manifested
[1:06:30] and perfected in the last three so in
[1:06:32] revelations chapter 22 verse 16 i jesus
[1:06:35] have sent mine angel to testify unto you
[1:06:37] these unto you these things and the
[1:06:39] churches
[1:06:40] i am
[1:06:41] the root
[1:06:42] and the offspring of david and the
[1:06:45] bright and morning star
[1:06:47] the root that's the original seed the
[1:06:48] root the gene
[1:06:50] i am the source if you're the root
[1:06:51] you're the source of life the pando
[1:06:53] comes from one
[1:06:55] single root system one single root
[1:06:58] therefore everything that comes from it
[1:06:59] i am the vine you're the branches
[1:07:01] everything that comes from it is
[1:07:02] genetically identical
[1:07:05] did a supernatural dna test the new
[1:07:07] birth provides genetically uh
[1:07:10] identical offspring of god that's why he
[1:07:12] has no grandchildren
[1:07:14] so he says i'm the root now this is
[1:07:16] where it kind of gets a little
[1:07:17] interesting
[1:07:19] i'm the offspring
[1:07:21] so not only am i the original seed but
[1:07:23] i'm the expression i'm not only the gene
[1:07:24] but i'm the genos the kind i'm the
[1:07:26] species i'm the expression that comes
[1:07:28] after it now i'll just say state the
[1:07:29] obvious this is a paradox
[1:07:32] how can he be both the root
[1:07:34] but then also the fruit of david
[1:07:37] he can't be a literal
[1:07:40] family tree you can't be the root of
[1:07:43] david the family the tree that david
[1:07:45] comes from but then be the offspring of
[1:07:46] david that wouldn't make sense
[1:07:47] chronologically
[1:07:49] but watch how brother branham
[1:07:51] begins to tie these things in because
[1:07:52] this is at the very end of the bible
[1:07:54] bible says writes the church the tree of
[1:07:56] life
[1:07:57] isn't that a beautiful figure of speech
[1:08:00] it is mentioned three times in the book
[1:08:01] of genesis and three times in the book
[1:08:04] of revelation
[1:08:05] and in all six places it is the same
[1:08:07] tree and symbolizes exactly the same
[1:08:10] thing
[1:08:12] catches that he catches the three times
[1:08:14] in genesis the three times in the book
[1:08:15] of revelation we've already read some of
[1:08:16] these
[1:08:17] and he's saying that there's a symmetry
[1:08:19] there there's a connection it's the same
[1:08:21] tree symbolizes exactly the same thing
[1:08:24] so in genesis chapter 3 verses 22 to 24
[1:08:27] this is some of these instances it's
[1:08:29] mentioned and lord god said behold the
[1:08:31] man has become as one of us to know good
[1:08:34] and evil where'd that come from the tree
[1:08:36] of knowledge of good and evil now lest
[1:08:38] he put forth his hand and take also of
[1:08:41] the tree of life and eat and live
[1:08:43] forever
[1:08:45] we've already read in genesis 2 9 that
[1:08:47] was the first instance now he says take
[1:08:48] of the tree of life and eat and live
[1:08:50] forever there's a second instance
[1:08:51] therefore god sent him forth from the
[1:08:53] garden of eden what's happening he's
[1:08:54] been pushed out
[1:08:56] to till the ground from whence he was
[1:08:58] taken
[1:08:59] the man is a tree taken from the ground
[1:09:01] he's gonna have to go kill the ground
[1:09:03] from which he was taken in this very
[1:09:05] moment paradise is lost
[1:09:09] it's at this moment that he's been
[1:09:11] driven out away from the tree of life
[1:09:13] but what do we read in revelations 21
[1:09:15] paradise restored
[1:09:17] a garden of god the river running
[1:09:19] through it the tree of life being there
[1:09:20] it's paradise restored
[1:09:23] so in verse 24 you see the third time
[1:09:25] it's mentioned so he drove out the man
[1:09:28] and placed at the east of the garden of
[1:09:30] eden cherubims and a flaming sword which
[1:09:33] turned every way to keep the way of the
[1:09:36] tree of life
[1:09:38] it's the third time that's mentioned
[1:09:41] that now in genesis 3 they're barred
[1:09:44] from the tree of life but in revelations
[1:09:46] 22 as brother bannon brings out the
[1:09:48] symmetry it says verse 14 blessed are
[1:09:50] they that do his commandments which adam
[1:09:52] and eve didn't so blessed are they that
[1:09:54] do his commandments that they may have
[1:09:56] right to the tree of life and may enter
[1:09:59] in through the gates into the city
[1:10:02] just as the way was closed off and
[1:10:04] guarded by this flaming sword now notice
[1:10:07] in the end in revelations 22 that
[1:10:09] there's those that have a right to the
[1:10:11] tree of life closed off paradise
[1:10:13] paradise lost in genesis 3 paradise
[1:10:15] restored in revelation 21 now the tree
[1:10:17] of life being restored back in the
[1:10:19] garden of god in that eighth day that
[1:10:21] you may enter back into this
[1:10:26] now again i know these are a lot of
[1:10:27] details
[1:10:28] and i may not be connecting them just
[1:10:30] exactly together right now but this is
[1:10:32] sometimes what you see what's really
[1:10:34] neat sometimes you watch a mason or
[1:10:35] whatever they put i'm not pretending to
[1:10:36] be amazing but just put everything
[1:10:38] together and you're like well those
[1:10:39] don't all connect but then they just put
[1:10:41] that
[1:10:42] mortar over it this is the way they wash
[1:10:44] over it the way that all of a sudden
[1:10:45] everything's just seamless
[1:10:47] and i'm and and hopefully the holy
[1:10:49] spirit can do that part for you
[1:10:51] and genesis chapter 17 verses
[1:10:53] excuse me genesis chapter 3 verses 17 to
[1:10:56] 19.
[1:10:57] very very near my clothes here making
[1:10:59] but much better time than i thought i
[1:11:01] would
[1:11:02] genesis chapter 3 verses 17 to 19.
[1:11:05] now this is the curse to adam and i want
[1:11:07] to amplify this in more detail in the
[1:11:09] future lord willing at least i want to
[1:11:11] and says and unto adam he said because
[1:11:13] thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy
[1:11:15] wife and has eaten of the tree of which
[1:11:17] i commanded he saying thou shalt not eat
[1:11:19] of it remember the serpent is cursed the
[1:11:21] woman is cursed but now adam
[1:11:24] the the the one taken from the ground
[1:11:28] he's not directly cursed
[1:11:31] but says cursed is the ground for thy
[1:11:34] sake
[1:11:35] but remember it's the ground that he
[1:11:37] came out of
[1:11:38] and the ground that he's going to have
[1:11:40] to till according to genesis 2 23
[1:11:43] or 3 23
[1:11:45] so now cursed is the ground for thy sake
[1:11:47] in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the
[1:11:49] days of thy life
[1:11:51] thorns also and thistle shall it bring
[1:11:53] forth to thee and thou shalt eat the
[1:11:55] herb of the field in the sweat of thy
[1:11:57] face shalt thou eat bread till thou
[1:11:59] return unto the ground from out of it
[1:12:02] wast thou taken for dust thou art and
[1:12:04] unto dust shalt thou
[1:12:06] i return
[1:12:07] i i do want to amplify this further in
[1:12:09] the future but let me just try to
[1:12:10] articulate it this way
[1:12:12] adam could not be mingled
[1:12:17] adam's spirit could be muddied up
[1:12:20] and adam's could those channels could
[1:12:21] become clogged and that he that image
[1:12:25] of
[1:12:26] that image of god leave him but adam
[1:12:28] having already been made in the image of
[1:12:30] god there was a way that he was already
[1:12:32] formed
[1:12:34] and expressed to where he couldn't be
[1:12:36] unborn and then born again and
[1:12:38] regenerated and defiled here's adam as
[1:12:41] coming straight from god
[1:12:43] as a son now thrust into a foreign
[1:12:46] element to now fallen but yet he's a son
[1:12:49] of god in a fallen condition
[1:12:52] so god is portraying something very very
[1:12:54] remarkable in these verses
[1:12:56] where he curses the ground for thy sake
[1:12:58] what was cursed the soil
[1:13:01] adam is not cursed directly but the soil
[1:13:04] is cursed and he says that soil is going
[1:13:07] to bring forth thorns and thistles
[1:13:10] so what is god portraying adam you're
[1:13:12] going to fight with the earth all the
[1:13:14] days of your
[1:13:16] fight with thorns and thistles and
[1:13:18] you're gonna have to eat of it and he's
[1:13:19] speaking to adam's life but in adam's
[1:13:22] curse he's foreshadowing the curse that
[1:13:24] has come upon flesh
[1:13:27] because of the mingling because now this
[1:13:29] body that would have never brought forth
[1:13:31] a thorn has been mixed with another tree
[1:13:34] that in the mixing produces our thorny
[1:13:36] nature our thistles and our prickly
[1:13:38] sinful nature
[1:13:40] so he's foreshadowing the fallen human
[1:13:42] nature in this curse to adam adam is not
[1:13:45] cursed directly but the fallout of the
[1:13:48] original sin is going to produce a
[1:13:50] nature that is between according to
[1:13:52] satan's desire and his design and
[1:13:54] there's going to be a tree that doesn't
[1:13:56] bring forth the perfect fruit but it can
[1:13:58] put forth thorns
[1:14:01] and that's the curse that's the curse
[1:14:03] that's falling on all mankind
[1:14:05] so in galatians 3 13 it says christ hath
[1:14:08] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[1:14:11] being made a curse for us now christ has
[1:14:14] redeemed us from the curse how for it is
[1:14:17] written cursed as every one that hangeth
[1:14:19] on a tree
[1:14:22] even in the image of christ the tree of
[1:14:24] life being crucified on another
[1:14:27] shows us the very image of the original
[1:14:30] sin is being atoned for
[1:14:32] the tree of life
[1:14:34] hanging on a dead wood
[1:14:37] hanging on a tree that man is cut down
[1:14:38] here's the tree of life hanging on
[1:14:40] another cross hanging on another tree
[1:14:42] cursed is everyone that hangeth on the
[1:14:44] treats from deuteronomy 20 or 21 curses
[1:14:46] everyone that hangeth on a tree and
[1:14:48] here's christ hanging on that tree what
[1:14:50] is it it's christ the tree of life
[1:14:53] redeeming us from the curse of the mixed
[1:14:56] tree
[1:14:58] redeeming us from the curse of the
[1:15:00] ground that produces mixed fruit mixed
[1:15:02] trees mixed natures
[1:15:05] he redeemed us from the curse so we read
[1:15:07] it in our text in the beginning in
[1:15:09] revelations 22 2-3 in the midst of the
[1:15:12] street of it and on either side of the
[1:15:13] river was there the tree of life which
[1:15:16] bear 12 manners of fruit and yielded her
[1:15:18] fruit every month and the leaves of the
[1:15:20] tree before the healing of the nations
[1:15:22] and there shall be no more curse
[1:15:25] why because the tree of life hung upon a
[1:15:28] tree and was made a curse for us
[1:15:30] therefore this curse of genesis 3 17 is
[1:15:33] gone
[1:15:35] but the throne of god on the lamb shall
[1:15:36] be in it and his servant shall serve him
[1:15:39] because christ is that apple tree
[1:15:43] christ
[1:15:44] is the tree of life christ is likened
[1:15:46] unto a tree we could even see him in
[1:15:48] type in luke chapter 13
[1:15:50] verses 18 to 19. should i take a poll
[1:15:53] are you okay sister eliza you okay
[1:15:55] brother jack everybody staying with me i
[1:15:57] really feel like i'm close to stopping
[1:16:00] very close the harder you pull the
[1:16:01] louder you a man i might just quit
[1:16:04] is that the wrong kind of reverse
[1:16:05] psychology
[1:16:07] you get all the real word lovers going
[1:16:08] i'm gonna shut up
[1:16:13] but just let's just enter into this i'm
[1:16:14] i'm wanting to just have a climax with
[1:16:17] this just being very patient and
[1:16:18] prodding in this because i really do
[1:16:20] believe it just comes to a real
[1:16:21] beautiful place and we'll just leave it
[1:16:23] there but look in luke chapter 13 verses
[1:16:26] 18 to 19.
[1:16:28] it says then
[1:16:29] notice this parable then he said
[1:16:32] it said he under what is the kingdom of
[1:16:34] god like so now the kingdom of god in
[1:16:36] this parable and where shall i resemble
[1:16:38] it
[1:16:39] it is like a grain of mustard seed
[1:16:42] remember faith the size of a grain of a
[1:16:44] mustard seed
[1:16:45] is power to move mountains so now this
[1:16:46] that parallel to faith it is like a
[1:16:48] grain of mustard seed
[1:16:50] which would be the the seed of a mustard
[1:16:52] tree
[1:16:54] which a man took and cast into his
[1:16:56] garden
[1:16:57] and it grew
[1:16:59] and waxed a great tree and the fowls are
[1:17:02] there lodged in the branches of it
[1:17:07] christ is this great tree
[1:17:10] the seed that is sewn into the ground
[1:17:12] the seed of faith cast into the garden
[1:17:15] but when it grows it waxes a great tree
[1:17:17] let me say this this is our family tree
[1:17:21] this is not a family tree that has an
[1:17:23] earthly name attached to it this is not
[1:17:25] a family tree that honors a family
[1:17:27] legacy it is the tree of
[1:17:29] life it is christ
[1:17:31] and as it says that birds lodged in it
[1:17:34] and it
[1:17:35] whacks great
[1:17:37] this is our refuge
[1:17:39] this is the tree that we're a part of
[1:17:41] brother brahman the sermon investment
[1:17:43] says and that great tree that great tree
[1:17:45] of life when he come on earth they
[1:17:47] chopped it down did you catch that
[1:17:50] the tree of life now we said the cross
[1:17:53] that was a tree chopped down and
[1:17:55] fashioned into a cross we see the
[1:17:57] serpent chop down to go up on the ground
[1:18:00] and so we could see then the out the
[1:18:02] thing the tree of knowledge of good evil
[1:18:03] that was
[1:18:04] working on the serpent it's chopped down
[1:18:07] uh the woman you see all these images of
[1:18:09] trees
[1:18:10] right
[1:18:11] it's just a theme to get you to see
[1:18:12] something
[1:18:14] and
[1:18:15] now christ is the tree of life
[1:18:18] he's that apple tree and song of solomon
[1:18:21] he is he you say he's this mustard tree
[1:18:24] in type
[1:18:25] he's the tree of life he's this great
[1:18:27] tree
[1:18:28] and he's chopped down
[1:18:31] i'm using the language of brother
[1:18:32] branham
[1:18:34] he's a tree the great tree of life
[1:18:36] chopped down and hung up
[1:18:39] by a roman spear remember john 12 24
[1:18:43] unless a corner of wheat fallen to the
[1:18:45] ground and die it abideth alone
[1:18:48] so now
[1:18:49] he he expresses that that this tree this
[1:18:51] corn has got to be chopped down it has
[1:18:54] to be buried it has to be planted but
[1:18:55] what's going to grow back wax a great
[1:18:57] tree
[1:18:59] all from what
[1:19:01] one seed
[1:19:04] one seed
[1:19:05] one root
[1:19:07] a living organism genetically identical
[1:19:09] trees sprouting up and growing
[1:19:12] so he says chopped down by a roman spear
[1:19:14] and hung on a roman tree a cruel cursed
[1:19:16] tree but in there he redeemed a bride
[1:19:19] tree
[1:19:20] the bride tree one just like him
[1:19:24] that eve tree from the garden of eden
[1:19:26] that tree that had fallen eve in the
[1:19:28] beginning and adam walked out with her
[1:19:31] now adam comes with the second adam
[1:19:34] comes knowing that he had his eyes open
[1:19:36] to come to receive his eve
[1:19:40] just as adam the first adam walked out
[1:19:43] with the fallen tree now comes the tree
[1:19:45] of life and he's willingly chopped down
[1:19:48] to do what bring back the bride tree
[1:19:51] just as the rib was taken from adam tree
[1:19:54] and it produced a woman a man and a
[1:19:56] woman as trees and they never fulfilled
[1:19:58] god's command christ the tree of life is
[1:20:01] chopped down to do what bring forth
[1:20:04] another genetically identical tree the
[1:20:07] bride tree
[1:20:11] that's what
[1:20:12] i when i saw it in the scripture last
[1:20:14] week i just i wanted to do some sprints
[1:20:16] but i'm adverse to exercise
[1:20:20] and it says in luke chapter 23 verses 42
[1:20:23] and 43
[1:20:26] if you could catch this
[1:20:29] do i have those scriptures in there
[1:20:30] brother john
[1:20:32] i thought i had him in there there there
[1:20:34] he says and he said unto jesus look at
[1:20:36] that now i have to set this up i'm
[1:20:37] getting too excited
[1:20:39] he's hanging on the cross
[1:20:41] he's between two malefactors two thieves
[1:20:44] and the one on the left is railing at
[1:20:46] him
[1:20:47] right
[1:20:48] he he he said uh if you're the son of
[1:20:50] god do this and do that here they're all
[1:20:52] hanging on a tree hey well if you're the
[1:20:54] if you could do this you know you should
[1:20:56] do something but then the one on the
[1:20:57] right
[1:21:00] he
[1:21:01] he said unto jesus lord remember me when
[1:21:04] thou comest and do thy kingdom
[1:21:07] and notice what jesus says you want to
[1:21:09] know this is where we see the tree of
[1:21:11] life
[1:21:12] hanging hanging on that cross
[1:21:17] being chopped down
[1:21:19] and he says verily i said to thee today
[1:21:22] thou shalt be with me
[1:21:24] in paradise
[1:21:25] what was being consecrated on that cross
[1:21:29] what way was being made on that cross
[1:21:31] that he could sit there and say to the
[1:21:33] thief on his right when
[1:21:35] with this tree of life is cut down
[1:21:38] sacrifices made the bloody lamb of
[1:21:41] genesis 3
[1:21:42] has come into fulfillment the the the
[1:21:44] seed of the woman in genesis 3 15 is
[1:21:47] hanging on the cross the tree of life
[1:21:50] has come back again and it's being split
[1:21:52] open and now though you're a thief in
[1:21:54] the image of fallen man
[1:21:56] paradise is being restored the tree of
[1:21:59] life has made a way again
[1:22:02] unless we not catch the significance of
[1:22:04] it in the time that we're living in and
[1:22:06] the day that we're living in right now
[1:22:09] and i meant to provide the picture and i
[1:22:10] apologize but we're familiar with the
[1:22:13] hoffman's head of christ
[1:22:15] it's it's taken from a larger picture
[1:22:17] hoffman's rich young ruler painting
[1:22:20] and in the the meeting of christ and the
[1:22:21] rich young ruler christ is looking to
[1:22:24] his left to the rich young ruler who's
[1:22:26] rejecting christ
[1:22:29] and so in the original hoffman's head of
[1:22:31] christ
[1:22:32] and the rich young there's a meeting
[1:22:33] with one who comes face to face with
[1:22:35] christ and rejects the opportunity to
[1:22:37] eternal life a meeting with the tree of
[1:22:38] life and he turns away rejecting and the
[1:22:41] thief on the cross it was a thief on the
[1:22:44] left that turned against him but when he
[1:22:46] appeared in the cloud today
[1:22:48] when he came in our time he's not
[1:22:50] looking to his left he's looking to his
[1:22:53] right
[1:22:54] because to the left the rich young ruler
[1:22:56] was rejected to the left the the thief
[1:22:58] on the cross rejected him but now he's
[1:23:00] looking to the right where he pardoned
[1:23:02] the thief on the cross and said this day
[1:23:05] you'll be with me in paradise this is
[1:23:08] his face
[1:23:09] this is representing something to us
[1:23:11] revelations 22 4 and they shall see his
[1:23:14] face and his name shall be in their
[1:23:16] foreheads what does it tell us here we
[1:23:18] are in the end restore back to the
[1:23:21] garden of god back to the paradise again
[1:23:25] on the doorstep of a complete
[1:23:27] transformation into an eighth day
[1:23:35] he brings it to
[1:23:38] christ let me just read this in closing
[1:23:39] musicians if he could come
[1:23:41] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:23:43] revealed
[1:23:45] he says he is that tree of life
[1:23:48] contrary to the serpent seed
[1:23:50] which would be a mixed tree
[1:23:53] mixture of woods
[1:23:54] right
[1:23:58] he's the seed the woman seed the tree of
[1:24:00] life in
[1:24:02] the garden
[1:24:04] i took just a little bit out just for
[1:24:06] brevity
[1:24:07] says and he's the only tree that can be
[1:24:09] taken that you can live forever
[1:24:11] his word is life
[1:24:13] and that would be the word then the word
[1:24:15] of god which eve turn down in the garden
[1:24:18] of eden
[1:24:20] then here is christ the word made
[1:24:22] manifest and when he come on earth he
[1:24:24] was the tree of life
[1:24:26] and rome what did they do he had chopped
[1:24:28] he had to be chopped down the tree of
[1:24:30] life christ chopped down and raised up
[1:24:34] a curse he's chopped down he was put on
[1:24:35] a tree of disgrace cursed is he that
[1:24:37] hang on a tree become a curse for the
[1:24:39] human race and now through that he
[1:24:42] brings forth the bride tree
[1:24:45] and what is the what is the bride tree
[1:24:47] this is his definition of a bright tree
[1:24:48] which will be the tree of life
[1:24:52] the bride tree which will be the tree of
[1:24:53] life restored back to him as husband and
[1:24:56] wife in the garden of eden by the same
[1:24:58] word the same god made manifest in
[1:25:01] husband and wife the same bride tree
[1:25:03] back
[1:25:04] again
[1:25:06] what is it genetically identical
[1:25:12] what i wanted to emphasize today in this
[1:25:15] was that christ
[1:25:18] is our family tree
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:21] only in christ that this makes sense
[1:25:24] this is not
[1:25:25] this is not a memorial to any kind of
[1:25:29] movement of man
[1:25:31] it's not a cult of personality
[1:25:34] it's in recognition it's it's a meeting
[1:25:37] of christ a coming together
[1:25:40] i i shared that instance of the cloud
[1:25:42] because i believe it's significant
[1:25:45] i believe it's absolutely significant
[1:25:47] the continuity with scripture what was
[1:25:49] expressed in the king's countenance
[1:25:51] there's life
[1:25:55] my son
[1:25:56] jack last week was in service and they
[1:25:58] were playing a slideshow and in the
[1:26:00] slideshow there came up a
[1:26:02] the cloud
[1:26:04] and jack leaned over to his sister
[1:26:06] listen he says mom what is that
[1:26:08] and she said oh that's the that's a
[1:26:10] picture that was a cloud that was in the
[1:26:12] sky and it's in the shape and outline of
[1:26:14] the head of christ and jack says
[1:26:16] he said i can't remember just exactly he
[1:26:18] says mom all i know
[1:26:20] is i feel like that cloud is my life
[1:26:24] when christ who is our life shall appear
[1:26:27] in the light of the king's countenance
[1:26:28] there is life and just a seven-year-old
[1:26:31] boy a good number seven he's he's seen
[1:26:33] this as i feel that in this is life this
[1:26:36] is my life this is not a trivial thing
[1:26:39] i've been pondering uh to to a great
[1:26:41] extent here recently
[1:26:43] that
[1:26:45] you don't have to lie about the message
[1:26:46] to reject it
[1:26:48] be honest with it
[1:26:50] be honest with the message there's
[1:26:52] things brother venom taught we don't
[1:26:53] need to try to change it massage it
[1:26:55] and reject it because of this and that
[1:26:57] and try to re-cobble together the
[1:26:58] message with all of our removing all the
[1:27:01] continuity errors and removing all what
[1:27:02] we think is it can't be exactly
[1:27:04] explained this way and this doesn't make
[1:27:05] sense take it as it is and if you can't
[1:27:07] just take it as it is walk away from it
[1:27:10] nobody's forcing you to do this
[1:27:12] but if you're like no i feel forced to
[1:27:13] do this then just take it as it is take
[1:27:15] it as god has expressed it
[1:27:18] people reject it
[1:27:20] by their own analysis and reason and
[1:27:22] they can't they can't digest it and and
[1:27:25] that's that's absolutely fine
[1:27:27] my objection is when you lie about it
[1:27:31] and you try to change what he taught to
[1:27:32] change his personality change his person
[1:27:35] to reject it there's enough there to
[1:27:36] work off of where if you don't believe
[1:27:38] that's bible you have every right to
[1:27:39] walk away
[1:27:41] god forbid that we don't just try to go
[1:27:43] through and change it so we can have an
[1:27:44] excuse to stay
[1:27:49] all right who needed that
[1:27:52] we're one we're this is our family tree
[1:27:56] and i i trust that next time we can get
[1:27:58] into getting this in greater detail
[1:28:01] because
[1:28:02] oh i'm just thrilled
[1:28:04] i'm so excited
[1:28:06] and what are we what are we expressing a
[1:28:07] vision of the church
[1:28:09] vision for your family and what did we
[1:28:11] see in revelations 22 vision of home
[1:28:14] let's stand today
