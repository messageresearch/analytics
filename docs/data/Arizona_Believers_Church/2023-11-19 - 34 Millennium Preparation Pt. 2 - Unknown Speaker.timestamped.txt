[0:00] I want to continue on the thought of
[0:01] Millennium
[0:03] preparation and in doing so I put just
[0:07] pause just for a few uh just for this
[0:09] service on this subject of Kingdom
[0:12] Builders that we've been on for a couple
[0:14] services we' ministered on Millennium
[0:15] preparation on Wednesday night a couple
[0:18] weeks ago and I wanted to kind of wrap
[0:20] up a thought on this it still ties into
[0:21] the overall theme that we've been
[0:23] ministering on on the kingdom and in the
[0:26] in the very beginning we were looking at
[0:28] how there was a mystery of Heaven that
[0:30] is actually going to be manifested in
[0:32] the earth and that manifestation of the
[0:33] mystery is the earth glory and the Earth
[0:36] had a purpose and over the last several
[0:38] Services we've been using uh brother
[0:41] bram's thought in the future home of the
[0:43] Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[0:46] bride and how that there was a this
[0:49] emphasis on the Plan of Redemption said
[0:51] if there's I could just get one thing
[0:53] over to you if you could just catch one
[0:55] thing in this service I want it to be
[0:56] the Plan of Redemption and he was
[0:58] identifying this three three-stage
[1:00] process of redemption of our souls and
[1:03] how that that God did a similar process
[1:05] to the earth the earth having not a soul
[1:08] but still Redemption for it there was a
[1:09] three-stage process of redemption for
[1:11] the Earth and we've been building off of
[1:14] that looking at how that though this uh
[1:16] stages of redemption are in threes and
[1:18] we have a three-stage process of
[1:20] redemption for our souls that it
[1:22] manifests in such great ways you don't
[1:24] say well I'm saved a and and that's it
[1:27] you don't just say well I'm I'm filled
[1:29] with the Holy Ghost I'm a son or
[1:30] daughter of God and we say well that's
[1:31] just kind of it we have a nomination or
[1:34] we're we're new creatures and there's
[1:36] nothing that goes with it no it's just
[1:37] the beginning when you're filled with
[1:39] the Holy Ghost that's really the
[1:41] beginning because you've secured your
[1:43] Eternal salvation and you and you're now
[1:45] walking in the grace of God and so it's
[1:47] we've been looking at how that if this
[1:49] is what God does to the individual and
[1:51] this is what God does to the Earth think
[1:53] about all the things that layer on top
[1:55] of that and we've been identifying how
[1:57] that the whole Earth shall be full of
[1:59] the knowledge of God God and that's
[2:00] because of this process of redemption
[2:02] and so for ourselves too when we should
[2:04] desire to be full the fullness of God be
[2:07] in us and that we desire to be fully
[2:09] possessed by God and those are been some
[2:11] of the things that we've been using and
[2:13] using the Redemption of the earth to
[2:14] show a type of the work of the holy
[2:16] spirit in us now so if you just look at
[2:19] verse six with me where we just read I
[2:21] hope you have the right slideshow there
[2:23] I thought I'd um change the title slide
[2:25] that's a good sign that we have that
[2:27] scripture I could have just accidentally
[2:29] sent the long slideshow but it looks
[2:30] like we've got it right so here in
[2:32] Revelations chap 20: 6 we're looking at
[2:36] the Millennium so I want to do some
[2:37] summary very quickly on this Thousand
[2:39] Years blessed and holy is he that hath
[2:41] part in the First Resurrection on such
[2:43] the second death hath no power but they
[2:46] shall be Priests of God and of Christ
[2:48] and shall reign with him a thousand
[2:51] years this is the millennial reign of
[2:53] Christ and his bride the king and queen
[2:56] we call it the Millennium and we call
[2:58] things Millennial because it's a
[2:59] Thousand-Year Reign and there's a
[3:02] difference in this rign and the Eternal
[3:05] Reign so in eternity if we want to put
[3:08] it that way the eighth day that's the
[3:11] future home brother Brandman ministers
[3:12] about that's the perfect Eden it's a
[3:14] perfect Kingdom it's a perfect age yet
[3:17] the millennial Reign is not the eighth
[3:19] day but still the seventh day it is a
[3:21] restored Eden it is the honeymoon as
[3:24] brother B calls it of the of the Bride
[3:26] In Christ it's a rest but it's still in
[3:29] time
[3:30] it's not eternity yet it still has time
[3:33] and we know that there's still sin that
[3:34] exist um to be dealt with after the
[3:37] Millennium and so it's not eternity
[3:40] we've been looking at that this
[3:41] Millennial Reign this seventh day is not
[3:43] eternity and brother BR makes this
[3:46] statement about it there you are there's
[3:47] the paradise of God the light of the
[3:49] world the perfect Kingdom he's talking
[3:50] about the future home not the seventh
[3:53] day the Eternal one not the
[3:56] Millennium he says the new Earth right
[4:00] while it's going through the Millennium
[4:02] it's going through its sanctifying
[4:03] process but still must be burned that's
[4:06] quite a statement he's saying it still
[4:08] must be completely all sin annihilated
[4:11] and there must become this melting and
[4:13] this bringing forth of new Heaven and
[4:15] new earth and he identifies that very
[4:17] particularly uh right before we see in
[4:20] Revelations 21 the new heaven uh the New
[4:23] Jerusalem coming down out of Heaven from
[4:25] God and even this new city being
[4:27] established upon Earth brother bram's
[4:29] just showing you that what we're looking
[4:30] at in the future hes The Eighth Day not
[4:32] the Millennium and he calls the
[4:34] Millennium a sanctifying process it's
[4:37] still going through its sanctifying
[4:38] process but there's still another uh
[4:41] transition that needs to take place so
[4:43] this reign of
[4:45] righteousness and peace that we look at
[4:47] in the Millennium is not eternity it's
[4:51] not after that final renovation of
[4:53] Heaven and Earth for the last time it's
[4:56] not after the all the atmospheres are
[4:58] burnt up and the brother said the whole
[5:00] surface has changed it's still uh it's
[5:03] still before that right and when we look
[5:07] been looking at that we've been looking
[5:08] at how that there's uh the whole Earth
[5:09] shall be full of the knowledge of God it
[5:11] shall be full of the light of God this
[5:13] takes place before the Earth's final
[5:16] stage of redemption and the Earth not
[5:19] having a soul we wanting you to think of
[5:20] it this way that in the three-stage
[5:22] process of redemption that renovation of
[5:24] the earth is a type of our body change
[5:27] because it's going to receive a new body
[5:29] everything's completely change the
[5:30] surface is going to be changed so we're
[5:32] wanting you to think about how once your
[5:34] soul is redeemed there's still this
[5:37] process of redemption taking place in
[5:39] our lives where we can see the reign of
[5:42] righteousness in our lives we can see a
[5:44] reign of peace in our lives and we can
[5:46] enter into rest as
[5:48] Believers because it takes place before
[5:51] uh the change of our body even and we so
[5:54] we're wanting to identify this parallel
[5:55] of the reign of Christ even in the
[5:58] Millennium and his reain in Us in the
[6:01] bride before the change of our bodies
[6:03] now as brother B says that the Earth is
[6:05] going through a sanctifying process and
[6:07] it still must be burned I want to uh
[6:10] turn to Malachi chapter
[6:13] 4 and I want to read uh a few places
[6:17] with some lengthy script scripture
[6:19] readings today not that we'll break it
[6:21] down uh in great detail but so we can
[6:24] enter it into the record record and you
[6:27] can see uh some principles that we
[6:30] believe and kind of hopefully place them
[6:32] chronologically in a way that makes uh
[6:35] sense and use to us in Malachi chapter 4
[6:38] we'll go ahead and read the whole thing
[6:40] for behold the day cometh that shall
[6:42] burn as an oven it's the day that comes
[6:44] that shall burn the day shall burn as an
[6:46] oven and all the proud yay and all that
[6:48] do wickedly shall be stubble so they're
[6:51] going to be reduced down they're going
[6:52] to be burnt up as you would think of a
[6:54] field uh something being burned up and
[6:56] the day that cometh shall burn them up
[6:59] sayith the Lord of hosts that it shall
[7:00] leave them neither root nor Branch so
[7:03] there's something being eradicated
[7:05] through this but unto you that fear my
[7:07] name shall the son of righteousness
[7:09] arise with healing in his wings and ye
[7:12] shall go forth and grow up as calves of
[7:15] the star what a contrast in those that
[7:17] are being burnt down to nothing but then
[7:19] there's a son of righteousness that's
[7:21] going to be revealed and he has healing
[7:22] in his wings and you're going to grow up
[7:24] he says and ye shall tread down the
[7:26] wicked for they shall be ashes under the
[7:28] souls of your feet in the day that I
[7:31] shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts
[7:33] that's quite an
[7:34] image the th those who have received
[7:37] this son of righteousness are going to
[7:38] walk out and the wicked's ashes are
[7:42] going to be under their feet says
[7:44] remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[7:46] this is very connected these first few
[7:48] verses now rest upon these next few
[7:50] verses remember ye the law of Moses my
[7:53] servant which I commanded unto him in
[7:54] horb for all Israel with the statutes
[7:56] and judgments it's Commandment that he
[7:58] would send a Prophet behold I will send
[8:01] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[8:03] of the great and Dreadful day of the
[8:05] Lord and this Dreadful day it's speaking
[8:08] of is this day that cometh that shall
[8:10] burn as an oven and he shall turn the
[8:12] heart of the fathers to the children and
[8:14] the Heart of the children to their
[8:15] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[8:18] with a curse and we covered this on a
[8:21] little bit it may have actually been in
[8:23] different series early this year on how
[8:24] the Earth had a purpose and the Earth's
[8:27] purpose brother man said was to get a
[8:28] bride out of it
[8:30] and so God creation was for the purpose
[8:33] of God expressing his attributes to his
[8:35] bride so the very purpose of the earth
[8:37] is for God to be expressed and to bring
[8:39] forth the bride and it says the very
[8:42] last words of the Old Testament is the
[8:44] Spectre of the Earth being condemned and
[8:46] laid waste and destroyed because says I
[8:49] I I I'm going to come and smite the
[8:50] Earth with the
[8:52] curse and as we use the example of Jesus
[8:55] cursing the Fig Tree because it hadn't
[8:57] produced a fig so the Earth if it
[8:59] doesn't produce a bride it has not
[9:01] served God's purpose so he's going to
[9:03] curse it so Elijah comes and Elijah's
[9:06] Ministry introduces the living bread of
[9:09] life which brings forth the bride and
[9:11] the bride having come forth the Earth
[9:13] can say ah we did it we satisfied our
[9:16] purpose and the Earth having served its
[9:18] purpose there's a Plan of Redemption for
[9:20] it and so the bride raises up as the
[9:23] glory of the earth and the Mystery of
[9:25] Heaven revealed and God will not Smite
[9:27] the Earth with a curse because he sent
[9:29] Elijah the prophet that accelerates
[9:31] these things and brings forth the bride
[9:34] so that's the that's the end of that
[9:36] chapter but now that they've come forth
[9:38] and as they're coming forth and they're
[9:40] coming back to the earth when they come
[9:42] back to the Earth it says they're
[9:43] walking on the ashes of the wicked
[9:45] brother Bradman the sermon trying to do
[9:47] God a service without being the will of
[9:49] God he brings a couple scriptures
[9:51] together he says remember Sodom burned
[9:54] well this world is to burn Jesus said so
[9:56] and it'll be a time like Luke 17 chapter
[9:59] 30th verse in the days it'll be like
[10:01] Sodom and Gomorrah then the son of man
[10:03] would be revealed and in that day God
[10:05] reigned fire and brimstone out of heaven
[10:07] and destroyed them all and destroyed
[10:08] Sodom and Gomorrah so there was a
[10:10] judgment there was a burning that took
[10:11] place upon the wicked who had not
[10:13] escaped and he says and then and then
[10:16] what would happen according to Malachi
[10:19] he will burn the Earth again and the
[10:21] righteous in the Millennium will walk
[10:23] out upon the ashes of the wicked and see
[10:27] where brother bam is placed in this he's
[10:30] saying that after the bride is raptured
[10:32] and tribulation is set in that there's
[10:33] going before the bride returns back
[10:35] there's some burning that takes place
[10:38] and once that burning has is over the
[10:40] bride's going to return back and it's
[10:42] using it in symbolic ways and I don't
[10:44] know that we need to be very very
[10:46] literal uh that you're going to be going
[10:48] oh you know that we you know I've got
[10:49] all these ashes but it's it's showing
[10:51] that they're going to be reduced there's
[10:53] going to be a reduction there's going to
[10:54] be a burning up and the bride's going to
[10:56] return after that time for the
[10:58] millennium
[10:59] now now we have all these different
[11:01] burnings right and say well I know the E
[11:03] day and but we're just going to try to
[11:04] place these in an order so you can see
[11:07] that when God does something uh God will
[11:09] do something in one place and he'll do
[11:10] it in another place and it's very
[11:11] important that we not conflate the two
[11:14] there is a first coming a second coming
[11:15] and a third coming we want to make sure
[11:17] that we got those in the right order
[11:18] right some are still looking for his
[11:19] first coming right the Jews would be but
[11:22] we know that one's already happening
[11:23] some people are looking for his third
[11:25] coming coming uh thinking it's going to
[11:27] be the second and we know brother cors
[11:29] that order and so we're looking at
[11:31] different instances where the Earth is
[11:32] even renovated and we're and we're even
[11:34] seeing in the scripture that it can be a
[11:36] new Earth but yet it doesn't mean it's
[11:38] totally annihilated and yet there could
[11:40] be another season where it's changed
[11:42] again and here we see in the scripture
[11:45] that the righteous are going to walk out
[11:46] on the ashes of the wicked is the way we
[11:48] kind of summarize that and brother says
[11:50] that's in the
[11:52] Millennium after their Earth has been
[11:54] burned now if you'll turn to Revelations
[11:57] chap 6 let's read verses 12 12 to
[12:00] 17 and I'm hoping that I could just
[12:02] bring this straight through the message
[12:04] of the hour so you'll know what brother
[12:06] brand I'm taught on this I think that's
[12:08] what's important is you that you know
[12:10] what he taught I it's and I I mean it's
[12:14] not important that you know what I think
[12:15] about it or my opinion on it it's most
[12:17] important that you know what brother
[12:18] Bram taught about it and that the Holy
[12:20] Spirit would Quicken that to you I I
[12:22] take a lot of comfort in just teaching
[12:24] to you what the messenger says and I
[12:26] don't feel like this burden to try to
[12:28] clear it up for you
[12:29] and try to make perfect sense of it I
[12:31] think when people do that they end up uh
[12:33] they end up leaning too far to one side
[12:35] and causing more confusion and so if I
[12:37] could just show you what brother bradam
[12:39] said we'll be in a good place so now in
[12:41] Revelations 6: 12-1 17 and beheld be I
[12:45] and I beheld when he had opened the
[12:47] Sixth Seal and lo there was a great
[12:49] earthquake just notice kind of these
[12:51] symbolic descriptions Revelation the
[12:53] book of symbols is now showing us these
[12:55] different events that have um some
[12:57] interpretation to them they have some
[12:58] ual coming to pass there was a great
[13:00] earthquake and the sun became black as
[13:02] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[13:04] blood and the stars of Heaven fell under
[13:07] the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her
[13:09] untimely figs when she is shaken of A
[13:12] Mighty Wind so notice it's using these
[13:13] elements of nature in the earth and the
[13:15] heavens and the Earth and uh creation
[13:17] showing uh this Interruption of Nature
[13:21] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[13:23] it is when it's rolled together and the
[13:25] Heaven and the the and every mountain
[13:27] and Island were moved out of their place
[13:28] say this is quite a a renovation quite a
[13:30] change a shaking and the kings of the
[13:33] earth and the great men and the rich men
[13:34] and the chief captains and the Mighty
[13:35] Men And every Bond Man and every free
[13:38] man hid themselves in the dens and in
[13:39] the rocks of the mountains and said to
[13:41] the mountains and rocks fall on us and
[13:43] hide us from the face of him that sth on
[13:45] the throne and from the Wrath of the
[13:48] Lamb so this is a this is a judgment
[13:50] being poured out this is a this is uh
[13:54] like a burning of Sodom and gomorah this
[13:56] is like it was in the days of Noah when
[13:58] the floods covered the Earth this is
[14:00] Judgment upon those upon the Earth for
[14:02] the great day of his wrath has come and
[14:04] who shall be able to
[14:06] stand that's quite quite a scripture uh
[14:10] that tells us of the events that
[14:12] transpire these things that we see once
[14:14] that Sixth Seal is opened now in the
[14:17] seventh seal brother brandham says this
[14:19] he says notice there's a the whole earth
[14:21] is to be
[14:22] purged there'll be such a thing that the
[14:25] Moons and stars and all nature will be
[14:27] purged and this l anguage he's using to
[14:29] be is important you see what it is the
[14:31] Earth is renewing herself being purged
[14:34] getting ready for the
[14:36] Millennium the millennium's coming up
[14:38] and see everything that's got any filth
[14:40] in it to be purged during The Sixth Seal
[14:43] now do you notice on the open of the
[14:45] seventh seal it's also in a three-fold
[14:47] mystery this is brother I'm identify
[14:50] that when The Sixth Seal is opened he
[14:52] said there's this purging as the Bible
[14:54] says that a great earthquake and the Sun
[14:56] is black as sackcloth and the moon
[14:57] becomes as blood and the Fig as a fig
[14:59] tree uh casts its untimely figs because
[15:01] of the wind the stars of the heaven are
[15:03] going to fall uh the heavens depart the
[15:05] mountain and Island are moved and all
[15:06] these descriptions men trying to hide
[15:08] himself this day of Wrath brother calls
[15:10] it a purging time something he says here
[15:12] that I think is very important he says
[15:14] the Earth is renewing herself getting
[15:16] ready for the Millennium there's this
[15:19] time before the Millennium sets in
[15:21] there's this renewal that's taking place
[15:23] in the
[15:24] earth and and he's saying this is uh
[15:27] this is tied to these this description
[15:29] in The Sixth Seal in the Third Exodus he
[15:31] says now I want you to notice and I'm
[15:33] reading from several places again
[15:35] because I think it's important to see
[15:36] that it's not just one place where he
[15:38] says it but he says it enough times and
[15:40] there's a little bit there's enough
[15:41] material there that we can work with
[15:43] where the Lord can Quicken something to
[15:45] you or you can have some idea of what
[15:46] brother bram's saying in the third exod
[15:49] he says I want you to notice this same
[15:50] pillar fire is leading the people again
[15:52] to a promised land in the
[15:55] Millennium where we found under the
[15:57] inspiration of this six sucal it's never
[15:59] been taught before how the Earth has to
[16:02] be purified for the Millennium the
[16:04] pillar of fires leading them to lead
[16:07] leading them to a millennium now that
[16:10] this is quite a a a statement that the
[16:14] Earth has to be purified for the
[16:16] Millennium I say it's quite a statement
[16:17] it just it's showing that makes sense
[16:19] right that must be some purification
[16:21] that takes place uh could you just
[16:24] imagine uh coming back to Earth and
[16:27] having to uh and knowing that there's
[16:28] still a a Sin City in in Nevada Nevada
[16:32] Nevada however you say it we know that
[16:34] these things are going to be completely
[16:35] changed Going to there's going to be
[16:36] something that is going to be cleaned up
[16:38] and purified this Millennial cleansing
[16:40] this cleansing for the Millennium the
[16:42] Earth has to be purified for the
[16:43] Millennium so the pillar fire is leading
[16:45] the people to the promised land and God
[16:48] before we would come to this promised
[16:51] land and before we'd come back to the
[16:53] Earth there's a purging he's using this
[16:54] term purging a purifying of the Earth
[16:57] for us to to come back to in the
[16:59] Millennium this isn't the eighth day
[17:01] this is before that time because there's
[17:03] still going to be things that transpire
[17:05] for the Thousand Years things that take
[17:06] place even before that 8 day uh that 8
[17:09] days that's the totality finality there
[17:10] will never be anything anymore uh to
[17:13] interrupt in the sermon conferences
[17:15] you'll notice that these dates are all
[17:16] very close together here in 63 says
[17:18] there is no more hopes we can't build
[17:21] nothing all the nations have Atomic
[17:23] hydrant poison bombs astronauts and
[17:25] everything Lord the whole world is
[17:27] quivering and shaking it's going to be
[17:29] purified pretty soon and get ready for a
[17:31] great
[17:32] Millennium talk about the Earth she's
[17:34] going to shake to pieces she's tottering
[17:36] now like a drunk man staggering home at
[17:38] midnight in the darkness she don't know
[17:39] where she's
[17:40] going the Earth is quivering
[17:44] shaking there's going to be things that
[17:46] are going to take place and
[17:48] transform says she's going to be
[17:50] purified pretty soon to get ready for
[17:54] that thousand years and the sermon
[17:56] Victory Day says when she comes to the
[17:57] battle of armag eddon that'll settle the
[18:00] whole thing just before the great
[18:02] Millennium Armageddon is to clean off
[18:05] the earth now that's gives maybe a
[18:06] little bit more detail to it just before
[18:08] the great Millennium Armageddon to clean
[18:10] off the Earth she rep purifies herself
[18:13] with this Atomic blowing and the
[18:15] volcanic ash and things s things sinks
[18:19] this soaked blood of men and upon the
[18:21] Earth and sin and crime she sinks
[18:24] beneath the earth and the volcanic
[18:26] braids out again and renews and cleans
[18:28] the Earth for the great
[18:30] Millennium why what a what a what a
[18:33] description there's going to be a
[18:35] millennium and she re the Earth rep
[18:37] purifies herself and and I think that
[18:40] there's there's a description here we
[18:41] just can get this concept that well it's
[18:43] going to happen some way and he says
[18:45] this Atomic
[18:46] blowing and then he says volcanic ash
[18:50] and and so there could be these atomic
[18:52] bombs could break up things and Vol
[18:53] volcanoes could explode and and things
[18:57] take place upon the Earth Earth and all
[18:58] these seismic conditions and
[19:00] circumstances to where the earth now
[19:03] through this these atomic bombs and
[19:05] these fracturing of things and these
[19:06] bursting forth of geysers and volcanoes
[19:09] and things exploding uh that things
[19:11] completely turn over and change and he
[19:14] calls it a rep purifying and then the
[19:17] world has fallen apart he takes his text
[19:19] from Revelations chapter 6 when he
[19:21] preaches the world is falling apart and
[19:22] he says how many sins were committed in
[19:24] this city last night wasn't it better
[19:27] when the coyote howed down through the
[19:29] desert here and God looked upon it when
[19:31] the old hop and Navajo went through here
[19:33] on his trellis then look at this filth
[19:36] and just gum and traditions and
[19:39] politics so we think we've improved it
[19:42] he say no we've made it worse he said
[19:45] it's bleeding nasty mess that stinks in
[19:47] God's nose corrupted before him he'll
[19:49] blow it to Pieces some of these days and
[19:52] he'll burst forth the Earth and she'll
[19:54] she will renew herself with volcanic
[19:57] eruption and they'll come a millennium
[20:00] then are you catching kind of the
[20:02] order because I can even remember that
[20:04] um there was a question uh asked uh when
[20:07] we were ministering on the future home
[20:09] and how this total Annihilation brother
[20:10] Brandman the future home makes it very
[20:11] very clear that there's going to be some
[20:13] renovation of the earth and the new
[20:15] Heaven and new earth is not a doing away
[20:16] of the old word that just explodes into
[20:18] Oblivion and it's not there and then God
[20:20] creates again he said no it's a
[20:22] transformation or regeneration of the
[20:23] earth that was and the heavens that were
[20:26] and how that there's going to be a
[20:27] burning in a melting Pro in Prophecy and
[20:30] the question was well I thought that
[20:31] took place before the Millennium and
[20:34] it's because there is a process that
[20:36] takes place before the
[20:37] Millennium and we're looking at here
[20:39] another another change that takes place
[20:42] and he says and they come there'll come
[20:44] a millennium where the righteous will
[20:46] walk out upon the ashes of the wicked
[20:48] according now
[20:50] Malachi so brother Brandon when he's
[20:52] talking about that day that when the
[20:53] scripture says a day will come that
[20:55] shall burn as an oven there's going to
[20:57] be Volcan canic Ash and explosions and a
[20:59] burning and something take place here
[21:01] upon the Earth to rep purify it to purge
[21:04] it to cleanse it to renew it for the
[21:09] Millennium he's placing this the time of
[21:12] Malachi 4 and the sermon look he says
[21:14] Noah had an experience of this he's
[21:16] looking at that renewing of the earth he
[21:18] says he by faith saw the coming of the
[21:20] flood a great rain that was going to
[21:22] cover the Earth and wash off the Earth
[21:24] the rededication again to God
[21:30] quite a statement the filth of the world
[21:32] that the people had got in in that
[21:33] conglomeration that they were in in that
[21:35] day had to all be washed off to start
[21:38] again so again we can use the days of
[21:40] Noah as an example of how that God wiped
[21:42] off the Earth and the Earth came forth
[21:44] as new and that was because the the
[21:47] things that had been added to it and all
[21:49] the sin and all the unrighteous had been
[21:51] wiped off so it emerged A New Earth as
[21:54] the Bible even suggest and he says and
[21:57] so now it's going to be washed off again
[21:59] is what he's pointing to and I just
[22:00] finished the series of services on the
[22:02] last Seven Seals and find in The Sixth
[22:03] Seal that there's a great interruption
[22:06] in nature the moon the stars the Earth
[22:08] belches forth the church is purged
[22:11] Israel is purged and everything is
[22:12] purged is under that seventh seal so
[22:14] that the Millennium can start in we know
[22:17] as we read it in the Sixth Seal he says
[22:19] it's purged under that seventh seal
[22:21] there's certainly a type to that as we
[22:23] see as he's identifying here he says so
[22:26] that the Millennium can start in there
[22:28] has to be a cleansing first are you
[22:31] keeping some of these thoughts in mind
[22:33] rep purifying renewing cleansing purging
[22:35] these things he says there has to be a
[22:37] cleansing first and that's what the
[22:39] church today and what I want to point to
[22:41] you that we need a
[22:44] cleansing before anything can begin from
[22:47] God we got to have a purging and we look
[22:50] and see things that is now under the
[22:52] present conditions exist in the way they
[22:54] are we can see that we've got to have
[22:56] something to happen before God can
[22:58] continue his program and a
[23:02] purging quite a
[23:04] statement and the quieter statements
[23:06] becoming the statement for today I guess
[23:09] we could see that we've got to have
[23:11] something to happen before God can
[23:12] continue his program and a purging
[23:15] hopefully you've been writing all these
[23:16] quite a statements down to see this
[23:19] pattern as he showing the Earth is to be
[23:21] purged uh it's going to uh the filth is
[23:24] going to be purged out of it there's
[23:26] going to be purified he says it's
[23:28] renewing
[23:30] herself and and and there's a rep
[23:32] purifying washing off a
[23:35] rededication and then he says the church
[23:38] needs it the Earth is going to
[23:40] experience it then he says we've got to
[23:41] have
[23:42] something we need we need to have
[23:45] something
[23:46] happen and as you're reading this we
[23:49] know that God is going to do it but
[23:53] the according to the scriptures that
[23:56] we've been reading it's the wrath of God
[23:59] upon the the the Earth and wickedness
[24:01] and there's a purifying but notice how
[24:02] it's coming from within the
[24:04] Earth and there's these volcanic
[24:07] eruptions and God is using these things
[24:09] within the Earth and within things that
[24:10] have already been created and brother
[24:12] man keeps saying she will rep purify
[24:15] herself she'll renew
[24:18] herself saying it's about the Earth so
[24:22] in Revelations chap
[24:23] 19: 7 and 8 I you'll know where I'm
[24:26] going with this I'm sure
[24:28] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[24:30] honor to him for the marriage of the
[24:32] Lamb has come and the marriage takes
[24:34] place
[24:35] here and his wife hath made herself
[24:39] ready let us be glad and rejoice for the
[24:42] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[24:43] wife hath made herself ready what did
[24:47] she make herself ready with and to her
[24:49] was granted that she should be array in
[24:52] fine linen clean and white for the fine
[24:54] linen is the righteousness of his Saints
[24:56] brother I said his word or his
[24:58] righteousness but it's granted to her we
[25:01] don't come up with it our own we don't
[25:03] we don't find it on our own but we
[25:04] receive Revelation that we then dress
[25:06] ourselves in and we have been given the
[25:09] word of God that we have a
[25:10] responsibility over you have the mind of
[25:13] Christ to know what he wants done with
[25:15] the word therefore the bride has been
[25:17] granted has been given the privilege and
[25:20] opportunity and the power to make
[25:22] herself
[25:24] ready the bride is granted she's
[25:27] furnished the Necessities she's been
[25:29] appointed she's been anointed she's been
[25:31] commissioned amen she has the Revelation
[25:34] to prepare herself amen even as we saw
[25:37] it in the Garden of Eden that that God
[25:40] must have given the first instinct of
[25:42] man was to dress himself and he doesn't
[25:43] fig leaves but then God gives them the
[25:45] Revelation to dress
[25:47] themselves in the the the bloody
[25:50] lamb and they dress themselves in the
[25:53] bleeding bloody lamb and so we are then
[25:57] brother says you as a member of this
[25:59] bride you've got to make yourself
[26:02] [Music]
[26:03] ready and then if the earth now if we
[26:06] see this en Ty the Earth purifies
[26:07] herself the Earth renews herself before
[26:11] the
[26:12] Millennium she's doing this now before
[26:14] the Millennium then the bride under her
[26:17] seventh seal is being purified and
[26:20] Washed by the word of God we're looking
[26:22] at this in type how that that these
[26:24] things happen in the Redemption of the
[26:26] Earth in these stages of the Earth if we
[26:28] can catch this Plan of Redemption and
[26:29] see this great deep truth from God then
[26:32] we see that there is a Plan of
[26:34] Redemption for my soul and having been
[26:36] redeemed there's this process that
[26:38] begins to work itself out as it will for
[26:41] the Earth so will it be for me and the
[26:43] Earth purifies yourself under that six
[26:46] seal for that Millennial reign of
[26:48] righteousness therefore I believe with
[26:50] the king of righteousness reigning in my
[26:52] soul that I can be purged purged and
[26:56] purified by the word of
[26:58] God cuz the bride hath made herself
[27:02] ready in Revelations CH 21 verse
[27:07] two and I John saw the holy city New
[27:10] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[27:11] Heaven
[27:13] prepared when it says the bride hath
[27:15] made herself ready that is
[27:17] prepared say saying prepared as a bride
[27:19] adorned or made ready for her husband
[27:23] when John sees this city prepared as the
[27:25] bride adorned for her husband we ought
[27:27] to come back to this other verse to see
[27:29] that the bride makes herself ready with
[27:31] the thing she's been provided
[27:34] with that as we read this this holy city
[27:37] this New
[27:39] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[27:41] Heaven if we could continue to read
[27:42] Revelations 21 this Perfection this
[27:44] perfect Kingdom This Day Without End the
[27:47] city where the lamb is the light no evil
[27:49] no wickedness shall ever enter there
[27:51] it's Perfection Beyond Perfection
[27:54] brother Braham says in things that are
[27:55] to be it's a perfect place calling you
[27:57] to that Perfection and you have to be
[28:00] perfect to get there the Bible said so
[28:03] Jesus said be therefore perfect even as
[28:05] your father in Heaven is perfect it's a
[28:08] perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect
[28:11] people
[28:12] come because you have to stand and be
[28:14] married to a perfect Son of God you must
[28:16] be a perfect bride so how can you do it
[28:18] through anything else but the perfect
[28:20] word of God yes sir which is the Waters
[28:23] of Separation that washes us from our
[28:25] sins sir this perfect word of God which
[28:27] is the Waters of separations the blood
[28:30] of Jesus Christ think of it dripping
[28:32] bloody word the blood the word of God
[28:35] bleeding blood to wash the bride
[28:38] inen amen yes sir she stands perfect
[28:42] virgin
[28:43] unadulterated how through the word which
[28:46] washes us through the word that
[28:48] separates us the thing that separates
[28:50] out wickedness separates out
[28:51] unrighteousness separates out anything
[28:53] that's not pure how are we going to get
[28:55] there through the word of God he calls
[28:58] it the bleeding word the blood the word
[29:00] of God the bleeding blood to wash the
[29:02] bride in we are being dressed in the
[29:05] bleeding word what ises it doing it's
[29:07] purifying it's purging it's cleansing
[29:10] it's
[29:13] sanctifying prepare as a bride Adorn for
[29:16] her husband how does a bride Adorn
[29:18] herself for her husband she makes
[29:20] herself
[29:22] ready the Earth renews itself the Earth
[29:24] purifies itself for the Millennium here
[29:27] we are than as the bride renewing oursel
[29:30] purging
[29:31] ourselves with the word of God in first
[29:34] John chapter 3: 2 and 3 says beloved now
[29:38] are we the sons of God and it does not
[29:41] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[29:44] that when he shall appear we shall be
[29:47] like him for we shall see him as he
[29:50] is now when you see him as he is that
[29:52] has an impact on you he says we shall be
[29:55] like him for we shall see him as he is
[29:56] so whatever you see him as you become
[29:59] see him as a Healer when you see it
[30:01] you're healed when you see him as a
[30:03] savior you're saved there there's
[30:05] something to seeing him as he is that
[30:07] has this reverberation impact on us so I
[30:10] want to see him I want to see him in his
[30:12] glory I want to see him his love I want
[30:13] to see him in his forgiveness amen so he
[30:15] says this that and every man that hath
[30:19] this hope in him purifieth
[30:23] himself even as he is
[30:26] pure every man that hath this hope in
[30:29] him purifieth himself even as he is pure
[30:34] now there's your there's your image
[30:36] Christ in you and you're going to be
[30:37] like him so he saying any man that hath
[30:40] his hope purifies himself he sanctifies
[30:42] himself he submits himself he sacrifices
[30:45] himself he prepares himself as a Living
[30:47] Sacrifice he's committed I want to
[30:50] purify myself I want to wash myself I
[30:52] want to be clean if I'm going to be like
[30:54] him I want to purify myself I want to
[30:56] bring this body under subjection I want
[30:58] to make sacrifices I want to make the
[31:00] right
[31:01] decisions every man that have this hope
[31:04] purifies himself we don't want to just
[31:06] trudge along say oh one day I'm going to
[31:08] be changed and we never make a decision
[31:10] to serve God greater we never make a
[31:13] decision to apply the token to our home
[31:15] we're just waiting for some day of
[31:16] redemption well one day brother bram's
[31:18] going to come back and everything's
[31:19] going to be fixed and so it doesn't
[31:20] matter how we live now how we raise our
[31:22] children now how we apply the token to
[31:24] our home how Sanctified we want to live
[31:26] how faithful we can be to church we just
[31:28] think one day a man's going to come back
[31:29] and fix it all and that's a lie of the
[31:31] devil because God has given his bride
[31:34] the tools she needs now to purify
[31:36] herself for meeting in the
[31:41] air in the sermon this sudden secret
[31:43] going away of the
[31:45] church now I love how he just brings all
[31:47] these elements together and this is
[31:49] going to get real practical here for a
[31:51] little bit he says because brother
[31:53] bram's going to make the specific points
[31:56] and I'm using this as a type to where we
[31:58] are now before the change of our body
[32:01] before the Millennium what we can be
[32:03] looking for God to do in our lives right
[32:06] now God does work through the pastor to
[32:09] get his church
[32:11] ready he works through the songs to get
[32:14] his church
[32:16] ready and he works through you to get
[32:18] his church
[32:20] ready now I I this is good
[32:23] stuff if your pastor would fail and
[32:26] continually to fail
[32:27] you'd hunt you another
[32:30] Pastor quickly you would do
[32:33] that if your choir didn't sing right or
[32:36] your solo wasn't right you'd say to the
[32:38] director the one who has the music don't
[32:40] let them sing no more they just make me
[32:42] nervous to
[32:44] sing now now think about it it's true
[32:48] right at least we have those thoughts I
[32:50] mean if your pastor fails continually
[32:53] and you think man we just need to get a
[32:54] new pastor and quick kind of identif the
[32:57] choir don't sing right this is kind of
[32:58] human act if things aren't right we just
[33:00] replace them fix it don't ever let them
[33:02] do that again right I mean this is this
[33:06] is the way now he says but what about
[33:09] you as an
[33:11] individual how do you fail in your daily
[33:15] living how do you tally up with God what
[33:19] God says for you to be a shining light
[33:21] that sits on a
[33:22] hill no one could pass around your way
[33:25] without knowing about Jesus
[33:27] what type of Life do you live I do not
[33:30] believe in any way this should excuse uh
[33:33] accountability to the pastor
[33:34] accountability to this leading of songs
[33:36] accountability in the church I don't
[33:37] think he's just trying to say well it
[33:38] doesn't matter what happens at church
[33:39] but he's saying you know what how about
[33:41] asking yourself the same standard you're
[33:43] holding for the choir leader the same
[33:44] standard you're holding for the teacher
[33:46] the same standard you're holding for
[33:47] everybody else what about you and your
[33:49] responsibility the pastor has a
[33:51] responsibility to bring the word and
[33:52] he's failing constantly and you judgeing
[33:54] for that you have a responsibility and
[33:57] your individual life to apply the token
[33:59] to your home and you have the
[34:00] responsibility to guide your family in
[34:02] truth to love your wives to respect your
[34:04] husbands that we have a responsibility
[34:06] in daily living do you hold the same
[34:08] standard in your daily life that you
[34:11] would to somebody in their Church
[34:14] Life what type of Life do you
[34:17] live one of those types that's mean and
[34:20] insulting and aggravating
[34:23] indifferent or I'd love to ask him so
[34:26] really tell me who are you thinking
[34:29] about I know it's 1958 I probably didn't
[34:31] know him but was it the neighbor in the
[34:34] apartment next door you know who was it
[34:35] you were going after there one of those
[34:37] types that's mean and insulting and
[34:39] aggravating indifferent or can you speak
[34:41] of the peace and the love that you found
[34:42] in Christ am she has made herself ready
[34:46] amen that's the scripture he's
[34:48] amplifying the scripture he's amplifying
[34:51] this does God work through the pastor
[34:52] does he work through the song leader
[34:53] does he work through the church yeah but
[34:55] he works through youen
[34:57] and how is he working through you to get
[34:59] the church ready the bride hath made
[35:01] herself ready to where now I begin to
[35:03] identify any meanness anything insulting
[35:05] aggravating indifferent I'm looking at
[35:07] my own individual life I'm saying I've
[35:09] got things that I need to be addressed
[35:11] in my own life and I need to be
[35:14] addressing these things I should not be
[35:16] excusing them I should not be
[35:18] rationalizing with them I do not want to
[35:20] be condemned or defeated by them but I
[35:22] want to look at them saying Oh God by
[35:24] your grace may I overcome this oh God
[35:27] May by your grace may I change from this
[35:30] man that I've been may I change from
[35:31] this woman I've been oh I've got this
[35:33] family history I've got this
[35:35] relationship history I've got this way
[35:37] our family's been for years but oh God I
[35:39] don't want it to stay this way forever I
[35:41] don't want to be a mean husband I don't
[35:43] want to be an impatient absent father
[35:45] God I want to change I know you can
[35:48] change
[35:49] me that's Gooden she ha made herself
[35:53] ready in the sermon the marriage of the
[35:55] Lamb he says if you know notice it said
[35:57] she has made herself
[36:02] ready so many
[36:05] says I know you couldn't guess this but
[36:07] this is quite a
[36:08] statement if the Lord will take this
[36:10] evil spirit from me from drinking or
[36:12] from gambling or from lying or stealing
[36:14] I'll serve him but that's up to
[36:19] you you got to do something
[36:22] too they that overcome shall inherit all
[36:25] things they that overcome
[36:27] this is something we've really want been
[36:28] wanting to impress upon you you have
[36:31] power to do
[36:32] it but you must be willing to lay it
[36:35] down she has made herself
[36:39] ready there's things maybe we're holding
[36:41] there's things that we're committing
[36:42] there's things that we're thinking about
[36:44] there's things we're doing and maybe we
[36:46] we we just say oh well Lord if if you
[36:48] don't want me to do you see take it away
[36:49] from me Lord if it's not right for me to
[36:52] be doing this then you just need to take
[36:53] the desire
[36:55] way and and and and maybe there may be
[36:58] some things where the Lord knows your
[36:59] heart and says that's the most
[37:01] hypocritical thing you've ever said to
[37:03] me because you know you're holding on to
[37:05] it you know you can lay it down you just
[37:07] got a lying Spirit on you that's trying
[37:09] to convince you that well if God doesn't
[37:11] want me to do this then and what is it
[37:14] we usually do right somebody's holding
[37:16] their their their Run DMC compilation
[37:19] CDs right and they're over here saying
[37:22] well you know what all these other
[37:23] people listen to their Christmas
[37:25] music so what's wrong with Run
[37:28] DMC and I'm
[37:32] thinking in equivocation there's a point
[37:34] there but let's be honest with ourselves
[37:38] right what is it that we hold on to and
[37:40] he says you got you got you must be
[37:42] willing to lay it down she's made
[37:44] herself ready I like that word you see
[37:46] God could not push us through a little
[37:49] pipe pull us out on the other end and
[37:51] then say blessed is he that overcometh
[37:54] you had nothing to overcome he just
[37:55] pushed you through
[37:57] catch this but you've got to make
[37:59] decisions for
[38:01] yourself I have to make decisions for
[38:03] myself in doing that we show our faith
[38:06] and respects to God through the
[38:08] decisions we make the sacrifices we make
[38:11] the choices we make the things that we
[38:13] abstain from the things that we commit
[38:15] to do the burdens we pick up the things
[38:17] that we lay down it shows our faith and
[38:20] respect to God and what is it it's not
[38:22] you saving yourself it's you purifying
[38:25] yourself you as the Bride of Jesus
[38:27] Christ makinging yourself
[38:30] ready somebody want to attach a label of
[38:33] closed line religion or legal legalism
[38:35] or Works to Salvation no that's a
[38:37] scarecrow trying to keep you from
[38:39] stepping into your God ordained promises
[38:42] and it's a scarecrow keeping you from
[38:44] walking in the full joy and peace and
[38:45] satisfaction you can't as a Believer cuz
[38:48] you're holding on to a bunch of baggage
[38:49] and justifying it because you think it's
[38:51] legalism or some oldfashioned gospel but
[38:54] it's nothing but the truth and the plan
[38:56] of God to bring you to
[39:00] righteousness
[39:03] hallelujah it's a plan of God a program
[39:05] of
[39:10] God brother BR makes the statement do I
[39:14] have the statement there in Satan's Eden
[39:16] didn't know if I was going to put that I
[39:18] just this is what I was coming to are
[39:20] you sick and tired of Satan's
[39:22] kingdom well are
[39:24] you do you believe it's coming to the
[39:26] Millennium under his Millennium his to
[39:30] his Eden am are you looking forward to
[39:33] that are you sick of this one are you
[39:37] sick of Satan in his
[39:38] kingdom this Kingdom out there that
[39:41] bombards us daily this Kingdom that just
[39:43] seems to be accelerated and grow are you
[39:45] sick of
[39:46] it think of that this Earth is going to
[39:49] bounch forth and pure Purge and purify
[39:52] and burn up all these elements of
[39:53] Satan's kingdom one day for the
[39:55] Millennium and and that and that this
[39:57] Earth then is going to have some sort of
[39:59] Revenge upon it and it's going to purify
[40:01] itself and renew itself I want you to
[40:03] start having a little bit of a pep rally
[40:05] in your soul today to think if the Earth
[40:07] is going to have it within itself to one
[40:09] day exact revenge on this Kingdom that
[40:11] Satan's been building on earth the Lord
[40:12] I want you to start doing it in me right
[40:16] now the sermon he that is in you that
[40:18] phrase ought to have some substance here
[40:20] he that is in you so when the lion was
[40:23] first created he was a friend of man
[40:25] it's the devil that makes him do that
[40:28] that's right in the M the wolf and the
[40:30] lamb shall feed together the lion shall
[40:31] eat straw like the bulock and shall lay
[40:33] down with the bulock they'll not hurt or
[40:35] destroy in the
[40:37] Millennium the devil will be
[40:40] gone it's the devil that makes wild
[40:42] beasts tear and rip and eat and things
[40:44] like that the way they do it's the devil
[40:47] that's done
[40:50] this the reason why we find ourselves in
[40:53] this Satan's Eden is because the devil
[40:55] came we find him in the Bible telling us
[40:57] he's there in the Garden of Eden and
[41:00] it's what's produced his Eden it's
[41:01] what's produced this Satan's
[41:04] kingdom but now brother says the devil
[41:06] will be gone during that Millennial time
[41:08] right and because the devil's
[41:11] gone it's one of the elements the devil
[41:14] being gone the Lion's not trying to eat
[41:15] the
[41:16] man they'll not hurt or destroy in that
[41:20] Millennium so as we read in Revelations
[41:22] chap 20 and I saw an angel come down
[41:24] from heaven having the kid of the
[41:25] bottomless pit and a great in his hand
[41:27] and he laid hold on the
[41:30] dragon that old serpent which is the
[41:32] devil and Satan and bound him a thousand
[41:36] years so now he's
[41:39] bound this Angel comes down out of
[41:41] heaven with a key Satan is bound this
[41:43] symbolic
[41:45] binding and cast him into the bottomless
[41:47] pit and shut him up and set a seal upon
[41:50] him so this is how he is going to be
[41:53] restrained and held back that he should
[41:56] receive the Nations no more till the
[41:58] Thousand Years should be
[41:59] fulfilled so it tells us that there is a
[42:02] binding of Satan and he's held
[42:06] away as it were at a bottomless pit
[42:08] that's been sealed and he's been shut up
[42:10] and he's
[42:11] bound chained
[42:13] up and he is and the seal that's set
[42:16] upon him through this
[42:18] circumstance he can't deceive
[42:21] anymore says he can't deceive the
[42:23] Nations now this is a a great statement
[42:26] so it's because of this binding and
[42:28] because of these circumstances he's not
[42:31] allowed and not able to deceive Nations
[42:33] anymore that that's different and
[42:35] distinct from the reason why he can't
[42:37] deceive you and I'll just let you think
[42:39] about that and after that he must be
[42:41] loosed a little
[42:43] season that's why you have again uh uh
[42:46] this more Warfare and more deceiving
[42:48] after the Millennium and they still sin
[42:49] after the Millennium because guess what
[42:51] the devil's loosed now he begins to work
[42:53] through these subjects and begins to
[42:54] have this influence and it's this great
[42:55] climactic destruction and judgment and
[42:57] we go into the eighth day now brother
[43:00] brandom I'll try to do this man I
[43:02] thought I was going to be like two hours
[43:03] long I haven't I'm not going to be an
[43:05] hour
[43:06] today we can go feed this other
[43:08] bottomless
[43:12] pit now if I could I just want
[43:15] to identify some things that brother
[43:18] banam says about this about this binding
[43:20] of
[43:21] Satan in question and answers he says
[43:24] Jesus the church the bride was raptured
[43:25] went up to glory and was up there and
[43:27] was married returned back to the Earth
[43:28] and lived a thousand years at the end of
[43:31] the thousand years and just want you to
[43:32] catch the language that brother B using
[43:34] to describe you you can see these order
[43:36] of events too Satan was loosed out of
[43:39] his prison that is Bound By An Angel
[43:41] with a chain not a log chain but a chain
[43:43] of circumstance he says all of his
[43:45] subjects were in
[43:46] hell all that was resurrected on the
[43:49] earth were redeemed in Jesus with them
[43:51] he couldn't work on nothing but at the
[43:53] end of the Thousand Years second
[43:55] Resurrection blessed and holy is he that
[43:57] has part in the first resurrection over
[43:59] which the second death has no power now
[44:01] notice in the second Resurrection when
[44:03] they come up then Satan's loed out of
[44:05] his prison for a little season then the
[44:07] judgment is set when he says Jesus with
[44:10] the bride as king and queens set on the
[44:12] throne white Throne judgment the books
[44:13] were open the books of Sinners of the
[44:15] Sinners so we can see that brother said
[44:17] he's Bound by a chain he calls of
[44:19] circumstances and he says he doesn't
[44:21] have anyone to work through says it
[44:23] again in a couple other questions and
[44:25] answers later we later he says and so
[44:26] it's that Sabbath day when the church
[44:28] will no more labor against sin and Satan
[44:31] is Bound for a little season a thousand
[44:33] years because his subjects are all in
[44:34] Hell the church that on Earth is
[44:37] redeemed right in the presence of Christ
[44:39] so he has nothing he can work on so it's
[44:41] not a chain as I said a long chain it's
[44:43] a chain of circumstance he has nothing
[44:46] he can do he's helpless and hopeless
[44:48] just waiting for the resurrection of the
[44:50] subjects then they separated is the
[44:52] sheep from
[44:53] goats so there's this this Millennial
[44:57] condition in part has something to do
[44:59] with the fact that there's a chain on
[45:02] Satan and he can't work through
[45:04] anybody he wants to but he just can't
[45:08] that he says there's no subjects to work
[45:10] through so this if he's just going
[45:12] around he's tempting if you could just
[45:13] even use the language that brother Bam's
[45:15] using to kind of describe he saying he
[45:17] doesn't have anyone that he can work
[45:18] through so it he says it's not like a
[45:21] log chain where the devil's just over
[45:22] there with the straight jacket just
[45:23] trying to get out of a bottomless pit
[45:26] but you could even go so far as to say
[45:28] Satan's still around in some way but he
[45:31] just can't get into
[45:32] anybody he's still tries to tempt babbe
[45:35] and this is just me H H uh embellishing
[45:38] it it's it's not that he's wrapped up
[45:41] with the L chain he has no one to work
[45:43] through how many times I keep saying
[45:45] this before it Dawns on you wait a
[45:47] minute hold on there's a type that in
[45:50] the Millennium there's no sin in the
[45:52] Millennium and there's no labor against
[45:54] sin because he has no one to work
[45:56] through and then we realize that Paul
[45:57] says let not sin re therefore in your
[46:00] mortal body and there's a language in
[46:02] the word of God that's tell us that it
[46:04] has no more dominion over me the sin the
[46:07] World the Flesh the devil has no more
[46:10] power over me no more dominion over me
[46:12] then I don't want to give it anything to
[46:14] work
[46:17] through good and the sermon we preach
[46:19] the futur is now what was that uh place
[46:22] that brother bam came to when he gets
[46:24] there cuz Satan's bound
[46:26] here he is he's saying he's bound the
[46:27] scripture says he's bound a thousand
[46:29] years and then he's loosed from his
[46:31] prison after that thousand years you
[46:33] have been given power to bind him the
[46:36] worst or any you have been given power
[46:40] to bind him the worst or any whatever it
[46:43] is that binds him for a thousand years
[46:45] and keeps him away that you do not labor
[46:47] to sin that power is in the church now
[46:50] that power to bind him is in you now
[46:52] you've been given power to bind him the
[46:55] worst are
[46:57] any so he said to Peter I give unto you
[47:01] the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and
[47:04] whatsoever Thou shalt bind on the Earth
[47:05] shall be bound in
[47:08] heaven whatsoever Thou shalt loose on
[47:11] Earth shall be
[47:12] loosed in
[47:15] heaven remember how we read in second
[47:17] Peter how that word
[47:19] loose whatever you loose on Earth and
[47:22] loose in heaven it's the same word for
[47:24] passing away
[47:26] the Heaven and Earth shall pass away
[47:28] it's a releasing it's a setting
[47:31] free the whole earth is going to be
[47:33] loosed to the Glorious Liberty of the
[47:35] sons of
[47:36] God right the Bible's teaching us
[47:39] there's the loosing then where's The
[47:42] Binding there's going to be a renewal
[47:44] there's going to be a setting free
[47:47] there's going to be a purging as it were
[47:49] as brother says the bride hath made
[47:51] herself ready it's this purging for the
[47:54] Millennium it's this purifying for the
[47:55] Millennium and I just want you to see
[47:57] those two thoughts together now that
[47:58] there's going to be a Purge and a
[48:00] renewal the bride is going to make
[48:01] herself ready she's laying down things
[48:03] she's separated herself the bleeding
[48:05] bloody word she's dressing herself in
[48:07] it's the Waters of Separation this is
[48:09] the transformation this is the
[48:11] rededication this is the renewing yes
[48:13] the soul is saved but now having been
[48:15] saved and loosed now I have the
[48:17] materials I have the Revelation I have
[48:19] the resources to dress my spirit to
[48:21] dress my mind this renewing of my mind
[48:23] that's taking place in my body taking
[48:25] place in my life and as that's happening
[48:27] I'm also going to bind that Wicked one
[48:29] I'm going to bind unrighteousness I'm
[48:31] going to bind wickedness I'm going to
[48:33] bind I'm going to bind I'm going to bind
[48:35] I'm going to say no to the devil I'm
[48:37] going to say yes to the word I'm going
[48:38] to say no to the world I'm going to say
[48:40] no to the flesh I'm going to say no to
[48:43] sin there's a
[48:46] binding because you've got power to bind
[48:48] him
[48:49] amen and brother brandham says in the
[48:51] sermon the marriage of the
[48:53] Lamb or guess getting very very close to
[48:57] closing here he says so I think that's
[48:58] the way with preaching the gospel he
[49:00] says if it don't stir you up a little
[49:02] bit he says get your fill your spiritual
[49:05] gastronomics started
[49:07] right you got so many GI problems he
[49:11] says let's get your spiritual
[49:13] gastronomics started right and make you
[49:14] a little
[49:16] sick to examine yourself at the
[49:19] Bible this is what the preaching of the
[49:21] Gospel should do should make you it
[49:23] shouldn't plate you on and make you go
[49:26] well I guess it's okay that you know I
[49:28] fornicate because at least I've got the
[49:30] manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit
[49:31] in the church service I mean I guess
[49:34] it's okay that I I I don't don't honor
[49:36] the word of God and how I keep my hair
[49:38] and how I dress and the jokes I tell and
[49:40] the things I watch because at least I
[49:41] feel good when I go to church he said no
[49:44] the preach of the word should make you
[49:45] sick to your stomach if you're not
[49:47] lining up with the word of God your
[49:49] spiritual gastronomics started right
[49:51] make you a little sick to examine
[49:52] yourself with the Bible see if that old
[49:54] temper and selfish selfishness
[49:56] ungodliness love of the world television
[49:58] you're like whatever that
[50:00] is love of the world television things
[50:03] that might
[50:05] leave this is what ought to do the
[50:07] preach of the word is still yet today to
[50:09] drive away things and we have to get
[50:11] sick to our stomach say oh I don't want
[50:13] to do that anymore I don't want to
[50:14] justify that anymore I don't want to be
[50:16] that way anymore this is what it ought
[50:18] to do this is the sermon the marriage of
[50:19] the Lamb notice what he's coming to what
[50:21] he's preaching on he says and the church
[50:23] sit empty and the pews sit empty see
[50:26] when you ought to be out there like
[50:28] Jesus you got his spirit in you trying
[50:30] to get everybody in the country to come
[50:32] to your church to receive Christ
[50:35] everybody in the country all right the
[50:36] door's open it's wide open everybody in
[50:39] the
[50:41] country he says this is what you ought
[50:43] to be doing and we call ourselves then
[50:44] the bride of Christ Oh What A pity
[50:47] friends the hour has come his bride has
[50:51] made herself ready oh made herself self
[50:56] ready she laid aside all of these things
[50:59] do you see what he's identifying that
[51:01] and he says you've got his spirit in you
[51:03] with his spirit in you then you're
[51:05] laying aside these things of temper
[51:07] selfishness ungodliness love of the
[51:09] world television and things you're
[51:10] laying aside those things you've got
[51:13] power to do it we're not sitting back
[51:14] say Lord if you don't want me to do it
[51:16] you're just going to have to take it
[51:17] away from
[51:18] me kind of like Lord if you if you don't
[51:20] want me to have this you just need to
[51:22] take it away from
[51:24] me
[51:26] you're going to have to do
[51:27] it go ahead take
[51:31] it that's then he said he's saying I'm
[51:33] not going to fight with
[51:35] you I'm not going to fight with
[51:38] you he's asked for it
[51:41] already he's waiting for you to give it
[51:43] to him is that the mark of maturity I
[51:46] opened up a men's meeting one year and I
[51:47] found two of the strongest guys I
[51:48] possibly could looking out these young
[51:50] men I said I want you boy you guys come

[57:33] to2 think about what Paul is saying here
[57:36] that you put off concerning the former
[57:38] conversation the old man which is
[57:41] corrupt according to deceitful
[57:42] lust take it off you put it off quite a
[57:47] statement if you've been born again into
[57:49] new creatures already seated in Heavenly
[57:50] places in Christ Jesus and now he's
[57:52] saying put that off he's not he's not
[57:55] going to rip it off of you he's say youd
[57:57] put it off put off the former
[57:59] conversation the old man which is
[58:01] corrupt according to deceitful us and be
[58:02] renewed in the spirit of your mind there
[58:06] is a renewing there is a rededication
[58:08] there's a purging there's a purifying
[58:10] right now just as the Earth is going to
[58:12] purify itself for the Millennium I want
[58:14] to purify myself I want to purge myself
[58:17] I want to rededicate myself I want to be
[58:20] renewed in the spirit of my mind my soul
[58:23] is sealed it couldn't be any more
[58:24] perfect but the spirit of my mind Wars
[58:27] it fights it struggles it doubts it gets
[58:29] nervous it gets worried it gets
[58:31] depressed it gets anxious I want to be
[58:33] renewed in the spirit of my
[58:36] mind I want to put off the old life I
[58:38] want to put off the old
[58:41] thoughts oh
[58:51] my and that you put on the new man
[58:56] do you see the image that's just been
[58:58] created the old Trinidad song I'm taking
[59:01] off the old man I'm putting on the new
[59:04] man I'm changing robes for another
[59:07] dimension I'm taking off the old man
[59:10] it's my responsibility I'm taking out
[59:12] the old man that's the part I got to do
[59:14] and I'm putting on because he says that
[59:16] you put off concerning the former
[59:18] conversation and that you put on the new
[59:20] man which after God has created in
[59:22] righteousness and true holiness
[59:25] wherefore put into away lying speak
[59:28] every man truth with his neighbor for
[59:30] members of One Of Another You could
[59:33] continue to read all the other things
[59:34] that he says to do but there's a putting
[59:36] away and there's a putting on that's
[59:39] what we're doing right now as the Bride
[59:41] of Jesus Christ we're making ourselves
[59:42] ready we're renewing ourselves
[59:44] rededicating ourselves we're purging
[59:46] ourselves we're becoming more mature
[59:49] there was a time in your life that God
[59:50] just came and snatched that right out of
[59:51] your hand didn't he do it for you did it
[59:54] for for us that's why we're here today
[59:57] and now we've come to places in our
[59:58] lives where now he's just saying give it
[59:59] to
[1:00:01] me Hallelujah and we're over there just
[1:00:04] going well you're going to have to come
[1:00:06] and take
[1:00:07] it he's said no I'm not going to fight
[1:00:10] with
[1:00:11] you and he wants us to lay things down
[1:00:14] wants to take things up yes it's
[1:00:17] Millennial preparation yes amen it's
[1:00:22] purging I trust that there's something
[1:00:24] in your heart that makes you want to do
[1:00:27] that if we could bow our heads in
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:46] prayer brother brandom at the end of
[1:00:47] this
[1:00:49] service of the marriage of the Lamb it's
[1:00:51] a really good one uh to take in on this
[1:00:58] [Music]
[1:01:02] subject as you just examine your heart I
[1:01:06] know there's things there's decision
[1:01:07] that some people need to make
[1:01:09] here in terms of a decision to serve
[1:01:13] Christ and there's things that hang on
[1:01:14] to us doubt and unbelief and we need
[1:01:16] just to surrender to the
[1:01:18] Lord and we need to ask for forgiveness
[1:01:20] we need to be baptized there's a
[1:01:22] repentance there's a Salvation that
[1:01:23] needs to come to us and that's that's on
[1:01:25] the table for any who have not been
[1:01:26] bornn again I want you to search your
[1:01:30] hearts find whether you be in the faith
[1:01:33] whether or not you've received Christ
[1:01:35] whether or not you've been born
[1:01:37] again because
[1:01:39] truly that's what
[1:01:42] matters and so I I I I speak that I want
[1:01:45] that to be in our hearts but then
[1:01:47] there's
[1:01:48] this
[1:01:50] other place that we're wanting to think
[1:01:52] of now
[1:01:56] we those of us who have his spirit
[1:01:58] inside of
[1:02:05] us what are we doing with it
[1:02:09] now are we letting it to continue are we
[1:02:13] are using the power that he's given us
[1:02:15] to root out things to purge to heue
[1:02:19] Down Bam says now the marriage of the
[1:02:21] Lamb has come and the Bride made herself
[1:02:23] ready he says father they are yours
[1:02:25] they're trophies of your
[1:02:27] word they're here to be Washed by the
[1:02:29] Water of the word because it's the Full
[1:02:31] Gospel he says it's not sparing
[1:02:36] anything it's cut down to get down to
[1:02:39] the kindergarten
[1:02:41] place it's grubbing out the
[1:02:44] Roots the Roots of bitterness the roots
[1:02:46] of indifference the roots of the world
[1:02:50] he says grub them out Lord by the Holy
[1:02:52] Spirit cast them away away from the
[1:02:55] people I don't know what it is that the
[1:02:58] Holy Spirit may need to do in your life
[1:02:59] today but I say grub it out root it out
[1:03:03] whatever it is that it might be maybe we
[1:03:05] do need the Holy Spirit to come in and
[1:03:06] root some things out but maybe there's
[1:03:08] some things you can give to him today
[1:03:11] some things he's asked for you can say
[1:03:13] Lord here it is I give it to
[1:03:15] you Lord whatever you've asked for I
[1:03:19] give is that in anyone's Hearts today
[1:03:23] would there be one that would want stand
[1:03:24] and say Lord here I
[1:03:27] am I just give myself to you
[1:03:31] today it's what you've asked for anyways
