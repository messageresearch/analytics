TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just want to take a few moments in the beginning to touch on uh last Wednesday night so just a few summary things not very long I don't try to take much just to recap but I do want there to always be some overlap and connection on some of these things so just a uh um a quick summary and just hold for the title for tonight but last time we preached out of dust and we took some time just to Define what dust is and some of its places in scripture and um one of the things that we identified is it's just something that's carried about by the wind it's something that's F real fine but we took from Genesis chapter 2 where it says the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life in Man became a living soul that dust there even could be translated to ashes or just rubbish debris comes from even this mist or vapor or smoke we could see that dust is used just to symbolize the most basic element of the human body so we talk about dust we come from the Dust we arise from the dirt of the earth and being born of the Dust the Bible tells us that we return to the dust and so here we are just ashes God's uh made us out of the Dust of the earth and that represents human life and we use job a lot as an example last time on Wednesday night and just his struggle and um his thoughts on humanity and life he says in Job chapter 14: 1 and two man that is born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble that's agitation turmoil it's it's a trembling it's a raging uh when I was studying the word it just to me life is just boiling just constant boil constant pressure and I kind of use the thought in my mind life is like a pressure cooker that uh eventually the moisture runs out and we just get burned to a crisp and we we go right back to ashes again we go right back to dust but he said man is just a born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow andth not that's life is but a vapor just a Mist it's just a smoke and no matter how long you live when you compare our lifespan to even those of the of the in the Old Testament realize our life is just a very small slice we come and we go and what is what is man what's left of him when he's done and just memories and there's a lot that we could expound upon just how fragile life is and H and just how we are just dust as it were scripturally but one statement I want to repeat to you is from the sermon letting off the pressure and brother Bram we read this he says it's just becoming a neurotic age everybody's all built up haven't got no time and that builds up to a place that it breaks up things it causes people to have hard feelings when they snap them off and say things you don't mean to say now everybody's guilty of it I'm guilty you're all guilty we do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise and there's an excess pressure built up today that you sometimes you read these statements so that you get everybody on the same page I don't think anybody should disag agree with this I imagine even the youngest ones here like yeah pressure these days man I got homework my mom's making me make the bed you know I don't get to take naps anymore whatever it might be there just might be some things it's like pressure is building I think we can all relate to this and things just it's just coming on us this pressure and if you don't have the proper ventilation if you don't have the proper vent to that it causes us to blow up and it causes us to build builds up and we snap and he says we do things and remember this under this kind of pressure you act act in ways you otherwise wouldn't act and sometimes you get experience people under certain situations and they manifest something like oh I didn't know they were like that I could say in their defense they're not really like that but something made them do it they snapped they came to a point they acted out of character and I can say this just by my own testimony and a time in my life when things were just coming under a lot of pressure it became evident to me what the impact it was having on me when I be to act out of character I this isn't that's not how I think that's not how I process things that's not the way I should be responding so it's really to us a warning sign when we begin to snap and we do things we wouldn't normally do Under Pressure he says before I go any further I might say this and I'm so glad he does I believe it's the enemy coming down and pressing I believe it's the devil so it's that adversary who's walking about who makes due use of every opportunity to squeeze you wants to put you in that press he's you got a Punch coming so he's looking to put you under pressure to get you overthinking to get you reacting and we know the coming of the Lord is at hand and the Bible said in the last days the devil would go about like a roaring lion and if he could get you under pressure hurrying running over something you'll make decisions that you wouldn't make if you sit down and think it over now there's that contrast of being under pressure and life is boiling it's raging and this this natural life is just a constant turmoil a constant pressure but what we talked about before is how we could come to Christ and that we could let off the pressure in Christ as we reading our family devotion this week thy loving kindness is better than life and brother Braman thirsting for Life says wait how can something be better in life and he said there must be two different kinds of life and this life is pressure but his life is release this life is burdens and turmoil and anxiety and blowing up but his life is peace and a and love everlasting and it just it's a relief in Christ so Christ is who we come to to relieve this pressure amen and so despite that pressure we were using a lot just out of dust and God's going to take us out of dust and we use job as an example and he says in job 29:18 then I said I shall die in my nest and I shall multiply my days as the sand and a lot of translations render that I'll multiply my days as the phoenix bird and so job in referring to this is it's an emblem of the Resurrection this is an emblem of redemption I know my redeemer liveth and though this body be reduced to dust one day I'm I'm going to come back I'm going to come forth as a phoenix bird that phoenix bird Burns in the fire but that is Born Again from its own ashes and Rises up again it's saying we'll Rise Again death doesn't even have victory over us if this body dissolves and if this body is broken down and this body it Wast away it's it's going to come back again I I've got to apologize I meant to welcome Lucas and Haley as well but just I got sidetracked by Judah so we can blame it on my cousin how's that but it's so good to see Lucas and Haley Haley coffee here God bless you now you get a shout out that's going to make the cut too everybody else is going to get cut off in the archives you're right in the middle of all of it should I start over 5 4 3 2 1 edit there we go but the the phoenix bird uh it would even in this mythology it would make its own nest and there in that Nest he says I shall die in my Nest it's an illusion to that bird and there it would burn up it would die it be reduced to ashes but it rises up again from the Flames as it were Rises up from the ash is to live again and and that's that's an image to us that job is pointing to about being redeemed and being restored even when something is reduced to Rubble even when something's been completely destroyed oh my testimony is a mess my life's a mess I I I I it's completely been reduced to Rubble reduced to ashes in other words it's not that you've made a mess of your finances you've made a mess of your of your body with drug addictions you've been burned to ashes you've been buried you've died God's able to redeem God's able to restore so where we ended was how on God has a plan of redemption God has a promise to restore us and so my my title has been in my heart just out of dust into heaven and so tonight I just want to look on this into heaven but I've put in parentheses Christ because it this it's just this image of Christ being that place where we can let go this place place where we are relieved it could have been out of dust into the temple it could have been out of dust into a number of things but it's a state of perfection it's being in Christ it's becoming Christlike and and I believe it's a place where if you're dust uh maybe if we're in the dust and David talks about how I I cleave to the dust and I'm drawn down and I look down and I can't even lift up my head and he's talking about this depression and this melanchon this weight that brought him low to the Earth but I believe that even if we find ourselves in the dust we've got reason to be positive cuz he's going to take us out of dust if even if we're ashes he's promised he'll take us out of ashes and bring us back again and this is the promise that's given in Joel chapter 2 as we've read it we're all very familiar with it uh as students of the message and usually with the Wednesday night crowd you have the benefit of those who are in the word themselves not just on Sundays and Wednesdays but they're in the word and so they know these things they they're familiar with them but the scripture refers to this process of Destruction through the king the Locust the canker worm the caterpillar and the Palmer worm and brother Braham gives a lot of attention to these things in the message of the hour and how they brought destruction and it was this process that ultimately yields death and God is saying I will restore so there has been this process of Destruction and Ultimate Death no more fruitfulness it's this the vine dies and it's why he says fear not to the land and fear not to the Beast because those things that have been wasted and laid waste I'll bring back again it'll spring forth and I'll bring the the former and latter rain upon the Earth I'm going to bring them together a and and it's going to bring forth a great uh triumphant Harvest and so there's a great promise to Israel and there's a beautiful promise of the Redemption of the body of Christ his bride but it's an illus it's he's a pointing to a time where what has been torn up what has been brought down and reduced to ashes will be raised up again and we see it's emblematic where there's a teaching rain that goes forth and then there's a harvest rain that these very things the the the harvesting of crops and wheat and fruit speaks of a Rapture so it's a it speaks of a translation it speaks of Us coming to the ultimate of redemption now if you could see what God is saying fear not and be glad for the Lord will do great things the these these this Locust in these stages brother talks about the same insect has torn everything down a and and you look at it says I'll never get a harvest again I'll never get fruit when will never be able to enjoy these things and there's maybe some uh sadness as you see that scene we were painting a similar picture last Wednesday night I think it's when it dawned on me that I thought I was going to be a great encouragement and then realized three quter of the way through all I've been doing is talking about job and realize man you know if you're trying to compare make people happy by saying hey at least you're not job it's probably not going to work right like well job didn't have a car job didn't have to worry about a mortgage right I mean there's we'd have a way just to think that had it easy but still there is it was something when we compare as we went through those steps on Wednesday night and think about life and how hard it is and what we endure and what we go through right this life is very um there's a Darkness to this life there's a Darkness to this age that we're living in and it's a reality of human existence as the Bible describes this as um ashes to ashes dust to dust and we're all uh just going to eventually back end up in a grave as it's alluding to it says in Isaiah chapter 64 vers 6 but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags it' be one thing for him to say we're just all an unclean thing but then to say even our righteousness is as filthy rags it says no matter what we're doing to be good no matter how what kind of morality we might have and integrity we think we might have it's just all doesn't compare to the glory of God and being sinful creatures it's not going to change anything says and we all we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities Like the Wind have taken us away this is the reality of humanity this is what we are uh this is the reality of sin this is just the reality of our existence a man born of a woman is born in sin in sin did my mother conceive me the psalmist says that we come forth into this world with the stain of sin upon us where as an unclean thing any good we do as unclean creatures is still as a filthy rag because it carries with it the stain it is we are just dust moved about by whims we're moved about by Nature we're moved about by the the shifting sands of time this is just life for us in Psalms 102: 1 to14 originally I kind of had some of these things just put together thinking we might just do a study in scripture go back and read U all of this Psalm it speaks of the prophesies of this end time but I wanted just to take the first 14 verses it says a prayer of The Afflicted when he is overwhelmed and porth out his complaint before the Lord Lord and just now somebody has made this their favorite Scripture A Prayer of The Afflicted when he's overwhelmed and porth out his complaint before the Lord hear my prayer oh Lord and let my cry come unto thee so this is this supplication this crying out from one who is Afflicted he feels overwhelmed and he's pouring out in his complaint it's not like a you know a survey you fill out or you you want to you want to return something we got grievances it's not necessarily that but just your situation your your your status what you're going through hear my prayer Lord and let my cry come unto thee hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble well life am Mana is just a full day a few days and full of trouble and it says incline thy ear unto me in the day when I call answer me speedily that's a language that Jesus uses when he talks about uh the just crying out to Christ and the the righteous saying oh Lord avenge us the elect crying says I will avenge them speedily H there's something about our cries that go up to him and the Prisoner as the scripture comes to we're be we're locked up in a prison we're Bound by death and we have this this appointment with death that's coming so we're bound up in this flesh we're bound up in this dust and we're crying out Loose us oh Lord loose us who will deliver me from the body of this death says for my days are consumed like smoke and my B bones are burned as a hear here's this image of just the hardness of life and even what it ends in my heart is smitten and withered like grass so that I forget to eat my bread by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin I am like a pelican of the Wilderness I'm like an owl of the desert so much imagery being offered to us in this a pelican of the Wilderness an owl of the desert there's there's maybe something in congruent with the image that he's thinking of and there's some despairing of life there's something that's lacking I watch and him as a sparrow alone upon the Housetop mine enemies reproach me all the day and they that are mad against me are sworn against me for I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping because of thine indignation and thy wrath for for thou Hast Lifted Me Up and cast me down my days are like a shadow that Decline and I'm withered like grass are you encouraged yet somebody's reading job's diary but now the scene's going to change says but thou oh Lord shalt endure forever and thy remembrance into all generations I love how it sets the scene for us so we can understand just the beauty of the prophecy if man wasn't full of sin and condemned to be lost I I mean really just how excited would people be about a savior if Israel hadn't been in bondage just and the and the kingdom was perfect and they had great glorious Kings how excited would have they been about a messiah so it has to appropriately paint this picture of this Doom and Gloom not as a a misrepresentation but just the reality of how we live and our lives it paints that picture but now it mentions Lord You're great you endure forever your remembrance unto all generations Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favor her yay the set time is come and and this as this is prophesied of of Israel we know that the bride she's to come on the scene in the in the last days and there's a time and a place that's appointed for her to rise and so Zion is even a reference to the bride brother bam says in one place it's always the bride so there's some application to us as his Gentile bride and as the body of Christ though she may be able to say as as a prayer of The Afflicted she may be able to say as one that's overwhelmed one that's suffered one that's gone through church ages one that's been torn away one that's been brought to the ground and goes back into the ground the Lord will arise and have mercy on Zion there will come a time for him to have grace and favor upon her amen for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof so here is a prophecy not so much at the moment that it's going to be completed but even at a time when it's completely in Ruins and it's been reduced to dust he said thy servants take pleasure in their Stones they're looking upon them they're considering them and they even have mercy and pity upon the dust that there there's a love for it there's a longing for it there's a burden for it and looking at it it's like oh I I I'm not dismissive of the Dust I'm not dismissive of the rubble what it used to represent what it could have been all the glory that was referred to it there's some connection it has with it and this the writer using it in the sense to kind of take the picture oh I know something's going to happen because even your servant's eyes are turned to the dust there's even a a longing and a burn it has for the rubble and and if I could say this about whatever condition your life is in I don't despise it don't disregard it don't don't walk don't necessarily Walk Away From the Ashes and say it's all run but look at the dust and know that God is able to bring Beauty out of the rubble he's able to build again beauti if God could make man out of dust if man was made from ashes then you you know that God has all the material he needs to bring forth something glorious and so here's the great prophecy of though this darkness of Affliction and being overwhelmed God is able to raise up from the dust and redeem Zion if you continue to read this's beautiful prophecy contained in Psalms 102 it's one of my favorite chapters not because of verse one in the intro but Ezekiel chapter 37 verses 1 to 14 as well there's a so much in this I'm just wanting to preach it and not stop too much on this but it's just so chocked full but here we see another image of something coming out of dust says the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and so this is an image of death and not just death but long death to where it's not a rotting corpse but it's been reduced to bones and caused me to pass by them roundout and behold there were very many in the open Valley and he says and lo they were very dry there was no strength in them uh they would have been maybe breaking up and brittle so he's wanting to say these are dry there's no there's no strength in them it's not recent but these are those that have been dead for some time and he said unto me son of man can these bones live so it's the hand of the Lord that brings him to this place shows him this Valley full of Bones and he deduces from it in the way that he's shown it that these are very very dry these bodies are long dead they've been reduced to maybe I and I'm just trying to speculate and make it fit my prior title but maybe they're dusting a little bit maybe they're brittle maybe they're breaking and the the he's asked this question the spirit of the Lord ask him a question can these bones live and he's got the right answer in verse in the next statement he says and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest and what a statement it's not I just love even uh the confidence in God uh to say that uh you know well if you were just if it was up to me of course not H uh bones don't live and uh um and these things this just isn't common but he says Lord you know so there's some difference to a God who has the power just like uh Lazarus sister said oh uh even now Lord I know that whatsoever you ask we could have that there's some there's some belief that With God all things are possible and I answered oh Lord thou knowest in verse four and he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord now I want you to key in on that what's the secret of dead Dry Bones what what can have an impact on ashes what can have an impact on the dust what is it that can take a lump of clay what is it that can take a handful of dust what is it where is the power what does it reside in oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus sayith the Lord God un these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live that that's the fullness of the statement prophesy hear in the word of the Lord bones and this is what you're going to see breath will enter in and you shall live and then it kind of steps back a little bit to describe it and I'll lay senes upon you and I'll bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord notice how he says hear the word and you're going to live then it kind of gives more description to the process so he says so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold the shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and when I beheld lo the Senus and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them now this is the the stage at which God brought Ezekiel to the valley was not at this point because just maybe some conjecture here had the hand of the Lord been upon Ezekiel and the spirit of the Lord takes him out to the valley and he said I saw h a uh people and I saw them I saw the Flesh of man arrayed a certain way and I saw them dressed and I saw the skin uh his the image would have been very different but now this goes from dry bones to flesh with senu they would have been upright skin covered them and the only thing that he could remark is that there was no breath in them because he knew that God said Not only would I lay Senus upon you and bring flesh upon you and cover you with skin but I was going to breathe he knew there was a promise that he wasn't just directing a lifel likee statues he was going to bring forth something that would have breath something that would have life so he says there's no breath in them so despite those stages of restoration there still was something else to happen listen I say it today to not don't stop short of a total Deliverance don't stop short of the full promise we said well there will was dry bones and now Bones have come together and senu and tendons have come and skins come back I I'm happy just to have skin no if God promised you breath you don't stop till you get the breath if God's promised you 100 you stay with it until you get 100 I think it was someone at the Mesa Church who wrote the song 99 and a half won't do I I I I don't want to sell myself short of his promises and it said in verse n then he said he unto me prophesy un the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind so notice the what the the very thing that's going to bring these things to pass thus sayith the Lord God come from the Four Winds oh breathe and breathe upon the slain that they may live they'd been slain they'd been reduced to ashes but now they come back up to this process of restoration and for some people that might have been good enough if people just look they'll think it's a church just get him to look the part so I prophesied verse 10 as he commanded me I love how there's this image of a prophet bringing the word of God as he's commanded and it's in with that Dynamic that says and the breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet an exceeding great Army we know that with true Revelation the bride will be an invincible Army it says and the breath came into them and they lived and not only did they live they stood on their feet and became an exceeding great Army this breathing is it points us to the Breath of God all scriptures given by the Breath of God the inspiration of God to where there's a there's a breath of God that goes forth and therefore as God is giving breath you breathe that in and the word of God is God's breath the word of God comes from his mouth but as you eat that word you're breathing in God that breath you're breathing in his life you're breathing in his in his inspiration and the Breath of God Goes Forth the inspiration of God goes forth and he breathes but it's not just getting lost in The Ether it's it's mouth to mouth it's Life coming into your lungs it it's power it's the it's the supernatural power of God it's the life of God being breathed and you don't just feel it you breathe it in and it being breathed in life comes in and it animates you to be an invincible Army an exceeding great Army and I want to continue to read to verse 14 then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off cut off from our parts now this is this is the it's kind of as we read it this way that this is the way it begins just like Psalms 102 and you see a connection between those this is this is job on his Ash Heap this is this is that oh her bones are dried our hope is lost we're cut off from our parts Israel is separated everything's in disarray he says therefore prophesy and say unto them thus sayith the Lord God behold oh my people I'll open your Graves and cause you to come up out of your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel and ye shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your Graves oh my people and brought you up out of your Graves now we know that brother Brandon when he preaches the seals and we have the overview of the church Church age book that brother Brown is saying that the church was dead she is in a grave as it were and even when we come up to the time of the seals he says she's still dead as a door now and there's been no manifestation of God to wake her up if I could put this way breathe into her the breath of life and cause her to stand on her feet as an invincible Army and he talks about how what a resurrection this is so there's a resurrection out of the grave of dark denominationalism there's a resurrection out of sin there's a resurrection out of Leo DEA and this promise to Israel has a beautiful spiritual types to the bride and a very literal type to all the redeemed who will come up out of the graves at the time of the great translation says and I shall and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and I shall place you in your own land then shall you know that I that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it sayith the Lord he will cause the dry bones to live again though the valley may be full of dry bones though it may wander through a spiritual desert though might seem to be forsaken there will come a time when the valley is no more dry bones when God pours out his spirit in such a way where it's the word of God being received into his body to animate her and to cause her to stand and be an exceeding great Army because God promised he will restore and the restoration of the brid tree brother Bram is taking a lot from Joel chapter 2 and he's going through the steps of showing that there were four different stages of the destruction and how that it was Locust and then cankerworm caterpillar and palmerworm and that it was he calls them four death Messengers and each one eating away different parts he goes into great details in this in this sermon restoration of the brid tree and other places and and I had a lot I wanted to read to and I think we're doing awesome on time and uh and so I'm just going to I'll try not going try to go quickly but I'm not going to belabor some things here and I'll just come to this part where he says four Killers took it four Messengers destroyed it four messengers of death took it away in dogmas so now there's this stage of Destruction he says four messengers of righteousness restore it back now to this point in the sermon and some of the things I'm skipping over where's a lot of references to Joel 2 a and the four death Messengers and then he's also referring to he comes back to it again he for refers to four life Messengers and I love it when you get to four because a lot of people who only add by threes all of a sudden you get to four and it's like wait a minute wait a minute stop uh but we don't ever use numerology to leave the word right we just we just want the word types Shadows numerology isn't what's so important it's the truth that's important and so here is a truth that we could see in the word of God now brother Bram says he's he's been looking at Joel too but now he says prophesy son of man can these bones live prophesy can these bones live now he has taken Joel to and this process of Destruction and he begins to marry it with Ezekiel 37 and and and you could even you could even begin to see that there was these stages of Bones coming together senu being added then skin and there was this noise and shaking and there's this restoration that takes place where you have what looks like bodies and people but then the Observer the prophet says there's no breath in them and brother brandham is now bringing Joel to where had four death Messengers and he connects it to Ezekiel 37 he says what's the four stages of the coming forth of that church what is the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming forth so this is the prophet kind of tying these two things together he says but the life only come not when the senu skin was on them but when the wind blow upon them that's when it come back that fourth message of life was brought back I will restore sayith the Lord he says hallelujah Glory praise be to God and I I second that he says the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same signs justification brought back the pulp sanctification brought back the bark do of doctrine of Holiness what brought back the leaf pentec costals what is it Pentecostals leaves clap their hands Joy rejoicing Pentecostal so there's your three stages of restoration to that point he said the fourth was the word itself there's a lot that we could show that the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost itself that he forms the wheat outside of those three stages that those three stages are critical but he even put the Pentecostal Le toine age as the shook but it's got to come back to see it again we're not creating a doctrine of fors but it's the truth and reality that God uses these three stages but then the ultimate product comes back to the original three stages of restoration but the original is the final climactic this last great step must come into Perfection he said you have repent you have justification sanctification the Seal of God which is the New Birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost those three stages make the new birth but then the last great step is into Perfection we've had the the restoration of the new birth and we've had certain great truths restored to us but there's got to come a bright age to this there's got to come an exodus in Ephesians age of Harvest Time am amen so he says this fourth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally I hope you can catch this finally after justification being planted sanctification being planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations died out this is the phrase to me that's so beautiful and Christ has again centered himself like that cap of the pyramid this is what it's got to come to that's Christ is the mystery of God revealed places this more uh uh permanently I guess you could say Christ has centered himself like the cap of the pyramid first line justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then coming of the cap he said what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch that maybe that could be a cover band for the believer's songs the Holy Ghost Bunch the Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away now then when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the Rapture when they're Justified Sanctified and the baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ has to come through that and Center himself again on the pyramid he's got to come back and make himself known unite together with it catch it away in a Rapture he says this the pyramid will stand again do what you want with it it's going to stand again I I don't cap it off he'll cap it off reduce it to Rebel it'll stand again he says the house of God will live again this statement has been at the heart now my heart for several months it's been kind of the inspiration even behind preaching on the house of God the house of God will live it again if there was a time where it was thriving and it was busy and everyone was in their place and the god presence of God was being made known and it was glorious and it was beautiful and the kingdom was at its peak and it's reduced to rubble and it's Forsaken and every all its instruments and everything is taken away and broken and the priesthood has fell and it's reduced to rubble and it's reduced to ruins and it's reduced to ashes and dust the house of God will live again carry all its instruments to the four corners of the earth bury in the sea burn it to ashes God will raise it up again he said the tree of life is growing [Music] again I can say it of this bride time this Harvest Time this is the time of redemption this is the time when these things are being restored what he's talking about is coming out of dust into Christ it's a it's a statement that serves my purpose for my titling but he taking it from ruin from the one who's Afflicted and overwhelmed from the oneand whose days are consumed like smoke and groaning as a prisoner who's hated whose days are like a shadow which decline who withered like grass the Lord will behold from heaven will look down from his Sanctuary to loose those appointed to death to build up and to bring forth Zion it's the time when he is going to breathe the word of God into your hearts through the open of the word to bring you back to full life again amen full manifestation in Isaiah chapter 61 veres 1 to4 just a few people reached out to me after last Wednesday night just shared some things that came on their heart and it was it was Ezekiel 37 it was Isaiah 61 you could just see there was already this uh part in your hearts like yeah this is what God's doing it says the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek Heath sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the open of the prison to them that are bound you can see some continuity with Psalms 102 you could see so much in here to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and in his first coming he stops Jesus doesn't read any further and so there's hundreds of years almost almost 200000 year comma and the day of Vengeance of our God which brother B says this this time this this the preach the acceptable year of the Lord this is related to his first coming now he's still Christ who binds the Brokenhearted who proclaims Liberty the open of the prison to them that are bound but he stopped at the day of Vengeance of our God because that relates to the time we're living in now now the day of Vengeance of our God continues to comfort all that mourn and now there's a new appointment if you read in Psalms 102 I realize now some of the things I cut out in the Book of Psalms might actually leave leave some of this out aren't you glad you have your Bible it says to hear in Psalm verse 20 to hear the groan of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death and here it says that there's going to be those appointed to death but he says I'm going to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion he changes your appointment amen I had an appointment to get a um a feeling back in I can't remember when it was sometime last year and I had a little bit of a cold and wasn't feeling well so I canceled it and guess what I haven't made a new one right don't you wish you could do that sometimes you can cancel appointments and never have to worry about them again but this is a this is a change of appointment tooed to them that mourn and Zion those that are overwhelmed those that are afflicted those that have been reduced to to Rubble those are mourning repenting in their ashes and dust to give unto them this is your new appointment to give unto them Beauty instead of Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness and that's what he wants to do is you're sitting there with the spirit of heaviness covered in this H in sackcloth covered in ashes and you're mourning and you have a spirit of heaviness and you're covered in ashes and he says let me have the ashes for beauty let me have your your mourning with the oil of Joy let me have your heaviness and give you a Garment of Praise what is he going to do what he takes away he gives back something he wants to restore you he wants to exchange he wants to give you a new appointment oh I wonder if any of us tonight are willing to let go of our mourning for the oil of Joy if we're willing to let go of the spirit of heaviness for a Garment of Praise are you willing to let go of the aces for beauty we might be called the tree of righteousness the Trees of Righteousness the tree of life growing again he says it's going to come back to her the Tree of Life That's you we might be called the Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified am and they shall build the old wastes they shall raise up the former desolations and they shall repair the waste cities the desolations of many generations even though it might have been for a long time tored down there will be a people that'll be the restoration the finality of all that's been destroyed all that's been defeated it may be dust but out of dust God raises it up may seem to be just ashes but God can do beautiful things with ashes it's actually going to turn your ashes into Beauty your mourning into joy and your heaviness into praise I would even you know just take some Liberty here at the end of this service to say he's going to turn those ashes into Beauty he's actually going to take your mour and turn it into Joy he's going to take your heaviness and by the spoken word of God make it praise and so the devil tells you we are nothing but ashes mourning and heaviness it's like well those are all the elements of beauty joy and praise those are the things that God uses to produce praise those are the things that God uses to bring joy those are the things that God uses to bring Beauty hey if you're rich in heaviness you're going to be rich in Praise if you're rich in asses you're going to be rich in Beauty all think about it we should not be defeated no matter what it is what's been or what's happened God has made me a promise from Death can come life what's the worst you can do I can murder you kill you burn you up and throw you in grave even from that from the de depths of the sea and from the valley wherever I am I'll hear my name and I'll come forth there's no victory and death there's no power of the Grave because from the waste from the desolations they'll be repair they'll bring a ra they'll be a raising up because that's the God I serve amen thank you Lord Jesus out of dust into heaven I used Heaven just to describe a Perfection a relationship with Christ it was inspired to me as I was studying on Esther too it just connected where vashy is this uh presented kind of as a evil queen refuses her husband and the King says take the throne away and give it to one who's better than vashan and it comes to Esther Esther chapter 2 I believe it is he says and the King chose her brings her to the Royal Palace and she was made Queen said of ashai and when you think about it Esther is one I we think we've shared this before and I think it's just something that's uh in the scripture it's often expressed she her her original Hebrew name was hadessa which is myrtle tree it's Earthbound and and carries with it this and myrr bitterness it speaks of death it's the cycle of life and death represented even in a tree and she's changed from Myrtle tree to Esther which is star and as the as brother bam talks about in some places and as we see in the scripture this image being brought from the dust to the heavens she's brought from a tree to to the heavenlies and this is what God does for us as Humanity we're born of a woman we're just a few days in full of trouble we come into this Earth stained we're not like Adam was in the beginning we're not it's not like it was then our lives are so uned from the reality that God had originally placed it and life is headed it's a it's a raise to a grave everyone's appointed to it but there's this story of redemption that God is going to take us who were Earthbound headed for a grave who Satan even felt he had ownership he argued over the body of Moses because of sin he goes That's my meat I have the right to eat that that's the Serpent's bread I have a right to that body I have a right to that flesh but God says I'm going to bruise crush your head and I'm even going to take those who succumb to death I'm going to raise them up out of their graves and give them glorify bodies and there will be a people who are alive and remain who will not taste death what will but will be changed in a m in a twinkl of an eye and will be exalted from the dust to the Stars amen and brother brandham says where where can we put this woman where can we put her he said she's exalted to the very Throne of God as the only place befitting such a queen from dust to a throne out of dust into heaven into Christ so I I leave you with this lengthy statement from the sermon the absolute or absolute is what it's called is March 4th that's that's a command March 4th and he said in 1963 and if you recall the settings of this and I'd like to get into this in more detail uh later on if the Lord would allow me to he has asked to go speak he's asked to go and uh speak at this prayer meeting because a young man and a young woman were facing the death p penalty and so it was a kind and he had relation to another Minister there the the young man did I believe and so there was just a real urgent time if you could just get this in your minds there's a time where the penalty of death is being held over someone who's guilty in in the eyes of the of the prosecutor who's had there was guilt in his life if we could say that and so brother I'm speaking in this and I don't want you necessarily to get your mind working in that but now just make this very personal as we close on this remember how that we began last Wednesday and remind you today that there's such a pressure that's being built up till you come to a place where you break you snap and you do things that you wouldn't normally do brother Bram says now if in your life you have an absolute you do things ordinarily you would not do okay well I thought that was I thought we were going to end on that one okay well let me let me let me try it another way okay should I take my coat off I'll I'll say it louder oh I know what I can do if your life has an absolute he says you'll do things you would not normally do especially if you have a god- centered life the god- centered life makes a person do things that ordinarily they would not do so there's an opposite to this there's a life that we live that we're forced to do things we otherwise wouldn't normally do it's out of character but there's also a place that you can come in Christ where if I'm in the dirt I'm in the dust and I'm being pressured by this world I'll do things I otherwise wouldn't do but I could also come to him and give V to my frustrations and when I have an absolute and I have a god- centered life it'll make me do things I ordinarily wouldn't do he says very odd peculiar why is a Christian life so odd and peculiar because they're looking to God's word which is almost foreign to the world today that's what we're looking to we're looking to God's word the world sees you burdened the world sees you down in the dust the world sees you on the ash Heap and it's expecting you to curse God it's expecting you to act out of character it would actually say hey buddy I don't mind if you cuss I'd do the same thing it they don't mind it they understand I know why he went crazy I know why he did this they can relate to it but there's a people who could be in that very same circumstance and say you speak like a foolish woman why would I deny am now why would I give up now why would I lose my hope now why would I act like that why would I lose that why would I lose my control why would I give in why would I snap I've got a promise in him job served a God that could turn every single one of those pieces of ashes into everything he had lost he was sitting on a gold mine he says why Christians are odd it's because they're looking to God's word he says now we have a churches we have organizations we have religion oh so much of it around the world but that isn't what I'm talking about I'm talking about an absolute connected with Christ then it makes you an odd person you do odd things your thinking is altogether different than the thinking you once did because you found something that you've anchored a faith in someone that created the heavens and the Earth that his very word itself is creative a God who spoke the world into existence and there's nothing too hard for him I'm I'm just I'm wanting to end on this statement just a way of kind of summing up this out of out of dust into heaven as a way of just to encourage you and just give you something positive to go forward in he said the very word is creative it's a God who spoke the world in existence and there's nothing too hard for him that's what you who are under pressure are looking to and that's why you act odd and do things you ordinarily wouldn't do Under Pressure so you're going to act out of character either way or you're going to do something you wouldn't ordinarily do but it could be negative or it can be positive he says so you're looking to the word you have an absolute where you're connected with Christ where there's nothing too hard for him and listen so it makes you creative yourself because you take his words amen right it makes you creative amen gives you power why because the word has gone forth and you've breathed that in you're connected to it you're tied to it and the word is a thought expressed he said Paul had to go into that state where he had to not a theological experience but he had a personal witness he met God and he knew that he was called of God and nobody had to tell him anything about it he was absolutely sure that God still remained God if the world could just do that remember that group there that night was fearful of death it was coming it was at the doorstep and if this group night set in here could just remember that God is still God and I'm not saying this to those who are in Houston I'm not repeating this to remind people in Houston but I say it to us here tonight if this group could just remember that God is still God there's nothing too hard for him he's the one that created the world by his spoken word and that word is in you and it makes you creative remember that he's still God he's just as able to answer in this case as the in is a of Divine Healing or anything else you recognize just the parallel that we can make now sometimes well God said he's a Healer he'll answer healing and we think that if we're sick God's going to come on the scene and heal our bodies but here was a court case and a trial and the and the the possibility of a death sentence he says he's able to answer in matters like this just like he is in Divine Healing so we could just take that and extend it out whatever it is he cares if it concerns you he will perfect that which concerneth you that God is mind ful of what you're going through if I could say this if God's servants would favor the dust if they would look favorable upon the ruins then what do you think God thinks when he looks at you he sees in you the beauty of that New Jerusalem he sees the purchase he sees the Power he sees the glory he sees the beauty he's not giving up on you and he says by I can do this I can heal you I can raise you up whatever it might be says he's still God in the case of divine Hill or anything else he's still God and if we can build our hopes not only our hopes but a positive thought upon what he says amen invite the musicians to come and we know that it is the truth amen and people act funny think of this think this this is the part just coming to I know it's lengthy uh we're not going to get into an after hour tonight so we're just right here in this moment he says they seem to just forget about the negative side because they found an absolute because it's the word of God can I just challenge you with that tonight am there's a little bit of a reflection in here they seem to forget the negative side I just wanted to say it to me I want to forget the negative side I know I spent a lot of time in these last two Services talking a lot about the negative side but we've got to come to a place where we just seem to forget the negative side because we found an absolute and you say well forgetting I can't do that well that CU that's divine right to to forgive is human to forget is divine says forget about the negative side because they found an absolute Jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail so if he got the Word of Promise then there's no failing to it it cannot fail so I'm believing that that's what the prayer meetings here the religious people of Houston are interested in human lives and that's what we're gathered here for is to call on a power that's beyond all man-made laws and Powers something who could change the hearts of men like he did Pharaoh in Egypt and he's still God Amen but he says this to these people in desperation and maybe people so closely connected to it there there was maybe a lot of fear and maybe too much aware of the situation he says and we must stop now looking at the negative side and go to looking at the positive side and that's what I want us to do turn our eyes to Heaven turn our eyes to the word of God turn our eyes to Jesus Christ away from the negative side let our eyes behold heaven let her eyes behold his Beauty let her eyes behold his Perfection for I am no longer Earthbound I'm no longer dustbound but but I have be G to rise my my heart is set on Heaven I I'm like that boy who's holding on to a kite I can feel something tugging on the other side the morning uh the sunlight has risen and I feel something pulsating within me this is the day to rise and shine for my light has come and I'm not left in Le de I'm not Earthbound I'm not discouraged I'm not defeated my flesh may feel so and there might be a lot of negative side but oh God help me tonight may I be one who can look to you and call on a power that's beyond man-made laws that's beyond the rulers of this land and stop looking at the negative and look at the positive help me Lord to do that in all things father help me help me to do that Lord in all things let's pray oh God we pray tonight that you would help us to not look at the negative Lord in this maybe this two-part these companion Services last Wednesday and tonight we focused a lot on the dust seemingly the negative side but Lord I was so wrapped up in the thought that even while I was describing Mankind in such horrible terms and using the example of job I it never dawned on me just how dark it could seem because even in the ashes there was Beauty even in the suffering it's pregnant with Glory that every every ounce of pain is a seat of Promise every hurt every bruise every harm Every Lie every wound every sin Lord everything that we could think of every Speck of dust has the potential of Glory because of your word and Lord even as we would describe a valley full of dry bones we know what it's going to be so we do not look at Dry Bones as the evidence of death but we see in it the potential of cartilage and tendon and senu and muscle and skin and we see the promise of the wind to breathe into us the Breath of [Music] God and Father if Paul could say I know all things work together for the good then may we father believe that the suffering of this present time is not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us that my past my Rebellion my suffering my stains my sins even my memories Lord I could be brought back to things that be so burdened with the negative I want to start looking to the positive the positive that I'm Justified the positive that I'm Sanctified the positive that I'm his son and daughter the positive that I'm rising to meet you in the air and Lord may we be a people as brother brandham admonished that group in Houston so many years ago may we be a people that doesn't just look to the negative but looks to the positive and with all of our heaviness and all our mourning and all of our ashes may we realize that those have the potential to become Beauty joy and praise Lord I pray for your people tonight as they set Lord if some standing some with lifted hand whatever they may have in their hearts I pray that you would encourage them tremendously Lord take us out of dust into Christ I commit them to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
