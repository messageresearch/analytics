[0:00] Hebrews chapter 1 verse one. God who at
[0:03] sunundry times and in diverse manner
[0:05] spake in time past unto the fathers by
[0:07] the prophets hath in these last days
[0:10] spoken unto us by his son whom he hath
[0:13] appointed heir of all things by whom
[0:15] also he made the worlds. Who being the
[0:17] brightness of his glory and the express
[0:19] image of his person and upholding all
[0:21] things by the word of his power. when he
[0:23] had by himself purged our sin, sat down
[0:26] on the right hand of the majesty on
[0:28] high, being made so much better than the
[0:31] angels, as he hath by inheritance
[0:33] obtained a more excellent name than
[0:34] they. For under for unto which of the
[0:37] angels said he at any time, thou art my
[0:39] son this day have I begotten thee? And
[0:41] again, I will be to him a father, and he
[0:44] shall be to me a son. And again, when he
[0:46] bringeth in the first begotten in the
[0:48] world, he saith, "And let all the angels
[0:50] of God worship him."
[0:53] And I guess verse seven, I don't think I
[0:54] I do go to verse nine. And the angels he
[0:56] say of the angels, he saith, who maketh
[0:58] his angel spirits, and his ministers a
[1:00] flame of fire. But under the son he
[1:02] saith, thy throne, oh God, is forever
[1:04] and ever. The scepter of righteousness
[1:06] is the scepter of thy kingdom. Thou hast
[1:09] loved righteousness and hated iniquity.
[1:10] Therefore, God, even thy God, hath
[1:12] anointed thee with the oil of gladness
[1:14] above thy fellows. Amen. God's son is
[1:18] better than the angels. He has a scepter
[1:20] of righteousness. Speaks to Jesus
[1:22] Christ. What glorious uh verses we've
[1:25] read. You could be seated.
[1:27] I'm going to give the title this evening
[1:29] of portrait of humanity. Portrait of
[1:32] humanity. And if you could take in just
[1:35] a little bit uh this title slide because
[1:37] I want to revisit it here in just a
[1:39] little bit. I'm very excited about
[1:41] tonight's topic and um and I just
[1:44] believe that there's something very
[1:46] simple that's revealed in this. It's
[1:48] very straightforward, but it should be
[1:49] thoughtprovoking. I don't expect it to
[1:51] be very lengthy, but I'd really like you
[1:54] um just to focus in the short little
[1:56] time we have together and think of this
[1:57] portrait of humanity. On Sunday, we
[2:01] spoke on portrait of a perfect man. And
[2:04] in looking at that, we're drawing from
[2:06] uh the stature of a perfect man and how
[2:08] that in Jesus Christ uh was expressed
[2:11] this image of God and we're using this
[2:15] idea of a portrait. At the very
[2:16] beginning, we talked about how that art
[2:18] has power to influence our belief and
[2:20] that the way things are portrayed in
[2:22] verse or poems or in literature and even
[2:24] in the visual arts that it can influence
[2:27] culture and cultural values because it
[2:30] has great ability to embed itself in the
[2:33] mind. It's for this reason. I don't know
[2:35] if people are getting distracted. Maybe
[2:36] brother Mitch, we should maybe take that
[2:38] down. I'm starting to get to think I
[2:40] want to People are thinking about what
[2:41] in the world did he just show us? But
[2:43] something to think about. And um but
[2:47] [laughter]
[2:47] I maybe some of us haven't even
[2:49] considered this, but there's a reason
[2:50] why many people believe the wise men
[2:52] were at the manger scene when Jesus
[2:54] Christ was born. And the reason why they
[2:56] believe that often is because that's the
[2:58] way it's portrayed in picture. It's
[3:00] portrayed that way in art. It's it's
[3:02] sung that way in songs. And so we just
[3:04] in our minds imagine the wise men being
[3:07] at the manger scene. But scripturally,
[3:08] the wise men were not there at the
[3:10] manger scene. They came later when he
[3:12] was a child. And we used to have this
[3:14] joke in our family growing up that uh
[3:16] whenever we'd set up the manger scene,
[3:19] uh there was actually wise men that went
[3:20] along with it and we always said they
[3:22] should be in the front yard or we should
[3:24] put them in the backyard cuz they're
[3:25] still on their way there. But it's that
[3:28] image of the wise men being there that
[3:30] causes many just to assume they were
[3:32] there or to have that belief. And that's
[3:34] the power of art. And so as uh art has
[3:38] the ability to or and has been used to
[3:41] reflect uh cultural values, if its
[3:44] representation is not true, then instead
[3:47] of mirroring reality, it can change
[3:49] reality. Just like that image of the
[3:50] wise men, it can actually shape culture
[3:53] because you present an image that you
[3:55] want that you think is right. But if
[3:57] it's not right, then instead of it
[3:58] reflecting culture, it can actually have
[4:00] great power to shape culture. So art has
[4:02] that ability to embed itself in our
[4:05] minds. And we're we're using this
[4:07] thought that the scriptures speak to us
[4:09] and paint the picture of Jesus Christ.
[4:11] If we want to know who Jesus Christ is,
[4:13] we can start with this Bible. The New
[4:15] Testament tells us his story and it
[4:17] paints the picture of Jesus Christ. And
[4:19] so therefore, that picture must be
[4:21] accurate. It must be portrayed. And we
[4:24] covered a lot on Sunday that we're not
[4:26] going to get into tonight, but we're
[4:28] we're definitely drawing from that. Now
[4:30] in this sermon portrait of humanity, I'm
[4:33] asking really what is the image of man
[4:36] that's painted by the life of Jesus
[4:38] Christ. We know that we believe that he
[4:40] was the son of God. He was uh born of a
[4:43] virgin, but he was not conceived by man.
[4:45] So that we say that he was a man, a god
[4:49] man that he was both all man and all
[4:51] god. And so there's a there's this
[4:52] humanity to Christ otherwise he could
[4:54] not have died. Uh there's a humanity. So
[4:57] what is this image of man that's painted
[4:59] by the life that Christ lived? Hebrews
[5:02] chapter 1 verse one it says God who at
[5:04] sunundry times and in diverse manner
[5:06] spake in time past unto the fathers by
[5:08] the prophets hath in these last days
[5:10] spoken unto us by his son whom he hath
[5:13] appointed heir of all things by whom
[5:15] also he hath made the world. So, that's
[5:17] a lot that's being said in that
[5:19] statement. And we see that Jesus Christ
[5:22] is uh who had come in the flesh, who had
[5:26] most recently walked upon earth. He says
[5:28] that's what he's referring to. He's
[5:29] spoken to us by his son through Jesus
[5:31] Christ. Verse three, who be the
[5:33] brightness of his glory in the expressed
[5:35] image of his person. Jesus Christ is the
[5:39] expressed image of God. Covered a lot of
[5:41] those scriptures on Sunday. He and we're
[5:44] going to see here he's endued with power
[5:46] over all things and and the express
[5:49] image of his person upholding all things
[5:51] by the word of his power when he had by
[5:53] himself purged our sins. We see the lamb
[5:55] of God in that sat down on the right
[5:57] hand of the majesty on high. So now he's
[5:59] that in that position of power and
[6:00] authority being made so much better than
[6:03] the angels as he hath by inheritance
[6:05] obtained a more excellent name than
[6:07] they. A lot of lot of words in here, a
[6:10] lot of phrases, a lot of truths that are
[6:11] being packed together. But he's made
[6:13] higher than the angels. And he secured
[6:15] an inheritance of all power, all honor,
[6:17] and all glory. And he had a calling to
[6:20] be a sacrifice for sins. He has purged
[6:22] sins by the sacrifice of himself. He's
[6:25] not just an angel, but he is the son of
[6:27] God. And he's obtained this inheritance.
[6:30] Says in Colossians 1 19, for it pleased
[6:33] the father that in him should all
[6:36] fullness dwell. Fullness of God dwells
[6:39] in the Son. Colossians chapter 2:9, for
[6:41] in him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[6:44] godhead bodily.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; This is who Jesus Christ is. He is the
[6:48] express image of God.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; When you've seen me, you've seen the
[6:52] father.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; He is the heart of God. He is God in
[6:56] flesh. He is the word made flesh.
[6:59] &gt;&gt; The fullness of God dwelt in him. The
[7:01] fullness of the Godhead bodily is
[7:02] manifested in him. In John chapter 17:es
[7:06] 1:7,
[7:08] these words spake Jesus and lifted up
[7:10] his eyes to heaven and said, "Father,
[7:12] the hour has come. Glorified thy son
[7:15] that thy son also may glorify thee, as
[7:18] thou hast given him power over all
[7:21] flesh." This is what has been committed
[7:23] to Jesus Christ. He has power over all
[7:25] flesh that he should give eternal life
[7:27] to as many as thou hast given him. Look
[7:30] at this incredible role that the son has
[7:32] now as being the express image of God
[7:35] has been given power over all flesh. Uh
[7:37] it says in in John in one place just
[7:39] before the uh the last supper that
[7:42] knowing that all things have been given
[7:43] into his hands that he came from God and
[7:45] went to God. Says and this is life
[7:48] eternal that they might know thee the
[7:50] only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou
[7:53] has sent. Verse four says I have
[7:55] glorified thee on earth. I have finished
[7:57] the work which thou gavest me to do. So
[8:00] think of this expression of the son. He
[8:02] is God in flesh. He has power over all
[8:05] other flesh. He was given a work to do.
[8:08] He says he's finished it. And now, oh
[8:10] father, glorify thou me with thine own
[8:11] self with the glory which I had with
[8:13] thee before the world was. I have
[8:16] manifested thy name. This is what a son
[8:18] does. He manifest his the father's name.
[8:21] I've manifested thy name unto the men
[8:23] which thou gavest me out of the world.
[8:25] Thine they were, and thou gavest them
[8:27] me, and they have kept thy word. Now
[8:30] they have known that all things
[8:32] whatsoever thou hast given me are of
[8:34] thee. This is uh there's more words that
[8:37] we could share. There's a lot of
[8:38] scriptures that we could use in these
[8:40] instances that speaks of Christ in
[8:42] Hebrews 11 and also in Colossians and
[8:44] now in John 17 about Jesus Christ having
[8:48] this role. He only does what the father
[8:50] tells him to do. He acts and speaks
[8:52] according to the directions that God
[8:54] gives him. Therefore, he's manifesting
[8:56] God's will and God's desire. And he
[8:59] says, and we see here that God's son had
[9:02] a commission to do God's work and to
[9:05] declare or manifest his name. So, as the
[9:09] gospels tell the story of Jesus Christ,
[9:11] they're painting a picture of God. We
[9:14] can read that he was the express image
[9:16] of his person. He upheld everything by
[9:18] the word of his power. That he finished
[9:19] the works that he was given to do. that
[9:21] whatsoever things you gave me or of
[9:23] thee, the disciples know this. How h how
[9:25] h how what are these things? It's that
[9:28] which is portrayed in this short window
[9:30] to his life. We see him at his birth. We
[9:32] see him at 12 years old. Then we see him
[9:35] at his baptism. And we see this brief
[9:37] look into his life and his ministry of
[9:39] those three and a half years we often
[9:40] say and that is a picture of God
[9:43] unfolding himself.
[9:45] So, in this portrait of Jesus Christ, it
[9:48] expresses the image of God. I looked at
[9:52] um well, there's different ways that you
[9:55] can number it. Some say 40, some say 30
[9:58] or 31, but I looked at all these
[9:59] different miracles in Jesus Christ's
[10:02] ministry.
[10:04] And let's just I I I want to go by way
[10:07] more of summary than turning to the
[10:08] different scriptures. I thought about
[10:09] maybe turning to some and reading them,
[10:11] but I think we're well verssed on a
[10:12] Wednesday night. I feel very comfortable
[10:14] just referring to them. But we know that
[10:16] Jesus had dominion over nature
[10:19] &gt;&gt; when he was in the boat there on the sea
[10:22] and it was being tossed about and he
[10:23] they said he sleeps. He said they they
[10:25] woke him up and what did he do? He spoke
[10:27] to the winds and the waves and he said
[10:30] peace uh be still. And what happened? He
[10:33] calmed the storm. He stealed the waves.
[10:35] Waves. So he had dominion over nature by
[10:38] calming the storm. And then if we can
[10:39] see in this picture that I gave you at
[10:41] the beginning, he had he upset even
[10:44] those those laws of nature. Brother
[10:46] Mitch, if we could get that uh that
[10:48] slide up there. I think it's the next
[10:50] one on there. Yeah, there we go. That he
[10:54] calmed that he had power over the laws
[10:56] of nature by walking on water. You're
[10:59] not you're not supposed to be able to do
[11:00] that. What is that? That's defying
[11:03] natural laws or he had power over them.
[11:06] that he was not just subject to law, the
[11:08] law of na nature. He but he had power
[11:11] over it. And as you look at this
[11:13] picture, it might seem odd to you, but
[11:14] this was a painting done by a Christian
[11:17] uh a Korean Christian artist, and he did
[11:20] a series of 31 paintings, and I was able
[11:22] to uncover all of them. It was quite a
[11:24] work just to find the digital rep um
[11:26] reproduction of it. And he painted the
[11:28] life of Jesus from the enunciation to
[11:31] Mary all the way to his ascension and
[11:33] these different instances in his
[11:35] ministry. But he painted him how he
[11:36] might have looked in traditional Korean
[11:38] dress. And I thought it was good because
[11:41] when we think about the portrait of
[11:42] Jesus Christ, uh that this this would be
[11:45] what he perhaps would have looked like
[11:48] had he been a Korean messiah.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; So I'm not I'm not sharing it maybe uh
[11:52] to to for humor, but this is him walking
[11:55] on the water, Peter in the waves, and
[11:57] he's he's being characterized just as a
[12:00] normal man. And of course, the the halo
[12:02] kind of gives them that aura of deity,
[12:04] but this is Christ now walking on the
[12:06] wave supernaturally, having power over
[12:10] gravity, over nature to walk on the
[12:12] water. And Peter steps out and he starts
[12:15] doing it, too. And it's represented in
[12:17] this picture. Think of all these
[12:20] instances where not only does he have
[12:22] dominion over nature, but he turns water
[12:23] into wine.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Again, that that has some power over the
[12:26] elements. He multiplied the bread and
[12:28] the fish. In the next slide, this is a a
[12:31] representation of him multiplying out
[12:33] creation, taking bread and multiplying,
[12:36] taking fish and multiplying it. This is
[12:38] what this is God being expressed amongst
[12:41] the people.
[12:43] He caused
[12:44] uh and in some instances they call it a
[12:47] miraculous catch where he said, "Cast
[12:48] your net over here." And they brought in
[12:50] a a catch that was miraculous. He able
[12:52] to place a coin as it were into a fish's
[12:55] mouth.
[12:57] In the next slide we see him healing the
[12:59] sick. He healed the sick in multiple
[13:01] instances. The blind received their
[13:03] sight. The lepers were cleansed. The
[13:04] crippled could walk. The deaf heard. The
[13:07] mute spoke. Talks about one with dropsy.
[13:09] Those with blood issues. God did all
[13:12] these Christ did all these things. And
[13:14] what was he expressing? The father.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; And each one of these instances he was
[13:18] expressing the father. And the reason
[13:20] why I chose to use this type of artwork
[13:23] is because if this is it would have just
[13:26] looked like maybe a normal scene,
[13:29] &gt;&gt; but yet something supernatural is
[13:31] unfolding.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; He restored that uh soldier's ear when
[13:35] he had been cut off. He took a withered
[13:37] hand and restored that back. See, in
[13:39] many different instances where he
[13:41] controlled the spiritual realm by
[13:42] casting out demons.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; This is all done by Jesus Christ. Amen.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; He had power over life to curse a tree.
[13:49] He had power over death to raise the
[13:51] dead.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; He did all this
[13:55] in manifesting the father.
[13:59] So,
[14:00] uh, if I could say this without spending
[14:03] a lot of time on that, I do want you to
[14:05] think about all these supernatural
[14:06] miracles that he did. Raising the dead,
[14:08] multiplying creation, walking on water,
[14:10] stopping the storm. these uh from the
[14:12] moment that he turned water into wine to
[14:14] where he healed the noble man's son to
[14:16] where he spoke and at that same hour
[14:18] this person was healed where he he said
[14:20] things without even touching them and
[14:22] they were healed a blood issue was
[14:23] healed just by someone touching the hem
[14:25] of his garment all these different
[14:26] things were the an expression of God
[14:30] &gt;&gt; but this is where I'm turning it just a
[14:33] little bit not just an expression of God
[14:35] but also a portrait of humanity
[14:39] &gt;&gt; in Philippians chapter 2:ES 6-11 it says
[14:43] who being in the form of God thought it
[14:45] not robbery to be equal with God
[14:47] speaking of Jesus Christ but made
[14:49] himself of no reputation and took upon
[14:52] him the form of a servant and was made
[14:54] in the likeness of men so we see where
[14:58] he was the express image of his person
[15:01] made in the likeness of God he had the
[15:03] name image and likeness of God but now
[15:05] he's found in the likeness of men and
[15:07] being found in fashion as a man he
[15:09] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[15:11] death, even the death of the cross. We
[15:14] see how this is mirrored also in
[15:16] Hebrews. Wherefore God also hath highly
[15:18] exalted him, and given him a name which
[15:20] is above every name, that at the name of
[15:22] Jesus, every knee should bow of things
[15:24] in heaven and things in earth, and
[15:25] things under the earth, and that every
[15:26] tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
[15:29] is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[15:32] Amen.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; God was in, excuse me, God was in
[15:37] Christ, the Bible tells us, reconciling
[15:40] the world to himself, but Christ came in
[15:42] the form of a man.
[15:45] And
[15:47] when you look at
[15:50] the story of Jesus Christ in the
[15:51] Gospels, the painting of Christ paints
[15:54] the picture of man that he came as a
[15:57] man. And when they looked at him, you
[15:58] being a man not over 50, you being the
[16:01] son of Joseph, he he had these he wept.
[16:04] He hungered. There all these different
[16:06] characters about him where he was made
[16:08] in the fashion of fashion as man. But
[16:11] when he was performing these miracles,
[16:14] I've I've I've offered that that was a
[16:17] portrait of humanity as well.
[16:21] He controlled nature.
[16:23] He he had power over life and death. But
[16:27] look at man in the beginning because it
[16:28] says he was made in the likeness of man
[16:30] in Genesis 1:es 26-30. And God said let
[16:34] us make man in our image after our
[16:36] likeness and let them have dominion. So
[16:38] this is man as he was originally
[16:40] intended to be. God was made man was
[16:43] made in the image of God
[16:45] &gt;&gt; in the likeness of God and given the
[16:47] power of God as a God on earth.
[16:51] He had dominion over the fish of the sea
[16:53] and over the fowl of the air and over
[16:54] the cattle and over all the earth and
[16:55] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[16:57] upon the earth. So God created man in
[17:00] his own image. In the image of God
[17:02] created he him. Male and female created
[17:04] he them. So we could say that man
[17:07] originally was in the image and likeness
[17:10] of God. Not a begotten son but a created
[17:13] son in the image of God. And God blessed
[17:17] them, and said unto them, "Be fruitful,
[17:18] and multiply, and replenish the earth,
[17:19] and subdue it, and have dominion over
[17:22] the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
[17:23] of the air, and over every living thing
[17:25] that moveth upon the earth." Do you see
[17:27] the parallel now to when Jesus Christ
[17:29] has power to say, "Cast your net over
[17:31] here," and there's a miraculous catch.
[17:33] He has a coin in a fish's mouth. When
[17:35] he's able to take creation and multiply
[17:37] it out, he's able to command to the
[17:38] winds to be still. He's able to walk on
[17:40] the water. He's expressing something
[17:42] that was innate in man in the beginning.
[17:47] God said, "Behold, I've given you every
[17:49] herb bearing seed which is upon the face
[17:51] of the earth as he multiplied out that
[17:53] bread." He had power over that grain
[17:56] originally,
[17:58] over everything I've given it to you.
[18:01] Over every herb bearing seed which is
[18:03] upon the face of all the earth, every
[18:04] tree which is the which is the fruit of
[18:07] the tree yielding seed. He could curse a
[18:08] fig tree. Jesus could. But man was
[18:11] originally given that power. To you it
[18:13] shall be for meat. to every beast of the
[18:15] earth and to every foul of the air and
[18:16] to everything that creepeth upon the
[18:17] earth where then there is life. I have
[18:19] given every green herb for meat and it
[18:22] was so. We could say Adam was God on
[18:25] earth. We say that about the second
[18:27] Adam, he was God in flesh, the word made
[18:29] flesh. He was the son of God. But Adam
[18:31] was a created son of God as God on earth
[18:35] &gt;&gt; endued with power and authority with
[18:37] this dominion. As a son, he was heir to
[18:40] all the father's work to his creation.
[18:42] And he God had created it up to that
[18:44] point. He said, "Here it is. It's yours.
[18:46] Finish the work."
[18:48] &gt;&gt; He was to further the father's vision.
[18:50] In the Hebrew, son means a builder of
[18:52] the family name.
[18:54] Says in 1 Corinthians 1:7, excuse me,
[18:57] 11:7, "For a man indeed ought not to
[19:00] cover his head, for as much as he is the
[19:02] image and glory of God."
[19:06] &gt;&gt; This is this is humanity. This is man.
[19:10] He is in the image and glory of God.
[19:13] Now, I know that there's uh maybe some
[19:16] of you your thoughts are really running
[19:17] here, but think of how that that Christ
[19:23] came and bypassed
[19:26] any human means of blood cell and sperm
[19:29] and egg. And he didn't come forth
[19:32] through anything that would be hybrid,
[19:34] anything that would be mixed. So he's
[19:36] not the genes of Mary and the genes of
[19:37] Joseph, but he comes and he bypasses
[19:40] that. And having bypassed that kind of
[19:43] conception, though he's born of a woman,
[19:45] he steps forth as in in a way as the
[19:48] first Adam did
[19:50] &gt;&gt; without any kind of mixing or hybridity.
[19:52] No, no this gene or this ethnicity or
[19:55] nothing nothing mixed in. Adam came
[19:56] stepped from God by the spoken word. His
[19:59] flesh made out of uh the elements of the
[20:01] earth. Now Christ comes forth and we
[20:03] could say that he is the last Adam, the
[20:05] second Adam
[20:07] &gt;&gt; as a as a restoration of Adam's race
[20:12] and Adam and man in the beginning was in
[20:14] the image and the glory of God.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; So when we look at these supernatural
[20:18] miracles of Jesus Christ,
[20:21] I just take me just uh I don't want to
[20:26] say humor me, but consider it this way.
[20:29] It's not a portrait of divinity. It is a
[20:33] portrait of humanity.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Because when we READ IN GENESIS 1, MAN
[20:38] WAS GIVEN POWER.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Man could have walked on water. Man
[20:41] could have multiplied creation. Man
[20:43] could have subdued all the fish and the
[20:45] foul. Man could have turned water into
[20:47] wine. Man man could have done all those
[20:49] things.
[20:50] And now Christ is doing it not as this,
[20:53] oh wow, LOOK WHAT GOD could do, but oh
[20:56] wow, look what man can do.
[20:59] John 5:36 he says, "But I have greater
[21:02] witness than that of John." This is
[21:04] Jesus speaking, "For the works which the
[21:06] father hath given me to finish the same
[21:08] works that I do."
[21:10] He bear witness of me that the father
[21:12] hath sent me. Jesus said, "I am
[21:14] finishing the father's works." The works
[21:16] that I do are to finish a divine work.
[21:19] What was it that Adam was to do? To
[21:21] carry out and fulfill a divine work. But
[21:24] it was the work of humanity. It was the
[21:26] work of flesh. Do you realize that God
[21:30] is not doing something unseen in heaven?
[21:33] The lamb was slain before the foundation
[21:35] of the world, but it had to be
[21:36] manifested here. It had to be manifested
[21:38] in flesh. So God's just not happy. And
[21:41] God's just not one that has all these
[21:42] things in another dimension. And he's
[21:44] happy being God and just every once in a
[21:46] while he messes with our minds by doing
[21:48] something in the world that upsets
[21:50] things and things get turned upside down
[21:51] and I cause the world to flood. Woohoo.
[21:53] Look what happened. Everybody doesn't
[21:55] know what. No, God wants to be seen and
[21:56] to known and be expressed. And he does
[21:59] that through flesh. So Christ on earth
[22:02] is the father made flesh. And he says,
[22:04] I'm finishing the father's works. The
[22:06] same works I do. Then in John 14:12,
[22:10] verily, verily, I send to you, he that
[22:11] believeth on me. The works that I do
[22:14] shall he do also. And greater works than
[22:17] these shall he do, because I go unto my
[22:19] father.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Now the works that Christ did, you'll
[22:23] do.
[22:24] the very same works
[22:27] &gt;&gt; as he was able to have dominion
[22:30] and power, heal the sick, raise the
[22:33] dead, cast out devils, and all these
[22:37] things that Christ portrayed the Messiah
[22:39] did in the flesh as a man. He's saying,
[22:42] "These works shall you do also." Now, if
[22:44] he had been an apparition and just a
[22:46] ghost or we're just kind of uh uh trying
[22:49] to read the tea leaves as it were and
[22:51] things are happening and we're just kind
[22:52] of suspicious that this must be God,
[22:54] this must be the Messiah, uh then it
[22:56] would be something unattainable that we
[22:58] would just be submitting ourselves to
[23:00] some sort of sorcery or witchcraft, some
[23:03] divination to make things happen. But
[23:05] yet, this was God in flesh doing these
[23:08] things. And now we believe that if the
[23:09] same God is in us,
[23:11] &gt;&gt; not only will he quicken our mortal
[23:13] bodies now, but then he'll give us power
[23:14] over death. He gives us power to raise
[23:16] the dead. Gives us power to go create a
[23:18] world and live on it.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; Because that's what God can do in man.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Now, he could do it on his own without
[23:24] man. But God uses man.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; In Romans chapter 8 14 to 21, for as
[23:31] many as are led by the spirit of God,
[23:33] they are the sons of God. For ye have
[23:36] not received the spirit of bondage again
[23:38] to fear, but you have received the
[23:40] spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, aba,
[23:42] father. Brother Steven Coffee used this
[23:45] verse uh on Wednesday night last week.
[23:47] It was just very beautiful. I thought
[23:48] that service was extraordinary. I meant
[23:51] to mention it, but uh he said that I if
[23:55] we are not if we are not able to express
[23:58] Christ to the community and he said,
[24:00] "What good is church?" Right?
[24:02] &gt;&gt; I thought it was just so so profound the
[24:04] things he expressed in that service. He
[24:06] said, 'The spirit itself bear witness
[24:07] with our spirit that we are the children
[24:10] of God.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was the son of God. What
[24:12] does the Bible said? The firstborn among
[24:14] many brethren. So there's some sort of
[24:17] there's this equality that we begin to
[24:19] have with Jesus Christ. And what I'm
[24:21] wanting you to recognize is the things
[24:23] that we most often would say are godlike
[24:25] and supernatural. OH, THAT'S GOD. THOSE
[24:28] are human. Amen.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; We are the sons of God and if children
[24:34] then hes of God and joint heirs with
[24:36] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[24:38] that we may be also glorified together.
[24:42] So there's the we're children of God.
[24:43] We're heirs of God. We're joint airs
[24:46] with Christ. We've been elevated to the
[24:47] same role in this position through the
[24:49] blood of Jesus Christ with Christ. For I
[24:51] reckon that the sufferings of this
[24:53] present time are not worthy to be
[24:55] compared with the glory which shall be
[24:57] revealed in us.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad that there is a promise
[25:01] of glory for all the things that we
[25:03] suffer.
[25:06] And so we know then that whatever it is
[25:09] we endure, persevere through, whatever
[25:11] it is that's most difficult for us, that
[25:13] pain we could say is expectant and it
[25:16] must deliver glory.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. for the earnest expectation of the
[25:22] creature. Notice this, the earnest
[25:24] anticipation, the hope of creation waits
[25:28] for the manifestation of the sons of
[25:31] God.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; All of creation,
[25:36] &gt;&gt; the waves, the wind, the the the grass,
[25:39] the the all the herb. Go back and read
[25:42] in Genesis 1. All these things that man
[25:44] was given to be uh have dominion over
[25:47] and it was given to them. every
[25:49] herbbearing seed, all the fish and the
[25:51] foul and all the beast and all those
[25:53] things that creepeth. Man was placed to
[25:55] rule over it. So when man lost this
[25:58] glory in the fall and as man be to be
[26:01] hybrid and and weakened a a and now
[26:05] steps forth degenerate through his
[26:07] natural birth, creation has been longing
[26:10] for this restoration
[26:14] of everything that was lost in the fall
[26:16] for the manifestation of the sons of
[26:18] God. For the creature was made subject
[26:20] to vanity, not willingly, but by the
[26:22] reason of him who hath subjected the
[26:23] same in hope. Because the creation, the
[26:26] creature itself also shall be delivered
[26:28] from the bondage of corruption into the
[26:30] glorious liberty of the children of God.
[26:35] Sons and daughters of God will step back
[26:37] in their rightful position again over
[26:39] all nature.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this in a
[26:42] number of places. I'll just take it from
[26:44] the unfailing realities of the living
[26:46] God. This is in paragraph 112. But man
[26:49] was put here with dominion over the
[26:50] earth. He had everything under his
[26:52] control. That's Adam in the beginning.
[26:55] He says what Adam lost, Jesus proved
[26:58] that he had restored.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; He stopped nature. He raised the dead.
[27:03] He did everything.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; He says it that what Adam lost in the
[27:07] fall, Jesus is proving that it's being
[27:10] restored back to mankind.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; In other words, this is a a man who's
[27:17] doing things that humanity was
[27:19] originally supposed to do. Yeah.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; So, by walking ON WATER, BY MULTIPLYING
[27:24] BREAD AND FISH, BY RAISING THE DEAD, BY
[27:27] UNSTOPPPING DEAF EARS, BY LOOSENING MUTE
[27:29] TONGUES, BY OPENING THE EYES OF THE
[27:31] BLIND, BY HEALING THE CRIPPLED, BY
[27:33] LAYING HANDS ON THE SICK AND THEIR
[27:34] RECOVERING, HE WAS SHOWING WHAT HUMANITY
[27:38] IS CALLED TO DO.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; Told you to be very, very
[27:44] straightforward.
[27:47] And we may set records tonight. I'm
[27:51] giving you a new challenge. I might I
[27:52] might give brother Ellie Ezer a new
[27:54] benchmark to beat
[27:57] until you guys start pulling on me and I
[27:58] get all long-winded again.
[28:01] I remember one of the first times I ever
[28:02] preached. The pastor said, it was
[28:04] brother John La Fontaine. He told this
[28:06] church, "Bring a pillow. Brother Aaron's
[28:08] longwinded." I said, "I've only preached
[28:09] one time."
[28:11] And so I just told the church, I said,
[28:13] "Well, the bishop must be blameless. So
[28:14] you better I guarantee you one thing.
[28:16] I'm going to be long tonight. Wouldn't
[28:18] want to make your pastor a liar.
[28:22] Matthew 28 18 to20. Notice what he says.
[28:27] Because Jesus proved it's not he's when
[28:31] he does these supernatural miracles,
[28:33] he's not proving that God can raise the
[28:35] dead. God had done that,
[28:37] &gt;&gt; right? He He's not proving that God's a
[28:40] creator or a multiplier.
[28:42] That doesn't necessarily need to be
[28:43] proved. But he's proving that what man
[28:46] lost he could be restored back too.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; In Matthew chap 28 18 to20 it says and
[28:52] Jesus came and spake unto them saying
[28:54] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[28:56] in earth.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; Go ye therefore and teach all nations.
[29:00] This is preach the gospel baptizing them
[29:02] in the name of the father and of the son
[29:04] and of the holy ghost. In the name of
[29:06] the father and of the son and of the
[29:07] holy ghost. When they obeyed this they
[29:09] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[29:11] teach them to observe all things
[29:13] whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I'm
[29:16] with you always even unto the end of the
[29:17] world. Amen.
[29:20] Jesus now is commissioning the disciples
[29:24] to observe to teach others to observe
[29:27] what he's commanded. So as the father
[29:30] hath sent the son he said so I send you
[29:33] [snorts]
[29:33] &gt;&gt; and as the father was in me I will be in
[29:36] you and you in me. So now there's this
[29:38] continuation of this ministry of Jesus
[29:41] Christ.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; And if we took the time just as we did
[29:44] with the works of Jesus Christ, we could
[29:46] look into the book of Acts and we see
[29:48] that the disciples performed the same
[29:50] miracles of Jesus Christ.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; The crippled were he were healed. The
[29:54] dead were raised. Demons were cast out.
[29:56] They defied nature.
[29:59] They performed many wonders. The Bible
[30:01] says
[30:03] there's many instances of the power of
[30:05] God working and moving in the disciples
[30:08] lives
[30:09] in the book of Acts doing these
[30:11] supernatural things. And in Acts 4:13 it
[30:15] says, "Now when they saw the boldness of
[30:16] Peter and John, the lame were healed and
[30:19] perceived that they were unlearned and
[30:20] ignorant men, they marveled and they
[30:22] took knowledge of them that they had
[30:23] been with Jesus."
[30:26] there's some symmetry to what they're
[30:27] saying and what they're doing and their
[30:29] boldness and the way that they're
[30:30] conducting themselves and they're
[30:32] they're not born of a virgin.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; But yeah, now the same works that Christ
[30:37] did, they're doing
[30:39] &gt;&gt; showing that WHAT CHRIST CAME TO do is
[30:42] to restore and uh to restore what
[30:45] mankind was rightful, a rightful heir to
[30:47] and to bring forth a new race, new
[30:48] creatures in Christ Jesus. It's not
[30:51] Adam's race passed up, but it's a new
[30:53] IT'S THAT THE SEED THAT WAS TO come
[30:56] &gt;&gt; and now they're doing these things that
[30:58] they had been with Jesus. It's because
[31:00] now they're doing these works that
[31:02] Christ did.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; In Acts 11 26, and when he had found
[31:06] him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it
[31:08] came to pass that a whole year they
[31:10] assembled themselves with the church and
[31:12] taught much people. Notice this, and the
[31:14] disciples were called Christians first
[31:16] in Antioch. They were called followers
[31:19] of Christ.
[31:21] As I often say, it doesn't imply that
[31:23] they gave themselves that name. They
[31:26] didn't register a don or they weren't
[31:28] the first to get the handle at
[31:29] Christians
[31:31] or Christians@gmail.com.
[31:34] They were called that by others
[31:36] &gt;&gt; because they were followers of Christ.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; They were following this great
[31:41] commission. All power is given to me in
[31:42] heaven and earth. So go and teach.
[31:46] And as they went out, they the the lame
[31:49] could walk again. The dead were raised.
[31:56] And it wasn't it was God in them. It was
[31:58] the Holy Spirit in them. It was the acts
[32:01] of the Holy Spirit in the apostles, but
[32:02] it was a portrait of humanity.
[32:06] In Galatians chapter 16 15, excuse me,
[32:09] Mark chapter 16, you're like, "Brother
[32:10] Aaron's writing a new Bible." Mark
[32:13] chapter 16 15 to 18.
[32:16] This is the the great commission now
[32:18] recorded in the book of Mark. And he
[32:19] said unto them, "Go ye into all the
[32:21] world and preach the gospel to every
[32:23] creature.
[32:25] He that believeth and is baptized shall
[32:27] be saved, but he that believeth not
[32:29] shall be damned." So here's the
[32:30] commission. Preach the gospel. Preach
[32:32] Jesus Christ. What is the gospel? It's
[32:33] Jesus Christ.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; What is the gospel? It's power.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; It's life.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; It's living.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Something that we're not ashamed of.
[32:42] Amen.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; And we're to preach the gospel to every
[32:45] creature.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; He that believes and is baptized is
[32:48] saved. He that believeth not. If even if
[32:50] he's baptized, it doesn't matter because
[32:52] faith is the ultimate.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Water baptism in the name of Jesus
[32:56] Christ is an outward sign that you have
[32:58] faith. In the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[32:59] is the seal of faith, not the baptism.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; It says in verse 17, "And these signs
[33:04] shall follow them that believe in my
[33:07] name. They shall cast out devils. They
[33:09] shall speak with new tongues." Jesus
[33:12] said, 'I come in my father's name and
[33:13] the works that he do has me to do, I do.
[33:17] I finished his work. I've manifested thy
[33:18] name. I've glorified his name. And now
[33:20] he's basically telling us to do the
[33:21] same. These signs shall follow them that
[33:24] believe in my name. Now again, as we are
[33:27] sent in his name, we cast out devils. We
[33:29] speak with new tongues. They shall take
[33:30] up serpents, and they shall they shall
[33:33] drink any deadly thing. If they drink
[33:35] any deadly thing, it shall not hurt
[33:37] them. They shall lay hands on the sick,
[33:38] and they shall recover. Yes,
[33:41] &gt;&gt; these are the works that Christ did.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; These are the very things that he did.
[33:46] These are the SIGNS OF THE GOSPEL and it
[33:48] IS IT'S GOD, BUT IT'S SIGNS OF GOD IN
[33:52] HUMANITY.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; It's a portrait. It's a painting. It's a
[33:56] picture. When I read that Christ did
[33:59] these things, I I don't want to say,
[34:00] "Oh, that's divine." I want to say
[34:03] that's what God looks like in flesh.
[34:07] This is what man with God all things is
[34:10] is possible. What all things are
[34:13] possible to them that believe.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; SO NOW IT'S GOD IN HUMANITY. It's a
[34:18] painting. It's a picture. When we think
[34:19] of the humanity of Jesus Christ, think
[34:21] of him walking on water.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; We think about the humanity of Jesus
[34:25] Christ. Thinking about him multiplying
[34:26] bread. Think about the humanity. Think
[34:28] about all these different things that he
[34:30] did. That's the humanity of God. Amen.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Now, we know God is not man that he
[34:36] should lie.
[34:38] Jesus Christ was the stature of a
[34:40] perfect man.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; So, he may not present in the way that
[34:44] we might expect a man to present, but
[34:46] yet as a man, he's doing these things.
[34:49] This is what man can do.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; So, we read on
[34:55] Sunday in Galatians chapter 1, I I'll
[34:57] use start with verse 15. It says, "But
[34:59] when it pleased God
[35:01] who separated me from my father's,
[35:04] excuse me, my mother's womb and called
[35:06] me by his grace." So this is according
[35:10] to the will of God, he's done this,
[35:12] pleased the father as it so it seemed
[35:15] good in thy sight. So this is the will
[35:16] of God to elect him, to ordain him. And
[35:19] he says, "From my birth, I had this
[35:21] calling in my life
[35:23] &gt;&gt; and it pleased God verse 16 to reveal
[35:26] his son in me.
[35:28] Christ was not revealed to Paul. He
[35:30] says, "Have I not seen Jesus Christ our
[35:32] Lord? He saw the light. He heard the
[35:34] voice." There's a lot of ways that there
[35:35] was this visible manifestation. But
[35:37] revelation doesn't come from without.
[35:39] The manifestation does. The revelation
[35:41] came from within. Christ was revealed in
[35:43] Paul.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't stop there. That
[35:47] &gt;&gt; he was revealed in me so that I for the
[35:50] purpose that I so because I was too that
[35:54] I might preach Christ among the heathen.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:59] So the revelation of Jesus Christ
[36:00] personally to him was not just to take
[36:03] him and set him on a shelf and say, "All
[36:04] right, let's go find the next one." But
[36:06] he was commissioned
[36:08] &gt;&gt; just as Jesus told the disciples, I and
[36:10] you and you and me and told them, "Go
[36:12] into all the world and preach the gospel
[36:14] and these signs will follow you. All
[36:16] power is given unto me. Now go teach all
[36:18] nations. Teach them to observe all these
[36:19] things that have commanded you." Paul is
[36:21] saying he revealed Christ in me that I
[36:24] might preach him among the Gentiles. So
[36:27] Christ was revealed in Paul for the
[36:30] purpose of manifesting himself. Christ
[36:34] through Paul.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS IN CHRIST reconciling the world
[36:38] to himself. Brother Brandham says all
[36:40] that God was he poured into Christ. All
[36:42] that Christ was he poured into the
[36:43] church. So there's still this ministry
[36:45] as Paul says he's committed to us this
[36:47] ministry of reconciliation. IT'S IN
[36:49] PAUL.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; HOW? BY THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST.
[36:53] SO NOW PAUL IS A MAN, but he HAS THIS
[36:56] DIVINE CALLING IN HIS LIFE TO REVEAL
[36:58] JESUS CHRIST.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; THAT I MIGHT PREACH HIM among the
[37:02] heathen
[37:03] &gt;&gt; to be the manifestation of the gospel.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Notice this. I think this is very good
[37:09] so that we could recognize this is how
[37:10] God works. God, he says God, it pleased
[37:13] God to reveal his son in me that I might
[37:15] preach him to the Gentiles. God chooses
[37:17] his servants
[37:19] &gt;&gt; that he will reveal himself in in order
[37:22] to preach himself to others
[37:25] &gt;&gt; should not stumble anybody if God chose
[37:28] a vessel in this day to reveal himself
[37:30] in that he might preach Jesus Christ to
[37:33] others. Amen.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; So God chose Paul to preach the revel
[37:38] revelation of Jesus Christ given to him
[37:40] revealed in me so that I could express
[37:42] him.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; And no matter how much Paul could be the
[37:46] manifestation of the gospel nor how much
[37:47] he could be a prophet or a messenger,
[37:49] it's not the external manifestation that
[37:51] saves anyone. It's not the external
[37:52] manifestation that gives a revelation.
[37:54] The spirit's got to do it inwardly.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; That's what Sunday really focused a lot
[37:58] on the portrait of a perfect man is
[38:00] revelation comes from within.
[38:02] spirit has to reveal what you're seeing
[38:04] when you see the portrait.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; So, this is why I was all excited to to
[38:09] share with you that.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Musicians, you could come to your
[38:14] instruments,
[38:16] but I want to end it with this a few
[38:19] statements here
[38:21] as I just collect myself. Please come. I
[38:24] know I I joke so often that nobody
[38:26] nobody knows whether or not I'm being
[38:28] serious when I say please be seated or
[38:30] stand up or if the musicians would come.
[38:33] But if that's true for Paul, it's also
[38:35] true for you.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Go ye into all the world and preach the
[38:39] gospel.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; The great commission has not been taken
[38:42] away from the church.
[38:44] And the new birth is the revelation of
[38:46] Jesus Christ personally to you, but it
[38:48] is Christ revealed in you.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:51] And so Christ reveals himself in us
[38:55] so we can be the depiction of him
[38:58] &gt;&gt; to others.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; That's why he does it.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; That's why when we're born again, we
[39:04] don't just we're gone.
[39:06] Wouldn't that be awesome? You know, I'd
[39:08] have left here at 21, right? Boom. Gone.
[39:11] And then maybe there's some kind of
[39:13] vapor that still exists so that people
[39:16] know, oh well, Aaron wasn't kidnapped.
[39:18] He got saved and so he's in heaven now.
[39:22] But he leaves us here because we have a
[39:24] work to do.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; The message teaches us that all that
[39:27] Jesus did in the days of his earthly
[39:29] ministry that he did not fulfill will be
[39:31] completed will be fulfilled by the
[39:33] bride. Amen.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; So just as Christ was God in flesh and
[39:39] the word was made flesh, now flesh is
[39:41] being made word for the same purpose of
[39:44] fulfilling the great commission.
[39:47] Performing and doing this great work of
[39:50] Jesus Christ. As Adam was put on earth
[39:52] to to do a great work. Now the bride
[39:55] will fulfill all. And brother Bam even
[39:58] teaches that Christ and the bride will
[40:00] fulfill all that Adam and the woman
[40:02] didn't fulfill.
[40:04] He reveals himself in us so that we can
[40:06] be him to others.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; So what I'd like you to consider for a
[40:13] little bit, chew on the gospel of
[40:16] Christ, those four gospels as we read
[40:18] them, they describe the image of God
[40:20] because it tells us the story of Jesus
[40:22] [music] Christ.
[40:24] Then as God revealed himself in Paul and
[40:27] Paul essentially writes the New
[40:28] Testament, I think these other writers,
[40:30] we also see it in [music] in in Peter's
[40:34] writings in John. So it's not just
[40:35] limited to Paul itself, but the New
[40:37] Testament paints continues to paint the
[40:39] picture of Christ in his church.
[40:43] So as believers, we search the
[40:45] scriptures.
[40:47] We're searching the picture that the
[40:49] painters had painted. This Bible, this
[40:52] word is Jesus Christ. We should see
[40:53] Jesus Christ in every verse.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; So, we search the the picture as painted
[40:58] by the writers of the Bible.
[41:02] You are not, as I've said many times
[41:04] before in the last few weeks, you are
[41:06] not the painter of the portrait.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; We're not the writer of the scripture.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; And we're not to be critics of it
[41:14] either.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that are critics
[41:17] of it, but we're not called to be
[41:19] critics.
[41:21] But what we do is we read the portrait.
[41:24] We read the scripture so that the spirit
[41:26] will reveal the reality and the truth of
[41:28] it to us.
[41:31] And so what I've tried to do tonight is
[41:33] to take all these miraculous things that
[41:35] Jesus Christ did.
[41:38] And I'm I believe that could show by
[41:40] scripture that at least in some way
[41:43] that's how the human the man was
[41:45] originally called to be
[41:49] is a God on earth with all these
[41:50] different powers and all these different
[41:51] abilities. Man lost that through the
[41:53] fall. Humanity did. But now [music]
[41:55] Christ comes born of a woman in flesh
[41:58] found in the likeness of man in the
[41:59] fashion of man. And he starts doing all
[42:01] these things that Adam was called to do.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; So it was a portrait of humanity.
[42:08] all these miracles, all these
[42:10] supernatural instances. Yes, it's it's
[42:12] God telling Jesus to DO IT. IT'S GOD IN
[42:15] CHRIST. YES, I I'M not disavowing the
[42:18] deity, but these are portraits of
[42:21] humanity. And if that's the portrait of
[42:23] humanity, I really want you to think
[42:25] then
[42:27] what's the portrait of divinity?
[42:30] What are the acts, the attributes, and
[42:32] the qualities, and the characteristics
[42:33] in Christ that are really, really
[42:36] divine?
[42:39] God walking on water. GOD RAISING THE
[42:41] DEAD. GOD MULTIPLYING out the BREAD AND
[42:43] FISH. GOD DOING THIS. GOD DOING THAT.
[42:47] But that's humanity.
[42:50] What's really divine?
[42:53] What is it that really really speaks to
[42:56] these attributes and characteristics of
[42:58] God
[43:00] that please God so much that Christ
[43:04] exhibited that we are also called to?
[43:06] Amen.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; I know I know you're thinking we have a
[43:10] lot of time to get into it, so why don't
[43:12] we just get into it? But I want you to
[43:13] think about it.
[43:15] What is the portrait of divinity? What
[43:17] characteristics in the Messiah are the
[43:20] portrait [music] of divinity that he
[43:21] wants you to now express?
[43:24] &gt;&gt; I want to WALK ON WATER. WELL, THAT'S
[43:26] JUST HUMAN.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO MULTIPLY FISH. WELL, THAT'S
[43:29] JUST HUMAN. NOW, I'm not talking about
[43:32] man born of a woman, but the born again
[43:34] part.
[43:36] the new creature in Christ Jesus. Those
[43:38] are things that's that's God. That's
[43:40] what God can do in flesh. But what more
[43:42] has he called us to? What expresses the
[43:44] divine?
[43:46] Something to think about. Trust that
[43:48] you'll do it. Maybe God will give us the
[43:49] grace next Wednesday to pick this
[43:50] subject up. If we could stand together
[43:53] this evening,
[44:00] please don't take what I've said to mean
[44:03] that these [music] these attributes and
[44:05] characteristics aren't of God
[44:07] or not godly, but it's God in humanity.
[44:11] But these are things that were
[44:12] associated with
[44:15] mankind in the beginning. Now we realize
[44:18] that in the beginning Adam couldn't have
[44:19] healed the sick because there was no
[44:21] sickness. So God allows these things to
[44:24] transpire, these things to take place
[44:25] [music] so that his attributes and his
[44:27] characteristics can be expressed.
[44:30] And so just if I could even put it that
[44:32] way, put it this way. Okay, the miracles
[44:36] are the portrait of the divine, but
[44:38] that's only half the picture.
[44:41] There's another part that we play. And
[44:44] in all the things that we want to do, I
[44:46] want to do the miracles. I want to do
[44:47] the miracles. I want to do the miracles.
[44:48] I want to do the divine.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do. Let's pray.
[44:52] Our gracious heavenly father,
[44:55] tonight as we are in your presence and
[44:58] through this short service, I know I
[45:00] covered a lot, maybe went pretty quick,
[45:02] but
[45:06] I it's not it's not really being clever,
[45:09] Lord, but I did want to phrase it in
[45:10] such a way to where we take the miracles
[45:13] that you did through your son and we put
[45:15] them in the category of this is what
[45:16] flesh can do
[45:19] when the Holy Spirit is inside of them.
[45:23] that this is what you had called Adam to
[45:25] do with respect to nature and creation
[45:27] and that you'd called him to [music] be
[45:30] that originally in the beginning.
[45:33] So then Jesus Christ, as we're taught
[45:35] according to the message of the hour,
[45:36] was proving that what man lost, what
[45:38] humanity lost in the fall was being
[45:40] restored by Jesus Christ. So humanity
[45:43] restored through your blood [music]
[45:45] being restored through the new birth.
[45:49] It does those things.
[45:52] God working the acts of the Holy Spirit
[45:57] portraying
[45:59] these very very supernatural things. And
[46:03] I believe that sons and daughters of God
[46:05] today can lay hands on the sick and they
[46:08] recover.
[46:09] I believe Lord if it was required they
[46:11] could walk on water
[46:14] because Lord what other evidence do we
[46:16] need that it was humanity than when
[46:18] Peter himself did it without the Holy
[46:20] Ghost
[46:21] stepped out by faith and walked on water
[46:26] because there's things that are in
[46:27] [music] us that we're called to do that
[46:30] faith unlocks.
[46:33] It's who we are. It's what we're called
[46:34] to.
[46:37] And Lord, I wrestled very quite a bit in
[46:40] terms of how to categorize it and order
[46:42] it, what's divine and what's human.
[46:49] And Lord, I just felt to to put these
[46:51] things in the category of humanity
[46:53] because I can tie it back to Adam.
[46:57] But I want to know this divine portrait,
[46:59] too.
[47:01] You humbled yourself. You became
[47:04] obedient. [music]
[47:06] You can say, "Those are things man does,
[47:08] but it's exactly what deity did."
[47:12] Lord, there's a portrait of divinity
[47:13] that I desire in my life, too.
[47:16] Yes, I I want the Holy Spirit to do
[47:18] these these things we've talked about
[47:20] tonight, but Lord, the other part, the
[47:21] full picture, the fullness, the full
[47:23] stature of a perfect man. Lord, what are
[47:26] those attributes that need to be kindled
[47:28] in me and made real in me? Bless your
[47:30] people tonight. We do have heavy hearts
[47:32] amongst us. We have a lot of anxious
[47:35] spirits. But Lord, I believe that you
[47:37] can just calm us now just as you do the
[47:39] storm. Lord, calm our spirits.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Those of us that are hungry, feed us,
[47:44] Lord.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Let our hearts not be troubled. We
[47:47] believe in you.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; You do all things well. All things are
[47:52] working together for good.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, we even believe that the lost will
[47:57] be saved. That those who have wandered
[47:59] far can be found.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; We will not fret. We will not despair
[48:04] even in the midst of a stormy gale.
[48:08] Anchor the anchor holds Lord.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; That's what I can do as a human filled
[48:15] with the Holy Spirit.
[48:17] I can walk on water.
[48:20] I can trust in the midst of a storm.
[48:25] Lord, bless your people tonight and
[48:27] commit them to you. And I pray that you
[48:28] just take control of even the worship,
[48:30] Father, as we're soon dismissed. go with
[48:32] us. I pray in the name of Lord Jesus
[48:33] Christ. Amen.
