TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as I was reading this book I was going through these verses these specific words about these men it's speaking about when God's people several of them were allowed Babylonia to leave the bondage of Babylon Israel to go back to Israel to build God's Temple and it says that the man by the name of Ezra 's bus in his heart this man Ezra to search for the Levites so they can go back and minister in God's Temple but it wasn't enough with them them just saying or saying hey I'm part of the levite they actually have to prove it so it says here in the Bible that they sought the record of their genealogy and since they couldn't find it foreign it's not enough in the records that will be put out of it for some reason God allowed for every story in the Bible to be recorded out of everything that we're reading as we go along that's how I am I'm taking every little piece so I can start watching my own life and so this made me start thinking a lot Lord am I part of this group is my name recorded down because it just won't be enough by me giving my own word your word is not enough many as it says many will say Lord but that's not enough we belong to this church we belong to the other one hombre you and I our name has to First be recorded down since before the foundation of the world but this takes me to remember when I was a little boy foreign I remember when I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ is a Miss Padres my parents accepted the message when I was around 9 10 years of age but I got baptized when I was around 15 16 years of age and we know that many times you don't understand or rather we we have to understand to be able to know that we belongs to God's people that we're not going to be rejected sometimes we have to first understand where are we standing and what path are we in our Christian Life the three stages of Grace [Music] because sometimes we do forget many of us have already been born again and many times those three stages of Grace we forget that there's other people that are barely going through those three stages and I remember that when I got baptized I just felt something in my heart that's so what likely what happens that every two times two or three times a year we had a minister that would come visit us uh perfectly listened and paid attention to all the three stages of Grace so because of that I didn't know what to do with that which was inside me now that I look back with a more time of experience I would have liked if someone would have would have come to me yo and for them to explain and then for me to tell him what I was feeling as well and for that this person would tell me you're just in justification you not have to go on to sanctification and then from then you go to the new birth but sometimes Brothers we make a mistake as mature Christians that we are that we forget that sometimes our own children are going through those same stages and they need guides to understand what they're going through now if we go to the Bible there's no uh specific spot where it says you have to have this amount of time in this certain stage that's something that I didn't know but the Devil he's the devil in the village and in the city and when you're unaware and many times you as a mature Christian that you are okay you see those things like oh that's so obvious for the person that's passing but it's not so obvious for the other person that's just barely walking by if you were born in the message or out of the message that you and I this is the Bible says in Genesis 1 to 4 it says and says and the Earth was out of order and it says that the darkness was on the face of the deep I can compare that to my own self and that's what I had to understand foreign and we're in darkness we start with justification that's where it begins what's next then and then if we continue the awesome piece now God what is it that he starts doing the first thing he made the light what do every one of us needs the Revelation the light of those little things okay but my issue is that sometimes I forget that those are Mysteries people are going through that is and that's something that I was thinking a while ago I was asking God for forgiveness actually I said Lord forgive me I think I've been a bit uh inconsiderate knowing what I went through I had no one to Lead Me I sometimes I I regard this as something that everybody knows that already and then the Devil comes and begins to toy with that person just like he tore it with me as long as you and I Repent or the person that just barely repented as long as they don't accept that he's without order I mean it is I remember that a few years ago I was at home and I invited some brothers to come over and these brothers and I we were having a little talks and I don't know what happened at church because I invited them to come over after church but it was something in regards to the family of the pastor and these brothers were not long in the message and so one of them replies and says he says yeah the pastor says that because it's easier for his own children they didn't have to go to the things of the world that we had to go through it's easier for them because they don't go through the Temptations that we had to go through pastor and in some aspect I did feel that I was on the side of the pastor's kids I'm not a pastor's son but I was raised as a Christian from a very young age and I said hold up Jose I said why is it easier for the children of the pasture was because they weren't in the world they don't have the bad experiences like we had um let me tell you from my own perspective and experience it's just as hard as for you that was in the world or easy however you want to put it it's still the same decision that everyone has to take even seen from the Outlook that you have is sometimes it's even harder for the one that was raised as a Christian he said why he says because look uh you can think I don't know if this is something that has happened to everyone but sometimes the Devil comes and you come to think well I have actually nothing to repent of I never went to dances I haven't smoked I haven't stolen anything I haven't done this this or this then what is it that I have to repent of that your life is without order as long as the holy spirit is not in it we're going from stage to Stage some some people can last in justification for some time other people can last in sanctification for some time there's other people like in the book of Acts they receive the Holy Ghost without even being baptized first it all depends of the Cry of the person that they have in their heart that's the difference sometimes we forget to approach them that were just newly baptized and what is it that you feel do you know do you know what you got what stage are you in yeah of transformation now the dictionary says Transformer to transform when espanol in Spanish it says it like this they say it says to shape the form or shape of someone or something important it doesn't matter if you grew up in church or in el mundo or in the world both have to be transformed many times many of us have arrays in the message we have to be changed to have love towards the people and then there to understand that this is not a social club that we are a part they're like of God's people because that transformation has to happen in every one of us maybe those that are coming from the world to leave everything behind that is of the world we that are in church to stop seeing the things in the church the way we see them now start being true Christians una transformation it's a transformation meet it and the devil we ourselves we have to be careful many times we worry and that's fine in regards to knowing god how many times do we dedicate ourselves to get to know the devil it's importante that's something that is important because that's the one you're going to be facing you have to get to know your adversary everyone that is going to be in that face off for those that like sports or for those of us that like sports we know that the trainers are the coaches they study their opponent they study their weaknesses where and how they can they can attack them they don't just come to the game and say I'm just here to play let's see how this works out sometimes as Christians that's exactly what we do okay sometimes we want to face off the devil without getting to know him first without knowing what is his behavior like yeah this is in the sardisian church age he says now the church died during the the Dark Ages and became completely Pagan here then the restoration that's a Reformation Reformation but to be reformed in acido De Nuevo and being born again are two different things to be reformed inaccido de Nuevo and to be born again are different things and that's sometimes the exactly this the spot where we make the mistake of not knowing in what stage of Grace are we are as Christians because that's where the devil got us many of us we reach sanctification we left all the filthy habits behind yeah we behave as true Christians now I'm now reformed and sometimes we stop there and we stayed there a long time I say that by personal experience yo okay I remember that I went through the stage of sanctification I I wanted nothing to do with the world he's not going to come to present you the same vices that you once had you see what he's going to do he's going to start working on us but in a different angle what way did he work with me I started judging everyone else foreign but all um but I did that just to judge everyone else I said this guy's smoking how could he be in sanctification you know what I don't think he's even reached justifications he's a hot head Ed the message says this this and this and a doctor of the message but to judge the rest of the people and you think you're actually worthy of everything because I've been changed I'm not who I once was and I've actually asked myself a question the the colors I remember that colored woman that brother random says and I remember one time and this is the way that God woke me up and then they didn't get it to understand what stage I was going through he says that this woman said I'm maybe not what I ought to be but I think God I'm not what I used to be but your military and me meditating on this is I asked myself this question is a time comes when this question is it comes to you in your Christian Life thankfully we are not what we once were Lord why is it that I'm not what I should be I'm not what I once was neither am I what I should be at this point in my life in the message in my Christian Life I've simply not being what we used to be I encountered this in my own life I'm married now yes I'm like 27 20 years of age and I'm not what I should be I I did understand that I'm not what I used to be but neither was I at the point in my life where I should be because the devil was playing with me because he played with me pensando thinking that to be reformed because of that I've had already received the Holy Ghost he made me become a religious person but it wasn't with the intention of helping the rest of the people it wasn't with the intention of helping the church but just to keep myself occupied [Music] I previously heard this and I didn't understand it he's not concerned when a person accepts the Lord Jesus Christ and that's something I couldn't wrap my hand around El Diablo the devil is not worried about when a person gets baptized does not get worried if you and I reach sanctification and many times you know what is what's the sad part is that sometimes he's not even concerned if you and I are born again because even brother Branham says there's people that have the Holy Ghost and they don't know what it's for they don't even know what that is able to produce then why should he be concerned it's like for example if someone gives me a tool that I don't know how to use it doesn't matter how efficient that tool is if you and I don't know how to handle it then it won't work this is now brother Branham says in in the message adoption this is why I'm saying that the devil sometimes he's not even worried didn't get that bad what stage estamos we are in they say he says he says but the teaching positionally places the mammal in locales and what he is inosotros and he says and we Nosotros are never never able correctament to correctly have faith until we know positionally who we are when I read this I was able to understand what I couldn't understand before sometimes it's not something that's concerning for the devil that a person gets baptized persona yeah that a person is able to reach uh justifications what worries him is and then we find Our Place brother guess up sepamos that we recognize Where We Belong because when you and I and then demos are able to understand who we are that's when that Machinery that tool begins to function yes and that's when the devil knows that we're going to be a hassle for him because he's no longer able to scare us now we're going to be helpful for the pasture no no one time I heard this and I said well you know that's true and the Sheep who do you think is the one that produces the Sheep the pastor or the Sheep is but many times we want the pasture to be both Shepherd and sheep at the same time the pastor can't produce something that he's not he's there to take care of the of the flock that very flock is producing more sheep amen amen but for those sheeps to be able to produce those sheep we have to know first the things of the message how to even take care of our own selves because the pasture the time will come he won't be always there with the flock but those sheep they learn themselves how to take care of themselves and to produce more sheep what is it that we need them to understand our place where every one of us is positioned he and many times understanding is I was talking I want this element of running and even brother random says nothing that is happening right now is something new all the anointings that are now we can find them actually in the Bible and as time goes on there's more anointings and more spirits and more that is moving among the Believers and praise God I remember I think it was around 10 years ago there was a great split between the message Believers that's what at least happening in Latin America with the ones that believed and with those that didn't believe uh brother Banner's return Ministry there was a huge split because of that when supposedly Doctrine doesn't separate that's already in the Bible didn't Paul when he was uh imprinted when he was before those that some believed and some didn't believe in the resurrection of the Dead and he had them to fight over that he said it's the same anointing started that we should be watching out for parakeet for what reason to fight to pick a side no it's not for that Paul said that's not our custom to be bickering we should be concerned actually what God's word says now there apparently there's another split that's coming around those that believe okay they should only play tapes and then the other ones I believe that this should be live preachers the devil's clever and Diablo but the devil that don't the the people rather that don't know the devil or they don't read the Bible they don't read the message he's able to come and just toy with those people I don't think any of us want the devil to come to us and start toying with us but we thank God for all of that is because that's what makes us become or actually to make the True Believer stand out where are we standing what is it that you're believing immediate yes and that makes me Ponder sabemos and we know there are lives as Christians against flesh and blood our struggle is the spiritual world and that then takes me to another question the Bible says in the book of Ezra Uno Cinco 1 5. in Israel 1 5 says then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites with all them who spared God raised to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem this is also actually it caught really my attention they say it says it says that it was a spirit race all of them build the house of the Lord it was the spirit moves them it moved them before so what is the spirit that is moving me today what is the spirit that's anointing me that's something I just uh you personally know and I personally because we know our own lives because by our fruits by our works at the audio on a daily basis we know what spirit is anointing us what is the spirit that's inside us Brothers there's a spirit that comes here but Inspirations despair comes to inspire this person and when I was reading this right away I started thinking about my own life in the in the past few months and I started to examine everything that I've done how I act at my job did you know that Paul himself he exhorts us to be good laborers and I'll be whining while we're at work all of that sometimes we need to turn around and see the footprints that we're leaving behind that we're starting to understand how upright or crooked we're walking that's the only way as you look at the footsteps that we're leaving behind all right or maybe those of us that are married if we ask our spouses what is the spirit that leads us or ask our children or if we would ask the parents about the children in regards to that subject a long time ago I found that I was really lacking that I would easily get really desperate and upset it's not wrong if you get angry what's wrong is when the rage overtakes you when you don't know how to handle that so what what to do then because we know that uh anger is the beginning of insanity and how many times how many uh insane bizarre things have we not done in Ohio while we're angry I remember that my mother used to tell me she said when you have your kids if you're going to rebuke them you hit them before you get angry because if you do it while you're angry there's a high percentage that you'll you'll hurt them too much and I didn't understand that and so it finally happened to me and I had to understand and ask God that that spirit and that specific circumstance was dominated I was asking for wisdom as a father for him to give me because that actually is a bad testimony how can I tell my son that God is love if every time that he gets me angry I give him a good one what is the spirit that is anointing me there was one thing that I really liked and I'll speak a little bit bad about my own country in Mexico I like that in Mexico the streets aren't like how they are here nicely even there's a lot of potholes over there and as you're driving it's good that you're looking out for the Mysteries but let's not forget the Minor Details that are down here below because now we're going to hit a pothole right now brother random says he says a lot of people have been deceived to believe that they have received the Holy Ghost as I said before today they have so many doctrines for example Elijah's Mantle and so many other things Los Hijos the children many manifestos de dios Gods manifested children in all these different isms that are in the world and the people just blindly go on and they just simply received some mere kind of Sensations and then they rise up with an arrogant spirit indifferente in different exegente fasi ipel I remember one time that I was in church and the church was packed out and I remember that the Deacon asked me can you scoot over just a little bit and I scooted over and then he sat some people there and then he asked me again can you scoot over a little bit more but I was getting a bit ticked off and then he came for a third time he says can you scoot over by then I've been I had an urge to just get up and give them about two three quotes of brother random as well and I thought that then I had the Holy Ghost sometimes the devil he tricks us that's why as Christians that's why brother exhorts us so much every day so watch what we're doing every day as Paul says to be dying right as the Lord also it's something that's painful but we have to get there and I always carry that question with me possibly I'm not what I used to be okay but I have to reach the point where I have to be no matter I can't settle with uh just leaving behind what I used to be I mean I would like to close with just a few stories we have a zealous God and even brother Adam says he says he says Satan is such a clever enemy is he says he's so clever this is he says he's so clever that's the word he'll come in just as quickly and so easily seven did you know it looks so innocent at first and that's the problem that we think the uh the devil's so obvious with what he's going to do but we know Diablo that the devil is just as religious as you and I see it's true and so bold as well he was so bold that he went to go tempt Jesus what can we expect for us then you don't think he'll dare to come to us he dared to go temp Jesus he dared to attempt every one of the prophets he goes face to face with God so don't think that we're better than the devil please says when you and I we belittle the devil is that's when we're we're the most in danger ous that's when we're the most in danger and I really like this story the brother random tells us about this little boy yes and that's the kind of life that you should that you should carry of the little boy that was uh Crossing through with a bicycle he they say in Vancouver Colombia he says in Vancouver British Columbia um they were giving out a prize to the little boy that could uh drive with a little bicycle 12 inches wide by 100 yards it was just about this wide it was like merely almost like 100 yards is like a football stadium right he can only be about within this range as he was going with the bicycle I'm sure you've already heard this story sweet he says they were giving away a swim bicycle buenos and the rest of the boys thought they were good at steering and that's what the devil does with us sometimes I think many of us we feel that we're good Christians evil Central he was going he was going uh to the downtown of the city to go get some uh errands or groceries for his mother he had a basket with the with the groceries in one hand and he would have put it under his arm and he would even uh grab the steering wheel or the handlebarso so everyone knew that he was the one that was going to win that uh competition and before that competition just like the rest of the other children everyone thought that they would win that contest cristianos just like the same with the Christians we all think that we're going to be part of the rapture but then the trial comes and then that's when you really see who's gonna make it because we go back the scripture that we read at the beginning if your name is not in the register it doesn't matter how much we think and we said we're going to win that contest foreign he was able to reach actually all the way to the end he never started stumbling so then all the boys got around him and said and he said he says boys this is what happened I watch what every one of you were doing and I saw all of your mistakes see all of you were looking down like this trying to keep yourself on the plank I just looked at the at the finish line and I was able to remain centered in a 12-inch plank what is it that God told Joshua not to the left North to the right straight through the middle that's what this little boy did many many uh were veering to the left others were veering to the right but he kept himself in the center what is it that God has commanded us the same that God told Joshua don't turn to the right North to the left but right through the middle and that's how this boy was able to reach it to the Finish Line keeping himself centered that's the only way we're going to make it good Ness being centered not to one side neither to the other side and now the other story is of the Prophet Andreas Primera de Reyes and First Kings it says that the Lord commanded him to go bring a message and don't come back from where you came from but then it says that a prophet came a major prophet and said God spoke to me for you to come but God had already given the message to this prophet he said don't stop don't come back from the same way you came from and to this young prophet it cost them his life to disobey what God told him neither to one side no to the other side because we'll fall off it's the same thing that will happen to this Prophet here we know the message was given to us we know what you and I have to do to disobey this message not literally but spiritually but for that necesitamos we need is to be positioned in the body of Christ is a is to cross that bridge or I really don't know how to word it is a narrow one like the story of the the little kid with the bicycle contest we've been giving a message it doesn't matter how much we hear it but if it's not according to God's message in God's word it might cost us our life we have to know who is our enemy how does he act and where we're standing alas if you can please stand Thomas
