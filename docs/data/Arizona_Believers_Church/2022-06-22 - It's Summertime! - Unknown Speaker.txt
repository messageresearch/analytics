TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but my title tonight is it's summertime it's summertime and i want to i just have something burdened on my heart it was interesting how god's dealt with me i had been pondering maybe starting a new segment on divine healing i'd been studying on our family tree studying on the seven bad habits and there's just a lot of things to minister on a lot of things to bring into our view but god just dealt with my heart in a little bit different way this week to where i was feeling that something else was in store and this was just the subject that he put on my heart it's going to be very very unique and so i trust that i say that and afterwards yeah that was just about as vanilla as it could be but for me it seems to be unique and so it's it's it's summertime and so let's just join in on this particular subject matter and i know that you probably want me to give you a little bit of a preview of what it means but i don't know what else to say other than it's summertime and i want to talk about it's summertime some of you may know that yesterday was the first day of summer i know that doesn't make sense to a lot of us who've already been in 112 degrees weather uh earlier this year but we it was the first day of summer officially at 5 14 a.m on june 21st that was the june solstice and that's when the sun reaches its highest northernmost point in the sky so called the summer solstice or june solstice and it marks the official beginning of summer it's called summer solstice because at this particular moment when the sun gets to that highest point in the northernmost point in the sky for us in the northern hemisphere the people in south africa right now saying blasphemy this is not true but uh it reaches its northernmost point in the sky it almost seems as if it stops so summer solstice it means to to to stand still is even the language that's used and maybe even seems to kind of for a moment just its momentum stops and it holds there and because of that it's the longest period of sunlight on that particular day june 21st at 5 14 is the summer solstice it's the longest period of sunlight and it's the shortest night so if you wanted to celebrate it too late it's already happened it took place yesterday but it's the longest day they say and it's also the shortest night and i wouldn't mind if you did uh let your minds wonder just a tiny little bit not so much that it leaves the room but consider what summertime means to you i know that i look back and i think about summertime and it always had it was kind of romantic in your mind as a kid because you're in school and you look forward to that time and when you have a half day of class and summer starts it has a completely different feeling than any other day before even though it's the same weather the day before the week once you enter the summer it just has very different feelings and i know it have means a lot of different things to different people it depends upon your age because at certain ages summer means nothing it's no different than the spring or the fall it's different in different cultures even based upon your location summer means one thing for some people it means another for others and even occupations think about the different brothers in the church based upon their occupation they have busy seasons they have slow seasons brother albert once it starts getting this hot his days get earlier but in some ways they get shorter because he's got to start working when it's only 102 outside instead of 110 and so sometimes the summer is a time when people slow down and but for others it may be the time when they really got to make hay and make their money now this is one way this might just be a really cheap way of trying to get you all on the same page or get a real low hanging amen but in the old english summer meant the hot season of the year and we sometimes feel like in phoenix we have two seasons hot and hotter but summer is the hot season of the year the warmer half of the year is how it's defined so kind of thinking of that there's a cold half or a less warm half and a warmer half is how it's actually divided we know what the four seasons are we won't get into all of them but we're looking at this one summer it says in psalm 74 17 speaking of god thou has set all the borders of the earth we use this in this series on borders barriers and boundaries thou has said all the boundaries the borders of the earth and it says of god thou hast made summer and winter so summer and winter god's divisions we could say that wow when the earth tilted on its axis and the way it was in the beginning we could maybe say well they would have been different and these are different times and seasons but god brought these divisions so it's part of his wisdom to have a winter to have a to have a spring to have a summer to have a fall as part of god's plan it's part of god's wisdom to manifest himself the very beginning in genesis chapter 1 verses 14 and 15 he says and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven too so he's going to put lights there but what is it there for to divide the day from the night and to let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years that's what the the moon is for that's what the sun is for that's what the stars are for is to divide day from night and for signs and for seasons days and years and the word their season means appointed time it's actually the same word that's used in tent of meetings so it's a fixed place for a specific purpose and a specific reason it's a fixed time that's what seasons are in psalms 104 verse 19 it says he appointed the moon for seasons the sun knoweth his going down so he's appointed the moon here the word is speaking of the lunar cycle it's the means of measuring months it's a lunar calendar that the hebrews used we'll go into that here in a little bit but he says he appointed the moon for seasons that based upon the cycle of the moon and from the full moon to waxing and waning and all the different words they use in the country for moons if you read your almanac it's to tell us what time it is and what season it is and it's appointed the moon for seasons it's all a part of god's expressing himself and his character in the message the super sign he says i want you to notice the unchanging continuity of god's word and his works see he never changes his program he never changes his ways just as perfectly the scripture is in perfect continuity everything that god does is in continuity with what he's done and what he did first he'll do it the second time the same way so he's talking about god's unchanging nature his infallibility the way he does thing at one time he can do he does it that way again and he says just to prove it to you he's made laws in the earth so the laws of nature what they call mother nature is the nature of god what they call about the law of gravity and all these things these are laws of god that he's built into his creation for purpose and it's part of his unchanging ways he says to prove it to you he's made laws in the earth and so he starts to amplify these laws of nature and he has always given his people a sign before the event happens now he's always done it and he will always do it because he is the unchangeable god i am god he said i changed not the way he sets his program at the beginning that's the way it is in each age he never changes it now notice the example he gives here when he put the world to turn on a 24-hour basis we might have daylight savings times and all kinds of times but it never changes the turning of the world so man could try to divide the days divide the years say well there's so many days in a year and there's so many days in a month and and there's a different ways of trying to calculate and give measurements i think one of the the um funnest ones is when a woman says that she's pregnant for 40 weeks therefore pregnancy is actually 10 months not nine have you ever heard that argument before you'll find that some people it's almost as if they have an epiphany that wait a minute it's full term is 40 weeks there's four weeks in a month i'm actually pregnant for 10 months it's like no no matter how you slice it or dice it there's more than four weeks in a month except for the month of february so it doesn't quite work out that way it still works out to nine months i hope nobody was subscribing to the 10 month cycle but it's no matter how you define it or how you slice it god has a way of he put it in place the 24-hour day or that cycle of day and night is the institute in genesis 1. so he says that she makes her complete cycle every 24 hours turns around never changes the seasons god has spring summer winter just exactly like it always was man can't change that though he's trying really really hard god has seasons and it's just it's built into the way that the sun uh turns uh uh turns a full cycle it's built in the way that it rotates around the sun and it's uh orbiting the sun there's all these different ways that god in his wisdom has built this so that's the way he done it first that's the way he does it every time the continuity of his laws and of his word and of his works how it just all perfectly blends together therefore if we could look at what was we can know what is and what will be you can base your thoughts upon that for the scripture says he's the same yesterday today and forever just so many good teaching points in this he says we notice before springtime comes watch some of his laws when you see the trees putting forth buds you know that summer is nigh so jesus refers to here when the fig tree puts forth this bud then you know these things are nice we read it here that when they now shoot forth you see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand when this blooming is taking place you know that summer is coming and he's using this scripture to talk about the laws of god the continuity of god in that is expressed in nature he says springtime is a sign of the introduction of summer coming on he's placing it in here to recognize that spring has a specific purpose and time and then in that it's signaling what is next it's telling you what's next if you know what season you're in and what the signs are then it's signifying not only is it springtime but it's also signifying that another season is coming so it's the introduction of summer coming on he says that's a law it always happens that way you don't have summer then about the time it gets winter then the leaves come on no you have the leaves first because it's an introduction of his laws of nature that springtime is coming it never fails when you see the trees begin to get tender around on the bark and little buds begin to swell you know that it's a sign that springtime is here it's coming in and it continues for the next several paragraphs to amplify different attributes of springtime even begins to use the example of migration that whenever that summertime comes on then the the the those birds that have migrated to the south during the winter know it's time to head north and begin to migrate north in different places he uses examples in florida and other areas where that time comes and it's a signal in nature for migration for change for something to come forth and then in paragraph 37 as i read this it says then the spring when it's nice and warm down here through the winter he'll go right straight back again talking about those ducks and those geese he says why it's nature displaying itself it's the laws of god so it is nature mother nature being expressed and things being made known but it's actually laws of god that are on display something about the nature of god and the character of god and ecclesiastes chapter 3 verses 1 to 2 it says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted when i read that it's kind of like the the hidden season is if you plant it and then you pluck it there's a season in which it grows but it's saying that there's a time to everything there is a season we know there's many other things he talks about here time to so it says a time to die time to be born a time to die a time to cry time to rejoice but there's a season for everything and there's a purpose a time to every purpose under the heaven and i believe that there is a season and a purpose as it even relates to the seasons as he says here a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted there is a purpose to these things and this is uh it's a subject you could just kind of get into and you begin to talk about in a very logical scientific way and i think you could make a lot of applicable points and a lot of things that we could refresh to our minds and fellowship around but if you don't know which season has come you don't know what season you're in then you're not going to make it take advantage of the season one thing that's remarkable to me is there's all sorts of times you think all springtime that's the time to plant but you know there's some plants you don't plant in the springtime and there's some things that you would never oh you can't do this then and you can't do that then you got to wait for this you got to wait for that and so you got to know what you're planting and you need to know the season in which it needs to be planted and if you don't know the season you're in you won't take advantage of that season and the worst part is each season leads into the next so if you don't take advantage of a planting time then you can't take advantage of the growing time and you'll never make it to the plucking time or the harvesting time so you've got to know the season you're in to take advantage of the season you're in and if you take advantage of the season you're in it prepares you for the next springtime planting and putting in the hard work and plowing and sowing and spring cleaning and all the things we can think about in terms of the spring ensures that you can do take advantage of the summer time when things are growing i could even say this for kids in school that if you do your schoolwork in the spring you do your schoolwork in that second semester and you get it all done then you can take time in the summer to enjoy enjoy summer vacation and my when i was in school if you failed you'd have to go to summer school and by god's grace i never had to go to summer school but there's some that do that they don't take care of what they need to during the school year and they're left going taking classes in the summer why they didn't take advantage of the season that they had to apply themselves and these are the things that are part of god's plan part of the laws that are in the earth and things that are reflective for us many different places where these times and seasons are mentioned one that stood out to me today when i was reading this is in daniel chapter 2 verses 20 to 22. daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god forever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changeth the times and the seasons this is what brother branham is saying it never changes the seasons god has spring summer winter just exactly like it always was man could change the names man could bury his head in the sand and pretend it don't exist but god is the one that changes the times he's the one that changes the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and light dwelleth with him i want you to connect the uh the lane out of seasons whether it be winter spring summer fall or however order you'd want to place it in in terms of where you begin but the seasons are part of god's wisdom it is part of his character because it's even in the seasons it's telling the story of redemption from the from the spring to the summer to a winter or to the harvest again to go into the ground again in the fall brother the winter brother says it's telling the story of redemption he even just takes the cycle of a day and says it's the story of redemption in the 24-hour day then he takes the seasons and it's testifying of what death burial and resurrection so even in nature these laws of nature they're signifying part of god's mind and his plan and his nature testifying of redemption he put it there in the sign in the heavens to divide the day for night and for seasons for days and years and for signs telling the story of death burial and resurrection that's what's embodied in these seasons and we know these seasons have different characteristics and having different characteristics we need to capitalize on maybe that springtime to plant the seed where it can germinate at just the right temperature and i'm always amazed at just uh all the wisdom of god that's in the seed and in the ground and in the way that god has created the earth such that it's just the right temperature for that seed to go in the ground and germinate that's why some plants aren't indigenous or can't grow in these regions like they could in others because it's a characteristic of the seed it's a characteristic of the ground it's the characteristic of the environment and it just reaches that right spot where things can germinate and begin to bloom and begin to grow so seasons have different and and sometimes very vastly different and distinct characteristics for a reason there's a reason for the season and we're not preaching christmas either there are reasons for the seasons and brother graham says and things that are to be and and this is where i think this is maybe where the unique part comes from me because i just felt impressed to to just talk about the heat here in phoenix for a while but the message things are to be brother branham says i believe that god is a god of variety the world proves that he's got big mountains and little mountains he's got planes he's got deserts amen he's got different things because that was my amen he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it and he made the season summer winter spring autumn he made the seasons it shows he's a god of variety so this is god part of god's character he's a god of variety he makes mountains how many here like mountains i mean here like little mountains like big mountains and he says he's got planes anybody here like the plains and preferred over the mountains and then he says he's got deserts who here prefers the desert over the plains and over the mountains but he says he's got different ones and he even made the seasons for the deserts for the mountains and for the plains summer winter spring and fall and those of us maybe if you were born here raised here and lived here there are differences among winter and spring and autumn and summer in other parts of this great country and the world but these things are varied because it's part of god's nature he said he made you in a variety i really like this statement he says some men are real blusterous and some are real dogmatic and others are fine i don't know what he means by that the blesterous and dogmatic are not fine i don't know if he's talking about looks i think he's talking about people who are just they're good people he says others are kind and he says and you just find all different kinds of people and in his kingdom i i take it that maybe is he referring to the blusterous and dogmatic that are in god's kingdom he says god makes them all this way they're just dogmatic others are fine others are kind i'd want to be of the fine and kind believe it was brother obed was wearing the shirt the other night they said it's cool to be kind and it had my approval it's cool to be kind i'd say it's probably cool to be fine too because it's just f you find all different kinds of people and they're in his kingdom so as much as we might want to lament the summer time like this is just of the devil and the mountains are where god dwells and the planes are real the real beauty of god can be same he made all of it and he made it for a reason now i'd like to come to a subject that is very precious to all of us here and we're all living in it by experience and so this is where again we could just really enter in and be of one mind and one of corbett i want to talk about summertime in phoenix and for those of us those of you who are here from tucson and flagstaff you just carry with us a little bit and think about summertime in phoenix it's a hot time really hot time even so much so to where because of the air conditioning systems here i'm thinking that maybe we can't have evening services during the summer as much i'd like to have them because the ac unit just can't keep up with it it's a hot time and guess what some love it see it wasn't completely quiet at that point nobody laid out on me nobody said i don't think so brother aaron some people love it others hate it and i think the biggest part of our summers is what i call the war of attrition because the sister elizabeth even took time here recently to study the temperatures and i think even they report this that historically the hottest temperatures of the year on average are usually the last week of june and so you've pretty much hit your peak here as far as high temperatures average temperatures at the at the end of june and we all think praise the lord isn't that awesome well it just means it doesn't really on average get hotter but it doesn't necessarily mean that temperatures are dropping back down in the 50s anytime soon and so what it becomes is a war of attrition in other words the earlier it gets hot you're like hey 105 that ain't bad and i think 105 ain't that bad even 110 in the shade you wouldn't even really know it but it's after 110 days of 110 or 100 something straight days with no relief never breaking out of three-digit temperature it kind of becomes a war of attrition to where after a while even if you can hack it you're like i want something different and so this is kind of what we usually set ourselves up for in the summer and so when i said at summer time nobody here was kind of saying yes all right yeah we love this and brother branham may even validate this or maybe giving some people some really good ammunition but in the hidden life with christ brother bram says i'd rather have it cold than hot though thank you for not getting too riled up and breaking into dance he says i can't stand hot weather never did like hot weather and so this is someone his preference some may say that's thus saith the lord and it's god speaking but he said i'd rather have it cold than hot though i can't stand hot weather never did like hot weather that's his that's his preference god has a variety he's got deserts he's got planes he's got mountains big mountains even when it comes to fishing i love to bass fish but to a fly fisherman trout i am the lowest of all lows as a bass fisherman because god's got a variety even in hobbies and things that people like but it says i'd rather have it cold than hot and then in the message and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies he's speaking about phoenix he says they hear that somebody tells me and this is a quote when it rains in phoenix everybody just stays in bed and he says such a change you know that the same they had back then in 62 even then if it rains in phoenix everyone stays in bed he says one of these days i'm gonna going to get a free meal they tell me you can have a free meal every day the sun don't shine i'm going to watch it today make them pay off for that and so that's true phoenix has one of the highest the greatest number of days of sunshine in the earth second only to yuma and so arizona has the most days of sunlight of any state in the union uh and he's saying hey if it does the sun doesn't show itself today then you get a free meal and the other kind of the other saying is when it rains in phoenix everybody just stays in bed because that's the gloom the doom i guess and it's i think what you really want to do is open up the windows and smell that creosote and that desert come alive and just enjoy it because you don't get any snow days here so if you get a rain day they cancel the buses i remember my grandma she was born and raised in the u.p she's a hooper there in uh escanaba gladstone michigan all year long the the residents there in the u.p look forward to summer and it's something that they all do you go through those hard winters in spring it's still cold the ice is not breaking up till june on the lakes and they say that they look forward to sun to summer all year and if it falls on a sunday they'll hold a picnic i mean it only lasts one day all right moving on in the message why brother braham says we live in tucson why no he he's not asking the question about that he says we live in tucson arizona now and he says it's been awfully hot out there and i read this one this one i picked for a reason it's awfully hot out there in tucson he says but we find that it's a little bit hotter here at home than it was out there see it may be hot here but it's hotter there may be hot here in phoenix but it's hotter back east it's hotter in jeffersonville hotter in hot springs he says because of the tremendous humidity can we get an amen to that maybe hot in phoenix but i'd rather have 104 in phoenix than 86 in newton north carolina why because of the tremendous humidity it's a little bit hotter out in the east he says and it kind of puts us down he's talking about himself how they kind of acclimated to the tucson weather kind of puts us down after getting kind of used to the air out there why because it's a dry heat i we were talking about uh well uh housewarming gifts and welcoming gifts to people who moved from the east here and we thought a humidifier would be in order the bloody noses that seem to pop themselves up to somebody moving here for the first time so there's a pro tip for anybody listening humidifiers when you come now he makes a statement and this is a little bit on a different line i was studying the weather but i was doing it in the message and the great coming revival and outpouring of the holy spirit that's the title he says you talk about this hot weather this is hot he says he predicts that there'd be a time in the bible where men will even dig holes in the ground trying to get into it to hide themselves from the heat she would think this is bad stick around for the tribulation says people are trying to be digging holes in the ground to try to escape the heat and then he transitions to this he says standing not long ago in phoenix arizona when the chief of police there we'd been out on a little hog hunt out in the wilderness for a couple days of rest stand there he said brother branham i don't understand when i was just a boy phoenix would be green along in march it don't get green all year now unless it's where it's there's irrigation you have to go plumb onto flagstaff somewhere to get green in march they talk about water shortages brother around in these different places i read we're talking about rivers drying up lakes drying up and even then they were they had great consternation about the water supply where they're going to get water from and things drying up and the drought even the bible talks about the drought of summer and you think this is hot there's a hotter time coming there's a hotter day coming and he says even in 1954 how the chief of police is recognizing that it doesn't even get as green as it used to unless they're bringing in water from somewhere else and bringing in irrigation he says you have to go further out some other place to find the areas where it's green that's the summer time for us that's the time that we're living and now that everybody's just as pleased as punch and happy tonight to think about where we live let's think about summer in a little bit different light in exodus chapter 12 verses 1 to 2 it says the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying i know you all recognize this chapter of the bible it's when the exodus is on exodus chapter 12 they're going to be given the instructions on the passover there's going to be an exodus of the children of israel is this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you god was throwing away the old calendar and giving him a new one and on this new moon at the exact time when this new moon would be expressing itself it started a new calendar a new way of keeping time a new way of keeping seasons and under in their bondage and i guess you could even say that just kind of according to the tradition of the world and how man would keep time instead of using the solar tradition of the god of ra the god of the egyptians that would be done away with and now they would actually adopt the moon in order to calculate months i'm not going to do it the egyptian way anymore raw the sun god we're not going to do it that way anymore but now there's going to be a beginning of months the jews and the children of israel are going to look to a different sign to regulate their days to regulate their seasons and to regulate their months and so the hebrew calendar is different from the gregorian or even what the julian was uh different from a solar calendar and actually this is really helpful when you begin to look at feast days or things in the bible and even the times of the crucifixion they talk about the evening time a day begins with the sun going down that's what how a day begins to a hebrew so the moon and its phases clock for the months and for the seasons and for the appointed time or for the feast they're all timed around the moon and even the days that they have been given the days that are given or the names that are given to the calendar jewish calendar were instituted in the time of ezra but this jewish year is a cycle with holidays and festivals and different seasons to a jew to the hebrew their spring contains different months what they would call their springtime it's march april and part of may for them and then their summer is may june july august and sometime part of september and they have spring feast and they have fall feasts and they have one feast that kind of comes just right at the beginning of the summer there's ways that they divide them up to where there's ones that are just spring and ones that are in fall spring and harvest but there's one that kind of marks itself at the beginning of summer for israel and it's called the feast of weeks shavuot is the is the word the feast of which what meaning seven weeks in leviticus chapter 23 15 to 16 it says you shall come you shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering seven sabbath shall be complete so there was the sheaf of a wave offering in that that festival and then there's seven sabbaths that are going to be complete even unto the moral after the seventh sabbath so not after seven weeks and 49 days but on the 50th day shall you show you a number on the mark the 7th sabbath shall you number 50 days and you shall offer a new meal meat offering a meal offering meat offering unto the lord so this scripture is where they count the seventh sabbath and the day following the 50 days it's celebrated seven weeks in a day after the passover and it's called the feast of weeks shavuot or the feast of pentecost that would be the greek or the latin because it means 50. and that's where we get pentecost from is this feast of weeks and this feast of weeks i just want to settle on it for just a little bit it's just after eight o'clock i don't plan on being very long we've already passed the longest day of the year and so things are just getting shorter already but it's it marks the culmination to it to the israelite to the hebrews this summer feast this feast that comes at this transition time this summer time it marks the culmination of israel's exodus from egypt which begins at the feast of the passover and that if you count the seven weeks and the day it's at a time of the giving of the law at mount sinai that's an incredible event for to hebrew to an israelite is what begins in the feast of the passover then 50 days later is climax and cometing at the base of this mountain moses up on a mountaintop god giving the law and this is what's significant about this early this late spring or this early summer feast and this is i just want to mention this that to the hebrews as i studied this they actually called this season a season of liberation because it's their exodus from egypt it's their release from bondage and to them it commemorates season of liberation and one of the things i've been pondering quite frequently lately with the series on our family tree originally the it was going to be a free family was the thought that i had because i it means more to me today my liberty in christ continues to me more to me today than it ever has before and the things that god liberates his children from you can be free from sin free from death but you can still have hooks of of legalism you can have hooks of politics and hooks of personality and a lot of things that we just learn along the way that really don't have anything to do with the message it's just some sort of bent or slant that kind of attaches itself onto it but it's so beautiful to be free from judgments and thought processes and condemnations and always trying to compare yourself or always trying to make yourself feel right and how do i fit in it's so beautiful to be free that's what this summer time can mean for maybe a lot of the young people is once it's summer you're free from school and school's out this is wonderful and free i'm free and that's exactly what summertime would mean to a hebrew is liberty and freedom it's also the opening of the harvest season for israel summertime is the opening of a harvest season in exodus chapter 34 versus verse 22 and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks shavuot that's the feast of weeks the feast of pentecost of the first fruits of wheat offering and those things are combined together so they're kind of added to it and it is a it's different from the wave sheath of that first barley grain so this is a different one the feast of weeks joined with the first fruits of the wheat harvest not barley but the wheat that may mean something to a few who recognize those distinctions in the wave offerings and it says and the feast of inn gathering at the year's end which is the feast of tabernacles and so they're told you're to observe these things observe the feast of weeks and the first fruits of the week together observe them why because it memorializes something that god had done to them this summertime feast was an opportunity to reflect in these moments and in these feast days on what god had done for them they even looked at it in terms of god sinning and delivered the paces of the plagues the the passover night the leaving and crossing the red sea and ultimately finding themselves at the base of mount sinai and god thundering out and speaking from this mountain and giving the law to moses they look at this that's the culmination of redemption to them and we could say certainly that would be the climax of the coming out of but there was also a coming in too but it spoke to redemption this season the azereth pasek means that to them it's the gathering rally of passover that's what this summertime feast would mean this atsuret tasak is the gathering rally of the passover so you have the feast of passover you're all with me tonight i'm glad to be preaching to real jews but they have the the feast of the passover but then they called this evil if you want to look at it and type the gathering at mount sinai but this coming together at the feast of pentecost or the feast of weeks this is something that all males were required healthy meals were required to gather together in jerusalem for and this when they came together just as they would have been at the base of mount sinai later on in the evolution of the temple they would all come together and they'd gather together they'd call it the gathering rally the passover in other words it's what the passover was leading to they had the passover but it wasn't just in itself just a passover but this is what it led to so many consider the shavuot on mount sinai as the birth of judaism it was at that moment at that time at that mountain when god gave the law when god gave the law and they received the law from moses they said this is when we were born as a nation this is when we were born not not so much as a nation but a nation under god this is when we became his cherished people whom he had redeemed out of the land of egypt because now all those sons of abraham have materialized the seed of abraham the prophecies to abraham how his people would soldier in a strange land now they're carrying the very bones of joseph's bones they're coming out of out of egypt and they're bringing him to the base of mount sinai and god sees the law it's in that moment that they believe that they have been birthed as jews as judaism their religion when the law came forth that's when they were born that was at the feast of weeks but it's also called the feast of pentecost so christ we know is crucified at the time of the passover and then it is a time of a planting of a seed there's even a resurrection and life begins to come forth but then you count the seven days and then you come to the 50th day and it says in acts chapter 2 verses 1 to 4 and when the day of pentecost was fully come the day of shavuot the day of the feast of weeks was fully come now the disciples are in that place where christ called them to told them to tarry until they be endued with power from on high they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance we noted here recently how they went out speaking and every man heard them in their own language this was on the day of pentecost this is when all these males of a certain age who are healthy could come and gather for the feast of weeks the gathering rally of the passover required to come back to the temple and at the very moment when the jews are celebrating their liberation and they're remarking this observing of the feast of weeks and the first fruits of the wheat harvest and it's a season of liberation it references the to them it's the culmination of redemption it's the gathering of the passover where jude at that very same moment god back the holy spirit to do what the birth of christianity it's the birth of the body of christ which is the church at the very same the the symmetry that god chooses in that moment at this feast at this time it's a remembrance of not just redemption of coming out of but now is the birth of the church coming out of spiritual bondage into the body of christ and christianity that's what summertime means might be a hot time might be a miserable time might be a war of attrition might last a lot longer than we think it does there was a saying we lived here before we had the saying and i think it's just that cognitive dissonance you try to make everybody else feel jealous i but they say well it's hot three months out of the year but beautiful nine months out of the year and that's what phoenicians say right when we live here and we want to impress other people but when we're honest with each other it's not nine months out of the year right and three months out of the year it's nice and i promise i thought i read a quote that said exactly that and i spent a great portion this week trying to find it haven't found it yet but when i do we'll nail it to that front door because i am certain i heard brother brown say one time almost exactly the office how it's nice three months out here in hot the rest of the year so now go for it stay up on trying to google that i could i haven't been able to find it and i spent a fair amount of time on it but that's but summertime can mean something different to us in a spiritual sense obviously and what it means to the jews and for them in summer time it marked a fruitful time this is what i found interesting when i began to study these phrases this week is how often summertime was associated with the harvest fruits and gathering and harvesting summer you're thinking no that has to be fall that has to be fall but the blooms of spring are already turning into fruit in the summer for certain plants there's a there's a cycle there's even summer fruit there's fruit that's planted in the spring and you can harvest within the same year sometimes even with the summer and so summertime marks a fruitful time think about this for us personally as we enter to this hot time of year and this this season where it's kind of the war of attrition and nobody wants to be here and and we start to get a little bit weary and maybe we start to lose a little bit of our dylan uh we don't want to go outside we don't want to start the car we don't want to go to church we're afraid it's going to be hot these are some other things to think about season of liberation season to celebrate the things that god has done there's a lot of things we could ponder and it marks a fruitful time the feast of weeks the shavuot was a festival of thanking god for the blessing of the harvest because they would already begin to bring in summer fruits i found this phrase a few different places in scripture in second samuel 16 1 and when david was a little past the top of the hill behold ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses saddled and upon them 200 loaves of bread and a hundred bunches of raisins and a hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of wine these summer fruits were fruits that would have been gathered and harvested already in the summertime not not fruits are waiting to come in the fall but fruits that were naturally being produced in that time and in that season for all the grocery shoppers here we know there's times a year that things naturally are harvested i even know some people who refuse to eat an avocado at certain times a year because they don't believe there's any way that that naturally could have been grown at that time of year there's other fruits that you eat when you know that's the season for tomatoes that's the season for oranges that's the season for watermelons that's when we believe they're at their best and healthy because they're the fruits that grow and come in that summer time right we're all familiar with that right there's things that come to fruit and we crab and eat during the summer season they're called summer fruits god even speaking to israel in deuteronomy chapter 8 talks about wheat and barley and vines and figs and pomegranates and olive oil and honey it's the biquarium which is the the summer fruits the seven species of plant that's gonna wheat's going to come forth barley's going to come forth grapes and figs and pomegranates olives and dates they're called the fruits of summer it was originally going to be my title for the sermon fruits of summer it might have probably been a little bit more spiritual for those who perused the titles besides it's summertime not a reference to a song or anything but fruits of summer is what these things are and this is where maybe i pondered these things and just thought i knew it was the lord press it on my heart to share it i knew it was a little bit different maybe uncomfortable for me to do it but i thought this is this is where it really began to mean something to me today when i pondered it is summer should be a fruitful time but it seems to be so easy to lose some momentum in the summertime it could be for us in phoenix just because of the the heat it could be for some because the interruption of the schedule there's things that parents have to deal with that when the kids are in school they can maintain a certain schedule then you just think about it if you have your kids in school and they're in school all day long from monday to friday during the school year but then all of a sudden they're no longer at school anymore and you're at work monday through friday you got to start making some changes there's things you have to take in consideration there's a lot of different changes that take place and i want to encourage all of us even to some of our young men and our young ladies to our young people that we want to be fruitful this summer because it's a season of fruitfulness very easy i noticed this amongst young people i can remember in my time as as as a teenager that when the summer came you just slept in i mean that's like what summer was for is not getting out of your pajamas ever at all sometimes because you didn't need to you stayed up all night your parents your dad had to go to work and your mom had things to do so they were always in bed but you would just stay up all night doing all whatever you wanted to do and the next day you just slept all day long and those are the things you could do in summertime and summertime can be full of a lot of idleness and a lot of wastefulness but but i'm saying this summer saying it to everyone i'm saying to all of you let's not be idle this summer let's not give give in to laziness let's not give in maybe to the doldrums and the and the weariness and the wastefulness but this is a time to be active the bible says in proverbs 10 5 he that gathereth in summer is a wise son he that gathereth in summer is a wise son we say oh no no no no we gotta wait until the harvest but he that sleepeth and harvest is the sun that causes shame it's not just in the fall months that we can be gathering fruits we can be doing it right now he that gathers in summer it's a time to be active a time to be up and doing it's a fruitful time there's so much that we can take advantage of just think of the opportunities that might be afforded to us now in this season that aren't afforded to us in other seasons that's one reason why we take family vacations we get away we do certain things because the time constraints the demands of school the demands of the other season give us opportunity to do that seven says in proverbs 6 8 about the ant speaking about the answers provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest that's what the ant does it provided her meat in the summer and gathered her food in the harvest i don't know if you knew this but did you know that the bible calls ants people isn't that amazing if you really want to lock somebody up i had somebody say how can you believe the message i was like well i believe a book of dragons and unicorns man all right the things i believe in the bible are even crazier than the vindication of it in the message of the hour and and then they don't really know where to go with that i think they start googling unicorns but the bible says the answer people says the ants are a people not strong i don't know what the hebrew is but it sure reads funny that the ants are a people not strong and though they're not strong yet they prepare their meat in the summer so if we're people bigger than ants and we not being ants but we are a people even though we might consider ourselves to be weak we're instructed by the scripture to prepare our meat in the summer otherwise we'll find ourselves lamenting as they do in jeremiah chapter 8 verse 20 the harvest has passed the summer is ended and we are not saved the harvest is past the summer is in it these are the times when you would gather in things and you would store up for the later seasons you'd store it for the winter and because we did not prepare our meat in the summer we weren't up and doing we weren't gathering in we weren't taking advantage of that season to build up and to take these things in and store these things he says we are not saved and i think summer's a time when we ought not to give into idleness or laziness and not given to excessive spending but continue to to honor the lord and please the lord with all the things that we do because summertime not only does it mark a fruitful time this is kind of my last thought on the subject of summer time taking it from the scripture or from the principle and the seasons of the word of god summertime's a time of growing it's a time of maturing found one definition i believe it's in the merry and western dictionary it's actually comes up in a lot of other dictionaries that the definition of summer is the period of maturing powers that's what summer is it's a period of maturing powers i guess we're all going to find out how mature we are based upon how we respond to 100 consecutive days of over 100 degree temperatures but it is a period of maturing powers it is the time when the sun is at a particular intensity where it is in the in in the sky and how it works upon the plant and the nature within the plant to actually mature seeds to their harvest form that's the season of the summer maybe we can let it lean into the fruitful time lean into this this time of maturing power lord i want to i don't want to slack off i don't want to get lazy i don't want to use this as an excuse to find myself dilly dallying and not being diligent with the things of god but let it be a time when i can take advantage of the season to let the word of god continue to mature me brother branham uses this in the church age book and read it from chapter eight first he says remember please that the sardisian age started the reformation that must still go on until the grain that was planted at pentecost goes through the full cycle of planting watering nourishing until it comes right back to the original seed so he's looking at that cycle planting water and nourishing back to original seed time for harvest while this is going on the tears that were sown will have to go through their cycle and be harvested harvested also that is exactly what we see happening if you the plant that you see and this is the part i want you to focus on growing in full strength in the summer that's what summer is the time of growing the growing of in full strength in the summer suddenly appears to be going to seed summertime is the time of growing to full strength full intensity and then he says suddenly it appears to be going to seed he says you can't tell exactly when summer become autumn it just faded into it so if you're thinking oh this layout to see and age and and these things you say well that is how the ages are especially these last two it just blends in from full strength to harvest time blending from full strength into to rapturing power brother man comes back to it the resume of the age is in chapter 10 of the church age book he says the lutheran age was the springtime the wesleyan age was the summer of growth the layout of scene age is the harvest time of gathering the tares for binding and burning and garnering the wheat for the lord this is applicable on a church age level has application to us in our individual walk and experience with god there's an age which is the summer of growth jesus talks about the seasons and he says that when the fruit is mature immediately the sickle is thrust because it no longer time on the it's not going to get any more mature than mature once it's that point of maturity that the longer it stays on the vine it's going to rot so you have to you have to harvest at a peak point and peak time and it can become tricky for those in horticulture and those who are growing plants got to know the right time to engage in the harvest that you can get the maximum ripeness and some need to be harvested just a little bit before because they're going to be transported and not enjoying to be enjoyed immediately and i'm not pretending to be a farmer so i'm not going to try to get into all that but it's the principle that there's a tea time and a season of growing a summer of growth growing in full strength in the summer that's what summertime is it's a time to grow a time to mature not a time to wither if you think it's hot here it's a little bit hotter out there because of the tremendous humidity summer time fruitful time time of growing and maturing and as i close i had a quote that i was wanting to use wasn't sure just where to use it i thought i'll just use it at the end and i'll express this to you as a church that because it is summertime and our children are some of them are not in school i think some do year round school some are taking college courses during the summer others some of us will have jobs that the summer gives no regard to but whatever could be afforded us during this time it's a time to enjoy the fruits of your labor it's a time to enjoy fruits and to be fruitful and it's a time to grow and mature it's a time to thank god for what he's done in his deliverance and his liberation i i would encourage you in the summertime if there's more time uh to be had there's these paradoxes of of being busy where it seems like you're busy so you don't want to be busy so either you're either busy or you're lazy because you're just it's that tussle and the struggle one against the other let's not fall into idleness it's not succumb to uh to laziness but let's use this time to enjoy the things of god and i know that it's during this time that it gets hot here and maybe it might be more so in this place in phoenix than it is in any other place where people want to leave town as soon as it gets hot and brother man makes this statement and knoweth it not he says when we were here the other time everybody got sick it's august 15th and he says the change from that real hot climate down to this cool climate you got here so he's talking about the hot hot climate to cool climb he says i know you think this is not cool and it's because he came from arizona uh to a cooler climb he says you i know you think this is not cool but you come out to arizona once it was 109 in the shade when i left the other morning and then at around midnight in the night when the cool air come off down off the mountain it was still 96. that's at midnight when the cool air was coming down can i get a witness right is that not true you look at the temperatures they're just hovering there they don't they don't get low enough at night even when that cool air comes around just all the the concrete jungle and all that radiant heat it just builds and builds and builds he said that's at midnight he said the place is all right in the winter time you listening liz i'll tell you i'm probably giving ammunition to somebody but i'm not afraid to read from the message he says it's all right in the wintertime but it's for scorpions and lizards in the summertime not human beings all right it's easy there for scorpions and lizards in the summertime not human beings he says even all the animals take off for the mountains they just can't stand it kobandaba shah three times seven that's what you were looking for right is a quote to justify leaving phoenix and going to the mountains why he says they just can't stand it and so i want to add my voice to that and say if you could take a vacation this summer take it take advantage of it because brother bram says the lizards and scorpions do it and you ants are a people not strong you might as well do it too right and i say it in this sense it may seem to be a little bit of a jest and i say it jokingly but i i want i for myself and for my family we're at every service right i never wake up on a sunday morning and ask my wife should we go today we come right we're just we're not going to miss and it's easy when you're when we're in that mode as the pastor and the pastor's family it's easy for us to always notice when others aren't here you would notice maybe if i didn't show up on wednesday night brother michael just keeps singing and finally at 8 30 he's like well i guess we're just gonna dismiss brother aaron didn't show up you'd all notice if i didn't show up one time well in the same way as a family we notice when people don't show up that maybe you don't notice but it just seems we have this heightened sensitivity and i want you as the as the people and the members of this church the sheep that are here fellowshipping just to know that there's no law that binds you to be at every service and if you're not here you're somehow going to break some written or unwritten rule if it's the summer time when all the lizards and scorpions are headed out to the mountains because they can't stand the heat if this is your time and your opportunity to take a vacation take advantage of it the only thing i guess i would say is try not to leave when i'm gone because i'd love i'd rather everyone be here for visiting ministry than everyone be here when i'm here because you always have a chance to hear me but i wanted to share that to say if you have an opportunity take the opportunity very important to our our sanity i know it is as a minister as a family that's committed itself to serving the body of christ that it's important for us to take our breaks it's important to have our time away to regroup as a family to be refreshed and revived and believe it or not you may not feel like it some of you say well i never take vacations we never go away we never have time away you need it and you say well no i want to be at every service i want to be there every time the church doors are open that's wonderful and that's great but time away with your family is also wonderful put in the right things first if you want to follow the grateful dead i don't know if they still do that if they're still dead heads you want to go to some music festival or burning man i probably wouldn't advise that but getting away as a family spending time with extended families seeing places and doing things you otherwise wouldn't have an opportunity to do summertime's the time to do it and i know many of you take advantage of it and i wanted just to add that that we understand we know what this the season is like and so i said summer time take advantage of it whatever that might mean to you however you might be able to put that in application it's a unique time it's a hot time but it's a time to take advantage of it god bless you let's stand this evening
