[0:00] first corinthians chapter seven
[0:02] and we're going to read verses one to
[0:03] nine
[0:05] and desire today just to relax and share
[0:08] some things that are on our heart
[0:10] continuing on this subject of barriers
[0:12] and boundaries
[0:14] and
[0:15] it is going to still be kind of focused
[0:17] on
[0:19] love has limits but we're kind of
[0:20] changing the emphasis a little bit just
[0:22] to be able to focus more
[0:24] on us another subject first corinthians
[0:26] chapter 7 verses 1 to 9. now concerning
[0:29] the things wherever he wrote unto me
[0:31] it is good for a man not to touch a
[0:33] woman
[0:34] nevertheless to avoid fornication let
[0:36] every man have his own wife and let
[0:37] every woman have her own husband let the
[0:40] husband render unto the wife due
[0:41] benevolence and likewise also the wife
[0:43] unto the husband
[0:45] the wife hath not power of her own body
[0:48] but the husband and likewise also
[0:51] the husband hath no power of his own
[0:53] body but the wife defrauded not one
[0:56] the other except it be with consent for
[0:58] a time that you may give yourselves to
[1:00] fasting in prayer
[1:01] and come together again that satan
[1:03] tempts you not for your incontinency but
[1:06] i speak this by permission and not of
[1:08] commandment for i would that all men
[1:10] were even as myself but every man hath
[1:12] his proper gift of god one after this
[1:14] man and another after that i say
[1:16] therefore to the unmarried and widows it
[1:19] is good for them if they abide even as i
[1:21] but if they cannot contain let them
[1:23] marry for it is better to marry than to
[1:26] burn
[1:27] paul kind of puts it in an interesting
[1:28] light there i find if you need to get
[1:30] married so you don't burn go ahead but
[1:32] there's some wonderful things he's
[1:33] expressing here and it's interesting to
[1:35] note that he says let me refer to what
[1:37] you've written me about before he was
[1:39] asked these questions
[1:40] and so there's just some really really
[1:42] profound things that paul is eliciting
[1:44] here for us let's pray together this
[1:46] morning our gracious heavenly father
[1:48] as we're standing together we have
[1:50] just a wonderful feeling in our spirit
[1:52] says the atmosphere
[1:54] i believe
[1:56] the people have created through their
[1:57] expectation
[1:58] and you have come amongst us in a very
[2:01] specific way very precious way
[2:03] to remind us that you are with us
[2:06] and it was expressed to me
[2:08] before service before we prayed a
[2:10] brother shared just how much the lord
[2:12] had impressed upon him that this service
[2:14] was going to be very precise and maybe
[2:16] even very specific for somebody
[2:18] and we realized today lord as a church
[2:20] that maybe maybe it's possible that we
[2:23] have all gathered
[2:25] for the sake of one person
[2:27] and we would not begrudge that at all
[2:29] lord we would be happy to know that we
[2:31] came with our expectation with our
[2:33] readiness with our prayers
[2:35] and with uh with the sincerity and that
[2:37] you could come and move upon one
[2:39] person's heart and make a difference and
[2:40] change their lives we would rejoice in
[2:42] that
[2:43] and lord i would even pray let that be
[2:45] me
[2:46] because we we are
[2:49] we are needy people and we desire that
[2:51] you would speak to us and help us
[2:53] but lord let me just yield myself
[2:55] completely to do my part that you could
[2:56] have your way
[2:58] and may you get the glory for it father
[3:00] commit all thanks to you now in the name
[3:02] of the lord jesus christ amen
[3:04] you can be seated
[3:07] the um the new subject that we're going
[3:10] to be looking at and exploring is
[3:11] respect
[3:12] and i think that even this entire
[3:14] subject in many ways can be described as
[3:17] respect you talk about barriers
[3:20] that would be something in your way
[3:21] you're supposed to be doing something
[3:23] but there's a barrier there
[3:25] and if someone put that barrier there
[3:27] that would be disrespectful
[3:29] if you are doing it yourself you're
[3:30] disrespecting some purpose or some cause
[3:33] that god would have you to be
[3:34] accomplishing
[3:35] and so
[3:36] i think it's very easy for us and those
[3:39] of us who have been in this subject now
[3:40] for the first 10 services
[3:42] to
[3:44] to kind of identify just how critical
[3:46] this subject of respect is or just how
[3:47] it's kind of central to the entire thing
[3:50] and then if there are boundaries if
[3:51] you're setting a boundary you are
[3:53] showing that there is a healthy sense of
[3:55] self-respect um and self-protection of
[3:57] your spirit guarding your hearts and
[3:59] protecting your body
[4:00] and then even if we were to observe
[4:03] others boundaries and be sensitive to
[4:05] what they might be going through that's
[4:07] showing a respect for somebody else and
[4:09] brother bram teaches us that if i'm if i
[4:11] respect you and you respect me we're
[4:13] respecting god and so even the way that
[4:16] we respect one another is showing a
[4:17] respect to god into his word so in this
[4:20] subject i will say that
[4:23] um this is based on and resting on the
[4:25] things that we've ministered to this
[4:27] point if someone hasn't heard the first
[4:29] several parts to this i don't think
[4:30] you're going to be confused or at any
[4:32] loss but i have the confidence to
[4:34] explore some of these things knowing
[4:35] that we've established a certain
[4:37] principles in the word of god so
[4:39] if anything does seem to be a little bit
[4:41] out of place you can draw from
[4:43] draw from some of the prior services but
[4:45] in this if i could say this way at the
[4:47] outset
[4:48] on respect it's about respecting
[4:49] yourself and respecting others
[4:51] uh by by observing your thresholds your
[4:54] limits setting limits by observing
[4:56] boundaries
[4:57] and then also by addressing barriers
[4:59] that if there's something in your way
[5:01] and it's hindering you and it's causing
[5:02] a discomfort it's doing something to
[5:04] keep you back and there has to be a
[5:06] healthy way and a scripture way to
[5:08] address a barrier because our spirits
[5:09] need to be free
[5:11] and we do there's a difference in
[5:13] addressing something and confronting
[5:15] something
[5:16] you confront something it's probably
[5:17] going to escalate the barrier is going
[5:19] to get bigger but if you can address it
[5:21] you might find a way through it in a way
[5:22] over it and so those are just some
[5:24] things that
[5:25] i might uh wet your whistle a little bit
[5:28] and get you thinking about what we have
[5:29] in our hearts now i'm going to jump in
[5:32] on a couple scriptures that we've used
[5:34] over the last two services
[5:36] and if we could just now uh if i could
[5:38] just signal that i'm just gonna i'm not
[5:40] reviewing i'm preaching now uh so if the
[5:42] if you need to activate the a man switch
[5:45] um and this is the this is the moment we
[5:47] say all right we're preaching personal
[5:49] story um my dad um
[5:53] likes to play tapes a lot and as a
[5:55] pastor
[5:56] and so he had this habit where he would
[5:58] get up and he'd introduce the tape and
[6:00] so you think well all right he's
[6:01] introducing the tape and then an hour
[6:02] and a half later you're like wait a
[6:04] minute he was preaching i wish i would
[6:06] have known that i would have got i
[6:07] wouldn't have been waiting for the push
[6:09] play and so i'm just letting you know
[6:11] now i'm preaching you know so that you
[6:13] don't you're not you don't have to wait
[6:14] till i'm done with my review i'm ready
[6:15] to go
[6:17] and uh and that was uh that was always a
[6:19] frustrating thing because you're waiting
[6:20] for him you just think it's preface he's
[6:22] just prefacing and next thing you know
[6:24] he's preached for an hour and a half and
[6:25] you're like i missed something i should
[6:26] have been paying attention
[6:28] proverbs chapter 25 verses 27 to 28
[6:32] it says it is not good to eat much honey
[6:34] for so men to search their own glory is
[6:37] not glory for to seek out your own
[6:39] vindication to lift yourself up to uh
[6:42] think more of yourself than you ought to
[6:43] saying that no matter what glory you
[6:45] think you find he's saying in the end it
[6:47] is not glory but it's detrimental in the
[6:50] same way that eating a lot of honey it
[6:51] might be sweet to taste and you might be
[6:53] finding this to be very very good but
[6:55] you cross this threshold where now it's
[6:57] a detriment to you now it's it's soured
[6:59] your stomach it's made you sick so it's
[7:01] this parallel
[7:03] of honey is good but too much is bad and
[7:06] then he says but to seek your own glory
[7:08] is the same thing if you're going to
[7:09] seek your own glory it's going to end up
[7:11] being a negative it's going to be a
[7:12] detriment and this is this is related to
[7:15] the pride paradox how that you need to
[7:17] have a healthy sense of self you need to
[7:19] value yourself you need to see yourself
[7:21] in the word of god but you can't see
[7:22] yourself the wrong way in
[7:24] a bad sense to where you think less of
[7:26] yourself but you want not to think more
[7:27] of yourself than you should
[7:29] and so with that uh preface he says he
[7:32] that hath no rule over his own spirit
[7:35] is like a city that is broken down and
[7:37] without walls so this this phrase has no
[7:40] rule over his own spirit means he has no
[7:41] self-control he cannot control himself
[7:44] he has no fence about him he's not
[7:46] within the the prop within the dew
[7:48] bounds or the proper bounds of what he
[7:50] is as a person you can relate this back
[7:52] to somebody who eats too much honey or
[7:54] seeks his own glory this might be
[7:56] somebody who ventures into areas that he
[7:58] ought not to or somebody who thinks more
[8:00] of himself than he should and attempts
[8:02] things and attempts to do things that he
[8:04] shouldn't do or and and he's just simply
[8:07] put has no self-control cannot control
[8:10] himself and uses the phrase is like a
[8:13] city that is broken down this is
[8:14] something that's been breached it's in
[8:16] pieces
[8:17] and it's
[8:18] as a city without walls
[8:21] the city without walls has no borders it
[8:23] has no distinction without walls since
[8:26] there's no borders there's no boundaries
[8:28] there's no clear delineation of
[8:30] responsibility and when does its
[8:32] jurisdiction end at what at what point
[8:34] are we where do our defenses begin where
[8:36] does our responsibility begin
[8:38] and as walls represent protection uh it
[8:41] also in safety it also represents a
[8:44] restraint and a control
[8:46] and this is a beautiful picture
[8:49] for us to consider
[8:51] that if i do not have walls if i do not
[8:54] set boundaries then i'm i have that's a
[8:57] it's a mark of having no self-control
[9:00] whether it is to protect yourself or it
[9:02] whether it is to uh to keep yourself
[9:05] from venturing into things saying and
[9:07] doing things that you shouldn't do
[9:09] and i realize now as i say this
[9:12] that what i was going to preach this
[9:14] morning i'm going to be preaching
[9:15] wednesday night lord willing if i don't
[9:16] preach it wednesday night i'll preach a
[9:18] sunday but i thought this morning would
[9:19] be the end
[9:20] of of this series
[9:22] but the lord just uh
[9:24] kind of you know had his way in the
[9:25] sense of just impressing upon me that
[9:27] there was something else i needed to
[9:29] uh deliver this morning
[9:31] and and reluctantly i'm going to be
[9:34] continuing on wednesday night if unless
[9:36] the lord
[9:37] which he's certainly welcome to do just
[9:39] put it into it or impose again
[9:41] but i realize now in speaking on this
[9:43] that there's uh some other things in
[9:45] terms of recognizing
[9:47] uh limits and even obeying the scripture
[9:50] of things that we shouldn't do to others
[9:52] but also how we ought to respond when
[9:54] others do things to us
[9:56] that really fit together with this
[9:58] and was going to kind of form a
[10:00] foundation for that so i apologize for
[10:02] that detour there
[10:05] but these
[10:06] this scripture
[10:08] is telling us that we ought to control
[10:09] ourselves
[10:11] and that this control is a boundary it's
[10:13] a it's a it's a protection
[10:16] so then first corinthians chapter 10
[10:17] verse 13. i think this relates to what
[10:19] we were ministering on last sunday
[10:22] there have no temptation taking you but
[10:24] such is common to man
[10:26] but god is faithful who will not suffer
[10:28] you to be tempted above that you are
[10:31] but will with the temptation also make a
[10:34] way of escape that you may be able to
[10:36] bear it
[10:39] excuse me
[10:40] this we took this to
[10:42] indicate that we all have limits and
[10:44] that god is recognizing that there is no
[10:46] temptation taking but such as common
[10:48] demand that other men haven't been
[10:50] tempted to
[10:51] uh that they haven't experienced but
[10:52] he's saying that for you individually he
[10:54] will not test you he will not tempt you
[10:57] above what you're able to bear that if
[10:59] you have some limit some threshold that
[11:01] you can't handle this even as a song
[11:03] says i know that i can take it i know
[11:05] that i can make it he's not going to put
[11:06] you through something that you cannot
[11:08] take he's not going to put you through
[11:09] something that you cannot make and he
[11:11] relates the way of being able to handle
[11:14] it that with the temptation there is a
[11:16] way of escape to be able to bear it so
[11:18] even if you say in this if i have to go
[11:21] through this all the way in this
[11:22] condition it'll destroy me it'll be the
[11:25] end of me god is saying no i'm going to
[11:27] give you something that you'll be able
[11:28] to bear up against him not that i'll
[11:30] remove the test or the trial but i'll
[11:32] give you something that you'll be able
[11:33] to bear up against him so god is
[11:35] acknowledging and recognizing that we
[11:37] have limits even though we have faith
[11:39] and we believe in
[11:40] a perfect word
[11:42] the word and this was
[11:45] expressed in great detail last sunday
[11:47] the bible tells us that
[11:49] it knows the word knows what we can
[11:51] handle knows what we're going through
[11:53] knows how we think and how we act and
[11:54] even when god dealt with moses in what
[11:57] seemed to be a very stern way why cried
[11:59] on me speak and this is moses at the red
[12:02] sea that brother brahm said god knew the
[12:04] man he knew what was in his heart he
[12:05] knew how to deal with them and if we
[12:07] looked at it just in the intellectual
[12:08] side we think well god's just a god of
[12:10] tough love and he's just going to kick
[12:11] us when we're down we saw a contrary
[12:13] example and how he dealt with elijah
[12:15] once again he knew elijah he knew his
[12:17] makeup he knew his background he knew
[12:18] his limits he knew what his what his
[12:20] heart was like so god dealt with elijah
[12:23] under the juniper tree different than he
[12:24] did moses
[12:26] at the red sea
[12:28] and we talked about the the thought of
[12:30] the danger zone how man is not cannot
[12:32] live above a certain 8 000 meters it's
[12:34] impossible you can never get used to it
[12:37] you never just say i'm going to bear
[12:38] under it i'm going to get used to it you
[12:39] have to flee that zone you have to get
[12:41] back
[12:42] to proper elevation to live
[12:44] and god has designed our bodies as well
[12:46] as our spirits to recognize when we're
[12:49] reaching a limit
[12:51] he's designed us that way
[12:53] he's designed us in such a way to where
[12:55] if we are coming up against something
[12:58] that is a detriment to our spirits we're
[12:59] coming up against something that is
[13:01] weakening our resolve or or defiling our
[13:03] faith or causing us to doubt or to lust
[13:06] or whatever that there's things that
[13:07] will be signaled in our bodies and our
[13:09] spirits to say hey you're in a situation
[13:11] that you cannot remain in and god has
[13:13] made us that way
[13:15] now there's um and this you'll see here
[13:17] this is where i'm starting to take a
[13:19] step forward in this
[13:21] just as an example
[13:23] has have any of you ever been in a
[13:25] situation where you feel like you can't
[13:26] say no
[13:29] now everybody's on my side now
[13:32] because we've all been there
[13:34] we don't want to say
[13:35] uh uh yes but we feel like we can't say
[13:38] no
[13:38] and what are we experiencing a pressure
[13:42] and and we may feel like well this isn't
[13:44] right or i don't want to do this or i
[13:46] would rather not whatever it might be we
[13:48] start to feel conflicted and we
[13:50] recognize that feeling of being
[13:52] uncomfortable we recognize that feeling
[13:54] of conflict that my conscience tells me
[13:57] to say no but the circumstances tell me
[14:00] that i don't have a choice that i have
[14:02] to say yes i have to give in to it and
[14:04] we all know what that feels like
[14:07] and
[14:07] and i want i want you to consider this
[14:10] that whenever we act against our
[14:12] conscience it wounds our conscience
[14:14] that whenever we're forced to do
[14:16] something that we don't want to do or if
[14:18] we we feel like we can't say no and we
[14:20] do it in in giving in and yielding
[14:22] there's a tax on the mind there's a tax
[14:24] on the body there's a cost uh to our
[14:27] spirits when we're forced to do
[14:28] something like that
[14:30] and the danger is to get in the mode of
[14:32] just always giving in
[14:34] and not recognizing that maybe there's
[14:37] conflict there's and whenever you're
[14:39] feeling that pressure it's for a reason
[14:42] and to give into it is there's a
[14:44] detriment there spiritually there's a
[14:46] detriment to your to your sanctification
[14:48] there's a detriment to your faith
[14:50] and if the more that you kind of get
[14:52] give into it the more numb you get and
[14:54] you forget the reason why you wanted to
[14:56] say no to begin with
[14:58] and
[15:00] there's a kind of a principle that i
[15:02] have maybe used in our my own life or
[15:05] even with my families if they need to
[15:06] know now the answer is no
[15:09] like if you're not gonna be given a
[15:10] chance to pray about it if you're not
[15:12] going to be given an opportunity to
[15:13] weigh
[15:14] uh you know the pros and cons of
[15:16] something if there's pressure i need an
[15:18] answer now i need an answer now then you
[15:20] just remain as you are
[15:22] uh you you don't have to feel that
[15:23] pressure that you have to commit and
[15:25] make a decision
[15:26] if somebody's asking you to say yes to
[15:28] something and they need to know right
[15:30] now then sometimes the best answer is no
[15:32] if you need to know now the answer is no
[15:34] because to
[15:36] to commit and to act against your
[15:38] conscience is going to wound your spirit
[15:41] and some examples of this in proverbs
[15:42] chapter 15 verse 4 it says a wholesome
[15:45] tongue is a tree of life
[15:47] but perverseness therein is a breach in
[15:49] the spirit
[15:51] this the the perverseness therein so
[15:54] it's it's bringing the
[15:55] contrary to a wholesome tongue a
[15:57] wholesome tongue is something that's
[15:59] healthy and something that's encouraging
[16:02] uh something that lifts up a wholesome
[16:03] tongue is a tree of life it's a source
[16:05] of virtue it's a source of strength but
[16:07] perverseness therein perverseness in the
[16:09] tongue
[16:10] and the word that's used in terms of
[16:12] perverseness therein it speaks of words
[16:14] that overwhelm you
[16:17] words that depress you
[16:19] words that make you anxious so there's a
[16:21] way of speaking that is a tree of life
[16:23] that's encouraging invigorating but a
[16:25] perverseness in speech is a breach or a
[16:28] wound in the spirit
[16:30] the proverb is actually just saying hey
[16:32] there's things that you can say that are
[16:33] appropriate and if the appropriate word
[16:35] words fitly spoken are our health and
[16:38] their life and their in their in when
[16:40] they're in the right season in the right
[16:42] context and for the right reason man
[16:44] it's just life in your bones it's
[16:46] invigorating it gives you energy it
[16:47] gives you strength it gives you courage
[16:49] it's appropriate you're saying
[16:51] appropriate things versus inappropriate
[16:53] things something that's inappropriate
[16:55] encourages you something inappropriate
[16:57] discourages you and uses the phrase a
[16:59] breach in the spirit
[17:01] so there's things that are healthy the
[17:02] right kind of speech is healthy but then
[17:04] the wrong kind of speech is harming
[17:07] so we cannot subject ourselves to things
[17:11] that are unhealthy and think that
[17:13] there's not a breach or a wound to some
[17:16] extent
[17:18] in proverbs chapter 12 verse 18 there is
[17:20] that speaketh
[17:22] like the piercings of a sword
[17:25] amen to that right you've heard words
[17:27] you've heard sayings you've heard
[17:28] comments before that are just kind of
[17:30] maybe at best caddy but really at the
[17:32] end of the day kind of really pointed
[17:34] you're trying to be very very sharp
[17:35] trying to hurt they're kind of aimed at
[17:37] a way to pierce you to wound your spirit
[17:40] so there's a way that can be uh the way
[17:42] that we can speak that is the piercing
[17:44] the thrust the stab it's a wounding of a
[17:47] sword but the tongue of the wise is
[17:49] health
[17:51] what is the bible doing the bible is
[17:52] telling us and making us wise to
[17:54] breaches or trespasses and offenses
[17:57] this is this is not behavioral science
[17:59] this is not psychology this is the bible
[18:02] saying that this is human nature this is
[18:05] the way that your body and spirit are
[18:06] made and this is the way that humans act
[18:09] and that we can all relate to this that
[18:11] there's a way that we can talk that
[18:13] encourages somebody there's talk that we
[18:15] can listen to that discourages us and
[18:18] there's words and sayings and mannerisms
[18:20] and way people can behave that pierces
[18:22] us it wounds our spirit we can walk away
[18:24] feeling like that didn't feel good and
[18:26] that wasn't said right and i i'm sure we
[18:29] can all recall situations where somebody
[18:30] kind of just makes a comment and then
[18:32] it's kind of a delayed reaction you're
[18:34] kind of walking away and you're like
[18:35] wait a minute
[18:37] that hurt
[18:39] that wasn't that wasn't very nice and it
[18:42] was maybe even meant that way it was
[18:43] intended that way and the bible is
[18:45] saying hey there there are trespasses
[18:47] against our spirits there are wounds a
[18:49] breach in our spirit that we have to we
[18:52] we need to be conscious of and why would
[18:54] it tell us this
[18:56] why would the bible tell us that there's
[18:58] a perverseness in in the tongue that's a
[19:00] breach in the spirit why would it tell
[19:02] us that there's a way of speaking that
[19:04] that pierces like a sword
[19:06] so that we could avoid speaking that way
[19:09] and we could avoid being spoken to that
[19:11] way
[19:14] the bible says in matthew chapter 7
[19:15] verse 12 therefore all things whatsoever
[19:18] you would do that men that
[19:20] ye would do that men should do to you do
[19:22] ye even so to them
[19:25] do unto others as you would have them do
[19:26] unto you i need to treat somebody else
[19:30] the way that i would want that person to
[19:32] treat me for this is the law and the
[19:34] prophets
[19:36] as somebody shared with me i think we
[19:38] were talking about the platinum rule but
[19:39] maybe the uh
[19:40] uh
[19:41] the fool's gold rule would be
[19:44] do unto others before they do unto you
[19:47] i think that's what somebody mentioned
[19:49] i've heard that one before i've
[19:51] experienced that one before
[19:54] but he says this is the law and the
[19:56] prophets
[19:57] this sums it all up
[19:59] that even the way that he says it here
[20:01] do unto others as you would have them do
[20:02] unto you or love thy neighbor as thyself
[20:05] as we'll come to here in a little bit is
[20:07] actually embodying the cons of the truth
[20:10] and the command to love the lord thy god
[20:12] with all you are your heart soul and
[20:14] mind that to love god with everything is
[20:16] going to be manifest and expressed in
[20:18] loving thy neighbor as thyself or doing
[20:20] to others as you would have them to do
[20:22] unto you
[20:24] and so we will treat others in a manner
[20:26] that we believe that we ought to be
[20:28] treated
[20:30] and this can signal either a positive
[20:32] attitude or a negative attitude
[20:34] because we can allow ourselves to be
[20:36] hurt because we don't view ourselves in
[20:38] a healthy way
[20:39] we can allow ourselves to be spoken to
[20:41] in a way that is very sharp we can allow
[20:43] ourselves to experience many different
[20:45] breaches in our spirit because on some
[20:47] level we may not view ourselves as
[20:50] as worthy of protecting and that well i
[20:53] just have to be able to put up with it
[20:54] and i don't feel like i can say no
[20:56] whatever that pressure might be but then
[20:57] there's also a sense in which we may
[20:59] endure hurts because we abuse others and
[21:02] we think that kind of conduct is
[21:04] appropriate or justified
[21:06] i know there's a lot of different ways
[21:07] we could think about this but if the
[21:09] bible's saying to do unto others as you
[21:10] would have them to do unto you you have
[21:12] to be you have to have a healthy view of
[21:15] how you want people to treat you
[21:18] and and if you mistreat other people
[21:20] you might find a way of always
[21:22] justifying that so that you would
[21:24] justify if they treated you the same way
[21:27] well they're doing they're i do do it to
[21:29] them they do it to me this is just the
[21:31] way that we are maybe you just blame it
[21:32] on your last name well that's just we're
[21:34] family this is just the way we are there
[21:36] might be a way that you conduct yourself
[21:38] because you think this is the way you
[21:40] ought to be this is the way you would
[21:41] treat somebody else so they have every
[21:43] right to treat you that way or in
[21:44] another sense you may just feel that you
[21:46] deserve it and i would never do that to
[21:48] somebody else but maybe i deserve it and
[21:50] that's not having a very healthy view of
[21:52] yourself
[21:53] i've noticed this maybe in my own life
[21:56] that
[21:57] um
[21:58] there's a that can have maybe a just a
[22:00] uh whether you say maybe a private
[22:02] nature or selfish nature it may be more
[22:04] appropriate to say that
[22:06] and because i may be reluctant um
[22:09] is this therapy
[22:10] no because um
[22:12] because i may be reluctant to to share
[22:15] i find that i'm also reluctant to have
[22:17] somebody share with me
[22:19] this is what it used to be years ago
[22:22] that and thank god god gave me a very
[22:24] unselfish wife
[22:25] but there's uh you find if you wouldn't
[22:27] let somebody borrow something from you
[22:29] guess what you're probably you know in a
[22:31] healthy way
[22:33] wouldn't ask to borrow from somebody
[22:34] else right
[22:37] now where the narcissist comes in is
[22:38] they would never let you borrow anything
[22:40] from them but they'll ask you for
[22:41] everything
[22:43] but uh there's there's this and i'm just
[22:45] wanting to relate to how sometimes the
[22:46] way we think hinders us because we think
[22:49] well i would never let somebody else
[22:51] have and i would never share i would
[22:52] never ask so then where or i would never
[22:55] give so then you never ask
[22:57] and it's limiting it's holding you back
[22:59] i know there's that was maybe a mouthful
[23:01] i appreciate you let me share it
[23:03] but i want you to be thinking about this
[23:05] in the scripture way that the bible's
[23:06] showing this to us
[23:08] now
[23:09] in second corinthians chapter 9 verses 6
[23:12] to 7
[23:13] verses 6 6 and 7
[23:16] this might seem to be a little bit of a
[23:18] leap but bear in mind what we're talking
[23:20] about how there's this a way of speaking
[23:22] that is a confrontational and it's a
[23:24] breach it's a wound
[23:27] and and feeling this pressure this
[23:29] conflict
[23:30] paul says but this i say he which soweth
[23:33] sparingly shall reap also sparingly and
[23:35] he which soweth bountifully shall reap
[23:37] also bountifully this is a principle of
[23:39] you reap what you sow and if you're
[23:41] going to sow a little you're going to
[23:42] get back a little if you sow a lot
[23:44] you're going to get back a lot so there
[23:46] is a direct connection
[23:48] of what you get in life to what you're
[23:50] giving
[23:51] there's a connection to what you're
[23:53] which are what you're harvesting to what
[23:54] you're sowing so our conduct and the way
[23:56] that we approach life and the way that
[23:58] we approach other people and what we get
[24:00] out of people is sometimes what we're
[24:02] sowing into them and i say this now
[24:05] because i realize that i'm going to i'm
[24:08] i'm going to be getting into this area
[24:09] and i may not mention it but in a lot of
[24:12] ways we could view ourselves that all of
[24:13] us uh we're going we saw and what we saw
[24:16] we get back and god designed god
[24:19] designed relationships in the beginning
[24:21] that whatever whatever was sown into the
[24:22] woman she was going to produce
[24:25] and it's a characteristic still exists
[24:27] today that if you if you sow frustration
[24:29] you're so hurt you sow certain things
[24:31] into your wife guess what you're going
[24:32] to get right back out because she's
[24:33] designed that way it's so it's the way
[24:35] that god has made even our spirits as a
[24:37] bed and ground
[24:38] and paul is is touching on you have
[24:40] control you have a large control over
[24:43] what you sow therefore you have you have
[24:45] control over what you're receiving
[24:48] and then he says every man according
[24:51] as he
[24:52] purposeth in his heart so let him give
[24:56] now now this is
[24:57] you if you want to give sparingly you're
[25:00] going to reap sparingly if you give
[25:01] bountifully you're going to reap
[25:02] bountifully but then so what he says is
[25:04] not so then you have to sow bountifully
[25:07] he says but let every man as he deems
[25:09] reasonable within himself in this
[25:11] autonomy within himself as he purposes
[25:13] in his heart let him give give according
[25:16] to what is in your heart and then he
[25:18] says not grudgingly or of necessity for
[25:21] god loveth a cheerful giver
[25:24] it's not just giving but how cheerful
[25:26] you are when you give remember how the
[25:29] scripture says that love is not indecent
[25:31] does not behave itself unseemingly and
[25:34] so there's a d the love will always
[25:36] behave itself decently it'll always
[25:38] behave in an appropriate way it will
[25:40] never be inappropriate it'll never be
[25:42] excessive it'll always just be just
[25:44] exactly right and it's saying that love
[25:46] in not behaving unseemly is not
[25:48] disrespectful it's
[25:50] i mean when you look at the word and
[25:51] what the greek is trying to express to
[25:53] us in the context of how paul said he
[25:55] says love is not disrespectful
[25:58] and and this is so then this is speaking
[26:01] to
[26:02] the appropriateness of how one ought to
[26:05] uh and i the scripture that comes to
[26:07] mind is
[26:08] that the love of god is expressed in
[26:10] that we would keep his commandments if
[26:11] you love me keep my commandments and in
[26:14] the keeping of the commandments it's not
[26:16] grievous
[26:17] and that would demonstrate a real love i
[26:19] i want to why would you do that i want
[26:20] to do it because i love them i want to
[26:22] do this because i love to do this it's
[26:24] not a detriment it's not a mark it's not
[26:27] a curse to somebody and so it's
[26:29] something that is appropriate not
[26:30] forceful
[26:32] and when paul says let every man give as
[26:34] is in his heart not grudgingly or of
[26:36] necessity don't give through a heaviness
[26:40] don't get don't give through a pain
[26:41] though there may be some sacrifice
[26:44] and you may be not giving from abundance
[26:46] but giving from what you have is a
[26:47] little and it may be something that is
[26:49] felt you shouldn't be giving through
[26:50] this grudgerly and it's a pain and this
[26:53] is a heaviness to where i i'm going to
[26:55] do it but it's a there's a price in your
[26:58] spirit
[26:59] does that make sense
[27:00] that you can you do it but if you give
[27:02] it if you give it begrudgingly and we
[27:04] we've been in that situation before
[27:06] where we ask for something and it's kind
[27:08] of like well fine you could have it
[27:09] we're like never mind
[27:11] i don't think i want it under those
[27:13] under that pretense because it's not
[27:15] going to be healthy going forward so
[27:17] he's he's identifying that those kind of
[27:18] emotions don't give through a heaviness
[27:20] or a pain and then he says or of
[27:22] necessity
[27:25] and even grudgingly sp speaks this don't
[27:27] give because it's imposed or forced on
[27:30] you
[27:31] because of necessity it means to be
[27:32] taken advantage of don't give through
[27:34] coercion or influence don't give because
[27:37] you've been made to feel obligated
[27:39] well i guess i'll give bountifully
[27:41] because paul said if i don't give
[27:42] bountifully i'm gonna i'm not gonna reap
[27:44] bountifully no you're missing it
[27:47] paul says if you give a little you'll
[27:48] you'll reap a little if you give a lot
[27:50] you'll reap a lot he's just telling you
[27:51] the principle you choose how you want to
[27:53] reap
[27:54] you choose how you want to sew it's
[27:56] completely within your control and it's
[27:57] like well but if you put it that way i
[27:59] feel like i have no choice no you
[28:00] absolutely do have a choice
[28:02] you give as you were able to in your
[28:04] heart and don't do it grudgingly don't
[28:07] give it of necessity this of necessity
[28:09] means don't give it because you're being
[28:10] taken advantage of and you're being
[28:12] coerced and you're being forced now if
[28:14] you want to say well this has to do with
[28:15] uh giving to the church this has to do
[28:18] with any service
[28:20] this has to do with any kind of offering
[28:21] any kind of giving anything that you
[28:23] would if you want to say this relates to
[28:25] any expression of the of love language
[28:27] this gives this it has to do with any
[28:29] sacrifice or any offering any time being
[28:32] spent anyway it even relates to how that
[28:34] we would serve god he has not wanted us
[28:37] to serve god because we've been
[28:38] manipulated or coerced or made to feel
[28:41] obligated
[28:44] don't give through this pain now this is
[28:46] a breach this is hurting me i don't want
[28:48] to do it i feel like i can't say no
[28:49] don't do because it's forced or you're
[28:52] being coerced the word the languages
[28:53] being of course are made to feel
[28:56] obligated peter refers to this kind of
[28:59] feeling in first peter chapter five
[29:01] verse two
[29:02] he's speaking to a shepherd feed the
[29:04] flock of god which is among you taking
[29:06] the oversight thereof
[29:08] and that's quite a task
[29:10] to to feed the flock of god which is
[29:12] among you and take oversight thereof you
[29:14] can take responsibility watch out for
[29:15] their souls but then he says not by
[29:17] constraint but willingly
[29:20] not for filthy luker but of a ready mind
[29:22] but that phrase not by constraint but of
[29:25] a ready mind
[29:26] but willingly of a ready mind not by
[29:28] constrainer by filthy luker it's almost
[29:30] like it takes these these these
[29:32] opposites and says you shouldn't have to
[29:34] do it by constraint or for money but you
[29:36] should be doing it willingly and of a
[29:38] ready mind
[29:39] and he's attacked
[29:41] these uh mechanisms within the mind of
[29:43] men that can be very very detrimental
[29:45] and very corrosive uh to leadership into
[29:48] the way that uh the way that they feel
[29:50] about their calling and how that they're
[29:51] serving because he's saying that a
[29:53] pastor should not be pastoring because
[29:56] he feels obligated to do it
[29:58] by constraint
[30:00] and the sense that well god is binding
[30:02] me here and if he could if he told me
[30:04] right now it's my choice i could leave
[30:05] i'd be out of here
[30:07] and the doors would just be
[30:09] as i you just beat i'm i'm out of here
[30:11] i'm gone i'm not gonna have a thought
[30:12] about you that's he said that's the
[30:14] wrong that's the wrong place to be as a
[30:17] pastor that you feel like you're there
[30:19] because god called you to it you're
[30:20] forced to do it and so he's touched on
[30:23] this i feel obligated to do it i i have
[30:25] to do this it's it's by constraint and
[30:27] instead of there being a willingness
[30:29] that god's called me to this and i'm
[30:31] willing to do this i'm happy to do this
[30:33] and if he was to all of a sudden tell me
[30:34] i can't do this there'd be some sense of
[30:36] loss there'd be some sense of a passion
[30:39] and zeal and enthusiasm that i have for
[30:40] this calling that there'd be an
[30:42] emptiness and so he's dealing with force
[30:46] we ought not to give
[30:48] out of force we ought to be
[30:50] to give in the sense that i feel like
[30:52] i'm being taken advantage of i'm being
[30:53] manipulated into this and peter's
[30:55] talking about hey you shouldn't pastor
[30:58] out of being forced to do it but you
[31:00] should have a willingness and a ready
[31:01] mind
[31:02] because the truth is we never i i don't
[31:05] care who you are be honest real talk we
[31:07] never want to be forced to do something
[31:09] we don't want to do
[31:13] we never want to
[31:14] be forced to do something that's against
[31:16] our will
[31:18] we don't want to be forced to do
[31:20] something that's against our that we're
[31:22] not comfortable with now you might play
[31:24] briar rabbit oh please don't throw me in
[31:26] the briar patch please please please but
[31:28] that's home you like that
[31:30] there there's so it's an honesty how we
[31:32] do we don't like to be forced to do
[31:34] something we're not comfortable with we
[31:35] don't like to be asked to do something
[31:37] that that
[31:38] i'm feeling i i feel like the forces
[31:40] that are acting to cause me to do this
[31:42] are more manipulating uh uh the good
[31:45] it's manipulating my sincerity it's
[31:48] manipulating my willingness it's
[31:49] manipulating even my gifts or my
[31:51] abilities as opposed to really
[31:53] motivating me to do it
[31:55] because there's a way that you can
[31:57] there's a way that you can be inspired
[31:59] to do something that's very healthy and
[32:00] someone asks you to do something and
[32:02] maybe you don't initially want to do it
[32:03] but there's a way that you can be
[32:04] approached where something turns in your
[32:06] heart like you know what initially i
[32:08] didn't want to but now i kind of see
[32:10] that this is what the lord wants me to
[32:11] do i kind of see that this will be
[32:13] healthy this will be good for my family
[32:14] or this is a wonderful opportunity and
[32:17] and things turn and it's not because
[32:19] you've been manipulated or somebody has
[32:20] used psychology on you but the right
[32:23] approach has motivated you to exercise a
[32:25] gift to give and to free yourself and to
[32:28] be used for a particular purpose and
[32:30] that's healthy because in the end
[32:32] there's a reward for that
[32:34] but if you find yourself in conflict and
[32:36] you're feeling that there's some sort of
[32:37] coercion and there's force that's
[32:39] manipulation
[32:40] and you get your arm twisted and you do
[32:42] it you're not going to feel good in the
[32:43] end
[32:45] even if the job's done and it's done
[32:46] well in the end it's not going to leave
[32:48] a good taste in your mouth
[32:52] so what is the bible
[32:55] recognizing
[32:56] force the use of force to accomplish
[32:59] something
[32:59] which i guess i i could say just to make
[33:02] my title more relevant that's
[33:03] disrespectful
[33:05] that's not showing respect there's even
[33:07] a way that we can sometimes try to force
[33:09] our children to do things that's not
[33:10] respecting them as a person
[33:13] i i found one time i was i had this
[33:15] sense of being very uncomfortable
[33:17] seeing kids being forced to hug people
[33:19] they didn't know
[33:21] i started thinking that's kind of weird
[33:23] i mean like what if you ask me right now
[33:24] brother aaron go go hug that person like
[33:26] really
[33:28] it's kind of this awkward dance i don't
[33:30] know if this happens for sisters but
[33:31] sometimes you realize brothers are kind
[33:33] of sizing each other up do i go in for
[33:34] the hug what do i do because you don't
[33:36] want to offend somebody right like come
[33:38] over here brother bring it in
[33:40] and they're kind of like whoa you know
[33:41] hold on covet 19. and so there's always
[33:44] this really odd thing where you're
[33:45] shaking one person you're reading their
[33:47] body language i don't think they want to
[33:48] hug and then the next guy can like i
[33:50] want to you know and you're hugging this
[33:51] guy and you didn't hug that guy and you
[33:52] kind of feel awkward like well come here
[33:56] and it's like no brother you read it
[33:58] right the first time
[34:01] and so there's a
[34:06] you know what i was talking about
[34:08] bring them in oh wait want to take the
[34:10] name of jesus with you where are we
[34:15] it's a it's the idea of of being forced
[34:18] to do something and how that that we
[34:21] have to be very conscious of what is
[34:23] respectful
[34:25] and there's a way that we feel that we
[34:26] have authority over our children
[34:28] therefore we can ask them to do things
[34:30] by our authority
[34:32] but we could be disrespecting their
[34:34] autonomy
[34:35] we could be disrespecting their sense of
[34:37] personal we could be disrespecting what
[34:38] they're comfortable with and sometimes
[34:40] we want to try to force something and
[34:42] and
[34:43] we immediately can begin to recognize
[34:44] when it's pride like you feel shamed or
[34:47] embarrassed and so you want to force
[34:48] something we have to be very sensitive
[34:50] because it is an issue of respect
[34:53] and that is something that i've
[34:54] mentioned before and this is what i want
[34:56] to uh emphasize in this statement that
[34:58] i'm going to take from the church age
[34:59] book
[35:00] is that love has to be
[35:02] love which is the word of god has to be
[35:04] what's motivating us this
[35:06] zealousness to fulfill god's purpose
[35:08] this desire to to lift up the word of
[35:11] god to
[35:12] be very uh zealous to defend his
[35:15] character that's love
[35:17] that's the that's the what's embodied in
[35:20] in agape love is it's it's connected
[35:22] with the word of god so when we act even
[35:25] if it's to teach even if it's true
[35:27] discipline even if it is to inform or
[35:30] correct
[35:32] we are not correcting from and we're not
[35:34] teaching from the position that we're
[35:36] right or we have the authority
[35:39] but that there's something in the word
[35:40] there's some benefit in the word of god
[35:42] that we're we're lifting up there's some
[35:44] principle in the word of god that we're
[35:46] being advocates for on behalf of the
[35:49] other person not merely just doing it
[35:50] because this is right and since it's
[35:52] right uh uh then it would it i can use
[35:56] might
[35:57] and i can use force and i can use
[35:59] manipulation because at the end of the
[36:00] day it's the word of god that i'm i'm
[36:02] i'm serving that's that's wrong
[36:05] and brother branham this is uh this is
[36:07] real dense language to read very heavy
[36:09] language to read
[36:11] but notice just this thought that
[36:12] unfolds in the church age book chapter
[36:14] five once the nice council had swung the
[36:17] power of political rome to the church
[36:19] it seemed that there that there were no
[36:21] limits to which this first christian
[36:23] church would go
[36:25] the name christian now this is the
[36:28] this is the the change because now the
[36:30] first christian church is a combination
[36:33] of political power and church power
[36:34] ecclesiastical power so it's not like
[36:36] the first church on the day of pentecost
[36:39] this is the the evolution of the
[36:41] antichrist the name christian which
[36:43] originally brought persecution
[36:45] now became the name of the persecutors
[36:50] when you come across a lot of
[36:52] regions or
[36:53] cultures that despise christianity it's
[36:56] because they've experienced it
[36:58] from a different perspective
[37:00] and
[37:01] this is very interesting when you
[37:04] study it historically to the pagans and
[37:07] to the heathens
[37:09] it didn't bother them at all that you
[37:10] worship jesus christ
[37:13] why because they worship deities
[37:16] didn't bother them that you worshiped
[37:17] god the one true god because they
[37:19] worshiped all different kinds of god
[37:21] where the conflict began
[37:24] is not in the fact that christians
[37:26] worshiped other another god but that the
[37:28] christians were intolerant
[37:30] of the pagans
[37:33] and it was the christian's intolerance
[37:35] and the persecution of the pagan that
[37:38] caused
[37:39] the response
[37:41] from the non-believers
[37:43] did you realize that historically
[37:45] because there's this is what this is
[37:47] kind of the evolution and then the
[37:48] christian church became the persecutor
[37:51] it was in the age that augustine of
[37:53] hippo set forth the precept that the
[37:55] church ought and must think about this
[37:58] ought and must use force if necessary to
[38:02] bring her children back into the fold
[38:05] and that it was in harmony with the word
[38:07] of god to kill the heretics and
[38:09] apostates
[38:11] this is a this is an incredible shift
[38:14] in christianity
[38:16] and and i'd say these shadows still
[38:19] there's still these shadows within
[38:21] christianity today
[38:23] that though we may not burn somebody at
[38:25] the stake but there's these instincts
[38:27] that exist within christianity today
[38:29] that we can use force if necessary
[38:31] whether it be political pressure social
[38:33] pressure ostracization
[38:36] shaming that all these things are at our
[38:38] disposal to use force if necessary to
[38:40] bring children back into the fold or
[38:42] keep them in the fold and to justify it
[38:44] by saying this is in harmony with the
[38:46] word of god to kill
[38:48] to assassinate someone's character who
[38:50] we deem to be a heretic or apostate
[38:54] in his controversy with the
[38:57] donatist he wrote
[38:59] this is now and i believe i've
[39:00] italicized it so we would recognize this
[39:02] as somebody else's writing it is indeed
[39:05] better that men should be led to worship
[39:06] god by teaching
[39:08] than that they should be driven to it by
[39:10] fear of punishment or pain
[39:12] amen
[39:13] yes i love that approach teaching
[39:16] being the motivating factor and driving
[39:18] someone to worship god than to be driven
[39:20] to it by fear of punishment or pain but
[39:25] and this is a that's a very very uh
[39:28] anonymous but
[39:30] but it does not fall that because the
[39:31] former course produces the better men
[39:34] therefore those who do not yield to it
[39:36] should be neglected
[39:38] see what he's saying
[39:40] teaching's the best way and teaching
[39:41] produces better men but if there are
[39:43] those who cannot be taught it does not
[39:46] mean that they should be neglected we
[39:48] should resort to other means to get
[39:50] those who cannot be taught to toe the
[39:52] line
[39:54] if you're not going to do it by what's
[39:56] being said and what's being taught
[39:57] what's being preached we'll find other
[39:59] ways to do it
[40:01] and they're called deacons
[40:06] you laugh but i know churches where
[40:07] deacons would take young men out into
[40:09] the shed and beat them in the message
[40:15] they may not use fist anymore but
[40:16] they'll use their words
[40:18] for many have found advantage as we have
[40:20] proved in our daily proving by actual
[40:22] experience
[40:23] in being first compelled by fear or pain
[40:26] we have found advantage we have found
[40:28] and we are experiencing this on a daily
[40:30] basis
[40:31] just how fruitful our use of fear and
[40:33] pain are in turning the reprobate and
[40:34] even into real christians
[40:37] so that they might afterwards be
[40:38] influenced by teaching so that they
[40:40] might follow out and act
[40:42] what they have already learned in word
[40:43] whilst those are better who are guided
[40:45] or right by love
[40:48] those are certainly more numerous who
[40:50] are corrected by fear
[40:52] i i think they wrote it without any
[40:54] sense of irony at all without any sense
[40:56] of
[40:56] they're going to think this is the
[40:57] babylon bee when they they unearth this
[41:01] i mean this is not satire he's as
[41:03] serious as can be
[41:05] that yes teaching would be the best
[41:06] motivator and a lot teaching produces
[41:09] the better men and love those who are
[41:10] guided by love
[41:12] they are the better but
[41:14] certainly there's more in number who are
[41:16] corrected by fear
[41:18] but then he says for who can possibly
[41:20] love us more than christ who laid down
[41:22] his life for the sheep and this is a
[41:24] trap
[41:25] right because then you're thinking yes
[41:26] christ he he was self-sacrificial and he
[41:29] was willing to yield himself and he
[41:32] humbled himself and so he says you had
[41:34] to after calling peter and the other
[41:36] apostles by his words alone when he came
[41:38] to summon paul he not only constrained
[41:40] him with his voice but even dashed him
[41:42] to the earth with his power that he
[41:44] might forcibly bring one who is raging
[41:46] amidst the darkness of infidelity to
[41:48] desire the light of the heart he first
[41:50] struck him with the physical blindness
[41:52] of the eyes
[41:53] why therefore should not the church use
[41:55] force in compelling her lost sons to
[41:56] return
[42:00] this is how immediately it changed from
[42:01] the love of christ no greater love hath
[42:04] the man that he laid down his life for
[42:05] his friends and here's the love of
[42:07] christ expressed in being the sacrifice
[42:09] and being the lamb and he says but
[42:11] remember after he used words to compel
[42:13] his disciples to follow and they
[42:15] summoned them then when it came to
[42:16] dealing with paul he dashed him to the
[42:18] earth he smote him blind he was he
[42:21] struck him with physical blindness he
[42:24] used force to bring uh to strike against
[42:27] the raging darkness to that his heart
[42:29] would desire light
[42:31] and he says so then why should not the
[42:34] church use force
[42:35] in compelling her lost sons to return
[42:39] and again with no sense of recognizing
[42:42] that christ
[42:44] as the sacrifice could do that
[42:47] christ as having first been the lamb has
[42:50] the authority to be the lion
[42:52] and that without any sense of being
[42:54] self-sacrificial without any sense of
[42:56] being perfect in the knowledge and the
[42:58] character of christ we're just going to
[43:00] try to fit this mode of bashing people
[43:02] and dashing them and making them feel
[43:05] the pain
[43:06] and be scared
[43:08] in the darkness to then seek the
[43:10] light he said the lord himself said go
[43:13] out into the highways and hedges and
[43:14] compel them to come in wherefore if the
[43:16] power which the church has received by
[43:19] divine appointment in its due season
[43:20] through the religious character and
[43:22] faith of kings be the instrument by
[43:24] which those who are found in the
[43:25] highways and hedges that is in heresies
[43:28] and schisms are compelled to come in
[43:30] then let them not find fault with being
[43:32] compelled
[43:35] and in other words let them not find
[43:37] fault with force being used to convert
[43:39] somebody
[43:41] the inquisition and even the spread of
[43:43] christianity under the guy under the
[43:45] power of the catholic church
[43:47] even in where we're living right now in
[43:49] this state
[43:50] you had those explorers who found
[43:53] themselves
[43:54] found indian tribes who did not know of
[43:56] jesus christ did not know and one true
[43:58] god who there's an ultimatum given you
[44:01] must worship jesus christ you must
[44:03] accept the one true god or will commit
[44:05] genocide
[44:07] in the name of christianity
[44:11] and this is how they approached it this
[44:13] and they justified it feeling that we
[44:16] have every right
[44:18] to use force
[44:20] to accomplish something
[44:24] now that's the extreme
[44:27] think about all the other subtle ways
[44:30] this
[44:31] this uh
[44:33] this kind of dynamic can exist within
[44:35] our hearts
[44:38] this is the worst instinct of leadership
[44:40] this is really the worst characteristic
[44:41] of a church is to control by fear
[44:44] because it's the opposite of faith
[44:47] but the worst thing you could do is to
[44:48] compel by force paul and even trying to
[44:50] lift up how important it would be to
[44:52] exhibit a certain characteristic says
[44:54] but still nonetheless it has to be in
[44:56] your heart to do it because in the end
[44:58] you can't do it grudgingly you can't do
[44:59] it of necessity otherwise it's not going
[45:01] to resonate with god and produce the
[45:03] benefit that you would like to for
[45:05] others
[45:06] or even for yourself
[45:08] if somebody does something for you and
[45:10] maybe i often joke when someone says
[45:11] brother aaron thank you so much for
[45:13] doing this it really means a lot to us
[45:14] and i always i kind of joke and say well
[45:16] i felt like i had to and and i do it
[45:18] jokingly i hope nobody's ever taken me
[45:20] serious with that before because you
[45:22] know that in saying that it kind of
[45:24] ruins the whole thing
[45:25] or they felt like they had to well i
[45:27] felt like you expected it i felt like
[45:28] you needed it or you wouldn't be my
[45:30] friend immediately it's kind of like
[45:30] well wait a minute that means nothing
[45:32] anymore
[45:33] and so that's the the beneficiary of it
[45:36] is robbed and you're robbed too
[45:40] because how you're going to have the
[45:41] wrong kind of pride that says well did
[45:42] you hear what i did the other day
[45:46] and there's going to be this sense of
[45:47] seeking your own glory that kind of
[45:48] honey is going to make your stomach sick
[45:51] and so it's the worst it's the these are
[45:53] kind of the worst dynamics that can work
[45:54] upon a person to do something
[45:57] and and i want to identify this it's
[45:59] very subtle now how this force works
[46:03] very subtle how these and these um
[46:06] attributes of abuse can continue to work
[46:08] within the frameworks of organizations
[46:10] or or families or relationships or
[46:12] churches they may not be calling you out
[46:15] as a heretic
[46:16] or apostate or reprobate and threatening
[46:19] to burn you at the stake but there can
[46:22] be this very overt pressure that works
[46:25] in the same way to not teach out of love
[46:29] but to compel by force and fear
[46:34] and galatians chapter 5 verses 13 to 15.
[46:42] i i sense a
[46:45] a real
[46:47] uh appetite for the word of god today
[46:49] just by the look upon your face
[46:51] your faces are indicating you're
[46:52] listening and i appreciate that very
[46:54] much
[46:55] in galatians chapter 5 verses 13 14 and
[46:57] 15 and i recognize the matter is unique
[47:00] and even the manner is unique so i
[47:02] appreciate your diligence this morning
[47:04] in galatians chapter 5 verses 13 14 and
[47:07] 15 for brethren ye have been called unto
[47:09] liberty only used not liberty for an
[47:12] occasion to the flesh but by love serve
[47:15] one another i wonder what
[47:17] augustine the hippo would say about that
[47:20] i wonder where this scripture
[47:23] fit into his paradigm
[47:25] that you have been called unto liberty
[47:27] so we have this liberty we have this
[47:29] freedom but don't use your liberty as
[47:31] for an occasion to the flesh now
[47:34] the the correct instinct is to think
[47:36] about lasciviousness or this license
[47:38] where i'm free in christ therefore i can
[47:40] do anything i want but it it's more than
[47:43] that
[47:44] it speaks to a
[47:47] i say it's more than that it's not
[47:49] better than that but that
[47:50] includes behavior
[47:53] that we justify because we're free
[47:56] or because we have we sense this liberty
[47:58] to do it he says but then
[48:00] moderate your liberty moderate your
[48:02] freedom by this tenet
[48:05] through love serve one another
[48:07] that man i am free to do whatever i want
[48:10] i am absolutely free but what becomes
[48:12] the the boundary to that action what
[48:15] becomes the boundary that activity is
[48:17] how my conduct or my behavior affects
[48:20] somebody else
[48:22] she says my love serve one another for
[48:23] all the laws fulfilled in one word even
[48:25] this all the law upon this hangs all the
[48:28] law and the prophets for this is the law
[48:29] of the prophets do unto others as you
[48:31] would have them to do unto you this is
[48:32] all the law and the prophets hang on
[48:33] these two commandments love the lord thy
[48:35] god with everything you are and love thy
[48:37] neighbor as yourself because in this
[48:38] hangs all the law and the prophets and
[48:40] these two commandments are just like one
[48:42] another paul says it this way for all
[48:44] the laws fulfilled in one word one
[48:45] commandment this thou shalt love thy
[48:47] neighbor as thyself
[48:49] paul takes the words of christ and just
[48:51] even condenses it down further saying
[48:53] this sums it all up
[48:55] and immediately he says but if ye bite
[48:57] and devour one another take heed that
[49:00] you be not consumed one of another
[49:04] the galatian church as you read about
[49:05] their certain their circumstances and
[49:07] the things that paul's having to address
[49:08] you can see that they're in a constant
[49:09] state of distraction
[49:12] just this there's continual strife and
[49:13] contention there's always this some
[49:15] combating and fighting
[49:17] a drama as maybe we might use today
[49:20] there's a lot of drama in the galatian
[49:22] church
[49:23] and and paul's having to address it
[49:26] and he says that
[49:28] our liberty and i want i want to come
[49:30] back to this
[49:32] uh we've been called to liberty and we
[49:33] are free but in our freedom to almost
[49:36] live
[49:38] unencumbered
[49:40] we have to have this uh
[49:42] sensitivity
[49:44] to other people
[49:46] because we shouldn't use this liberty to
[49:48] serve ourselves to make ourselves feel
[49:50] good or merely lift ourselves up but we
[49:53] now being free we can kind of turn this
[49:56] freedom that christ has given us
[49:58] internalize it then express it out
[50:00] towards other people
[50:01] wanting them to experience the same
[50:03] internal liberty and freedom and
[50:04] deliverance we've experienced so it
[50:06] doesn't it does not translate to a
[50:08] selfishness i want to serve other people
[50:10] now he says because if you don't
[50:14] fulfill the word of god by loving your
[50:16] neighbor as you love yourself
[50:19] it's expressed in this biting and
[50:20] devouring and being consumed one another
[50:23] but you bite it means evil speaking you
[50:25] bite with these words these sharp words
[50:27] you bite one another and you devour it
[50:29] speaks of railing or clamor
[50:33] it's a
[50:35] it's a it's a stripe to rail it's to
[50:37] insult loudly
[50:40] clamor
[50:43] it's it it's
[50:45] it's it's this way of speaking to where
[50:48] the words are overwhelming the words are
[50:50] condescending it's biting you buy it you
[50:52] devour it's competitiveness
[50:55] what was it the over topping that we
[50:57] read in the scripture that there's this
[50:58] idea that if somebody says well i i
[51:00] walked a mile yesterday i said man
[51:02] that's great you don't walk at all
[51:03] that's awesome you walked a mile i'm
[51:05] proud of you kind of like oh well i ran
[51:07] eight miles
[51:08] backwards
[51:13] you know up the verado steps
[51:16] and down
[51:19] and it's kind of like oh
[51:21] yeah
[51:22] and the mile i got was you know at the
[51:24] zoo with my kids too so
[51:26] i feel really sheepish now
[51:29] it's just over top you bite you devour
[51:31] he says take heed did you not consume to
[51:33] one another it means
[51:34] you're consumed to the bitterness
[51:37] you're consumed by the strife all the
[51:38] contention all the fighting all the
[51:40] competitiveness all the force all the
[51:42] coercion just overwhelms you
[51:46] and i'm gonna leave this off for the um
[51:49] maybe for the next part of god would
[51:50] lead me to do it that there's a way that
[51:52] we begin to exist within that kind of
[51:54] dynamic to where you're either consumed
[51:56] by it and you assimilate and become part
[51:57] of it or it destroys you
[52:00] you realize i either have to be i either
[52:02] have to step up
[52:03] my devouring game
[52:05] and i've got to really get good at
[52:06] biting
[52:07] or i'm going to be chewed up
[52:10] you either assimilate or you're
[52:11] destroyed by it
[52:13] you become subject to it and that's
[52:14] exactly what paul is saying because he's
[52:16] alluding to the the the idea of beast of
[52:18] prey falling upon one another and
[52:20] dividing one another
[52:22] ignor normally maybe a a beast of prey
[52:24] would find i would go after the sheep
[52:27] and devour the sheep but now it's kind
[52:29] of this illusion of a beast of prey
[52:31] falling upon another beast of prey and
[52:32] them devouring one another but even more
[52:34] odd as paul is saying that not only that
[52:37] though a beast would prey upon a sheep
[52:40] to devour them and maybe a prey could
[52:42] prey on another predator he's saying now
[52:44] the sheep are devouring each other
[52:48] and that makes no sense
[52:52] so verse 13 as i come back to it it just
[52:54] struck me
[52:56] how that paul
[52:57] is identifying this principle that we
[52:59] should never let our liberty lead to
[53:01] somebody else's bondage
[53:05] we should never let our liberty be
[53:07] expressed and our faith be expressed
[53:10] and our christianity be justified that
[53:13] there's i can act boldly but yet it's
[53:15] arrogantly i can act uh with authority
[53:18] but it's presumptuously there's a way
[53:19] that we begin to act where we're not
[53:21] really spreading the gospel we're not
[53:23] really putting footsteps to uh to uh the
[53:25] promised land we're acting
[53:27] disrespectfully we're acting
[53:28] belligerently we're acting a way to
[53:30] where it's an occasion for our flesh and
[53:33] not truly loving our loving our neighbor
[53:35] as ourselves
[53:39] never let your liberty become somebody
[53:40] else's bondage
[53:43] i ask the question
[53:45] just because we can should we
[53:49] just because we can should we in other
[53:52] words
[53:53] because i have the power and the ability
[53:54] to do it should i do it just because i
[53:56] can should i do it because i have the
[53:58] opportunity to do it
[54:00] should i take advantage of the
[54:01] opportunity just because i have the
[54:03] privilege i have the power i have the
[54:04] privilege i have the opportunity
[54:05] everything's at my disposal
[54:08] having the power having the privilege
[54:10] and now having the opportunity am i
[54:12] therefore justified in acting and i
[54:15] would reason no
[54:18] power privilege and opportunity are
[54:20] never the reasons why we would act
[54:23] we act because it's the right thing
[54:25] we act because it's appropriate
[54:31] in the jubilee year brother and i i'm
[54:33] using this
[54:34] as an example of this
[54:36] not just doing it because you can he
[54:38] says my friend you don't know how i love
[54:40] you you don't realize that when i'm he
[54:42] says and he pauses so there's a fragment
[54:44] here and he says that i don't try to
[54:46] scold you just because i stand in the
[54:48] pulpit
[54:49] i'd be taking advantage of you
[54:52] here's here's just a quick phrase that
[54:54] he uses to show that you don't realize
[54:57] that when i'm standing this pulpit and
[54:58] now this is the words of brother aaron
[55:00] now i say things that are hard and maybe
[55:02] i say things that are cutting
[55:04] and it might seem like i'm scolding you
[55:06] but i'm not just stan i'm not just
[55:09] saying it
[55:10] because i ca i can
[55:12] i'm not just saying it because i'm the
[55:14] pastor i'm not just saying it because
[55:15] it's right and it's truth and i'm not
[55:17] just saying it because you know the you
[55:19] come to the church this is the house of
[55:21] god and this is a house of correction
[55:23] this is a house judgment begins in the
[55:25] house of god everybody get ready to be
[55:26] slayed
[55:28] he said i don't do this because if i was
[55:30] doing it just for those reasons i'd be
[55:31] taking advantage of you
[55:33] you're a captive audience you're a
[55:34] sincere audience you're an audience that
[55:36] believes
[55:37] and this working of of men of god
[55:39] standing behind the pulpit and preaching
[55:41] the word of god you are in a willingness
[55:43] and through voluntary you're voluntarily
[55:45] this morning coming to sit in church to
[55:47] hear what i have to say there there is a
[55:50] vulnerability that exists
[55:52] you are coming as sheep to listen to
[55:55] another sheep today
[55:57] i'm a son of god just as you are a
[55:59] daughter of god or a son of god i have i
[56:01] have no greater position in in the grace
[56:04] and mercy of christ than any of you but
[56:06] then need god wanting to speak to you
[56:09] places a gift in someone's life and a
[56:10] calling in someone's life and that
[56:12] doesn't give them power over you to take
[56:15] advantage of you
[56:17] it creates this it creates this i want
[56:19] to say uneasiness but there has to be
[56:22] this recognition of vulnerability that
[56:23] you sit here today and i could take
[56:26] advantage of that and say things that
[56:28] can harm your spirit or mislead your
[56:31] zeal and enthusiasm
[56:33] and brother i'm saying man if i just
[56:35] stood up here and scolded you because i
[56:36] stand in the pulpit
[56:38] i'd be taking advantage of you
[56:41] it's this warning
[56:43] to don't take advantage of somebody
[56:46] he says in the six-fold purpose of
[56:47] gabriel's visit to daniel
[56:49] this is just another example so i'm
[56:52] using this as evidence and maybe it
[56:53] doesn't fit within the continuity of the
[56:55] thought but it's just used as a
[56:56] supplemental evidence the woman is a
[56:58] weaker vessel i know there can't be a
[57:00] bad man before there's a bad woman
[57:02] it's a heavy saying
[57:04] but men who knows that men who knows
[57:06] that you are son of god
[57:09] and take advantage of a woman's shame on
[57:11] you
[57:13] you know that a woman could a woman is
[57:14] the weaker vessel and you claim to be a
[57:16] son of god and you take advantage of the
[57:19] woman's weakness he says shame on you
[57:23] no matter what she does she's a weaker
[57:24] vessel and you know that
[57:26] and if she goes to act an unladylike
[57:28] take her by the hand and talk to her
[57:30] like a sister
[57:32] you're a son of god don't do them evil
[57:34] things
[57:36] now however it is you'd want to take
[57:38] the however the picture is painted to
[57:40] your heart to what brother branham is
[57:41] alluding to
[57:43] we we can all agree on this principle
[57:46] that he's saying that the woman is the
[57:47] weaker vessel and can be taken advantage
[57:49] of and as a christian man you should
[57:52] never
[57:53] take advantage of your power
[57:55] use your power to an advantage over a
[57:57] weaker vessel
[57:59] and this principle is is so striking to
[58:03] catch our attention your son of god you
[58:06] should never use your power never use
[58:08] your authority in a situation where
[58:10] somebody is vulnerable or weaker says
[58:12] that's wrong to do that
[58:15] and and it may be obvious in the way
[58:18] that he what he's alluding to that
[58:20] because you have the power you could
[58:21] take advantage of somebody who's not
[58:23] ladylike or somebody who may allow
[58:24] certain things to happen and there's
[58:26] this rebuke and he's scolding these men
[58:28] for doing these evil things but he takes
[58:30] the time to identify this imbalance of
[58:33] power that you you or knowingly taking
[58:36] advantage of somebody's vulnerability
[58:38] and how foul that is and how evil that
[58:40] is
[58:47] because it's
[58:48] in in the way that
[58:50] we might just recognize
[58:53] this an uh unholy woman
[58:56] and somebody taking advantage of an
[58:58] opportunity we might be able to just
[58:59] kind of look at that in the sense of oh
[59:01] well the the error is in what resulted
[59:04] but the air was in the approach to begin
[59:05] with
[59:06] there's an air in that let's not let's
[59:08] not look at the one side go oh well
[59:10] that's where that's where
[59:12] that's with a sin no the sin manifested
[59:14] in that you can back up and find where
[59:16] it began and the genesis was a lack of
[59:18] respect
[59:20] the genesis was not to appreciate the
[59:21] vulnerability of somebody the
[59:23] the the the genesis though it would it
[59:26] might manifest in conduct that's
[59:27] obviously lewd
[59:29] in what's been alluded to here it can
[59:31] manifest its place itself in ways that
[59:33] are much more subtle but be the same
[59:35] dynamic
[59:36] of a lack of respect for somebody else's
[59:38] boundaries a lack of respect for
[59:39] somebody else's sensitivities a lack of
[59:41] respect for somebody else's weakness and
[59:43] instead of lifting them up and
[59:44] encouraging them and treating them like
[59:46] a sister you treat them as a second
[59:48] class citizen
[59:51] it's very interesting where society is
[59:53] coming today
[59:54] with the
[59:57] uh i wanted to say advancements but i
[59:59] feel like we're crawling backwards
[1:00:01] uh in in terms of now through uh
[1:00:04] freedom
[1:00:06] liberties
[1:00:07] and and scientific achievement men can
[1:00:09] be women
[1:00:11] and i saw a headline the other day and i
[1:00:12] think this was spurred on by the
[1:00:14] controversy
[1:00:15] of a swimmer in college who had
[1:00:18] transitioned from being a male he's a
[1:00:19] male swimmer
[1:00:21] and he transitioned to and i know this
[1:00:22] is just weird
[1:00:24] i can't even believe we're talking about
[1:00:25] it but
[1:00:27] uh he identifies as a woman and i don't
[1:00:28] know the exact uh transition he's gone
[1:00:31] through but now he competes
[1:00:32] competitively as a woman in collegiate
[1:00:35] athletics
[1:00:36] and is winning
[1:00:38] as a male swimmer in a pool
[1:00:40] uh a pool of swimmers female swimmers
[1:00:43] and
[1:00:45] the the headline was women are now third
[1:00:48] class citizens
[1:00:50] i was like you better believe it
[1:00:52] that's exactly the fallout
[1:00:54] for the sense of liberty
[1:00:56] and freedoms and people should have a
[1:00:58] right to be whoever you are they don't
[1:00:59] think about the consequence
[1:01:01] you think maybe god knew what he was
[1:01:02] doing when he created a man as a man and
[1:01:04] a woman as a woman
[1:01:06] you don't think he understood balances
[1:01:07] and
[1:01:08] and harmony and unity and oneness and
[1:01:11] then also you introduce another
[1:01:13] uh
[1:01:15] mansur
[1:01:16] into the equation
[1:01:19] and now all of a sudden everything's
[1:01:20] different
[1:01:21] because now you have one that kind of
[1:01:23] occupies this unique space between the
[1:01:24] man and the woman and do you think he's
[1:01:26] going to be the third class
[1:01:28] shem's not going to be the third class
[1:01:30] he's going to exist between the man and
[1:01:31] a woman and now the woman is the third
[1:01:33] class citizen
[1:01:39] and again
[1:01:42] it's a it's a boundary violation
[1:01:46] it's stepping outside the order that
[1:01:47] god's created and what it becomes
[1:01:48] chaotic everything gets turned upside
[1:01:50] down now in ephesians chapter 5 verse 33
[1:01:58] and and i'm going to read quickly
[1:02:00] uh allude to this because i want you to
[1:02:03] recognize that this this dynamic of this
[1:02:06] disrespect
[1:02:08] and
[1:02:09] using liberty
[1:02:11] for the occasion of the flesh
[1:02:13] it's not just always going to be
[1:02:14] exhibited maybe in this area that is
[1:02:18] a lewdness
[1:02:20] in an inappropriate relationship
[1:02:22] paul says nevertheless let every one of
[1:02:24] you in particular and so instead of
[1:02:26] speaking to the generality of christ to
[1:02:28] the body and the body to christ
[1:02:31] and the general relationship he says let
[1:02:32] each one of you he's like coming back to
[1:02:34] his original thought because as he
[1:02:35] embellished on the dynamics of christ in
[1:02:38] the church
[1:02:39] let each one of you in particular so
[1:02:41] loved his wife even as himself
[1:02:45] does that sound
[1:02:47] if familiar
[1:02:47] can do do unto others as you'd have them
[1:02:49] to do unto you thou shalt love thy
[1:02:51] neighbor as thyself
[1:02:53] this is a sincere prevailing affection
[1:02:55] this is you would love your wife like
[1:02:57] you would for yourself this affection
[1:02:59] you'd have for yourself
[1:03:01] that that this respect you would desire
[1:03:03] this um
[1:03:05] what kind of affirmation and confidence
[1:03:07] you would want to be instilled in you
[1:03:08] and
[1:03:09] saying that you ought to love your wife
[1:03:11] love your wife even as yourself and even
[1:03:13] more so in this context because the two
[1:03:15] are one
[1:03:16] no man has ever hated his own flesh
[1:03:19] so this is moderating the change in the
[1:03:21] attitude you would have towards your
[1:03:22] wife
[1:03:23] how can you use this scripture
[1:03:26] to to demean your wife and devalue her
[1:03:30] as being somebody who's a doormat
[1:03:34] he says make you should love your wife
[1:03:36] even as yourself and see that the and
[1:03:38] the wife see that she reverenced her
[1:03:40] husband
[1:03:42] this word reverence it's translated
[1:03:43] irreverence but it's really respect
[1:03:46] which reverend speaks of that it's it's
[1:03:47] it's not not a fear and i'm afraid he'll
[1:03:49] hit me or he's stronger than me it's
[1:03:51] this reverence it's the respect for the
[1:03:53] husband
[1:03:55] and unity is a central principle in
[1:03:57] marriage there has to be unity there has
[1:03:58] to be harmony there has to be agreement
[1:04:00] there has to be mutual respect
[1:04:03] there has to be voluntary accountability
[1:04:07] there has to be a mutual dependency
[1:04:11] between the husband and the wife you say
[1:04:12] oh well he he pays the bills and he has
[1:04:15] the job and he knows how to do this he's
[1:04:18] the head and he's this but that head is
[1:04:20] dependent upon the wife
[1:04:22] just as the wife is depend upon the
[1:04:24] husband it may be different respects and
[1:04:25] different callings in different ways but
[1:04:28] if it ever becomes a codependency things
[1:04:31] get crazy
[1:04:33] abuse control manipulation
[1:04:35] dissatisfaction contempt uh all sorts of
[1:04:40] bitterness begins to breed in that kind
[1:04:42] of environment so paul is expressing
[1:04:44] that in a relationship there has to be a
[1:04:46] a unity and there must be a mutual
[1:04:49] respect
[1:04:50] it's not saying husbands love your wives
[1:04:52] in other words you just love them and
[1:04:53] you think they're beautiful and you
[1:04:54] really married up
[1:04:56] and and you and you just want to kiss
[1:04:58] them and the wife you better respect
[1:05:00] your husband
[1:05:03] it's speaking the same thing
[1:05:08] listen to this statement and
[1:05:16] in psalms 25 14
[1:05:19] i have a uh
[1:05:24] something that's lodged in my mind
[1:05:27] when i saw just how long i preached
[1:05:29] wednesday night and it horrified me so i
[1:05:31] was like i need to make up for it sunday
[1:05:32] morning by preaching like 45 minutes
[1:05:35] too late
[1:05:37] we'll just cancel the evening service
[1:05:39] fair enough
[1:05:44] psalms 25 14 the seeker of the lord is
[1:05:46] with them that fear him
[1:05:48] now that fear is not i'm afraid of god
[1:05:51] it's respect
[1:05:53] it's the reverence it's in awe of how
[1:05:54] great he is it's all of how perfect his
[1:05:56] word is and it says the secret of the
[1:05:59] lord is with them that fear him so in
[1:06:01] respect
[1:06:03] through respect comes a secret
[1:06:06] so respect comes some comes something
[1:06:08] that's very intimate and he will show
[1:06:10] them his covenant
[1:06:12] this is a secret counsel this is a
[1:06:14] familiar converse this is intimacy
[1:06:17] so he's saying the secret there's a
[1:06:18] secret there's something unknown there's
[1:06:20] something that's shared with you
[1:06:22] in the respect where there's this mutual
[1:06:24] respect where there's this respect of
[1:06:26] god it invites this secret because he
[1:06:29] will show you his covenant there will be
[1:06:32] the secret council disclosure of
[1:06:34] intimate knowledge and i want to use
[1:06:35] that as a principle in a marriage where
[1:06:37] there is mutual respect where there's
[1:06:39] mutual respect and reverence where
[1:06:40] there's a husband that loves his wife
[1:06:42] and a wife that loves her husband when
[1:06:43] there's a husband who has submitted
[1:06:45] himself to his wife as the scripture
[1:06:47] says that we ought to and how that the
[1:06:48] wife has submitted to herself to her
[1:06:50] husband when there is love and respect
[1:06:52] mutually in a marriage there's intimacy
[1:06:56] true intimacy there's knowledge
[1:07:00] it's not what brother branham refers to
[1:07:01] earlier as just some sort of evil thing
[1:07:03] uh some unrighteous unholy act where
[1:07:06] there's mutual respect that's where
[1:07:08] there's true affection that's where
[1:07:09] there's true intimacy
[1:07:12] brother brahm says in a thinking man's
[1:07:13] filter just to identify that this theme
[1:07:16] that's
[1:07:17] that's uh being
[1:07:19] lifted up in this relationship context
[1:07:21] is respect he says all for the grace of
[1:07:23] god that he would give us understanding
[1:07:25] of such great mysteries you're never
[1:07:27] going to have it without respecting god
[1:07:29] as paul spoke here further on down in
[1:07:30] ephesians speaking of the husband and
[1:07:32] the wife and said this is a mystery how
[1:07:34] the woman should be in respect to their
[1:07:36] husband
[1:07:37] even the second place i believe the
[1:07:39] entire bible that reverence was ever
[1:07:40] spoke said the woman seeing she
[1:07:42] reverence her husband reverence her
[1:07:44] husband so it's respect that's being
[1:07:45] spoken of
[1:07:47] then a husband all right you ready
[1:07:49] all right husbands have been amen in
[1:07:51] quite a bit
[1:07:53] wives you can exercise discretion then a
[1:07:56] husband ought to live such a life before
[1:07:58] his wife that his wife could reverence
[1:08:00] him as a son of god
[1:08:02] you recognize that the respect is not
[1:08:04] coerced
[1:08:06] the respect is not forced
[1:08:08] the respect is not manipulated the
[1:08:10] respect is not you don't have to give it
[1:08:12] grudgingly you don't have to give it by
[1:08:14] constraint you have to you don't have to
[1:08:16] do it of necessity like well there's not
[1:08:18] going to be any peace in this home
[1:08:19] unless i pretend to reverence him he's
[1:08:22] really drilling down the real the real
[1:08:24] grain of truth how it ought to be saying
[1:08:26] then a husband when paul says that a
[1:08:28] woman should reverence her husband it's
[1:08:30] not in a vacuum it arises from the fact
[1:08:33] that he's teaching husbands how they
[1:08:34] ought to act and how they ought to treat
[1:08:35] their wife and he's saying that if a
[1:08:37] husband can do his part it makes it
[1:08:38] really easy for the wife to do hers
[1:08:41] and i said that you might as well just
[1:08:42] start there
[1:08:43] that no men should put their hands in
[1:08:45] their pockets or fold their arms and so
[1:08:46] if my wife just did her part it would
[1:08:48] make it easier for me to do mine no it
[1:08:50] starts with you you be the one that
[1:08:52] loves and she'll be the one that
[1:08:54] respects
[1:08:57] he says a husband ought to live such a
[1:08:58] life before his wife that his wife could
[1:09:00] respect him he says reverence him as the
[1:09:02] son of god
[1:09:03] and if he doesn't live that kind of life
[1:09:05] well then of course she wouldn't
[1:09:06] reverence him
[1:09:09] and all those sisters said
[1:09:11] oh no i i was just going to say
[1:09:19] just that side eye to you the sister
[1:09:20] across the aisle
[1:09:25] before our neighbor in the apartment
[1:09:26] next door
[1:09:29] doesn't live that kind of life of course
[1:09:30] she wouldn't reference him here's the
[1:09:32] wake up call to to the men in the
[1:09:34] relationship well i can't always demand
[1:09:36] respect because of course if i'm not
[1:09:39] living the kind of life she could
[1:09:40] respect i'm never going to get it
[1:09:43] because she knows what he's made of
[1:09:45] but when it is a man that is a reverent
[1:09:47] man reverend and clean with his wife and
[1:09:49] before his family a real servant of god
[1:09:50] then the woman children and all should
[1:09:52] respect that servant of god with
[1:09:54] reverence
[1:09:56] that's beautiful
[1:10:00] now can we close with the text
[1:10:03] first corinthians chapter seven verses
[1:10:05] one to nine
[1:10:06] paul is clearly uh he's talking about
[1:10:09] respect within a relationship
[1:10:11] now i i sense that maybe i just need to
[1:10:13] kind of back up it's clear we're talking
[1:10:15] about respect
[1:10:17] but if you don't have respect
[1:10:22] then you'll use you'll use liberty
[1:10:24] you'll take your liberty and take
[1:10:26] advantage of somebody else
[1:10:29] and i'm you i'm looking in the context
[1:10:31] of a marriage but i want us to think
[1:10:33] bigger than this because there's some of
[1:10:34] us here who are not married and all the
[1:10:35] single brothers said
[1:10:37] amen
[1:10:38] but yet there's still instruction in
[1:10:40] this
[1:10:41] there's still ways that we could
[1:10:42] recognize that this informs me as a
[1:10:44] single man this informs me as a
[1:10:46] grandparent this informs me in whatever
[1:10:48] area of life i'm in that i need to
[1:10:49] recognize that there's a way there's a
[1:10:51] way a conduct is right and becoming of a
[1:10:53] christian and i cannot violate it
[1:10:55] certainly not using christianity as a
[1:10:57] justification for it
[1:11:00] and that there's a
[1:11:01] there's a way that there's there's a way
[1:11:03] that love acts
[1:11:05] what love is and what it isn't what it
[1:11:06] does and what it doesn't there's a way
[1:11:08] that it acts as a way that it's uh
[1:11:10] manifested and it cannot be manifested
[1:11:13] in force
[1:11:15] that we're wanting to peel away certain
[1:11:17] layers and there's things i recognize in
[1:11:19] my own heart that are that are responses
[1:11:22] to wounds and complexes and i behave
[1:11:24] that way not because i'm sincere but
[1:11:27] because i'm afraid there's ways that i
[1:11:28] act in a defensive way not maybe because
[1:11:30] i'm mean-spirited but because i'm afraid
[1:11:32] and i realize there's things that need
[1:11:34] to be healed in my heart things that i
[1:11:36] want to overcome ways that i want to see
[1:11:38] people better or better understand why
[1:11:40] they are the way they are so i'm not
[1:11:42] always existing in this realm of being
[1:11:45] defensive or being forceful that i can
[1:11:47] completely relax in his love for me and
[1:11:50] be confident in what he made me and not
[1:11:52] always be defensive or put myself
[1:11:54] forward resort to pretense or feel that
[1:11:56] i've got to carve out some kind of niche
[1:11:58] to feel special
[1:12:02] and so this is an example that's very
[1:12:04] pertinent to us as to those of us who
[1:12:06] are married
[1:12:08] but may please make it applicable in
[1:12:10] much a much broader sense in first
[1:12:12] corinthians chapter 7 verses 1 to 9 i
[1:12:14] think i won't read all of it though
[1:12:16] but he says
[1:12:18] that they wrote unto him and so it's
[1:12:20] good he says concerning the things you
[1:12:22] wrote to me and he just gets right on
[1:12:24] the subject it's good for a man not to
[1:12:25] touch a woman nevertheless to avoid
[1:12:27] fornication let every man have his own
[1:12:29] wife and let every woman have their own
[1:12:31] husband
[1:12:33] let the husband
[1:12:35] render unto the wife do benevolence
[1:12:38] that's due love
[1:12:40] do tenderness do care do provision do
[1:12:43] protection that's what is all assumed in
[1:12:45] benevolence it's what do her
[1:12:47] and what does love do it gives what is
[1:12:49] due
[1:12:50] it never dethron defrauds it never re
[1:12:53] holds back something that someone is due
[1:12:56] it renders in a wife rendering to the
[1:12:57] wife dude benevolence and likewise also
[1:12:59] the wife under the husband so she also
[1:13:01] renders due love and tenderness and care
[1:13:03] provision protection there's a it's
[1:13:05] mutual
[1:13:06] the wife hath no power of her own body
[1:13:09] but the husband bless god musicians if
[1:13:11] you'd come
[1:13:13] we hit it there we finally got to it
[1:13:18] and likewise us also the husband hath
[1:13:21] not power of his own body but the wife
[1:13:24] do you realize how often husbands have
[1:13:26] used
[1:13:27] the mantra i'm the husband i'm the head
[1:13:29] you're my wife
[1:13:31] to do whatever they want
[1:13:33] but it doesn't work the other way
[1:13:35] even though the bible is saying
[1:13:37] the man the woman has no power over her
[1:13:40] own body but the husband but in the same
[1:13:42] way the husband has no power over his
[1:13:44] own body but the wife it's mutual
[1:13:47] so he says defraud you not one another
[1:13:49] accept it be with consent for a time
[1:13:51] that you may give yourselves to fast in
[1:13:53] prayer and come together again that
[1:13:55] satan tempts you not for your
[1:13:56] incontinence
[1:13:58] i know it might surprise some of you to
[1:13:59] see that even in the word of god the
[1:14:00] word consent is used
[1:14:03] and i'll say this it keeps coming up my
[1:14:04] mind as i studied this but you know i
[1:14:07] don't know what everyone else's take was
[1:14:08] on it but i thought the me too movement
[1:14:10] was about time movement
[1:14:13] it's about time that men be held
[1:14:14] accountable for their conduct
[1:14:16] they can't just justify act however they
[1:14:18] want live however they want say whatever
[1:14:20] they want yeah men need to be held
[1:14:21] accountable there's a big headline said
[1:14:23] men are afraid of hugging women in the
[1:14:24] workforce now it's like good
[1:14:26] that's probably a good thing
[1:14:28] you know don't go around hugging women
[1:14:30] in the workforce
[1:14:31] it's good for a man not to touch a woman
[1:14:33] it's good
[1:14:34] the bibles teach us such beautiful
[1:14:35] principles of respecting one another's
[1:14:37] space and boundaries to where if you
[1:14:39] just lived a christian life you wouldn't
[1:14:40] have to worry about a me too movement
[1:14:45] and so it says this
[1:14:47] in to defraud naught
[1:14:50] it means don't withhold affection
[1:14:52] defraud not by refusing a marriage duty
[1:14:54] defraud not by withholding affection to
[1:14:56] to to deny what is due in a marriage is
[1:14:58] an injustice it's an offense
[1:15:01] and in this way where you're if you're
[1:15:03] not rendering due benevolence if you're
[1:15:05] defrauding your partner in the marriage
[1:15:07] within this marriage context he there
[1:15:09] this is an offense this is an injustice
[1:15:11] it causes harm right
[1:15:13] there's a breach in the spirit it it's
[1:15:15] working against
[1:15:17] uh uh the unity and the harmony the
[1:15:19] mutual respect of the marriage he says
[1:15:21] that you defraud naught he says unless
[1:15:22] there's
[1:15:23] consent he says so in this
[1:15:25] you you defraud and you injure
[1:15:28] unless there's mutual consent
[1:15:31] that if it's ever by force
[1:15:34] if it's ever deprived or or forced
[1:15:37] because it's within someone's power he's
[1:15:39] saying that there's this there's an
[1:15:40] injury
[1:15:41] he says and notice what the logical
[1:15:43] conclusion of this is you'll be tempted
[1:15:44] by satan of your because you have
[1:15:46] incontinence it means taking advantage
[1:15:48] because of a lack of self-control and to
[1:15:50] me that immediately just kind of opens
[1:15:52] up the whole picture in a lot of
[1:15:53] different ways how self-control is at
[1:15:55] the root of all of this
[1:15:58] that
[1:15:59] in a in a marriage that paul is lifting
[1:16:01] up he's saying that a woman has power
[1:16:03] over her husband's body the husband has
[1:16:05] power over the woman's body this is
[1:16:07] mutual accountability this is mutual
[1:16:08] dependency no one has the upper hand no
[1:16:11] one can force anything so they conduct
[1:16:13] themselves together through consent
[1:16:16] not through force and the each one is
[1:16:18] challenged that am i using emotions am i
[1:16:21] using power am i using manipulation am i
[1:16:24] doing something because i want to get my
[1:16:26] way in this marriage by withholding or
[1:16:28] by defrauding he's dealing with this all
[1:16:31] in a way to where this is you're using
[1:16:33] the liberty for the occasion of the
[1:16:34] flesh either way you slice it
[1:16:41] and then the
[1:16:43] he identifies the error and that kind of
[1:16:45] behavior that if something is missing
[1:16:49] something will be sought to take its
[1:16:50] place
[1:16:53] question and answers part two
[1:16:56] question 312 should a saved wife refuse
[1:16:59] herself to her husband if he is a sinner
[1:17:02] no sir no sir
[1:17:04] that's your husband
[1:17:06] you'll drive him farther away from god
[1:17:08] than ever by doing that
[1:17:10] that's right brother sister you married
[1:17:12] him
[1:17:14] he's yours
[1:17:15] and you're his
[1:17:17] that's exactly what the bible's saying
[1:17:20] now i know that maybe there's a little
[1:17:22] bit of an uncomfortable subject
[1:17:24] and we're looking at our watches saying
[1:17:25] yeah 45 minutes would have been
[1:17:27] great um
[1:17:30] but think about how the bible is
[1:17:32] speaking to something very personal very
[1:17:34] intimate and how even in that there's
[1:17:36] boundaries
[1:17:39] even in that
[1:17:41] well you married me
[1:17:43] as if to say
[1:17:44] when you signed up for this
[1:17:46] you signed up for all of it honey
[1:17:49] so come on get what you asked for
[1:17:51] like no that
[1:17:52] it's just because you're married doesn't
[1:17:54] mean you're free to do whatever you want
[1:17:58] so he's asked the question the next week
[1:18:00] question 372 would you please explain
[1:18:03] first corinthians chapter 7 verses 1
[1:18:05] and 9.
[1:18:07] and and then the way that i would i
[1:18:08] think the question
[1:18:09] this is my personal opinion i think they
[1:18:11] were being
[1:18:12] asked
[1:18:14] um
[1:18:17] asked to explain the all
[1:18:20] nine of these verses verses one to nine
[1:18:22] and he has brother neville grabbed the
[1:18:24] scripture he goes on to another question
[1:18:25] because he hasn't read it his question
[1:18:27] he wasn't prepared to answer it
[1:18:29] and so he has brother neville grab the
[1:18:31] scripture and then he just kind of looks
[1:18:32] at it and it's paragraph 304 several
[1:18:34] paragraphs later
[1:18:35] he reads verse
[1:18:37] 2 i believe it is
[1:18:39] or
[1:18:40] actually
[1:18:42] verse 9 he says but if they cannot
[1:18:44] contain let them marry for it is better
[1:18:45] to marry than to burn so he just reads
[1:18:47] verse 9. he says all right that's for
[1:18:49] just dirty living
[1:18:51] and said a man or boy girl or something
[1:18:53] or another when they're going together
[1:18:55] and they know that they should be
[1:18:56] married go ahead and get married
[1:18:59] i i think you understand what i mean
[1:19:01] don't you don't just give a dirty little
[1:19:03] uh a life there because it's not right
[1:19:05] cohabitation he's talking about that
[1:19:07] situation where if you're living
[1:19:08] together and you're sharing intimacy
[1:19:10] he's saying just get married
[1:19:13] and and that's it so it seems like he's
[1:19:15] zeroed in and he's just focused in on
[1:19:16] verse nine in answering this question
[1:19:18] but i want you to notice how what he
[1:19:19] says speaks to the whole part
[1:19:22] he said that's your sister in one sense
[1:19:25] where if you're where if you're a
[1:19:26] christian
[1:19:27] now if it's the world it's the world dog
[1:19:30] eat dog
[1:19:31] think of that context that's how the
[1:19:33] world lives dog eat dog get yours while
[1:19:36] you can
[1:19:38] do unto others before they have a chance
[1:19:39] to do unto you
[1:19:40] right they had it coming you gotta you
[1:19:43] gotta protect yourself you gotta look
[1:19:44] out for yourself and survival of the
[1:19:46] fittest he said if it's the world what
[1:19:47] do you expect
[1:19:49] you don't expect a man to live with a
[1:19:51] woman in a way that uh uh
[1:19:54] addresses her weaknesses and feels her
[1:19:56] needs
[1:19:57] and the security
[1:19:59] and it's very easy for a woman to be
[1:20:00] bound in a cohabitation and
[1:20:03] in a sense to where
[1:20:05] there's this need for protection and
[1:20:07] there's a need for
[1:20:09] a and that intimacy is so important
[1:20:11] she's bound to that person knowing that
[1:20:13] she's outside the sanctity of marriage
[1:20:15] but she longs for that protection and
[1:20:17] that means so much that she's by force
[1:20:19] and by necessity in that relationship
[1:20:22] and the mutual promise of to having to
[1:20:24] hold and to to care and i'm with you
[1:20:27] till death does part it doesn't exist
[1:20:29] and that that wounds a spirit there's an
[1:20:32] offense in that i want you to draw from
[1:20:33] the things that we're reading earlier
[1:20:34] that if something is not appropriate
[1:20:36] there's a cost there's a price
[1:20:38] you're existing in the danger zone
[1:20:40] there's a detriment to spirit there's a
[1:20:41] detriment to faith there's a detriment
[1:20:43] to conscience there's a detriment to
[1:20:44] someone's self-value so brother branham
[1:20:46] is answering all of verses one to nine
[1:20:49] not just verse nine he says but this
[1:20:50] girl that you're going with that's your
[1:20:52] sister too
[1:20:53] that'll be the mother of your children
[1:20:54] that'll come
[1:20:56] don't live a dirty little life around
[1:20:58] her there there's situations that i'm
[1:21:02] familiar with in counseling
[1:21:04] situations that i've had to address
[1:21:06] whether it be as a as a minister or
[1:21:07] maybe family situations where i could
[1:21:10] trace
[1:21:12] the conduct and behavior within the
[1:21:13] marriage back to the conduct and
[1:21:15] behavior in the courtship
[1:21:18] where there was a there was a violation
[1:21:20] of virtue there was a disrespect and the
[1:21:22] woman is dragged into the vow with the
[1:21:25] feeling of shame and the the mutual
[1:21:29] respect is never achieved in the
[1:21:30] marriage until that you address that
[1:21:33] and and for some people you can't ever
[1:21:35] do that
[1:21:36] you're always in exist with this breach
[1:21:38] in this marriage because deep down
[1:21:39] inside the woman can't respect the
[1:21:41] husband for what happened and the
[1:21:42] husband can't respect the wife for what
[1:21:44] happened and they never get to a place
[1:21:45] of mutual respect
[1:21:48] and guess what the secret of the lord is
[1:21:49] not there
[1:21:51] the the what a marriage can be is
[1:21:53] lacking i know this all of a sudden just
[1:21:55] maybe got very real but considerate
[1:21:57] saints
[1:21:59] consider it
[1:22:03] he says don't live a dirty life around
[1:22:05] her this is an admonishment to our young
[1:22:07] men to conduct yourself the right way in
[1:22:09] a courtship because there's a price
[1:22:13] there's a price if we don't
[1:22:14] when i teach on courtship i have uh
[1:22:17] there's one goal in a courtship no
[1:22:19] regrets
[1:22:21] a successful courtship is not one that
[1:22:22] ends in engagement a successful
[1:22:24] courtship is a courtship that ends with
[1:22:25] no regrets
[1:22:28] don't live a dirty life around or show
[1:22:30] that you're a real christian gentleman
[1:22:31] live like a christian gentleman ought to
[1:22:34] and treat her like your sister and when
[1:22:36] you get married married still treat her
[1:22:38] that way
[1:22:40] and then he he did detail some things i
[1:22:42] would encourage you to go back and
[1:22:43] listen to these other paragraphs uh 305
[1:22:46] to 307 but i want to skip just so you
[1:22:48] can see how he's still answering all
[1:22:50] these verses and you women live the
[1:22:53] right way to your husband and you
[1:22:55] husbands live the right way to your
[1:22:56] wives live right to your wives be real
[1:22:59] real nice and respect one another just
[1:23:02] with
[1:23:03] he says
[1:23:04] and your family relations and so forth
[1:23:06] like that
[1:23:08] be real nice and respect one or let it
[1:23:10] just be reverently and godly and agreed
[1:23:13] with among you and everything as it can
[1:23:15] be
[1:23:17] don't never push and shove and be dirty
[1:23:20] and vulgar
[1:23:21] understand talk to your wife if one
[1:23:24] nature is to you and another nature to
[1:23:26] her talk with her
[1:23:28] hey guess what this is in the message
[1:23:31] guess what i didn't have to run down to
[1:23:33] dr dobson for this
[1:23:35] i didn't have to go to genre gear in
[1:23:37] colorado i didn't have to go to gary i
[1:23:39] didn't have to go to anywhere else to
[1:23:40] get real wisdom from the word of god
[1:23:42] that communication is necessary within a
[1:23:45] marriage
[1:23:48] understand one another be a real
[1:23:49] christian gentleman this is so beautiful
[1:23:51] don't push of it don't be dirty don't be
[1:23:53] vulgar don't be disrespectful don't be
[1:23:55] inappropriate but talk to one another
[1:23:57] understand one another's nature you
[1:24:00] might be a particular way she might be a
[1:24:01] particular way and the only way you're
[1:24:03] ever going to harmonize is to
[1:24:04] communicate
[1:24:06] show respect one another you try to do
[1:24:08] the same thing to him sister and the
[1:24:10] same way understand one another and be a
[1:24:12] real christian gentleman a real
[1:24:14] christian ladies and brother and sister
[1:24:16] with one another always remember you're
[1:24:18] god's children and you're from a royal
[1:24:21] family
[1:24:22] does this not answer
[1:24:24] please explain first corinthians 7 1-9
[1:24:26] does this not give you the real heart of
[1:24:29] what you need to navigate
[1:24:31] versus one to nine
[1:24:33] the mutual respect
[1:24:34] the love for one another the
[1:24:36] communication
[1:24:37] most problems that we have in
[1:24:38] relationships come down to a lack of
[1:24:40] communication or miscommunication
[1:24:43] it's where it is and why do we not
[1:24:45] communicate someone sometimes we don't
[1:24:46] want to get our head bit off
[1:24:48] right i don't want to say anything
[1:24:49] because if i do it's going to cause a
[1:24:50] lot of drama well okay so then you're
[1:24:52] part to blame
[1:24:54] right but you realize some some way of
[1:24:57] interacting has developed
[1:25:00] that doesn't give
[1:25:02] doesn't create the right kind of
[1:25:03] atmosphere
[1:25:07] to exist harmoniously within our space
[1:25:12] but now we've been using marriage as a
[1:25:14] context and i believe it's very direct
[1:25:16] to us who are married amen
[1:25:18] i say amen to it
[1:25:23] praise your brother
[1:25:24] heron amen
[1:25:30] i need it
[1:25:32] and so that nobody thinks i need it i
[1:25:34] get the most aggressive amens right i
[1:25:35] say it aggressive yes that's right amen
[1:25:37] duh
[1:25:40] sure
[1:25:42] so it's i i need this but now let's
[1:25:45] think of it all for all of us
[1:25:47] think of it for all of us
[1:25:51] you're from a royal family
[1:25:54] you should think that way of your spouse
[1:25:57] what about the person sitting in front
[1:25:58] of you
[1:26:01] you're a royal blood
[1:26:03] there's no blood or better blood in the
[1:26:04] world than yours that's right a royal
[1:26:07] blood shows itself that's what it is
[1:26:09] it's royal
[1:26:10] show
[1:26:11] what you are
[1:26:14] if you really get a hold of that you'll
[1:26:15] know that you don't ever have to look
[1:26:16] down on somebody else even if they're
[1:26:17] not on the seat in front of
[1:26:20] you show what you are i'm a son of a
[1:26:22] king i'm the son of the king my wife's a
[1:26:24] daughter of a king
[1:26:26] how would i treat that king's daughter
[1:26:28] how would she treat that king's son
[1:26:32] he says see what i mean
[1:26:34] be real genuine
[1:26:37] how would you treat a king son
[1:26:40] you'd probably show him respect wouldn't
[1:26:41] you
[1:26:42] how would you treat a king's daughter
[1:26:45] you'd probably probably show her respect
[1:26:48] god bless you today if we could stand
[1:26:50] together
[1:26:57] lord willing wednesday i want to
[1:27:00] finish this series
[1:27:02] go ahead and use the subject of respect
[1:27:06] and identify
[1:27:08] a
[1:27:10] maybe back up just a little bit and and
[1:27:12] i have all the i'm prepared to preach it
[1:27:14] right now
[1:27:16] okay i won't
[1:27:17] um
[1:27:19] but
[1:27:20] go revisit the concept of boundaries and
[1:27:22] barriers again
[1:27:25] and how
[1:27:26] how we relate to them
[1:27:28] and how boundaries to be respected but
[1:27:30] of barriers to be overcome
[1:27:33] and that
[1:27:34] therefore it's important for us to
[1:27:36] recognize them in our own lives what's a
[1:27:37] barrier what's a boundary and i haven't
[1:27:39] preached on this just to make us all
[1:27:40] cautious
[1:27:42] like i don't know
[1:27:43] do they like me do they not like me is
[1:27:44] this a barrier this is a boundary it's
[1:27:46] not to make us more reluctant to make us
[1:27:48] more confident
[1:27:49] and and then to
[1:27:51] specifically identify in the scripture
[1:27:53] how jesus and paul and using different
[1:27:56] instances that jesus uses and paul uses
[1:27:58] that word there's a there's an offense
[1:28:00] recognized and how it's addressed
[1:28:03] how because jesus talks about trespasses
[1:28:05] right
[1:28:06] what's a trespass it's a boundary
[1:28:08] violation
[1:28:09] and so he says when your brother
[1:28:10] trespasses against you he gives you a
[1:28:12] process of how to handle those and i
[1:28:15] want to arrive at
[1:28:17] a conclusion of why
[1:28:20] why we do that
[1:28:22] how important it is for us to not
[1:28:25] violate to for us to be respectful
[1:28:28] but then how important it is for us to
[1:28:30] recognize the disrespect
[1:28:32] and
[1:28:33] shore up that breach and do the right
[1:28:34] things
[1:28:36] and not misunderstand it because there's
[1:28:37] sometimes turn them over to sit for the
[1:28:39] destruction of their flesh and let me
[1:28:40] help in the process
[1:28:42] and what we really want to see we want
[1:28:43] to see him get destroyed kind of like
[1:28:45] jonah
[1:28:46] what did he want to happen see happen to
[1:28:47] nineveh
[1:28:49] why isn't it burning down
[1:28:51] what's wrong what's happening jonah
[1:28:53] didn't realize that the word of god was
[1:28:55] being effective and sometimes i think we
[1:28:56] turn somebody over to satan for the
[1:28:58] destruction of the flesh and we get all
[1:28:59] upset and frustrated when their flesh
[1:29:01] isn't destroyed but they kind of
[1:29:02] moderate and come right back and they
[1:29:03] humble themselves it's like that's the
[1:29:05] goal
[1:29:06] that's what we want to achieve
[1:29:08] and it's so unimportant to recognize it
[1:29:10] within this context that's just not a
[1:29:11] bunch of church rules that as a church
[1:29:14] you know bless god if you don't look toe
[1:29:15] the line we're going to mark those who
[1:29:17] act contrary to the gospel that we've
[1:29:19] been preached and
[1:29:20] and if you don't act right hit the door
[1:29:22] if you don't want to toe the line hit
[1:29:23] the door that's that was never meant for
[1:29:25] church order
[1:29:27] as a matter of fact it was some of the
[1:29:29] most specific things that referenced
[1:29:30] this was for the individual who's hurt
[1:29:34] and not the church that is offended
[1:29:37] it's the individual that's hurt so pray
[1:29:39] for me i wanted to preach that today
[1:29:43] but the lord said no
[1:29:44] [Music]
[1:29:48] you have to touch on the subject of
[1:29:50] the use of force instead of love
[1:29:54] this lack of respect
[1:29:56] that sometimes we can exhibit to one
[1:29:57] another when we don't motivate
[1:30:00] we manipulate
[1:30:02] thank you so much for your time today
[1:30:04] thank you for listening heavenly father
[1:30:10] you know better than i just how
[1:30:12] remarkable of a congregation
[1:30:15] was assembled today
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:18] lord i look out upon an audience and i
[1:30:20] see
[1:30:22] i recognize
[1:30:23] almost every face
[1:30:25] and realize that there's some amongst us
[1:30:27] today that have never been here before
[1:30:29] [Music]
[1:30:30] there's some visiting that have
[1:30:32] visited before
[1:30:35] and then there's a family that's been
[1:30:36] assembling itself together now for
[1:30:38] many months
[1:30:41] it's what's become a church
[1:30:44] and somehow lord you by your providence
[1:30:47] knew just exactly who would be here
[1:30:49] today
[1:30:52] you knew who needed to be present
[1:30:54] in some ways lord
[1:30:56] perhaps
[1:30:58] could not be present
[1:31:01] and you structured a service
[1:31:05] in a very specific and precise way
[1:31:08] [Music]
[1:31:10] and i pray
[1:31:12] that we could
[1:31:15] each one in particular
[1:31:18] so receive this word
[1:31:23] and may it be instructed to us whether
[1:31:26] we be a single brother or a single
[1:31:28] sister
[1:31:30] whether we be
[1:31:32] a single father a single mother whether
[1:31:34] we be a
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:36] eligible for married or ineligible
[1:31:38] whether we be grandparents or parents
[1:31:40] regardless of who we are there has to be
[1:31:42] a way that we can search our hearts
[1:31:45] and take ownership of our royalty
[1:31:49] and then look upon others
[1:31:51] [Music]
[1:31:53] as
[1:31:54] your creation
[1:31:57] and know that there's a way that i must
[1:31:59] conduct myself
[1:32:01] in the face of their offenses in the
[1:32:03] face of their sin in the face of their
[1:32:05] iniquity
[1:32:07] that could speak to the royalty in their
[1:32:09] hearts
[1:32:13] that could awaken a son or daughter of
[1:32:15] god to conscience
[1:32:18] and lord i know that we must do it for
[1:32:20] our own selves we must
[1:32:22] as royalty defend our kingdom and defend
[1:32:24] our borders and to defend our hearts and
[1:32:26] defend our children
[1:32:28] and we must we must do that but father i
[1:32:31] i as i share this in my heart now in
[1:32:34] prayer
[1:32:34] [Music]
[1:32:37] most of what
[1:32:38] is driving me is to recognize we could
[1:32:40] do more with this light that we have
[1:32:42] than we
[1:32:43] are doing
[1:32:45] and i would want us to be free lord
[1:32:49] free from restraint free from complex
[1:32:51] free from fear
[1:32:52] so now lord i pray for husbands that
[1:32:54] they could
[1:32:55] love their wives that wives also could
[1:32:57] respect their husbands together mutually
[1:33:00] respecting one another
[1:33:02] and may we realize that
[1:33:04] in relationships there must be communion
[1:33:06] and communication and understanding of
[1:33:08] one another's nature and what they're
[1:33:09] comfortable with
[1:33:11] and respect those respect those things
[1:33:14] come to an understanding
[1:33:15] i commit the people to you now lord
[1:33:17] thanking you for your presence with us
[1:33:20] in the name lord jesus christ we pray
[1:33:23] amen amen
