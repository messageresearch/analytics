[0:00] we're going to continue on uh the
[0:01] subject of the house of the Lord and uh
[0:04] we've been exploring it through a number
[0:06] of different services to this point and
[0:09] a lot of these things all kind of
[0:10] connect together for myself I see this
[0:12] continuity of a number of different um
[0:14] touch points and uh building blocks in
[0:17] this subject but today I want to take
[0:19] the title why houses fall just drawing
[0:22] it from these four verses here on these
[0:24] different foundations why houses fall
[0:28] and recapping the last few services on
[0:32] this series the house of the Lord and
[0:34] laying a good foundation and some of
[0:36] those subjects that we were on uh we are
[0:38] using how the in the building of the
[0:40] house of the Lord um it's an example to
[0:42] us we've seen how the house of the Lord
[0:43] is a type of us um a type of us as
[0:46] individuals a type of our families a
[0:48] type of our church type of the body of
[0:50] Christ but we've been looking at how
[0:51] that in the building and the
[0:53] construction of the temple that it was
[0:56] it's an example to us in the wisdom and
[1:00] preparation that was used to establish
[1:02] the temple and to build it and the Bible
[1:04] tells us that all of Solomon's work when
[1:07] he began to build the temple was
[1:08] carefully considered and accounted for
[1:11] before work ever began there were
[1:14] materials uh procured and there was
[1:16] things carved out and things put
[1:18] together M materials fabricated a and
[1:21] and he made sure he made alliances with
[1:23] Kings and he made sure that he had
[1:25] everything he needed to build the temple
[1:27] before uh one thing was done and so it
[1:30] was a great work that was done and a lot
[1:33] of work done beforehand before you'd
[1:35] ever see something being built uh
[1:37] someone could uh when someone builds a
[1:39] house and you start to see the
[1:40] foundation go in and the framing go up
[1:42] and you say oh it took them six months
[1:44] to build that house well that might have
[1:46] just been in the visible construction
[1:49] there's a lot of things that take place
[1:51] uh before that to put you in a position
[1:53] uh uh to build and and sometimes it's a
[1:55] lot of time that goes by and you can
[1:57] just blame the city or the county for
[1:59] that cuz they just drag your feet on
[2:00] Perman processes but the that's right
[2:03] but the uh we've been looking at in that
[2:07] that a foundation or the beginning of
[2:08] something is not necessarily just the
[2:10] Bedrock or the first thing that's laid
[2:13] down but it's all the principles and
[2:15] planning that goes into the building
[2:17] beforehand and in the actual foundation
[2:20] of the temple it was very uh very deep
[2:23] in the ground it was and then once they
[2:26] got deep in the ground they used hard
[2:28] Stones durable Stones things that um
[2:30] were United to the Earth so that it
[2:33] would the Earth would have to pass away
[2:35] before this building would pass away and
[2:37] so it could withstand the test of time
[2:40] uh because its basis was Secure it's be
[2:42] its foundation or its Beginnings in
[2:44] principle was sure uh it was the Lord's
[2:47] uh doing and it was uh thought out and
[2:49] well planned and carefully planned but
[2:51] then its basis was Secure it was on the
[2:54] on the Bedrock it was sound and in
[2:56] Psalms 11: 3 and 4 it says if the
[2:59] foundations be destroyed what can the
[3:02] righteous do and then it says the Lord
[3:05] is in his holy Temple the Lord's Throne
[3:06] is in heaven his eyes behold his eyelids
[3:09] try the children of men just that image
[3:12] of the Lord being in his Temple his
[3:14] throne being in heaven and what that was
[3:16] to represent on Earth with the temple
[3:18] and the Temple's Foundation uh where
[3:20] there was great stones and it was costly
[3:22] and it was a great work it says this and
[3:25] referring to a little bit different
[3:26] situation but yet the principle remains
[3:28] if the foundations be destroyed what can
[3:31] the righteous do because it's if if the
[3:35] if order is upset if if the rules of
[3:37] right and Justice and and uh and what is
[3:39] right and correct is destroyed the very
[3:41] principles upon which things are
[3:43] governed and the laws by which a thing
[3:44] is governed are destroyed then it's
[3:46] chaos it's
[3:48] Anarchy and so here we realize that
[3:51] foundations are not just physical but
[3:53] it's the principles upon which the thing
[3:55] is built and if the foundation be
[3:57] destroyed then that which is built will
[4:00] fail that's what it's saying if the
[4:02] foundations be destroyed then what can
[4:04] the righteous do there's it doesn't
[4:06] matter how well the structure is built
[4:08] if you destroy the foundation the house
[4:10] is doomed if the foundations be
[4:13] destroyed then whatever is built upon
[4:15] that foundation will be ruined again
[4:18] regardless of what is
[4:20] built if what supports it is compromised
[4:23] it's going to eventually fall that
[4:26] brings us to the subject today of why
[4:29] houses fall and if you look at Matthew
[4:32] chapter 7 we'll just begin to go through
[4:34] this text a little bit we want to I want
[4:36] to examine the the parable of these two
[4:38] houses or you could say two foundations
[4:40] and I think in looking at this there's
[4:41] personal truths that we can glean from
[4:43] this uh but yet what I realized in in
[4:47] just putting these thoughts together and
[4:50] uh and there's been one particular very
[4:53] specific things I'd like to get to I may
[4:55] just have to do it Wednesday night I was
[4:56] wanting to do it on a Sunday morning but
[4:58] just some things that get to that I'm
[5:01] looking at but then it just seemed like
[5:03] it just keeps getting bigger and bigger
[5:05] and bigger and I want to slow down and
[5:06] take some things that are very practical
[5:09] but I'll I'll get it all out there this
[5:11] morning Lord willing but as we go
[5:14] through this glean very practical things
[5:16] from the scripture that answer or that
[5:19] are why houses fall and and look at
[5:22] yourself as an individual you can look
[5:23] at yourself as a family in your home or
[5:26] even churches and you'll realize there's
[5:28] very practical things that the Bible ask
[5:31] us to do or that we ought to be doing
[5:33] that are indicative of whether or not
[5:34] we're laying the right kind of
[5:35] foundation or building the right way now
[5:38] in Matthew chapter 7 we'll start with
[5:40] verse 21 we'll read to verse 23 and then
[5:42] we'll jump back uh to verse 24 here in a
[5:44] little bit says not everyone that saith
[5:46] unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[5:48] kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the
[5:51] will of My Father which is in heaven so
[5:54] you could read it this way he that doeth
[5:56] the will of My Father which is in heaven
[5:58] shall enter into to the kingdom of
[6:01] heaven but not just those who say Lord
[6:04] Lord so then he says many will say to me
[6:06] in that day Lord Lord have we not
[6:08] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[6:10] have cast out devils and in thy name
[6:12] done many wonderful works and then will
[6:15] I profess unto them I never knew you
[6:17] depart from me ye that work
[6:20] iniquity now brother brandham uh when he
[6:23] takes this and he gives us kind of the
[6:25] Divine commentary on it he he affirms
[6:29] this that Christ does not deny that they
[6:32] had cast out devils and that they had
[6:34] prophesied so it's not that Jesus it's
[6:37] not that we should read this to say oh
[6:39] they're lying and that's the real issue
[6:42] uh but they and and Jesus doesn't
[6:44] dispute that he doesn't say oh uh you
[6:46] never did that but he says depart from
[6:49] me ye that work iniquity and what's so
[6:52] outstanding is Works were at the heart
[6:56] of their objection or their question
[6:58] we've prophesied in name we in your name
[7:00] we've cast out devils and we've done
[7:02] many wonderful works and I would say the
[7:04] wonderful Works tie back to these other
[7:06] things that they speak of and he's
[7:08] saying he calls the work
[7:11] iniquity now I wouldn't I'm not
[7:13] suggesting that prophesying or casting
[7:15] out devils in these wonderful works are
[7:18] the iniquity but he's saying they worked
[7:20] but they're not
[7:21] righteous the the iniquities to contrast
[7:23] with with righteousness and brother
[7:26] Brandon makes this statement in The
[7:27] Invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[7:28] he says neither can you bear God's sons
[7:31] of his word to this illegitimate
[7:33] denominational group and it says kind of
[7:36] I realized maybe I could have included a
[7:38] lot more before but it just that just
[7:40] keeps getting bigger and bigger so you
[7:41] can't bring forth denominations cannot
[7:44] bring forth a child of God says you
[7:46] cannot do it if your incubator in your
[7:49] incubator you cannot bring forth a word
[7:51] Son of God I'm speaking to the church
[7:53] but still you claim to be very
[7:56] religious so Cain the prostitute eveon
[8:00] very religious built altars and offered
[8:02] sacrifices paid his tithe and done
[8:05] everything that any other religious man
[8:06] would do but he failed to keep that word
[8:10] and then this connection is very
[8:11] important today he failed to have the
[8:14] Revelation now Cain
[8:17] worshiped he he built altars he
[8:19] worshiped he called upon the Lord and
[8:22] and the distinction in the scripture is
[8:24] that Cain did many wonderful works but
[8:27] he didn't obey the word
[8:30] and his obedience failed because he
[8:32] didn't have
[8:34] Revelation and so failing to have the
[8:36] Revelation he didn't have the rock
[8:38] because Revelation is the rock it's the
[8:40] only foundation so Revelation is one of
[8:43] those blocks that I need you to build
[8:44] upon today but Cain was very religious
[8:48] but he failed to keep the
[8:49] word in the sermon the indictment and I
[8:52] I want to put this here but I hope you
[8:53] hold on to it I was going to use it
[8:54] later but I hope you hold on to it he
[8:56] says today men walk ignorantly they
[8:58] don't know that that's the truth they
[9:01] think it's some kind of ism and I'll
[9:02] just say they don't know the message is
[9:03] the truth they think it's just bromism
[9:05] they think it's a cult they think it's
[9:07] just some fanaticism he says they don't
[9:09] dig down deep enough to get into the
[9:12] spirit of
[9:13] Revelation they don't pray enough they
[9:16] don't call upon God enough and what are
[9:18] we taught that we should call upon God
[9:19] for more than anything Revelation they
[9:22] just lightly take it oh well I believe
[9:24] there's a God
[9:25] sure the devil believes the same thing
[9:28] the devil believes it more than some
[9:29] people claim to believe believe it the
[9:31] devil believes it and trembles people
[9:34] just believe it and go on and where's
[9:37] where's the problem not in that they
[9:39] believe it not in that they've heard it
[9:41] or they've heard the wrong thing they're
[9:42] hearing it but they don't dig down deep
[9:45] enough there needs to be some deepness
[9:48] they're not digging down deep enough so
[9:50] that concept of there being something
[9:52] there but you don't dig down deep enough
[9:54] to see it for what it is to really get
[9:57] the
[9:58] Revelation and in lacking the Revelation
[10:01] they just believe it and go on they're
[10:03] not getting in the spirit of Revelation
[10:05] they're not praying and calling upon God
[10:07] to then receive it and really walk in it
[10:12] because he says they walk ignorantly so
[10:14] as Jesus is saying this not everyone
[10:16] that says Lord Lord is going to enter
[10:18] the kingdom of heaven and he's laying
[10:20] out some of these very specific works
[10:23] that they'll do what is that issue is
[10:25] the failure to obey the word of God he
[10:28] says he that does the will of my father
[10:30] the will of father is his word this is a
[10:32] failure to obey the word of God to do
[10:35] God's Will and at the heart of it it's a
[10:37] question of
[10:39] faith if someone hears the word and
[10:41] claims to believe it but doesn't do it
[10:43] that's not real
[10:44] Faith that's just some sort of ascent
[10:47] and acknowledgement on an intellectual
[10:49] level but real faith is demon there's a
[10:52] demonstration when there's real Faith so
[10:55] by Revelation there's a demonstration of
[10:57] the inspiration that came to you at the
[11:00] incantation of the word of the Bride
[11:03] Nation but there's a when you have
[11:06] Revelation it's demonstration that
[11:08] that's when you really you're living it
[11:10] out you're not it's not an impersonation
[11:12] that's the alliteration that I could
[11:13] have ended on but the uh so the issue is
[11:17] obedience and if there's not obedience
[11:19] it's a question of do you really believe
[11:21] it's a question of faith and you may
[11:24] profess Many religious works like I did
[11:26] this and I did that and I did this and I
[11:28] did that but he says their Works were
[11:31] not build these Works were not building
[11:34] anything and Jesus is going to get into
[11:37] a parable of Foundations and so Jesus is
[11:40] showing a key to a firm foundation I I
[11:43] believe these three verses here are just
[11:45] as critical to understanding verses 24-
[11:48] 27 as verses 24- 27 are critical to
[11:52] understanding it you've got to these
[11:54] parts are very very important he's
[11:55] showing us the key to a firm foundation
[11:58] and it's obedience through
[12:00] Revelation there's got to be obedience
[12:03] according to Revelation because if it's
[12:05] just according to education that's just
[12:06] imp
[12:07] personation right so in Luke 11: 27- 28
[12:13] it says and it came to pass as he spake
[12:14] these things a certain woman of the
[12:17] company lifted up her voice and said
[12:19] unto him blessed is the woman that bear
[12:21] thee and the paps which thou Hast sucked
[12:24] but he said now think of how that's
[12:25] giving honor and glory and praise bless
[12:28] the woman and bless the bless the church
[12:29] and Bless the Virgin Mary blessed is
[12:32] this he says but he said yay rather
[12:34] Christ now yay rather blessed are they
[12:37] that hear the word of God and keep it
[12:40] right it's like someone saying oh your
[12:41] mom is awesome your mom is blessed your
[12:43] mom is great and give honor to your mom
[12:45] and she should be revered and she should
[12:47] be blessed he
[12:48] say my mom no blessed is the one that
[12:51] hears the word and keeps it so in the
[12:53] face of this praise that seems to give
[12:56] lip service and would be honoring the
[12:59] message of the hour and giving credence
[13:01] and and glory to something this is a
[13:04] question of honoring the Lord with your
[13:06] lips but not your
[13:08] life and this is not the right kind of
[13:10] building or you're not building on the
[13:12] right kind of foundation this Foundation
[13:14] of just presuming this Foundation of of
[13:17] of really not being serious that you
[13:19] could just say oh bless the woman that
[13:21] bear thee said no blessed is the one
[13:22] that hears my word and does it not
[13:24] everyone that cast out Devils is going
[13:26] to be in the kingdom of God but it's the
[13:27] one that hears the word and does his and
[13:30] does it now that's pretty uh that's a
[13:33] pretty interesting statement and we'll
[13:34] come to it maybe more here in a second
[13:36] especially when you say well doesn't the
[13:38] word tell us that we can C we should
[13:39] cast out devils and doesn't it say that
[13:41] we could should do this and do that but
[13:44] yet he saying well that's not that's not
[13:46] the
[13:48] point in James chapter 1:22 it says be
[13:51] ye doers of the word and not hearers
[13:53] only deceiving your own s so one that
[13:56] hears and does not do deceives
[13:58] themselves and it's a product of Deceit
[14:01] therefore again we see this contrast to
[14:03] Revelation or understanding that a
[14:05] hearer who does not do is deceived but
[14:08] one who hears and does is one that's
[14:11] operating by
[14:12] Revelation and it should be pointed out
[14:14] that in the parable of both Builders
[14:17] both heard the
[14:18] sayings both were inspired to build both
[14:22] lived in what they built but only one
[14:26] obeyed is that isn't that remarkable
[14:28] though they both hear the sayings of the
[14:31] Lord they both begin to build they both
[14:34] enter into the shelter for a place of
[14:37] security and rest but only one actually
[14:41] obeyed in Romans 2:13 for not the
[14:44] hearers of the law are just before God
[14:47] but the doers of the law shall be
[14:50] justified that that just to be just is
[14:53] it uh and I want to come to it more in a
[14:56] moment but let me just make this
[14:57] connection just in just Justified and
[14:59] Justice relate to righteousness to be
[15:02] just it's one that lives according to
[15:04] the word therefore they're righteous to
[15:06] be just is one that's right or correct
[15:08] and so it's rooted in the concept of
[15:09] righteousness the foundations be
[15:11] destroyed what can the just or the
[15:13] righteous
[15:15] do in 1 John CH 3:
[15:19] 6-7 whosoever abideth in him sinth not
[15:22] whosoever sinth hath not seen him
[15:25] neither known him there's a there's that
[15:27] sin is unbelief
[15:30] and therefore those that don't believe
[15:32] don't know him they haven't their eyes
[15:35] haven't been opened to see him so if the
[15:38] if you see the results of sin or the
[15:41] evidence of unbelief or the symptoms of
[15:44] unbelief it can be rooted in a lack of
[15:46] faith a lack of Revelation little
[15:48] children let no man deceive you he that
[15:50] doeth righteousness is righteous even as
[15:54] he which the suggestion is it's Christ
[15:55] even as Christ is righteous he that
[15:59] doeth righteousness is righteous he that
[16:03] does Justice is just he that does uh
[16:06] good is good he that is doing the will
[16:09] of God is in the will of God he that
[16:12] does the word of God is the word of God
[16:15] so I think it's important to kind of
[16:16] catch this this uh theme in the
[16:19] scripture Jesus says those that hear the
[16:22] word and don't do it they are workers of
[16:24] iniquity they are they are sinful they
[16:26] are unrighteous but he that hears the
[16:28] word word and does it he's
[16:31] righteous so there is this to me I'll
[16:34] just throw it out there for you to chew
[16:36] on a little bit or
[16:38] Ponder think of the difference then
[16:40] between the wonderful
[16:43] works that and that word wonderful is
[16:45] dunamis it's powerful these powerful
[16:47] works and how they're not the same as
[16:49] the righteous works of God you can do
[16:52] many wonderful Works in his
[16:55] name right and brother BR even says
[16:57] there's a righteous unart of the name so
[16:59] people can have access to the power
[17:01] through the name but it not be
[17:04] righteousness it's powerful works it's
[17:06] wonderful works it's casting out Devils
[17:08] it's prophesying in his name do many
[17:10] wonderful Works powerful works but
[17:12] Christ is saying there's a difference
[17:14] between those types of things in the
[17:17] righteous works of
[17:20] God again I'm preaching on why Houses
[17:23] full you ought to think of yourself as a
[17:25] house you should think of your families
[17:27] as a home as a house a household
[17:29] and also a church amen these wonderful
[17:32] works are not the same as the righteous
[17:34] works of God the works that were being
[17:35] done here in their totality in the day
[17:38] he said was
[17:39] iniquity Psalms 145:17 the Lord is
[17:43] righteous in all his ways and holy in
[17:45] all his
[17:46] works so the works of the Lord could not
[17:49] be uh would not be guilty of failing the
[17:53] will of God and righteousness I want you
[17:55] to think about it this way it's the
[17:57] reality that's in God it's the reality
[17:59] that's been created by God and and and
[18:01] sustained by God and ordered by his word
[18:05] right he's righteous and holy in all his
[18:07] works and in all his ways so
[18:09] righteousness is the reality of God it's
[18:11] how he thinks it's how he acts whatever
[18:14] God does is right whatever he does is
[18:17] just whatever he says is truth and so
[18:20] righteousness is that godlikeness it is
[18:22] God whatever he does is there
[18:25] unrighteousness with God
[18:27] no when he commands something to be done
[18:29] is it unrighteous no no matter how
[18:31] horrific it may seem to us as
[18:32] individuals he's
[18:35] God and in Galatians chapter 5: 5 and
[18:38] Jesus even saying he that hunger thirst
[18:41] after
[18:42] righteousness shall be filled there's
[18:44] this righteousness
[18:46] becomes an
[18:48] aspiration Beyond just doing wonderful
[18:52] works you know what can we do Jesus what
[18:55] can we do to work the wonderful works of
[18:56] God believe on him who he has sent
[18:59] knowing that real belief will uh follow
[19:01] in conduct and action so it says for we
[19:04] through the spirit wait for the hope of
[19:06] righteousness by
[19:08] faith and one thing we like to emphasize
[19:10] quite a bit when we mentioned
[19:12] righteousness is righteousness is the
[19:13] state of him who is as he ought to be to
[19:17] be righteous to be to be as you ought to
[19:20] be to be righteous is to be in the
[19:23] condition that God wants you to be
[19:25] in and it's righteousness according to
[19:28] Romans 3 322 it's righteousness by faith
[19:31] here in Galatians 5:5 the hope of
[19:33] righteousness by faith it's
[19:35] righteousness by faith so it's
[19:37] righteousness by
[19:39] Revelation that there's there's this
[19:41] faith that cultivates righteousness it
[19:43] comes from this place of understanding
[19:45] this is the beginning this is the
[19:46] foundation of faith and then it works
[19:48] itself into a manifestation of
[19:50] righteousness we through the spirit wait
[19:52] for the hope this is the expectation for
[19:54] those who have the spirit righteousness
[19:56] will come forth to do right
[20:00] am and if I could say this if we if we
[20:05] made
[20:06] it that we ought to prophesy that we
[20:10] ought to speak in tongues that we ought
[20:12] to do these different things and we
[20:14] ought to manifest a certain way then
[20:16] that's where we misde Define
[20:19] righteousness right because the
[20:22] righteousness is to be as you ought to
[20:24] be and then we kind of turn that around
[20:25] and make it out to where if you don't do
[20:27] this if you don't do this if you don't
[20:28] do this and we can't bring that back to
[20:30] the word to show no these are the works
[20:32] of righteousness not just the power that
[20:35] comes with his name but the reality of
[20:37] the life f 1 John 3:12 it says not as
[20:41] Cain he's talking about love and loving
[20:43] your brother who was of that Wicked one
[20:46] and slew his brother and wherefore slew
[20:49] he him why did Cain kill
[20:53] Abel Cain killed his brother because
[20:56] Cain's Works were evil and and Abel's
[20:59] Works were
[21:01] righteous here's the response of Cain to
[21:04] his brother when he act according to
[21:08] Revelation remember righteousness is one
[21:12] who is keeps God's word by faith so
[21:16] these righteous Works were works that
[21:18] were done by faith worship that was done
[21:21] according to
[21:23] Revelation and Cain murders his
[21:27] brother because his Works Cain's Works
[21:30] were
[21:31] evil and his brothers were righteous
[21:35] now again think of this Cain murdered
[21:39] Abel because of the comparison of
[21:41] Works Abel's is by Revelation Cain's is
[21:44] by
[21:45] inspiration and Cain's Works to offer
[21:48] the most beautiful sacrifice most well
[21:51] put together altar the most uh sensory
[21:55] pleasing experience when it comes to
[21:58] worship and so if you were kind of
[22:00] comparing the two you'd be
[22:02] like I'm going to go to Kane's
[22:05] Church uh Abel's yours is a mess quite
[22:08] frankly it stinks there's a lot of flies
[22:10] right a a and and you're and you would
[22:13] say that kan's got it put together he
[22:15] understands like I can post this on
[22:19] Instagram right I mean this belongs on
[22:21] Truth social or whatever this this here
[22:25] is worth it this to me is pleasing to
[22:29] the eye this is something that that I
[22:31] could get behind and so in comparison
[22:33] it'd be quite Frank it's kind of odd to
[22:35] say this was evil and this is righteous
[22:37] but the difference was Revelation that's
[22:40] all in Hebrews 11:4 by faith abble and I
[22:43] say that's all it's because it uh there
[22:47] was a difference in the actual worship
[22:48] but the reason why Abel did what he did
[22:50] is because he had Faith Hebrews 114 by
[22:53] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[22:55] excellent sacrifice than
[22:57] Cain by which he obtained witness that
[23:00] he was righteous God testifying of his
[23:03] gifts and by it being dead yet
[23:06] speaketh Abel by faith or by
[23:09] Revelation offered worship and
[23:12] sacrifice and because by Revelation he
[23:17] worshiped and manifested he obtained
[23:20] witness that he was righteous so you see
[23:22] the clear scriptural principle that when
[23:25] you act by faith that's righteousness
[23:27] when you act by Revelation that's the
[23:29] work of righteousness that's that's what
[23:31] God's looking for so God gives the
[23:33] Revelation he manifests the Revelation
[23:35] or it's the manifestation of the
[23:37] Revelation and now he obtains witness
[23:40] and as
[23:41] testation that he's
[23:45] righteous and now in Acts chapter
[23:48] 10 verses 34 to35 let me just wrap up
[23:51] this portion then Peter opened his mouth
[23:54] and saith this is the gospel going to
[23:56] the Gentiles of a truth I perceive that
[23:58] God is no respector of persons well what
[24:00] does he what does he uh look for but in
[24:03] every nation he that feareth him there's
[24:05] your faith there's your belief there's
[24:06] your respect and worketh righteousness
[24:09] is accepted with
[24:11] him this is what God looks for Faith and
[24:14] works by
[24:16] faith the kind of the James the James
[24:19] angle that a man is justified by his
[24:21] works that this is the outward
[24:22] manifestation of his Revelation in every
[24:25] nation where one fears God keeps his
[24:27] Commandments and demonstrates the the
[24:30] word of God and lives the life that's
[24:32] the one that obtains witness that he is
[24:35] righteous so there's a vast difference
[24:38] in the
[24:39] scripture in these uh Optics of
[24:42] wonderful
[24:44] works and the real belief and faith in
[24:47] God that is the work works of
[24:50] righteousness so Jesus saying that he
[24:53] that does the will of the father will
[24:55] enter into heaven not just everybody who
[24:56] can say they've done a lot of good work
[24:58] is going to enter into heaven but he
[25:00] that hears the word and does it so this
[25:02] is how he amplifies it in verse 24
[25:04] therefore whosoever heareth these says
[25:07] of mine and doeth them I'll give you an
[25:10] example of what I'm talking about I'm
[25:11] going to give you a parable to
[25:13] understand what I'm mean in verses 21 to
[25:15] 23 so the parable is giving us
[25:18] Enlightenment about this statement that
[25:20] those who do the will of God will enter
[25:22] and not just those that do wonderful
[25:24] works in the name of the
[25:27] Lord therefore whosoever heareth these
[25:30] sayings of mine and doeth them I will
[25:32] liken him unto a wise man which built
[25:36] his house upon a rock this term wise
[25:39] speaks of one that is Discerning and
[25:42] deliberate the word actually one of the
[25:44] ways it could be translated as
[25:46] Provident or prudent and that means this
[25:50] when one is wise in this
[25:53] sense it's not just knowing if you're
[25:56] wise and and you're Discerning it's not
[25:59] being able just to go to Wikipedia and
[26:01] look up a fact to be wise is not knowing
[26:05] history uh wisdom is not demonstrated in
[26:08] winning
[26:09] trivia that's not
[26:11] wisdom wisdom would be able to know by
[26:15] fact what's coming or using knowledge to
[26:19] anticipate something that is happening
[26:21] or
[26:22] transpiring and so to be prudent or
[26:26] providential it's to foresee wants it's
[26:29] to foresee lackings it's to foresee
[26:31] things and then making provision to
[26:33] supply them in
[26:35] advance so when you have discernment or
[26:37] you're providential or you're prudent
[26:40] you see something that's needful and in
[26:43] seeing the need you supply the provision
[26:46] you meet the need in advance before the
[26:48] lacking causes some failure amen like oh
[26:53] man we should bolster that up before the
[26:55] the monsoons come right and and then the
[26:58] monsoons come and guess what the tree
[27:01] the tree is laying over the car or the
[27:03] the the some fence fell down or
[27:05] something faed you're like
[27:06] ah I knew I should have put something up
[27:10] I knew I should have bll I put it should
[27:11] have put in another screw that's not
[27:13] wisdom sometimes that's just for that's
[27:15] just seeing the obvious but wisdom is
[27:18] acting in advance to secure against
[27:23] something that's what this wisdom is and
[27:25] I think it's very obvious in the
[27:27] scripture so I don't expect a lot of
[27:29] Wows and let's goes and come on this is
[27:32] amazing this is just the this is just
[27:34] the truth the plain truth of the
[27:36] scripture through Providence the wise
[27:38] man builds his house upon a rock and
[27:41] he's the example of one that knows and
[27:43] then
[27:45] does he's the example of one that looks
[27:47] at something goes oh there's a need here
[27:49] you know what I should probably make
[27:50] sure the need is filled and not wait
[27:52] till the winds are
[27:54] blowing but then in contrast we have in
[27:56] verse 26 and everyone that heareth these
[27:59] sayings of mine and doeth them not shall
[28:01] be liken unto a foolish man which built
[28:04] his house upon the
[28:09] sand this is in direct contrast where
[28:13] you could you could create these columns
[28:16] and show uh the check marks of what one
[28:18] does and what one doesn't do and this
[28:20] comparison between the two they both
[28:23] hear they both build they both live they
[28:27] both can endure the same
[28:29] storms so we'll come to that so there is
[28:32] this things that they are but there is
[28:35] one thing that's different one is wise
[28:36] and one is foolish means unknowing now
[28:39] foolish is to be not wise he's not
[28:42] prudent he doesn't fully understand now
[28:45] this is where I think the problem comes
[28:48] when it says that uh that we know him
[28:50] and we've seen him uh we kind of have
[28:53] this idea that it's just if we could
[28:55] just say well the message is right or
[28:57] William was a prophet or we can know the
[29:00] scripture we can know that Jesus Christ
[29:02] died for our sins and we can even
[29:04] believe that it's true and he rose from
[29:06] the dead and so we said well that's not
[29:09] ignorance but foolishness is knowing all
[29:11] that and not realizing the severity and
[29:14] the meaning and the implications and
[29:16] what it really means that he was a
[29:17] Vindicated prophet and what it really
[29:19] means is that the message is true and
[29:20] what it really means that he had to die
[29:22] on the cross and really what it means
[29:23] that he rose from the dead and what it
[29:24] means that you're a sinner and the need
[29:26] to be born again all those things so to
[29:28] be foolish is to not necessarily not
[29:30] know but to not have
[29:33] understanding as to not be
[29:36] providential somebody who looks at a a
[29:39] something a wall or a part of a building
[29:41] in a structure and just that example
[29:43] kind of came to me as I was ministering
[29:45] so I apologize if it's maybe not fully
[29:48] explained but if one sees a need in a
[29:51] structure and like oh my the winds are
[29:53] going to come later this year and that
[29:55] tree is going to fall or that Wall's
[29:57] going to fall or this covering is going
[29:58] to fall I should either cut the tree
[30:00] down now or I should I should put up
[30:02] some more structures I should have a
[30:03] contractor come look at it a person who
[30:06] sees that and doesn't do anything even
[30:09] though they said they saw something was
[30:12] lacking they clearly could not
[30:15] appreciate the need to do something
[30:18] about
[30:20] it or if they did that's the real
[30:24] foolishness cuz they didn't do anything
[30:26] about it that's why
[30:28] foolishness to say oh man if I don't cut
[30:31] that tree down now it's going to fall
[30:32] right across my my brand new electric
[30:35] car and and my Tesla and it's it's going
[30:39] to happen and I know it's going to
[30:41] happen and then you just go right inside
[30:44] and you say man I sure hope there's a
[30:45] firmware update where the car just kind
[30:47] of knows it's coming and just backs
[30:52] out and so if we bring that back to
[30:56] Caine brother bam talks about Cain
[30:59] creating an incubator well that's kind
[31:00] of maybe my the way I'm saying an
[31:02] incubator which is nice and cozy and
[31:04] warm and everything looks good but he
[31:05] said it doesn't it's not going to bring
[31:06] forth righteousness can't produce a sun
[31:08] denominations cannot bring forth life
[31:11] it's an incubator Cain did not have
[31:14] Revelation the reason why he slew his
[31:16] brothers he did not have Revelation so
[31:19] Cain's initial offering as we want to
[31:21] look at kind of this difference it could
[31:23] be excused because of the lack of
[31:25] Revelation am I right
[31:28] am I right it's got to be a meme for
[31:31] that right a gift I could use there's he
[31:34] doesn't know Abel does know Cain doesn't
[31:37] know so Cain's initial effort to please
[31:40] the Lord initial effort to worship we
[31:41] could say hey man he doesn't know any
[31:43] better I mean we wouldn't want to just
[31:44] call Cain a fool day one and Abel's over
[31:47] there hacking away at an animal a a and
[31:49] C's over there just creating a real
[31:51] beautiful Altar and guess guess which
[31:52] service Mom and Dad attended probably
[31:54] like what's going on with Abel over
[31:56] there gu is a
[31:58] psycho and and so you could maybe excuse
[32:01] it initially like I don't call Cain a
[32:04] fool Abel would be wrong to say you're a
[32:06] fool Cain Cain doesn't
[32:09] know but then he
[32:11] does and it's Cain's insistence on not
[32:14] obeying that demonstrates his
[32:16] foolishness yeah in the beginning we
[32:18] could say that it it was foolishness to
[32:20] him what Abel was doing and he was a
[32:22] fool to think that it was from the
[32:23] ground and he was lacking and there
[32:25] wasn't discernment there's a lot of
[32:26] things we could say about him but
[32:28] whenever he knows that's foolishness to
[32:30] insist on not
[32:32] obeying now maybe he abandons the fruit
[32:35] offering maybe abandons the altar maybe
[32:37] abandons worship and we'd say well
[32:39] that's not a good thing to do but the
[32:41] real foolishness is not in doing what
[32:43] God said to do and God says if you don't
[32:46] do else that's
[32:49] sin but he's telling them you got to you
[32:51] should obey so what did Cain he knew now
[32:55] God speaking to him if you just do as
[32:57] your brother did would you not well also
[32:59] be accepted which we could say he that
[33:01] hears and fears and works righteousness
[33:03] is accepted by
[33:06] God but if I could say this way Cain
[33:09] kind of knowing the surface of it you
[33:12] could have asked him Cain so what does
[33:13] God requir say blood con offering should
[33:16] be give the one that Abel gave the one
[33:18] my brother gave but he lacked the real
[33:20] concern concerning the truth he lacked
[33:24] an awareness of the consequences or at
[33:27] least did not appreciate them or didn't
[33:30] fear the
[33:31] consequences didn't respect
[33:34] them James chapter 4:1 17 therefore to
[33:37] him that knoweth to do good and doeth it
[33:39] not to him it is
[33:40] sin knowledge without practice is
[33:43] imputed to
[33:44] sin knowledge without obedience and
[33:47] that's really at the core of this
[33:48] Parable we I was Finding where the
[33:49] rabbis had these in their tradition oral
[33:51] tradition they had their traditional
[33:53] sayings of one who knew the law but
[33:55] didn't practice it is like a tree with
[33:57] no root and and therefore does not
[33:59] produce any fruit and so it's kind of
[34:01] Jesus is building on the same idea that
[34:03] they would have had within their oral
[34:05] tradition that one who has knowledge but
[34:07] doesn't act in it that's sin that's
[34:09] iniquity so just as righteousness is imp
[34:13] imputed H uh uh by faith and by faith
[34:16] you work and it's imputed as
[34:18] righteousness imputed to him that
[34:20] believes and to the faithful and to
[34:22] those that have faith one who knows but
[34:25] does not do it's imputed a sin
[34:28] you see the Counterpoint he that has
[34:30] Revelation in Acts it's imputed is
[34:32] righteousness according to the word he
[34:34] that has Faith it's imputed to him is
[34:36] righteousness but he that hears and does
[34:38] not do to him it is sin for to know to
[34:41] do good and doeth it not to him it is
[34:44] sin and when the Bible uses the phrase a
[34:47] foolish man and I'm realizing now I'm
[34:49] running out of time and that we may uh
[34:53] I'll amplify some more of this maybe
[34:54] Wednesday night this I the the
[34:56] consequence of
[34:58] um Tom Foolery or foolishness a foolish
[35:01] man to use that phrase I liken him unto
[35:05] a foolish man obviously it's a wise man
[35:06] versus a foolish man we see that
[35:09] contrast but it's wanting us to
[35:11] understand it's a term to indicate
[35:13] something lacking in the character of
[35:14] the person something lacking in their
[35:18] wisdom that there's a wise man and
[35:20] there's certain characteristics of one
[35:22] that is wise and there's a foolish man
[35:24] uh and there's certain characteristics
[35:26] of a man who is a fool so it's an ual
[35:28] condition that has very real symptoms
[35:30] and consequences it's not just putting
[35:32] labels and saying those of you who uh
[35:35] starting starting with you go one two
[35:37] one two all the odds here and all the
[35:38] evens there I mean it's not just
[35:40] something
[35:42] random this is rooted in real wisdom or
[35:44] real Folly Proverbs
[35:48] 14:16 a wise man fearth and departeth
[35:51] from evil but the fool rageth and is
[35:56] confident
[35:58] a
[35:59] fool no can be very inspired very
[36:04] emotional he rageth in other words this
[36:07] is there's some motivation a man a wise
[36:09] man fears and and and separates himself
[36:13] from something that is evil that's the
[36:15] wisdom of genuine knowledge that's the
[36:17] wisdom of running into a situation be
[36:19] like whoa I'm getting out of here right
[36:23] this is bad this isn't good or this is
[36:25] going to happen the monsoons are coming
[36:26] or this is evil God warns about this and
[36:29] and this is what a wise man does he sees
[36:30] it and he gets away from it he gets
[36:32] himself out of the situation but it says
[36:34] the the fool
[36:37] rageth and is
[36:40] confident and so and if you look at it
[36:43] this way it's kind of like the the wise
[36:45] man comes up against the situation says
[36:47] whoa this is bad I'm getting out of here
[36:49] and the foolish man goes whoa this is
[36:52] bad I'm going to tackle this I'm going
[36:54] to correct this I'm going to I can
[36:56] handle this and so he rages and it's a
[36:59] false
[37:00] confidence because it's based on false
[37:02] knowledge there's a false security the
[37:05] wise man fears and departs the wise man
[37:08] sees ahead of time as providential he's
[37:10] prudent he acts in advance knowing
[37:12] something's
[37:13] coming even if it means you get you
[37:16] remove yourself from the
[37:17] situation so there's that it's a false
[37:20] confidence versus a genuine knowledge
[37:22] now I I feel I need to stop here in not
[37:25] even halfway through but I want to just
[37:26] stop here and say this this I hope that
[37:29] you can begin to make very practical
[37:32] rubber meets the road conclusions about
[37:34] why houses
[37:36] fall when it comes to exercising wisdom
[37:39] and exercising
[37:41] foolishness and how there is this
[37:43] thought of righteousness by
[37:46] faith and sin by foolishness or sin by
[37:50] intellectual Faith or sin by
[37:53] carnality Sin Sin with knowledge without
[37:56] an appreciation so it's the wisdom
[37:58] versus uh uh versus this intellectual or
[38:01] you could say reverse it and say carnal
[38:03] wisdom versus Faith because there's this
[38:06] other other way that we could begin to
[38:07] talk about human knowledge and Human
[38:09] Experience and those things but it says
[38:11] this in Proverbs 15: 5-6 I'm wanting you
[38:14] to begin to glean uh we could maybe we
[38:17] could maybe hit a spot where I'll speed
[38:19] up and we can can be done so we don't
[38:21] just transition into communion this this
[38:25] afternoon but in Proverbs chapter 15: 5
[38:28] and 6 a fool despiseth his father's
[38:31] instruction so going back to what Jesus
[38:34] said I want to make this point now when
[38:37] Jesus gives this Parable this is what
[38:39] he's drawing
[38:40] from the the the ti the connection
[38:43] points to uh to wisdom and foolishness
[38:47] that it's principles that would have
[38:48] been very rooted and grounded especially
[38:49] to a scribe or a Pharisee or the
[38:51] teachers of the law the rabbis they
[38:53] would have understood what the Psalms
[38:55] said what the Proverbs said and what the
[38:56] Old Testament said
[38:58] and this idea of foolishness and wisdom
[39:00] I mean scripturally the worst thing you
[39:01] could be is
[39:02] foolish it's the worst thing you could
[39:05] be a fool despiseth his father's
[39:08] instruction let me just say this uh you
[39:11] can brag about being a virgin but if
[39:12] you're foolish means
[39:14] nothing
[39:16] right a fool despiseth his father's
[39:19] instruction but he that regardeth
[39:21] reproof is
[39:24] prudent a fool despiseth his father
[39:27] father's instruction but he that
[39:29] regardeth this instruction regardeth the
[39:31] correction understands that when a
[39:33] parent says don't do this or give some
[39:35] instruction understand there must be a
[39:37] reason why this is being said there must
[39:38] be some kind of uh warning or there's
[39:41] there's a benefit in even giving respect
[39:44] to Authority there's even a benefit in
[39:46] acknowledging when one who has greater
[39:48] wisdom or authority or position uh uh
[39:50] expresses something a certain way then
[39:52] I'm going to regard it I'm going to
[39:53] respect it I'm going to acknowledge it
[39:55] I'm going to I'm going to digest it and
[39:57] and that is wise man hears the reproof a
[40:00] wise man considers what he's looking at
[40:02] whereas a fool despises
[40:06] it and then it says in the house of the
[40:08] righteous is much treasure now this is
[40:11] you know write this down in the house of
[40:13] the righteous is much treasure but in
[40:16] the revenues of the wicked is
[40:19] trouble wow some of us may have a lot of
[40:24] revenues large money
[40:28] right but it's
[40:30] trouble but then in the house of the
[40:32] righteous there's much
[40:35] treasure wisdom according to the
[40:37] scripture that Insight the foresight by
[40:40] faith wisdom Prudence being providential
[40:42] seeing things ahead of time
[40:44] understanding something that you uh if
[40:47] you want to say it's factual historical
[40:48] but it's being able to take the things
[40:50] that we know and been have given an
[40:52] understanding or given knowledge of it's
[40:54] having the understanding and revelation
[40:56] of what you've heard and seen to know
[40:58] that it projects into the future and it
[41:00] dictates and tells me these are the
[41:03] right things to do right now for what's
[41:05] to
[41:07] come wisdom securely builds the house
[41:12] and then richly fills the house securely
[41:15] builds it and then fills it that's what
[41:18] wisdom does the house of the righteous
[41:21] is much treasure in this house are a lot
[41:25] of good things a lot of beautiful things
[41:28] uh
[41:30] Treasures but in the house of a fool
[41:32] though he might have a lot these
[41:34] revenues are trouble so if I could
[41:36] before we go to the next part go to
[41:38] verse 24 and then read again and get
[41:40] further down verses 25 and 26 uh uh so
[41:43] we could and then verse 27 we could see
[41:46] this contrasting Revelation brings
[41:50] security o this obedience which is born
[41:53] from trust now in this image I want you
[41:56] to catch this here is one who hears the
[41:59] word of God and does it and Jesus says
[42:03] he's like a man who builds his house
[42:06] upon a rock in other words he
[42:09] trusts what he heard am he trust it when
[42:14] the Lord says to do something I trust
[42:15] him when he says the right way to be
[42:18] baptized is in the name of the Lord
[42:19] Jesus Christ I trust him when he says
[42:21] that our lives ought to be holy and
[42:22] women ought to dress a certain way I
[42:24] trust them when he says that men ought
[42:25] to be a certain way I trust them when
[42:26] the word God says something I trust him
[42:29] I don't start going I don't know I don't
[42:31] know uh-uh no I don't
[42:33] know and then just kind of build a
[42:36] structure that looks like a house of God
[42:40] but isn't because I didn't trust God's
[42:42] plans I didn't trust his blueprints God
[42:45] says build a
[42:47] house this way and those that hear it
[42:51] and want to do it they build it this way
[42:53] the others hear it and say oh you want a
[42:55] house well that looks good but I'll
[42:57] build you a
[42:59] house and so Revelation brings security
[43:02] because it's obedience which is born
[43:04] from trust foolishness brings
[43:08] trouble
[43:09] foolishness brings
[43:12] trouble all right how many how many want
[43:14] me to continue just raise your hands got
[43:16] to get them up get them up there's just
[43:17] no way those that don't want me to will
[43:19] win the day so the motion
[43:24] carries I know that wouldn't maybe EX
[43:27] exactly be parliamentary procedure
[43:29] but we had enough votes to continue that
[43:32] will be the only chance you had thank
[43:35] you in Matthew chapter 7 veres 24- 27
[43:39] I'm just kind of looking at where I'm at
[43:40] hopefully I can finish this he says
[43:42] therefore whosoever heareth these
[43:43] sayings of mine and doeth them I will
[43:45] liken him unto a wise man which built
[43:47] his house upon a rock let me tell you
[43:49] who I'm talking about that's in the
[43:51] Kingdom he's the one that hears and
[43:53] trusts and does the word and the rain
[43:57] descended and the floods came and the
[43:59] winds blew and beat upon that house and
[44:02] it fell not for it was founded upon a
[44:06] rock and everyone that heareth these
[44:08] sayings of mine and doeth them not shall
[44:10] be likened unto a foolish man which
[44:12] built his house upon the sand thinking
[44:16] Luke it might say the earth and the rain
[44:18] descended and the floods came and the
[44:19] winds blew and beat upon that house and
[44:22] it fell you'll notice that the exact
[44:24] same things happen the rains come floods
[44:28] come the winds come one stands or one
[44:32] Falls not and the other one
[44:36] Falls and great was the fall of
[44:43] it a wise man's
[44:47] Foundation I I need to build on a lot of
[44:49] the things we've already expressed in
[44:50] some of these
[44:51] prior prior sermons on laying a good
[44:54] foundation but a wise man found wise men
[44:57] Foundation as we look at the building of
[44:58] the temple it was that habit of doing
[45:02] things the right way it was hearing the
[45:05] plans hearing the word and knowing that
[45:07] if God says to do something it's wise to
[45:10] do it and not just pay lip service to it
[45:13] this wise men's Foundation even if you
[45:15] could use some language as this pattern
[45:16] of good works in the founding because it
[45:20] says it was founded upon a rock settled
[45:23] and grounded it was established and that
[45:25] word means laid down a foundation or it
[45:28] even refers to the first principles of
[45:30] something it was founded in its
[45:32] Beginnings its principles it was built
[45:34] it was based upon something it had some
[45:37] logos to it it had some conviction it
[45:39] had some understanding it wasn't just
[45:41] knee-jerk reaction it just wasn't
[45:43] religion but it was founded upon a rock
[45:47] and its Beginnings it had the right kind
[45:49] of beginning it was operating by the
[45:51] right kind of principles and so the wise
[45:53] man was doing work in the beginning to
[45:56] secure it against the future floods he
[45:59] did things in the beginning that put him
[46:00] in a stronger position in the presence
[46:02] of rain he was doing things on a daily
[46:05] basis in the absence of wind that was
[46:08] going to give him strength when the
[46:10] winds
[46:11] came and so this Foundation gave
[46:14] strength to the house the foundation
[46:17] supported the house the rock gave power
[46:21] and strength to the house and kept it
[46:23] from falling in other words it kept it
[46:25] from ruin ruin amen
[46:28] the rain above the floods from below the
[46:30] winds from every side in every way this
[46:34] house was attacked beaten from every
[46:36] side but it
[46:39] stood and in 1 Timothy chapter 6: 19
[46:42] this is the very
[46:43] image that this scripture could draw
[46:45] from laying up in store for themselves a
[46:47] good foundation against the time to come
[46:50] that they may lay hold on eternal
[46:53] life the pattern of good works the
[46:56] things that Paul was expressing to
[46:57] Timothy that one ought to do who has the
[46:59] Holy Ghost and how they ought to live
[47:01] and to act it's laying up in store for
[47:03] themselves a good foundation against the
[47:06] rain to come against the floods to come
[47:09] against the winds to
[47:10] come that you may
[47:13] stand if great was the fall of the house
[47:16] then great was the stand of the house
[47:20] and it was because it was built upon a
[47:23] rock if I could say this and this is
[47:25] maybe forecasting a little a little bit
[47:27] but failing if I say failure under
[47:30] pressure is often the result of poor
[47:32] effort in the beginning not what's
[47:35] happening in the
[47:37] moment this is very practical failure
[47:40] under pressure is often the result of
[47:43] the the lack of effort in the beginning
[47:45] of something and not because of your
[47:47] sincerity in the moment not because your
[47:50] appreciation of the winds in the moment
[47:52] and your fear of the flood in the moment
[47:54] in your in the moment the wind the
[47:55] monsoon comes and you realize the palty
[47:58] just like it's born to do is going to
[47:59] fall and you're looking at you're going
[48:01] this is going to fall on my
[48:02] Tesla and now there's some anxiety in
[48:05] that moment you appreciate the situation
[48:07] you're concerned you want to do
[48:09] something about it right you see
[48:12] something happening in your family and
[48:14] you realize your daughter at 18 years
[48:15] old is going a certain way or your son
[48:17] is doing something and in the moment
[48:19] you're like this isn't right this
[48:20] shouldn't happen I don't want my
[48:22] children to do this and you realize your
[48:24] family's fractioning a little bit and
[48:25] something bad happen you think Lord I
[48:27] didn't want this to happen I knew this
[48:29] was wrong I knew there was a real
[48:31] problem here I was praying and I was
[48:33] sincere your attitude in the moment
[48:35] isn't the reason why it fail it was your
[48:37] attitude when she was
[48:39] 12 it was your lack of concern oh I
[48:42] could just stay home I don't have to go
[48:44] to church anymore we don't have to make
[48:46] the effort I don't care if kids eat free
[48:48] and then you pay the price one day
[48:50] because it didn't matter at the
[48:52] time and in the moment you care in the
[48:55] moment you're worried in the moment you
[48:56] realize I may lose my son to the world I
[48:59] may lose my family my spouse is no
[49:01] longer happy with the Lord and
[49:02] something's wrong and in the moment
[49:03] you're sincere in the moment you're
[49:05] calling unto God in the moment your
[49:07] heart is broken and you see it for what
[49:09] it is but you didn't have wisdom
[49:12] before that's
[49:14] right any Builder can tell you that
[49:18] Foundation problems are the worst
[49:21] problems you get they've made some
[49:23] remarkable progress in their ability to
[49:26] repair
[49:27] foundations but if you there's certain
[49:31] things that if you have a problem with
[49:32] it and it's remarkable what they can do
[49:34] nowadays with the the framing and the
[49:36] remodeling and you could look at a house
[49:38] these days and you could a house that's
[49:39] just got walls everywhere loadbearing
[49:41] walls everywhere and they can engineer
[49:43] it now just to remove all of them it's
[49:45] going to cost you some Gus but they can
[49:47] do it they can engineer around it but if
[49:50] the foundation can't be repaired the
[49:52] foundation's destroyed it's like man you
[49:54] could put $150,000 into this uh powder
[49:57] bathroom to remove that wall but uh the
[50:01] foundation's
[50:03] horrible I I can't even I can't even
[50:05] engineer this in a way because the slab
[50:07] won't support it it's not it wasn't done
[50:09] right to begin
[50:13] with Foundation problems in a building
[50:16] are often the result of improper design
[50:18] in the beginning not knowing the ground
[50:20] you're working with not knowing the way
[50:23] to the building that's going to be going
[50:24] on it poor construction of the slab so
[50:28] when you have Foundation problems it's
[50:29] like man I I I I knew I shouldn't have
[50:31] had a king California King bed it ruined
[50:34] my Foundation no it's probably not the
[50:36] weight of the bed and how much you weigh
[50:38] even though it's a pretty good argument
[50:40] right but it's something was wrong in
[50:43] the design wasn't made to support this
[50:45] kind of weight it wasn't made to support
[50:47] uh uh um it wasn't it wasn't built
[50:51] correctly you the vote was to
[50:54] continue and I know I'm getting really
[50:57] close to an hour or do you start
[50:59] counting as soon as I get up here while
[51:00] we're singing like am I as I'm singing
[51:02] are you like you're on the clock brother
[51:03] Aaron because if I was a lawyer that's
[51:06] exactly what I would do the phone's
[51:07] ringing I see the caller ID I go and I
[51:10] wait as long as I can because the
[51:11] clock's already started right and then I
[51:12] answer and then I act like I don't know
[51:14] who it is right for a few minutes like
[51:16] oh yes yes yes that's right and they ask
[51:19] what's that clicking noise in the
[51:20] background like don't think about
[51:23] it I don't really have any clients that
[51:26] pay me by the I wish there was a magic
[51:27] time
[51:28] clock so Luke 6: 46- 48 so if you didn't
[51:33] start when I got up here I have not yet
[51:35] quite preached an hour because I think I
[51:36] was right around 10:41 when I officially
[51:39] began to preach some may argue I still
[51:41] haven't started yet thank you Luke 6: 46
[51:46] to 48 here's the a different rendering
[51:49] of this very passage and why call ye
[51:51] Lord Lord and do not the things which I
[51:54] say and rebut like well we cast out
[51:57] Devils he's like well that's not what
[51:58] I'm talking about we prophesy on your
[52:00] name well that's not what I'm talking
[52:01] about we do many wonderful works and
[52:03] Powerful works well that's not what I'm
[52:06] talking about I've been doing a personal
[52:08] study on some things and I've and it's
[52:10] just amazing uh of how much
[52:14] Christianity's become about
[52:16] church it's like just because it has a
[52:18] CH in it doesn't mean we got to make it
[52:20] all about
[52:21] church it's churchianity anymore right
[52:24] and it's all about church and it's the
[52:26] the health of the church which is
[52:27] important and and the health of the body
[52:30] is as far as a local body and it almost
[52:32] in a way asks the individual to
[52:35] sacrifice their own spiritual leadership
[52:37] in their lives and their own spiritual
[52:38] health for the health of the church
[52:40] thinking that if the church is healthy
[52:42] then everybody else is healthy but
[52:44] that's the that's the
[52:47] Mirage and and so this is I if I can say
[52:50] this the things that Jesus is rebuking
[52:53] and saying that's not enough can make a
[52:54] really good church
[52:57] can make a real powerful looking church
[53:00] but that's not what he's talking about
[53:02] says whosoever cometh to me and heareth
[53:03] my says and doeth him I will show you to
[53:06] whom he is like he is like a man which
[53:08] built an house and then what does he do
[53:11] and digs
[53:13] deep he dug
[53:15] deep and laid the foundation on a
[53:19] rock so it wasn't that he just found a
[53:21] rock and began to build but he he did
[53:23] the right thing in as a far as an
[53:25] engineer he did the right thing in terms
[53:27] of uh uh premeditating the structure he
[53:30] found Bedrock he found Solid Ground and
[53:33] then he he tethered the foundation upon
[53:35] which the structure would be built to
[53:37] that so it was Stone upon stone rock
[53:40] upon Rock maybe even to where he's
[53:42] drilling he's digging in he's chipping
[53:43] in he's allowing it to go in a way where
[53:45] it's anchored to the
[53:47] Rock not just even put upon a rock it
[53:50] wasn't just a tent spread out on a rock
[53:52] this is a firm foundation built upon a
[53:55] rock
[53:57] he dug deep what did Brother bam say was
[54:00] the problem in the indictment they don't
[54:02] dig down deep enough to get in the
[54:04] spirit of the Revelation what did Jesus
[54:06] say in what the parable that the word is
[54:08] sown but they have no deepness of Earth
[54:11] the word is not getting deep enough to
[54:12] that Bedrock of faith and Revelation
[54:15] they didn't dig down deep enough but the
[54:18] wise man digs
[54:20] deep he looks at it he considers it he
[54:23] gets beneath the surface he can
[54:25] appreciate the
[54:27] foundation and then the flood arose and
[54:29] the stream beat vehemently I love just
[54:31] how much more descriptive the the the
[54:33] flood arose the stream beat against it
[54:35] in this way it's almost as if it's just
[54:37] a torrent that comes from the earth
[54:39] beats against that house and could not
[54:41] shake
[54:42] it for it was founded upon a
[54:47] rock to say that he dug
[54:49] deep it means he had to search for
[54:53] Bedrock he didn't just find a rock and
[54:55] build on it
[54:57] he dug for it he said I'm not just going
[55:00] to build in a place that's convenient
[55:01] I'm going to dig for it I'm not just
[55:03] going to take it for its surface meaning
[55:05] I'm not just going to take it for how it
[55:06] presents I want to understand I want to
[55:07] know it I want to dig into it I want to
[55:09] get Dusty with it it implies searching
[55:11] for that Bedrock digging for that stone
[55:14] chipping away at it so that it can make
[55:16] a
[55:18] foundation I mean I've in all the
[55:20] traveling we've done I don't think I've
[55:22] ever just found a slab in nature like
[55:26] wow this should make a perfect 2700t
[55:29] house and the Footers are already there
[55:31] and it's just just build on it there
[55:33] would be a if it was on a rock it even
[55:36] implies maybe a rock face and a Rocky
[55:38] outcropping and he'd have to level it
[55:40] chip away at it he knew he had good rock
[55:43] but he had to
[55:44] work let me just say this it's easier
[55:47] just to kind of find level ground and
[55:48] start
[55:49] building it's easier just to kind of
[55:51] find a spot well this looks good and
[55:53] just throw it up but it's harder to dig
[55:54] deep and find bedrock it's harder to
[55:57] pray about it it's harder to dig into it
[55:59] call upon God get in the spirit of the
[56:01] revelation of
[56:04] it it's easier just to have no
[56:06] forethought or effort in the beginning
[56:08] to guard against what may come well
[56:11] build there there's plenty of room it's
[56:12] got a great view just build there that's
[56:14] flat this will work kind of even we
[56:16] could kind of rake this out we can just
[56:18] kind of smooth it out go ahead and just
[56:19] build there and there's no thought about
[56:23] the future and there's no effort in the
[56:25] beginning
[56:27] to prepare for what may come Proverbs
[56:29] 223 and4 a prudent man foresee the evil
[56:32] and hideth himself but the simple pass
[56:34] on and that's not simple in a positive
[56:36] way just someone who cannot appreciate
[56:39] Truth The Prudent foresees the evil and
[56:42] hides himself the simple pass on and are
[56:44] punished I hope you can begin to kind of
[56:46] see this theme of how that the foolish
[56:50] can have a lot of revenues but it's
[56:52] trouble there is this concept of
[56:54] foolishness that leads to rule ruin
[56:56] foolish that leads to failure
[56:57] foolishness that leads to a fall but
[56:59] there's wisdom that leads to standing
[57:01] and being upheld a prudent man
[57:04] foresees the wise anticipates he
[57:07] realizes beforehand he expects and then
[57:10] he's ahead of time amen he's doing it he
[57:13] he's getting it before it
[57:15] happens but the evil hides himself or
[57:18] the evil uh cannot hide himself and so
[57:21] he's punished so by humility and the
[57:23] fear of the Lord are riches and honor in
[57:25] life do you see that through wisdom the
[57:27] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[57:28] wisdom through humility and the fear of
[57:30] the Lord are riches honor and life if
[57:32] you want to have riches honor in life
[57:35] then fear God keep his Commandments
[57:37] humble yourself to his precepts do what
[57:39] he says to do for therein is riches
[57:41] honor and life if you want riches honor
[57:44] honor his word fear Him keep his
[57:45] Commandments you want honor honor the
[57:47] Lord respect him serve him do what he
[57:49] says you want life listen the thing that
[57:51] people want more than anything now is to
[57:54] live to have honor and to have riches
[57:55] and the only place it can be found is in
[57:57] humility in the fear of the
[58:01] Lord the wise anticipate and therefore
[58:04] they prepare brother Brandman the sermon
[58:06] glorified Jesus say that's where God's
[58:08] Church God's built his church every time
[58:10] what on the solid rock on
[58:12] Revelation he says it's the only place
[58:15] he can build it it was upon the
[58:17] spiritual revealed truth of God job had
[58:20] it right when he that lightning Flash
[58:23] and he h the Revelation his Redeemer
[58:24] lived he says I want you to notice
[58:26] every man that ever has the spiritual
[58:29] revealed truth of the will of God makes
[58:31] preparation for the
[58:33] fulfilling I hope that goes down deep
[58:36] tonight way down on the fifth rib on the
[58:38] left
[58:42] side hope it goes down deep notice if
[58:45] it's ever revealed to you that God's
[58:47] going to heal you you just get ready for
[58:49] it that's all amen spiritual revealed
[58:55] truth it's it's demonstrated in the
[58:58] dramatization of Abraham buying all the
[59:00] things he would need for a baby it's
[59:03] demonstrated in Noah in actually
[59:05] building the ark God tells them rain's
[59:08] going to Water's going to fall from the
[59:09] sky and he's not watching for rain
[59:11] clouds to get into action he builds
[59:15] it he builds that Ark he does it there's
[59:19] this anticipation of the spiritually
[59:21] revealed truth of God puts you in action
[59:23] if I could dramatize it this way if one
[59:25] of you only had one
[59:27] foot and and you had bought shoes your
[59:29] whole life and always threw away the
[59:31] other one and God revealed to you that
[59:33] he was going to give you another foot
[59:34] you'd keep the other pair the next time
[59:36] you bought
[59:37] shoes right you you wouldn't you
[59:40] wouldn't throw it away you'd like oh the
[59:42] foot's
[59:51] coming I'm just thinking of the image of
[59:53] a shoe that's been worn for like 10
[59:54] years and God gives you your foot one
[59:56] morning so you put on the other Air
[59:58] Jordan right and like one is perfect and
[1:00:01] pristine collectible the other one's
[1:00:02] been W for 10 years but what a
[1:00:08] testimony you those new shoes know it's
[1:00:10] a new
[1:00:13] foot in Isaiah chapter 59: 19 because he
[1:00:16] says every man that has a spiritually
[1:00:18] revealed truth makes preparation for the
[1:00:20] fulfilling now let's think of that in
[1:00:22] terms of anticipating and being prudent
[1:00:24] there's things that God says if you do
[1:00:26] you'll be blessed in and there's things
[1:00:28] that he warns us about this is why
[1:00:30] houses fall there's something we can
[1:00:32] draw from this I've just got to my hour
[1:00:34] let me hurry so shall they fear the name
[1:00:36] of the Lord from the West and his glory
[1:00:38] from the rising of the sun this is what
[1:00:39] I want you to look at when the enemy
[1:00:41] shall come in like a flood the spirit of
[1:00:43] the Lord shall lift up a standard
[1:00:45] against him this is us being
[1:00:47] forewarned the word time and time again
[1:00:50] tells us if you do this this is going to
[1:00:51] happen if you don't do this this is
[1:00:53] going to happen regardless of what you
[1:00:55] do this is what's happening there's
[1:00:57] things that we could take from the word
[1:00:58] of God to know these are Bedrock these
[1:01:00] are principles these things are
[1:01:02] truth and as Jesus said the flood came
[1:01:05] and beat upon that house but it could
[1:01:07] not shake it because it was founded in
[1:01:10] the beginning it was built upon
[1:01:12] something that could withstand the flood
[1:01:14] it was designed anticipating the flood
[1:01:17] it was designed anticipating of the
[1:01:20] Winds it was designed and built in such
[1:01:22] a way that it would withstand the trials
[1:01:24] to come later on and when the the enemy
[1:01:26] shall come in like a flood the spirit of
[1:01:28] the Lord shall lift up a standard
[1:01:30] against him and the Bible is telling us
[1:01:33] that the storms of persecution the
[1:01:35] storms of Temptation the storms of
[1:01:36] disappointment will try the house will
[1:01:40] beat against the house it'll beat
[1:01:41] against you it'll beat against your
[1:01:42] family it'll beat against the church it
[1:01:44] will
[1:01:46] come Peter says be sober be vigilant
[1:01:48] because your adversary the devil as a
[1:01:50] roaring lion walketh about seeking whom
[1:01:52] he may devour we have been forewarned
[1:01:55] amen and so in light of the fact that we
[1:01:58] have an enemy who is like a lion
[1:02:00] presenting as a lion and even his
[1:02:02] ministers as angels of light because we
[1:02:04] have that enemy he says be
[1:02:07] alert and be calm amen that's what sober
[1:02:12] means he tells us to be sober and
[1:02:14] Vigilant so there's got to be this
[1:02:16] soberness to where you can appreciate
[1:02:19] it's kind of like they're saying that a
[1:02:21] fifth of whiskey will uh significantly
[1:02:24] reduce the awareness of a heart attack
[1:02:26] and so it's not that we want to see
[1:02:29] problems coming so we intoxicate
[1:02:30] ourselves so that we're not
[1:02:33] fearful like oh my goodness I just can't
[1:02:35] handle this give me some tranquilizers
[1:02:36] or I want to go take a nap or I want to
[1:02:37] just pop some pills to settle my heart
[1:02:39] down to be sober is to be able to see
[1:02:42] something to be alert and to remain calm
[1:02:44] in the face of
[1:02:46] it not be like I believe there's a lion
[1:02:50] after me the devil's after me every day
[1:02:53] oh my goodness what are we gonna do
[1:02:56] right but it's like yeah there's a devil
[1:02:57] he's real and I'm going to be calm and
[1:03:00] I'm going to be vigilant which means to
[1:03:02] be at watch less through your laziness
[1:03:05] or indifference ruin comes to be alert I
[1:03:08] know it's coming I know there's winds
[1:03:09] coming I know there's storms coming I
[1:03:11] know there's rains coming and I'm going
[1:03:12] to be vigilant in other words I'm going
[1:03:13] to do what I need to do to prepare for
[1:03:16] the storm I'm going to do what I need to
[1:03:18] do for when the lion the the the as a
[1:03:20] lion comes I'm gonna do it
[1:03:23] now the storm wants to wear on you
[1:03:26] wants to push on you wants to push you
[1:03:28] into failure it it it wants to impose
[1:03:32] itself on the horizon I'm coming to get
[1:03:34] you and then he wants you to begin to
[1:03:36] think oh whoa I don't know if he can
[1:03:39] survive this I don't know if we can get
[1:03:40] through this I don't know what's going
[1:03:42] to happen and then once it comes you say
[1:03:44] well just stand stand sure stand where
[1:03:46] you are stay where you are the trouble's
[1:03:47] the Lion's coming I see him I see the
[1:03:49] devil coming I see the devil coming just
[1:03:50] stay where you are stay where you are
[1:03:51] and then he begins to beat on the house
[1:03:52] and everything begins to shake he wants
[1:03:54] you to panic
[1:03:56] he wants to be like oh I don't know I
[1:03:57] don't I don't know if I can trust I
[1:03:58] don't know what are we going to do what
[1:03:59] are we going to do what are we going to
[1:04:00] do that's what he wants to do the storm
[1:04:03] wants to wear on you and then push you
[1:04:04] into a panic push you into failure it's
[1:04:07] an
[1:04:10] influence uh brother Michael jenin
[1:04:14] shared this quote last week it's just so
[1:04:16] powerful I just felt it fit perfectly
[1:04:18] here in the sermon a hidden life in
[1:04:21] Christ just think of that image that
[1:04:23] being hidden in him them days he dwelt
[1:04:25] in his tab Tabernacle and today he
[1:04:27] dwells in you as his
[1:04:30] Tabernacle but we must make this place a
[1:04:33] dwelling not an outer Court place or the
[1:04:36] first holy place but we must live with
[1:04:38] God in the holiest of holies a
[1:04:40] consecrated hidden life alone quiet with
[1:04:44] God soberness but yet
[1:04:47] vigil uh sober yet
[1:04:50] Vigilant he says we become too
[1:04:53] excited upset
[1:04:56] about too many things and the way that
[1:04:58] it struck me is we get really excited
[1:05:00] and happy about things and we get really
[1:05:02] disappointed and discouraged about
[1:05:04] things and he says we get too excited
[1:05:06] about some things too disappointed
[1:05:08] because of other things no we're not
[1:05:10] sober we're being intoxicated oh things
[1:05:12] are great things are awesome any
[1:05:14] wonderful any good and then next thing
[1:05:16] you know I just don't even know I don't
[1:05:18] don't even know I'm don't even know
[1:05:19] anymore and it's like woo woo we get too
[1:05:23] excited we're up and we're down we're up
[1:05:26] and we're down he says we get too
[1:05:28] excited and too upset about too many
[1:05:31] things we're letting the storms
[1:05:33] influence us we're letting the the lack
[1:05:36] of clouds on the horizon like all right
[1:05:38] I think we're good here I think we're
[1:05:39] good we can do this all right relax
[1:05:41] let's enjoy ourselves this is good
[1:05:43] everything's wonderful 65 degrees today
[1:05:45] it's not going to get hot this year this
[1:05:46] is great right and you don't ever have
[1:05:49] the AC checked you don't make sure your
[1:05:51] air conditioner is working like we just
[1:05:52] open the windows in Phoenix right year
[1:05:54] round
[1:05:56] and there's no care concern and then
[1:05:58] next week when it's 95 it's like what
[1:06:00] are we going to do what are we going to
[1:06:01] do who's the brother of the church that
[1:06:02] does
[1:06:04] AC I came up with an awesome business
[1:06:06] name
[1:06:10] ACDC okay all
[1:06:15] right we get too excited or upset about
[1:06:18] too many things it shows there's
[1:06:20] something lacking notice how he says it
[1:06:23] it shows there's something lacking he
[1:06:25] says the church ought to be a million
[1:06:26] miles up the road to what it is now
[1:06:29] we're still back down in the Adolescent
[1:06:31] age fussing fighting quarreling stewing
[1:06:35] right it's whatever's in the moment when
[1:06:37] we ought to be consecrated hidden away
[1:06:39] in the holiest of holies with God to me
[1:06:42] this is one of the most practical things
[1:06:43] we could take away from this morning is
[1:06:45] that why do houses fail because we're
[1:06:48] influenced by the
[1:06:50] moment that whatever's taking place at
[1:06:52] the time becomes what we lean into and
[1:06:54] what we experience
[1:06:56] in what dictates our mood instead of
[1:06:58] knowing honey we put in the work we
[1:07:00] trained up our children in the way that
[1:07:02] they should go this is the time we trust
[1:07:04] him this is the time that we look back
[1:07:06] and know we did all that we could
[1:07:10] do to be excited the strong feelings of
[1:07:13] enthusiasm to get hyped up eager have
[1:07:15] some increased energy then all of a
[1:07:18] sudden you're upset you're disappointed
[1:07:19] you're drained you're worried you're sad
[1:07:20] you're unhappy what does it mean you're
[1:07:22] not resting on the foundation you're not
[1:07:25] hid away in the holiest of holies you're
[1:07:27] still in some other court that's
[1:07:28] influenced by the elements either
[1:07:30] dependent on natural light or human
[1:07:33] man-made light or sunlight you're still
[1:07:35] caught in these other Realms and you're
[1:07:37] not certain or sure about where you're
[1:07:40] living am and what you need is
[1:07:44] revelation what you need is
[1:07:52] trust if I can say this I I I I to
[1:07:55] finish this before noon if I can I don't
[1:07:57] know if I'll be able to but I want to
[1:07:58] really go fast building your house on a
[1:08:02] rock is doing what's right in the moment
[1:08:05] you're living doing what's right right
[1:08:07] now she just well it's kind of late I
[1:08:09] haven't been taken this serious I was
[1:08:10] raising the message got married in the
[1:08:12] message I believe it I'm not going
[1:08:14] anywhere this is what I do this is what
[1:08:16] I this this is me and you realize wow I
[1:08:18] haven't really fully I don't even listen
[1:08:20] to the message you know I but I believe
[1:08:22] it you when it's quoted I just assume
[1:08:24] it's he said it right and you just and
[1:08:26] all of a sudden you realize oh no I'm so
[1:08:28] many years down the road I haven't done
[1:08:31] anything well okay you have no
[1:08:34] Foundation right
[1:08:37] start to build the right foundation is
[1:08:41] to do today what you know you ought to
[1:08:44] do it's the lack of indifference it's
[1:08:46] not being lazy it's casting out
[1:08:50] fear we
[1:08:52] can we can secure peace look at Isaiah
[1:08:56] 32 we can secure peace and safety right
[1:08:59] now by doing what God's word says we
[1:09:01] should do and Isaiah 32 verses 17 and 18
[1:09:04] in the work of righteousness shall be
[1:09:06] peace see how it connects back into the
[1:09:09] wonderful Works versus the righteous
[1:09:10] works of God the works of righteousness
[1:09:12] shall be peace when you do what God says
[1:09:16] there's peace in it it shall be peace
[1:09:18] that's why we hear the saying that I'm
[1:09:20] better off over in a war Tor land in a
[1:09:23] disease infested land I'm better off
[1:09:25] being somewhere where the economics
[1:09:26] aren't as good being in his perfect will
[1:09:29] than I am behind the most secure walls
[1:09:31] with the greatest food and the best
[1:09:32] amenities out of his will because the
[1:09:35] work of righteousness shall be peace and
[1:09:37] the effect of righteousness quietness
[1:09:39] and Assurance
[1:09:41] forever I don't want to just have this
[1:09:43] dunamis and this power and wonderful
[1:09:45] works but I want to have righteousness
[1:09:48] so I can have peace and then the effect
[1:09:50] of righteousness is this quietness and
[1:09:52] Assurance forever amen and my people
[1:09:55] shall dwell in Peaceable habit Peaceable
[1:09:58] habitation and in sure dwellings and in
[1:10:00] quiet resting places to me the very
[1:10:04] works of righteousness are the same as
[1:10:06] the works of the wise Builder the one
[1:10:08] who built his house upon a rock was
[1:10:11] dwelling in a sure place a Peaceable
[1:10:14] habitation a sure dwelling it was a
[1:10:16] quiet resting place the the house had
[1:10:20] become a home just because he had a home
[1:10:22] didn't make the world not the world just
[1:10:24] because he had had a place that he could
[1:10:26] retire doesn't mean the storms weren't
[1:10:27] raging on the
[1:10:29] outside the work of righteousness is to
[1:10:32] give you peace in your
[1:10:34] dwelling I'll say this I'm going to use
[1:10:35] a term that I want to build on Wednesday
[1:10:37] night but being prudent Provident or
[1:10:40] proactive gives us Assurance when the
[1:10:42] storms
[1:10:45] come but I want to I want to close with
[1:10:48] just a I have a few more things here I
[1:10:50] may may save some of
[1:10:52] it I may save some of it for another
[1:10:57] time but I want to read this
[1:10:59] statement was from a a minister in
[1:11:02] England who made this comment about this
[1:11:04] was his his sermon or his commentary in
[1:11:07] the 1800s he died just before brother
[1:11:10] Brandon was born I
[1:11:12] believe and as the winds come he said
[1:11:16] the we read
[1:11:18] how the winds beat vehemently in this
[1:11:22] one place the stream beats vehemently he
[1:11:24] phrased it this way because I'm wanting
[1:11:27] us to have this assurance if you if
[1:11:29] you're on a
[1:11:31] foundation what make what cause it will
[1:11:34] make a house to stand is to be sure
[1:11:37] about what you're built
[1:11:39] on if in the moment that things happen
[1:11:41] you're uncertain that's when you're
[1:11:42] going to move even if you're even if
[1:11:44] you've got Bedrock if you're uncertain
[1:11:47] or sure of your foundation that's when
[1:11:49] you begin to WAND a little bit that's
[1:11:51] when you begin to move that's when you
[1:11:52] begin to get a little bit worried but if
[1:11:55] you you have the right foundation
[1:11:57] there's an
[1:11:58] assurance and this is such a beautiful
[1:12:01] thought he says but what can the
[1:12:03] hurricane
[1:12:06] do what can the winds do what will the
[1:12:10] floods of the rain
[1:12:11] do but he says what can the hurricane do
[1:12:15] just what the elements do in
[1:12:17] nature whatever they do not break they
[1:12:21] consolidate your trials will only
[1:12:24] consolidate
[1:12:26] they will consolidate your principles
[1:12:28] your affections your hopes they will
[1:12:31] make you on the Rock yourself a
[1:12:35] rock oh I hope you can hear what I
[1:12:38] saying don't fear the
[1:12:39] hurricane thank God if you're on a rock
[1:12:43] the way it'll only it won't destroy you
[1:12:45] or separate you it'll consolidate you
[1:12:48] amen it it will consolidate your faith
[1:12:51] your conviction there's nothing like
[1:12:53] oppressing iness to turn coal into a
[1:12:56] diamond there's nothing like the press
[1:12:58] to make you sure that your roots are
[1:13:00] going down deep that's right it'll make
[1:13:04] you on the Rock yourself a rock
[1:13:08] judgments may fall from above like the
[1:13:10] descending rain disappointments
[1:13:13] afflictions persecutions May swell
[1:13:15] around you like Roy rolling floods
[1:13:17] Temptations May Buffet you all the
[1:13:20] Myster with all the mysteriousness of
[1:13:23] the invisible wind oh love that
[1:13:25] beautiful
[1:13:26] poetry judgments like rain persecutions
[1:13:29] like floods ATT Temptations like a
[1:13:32] mysterious wind yet Luke says they could
[1:13:35] not shake it the strength of the Rock is
[1:13:40] in the
[1:13:40] believer he passes all his troubles onto
[1:13:44] his
[1:13:45] rock hallelujah that's the concept in
[1:13:48] the engineering that's the concept of
[1:13:50] trusses and beams that's the con the the
[1:13:53] concept of building correctly it's going
[1:13:55] to pass it all down to the foundation
[1:13:58] the strength of the Rock is in the
[1:13:59] believer he passes all his troubles onto
[1:14:03] his
[1:14:04] Rock and from his Rock he draws his
[1:14:09] strength and the Eternal
[1:14:11] unchangeableness of the foundation makes
[1:14:13] the poorest weakest stone that has once
[1:14:17] fastened to it unshaken and impregnable
[1:14:20] as the stone of Jehovah
[1:14:22] amen when you're built upon a
[1:14:26] rock then you pass all your troubles to
[1:14:29] the Rock The Rains beat upon it you
[1:14:33] stand because it reverberates the winds
[1:14:37] the waves the floods and it's passing
[1:14:39] all the energy to the Rock to the Rock
[1:14:42] to the Rock and you yourself who's
[1:14:44] planted on the Rock become a rock
[1:14:46] yourself am consolidates your faith it
[1:14:48] consolidates your principles that's what
[1:14:50] ought to be happening in a time of
[1:14:51] pressure and trouble if you're founded
[1:14:53] on a rock you don't say this isn't the
[1:14:55] time to get
[1:14:56] slack this is the time to get firm this
[1:14:59] isn't the time to panic this isn't the
[1:15:01] time to get shaken this isn't the time
[1:15:02] to worry this is the time to
[1:15:05] stand so it makes you double down on
[1:15:07] your faith it makes you dig in more to
[1:15:09] the word of God it makes you more
[1:15:10] Vigilant to apply the token that's what
[1:15:15] happens houses fall when they're not
[1:15:17] built on the right
[1:15:19] foundation the fall of this house was
[1:15:22] when the Builder wasn't sure of his
[1:15:23] foundation
[1:15:25] didn't make sure of his foundation was
[1:15:27] not proactive as what we're
[1:15:32] expressing the Bible says as the
[1:15:33] worldwind passes so is the wicked no
[1:15:37] more but the righteous is an everlasting
[1:15:45] Foundation we can
[1:15:47] trust in our
[1:15:49] foundation if you're not trusting isn't
[1:15:51] that where you should be
[1:15:53] prayed is that where isn't that where
[1:15:55] you should be digging down
[1:15:58] deep Brothers if you could come to your
[1:16:06] instruments I I I am just going to skip
[1:16:08] some things we'll hold it over to
[1:16:09] Wednesday
[1:16:10] night but let me close with this
[1:16:16] statement I think it's also from the
[1:16:18] same Minister I I just remember reading
[1:16:22] it and copy and pased it in my in my my
[1:16:25] memory
[1:16:26] here I think it's come from the same
[1:16:28] person in a different context different
[1:16:30] commentary on a different
[1:16:32] scripture a different sermon
[1:16:35] actually and I I I want you to just take
[1:16:38] this into your hearts I want to
[1:16:40] encourage you as we close this I think
[1:16:41] there's been a lot of practical things
[1:16:43] that we could begin to draw from that
[1:16:45] why houses
[1:16:47] fall is either because of a lack of a
[1:16:50] foundation or an A a trust and a
[1:16:54] security in the
[1:16:56] foundation and as we look at that in a
[1:16:58] very practical way like how does that
[1:17:00] look what does that look like brother
[1:17:01] that I got a good foundation and I'm
[1:17:02] trusting the foundation in other words
[1:17:04] you're living by principles you're
[1:17:06] living by conviction you're living by
[1:17:08] faith and you have a revelation of what
[1:17:10] the will of the Lord is and so you're
[1:17:13] using this spiritual insight and
[1:17:15] discernment to look at situations in
[1:17:17] your life and knowing these are things
[1:17:19] that God ask us to do and in doing it
[1:17:22] there's righteousness there's reward
[1:17:24] there's benefit there's protection
[1:17:26] there's security there's peace very real
[1:17:27] things that come and the reason why our
[1:17:30] house loses its peace it loses its
[1:17:32] stability the reason why we have uh
[1:17:34] separations in our marriages and
[1:17:36] difficulty with our children the reason
[1:17:37] why the world swims into our house and
[1:17:39] begins to infect our entertainments
[1:17:41] begins to infect our family time and the
[1:17:42] family's scattered and we're not
[1:17:44] together anymore and we're not going to
[1:17:45] church anymore the reason why we're
[1:17:47] infected in our homes and discouraged
[1:17:49] and despondent and all those things is
[1:17:51] because of what we failed to do befor
[1:17:54] amen
[1:17:56] it's not living in the uh the life of
[1:17:58] God and living in power living in
[1:18:00] Victory and everything's great and
[1:18:01] you've done everything you should do
[1:18:02] everything you do and you built for this
[1:18:04] time you built for this moment you built
[1:18:05] your house upon a rock you built it by
[1:18:07] Revelation you're living by faith and
[1:18:09] then one day you just open up the door
[1:18:10] and the floods come up and just wipe you
[1:18:13] away and and it's
[1:18:16] over you might be able to go back in
[1:18:19] your life and say I can go back to
[1:18:21] around this time in this time when the
[1:18:24] work wasn't
[1:18:28] done but I want to encourage you this
[1:18:30] way
[1:18:34] because there's a reason why the house
[1:18:36] is
[1:18:37] shaken so then you just you just fix the
[1:18:40] problem right you come back to your
[1:18:43] Bedrock you get the Revelation that this
[1:18:45] is this is the word of God and this is a
[1:18:48] statement I'd like to end on it says the
[1:18:49] reign of Temptation May descend upon him
[1:18:52] with great violence and force upon the
[1:18:55] one who built his house upon a
[1:18:58] rock every person's life is a
[1:19:02] house your testimony and your character
[1:19:05] is the building of a legacy which is
[1:19:07] upon that
[1:19:09] rock therefore you must be born again
[1:19:12] first there's no spiritual success
[1:19:13] outside of the new birth experience the
[1:19:15] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:19:16] you that becomes your bedrock and then
[1:19:18] as a husband and wife in a home in your
[1:19:20] marriage that's your Bedrock you both
[1:19:23] have that same experience are you you
[1:19:25] should and then as you begin to build
[1:19:27] your home it comes back to that it comes
[1:19:28] back to Christ on Christ's Solid Rock we
[1:19:31] stand as a family this is the what the
[1:19:33] guiding principles of our family life
[1:19:35] and those things it comes back to this
[1:19:36] is what we're building
[1:19:39] upon so the reign of Temptation May
[1:19:41] descend upon you you as an individual
[1:19:45] you as a family even us as a church with
[1:19:47] great violence and force but shall not
[1:19:50] beat us down he says shall not beat him
[1:19:52] down he shall be made able to Bear the
[1:19:56] whole force of
[1:19:58] it the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:20:01] against him the floods of persecution
[1:20:04] may be cast after him but shall not
[1:20:07] carry him
[1:20:08] away the stream of
[1:20:11] corruption may run strong against him
[1:20:15] yet shall not overset him and the wind
[1:20:19] of diverse and strange doctrines May
[1:20:21] blow hard upon him but not cast him
[1:20:26] down listen some damage he may receive
[1:20:29] by these several things but shall not be
[1:20:33] Resto destroyed he may be shaken by them
[1:20:37] but not so as to be removed off of the
[1:20:39] foundation on which he has laid yay he
[1:20:41] may fall from some degree of
[1:20:44] steadfastness of his faith but not so as
[1:20:46] to fail totally and
[1:20:48] finally the reason is because he is
[1:20:51] founded upon the rock Christ Jesus who
[1:20:54] is sure and immovable whence it appears
[1:20:57] that such a man acts the wise and
[1:20:59] prudent part it may be truly called A
[1:21:02] wise
[1:21:04] man this ought to be our confidence
[1:21:07] going forward I believe it has been our
[1:21:09] confidence but a reminder today I'm
[1:21:12] built upon a rock and there may be some
[1:21:15] who look in our lives and realize I've
[1:21:17] fallen from steadfast some steadfastness
[1:21:19] I've let the circums of Life dictate my
[1:21:22] righteousness and dictate my conviction
[1:21:24] and my uh uh my attitude towards the
[1:21:26] word of God and my uh uh discipline and
[1:21:29] serving the lord and doing all the
[1:21:30] things that I know I ought to do go back
[1:21:31] to like those six basic foundational
[1:21:34] principles of Christian Living the
[1:21:35] things that we know we ought to do and
[1:21:37] all the specifics of it we can say man I
[1:21:40] I've got a little bit cold I've dabbled
[1:21:41] a little bit in the world I I am not
[1:21:44] going to say to you you're not a
[1:21:45] Christian I'm not going to say to you
[1:21:47] you've never been anywhere to begin with
[1:21:48] what I'm saying is if you're founded
[1:21:50] upon a rock if you've got that get back
[1:21:54] down on the
[1:21:55] Bedrock because though you may suffer
[1:21:58] some damage you will not be destroyed
[1:22:01] though you may feel that the house
[1:22:02] shakes at times it cannot be removed
[1:22:05] from the foundation you may fall from
[1:22:08] some steadfastness but you will not fail
[1:22:10] totally and finally you will get back up
[1:22:15] again the reason is because you're
[1:22:17] founded on Christ Jesus The
[1:22:20] Rock The Eternal unchangeableness of
[1:22:23] your foundation
[1:22:25] makes you a poor and weak
[1:22:27] Stone unshakable and impregnable just as
[1:22:32] much as God's
[1:22:34] Throne why houses fall we'll pick up on
[1:22:37] part two on
[1:22:38] Wednesday but it's rooted in these very
[1:22:41] concepts of Faith righteousness which
[1:22:44] was by faith and all the Optics and
[1:22:47] pretense of religion or the succumbing
[1:22:50] to The Winds of the
[1:22:52] world and what we need be is
[1:22:55] proactive the wisdom is to see ahead of
[1:22:58] time that God's
[1:23:00] provided he will with the Temptation
[1:23:02] make a way of Escape does it say you
[1:23:05] won't be tempted the rains will fall the
[1:23:07] floods will come the winds will blow it
[1:23:09] will beat vehemently the enemy will
[1:23:10] enemy will come in like a flood but the
[1:23:14] spirit of the Lord will lift up the
[1:23:16] standard against it the stand together
[1:23:18] today
