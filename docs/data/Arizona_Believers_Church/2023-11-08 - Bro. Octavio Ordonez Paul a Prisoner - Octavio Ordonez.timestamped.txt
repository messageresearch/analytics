[0:01] now if we can go a little bit into uh
[0:04] the Apostle Paul now the Apostle Paul
[0:08] was a tremendous man um he he as a young
[0:12] man he he wanted to serve the Lord and I
[0:16] think it's a A fitting for today uh as a
[0:19] young man he wanted to to serve the Lord
[0:22] he did everything he could to serve the
[0:25] Lord uh he went to the best schools his
[0:28] parents paid for the best education he
[0:31] could have and uh he was a a good man
[0:35] and he did everything that he could
[0:37] according to what he knew at the time
[0:40] right he he was a man of God back then
[0:44] for what he knew at that time doing the
[0:47] best he can trying to learn everything
[0:49] he could about the word of God right he
[0:52] was taught under the best teachers at
[0:55] the time the teacher was
[0:57] gel or pronounced something like that he
[1:01] was a tremendous man right and and no
[1:04] one uh or put it this way when when he
[1:09] graduated or when he finished he
[1:12] finished at the age of about 35 years
[1:14] old but he started studying at the age
[1:17] of about 10 to 12 years old and he
[1:20] studied for all that time and when he
[1:23] was ready he uh he thought well now I'm
[1:26] going to go serve the Lord so he went
[1:29] out and got instructions by the
[1:31] Pharisees by the priests at that time to
[1:34] go out and and serve the
[1:37] Lord but he was a he was an error right
[1:42] but he didn't know right that's the
[1:45] problem that he didn't know he was in
[1:48] error now we all have a opportunity to
[1:52] serve the Lord we can say We'll serve
[1:55] him or we won't serve him right we have
[1:58] something that's called the free moral
[2:01] agency imagine that free moral agency I
[2:05] think those are really good words you
[2:08] are free to say yes or you are free to
[2:11] say no God's not going to make you serve
[2:16] him you have an opportunity to say yes
[2:19] I'll serve him or no I'll stay where I'm
[2:23] at Adam and Eve had the same
[2:26] opportunity Adam and Eve were just doing
[2:29] just spine right until Eve made the
[2:32] wrong decision right and it threw the
[2:35] whole world into chaos the whole world
[2:38] lost because of Adam and Eve they had an
[2:42] opportunity to stay with the word but
[2:45] instead they chose not to they chose to
[2:49] doubt the word and when they doubted the
[2:51] word it threw everybody out right threw
[2:54] the
[2:55] whole bath water out the
[2:58] door they had an opportunity as as just
[3:02] as each and every one of us has an
[3:05] opportunity this evening to serve the
[3:07] Lord or to criticize right we have an
[3:11] opportunity to learn or to say well I
[3:14] know that already what are you teaching
[3:17] me I'm not teaching you anything
[3:19] anything I'm just reviewing to you what
[3:21] the word says the word says that we have
[3:25] that opportunity today every young man
[3:28] every young woman has an opportunity to
[3:32] serve the
[3:34] Lord now we see the world situation
[3:37] right now we see it's getting pretty
[3:38] rough out there so we don't know how
[3:41] much time we have so that's the
[3:45] opportunity that we have today is to uh
[3:49] serve the Lord if we want to or not now
[3:53] let me give you a little bit of history
[3:56] of the Apostle Paul I'm sure most of us
[3:58] already know
[4:00] the Apostle Paul when he served the Lord
[4:03] he he actually had to be thrown out of
[4:07] the synagogues he was beaten up he was
[4:11] left for dead outside he shook it all
[4:14] off he went back
[4:15] inside he was thrown in jail for two
[4:18] years without being charged for
[4:21] anything he was
[4:24] Shipwrecked he was bitten by a Viper and
[4:27] he was sent over to Rome
[4:30] and he had to sit there for years and
[4:32] years and years and at one time he
[4:35] decided to write to filimon filimon
[4:40] filimon you know they they made fun of
[4:42] brother BR when he said that word in
[4:45] that message you can hear that they made
[4:47] fun of them oh boy he better be
[4:52] careful amen and
[4:56] uh anyway where was
[4:58] I uh he he was a prisoner okay and uh
[5:03] when he wrote that letter he said I'm a
[5:06] prisoner of Jesus Christ right he was in
[5:10] jail everything seemed like that was the
[5:13] end for him and yet he didn't worry
[5:15] about those things brother Bram says it
[5:18] was him that was in prison for Jesus
[5:22] Christ right he was in prison for the
[5:25] Lord he could not move he could not do
[5:27] anything unless the Lord told them what
[5:30] to do right isn't that something where
[5:33] we ourselves can throw away our own
[5:36] thoughts our own beliefs our own wants
[5:39] our own desires and do the will of God
[5:42] isn't that something if we can learn
[5:44] from the Apostle Paul for what he did
[5:47] and what he
[5:48] said now let's let's take a look at the
[5:52] Apostle Paul before he was
[5:56] converted then we'll look at when he was
[5:58] converted and then we'll look at what he
[6:00] did after he was converted this was a
[6:03] tremendous man this is a new testament
[6:07] Apostle New Testament Star right this
[6:10] isn't just an ordinary person this was a
[6:14] man of God right but how did he start
[6:17] out he as well as much as we know right
[6:21] now is that he he was taught by the best
[6:24] of the best right we know that we have a
[6:27] free moral agency with whether we want
[6:29] to serve God or not serve god so let's
[6:33] let's look at something here and slide
[6:36] two uh Joshua
[6:39] 24:15 I kind of like what it says here
[6:43] and if it seemed evil unto you to serve
[6:46] the Lord choose you this day whom ye
[6:49] will serve oh isn't that something where
[6:53] the gods which are your fathers serve
[6:57] that were on the other side of the flood
[6:59] or the gods of the amorites in whose
[7:02] land ye dwell but as for me and my house
[7:07] we will serve the Lord isn't that
[7:11] something you have to make that choice
[7:14] you have that free moral agency to serve
[7:19] the Lord slide three now we're all born
[7:23] a free moral agent to make any decision
[7:26] that we wish to God justly does that
[7:30] because he must put every man in the
[7:32] same basis or he put the wrong man on he
[7:36] put the first man on the wrong basis
[7:40] that he put a free moral
[7:43] agency let me read that again he put the
[7:46] first man on the wrong basis that he put
[7:50] on the free moral agency see we're just
[7:54] exactly tonight like Adam and Eve
[7:57] there's no different right and wrong
[8:00] sets before either one of us either one
[8:03] of us has a decision to make are you
[8:07] serving the lord or you're not going to
[8:09] serve the Lord there is no difference
[8:12] right and wrong set before either one of
[8:16] us life and death we can make our choice
[8:20] it's up to you to make it
[8:23] see that's the way Adam and Eve did and
[8:26] see and they made the wrong choice
[8:30] and now by that put the whole race of
[8:33] the human race under death and penalty
[8:35] of
[8:38] death and then God came down in the form
[8:41] of man and took that death and paid the
[8:45] penalty of
[8:46] death that the his subjects that desired
[8:50] to be free could go free you can go free
[8:55] everyone that desires to go free can go
[8:58] free
[9:03] amen now and let's look at uh Hebrews
[9:06] chapter 12 verse 1 and two wherefore
[9:10] seeing we also are comass about with so
[9:14] great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[9:17] aside every weight and every sin which
[9:19] does so easily besch us and let us run
[9:23] with patience the race that is set
[9:25] before us looking unto Jesus the author
[9:28] and finisher of for Faith who for the
[9:31] joy that was set before him endured the
[9:34] cross despising the shame and sit down
[9:37] at the right hand of the Throne of God
[9:42] Amen as I just expressed if your light
[9:45] will prove your life will prove exactly
[9:48] what sight you're on I don't care what
[9:51] sight you say you're on Amen what you do
[9:56] every day proves what you are you've
[9:58] heard of of the old saying your life is
[10:00] so
[10:01] loud I can't hear your testimony oh
[10:05] isn't that
[10:06] something a
[10:09] prisoner Paul a prisoner of Jesus
[10:13] Christ you know I just came back from
[10:15] Mexico on on
[10:17] Monday and uh we were at the
[10:21] border and we were stopped on this side
[10:25] of the Border thank God
[10:27] right and the the took us off the
[10:31] car at the at the
[10:33] customs and they searched all my car and
[10:37] they put us in a room about this size
[10:41] room and I thought wow isn't that
[10:44] something I get a taste of being a
[10:48] prisoner for Jesus
[10:51] Christ we couldn't get out the guys on
[10:54] the outside had guns they were looking
[10:57] through my car I go man if these guys
[10:59] guys want to they can keep us here for
[11:00] hours yeah so we better
[11:04] behave so we didn't we didn't say
[11:06] nothing we just kept calm after waiting
[11:09] three hours in
[11:10] line we had to wait another half hour
[11:13] there while they searched our
[11:15] car I thought
[11:17] well I guess I get a little taste of
[11:20] what the Apostle Paul was was talking
[11:23] about we were in prison it wasn't prison
[11:27] but it's close
[11:31] for preaching the word of God in
[11:35] Mexico and on the way back our own
[11:38] country held us up I thought that is so
[11:42] something no that is
[11:45] interesting imagine that uh it's
[11:48] supposed to be a free
[11:50] country but our liberties are so fine
[11:54] that they can be taken away so
[11:56] fast I mean we're not getting our
[11:59] churches burn like India or China or
[12:02] other countries I mean they are really
[12:05] suffering right but maybe one day we'll
[12:08] be like that I don't know I don't know
[12:11] we
[12:12] will but let me tell you the greatest
[12:15] stumbling block in the church is
[12:17] what people that say they're Christians
[12:20] when they're not that's right when you
[12:23] go before other people and you say yeah
[12:25] I'm a Christian and they see your
[12:26] actions they go well maybe I don't go to
[12:29] that church I'll go to this other church
[12:32] that's the biggest stumbling block and
[12:34] that's what brother BR says so the
[12:36] greatest stumbling block that the world
[12:39] has got is a man or a woman who
[12:42] professes to be a Christian at least
[12:45] live something different from the
[12:48] profession oh my slide number eight now
[12:53] the
[12:54] disappointments will come at the
[12:56] Judgment Now The Sinner the Bootlegger
[12:59] The Gambler the adulterous he won't be
[13:02] disappointed to hear his sentence read
[13:06] to depart into Everlasting fire he won't
[13:09] be
[13:10] disappointed but that fellow who is
[13:13] trying to hide himself behind some kind
[13:17] of a church
[13:19] profession that's the boy is going to be
[13:22] disappointed oh at the Judgment
[13:26] Day amen
[13:30] I got I got three bottles here we got
[13:33] plenty of
[13:39] time the one that keeps thinking he's a
[13:43] Christian but is not living the life
[13:46] worthy of a Christian is the one that's
[13:49] going to be
[13:50] disappointed isn't that something that
[13:53] professes to be a Christian and live
[13:55] some other way it'd be better for him
[13:58] that he never did even make any kind of
[14:01] professions started off than to start
[14:04] and live something different because
[14:06] he's the greatest stumbling block we got
[14:10] is for the professor that says that he
[14:14] is a Christian and live something
[14:17] different
[14:18] [Music]
[14:20] amen always don't judge your life by how
[14:24] much power you have to perform miracles
[14:29] and we don't judge ourselves by how much
[14:31] knowledge you have of the word but
[14:34] always judge yourself look
[14:37] back and take inventory of what kind of
[14:40] fruits that life you presently live in
[14:44] now is
[14:46] buing now you can have two masters if
[14:50] you have two masters you're going to
[14:52] have one upset and the other one be
[14:55] happy brother baham says on Matthew
[14:59] 26 or 6:24 no man can serve two masters
[15:04] for he either will hate one and love the
[15:07] other or else he will hold to one and
[15:10] despise the other you cannot serve God
[15:13] and
[15:15] Mamon what is the reflection of your
[15:19] life what has It produced the reflection
[15:23] of your life what has It produced
[15:26] there's an old story of brother br says
[15:29] a a child that was real humble uh
[15:33] background and he comes to his grandma's
[15:36] house he had never seen himself clearly
[15:39] cuz he never seen a mirror
[15:42] before and he finally sees H himself on
[15:46] a mirror he looks wow there's another
[15:49] person over there and he looks again and
[15:52] wow that's that's another person there
[15:54] and it gets closer and his grandma and
[15:57] his mom are looking at him and he goes
[15:59] well that's me yeah that's the mirror
[16:02] and that shows who he is what's our
[16:05] mirror
[16:07] yeah amen our mirror is the word that's
[16:10] the one we have to look at we don't look
[16:13] at each other and see well I'm better
[16:14] than you or I'm better than you we look
[16:16] at the word to see who we represent we
[16:19] represent Jesus Christ are we trying to
[16:21] live a life worthy of the Gospel
[16:27] amen amen
[16:29] and anyways I was in Mexico and uh uh we
[16:34] were there and there was a there was a
[16:36] quite a few pastors there it was uh
[16:39] pretty unusual there's a lot of pastors
[16:42] there and our aimen Corner was really
[16:46] loud so I want to hear a really loud
[16:49] Amen Corner
[16:50] okay uh it was a real kind of small
[16:53] church and the a corner was really loud
[16:56] and we really got uh my interpreter and
[16:59] I we really got uh carried away a little
[17:02] bit we had a really good time in Mexico
[17:06] Mexico has a a a really uh unusual pool
[17:10] the pool in Mexico is so strong there's
[17:13] so many humble people that want to just
[17:15] hear anything of the word of God want to
[17:18] hear anything of this message that they
[17:19] can get a hold of and and the pool is so
[17:23] strong and the people are so humble and
[17:29] man the things that you see over there
[17:32] are tremendous uh over there uh the
[17:35] brothers wanted to go walk a couple of
[17:37] blocks to the park and the owner of the
[17:40] house said no don't you do that don't
[17:43] don't you have to have someone take you
[17:45] over there cu the streets if they don't
[17:48] see that you're from there they'll stop
[17:50] you and and they'll get on your case you
[17:53] don't ever want to go out there at night
[17:56] walking from one corner of the street to
[17:58] to the other isn't that something and
[18:01] here we have so much Liberty it's it's
[18:03] so much nicer than Mexico that you just
[18:06] take a lot of stuff for for advantage or
[18:11] or just the thinking that it's normal
[18:14] yeah but in Mexico that's not normal
[18:17] normal is is not heard of over there uh
[18:22] I've been there a couple of times this
[18:24] year in Mexico City and oh my it is so
[18:29] tough over there it is so tough uh the
[18:32] people have so much struggles over there
[18:35] that we here in the United States are so
[18:39] spoiled uh that we have so much of
[18:43] everything anyways um the Apostle Paul
[18:48] he he starts off his his ministry by
[18:51] going after the
[18:53] Christians he goes after U uh someone
[18:57] called Steve
[18:59] and uh in chapter 6 of Acts they they
[19:03] elected the uh the first deacons how
[19:07] many know how many young men how many
[19:10] deacons did they
[19:15] choose how many deacons did they
[19:18] choose seven that's right on the on the
[19:22] book of Acts chapter 6 they elected
[19:24] seven deacons and the first Deacon men
[19:28] mention is stepen Steven was a man
[19:31] filled of the Holy Spirit and power of
[19:33] God and he came and he started preaching
[19:37] to them and they got him right away they
[19:40] got him right away said nope nope let's
[19:42] get him let's get him and they brought
[19:44] him to the council the the the ministers
[19:47] there in chapter 7 they brought him to
[19:50] him and when they brought him to that
[19:52] Council let's look at it real quick this
[19:55] is a really good story so you can get an
[19:57] idea of the Apostle Paul what he did
[20:00] when he started his ministry and you'll
[20:03] be
[20:04] surprised what he did
[20:07] when uh when he started and what he
[20:10] consented to uh the Apostle
[20:14] Paul on the end of chapter
[20:19] 6 um well let's look at chapter 6:8 and
[20:23] stepen full of faith and power did great
[20:27] wonders and Miracles among the people
[20:30] they should have when they saw that they
[20:31] should have said w we want some of that
[20:34] but in saying instead of saying we want
[20:36] some of that no we're going to take you
[20:38] to the
[20:39] council so and verse 15 he said and all
[20:44] that sat in the council looking
[20:46] steadfastly on him saw his face and that
[20:51] and it had been the face of an Angel
[20:55] imagine
[20:56] that he he was full of the Holy Spirit
[20:59] did wonders face of an Angel and he was
[21:03] taken to to the councel in chapter 7 he
[21:08] preached to them from the beginning and
[21:10] he brought them all the way through to
[21:13] the end and after he talked to him about
[21:17] all these things if you look at verse uh
[21:21] 49 um chapter 7 verse
[21:27] 49
[21:28] uh let's go to
[21:30] 51 listen to what Stephen
[21:33] said ye stiff neck and uncircumcised in
[21:37] heart and ears ye do always resist the
[21:41] Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye
[21:45] which the prophets have not your fathers
[21:48] persecuted and they have slain them
[21:51] which showed before of the coming of the
[21:54] just one of whom ye have been now the
[21:58] betrayers and murderers oh he was
[22:01] accusing them so what did they
[22:06] do they grabbed him threw him out of the
[22:09] city and they stoned him to
[22:11] the and who was there watching
[22:15] everything the Apostle
[22:17] Paul at that time he was called
[22:21] sa and he consented to their
[22:25] death that's the beginning of oh the
[22:29] Apostle Paul a man of
[22:33] God trying to serve God trying to do the
[22:37] best that he could for God and yet doing
[22:41] everything
[22:42] wrong a man of God thinking he's doing
[22:45] God a service and yet he was absolutely
[22:49] wrong isn't that
[22:51] something the Apostle Paul on chapter
[22:55] nine is when God finally gets a hold of
[22:59] them and God finally gets a hold of this
[23:02] man so we see what he was what he did
[23:06] what he consented to but now let's see
[23:09] when God gets a hold of him God gets a
[23:12] hold of this
[23:14] man in chapter
[23:19] n we could read the whole chapter it be
[23:22] nice but let's let's get a a background
[23:26] here and sa
[23:29] yet uh breathing out threatenings and
[23:33] Slanders against the Disciples of the
[23:36] Lord went unto the high priest and
[23:40] desired of him letters to
[23:42] Damascus to the
[23:45] synagogues that if he found any of of
[23:47] this way whether they were men or women
[23:51] he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem
[23:54] man he was after these
[23:56] Christians and he journeyed he came near
[23:59] Damascus and suddenly there shined round
[24:02] about him a light from Heaven oh my
[24:06] man and he fell on the earth and heard a
[24:09] voice saying unto him sa sa why
[24:12] persecuted thou
[24:15] me that's where the saying comes they
[24:17] knocked them off his high
[24:20] horse they knocked them off his ice
[24:22] horse God knocked them off his ice horse
[24:25] thinking he's doing God a service
[24:28] thinking he had authority to go after
[24:30] these Christians thinking he was a a Top
[24:33] Gun Man God had to knock him off his
[24:36] high
[24:38] horse a man thinking he's doing God a
[24:42] service suddenly realize who was
[24:46] God he finally realized whoa imagine
[24:50] thinking you're doing something right
[24:52] all your life you study you you do
[24:55] everything you can and all of a
[24:57] something after 30s something years to
[25:00] find out you were
[25:03] wrong but yet God having the mercy and
[25:07] the grace to show you you were
[25:11] wrong wow that's that's something that
[25:15] must have been a real change brother
[25:18] that must have really changed his
[25:20] Outlook to realize that you are messed
[25:25] up that you really messed up you killed
[25:28] these people you persecuted the people
[25:30] you persecuted the people you wanted to
[25:33] be like you persecuted the people you
[25:36] wanted to be like the people that had
[25:40] the holy spirit that you were after you
[25:43] were persecuted and to know that is
[25:47] something else so what did he
[25:55] do he fell on the earth and heard a
[25:57] voice saying unto him sa sa why
[26:00] persecutest thou me and he said who art
[26:03] thou
[26:07] Lord and the Lord said I am
[26:11] Jesus whom thou
[26:15] persecuted it is hard for thee to kick
[26:18] against the Pricks now listen it says he
[26:22] says I am Jesus and you're persecuting
[26:25] me right we don't well he wasn't
[26:28] persecuting Jesus as a person but he was
[26:32] persecuting the holy spirit that was in
[26:34] the people he was persecuting so then he
[26:36] was persecuting Jesus Christ through the
[26:39] people is that something
[26:46] yes and he said who art thou Lord and
[26:49] the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou
[26:51] persecutors it is hard for you to K
[26:54] against the PRS and he trembling and
[26:56] astonished and said Lord what will thou
[27:00] have me do and the Lord said unto him
[27:03] arise and go into the City and it shall
[27:06] be told thee what thou shall all must do
[27:10] and the man which journeyed with him
[27:12] stood speechless hearing a voice but
[27:15] seeing no man and sa arose from the
[27:19] earth and when his eyes were open he saw
[27:23] no man but they let him by the hand and
[27:26] brought him into de ascus and he was
[27:29] three days without sight and neither did
[27:32] eat nor drink what do you think he
[27:34] thought of for those three days
[27:38] yeah when I crucified or I I bound this
[27:42] person I had that person killed I did
[27:46] this I did that I studied all my life
[27:50] I've done this I've done that and all
[27:53] this time it was Jesus Christ and all
[27:57] the these people isn't that
[28:02] something and there was a certain
[28:04] disciple
[28:07] at at
[28:09] Damascus named ananas and to him said
[28:14] Lord in a vision
[28:18] ananas and he said behold I am here Lord
[28:22] and the Lord said unto him arise and go
[28:24] into the street which is called straight
[28:27] and chir in the house of Judas for one
[28:30] called Saul of Tarsus and for behold he
[28:35] prayeth and he seen a vision and a man
[28:39] named ananas coming in and putting his
[28:41] hands on him that he might receive a
[28:45] sight you know we we uh talk a lot about
[28:50] uh laying hands on people it is
[28:52] scriptural it's mentioned quite a few
[28:54] times about laying your hands on people
[28:57] even anointing people uh that is
[29:01] scriptural that is done that is normal
[29:04] to do if someone has a need you should
[29:07] lay hands on him and pray for him it is
[29:10] done throughout the
[29:13] scriptures then ananas answered Lord I
[29:16] have heard of many of this man how much
[29:20] evil he has done to thy Saints at
[29:23] Jerusalem and here he has Authority from
[29:27] the Chief priest to bind all that call
[29:30] on thy name but the Lord said unto him
[29:33] go thy way for he is a chosen
[29:38] vessel unto me to Bear my name before
[29:42] the Gentiles and kings and children of
[29:46] Israel for I will show him how great
[29:49] things he must suffer for my name's sake
[29:54] and anas went his way and entered into
[29:57] the the house and putting his hands on
[30:00] him said brother sa the Lord even Jesus
[30:06] that appeared unto thee in thy way as
[30:09] thou camest has sent me that thou
[30:12] mightest receive thy sight and be filled
[30:15] with the Holy Ghost amen and immediately
[30:20] there fell from his eyes as it had been
[30:23] scales and he received sight for with
[30:27] and arose and was baptized and when he
[30:30] had received meat he was strengthened
[30:34] then Saul was C uh certain days with the
[30:40] disciples which were in Damascus and
[30:43] straightway he preached Christ in the
[30:47] synagogues that he is the Son of God he
[30:51] went and started preaching the word of
[30:53] God now what did he do after that
[30:57] now he became a great
[31:00] man he went to
[31:02] Asia for three and a half years or
[31:06] Arabia for three and a half years and he
[31:08] studied to make sure what he had seen
[31:11] was the word of God he studied he he he
[31:15] went through the the scriptures that he
[31:17] had and he made sure it was the word of
[31:20] God he wasn't going to make the same
[31:22] mistake
[31:24] twice he was going to go preach the word
[31:27] of God and now according to the vision
[31:30] he had seen according to his testimony
[31:33] and according to the word of God now
[31:35] that it was revealed to him what was the
[31:39] word of God and what did that
[31:42] produce what did Paul produce when he
[31:46] was transformed when he was changed when
[31:49] God touched them when he the word of God
[31:52] was revealed to him what did it
[31:56] produce let's go to Galatians chapter
[32:07] 1 verse
[32:09] 8 he was so sure of his experience he
[32:14] was so sure where he was standing now
[32:17] that he himself wrote
[32:21] this but thou
[32:24] uh but though we or an angel from heaven
[32:29] preach any other gospel unto you than
[32:32] that which we than which we have
[32:35] preached unto you let him be a curse he
[32:38] was so sure of his experience he was so
[32:42] sure of his word and he said anyone that
[32:44] preaches contrary to what I say let him
[32:47] be a curse yeah
[32:49] wow what a change what a change what a
[32:53] man he changed the whole world Paul
[32:57] changed the whole world from his
[32:59] experience his studying and he came back
[33:03] boldly and said no one else tells you
[33:05] anything contrary to what I
[33:07] say man that is something now what are
[33:11] the fruits of that Spirit chapter five
[33:15] uh what's the fruits of those Spirit of
[33:19] the Holy
[33:24] Spirit uh verse 22
[33:28] but the fruits of the holy spirit is joy
[33:32] is love joy peace longsuffering
[33:36] gentleness godliness Faith meekness
[33:41] Temperance against such there is no
[33:44] law and they that are Christ have
[33:48] crucified the flesh with the affection
[33:51] of and
[33:53] lust if we live in the spirit let us us
[33:57] walk also in the spirit let us not be
[34:00] desirous of vain Glory provoking one
[34:03] another envying one
[34:06] another so not only that but he told you
[34:09] what the fruits of the spirit
[34:11] are now what did Paul do if you have a
[34:16] scoffield Bible study
[34:19] Bible uh not only did he know where he
[34:23] stood and he told everyone that anyone
[34:26] that says contrary what I say let him be
[34:28] a curse but he also wrote most of the
[34:31] New
[34:32] Testament and in the scopio and the
[34:36] Epistles of the Apostle Paul we have the
[34:40] chronological order of Paul's Epistles
[34:43] is believed to be as follows first and 2
[34:47] Thessalonians 1 and 2 Corinthians
[34:51] Galatians
[34:53] Romans
[34:54] filimon Colossians if Ephesians
[34:58] Philippians First Timothy Titus second
[35:01] Timothy even Hebrews he went and he
[35:05] wrote all these things that we ourself
[35:09] base our faith on his writings a
[35:13] tremendous man of God that we cannot uh
[35:19] contradict
[35:20] contradict we have to go with what he
[35:24] said he was a tremendous man of God why
[35:29] because God had mercy on him God showed
[35:33] him and God taught him and gave him the
[35:36] word of God he was a tremendous man of
[35:40] God by the grace of God he was a
[35:44] prisoner of Jesus Christ each one of us
[35:49] has an opportunity to be the Son of God
[35:53] each one of us has an opportunity to say
[35:55] I'll serve him
[35:57] or I won't serve him each one of us um
[36:03] let let me
[36:04] uh read to you some quotes of brother
[36:07] Braham because if we read some quotes of
[36:10] brother Braham we're going to be all
[36:12] right uh brother Braham was another
[36:15] prophet of God see the Apostle Paul was
[36:19] the first
[36:20] church Not only was he the first church
[36:23] but he produced the first
[36:25] bride you know that it brother or the
[36:30] Apostle Paul produced the first bright
[36:34] in the vision of of the bright if you
[36:37] remember that Vision the Apostle Paul
[36:40] saw a vision of the bright to his left
[36:44] side that was the first
[36:46] bride then he saw all the other Brides
[36:50] that were really badly dressed they were
[36:54] they weren't very good all through the
[36:56] church ages and then at the end he saw
[37:00] the bride again yeah so you have the
[37:04] bride and the first church age the first
[37:07] star the first messenger the first bride
[37:11] now we ourselves supposed to go back to
[37:15] what the first Believers beli right amen
[37:19] if that produce the bright then we're
[37:22] supposed to produce the bright in our
[37:24] age yes I hope that me makes
[37:28] sense so the Apostle Paul wasn't just
[37:32] another man he was a man of God a
[37:35] servant of God and the messenger for us
[37:38] today is brother Brandon and he we
[37:42] we trust and believe that he was a
[37:47] messenger for our time and that is a
[37:50] message that's going to straighten us
[37:52] out and bring us back to the faith of
[37:54] the
[37:55] fathers
[37:59] amen I just
[38:02] um let me get a couple of quotes here
[38:06] slide
[38:08] 15 another little quotation we might
[38:12] drop in
[38:13] here you see as they make fun of the
[38:17] church they're not really making fun of
[38:19] the church they're making fun of
[38:23] Jesus why persecutes thou me
[38:27] how could Paul then with all his
[38:30] intellect believe that this was that
[38:34] this
[38:36] group that he was persecuting was the
[38:39] very God that he claimed to be
[38:44] serving I think that's without going
[38:47] into details I think we're all well
[38:49] trained enough to know what I mean here
[38:53] the same thing is happening today
[38:57] the same thing is happening to the
[38:59] message Believers today they're making
[39:02] fun of
[39:04] us
[39:05] but it's all right let them make fun of
[39:10] us uh there'll be a bright
[39:13] [Music]
[39:14] ready and this message is the only
[39:17] message that will produce that bright
[39:23] yes slide 16 Paul through
[39:27] ignorance was yet intelligent and smart
[39:30] much smarter than those uneducated
[39:33] galileans that he was persecuted they
[39:36] had already in their humility accepted
[39:39] this man as Lord but Paul in his great
[39:42] teaching and his great intellectuals
[39:45] could not accept that and what a
[39:48] turnaround it must have been to him on
[39:51] this road that he was stricken blind and
[39:55] he would not carry out his commission
[39:58] but was led down to a place in the
[40:00] street called straight in the house of
[40:04] one and then come the
[40:09] prophet down there by the name of ananas
[40:12] who saw in a vision coming down saw
[40:16] where he was at went down to where he
[40:19] was and went in and said brother
[40:22] sa the Lord appeared unto you on the
[40:25] road down sent me that I may might lay
[40:30] my hands upon you and you receive your
[40:32] sight and be filled with the Holy
[40:35] Ghost SL
[40:37] 17 see where he was what a thing it must
[40:41] have been for Paul see all that he had
[40:46] been trained to do was vice versa wow
[40:50] imagine that so now with all the
[40:54] education he had in it was just become
[40:57] not to him before he has experienced he
[41:01] was now this is me okay before his
[41:05] experience he was like
[41:08] Pharaoh he saw slaves a bunch of mud
[41:13] dobbers that's actually that's I got
[41:16] that from Brother Bram but after his
[41:19] experience he saw them as children of
[41:23] God bunch of nobody's and then whoa
[41:27] these are the ones I want to be
[41:31] like that is
[41:36] something
[41:38] uh and see let's go to slide 18 now he
[41:42] had to become in prison or something a
[41:44] prisoner so after
[41:47] comparing it and seeing no wonder he
[41:50] could write the book of Hebrews and type
[41:53] see there see 3 years and and a half
[41:56] down there laying in the word and
[41:59] finding out that the very God that he
[42:02] called him was taking him back and
[42:05] changing all of his inct changing all
[42:08] that he had ever thought all that he
[42:11] trained to be all of his ambition just
[42:16] wiped it all away wiped it away from him
[42:20] he became a prisoner the love of God had
[42:24] been so tremendous
[42:26] a and such a revelation that he could
[42:30] not get away from it he could not get
[42:33] away from that
[42:34] Revelation that's the true experience in
[42:37] every real believer who meets God you
[42:40] come in contact with something that's so
[42:43] great that you that you become a
[42:46] prisoner through everything else you get
[42:49] away from everything to imprison
[42:52] yourself to this every born again
[42:56] believer can turn back and say on this
[43:00] day the Lord touched me and changed me
[43:03] and I haven't been the same and I can't
[43:06] be the same anymore the Lord has touched
[43:09] me and filled me the Holy Spirit and
[43:11] from that day on I cannot do what I used
[43:16] to do and that was what Paul could
[43:20] always turn back to and realize that he
[43:23] could not be what he used to be every
[43:27] true Born Again believer has that
[43:29] experience one day in their life one day
[43:33] that he can say from this day I'm over
[43:37] here from that day back they're gone
[43:40] it's history it's forgiven it's under
[43:43] the blood from this day on I'm going to
[43:46] serve the
[43:48] Lord that's the way it is for everyone
[43:51] that decides to serve the Lord every one
[43:54] of us who have decided to serve serve
[43:56] the Lord can say I'm saved I'm under the
[43:59] blood the day I gave my heart to Jesus
[44:04] Christ that's the day I got baptized and
[44:07] I decided to serve him and from that day
[44:10] on everything is under the blood
[44:12] everything and from that day on forward
[44:16] I'm saving the Lord and one day may be
[44:20] that day or somewhere in the future the
[44:23] Lord's going to touch me and change my
[44:24] life he's going to change my life and
[44:27] I'll never be the same maybe you'll be
[44:29] another Paul maybe you'll be another uh
[44:33] Branham I don't know whatever you are
[44:37] whatever you do maybe you'll be another
[44:39] Pastor another Minister another Deacon
[44:42] whatever the Lord has for you you do the
[44:45] best you
[44:47] can it's whatever God has for
[44:50] you I'll tell you what I never planned
[44:53] to be a pastor that's for sure
[44:56] and that was this last thing on my mind
[44:59] but whatever God puts before you you do
[45:03] the best that you
[45:05] can that's all that God requires you do
[45:08] the best you can with what you have the
[45:11] abilities that he's giving you you put
[45:13] it before the Lord and he'll take care
[45:16] of the rest from the day you decide to
[45:19] serve the Lord there is no greater
[45:22] decision you can make than to serve the
[45:25] Lord it's a free moral agency he will
[45:30] not make you do anything if you desire
[45:33] not to serve the Lord you don't want to
[45:35] serve the Lord that's between you and
[45:37] God but the day you decide to serve the
[45:40] Lord that's the day that's the day
[45:43] you'll always remember I remember the
[45:46] day I got baptized I remember the when
[45:48] the Lord first touched me the first time
[45:51] I remember a lot of things in my
[45:54] history but the many main thing that I
[45:56] remember is when I got baptized that's
[46:01] the day you will not
[46:04] forget by the grace of God you will not
[46:07] forget that day that you decided to
[46:09] serve the
[46:11] Lord
[46:15] amen Matthew
[46:17] 13:45
[46:19] 46 again the Kingdom of Heaven is like
[46:23] unto a merchant man
[46:27] seeking Godly pearls goodly pearls who
[46:30] when he had found one pearl of great
[46:33] price went and sold all that he had and
[46:36] bought
[46:41] it and that's the way it is with us we
[46:44] can hear a lot of
[46:47] things we can hear a lot of
[46:50] messages we can hear of a lot of faiths
[46:53] a lot of churches a lot of of Ministries
[46:57] but when we hear this
[46:59] message this message changed our lives
[47:03] this message brought us to the word this
[47:06] message gave us that Revelation that
[47:08] understanding of the word of God of what
[47:11] God really wants from us we could have
[47:13] been in the any denomination you name
[47:17] but when you heard this message it made
[47:20] you just leave everything else behind
[47:23] cuz this message is nothing better out
[47:26] there than the message of the hour
[47:29] there's nothing that's going to take you
[47:30] to the feet of Jesus Christ like this
[47:32] message is going to take you right amen
[47:42] Amen brother Bram says we become
[47:45] harnessed we become hooked yeah we
[47:49] become yolked to God he becomes a part
[47:53] of us we become a part of him we cannot
[47:57] move from that word we cannot do
[47:59] anything contrary to that word because
[48:01] we're yoked to him we're we're tied to
[48:04] him he is a part of us we're a part of
[48:07] him he will not let us go as long as we

[48:15] word it's not what I think it's not what
[48:19] I uh I think is better not anything else
[48:22] but it's the word God will only back up
[48:26] his word he will not back up your
[48:29] feelings he will not back up your
[48:32] theology he will not back up anything
[48:36] else other than his word amen if it's

[49:00] this as brother B says God is looking
[49:04] for prisoners
[49:06] yes God is looking for
[49:09] prisoners he's always done it you might
[49:13] search it through the scripture a man
[49:16] has to be a prisoner to
[49:19] Christ against
[49:21] anything a man has to be a prisoner to
[49:25] Christ
[49:26] against anything therefore you cannot be
[49:30] connected with anything but Christ even
[49:33] your father your mother your brother
[49:38] your sister your husband your wife
[49:42] anybody you're only connected with
[49:46] Christ and him only then God can use you
[49:52] until then you can't if you're connect
[49:55] connected to your wife you're connected
[49:57] to your husband connected to anyone else
[50:00] God can't use you but when you're
[50:03] connected to
[50:05] Christ then he can use you is that
[50:10] something
[50:12] amen well I appreciate that you you let
[50:16] me be here this evening it's a very

[50:48] your children your grandchildren serve
[50:50] the Lord there's nothing better than
[50:52] that amen you can be the poorest men in
[50:56] the world as long as you're serving the
[50:57] lord yes we're good anything else can
[51:01] happen but at the end of the road you
[51:05] know we're we're going to be fine so I
[51:08] thank the Lord that that he has decided
[51:11] to serve the Lord and uh uh you young
[51:15] man every time we have a baptism in our
[51:18] church we always call out to see if
[51:20] there's any other uh persons that like

[51:25] uh we just had two baptisms on Sunday
[51:29] and uh we're supposed to have another
[51:30] baptism this Friday and uh that's great
