[0:00] ruth chapter one i'm gonna just read
[0:02] verse two
[0:03] ruth chapter one verse two since we've
[0:05] all been together in these services i
[0:07] feel i can just jump
[0:08] right in where we were um and the last
[0:10] time it says and the name of the man was
[0:13] elimelech this is the man who
[0:14] him and his family journeyed into moab
[0:16] and the name of his wife was naomi
[0:18] in the name of his two sons mahan and
[0:21] kilian
[0:22] efferties of bethlehem judah and the
[0:24] part we're focusing on now and they came
[0:26] into the country of moab
[0:28] and continued there if we could bow our
[0:31] heads
[0:31] gracious heavenly father lord we're
[0:34] appreciative of your presence that is
[0:36] with us this evening
[0:38] uh just a tremendous atmosphere lord and
[0:40] it's one that
[0:41] i do not believe is synthetic it's not
[0:43] one that we try to work up
[0:45] it's not the product of you know a band
[0:47] practicing and everything being
[0:49] synchronized to produce just the right
[0:52] emotional response but lord there's a
[0:55] peace in our hearts
[0:56] there's a joy that we have in our hearts
[0:59] there's an expectation that we've
[1:00] brought with us
[1:02] and lord we we look upon the facilities
[1:05] that have been extended to us and we're
[1:06] grateful for them
[1:08] and we realize that there's a privilege
[1:10] we have and be able to be together
[1:12] with this type of closeness even
[1:14] thinking last year
[1:16] where meetings were banned and these
[1:18] number of people could not be together
[1:19] and all the restrictions that would have
[1:21] been placed on us
[1:22] but we're certainly grateful but yet
[1:24] lord we realize that it's not the
[1:26] facility
[1:27] that makes the church it's the kingdom
[1:29] delegates that have gathered together
[1:31] therefore lord i believe as much as we
[1:33] are rejoicing and feel
[1:34] an excitement in our spirits tonight i
[1:36] believe that heaven
[1:38] is eve under even more anticipation when
[1:41] they see the group like this come
[1:43] together
[1:44] in love for your word and with such an
[1:46] anticipation to hear from you so i
[1:48] believe in a supernatural realm
[1:50] there is a positive frenzy and there is
[1:53] a rush of excitement lord and may we
[1:55] just
[1:56] lean into that and accept it and and
[1:58] allow you to
[1:59] have your way in this service bless your
[2:02] people we pray
[2:03] in the name of lord jesus christ amen
[2:06] you can be seated
[2:10] it's going to pick right up where we
[2:12] were last time
[2:13] looking at this phrase at the end of
[2:15] verse 2 it says and they came
[2:17] into the country of moab and continued
[2:20] there just a few things at the outset by
[2:23] way of
[2:24] kind of review and picking up a few
[2:25] things i want to
[2:27] maybe place it in this way they left
[2:30] god's provided way
[2:32] god had a place provided for israel it
[2:34] was the promised land
[2:36] and so they ought to have remained there
[2:38] regardless of how difficult things were
[2:41] in that land if they were in a place
[2:43] where they were contrary to the god's
[2:44] word if they were in a
[2:46] in a place that god had not promised
[2:48] them if there had been
[2:49] markers and significations and signs
[2:51] that this was contrary to god's word
[2:53] then we could see that taking his step
[2:56] in moving would have been
[2:57] justified according to the word would
[2:58] have been what the holy spirit was
[3:00] leading
[3:01] but we look at a number of different
[3:02] factors in elimelech's move and we see
[3:04] that he forsook
[3:05] god's promised word for his day and
[3:09] i know when we put it in that context
[3:10] that they had forsaken god's provided
[3:12] way
[3:12] he abandoned god's promise word for that
[3:15] day that those are phrases that we can
[3:17] use to challenge
[3:18] ourselves and and terms that are very
[3:20] familiar to us
[3:21] within the message and so elimelech's
[3:24] move
[3:24] from bethlehem judah into moab was an
[3:28] act of rebellion
[3:29] it was not a man exercising wisdom and
[3:32] doing that which was best for his family
[3:34] and it was prudent and something that
[3:36] god was leading him to do
[3:38] but it was actually disobedience a
[3:40] continued disobedience against god's
[3:42] word
[3:42] in a day when the judges ruled in a time
[3:44] when every man did that which was right
[3:46] in his own sight
[3:48] he leaves bethlehem judah and will find
[3:51] that when naomi returns later that
[3:52] there's a lot of people says oh here's
[3:54] naomi she's coming back
[3:56] and so we realized that they that there
[3:58] was many who stayed
[4:00] and maybe we could say a lot of people
[4:02] who stayed because it was kind of
[4:03] significant to them that oh
[4:04] here's a limoulex wife that's returning
[4:06] back and it was something that everyone
[4:08] noticed so elimelech may have been
[4:10] one of very few and this is the only one
[4:12] that is recorded and that we know
[4:14] of that left bethlehem judah during this
[4:16] time of famine
[4:17] and went into moab and what elimelech
[4:19] ought to have done
[4:20] is repented he himself ought to have
[4:23] called upon
[4:24] the name of the lord and ought to uh
[4:25] relented of his rebellion and ought to
[4:27] have yielded to the
[4:28] the spirit of god and said lord we're
[4:30] sorry we avail ourselves to you and
[4:32] we repent of our wicked ways and we
[4:34] realize that famine
[4:35] would only be the result of us leaving
[4:38] the path that we ought to have been in
[4:39] so god
[4:40] we pray that you would lift this famine
[4:42] and this curse drive away our enemies
[4:44] who are taking these
[4:45] things away from us and our oppressors
[4:47] and and what he ought to have done is
[4:48] repented but instead
[4:50] in an act of rebellion he goes into moab
[4:53] and so they come the scriptures and they
[4:54] came into the country of
[4:56] they went into moab and last time we
[4:58] were looking at how that moab
[5:01] is i was the son of lot and lot means
[5:05] covering and how this was a son of
[5:07] covering and we just looked at how that
[5:09] this was a religious covering and we
[5:11] could
[5:12] we're going to look at that in more
[5:13] detail tonight maybe not focusing on
[5:15] this aspect of religion being a covering
[5:17] but you'll be able to see how this
[5:19] dovetails together without the emphasis
[5:21] but i want to say this choosing moab
[5:26] represents something to us as bride the
[5:28] scripture doesn't just say that
[5:30] a family left bethlehem judah and went
[5:32] into a foreign country
[5:34] whereas when jesus gives the parable of
[5:36] the what we call the prodigal son
[5:38] it says that he went and joined himself
[5:40] with as a citizen of a foreign country
[5:42] it doesn't tell us exactly what it was
[5:43] uh because maybe that it wasn't
[5:46] necessary to understand the point or the
[5:48] mystery behind the parable
[5:49] that jesus was using but here in told
[5:52] this telling the story
[5:53] of elimelech leaving bethlehem judy
[5:56] tells us exactly where he went
[5:57] and i believe it's because it represents
[5:59] something to us this type of moab is
[6:02] part of the hidden mystery and ruth
[6:04] because this is just a very simple way
[6:06] to look at this and kind of
[6:07] maybe get our attention and bring us to
[6:09] be spellbound
[6:10] it's what ruth was called out of and
[6:13] when we look at it that way it starts
[6:15] thinking all right let's think about
[6:16] this
[6:17] because ruth didn't leave bethlehem
[6:19] judah
[6:20] and go into moab but ruth was in moab
[6:25] that's where she was and so we see these
[6:27] chain of events we haven't even seen
[6:29] ruth's name yet
[6:30] in these services and just looking at
[6:32] verses one and two it's not until you
[6:34] get to verse
[6:35] four that you actually have ruth that's
[6:37] introduced and i know that's very
[6:38] quickly within the framework of the
[6:40] story
[6:41] as it's written but yet this is a number
[6:42] of years from the moment that elimelech
[6:44] leaves it doesn't just start and say
[6:46] where there's a woman in the moab named
[6:47] ruth
[6:49] and and she went to bethlehem judah
[6:51] during a time of great harvest it wants
[6:54] us to understand this background
[6:56] and so ruth chapter one is the
[6:58] background
[6:59] of ruth's story these first few verses
[7:02] are the background not
[7:04] it's not really a limoulek story so much
[7:06] it's not the two sun story it's the
[7:07] background for week
[7:08] so that we can understand ruth and we
[7:11] can understand her
[7:12] and understand her redemption and her
[7:14] restoration and ruth being a book of
[7:16] redemption the very
[7:17] lines of redemption are drawn in this
[7:19] story this is background of this story
[7:22] of redemption
[7:23] we see boaz as a type of christ and and
[7:25] we recognize that we believe
[7:27] that boaz are the type of christ we
[7:28] recognize that ruth is a type of the
[7:30] bride
[7:31] and then recognizing and as we'll see
[7:33] further see in boaz as a type of christ
[7:36] there's a lot of instances that boaz is
[7:38] mentioned in this story
[7:40] and you can see a reflection of christ
[7:43] in the actions of boaz and so we could
[7:45] do the same thing and looking at ruth
[7:47] and see that ruth we could we can learn
[7:49] something by looking at the country of
[7:51] moab
[7:51] because that's what ruth who is the type
[7:53] of the bride is brought out of
[7:55] and we say then this must be there must
[7:58] be some connection
[7:59] as to how the living bread of life is
[8:01] the shout
[8:02] bringing forth the bride and of ruth
[8:05] being a type
[8:06] of the bride we can see how the liv what
[8:09] the living bread of life is bringing us
[8:11] out of today
[8:12] what the word we're hearing is
[8:13] continually washing us of
[8:16] and even if i could say it this way we
[8:18] can begin to identify
[8:20] how how particular and specific the
[8:22] message is
[8:23] to meet the needs that we have in our
[8:25] lives because
[8:27] we ought to believe that the word has
[8:28] the answer i really believe
[8:31] that we could say we've got the answer
[8:33] what's the question
[8:35] right we can say that we've got the
[8:37] answer now what's the question
[8:38] and i do believe the question is
[8:40] relevant but we have the answer by god's
[8:42] grace
[8:43] we have it and we so we could see look
[8:45] into the message and just have this
[8:46] faith to believe
[8:47] the word of god addresses our needs
[8:50] and so we can see some of these types
[8:52] coming out in
[8:54] in this story now we mentioned last time
[8:56] we'll be maybe a little bit more
[8:58] uh we're going to use some summary
[8:59] language but
[9:01] and if it seems to be maybe a little bit
[9:03] uh um
[9:05] offensive it's just it's just the plain
[9:07] truth of the scripture
[9:08] and as we've been reading through the
[9:10] old testament together as a family
[9:12] there's parts where you just kind of
[9:13] pause and you figure out how how can i
[9:15] say this you know
[9:16] you know you don't really you wish they
[9:18] kind of had a a different version of the
[9:20] bible to be able to read it but
[9:21] the bible the old testament is full of a
[9:23] lot of stories that make us blush
[9:25] a lot of stories that it's maybe very
[9:26] difficult to explain to our children
[9:28] but we know that the moabites were
[9:30] descendants of law through an act of
[9:32] incest
[9:33] and so a lot's daughter has a son with
[9:36] lot
[9:36] and his name is moab now go
[9:40] that's that's the point at which we can
[9:42] go back to says ruth was a moabitess she
[9:44] claims
[9:44] she's when she refers to herself as ruth
[9:46] the moabitess
[9:47] elimelech and his family go into moab so
[9:50] we know ruth is going to come from there
[9:51] but we're going back and asking
[9:53] ourselves what is moab to begin with
[9:55] what kind of beginnings did moab have
[9:58] and you find didn't have a very good
[9:59] beginning
[10:00] didn't have a very good foundation and
[10:03] but this is what ruth is called out of
[10:05] this is the foundation of what she's
[10:07] called out of and brother branham
[10:09] makes this statement and does god change
[10:11] his mind and you'll find
[10:12] he preaches this one in jeffersonville
[10:14] on april 18 1965
[10:16] and then i believe he preaches it on
[10:18] april 27th
[10:20] um later on in los angeles
[10:23] of that same year and in each one of
[10:25] these he deals
[10:26] tremendous gives a lot of attention to
[10:29] moab
[10:30] and and these different instances that
[10:32] we're mentioning tonight
[10:33] but it says moab to begin with was an
[10:36] illegitimate nation
[10:38] it started out illegitimate yet by a
[10:40] father believer and a daughter believer
[10:44] i mean you could just sit there for a
[10:45] while and start scratching your head
[10:47] think about how close this starts to
[10:49] bring this
[10:50] and he said the beginning the way that
[10:52] this child was produced though it was a
[10:54] believing father and a believing
[10:55] daughter
[10:56] he says it was illegitimate to begin
[10:58] with just exactly if you will
[11:00] type that and use a spiritual mind you
[11:03] can see
[11:04] that denomination standing there just as
[11:06] plain as anything
[11:08] so he's saying though you might have had
[11:09] what would seem to be the right elements
[11:11] there's a way that it produced it
[11:13] produced something
[11:14] that was illegitimate produce something
[11:16] that was against what god's order would
[11:18] have been it had the wrong kind of
[11:19] foundation it had the wrong kind of
[11:21] beginning
[11:22] and it's important to look at how
[11:23] something starts it's important to look
[11:25] at the beginning of something because
[11:27] that's gonna it's gonna kind of
[11:28] establish its direction
[11:30] and it's gonna give it some momentum if
[11:32] something starts off wrong give it time
[11:34] it begins to deviate further and further
[11:36] and further
[11:37] and for those who've already kind of
[11:39] started with it
[11:40] if they don't realize the wrong
[11:41] foundation they feel that they're
[11:43] building correctly
[11:44] feel completely justified in the
[11:46] direction it's going but he says the
[11:48] whole thing is all together wrong and
[11:49] look
[11:50] when it's brought started like that it
[11:52] keeps like a ball of snow
[11:54] it just keeps rolling more and more and
[11:57] more
[11:58] so it's the snowball effect he says you
[12:00] get one error start on that one error
[12:02] and you just keep rolling
[12:03] one thing after another one thing like
[12:05] another all after
[12:06] another so this is this is what
[12:10] we're looking at in the nature and the
[12:11] characteristics of moab that are
[12:13] important for us to consider
[12:15] that moab began illegitimately moab
[12:18] even as a nation has a the wrong kind of
[12:21] foundation
[12:22] and he says you can see denomination
[12:25] standing there just as plain as anything
[12:27] so let's look at moab now as
[12:29] denomination
[12:31] and so moab represents and i've been
[12:34] studying a lot of different places where
[12:36] brotherhood
[12:36] says this so i i can use a little bit of
[12:40] and today i'm just going to use these
[12:42] statements from the message to
[12:43] substantiate this but i want to say
[12:45] this that i can use a lot of summary
[12:47] language
[12:48] and if you say well where did you get
[12:50] that from there and and how could you
[12:51] say that
[12:52] i i can show you the quotes of brother
[12:54] branham and the statements he made to
[12:56] substantiate it
[12:57] and so just for sake of time i want to
[12:58] use some things that are kind of summary
[13:00] he already says here that you can see
[13:02] moab
[13:03] as a denomination standing there just as
[13:05] plain as anything
[13:06] and this is not a history lesson this is
[13:09] applicable to the time that we're living
[13:10] in now
[13:11] so moab represents a denominational
[13:13] spirit
[13:15] a moab represents a denominational
[13:17] condition
[13:18] and and i want to use this as a way of
[13:21] uh uh
[13:23] representing what a denomination is it's
[13:25] a man-made system that keeps an
[13:26] individual from god
[13:28] that's my definition and i think it's
[13:31] it's informed by the
[13:32] many the thousands of things that we
[13:33] could see in the word of god that it's a
[13:35] man it's something man-made
[13:37] that's going to keep the individual away
[13:40] from god
[13:41] so when we use the phrase denomination
[13:43] it's important and
[13:45] i'm sure those of you who are here this
[13:46] evening i would you could just
[13:48] nod in agreement say yep we understand
[13:50] that we perfectly understand that
[13:52] but maybe it just bears being reminded
[13:54] that when we think denomination
[13:55] don't think strictly about a legal
[13:57] structure
[13:58] that what denomination are you a part of
[14:00] and you think oh well
[14:01] we're southern baptist or we're of this
[14:03] convention and we're of this
[14:04] organization we're upc or we're
[14:06] assembly of god or we're we're uh we're
[14:09] it's more than that
[14:10] it's more than a legal structure it's
[14:12] more than some sort of formal
[14:13] recognition or a hierarchy but
[14:16] denomination
[14:17] can be much broader more general and
[14:19] more elusive than that
[14:20] we could all say right now and feel
[14:22] fairly confident that we are not part of
[14:24] any denomination
[14:25] but that may just speak to the fact that
[14:27] this church does not have any particular
[14:29] affiliation
[14:30] with an established legally organized
[14:33] informed
[14:34] denominational group a recognizable
[14:36] organization
[14:37] and in that way we can say well we're
[14:38] not a denomination but it's important to
[14:41] recognize that you can become a
[14:43] denominational or be a denomination and
[14:46] still call yourself
[14:47] independent uh not to offend our
[14:50] neighbors next door in the apartment but
[14:52] just
[14:52] look at the independent baptist you'll
[14:54] find this independent just means
[14:56] they're independent of this organization
[14:58] within the baptist hierarchy but they
[15:00] themselves are still yet
[15:02] an organization and so even with the
[15:05] churches becoming loosely affiliated
[15:07] they begin to operate
[15:08] just like an organization can be so
[15:11] denominationalism can be very very
[15:13] subtle
[15:14] and when we look at moab and we see that
[15:16] brother brahma says with the spiritual
[15:18] mind you can see that denomination
[15:19] standing there just as plain as anything
[15:22] it's important to realize that
[15:23] denominationalism can just be a mindset
[15:26] it doesn't have to be a dot org or an
[15:28] ink it doesn't have to have a
[15:30] headquarters
[15:30] it can just be a mindset you can have a
[15:32] denominational approach
[15:35] i let i'll just be very frank you could
[15:37] be sitting in a church that is
[15:38] absolutely not a denomination in a
[15:40] church that does not have a
[15:41] denominational spirit
[15:42] a church that is not subject to a
[15:44] headquarters answering to some
[15:45] denominational hierarchy and being told
[15:47] what to do
[15:48] and you yourself have a denominational
[15:51] mindset
[15:52] you you just kind of have this this
[15:54] mindset you approach things just like a
[15:56] denomination with so denominationalism
[15:58] can just be an attitude
[16:01] i said that we just kind of enter into
[16:03] that and it's just a system that can be
[16:05] developed where
[16:06] this is the way things are done and this
[16:07] is the way we think and this is the way
[16:09] we operate
[16:09] this is how i think this is the way i
[16:11] think things should be done and so there
[16:12] could be a denominational spirit
[16:14] denominational attitude denominational
[16:16] approach
[16:16] and it can be on a on a collection of
[16:18] churches even a collection of
[16:20] individuals that go to a church
[16:21] or even just one person or a small
[16:23] clique within a church
[16:24] be very very denominational and so ruth
[16:28] is being called out of moab
[16:31] she's been called out of this and
[16:33] brought into a promise
[16:35] and by seeing ruth called out of moab
[16:37] and being brought into a promise it's a
[16:39] warning to us
[16:41] it speaks something to us as individuals
[16:43] that ruth is being called out of
[16:45] this denominationalism she's called out
[16:47] of it into the promised word into a
[16:49] particular field
[16:50] it should be a warning to us because
[16:53] there is no
[16:54] quote-unquote i'm using a lowercase m
[16:57] and i'm using air quotes for those who
[16:59] are just streaming the podcast
[17:01] there's actually no podcast yet uh
[17:03] that's
[17:04] there's no message immunity to not
[17:07] denominationalism
[17:09] when we are taught that the message will
[17:11] not denominate we ought to realize that
[17:13] brother branham and making that
[17:14] statement was referring very
[17:15] specifically to the word that was
[17:17] brought
[17:18] and that that word would never organize
[17:21] and that that word would never formalize
[17:23] but that word would continue on until a
[17:25] rapture
[17:26] and when this message would be
[17:27] undenominated and it would not
[17:29] denominate he's saying that
[17:30] there will never be a need for another
[17:32] prophet raise up
[17:34] there'll never need to be another eighth
[17:35] messenger another messenger another
[17:37] prophet another move of god
[17:39] to break out those who were walking in
[17:41] truth out of
[17:42] a denominational structure
[17:45] but this is this is the message that'll
[17:47] lead to a rapture
[17:48] he says it will not denominate in others
[17:49] it won't stop it won't die but that
[17:51] doesn't mean others won't stop
[17:54] doesn't mean people won't die in their
[17:55] own organizations and organize around
[17:57] the message and make it something it's
[17:58] not
[17:59] so denominationalism can be alive and
[18:01] well even among people or
[18:03] in someone's life who fully with all
[18:05] their heart believes the message
[18:07] a father believer father daughter
[18:08] producing an organizational
[18:10] denominational mindset
[18:11] it can happen and so we want to be very
[18:14] sensitive to that
[18:16] so that we don't do that we have an
[18:18] opportunity as a church that's just
[18:20] begun
[18:21] in our beginning to make sure that we
[18:23] begin right and that it just doesn't
[18:25] snowball and then we find years later
[18:27] man aren't we
[18:28] aren't we strong and aren't we great and
[18:29] don't we got the numbers and hasn't this
[18:31] been awesome
[18:32] but yet somehow somewhere in the
[18:33] beginning it starts off wrong
[18:35] and we just we're just patting each
[18:37] other on the back so excited we're
[18:38] having our 15-year
[18:39] anniversary services and i can't believe
[18:41] it we had to we had to rent the bank one
[18:43] ballpark or whatever it's called now we
[18:45] had to run a baseball field we had to
[18:46] run the convention so we had to kick the
[18:48] suns out
[18:48] to have the convention because we're so
[18:50] big and so many people are attending and
[18:52] just patting ourselves on the back but
[18:53] god looks at
[18:54] just a snowball of heirs and it can get
[18:58] bigger and bigger and it looks really
[18:59] really good it has a lot of momentum but
[19:00] it's headed the wrong direction
[19:04] but the man says this and does god
[19:05] change his mind we just read in
[19:07] paragraph 99 this is paragraph 102.
[19:09] now lots group here moab was lot's
[19:11] daughter's child
[19:12] illegitimate to start with so he's
[19:15] making this point
[19:16] now notice as the natural church moab
[19:19] represents the natural denomination so
[19:22] there is a
[19:22] church carnal there's a natural church
[19:24] there's a church denomination
[19:26] israel represents the spiritual church
[19:30] now remember that what we're doing today
[19:33] relates more to natural church right
[19:36] because we're in a natural building we
[19:37] have we have a name that we've given
[19:39] ourselves and these different things
[19:41] let's let's not just think that any that
[19:43] there's a there's an
[19:44] always a natural element to this this
[19:46] kind of gathering
[19:48] all right is that i mean is that a
[19:49] strange concept to everyone amazing
[19:51] in the world are you thinking we've
[19:52] always thought that we something we've
[19:54] left our bodies at home and we're kind
[19:55] of hearing our theophanies
[19:56] our theophanies are waiting in our car
[19:58] just you know when when i get back to my
[20:00] tesla my body will just kind of
[20:02] unite back with my theophany oh this is
[20:04] not a gathering of theophanies
[20:06] this is people with backaches and people
[20:07] who are tired and
[20:09] people who who don't like the sound of
[20:10] my voice after 45 minutes and
[20:12] we're all natural here and when you
[20:14] start a church and you
[20:16] organize something you have not all
[20:17] there's a lot of natural things that
[20:19] pertain to church
[20:20] so let's just realize there is there are
[20:22] natural things that relate to church
[20:24] but in the midst of all that there's
[20:26] people who are part of a spiritual
[20:27] church
[20:29] and there's no one church that can claim
[20:31] to be the spiritual church
[20:34] it's important to ponder these things so
[20:36] moab represents the natural denomination
[20:38] israel represents the spiritual church
[20:40] israel was the true
[20:42] the church true it was the bride of that
[20:44] day
[20:45] called out of egypt and vindicated to be
[20:47] the truth
[20:48] so when we see moab it's distinct from
[20:51] israel which would represent
[20:52] the bride and and the bride that was
[20:54] called out of egypt and
[20:56] vindicated to have the truth so bride is
[20:58] represented in israel
[21:00] moab and really what we're focusing on
[21:01] now is how moab represents a natural
[21:04] state a natural condition
[21:06] a natural organization it represents
[21:08] natural denomination
[21:11] remember and i believe we might have
[21:12] gone over this at some point i can't
[21:13] remember
[21:15] in what exact subject area we're looking
[21:17] at but i just recall there were some
[21:18] statements we were looking at and
[21:20] recognizing it's important to realize
[21:23] that a denomination as brother branham
[21:27] refers to it or the church
[21:28] natural is a group movement when brother
[21:31] bam talks about denominations he talks
[21:33] about the church
[21:34] it's a it's a group thing he's
[21:36] identifying singling out
[21:38] a group he's talking about a movement
[21:40] he's talking about something that has
[21:41] some sort of
[21:41] identification but when we talk about
[21:43] the bride that relates to an individual
[21:47] that there's there's a there's a message
[21:49] that can be broadcast and given to the
[21:50] church
[21:51] even the fallen church the brotherhood
[21:53] says that the laodicea and these
[21:55] different churches
[21:56] the natural church the false church
[21:57] claims to be the true church
[21:59] so god speaks to them as the church
[22:02] and he addresses them as a group but
[22:04] when god wants to deal with your heart
[22:06] he will not
[22:06] deal with you in in as a group he deals
[22:10] with you as an individual
[22:12] and so if we all want to be lutherans we
[22:14] could just become a lutheran church
[22:15] and therefore we are lutherans by the
[22:17] fact that we identify with an
[22:19] organization with a system of beliefs
[22:21] and a way of living and a way of
[22:22] approaching things and then whenever our
[22:23] convention makes a decision we say oh
[22:25] well this is what we believe now and
[22:27] this is how we'll identify
[22:28] and it becomes a group move this is how
[22:30] even jehovah witnessed in different ones
[22:32] they have this evolution of their
[22:34] theology and their beliefs
[22:36] over many many different decades and
[22:38] years and they all just accept it and
[22:40] continue on with it because it's a group
[22:42] thing
[22:43] but when god wants to make someone a
[22:45] part of the bride
[22:46] it's not well here's a group there and
[22:48] there's a group there it's here's my
[22:50] word you receive it into your heart
[22:51] and you're baptized into a body and it's
[22:54] not a group movement it's an individual
[22:56] thing
[22:59] it wasn't a group move when ruth came
[23:02] out of
[23:04] moab as you continue to read and we get
[23:06] into this in more detail you'll find
[23:07] just how
[23:08] striking it is so in type
[23:12] bib is saying that moab is the natural
[23:14] church
[23:15] so it represents a carnal religion
[23:18] and and we'll see how brother ram is
[23:20] saying it represents political religion
[23:24] and and this has the dovetail in kind of
[23:26] the
[23:27] uh the the tie-in to what we ministered
[23:29] on sunday
[23:30] on our the conscience and a clear
[23:34] conscience
[23:35] and we were looking at how the world
[23:37] today has had their conscience seared
[23:39] but it doesn't mean they've all they
[23:41] they become emotionless and they become
[23:43] dead they're passionate they're excited
[23:47] they're motivated they stand for things
[23:51] they push for things they rally for
[23:53] things and they have a lot of passion
[23:55] and they're conscious but they lack a
[23:58] spiritual conscience
[24:00] they lack the morality they lack in
[24:01] integrity and so
[24:03] and and so religion has become uh
[24:06] politics has become a religion
[24:10] science has become a religion you don't
[24:13] think science is a religion watch how
[24:15] dogmatic they can be
[24:16] when anyone has a contrary opinion they
[24:19] behave
[24:19] just like organized religion they behave
[24:22] just like the religious zealots they
[24:24] have the same kind of ideology
[24:26] the same kind of mindset the same kind
[24:28] of activities and they behave much the
[24:29] same way that you could say
[24:31] these uh religious zealots act
[24:35] very interesting to ponder that and
[24:36] think about it but
[24:38] moab represents a carnal religion and
[24:40] even
[24:41] a religious politics lot
[24:44] was the nephew of abraham the brother
[24:47] man pointing that out a number of
[24:49] different places points it out
[24:50] to identify that there was kinship then
[24:52] with moab
[24:54] and abraham's family there there would
[24:57] be a relationship here there would be
[24:59] some sort of kinship
[25:00] to him and we'll find in these
[25:02] statements we're reading tonight
[25:03] moab they the moabites were not heathens
[25:08] they there was something in their
[25:10] genesis and in their beginning
[25:12] remember our brother-in-law says if it
[25:13] starts off wrong where it ends up
[25:15] but in their beginning they were not
[25:16] heathens and i want i want you to ponder
[25:18] it this way they're
[25:19] so close
[25:22] to the truth even the historians suggest
[25:26] that the moabites and the israelites
[25:29] probably understood one another's
[25:30] language because they were so closely
[25:33] related
[25:34] this is an outstanding statement here
[25:36] that brother madam writes this in the
[25:38] church book chapter 5 page 202 paragraph
[25:40] 1
[25:40] he says you remember who moab was he was
[25:43] the son of lot by one of his own
[25:44] daughters
[25:45] lot in turn was a nephew of abraham so
[25:48] israel and moab were related i want you
[25:51] to see that
[25:52] and so when we think about moab there's
[25:54] some sort of kinship in relationship
[25:56] to abraham and this statement here is so
[25:58] powerful the moabites knew the truth
[26:01] whether they lived up to it or not
[26:04] this is this is the condition of being a
[26:06] moabite you can know the truth
[26:09] claim to have relationship to the truth
[26:11] be able to maybe describe and
[26:12] outline and diagram and give pay homage
[26:16] to the truth
[26:17] whether you live it or not that'd be a
[26:20] horrible condition to be in and he says
[26:21] this about the moabites
[26:22] they knew the truth whether it was
[26:24] exhibited in their conduct or their
[26:26] lifestyle
[26:27] they were so close to it where they knew
[26:29] what it was
[26:30] and so this is the moabites very very
[26:32] close they know the truth
[26:34] even if they're not living up to it
[26:36] again and does god change his mind
[26:38] at paragraph 70 and israel of the old
[26:40] testament
[26:41] is a type of the bride of the new
[26:43] testament coming up out of the world
[26:45] marching on to the road to canaan
[26:48] or the canaan that we go to the
[26:50] millennium now i'd like to pick
[26:52] up on this particular thought
[26:55] next wednesday so if the musicians would
[26:56] come everybody can everyone also gets
[26:59] this burst of
[27:00] adrenaline like yes it's happening we're
[27:03] out before 8 o'clock
[27:06] but next wednesday i'd like to pick up
[27:07] on this
[27:09] this uh journey of israel and he says
[27:12] now is
[27:13] israel and how moab and i'll say just
[27:16] say here
[27:17] israel comes up to moab before they as
[27:20] their closest point before they enter
[27:21] the promised land
[27:23] so ponder this just think about it if
[27:25] brother ramy uses the millennium
[27:28] as our type here in being the bride
[27:30] coming out guess what the last
[27:32] land you've got to get out of before you
[27:35] can go into millennium
[27:36] is moab we've got to get out of a
[27:39] message moabite condition
[27:41] got to get out of a moabite mindset in
[27:43] order to cross over into the promised
[27:45] land
[27:46] so he says now verse 7 paragraph 71 now
[27:49] we notice moab here is the type of the
[27:51] church so
[27:53] you have the bride moab is the type of
[27:54] the church come out of her my people
[27:56] you see now that there's a church is the
[27:58] one type of entity you
[28:00] all are very taught very very well in
[28:02] that there's a church
[28:03] but the bride is called out of the
[28:04] church and so when he says church
[28:06] spiritual that relates to the bride but
[28:08] then you still have the church natural
[28:10] israel had just slew some kings and had
[28:12] routed the enemy killed off everything
[28:14] possessed the land
[28:15] and moved up by moab
[28:18] this is in the this is in the progress
[28:20] this is in the journey moab was by no
[28:22] means a heathen nation
[28:24] moab was a nation that served the same
[28:26] god that
[28:27] israel served we think moabites
[28:30] there's nothing they say there's a
[28:32] moabitess god and there was mobile
[28:34] midas religion this is something he says
[28:36] they serve the same god that israel
[28:38] served
[28:38] as we'll find as we amplify this further
[28:40] perhaps next week or the following week
[28:42] that whenever israel comes up to moab
[28:44] and balak is like whoa wait a minute
[28:46] what's going on here
[28:47] it says and god said to balaam
[28:51] and it's not strange and balaam's not
[28:53] like who are you the rock's not speaking
[28:55] to me who are you he knew he was
[28:58] think of this affinity this closeness
[29:00] this connection how close
[29:01] moab would be now skip to paragraph 74
[29:04] moab here is a type of such
[29:06] because they were an organized nation
[29:10] in their own land like in their
[29:11] denomination and there they had their
[29:13] own religions and their own religion was
[29:15] the same religion that israel had
[29:21] somebody at some point just go whoa
[29:24] wow that's the problem with preaching to
[29:27] people who are well taught you're not
[29:29] going to surprise him with anything
[29:30] like i'm like wow like yeah brother and
[29:32] we were we were reading that in the 80s
[29:36] ponder this now now as it relate to us
[29:38] they were organized
[29:40] nation organized like a denomination
[29:42] they had their own religion and the
[29:43] religion was the same religion israel
[29:44] had
[29:45] they were moabites and believed in
[29:47] jehovah god
[29:48] but they were an organized group of
[29:50] people
[29:52] so start to think about if they had if
[29:54] they they knew the truth
[29:57] they were not a heathen nation they
[29:59] served the same god that
[30:00] israel served they believed in jehovah
[30:03] god but then he says but they were or
[30:05] an organized group of people what is it
[30:08] that became their restriction
[30:10] what is it that's keeping them from
[30:12] being the people of god
[30:14] what is it that's keeping them from
[30:15] actually serving god fully
[30:17] and being the same as israel
[30:22] and now as they represent the natural
[30:24] church israel represents the spiritual
[30:26] church
[30:27] in its journey the spiritual church
[30:30] never settles down
[30:32] the spiritual church the spiritual bride
[30:34] member never
[30:36] arrives at an address and says this is
[30:39] it this is the message mecca we've
[30:42] arrived
[30:42] now we're just biding time until brother
[30:45] branham comes back
[30:46] or until the rapture happens but we've
[30:49] made it to mecca here we are we've
[30:51] arrived
[30:51] and this is the culmination of all god
[30:53] dealing with me and the message of the
[30:55] hour this is the culmination of the
[30:56] books this is the culmination of the
[30:57] tapes this is the culmination of my
[30:59] spiritual journey
[31:00] i've made it to the perfect message
[31:01] church and now that i'm here and we're
[31:03] organized we've got church order we've
[31:04] got structure we've got everything
[31:05] together
[31:06] now i'm here no you miss it you become a
[31:09] message moabite
[31:10] because the bride member is always in a
[31:12] journey
[31:13] and you could be born in the same church
[31:15] raised in the same church
[31:16] marry in a church raise your children in
[31:18] a church and you can see your children
[31:20] married often that church begin to have
[31:21] grandchildren at church
[31:22] and never leave that church and that's
[31:24] perfectly okay
[31:25] and and i would say preferred but that
[31:28] you
[31:28] never stop you are in a spiritual
[31:31] journey
[31:33] and by god's grace we can all look back
[31:35] and look at where we've been in our
[31:37] lives and say
[31:38] that i never stopped when i went to that
[31:40] church i never stopped when i was
[31:41] fellowshipping with that church
[31:43] because i was always in a spiritual
[31:44] journey
[31:46] praise the lord the spiritual church in
[31:49] its journey now israel was not an
[31:51] organized nation
[31:52] still reading the same place they were
[31:55] not an organized nation
[31:56] as long as they followed god they were
[31:59] independent
[32:02] elimelech my god my king
[32:05] abandons israel and go wisdom goes into
[32:08] moab foreshadowing what
[32:10] that israel one day would want to be
[32:11] like moab
[32:13] that israel one day would reject god and
[32:16] become organized as a nation
[32:18] under a king would then institute
[32:20] structure and order and conscript armies
[32:22] and do all sorts of things
[32:23] why this is because as long as they
[32:26] followed god
[32:27] they were independent
[32:30] this is to the individual we cannot hide
[32:32] behind church order
[32:34] for our salvation we cannot hide behind
[32:36] this structure we cannot hide behind the
[32:38] natural things
[32:39] we cannot hide behind the fact and think
[32:42] to ourselves that
[32:43] well and listen i'll say it this way and
[32:45] hopefully remember to come back to it we
[32:46] cannot hide behind the church structure
[32:48] seeing that as all as far as long as
[32:50] these components are in place
[32:51] everything's okay and i'm okay
[32:53] you are in a spiritual journey and what
[32:55] you want from
[32:56] church and what you want from hearing
[32:58] the word of god is something that is
[33:00] energizing you in motivating you and
[33:03] facilitating
[33:04] your maturing and your progress in that
[33:06] spiritual journey
[33:07] and that's independent of how a church
[33:10] as a collective is progressing
[33:12] because let's not fool ourselves just
[33:14] because we get a building
[33:16] doesn't mean we've matured as a church
[33:19] and just because we get a facility that
[33:21] we can call our own
[33:23] and brother john doesn't have to come
[33:24] here two hours early and start setting
[33:26] up and brother mitch doesn't have to be
[33:27] here early and brothers don't have to
[33:29] stay late to territory
[33:30] let's not pat ourselves on the back and
[33:31] say we've arrived if we stay in here 10
[33:34] years
[33:34] but we're maturing and growing and
[33:37] seeing the soul
[33:38] saved and the spirit of god moving in
[33:40] our midst we're on our spiritual journey
[33:43] and if we never find a permanent
[33:44] dwelling here we can say thank god as
[33:46] long as we take that step
[33:48] as individuals into a body change job
[33:50] well done
[33:52] purpose satisfied we do not exist to try
[33:56] to
[33:56] settle down and organize and figure out
[33:58] all the natural elements as long as god
[34:00] is meeting the spiritual needs we'll
[34:01] rejoice in that
[34:04] i believe god's going to give us a
[34:05] permanent facility but more than that i
[34:07] just love to see as we're seeing
[34:09] the progress in the spiritual journey of
[34:12] the kingdom delegates
[34:13] are you progressing spiritually are you
[34:16] growing in the word of god let's just
[34:17] focus on that
[34:18] the building will take care of itself as
[34:21] souls are saved and people are healed
[34:23] and people are energized by the word of
[34:25] god god will provide the natural things
[34:27] in their time let's just seek his
[34:29] kingdom in this spiritual journey
[34:31] he'll add all the natural things that we
[34:33] need
[34:36] so we don't hide behind church order
[34:38] it's the individual that is part of the
[34:40] spiritual church
[34:42] i would like to believe that arizona
[34:43] chur believers church is a spiritual
[34:45] church
[34:46] but we're not the spiritual church we
[34:49] are
[34:49] uh we are kingdom delegates that have
[34:52] gathered together and fellowship
[34:53] together
[34:54] and bringing together church order and
[34:56] growing and how things being set into
[34:57] place and
[34:58] we'll watch how the deacons are ordained
[35:01] and trustees take their offices and
[35:04] different things will begin to come
[35:05] together
[35:05] and those parts will take their place
[35:08] and we'll see those things happening
[35:09] and in that way we are a collection of
[35:12] individuals
[35:13] who are following god and the own
[35:14] leadership the holy spirit who are our
[35:16] desires to see god move
[35:18] and we take individual responsibility of
[35:20] that
[35:22] and not just thinking well if we could
[35:23] just find
[35:25] the place the church
[35:28] one of the lessons i've been pondering
[35:30] in this whole story of elimelech and it
[35:31] just hasn't seemed
[35:33] um to find its place but i guess this is
[35:36] just where it hits
[35:37] the grass is always greener
[35:41] in the church that we stream right
[35:44] man i could just move there
[35:48] if i could just move there every
[35:52] problem solved
[35:56] right
[35:59] or is that nervous laughter like
[36:02] no we've never thought that i know i was
[36:05] taught my neighbor in the apartment next
[36:06] door and they mentioned they wanted to
[36:08] move
[36:09] you know to lima because that's where
[36:11] all the bride's gonna end up or
[36:12] johnson city i mean i know they
[36:14] mentioned it but
[36:16] i mean me no
[36:20] it always looks better in the production
[36:24] it's always better when you just stream
[36:26] a service did you hear this person got
[36:27] healed did you see their worship sir did
[36:28] you see this did you hear this
[36:30] it always seems greener eliminate left
[36:32] where he was supposed to be
[36:33] and went where he thought there would be
[36:35] greener
[36:39] it's pastures alerts the attraction of
[36:41] trying to be a part of something
[36:43] big and great and and nice and
[36:45] attractive and
[36:46] has all these different things and
[36:47] things that we can enjoy and we kind of
[36:49] take comfort him well i know i'm not
[36:51] where i need to be but sister so-and-so
[36:53] got healed and
[36:54] i don't really feel that i'm really have
[36:55] the kind of faith that i need and i
[36:57] don't know if i'm foolish virgin or the
[36:58] bride
[36:59] but man this church really is dynamic
[37:01] isn't it man this guy can really preach
[37:03] and
[37:03] really and the gifts are working and the
[37:05] worship service is awesome and man have
[37:07] you heard that choir lately and you kind
[37:09] of feel better about it all right
[37:11] no no what's most important
[37:15] is that you as an individual are finding
[37:18] peace with god
[37:20] that you're finding peace with god that
[37:22] you're led of god
[37:23] that you're you're auditing yourself on
[37:25] a regular basis and saying
[37:27] it it's it's it's wonderful to have a
[37:28] church that has these different things
[37:30] it's wonderful to experience church
[37:32] services like that
[37:33] but at the end of the day god it's got
[37:34] to be moving my heart and changing me
[37:37] and making a difference for me
[37:42] so now brother branham when he takes the
[37:43] same thought and does god change his
[37:45] mind in los
[37:46] angeles a couple weeks later he says so
[37:49] now
[37:50] to outline this we know that balaam was
[37:52] a prophet
[37:54] and balak was the king of moab at the
[37:57] time and i'd like to get into the
[37:58] these specifics but we're just kind of
[38:00] backgrounding moab and this is wonderful
[38:02] way of just kind of getting these
[38:03] elements out there
[38:04] he says and they were not infidels
[38:07] up at moab they served the same god that
[38:10] israel served
[38:12] because moab the nation was founded by a
[38:13] lot son by his daughter and so they
[38:15] serve the same god if you notice their
[38:18] sacrifices and everything we're just
[38:20] exactly the same bullocks and also rams
[38:22] speaking of the second coming
[38:23] talks about in different places i
[38:25] believe i have it here this evening
[38:26] seven altars and seven rams and
[38:28] everything was perfectly sevens all
[38:29] these things
[38:30] everything was just perfectly typed
[38:33] all these the the numerology and all
[38:36] this elements everything that you would
[38:38] need
[38:39] he says and now if fundamentalism so
[38:42] what he's identifying
[38:43] is in serving the same god having the
[38:46] appropriate sacrifices having the right
[38:48] language the right numerology the right
[38:50] doctrines the right theology the right
[38:51] works and everything in place that's
[38:53] fundamentalism
[38:55] he says if fundamentalism is all that
[38:57] god requires then moab was just as
[38:59] fundamental in
[39:00] his offering as what israel was
[39:04] are you pondering this considering this
[39:07] we're not looking at this historically
[39:08] to try to figure out well what made moab
[39:10] different from israel
[39:11] what am i going to be facing today as an
[39:13] individual what is what is going to be
[39:15] the
[39:15] hold on me am i going to get caught in
[39:18] fundamentalism
[39:19] and being fundamental find my safety and
[39:21] fundamentalism
[39:22] but i fail in the spiritual journey and
[39:24] i'm not growing
[39:25] because i become fundamental and i miss
[39:28] the connection
[39:29] with the dynamics that are necessary in
[39:31] order to be maturing as a christian
[39:36] but we find them now israel oh so
[39:39] beautiful
[39:40] is in the line of following the word of
[39:42] god
[39:43] to that land that had been promised to
[39:45] them
[39:47] so the attraction of moab is to settle
[39:49] down in some sort of fundamentalism
[39:51] some sort of organization some kind of
[39:53] structure and then to get complacent and
[39:55] relaxed within this mindset this
[39:57] denominationalism
[39:58] but the true spiritual church is in the
[40:00] line of following the word of god to the
[40:02] land that is promised to them
[40:04] remember how our whole inspiration in
[40:06] starting this series on being hungry
[40:08] is that the rapture is on and the living
[40:11] bread of life
[40:11] that is going to translate our bodies is
[40:14] available to every bride member
[40:16] and so here we see the very lines of
[40:18] redemption and the story of ruth
[40:20] and there's a hidden revelation that
[40:22] when you catch it it can bring you close
[40:24] to god
[40:24] and what we're seeing is that we've got
[40:26] to break out of a moabite mindset
[40:31] follow the line of god's word to the
[40:33] land that's promised to us
[40:35] here would be a type of the natural and
[40:38] spiritual meeting and now this
[40:40] is this is powerful the way that he says
[40:43] this
[40:43] so extraordinary and i i just want i
[40:46] hope that it just
[40:47] impacts you as we hear this here would
[40:49] be a type of the natural and spiritual
[40:51] meeting
[40:52] and when the natural and spiritual meets
[40:54] there's always a collision
[40:58] because they run right head on into each
[41:01] other
[41:02] this is the conflict this is the
[41:04] resistance
[41:06] this is the pressure a moabite pressure
[41:11] to to fight against and to stop
[41:14] the believer's momentum i'm going to a
[41:18] land that's promised to me
[41:19] and now you come up against a moab and
[41:21] he says it's a natural
[41:22] church that now fights against the
[41:25] spiritual
[41:27] and when the natural and spiritual meets
[41:29] there's always a collision
[41:30] because they run right head on into each
[41:32] other some of us just may have a little
[41:34] bit of a concussion from the collision
[41:38] but shake the cobwebs let the
[41:39] butterflies go the whirly birds running
[41:41] around your head shake them off
[41:43] get it together hold yourself together
[41:45] there was a collision
[41:46] but now you know what the collision was
[41:49] now you know why there was a collision
[41:50] now you know why there was a conflict
[41:52] because you are
[41:53] the spiritual church on your way to the
[41:56] promised land
[41:57] and you just had to run head-on into
[41:58] moabite in order to make it there you
[42:02] have the collision because you're
[42:03] the spiritual church he says in israel
[42:06] here
[42:06] would i want to represent as a spiritual
[42:09] church and moab is the natural church
[42:11] just the church what we call church
[42:12] natural
[42:14] just a natural church that can be just
[42:17] as fundamental and
[42:18] perfect in the doctrine and church order
[42:21] of the message
[42:24] natural church and we're all sure that
[42:26] there is a church and there's a bride
[42:28] coming out of that church he says we
[42:30] know that
[42:31] that that is true and they clash here
[42:35] there's a clash and we notice that when
[42:37] they clashed here
[42:38] it come under something that i would
[42:40] like to speak a moment on
[42:42] as soon as they clashed and one seen
[42:44] what the other one was doing
[42:46] there was a great impersonation one of
[42:48] the other
[42:51] this is the nature of moab instead of
[42:54] changing
[42:56] from natural to spiritual and giving the
[42:58] momentum of the move of god into the
[43:00] promised land
[43:02] they just impersonate what god's doing
[43:08] and this is the time when i would like
[43:09] you to stop thinking about
[43:11] the church your neighbor in the
[43:12] apartment next door goes to
[43:14] and think about your own individual
[43:16] conflicts and your collision
[43:19] and this you're you're gonna have to
[43:21] confront this mobile mindset in your own
[43:23] life
[43:24] and so when there's a collision and the
[43:25] other sees what the others doing he says
[43:27] there's just a great impersonation that
[43:28] takes place
[43:30] so moabite is religious fundamental very
[43:32] religious
[43:34] organized all these different types and
[43:36] things that brother brand brings out how
[43:37] perfectly
[43:38] in sync they were they worshipped the
[43:40] same god as israel did they
[43:42] they had the same kind of fundamentalism
[43:43] he says but now there's an impersonation
[43:46] they're going to impersonate these
[43:47] elements that made israel different
[43:49] in paragraph 78 he continues that day
[43:52] when he was preaching in los angeles
[43:53] now we find here that this carnal
[43:55] impersonation that moab had
[43:58] think about this element of the moabites
[44:02] to impersonate he saw this prophet among
[44:06] israel that was able to bless curse lead
[44:07] and so forth
[44:08] so it tries to match it and this part i
[44:10] want you to catch by politics
[44:15] there's a way that we can try to become
[44:19] the bride not by yielding to the
[44:23] spiritual
[44:24] dynamics of the word of god but by
[44:27] impersonating
[44:28] and by politics
[44:32] there's a way that we can try to match
[44:36] what the move of god should be through
[44:39] politics
[44:41] through implementing through
[44:42] impersonating this is heavy
[44:46] we all should give a brother hughes
[44:48] woohoo
[44:50] this is heavy now that's just what's
[44:53] taking place in the churches today
[44:56] they have tried to match it with some
[44:58] kind of system
[45:00] what is it it's the spirit of moab
[45:03] system some kind of system you can't do
[45:07] it
[45:07] the holy spirit must be alive in the
[45:09] church always
[45:10] leading the church for the age that it's
[45:12] living in to confirm the word that's
[45:14] promised for that age
[45:16] god spoke the word from the beginning
[45:18] and so much for this age and so much for
[45:20] that age and certain for them age
[45:22] it's always happened just that way and
[45:23] see the holy spirit must be alive in the
[45:26] church
[45:26] to make this church live in its day
[45:29] it must be here today to confirm this
[45:32] latter day ministry
[45:33] latter day signs latter day pour out of
[45:35] the holy ghost it's just got to be there
[45:37] to do that
[45:38] and you cannot get it through working of
[45:41] systems
[45:43] cannot be through politics it cannot be
[45:45] through impersonation
[45:47] it cannot be through legislation it
[45:48] cannot be through organization
[45:50] it cannot be through structure it's
[45:52] gotta be by the holy spirit working
[45:55] in the word for this time that we're
[45:57] living in
[45:58] not trying to go back and impersonate
[46:00] what god did on the day of pentecost go
[46:02] back impersonate what happened
[46:03] at the birth of the laodicean church
[46:05] it's got to be the word for this time
[46:07] this moment that we're living in
[46:10] and where we make our mistakes is when
[46:11] we try to impersonate oh
[46:13] the gift's working and this happened and
[46:15] that happened we need a system that
[46:17] facilitates this operation
[46:18] we need a system that emphasizes this
[46:21] and lifts this up and
[46:22] puts this before the people no we need
[46:24] god's spirit to move and where god's
[46:26] spirit is moving
[46:27] people will be healed where god's spirit
[46:28] is moving the gifts will be moving where
[46:31] god's word is preached
[46:32] the vindication of it will be in signs
[46:35] and wonders following
[46:36] they'll be souls saved there'll be sick
[46:38] people healed
[46:40] listen the testimonies that we could
[46:42] share as a body in the several months
[46:44] that we've been together
[46:45] god is doing miraculous things of
[46:48] physical healings
[46:49] restoration of marriages the backsliding
[46:52] being saved
[46:53] atheists being converted god is moving
[46:58] but we don't produce a system to where
[46:59] that has the emphasis and that becomes
[47:01] the point and
[47:02] we're all trying to lift that up and
[47:03] make that happen and conjure it up
[47:05] let the word have preeminence because he
[47:08] said god has a system
[47:09] he's the one who has to give us the holy
[47:11] spirit he's the one who has given us
[47:14] the holy spirit so we have to have a
[47:17] system yeah just make sure it's god's
[47:18] system
[47:21] church does not ever replace or
[47:23] substitute god's system
[47:26] and let me say this church is not god's
[47:29] system
[47:30] it's a part of it it's part of it
[47:35] this is an important part of it so much
[47:38] so that i believe
[47:40] i had absolute confidence that when the
[47:42] pandemic kit and church door started
[47:44] closing
[47:45] i just felt in my heart i said we're
[47:47] either going to be raptured here very
[47:49] soon or we're getting back to church
[47:52] because it's part of god's program it's
[47:54] part of god's system
[47:56] and here we are we're back at church i
[47:58] mean god has more work to be done
[48:01] i believe they're souls that need to be
[48:02] saved there are people that are hungry
[48:04] for this
[48:08] he says now we find out here
[48:11] carnal impersonations matching the word
[48:14] of god by politics
[48:16] match it with some kind of system it's
[48:18] an impersonation of god's system
[48:22] so let's let's think of this in somewhat
[48:24] of a review moab represents
[48:27] religious fundamentalism message
[48:29] fundamentalism
[48:30] how about we just say that just to
[48:34] make everybody a little bit
[48:35] uncomfortable
[48:38] it represents a system of organization
[48:41] a system of politics that messes
[48:44] churches aren't immune from
[48:46] a collection of message churches that
[48:49] fellowship together
[48:51] is not are not immune from and that we
[48:53] as individuals
[48:54] are not immune from therefore god has to
[48:57] give us
[48:58] he has to give us a word to combat that
[49:02] and this is where i'd like to i'd like
[49:04] to use this in closing as kind of a way
[49:06] to transition
[49:07] into
[49:10] what happened when israel in their
[49:12] exodus on their way to the promised land
[49:14] which we can recognize ourselves as a
[49:16] member of
[49:18] we identify with israel as the bride
[49:20] going to her millennium
[49:21] change of body in our next place and
[49:23] moab then
[49:24] stops and resists them i want you to
[49:27] kind of catch this just as this would
[49:29] kind of be a
[49:29] maybe a little bit of a pivot point
[49:33] moab with their fundamentalism their
[49:35] system of organization
[49:37] their politics and as brother branham
[49:40] said that they had their own religion
[49:41] they had settled they had everything
[49:42] together and there's so many different
[49:43] statements
[49:44] that we could have read how organized
[49:46] they were they had their
[49:47] he says in one place they had their
[49:48] fighters they had their
[49:50] workers they had everything just perfect
[49:52] they had their board they had their
[49:54] members
[49:54] everything was so established and
[49:56] everything was so robust and well-oiled
[49:58] it was a machine
[49:59] he's saying they had all of this but one
[50:01] thing it did to them
[50:03] gave them a little bit of an air of
[50:04] superiority
[50:08] and so whenever israel comes
[50:11] when they see israel coming their
[50:13] instinct isn't this is our family
[50:17] these are our brothers and our sisters
[50:19] that are coming
[50:20] when they looked at israel they kind of
[50:22] had this little bit of air of
[50:24] superiority to think
[50:25] this is our stepsister right
[50:29] this wasn't our sister coming this is we
[50:31] have
[50:32] family ties and here they come and
[50:34] they're coming into the land what can we
[50:36] do to support them what can we do to
[50:37] help them
[50:38] there of their father abraham which was
[50:40] a was the uncle to our father
[50:42] lot and our who through which moab came
[50:45] and have some sort of closest how can we
[50:46] help you in
[50:47] in your journey in what you're doing but
[50:49] they had a little bit of arrogance
[50:50] whenever
[50:51] israel showed up
[50:54] and brother adam says and does god
[50:55] change his mind now they found out
[50:57] moab looking upon it balak the king he
[51:00] looked down upon the nation of israel
[51:03] he looked down on him brother branham
[51:06] writes in the church age book page 204
[51:08] certainly moab looked down on her
[51:13] now catch this if you can think about
[51:15] this
[51:16] in how we're trying to pose these things
[51:19] moab is the natural church
[51:23] israel is the bride of the spiritual
[51:24] church
[51:26] and these dynamics can even work within
[51:28] ourselves
[51:31] and there's a mentality that we can have
[51:32] to where the message moabite mindset
[51:35] can look down on the humility
[51:39] and the meekness of a true spiritual
[51:41] believer
[51:43] and we wrestle with this idea that no we
[51:45] we want things to be
[51:46] a certain way or to appear a certain way
[51:48] we want to have a appear a certain way
[51:50] and it's the pretense it's the politics
[51:52] it's the impersonation
[51:54] and just as it can work within the
[51:56] individual this denominationalism
[51:58] is any kind of man-made system whether
[52:00] it be your own within yourself
[52:02] to keep you from following god's word or
[52:04] even a church structure a church mindset
[52:06] or a collection of churches or even a
[52:07] spirit that can be on
[52:09] a movement that identifies around
[52:11] something and it's just a message
[52:13] by mindset that kind of has this
[52:16] uh air of superiority and arrogance to
[52:19] look down on a true
[52:20] spiritual son or daughter of god or move
[52:22] of god
[52:26] he says certainly moab looked down on
[52:28] her all the other nations did too
[52:30] organizations always look down on the
[52:33] unorganized
[52:34] somebody say see honey that's why i
[52:36] don't keep a clean room
[52:37] that's why my desk is an absolute mess
[52:40] oh organization always looks down on the
[52:42] unorganized
[52:43] that can be applicable in so many
[52:44] different ways right
[52:47] those people have ocd and everything's
[52:48] just really neat you go into somebody's
[52:50] pantry and everything's organized by
[52:52] calorie count and color coded and it's
[52:54] like
[52:55] wow and then they see yours and
[52:58] organization looks down on then
[53:00] organized
[53:00] did you see her pantry it was awful
[53:04] they had soups mixed up and their pastas
[53:07] were all just in one basket you couldn't
[53:08] tell one from the other
[53:12] organization always looks down on the
[53:14] unorganized
[53:16] but now we're looking at this this
[53:17] conflict remember the collision
[53:20] the organized well-oiled well in place
[53:22] well-established
[53:24] we want we want to hide behind structure
[53:26] we want to hide behind
[53:28] humanity and flesh we want to hide
[53:30] behind these things but then there's a
[53:31] collision
[53:32] and the organize looks down on this
[53:36] unorganized and either will by
[53:39] determination
[53:40] bring them into organization or destroy
[53:43] them when they won't come
[53:46] why is there a collision we want you
[53:49] to become like us
[53:54] and he pondered that and think about it
[53:55] someone's taking a voice note
[54:00] it's not that one day all of a sudden
[54:02] israel showed up and they're like who
[54:03] are you again are we
[54:04] related we have distant cousins i follow
[54:06] you on facebook you know yeah yeah
[54:08] no moab had heard about israel's fame
[54:13] moab knew what god was doing
[54:17] moab knew exactly how powerful
[54:21] god was vindicating israel
[54:24] god they knew that god had brought him
[54:26] out of egypt with the mighty hand
[54:28] god they had heard about the red sea
[54:30] partying they had heard about
[54:31] the things that god was doing they had
[54:34] heard what they had just done to the
[54:35] king of the ammonites they had heard
[54:37] what they had done to eat them
[54:38] they knew that this was a mighty move of
[54:40] god that god was bringing them out and
[54:42] they knew that god was leading them to
[54:44] their
[54:44] destiny they knew the promise they were
[54:48] ordained to possess
[54:49] that land on the other side of jordan
[54:51] our neighbors just beyond the dead sea
[54:53] our neighbors just beyond the jordan
[54:54] river that's who's going to be our
[54:56] neighbor
[54:57] they saw exactly what was happening and
[54:59] instead of rejoicing
[55:01] and facilitating they hated israel
[55:05] hated him when they thought about what
[55:07] god was doing for him and moab felt
[55:09] threatened by her
[55:13] moab could have said hey let's help you
[55:15] out here let's do what we can to support
[55:16] you we
[55:17] will always have your flank we can all
[55:18] this is our land this is where we belong
[55:20] this is where we're this is what we're
[55:21] called to be we can't be anything more
[55:23] than this
[55:23] but if god's leading you to do something
[55:25] i don't want to be in your way
[55:28] isn't that what we're taught in the
[55:29] message of the hour this is what i
[55:30] believe this is where i'm at but if you
[55:31] believe god's calling you higher don't
[55:33] let me hinder you
[55:34] don't let me stop you i wouldn't want to
[55:36] stand in your way
[55:40] but they felt threatened by israel feel
[55:43] threatened by the spiritual church
[55:45] and got so bitter against her
[55:49] now this will tie into the future so
[55:51] they had to concoct a plan to make her
[55:53] fall
[55:57] because moab looked down on her
[56:00] i think some of you will probably do it
[56:02] and you'll read into it
[56:04] brother bam goes into great detail
[56:06] describing the women of moab and the
[56:07] women of israel
[56:10] and the churches of moab always look a
[56:12] lot prettier
[56:13] than the true church of israel
[56:16] i say always it's somewhat of a
[56:19] generalization there
[56:21] but it's the tendency of the human part
[56:24] to be drawn to the natural part
[56:30] this is going to seem like just a total
[56:32] rip the needle off the record but turn
[56:33] to first kings
[56:35] chapter 10 verses 1 and 2.
[56:40] they had heard of israel's fame
[56:43] and instead of being who they were
[56:48] instead of being happy in their land and
[56:50] what they had and what they possessed
[56:53] instead of being confident in their uh
[56:56] promise and their provision
[56:58] they felt threatened by israel they
[56:59] hated her moab looked down on her this
[57:01] little stepsister balak looked down on
[57:04] upon the nation of israel
[57:07] in first kings chapter 10 verses 1 and 2
[57:09] it says when the queen of sheba heard of
[57:10] the fame of solomon concerning the name
[57:12] of the lord
[57:14] she came to prove him with hard
[57:15] questions
[57:18] she's coming because she wants to know
[57:20] is this real is this true
[57:22] perhaps moab could have proved israel
[57:24] with some hard questions
[57:26] is it god that has done this and what
[57:27] promise are you going by and what has
[57:29] happened we heard of this and we heard
[57:30] of that
[57:31] if god is with you can this be so in
[57:33] these different things she came to prove
[57:34] him with hard questions
[57:35] but notice she came with verse two and
[57:38] she came to jerusalem
[57:41] here's another gentile
[57:45] coming to jerusalem coming to israel
[57:48] hearing of this fame
[57:50] with a great very great train with
[57:52] camels
[57:53] that bear spices and very much gold
[57:57] and precious stones and these weren't
[57:59] her travelers checks to make sure she
[58:01] could buy gas and provisions on her way
[58:03] and have something to eat when she got
[58:04] there
[58:04] she had this because if those hard
[58:06] questions were answered
[58:08] this was something she wanted to support
[58:11] this is something she wanted to show
[58:13] that she favored that she believed in
[58:15] she was excited about it was worth worth
[58:17] getting behind
[58:18] and when she come to solomon she
[58:20] communed with him all
[58:22] that was in her heart
[58:25] in other words if she if he had the
[58:27] answers and brother brown brings this
[58:28] part out
[58:29] if solomon had the answers to her
[58:31] question then she was going to
[58:33] give all these spices all this gold
[58:36] and all these precious stones she was
[58:38] going to give it to the one
[58:39] that could answer these hard questions
[58:43] she wasn't going to just come and
[58:44] benefit by it and have all these hard
[58:46] questions
[58:46] answered like okay you guys are legit
[58:48] we're going to stay out of your way but
[58:49] there
[58:50] and she didn't fall for the moab side to
[58:52] her she looked down on this kingdom this
[58:54] king
[58:54] what is he doing and all this fame he's
[58:56] richer than ever
[58:57] anyone in the world he has wisdom too
[58:59] and he's building all these great
[59:00] palaces the queen of sheba could have
[59:02] felt threatened by it
[59:03] i'm a queen i'm royalty i have wealth
[59:06] and i have riches and i have trains and
[59:08] i have spices and i have gold
[59:09] and i have i have all sorts of amenities
[59:12] and and then begin to compete
[59:14] and fight listen we are never ever ever
[59:17] competing as message believers
[59:19] we are never competing as a church we
[59:21] have one adversary
[59:22] one enemy that's anything anti-word
[59:25] that's what we stand against there
[59:27] is no competition
[59:30] if we win as chur as a church if we win
[59:34] as believers while we're competing
[59:35] there's no joy in victory
[59:40] zilch not a zero
[59:44] nunca nothing
[59:47] if we do it by competing but instead of
[59:50] her competing what happened
[59:52] she said i want to go see is god really
[59:55] moving
[59:56] and i'm going to ask some hard questions
[1:00:00] and if he's got the answers i'm going to
[1:00:02] support it
[1:00:03] i'm going to give to it i'm going to i'm
[1:00:07] going to show that this is something
[1:00:08] this is of god and this is something
[1:00:10] worth worth succeeding and
[1:00:13] and show that pay that homage and
[1:00:15] brother abraham says this this is our
[1:00:16] last statement before we
[1:00:18] i have you to stand in the presence of
[1:00:21] god unrecognized he said that woman
[1:00:22] could teach pentecostals
[1:00:26] that woman could teach us yes sir
[1:00:29] support things out there that
[1:00:30] laugh and make fun of divine healing
[1:00:33] this is what moab did
[1:00:35] moab looked down on israel laughed about
[1:00:37] her stories laughed about her
[1:00:39] testimonies
[1:00:40] laughed about the things that they did
[1:00:41] laughter look at these people look at
[1:00:43] how
[1:00:43] look at how they're living and look how
[1:00:45] unorganized they are look what they're
[1:00:46] doing
[1:00:47] and and they laughed at them and they
[1:00:48] says wait this is teach them about the
[1:00:50] pentecostals
[1:00:51] let's just put ourselves in this
[1:00:52] position we as message believers can
[1:00:54] learn
[1:00:55] something from the queen of sheba the
[1:00:57] queen of sheba that means seven this
[1:00:59] queen
[1:01:00] that comes out of these seven church
[1:01:01] ages there's such a beautiful type
[1:01:03] of us who's been raised up at the last
[1:01:05] days to
[1:01:06] judge the nominal cold formal church
[1:01:08] world here you are as a bride
[1:01:10] member we can learn something from this
[1:01:12] queen of sheba
[1:01:16] to not support things that laugh and
[1:01:18] make fun of divine healing
[1:01:20] and yet you support the radio programs
[1:01:23] instead of your church
[1:01:26] i think about this the support
[1:01:30] going to radio programs
[1:01:33] let's just think very broadly i think
[1:01:37] even very specific
[1:01:38] in your life the support the time the
[1:01:39] attention even the money
[1:01:41] and the resources that you'll give to
[1:01:43] political causes of the religious causes
[1:01:45] even other things and you give it to it
[1:01:47] but yet when it comes right down to it
[1:01:50] they laugh and make fun of the very
[1:01:52] things you believe in
[1:01:57] think about it
[1:02:00] how much how much support would you get
[1:02:03] from your senator
[1:02:07] they found out what you really believed
[1:02:12] how how kind would trump be to you
[1:02:17] if he found out what the word has to say
[1:02:20] about a man of his character
[1:02:23] let's be honest i did have we finally
[1:02:27] i'm all said i'm feeling something well
[1:02:28] up inside of me
[1:02:31] that is that is beyond me right now
[1:02:34] there used to be enough character and
[1:02:35] backbone
[1:02:36] with men of god that would stand up
[1:02:38] against nonsense
[1:02:40] and adultery in filth and perversion
[1:02:43] in leaders and every prophet
[1:02:47] was characterized that from the very
[1:02:48] beginning and brother branham was
[1:02:50] characterized
[1:02:51] he wasn't afraid to call sin out and
[1:02:53] have we gotten to a place where we're
[1:02:54] afraid to speak against
[1:02:56] ungodly perverted men because they're
[1:02:58] political causes
[1:03:00] in social platforms aligned with ours
[1:03:04] because of their economic policies are
[1:03:06] more aligned with what our ambitions are
[1:03:08] in business
[1:03:09] god forbid we stand as truth
[1:03:13] we stand for truth and we support things
[1:03:16] that when in reality
[1:03:17] if fox news ever really got a whiff of
[1:03:19] what we believe that tucker carlson
[1:03:21] would make fun of us to no end
[1:03:26] somebody somehow passed a message to
[1:03:28] rush limbaugh about what we believe he'd
[1:03:29] be rolling
[1:03:30] at his grave they don't they don't
[1:03:34] support you because you believe
[1:03:35] in pro-life they don't support you
[1:03:37] because you don't believe
[1:03:39] believe in the decriminalization of
[1:03:40] marijuana they don't support you
[1:03:42] because your tied this just like they
[1:03:44] are
[1:03:45] that's not even what makes us who we are
[1:03:48] that's not what we're identified with
[1:03:50] well i don't believe that marijuana
[1:03:51] should be legal and i don't believe that
[1:03:52] you know man should marry a man and that
[1:03:54] that's not our identification
[1:03:56] that's politics that's a moral bite
[1:04:00] mindset
[1:04:01] we're in a spiritual journey we're not
[1:04:03] building a platform for political causes
[1:04:05] we're not trying to identify ourselves
[1:04:07] with some sort of political affiliation
[1:04:09] wake up
[1:04:10] wake up god's calling us to a rapture
[1:04:14] we've got to get out of these things
[1:04:15] that are holding us back
[1:04:20] if this is what has to shake you and get
[1:04:22] your attention
[1:04:23] you know if they knew what you believed
[1:04:25] they'd laugh at you
[1:04:28] am i telling the truth and it's time to
[1:04:31] get behind
[1:04:33] the word of god support something that
[1:04:36] gets the message out to where it needs
[1:04:38] to be
[1:04:40] support something that's going to
[1:04:41] facilitate a child of god coming to know
[1:04:43] truth
[1:04:45] let's stand forgive me
[1:04:50] it just that just is burning in my heart
[1:04:53] you'll find that there's
[1:04:55] a a dovetailing with
[1:05:00] what we're looking at on sundays
[1:05:05] how to even there's rioters who are now
[1:05:06] identifying
[1:05:09] the cult of trump
[1:05:12] just the same as the cult of the left
[1:05:16] and they have all the earmarks of
[1:05:20] religion
[1:05:24] i trust you know my heart i trust you
[1:05:27] understand what god's trying to say to
[1:05:28] you
[1:05:30] when it comes to the danger line of
[1:05:31] politics
[1:05:33] and causes and movements
[1:05:39] bower heads
[1:05:45] [Music]
[1:05:48] my gracious heavenly father
[1:05:54] i just want to say how clean it feels
[1:05:56] right now
[1:05:59] [Music]
[1:06:00] how your word is just scoured out things
[1:06:06] and how that we could even say as
[1:06:07] individuals we've been guilty
[1:06:09] [Music]
[1:06:10] of getting caught up
[1:06:14] with these moabite issues
[1:06:19] we had a collision
[1:06:23] and in the collision we kind of seemed
[1:06:24] to lose our way and maybe in this
[1:06:26] collision we kind of felt like we were
[1:06:27] part of that momentum
[1:06:29] of whatever collided with us but now
[1:06:31] lord
[1:06:32] there's something that is scouring us
[1:06:34] out washing us
[1:06:37] helping us to realize
[1:06:38] [Music]
[1:06:41] that we ought to show as decent human
[1:06:44] beings
[1:06:46] respect to another who disagrees with us
[1:06:48] politically
[1:06:51] and that if someone was to vote for
[1:06:53] biden
[1:06:54] that that's their prerogative as an
[1:06:56] american
[1:06:57] that's the right that's their choice if
[1:06:59] a believer
[1:07:01] voted for trump and felt that it best
[1:07:02] represented their political ideals or
[1:07:04] their objectives and
[1:07:06] matters that they felt were important
[1:07:07] whether it be uh the opportunity to
[1:07:09] homeschool or
[1:07:10] or some economic issue that those are
[1:07:14] things that
[1:07:14] are somebody's right that they're doing
[1:07:18] their civic duty to do those things
[1:07:21] there's there's a there's a process that
[1:07:26] we participate in that relates to our
[1:07:29] civic duty and our rights as americans
[1:07:34] but lord and every may we never make the
[1:07:37] mistake
[1:07:39] to think that those things are part of
[1:07:41] our rapturing
[1:07:45] may we never make the mistake of
[1:07:46] thinking that those ideals and those
[1:07:48] causes and our support of them is
[1:07:50] somehow
[1:07:51] protecting our ability to receive
[1:07:55] rapturing faith
[1:07:57] lord we could get so caught up in
[1:07:59] certain things as americans and not
[1:08:00] realize
[1:08:01] that there's bride around the world
[1:08:03] there's bride in china that's receiving
[1:08:05] rapturing faith in their political
[1:08:06] environment
[1:08:07] that does not have freedom of religion
[1:08:09] there's bride in europe lord that's
[1:08:11] coming
[1:08:11] to rapturing faith where there is no
[1:08:13] homeschool there's
[1:08:15] social uh socialized medicine lord
[1:08:17] there's
[1:08:18] and there's hate crime laws and there's
[1:08:20] a lot of restrictive things
[1:08:22] in their lives that certainly they're
[1:08:23] not supportive of and if they would
[1:08:25] change they would be happy to do it and
[1:08:27] lord somehow we get so caught up in
[1:08:28] things today and we begin to identify
[1:08:30] with certain ideals and
[1:08:32] movements and groups and we join in our
[1:08:35] these causes
[1:08:38] and we've lost our way
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:08:44] i don't feel that i've lost my point
[1:08:47] tonight or my
[1:08:49] uh leadership in this
[1:08:52] the lord we would be laughed at
[1:08:56] mocked and made fun of
[1:09:01] by a lot of these people if they knew
[1:09:02] what we believed

[1:09:08] for some time now just biding time and
[1:09:10] waiting
[1:09:11] for the moment to express this
[1:09:16] lord may we support your truth
[1:09:21] get behind your word and not be guilty
[1:09:25] of supporting
[1:09:26] radio programs and movements and systems
[1:09:28] that would laugh
[1:09:30] and mock and look down upon what we
[1:09:33] believe
[1:09:34] [Music]
[1:09:38] and give the right balance in these
[1:09:39] things lord
