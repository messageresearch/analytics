TRANSCRIPT
========================================
second timothy chapter three verses one to eight second timothy chapter three verses one to eight this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters prowl blasphemers disobedient to parents that's kind of a tough one to follow those other few but somehow being disobedient to your parents follows up blasphemers i think i think that's good for all of our kids to take notice of this morning and then unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god and then this statement here is very remarkable having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses the ones that really hold all these things in their hearts and second the second verse to the fourth verse but yet they have an influence he says they lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with diverse lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as janice and jamboree's withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith god bless you you can be seated i'm taking my thought this morning is blind trust bad faith and we spoke on it a little bit wednesday night and i just couldn't i felt so incomplete having preached only half my thought that i just felt that i just for my own sake i felt that i should probably take this service this morning and continue on the subject but then i just felt like the lord really came behind it and impressed something on my heart so i trust that you'll be able to follow me and i will make a few comments in the outset just to kind of touch on some of the things that we were expressing wednesday night but in blind trust bad faith we're kind of refocusing our faith so that we're certain that our faith is resting in the word alone that we haven't taken other things and kind of put it in the picture and it's kind of faith plus because that's not how it works uh we go by faith and we go by faith alone and so we're we're what we should be certain of is that we're trusting in the word that has been revealed to us and it's a word that's been confirmed to us we could be raised uh in it with under a particular truth and we hear certain things taught in it we don't disagree with it and we make it makes sense to us and we see it lived before so we accept it uh that it that it's beneficial and that has power but to to have faith in the word of god means there's some confirmation that drops down into your heart where you're just not following up in your parents footsteps believing what they believe but rather it's something that's been revealed personally to you and so in that there's this that's kind of what the desire is is that our faith could be very focused on the word of god but in the terminologies blind trust bad faith to have blind trust means you trust without any reason i want you to ponder this blind trust i'm not using the phrase blind faith because i think that kind of is a little bit confusing or could be a little bit misleading but blind trust it means you trust something without really having a reason to do it or it's believing something without a basis for believing or without an understanding really of what it is you believe and then bad faith would be the refusal to acknowledge a certain truth or refusal to acknowledge certain facts and in having that kind of bad faith where you don't want to believe something or you just refuse to acknowledge or take into consideration it could be a lack of honesty where someone is just intentionally being deceitful and intentionally does not want to acknowledge truth or there could be some level of the self-deception and because someone's been deceived and they're believing a lie they act in a way which is kind of in bad faith because it's not based upon truth and so the reason why i wouldn't want to use the phrase blind faith and i'm real rather calling it blind trust bad faith is our faith is not blind and our faith is not blind trust and if our faith is a blind trust where you really don't have a basis for believing or really any foundation for believing then your testimony is in bad faith if you're not really convinced of something if you're not really certain that it's true if it hasn't been disclosed to you it made known to you in such a way you're like i know this is the truth i know this is real and then kind of having that anchor in your soul and that's the that's from where you're testifying and i know this is true i know this is sure and you witness from that basis that that's a testimony in good faith but if you're not certain of it and you're not sure and you and you don't know that's uh there's some level and you're saying something well i know this is good for you and inside your heart going i don't really know if this is good that would be testifying in bad faith and so we want our testimony to be in good faith in order that we can be true witnesses we've got to be true witnesses in this hour and being a true witness is part of our calling in this last day to be the final voice to the final age if you don't have a voice there is no voice and so you are the final voice to the final age and there was a statement where brother branham references supreme faith and i didn't uh take this uh statement down um i didn't write down where i'd gotten it from uh now that i realized i'd like to quote more of it but he's referring to supreme faith and he says you cannot have that faith talk about supreme faith that would be the ultimate faith we could even say in some ways maybe it's a perfect faith you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you're doing so think about that you cannot have supreme faith you cannot have a perfect faith until you know perfectly what you're doing that kind of shifts things around a little bit because there's some there's things in the back of our minds where we say well you don't have to understand it just believe it that's true but that would be the beginning that god is the author of our faith well he's also the finisher or the perfecter of our faith so we have a genesis of our faith we have a faith that begins but then there's a faith we know that ought to grow into perfect faith or be loosed and let loose to be perfect faith and he's saying supreme faith to have supreme faith you have to know perfectly what you're doing so there's a knowledge attached with our faith that gives us this confidence and makes it very robust and makes it strong to go forward we made this uh we were this was just kind of sharing what was in my heart on wednesday night there's something so pure about the faith there's only one truth one lord one faith one baptism there's only one gospel there's so there's something so pure about that something so pure about the truth something so pure about the gospel it's not facts it's not data it's not science it's not just a discipline it's not just a way to live our lives and well this is a paradigm for me and my family and this works for us and if that works for you that's great there's something so pure and precious about being able to take god at his word there's something so wonderful about just being able to believe what he says isn't it wonderful to be able to to read the bible and know that no matter what what's written there that there's some truth in it there's some power behind him it's wonderful to know that we can just take god at his word and trust him absolutely and that that faith is so precious we should guard it oh it's this this attitude that i believe god whatever he says i trust him i i trust his word completely whatever god says is true whatever god does is just that that is an instinct and that is a precious gift that is so pure we ought to guard it with our hearts and that kind of faith and that kind of trust should never be misplaced this kind of instinct where you just trust god absolutely whatever he says i just believe it i trust it to have that kind of instinct and that kind of ability within our hearts we should never take that kind of trust and misplace it on anything else i hope you understand what i what i mean by that that we we have this faith that ought to be in truth alone and then we can kind of take that instinct to just believe everything and trust everything and be very trusting and very uh accepting and receiving we there's a there's a healthy suspicion that we ought to have for anyone else who's not divine right there's a statement i believe that i heard from an engineer i believe it might have been your dad brother loyal who has said he had a sticker at his uh in his office that said in god we trust everyone else bring data and uh i've held onto that for 18 years or however long it was since i first heard him say i was like amen to that i believe it and so that's that's how that we ought to be in god we trust everybody else better have something some proof and if you're gonna come contradicting god you're gonna come contradicting his word uh then then you better not just be saying something because we trust god anyone else who wants me to believe something's got to have something to back it up and if it's contrary to the word we reject it because god we trust in god so there's this is that's what i mean by that faith should never be misplaced because our belief and i want to expand upon this this morning our belief as christians has a basis our our faith as believers we have a reason that might seem a little bit contrary to some of the things we know in our hearts that you know faith doesn't reason but there's going to come to a little bit different perspective on that here in a minute but our belief our faith has a reason we could even say this that god has created in us faith to believe his word so the faith that we have we say god has created in me this faith to believe his word that that's the reason why i believe and when someone says well i just can't believe it we don't want to try to force it into him and say well let me put it in you and let me create in you of faith you say well then you realize the grace that god gave you to be able to believe his word because it's a supernatural creation where god creates in you the faith to believe his word and then this faith that he's created in us cannot be separated from the knowledge of the truth so there's a truth that exists there's one absolute there's one truth and then our faith is going to bring us into a knowledge of the truth so faith and truth are connected together could you could you say it and it makes sense say i have faith in a lion that would be double think that wouldn't make a lot of sense and so faith has to be connected with truth faith is connected with the revelation of god's word and if it's a revelation of god's word it's something positive it's a revelation of god's word it's something very real and so this is kind of where i think i left off on wednesday night is that with that kind of positive faith in that kind of uh that's where our faith should be oriented if we misunderstand faith if we kind of take faith and we don't really understand what it means then we can be easily tossed about you can say well i'm a believer i've got to believe then someone tells you one thing like well i'm a believer i've got to believe i'm a christian i need to be a christian and you start hearing these different voices and you can find yourself getting tossed about because you don't understand what your faith anchors in if you look in ephesians chapter 4 verses 13 to 15. does it sound like i'm in a box to you because i kind of am i'm in a three-sided box here and so i need to i need it you might need to a-man a little bit louder to kind of get it past the fourth wall here where i am up on this on this on the platform and i do appreciate your amens and your encouragement this morning in ephesians chapter four we know in verse 12 it lays out what we call the five-fold ministry it's five different ministering gifts that have been given to some but for the benefit of all as it says till we all come there's verses 13 to 15 till we all come in the unity of the faith this is something that when you read in the uh in the new testament they were calling it v faith the gospel something very precious something very peculiar and unique to the saints till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god so the unity of the faith is not apart from knowledge so we come into the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man under the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ brother brethren takes that and summarizes it as the stature of a perfect man and this is kind of the outcome now of this working of unity of the faith and knowledge of the son of god that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro so think about the object of the preaching of the word of god the object of my faith becoming stronger and all of us to come into the unity of the faith to come into this this the knowledge of the son of god and unto us the stature of a perfect man he's saying that this is going to stabilize you even as faith begins and there's a genesis of faith in your heart paul is saying that god is giving gifts to the church to preach the word of god and in preaching the word of god we're no more children but we grow up we begin to mature and in our maturing faith we're not easily swayed one direction or the other we're not just driven like chaff in the wind and that we kind of hold our position he says carried about with every wind of doctrine the preaching of the word is destabilize us in the truth that every wind of doctrine doesn't kind of blow us left of center and say well i believe this this day and i believe this that day and we kind of get moved around a little bit and then this is to me i think this is uh uh going to touch on where we're wanting to go in galatians and jude and colossians here in a moment even corinthians where it says by the slight of men with that the sleight of men just a little bit of deception a little bit of trickery and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive this is the reality of our our belief is that we're not living in an innocent world we're not even we're not surrounded by people who have strong convictions and are just merely holding to their convictions and and doing what they believe is right but there's actually a deception in people's hearts to where they're going to intentionally try to trick you there's deception in the land where people will take facts or they'll take statistics or they'll take principles and rules they'll take scriptures they'll take quotations and they'll take a lot of different things and they'll kind of use sleight of hand to trick you to make you think you're seeing something they'll use a cunning craftiness but they're doing it to deceive and that exists and so paul is saying that the word is preached in sincerity that we would become stabilized and come into the knowledge of the son of god and the unity of the faith that those kind of tricks and that kind of craftiness does not cause us to stumble in this verse but speaking the truth in love this is the responsibility of any god called man to speak the truth in love the speaking of the truth and love to the believer we grow up into him which is christ in all things which is the head even christ notice what's going to bring us into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of god it's the speaking of the truth so it has to be this dynamic of the word being preached energizing our faith causing it to grow stronger and stronger and this is going to inoculate us again stabilize us get our roots down to where we're not carried about by every wind of doctrine slight of men and cunning craftiness and this is why we have to really as brothers say supreme faith is knowing perfectly what you're doing we need to have this kind of this kind of supreme faith so we're not moved and then also having the wrong concept of faith if we kind of take it if we don't understand what it is it can make us susceptible to this deceit or the sleight of men of this cunning craftiness are susceptible to gullibility paul even talks about in in the in corinthians in second corinthians chapter 11 verses three and four he says but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ there is a simplicity in christ that the world would want to confuse and corrupt and defile and he expresses a fear which is very unique for the prophet to be fearing of the people but he says just as eve was beguiled through subtlety through trickery through deceit through slight he says i i fear that your minds also could be corrupted you'd fall for something and and this is how he amplifies it for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which you have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted you might well bear with them and if you the language that paul is using is he's saying you seem so gullible you're just accepting anything that someone comes along and says to you you just believe any story you believe any report you're just kind of believing things without really checking it with the word of god and examining the spirit of it he's saying that you might well bear with them in other words you seem to be gullible that you just believe anything anyone will tell you even if it's different than what you've been told before i said take the word that has been preached to you take that gospel that we have been sent take the gospel that has been preached and identify and recognize the spirit behind it and if anyone preaches something contrary to that gospel you ought not to receive it if something comes in another spirit contrary than the spirit that the message was given in then you shouldn't receive it john says in first john chapter 4 verse 1 beloved believe not every spirit otherwise don't be gullible believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world believe not every spirit but try the spirits test them give them a word test be discerning about them recognize whether or not these spirits are of god because there are false prophets that have gone out into the world they use slight they use cunning craftiness they're lying in wait to deceive so we want to be tuned in to those or to the voice that is speaking the truth and love that it stabilizes us it says believe not every spirit just as paul is saying to the corinthians man you guys seem pretty gullible you seem like if somebody came and told you a story you would just be willing to eat it up and accept it even if it was contrary to what i've already tried to share with you so he's saying don't be gullible the kind of faith that the the gentiles were being converted into he's recognizing there might be some level to where before you just kind of worship whatever was convenient you worship things would that would never speak back and you worship things that could never confirm themselves and now that you're being rooted and grounded in something very different a faith that was ascribed to the jews alone now that you're coming to this faith and you're coming to believe the word of god and even for a jew this great transition into the revealed word of god and the fulfillment of prophecy he said there's something very precious about that faith and don't become gullible don't be easily deceived galatians chapter 1 verses 6 to 9 he says i marvel that ye are so soon removed and this is certainly implying that they had in fact been removed i marvel that you are so soon removed for him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel and i like just how quickly he says which is not another knows there is not another gospel the gospel being the good news and the gospel being the good news of jesus christ he's saying there can't be another good news if it's not the good news it's fake news right he said there's only one good news there's only one gospel so he says they're trying to call you into another gospel but there can't be another gospel there can't be another christ there can't be another truth he says but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ not outright reject it but just pervert it just change it just be very subtle just the slight of men the cunning craftiness so he says there'd be some that would pervert the gospel of christ and this profound statement though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse it's a very very bold statement on paul's part to say that even if an angel from heaven preached something different than i preached to you then that angel should be cursed i'm glad it was written in our bible because i think there's still a lot of bible people that really couldn't even accept that because that's this is exactly what paul is saying i'm a messenger to you i've preached the truth is given to me from god even if an angel from heaven came down and preached something different then you could be falling for a lion as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that you have received let him be accursed paul is drawing from a literal experience where the word of god had been preached to the galatians the word of god preached the galatians excites the faith inside of them and there's something to be established in their hearts he says you began you began in faith and you started in faith as he even tells them in this letter uh and having begun in the faith and having begun in the spirit now do you think you're made perfect by the flesh so the word preached to them excited a real genuine faith and this faith is anchoring in their hearts and it and it's it says that it's a gospel that they received if they truly received it it would not been by intellect but something in their heart but now forces come and start dealing with them in the mind and according to human rationalizing and things in their spirits and he said you're being removed from the the dynamics of the word preached exciting your faith into fables and stories and he says this in this other gospel that troubles you and perverts the gospel of jesus christ and this is happening in our new testament this is happening in the churches it's just being uh the foundation is being laid and it's it's being birthed in the book of jude verses three and four he says beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation now think of that as he expresses that the common salvation this is something that would be unique to the elect this is something that would be very precious to the elect as he says in verse 20 but ye beloved built building yourselves on your most holy faith so this is the the common salvation the faith of god's elect he says i wrote i gave all diligence to write unto you about the common salvation he says it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith there it is again the faith the one truth the one absolute the faith which was once delivered unto the saints something given something received it says for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ so if notice these these principles there is the faith that he's saying you ought to contend for and this contending for this standing for this holding to it being built up in the most holy faith is even more necessary because there's certain men who creep in he says who are ordained to condemnation but they come in and they're trying to turn grace into lasciviousness they may even be preaching jesus christ but changing the gospel they're denying jesus christ trying to draw them back into jewish traditions trying to draw them back into humanism so he's saying listen you you that have received the truth and know the truth you have to remain steadfast in the faith and your faith has to be centered on the word of god because there's situations and circumstances and things that can begin to enter into the picture and it's all for the purpose of distracting you and drawing you away from the faith he's saying these things are very very subtle but they're very powerful and he wants to put them in these terms that doesn't kind of just pat him on the back and say well they believe the truth but not all the truth but he's saying they deny the only lord god and they deny our lord jesus christ colossians chapter 2 verses 6 to 8 he says as you have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him this is the maturity of our faith this is going from faith to supreme faith this is faith being perfected this is the outworking of that gene seed that is quickened to life by the new birth is you have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him this is progress this is forward moving rooted and built up in him so rooted in him built up in him established in the faith so there's an establishment in the faith the faith that you've received it becomes established it's made firm as you have been taught there's the dynamic again the word is taught the word is received it is established it grows you receive christ jesus you walk in him you're rooted and built up in him you're established in the faith you've been taught the word of god you're becoming established in the faith abounding therein with thanksgiving and again here comes this warning we've read it in corinthians and in first john and galatians and jude and peter deals with it and we find it re all through the the new testament here comes a warning again beware lest any men spoil you through philosophy in vain deceit so these are the elements of of of spoiling philosophy vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world someone would then they're not going to present and say hey take this it's going to spoil you or take this it's going to spoil your faith take this it's going to spoil your experience but yet it they present it as something that's edifying and something beneficial and something that's going to strengthen you i said beware because there's people trying to spoil your faith through philosophy vain deceit tradition of men and rudiments of the world and not after christ now it would seem obvious to us that if it's going to spoil us then it wouldn't be after christ but it's something that comes in the guise of christianity it's something that comes kind of with the voice oh that seems right that's it sounds like the shepherd but the sheep know the shepherd's voice and another they'll not follow because they're in the word to know the word and if something seems close but it's not quite the word they say you're promising a lot by that but i know that the in the end that's going to spoil my faith and maybe it doesn't become rotten to the core where you're just going to walk away from truth and walk away from the message but it it takes your focus on something else philosophy vain deceit tradition of men rudiments of the world our faith becomes spoiled off-centered focused on these other things and not on christ so do you recognize a pattern i i feel like i'm all alone up here for some reason i don't know what it is like there's the camera i'm just gonna preach this car this choir mic here congregational mic can preach to the camera and uh if if you want to say amen i've got my phone here for the clock and maybe i'll get the text messages as you say amen i have it on do not disturb i wouldn't get them anyway and i guess i just feel like there's a lot of distance between us today i apologize for maybe being a little uncomfortable if it's shown in my preaching i double apologize so as paul is saying don't let your faith be spoiled this is this is this is an admonition to the people don't mix your faith with something else keep your faith pure don't mix the gospel so if we have if we have a faith and i i wish there was some way if i was an artist maybe i try to draw it up and use some sort of expressions that had i known we'd have an overhead tonight today i'm not going to preach into the night but if i knew it i had an overhead i would have i would have given you the scriptures and maybe i could have used a graphic to express this we have the gospel which is true and pure whether you believe it or not it's the truth right god is god even if you deny him you can be an agnostic it doesn't change the character of god you can be an atheist doesn't change the character of god you can deny him he's still real and and that reality is going to impose itself on you one day now how much you want to deny it and so there's a there is a god that we believe in and then this gospel is representative of christ and this is the gospel the good news of jesus christ so then we have a faith a god-given faith and he's created in us the ability to believe that gospel that gospel ought to remain pure because if our faith is projected towards it and we're believing in the gospel i'm sharing this as i've read through these scriptures this is what starts this picture that starts building in my heart i've got a faith that's to that gospel because that gospels created this faith i was taught i received i heard faith has been excited now i have this faith that's kind of being reciprocated back towards the gospel now is that faith is being projected towards that gospel i don't want to mix anything in that gospel because now i've got this absolute trust and assurance on this word and i'm believing in this word but then all of a sudden philosophy starts entering into it and the rudiments of the world start entering into it vanity starts in trinidad pretense politics personality all these other things start entering into the picture but then i'm trying to keep this faith absolutely centered on the gospel while you just have to believe it and you just have to accept it and it doesn't matter if it doesn't do this and it doesn't matter if it doesn't do that and part of you saying well i don't know the gospel seemed to have said this but now this person's saying that i can't make sense of it it's as these things kind of get convoluted and mixed into the gospel that our faith gets spoiled and so we have to be careful that we don't mix the gospel with other things so that our faith is mixing with the wrong thing because remember our advocacy is for christ our voice is for christ it's not for politics for politicians it's not for personalities it's not for ourselves where it's you know my the pretense of how i look and what others think about me as a born-again believer as the final voice to the final age i have a duty to advocate for christ and as being an advocate for christ i examine my life i look at the things i support i look at the things i say and the things i do and i ask myself is the way i'm living making me the best advocate for what i believe to be the only escape from tribulation does my life is it representative of one who's convinced that i believe in the only way to escape the second death to be certain of that escape to bypass tribulation in hell so that we have to be sure there's not humanism that's mixed in to our faith as paul wrote in hebrews chapter four verse two for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them now why why did the word preach word and its purity not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that hurt it there's got to be this mixture of faith and truth this is where we get the prophet this is where we get the benefit from it and so if our if the word is preached our faith must be mixed with the word that brings prophet but our faith mixed with some myth truth isn't going to bring you profit and the word preached unmixed with faith is not going to bring you benefit think about these principles as jesus said in mark chapter 7 verse 14 making the word of god this is what they did they made the word of god of none effect through your tradition which you have delivered and many such light things do ye the word of god is pure amen the word of god is powerful the word of god is perfect it is it is righteous and true and whole and in it is is life and vitality but yet you can make it of none effect you can build traditions you can build ideologies you can build manmade ideas uh and and join it and mix it with the truth and it makes it of none effect beware lest any man spoil your faith through philosophy vain deceit tradition of men or rudiments of the world and that's what happened the word of god was ineffective and did not profit them because they'd mix their traditions with it now if you look at second timothy chapter 3 i'd like to begin with verse 5 instead of reading all of the verses it says that these who are of this sort the first four verses of this it says have been a form of godliness but denying the power thereof brother brown called the power of revelation they deny the power of revelation the power of transformation so they have a form of garnish there may seem to be a semblance or some form and it having a form maybe initially what the image that strikes your eye is oh that seems godly but yet inside they lack the power of revelation and this is this is where this hits home he says from such turn away so i need to know what to turn away from something that may appear to be godly appear to have a form of godliness but yet if it denies the power of revelation if it denies the power of transformation i've got to turn away from it then again this follows in line with those that preach another jesus and try every spirit in the slight of men and and beware thus they spoil you and those that would pervert the gospel and men that have crept in unawares he says for this order they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women so it calls them silly women they're not understanding they're gullible and they capitalize on their guilt because he says they're laden with sins so it may be really easy for us to just get together at lunch today and talk about how foolish those silly women were and they ought to have known better and can you believe it they get misled and they're misguided notice what these men capitalize on their sincerity they're laden with sins they desire deliverance they desire to be made whole they they desire forgiveness they desire sanctification they desire the justification they desire the baptism of the holy ghost so ungodly men can pervert the gospel and use it to mislead people mislead churches women mislead sincere people who are laden with sins and in their guilt well i just want to know i'm that i actually have the holy ghost well you haven't quite proved yourself yet i just want to know that i'm forgiven well if you want to be forgiven you have to do this and they capitalize on their sincerity and their desire to be delivered from their sins through and they capitalize on it using deceit very heavy statement that he's drawing out here and they're led away with diverse lust and then this ever learning i believe this is certainly applicable maybe to the silly women as they're being led away being told that they're going to find relief told they're going to find deliverance told they're going to find forgiveness and they never obtain it but this is certainly true of those that deny the power of revelation he says ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth i mean have you really just pondered that statement they're learning all the time and so there's a process of educating where they're learning things they're learning things but yet paul can say they're learning but they're never knowing truth they're learning oh they're always learning but they're never coming to the knowledge of the truth it'd be if i go back to the statement that brother carlin shared with me in god we trust everyone else bring data you may be learning a lot of data but you don't know any more about the character nature of god ever learning but never coming to the knowledge of the truth now as janice and jammers withstood moses remember how they were stood up by impersonation so having a form of godliness but denied the power of revelation he's saying that these withstand moses they can do it by impersonation so do these also resist the truth ever learning but never able to come into the knowledge of the truth and not only are they not learning it they're resisting it men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith it's that phrase right there that it drew me to this passage this reprobate concerning the faith they are this is something they're lacking this is something they do not have and remember how paul in the second letter in chapter the first letter to timothy called it said that they holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience first timothy 3 9 giving the instructions to deacons he says holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience the mystery what is the mystery is something secret something hidden and so it's saying holding the mystery of the faith christ is the mystery of the faith that was the mystery of the judaic faith how did how did that how did the people of israel begin you say well it began with israel no it began with abraham right and he's the father of the faith and here's abraham it begins with him and he has promised a seed and who was that seed christ so that's the mystery of the faith of abraham it wasn't isaac it wasn't even jacob but it was christ and so christ is the mystery of the faith of abraham and this is the mystery of the jewish faith and now that's why you could say when you read in the new testament that there's a lot of expression of what was once hidden is now revealed what we didn't know before is now revealed this great plan of god is now revealed because they never knew it would be that way so christ is the mystery of that faith he was the truth that was once hidden that was hidden before but is now revealed and this is the part of about a mystery is the with the mystery there can be a mysterious element that still remains despite the revelation of it so it wasn't that the whole world in unison when christ came they all go oh why didn't we see it right it was rejected there's very few that followed him very few that were tethered to that truth and recognized it so there still is a mystery that remains despite the revelation so now i feel like i can uh press forward with that i want this to be the foundation and come back to a statement i made in the beginning as you see this they are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth represent concerning the faith the faith is not blind the faith of god's elect is not blind but the faith of god's elect is based upon god's revelation of himself to you individually it's not collective we don't gather as a church today and say well what can we agree to be our revelation today we want to be able to go out and tell everybody this afternoon what we agreed to be the revelation they go well i think it's this and i think it's that and everyone says i make a motion that it's this i second the motion and we do the we do the protocol we do it just right and every parliamentary procedure has been observed we now have everything on the table we all vote we come away say 56 percent is voted this is the revelation and you got to leave going man i really like the first proposal i'm one of the ones that voted in the you know the 44 but i guess we'll just accept the bodies the group's revelation that's not how it works our faith your faith is based upon the revelation of god to you personally god reveals himself to you personally therefore you are able to stand if every church disappeared this afternoon and you found out that every message pastor walked away from the truth and everyone who believed the message before you denies it and everyone who ever claimed to be a christian even from the mark driscolls to the john hagees to the copelands it doesn't matter who they are hey guess what we're wrong joshua harris was successful in deprogramming me and i'm no longer brainwashed and we all denied the existence of god if he's made himself known to you personally you'd be like well isn't that a shame because now when anybody asks what church i go to i can say i am the church right because if anybody walked away if he makes himself known to you personally and individually you say it doesn't matter if the whole world fails and everything else around me crumbles and falls apart i know what he showed me i know how he's revealed himself to me and i can never deny that any more than i could deny myself so our faith has a basis our faith has an anchor it has a typo something that it's joined to and then when paul says they're reprobate concerning the faith this is what made these this is what these men are reprobate of they don't have the mystery of the faith they can talk to talk they can ever learn but they never come into the knowledge of the truth because they've never entered into coming into the unity of the faith they've never been faithfully taught they never had the word excited in their heart they've never had a revelation of the mystery this is what these men are reprobate of of that anchor reprobate means unfit think about that reprobate concerning the faith unfit for the faith because they have no knowledge of the truth despite all their learning despite all their education despite the process that they've been entering into to try to lead silly women away they're never coming into the knowledge of the truth so they're unfit for the faith i think it's really uh it may be a striking way to phrase this that you're unfit for the faith if you're not coming to the knowledge of the truth you're unfit for the faith if god isn't disclosed has not disclosed himself to you and you know him let me use a familiar scripture for you hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 because we're looking at the faith as as opposed to blind trust and bad faith paul writes now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so things hoped for and things not seen now i want to say i'm going to substantiate this as i read on a couple statements of brother branham but i want you to ponder this when it says the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen those are things that are yet promised so it's not it's not just well i have faith that this is going to happen it said oh what it's like well i just thought this i just had this thing this thing strike me in my mind that when we let leave today we go to the parking lot all of us are going to have a 2022 model of the car we drove here today hey i got a faith to believe it and we kind of like whoa all right i really want to believe that with everything that's in me right who wouldn't want a 2022 tesla and we're thinking this is going to be great and this is what we have in our minds but it'd be like well that's not how this works faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen but these things hoped for not seen were yet promised or guaranteed by god so substance is the things put under it's the it's the foundation and when he uses the term the substance faith is the substance he's saying it's firm and to say it's the substance of things hoped for it it puts felt excuse me it puts faith in the realm to where it has actual existence that's what's so amazing is it's faith has actual existence it's a reality and i can't touch it i can't see it hear smell feel it and i can't even imagine it i can't even these things are so far beyond me but where there's faith it actually makes something that we hope for have actual existence it's the substance of something we're hoping for that god has promised or guaranteed to say that it's the evidence of things not seen it's a proof that which by a thing is proof so you have the evidence of something i remember one time when i was i was driving with brother tim pruitt we were going to eat all you could eat deep fried all everything's deep fried it was deep fried everything all you could eat deep fried frog legs and everything else i think it even deep fried the styrofoam cup you used for your coke and uh we were driving off and he slowed way down and he goes over these you know and he bumps over these tracks and he goes a train just went through here and they go really how do you know he goes it left its tracks right and i thought well that was a good one that was really good you could tell he's a dad of many years very good dad joke but that would be the proof or the evidence right tracks what's footprints or i can tell you've been here i've tell you done this my kids sometimes have this look on their face because they who was eating chips in the school room like how did he know well maybe it's the bag of lays and the chips everywhere right there would be evidence it'd be proof that by which something is proved or it's the conviction of their reality oh my goodness this is so beautiful faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of something i don't see but has been promised by god are guaranteed by god so my faith is the conviction of their reality something that god has promised something that god has said he would do so faith comprehends as fact what cannot be experienced or felt think about faith comprehends this fact something that cannot be experienced by physical senses i may not physically be able to sense it but faith can confirm its existence it comprehends it as fact it is this is another way of phrasing this i kind of borrowed from different translations and the meanings of the word faith is the substance faith is the confident assurance or the title deed that something hoped for or divinely guaranteed it's a part that i think that we ought not to miss and this is to me what kind of helps focus our faith we realize oh my faith is something very specific my faith is to the word it's not just this trust meter that kind of goes out there and it's like who am i going to put my faith in today my faith is to the word that's where it is so that even we say faith is the substance and faith is the evidence that things hoped for and not seen it's not those things hoped for not seen shouldn't be our own imagination shouldn't be what brother micah promised me to bring back when he went on his trip it shouldn't be on you to make me any promises that i know of i mean it shouldn't be in some way it should be what god has said he would do so therefore it's not just something hopeful but something divinely guaranteed so it's the confident assurance that something god's guaranteed is going to happen it is the certainty that we wait that we hope that it is the certainty that what we hope for is waiting for us even though we cannot see it up ahead that's what faith becomes i i may not see it up ahead but god promised it it'll be there so it's not a leap of faith people say leap of faith is you're just kind of jumping blind into something not knowing it's there a leap of faith in reality what faith is is the most confident thing you could do but yet we use it as kind of a phrase well i don't know where this is going i'm just making a leap of faith in reality that's like the best thing you could do is i'm making a leap of faith how can you do that well because it's right there i'm making this is a step of faith we even say i'm stepping out in faith and what do we do sometimes to say well i'm not sure how this is going to pan out and in some ways we're kind of watering down what real faith is faith knows that when you step where it's going to land because he made you a promise brother branham says for faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not not not seen and faith takes its final resting place on the word of god there's where it finds its resting place it's resting places on god's word so our faith is not without basis it rests on god's word a couple statements i want to read very quickly from anointed ones at the end time in the rapture he says faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is the revelation of the will of god he's taking these things and joining them together not not necessarily using them in the realm of faith revelation vision but you say faith is something that's revealed to you it's all-encompassing supreme faith that's coming to be faith is a revelation of the will of god in the rapture he says revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation without it be in faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you our faith is the product of god disclosing himself to you it's a product of god revealing himself to us so our faith i'm saying this over and over again because this kind of my my emphasis behind blind trust bad faith our faith is not blind but our faith is the process of promise and proof think about it even if we never knew anything about god and someone preaches to us that we can we can that we are sinners then the word preached awakens us to this idea that there's a righteous god and that i'm sinful and what happens you begin to feel guilt as the proof that god's word is true that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god so then you seek forgiveness of sins and you experience forgiveness because you experience some sort of release from it because you've asked god you've experienced this real god forgive me and we those of us here who've experienced salvation know exactly what i'm talking about not because somebody else talked about it because you've experienced it and you feel this genuine relief and so god made this promise and now i'm feeling forgiveness he said he'd forgive me and now i feel forgiven and then we're baptized in the name of jesus christ believing that there is a seal of god because he promised it and then we experience it and the whole thing has become the process of promise and proof promise and vindication promise and confirmation did i just turn my mic on all of a sudden that sounds great let's start all over the volume is on now just blew out all the dust that was in my mic faith our faith is the process of god promising something and then god proving it i say this to every single one of you here today hold god to his word he's made a promise that god you promised it prove it not because you're questioning him but because you believe him in romans chapter 10 i would like to read several verses it's verses 11 to 17. i'm very conscious of our time and so i should at least preach longer than it took me to drive here right so you're all wanting to know where i live what if i stayed in flagstaff last night romans chapter 10 verse 11 for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved it seems like in a lot of denominations their chapter ends there but it says how then shall they call on him and whom they have not believed now this is kind of working backwards but i want you to follow this salvation by calling on the lord he says but you can't call unless you believe and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard so you can't believe in christ unless you've heard him and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent quotes isaiah as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things so if we work work this way the word is preached god sends a preacher he preaches the word you hear the word you hear christ you believe on christ you ask you call upon him and there's your salvation this is the process you believe because you've heard you don't believe because you just snapped something out of the air well i was laying on my bed this morning and i came to believe and understand that there's going to be a giant rocket ship come along and rapture us all out of the earth right and that's where people come up with these ideas and they come with these these sensations and these feelings and these moves and it says but you've heard you believe because you've heard christ he says but they have not all obeyed the gospel for isaiah saith lord who hath believed our report so there's a believing the report the word is preached who have believed the word and then this phrase is uh the one that we identify with so clearly so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god there's hearing comes by the word of god being preached the word of god's not being preached there's no hearing it and so hearing comes when the word of god is preached so where the word of god is preached and that is brings the hearing and faith comes when you hear the word how much more of a reminder do we need to be in service hearing the word of god preach how much more of a reminder do we need of how precious it is that we have the voice of the prophet preserved in digital form reel-to-reel tape cassette cd what mp3 whatever it is you need it in that we can still hear the word preached people be able to go right back to what's on the in the message and say well someone told me that they that he said this you go right back and check and see if he said it because there's a lot of mythology sometimes that attaches itself to our faith and then we find out later oh he never said that that was a lyric in a song the person who wrote that that was that really i would i would have thought for sure brother branham said that no it was michael w smith i mean it's like oh silly me faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word this is part of the beautiful mystery of the gospel because he says who hath believed i report the beautiful mystery of the gospel is some kin some are able to believe the gospel but not all and it's the preaching of the gospel just reading through these verses it's the preaching of the gospel that brings faith and if we just look at it in our conversion just your conversion and this is narrowing it down because we could even look outside of conversion that many have heard it preach that god is a healer so now i'm leaving the conversion site and maybe just going to use this side you hear it preach that god by his stripes you're already healed you hear it preach that we shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover in the preaching of the word instigates a faith in someone to take god at his word and they are healed so that's the word preached that's identifying a promise of god and then god comes behind it and vindicates it and proves it and that's an example of god's word being confirmed and then what that ought to do is make your faith stronger what that doesn't do is create a little box or a little religion and and i want to use my words very carefully because in my mind i'm just kind of thinking maybe just a defined healing a divine healing paradigm well well we know one thing god is he's a divine healer and we'll just kind of huddle in here well this is this is what i know because i was healed that right there the fact that god would heal you ought to cause you to push down other walls and say what else has he said what other promises has he made if he could come do that what else can he do and the greatest miracle of all being salvation of the soul those of you who can testify to this and witness that god made a promise to you the word of god is preached and you receive faith faith came by hearing the word of god and we receive the undeniable experience of the new birth which is to be baptized with the holy ghost that is the seal of god that is the confirmation of your faith so even think about this when paul says he gives us an earnest he gives us a guarantee it gives us a down payment we have faith which is most precious and then god says i want to confirm that faith with the baptism of the holy ghost that's what our faith is based on what is the new birth it's the revelation of jesus christ personally to you that is something that is confirmed our faith is not a myth we're not just grasping it's just not this nebulous thing i can't quite put my finger on it no i mean there's there's a basis for this the believer to the believer our faith is something very concrete substance faith brother branham says in the sermon expectancy faith is not mythical something mentally worked up it's an absolutely fundamental result that happens in a person's heart when faith is appropriated in one place he said god created in simon the faith so there's it's faith that's created fundamental result that happens in a person's heart when faith is appropriated then it is something in the person's heart listen but it can't be based on well go touch a tree and you'll get well right or pray to the post it's got to have a foundation he says now here it is i want you to get it how much more foundation could you place your faith on any level than the word of god faith has to have a foundation if we have faith if this message is turned your hearts and you have a faith the restored faith the faith of the apostles that faith should only rest in the word of god and that word of god ought to remain pure not mixing our faith with something else not mixing the gospel with something else but recognizing that pure dynamic and then keeping it pure so that if there's other instances in life where you're having to you're having to navigate life and you're having to make decisions you have to recognize what's true and what should i believe that you keep this pure and if anything you go back to this for guidance on everything else well i don't know what to believe anymore and where you can't quite put your finger on it there said well i know one thing sure the word is i remember one year i think was at winning youth retreat there's a big debate or argument over global warming and one of the brothers just wanted to settle it he got up that night and said the earth shall melt right with fervent haze like settles it there's going to be global warming whether however you want to deny it or accept it or how you want to politicize it it's like that settles it for a believer okay yeah i accept that let those who are tasked with the responsibility for policy debate the merits of climate change but let me just stick with what i know i can trust and believe something to place your faith it means a basis or a foundation what how much more foundation could you place your faith this is substance faith this is supreme faith it's solid we're a place where you're going to place your faith that has a foundation this is my uh i want to read a statement this is what i want to use to kind of turn the corner to close brother bram says in faith now up to this point i've been saying our faith has a reason right so brother braham says in faith there is no reason got you got your preacher he says you've got it from god and you know it's there so then it does have a reason right in faith there's no reason you've got it from god you know it's there he says another place faith has no reason what it's referring to he's saying you've got it from god you know it's there faith has no reason it's not in the head faith has no reason it has no basis in human thinking has no basis to inform judgments by the process of logic if you saw an axe head float you wouldn't believe that it floated through the basis and process of human logic you'd have to just say that's supernatural if a man is walking on water you would not believe that he walked on water by forming judges through the process of logic because that would have no basis in human thinking you'd have to accept something like that on faith so faith has no reason it means it has no basis in human thinking or it's not formed through the process of logic but that does not mean that faith is without reason which means a cause an explanation or a justification our faith has no reason and that's not the product of my human thinking but my faith has i got it from god and i know it's there so it has a cause it has an explanation it has a justification the explanation is not well this happened and that happened and made they just tied it all up in apologetics way but god gave it to me it has a justification because it's tied to the word of god so think about that on one hand faith has no reason as it's connected to a human process but our faith has a reason it's connected with a divine process and peter says it this way first peter chapter 3 verse 15 but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer literally give a reason sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer well how do you know it's give a reason to every man that asketh you a reason they're going to ask you for a reason and your answer is the reason we have to have a reason to give every when we are asked of the reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear so the answers with meekness and with fear but it's a reason our faith has a reason the reason for our faith is it's the it's been the word revealed to us now i'm not i'm not putting forth that that is reasonable to carnal the carnal human being i'm not saying that oh now that we've crafted it this way and we've said well faith has no reason faith has no reason and everybody kind of just looks at us as as sheeple who are running running after something false or fake or weak-minded and we're brain washed and religion is for the weak-minded and or that you know we're this is blind trust and and trying to come up with a definition that god says oh no no no we don't have we don't have blind trust uh this is what we believe and then everyone's gonna go oh okay acceptable we'll make this one of the branches of the sciences and we'll give out degrees in this at our public university a degree in faith so it's i'm not suggesting that the world is going to accept it but for the individual it's enough that what i know in my heart to be true my faith has a reason ponder this statement true revelation is god interpreting his own word by vindicating what is promised god makes a promise he vindicates it and that's your true revelation anywhere god's made a promise and he vindicates it that's a true revelation to you i want to close with ephesians chapter 1 verses 17 and 18 he says about it speaks about your eyes of understanding being enlightened the world claims knowledge and i it didn't really um this is just something i had been pawning really thinking about and hadn't really gone into much depth to outline something for you but i think we can all agree that the world claims knowledge or they will not uh they'll accept a knowledge claim based upon education or that we gain knowledge by education and education is the process of receiving systematic instruction so through some sort of orderly instruction you receive instruction that's educating the mind you receive an education and this would be the primary way that one to have an education this would be the primary way that one would learn and gain knowledge and i think that that method or system has been validated worldwide but education is also considered an enlightening experience so where you experience something and it enlightens you and i've been educated to something this this happened and so there could be a process of where something comes to mind and you're learning you're studying all sudden something comes to mind and say oh i think this is the solution and i have a solution to the problem i have this i want to try this and you can test it and say well this is this is how i came to know this truth and this is how science claims progress well we had this idea and we hypothesized about it then we tested it it's been proven to be a fact and so that's how they come with truth that's how they come up with knowledge is they suppose something through this thought process and they're kind of scatter shooting spitballing well i wonder if and once it's tested they say well this is how we arrived at knowledge this is how inventions are made or discoveries are made and they're all instigated by this enlightenment this thought process and then established by testing so this is this is the realm that the world works within they work within the realm of education and that's the basis upon which you can make a knowledge claim you ever heard of the phrase eureka moment oh there's a eureka moment it's kind of kind of like a cry of joy or excitement satisfaction when you find something or you discover something eureka like wow i mean that's a phrase that was used and initially it's attributed to archimedes who said eureka which means i found it and what he what he said it in response to was he'd come up with the process to discover whether or not the goldsmiths were making the crown for the king of syracuse out of pure gold and you want to know well how do we know how do we know whether or not they haven't mixed something else in it how do we know that all this gold we provided the goldsmith isn't being mixed with all these other elements and the crown that we put on the king's head though it looks like gold isn't real gold in archimedes he found a way to test something to know whether or not it was real gold and he said eureka and now this is what the world maybe would say that's happened thousands and dozens of times millions of times to individuals whenever all of a sudden oh i figured it out i found the answer the problem oh that makes sense even maybe sitting in class in a difficult something is being explained you're like i don't get it i don't get it also the teacher gives an example like i get it now it all makes sense that that's uh just a that's what the world experiences but the believer has something greater we we don't necessarily have a eureka moment but we have revelation and we have god's process of proof which vindicates revelation we have a promise that is made then god vindicates it and that becomes a true revelation and we have our eureka what is it it's amen and what does what does revelation do it's a it gives stimulation of satisfaction to the believer so the scientist is in his lab pouring over something trying to figure something out and he says eureka i found it but to the believer he's in the word of god he's hearing the word preach he's listening to the message of the hour and then something's quickened him and he says amen i found pure gold i found the real heart i found the real grain i found the real seed and the believer says i found it and the world makes great claims and discoveries of things that later they say well maybe it wasn't quite exactly a perfect process but our process is going to lead to pure gold and in ephesians chapter one we invite the musicians to come ephesians chapter 1 verses 17 to 18 that the lord god of the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom the spirit of revelation in the knowledge of him wisdom revelation knowledge wow the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints god has given you a process archimedes he's given you a process whereby you can know what these riches are and know what's not and nope that's not my inheritance i have a really dear friend who passes the church and he won't actually sing the song every promise in the book is mine won't do it so one time i sang it after i was done preaching because i knew it kind of bothered him a little bit because he's like no there's some promises in there that don't pertain to me and i go well i just kind of look at it as a promise it's a good thing the others are all threats and and he's saying the pro he won't sing it and so there's certain things that say well that's not mine no that doesn't pertain to me well the bible says this yeah but that pertains to that well brother ram said this but again that pertains to them but what pertains to me god's given you a process to know what are the what's the glory of the inheritance in the saints that you may know the hope of the calling of christ and this was the prayer he wants to he prays that god would give you the spirit of wisdom the spirit of revelation in the knowledge of him to come to know the knowledge of the truth the unity of the faith the eyes of our understanding being enlightened our eyes being opened up how could we ever say that faith is blind when we have eyes that are wide open when the bible characterizes us as having eyes to see and ears to hear and it's those that seem to have the best eyesight and the most knowledgeable the most intellectual are the ones of the blind leaders of the blind because we've had our eyes of understanding enlightened so that we can be ready to give an answer to give a reason for the hope that is in us maybe in some ways what i'm doing is taking a concept of faith or taking the faith i'm just trying to dust it off a little bit nothing new nothing different but just to remind us once again who we are we're believers because we believe the word we're christians because we have faith that's been excited in us by the revelation of jesus christ the eyes of our understanding being enlightened paul said in second corinthians 5 7 for we walk by faith not by sight but he never meant that faith is blind he's just saying that that faith that sense is greater than natural sight because by natural sight you can look up ahead and you not see what god told you was going to be there but faith tells you it's going to be there why because god said so just like the promise that could be given to us that there's going to be rain and maybe look on the horizon you don't see any clouds but you know it's coming and then one day you just see a cloud about the size of a hand on the horizon and you know it's on its way the faith we have is for we walk by faith not by sight this is not blind trust this is a deliberate confidence in the proven character of god let's have that kind of confidence a deliberate confidence in the proven character of god those of us who are here today we're not novices in this we've seen god prove his character time and time again and maybe we go through seasons in our lives where it's like well it used to be this way and it used to be energetic and it used to be feeling and it used to be powerful and it used this type that used to happen that used to happen that was god confirming his word god's never changed but he allows us sometimes to go through dry spaces where maybe our prayers just seem like they're not even getting through the pillow and he doesn't hear our cry and i haven't felt this in years or i i haven't had this quickening and he allows us to go through that so we can begin to search our hearts and say now wait a minute was i in it for the sensation wait a minute was i just in this because he could heal my body when i was sick what is this all about at the end of the day and you get down to me realize at the end of the day he wanted me to know him and i know i'm knowing a god in fashion with a god that's unseen to the eye i'm fellowship with a god that's unseen and unfelt to the senses therefore he gets us back to that sense the only synth that can truly bring joy satisfaction stimulation is that sense of faith to know that god is with me even if everything in the world declares otherwise i'm convinced of this absolute that's why we go through the paces we go through sometimes that's why prayers don't seem to be answered that's why things seem to be so far away that's why things sometimes don't work out the way that we wanted them to work out because god wants us to be sure that we're only mixing our faith with the word and it's not being spoiled by something else with our heads bowed today i remind you that your faith is a deliberate confidence and a god whose character you trust even if you don't always understand his ways because this faith had a genesis and as you've gone forward through the years he's proven himself time and time again that increases our faith you can take god at his word today and trust him you might have a particular need in your heart you might have a need in your mind your spirit you may have a need in your body but if you just want to make a stand for faith say i'm standing for this principle that i believe your word and i invite you to stand today just don't know just your own show of faith in your heart lord i i have a confidence in your truth the confidence in your word with our heads bowed scripture comes to mind lord i believe help thou my unbelief you say lord just loose my faith unmix it lord you have you know the process of determining whether or not my character is pure gold lord i avail myself to the process so many hands are raised heads are bowed let's pray together our gracious heavenly father presence is so precious to us lord we are we're being honest with you today if there be anything in us that we've mixed with our faith or anything that we've taken our faith and attached to lord i i know that i in preaching because a minister comes across so certain and so sure and very adamant and it can be with the heaviness and with the hardness because the force and the authority of the word but lord i would not want anyone to be condemned if there's this sense that they've taken faith which was should only be to the gospel and begin to add things to the gospel and they've made the gospel this and they've made the gospel that they've made the gospel something that it wasn't lord may there be no condemnation but rather conviction and with conviction lord may there just be a reconciliation of their faith that they would just come back to the truth we could admit i really got sidetracked by that idea i got really sidetracked by that opinion i got sidetracked by this need in my life and i got consumed with it and i started to think this is the only thing that it was about but i pray that whatever the circumstance may be as i stand before believers whose faith spans over over a half a century lord who are not novices and who are soldiers and veterans of this faith may they realize just what an important part they play in this final voice just as a there's trees lorded in certain national parks or i've thought i think of the trees at gettysburg they call them witness trees because they were there to witness the battle if the trees could talk they could describe just how much things have changed and this is different and yeah they really weren't lined up there and there really weren't no trees here and that road didn't exist and it really looks a lot different today than what it really was but they we are witnesses of truth lord as we sit here today in 2021 this world is so different than the world that this message was delivered in but the message is still the same and your truth is still the same and you're still the same god that is more than more than happy more than anxious to confirm your word to your children so i pray today [Music] it to build our faith confirm your word lord we believe it we accept it we receive it father may this process of confirmation and vindication continue that we might have supreme faith so give us a revelation to know perfectly what we're doing give us a revelation to have a perfect understanding a complete understanding lord we commit the people to you today prayed for healing deliverance strength in the name of lord jesus christ we pray amen
