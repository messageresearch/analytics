TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as we mentioned this want to start a new series on the house of the Lord I'm still learning how to minister and how to preach and so I'm constantly just wanting to yield myself to the Lord just to find the right way to approach a subject I find that when I begin to look at one I've been studying this now for quite some time I just there's just so much in the word of God in really any aspect of the word because you can always bring it back to Jesus Christ and it just starts spreading out and getting very very large and so sometimes you look at it and you go oh we can start here and just you keep doing this and drilling down this way and drilling down that way and I feel in some ways you just look at one aspect and you can never actually get to where it is you thought you were going and what that inspiration is and so I'm just confessing that at the outset that if I don't get anywhere I'm very self-aware and just believe that there's always something in the word of God for us to take a hold of and to be benefited by and I really only desire to preach the things that'll glorify God and edify his bride and so be in prayer with us on this subject uh of the House of the the Lord and I want to give a title tonight one thing desired I'm taking it right out of the the word here in Psalm 27 one thing desired I'm going to use tonight as an opportunity just to kind of get my materials out but give some context to what I'm looking at in terms of the house of the Lord and something that God began to deal with me on over the last month or so in terms of value I've actually been asking myself uh what is it that God values and are there certain things in the word of God that we could uh look at and conclude that based upon his attitude and based upon what he's expressed in the message of the hour expressed in the word that we could take away from that this is something God values and if God values it that should signal something to us and so those are some of the things I've been thinking about that I think will hold kind of uh you you can see where I'm coming from as we go forward now if you'll just look at verse four I want to start here Psalms 27:4 and there's just real large context to this verse verse as we've already read before this and a little bit after I love this text as being prophecy about the Rapture his brother bam takes it when he preaches the Rapture message when he takes that he says I'm not going to go down Main Street and take kind of the obvious angle to this I'm going to approach it a little bit differently and so I believe that him taking this kind of places this as a prophecy of the time that we're living in when the Lord himself has descended with a shout the living bread of life bringing forth the bride there's a lot of things there uh that are very very uh important to us but I want to focus tonight uh and and this is where I'm kind of with the was kind of giving you the qualification at the beginning I could get lost in a lot of these other details so tonight I'm actually just going to try to zero in on one thing out of this and here he says it in Psalms 274 one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple now that phrasing this is that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life and with that he paints this picture to behold the beauty of the Lord I Hope to come back to that at the very end maybe and to inquire in his Temple so much to this as we've already mentioned that we could bring out and that we could begin to explore but as I zero in on this one aspect he says one thing have I desired so we can say it this way he desired one thing I think uh just follow me tonight stay very close to my words I I I hope this has some tremendous impact and we can uh kind of wrestle with it a little bit as families and just individuals as a way of really challenging ourselves in the faith to stay for going forward with God so he says one thing have I desired so he had one main object that was his constant wish this was something that he just was the ruling desire of his heart so it's quite a statement to say I only want one thing and I know it could be said of a number of different ways where say say well this is the only thing I want that's the only thing I want but really it's kind of like when you ask people what do they want for Christmas I only want one thing and then this one thing and then this one thing and this one thing they say I only wanted one thing but one of each right and so there's this there's this expression that there's only one desire that rules me there's only one main objective and and constant wish and constant prayer and as I meditated on this I found for him to say one thing have I desired it implies some exclusion to say I desire one thing you have to say well that's the one thing he desired and if he says he only desires one thing then he's excluded a lot of other desires could you think about that for a moment he says there's one thing I long after one thing I desire more than being in in the palace more than being in his own home more than wealth or fame or power this one thing I desire it wasn't well I desire to have this car I desire to have this opportunity I desire to have the throne I desire to have a palace I desire to have a wife he said above all there's one thing so when he says there's one thing he desired it was excluding other things that could be desired and you could then conclude that if he desired this one thing that it would it would hurt him more to lose that one thing than it would to be to lose his throne than it would be to lose his family or to lose his health or to lose his riches or to lose his power so Desiring this one thing it would hurt more to lose that than it would to lose anything else are you thinking about this with me when he says one thing have I desired there's one thing desired so the climax of all of his prayers and uh that which he requested above all other things this this is the one thing he desired and so he says one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after so he sought one thing you can think of it this way together he desired one thing he sought that one thing to say that he sought the one thing was the primary objective of his life it was that governing pursuit or this is my one aim this is my singular aim if anything else would keep me from achieving that I have to disregard it if anything else would deter me and would not be expedient for me obtaining that then I must disregard it and so for him to say and I hope this can really resonate with you for him to say I desire one thing and seek after one thing he's actually acknowledging the pretense we engage in sometimes when we say oh I put the Lord first and oh above everything else I love God and I I I love his word above all things when he says I desire one thing and that will I seek after he's acknowledging the vanity of lip service it's easy to say it and maybe it would have been very easy for him to say there's just one thing I desired and we just say y oh with all my heart I want to serve the Lord but I'm not really going to try so he's he he he's acknowledging something and I want to say it this way if the heart truly desires one thing then the one thing will be sought after we can say that we desire it but if we don't seek after it I mean really how bad do you want it what do you mean when you say you desired it does it does it even mean anything if the heart truly desires one thing then the one thing will be what we seek after he says one thing have I desired of the Lord in other words he desired one thing one thing desired one thing sought am it was a priority the one thing more important than anything else and I was thinking of this as I was just thinking about the language and the word one thing have I desire that will I seek after and I remember one time when I was in Minnesota ministering and I think it might have been the time that brother loyel was baptized and I was with a group of young people I was single at the time and there was um there was a a brother from Japan and his children were in the youth group there and uh someone said something about being hungry and then I can't remember if somebody said something and I asked him I said well how do you say really hungry in Japanese and he told me he was like e your emoji I was like what does that mean he goes number one hungry and I was like I love it like I'm number one hungry I'm not just hungry and I'm just I I eating is the third thing I can do it's like this is the first thing I need to do it's the first thing I want to do and and it kind of just placed in this thought and I just love the language of it and so when David says one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after say this is the number one thing this this to me is what I desire and it is an expression of hunger it's an expression of desire and want and longing this is how God began to kind of bring some things together just very beautifully in my mind just to give me the confidence to minister on this tonight but it was also an expression of what David valued he says one thing have I desired Lord that will I seek after it spoke of something he highly esteemed or something that was of great importance to him so it was not not just uh an opinion of I think this is good and I like that and this is that that has that has value to it but spoke of something that was very important to Dave and I even feel in saying it that way that it loses some of its meaning when he says one thing I've desired that's at the exclusion of everything else that I've desired this more than food I've desired this more than houses I've desired this more than power I've desired this more than money there's one thing I've desired there's one thing that I will seek after in other words this is an expression of what I value the most he said in Psalms 20 Psalm 26:8 Lord I have loved the habitation of thy house and the place where thine honor dwelleth I just love that phrase the place where thine honor dwell the place where the shakana glory rests and the place where his presence is pleased to manifest when he says that about the house I've loved the habitation of thy house in the the place where the shik glory is pleased to manifest itself the place where it finds rest this is an expression of value I love this place I love the habitation of thy house maybe if we spend more time on services in terms of talking about value there a lot of things that we use to measure value or what gives something worth and value but value is determined by the usefulness of something or the perceived usefulness of it and the capacity that it has to achieve good or to bring good we've value something it has importance it has worth and and if it has value and worth then you give it some place like in other words if if it's worth fighting for uh is it worth keeping is it worth striving for and when he says there's one thing I've desired it meant to him it was the most valuable thing and so in Matthew chap 6: 31-33 Jesus writes this therefore take no thought and it speaks of an anxiety or concern concerns so it says take no thought it's not that if you think about what you want to do for lunch you're like I'm such a sinner but it means that you shouldn't be anxious and nervous and worried therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith All Shall we be clothed now it's bringing into view uh some eating drinking clothing says for after all these things do the Gentiles seek and then I'll come back to that but then he makes this statement for your heavenly father father knoweth you have need of all these things so he wasn't trivializing what you're going to eat what you're going to wear what you're going to drink but he's saying your father knows not that you want those things but that you actually need those things and the heavenly father being mindful of them there's much larger context to it and how he clothes nature and he he feeds The Sparrows and things but here he's saying that you must that for the Gentiles after these things after all these things do the Gentiles seek I believe in Luke it says all other nations of the world they seek after these things but they engage it it kind of engages their intention they engage Supreme attention to these things it's what matters the most it's the chief good it's the only good what am I going to eat what am I going to drink what am I going to wear after these things it holds to the Gentiles to all the nations besides Israel so there's there's this idea of well this is for Israelites they had a God who made a promise that he would provide all these things to a gentile they have no such deity that they has made the promise nor could even fulfill the promise and so they have to look after themselves they they have to worry about what they're going to eat they have to worry about what they're going to wear they have to worry about what they're going to drink and so diligence to something as he says after these things do to the Gentiles seek diligence to something is a direct reflection of one's true desire towards it right that the Gentiles needed it and wanted it and valued it so they sought after it you catch that after these things do the G Gentiles seek and so their diligence to it spoke about in their hearts how much they thought about it how much they valued it their true desire towards those things was was met in their pursuit of them so Jesus comes to this in verse 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God this is something we used in the last service I believe but seek ye first the kingdom of God one thing have I desired of the Lord one thing desired that will I seek after Jesus says after all these things do the Gentiles seek but now I speak to you and say seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you you recognize kind of some Singularity and multiplicity seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you so there is there there is this narrowing down now I put it this way God hides himself in Simplicity now I really hope you can focus intently tonight really engage in exercise of I'm going to focus very very uh intently and I I'm going to I'm going to try to you know block out anything that would distract me and I even say to the children try to settle yourselves right now give your parents some distance because I just feel very directed to say this concentrate because there's so much Supernatural power that can be un loosed Unleased to you if God can attack certain things by the word in your life that's holding you back so I know this is I know this is of the Lord here God hides in Simplicity and so the ultimate Simplicity is when all of our desires are reduced to one that's true he's CU now he's saying man you got all these things you need to worry about what you're going to eat what you're going to drink and what you'll wear now that doesn't mean that well there's only one thing to eat only one thing to drink and only one thing to wear think of all the Paradox the Paradox of choice and all the things to choose from I mean now it's like you can find something think about this and I don't mean this to be a joke to my family but you think of any if anything was healthy it'd be water right but now you can't even drink water if it's been in a plastic bottle right it's G to Water's going to kill you now and so think of all the pressures and things that we have to hurdle over and worry about and all the things we got to finagle around and navigate through says take no thought as to what you'll eat drink and be clothed with but now let's reduce it to this seek ye first the kingdom of God that's the ultimate Simplicity when you one thing is desired and I think that our ultimate aspiration should be uh should should be focused on a singular objective just as David says one thing have I desired when one thing desired means that my ultimate Pursuit and what I'm seeking after is something of a singular objective so if I could encourage you with this that this could be some sort of metric that you can use and some guiding principle in your life as that life should be the process of determining True Value we shouldn't be expected to know things of value and things of import and what what something is worth on day one uh a brother Owen is celebrating a birthday today I don't see him but he's celebrating a birthday today and we might all think that certain uh baseball cards and collectibles oh it's worth this it's worth that and I think even brother Lucas you experienced this recently said man I got a treasure Trove of cards here I've got to be sitting on a gold mine and somebody who's experienc and estimating the value of something go like that's a lot of cards but I'll give you 50 bucks for them I said well how do you know you're you're nothing but a kid I said but through time you learn the process of determining True Value and I and I one time was trying to collect every baseball card of Julio Franco bring them if you got them I'll take them and and yet for me they might have some value to it but to anyone else is like that card's worth 5 cents at the most and they look closer and say oh it was cut wrong it's not worth anything right and so there's a way that through life as you experience things I hope you're really thinking about this as you experience things as you grow we ought to become better at determining True Value and and as as the word in forms us as we increase in Revelation and experience we ought to be learning that this doesn't matter but this does this shouldn't really affect me but this should and as we grow in the Lord and as we live life should be the process of determining True Value and then that ought to lead us to more Simplicity amen life should be the process of learning what's true learning what's of True Value and as I learn what is valuable I learn to simplify my life to where my desires can be reduced to one CU God hides in Simplicity I want you realize God hides himself in Simplicity then reveals himself in that Simplicity and this would be the ultimate Simplicity when my desires are reduced to the God who hides himself in it amen in Simplicity if you could turn to 2 Timothy chapter 2:22 this may be a directive only to brother Vincent as he cues up the slides but in our youth there are many things that receive our attention many things that catch our attention uh many things that we we we invest in and it it receives our time and our our our money and our thought and things that'll dominate our thoughts and sometimes maybe we could even think about the kinds of things that children think about or the things that teenagers are worried about the things that people in their early 20s and we might like to think well as a as an adult and as a grown man you know I don't think about that you don't worry about when you when you get to my age these are this is really when you see the full picture you've kind of narrowed down your desires and your wants and so there are certain things that pertain to Youth and in 2 Timothy 2:22 he says flee also youthful lust but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart now the statement in the phrasing youthful lust these lust speak of a passion or craving uh like an inflaming wine that is intoxicating which influences your judgment and behavior so these lost or like a wine that intoxicate you and when you're intoxicated it influ influences your perception it influences your judgment and therefore it determines your it influences your Jud uh decision-making process and your actions your behavior so he says flee youthful lust and it means desires of a particular age a particular time of life suggesting that there's a there's a certain expectation when you're of a certain age if I could even say immature not fully grown and fully mature that there are certain Temptations and distractions that would be characteristic of that age uh if you come to church and you see a 5-year-old uh reading a reading a Richard scary uh busy town book and if you see a kid just kind of turned around in his chair and staring at the back and picking his nose you say well that's a 5-year-old right but if the deacons were doing that right if you go to the back and brother Mike's over there just in a where's Waldo right and he's just fullon you know looking and you'd be like well that's really that's really odd it it would kind of be mismatch because one would be expected of of a child but the other it wouldn't of it of any of us and right now somebody at home is like putting away there where wall where's Waldo gotcha but to say to flee and follow I want to put it's a challenge to mature right that these youthful lust desires that are indicative of immaturity and someone who's not fully grown and someone who hasn't lived life enough to know uh certain things and recognize certain things and to say to flee and to fall it's a challenge to mature and let me say this it's not physical de development but Spiritual Development it's about spiritual maturity it's not about achieving a particular age well when I turned 21 I I don't have youthful lust anymore no it's about growing in maturity spiritual maturity and so as we grow this is wanting to join with that force of how life is the process of determining True Value and then finding Simplicity as a result of it it leads to a narrowing down as we grow there should be a narrowing down of desire to one thing desired yes I'm speaking and not physical development but I'm speaking true spiritual maturity is the bride of Christ that as we grow in the word and we grow in Christ there should be a narrowing of desire to where I I have many desires there's many things I want but the more that I live in the word of God the more that I become acquainted with his presence the more that the word unfolds to me I find that it's not that I don't like those things or enjoy those things but I'm finding the more I live the more I'm growing up it's a narrowing of desire to one thing desired Paul says it this way in 1 Corinthians 13:11 when I was a child I spake of as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things adulthood is marked by becoming not aging says when I became a man doesn't mean when I turned a certain age so this adulthood this maturity is marked by becoming not aging and it's when I became a man I put away so wherever there there is this this enveloping or this tying together of manhood and childish things you're still yet in the process because as you become a man you're putting away if you ever stop putting away then you you've stunted in your development you're a Manchild at Best But when I became a man I put away childish things this growing up in maturity maturity is marked by becoming as I become more mature in the word I'm putting away childish things more and the sermon what hearest thou Elijah brother Bram says I believe that we've been children long enough God's going to turn his church into manhood now and we played in Frolic as children we just kind of were Guided by our whims frol we just kind of bented about wherever our taste drove us but now we're going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood maturity it's remarkable when you put it that way that here's why one who's in a childlike State and is characterized by Childish things but when he finds it in him to take that childish thing and put it away by the act of putting it away it declares that there has been a maturing and there's been a becoming am as long as you're still wearing childish things and behaving childishly a a and putting on The Heirs of a child hey doesn't matter how much you try to claim you're a man or how much you try to claim that you're a mature believer as long as there's notot a child things in your life you haven't come to the maturity you've claimed to come to because you take on manhood by putting away childish things maybe as a shout out to Arya but I've been using all these uh poets as of late I just find there's a lot of Beauty in these things that have been inspired I'll spare you maybe reading the whole thing but in the Ode to duty that Williams Wordsworth wrote and I'm thinking maybe he's not really one of the greats cuz he doesn't have a third name but William woodsworth was speaking about uh the the the servant the one who hears the voice of God it's quite a remarkable poem and he he he's talking about uh his desires and he says I feel the weight of chance desires I what a statement it continues with the my hopes no more must change their name I long for a rest Repose that ever is the same and as he says it this way my hopes no more must change their name I long for Repose which is a rest that ever is the same he's describing what he means is I feel the weight of chance desires desires that come up essentially by chance and the world is full of these enticements where they they're indulgences of opportunity the best way I could describe it is that uh Labyrinth that we have to navigate at stores that are just lined with all these cheap items to get to the register to buy your essential item of milk I don't know if they you remember the Fries electronics and there'd be a half a mile Labyrinth of all these cheap cables and cords and all these things and you've got the one thing you absolutely need right and you have to go through you have to go through all this why are they trying these are chance desires they're there just by chance it could instigate an impulse and this writer should we give him a middle name William Will Wordsworth wor his his desires he's saying I I feel the burden of it I feel the pressure I feel the influence of these chance desires and that's how children are there's things that they do because it's impulse they don't know how to control it the Mind wants the Mind does the heart desires it follows and it's these things it's chance desires that when the impulses there are act upon he says I don't want my hops to constantly change their name oh if something if this will just happen if this could happen all will be well oh if this could happen oh my hope is built on this my hope is built on that my hope is built on that oh that my hopes would stop changing their name that my hope could be built in nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness a long for repose that is that ever is the same these chance desires are described so well and so beautifully the childish things what I'm expressing in this is that this one thing desired is a mark of maturity that when David says one thing have I desired that will I seek after life should be the process of determining True Value and as we truly understand value it should cause a narrowing of things desired in 1 Peter chapter 2: 2 as newborn babes and I find this to be instructive because we're not completely like newborn babes in the sense that an infant a newborn is born and it's help listen and I think maybe we could take that type to an extreme there's a lot of beautiful things we could take out of it but now he saying as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby so there must be some acknowledgement that even though we may be infants in Christ there's an understanding that we could have of what's of value and what is nutritious and what will actually help me to grow so he says desire the sincere milk of the word and I can say that if you desire it you will seek after it one of the marks of a genuine experience is when someone has a hunger an Awakening hunger for the word of God it's past the pretense and the politics and all the popularity and all the religiosity that goes along with it when you really desire the word and you're just as happy to feed the on the message on a Tuesday morning as you are to run and dance and Shout on a Saturday night that's a real Mark of an experience when you can have and cultivate a desire for the word of God Amen and it's by that word that we grow that's right so there's a lack of maturity and there's a clinging on of childish things there's only one way that you can become a man and man enough to lay aside those things it's by the word amen so there must be as he acknowledg as newborn babes there's some sort of still chance desire there's still this newness and and this growing and this learning there's still time for me to grow and to learn to determine True Value but the proper aim despite these youthful compulsions within is the milk of the word brother brandham says in the sermon God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same many times teenage children and sometimes adults will get to you know young people will pass notes or cut up or something in church read R's Waldo books but is kind of acknowledging this is at the very outset of this sermon so it wasn't necessar his big climactic Revelation when he's preaching God hiding himself in Simplicity but just in this dedication of the the remodeling things he say you know sometimes teenage children adults even will do things in church he says now you're old enough to know better than that you should know better than that so our teenage children and our adults should know better than that he says if you expect to be a real man someday and raise a family to the kingdom of God then start it off started off in the beginning and act right and do right and it's expressing this a that even as teenagers and young people there ought to be some level of awareness to where there's a certain Behavior that's expected of me that's becoming of me and then if I don't act according to that I'm not progressing the right way you should be old enough if you want to be a man someday and raise a family then you've got to get it right in the beginning and you have to be Desiring the sincere milk of the word of God that you may grow thereby so that you're not a Manchild when you enter into marriage amen desire the sincere milk of the word this is a that you may grow my understanding grows my experience grows my ability to determine value grows in Philippians chapter 3: 7 and 8 Paul makes a declaration that is quite outstanding but what things were gained to me how did he gain it through life through education through experience he says those I counted loss for Christ the things of my youth and my uh my dedication and all the education and through my discipline I count it as lost for Christ y doubtless I count all things but lost for the exellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord I will then count everything else uh inferior and I that I would count them all for uh but loss that I might gain the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord one thing desired above all else for whom I've suffered the loss of all things and do count them all things things but dong that I may win Christ in other words I count all things but dong but I count Christ to be the most important thing now it's one thing desired among the many that were gained what has happened to Paul through his experience there were many things that were gained and now it's all been narrowed in his maturity one thing desired through his suffering through his experience through the revelation of Jesus Christ the many things that were gained the many things that he enjoyed he even goes to announce and express all these different things that were accul he says now I've been able to narrow it all down to one thing desired there's times we need to maybe resist the impulse to give our spiritual resume to impress people and just leave it and let it rest in the fact that you know you desire one thing and you're seeking after it Jesus says in Matthew 6: 19- 24 this is the Prelude to take no thought to what you shall eat drink and be clothed and Gentiles seek after it and because they seek after it it's indicative of what's really in their heart what they value so he says seek ye first the kingdom of God and this narrowing to one thing desired he says lay that up for yourselves I want to read verses 19 to 24 I provided this so you know you that take notes know that I'm going to be going on to verse 24 but we'll inject some things in here we'll take verse 19 and 20 and then insert some other readings here it says lay not up for yourself Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and still these Earthly Treasures to say this Earthly Treasures to say treasure it speaks of a storehouse so it's a storage of what one would consider good and precious things and to say the laying up of treasures upon Earth it's actually kind of this hoarding of things add to where that this I'm going to collect and and consume valuables and I want to gain them and and store them and then his use of language to express this moth and rust and thieves helps break down to give us an understanding of the things he's talking about so he says lay not up Treasures for yourself that moths can corrupt and he's speaking of clothing because moth corrupt the garments and the clothing that we wear and he says and rust doth corrupt he's not speaking of the type of rust that would corrupt Metals but rather the kind of uh rotting of vegetables and food it's the language that's used there and then thieves could break through and steal so he's been able to take the very things from Matthew 6:31 what shall we eat what we shall drink and how will be clothed and he takes that in the the the moth and the rust but now he says and thieves that would be the gold and the jewelry the things of metals and things of certain uh stone that we consider precious and we hide and time won't rot them time won't waste them away but thieves can steal it so what are they they're not only things that perish become unstable but they're things that are always changing or can be taken away these are things that are not constant these are things that are not sure it's this it's this transient nature of Desire lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth and he says that the moth will corrupt it the rust will corrupt it thieves will steal it right words these things that we pursue uh they change and when you really want uh really crave for a good garment this is one of those things I'm sorry honey I just feel like I need to share it I never realized just how many purses a woman needed until I got married I was like man this is a good purse we'll buy this for life right and I like you buy it for life right you have one wallet and you use it all the days of your life until the very end and it's in some ways it's a time time capsule of your life right you got every driver's license in it you got all the gift cards everything it's right there it's a beautiful time capsule you can tell everything you've eaten and done for the last 50 years in your one wall it but but a woman she she's got one purse for one season then after a while it's like you know what I don't like that purse anymore the leather's still good the strap still intact but it's just the nature of desire right there no sin nothing wrong with it at all I still buy bags and purses she know she maybe she likes bags I Like to Buy electronics and cables and Chargers you know and so there's certain things though that's transient right changing is what I mean and and it's expression of how that there's as you desire garments garments change they they they they tear moths will eat it food oh food it gets corrupted it gets H it rots it's destroyed thieves will come and take and steal value can be lost and brother brandham in the sermon handwriting on the wall says as the Gentile age was issued in under rotness and drinking and women and carousing the Gentile dispensation is going out in the same manner that's right we're going out to chaos from drinking drunken and I'm using this to be very precise about desire and the intoxication of chance desires and being under the intoxication of the impulse of consumption and the way that it works upon the Flesh and the things we value and we value what we eat we value what we drink and we value what we put on and we value the things we possess and we're if we're not careful we think that it's some marker of attainment and even God's blessing when we ought not to fool ourselves into thinking that because we can eat good things and buy good things and possess good things that God is blessing us let us be weighed by one thing what do I [Music] desire and I use this as just to showing the message of the hour we speaking to these things says our little teenage children out here in school this is the that lack of this immaturity they start them off with smoking cigarettes and they go from there to marijuana right you thought just a gateway drug or a Gateway thing was just a modern parament but brother BR saying this is where it starts right and now now where do we start we start maybe with the marijuana right we've been educated enough to know that cigarettes are bad and so now and I want you right it's the things that feed the flesh it's the thing that we put value on it's the very thing that we're pursuing I I maybe I'm not sure if this is where it'll fit I just feel kind of impressed Maybe to reach into the future now and bring this in there is a and I hope that God gives me the grace to be able to express this notice how he says you start out by smoking cigarettes and then it leads to something that would be even worse and I believe that he's he's he's showing it some sort of graduation or uh uh deterioration of desire to where there worse and worse and we start out with one thing I can control this but then it gets worse and worse we become more addicted now this this Paradigm works and this this pattern Works in other things by what you desire now someone who's smoking what would you say their desire is when they begin doing that they begin ingesting certain things and begin pursuing certain things and it begins to lead to the worst thing and so this is where I want to reach into the future if your desire is to be well in your body that's that's a good desire but when you make that your Pursuit believe it or not that could make your health worse because you should know better to seek the Healer not just your healing you should one thing desired not that I'm Healed but the Healer not not that I have a healthy body but that Christ is alive in me and you'll find the more that you pursue your healing the worse your sickness will get because you veered from the one thing the more you drill in the more you dig the worse your symptoms get the more aha moments you have is this is what I have this is what I have cuz I'm going to find this vitamin that'll work I'll find this that'll work I'll find this that'll work and the more you feed on that the more sick you get when I believe if God could help us to have one thing desired that's where our health will come from I back out of all my Pursuits I back out of all these programs and protocols and come back to one thing one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after and Lord lead me and guide me and whatever else may through my which my healing will come but may I not lose sight of one thing desired cuz it just gets worse there's a laying up of Earthly Treasures the hoarding of things that are valuable in the flesh but he does not end there of just castigating us for our Earthly Treasures he says but hoard and lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt where thieves do not break through nor steal it's the opposite of those things that are merely Earthly things are treasured of Earth they can be destroyed the those who have engaged in the investment things you find that no matter how valuable something may be that just in a matter of time perceptions can change right everybody who has a storage unit full of Beanie Babies right it's not even worth the money you're paying month to month for the storage unit all billion of them why because V things change and through the process of time these things that we think are so wonderful and so great you could have something believe it or not you could have something that's worth a billion dollars but you couldn't you couldn't get half that out of it maybe not even a tenth out of it why because the you're a market of one nobody else wants it yeah sure that's worth a billion dollars oh my goodness it's worth a billion dollars put it up on eBay you won't get one bid well as long as there's an Elon maybe you will but there's a there's there's a recognition these things are the opposite of things that are merely Earthly Jesus says it this way in Luke 12 verse 33 speaking of the same thing sell that you have and give arms now could I could I just take a survey are you following me to this point because now it escalates sell that you have and give arms provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that fath not where no Thief approacheth nor moth corruptive man just such beautiful poetry this is a challenging challenging Paradigm Shift of values this is saying that you sell what you have and give arms get get get some value and worth out of it get some currency out of it sell the things that are important to you and then take the money you've got from it and give it as a way of providing for others who have need of provide yourselves bags which wax not old if I could put it this way one thing you should desire and seek after it one thing desired and I'm going to put my actions where my desire is I'm going to put my where my words are I'm going to put my actions to it and this is what Jesus is speaking to in Luke 12: 13 to 21 and one of the company said unto him Master speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me Jesus's answer is pretty remarkable and he said to himman who made me a judge or divider over you who made me your judge who why who am I to div divy up your your property to you and he said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of things which he possesseth the things and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he thought with him himself saying what shall I do because I have no room where to bestow my fruits now when he says says bestow he doesn't mean give it away I my Harvest is so big I don't have enough square footage in my warehouse to store my Harvest so his response isn't fill up the Garners and give the rest away he says this will I do in verse 18 I will pull down my Barns and build greater and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods and I will say to my soul soul you know he's crazy now right when he's talking to himself Soul thou Hast much Goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be Mary and now God rebukes him in his grace he rebukes him and I know this is a parable he says but God said him thou fool this night thy Soul shall be required of thee Soul right then whose shall those things be which thou Hast provided you can even go back to look at how this one asked about dividing the inheritance with me he says it in answer to the argument over an inheritance even those things that you think might be distributed there can always be one that intervenes and the one oh I want this to all go to so and so and I've stored all this up so it can go to so and so it doesn't always work out that way even as of late I've helped try to help people navigate situations where they've left in their will I want all my money to go to brother so and so for the furtherance of the word of God and now brother so and so sister so- and so and you're thinking well I don't think I want my money to go to that I know I got everybody thinking now a little Hyperbole and exaggeration there but he says so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God this man's Paradigm was well I want to get get get get get until I don't have enough room and then make more room I'm even going to be wasteful I'm going to take a perfectly good barn and tear it down to build a bigger one so I can put more valuables and goods in it and say to myself myself self Soul you got enough for the rest of your life take ease but Jesus says sell what you have now this is what he comes to Luke 1233 sell what you have and give arms and know words give that which is beyond what you need for your own support be diligent enough to know what you need and as there be excess don't use the excess for self-c consumption but think of that you can use it to further one thing desired if what you desire is to to further your own enrichment and to further your kingdom and to do all these things for yourself then sure there's many things you might try to pursue but when you've been able to simplify your life when you're able to live long enough to understand True Value and you can simplify your life to the narrow down to one thing desired then it even gives perspective to the abundance of things that we have in the flesh Proverbs 19:17 says he that hath pity upon the the poor lendeth unto the Lord that's what he means when he says so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God it's just so beautiful what does it speak to what one thing desires what they seek after what they what they value is what you put your money in it shows what we think about it when we when we spend the money on it we seek after its uh its betterment we we're circling back to even some things we used at the very beginning of the year last year just a couple scriptures I thought it was just remarkable how the Lord Works to where I feel in my heart that it's not just me reverting back to things I've preached before but it's the Holy Spirit knowing the rhythm of our lives and Discerning the needs in our hearts and I thank God he's able to revisit them says in Hagi 3 and4 then came the word of the Lord by haggi the prophet saying is it time for you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses in this house lie waste and what's the what's the image that's brought up before them they lived in houses with Wes coating bead board and crown molding beautifully sealed houses ornamented adorned luxury am miniz all to the to the tea and beautiful permanent dwellings in the house of the Lord laid in waste he says is this what it's time for for you just to continue to accumulate wealth and get better and better and better and then the house the Lord laying waste is this the season is this what it's all about and it was a challenge to what they prioritized it was a challenge to what they Ved as a challenge to what they had been asked to do in the beginning that they ought to give care that they give so that the house of the Lord never lay in waste God gave a great program that they might have sealed houses he's not preaching against sealed houses it's not a sin to have sealed houses don't go home and rip out your beadboard and tear up your nice hardwood floors there's no sin in that but he's saying why give everything to that and then you're not rich to toward God the Bible says he that lendeth has pity upon the poor he that gives where the needs are is lending unto the Lord and that which he hath given will he pay him again in other words what you've given to the Lord and lended to the Lord the Lord pays back did you re did you hear what the scripture says when you have pity upon the poor when you recognize the needy when you're given to where the needs are and you're giving to it you're lending you're lending to the Lord and the Lord's not going to be indebted to anyone oh my goodness you talk about a program you talk about an investment you do what God's asked us to do we know the will of God for us this year you can't out give God when you give your lending to the Lord that's why he'll repay yes he'll give what you he'll pay you again what you've given he says let us give alms provide yourselves bags which wax not old now that could be a scriptural uh justification for buying purses just throw that out there I feel checked the word corrects the airor your bags are waxing old honey let me buy you a new one and so the bags which wax not old it speaks I even found that it meant more to me studying it this time than ever before that there's that it's money that's hoarded up in bags just as the man here has a great harvest and he's going to he has Barn like the barns he' thought through this before this will be enough so if he could fill it up he's taking taken care of keep doing what you're doing take the excess give give what you ought to give and give abundantly cuz you're lending to God God's going to pay you back don't live in fear don't hoard up and so the bags which watch not old it speaks of taking valuables and goods and you're just hoarding them and then you keep it for so long the bag begins to rot through and you're putting your money in bags that are so old that they're worn out that's what he says in Hagi again you've swn much and bring in little you eat but you have not enough why because your more worried about your own things and not the one thing that should be desired ye drink but you're not filled with drink you clothe you and there's none warm notice the Symmetry to the very things that Jesus says that this is what the Gentiles seek after the very things that your heavenly father knows that you have need of and it's the very things that the more we try to get it the less it really satisfies and the less it really produces its value and he that earnthenecklace to a bag with holes it meant more to me this time in Reading in conjunction with Luke 12 to realize not only is it speak of our wasteful spending but we're just keep putting it into something and we're never using it we're just saving it up for the we're saving it up we're saving it up we're saving it up and you're not even prudent in it you're not even you don't even know what it will bring you because it's just beginning to rot and now the very bag you put it in you've been shoving away money for so long and I'm just using that as an analogy of value that you're getting nothing out of it and you've forgotten the one thing desired Happy New Year to you the scripture I've been studying is here in verse 21 now Matthew chapter 6: 21 as he says lay up not uh Earthly Treasures that moth and rust corrupt and thieves can steal but lay up yourselves Treasures in Heaven a treasure in heaven that faileth not where no Thief approach neither moth corruptive for where your treasure is you are you still with me tonight where your treasure is there will your heart be also you know words your heart's going to follow those things that you value maybe it's what comes first I don't I don't I'm not sure which one comes first but it just speaks to the fact that if you value something you'll pursue it whatever you make your treasure gains possession of your heart are we listening whatever becomes your treasure be it becomes the owner and the possessor of your heart in other words it takes control this is why Jesus says in verse 24 as we skip to that no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he'll hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon the worldly things if you serve it it takes control of your heart if becomes your treasure it gains possession of your heart you cannot have both possess in your heart this is what leads John to say if you love the things of the world the love of the father is not in you doesn't necessarily even mean God's love is not in you but rather how can you profess for the Lord to be your treasure when he does not have possession of your heart Colossians 3 veres 1 and 2 if you then been R be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth I'll come back to where your treasure is there will your heart be also maybe we'll amplify that a little bit more at a later time but here Paul's putting in this way direct your heart to Christ seek for him strive for him be purposed in your heart make Christ your treasure desire the sincere milk of the word make a deliberate decision Christ I want to put you first one thing desired Above All Else the word one thing desired Above All Else Christ and it will be determined by what I seek after set your affections on things above set your aim on Christ above not on the things of this Earth do you recognize how it has been Singularity and multiplicity that there's this narrowing down when you look to Heaven it's not so much Heavenly things though we might think on these things these things speak of the one thing Christ whereas the Earthly things my not even a dichotomy but just the multiplicity of so many things this is I wanted to use these things in the sermon on step by step about our singular aim and brother bradam in the sermon thinking on our way is talking about a a bum he met I just called him a a floater he said he wasn't a drug user he wasn't a bad guy but he was a bum I think he said he wasn't a drinker drunk and he took him to lunch and brother brandham said where did you start this about 20 years ago where are you going nowhere where did you come from nowhere how long do you expect to keep this up oh I don't know he says no Ambitions no aim there there's no objective and I would say this is just as bad as having a bunch of them exactly this is just as bad as not having one thing and having many why the Christian ought to be the most ambitious person in the world we shouldn't lose our Ambitions one thing desired should not just make us vegetables and we have no ambition bring this glorious Gospel of eternal life to a dying and perishing world we should be up and at it if we truly desire one thing above all others then our actions will dictate it a brother was sharing with me that he that he wanted to be addicted to the word right we're fellowshipping on that an addict is known by his actions right hey hey you know they see a garage door open right and sneak in see that you find a weed eater weed whacker weed whipper whatever you call it you find find out where you're from by what you call it right I guess we don't have those here they're going to find a r a rock raker they're going to steal something right because they they're driven to do it there's something that gives this impulse and this unction you know them by their actions and this is what we should look at say am I ambitious for the things of God we should be up and at it the sermon as the eagle stirs her nest that's the way God builds his church for his eaglets high above the Ambitions of this world so when we are to be ambitious it's not that we have a lot of Ambitions he says she's got high ambition oh I love how he singularized it again oh there's Ambitions of the world but there's just one Heavenly ambition Let It Be Christ that's right why Christians ought to be the most ambitious person in the world I want to do this I want to do that I want to do that no no no no one thing desired high above the Ambitions of this world she's got high ambition not to please men but to please God she's built high and safe because her ambition is in Christ I'm trying to hurry here verse 22 for verse 21 for where your treasur is there will your heart be also now think of that in terms of this driving force whatever is your treasure gains possession of your heart now that may open up a lot of questions for you in terms of how do make something my treasure how do I make seek Heavenly treasures and those are good questions I would hope that maybe that's what my preaching does is it prompts you to ask questions and you you're so desirous of an answer you go to the word and you go to God to get it and we don't need to print a church manual so you're going say well you know let's see I almost grabbed the Bible and said well that's that'd be accurate but you're like well we've we've turned in the Arizona Believers Church manual it says right here that whenever you're h and you you just go to my blog right and I'll tell you everything you need to do in the new year to get it right I just want to provoke the questions righten these are a lot of things we need to take inventory in our lives and think about one thing desired I'm giving you enough scripture here for you to really start to chew on and realize there's some weight and emphasis in these things to challenge us about our values David said one thing I've desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord Lord all the days of my life yes amen Jesus continuing for your treasure is there will your heart be also says in verse 22 the light of the body is the eye I saw I I know I'm going long tonight the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light I'll come back to that but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in the be Darkness how great is that Darkness now there's a lot said here and what's amazing is he's talking about treasure he's talking about Pursuit he's talking about what one would value laying up Treasures in Heaven not Treasures upon Earth giving arms providing yourselves bags with which wax not old this is something uh that's all in this view when he says the light of the body is the eye and if your eye is evil the body is going to be full of darkness and if you think that your eye has light that's the worst darkness and an evil eye is an eye the scriptures being an eye that's chaotic or disordered it's an eye that's not set on the right the single right objective this is what's meant in this picture that he's he's painting where your treasure where your treasure is there will your heart be also and there's this dividing between God and Mammon God singular Mammon worldly things just a cacophony of desires chance desires all these things that would be just a a a Pandora's box of impulse but yet God Christ this evil eye is an eye that's not set on a single correct correct objective Proverbs 23: 5 and 6 wil thou set thine eyes upon that which is not now this is amazing when I was reading this this week well you set your eyes upon that which is not in other words you're going to set your gaze upon it your direction your aim for riches certainly make themselves Wings they fly away as an eagle toward heaven and we're like bless God riches are like eagles God Likens his children to Eagles and well okay it's not what he means but he's saying that these riches that you've got your eyes on they'll just fly away so why set your eyes on things that aren't they're not they're not guaranteed they're not permanent he says eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither desire thou his dainty Meats his dainty Meats it should be a cover band with the L fellas of A baser Sort there it hearkens back to verse five of how an evil eye setting your eye on that which is not one who has put all of his hope in The Riches of this Earth it's this chaotic evil eye and and we can only really understand it with the contrast of the eye if it's single a single eye is an eye that is simple and clear it's an eye that's not looking two ways right your eyesight is not divided it's simple it's singular it's to Christ let thine eyes look right on it says in Proverbs 4:25 to 27 let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee Ponder this is where I'm asking you the question Ponder the feet of thy path and let all thy ways be established turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from Evil yes I'm going to wrap this up this heavy thought tonight this challenging thought tonight that if thine eye if the light of the body the light of the body is the ey if there therefore thine eye be single if your aim be singular if your desires be narrowed down if it's evil it's divided if it's evil if I could put it this way you're just spread thin got so many irons in the fire you have so many things that are really important to you that when it comes time to dedicating attention when it comes time to being present when it comes time to uh clearing your schedule you're not able to do it because you look at oh but this is important and that's important and this is important and you've got nothing of greater value to weigh it against in order to help you start making the decisions to not be spread so thin and say at the end of the day there's one thing that's needful there's one thing at the end of the day that I've got to protect above everything else and it's the one thing desired are you following me tonight is it is it is it practical for you is it is it plain enough without the details that you can be very specific in your own life that there's a way that we get spread thin with so many irons in the fire trying to do so many things that we've left the one thing undone the one thing that is needful the one thing we say we desire yes but if I suit be singular I just love this the whole body shall be full of light your strength of character your Spiritual Development your spiritual maturity is dependent upon this singular simple Focus amen that when I can have one thing desired my body will be full of light my strength of character comes from this singular objective my strength of character is not in my multitasking and not all the things that I can do my strength of character in my maturity has not been in all the ways that I can appear to man but it is because I've been able to put away childish things and narrow my desire to one the greatest Simplicity that I can have in my life is to know that my heart is now single that it is now to Christ and to Christ alone because A Heart Divided Between Heaven and Earth is entirely dark and it's our desire remember this it's our desire that determines our character is it simple is it singular is it to Christ he says in Luke 11:36 If thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light there's the secret there's the secret to growing and matur uring there's the secret to being able to determine value is when I could begin to narrow my desires to One Singular purpose there's a lot of uh business parlaments we could use a lot of lingo we could use buzzwords and phrases but there's this governing principle that we can have in our lives where my life is about this one thing desired and I weigh everything else in light of that and there's a place for everything and everything in its place and it all has to fit with this in the first place and if moving one thing out of his place causes this to shift I've got something wrong somewhere if at any time things begin to level there's this phenomena we know that uh you're not to fly a state flag or any flag higher than the American flag so in most places you visit the the U the USA flag the uh Stars and Stripes is always higher and I think you find that in the state capital here the flag of Arizona as beautiful as it is flies lower than the flag of the United States of America but in Texas you can't fly it higher but bless God we're going to fly them at the same height why because of pride pride is what it is and they and well they won't fly it higher but they'll put it on the same level and some of you laugh but how many flags are flying just as high as his flag how many flags have you raid in our lives raised in our lives whether it be entertainment or sports or whatever it might be how many flags are flying just as high as his flag how many have we raised up listen if anything if it ever levels something's wrong if it ever begins to find the stasis where Christ seems to be on the same plane as everything else oh God help us and Shake Us in this time that we're living in now to say one thing desired that will I seek after God let let it be in my life that I can find there's a bright shining of a candle that doth give thee Light Brothers if you come to your instruments in 1st Chronicles chapter 29 just reading here in this closing 1 Chronicles chapter 9:3 29:3 let me just read it to you again in Psalms one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may D in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple we could preach a series on just each one of those phrases a series of many sermons but now I want to read this because it's David expressing his desire to Solomon and David put what we read here in Psalms 27:4 I'm reading you this to show that David was a man of his word in other words the reality of his life matched the words of his lips moreover because I have set my affection to the house of my God now as we get more into the series on the house of the Lord we'll find that it has meaning to us Beyond a temple in Jerusalem that do an Israelite the Tabernacle and the temple were physical structures that they had a physical Duty too but I ask you who's the house of God today what does it mean to you and have I set my affection to the dwelling place of his presence we got to be Thinking Beyond the church he says and he says I have of my own proper good of gold and silver which I have given to the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for the Holy House David's expression in Psalms 27:4 was not shallow it was real because he put his gold and his silver where his mouth was if I could put it that way I've set my affection on the house of God and because I have set my affection on the things of God because I have one thing I've desired I've put my thought my words my actions my income these things I've put it to it I've honored God even he said beyond what I've already prepared beyond what was necessary I took of my own Storehouse I I didn't go on big big build bigger barns to hard my wealth I found that I've got enough to sustain me let me give of my extra to the things of God oh I hope that it could just mean life to you in whatever way it can mean I I I I I I I if I could put it this way there's been a substitution I hope I don't get myself in trouble with this I may never have myself back to preach but there's been a substitution of real Christian Integrity for Republican values and we've subscribed to Republican values at the cost and expense of being real Christians but I've set my affection to the house of my God in other words if the Lord is truly your light and salvation do you remember what David said he led it he led it up to like the he painted a picture if the Lord is truly your light and salvation then this one thing will be desired then the Lord will truly the one thing that is needful it will be one thing desired the highest aim of your [Music] heart to behold the beauty of the Lord no one can see the true beauty of the Lord and have his heart captivated by anyone else it is only when we forgotten his Beauty that a heart begins to lean to those things that aren't him are you listening for just these I'm I'm closing I promise I'm closing you cannot see the beauty of the Lord and your heart be captured by anyone else you can't truly see it now this might seem a little far-fetched for some people who think about all the the the light show of leoda and all the things that it has to offer and then you think of our church and you're thinking well look at this okay this is our church and you compare our church to Dave and Busters or ShowBiz Pizza or Chuck-E-Cheese or something or Peter Piper whatever it is we do in Phoenix I don't know and you look at this you're like but this doesn't have anything for me like that the there's this idea of well I'm I'm I'm trying to see something here I'm trying to catch something here and it doesn't really St but let me just say this if you can ever see him in his Beauty I know it'll seem crazy to the rest of your body but your heart will be captivated by his Beauty if we can ever see this this is why I say it this way so it can become a longing of your heart Lord I want to see your beauty I want to see your beauty because if my heart can see more of your beauty then that's Mo less of my heart that can be captivated by the world let my whole heart be it was my thought and perfect love what's perfect love when my whole heart is his when my whole heart becomes his that's perfect love with my whole heart there's none left that can be captured by the world every door is open to him let it see his Beauty and if I could encourage you in this way be the beauty of the Lord yourself that others may see his Beauty and be captivated by him and let it be that which wins the hearts of the hardened wins the hearts of the Lost wins the hearts of our wayward ones and our families and those that we love that I might be a bright shining of a candle that gives light one thing desired one thing could you take inventory could you take inventory of your night life tonight just ask yourself how many things do I desire and let's grow up this year let's mature and grow by that one thing desired life is the process of simplification of learning things that learning to Value the real things and putting everything else in its place I would say that'll give us enough to do this year can we do it together can we help one another encourage one another in these things let's bow our heads in prayer you can stand with me tonight our gracious Heavenly Father
