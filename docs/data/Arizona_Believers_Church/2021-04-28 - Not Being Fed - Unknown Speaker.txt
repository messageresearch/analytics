TRANSCRIPT
========================================
isaiah chapter 55 verses 1 and 2 i sent such a tremendous presence that i want to just get straight into the word isaiah chapter 55 verses 1 and 2 ho everyone that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfyeth not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness as you can tell from the slide that's there my title tonight is not being fed and it's a question and i've used the emphasis of three question marks just to give that emphasis not being fed and ponder that that it would even be you would even express that in your heart or be in a situation where you're not being fed the question is are you not being fed god bless you you can have your seats as we pose that question not being fed we read from isaiah 55 and pick up um in amos chapter eight uh we had been looking at this last uh wednesday night as well even our communion service was on in this theme of hunger in eating and feasting and it says behold the days come saith the lord that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord and we know that brother branham takes this scripture and applies it to the time that we're living in such that we see that this is end-time prophecy being brought to pass and verse 12 even goes on to speak how that people go here and go there searching seeking trying to find the word of the lord trying to satisfy this hunger in a time of a famine and they'll not be able to find it but brother brahma says it's about that time that god raises up something so when there was a great famine in laodicea and the world had reached its climax in terms of darkness a complete blackout of the age as brother branham identified it even god himself identified it as a complete blackout and we know that christ was put out of the church there's your spiritual famine but in the midst of that famine god raises up something thank god there's a revelations 3 20. behold i stand at the door not giving us an opportunity to sup so that's those are the things that are in view as we minister on this and as we ponder this but he says i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord so this is a famine not for natural things not for abundance not for physical pleasure not for entertainment not for structure or government not bread not even a famine of miracles but a famine of hearing the word of the lord and a famine of hearing the word creates a weakness of faith without faith it is impossible to please god so we know that we must have faith to please him but without the hearing of the word we cannot have faith and if there's a famine for hearing the word and that creates a weakness of faith that impacts our spiritual health if our faith is not strong then our spiritual health is not going to be strong and and i feel very overwhelmed just to touch on this for a moment and i'm just not sure how much you might pull me in this direction but i feel directed just to make reference to this at the outset as i i've been pondering maybe a different thought for sunday let's not confuse and we want to always be kind of careful of this to not confuse the trying of our faith for a crisis of faith in other words we know that our faith is going to be tried that there's just no way that our faith is not going to be tested um proven or sought out and we know that the test is for our benefit uh we know in the world that when we're given a test uh in in school the teachers are testing us to find out where we are but when it comes to god he knows right where we are but the test is for us to know where we are and god many times has given you a test just so you can realize that you've got this he's wanting you to go through a test so you realize you have what it takes that he's given you everything that you have need of so there is a trying of our faith but then also there is a weakness or crisis of faith and we need to be very careful that we're not confusing what is a trine of your faith that means you have faith it's just being tried it's being perfected versus a time when maybe your faith is weak or it's a crisis of faith and you fail to feed on the word of god and put yourself in a position to benefit from the word because it's very easy to get discouraged when we're fighting and if you're fighting when faith is being tested the battle is the lord's but if you're fighting because of a weakness of faith or crisis of faith you just need to get in the right channel and get where god wants you to be and this is uh this is how i just feel to expound upon a little bit more conflict often is the result or we could just say this way conflict is a result of opposing forces meeting and engaging so if you sent some sort of fighting or some sort of struggle some sort of testing uh you're going through something that means opposing forces are engaging and and in meeting and this is what i want you to think about maybe just ponder for for some time going forward the word is often the aggressor now think about this you're fighting you're going through something all this is a fight this is a struggle this is this is really hot and heavy and we think of ourselves as kind of huddled in the corner and we're just being beat up and we're being bombarded because we sense that there's a fight but i want you to think about a little bit differently sometimes that fight is because the word is the aggressor that the fight is taking place not because the devil has launched a surprise attack but rather the devil has been exposed and he's been uncovered and that's why there's a fight you say well the devil's attacking me maybe the devil's fighting back think about it or the devil's attacking me i'm being bombarded i'm really going through it and we feel some sort we feel defenseless we feel vulnerable but what but i want you to think about a little bit different aspect that many times the word is the aggressor and the there's a battle and there's a fight that's taking place because of the advancement of the word and the word has exposed satan in one of his hideouts there was never a battle because he possessed that land there was never a conflict there was never a fight because he just settled down and got comfortable but now the word is advancing and the word pulls up on the devil and rips off his cover and says time's up buddy get out of here and starts driving him out and so he kind of gets defensive and he gets a he gets angry he gets riled up and the fight isn't because your faith is weak but because your faith is strong and getting stronger and advancing into areas that the devil thought he could just relax and chill out for a while and they're maxing like michael jackson and all of a sudden the word comes along and says hold up wait a minute ain't gonna happen and so i know that we give the credit some time to the devil he's bombarding me he's attacking me just working me out working me over no i want you to turn it completely around and say the word must really be giving the devil a hard time because he is angry angry with the capital g he is angry he is mad he's riled up and and that's not because you're weak and because the devil's after you but it's because the word is advancing and you think about when brother branham preached i think it's in the greatest battle ever thought he says how did grant take richmond just as he come to it so it's an advancement of the uh of the of the word of god it's an advancement of your faith the the battle that's raging in your mind the things that we go through as believers don't make it look like there's weakness and you're vulnerable and you and you're upsetting this and it's because you failed here and you felt there no you could just believe that this is the advancement of the word that's driving the devil out and so if you hold that in your minds uh because you're going to come to a place here in a little bit and i don't want you to get confused thinking oh a crisis of faith and and i'm not doing this and i'm not doing that but it's the word wanting to have preeminence so in isaiah chapter 55 it says ho everyone that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price i just want to break these two verses down tonight a little bit in isaiah 55 so it says every one that thirsteth when it uses this word thirst it's an intense desire it's a vehement active restless hunger for something so it's not just everyone that i would like a drink it's everyone that thirsteth it's an intense desire a vehement desire it is something that's even a restless desire for something that this cannot be just easily satisfied this is very deep this is very strong and so it addresses this person who's thirsty or this person it's addressing this person two ways one that is thirsty and it says he that hath no money so it is care the person is characterized as one that's thirsty and he that hath no money he that hath no silver the word that's used there would be silver or or talents or or some sort of token he that hath no silver and therefore there must be a consciousness of a lacking cannot be allowed to see in condition where i'm rich increased with goods i have needed nothing i have everything that i need and not just say would you like a really nice drink no this is somebody who knows that they they're thirsty knows that they can't buy this drink they know that they don't have what's necessary to provide for themselves everyone that is thirsty with this vehement desire and he that have no money is conscious of their lacking or their neediness this is the person that's being addressed he that is thirsty he that hath no money and then it says come ye who the thirsty and poor to the waters this is the first invitation ye that are thirsty come to the waters it's an invitation to abundance that's going to satisfy this deep longing in this person you that have this vehement desire this deep longing this this restlessness in you there's something that's active a thirst that is active come to the waters and it's not just water but water so it speaks of abundance that's going to satisfy and quench that intense desire and it's saying that come to the waters and then it says come by wine and milk and the waters the wine and the milk these are things that are necessary for spiritual life just as there might be a reference to how that uh water and bread and the wine and the milk are necessary for natural life and it's referring to these elements that one would rely upon to give strength to the natural body the word god speaking here is referring to water wine and milk as things that are necessary for spiritual life and and i want to just point this out it's referring to the word of god when he says come to the waters come by wine and milk he's referring to the word of god which maintains which gives you your spiritual life which maintains and nourishes your spiritual life it's what strengthens you and gives you and gives you power the word of god in ephesians chapter 5 verse 26 speaking about jesus christ that he might sanctify and cleanse the church with the washing of water by the word so it says come to the waters it's referring to the word the word is the water the word is what washes speaking of even wine it says come by wine we know that wine it's that power of spiritual revelation of the word that stimulates the believer we've heard this in the teaching of the seals that the wine type is referencing to the power of revelation spiritual revelation that stimulates the believer what gives what causes the believer who slumped down and sad revelation it causes him to be stimulated to pick him up the bible says in psalms 19 verse 8 the statutes of the lord are right rejoicing the heart it speaks of a stimulation what stimulates us the word of god does the statutes of the lord are right they're correct they stimulate they rejoice the heart so the water is the word the wine is the word in first peter chapter 2 verse 2 as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby so the water is the word the wine is a reference to the word the milk is a reference to the word which nourishes our souls and causes us to grow up into his image so the the bible is speaking he that is thirsty he that has no money come to the waters come by wine and milk he's speaking about the word of god and brother branham we used this statement last time in the smyrnan age no true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of god now all these elements are necessary for this sentence to hold up as as correct and it's referring to the true believer no true believer is going to be any more healthy than their knowledge of and adherence to their understanding of and their obedience to the pure word of god so your spiritual health your spiritual vitality your aliveness and how you're thriving is based upon as a true believer it's based upon your understanding knowledge and revelation of the word of god and your subsequent humility submitting and obedience to that word of god therefore what we desire is we desire to hear the word of god that we may know the word of god so that we can be alive in the word of god our desire is to hear the word not fables not stories not opinions but i want to hear the word as a true believer i must be hearing the pure word of god understanding the pure word of god then submitting myself to the pure word of god in order to be strong healthy and alive because i'm not going to be any more healthy alive and strong than my knowledge of an adherence to the pure word of god so everyone that's thirsty he that has no money come to the waters come to the word to receive your nourishment come to the wine come to the mill come by these things and partake of them that you may be strong now it this the even the way this is structured the the uh the wording of it is very unique it says you know he that hath no money come by and it's so it's somewhat of a paradox how could we buy something if we have no money understanding that this is god now calling someone to a spiritual benefit how is it that we could transact or afford the word what is it i'm going to bring to give in exchange for the word and say well you've made this word available here's this water here's this wine here's this milk which rep which is referring to the word of god and i brought my purse with me i brought my wallet i brought my debit card how is it we're going to transact for the word of god there's no consideration that could be given for what is being offered do you disagree should we should we make this open forum and you could you could share with me what you think is valuable enough to exchange for the word of god there's no consideration that could true properly be given that would be a just transaction for what god is offering because the word is priceless you have nothing that you can give for it there's nothing you could offer there's nothing you could pay there's nothing that you could give in value that is equatable to the value of the word that's being offered but he says come and buy and it says everyone that's thirsty he that has no money come to the waters and it says come ye by the word by there means purchase grain or purchase corn and that's why it says eat so it's not just referring to water milk and wine this is not just a liquid diet and this isn't your justification well i found a juice cleanse in the bible uh no this is uh this is a reference to even buying grain or buying corn so come and buy come and come and transact saying but yet it can be had without money and without price it can be had without silver without talents without without something for you to give i want you to ponder this because the price is not in what is being given these are this is something that's being freely offered it's being freely granted say come take what i'm offering to you freely that's what the scripture is wanting us to see is that these things are being freely given this is the word of god that's being offered and the price is not in what is given but in what is being forsaken i want you just to consider that for a moment it's not in what is being given but it's in what is being forsaken it's in whatever's keeping you from it it's not bothering me at all it's sounding a little funny but it's not bothering me at all well i'm only going to have one hand to bless god's people if i start walking down the aisles let's see if this works well something somewhere's going wrong i ain't bothered by it as we're taking this scripture come and buy wine and milk without money and without price but there is a i want you just to ponder this there is a cost in order for there to be values the scripture is just referring come and take these things and have these things that says come and buy the buying is not what you're offering but it's what you're leaving that's keeping you from it there's something that you're going to forsake you're going to forsake sin to come to christ you're going to forsake the world to come to christ there's something that you're going to leave off there's something that you're going to give up the worldly attitudes and the worldly wants so there is something that is given up but it's not something that's offered in exchange as if it has enough value to marry you receiving it so there's a price not in what is given but what is forsaken or there's a price in leaving aside the very thing that was keeping you from the word of god that's a cost or that's a price that you should be glad to pay but then also is it the scriptures says this come you that are thirsty but the thirsty who have no money coming by so as i've been pondering this statement and to me it does seem to be somewhat of a paradox it struck me that the cost is actually your desire it says come ye that are hungry you that are thirsty you that have a vehement desire the price is actually your hunger in other words that's the currency that's necessary in order to get the word you've got to have something if you don't want it you're not going to get it if you if if you're not going to seek for it you're not going to find it if you don't say god give it to me then he's not going to give it to you so there's got to be something in your heart that drives you to seek it and so he says you that are hungry even though you have no money come and buy it and it's your hunger that's the currency you use to transact for the word of god your hunger your desire is a currency your hunger is it's it's as if it's purchasing power to get you what you want the bible says blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled what is the thing that they had in order to be filled hungering and thirsting that's all that they had they didn't have anything else i'm really hungry i'm really thirsty and i have a gift card here i have a wallet here i've got cash i've got my dad's credit card he had none of those things the only thing that they have that merit to them being filled was the fact that they were hungry and thirsty and that put them in the channel to get what they had need of the cost is your desire the price is your hunger that's the currency that you use to get this word that's being offered that's why he says in in revelation chapter 3 come by of me gold tried in the fire it says in proverbs 23 23 buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom by wisdom also by instruction also by understanding get wisdom and all that getting get understanding the bible is putting this price on on truth and understanding and wisdom if you're going to get something by the truth and don't sell it because there's nothing as valuable as the truth it's not necessarily suggesting that you can buy the truth because it's easier to sell a lie than to give the truth away but it's saying that this is something that you should desire get it at any cost but don't let go of it for anything get the truth at any cost but don't let go of it for anything because nothing is as valuable as the word of god it says in job chapter 23 verse 12 neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips i have esteemed the words of his mouth i have esteemed i have valued i have revered i have looked to the word and judged it to be worth i have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food in other words his word is greater than my law the law of the flesh that requires nutrients requires sleep requires vitamins requires meat requires food his word is more than my law it's more than the needs of my flesh it's more than the wants of my flesh it's more precious to me than meat and bread i have esteemed his word more necessary than the law that works within me that says you better eat you better sleep in order to be healthy that's a uh that's a carnivore diet uh scripture right there i've esteemed the word of god more necessary than the meat more necessary than food it speaks it's more precious than meat is what he's speaking of in psalms 119 17 72 the law of thy mouth is better he's esteemed the words of his mouth he says the law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver this is this is a value system which is completely changing the way humans think the way humans act as we've been using john chapter 6 and how physical hunger had hijacked their thinking to not perceive the value of the one that was standing before them and would have been more it would have been satisfied with more loaves and fishes and would have been completely content to live out their days on free food and not recognize the value of the one that was standing before him that had they recognized the messiah they said you know what i don't care if i don't eat another day in my life if my sins be forgiven me then smite me smite me lord as much as you want strike me with poverty strike me with famine whatever you want to do to me if my sins be forgiven me and i've been liberated by the word of god into his blessed righteousness then come what may it doesn't matter i'm free but they didn't value the word that was standing before him the law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver psalms 19 10 more to be desired are they than gold yay than much fine gold that's this is the word it's talking about the judgments of the lord his thoughts they're to be desired more than gold you mean you'd want it more than cash you'd want it more than currency you'd want it more than a technology and in all in wealth and riches and a nice car and nice amenities and all these things yes it should be desired more than gold more than fine gold and everything that gold could purchase and then also it speaks to the needs of the body sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb this is how the word ought to be perceived by the true believer this is lifting up the value of the word come ye that are thirsty you that are poor and get acquire and have the word of god and this word ought to be more precious to you than meat it ought to be more precious to you and sweeter to you than the honey and the honeycomb desired more than gold but brother branham says and i know i'm using a lot of callbacks to these other statements we've already read a few times he says and to see right now in this evil day that we live in when unbelievers and scientists and so forth so that captures everybody that would be against the word unbelievers scientists and so forth sometimes we run into so forth sometimes it's unbelievers sometimes it's scientists but unbelievers scientists and so forth are trying to this is what they're trying to do cut away the very value of the word we could look at it in this sense that maybe there it might not be an attack against the word but it's merely a distraction from it in other words they've somehow devalued it and if it can lose its value it loses its impact if you could cut away at the value of the word then it won't be as it won't do for you what it ought to do because you won't be perceiving it the correct way you won't be saying hey this should be desired more than gold this is sweeter than the honey and the honeycomb i have esteemed it more than my necessary food if you don't recognize the true value of it and what it can do you won't use it to its fullest extent so many times satan is merely satisfied in you not perceiving the correct value of the word even though you've accepted it think about it he knows maybe it's too late to get you to deny it so if he can just get you to deny how powerful it is what did he teach us if he could just get you to doubt your weapon no it's not not deny that you have it not deny it completely but just doubt that it's greater to get you to say well i know i've got it i believe this i believe that but have some sort of doubt that makes it subject to the circumstance and and what scientists and unbelievers and these modern theo theologians and and the different ways that brother man talks about the modernists in the church are trying to cut away the value and the worth and the power of the word of god the value of the word it's worth its benefit it's power it's strength just cut away at it just diminish it a little bit just water it down just marginalize it make something seem greater than it make something even build up something that's a substitute for it trying to cut away the value of the word who can measure its value how how could we how could we measure the value of the word the word that formed the heavens the word that framed the earth the word that fashioned man the word that stopped the mouths of lions the word that stopped the wind the word that stopped the sun the word that stilled the seas how could you measure the value of a word that created everything that has value how could you accumulate it how could you quantify it how could you qualify how could you put a price tag on the word what's the price of the word that's why the bible says without money and without price there's no price tag if you go to search for the word i mean you can't put you can't put a param well i want to be between a hundred and a thousand if i could that's my sweet spot that's my budget i just want to find it no there's no value on it it's priceless how are we going to use economics to figure out what the value of the word is let's let's use the law of supply and demand to figure out just how what what a fair price would be for the word you can't do it it's limitless supply and almost no demand you can't use economic theory you can't use um the the metrics of fairness and the things that we might try to come up with to find value and what are scientists and unbelievers and so forth trying to do cut away the value of the word so it asks this in verse 2 why wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread why are you spending money your silver those things that you commit for that which is not bread so speaking of that which feeds that it's beneficial something that feeds you and why do you spend your labor exercise your labor in things that don't satisfy you ponder this very very sincerely tonight why do you spend money wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfy if not here's different ways that it's translated and the meaning that's behind these words that are used why would you be so zealously attached to something from which your souls derive neither comfort nor nourishment why would you zealously pursue something and be an ardent supporter of something and get behind something and put your time into something and be attached to something that your soul does not derive neither comfort nor nourishment from what is it that you are benefiting from if you get behind something and pursue something if it doesn't nourish your soul that's the question that's being asked why is there continual sacrifice spending and giving but no lasting profit or satisfaction come on somebody at least think about your neighbor why are there continual sacrifices spending and giving but no lasting profit or satisfaction it's asking the question why give time and opportunity and strength to something that does not nourish and not only does it not nourish but it's actually harmful and destructive destructive why do you spend why do you give why do you support why do you do things for something that's not only no benefit to you but it actually defiles it cankers it riles up your spirit instead of refreshing and feeding that's the question that's being asked in isaiah 55 2. why do you labor for support get behind spend encourage be attached to pursue labor for spend your money on something that doesn't benefit you that's a good question isn't it wouldn't we all like to ask the neighbors in apartment 23 all right why do you do that because we couldn't be talking about us in proverbs chapter 20 verse 17 it says bread of deceit is sweet to a man this was a very profound statement i'm not going to unpack it in the least bit tonight but i want to just use a quick principle from it bread of deceit to sweet to a man but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel think about it there's a it may appear pleasant it may appear even acceptable it may even seem to be right it may be something that in the moment you enjoy and it might be something that you feel oh well this is good this is acceptable this is why i'm doing this this is why i'm pursuing it in the context of why do you spend money for that which is not bread and labor for that would satisfy not when you're deceived you might think initially that there's some benefit in it but ultimately your mouth is just full of gravel it causes an empty belly and pain to your mouth that's what the scripture is painting the picture of it's a bread of deceit deceit that there's so it's in the mechanics of what you're eating it may appear to be good it may appear to be satisfying but it's not satisfying in proverbs chapter 13 verse 23 much food is in the tillage of the poor the poor who labor the poor who work there's food that comes from laboring but there is that but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment where there's a lack of discernment where there's a lack of recognition of need where there's a lack of where the bread of deceit deceives someone thinking this is precious this is good this is beneficial and they only end up with a mouthful of gravel where one realizes they're needy and they're poor and that they have need of something they will labor and they will seek to have food and so there's a lot of food to someone who labors knowing that they're needy but there's a lack of discernment that causes people to starve there's no reason to starve except you lack discernment don't take this personal i know how sometimes we might feel like there's just a spotlight on us and say why is brother aaron picking on me tonight this is they're not taking the spirit we're just talking about truth this is truth there is no excuse for not being fed except a lack of discernment it says in proverbs chapter 13 verse 25 the righteous edith to satisfying of his soul but the belly of the wicked shall want translation in the bible we're reading together is a family reading the bible in a year it says the righteous eat to live and the wicked lived to eat and what is it something's not right something's out of balance it's that bread of deceit that seems sweet and we're gonna get and we're gonna have and how there's no labor for it is there's much food in the laboring of the poor but that that is where there's no judgment there's a one of judgment that is destroyed it says the righteous will eat to the satisfying of his soul the righteous will eat and be satisfied but the wicked eat and still want never quite satisfies it never nourishes it's just it's something that's just done in the moment it's something just to placate it's nothing just to check the box but the righteous know that they've got to have this to live whereas the wicked think well we're just enjoying an abundance and we're just doing this because we can and we're just going to have this and to have that and just playing games but the righteous knows it's life or death so they eat to live where's the wicked just they live to eat because it's all in the abundance and the show of it the bible is asking the question you're not being fed that's what isaiah 55 2 is saying why are you not being fed why is it that you are starving i'm even asking this as believers to us in the time that we're living in today how could we be starving even why is it i hunger not in the sense that i'm getting more i have something and i want more but why am i dissatisfied why do you spend money for that which is not bread why do you labor for things that don't satisfy those are the questions that are being asked now if to this point you feel as if i've been given a pretty good beating to somebody you don't know i'm who i'm talking about but you just figure somebody's getting raped over the coals the devil's going ah he's been exposed in someone's life but not mine this is where i wanted to hit home with this with this as the the background with this is kind of our backdrop these things that we've built up to this point it's very easy as individuals and even as a church to develop bad habits which would perpetuate the cycles of revival and famine you've got you please just think very personally about this and and recognize uh there are certain modalities or modes or methods or ways that we do things and in cycles that we go through and these things that can take place where we're just all kind of in the mode and it's almost as if we've all just acknowledged that i got on a roller coaster and this is we're just on a roller coaster we're going down up and down and that's what church becomes it's just a roller coaster and we've all just kind of strapped in and one day it's all going to be over and one day we're going to meet the lord in the air and one day is going to be no more no because we've just accepted this as this is the way things work but that's not how god works there's ways that we can conduct ourselves it's very easy to develop bad habits that perpetuate the cycle of revival and famine revival and famine and we just kind of get in this mode where we're kind of nurtured and we've evolved to the place where i better get what i can now because i could be on a famine i better get what i can now because there's going to be a famine and it's a cycle that we must break the bride in this hour is a cycle breaker she is the ultimate cycle breaker so whatever cycles there were whatever fashions there are whatever traditions there are whatever systems there are that have withheld kept the bride back from defeating death this bride you have been called up and ordained in this hour to break every cycle you've got to break them all and there's this cycle of revival and famine and oh we're going to have special meetings whoa and then just go right back down again and what you kind of you're looking forward to the next invitation so brother aaron when's brother cadre coming back you know you have any plans on having him back and you're slipping notes to the the brother maybe you could invite this brother did you know so-and-so is in town and maybe you should do this why because you're hungry for revival so you're looking for the next meeting to bring it and it's a bad habit that's encouraging and allowing the system to subsist and it gets justified and gets entrenched and it's all revival famine revival famine brother branham says in the message supernaturally says the sermon entitled supernatural i believe the message is supernatural not just the one that was supernatural i've been asked before and the question is well what year did brother branham say that and my answer has always been in the year in which he was a prophet it seems to work he says and that's what's the matter with the people today they got campground cramps they go to revival and have a great time the first thing you know a little after that before another revival could come along they're back in the world again now i'm not gonna i'm not making the point that this is what we're doing as message believers that we have revivals and we go in the world but i want you to recognize that he's identifying a pattern where you get campground cramps you feed on the word of god you go to revival you have a great time and then after that you go back into a grind or a certain way and it's a system where things just really aren't that great and they're just like a snowball rolling downhill and ah this isn't very good this isn't good but then there's a revival that comes and you kind of get picked up you get lifted up and okay maybe we can make this work okay maybe maybe this is gonna this is good but then it just goes through this cycle and he calls it campground cramps and he's referring to diet he's referring to how a person eats he says in the message where pentecost failed now you're finding yourself with cramps he says not enough manna backsliding from one meeting to another now as a believer we're backslid as long as we're not going forward so it's not that we have to go back it's just we're not going forward so he says you're finding yourself with cramps something wrong with your diet he says not enough manna in the message hidden life with christ there's people sitting here listening to me tonight that loves the lord that's living out there in those courts he's talking about those different courts and coming to the holiest of holies and that hidden life but there's a place that you can live he says speaking with tongues and shouting having a good time eating the manna because there's a manner that's associated with those he says and the missed mill cramps just in a few days campground cramps he says not enough mana cramps now missed mill cramps in a few days here's the revival here's a here's the word and here's a rejoicing having a good time feeding on the word of god but then somehow you missed mills and in a few days he says you don't know what it's all about i just can't hold on brother adam i don't know what's the matter what is he describing the cycle of revival and famine and you're all and you're not feeding in the famine so whenever the preacher comes along you just gorge and gorging what happens you eat too much and you get cramps something's wrong with that lifestyle something's wrong with that way of thinking i pray to god that the only time that it's not the only time that you're eating i pray that it's not this that you're only eating when you come to church i pray that that's not what's happening is you're just wow you're not feeding on the word of god through the week you're not praying reading your bible you're not listening to the message you're not in the word and then you come here and you're going to try to get something out of the word it's going to be like trying to drink out of a fire hydrant it says in another place called hidden a hidden life he says and i think a lot of people has had a lot of campground cramps anyhow that when they go and eat of the lord on the campground and before another revival can come along they're all back and notice he says all back and twisted up in some kind of cult or something else what's the matter brother you've never walked in somewhere else so it's only happening when the meetings are going it's only happening when the revival is taking place there's a mindset he's identifying at that time a pentecostal mindset where they were literally living from meeting to meeting and they were living to eat instead of eating to live and they weren't getting what they needed from the word of god to sustain them and keep a constant trajectory they were going revival and famine revival and famine revival and famine so they weren't even getting what they needed in their meetings because their judgment was wrong they would eat and just get krampus they wouldn't get enough man they wouldn't get the right things they're speaking with tongues having a good time praising and rejoicing he says the revival comes along but then they have campground cramps and after a while they're back in the same kind as something else some kind of occult some kind of way of thinking some kind of mode some kind of twisted pattern and they haven't found that right channel brother abraham says it this way some people just eat enough mana to make them write good and hungry for some more but one revival to another you have to go out and get renewed again he's identifying the cycle of revival and famine and it's very easy for us as individuals and then collectively even as a church to get into this mode where we're just existing from meeting to meeting i'm sure some of you have experienced this there's this uh mindset that i was familiar with for myself and i knew others that had it that you would go to easter camp in louisiana and i thank god for brother tim pruitt brother danny williams who uh and and there was brother cabra who even maybe helped with the first one but brother tim pruitt has kept those meetings going for decades had been a tremendous blessing and you'd have this you would know that you could meet the lord there you could have an experience and god would move and there'd be a tremendous atmosphere that would be created and so god could move in your heart at a meeting and then you'd kind of go in the glow of that and the energy of that and then if you fell away a little bit or got cold or you backslid you'd have this thought in your mind well next easter come on am i right you'd have in your mind well next march next april and so you'd kind of just think well i've got the next eight months off if you did really good or maybe the next 11 months off and you just have in your mind well i'm just gonna wait for the next one and it's almost as if that's wired into our daily thinking about church that well whenever we have meetings everything's going to be great and the word's going to be good and everything's going to be in order everybody's going to be excited and everything's going to come forth and you live from revival to revival if you're doing that you're living way below your privileges living way way way way way you're a minor now you've gotten underneath and started digging and you're finding rock bottom because the skies are full of the real thing and you're tunneling to nonsense because we ought to not live in that cycle of revival and death because god has made available to you the entire word of god for you to feed on 24 7 365. people just eat enough to get by from one revival to another brotherhood says this in the message thirst it comes from a larger statement that i wanted to use and and i'd kind of taken it out but then i just felt just later this afternoon i have to at least use this part here if you neglect to satisfy a thirst of water or food you will die he's making the point he says maybe maybe you're not caught with these thirst and you lust after this and you lust after that and you want to do things and the way it says maybe maybe you're not caught up in that end he says but let me identify and point out of another dangerous place to be and he's saying the danger of neglecting a thirst so maybe not you're not out there you know snorting cocaine and maybe you're not out there you know chasing you're the black tar heroin dealer you know somewhere and trying to do drugs and do this or you're not robbing and stealing and cheating maybe you're not caught up in those thirsts and those addictions but he's saying maybe you're neglecting the thirst he's saying just as bad if you neglect to satisfy a thirst to water food you will die if you neglect that thirst in you for god you will spiritually die he says you call for revivals you wait for your church to have a revival he says well that ain't the revival for you the revival ought to begin right in you when you begin to thirst for god it's not waiting for a preacher to bring it a pastor to bring it a service to bring it or some time of the year to bring it he says that ain't the revival for you i love how he makes it personal right here in 1965 he says that's not the bride's revival the bride's revival is not waiting for something to happen her revival's here and she's gonna have it when she gets hungry for it i'm not sitting around twiddling my thumbs will or just it will work till jesus comes and just waiting for something to happen as if a revival is gonna come one day when a 900-foot jesus splits the sky no your revival is here right now the revival ought to begin right in you when you begin to thirst for god that's when it starts and he's identifying a mentality in this message supernatural when presence where pentecost failed and hidden life with christ a hidden life and these other places he's identifying this mindset to where you're just surviving not in revival and and it's remarkable it's as if people are dying and they get resuscitated on the surgery table of a special meeting and they've come back from flatlining finally have a special meeting like isn't this great and that's wonderful everything's great hallelujah praise the lord this is great they're just surviving they still got the iv cooked up near they they're not they're still in the surgery room they're not living and they're just conscious enough in this grade and if there's one just in time for another meeting you haven't been called to survive is that what we want to do in laodicea survive listen the bride is not going to have a bumper sticker on the back of her car in the millennium saying i survived laodicea it's going to be i absolutely destroyed it i so defeated it i'm not even identified with it i'm not even considered a laodicean bride i'm a bright age bride that's how far away i have put laodicea from me i'm not beaten down by it i'm not touched by it i'm not living it i don't smell like it i don't look like it i don't feed on it i'm not it i am then my bright age feasting with my king not just surviving but i'm thriving in a bright age not just getting by but i'm in revival because what is the bride's revival is it just eking out we're all fighting over the same thing you let me have some you let me have some it's my turn let me have a drink please please it's my turn i'm dying over here brother braham says in recognizing your day in its message he says god created me a revival i don't send one created me one let me be the revival let each one of us be the revival the revival in me when does the revival begin when you begin to thirst for god so he says make me lord to hunger make me to thirst create in me lord that what is needed in me create it in me what i need created in me i'm not even having to go to somebody else and say well you got what i need no you create what i need in me you give me what i need make me hunger make me thirst because i want to be the revival create in me a revival the revival in me not a revival in a church building not a revival in special meetings not a revival of the camp not a revival on a particular weekend but lord let me be the revival how is that going to happen by the word coming to you and having promised and as i hunger and thirst for the word the revival begins when i begin to thirst for god and i say i want it more than i want food i want it more than i just want a good church service i want it more than i just want some program i want the word that's your revival not being fed really not being fed there's no reason to go without food saints there's no reason to go four days without it there's no reason to go to a week there's no reason to go a decade there's no reason to go a day without manna because despite the spiritual drought god has provided food despite all of man's attempts and satan's attempts and despite the the the thousands of years of church age history and christ being bound by creeds and dogmas god has made a way yes there's a famine but god's done something he's raised something up it says in psalms 105 verses 16 to 17 as we were looking at john chapter 6 jesus is talking about bread and he said you just seek me because you want the miracles you seek me because you saw miracles and in seeing the miracles experiencing the miracles it fed your body and you only seek me because your belly is full not because you have spiritual discernment that the word is standing before you so really they had mouths full of gravel they hadn't eaten to satisfy their soul but their belly is still wanted why because it was just natural bread and they were the ones that said well in the exodus it was you know when we were in the exodus our fathers ate man in the wilderness and moses provided manna and they go to the exodus to identify how that god made provision and in psalms 105 it's telling that story of how god brought the children of israel out of egypt but as it's describing how they were in egypt and they were in a famine he said moreover he god called for a famine upon the land he break the whole staff of bread so here's israel or in the land of egypt and in the whole region round about there had been a famine come upon canaan and palestine even abraha abraham's family and the children of israel there had been a famine come upon the whole region there was a famine in egypt a famine in palestine a famine in the middle east perhaps maybe the whole world was suffering a famine but notice what it says in verse 17 he sent a man before them even joseph so god caused a famine we read that there's going to be a famine in the land that i will send to famine not for bread and not for water not for human food or food that feeds the soul or the body but rather a famine of hearing the word of god i the lord will cause a famine and here it says i brought a famine a famine came over the whole world but i've sent a man before you i've sent someone before you even joseph and you can begin to identify how that in laodicea as it's descending into chaos and descending into darkness god had sent a man even a prophet who is going to bring a spiritual revelation that would feed the bride spiritual manna to give her strength for a rapture he sent a man before them even joseph and it was joseph who in interpreting the dreams understood that there would be seven years of great fatness there'd be seven years of great harvest and then there'd be seven years of famine and he by in spiritual insight he sent a man before them using this phrase he sent a man before them even joseph is just to bring him to view that how despite a famine coming he had given one with spiritual insight who could provide in a time of famine and joseph had the wisdom to say store up build up greatness build up silos store up grain during the time of plenty and during the time of fatness so that whenever the famine comes you can have grain to live by and you can make it through the famine and notice how joseph this this plan is orchestrated and unfolds in genesis chapter 47. and i'm using this and i could have perked you up a little bit by saying in closing uh because i'm sure i'm wanting to use this to kind of as my final to bring it to a final use of scripture here he says in there the bible says in genesis chapter 47 verses 13 to 18 and there was no bread in all the land but he had sent a man before him no bread and all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine now notice what begins to happen in joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the corn which they bought this is this is what's actually happening there's a famine but now joseph has put together a pr a plan to where because of this famine all the people in egypt and all the land of canaan are taking their money to buy corn of joseph so that all the money that was found in the land of egypt and canaan was accrued and taken by joseph and joseph brought the money into pharaoh's house and when the money fell in the land of egypt in the land of canaan all the egyptians came to joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth and joseph said give your cattle and i'll give you for your cattle if money fell and they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle the herds and for the asses and he fed them with the bread for all their cattle for that year do you are you recognizing what's happening literally there's a famine in all the land but joseph whose prophetic insight has stored up grain but not everybody else did it nobody else had a reserve so when they begin to get into famine and they needed grain they took all their money and they used it to buy corn then once that year was over they don't have any more money left and he says well just give me your cattle so they took their next asset that they had they said all right here's all of our cattle so now pharah has all their money and has all their cattle but the drought is still continuing and when that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him we will not hide it from my lord how that our money is spent my lord also hath herds of cattle and notice this beautiful phrase there is not ought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands a plan had been orchestrated and unfolded to where because of a famine there was money that got rid of there was cattle that got rid of and it got to the place to where now the people had nothing else that they could use to barter nothing else they could use in exchange for what that was being offered except themselves i can give you money i'll just pay this and i'll just give you that and i'll just support with this and i'll get that they finally came to a place where they weren't just playing church anymore they just weren't supporting something it wasn't just games as long as they had something they could give and we're exchanging our cattle we're exchanging our money we're exchanging our time it got to a place of desperation twilight says we've got nothing left but our bodies and our lands and that's exactly what joseph had orchestrated for pharaoh and let me say this if joseph had done that for pharaoh has not jesus christ orchestrate the same thing in our hearts where ultimately what he desires is that our hunger brings us to a place of full surrender and i've got nothing else to give you but me lord that's what he wants to do with the hunger he placed in your heart not just to sympathize with the message not just to support it with ties and offerings not just to attend church not just to say that you believe it not just to be associated with it not just to play church listen he wants the hunger to bring you to a place where one day god i've got nothing else i'm desperate for this word here i am lord this is where our hunger should bring us to give all a place where we realize this is life or death this this we're not playing around could you imagine being in some compound in palestine someone travels through and they've got a whole bunch of bags full of grain and someone says well i'm not being fed not being fed haven't you heard there's granaries for haven't you heard there's a place you can go did you not listen this message is not bound by creeds and dogmas this message is not bound by man's interpretation this message is not the message of man this is not a message that can be manipulated and controlled the true word of god is yours it's your right it's your privilege you can ask for it you can have it not being fed are you kidding me this word is yours eat it there's no excuse for not being fed so he says hearken isaiah 55 2 hearken hearken diligently unto me and eat that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness hearken unto me the word hearken unto me that which is essential and you will be fed abundantly not just enough to make it to the next revival but come to my word and eat that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness brother braham talked about the a fish being in the water and being afraid to run out or a mouse in the granaries of egypt you know gathering around just a little bit of grain and say well we better be careful we don't want to run out don't live below your privileges we shouldn't live below our privileges but our hunger should be leaving us leading us to a place we recognize this is life or death i must i must be fed i must be feeding on the word of god i must be receiving substance i guess one question we should all ask ourselves is what i'm eating on going to lead me to a body change or my spiritual habit is going to lead me to a body change because that's the promise of this age now if we were in another age we could say well you know what kind of casket do you want how do you want your funeral and what i feed it on is it going to bring me to a grave but that's not the hour we're living in and that's why i would say this we often experience such disappointment because it's that pinch the pining of a hunger for more that's why you just aren't satisfied with playing church that's why you're not just satisfied with politics and personality that's why there's something in he says i know i've got to be in fellowship with the word that's why you knew streaming wasn't enough because you knew that's not how god ordained their body change to happen is by viewing something on a screen i liken it could you stream your own wedding i mean this is an invisible union that's taking place service after service there's something powerful that's happening that you want to be present for there's a dynamic that's present and a body of christ being a part of it you can't stream it to make it it's wonderful how the it can supplement and it can work in in places when we don't have the opportunity but listen you have to really challenge yourself on am i in a place where i'm feeding on the word of god in my inner channel where i'm getting the word of god that i need to meet the mark of this age brother branham makes the statement and christ is a mystery god revealed he says why do you hunger church because i know you're hungry not just because it's 8 30 and you didn't you ate at five o'clock i know you're hungry i know you're hungry because i'm i'm the one that's standing before you on wednesdays and sundays and i feel your pinch all through the week you're hungry for the word we're we're not hungry for another cycle we're not hungry for another a method or system we live from revival to revival we're hungry for a body change we're hungry for a rapture we're hungry for the word of god we're hungry for christ nothing else will satisfy he says why are you hunger why do you thirst this is so beautiful it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you the repetition of history the reciting of things past said uh even just the the laying out of quotes those things aren't going to satisfy you what's going to satisfy you is the revelation of the hidden secret that pining that pinching that desire that hunger that you've had you think well brother aaron i've had this hunger this appetite from the moment i came to the message in the 70s and it's never left me i was always restless what was it god trying to reveal to you not that god sent a prophet not to say what the tapes say not to just revel in some history but to receive the father's secret that's what you're hungry for is the father's secret he says but you let so many things get it out of you you let so many things keep you from it he says without money without price what value have you set between you and the hidden secret you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of this world you let some pastor you let somebody else get that out of you what get out the pining the desire the longing for the father's hidden secret when you know let's say i i would just i know in your heart right now maybe you have a desire for family you have a desire for a lost loved one you have a desire for somebody you have a desire in your own hearts think about this when you know that way down in your heart you are thirsty hungry it's god trying to reveal it to you that's what he wants to do he wants to reveal his hidden secret to you nothing else is going to satisfy plain church won't do it plain holy won't do it doing this and doing that nothing else will do it nothing will satisfy unless the father has revealed himself to you why are you a hunger why do you thirst i believe there's some people that are hungry i believe there's people that are not being fed and they don't know where to go they don't know what to do and maybe just crack the door open to the things i've been studying on we have been called to be stewards of the mysteries not the protectors of it not the ones that are going to hide it not the ones that are going to cover it and say well you know it's not for everyone we're not the ones that we're not building walls we're not protecting it when it made your stewards of the mysteries it makes you a distributor of it that means you have a responsibility to find the person who's hungry for it and i would want that to be at the heart of every single one of you that's here tonight that that god is gathering together around the fresh word of the lord that there would be something inside of you that takes ownership of the fact that you have found the more that you found a provender you found a grain you found a word where the carcass is there the eagles would be gathered and he recognized that i have a stewardship not to to gather this and to myself and to horde over it and to be protect over but made a steward of the mystery and i have a responsibility to find the hungry and to invite them come to the table come to the place where the word is being presented come where you could find satisfaction for your soul i say that maybe we could have a heart's cry tonight lord i am hungry lord i want to be fed lord i don't want to repeat cycles lord i don't it's easy just to get in the cycle that perpetuates revival and famine lord break me out of that cycle but also god i pray that you would send the hungry lord send the hungry send those that are thirsty send the poor send the needy send the broken send the hurting because we found a word that can heal found something that satisfies oh god let it not be said from my lips that i'm not being fed may it not be i'll take responsibility i believe that i i can as a minister i can through shortcomings and through a lack of sanctification and a lack of humbling myself and forgetting of what that i'm a sheep you could go down a path to where yes you're not preaching what the people need to feed on so i'm not making it all your responsibility i make it mine oh god let it never be said that i'm not feeding the lambs oh god let it not be said that i'm not feeding the sheep that's a responsibility that a man god has but may none of us ever say we're not being fed if you're not get somewhere where you can do it the hour's way too late way too late we're not playing church we never were but we it was never a game we were just playing one it's life for death saints not being fed let's go forth from here purpose in your heart saints from now on i am not going to live from revival to revival i'm not going to live from brother diggs to brother diggs i'm not going to live from brother glover to brother lawson i'm not going to live for man of god to man of god i'm going to feed on the word of god i'm going to be fed because that's my right please stand with me god send the hungry come come you are thirsty is it not the final voice to the final age that's saying come let him that heath say come let him that thirst come whosoever let him take the water of life freely is that not our message is that not the final voice to the final age it wasn't this way when i lived here before and 2006 to 2010 we didn't all have our own water bottles [Music] but now everybody's got their water bottle right they got their personalized stickers on it and everyone's carrying i'm not preaching against water bottles relax but it's like we've all got the our water bottle so it's kind of like i got mine do you have yours and what are we looking at after our hydration looking out after ourselves i got my water i want to be sure i'm hydrated it's dry it's a dry heat it gets hot it's dry i need to dehydrate i need to stay make sure i'm drinking enough fluids to be healthy but this message has not just given you a personalized water bottle with all your stickers on it jezebel religion i really like that one spoken word the original seed we have been invited to a fountain fountain's been opened up and you've been called to it think about what he's done for you think of the joy that you have the liberty you have think of the forgiveness of sins think of the revelations you feed on think i wear it think i want you to think right now think about where your spirits are isn't it wonderful if you just look now in 2021 look back at the things the waves of things that have beat against this message for the last 15 years or so or 20 years and the things that have come against it and beaten against it and the things that have been shaken and things that fall away and look where you are today with smiles on your face face happy with the message of the hour feeding on it being invigorated by listening to the ministers of god who lift up this message and think about the joy you have why because the fountain's been opened up and you were called to that found without merit but by election called to that fountain and you've been feasting this table you've been drinking of this word you've been stimulated by the wine you've grown from the milk you've been washed by this water and now you look out and you say come come come to this table [Music] not you don't belong here you're not worth it you're not worthy oh it's just us and it's only going to be this it's only that no but come come wouldn't you want to see somebody else experience the liberty that you've experienced the looseness for the loosing from bondage the freedom that you have in your heart the joy that you have to feed on the word of god wouldn't you want to see somebody deliver somebody else let me say come here it is i don't have a personalized water bottle i've had a fountain and i say come you who are thirsty you that have a vehement desire you that are restless you that are not drinking you that are not being fed come come to a fountain come to christ come to your revival how am i gonna get it when you get thirsty for god that's when you're gonna get it it's bower heads [Music] your heads are bowed the hour's getting [Music] late [Music] are there hands that could represent a hungry heart are there hands that could represent a thirsty soul cry in your heart god give me my meat were we not taught to pray give me this day my daily bread not my annual bread not my bread of camp meetings and my bread of camps and my bread of banquets but lord give me my daily bread lift up hands and say god give me my bread lift up hands say god lead me to the table that i've been ordained to sit at show me my place at the table lord show me my feast the bride has been invited to a spiritual feast that this world knows nothing of it's time to break cycles of wandering around up and down and in and out like a gypsy like a vagabond whatever it might be it's time to end the wandering and come to the fountain come to the table and be fed say lord give me this day my daily bread i don't want to scavenge anymore i don't want to have to hunt anymore lord show me where the fresh kill is so i can feed and feed my soul with fatness sir cry in your heart let it be known by the lifting of your hands lord i'm hungry for holiness lord i'm hungry for your word lord i'm hungry for more and god will give you the more [Music] it couldn't be more if you're hungry for it there must be more gracious heavenly father but i'm feeling so pulled to continue just to admonish the people to break the cycle i'm speaking to individuals not making observations about churches or situations but lord i'm talking about how we as individuals can live within a mindset to where we're living from meeting to meeting revival to revival lord it would even be wrong to live from sunday to wednesday just dragging ourselves to church to get a little bit to survive [Music] lord may these eagles recognize today that the chain has been cut they're no longer tethered to that pen they're no longer tethered to that stake and lord though they may have wandered in circles for years in circles for years lord they may have pecked around in that barnyard for decades and decades may they recognize the call of the mother eagle that has told them they don't have to live by chicken scratch they don't have to try to scratch out a living they don't have to try to eek by and compete with a bunch of chickens for chicken feed but lord may they catch the revelation that there's fresh kill there's fresh manna may they find themselves at their place at the table and receive of you [Music] may we break this cycle this mindset in our minds lord lord i i call it back to this thought that overwhelming the beginning [Music] of the devil attacking us [Music] lord you're attacking the devil the only thing that's happening is a bunch of chickens are starting to realize that the eagle is waking up the eagle's recognizing who she is the eagle's recognizing that she doesn't eat chicken food but chickens are food and lord i pray that as we begin to recognize that the battle is yours that there's only victories that we have ahead of us that there's no losing there's no failure there's no fallen behind we can turn this battle around to where we realize that we're only taking richmond as we come to it richmond hasn't caught us by surprise we're not fighting because we've been ambushed we're not fighting because the devil's got one over on us we're fighting the devil because the word has found him and exposed him and he's all up in arms and he's screaming and he's slashing and he's fighting because he's having to let go of some ground that he's held for a long time lord we weren't fighting them all those years but now we're fighting them and it may seem as if it's harder but may we recognize that we're possessing more ground today than we've ever possessed before and i say lord strengthen our hands for war [Music] strengthen these hands for war give us strength to fight be that same strength that gives us strength to fight it's going to be the same strength for flight finally break free of everything that's holding us back lord may we be fed may we be fed may we be fed lord this is our revival when we begin to thirst for you let revival come we invite it right now lord revival's been given maybe a dirty word maybe revival is kind of characterized as special meetings the bride's revival is when she begins to line up with the word of god lord send your revival now create in me the revival let me be the revival lord create in me that which is needed in me lord and may it begin now as i hunger and thirst for righteousness bless us we pray now as i commit the people to you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
