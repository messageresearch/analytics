[0:00] but this is a third part in the series
[0:02] on perfect love and as we won't
[0:04] necessarily be tracking that particular
[0:06] title perfect love but that is the
[0:09] subject matter that we're on and tonight
[0:11] I want to look at a more perfect union
[0:15] the preamble to the U.S Constitution is
[0:17] where I got this from it was drafted in
[0:19] 187 18 1787 and in the Preamble it's not
[0:25] the part of the U.S Constitution it's
[0:27] the Preamble and so it's kind of setting
[0:28] forth the purpose of the Constitution
[0:30] and it really kind of captures what the
[0:32] intent of the writers were when they
[0:35] drafted it and what you're seeing here
[0:37] in that little clip is one of the
[0:39] remaining original printings that was
[0:41] done in 18
[0:42] 1787 by the Dunlap and Claypool company
[0:46] out of Philadelphia there's only a few
[0:47] of these remaining I was able to find a
[0:49] clipping of it was very fascinating
[0:50] history but the Preamble States we the
[0:53] people of the United States in order to
[0:56] form a more perfect union establish
[0:59] justice ensure domestic tranquility
[1:01] provide for the common defense promote
[1:04] the general welfare and secure the
[1:06] blessings of liberty to ourselves and
[1:08] our posterity do ordain and establish
[1:11] this constitution for the United States
[1:13] of America so I'm sure this is where
[1:15] where you've heard it before all of you
[1:16] having memorized the Preamble quoting it
[1:19] along with me this is where I the idea
[1:22] and the thought was coming to me on a
[1:23] particular thing and I kept coming back
[1:25] to this phrase a more perfect union a
[1:27] more perfect union the more I thought
[1:28] about it the more I thought it was kind
[1:30] of a peculiar phrase and it it is kind
[1:33] of an odd construct to say a more
[1:36] peculiar a more perfect union and it has
[1:40] been interpreted many different ways
[1:42] several different times and kind of used
[1:44] in whatever time period to justify
[1:47] whatever people wanted to do at the time
[1:48] I believe after the Civil War it was
[1:50] being used as the events that have
[1:52] transpired have created a more perfect
[1:54] union and these events fit into the
[1:56] framework of the Constitution
[1:58] but the word perfect at the time when it
[2:00] was used it kind of means to be complete
[2:02] to uh to be finished also to be fully
[2:06] informed or to be confident about
[2:08] something to be certain about something
[2:09] and if you think about the word more
[2:13] perfect of the phrase more perfect I'll
[2:15] use this as an example
[2:17] um I when I would drink
[2:19] tea and maybe they said do you want it
[2:21] sweetened and I'd say ask for
[2:22] unsweeteness and you want any sugar and
[2:24] I asked for some equal and I'd have some
[2:26] equal with my T and then they'd give a
[2:28] refill and I'd be all out of equal and
[2:30] I'd ask for more equal and somebody
[2:31] would always have the dad joke at the
[2:33] table you can't get more equal
[2:36] right so if it's equal it's equal you
[2:38] can't be more equal
[2:40] and maybe it's the same thought process
[2:42] where how could you be more perfect
[2:44] because perfect is a word that many
[2:46] consider to be absolute in other words
[2:48] it is what it is it should not be
[2:50] qualified in a superlative way or a
[2:53] comparative way to be most perfect or
[2:56] more perfect it just kind of violates
[2:58] the meaning of the word and so more
[3:00] perfect may seem like a logical
[3:01] impossibility if something's perfect
[3:03] it's finished if something is uh is is
[3:07] finished it can't be more finished than
[3:09] what it is it is what it is and so a to
[3:12] say perfect
[3:13] and if perfect and Perfection is
[3:16] absolute then there should be no degrees
[3:18] of perfection
[3:19] and that might be and you might all be
[3:22] thinking I didn't know I was going to
[3:23] stumble into an elective history course
[3:24] tonight but I want you to think in terms
[3:27] of what we've been talking about a
[3:28] litmus test on having love being made
[3:30] perfect and how we think about perfect
[3:32] love and if you don't have it you won't
[3:33] be there and how we immediately begin to
[3:35] judge ourselves by that we're like well
[3:37] if I'm not finished then I'm not perfect
[3:39] then I don't have it there's a lot of
[3:41] conclusions we draw but I'm wanting to
[3:43] use this phrase a more perfect perfect
[3:45] union to kind of understand what God is
[3:48] doing in our life so don't get lost
[3:49] maybe here in the beginning this is just
[3:51] me being able to get my legs underneath
[3:53] me but if Perfection is absolute if
[3:55] perfect is absolute then there should be
[3:57] no Continuum of something being most
[4:00] perfect or more perfect
[4:02] but let me say this to say more perfect
[4:05] indicates progress towards perfection
[4:08] and this is what causes us to stumble
[4:11] sometimes when it comes to perfect love
[4:12] is we think we either have it or we
[4:14] don't
[4:15] if love is perfect or if perfect love is
[4:18] a finished love it's complete love it's
[4:20] an accomplished love and if I don't have
[4:22] that then I don't have it at all so
[4:24] we're kind of targeting that mindset to
[4:26] think oh no I don't have it I don't have
[4:28] perfect love and I don't have what it
[4:30] takes and we want you to kind of drive
[4:32] away any kind of fear or any kind of
[4:34] myth that keeps us from just accepting
[4:36] God's love for us
[4:38] and so when we use the phrase a more
[4:40] perfect union and as we use it tonight
[4:42] we want to express it to you it's
[4:44] suggests a union that is closer to
[4:46] perfection than it was before
[4:49] that there's something that ought to be
[4:50] in our hearts or we're striving for
[4:52] better we're striving for more and that
[4:54] we realize that we are a fallible human
[4:56] beings that are fallen in love with an
[4:58] infallible God and there's something
[5:00] reflected in his love that we want our
[5:02] our love to rise up to or maybe there's
[5:05] a Christ reflected in somebody else that
[5:07] we admire and we want Christ to be
[5:09] magnified in us the same way so to say a
[5:12] more perfect union I'm saying it's a
[5:14] Perfection it's a Unity a Harmony that's
[5:16] greater than it was before
[5:18] and if I could have a thesis statement
[5:20] just to make everybody cringe if the
[5:22] History part didn't get you to have a
[5:24] thesis that's in our pursuit of perfect
[5:26] love we are constantly striving for a
[5:29] more perfect union
[5:30] and this if we're going to lay aside
[5:32] everything until we can come to a place
[5:34] where we can love everybody and love our
[5:36] enemies then in this pursuit of perfect
[5:37] love we're striving for a more perfect
[5:40] union
[5:42] now there's a there's a Latin phrase I'd
[5:44] like to share with you and I know that
[5:45] you all know it and are familiar with it
[5:47] and uh and I know just right away you
[5:49] recognize it immediately but the phrase
[5:52] is the perfect is the enemy of good I
[5:54] believe we attribute to Voltaire he
[5:57] writes of it and attributes it to a
[5:59] Latin proverb and basically anybody ever
[6:01] heard that before I maybe hear it said
[6:03] you know don't let uh perfect become the
[6:06] enemy of good but it says the perfect is
[6:08] the enemy of good what it refers to is
[6:10] kind of the thought process where you
[6:12] insist on Perfection and insisting on
[6:15] Perfection often hinders any kind of
[6:17] progress knows if it can't be perfect
[6:19] then we don't want it at all and so we
[6:22] could say in the search for something
[6:23] that's perfect or without flaws uh will
[6:26] bypass many other useful things or
[6:28] refuse to use something or use a
[6:30] resource or enjoy something or have
[6:32] something because it's not perfect
[6:35] and so we use perfect the idea of
[6:37] perfection hinders us from even having
[6:39] good
[6:40] and so we could say this in the sense
[6:42] the perfect is the enemy of good instead
[6:44] of achieving something that's good or
[6:46] even implementing of something that's
[6:47] good we kind of stand still waiting for
[6:49] perfect perfect to come does that make
[6:51] sense as we let the perfect become the
[6:54] enemy of good so we have this kind of
[6:56] Chasm well if I'm not perfect then it
[6:59] doesn't matter or then nothing matters
[7:01] if I'm not perfect then I'm nothing if I
[7:03] if I'm not perfect then I have nothing
[7:04] and then if if it's not all then I don't
[7:07] want any and it's kind of a bad mindset
[7:09] where we do we let the Perfection become
[7:11] the enemy of the good to where we feel
[7:14] that we're so woefully short we feel
[7:16] that we can't measure up we're not
[7:17] perfect and that hinders us from even
[7:20] getting better
[7:22] brother Banner makes the statement press
[7:24] on in that perfect love I believe we
[7:26] referenced it on Sunday press on in that
[7:29] perfect love and to me it identifies
[7:32] that there's a process of our love being
[7:34] perfected by him
[7:36] that he is perfect love and if I have
[7:38] him I have perfect love but to the
[7:40] extent that I want to understand it to
[7:42] the extent I want to be subject to it to
[7:44] the extent that I can fully yield to it
[7:46] that's me pressing on in that perfect
[7:49] love not pressing my way into the
[7:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm I'm not
[7:53] pressing my way into the new birth but
[7:54] yet with uh there's something inside of
[7:56] me that longs for more there's something
[7:58] inside of me that's pressing
[8:00] and so if we use the phrase perfect love
[8:02] and this is just what I'm addressing
[8:04] through these first few Services it can
[8:06] make us feel that we've had either have
[8:07] it or we don't
[8:09] and I don't want us to let the perfect
[8:11] be the enemy of the good
[8:13] and let the Perfection become the very
[8:15] thing that discourages us and either
[8:18] causes us to quit or cause us to think
[8:20] that we don't have anything and I would
[8:23] say that it's easy for the Perfection to
[8:25] be used against us to take away instead
[8:28] of it being used to add to
[8:30] now picking up where we had touched on
[8:32] it before we were looking at the Garden
[8:34] of Eden brother Branham identifies that
[8:36] there there was perfect love and in the
[8:39] statement of Satan's Eden uh if I could
[8:41] say it this way love was not defective
[8:43] love had no flaw it was complete
[8:46] um and when they fell in the and if we
[8:48] look at this quote in Satan's Eden it's
[8:50] when they fell that that which was
[8:51] perfect uh was lost or done away with
[8:54] maybe I don't have those quotes for you
[8:56] but it was in Satan's Eden says they had
[8:59] perfect love one for the other perfect
[9:01] life forever they had perfect love
[9:04] perfect understanding the love of God
[9:06] they had God's word and kept it well
[9:08] that last phrase is familiar to us
[9:09] because this is the love of God that you
[9:11] know his word and that you keep it and
[9:14] so it's describing perfect love love has
[9:16] no flaws love has no fear love has no
[9:19] jealousy love has no anxiety love has
[9:22] never been rebuffed the lovers had never
[9:24] had any disappointments and so when
[9:26] mankind fell we we see that immediately
[9:29] as we touched on it last Wednesday they
[9:31] begin to play the blame game and love
[9:33] was being shifted around and love was
[9:35] being forgotten and they kind of got
[9:36] away from the perfect love and that's
[9:38] when perfect love is lost and it becomes
[9:40] defiled or imperfect but in the
[9:43] beginning I want to just use some
[9:45] statements here at the beginning without
[9:46] really being able to look into it very
[9:48] deeply they had perfect love they had a
[9:51] perfect understanding of the love of God
[9:52] and with that they knew his word and
[9:54] they kept it and in Genesis chapter 2 24
[9:56] it speaks of uh they shall be the two
[9:59] shall be one flesh and so there was
[10:01] Unity among the man the woman and God it
[10:04] wasn't just the man to the woman it
[10:06] wasn't just the woman to the man but
[10:07] they were both United together and then
[10:09] also United to God brother Branham even
[10:11] used the phrase the unity of God to man
[10:13] when he's describing what they had in
[10:15] the beginning Humanity was one with God
[10:18] the man was one with the woman even to
[10:20] where it was bone of his bone flesh of
[10:21] his flesh they had a Harmony and a Unity
[10:24] uh that was that was Perfection and then
[10:27] they also shared that with god brother
[10:30] Branham said in the message Oneness he
[10:31] said they were so perfect in harmony
[10:33] with God till they were one with God
[10:36] so this is this is the image that we see
[10:39] in the very beginning that there was
[10:41] Unity so I'm kind of building this to
[10:43] say a more perfect union we can look at
[10:45] the Garden of Eden said there was
[10:46] perfect love there was perfect harmony
[10:48] there was a perfect unity and God
[10:51] desires to have that kind of
[10:53] relationship with each one of us where
[10:54] it's in harmony that it is a it is a
[10:57] perfect union it is something to wear
[10:59] there there's a Oneness perfect love of
[11:01] God and a perfect understanding and that
[11:03] perfect harmony with God where they are
[11:06] one
[11:07] now I I'm drawing on your this is an
[11:11] upper level course maybe tonight even
[11:12] though it may seem very very simple and
[11:15] I'd be very very easy to understand I'm
[11:16] drawing on your prior understanding the
[11:18] knowledge of the message to teach these
[11:20] things but we're living in an age that's
[11:22] characterized as a restoration of what
[11:25] was lost in the Garden of Eden that
[11:27] that's the time that we're living in a
[11:29] restoration of the garden needing
[11:30] condition brother in the sermon Christ
[11:32] is the mystery of God revealed says the
[11:34] threefold purpose of God's great mystery
[11:36] is revealed God manifested in Christ
[11:38] Christ manifested in the church in order
[11:41] to redeem the Lost Eve back to the
[11:43] original condition in the Garden of Eden
[11:45] so it's back to an original Garden of
[11:48] Eden condition so there must be Unity
[11:50] there must be Harmony there must be
[11:51] Oneness there must be a Unity of God to
[11:54] man and brother Branham says that that
[11:56] purpose was manifested in Adam and Eve
[12:00] so there's something about their Union
[12:02] there's something about their Harmony
[12:03] there's something about their
[12:04] relationship and even if we want to call
[12:06] it a marriage that God was forecasting
[12:08] something God was expressing something
[12:10] and brother Benson it was perfect love
[12:12] Perfect all love all around them no fear
[12:15] at all
[12:16] and now let me say this about the time
[12:18] that we're living in and you believe
[12:19] that the bride has been raised up right
[12:21] I I believe that spiritually we're not
[12:23] living in laodicea
[12:25] now if you haven't been born again
[12:26] you're living in laodicea and physically
[12:29] we're living in laodicea but in a
[12:30] spiritual sense we know that there's
[12:32] been opened up to us a bright age and
[12:35] the bride age is the age of Union
[12:37] it's the age of the invisible Union it's
[12:38] the age of it's an age of perfection it
[12:41] is the Capstone age of Charity and that
[12:44] ceiling of God's bride in those final
[12:46] climactic promises that will result in
[12:48] the change of our body that's that's the
[12:50] time that we're living in it's a union
[12:52] age it's a perfect age it's a perfect
[12:54] love age that's the bride age
[12:57] but let me kind of leave that and I
[13:00] think that kind of wet some of our
[13:01] appetites we're thinking yeah that's the
[13:02] kind of stuff I want to hear but let me
[13:04] just leave it there and say laodicea is
[13:07] the opposite of all that
[13:09] it is the antithesis to all of this
[13:12] because the loudest teenager perverts
[13:14] and is the opposite of each one of these
[13:16] aspects
[13:18] it is the age of the false Union it is
[13:20] an age of a fake love or a false love
[13:21] it's the age of pretense
[13:23] it's the age of a false Union false love
[13:26] it's the age of pretending
[13:28] and in Revelations chapter 3 verses 16
[13:30] 15 16 and 17. this is the prognosis of
[13:34] laodicea I Know Thy works that thou art
[13:36] neither cold nor hot I would that thou
[13:39] art cold or hot so then because Thou Art
[13:41] lukewarm that's lacking Zeal it's tepid
[13:44] uh there it's not Ardent it's
[13:47] indifferent uh this is the age of a
[13:50] lukewarm love this is because Thou Art
[13:52] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[13:55] spew thee out of my mouth
[13:57] because thou says I am rich and increase
[13:59] with goods and have need of nothing and
[14:01] knowest not that thou art wretched and
[14:02] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[14:04] these are the conditions of the age and
[14:07] brother Branham expresses some
[14:09] remarkable things about the condition of
[14:11] the age he says now when anybody says I
[14:13] have need of nothing he could very well
[14:15] be saying I have everything
[14:17] it's really interesting how it seems to
[14:20] be on either of these sides he says they
[14:22] could say I have need of nothing he
[14:23] could very well be saying I have
[14:24] everything or he could be saying I don't
[14:26] want any more as I'm full now
[14:28] you can express it this you can express
[14:30] this any way you want and it all adds up
[14:32] to the fact that the church is
[14:34] complacent
[14:36] so it's not uh what's remarkable when
[14:38] you think about being lukewarm and the
[14:39] character of the age it's not even
[14:40] characterized as Rebellion
[14:42] it's not even being characterized
[14:44] necessarily as we hate Christ and we
[14:46] hate the cross and and we hate God it's
[14:49] such a complacency and an attempted love
[14:53] and tepid passion that he's kicked out
[14:55] of the church and they don't even care
[14:57] and they didn't even necessarily do it
[15:00] of their own volition like we don't want
[15:01] Christ they came so cold and so are so
[15:05] indifferent that he's kicked out of the
[15:07] church and he says add it up any way you
[15:08] want complacent she is satisfied with
[15:11] what she has she either figures she has
[15:13] it all or has enough
[15:15] there's just a lack of Interest
[15:18] there's a lack of passion
[15:20] it just an indifference I think is the
[15:22] way that I was pondering it this week
[15:23] it's just there's really no desire to
[15:25] grow no desire to know more of God it
[15:27] either comes from this place like oh we
[15:29] we know it we've got it figured out we
[15:31] know everything or we know enough
[15:33] we've come so far we know enough and
[15:35] what you'll find as we continue reading
[15:37] here and identifying some things in the
[15:39] message that what it's become for the
[15:41] church is it's all pretense
[15:43] so it's not a real genuine love affair
[15:46] and passion for the things of God it's
[15:49] more social and economical
[15:51] it's more for the appearance of things
[15:53] it's more for the popularity it's more
[15:55] for the power and it's not just the
[15:57] humbly being in love with God and
[15:59] knowing him more and experiences the
[16:01] consequences of pursuing his nature even
[16:04] the love of God is put on his pretense
[16:06] and and a relationship with Christ has
[16:09] put on his pretense for popularity and
[16:12] power among those who seem to be
[16:13] like-minded
[16:19] and we could find where this condition
[16:20] began by looking at Revelations chapter
[16:22] 2 verse 4.
[16:24] where he says nevertheless I have
[16:25] somewhat against thee we're not taking
[16:28] the time maybe to lift up the
[16:30] compliments to the first church age but
[16:32] he's saying I have somewhat against thee
[16:33] this is the complaint in the first age
[16:35] because thou has left thy first love
[16:38] brother Brandon when he preached this uh
[16:41] this church age he said Ephesus was not
[16:43] a deceived Church
[16:45] it failed Itself by not continuing in
[16:47] perfect love
[16:49] so Ephesus was not a deceived church it
[16:51] was not characterized the same way that
[16:53] laodicea is where they're rich increase
[16:55] with goods and they have need of nothing
[16:57] but they don't know that they're poor
[16:59] and blind and naked and miserable and
[17:01] they're wretched people he's saying
[17:02] they're not deceived they just failed to
[17:05] continue in perfect love
[17:08] now that's remarkable because it's not
[17:10] the power of deception necessary that's
[17:12] working on them yet but by leaving their
[17:14] first love they're going to succumb to
[17:16] it
[17:17] they've lost their protection against it
[17:20] and brother Branham says this about the
[17:22] church age he says the fervent desire to
[17:24] please God
[17:25] the passion to know his word
[17:27] the cry for reaching out in the spirit
[17:30] it all begins to fade and instead of
[17:33] that church being on fire with the fire
[17:35] of God it has cooled off and become a
[17:37] bit formal
[17:38] this is what was happening back there to
[17:40] the Ephesians they were getting a bit
[17:43] formal
[17:44] this is this is a caution to us but
[17:47] notice it's not deception it's failing
[17:49] to continue in perfect love
[17:52] he says they cooled off they became
[17:53] began to get formal
[17:55] the abandonment to God was dying out
[17:59] and the people weren't too careful about
[18:01] what God thought of them
[18:03] as they begin to be careful about what
[18:05] the world thought of them
[18:07] this is where I I was inspired to
[18:10] recognize that the seeds of pretense
[18:13] were being sown into the church at that
[18:16] time the seeds of a social gospel the
[18:18] seeds of it's all for economics it's all
[18:20] for social a social clout or Karma this
[18:23] is why they this is what they begin to
[18:26] become succumb to
[18:28] is they weren't careful about what God
[18:30] thought about them they begin to think
[18:31] about what the world or what others
[18:33] thought about them
[18:35] and this is this happens by them not
[18:37] continuing in perfect love because
[18:39] perfect love would have driven them to
[18:41] say how is it that I can please the Lord
[18:44] but instead they're more concerned of
[18:46] how they look to other people
[18:48] and and if I could say this without
[18:50] maybe using uh phrases or words that uh
[18:54] that might be a little bit rough but to
[18:57] the world our love for Christ is ugly
[19:01] if I'll think about that a little bit I
[19:03] got a few um but uh if you really think
[19:07] about it our true love affair with
[19:08] Christ to the world is repulsive it's
[19:10] ugly uh they don't like it though they
[19:13] think it's a little bit extreme or maybe
[19:14] they'll think that it doesn't kind of it
[19:16] doesn't match what we see and uh isn't
[19:18] necessary and as soon as you deviate
[19:21] your passion and your Zeal and your
[19:22] desire away from Christ and you put it
[19:24] into the Optics of things you put it in
[19:26] the pretense of things or the social
[19:27] structure of things you're leaving your
[19:30] first love and even though it might seem
[19:32] to be in the pattern of what the
[19:34] Christian church should be in and though
[19:35] it may seem like well this is what we do
[19:37] as Christians you're one step closer to
[19:39] deception and where that ended up was in
[19:42] the condition that allowed Us in church
[19:44] where they're completely deceived about
[19:46] their condition
[19:47] and completely lukewarm
[19:50] and I'd like you to think about that in
[19:52] your own life
[19:54] how that we make decisions and conduct
[19:56] ourselves weighing more carefully what
[19:58] other people think about us other than
[20:00] what God thinks about us
[20:02] and how by extension we're often doing
[20:04] things and I think this is true uh uh I
[20:07] I I I'll say it I just I feel like to
[20:09] say it this way one of the greatest
[20:11] pressures on sisters
[20:13] isn't in how they present themselves to
[20:16] men but the competition and how they
[20:19] present themselves to each other
[20:21] and the focus and the measuring stick
[20:23] isn't how do I please my husband or how
[20:25] do I dress for my husband or how do I am
[20:27] I dress pleasing to the Lord but it's
[20:29] being measured by the reflections and
[20:32] people around and there's an overt
[20:34] pressure to measure up to what everyone
[20:36] else is doing
[20:39] I hope just even by referencing that it
[20:41] can attack that condemnation that comes
[20:44] from the pretense of things against the
[20:46] young sisters and sisters because
[20:47] there's so much comparison that goes on
[20:50] and now brother Branham says in the
[20:52] church age book is we're kind of picking
[20:53] up on the phrase that party says Ah it
[20:55] all adds up that they're complacent then
[20:57] he makes this statement this is
[20:58] remarkable to me compare this 20th
[21:00] century Church to the first century
[21:01] Church go ahead do that
[21:03] where's the power where is the love
[21:06] where is the purified church that
[21:08] withstood sin and walked with faith
[21:10] toward Jesus where is the unity now
[21:13] brother Brandon identifies the false
[21:14] Unity the coming together the spirit of
[21:16] Balaam and everyone come together it
[21:18] doesn't matter your backgrounds and how
[21:19] when he preaches you 19 sign and time
[21:21] and the time and it's the uniting time
[21:23] he's saying if this is a time of unity
[21:25] this is a time of uniting but there's a
[21:27] false uniting and there's a false Unity
[21:30] that they're trying to bring the church
[21:31] under so when he says where's the unity
[21:33] he can show you the false Unity the
[21:36] false love the false Unity the the
[21:38] pretense he can show you all that but
[21:40] he's saying where's the real power
[21:42] where's the real love where's the
[21:44] purified Church where is the unity he
[21:46] says you can't find it
[21:47] and this is the statement I think is so
[21:49] remarkable this church has all it needs
[21:52] as it says in Revelations chapter 3
[21:55] why were they crying out for more of God
[21:57] in the book of Acts as though they
[21:59] didn't have it all
[22:01] right and yet they had far more than
[22:02] they have today
[22:04] they have they had far more than they
[22:06] have today
[22:08] that's a remarkable statement isn't it
[22:10] he's he's saying that in he's drawing
[22:14] this from the scripture then in the book
[22:16] of Acts with what they had received they
[22:18] wanted more
[22:20] and this is no disrespect to what they
[22:22] had it's not like yeah you know day of
[22:24] Pentecost was cool and you know healing
[22:26] is great and all these signs and wonders
[22:28] wonders are awesome but we want more no
[22:30] they just the more they experienced it
[22:32] they never got full of it
[22:34] they wanted more they wanted to be have
[22:36] they wanted they had a Zeal for it why
[22:39] are they crying out for more of God in
[22:40] the book of Acts as though they didn't
[22:42] have it all when they had more than what
[22:44] we had to have today or the church he's
[22:46] talking about the layout to see in
[22:47] church
[22:48] and what I liked about the attitude is
[22:51] that the believer
[22:53] ought to want more
[22:55] that even the book of Acts isn't looking
[22:57] at things as oh this is we have
[22:58] everything we have it all Let's uh let's
[23:01] just settle down on this no there ought
[23:03] to be a Zeal and a passion for more I
[23:06] loved how brother Andrew when he was
[23:07] given that trustee report on all the the
[23:10] the uh updates that have been taking
[23:12] place over the last month
[23:13] I I said as Believers that we ought to
[23:16] have a bias towards growth and I believe
[23:19] that ought to exists within us as an
[23:20] assembly that we ought to have a bias
[23:22] towards more people being saved we ought
[23:24] to have a buyers to the Lord reaching
[23:26] out and restoring those who should be in
[23:29] the house of God and we ought to have a
[23:30] bias towards that uh we ought not maybe
[23:33] to get in our minds and say well well
[23:34] just to be a handful and it's just going
[23:36] to be a few and as it was in the days of
[23:38] Noah and so we just want eight of us and
[23:40] and kind of have a bias towards
[23:42] dwindling down to nothing but we ought
[23:44] to have a bias towards growth and it
[23:46] that we ought to have the same bias in
[23:48] our own lives that that we want to see
[23:50] progress we want to see growth if it
[23:52] feels like it's
[23:54] um awesome today I want it more awesome
[23:55] or tomorrow I want things to increase
[23:57] and to grow and he's identifying this as
[24:00] something that's lacking in the
[24:02] laodicean age he says but it was there
[24:04] in the original Church
[24:06] but by the time it becomes a church age
[24:08] and I'm just going to throw this out
[24:10] there it becomes a church age once it
[24:12] loses its step
[24:15] so when we talk about the first church
[24:17] there's the first church that's
[24:18] inaugurated on the day of Pentecost but
[24:20] then there's also a first church which
[24:22] is the first church of the church ages
[24:24] and that one there's already a complaint
[24:25] against
[24:28] and what began as a failure to continue
[24:30] in perfect love
[24:32] results in not even wanting any more of
[24:34] God
[24:35] so Revelations 3 19 says as many as I
[24:38] love and I hope this isn't too hard of a
[24:40] turn for you as many as I love I rebuke
[24:43] and chasten be zealous therefore and
[24:46] repent
[24:51] he's encouraging the Zeal because they
[24:55] were lukewarm
[24:56] so that's how he addresses the
[24:58] lukewarmness have some passion have some
[25:00] care
[25:01] quit being indifferent have this an
[25:05] interest and a desire be zealous
[25:07] therefore and the first steps of your
[25:09] zealousness he's saying is repent
[25:12] but I want to focus on the first phrase
[25:15] as many as I love
[25:17] he preface if I could say before he has
[25:20] a call to action and as he's concluded
[25:22] his correction he prefaces the call to
[25:24] action with love
[25:27] this is this is not rejection
[25:30] this is not this is this is not him
[25:33] coming down even harder this is
[25:35] affirmation
[25:37] God knows how to discourage Us in the
[25:39] wrong things and encourage Us in the
[25:41] right things and after he has been
[25:44] honest and led with no compliment
[25:45] because there was none and so he wasn't
[25:48] just going to make it up so there
[25:49] there's your idea there should be no
[25:51] pretense there should be honesty I think
[25:53] that's one of the things that keeps so
[25:55] many people Bound in their weaknesses
[25:57] and their mistakes is they manipulate
[26:00] quotes and and scriptures into saying
[26:03] that they're just having a positive
[26:05] confession but really all they're doing
[26:07] is trying to keep up the pretense
[26:09] and they're not honest about their
[26:11] weaknesses they're not honest about
[26:12] their condition and there is a place
[26:14] that people finally come to where
[26:16] they've had enough and they don't want
[26:17] any more and they're willing to be
[26:19] honest because they don't want things to
[26:20] stay the way that it is and here is God
[26:23] he's just being honest you know what I
[26:24] don't have a good thing to say about you
[26:26] and so I'm going to tell you all the
[26:27] things I see I'm going to lay it out
[26:29] there but he says as many as I love
[26:31] he reminds them that this rebuke and
[26:34] chastening is it because he only sees
[26:36] their sins because if it was just their
[26:38] sins he could just leave them in them
[26:40] but it's because he loves them that he
[26:43] identifies it
[26:45] and so it's very he wants to frame the
[26:47] correction with love
[26:49] and before he gives them a call to
[26:50] action he wants them to understand love
[26:52] this is not rejection this is
[26:54] affirmation
[26:57] and I want to bring it to this for us
[26:59] his love is perfect
[27:01] and this is the love that John says we
[27:05] have known and believed and I want to
[27:07] say it this way this is the love that we
[27:09] need to know and trust
[27:11] we have known and believed the love that
[27:13] God has to us we know the love of God
[27:15] and we trust that love
[27:16] it's not believing it in the sense that
[27:18] we acknowledge it or believing in it
[27:19] that we believe that it exists but we
[27:22] know and we trust this love
[27:24] and if we have been born again this is I
[27:27] want to drive this home picking it up
[27:28] from Sunday if we have been born again
[27:30] we have that perfect love
[27:33] we have it by the baptism of the Holy
[27:35] Ghost he he clarifies that he he takes
[27:38] that he goes to those efforts to connect
[27:40] those things for us and and let me say
[27:42] this when we talk about a more perfect
[27:44] union and I believe I know this might
[27:47] seem a little clunky tonight
[27:48] but I I don't mind if it is that the
[27:51] Holy Spirit can just chop it up and lay
[27:52] it all together in your heart and you
[27:54] can give him the credit for it
[27:56] but but if we are born again we've come
[27:59] into Union with Jesus Christ
[28:01] brother Brown said the word revelation
[28:02] brings the elect of God out of the world
[28:05] and into full Union with Jesus Christ
[28:08] so that's the purpose of the revelation
[28:10] of the word of God bring us out of the
[28:11] world bring us into full Union with
[28:14] Jesus Christ he says in the sermon turn
[28:16] on the light the man that's filled with
[28:18] God him and the word is one
[28:20] I love it he uses the singular verb
[28:23] him and the word is one that that's just
[28:26] how one they've become
[28:28] him in the word is one certainly it is
[28:30] it's a product of a union a union
[28:33] between God and man
[28:36] and so there is a union
[28:38] this when you when you're born again
[28:40] your soul and God locks together
[28:42] so this is where I'm wanting to and and
[28:45] I believe that uh perfecting love and
[28:47] perfecting faith carried with it this
[28:48] theme that let's acknowledge the
[28:51] Perfection of his work let's acknowledge
[28:53] the completion of it let's acknowledge
[28:55] the security of our soul let's
[28:57] acknowledge that it that we're Justified
[29:00] and he has perfected forever them that
[29:04] are Sanctified and if he's Justified you
[29:06] he's glorified you and so there's a
[29:09] present state of the believer which is
[29:10] secure and points us to the ultimate
[29:13] Perfection uh that will be that glory
[29:15] and that full righteousness radiating in
[29:17] the full Glory that he is and we ought
[29:20] to be we ought to be secure in that but
[29:22] in the in between is what we're looking
[29:23] at
[29:24] and how that we know that our soul is
[29:26] sealed but yet I realize maybe there's
[29:28] times that I do doubt there's times I am
[29:30] in the flesh there's things that I
[29:31] realize that are lacking in my faith I
[29:33] realize my love isn't abounding as much
[29:35] and that's where we see the word saying
[29:37] let God perfect that which is lacking in
[29:39] your faith Lord I believe help now my
[29:41] unbelief and there's these themes about
[29:43] well yeah I have it but I need more of
[29:46] it
[29:47] I I have it all and my soul has it all
[29:50] that that I have in my heart the
[29:52] Spoonful of the of the ocean I I don't
[29:55] need the whole ocean that's my soul and
[29:58] then and as I recognize that with them I
[29:59] saw her say yes a man that is filled
[30:01] with the Holy Ghost has come into Union
[30:03] with God
[30:05] so then if we if I could say this in the
[30:07] in between
[30:09] if we fall short of perfect love love is
[30:12] what inspires us for or toward a more
[30:15] perfect love
[30:17] love is what inspires us to a more
[30:20] perfect union
[30:22] and let me say this that acknowledging
[30:24] our imperfections
[30:26] is the basis upon which we grow
[30:29] as it was acknowledged as it was written
[30:31] in Revelations chapter 3.
[30:33] because they wouldn't acknowledge what
[30:34] they were lacking they could never
[30:36] improve
[30:37] and so acknowledging our imperfections
[30:39] is what caused what gives us the basis
[30:41] for improvement
[30:42] it's what gives us the the basis for
[30:44] growth
[30:45] if we want to just forget we just want
[30:49] to forget what we're uh our well I don't
[30:51] want to figure I don't want to work on
[30:52] that I don't want to work on that I
[30:53] don't want to work on that then you just
[30:54] stay where you are
[30:56] but if we're willing to acknowledge
[30:57] where we're weak
[30:58] if we're willing to acknowledge where we
[31:00] fall short if we're willing to measure
[31:02] ourselves by the word of God and find
[31:04] out what what is lacking what can be
[31:06] perfected what can be better That's the
[31:09] basis for improvement
[31:11] the Bible says in second Peter chapter 3
[31:13] verse 18 but grow in Grace
[31:16] and in the knowledge of our Lord and
[31:17] Savior Jesus Christ
[31:22] it's in the same chapter where he says
[31:23] that we ought to desire the sincere milk
[31:26] of the word of God that ye may grow
[31:27] thereby
[31:29] and now he's saying that we should grow
[31:30] in Grace
[31:32] and in the knowledge of our Lord and
[31:33] Savior Jesus Christ there there's
[31:35] there's a growth that takes place
[31:37] in Christ is the mystery excuse me
[31:39] Christ revealed in his own word he said
[31:41] the thing that's the matter with the
[31:42] message today
[31:44] that might need to be a little him
[31:46] because maybe he's referring to the
[31:48] people
[31:48] right but he says Those Who obtain it in
[31:51] their hearts must lay in the presence of
[31:53] the sun to get ripened
[31:56] if I could put it in my own words this
[31:58] is the part that's missing
[32:00] you can't just say God thought it
[32:02] brother Brandon spoke it I believe it
[32:03] that settles it because he says
[32:06] something that just contr that works
[32:08] against that period and says
[32:10] all right then obtain it in your hearts
[32:13] hey I believe it I obtain it my heart he
[32:16] says now lay in the presence of the Sun
[32:17] and get ripened
[32:19] he says you can pick up the message
[32:22] and then let the sun bake out all the
[32:24] greenness out of you making matured
[32:27] Christians
[32:28] this has got to be a part of our
[32:31] understanding and our experience I
[32:33] believe if we if we do not understand
[32:35] this even the most basic element there's
[32:38] always going to be a weakness that can
[32:40] be sown into you that can that could 10
[32:42] maybe a number of ways but this is the
[32:44] way I just want to present it right now
[32:46] but if you think that being saved and
[32:48] still with the Holy Ghost is kind of the
[32:50] the summation of it all and you're kind
[32:52] of harvested as a stone and you're
[32:53] putting a pile and we're just waiting to
[32:55] harvest all the rest of the stones
[32:57] then then it'll either T you'll tend to
[32:59] become complacent
[33:01] like wow what are we doing here what's
[33:04] wrong with all these knucklehead make
[33:05] Believers we need to get them all saved
[33:06] and and you kind of push it all on
[33:08] everybody else and just kind of grow a
[33:10] little bit cold a little in different
[33:11] little caustic little critical why
[33:12] because you've arrived
[33:14] right you're just a stone over there on
[33:16] the piles and where are the rest of the
[33:18] stones going to get here right and you
[33:20] feel like we're just well just we'll
[33:22] work till Jesus comes right and you're
[33:23] just waiting for the last one to come in
[33:25] and you'll get called that way
[33:28] but but the the other side to that is as
[33:31] you roll off the pile
[33:34] and you begin to doubt your experience
[33:36] and you begin to doubt whether or not
[33:38] you've been anywhere and it's kind of
[33:39] used oh well you ain't been anywhere yet
[33:41] buddy you need to get saved again and
[33:42] you need to get baptized under a 2023
[33:45] and it's just this cycle over and over
[33:47] again where your salvation is never
[33:48] secure and you're you're in this
[33:50] momentum of hopeful and anxious and not
[33:54] the right kind of hopeful you're you're
[33:56] always in the state of well I'm broken
[33:58] but I'm being healed and I kind of find
[34:00] I'm a little bit more broken than I
[34:01] thought it was and I need more healing
[34:03] than I thought I needed and and that's
[34:05] because you're not secure in what God's
[34:08] done for you
[34:09] but if you don't understand what God's
[34:12] doing for you that's where you're going
[34:14] to get cold and so those who've obtained
[34:17] the word in your hearts he's saying
[34:18] there's a there's a glory to be revealed
[34:21] in us there's an immaturity that can be
[34:23] baked out of us there there's attitude
[34:26] changes and there's perspectives that we
[34:28] can gain and there's more discernment
[34:30] that we can share there's more grace
[34:32] that we can have in acting on our
[34:34] discernment don't you believe that we
[34:36] can all grow up a little bit
[34:37] [Music]
[34:39] making matured Christians this is a
[34:42] statement that I know you know brother
[34:45] Banner says but God wants to fill every
[34:46] fiber of his church
[34:48] he wants to fill your thinking he wants
[34:51] to fill your mind he wants to fill every
[34:54] bit of you just make you completely
[34:56] totally dead to yourself or to your
[34:58] thinking
[34:59] just so surrendered in God till his
[35:02] words just living right through you
[35:05] he wants to bring you to a perfect
[35:06] surrender
[35:08] did we surrender when we knew him in the
[35:10] New Birth yes
[35:12] were we done surrendering no
[35:15] as a matter of fact there's so many of
[35:17] the scriptures in the teaching is just
[35:18] in yielding
[35:21] it's a total and complete surrender
[35:24] he says just make you completely
[35:26] dead to Yourself Dead to your thinking
[35:28] because he wants to fill your mind feel
[35:29] every bit of you feel your thinking he
[35:30] wants to fill every fiber of his church
[35:35] in Ephesians chapter 3 verses 17 to 19.
[35:39] I believe that this scripture just
[35:40] expresses a more perfect union
[35:43] as he gets gets into chapter four and
[35:46] how the gifts are given to the church
[35:48] that's speaking the truth in love we may
[35:50] grow up into him in All Things
[35:52] and that we might be fully furnished
[35:54] into what the stature and the measure of
[35:57] a perfect man
[35:58] and notice how that he writes this that
[36:00] Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith
[36:03] and so by faith we receive that that new
[36:05] birth experience and now with Christ
[36:08] abide in our hearts by faith he says
[36:10] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[36:12] love so this is something that's
[36:14] foundational to our experience we need
[36:16] to be rooted and grounded and if he
[36:17] dwells in our hearts by faith and having
[36:19] that Foundation being rooted and
[36:21] grounded in love he says may be able
[36:24] so this is now this is the continuance
[36:27] if he says that you may be able this is
[36:29] a loosening of an ability that you might
[36:32] gain the the ability that you might find
[36:35] in yourself something's working and
[36:37] something's being exercised I say well I
[36:40] I Christ has dwelled in my heart in Love
[36:42] by faith I'm rooted and grounded in love
[36:45] and now because of that I become able to
[36:48] comprehend with All Saints
[36:51] what is the breadth the length and depth
[36:54] and height
[36:55] this is this is uh this is all of it
[36:58] it's all these Dimensions the magnitude
[37:00] of it the three dimensions of it the
[37:02] height the depth and the length is to
[37:04] say let's not just be one-sided
[37:06] let's see it all let's see it for what
[37:08] it is and he says and to know the love
[37:12] of Christ they say well he dwells in My
[37:14] Heart by faith I'm rooted and grounded
[37:16] in love but with that I want to be able
[37:17] to comprehend
[37:19] the the uh these things with All Saints
[37:21] two two know the love of Christ with
[37:23] passeth knowledge
[37:25] it's almost even kind of an awkward way
[37:27] to say it
[37:28] says that ye might be filled with all
[37:30] the fullness of God
[37:32] remember he's writing to an Ephesian
[37:34] Church a church that was in a position
[37:36] to be placed a church that doesn't have
[37:38] the same complaints as the Corinthian
[37:40] Church a church that's in that Exodus
[37:41] stage where now it's not just an exodus
[37:43] but it's an intern and two it's time to
[37:46] enter in and be positionally placed he's
[37:48] talking to them about not just
[37:49] unexperienced but what that experience
[37:51] would lead us to
[37:54] Express is a more perfect union
[37:56] from a perfect Foundation to perfect
[37:58] completion
[37:59] being rooted and grounded in love you
[38:01] might be filled with all the fullness of
[38:03] God all the elements are there all the
[38:06] pieces are there
[38:08] now if you look at Philippians chapter 3
[38:13] . maybe I I sense that we're going to be
[38:15] short tonight
[38:17] uh well I I I not that I'm getting any
[38:19] taller I'm always always short I guess
[38:21] comparatively
[38:23] to certain ones uh but uh
[38:26] um I mean in length of the sermon
[38:30] I think I'm not going to be long and
[38:31] maybe it's good because as we continue
[38:32] more and more bugs will find their way
[38:34] into here
[38:35] but in Philippians chapter 3 verses 12
[38:37] to 16.
[38:39] notice what he said Paul says here not
[38:41] as though I had already attained
[38:43] either were already perfect
[38:45] now this is not Paul backing away from
[38:48] his experience
[38:52] Paul boasted of his Revelations Paul was
[38:54] not
[38:55] shy
[38:57] to express what how what he knew about
[38:59] God and how he had known him and how
[39:02] Christ had been made real to him and he
[39:04] says not that I had already attained and
[39:05] he's looking at something some
[39:07] Perfection Or Glory he says either we're
[39:09] already perfect
[39:11] but I follow after
[39:14] this is a pressing
[39:16] I chase after a goal
[39:20] I don't act as if I've already attained
[39:22] either were already perfect but I press
[39:24] I'm chasing a goal if that I may
[39:27] apprehend it that for which also I am
[39:29] apprehended of Christ Jesus
[39:31] I remember when I when I was a young
[39:33] Christian and I studied this I just was
[39:35] seeking the Lord trying to understand
[39:38] and and it's how he expresses it
[39:41] is
[39:43] I know that he knows me perfectly
[39:46] that as as I have been apprehended of by
[39:49] Christ
[39:51] I want to apprehend him equally
[39:55] that I know he knows me fully I know
[39:57] that he loves me fully I know that he
[40:00] that there is this absolute a security
[40:03] in his love but he says I I press and I
[40:07] chase this goal that I may be able to
[40:09] apprehend in the way that I am also
[40:11] apprehended
[40:13] and so if I could say this maybe if the
[40:15] risk of making you think too much as we
[40:18] close here
[40:19] but there's a difference between being
[40:21] perfect and being perfected
[40:24] and and what Paul is saying is he I
[40:27] would I could say this and please bear
[40:29] with me
[40:30] he's not saying that he's not perfect in
[40:34] the sense of his soul or his forgiveness
[40:35] or sinlessness or his justification
[40:38] but he's saying I'm not as though I was
[40:41] already perfect
[40:43] so he's saying you know there's a
[40:45] difference between being perfect and
[40:47] being perfected
[40:49] and so we are being perfected in him
[40:53] and so there is something uh we are we
[40:56] are there there's something that Paul is
[40:58] saying that when he says and I guess
[41:00] we'll just read it here further
[41:01] I'm in the race
[41:04] so I'm qualified to be perfected
[41:07] I have every right to to chase for the
[41:10] prize I have every right to reach for it
[41:13] I'm qualified I'm chosen I'm elected I'm
[41:16] secure in his love but that which has
[41:18] apprehended me now qualifies me for
[41:21] being perfected and I reach for it
[41:25] so he says Brethren I count not myself
[41:27] to have apprehended but this one thing I
[41:30] do forget in those things which are
[41:32] behind and reaching forth into those
[41:34] things which are before I press toward
[41:36] the mark for the prize of the high corn
[41:38] of God in Christ Jesus
[41:41] the mark of this age is perfection
[41:43] the mark that Paul was reaching for is
[41:45] perfection because he says neither was I
[41:47] already perfect and I do not count
[41:48] myself as apprehended this Perfection so
[41:52] the what he's reaching for
[41:54] is perfection
[41:56] if I could put it in words that are that
[41:58] suit our series The Mark is God's
[42:00] perfect love
[42:02] it is a sum of all Perfection he says
[42:04] follow after charity so when he says but
[42:06] I follow after he's falling for
[42:08] something that is perfect
[42:12] it's it's God's
[42:14] perfect knowledge it's his perfect Faith
[42:16] it's his perfect love it's the sum of
[42:18] all perfection
[42:20] the mark that Paul was reaching for was
[42:21] not to be born again
[42:24] the mark that he was reaching for was
[42:26] not to be sealed with the Holy Ghost but
[42:28] it was to enjoy the fullness of the new
[42:30] life that had been deposited into him by
[42:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[42:34] amen I don't get comfortable I don't get
[42:36] complacent I don't relax in the sense
[42:39] that I I'm not desirous of more that I I
[42:42] don't I don't slack in my understanding
[42:44] that there's more that God can reveal
[42:46] and there's more that God wants to show
[42:47] me I don't slack and understanding it
[42:49] though I could say I have perfect love
[42:51] and that he has loved me perfectly I
[42:54] recognize that I love him perfectly
[42:58] I recognize that I know imperfectly I
[43:01] recognize that I'm not always patient
[43:03] perfectly I'm not always kind perfectly
[43:05] and so he recogn he could recognize that
[43:08] where his love is perfect and it
[43:10] perfectly dwells in me that there's
[43:12] still an expression in the manifestation
[43:14] of this life on the inside of me that I
[43:17] desire to see Rise up to the top
[43:20] I I hope that I'm speaking to those who
[43:23] who are willing to acknowledge their
[43:25] weaknesses willing to acknowledge that
[43:27] they make mistakes willing to understand
[43:29] that there's more that we could grow
[43:31] into that there's more that that he has
[43:34] in store for us in his word and that we
[43:36] don't want to leave any promises left
[43:38] unfulfilled we don't want to leave we
[43:39] don't want any blessings being held back
[43:41] up in heaven that we want more from him
[43:43] that we want we want it all from him and
[43:46] that we recognize that we can be better
[43:48] Christians
[43:53] and I don't say this from a position of
[43:56] poverty
[43:58] I expressed this from a position of
[44:00] wealth
[44:01] in that we have it
[44:03] so that we're not begging for what's
[44:05] been given we recognize if this is what
[44:08] I have then I want it to I want to I
[44:10] want the benefits of it
[44:13] I know what if I don't want to live
[44:14] bound to anxiety I don't always I don't
[44:17] want to wrestle with the overwhelming
[44:19] sense of jealousy I don't always want to
[44:21] be suspicious I don't want to be succumb
[44:24] to these uh these cycles and I don't
[44:26] want to always be bound by certain
[44:28] things I believe and and I've had the
[44:30] experiences as of late where God has
[44:32] just put me in certain situations and
[44:34] counseling where I could look uh sons of
[44:37] God in the eye or I could look people in
[44:39] the eye and say I want you to know that
[44:41] God is able
[44:43] and that you don't have to live forever
[44:45] in some sort of cycle of Victory and
[44:49] defeat Victory and defeat but God's word
[44:52] is Promised total Deliverance total
[44:55] healing
[44:56] and that whether it be family strains or
[44:58] whether it be physical sickness that we
[45:00] can live above these things
[45:05] I trust that there is a desire in US
[45:08] that yes I have the Holy Ghost but with
[45:11] the scripture speaking of is not to
[45:13] resolve over and over again that you've
[45:14] been born again but to enjoy the
[45:16] fullness of that life that is inside of
[45:18] you
[45:19] to reap the benefits of the promise of
[45:23] it all the potential of it
[45:27] even in second Corinthians chapter seven
[45:29] we're talking about perfecting love and
[45:32] perfecting Faith a more perfect union he
[45:35] speaks of perfecting Holiness in the
[45:36] fear of God
[45:38] you'll find it over and over and over
[45:40] again there's just there's something
[45:42] that you look at from a Heavenly
[45:43] perspective and you say it's perfect
[45:46] but then when you flip it over from an
[45:47] Earthly perspective it's perfecting
[45:50] when we look at it from a Heavenly
[45:51] perspective complete finished it's
[45:54] already done it's over you're completely
[45:55] healed you're perfect new body theophy
[45:58] you name it it's all there from an
[45:59] eternal perspective but when you flip it
[46:01] back over it's perfecting but what is it
[46:03] leading what is it moving towards
[46:05] whatever that image is on the other side
[46:07] it's perfecting
[46:09] it's getting better brother Adam uses
[46:10] the image of the the shadow coming
[46:12] together I want you to think about those
[46:14] things in your mind we want I want you
[46:15] to think in terms of I I don't want to
[46:17] always judge Myself by this is what this
[46:19] is what's perfect and I don't have it so
[46:21] I'm then I'm not there yet that I must
[46:23] not have even begun or discourage
[46:24] yourself no flip it over you're coming
[46:26] to it
[46:27] it's perfecting so he says let us
[46:30] therefore as many as be perfect verse
[46:32] 15. let us therefore as many as be
[46:34] perfect wait what
[46:37] seems to be an odd statement but as even
[46:39] as many as art mature
[46:42] to be any mature ones amongst us if
[46:44] there be any ones that are seasoned as
[46:46] many as be perfect be thus minded and
[46:48] not knowing necessarily Paul's
[46:51] language if he's kind of saying well I'm
[46:53] not perfect but for those who are
[46:56] you should be thinking the same way I am
[46:59] he says I don't pretend to be perfect
[47:01] I press I'm pressing towards the mark
[47:03] for the prize I I I'm following after
[47:05] very very hard I'm chasing I'm pursuing
[47:08] Perfection and he says and if you are
[47:10] and I'm just kind of suggesting this
[47:12] that I don't know if Paul is saying you
[47:14] know what if you think you're perfect
[47:15] you should still be pursuing more
[47:17] perfection
[47:19] if you think you've arrived you should
[47:21] be wanting to arrive even deeper
[47:23] but I like to read it this way as many
[47:25] as are mature be thus minded
[47:28] and if anything you'd be otherwise
[47:30] minded God shall reveal even this unto
[47:32] you this is important to always be
[47:34] thirsty
[47:35] to always be hungry
[47:38] I was thinking of how that Saul
[47:42] that the sins of Saul
[47:44] he forgot what God had taken them from
[47:48] that there's a there's a there's a
[47:49] there's a danger
[47:51] for believers
[47:53] is forgetting the process
[47:57] and maybe they just look one day and
[47:58] they're like you know what
[48:00] I'm not too bad
[48:03] this is pretty good this is good stuff
[48:05] and you forget that it's been him and
[48:07] his love all along
[48:09] taking off that rough spots Tim that's
[48:12] blessing it's him that's growing it's
[48:13] him that's encouraging
[48:15] so he says let's keep this mind and then
[48:17] verse 16.
[48:19] this to me is so so powerful
[48:21] nevertheless where unto we have already
[48:24] attained
[48:25] let us walk by the same rule
[48:28] let us mind the same thing
[48:32] in other words
[48:33] don't lose the ground You've Won
[48:37] to whatever extent we've already
[48:39] obtained
[48:40] as Paul is saying I press toward the
[48:42] Mark I'm reaching forth I'm following
[48:43] after if he was to say forget those
[48:45] things which are behind I'll leave them
[48:46] behind I'm pressing towards I'm going
[48:48] forward he then says if as many as be
[48:50] mature think this way
[48:53] and he's this language to what extent
[48:56] we've already attained mind the same
[48:59] rule lest we lose what we've won
[49:03] don't give up the ground you presently
[49:05] possess
[49:06] that's what happens when you stand still
[49:08] do you realize as Christians there's no
[49:11] emergency break there's no Park
[49:14] right I can't just say man this has just
[49:16] been exhausting we're just going to hold
[49:17] right here
[49:19] and you may feel that you are but if you
[49:21] ever looked up in the spiritual stream
[49:22] things are just passing right by you
[49:25] because you can't stand still in Christ
[49:27] there's always some slippage there's
[49:30] always some some moving back there's
[49:33] always something that's being lost he
[49:35] says to the extent you've gained to the
[49:36] extent you've moved forward if you
[49:38] possess don't get slacked don't get
[49:40] complacent lest you lose lose what you
[49:44] already possess
[49:45] and so I expressed it in the sense to
[49:47] say that I would never want to diminish
[49:49] the glory that's been revealed in you I
[49:51] would never want to diminish the
[49:52] victories that Christ has accomplished
[49:54] in you I would never want to make the
[49:56] mistake of saying something that would
[49:58] tarnish the power of God that resides
[50:00] within us by the baptism of the Holy
[50:02] Ghost I say whatever Perfection you
[50:05] presently possess do not become
[50:07] complacent with it
[50:09] but walk by the same rule
[50:12] that I press on
[50:14] that I go forward
[50:16] that there's more
[50:18] if you could hold this scripture in your
[50:20] hearts
[50:22] over the next couple weeks
[50:24] I'm looking forward to the ministry on
[50:26] this Sunday brother Aaron Oglesby
[50:28] Wednesday brother uh Reginald been David
[50:31] Platt ministering but in in the interim
[50:35] think about the scripture this has been
[50:37] at the core of perfect love for me Jesus
[50:41] said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord
[50:43] thy God with all thy heart
[50:46] with all thy soul
[50:48] with all thy mind
[50:51] if I could say Lord I love you with my
[50:53] soul
[50:54] that there's a love that's so real in my
[50:57] soul for you
[50:58] but Lord I Want to Love You Not only
[51:00] just with My Soul but with my mind with
[51:02] my heart
[51:03] with an entire love
[51:07] and uh Lord I Want My Heart
[51:10] my soul is fused my soul is locked
[51:13] together it's one but Lord I want my
[51:15] whole heart
[51:17] to be United With Your Love
[51:19] I want it to be see I I want whatever
[51:22] whatever that condition of my soul is in
[51:25] Lord that that my soul because you know
[51:28] when you tap into that the peace you
[51:29] have
[51:30] you know the joy you have you know those
[51:32] moments when you have the right response
[51:34] and you're like hey
[51:38] look what I did I said the right thing
[51:41] right that that's what's inside of you
[51:43] coming out
[51:46] and he said Lord I want more of that
[51:49] I want to increase I want it to grow
[51:52] I I'll share with you the this theme I
[51:54] know I mentioned it before but and this
[51:56] is it's a whole series 2024 could be on
[51:58] this that he's redeemed our souls and we
[52:01] know he's going to redeem our body but
[52:02] there's also Redemption for our spirit
[52:04] Saul is made perfect by the baptism Holy
[52:06] Ghost the body is going to be
[52:07] transformed in the resurrection and the
[52:09] Rapture but what he's doing now is
[52:11] Transforming Our Minds there is a
[52:13] Redemption for your heart there's a
[52:15] Redemption for your thinking there's a
[52:16] Redemption for your character isn't that
[52:19] great right
[52:21] some of us have I have have more Walt
[52:24] Disney character than we do Christ
[52:25] Christ character right so I'm so glad
[52:27] he's still perfecting it
[52:29] that there's still a perfecton in my
[52:31] character that's taking place doesn't
[52:32] take away from that which is in my soul
[52:34] doesn't tarnish the glory of the new
[52:36] body that I'm going to have so where I
[52:38] exist right now is a is a Deliverance of
[52:41] and a Redemption of my spirit
[52:44] from all the scars and complexes sewn
[52:46] into me but by my own rebellion and
[52:48] stubbornness all the things that have
[52:50] been sold into me by living all the
[52:51] temptation all the failures everything
[52:53] that's mixed up and muddied up in this
[52:55] human Garden God is pruning God is
[52:58] growing God Is So and God is working and
[53:01] cultivating not your soul it's perfect
[53:03] but he's doing it to your heart
[53:05] and why does he do it to your heart
[53:07] because he wants you to love them with
[53:09] your whole heart
[53:11] and the more that he can heal your heart
[53:13] the more that he could deal with the
[53:14] things in our minds the more that he can
[53:15] address the things of our past the more
[53:17] that our heart gets freed up to love him
[53:19] with our whole hearts
[53:21] and if I could say that's what perfect
[53:23] love means to me is not not that I know
[53:26] he loves me with the perfect love I know
[53:28] I have perfect love in my soul but I
[53:31] know that for him that only my whole
[53:34] heart will do
[53:36] that unless he has my whole heart it's
[53:38] not enough for him
[53:41] and that he loves me with the kind of
[53:43] love that I I thank God for my Boaz I
[53:46] thank God for my redeemer I thank God
[53:48] for his jealous love
[53:51] forth that he's he's not willing to
[53:53] leave me with doors closed
[53:57] but he wants all of it
[53:59] and though I may not always act in that
[54:01] interest that he has I confess tonight
[54:04] that I want him to have it all
[54:05] [Music]
[54:07] brother Branham in the Statue of a
[54:09] perfect man
[54:10] and I read this because I want to
[54:12] address this just in a more perfect
[54:14] union
[54:17] our souls are sealed
[54:21] and and that's it Brethren talks about
[54:22] it's already in their Eighth Day
[54:23] condition so in that sense it's already
[54:25] back to Garden of Eden
[54:30] and yet I could express that it's
[54:33] perfectly fused with Christ
[54:35] but there's a more perfect union I can
[54:37] share with him
[54:39] I just I left these things out I don't
[54:42] know if I'll find place for him but
[54:44] remember brother man teaches in the
[54:45] church's book The Harmony that existed
[54:47] between the Son and the father
[54:48] that Harmony exists now
[54:50] in the bride she only does
[54:54] what he wants them to
[54:56] and so all of us right measuring
[54:59] ourselves by that could say I must not
[55:02] be
[55:03] bride
[55:04] right I guess maybe maybe some of us
[55:06] just justify that everything I've done
[55:10] including that bloody lip I just gave
[55:11] you he wanted me to do are not the Fist
[55:15] of the righteous moved by the Lord
[55:17] and maybe we have a way of just
[55:19] constantly justifying everything we've
[55:21] ever said and done but don't we
[55:22] recognize that in the template she has
[55:25] thus thus saith the Lord or keep still
[55:28] and you realize how fidgety we get
[55:31] right how are our our human Spirits get
[55:35] nervous and fidgety and we're not
[55:38] keeping still
[55:39] because there's an image of Harmony that
[55:41] exists between Christ uh the Son and the
[55:44] father that must now exist between
[55:45] Christ and his bride so then I say I am
[55:48] in Union with Christ but I'm Desiring a
[55:50] more perfect union
[55:52] I'm designing that my life can measure
[55:54] up more with what the word says of me
[55:56] that I want I want to experience that
[55:59] I believe you are experiencing that let
[56:02] me say this you are experiencing that
[56:04] has not God been good to us
[56:06] are we not growing are we not growing in
[56:09] his grace aren't you grateful for what
[56:10] God has done for you that right now
[56:12] tonight you can look where you are right
[56:14] now and whatever time period you have to
[56:16] go back to say I'm not what I was then
[56:19] then his word is still impacting me his
[56:22] word is still uh is still moving Me
[56:26] Maybe that's how I should have preached
[56:28] it tonight can we not thank God that
[56:31] this Union is becoming more perfect do
[56:33] we not see his grace in our lives
[56:36] has he not been good to us
[56:38] are we not falling more in love with him
[56:41] isn't he sweeter today than he was
[56:43] before isn't this message greater than
[56:46] it ever been before
[56:48] his word for awesome than it's ever been
[56:50] before
[56:52] because it's a more perfect union
[56:55] it's alive it's living let's pause for a
[56:57] moment and recognize it's doing what he
[57:00] said it would do it's doing exactly what
[57:03] he said it would do
[57:05] praise be to God
[57:09] it's a more perfect union
[57:12] therefore I'm not discouraged
[57:14] that it hasn't been what it should be
[57:17] because I know that it's not what it
[57:19] used to be
[57:21] and it's more perfect
[57:24] and then I want to say this because
[57:25] Brother Band is going to use it as an
[57:27] example
[57:33] the love of a man to his wife
[57:36] they are united and I was looking at
[57:39] this this week how through the marriage
[57:41] vows and Jesus even signed the two the
[57:43] two are now one flesh Paul refers to it
[57:46] and as spoken of Adam in Genesis chapter
[57:48] 2. and so we speak so highly of the love
[57:52] that we have that ought to exist between
[57:54] a man and a wife
[57:55] and there's so much room for the devil
[57:57] to work in that when things when
[57:59] expectations aren't being met and you're
[58:01] thinking are you thinking it's a little
[58:02] late on a Wednesday night to bring this
[58:04] up
[58:05] because that's what I'm thinking
[58:07] but this is what um there's things that
[58:10] I feel led to preach on when it comes to
[58:11] love that address these things in our
[58:14] marriages
[58:15] because and even it's just relationships
[58:18] and it's like well there's he ever met
[58:21] the person who's always talking about
[58:22] their husband it's he's perfect he never
[58:24] makes a mistake and instead of getting
[58:26] more confidence in the husband you're
[58:27] losing confidence in the wife
[58:30] ever happened to anybody
[58:32] okay I see all the the eyebrows being
[58:35] raised like
[58:38] the neighbor in the apartment next door
[58:41] and so there's some that speak in a way
[58:44] that almost just seems like
[58:47] got to be kidding me nobody loves
[58:48] somebody that much right
[58:50] and and we say well love covers a
[58:52] multitude of multitude of sins you're
[58:54] like well we need to quantify what
[58:55] multitude is because I think the quote
[58:57] has been far exceeded here
[59:00] but we If we're honest with ourselves we
[59:02] realize that that love if we're honestly
[59:06] Chuck we realize that I mean okay I'll
[59:08] just say me
[59:09] I know I love my wife and I know she
[59:12] doesn't think I'm perfect
[59:14] but I know I don't always express it
[59:18] the way that it is
[59:20] my the way that I the way that I would
[59:22] want to show my love
[59:24] it's not always it's not always
[59:25] expressive of what it is now there's a
[59:28] lot of reasons for that if you want to
[59:29] get me on the couch we can start working
[59:30] through them
[59:32] but the point I'm trying to make is that
[59:35] should not lead us to conclude the
[59:38] love's not there and I'm not trying to
[59:40] keep marriage counsel from the pulpit
[59:42] my wife or even trying to repair our
[59:44] marriage I'm just using this as an
[59:46] example because it's safe
[59:49] Elliot for instance if you got married
[59:53] there's something to there's does this
[59:55] make sense
[59:57] that if we start to measure the love
[59:59] then we say oh well and that if you love
[1:00:03] then you wouldn't do this if you love
[1:00:05] you wouldn't do that but yet we do love
[1:00:09] right and and we realize there's
[1:00:11] something that that it's not perfect yet
[1:00:14] so I want to share this to us who are in
[1:00:16] relationships whether it be parent to
[1:00:18] children
[1:00:20] because when we begin to have children
[1:00:21] we had never done it before
[1:00:23] so there's never a point where it's like
[1:00:25] okay I've been there done that you say
[1:00:27] well I've got one two two is fine and I
[1:00:29] think they say once you have three it's
[1:00:30] all the same no no it's all new Every
[1:00:32] Time
[1:00:34] right you're always living in a
[1:00:35] different context maybe you could have
[1:00:37] your first four when you're in your 20s
[1:00:39] then the next four when you're in the
[1:00:40] 40s you're different right things change
[1:00:43] it's never the same and so we're you're
[1:00:46] new at this at every stage you're new so
[1:00:49] the the way the love is expressed to the
[1:00:51] child isn't always perfect
[1:00:53] but what I want to say is let's have a
[1:00:56] vision that'll become more perfect
[1:00:59] and that in our marriages yeah it may
[1:01:01] not be a perfect marriage but I want a
[1:01:03] more perfect union
[1:01:05] I may not be able to say oh or it may
[1:01:07] not be able to be said of me oh man
[1:01:09] never makes a mistake he's just perfect
[1:01:11] everything's right everything's perfect
[1:01:13] but if it can't be said I want to be
[1:01:16] more perfect I want a more perfect union
[1:01:19] so there's a template for this for our
[1:01:21] relationships and one thing that I'm
[1:01:23] grateful for
[1:01:24] and and I and I like I say this way
[1:01:28] that I do
[1:01:31] I I love I love Christ I want to know
[1:01:34] more
[1:01:35] I want to have a greater relationship
[1:01:37] with him
[1:01:38] but it seems as if every every time I
[1:01:40] come to that
[1:01:42] you you pierce once you get past the
[1:01:44] resistance you realize I do that by how
[1:01:46] I treat others
[1:01:49] I do that I love him more about how I
[1:01:51] love my wife
[1:01:52] I love him more by how I treat my
[1:01:54] children I love him more about how I
[1:01:56] treat you
[1:01:58] that that's that's how I fall more in
[1:02:00] love with him
[1:02:01] that's how that's how it works because
[1:02:03] then if I could do that what's what's
[1:02:05] the other person feeling his love and
[1:02:08] what do they do they fall more in love
[1:02:09] with him
[1:02:11] it's not this fake layout decision
[1:02:14] contemporary
[1:02:16] charismatic love that's expressed in in
[1:02:20] the churches today it's something real
[1:02:23] and brother Brown says this in the
[1:02:24] Statue of a perfect man
[1:02:28] there's not a person in here that loves
[1:02:29] God
[1:02:31] but wants to become more like Christ
[1:02:37] he says it's laid out here and he's
[1:02:38] talking about the Statue of a perfect
[1:02:39] man every Christian
[1:02:41] I'm an old veteran look at brother and
[1:02:43] sister kid here
[1:02:44] they're probably the oldest in the
[1:02:46] building but if I'd ask them what is
[1:02:47] your heart's desire it'd be closer to
[1:02:50] God
[1:02:51] is that yours
[1:02:53] closer to God
[1:02:55] I think if we if you if you thought
[1:02:57] something else you might find that
[1:02:59] that's that's what leads you to that
[1:03:01] closer to God
[1:03:03] when you learn of Christ there's
[1:03:04] something about him that's so loving you
[1:03:07] just try to get right into him
[1:03:10] now
[1:03:11] if you if you're if you're not wanting
[1:03:13] to get right into them you need to start
[1:03:14] you want to get to know him more
[1:03:16] but there's something you learn of
[1:03:18] Christ or something about him that's so
[1:03:19] love and you try to get right into him
[1:03:21] then he says excuse this expression
[1:03:23] I told my wife here not long ago both
[1:03:26] getting old and I said to her
[1:03:28] I said do you love me like you used to
[1:03:31] she said I certainly do
[1:03:34] and I said you know
[1:03:36] I love you so much
[1:03:38] until I'd like to take you and pull you
[1:03:40] inside of me
[1:03:42] so we could just be really
[1:03:44] be one
[1:03:46] more
[1:03:49] not that they're not one
[1:03:51] not that they not that they aren't in
[1:03:53] love but there was something where he's
[1:03:55] like I just wish I could pull you inside
[1:03:57] of me so we could be more one
[1:04:01] now there's a more perfect union
[1:04:03] and he says now multiply that by a
[1:04:05] hundred million
[1:04:07] and then you'll find out how that the
[1:04:09] believer
[1:04:10] Who falls in love with Christ wants to
[1:04:12] get into him because it's a love
[1:04:17] there's so many things
[1:04:21] that have clouded our vision
[1:04:24] and have only muted
[1:04:26] it's never it's never done away with it
[1:04:29] could never put it out but it's muted it
[1:04:33] and even that's what the wonderlust and
[1:04:36] wonder lost was trying to do is take
[1:04:38] away that little the smut
[1:04:41] that's gotten on it
[1:04:43] and that's kept the passion from being
[1:04:46] free
[1:04:47] I say strive for a more perfect union
[1:04:52] so how could it be more perfect it can
[1:04:55] be closer to perfection than it was
[1:04:57] before could we stand together tonight
