[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] First, uh, Brother Aaron called me this
[0:06] morning and he said, "Make sure you
[0:09] greet the congregation for me." He said
[0:12] he's got some rest, but if I know
[0:13] Brother Aaron, he wants to be right
[0:15] here, right among you, and and doing the
[0:18] work that the Lord's ordained him to
[0:19] work to do. I appreciate Brother Aaron.
[0:22] um he and I met just a few months ago
[0:27] and we struck up a a nice friendship. If
[0:31] you don't know who I am, um brother said
[0:34] my name is Daniel Evans. I am actually
[0:37] from Arizona originally. I moved to
[0:40] Jeffersonville, Indiana about 17 years
[0:42] ago. I worked for Voice of God
[0:44] Recordings for 14 years. And my role
[0:48] there is I was director of public
[0:49] relations. And my job was among other
[0:53] things of course to lift up brother
[0:55] Bram's message to the people. And one of
[0:58] the things that I did was anytime that
[1:01] someone would call Voice of God and they
[1:03] would want to talk to a minister or they
[1:05] would they would have questions,
[1:08] those phone calls would usually come to
[1:11] me. And it was everything from
[1:16] that uh we believe I believe brother
[1:18] Bram's a false prophet. He said this
[1:20] this and this and this to a husband and
[1:23] wife's in a tiff to to many many things.
[1:27] You can imagine how many how many
[1:28] different things that came in. But I was
[1:31] honored to do it. Um, and uh, the Lord
[1:35] led me to move back home to Arizona. And
[1:40] it's been almost exactly one year that I
[1:44] resigned my position at Voice of God.
[1:46] And I've moved here to Arizona. And uh,
[1:49] I was speaking at a minister's meeting
[1:51] not too long ago. And I was talking
[1:53] about the subject was how can we get in
[1:56] one mind and one accord?
[1:59] and and I was chosen to speak and I was
[2:02] talking about that the way to get in one
[2:04] mind and one accord is to have one
[2:06] purpose.
[2:08] So as I ministered on that afterwards
[2:10] there was a break and and brother Aaron
[2:12] came up to me and he introduced himself
[2:16] and he said that he said I think the
[2:19] Lord wants us to fellowship
[2:23] and so so um we started talking and we
[2:28] struck up a friendship
[2:30] and uh if if you know my background and
[2:34] you know brother Aaron's background
[2:35] there's probably no two more different
[2:38] people that come from different areas of
[2:41] the message than brother Aaron McGary
[2:44] and brother Daniel Evans. But the Lord
[2:47] brought us together because I believe
[2:50] that we have a common purpose.
[2:53] And that common purpose is not to
[2:55] promote a narrative or not to promote a
[2:59] doctrine, not to not to take one side or
[3:03] take the other side. I think many of us
[3:06] don't fit in this box or in this box or
[3:10] in this box. And I think that this room
[3:13] probably has quite a few of those people
[3:14] that don't fit in those boxes.
[3:17] And that's what the enemy tries to to
[3:18] do. He tries to he tries to force us
[3:21] into these boxes. And in doing that, it
[3:24] separates
[3:26] the brethren.
[3:28] And with brother Aaron and and me and
[3:32] talking, I thought, man, this brother
[3:34] has has the same vision that I do. And
[3:37] that vision is to create or to foster a
[3:42] relationship, a personal relationship
[3:44] between the believer and the Lord.
[3:49] And that's the that's the mission. That
[3:52] should be the focus of every minister.
[3:54] Not just every minister, every parent.
[3:58] Every Christian, every deacon, every
[4:00] trustee, every lay person, every
[4:04] Christian in this world should have that
[4:07] focus and that is to help people have
[4:10] that relationship between God and man.
[4:17] There's a there's a Chinese proverb that
[4:19] says, "If you give a man a fish, you
[4:22] feed him today. But if you teach a man
[4:25] to fish, you feed him the rest of his
[4:27] life. And friends, we can give a little
[4:31] bit of advice. Say, "Don't do this or do
[4:34] this." And parents, as parents, we can
[4:37] point our kids in the right direction
[4:39] and tell them, "No, stay away from this
[4:41] group of kids over here and, you know,
[4:43] fellowship with this group of kids." But
[4:45] until that child or until that person
[4:48] has that relationship with Christ, that
[4:51] person will be reliant on that minister
[4:53] or on that parent or on that husband or
[4:55] on that wife. And that is the role of a
[4:58] true minister to build that relationship
[5:02] and then step back. Always be there for
[5:06] the person, but step back and let that
[5:09] that person have that relationship with
[5:12] Christ. So often though, and we see it,
[5:17] we separate ourselves on doctrinal
[5:20] lines.
[5:22] And brother Brandham came and and his
[5:24] message was come out of that. Don't do
[5:27] that. Come out of that. And he and he
[5:31] did a wonderful job. He brought this
[5:33] message.
[5:34] And then friends, what happens is human
[5:37] nature, we have fallen into that same
[5:41] trap.
[5:43] and it becomes if you're not part of my
[5:45] group, if you don't believe it like I
[5:48] believe it, then you're out.
[5:52] There's a um there's a book that Brother
[5:55] Brandham wrote, the only book he ever
[5:57] wrote and it's a masterpiece. He
[5:59] finished it and it got printed just
[6:02] before he passed away in 1965.
[6:05] That book is called an exposition of the
[6:08] seven church ages. It's beautiful. It's
[6:11] got all the big doctrines in brother
[6:13] Brandham's message from serpent seed to
[6:15] baptism to the godhead to to these these
[6:18] beautiful messages that brother Brandham
[6:21] preached he condensed them into a book
[6:25] called an exposition of the seven church
[6:26] ages and it builds starts with with
[6:30] Ephesus and it goes all the way up to
[6:32] Leodysa and it goes all the way up and
[6:34] he builds this beautiful masterpiece of
[6:37] this book and then friends He closes the
[6:41] book. This is his masterpiece. And and
[6:44] he he he has it here and he wants people
[6:47] to read it. And he closes the book with
[6:50] with this statement. And I'm going to
[6:52] read it off of my phone. And brother, if
[6:54] you could give me that um church age
[6:57] book quote.
[6:59] I uh I turned on my my phone and and
[7:02] there's a text from brother Aaron and he
[7:03] says, "I'm praying for you."
[7:06] Thank you, brother Aaron. If you're if
[7:08] you're um tuned in,
[7:11] the end of an exposition of the seven
[7:14] church ages.
[7:16] Brother Brandham says this, "Not for one
[7:18] moment do I bring a message to the
[7:21] people that they may follow me
[7:24] or join my church or start some
[7:27] fellowship and organization. I have
[7:30] never done that and will not do that
[7:33] now." Amen.
[7:34] Now remember this is a very very
[7:36] important man talking.
[7:39] This is if we believe brother Brandham
[7:41] to be what he made us made it out for
[7:45] him to be. This is that seventh angel
[7:49] that was to come. This is that prophet
[7:51] of Malachi 4 that was to come to turn
[7:54] the hearts of the children back to that
[7:56] of the Pentecostal fathers.
[7:58] Amen.
[7:59] And he says this. I have no He says
[8:01] this. I have never done that and will
[8:03] not do that now. I have no interest in
[8:05] those things. But I do have an interest
[8:08] in the things of God and people. And if
[8:11] I can accomplish just one thing, I will
[8:14] be satisfied.
[8:16] That's a very, very important statement.
[8:18] If I can accomplish just one thing, I
[8:20] will be satisfied. In all of this
[8:22] ministry that God has given me, if I can
[8:24] accomplish one thing,
[8:27] I will be satisfied.
[8:31] That one thing is to see established a
[8:34] true spiritual relationship between God
[8:37] and men wherein men become new creations
[8:41] in Christ filled with his spirit and
[8:44] live according to his word.
[8:47] I would invite and plead and warn all to
[8:50] hear his voice at this time and yield
[8:51] their lives completely to him even as I
[8:54] trust in my heart that I have given my
[8:57] all to him. God bless you and may his
[9:00] coming rejoice in your heart. What a
[9:03] beautiful thing that brother Brandham
[9:06] can close out his ministry. Like I said,
[9:09] this got printed right before his death
[9:12] that he can close out his ministry with
[9:14] those beautiful words that if he can see
[9:17] established a relationship between God
[9:20] and men, then he would be satisfied.
[9:24] I um
[9:26] I have some friends
[9:28] dear friends of mine that uh few years
[9:32] ago they decided that they didn't
[9:33] believe Brother Bram's message anymore.
[9:35] They saw they saw they they went to the
[9:38] websites and we know what they are. They
[9:40] went to the websites and they started
[9:41] reading these things and and it really
[9:44] it polluted their mind
[9:46] and they decided that no that this was
[9:51] false.
[9:53] So,
[9:55] and and like I said, they're they're
[9:56] dear friends of mine. So, not too long
[9:59] ago, I felt it on my heart to go visit
[10:02] them.
[10:04] And so, it was a long drive. And on my
[10:07] way there, my thoughts were, Lord, do
[10:11] you have something that you want me to
[10:12] tell them that will bring them them
[10:15] back? Or maybe you have something for
[10:19] me.
[10:22] And and I thought, you know, we always
[10:24] get so arrogant. Lord, Lord, I'm going
[10:26] to go there and I'm going to tell them
[10:27] this, this, this, and this, and that's
[10:29] going to change their mind through my
[10:30] knowledge. And and friends, it never
[10:32] works that way.
[10:34] So, so I go there and it was such a nice
[10:38] time of fellowship and such a a nice
[10:41] time of love.
[10:44] And then it got late at night and uh
[10:48] they were ready to go back home to their
[10:51] house and they were we were
[10:52] fellowshipping the place and I I opened
[10:55] the door and I said,
[10:58] "Y'all know me. You know what my job's
[11:01] been for all these years?
[11:06] I could be a resource to you. What
[11:09] questions do you have about Brother
[11:12] Brandham's message?" I said, 'We know
[11:14] each other. We've known each other for a
[11:16] long time. Ask me what these qu ask me
[11:18] these questions that you have on your
[11:20] heart.
[11:22] And
[11:25] there was a little bit of a wall that
[11:26] went up, but because of that spirit that
[11:29] was present, that sweetness of the Holy
[11:33] Spirit,
[11:34] wall came down and they started asking
[11:37] questions.
[11:40] Now, some of these questions I was able
[11:43] to answer answer easily. Some of the
[11:45] questions I wasn't able to answer.
[11:47] That's not the point of the story.
[11:50] So, right before they left and we talked
[11:52] for maybe an hour about these things.
[11:55] The kids uh they put the kids in the
[11:57] other room. They were watching a movie
[11:59] and it was just me and the husband and
[12:02] the wife.
[12:04] And they made this statement. The wife,
[12:07] the sister made this statement. She
[12:09] said, "You know, we've asked a family."
[12:12] She said, "We've asked a pastor
[12:16] about these questions
[12:19] and ask other believers." And the answer
[12:23] was always the same. It was always
[12:25] defensive
[12:28] and just believe it.
[12:31] Well, that didn't work for them.
[12:33] They said they were always afraid. The
[12:36] people we asked were always afraid that
[12:38] brother Brandham was wrong.
[12:41] So they they wouldn't go there. They
[12:42] said, "But but you you go there." And if
[12:45] you don't know, you just say you don't
[12:46] know. Why aren't you afraid?
[12:51] And I said, "I don't know, but I'm not.
[12:54] I'm not afraid at all."
[12:57] So they left and and uh I got on my
[13:00] knees and I started praying
[13:04] and I said, "Lord, that question that
[13:07] you asked,
[13:09] I'm not afraid. I'm not worried about
[13:12] those things." I said, "Lord, I don't
[13:15] care if he was right or or wrong in
[13:18] these things that he was saying. I don't
[13:20] care." And and and as I was praying, I I
[13:24] prayed and I got tired and then I
[13:28] crawled into bed and I kept praying and
[13:30] I just prayed myself to sleep.
[13:33] And then I woke up the next morning
[13:36] and I was still praying
[13:39] and I was I was like, "Lord, have I
[13:42] backsliden? I quit Voice of God
[13:45] recordings. I resigned. I want to I want
[13:49] away from them.
[13:53] Have Have I backsliden? I don't feel
[13:55] like I have. I feel good. And you know
[13:58] that little when you sometimes when you
[14:00] say something, you get that little that
[14:02] little check in there where where it's
[14:05] like, oh, I'm I'm wrong about that or I
[14:08] was wrong about this. You know what I'm
[14:10] talking about? There's that little
[14:11] check. Well, I didn't have that. I hope
[14:14] I don't have it tonight, by the way.
[14:17] But I didn't I didn't have that check.
[14:21] And then as as the sun was coming up and
[14:24] the and the morning light was entering
[14:26] the room where I was, I got my answer
[14:29] from the Lord.
[14:31] And I was asking the Lord, "What about
[14:33] Brother Brandham's message?
[14:36] Have I strayed?" And the Lord answered
[14:39] me. He said his message was a success in
[14:46] your life
[14:48] because he
[14:50] introduced you to me.
[14:52] Amen.
[14:53] And friends, never did I have ever
[14:56] question it since then.
[14:57] That's right.
[14:58] It doesn't matter. And so often we see
[15:02] that these people, they they they see
[15:04] these things and then they start they
[15:06] start to stray, but they didn't go all
[15:08] the way. they didn't do what brother
[15:10] Brandham said is go all the way to
[15:13] Christ. When we don't when we do it when
[15:15] we just get caught up in the individual
[15:18] then we're just part of a denomination
[15:20] again
[15:21] and it's not right.
[15:23] But we need to go all the way to Christ.
[15:25] And if we don't do that then we're
[15:27] easily pulled away.
[15:30] And we see that in these people. They're
[15:32] easily pulled away because you didn't do
[15:34] what brother Brandham said. You didn't
[15:36] do what your pastor said. and it pulls
[15:39] him away from Christ.
[15:41] But brother Brandham, if you look, his
[15:43] job was to give us to Christ.
[15:46] Amen.
[15:46] And I ask you, is is his message of
[15:49] success in your life today?
[15:53] Do you know Jesus Christ not because of
[15:55] brother Brandham,
[15:57] not because of your pastor, but do you
[16:00] know Christ? Have you come to that
[16:03] place? I think you have. I think that
[16:06] this group is is a special group. It may
[16:09] not be like may not fit into the box if
[16:13] you know what I mean. But we don't have
[16:15] to fit into the box. Some people might
[16:17] fit into the box and that's okay. That's
[16:19] good. But you don't have to fit in to
[16:22] these different boxes that were set
[16:24] forth.
[16:26] I um
[16:30] with
[16:32] brother Brandham,
[16:34] the message helps us and we listen to
[16:37] the tapes and and
[16:40] we study his word. Now, we can just say,
[16:42] "I don't want it." Will we be saved? I
[16:45] don't know. If you know Christ, you will
[16:47] be. But when we put our hand up and say,
[16:51] "I don't want your gifts."
[16:53] They make things harder on ourselves.
[16:56] These things, this Bible was given to us
[16:59] for a help to us to guide us through.
[17:02] Brother Bram's message was given to us
[17:04] for a help. But the ultimate destination
[17:07] is of course our Lord Jesus.
[17:11] And and Jesus
[17:14] wanted something very special for his
[17:18] people. He wanted to have fellowship
[17:21] with us. He wanted to be with us
[17:24] forever.
[17:26] And there's a really nice and and
[17:28] friends, I'm trying to as I'm talking,
[17:30] I'm I'm trying to maybe calm nerves a
[17:34] little bit. I want to be ready to read
[17:35] his word. I want you all to be ready and
[17:40] and I want to be ready. May the
[17:42] anointing be there as we get close to
[17:44] reading his word. And Jesus wanted a
[17:49] church. He wanted a body. He wanted a
[17:53] body that was unified.
[17:55] Now, unity does not mean uniformity.
[17:59] We're all different. In First
[18:02] Corinthians chapter 12, we read that you
[18:04] have hands and you have feet and you
[18:05] have you have different you have
[18:06] different members of the body. They all
[18:09] operate independently, but they operate
[18:13] collectively for the body in unison and
[18:16] in one. And that's what Jesus wanted.
[18:20] And Jesus right at the end of his
[18:25] earthly ministry.
[18:28] He gave us some very, very special
[18:31] instructions, which is what I want to go
[18:33] through today and talk about some of
[18:37] these things that he said. And if you
[18:40] would turn, we can start in St. John
[18:42] chapter 14.
[18:46] My brother, I'm gonna I'm gonna give you
[18:48] some scriptures, but um I'll go
[18:51] Yeah, that's fine. We'll go through
[18:53] them. We'll go through them quickly.
[18:58] Now, the setting here,
[19:01] this is one of the saddest settings in
[19:03] the entire Bible. And what happened is
[19:07] Jesus just has that communion supper in
[19:11] chapter 13. And that's that's the verses
[19:14] that we read in communion. And Jesus
[19:19] he he was sad and his and his people his
[19:23] his little group was there and it was
[19:25] such a diverse group and and you see how
[19:28] God is a God of variety. You have
[19:30] Matthew there who lived his whole life
[19:32] cheating his friends.
[19:35] And then you have you have Simon the
[19:36] zealot over here who is everything that
[19:39] he wanted was to turn overturn the
[19:41] government.
[19:43] And then you have you have Nathaniel
[19:45] here who was a a good brother, you know,
[19:47] an Israelite in whom was no there's no
[19:48] guile. And then you have Peter and John
[19:51] probably just normal folks. You have
[19:53] Mary Magdalene who had a mental probably
[19:55] a mental illness. And then you just you
[19:58] have this this group of people that
[20:01] weren't part of that didn't fit in with
[20:03] the Pharisees and the Sadducees and all
[20:05] their doctrines. and he has them here
[20:07] and he's telling them
[20:10] he's telling them he's giving them
[20:12] instructions and we have the communion.
[20:15] He sends Judas off
[20:18] and here he is. and he has his disciples
[20:21] and they're sitting around the table and
[20:23] he starts telling them things and he
[20:26] tells them he says he says I'm going to
[20:30] I'm going to go away
[20:33] and and he starts saying these very
[20:35] strange things and in u we'll start with
[20:39] uh in 148-9 he's Philip asks him
[20:44] I'll read it there's a very important
[20:47] scripture Philip asks Philip says says,
[20:49] "Lord, show us the father."
[20:53] And it suffice suffices us. And Jesus
[20:55] said unto him, "Have I been so long with
[20:58] you, Philillip?
[21:00] Have I been so long with you and yet you
[21:02] have not known me?"
[21:05] And he says, "He that has seen me has
[21:07] seen the father." What a strange thing.
[21:11] Now, this is going to come in a little
[21:13] bit later in the scriptures that I'm
[21:14] going to read. So, so Jesus says, he
[21:17] says, "Hey, if you if you see me,
[21:20] you're seeing the father
[21:23] and and he says, look how close that
[21:27] Christ is to the father." And that's
[21:29] going to come in a little bit later as
[21:31] Jesus prayed. But with the godhead, the
[21:34] father and the son are so close that we
[21:36] as believers, we can't even separate
[21:38] them.
[21:39] They're just right as one.
[21:42] And then he goes on and I'll I'll go
[21:45] ahead and read it. He says he says uh
[21:56] verse 10 he says believest not thou not
[22:00] that I am in the father and the father
[22:01] in me. The words that I speak speak unto
[22:05] you I speak not of myself but the father
[22:07] that dwelleth in me. He doeth the works.
[22:10] Believe me that I am in the Father and
[22:13] the Father in me, or else believe me for
[22:15] the very works sake. Verily I say unto
[22:19] you, he that believeth on me, the works
[22:20] that I do shall he do also. And greater
[22:23] works than these shall he do, because I
[22:26] go unto the Father. Now, I'm sure that
[22:29] the disciples didn't understand what he
[22:31] was talking about. Greater. How can he
[22:32] do greater?
[22:34] But at this time, Jesus was one man. He
[22:37] was flesh. was one man to do a miracle.
[22:40] He had to be there
[22:42] most of the time. He had to be there.
[22:45] And
[22:46] now Jesus is saying, "Hey, something's
[22:50] going to happen. Things are going to
[22:52] change.
[22:54] More more works are going to be done."
[22:57] And he goes on and and he mentions
[23:00] in verse 16.
[23:05] He says this.
[23:08] He says, "And I will pray the Father,
[23:10] and he shall give you another comforter
[23:13] that he may abide with you forever, even
[23:17] the Spirit of truth, whom the world
[23:18] cannot receive, because it seeth him
[23:20] not, neither knoweth him, but you shall
[23:23] know him. For he dwelleth with you and
[23:25] shall be in you." That word comforter
[23:29] in other translations it's advocate.
[23:33] And he's saying he's he's speaking these
[23:35] things and they're not understanding.
[23:37] And he's he's talking at the at the
[23:39] table here.
[23:41] And then
[23:45] he he goes on and then in verse 31 he
[23:50] says, "Let's get up and let's go." He
[23:54] said, "Let's go hence." So they get up.
[23:56] Now where they were is they were in in
[23:58] the city of Jerusalem
[24:00] and they walked down
[24:04] the side of the hill. It's not a very
[24:06] far trip. It's it's from the city of
[24:09] Jerusalem down to their destination was
[24:12] maybe 15 to 30 minutes.
[24:15] And on this little trip that they were
[24:18] going, they're all walking along and
[24:20] he's he's telling them he's giving them
[24:22] these instructions and they're walking
[24:25] and their destination was the Garden of
[24:26] Eden.
[24:28] So they're walking along and he's
[24:30] telling them he's saying in in he's
[24:33] saying things like he's saying in things
[24:35] like 15:11 he says
[24:40] he says these things have I spoken unto
[24:42] you that my joy may remain in you and
[24:44] that your joy may be full. And in verse
[24:48] 12 he says this is my commandment that
[24:50] you love one another as I have loved
[24:53] you. Jesus, it's his commandment. And
[24:57] he's he's he's showing them these
[24:59] things. And in verse 26, he says this.
[25:03] He says, "But when the comforter is
[25:05] come, whom I will send you from the
[25:07] father, even the spirit of truth which
[25:09] proceeds from the mouth, he shall
[25:12] testify of me."
[25:16] And he's going along and he's he's
[25:18] talking. It's it's a very sad time. And
[25:21] I can only imagine Jesus only 33 years
[25:23] old and he's going down and and these
[25:25] disciples they're not really
[25:27] understanding what he's saying. And then
[25:29] in verse 16 he says he says now I'm or
[25:32] in chapter 16 he says now I'm going to
[25:34] go away but he says but be of good
[25:36] cheer.
[25:38] In 16:33
[25:40] he says
[25:44] these things I have spoken unto you that
[25:46] in me you might have peace. In the world
[25:49] you shall have tribulation, but be of
[25:52] good cheer because I've overcome the
[25:55] world.
[25:57] Then Jesus gets down to the bottom of
[25:59] the hill
[26:01] and he's like many of us when we have
[26:05] service. He says, "Let's close in
[26:08] prayer."
[26:10] And now we have all the disciples
[26:12] around. Jesus is about to go to the
[26:14] garden of Gethsemane. He's about to die.
[26:18] And we we can only imagine the pressure
[26:20] that he was under.
[26:22] And he prays this prayer in verse 17 or
[26:27] in chapter 17. I won't go through the
[26:29] whole thing.
[26:34] Let's start with verse 20.
[26:41] Start with verse 19. And he says, "And
[26:42] for their sakes I sanctify myself that
[26:44] they also may be sanctified through the
[26:48] truth."
[26:49] And then he says this, "Neither pray I
[26:52] for these alone, but for them also which
[26:54] shall believe on me through their word."
[26:58] What a wonderful statement, friends.
[27:01] What an absolutely wonderful statement
[27:03] that Jesus said, "I'm not just praying
[27:04] for these here, these disciples that I
[27:07] have. I'm praying for those all of those
[27:09] that will hear the word that will
[27:11] believe on me through their word. And I
[27:15] say that he was talking about the people
[27:18] in this room right now.
[27:20] Amen.
[27:20] Here we are reading the words of the
[27:22] Apostle John. He wrote these words down.
[27:27] And here we are reading his words. So we
[27:30] here can see ourselves in the scripture.
[27:33] And it's and here we are now. And I want
[27:36] to point out here is what we are to do.
[27:40] Now remember Jesus is praying. This is
[27:42] what he wants more than anything in the
[27:44] world. Remember brother Brandham at the
[27:46] end of his message when he in the church
[27:48] age book he says if I could just see
[27:49] established that relationship. Well
[27:52] here's Jesus.
[27:53] And here's what Jesus says at the end.
[27:56] He says this.
[27:58] That they all may be one.
[28:05] as thou Father art in me and I in thee
[28:08] that they also may be one in us.
[28:15] Now this next statement that the world
[28:18] may believe that thou hast sent me.
[28:22] What a statement. He says that they will
[28:25] be so one that these people will be so
[28:28] together. They will love each other so
[28:30] much. They will be so in one accord that
[28:32] the world will see that I am the Messiah
[28:36] because of how they treat each other and
[28:38] how they are together. How they are one.
[28:42] Now friends, we are not there yet, but
[28:45] we can be there. I don't believe that
[28:46] Jesus would have said it if it couldn't
[28:49] be so. I don't believe he would have
[28:50] prayed it. Let me read it again. That
[28:54] the world may believe that thou hast
[28:57] sent me.
[29:00] And the glory which thou gavest me, I
[29:03] have given them that they may be one
[29:07] even as we are one. Remember what I said
[29:14] about Philillip
[29:17] and Jesus said you look at the father
[29:21] and Philip have I you want to see the
[29:22] father have I been with you so long and
[29:24] you don't know me
[29:26] and we as believers we read our church
[29:28] age book we listen to brother Brandham
[29:30] we receive this revelation of how close
[29:33] the father and the son are we can't even
[29:37] tell the difference it's very difficult
[29:39] for even us to distinguish between them.
[29:43] And Jesus says this. He says,
[29:47] he says that
[29:49] that they may be one even as we are one.
[29:55] So Jesus and the father are one. How
[29:58] close are they? How close should we be
[30:01] to each other?
[30:04] How close, friends? you know, a husband
[30:06] and a wife and and a mother and children
[30:09] and and in in the fellowship and even
[30:11] across these message boundaries that we
[30:14] have set in front of us.
[30:16] How much should we be one with each
[30:19] other?
[30:21] It's right here. Jesus prayed it
[30:25] and then we go and do what we've done
[30:28] throughout history. We separate
[30:30] ourselves.
[30:32] But here Jesus is, he's not talking
[30:34] about all of our little doctrines that
[30:36] separate us. He says he wants us to be
[30:39] one.
[30:43] He says that the world
[30:46] that they may be one even as we are one.
[30:49] I in them and thou in me that they may
[30:53] be perfect. They may be made perfect in
[30:56] one. and that the world may know that
[30:59] thou hast sent me and hast loved me and
[31:03] has loved them even as thou has loved
[31:05] me. Once again,
[31:09] that the world may know that I am the
[31:11] Messiah
[31:13] by their love one for another.
[31:22] Father,
[31:24] I will that they also whom thou hast
[31:27] given me be with me
[31:31] where I am,
[31:33] that they may behold my glory which thou
[31:35] hast given me for thou lovest me before
[31:38] the foundation of the world.
[31:43] Then Jesus prays that's those sweet
[31:45] words. He loves us so much. And he says,
[31:49] "Lord, and I want them to be with me.
[31:53] I want them to be together. I want them
[31:56] to love one another. The world's going
[31:59] to see
[32:01] that I am the Messiah
[32:03] through this bond that they have. And
[32:05] then Lord, I want them to be with me.
[32:13] Oh righteous father,
[32:15] the world has not known thee, but I have
[32:18] known
[32:20] and these things
[32:23] and these have known that thou hast sent
[32:26] me. And I have declared unto them thy
[32:29] name, and will declare it, that the love
[32:33] wherewith thou hast loved me may be in
[32:36] them, and I in them.
[32:40] And then here is Jesus
[32:43] and and Jesus
[32:46] sets out this church.
[32:49] And then friends, not too long
[32:52] afterwards,
[32:54] there's a room maybe this size.
[32:57] They go in there and this comforter that
[33:00] was prophesied to come comes down
[33:05] and fills each one. And then they go out
[33:10] and they preach the gospel. The first
[33:12] day Peter goes out and baptizes 3,000
[33:15] people
[33:16] and and it's it's a beautiful time. And
[33:19] this these promises are made manifest
[33:22] and here goes the gospel on display as
[33:26] brother Brandham said and they're out
[33:28] and they're healing the sick and they're
[33:29] they're they're doing miracles and
[33:31] they're leading lost souls to Christ
[33:35] and they're in God's perfect will and
[33:38] they are united.
[33:40] Acts chapter 2 says they were in one
[33:43] accord. They had one purpose there. Acts
[33:46] chapter 4, they were all together in one
[33:50] room. And the Bible says they were of
[33:52] one heart and one soul. The Holy Spirit
[33:56] was so powerful they came into the room
[33:58] that all the walls in the whole room
[34:00] shook
[34:02] because they were together. Why would it
[34:03] say they're of one heart, one soul? It's
[34:06] because it was important.
[34:09] And then they're out and they're doing
[34:10] these things. They're leading people to
[34:12] Christ.
[34:15] You know, we have we have the body
[34:17] operating independently. Like I said,
[34:19] you have you have Philip Philip out here
[34:21] having evangelistic services, going out
[34:24] meeting the unic in the out in the
[34:26] desert. You have Peter over here with
[34:29] with Cornelius. You have you have the
[34:31] the different ones. You have Steven out
[34:32] here doing miracles. And you have all
[34:34] these things going on
[34:36] all in one accord and in love.
[34:40] You Paul comes on the scene a little bit
[34:42] later and he starts doing the same
[34:43] thing.
[34:45] And then friends remember in this Bible
[34:50] these things are not written to be a
[34:52] history book. You know you ever you ever
[34:55] look at Google maps where you can you
[34:57] can like grab the guy and you can drop
[34:59] him and he wiggles his arm and he lands
[35:01] on the street you know and he looks and
[35:04] then you can see you can see the street
[35:05] you can look around. That's how we
[35:07] should be with this Bible. take yourself
[35:10] and drop yourself in.
[35:13] And there we and then look around and
[35:15] see what's going on here.
[35:17] And then we look and we look at some of
[35:20] Paul's writings.
[35:22] And we look at 1 Corinthians
[35:25] chapter 1. Let me read it really fast.
[35:28] I'm sorry, brother. I didn't give you
[35:30] that scripture, but uh like to read it.
[35:33] 1 Corinthians chapter 1.
[35:43] Start at verse 9.
[35:47] Paul says here,
[35:49] now remember
[35:52] things were going good.
[35:54] But let's place oursel in the scripture
[35:56] and ask ourselves, why would Paul say
[35:58] something like this?
[36:00] He says, "God is faithful by whom you
[36:02] were called unto the fellowship of his
[36:04] son Jesus Christ our Lord.
[36:07] Now I beseech you, brethren,
[36:11] by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[36:14] that you all speak the same thing, and
[36:16] that there be no divisions among you,
[36:19] but that you be perfectly joined
[36:21] together in the same mind and in the
[36:24] same judgment.
[36:26] Sounds like what Jesus said, doesn't it?
[36:29] Now, look what Paul's trying to do.
[36:31] Something's going on here. Paul's like,
[36:34] "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Get back.
[36:36] Get back here. Get back here.
[36:40] Next verse.
[36:43] For it have been declared unto me of
[36:46] you, my brethren, by them which are the
[36:49] house of Khloe, that there are
[36:52] contentions among you.
[36:58] Now this I say that every one of you
[37:06] that doesn't leave very many people out.
[37:11] Now this I say that every one of you
[37:14] says I am of Paul. Notice he put himself
[37:17] in there.
[37:19] That's important. See see we would say
[37:21] oh well we're we're of brother Brham.
[37:24] But Paul puts himself right in there.
[37:26] The first church age measure, he was a
[37:28] messenger. He was the original.
[37:30] And he puts himself right in there. He
[37:33] says, "Now, now this, every one of you
[37:35] says that I am of Paul
[37:38] and I have of Apollos
[37:40] and I of Cphus
[37:43] and I of Christ."
[37:47] Paul's looking and he's saying, "Stop.
[37:50] Don't do it. We're going in the wrong
[37:52] direction.
[37:56] And he asks this, "Is Christ divided?"
[38:02] He says, "Was Paul crucified for you?"
[38:07] And he says, "Were you baptized in the
[38:10] name of Paul?"
[38:12] And friends, my my little testimony of
[38:15] my friends there, how brother Brandham
[38:18] introduced me to Christ. There's another
[38:21] place that Paul says, "I have planted,
[38:24] Apollos watered, but God gave the
[38:27] increase."
[38:29] And how we so easily get away from that.
[38:34] And we look at Paul and Paul's saying,
[38:35] "No, no, no, no, no. Don't do it. Don't
[38:39] do it. Don't go back there. We came out
[38:41] of that. Don't go back there." But then
[38:45] all of a sudden, we now we have the
[38:47] Catholic Church not too long after that.
[38:50] And we have we have these then we get
[38:51] the Lutheran church then we get the
[38:53] Methodist church and we get all these
[38:55] divisions. We went right back to where
[38:58] we started.
[39:00] Then 1946 around in there another man
[39:04] came on the scene a prophet the great
[39:08] prophet.
[39:09] He said come out of there and we did.
[39:12] But the human nature here we go right
[39:15] back into where we started. right back
[39:18] where he said don't do it. And we look
[39:21] at Paul here. Paul was concerned. Don't
[39:24] do it. Don't go back to this. We came
[39:26] out of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
[39:28] We We came out of that stuff. Don't go
[39:31] back. But friends, one wonderful thing
[39:35] about this, it was not Paul's job to
[39:38] turn the hearts of the children back to
[39:41] that of the Pentecostal fathers. It
[39:44] wasn't his job. He didn't want it to
[39:46] happen. He wanted to go back but he
[39:48] couldn't do it. That was not his job.
[39:51] But
[39:53] there came a man in our day that it was
[39:56] his job. And it comes at the end time.
[40:00] And here we are now with a group of
[40:03] people
[40:05] that our hearts are moving back in that
[40:09] direction. But it's important that each
[40:12] one of us has our individual parts.
[40:17] We can't just let let it to brother
[40:19] Aaron.
[40:20] We can't just let it to brother
[40:22] Brandham.
[40:23] We have to do something ourselves.
[40:27] One
[40:29] experience I had and it was is really
[40:31] special and I think that you'll
[40:32] appreciate it.
[40:37] The power went out. a voice of God
[40:39] records.
[40:41] So all of us kind of we couldn't do
[40:44] anything. Our computers were off and all
[40:46] of us kind of went into the mail room
[40:48] and it's a big area about this size and
[40:50] we were all we were all sitting in there
[40:52] fellowshipping. Brother Joseph was in
[40:54] there, brother Billy Paul.
[40:56] Brother Joseph asked Brother Billy Paul,
[40:59] he says he says, "Billy," he says, "Tell
[41:01] us about something. Tell us something
[41:03] about Brother Brand. What was like the
[41:06] most special thing about it,
[41:10] brother Billy? He didn't waver when he
[41:14] answered. Now, it wasn't that, oh, he
[41:18] did great miracles. He did do great
[41:21] miracles. It wasn't that he had such an
[41:24] understanding of the scripture. He did
[41:26] have an understanding, a wonderful
[41:28] understanding of the scripture. Brother
[41:29] Billy didn't say that. Brother Billy's
[41:32] answer was this. And it was such a
[41:35] beautiful answer for brother Brandham.
[41:38] But brother Billy's answer was this. He
[41:41] said, "I was the closest person to
[41:44] brother Brandon in the world. I traveled
[41:47] everywhere with him. I I saw him I saw
[41:51] him in the pull pit. I saw him tired. I
[41:54] went hunting with him. I was always with
[41:56] my dad."
[41:58] Now, this is a good example to all of
[42:01] us.
[42:04] But Billy said, "Even me,
[42:09] even I
[42:11] did not know daddy's friends from his
[42:15] enemies."
[42:18] Oh, what a what a wonderful thing. And
[42:20] look at us and we're so quick to fight
[42:23] and argue. But brother Brandham
[42:27] had that beautiful spirit of Christ that
[42:32] the Lord Jesus prayed for us to have and
[42:37] he was our example.
[42:40] And friends, I want that. I want it.
[42:44] I want to see it in the body of Christ
[42:46] in my flesh. I want to see it. If we
[42:49] continue the way we're going, we won't
[42:52] see it, brother. It'll be maybe for
[42:54] another generation to see it. But I want
[42:57] to see it. It's the desire of my heart
[43:01] to see that. But it can't come from us
[43:05] just giving into the enemy. All of us
[43:07] feel things against each other. It's
[43:10] normal.
[43:12] We can't open our mouth.
[43:14] Just let positive things come out. And I
[43:16] I know I'm preaching to the choir, to
[43:18] this group, and I know that that brother
[43:21] Aaron sets a good example, but it's
[43:24] important, friends. It's important that
[43:27] we represent the Lord Jesus Christ, just
[43:31] as brother Brandham did. Didn't know his
[43:33] friends from his enemies, his own son.
[43:37] and how Jesus prayed that that would
[43:40] come. And I believe that it will.
[43:44] But I just want it to be me. I want to
[43:47] see it. I want to be there, brother
[43:51] West. I want to I want to be there when
[43:53] when that rapture happens.
[43:56] There's there's a quote um that I want
[43:59] to read to you, brother. That second
[44:01] quote, do you have that one about um the
[44:04] uh a month or so?
[44:10] Uh I think it's uh
[44:16] let me see here.
[44:22] Um it's the second one I gave you.
[44:28] Nope, it's the one before that.
[44:33] Yeah. Here we go. So, how many of us in
[44:38] closing I want to say this. How many of
[44:40] us have heard the quote that uh when the
[44:43] rapture happens there'll be 30 or 40
[44:44] days and and then that we'll be with our
[44:47] loved ones and then we'll go on the
[44:48] rapture. Have you heard that? Have you
[44:49] heard that said many times? Yeah. Yeah.
[44:51] So have I. The only problem is you never
[44:53] heard brother Brandham say it. That's
[44:56] such an odd thing. We quote it. We quote
[44:58] it. We quote it. But brother Brandham
[45:00] that I know of didn't actually say that.
[45:05] He said this. He said, "See where we're
[45:08] living, friends. What's the matter with
[45:10] people? Can you see that we're at the
[45:12] end time? It's all over. The next thing
[45:14] will be a sweep that'll grab the group
[45:16] together. In a month or so, she'll be
[45:18] gone. As soon as she's gathered
[45:20] together, we're at the end. There's no
[45:22] hopes left. Nowhere. Run to Christ,
[45:27] people." There's the quote. It's when
[45:31] they come together. And how beautiful is
[45:34] that that will bring the rapture I
[45:36] believe when we get that love that Jesus
[45:39] prayed. Let me close with a quote here
[45:41] and then brother if uh song leader I
[45:45] don't know who the song leader is but if
[45:49] um let me close with a quote here
[45:52] brother. So it's the thirsting for life
[45:54] quote if you will.
[45:59] And when the Holy Spirit came in the
[46:01] upper room, it said there came a sound
[46:02] as Russian mighty wind.
[46:05] Now nothing was blowing. It was just
[46:06] like the sound it was and it filled all
[46:09] the house where they were setting and
[46:11] then clo and tongues set up upon them
[46:14] like fire.
[46:16] And how did this great pillar of fire,
[46:18] the angel of God, the logos that went
[46:20] out of God that led the children of
[46:22] Israel through the wilderness, when it
[46:24] come among the people, it separated
[46:26] itself and great licks of fire begin to
[46:30] come upon each one as the fire began to
[46:33] break up
[46:36] and to God dividing himself among his
[46:39] people. Oh, that ought to tear the h the
[46:42] heart out of anybody. God tearing
[46:45] himself apart that he might divide
[46:47] himself a little bit with each one of
[46:51] us. That's all together. You see what I
[46:54] mean? How beautiful.
[46:57] Can you see now why I'm standing for
[46:59] unity of every church, every full gospel
[47:02] church, every believer,
[47:05] we ought to be one heart, one mind, and
[47:08] one accord. No matter how much we differ
[47:11] in the scriptures,
[47:13] that might be one might see it this way
[47:17] or that has nothing to do with it. But
[47:20] in principle, we ought to stand. one
[47:24] great mighty army of God marching on
[47:28] because each one of you in your
[47:29] peculiarity,
[47:31] God has proved that he's ignoring your
[47:34] doctrine
[47:37] because he gave you the Holy Ghost.
[47:41] And the Bible said he
[47:45] gave them the Holy Ghost that obeyed
[47:47] him. Now if I obeyed in my peculiar way
[47:50] and you obeyed in in you obeyed him in
[47:53] your peculiar way, he'd give us both the
[47:56] Holy Ghost. So we ought to be Christian
[47:58] brethren and sister enough to arm up
[48:01] together and to march on for one great
[48:04] purpose, the gospel.
[48:06] Oh, how I think of God separating
[48:08] himself that he might dip down into his
[48:11] big soul and pour out a little spoonful
[48:13] in me and reach over and pour out a
[48:17] spoonful in you and in you and in you
[48:19] and in you and in you, dividing himself
[48:22] the fire, the cleansing power of God.
[48:25] Then if you have a spoonful and I have a
[48:27] spoonful and we both get together, we
[48:30] got two spoonfuls. And if 50 of us are
[48:33] together, we got 50 spoonfuls. And where
[48:36] there is unity, where there is
[48:38] gathering, there is safety. And what
[48:40] more? It's just twice as hard as in the
[48:44] prophet's hands the sticks to break. Two
[48:47] sticks are harder to break
[48:50] than one.
[48:52] And when we can come together to that
[48:54] place, brother, if I can see that
[48:56] happen, I'd walk out here on top of
[48:58] Camelback Mountain, raise up my hands,
[49:00] and say, "Even so, come. Lord Jesus,
[49:04] take me now. It's all over." See, I'd be
[49:08] ready to go right then. Brethren,
[49:12] I don't think this church has a problem
[49:15] with the vision. I think this church has
[49:18] open arms. I love your website. It says
[49:20] come home.
[49:22] And I think it can spread. And I think
[49:24] the love that you all have can move
[49:28] forward, can move this this work forward
[49:31] and let us see this coming of Christ in
[49:36] our own flesh. And I want to encourage
[49:39] you all to be those pillars in the
[49:42] church and reach out across those lines
[49:46] and to bring God's
[49:49] wayward children back into the fold.
[49:53] Let's pray.
[49:56] Our heavenly father, how great it is to
[49:59] read your word,
[50:01] Lord, to love you and and to love your
[50:04] word that you gave to us and knowing,
[50:07] Father, that you went to the cross that
[50:09] that you might have fellowship with us
[50:12] for all eternity. That mean we might be
[50:14] where you are.
[50:17] Lord God, I ask that you would anoint
[50:20] us, Father, with this love that we
[50:21] talked about that we might reach out
[50:24] across and and bring people into the
[50:27] fold that may have been, Lord, set aside
[50:30] by the world, set aside by the church,
[50:33] that may they feel welcome among us. I
[50:36] pray, Father, we love you. We ask that,
[50:40] Lord, that you'd go before us always.
[50:43] May your perfect will be done, Father.
[50:46] And Lord, as the bride said, come
[50:49] quickly,
[50:51] Lord. Come and and we say the same. We
[50:54] want to see you, Lord, in our flesh. We
[50:57] pray that we can have a part in this
[51:01] great work that's happening.
[51:03] Father, that's we believe that's maybe
[51:06] overdue
[51:08] because of our own our own father
[51:10] missteps.
[51:13] Lord, help us. We pray. May you be
[51:15] glorified in the name of our Lord Jesus
[51:17] Christ. Amen.
[51:21] God bless you my friends.
