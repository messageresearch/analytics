[0:00] so glad that you're here today and I
[0:02] believe the Lord wants to speak to you 1
[0:04] Thessalonians chapter 5 start with verse
[0:07] 5 and we'll read to verse
[0:10] n ye are all the children of light and
[0:14] the children of the day we are not of
[0:17] the night nor of the darkness now this
[0:20] has very very uh great significance for
[0:25] us in this hour because we have been
[0:27] introduced to the day through shalom and
[0:30] and the rising of the Sun and
[0:31] recognizing your day so we're in a a
[0:33] distinct dis
[0:35] dispensation that has not been
[0:37] experienced within the Gentile
[0:39] dispensation and I think this scripture
[0:40] has great application for us therefore
[0:43] let us not sleep as do others but let us
[0:46] watch and be sober for they that sleep
[0:49] sleep in the night and they that be
[0:51] drunken are drunken in the night but let
[0:53] us who are of the day be sober put it on
[0:56] the breastplate of faith and love and
[0:58] for a helmet the hope of salvation now
[1:00] that hope is a future expectation uh not
[1:04] hoping that you're saved but it's a
[1:05] future anticipation of full Deliverance
[1:08] for God hath not appointed us to wrath
[1:10] but to obtain salvation by our Lord
[1:13] Jesus Christ amen you can be
[1:17] seated my um title today within the
[1:20] subject of pure joy is wide awake and
[1:23] this is going to be uh part
[1:25] one I'm was anticipating that I would
[1:28] cut short um in the middle of this uh
[1:32] the direction I was headed um but we'll
[1:34] just kind of maybe make a few uh read a
[1:37] statement towards the end and refer to
[1:39] something very important in the message
[1:42] that'll kind of give you a little bit
[1:44] more Direction in terms of what uh
[1:47] what's on my heart and what I'm looking
[1:48] at when we speak on this subject of wide
[1:50] awake and I'll try to share some things
[1:53] here at the outset that would kind of
[1:54] help us in terms of uh recognizing the
[1:57] continuity from one service to the next
[2:00] we and looking at the subject of pure
[2:02] joy we've been uh identifying this
[2:04] statement from the church age book uh in
[2:07] the last few Services where brother Bram
[2:09] says our spirit is clean and it that
[2:12] that to me is um a challenge many times
[2:16] we have so many things that kind of
[2:17] Muddy up our spirits and our thought
[2:18] process and we recognize that we're
[2:20] we're wrestling with uh not in a
[2:23] perverted way but defilements in things
[2:25] that just kind of hinder us and Cloud
[2:27] our thinking and our emotions uh so this
[2:29] is a promise that we can hold on to say
[2:31] Lord I believe this I believe that it's
[2:33] clean therefore Lord you can Purge it
[2:34] you can sanctify even our Spirits our
[2:37] spirit is clean it is fresh it is real
[2:41] it is sober and serious but nonetheless
[2:43] full of the joy of the Lord so these are
[2:45] very important characteristics that were
[2:47] being that were being given the
[2:49] Christian ought to be just as exuberant
[2:52] and full of his pleasure in the Lord or
[2:54] joy in the Lord as the world is when it
[2:57] Savers and delights in its pleasures
[3:00] that's an outstanding statement so to
[3:02] whatever intensity or degree that the
[3:05] world is enthused about worldly things
[3:08] and and they become activist and they
[3:10] become evangelist for certain things and
[3:12] that's a term that's not just used
[3:14] within uh within christiandom and some
[3:17] while he's an evangelist for that and an
[3:19] evangelist for this uh if you mentioned
[3:21] that just among amongst people who are
[3:23] developers or Tech in technology and you
[3:25] say well he's an evangelist they'll say
[3:27] well well for what code or what program
[3:29] an evangelist for Microsoft or you know
[3:32] evangelist for this because it's a term
[3:34] that's used for people that are
[3:36] enthusiastic right developers developers
[3:38] developers they're really enthusiastic
[3:40] about about something they go out and
[3:42] they Inspire and they encourage and they
[3:44] get other people to adopt a platform and
[3:46] so just as much as someone can be sold
[3:49] out and convinced and an activist and
[3:52] supportive of something in the world
[3:54] then we ought to exceed that in terms of
[3:57] our dedication to the things of God and
[4:00] how it we are enthusiastic about it what
[4:03] do they say about you don't have to ask
[4:04] someone if they're a
[4:05] vegan right because they'll tell you and
[4:10] uh and that's how we ought to be in some
[4:12] ways about our passion for Christ it's
[4:13] not that that we would tell tell have to
[4:15] tell everybody but they can just tell
[4:18] something that they notice so this is a
[4:19] the parallels that brother bram's
[4:21] bringing and so he's making a
[4:23] distinction and this is important to
[4:25] understand about pure joy he making a
[4:27] distinction between the joy of the flesh
[4:29] enthus iasm of the flesh exuberance of
[4:31] the flesh Pleasures or Delights of the
[4:34] Flesh and the joy of the Lord because
[4:37] pure
[4:37] joy at at its core is a state of the
[4:41] Soul not the state of the mind I if we
[4:45] if we phrased joy as merely being a
[4:47] state of mind then our minds can change
[4:49] and it can become encumbered it can
[4:51] become cloudy and and that's a that's a
[4:53] part of the temple that uh can be
[4:55] subject to natural elements but if we
[4:57] recognize that our joy and the source of
[4:59] our pure joy is the state of the Soul
[5:02] then that kind of gives us some Bedrock
[5:04] that we know we're grounded in that in
[5:06] moments of instability and uncertainty
[5:09] we say well wait a minute let's let's
[5:11] refocus and recalibrate where's the
[5:13] source of my joy and it's a state of
[5:15] Soul not the state of
[5:17] mind now brother Branham uh is the kind
[5:21] of the language he's using and I want to
[5:23] summarize it he connects the joy of the
[5:25] Lord with the fresh real and clean
[5:29] spirit
[5:30] spirit this is me just kind of uh
[5:32] reordering the words our spirit is clean
[5:34] fresh real so he's taking our the joy of
[5:37] the Lord and he's connecting it with the
[5:38] spirit that is fresh real true and
[5:41] genuine and a clean spirit so it's it's
[5:45] not a flesh that has been intoxicated
[5:47] it's not a flesh that has been
[5:49] stimulated by the wrong things this
[5:52] isn't a hallucination this isn't some
[5:55] sort of uh HP hypnosis where the person
[5:58] is experiencing things and seeing things
[6:00] and that's kind of an illusion that
[6:02] gives them the stimulus that they're
[6:04] excited or enjoying something uh
[6:06] stimulating but this is something that's
[6:08] real clean and fresh and he says that
[6:12] the joy of the Lord is connected with
[6:13] the spirit that is and this is the
[6:15] phrase that I'd like to amplify today
[6:17] sober and
[6:19] serious and that's a that's a very uh
[6:22] that just even those words someone sober
[6:24] and serious that we can begin to kind of
[6:26] identify a certain personality or
[6:28] characteristic and I think if we do that
[6:30] oh he's very so somber and he's very
[6:32] very Stern we're actually missing the
[6:35] point that brother bam is making because
[6:36] it's not that type of disposition he's
[6:39] he's queuing Us in on something very
[6:40] scriptural that helps us to understand
[6:43] uh how we can experience pure
[6:46] joy I'd like to uh just for a moment
[6:49] touch on a clean conscience I am in some
[6:52] ways continuing on that subject of a
[6:55] clean conscience but this uh I think
[6:57] this subject of wide awake uses
[6:59] terminology to kind of focus us a little
[7:01] bit more and on the subject of a clean
[7:04] conscience we were looking how if I
[7:06] could say it this way clean conscience
[7:08] is a conscience that is in tune with the
[7:09] holy spirit that it's something that's
[7:12] kind of uh it's been washed by the word
[7:14] it's properly channeled it's looking to
[7:16] the things of God it's experiencing a
[7:18] Rejuvenation and invigoration by the
[7:20] things of God it's the conscience is
[7:22] somehow it's holding hands with the
[7:24] faith that's in our soul and then
[7:26] whenever some other disconcerting
[7:28] imagination uh memory reason or
[7:31] affection kind of comes up your
[7:33] conscience says well no that that that's
[7:34] not true or that's not right and it has
[7:36] a way of trying to bring Harmony amongst
[7:38] all the other senses and emotions in our
[7:40] spirit and that kind of brings us to
[7:42] where yeah I realize you're really
[7:43] really sad but the holy spirit is a
[7:45] comforter or I know that's really
[7:47] bothering you but you shouldn't uh Envy
[7:49] or you shouldn't lust like that and your
[7:50] conscience kind of becomes a a component
[7:53] of how this man on the inside of the
[7:55] inside in the engine room governs us and
[7:58] controls us and our conscience is the
[8:01] faculty of knowing what is right uh and
[8:04] and then also it's kind of the awareness
[8:06] of whether or not what we're doing
[8:08] agrees with what we
[8:09] believe so when you do something
[8:11] hypocritical your conscience will tell
[8:13] you you're a hypocrite right when you do
[8:16] something critical you your conscience
[8:19] to tell you hey you're you're that's
[8:21] like the pot calling the kettle black
[8:23] and other words you're just seeing your
[8:24] reflection buddy you you that's you and
[8:27] then you oh I shouldn't do that I
[8:30] shouldn't say that I shouldn't feel that
[8:31] way I I I and then that becomes that's
[8:33] what our conscience tells us so then if
[8:36] that becomes numb or dull or defiled as
[8:39] the scripture says or seared think of
[8:41] where that leaves a person in a very
[8:43] dangerous place now we looked at how our
[8:46] conscience is different from our
[8:48] Consciousness so we have a conscience as
[8:51] brother R said we have imagination
[8:53] memory reason affection and conscience
[8:55] all within our spirit conscience is a
[8:57] part of all these other uh feelings the
[9:00] conscience is a that's a noun it speaks
[9:02] to this faculty of knowing the right
[9:04] thing to do and guilt and and AC you
[9:07] know affirmation when you've done well
[9:08] but Consciousness relates to our
[9:11] feelings and our perceptions and our
[9:13] awareness of the world around us so
[9:16] right now we we ought to be conscious
[9:17] that we're in the middle of a church
[9:18] service and we're conscious of within
[9:21] this church service everyone's sitting
[9:22] down and everyone's listening and then
[9:24] as we're conscious of these things your
[9:26] conscience would tell you now's not the
[9:28] time to stand stand up and stretch and
[9:30] yawn real loud right your conscience
[9:33] would tell you how to act and behave
[9:35] within the context of the realm and the
[9:38] room that you are conscious of now
[9:42] there's there's so much that could be
[9:44] shared in this realm and I from some of
[9:46] the fellowship that I've had with the
[9:47] Believers on this subject since we began
[9:50] it a lot of you are kind of tapping into
[9:52] other areas in the word of God and being
[9:53] inspired in different ways so you see
[9:56] just how how much depth and bread there
[9:58] is to this subject but let me say your
[10:01] conscience and your Consciousness should
[10:04] be in tune or in
[10:07] harmony together for our hearts and our
[10:09] emotions to be purely on the Lord so our
[10:13] our state of consciousness H uh has to
[10:16] be in harmony with our conscience in
[10:18] order for there to be us to fully
[10:21] experience the joy of the Lord if you
[10:22] have a guilty conscience if you're
[10:25] conscious of something and you have this
[10:26] memory and then your conscience now
[10:28] working together with that produces some
[10:31] sort of anxiety that's going to hinder
[10:33] or interfere with the joy of the Lord so
[10:36] there's got to be Harmony uh they have
[10:38] to be in tune with one another your
[10:39] Consciousness and your conscience in
[10:41] tune in order for our hearts and our
[10:43] emotions as brother bam says should be
[10:45] purely on the Lord and that's part of
[10:46] the statement as if we read further in
[10:49] that uh comment from the patmas vision
[10:52] in the church age book The Christian's
[10:54] hearts and emotions are purely on the
[10:56] Lord so there's a stability a
[10:58] harmonizing and a sinking together of
[11:00] our conscience and
[11:03] Consciousness now I'll take a step
[11:05] further today on wide awake and let's
[11:08] think about the term sober and sober and
[11:12] serious Brother B said the believer is
[11:14] sober uh it the spirit is sober and
[11:16] serious but yet full the joy of the Lord
[11:20] uh to be sober it's to be moderate in
[11:22] desires or actions it's speaking of
[11:24] being temperate or restrained it speaks
[11:27] of being calm and quiet so this is what
[11:30] it means to be sober calm quiet uh
[11:32] moderate in desires moderate in actions
[11:34] restrained calm quiet not overcome by
[11:38] emotion so you begin to I want you to
[11:41] kind of pick up on this and I'm just
[11:42] using different definitions or meanings
[11:45] of this word over the last several
[11:46] hundred years how convenient is that so
[11:48] we can all some of us who are several
[11:50] hundred years old be like well that's
[11:51] the way I use that word but th this is
[11:54] these are ways that we can identify what
[11:56] the word sober means and I want you to
[11:59] identify how that it's relating to
[12:01] whether or not someone gets
[12:02] overstimulated by things things that
[12:05] kind of you know that that it causes
[12:08] them to go into a panic or it causes
[12:09] them to be really really extreme this
[12:11] way or really really emotional or that
[12:14] it it's trying to bring a stability and
[12:15] an evenness are it's speaking of an
[12:17] evenness or stability not overcome by
[12:19] emotion appropriately
[12:22] solemn appropriately serious and not in
[12:26] in other words not a giddy in a giddy
[12:28] way which is inappropriate or or
[12:30] insensitive it speaks of someone being a
[12:33] Ser a serious-minded person so this is
[12:35] what sober means they're moderate in
[12:37] their actions and their desires they're
[12:39] restrained they they show the
[12:41] appropriate restraint though even though
[12:43] there might be some sort of stimulus and
[12:45] you're excited I've mentioned it before
[12:47] that um as soon as my children hear
[12:49] about something excited they're just
[12:51] likeing doing doing doing and they're
[12:53] talking while they're doing it too the
[12:55] whole time are we really going to do
[12:56] that are we really on a vacation we're
[12:57] really going to get do and and it's like
[12:59] calm down sober up a little bit you can
[13:02] still be excited and you don't have to
[13:03] jump up and down over and over again and
[13:06] so this is It's and then also is saying
[13:07] that there's there it's an appropriate
[13:09] emotional
[13:11] response and then and then the
[13:13] definition also kind of captures in the
[13:15] idea of being serious a serious-minded
[13:17] person so brother B said a Believer is
[13:19] sober and serious so now don't all of a
[13:23] sudden say all right I want to be very
[13:24] sober very serious today and uh be quiet
[13:28] I'm going to be be calm I'm going to be
[13:30] unmoved today and then just make me
[13:31] suffer for the next two
[13:33] hours I I would recommend that you just
[13:36] be appropriately exuberant about the
[13:38] word of God so in the message so as he
[13:41] says serious sober and serious serious
[13:44] means expressing an Earnest purpose
[13:48] expressing an Earnest thought to be
[13:51] serious it's acting or speaking
[13:54] sincerely or
[13:56] earnestly so it has something to do more
[13:58] with genuine
[14:00] and something to do with a a
[14:02] conviction then it does just sternness
[14:05] or rigidness or you know I'm serious and
[14:08] and it kind of it's more of it again
[14:10] that becomes more oh he's serious he
[14:12] means business we could actually just be
[14:14] talking about maybe someone's fervency
[14:17] and rigidness and and harshness but this
[14:19] is an
[14:21] earnestness a a and speaking sincerely
[14:24] and earnestly so in order for someone to
[14:26] be Earnest or sincere what they're what
[14:28] they're thinking and how they're feeling
[14:30] has to comport with and agree with their
[14:32] conscience otherwise that's not serious
[14:34] that's that's
[14:35] hypocrisy that's intensity for the
[14:38] purpose of deceiving you and have you
[14:40] ever felt like someone was overwhelming
[14:42] you with facts and information and and
[14:44] you realize that you they were just
[14:45] trying to snowball me into believ in a
[14:47] lie they seem so serious and they had it
[14:50] all figured out and and so that's that's
[14:52] not the seriousness that the word
[14:54] relates to now we could take sober and
[14:57] serious and that phrase they're very
[14:58] sober and serious to mean without humor
[15:01] or the expression of happiness and
[15:03] that's one of the definitions of serus
[15:05] without humor or expression of happiness
[15:08] but that's that's not what brother Bam's
[15:11] identifying he says they're sober and
[15:12] serious when they say it's it's more
[15:16] rather if I could put it this way no
[15:19] nonsense and uh and I I meant to ask um
[15:23] maybe maybe brother Elliot would
[15:24] remember uh when we were with brother
[15:26] Craig bur one time and uh and we were
[15:29] together at a restaurant and they wanted
[15:31] to go sit at another table or something
[15:33] like that and there was a a a a TV
[15:35] screen that was nearby and brother Craig
[15:36] you just remember Josiah No Nonsense was
[15:38] it No Nonsense or what was it you
[15:40] remember yeah no see I got it right
[15:43] Elliot's my notebook and uh and so he's
[15:46] like hey No Nonsense in other words he
[15:48] was saying if there's anything on that
[15:50] television anything that comes up you
[15:52] turn your head young man like we don't
[15:55] we don't go with any kind of nonsense no
[15:56] any kind of frivolity anything that's
[15:58] inappropriate and it was a phrase that
[16:00] was used to convey not go over there sit
[16:03] down and don't have any fun with your
[16:04] friends and go there and sit down and be
[16:06] real strict and be real rigid and be
[16:07] self-righteous and be indignant it was
[16:09] like hey just remember keep yourself
[16:11] clean No Nonsense and when brother
[16:13] brandham says that our spirit should be
[16:15] sober and serious he's not saying it
[16:17] should be without humor and without the
[16:18] expression of Happiness he's saying
[16:20] there's no nonsense there's no hypocrisy
[16:22] there's no inappropriate stimulation
[16:24] that's entering in to our
[16:26] spirits and so when we we we we we're
[16:30] now we're identifying this phrase to
[16:32] speak about this wide awake now just
[16:36] take it and run with it because I'm only
[16:38] going to be able to cover a very small
[16:39] portion of this thought that lays before
[16:41] me this
[16:42] morning but and that phrase wi awake can
[16:45] really tune you into some things in the
[16:46] message that are just outstanding so if
[16:48] you're Wide Awake you're not
[16:50] numb you're not inappropriate been doled
[16:54] and so you're you're if you're Wide
[16:56] Awake you're you're aware not unaware
[16:59] not clueless or oblivious so this is
[17:00] wide awake you're you're in tune you're
[17:02] conscious H so you're not numb uh you're
[17:05] not unaware but you're you you're
[17:07] conscious so there's uh you're in tune
[17:09] to the situation the setting around you
[17:11] you're very conscious of things and and
[17:14] you're very conscious of circumstances
[17:16] around you and not only are you
[17:18] conscious of it but your understanding
[17:20] your understanding of what these things
[17:22] mean in other words you're you're um you
[17:25] wake up one morning and you're you're on
[17:26] vacation on an island in the Pacific and
[17:29] you walk out you're like oh wow isn't
[17:31] this amazing the beach is about a 100
[17:33] yards deeper than I than it was before
[17:35] we woke up and did you notice that
[17:36] little slight trimmer a little bit ago
[17:38] and you kind of start walk man this is
[17:40] amazing look at these fish and you're
[17:41] just going to keep walking way out into
[17:43] the ocean you realize okay I'm aware
[17:45] that this is a little bit different the
[17:46] beach looks different this morning and
[17:48] there was just an earthquake and there's
[17:50] no waves coming in and all immediately
[17:54] you become conscious of the situation
[17:56] then you begin to get understanding that
[17:58] could this be a tsunami me right this is
[18:01] this is and you begin to identify
[18:03] certain things and then you're engaged
[18:04] you're active you're responsive to those
[18:06] things and so this is when you're wide
[18:08] awake you you're you're you're conscious
[18:10] of things around you you're
[18:11] understanding of what these things
[18:12] around you mean and you're engaged
[18:14] you're appropriately responsive and
[18:16] proactive considering the things that
[18:18] are taking place so wide awake is a
[18:21] reference to our conduct and our
[18:22] attitude and that our conduct our
[18:25] attitude our conduct and even our
[18:27] character is appro for the moment it's
[18:29] appropriate for the situation that we're
[18:32] responding the right way given the
[18:34] circumstances we're doing the right
[18:36] thing considering uh uh the stimulus
[18:38] that's being input the things that we're
[18:40] being challenged with you understand uh
[18:42] maybe in just a general sense what I
[18:44] mean by wide awake I I I'll give this
[18:47] example we had we built a really
[18:49] beautiful home by the grace of God and
[18:52] with uh and with my dad's help of course
[18:55] I always joked with them it was the last
[18:56] time I build a fixer uper but uh
[18:59] we uh we we we had a we built a nice
[19:02] home and the alarm system that got put
[19:04] in it was one that talks to
[19:06] you and so one night in the middle of
[19:08] the night like 3:00 in the morning all
[19:10] of a sudden someone started telling me
[19:11] there was a fire in the house it was
[19:13] fire and so I got up not quite awake so
[19:18] I jumped up and all I can muster is I'm
[19:21] running out the do the
[19:24] fire slow motion so I chew on my tongue
[19:27] as I M you know yell to Elizabeth but
[19:28] there's a fire and I ran smack into my
[19:30] dresser cuz I wasn't wide awake yet I
[19:33] was in full control of my of my tongue
[19:36] and full control of my legs and so that
[19:38] that's what that would be so you're not
[19:40] quite awake yet and that's the excuse we
[19:42] use sometimes we do something silly in
[19:44] the morning what do we say I'm not wide
[19:45] awake yet I'm not all there my mind's
[19:48] not my my mind hasn't caught up with my
[19:50] body and so this is this is what is
[19:53] meant in a natural way by wide awake but
[19:55] let's start making a spiritual
[19:56] application a real practical application
[19:59] of wide awake if you could turn to our
[20:03] text 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 I'll
[20:05] start with verse 6 Paul is already
[20:07] established uh that we are not of the
[20:10] night nor of we of the darkness we are
[20:12] children of light Children of the day so
[20:14] then with that as a premise he says
[20:16] therefore let us not
[20:19] sleep as do others and this sleep means
[20:22] slothful when he says let us not sleep
[20:24] as do others it speaks of being in a
[20:26] state of indifference ah doesn't matter
[20:30] it doesn't don't don't really care it's
[20:32] more of an apathy and an indifference
[20:34] and if you're not careful apathy
[20:36] sometimes can look a lot like somebody
[20:38] uh uh who is
[20:40] confident apathy someone says they they
[20:43] we think oh this is Faith but what we
[20:44] talking about before it's really not
[20:46] Faith you're just
[20:47] numb you're not responding appropriately
[20:50] to the situation because you're
[20:51] completely numb you're not moved anymore
[20:53] you don't care you know it doesn't
[20:55] matter to you I you know this has
[20:57] happened so many times you might as well
[20:59] just expect it and you just kind of
[21:01] become numb to it it's kind of like all
[21:02] of us right now when it comes to Summers
[21:04] and Phoenix right but yeah you know what
[21:08] this is just how it is and that's not
[21:10] what faith is that's not what uh real uh
[21:13] real Consciousness is so he's saying let
[21:15] us not sleep or be slothful or
[21:17] indifferent and what he's identifying is
[21:20] this Darkness he'll come to it again
[21:21] here in the morning in a moment how this
[21:24] there's a state of Darkness that speaks
[21:26] of being ignorant
[21:28] and and and the the language is being
[21:30] used he says let's not be of a drowsy
[21:32] frame of mind kind of just drowsy and
[21:36] not really alert not really all there
[21:38] just kind of kind of those cobwebs that
[21:41] we have in the morning he says don't let
[21:42] us sleep as do others but let us watch
[21:46] and be
[21:48] sober this is the Commandment twist
[21:50] watch and be sober for they that sleep
[21:53] sleep in the night and they that be
[21:55] drunken are drunken in the night now he
[21:58] is using something that's very natural
[22:00] when he uses this in verse seven he's
[22:02] using it in a very literal sense that
[22:03] literally people sleep at night and
[22:06] people get drunk at night this is a
[22:08] generalization and and he's so he's you
[22:10] he's looking at the actual sleep and
[22:13] drunkenness takes place in the evening
[22:14] and the night time and he's using this
[22:17] to ponder well if that's what people do
[22:19] in the natural then what ought we to be
[22:21] doing in a spiritual sense in a
[22:23] spiritual frame of mind and so when he's
[22:25] talking about sleepiness or drunkenness
[22:28] he's talking about an apathy to u to
[22:32] serious things an indifference towards
[22:35] things that really matter so this is a
[22:37] drowsiness a sleepiness an apathy an
[22:40] insincerity towards things that are
[22:43] spiritually important to towards things
[22:45] that matter like this ought to matter
[22:49] and and this should this should mean
[22:51] something and you ought to be fully
[22:53] aware of that and you that you ought to
[22:55] care and that that should be important
[22:57] to you versus I well you know it doesn't
[22:59] matter and this kind of apathy or this
[23:01] drowsiness or this
[23:05] insincerity and and that uh well I'll
[23:09] maybe hold that thought for
[23:11] later recognize this is kind of what
[23:13] he's he's this is exactly what he's
[23:15] identifying is an apathy a drowsiness
[23:17] and indifference kind of a sloppiness on
[23:19] one hand where he says we ought to be
[23:21] awake we ought to be active so he says
[23:24] but let us verse eight who are of the
[23:27] day be sober and now this soberness is
[23:31] active put it on the breastplate of
[23:33] faith and love and for a helmet put it
[23:35] on the helmet the hope of Salvation it's
[23:37] forward-looking it's anticipating it
[23:40] it's a breastplate of faith and love a
[23:42] helmet of for the hope of salvation for
[23:44] God hath not appointed us to wrath with
[23:46] an understanding of what the future is
[23:48] future Victory is Victory now Victory
[23:50] head is Victory now so with this hope of
[23:53] full deliverance and Redemption and
[23:54] salvation we recognize by predestination
[23:57] we're anchored upon this election we're
[23:59] headed towards our destiny God hath not
[24:01] appointed us to judgment and wrath but
[24:03] he's appointed us ordained us predestin
[24:05] us to fully possess salvation by by our
[24:08] Lord Jesus Christ so with this soberness
[24:11] with this sober mind there's a
[24:13] preparedness and we're making ready
[24:15] appropriately there's an appropriate
[24:17] preparation in terms of what we know is
[24:20] ahead of us it's the helmet of the hope
[24:23] for the hope for helmet we're put on the
[24:26] hope of Salvation in other words this is
[24:27] the mind said in an attitude that
[24:29] there's full Deliverance coming I'm
[24:32] protected a breastplate of faith and
[24:34] love these are things that H uh speak to
[24:36] our protections but also our destiny
[24:38] because God hath appointed us it's a
[24:41] beautiful beautiful uh scriptures isn't
[24:43] it these things are beautiful to read
[24:47] now to I I want to go through some
[24:49] statements very quickly scriptures very
[24:50] quickly I have several in front of me
[24:52] just identify this subject of soberness
[24:56] and how important it is to the
[24:57] believer's walk now if we thought that
[24:59] soberness merely meant absence from wine
[25:03] or absence from things that intoxicate
[25:05] us and you thought that's all it meant
[25:07] then no wonder all of us kind of thought
[25:08] man I'm I'm carrying my 30-year sober
[25:10] token in the message uh soberness means
[25:13] more than you know uh drinking uh
[25:17] alcohol not drinking alcohol Romans
[25:19] chapter
[25:21] 13:1 and that knowing the time so
[25:24] knowing the time having an understanding
[25:26] of the time being conscious of the time
[25:27] being s sensitive to the time he says
[25:30] that now it is high time to awake out of
[25:34] sleep for now is our Salvation near than
[25:37] when we
[25:38] believed this is Paul Now using a
[25:40] similar language as he's telling the
[25:43] Thessalonians let us not sleep because
[25:46] this isn't night if it's day we ought to
[25:48] be awake and here's the here's the the
[25:51] Paul again saying it to the Romans it's
[25:53] time for us to wake out of sleep for now
[25:55] is our Salvation nearer than when we
[25:57] believed
[25:59] now what salvation is that Paul is not
[26:01] setting forth this idea that you that
[26:04] this is those who are believing and now
[26:07] there's still a Salvation to come
[26:09] related to the soul he's saying that
[26:12] those who believe the Seal of your faith
[26:14] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so if
[26:16] you truly believe you are going to be
[26:18] born again by the Holy Ghost and then
[26:21] those who are sealed into the body of
[26:22] Christ ought to be very aware of and
[26:26] conscious of the fact that that's not
[26:28] the end of salvation but that is a
[26:31] deposit or a guarantee or as the
[26:33] scripture says an Earnest of the
[26:35] fullness of redemption so when you
[26:37] recognize the time that you're living in
[26:39] there should be some sensitivity to see
[26:42] that if I was sealed by God ex date I am
[26:46] now closer to the fullness of the
[26:48] possession of what that Earnest speaks
[26:50] of than I was when I started and how
[26:53] much more should we be sensitized to
[26:56] that today as we continue in this glor
[26:58] glorious gospel awake out of sleep for
[27:00] now is our full salvation and Redemption
[27:03] nearer than when we believ so there is a
[27:06] consciousness of time there's a
[27:09] consciousness of Prophecy within the
[27:11] context of that and being conscious of
[27:13] the time knowing that now is the time
[27:16] and this is the time that we're living
[27:17] knowing the time understand the time
[27:19] knowing that it's high time to what wake
[27:22] up wake up out of sleep slumberous this
[27:26] uh drowsiness of Mind into difference
[27:28] and apathy well it doesn't really matter
[27:30] who cares and why why make that a big
[27:32] deal says it to the Ephesians Ephesians
[27:35] 5:14 wherefore he saith awake thou that
[27:38] sleepest drawing from Old Testament
[27:40] awake thou that sleepest and arise from
[27:43] the
[27:44] dead awake you know stand up prepare
[27:49] yourself be ready be alert be on guard
[27:52] be active awake thou that sleepest and
[27:54] arise there's even this symmetry where
[27:57] the the word awake comes from the root
[27:59] from to rise up to arous out of sleep
[28:02] and arise from the dead and Christ shall
[28:04] give thee light to put you in the day
[28:07] and if it's daytime the time dictates
[28:10] the
[28:11] action it what is the first thing we say
[28:14] when we text somebody after 10 o00
[28:17] usually
[28:19] right are you
[28:22] awake are you expecting a no
[28:28] the answer really what we're want to
[28:29] find out is did I wake you you know were
[28:32] you asleep because if somebody answers
[28:34] the phone or answers the text and says
[28:37] they're still sleeping then they have
[28:38] figured out
[28:40] multitasking they really have and so
[28:44] it's a it's appro it's activity that's
[28:46] appropriate for the time and the season
[28:48] well to me that is just so rich uh to
[28:50] ponder that so he says in first
[28:53] Thessalonians we could see here he's
[28:55] using this theme awake awake awake so
[28:58] the state the phrase is watch and be
[29:01] sober watch be vigilant be cautious yet
[29:05] active don't be
[29:07] paralyzed don't be so ner you know so in
[29:10] tune and so alert and so conscious that
[29:12] you don't do anything be vigilant be
[29:15] cautious yet active it says be sober
[29:18] that's calm and collected in mind and
[29:21] spirit because they that sleep sleep in
[29:24] the night but they that act act in the
[29:27] day
[29:28] so be aware of the time be aware of what
[29:30] the time requires and the need requires
[29:33] and then be active in that within that
[29:36] be at be be sure to whatever the uh time
[29:39] demands you have you put forth the
[29:41] actions and the activity that's demanded
[29:43] by the
[29:47] circumstances so be sober he says watch
[29:50] and be
[29:51] sober Peter was very fond of that phrase
[29:54] he uses it a few times in his first
[29:57] letter First Peter chapter
[29:59] 5:8 this may be one of the most uh
[30:02] identifiable ones be sober be vigilant
[30:06] it's actually the same phrase that Paul
[30:07] uses watch and be sober same words that
[30:10] are being
[30:11] used why why should I why should I be
[30:13] sober why should I be vigilant because
[30:15] your adversary the devil as a Roy and
[30:17] lion walketh about seeking whom he may
[30:20] devour so because of the circumstances
[30:23] because of the situation we ought to be
[30:25] sober be vigilant so notice how that on
[30:28] one hand he's not saying there is no
[30:32] devil right he's not saying there's no
[30:34] trouble there's no problems you don't
[30:36] have anyone that hates you everyone
[30:38] loves you nobody's putting you down
[30:41] everybody wants you to succeed and
[30:43] everybody loves you everybody likes you
[30:45] and forget you know stop singing that
[30:47] tune nobody likes me I'm going to go eat
[30:49] some worms everybody loves you everybody
[30:51] likes you you're the star of the show
[30:53] the whole world revolves around you
[30:55] Paul's not you Peter's not using that to
[30:58] kind of get that person kind of Pumped
[30:59] up and all excited to go out and face
[31:01] the
[31:02] day you know that's what happens when
[31:04] people say you can do this you can do
[31:05] this you can do this you really think I
[31:06] can jump over that yeah you can do it
[31:08] you can do it you can jump over it make
[31:09] sure you're filming this you can do it
[31:11] go for it make you can do it and someone
[31:13] yeah I can do it I can do it just runs
[31:14] head long into the wall because that was
[31:16] some kind of inflated sense it was a
[31:18] pump and dump it was got them all
[31:20] excited when the real Goods weren't
[31:21] there so he says be sober be vigilant
[31:24] because you got somebody that's taking
[31:26] advantage of every opportunity to get in
[31:29] there and weaken your mind he's looking
[31:32] for every exploitable advantage and
[31:35] he'll trip you up if he can and he'll
[31:37] flip your mind around and he'll turn
[31:39] circumstances upside down he's just
[31:41] sitting there waiting for the right
[31:42] opportunity and as soon as you let your
[31:44] guard out boom he's right there so Paul
[31:47] said you got to be you got to watch you
[31:48] got to be
[31:49] sober and and he's already used this
[31:52] phrase to a degree in Chapter 1: 13
[31:56] wherefore gird up the loin of your mind
[31:58] and one of the my most F favorite
[32:00] statements I ever heard in church was
[32:03] Loy up your
[32:05] GS wherefore G up the loins of your mind
[32:09] be sober in hope to the end for the
[32:12] grace that is to be brought to you at
[32:15] the revelation of Jesus Christ be sober
[32:18] and with soberness hope to the end for
[32:21] the grace that is to be brought to you
[32:23] at the revelation of Jesus Christ now
[32:25] hey talk about shouting words the Revel
[32:28] of Jesus Christ brings Grace Grace the
[32:31] revelation of Jesus Christ is The
[32:33] Headstone coming to the body declaring
[32:36] that the Rapture is at hand and so we're
[32:39] living in a specific season where the
[32:41] believer's disposition and their
[32:42] character is not so much in the hope of
[32:46] something but in the reality and the
[32:48] full possession and realization of it so
[32:50] if Paul could say G up the loins of your
[32:52] mind be sober and hope then we who are
[32:56] experiencing the Fulfillment of of this
[32:58] hope and it's unfolding to us in the
[33:00] revelation of Jesus Christ then there's
[33:02] a greater soberness and appropriate
[33:05] activity within the awareness of the
[33:07] reality of the Revelation that is
[33:09] unfolding before
[33:11] us praise be to
[33:13] God he visits it again in chapter 4: 7
[33:16] but the end of all things is at hand now
[33:20] they lived in this time in this day
[33:22] where they they believed this to be
[33:23] Earnest and earnestly believed that this
[33:26] was imminent but the end of all things
[33:28] is at hand well if we have a devil
[33:29] that's chasing us we have a revelation
[33:31] that's coming to us and if the end of
[33:33] all things are at hand be ye therefore
[33:35] sober and watch unto prayer sometimes we
[33:40] say well pray pray pray pray pray well
[33:42] how are you
[33:43] praying what is the praying doing to
[33:47] your spirit do we pray to become more
[33:50] numb more inactive more dull that Lord I
[33:52] don't want this to bother me I don't
[33:53] want this to bother me don't I don't
[33:54] want it to bother me I don't want it to
[33:55] bother me and maybe the Lord's saying hi
[33:57] about asking why it's bothering
[34:01] you instead of you know always saying be
[34:04] quiet be quiet that doesn't make me feel
[34:07] good try to find out why the dog's
[34:10] barking this this is a very difficult
[34:12] exercise for people who've been doing
[34:13] this for
[34:14] decades but you got to go wake up that
[34:17] beaten down very very old blood hound
[34:20] and say Hey you remember how you used to
[34:21] bark at me all the time what were you
[34:23] worried about what was it what was the
[34:27] Lord trying to show me what was he
[34:28] trying to warn me of because now I feel
[34:30] like I'm on an island I'm lost I I don't
[34:33] understand what things are happening I
[34:34] don't know why I feel the way I do and
[34:35] you have to begin to examine your
[34:36] Consciousness your conscience to
[34:38] identify what it was so this is a very
[34:42] beautiful way that he's saying this
[34:43] sober be there you therefore sober and
[34:46] watch unto prayer and above all things
[34:50] and I kept this verse in there because I
[34:51] wanted you to notice that it's not a uh
[34:53] uh to be
[34:55] complacent and kind of no energy and
[34:58] like what we really want the word to do
[34:59] is kind of lull us to
[35:01] sleep keep preaching by there and I'm
[35:03] almost
[35:07] there says and above all things have
[35:10] fervent charity among
[35:17] yourselves
[35:20] wow can I pull a Joe Biden no I won't do
[35:24] it that's just a very found statement it
[35:28] hits me a little bit differently now as
[35:30] I read it above all things have fervent
[35:32] charity among yourselves for charity
[35:35] shall cover the multitude of
[35:37] sins this is not apathy this is not
[35:39] turning a blind eye this is not saying
[35:42] it doesn't matter but this is also not
[35:44] exposing for the sake of demoralizing
[35:46] and shaming and producing guilt above
[35:49] all things have fervent charity among
[35:50] yourselves the soberness and watching
[35:52] does not produce a bunch of complacent
[35:55] dumb down mindless individual uals who
[35:58] have no emotion no joy no exuberance but
[36:00] he's saying above all things have a
[36:02] fervent charity so we can be so we can
[36:04] be watching and be sober but yet be
[36:06] passionate at the same time be energetic
[36:09] and be enthused at the same time and let
[36:12] me say this these qualities of vigilance
[36:15] and soberness are the building blocks of
[36:17] joy and peace to have
[36:20] soberness and vigilance these are the
[36:22] things that make up these are the
[36:24] ingredients for real joy and real peace
[36:27] be because it's not it's not
[36:29] disassociation this is It's we're not
[36:31] trying to create a disorder amongst
[36:33] message Believers where we' so
[36:35] disassociate from reality we're living
[36:37] in a total alternate reality in order to
[36:40] act like everything's great by my Lord K
[36:45] by completely
[36:48] disassociated living Liv in in an
[36:52] insanity but we are taught that we ought
[36:54] to be sane and sensible
[36:57] there there's something real about us to
[36:59] where we have this we're not so
[37:01] disconnected from things and things
[37:03] aren't so foreign to we don't have the
[37:04] ability to help anybody we don't have
[37:06] the ability to relate to anybody we
[37:08] don't have a feeling for people who go
[37:09] through things oh you struggle with that
[37:11] oh Ser SE if I've ever heard
[37:13] one be be have a feeling for somebody oh
[37:16] man I you know what I've never been
[37:18] through something like that before but
[37:20] that that's got to be
[37:22] horrible this is this is very heavy
[37:25] stuff when you begin to ponder it there
[37:27] must be be a vigilance and there must be
[37:29] a soberness in order for you to really
[37:31] have peace you can't have peace just
[37:33] because you have no clue that's not real
[37:35] peace that's called
[37:38] cluelessness you can't have real Joy
[37:40] just because you choose to be ignorant
[37:42] of
[37:42] everything and that's what I'm going to
[37:44] amplify for our remaining time is that
[37:47] exact mindset and how counterproductive
[37:48] it is to really being happy in the Lord
[37:52] so these uh I want you to really I want
[37:55] this to weigh in you when brother man
[37:56] says we are sober and serious I want you
[37:59] to see the importance of these
[38:01] characteristics a and and to do so I
[38:03] want you to catch the emphasis in
[38:05] requirements for church office if
[38:08] someone is going to occupy a position
[38:10] within the body of Christ there's
[38:11] certain think about this you ready
[38:14] emotional characteristics and
[38:16] characteristics that relate to someone's
[38:18] temperament in order for them to be
[38:20] effective regardless of their gift and
[38:23] their
[38:24] calling Paul does not just say hey find
[38:27] a man who's called to be a pastor and
[38:28] gifted to be a pastor and make that man
[38:30] your pastor he says look at certain
[38:32] temperaments look at certain qualities
[38:34] look at certain
[38:36] characteristics I heard one Pastor one
[38:38] time say voting a guy that owns a truck
[38:40] so he can help you move and that was
[38:43] what he thought would be important if
[38:44] you're voting on someone to be Pastor
[38:46] make sure they own a pickup truck so
[38:49] that they can help you move and that's
[38:51] like one of the main reasons why a lot
[38:52] of us don't own a pickup truck because
[38:55] we don't want people to ask us to move
[38:58] we should create an Uber for moving a
[39:00] moving company call it moover muber
[39:04] could you get on that register the
[39:05] domain right now thank you Micah could
[39:07] you put up a shopping cart we wanted to
[39:09] go ahead and start taking reservations
[39:11] excellent who's
[39:14] moving so I want you to identify the
[39:18] emphasis now when someone is going to
[39:20] occupy a position and how relevant it
[39:22] was to their effectiveness in office
[39:25] that they have a certain disposition
[39:28] everyone can relax now right because
[39:30] we're talking about the
[39:32] officers huh you can just you can just
[39:35] think about me for a moment and ask
[39:38] yourselves 1 Timothy chapter 3:2 a
[39:41] bishop then must be blameless that's why
[39:43] I always say my wife did it a bishop
[39:46] then must be blameless the husband of
[39:48] one wife these are important
[39:50] characteristics why would they ask why
[39:53] would you want a pastor to be the pastor
[39:55] of one wife because if he's going to
[39:57] teach truth he's going to teach others
[39:59] to never do such a thing as that and how
[40:01] can he teach it if his life is contrary
[40:04] to it and not undermine
[40:08] it actions will undermine your words
[40:12] when someone tells you what to do and
[40:13] they say well just do what I'm telling
[40:15] you don't do as I do do as I say that
[40:17] undermines the the discipline so that
[40:19] must be blameless the husband of one
[40:21] wife Vigilant sober notice these
[40:25] characteristics that he's using of one
[40:26] that's to be a bishop he's to be
[40:27] vigilant sober of good behavior given to
[40:30] hospitality apt to teach so we know
[40:32] sometimes it says well deacons should be
[40:34] apt to teach uh those were in the bylaws
[40:36] of the brandom Tabernacle I believe they
[40:38] had some association with uh um the
[40:40] Baptist organization he was originally
[40:43] part of and some of those things where
[40:44] they say a deacon must be apt to teach
[40:46] and some people say well brother Aaron
[40:47] the Bible says a deacon must be apt to
[40:49] teach no the bylaws of the brandom
[40:50] Tabernacle said it and the Bible says a
[40:52] bishop ought to be apt to teach now I'm
[40:54] not saying that uh uh that there's
[40:56] anything wrong with saying a deacon
[40:57] should be or having that qualification
[40:59] for a deacon but this is where we get
[41:01] the phrase from apt to teach right
[41:03] you've heard the phrase before has
[41:05] anyone told you that brother brandham
[41:07] said or the message says a deacon should
[41:09] be apt to teach you ever heard that
[41:11] before I heard some yeses I heard some
[41:13] notes should we vote on this do you have
[41:14] someone record this take the
[41:17] minutes this is where it comes from it
[41:19] comes from the scripture and then it's
[41:20] in the bylaws of the brandom Tabernacle
[41:22] it says that about a deacon but it's not
[41:24] necessarily explicitly mentioned in the
[41:26] message by preaching
[41:27] or in the
[41:29] Bible so this is said about the pastor
[41:32] he should be vigilant sober now he says
[41:35] this to Titus Titus Chapter 1: 7 and 8
[41:38] for a bishop must be blameless as the
[41:40] steward of God so these things are
[41:42] really important not self-willed not
[41:45] soon
[41:47] angry not given to whne no
[41:50] Striker these are things he can't be
[41:53] easily provoked you know going to ball
[41:55] up his fist he's going to punch you kind
[41:56] of known to be a striker a brawler not
[41:58] soon angry he's he's got a a disposition
[42:01] a temperament says you know what I I'm
[42:02] feeling a little bit excited right now
[42:04] calm yourself calm yourself don't punch
[42:06] don't hit you know and as long as he
[42:09] doesn't I guess you could say this is a
[42:10] man who can control himself no Striker
[42:12] not given to Filthy lcer but a lover of
[42:14] hospitality find that these the same
[42:16] things he said to Timothy a lover of
[42:18] Good Men he's got
[42:19] discernment he he he identifies and
[42:22] supports and is surrounded by the right
[42:24] kind of men there's just not a you real
[42:26] look at gu say kind of known by the
[42:27] people he Associates with and but he
[42:29] says and then sober just holy temperate
[42:33] so when it comes to a bishop as we would
[42:36] say taught by the message of the hour
[42:38] and the understanding of scripture this
[42:39] would be a pastor he should be vigilant
[42:41] this is attentive watchful he's risen up
[42:45] from slothfulness and laziness or
[42:46] drowsiness he's taking he's not letting
[42:49] things go and and being unattentive he's
[42:51] Vigilant and sober and mentioned again
[42:53] to tit he must be sober I'm going to get
[42:56] into the definitions of these words here
[42:58] in a moment but notice this relates to
[43:00] what we would say is the highest order
[43:03] within the church soberness is required
[43:07] but it doesn't just relate to the pastor
[43:11] look at 1 Timothy 3:1 even so must their
[43:16] wives you know who there is here the
[43:19] deacons wow this is
[43:21] amazing the pastors got to be sober and
[43:23] the Deacon's wives need to be sober
[43:27] I says their wives must their wives must
[43:29] be grave not slanderers
[43:32] sober so in the qualifications for a man
[43:34] to be a deacon he must be the husband of
[43:36] one wife but then also his wife must not
[43:39] be a
[43:40] slanderer a busy body a gossiper someone
[43:43] who's always running down and
[43:44] criticizing but she must also be sober
[43:48] now let's just for a moment just think
[43:50] about this and say why is it the way
[43:52] that it is why are things this way and I
[43:55] think that's a real popular thing today
[43:57] is um why the the the the science of why
[44:00] not how and people are saying well we
[44:02] know how things are made this way and we
[44:04] know that this is the way things are and
[44:06] this is how they make them but why did
[44:07] they start doing this to begin with you
[44:10] know why are certain things around
[44:12] whereas other things are are square with
[44:14] within a supermarket and you'll find
[44:16] that there's typically and most often a
[44:18] a an economic justification as to why
[44:21] things are the way they are relates to
[44:23] economies and efficiencies and a and
[44:26] profit margins and the best way to do
[44:27] things and best practices well in a
[44:30] spiritual sense Paul is identifying that
[44:32] if our our goal is a Rapture then
[44:34] there's a way that we can set this up
[44:37] come on now I'm G start leg
[44:40] kicking that there's a way that you can
[44:42] set this up to most efficiently bring
[44:45] the individual to perfect Faith but if
[44:47] you set it up incorrectly all you're
[44:49] doing I I don't care if the church
[44:50] thrives and builds a billion dollar
[44:53] building that's uh that everyone pays
[44:55] Bitcoin in whole amount on Sundays and
[44:58] tithes and and that that it's plated in
[45:00] Gold yeah you could have a church like
[45:02] that but if the individuals are going to
[45:04] make it in a body change this is how you
[45:05] want to set it
[45:07] up if families are going to grow in the
[45:09] fear of the Lord if children going to
[45:10] come to know God in a personal way this
[45:12] is the best way to set it up to be sure
[45:14] that human humanism a and politics and
[45:17] pretense and emotions and all sorts of
[45:19] things don't get in the way make sure
[45:21] your pastor's sober and make sure the
[45:22] Deacon's wife is
[45:25] sober make sure these characteristics
[45:27] and qualities exist and there's a lot
[45:29] more I'm just picking on
[45:31] soberness there's a lot more here so all
[45:34] of us who are not deacons wives which
[45:36] would be everybody here at this
[45:38] point and those of us who are not
[45:41] pastors can breathe a sigh of
[45:44] relief as we pick on pastors and deacons
[45:46] wives for the rest of the
[45:49] service but as he said it about a bishop
[45:52] must be vigilant and sober he continues
[45:54] in verse uh uh verse 11 how that the
[45:59] wives must also of a deacon must be
[46:01] sober in Titus Chapter 1 where he said
[46:04] that a bishop must be blameless not
[46:05] self-willed not soon angry not a striker
[46:08] uh but sober he continues in chapter two
[46:12] and says that the Aged men be
[46:16] sober so now every member of the church
[46:19] that is an aged man must be
[46:23] sober and then it also speaks in verse
[46:26] four that they the older women May teach
[46:29] the young women to be sober and the word
[46:33] that's used suggests that the aged women
[46:35] themselves being sober know how to teach
[46:37] the younger to be sober so the Aged men
[46:40] must be sober the aged women which would
[46:42] be implied even to some degree about a
[46:44] Deacon's wife must be sober and her
[46:46] being a sober woman in the church she
[46:48] also carries this disposition as a
[46:50] Deacon's wife or in the role of a
[46:51] pastor's wife you name it in any office
[46:54] because the Aged men must be sober the
[46:56] aged women must be sober the young women
[46:58] must be sober so all of us young men are
[47:00] beginning to breathe a ey of relief
[47:01] until we read verse six young men
[47:03] likewise to exhort to be sober minded in
[47:07] other words Paul has made it a necessary
[47:09] requirement in order to be a part of not
[47:12] only the body of Christ but a healthy
[47:15] contributing healthy me functioning
[47:17] member of a local body that you must be
[47:20] sober you must be sober you must be
[47:22] sober we all must be sober men women
[47:26] young old middle age we all must be
[47:32] sober all of us must be we don't just
[47:35] say well you know brother Aaron he's the
[47:37] pastor he needs to be sober and I can
[47:38] just be loose cannon over here no we all
[47:42] must be
[47:44] sober we have a kind of a saying that we
[47:46] say in our house when things are kind of
[47:48] going off the rails that wouldn't be in
[47:50] the house it would be when we were
[47:51] driving we would do tens of thousands of
[47:53] miles a year uh driving in the ministry
[47:55] which I express to somebody yesterday
[47:58] those days are over for me all right
[47:59] someone said they wanted to take my
[48:01] passport you can have it you can have it
[48:06] if someone wants to hear me preach they
[48:07] can come to Phoenix as far as I'm
[48:09] concerned and and so we would be driving
[48:12] on the road and all of a sudden you just
[48:13] realize okay we've just kind of Hit the
[48:15] Tipping Point and I would say we're all
[48:18] struggling because we were right we were
[48:21] all
[48:22] struggling and and that would identify
[48:24] that none of us kind of have the right
[48:26] attitude right now and kind of with that
[48:29] understanding
[48:30] we yeah we're all struggling and we kind
[48:32] of got along then because we all could
[48:34] identify with the fact that we're all
[48:36] struggling very wise move on my part but
[48:39] we should all say we're all
[48:42] sober that that's how we ought to say as
[48:45] a church is not just any one person is
[48:48] the sober one in the group and they're
[48:50] the ones that's grounded and they're the
[48:51] ones that are rational the Bible is
[48:53] actually taking this disposition of
[48:55] being sober and being vigilant and
[48:57] saying not only should it be in the
[48:59] highest order of the church and then in
[49:01] these other layers and I don't
[49:02] necessarily like to put them in a
[49:04] hierarchy but in these other beneficial
[49:06] mutually uh dependent offices everyone
[49:10] needs to be
[49:14] sober now let me just go through really
[49:17] there's two different words that are
[49:18] used for sober in the New
[49:22] Testament but there's a few different
[49:24] conjugations of them uh uh as they're
[49:27] used scripturally sober means to be of a
[49:29] sound mind Saye think about this in one
[49:34] senses so they have their senses active
[49:37] in being used and now being of a sound
[49:40] mind and in one senses they are
[49:42] self-controlled and able to curb their
[49:44] desires and
[49:46] impulses so if you are sober you can
[49:49] receive the correct kind of stimulus
[49:52] from things but you're appropriately
[49:57] unstimulated in terms of and not
[49:59] intoxicated or inappropriately moved to
[50:02] where you can control your impulses and
[50:04] control your response soberness means
[50:07] whoa that is scary but I'm not going to
[50:09] scream and
[50:10] run or that is an awful situation and
[50:13] the horror of this circumstance you
[50:15] realize it you you're not somebody that
[50:17] says did you hear that brother ricard's
[50:19] house burnt down
[50:21] so we're Christians you know the Lord
[50:24] gives and he takes away and kind of have
[50:26] like this Indi you think oh my goodness
[50:29] that's
[50:30] awful oh wow man oh Lord to help them to
[50:35] know that even in this there's good and
[50:38] that God can he'll bring something out
[50:40] of this and like and we even be
[50:41] sensitive and where you know what some
[50:42] of these words might be real Hollow
[50:44] right now some of these things might be
[50:45] real empty they'll probably just take it
[50:47] as rebuke if I'm texting them now well
[50:48] you know brother brandham said and you
[50:50] know this and you know that that they're
[50:51] realizing yeah I know all that I know
[50:53] all that but this is hard
[50:56] there's a soberness
[50:58] there it comes from the word to save to
[51:02] make whole and then another word to be
[51:06] understanding and perceiving safron
[51:08] comes from Soo save or to make whole in
[51:10] friend which means understanding and
[51:12] perceiving to be sober it's this
[51:15] wholeness that is both understanding and
[51:17] perceiving but then restrained at the
[51:19] same time the word is used sober to be
[51:22] of sound mind to exercise self-control
[51:25] it's also used to of Neo to be calm and
[51:27] collected in spirit to be temperate uh
[51:30] or dispassionate and it's talking about
[51:31] unreasonably it doesn't mean you can't
[51:33] have a fervent charity it doesn't mean
[51:34] you can't be excited doesn't mean you
[51:35] can't be exuberant but it's it's not the
[51:38] wrong kind of uh reaction to a certain
[51:40] stimulus or stimulated by the wrong
[51:44] things it's used also to be sober means
[51:48] to restore to his senses to restore one
[51:51] so foro restore one to his senses to
[51:53] moderate to control to curb or to
[51:55] disciple when it says that the the Elder
[51:57] women ought to teach the young women to
[52:00] be sober it says teach them to be
[52:02] restored to their senses teach them to
[52:04] to to control and to
[52:07] curb and when it's used in the sense
[52:10] that we might automatically begin to
[52:12] think used with regard to implying the
[52:14] absence from wine what is it pointing to
[52:18] the wrong kind of
[52:20] stimulation or the perverting of our
[52:23] senses by a
[52:25] stimulus that excit certain emotions and
[52:28] senses and dos
[52:30] others like there's some people that
[52:33] when when when we were in the world we
[52:34] knew people and maybe we were we were
[52:36] the angry drunk right can I get a
[52:40] witness you're exercising soberness
[52:42] today that was me that was me I was
[52:45] angry drunk no you're just kind of all
[52:48] yeah knew that guy and there's others
[52:50] who are the crying
[52:51] drunk that normally they're maybe
[52:54] they're not real talkative but all of a
[52:55] sudden you get a little alcohol
[52:58] right they just start talking away and a
[53:00] lot of times in these kind of dynamics
[53:01] that you'd have you'd have the real
[53:02] straight lace conservative the guy who
[53:04] was raised in the Bible believing Church
[53:06] never did anything wrong but now he's in
[53:07] the fraternity and he's real straight
[53:09] Lac and he was the guy that once he got
[53:11] drunk he did the most damage did the
[53:13] most awful things and the worst things
[53:14] it's like whoa he's a different person I
[53:17] even reading an article here recently
[53:19] about a guy who had a different name
[53:21] whenever he got drunk people like well
[53:23] who's Timothy well it's Paul but
[53:25] whenever he gets drunk we call Timothy I
[53:27] think might have been the actual words
[53:28] that were used and so when it's talked
[53:30] about
[53:31] soberness as relating to a stimulus like
[53:35] wine why is it called soberness because
[53:39] there's certain things that are whether
[53:41] it be edible or whether it be digestible
[53:43] whether it be you know injected or
[53:44] snorted or drank or or whatever it might
[53:47] be it actually sensitizes and stimulates
[53:50] other parts of our body but at the same
[53:53] time it has a side effect of ding other
[53:56] Parts like you realize like C certain
[53:59] painkillers it actually doesn't take
[54:02] away the pain it just kind of turns off
[54:05] the pain
[54:06] receptors like you realize your leg is
[54:08] broken no I took ibuprofen it's it's
[54:11] fine isn't that amazing what what the
[54:14] these pills can do these days I mean I
[54:16] had a broken leg I took some ibuprofen
[54:17] and now it's completely fine you have to
[54:19] be careful a lot of times with
[54:20] painkillers and numbing agents why you
[54:22] can do further damage to your body
[54:25] because you're not aware of the trauma
[54:27] and not aware of the impact that the
[54:29] problem's still there you just become
[54:31] oblivious to it so with regard to
[54:33] implying absence be sober and it implies
[54:36] an abstinence from wine there's a very
[54:38] direct specific application that we
[54:40] could use of that but now I want you to
[54:43] think in terms of the reason why that's
[54:46] used is because it relates to what real
[54:49] soberness is that you're in all of your
[54:52] senses are correctly identifying certain
[54:55] things and you're able to curb and
[54:57] control yourself at the same
[54:59] time so soberness my my my my my my
[55:03] where is the time
[55:07] gone this is
[55:09] frustrating I even used a bigger font
[55:12] with my quotes and scriptures so that I
[55:14] would cover up more pages and have the
[55:16] feeling that I had more notes than I
[55:18] actually did and I feel like such a
[55:22] failure soberness is an alertness
[55:26] soberness is an awareness I'm using the
[55:29] phrase Wide
[55:32] Awake that we ought to be wide
[55:34] awake where all of our faculties are
[55:37] unaltered all of our faculties are
[55:38] functioning and when I say that you say
[55:41] well brother Aaron I'm hard of hearing
[55:42] in one are I'm talking
[55:44] spiritually more than anything I'm
[55:45] talking about spiritually being Wide
[55:48] Awake watch and be sober the Bible says
[55:51] be sober be vigilant the Bible says let
[55:54] us be calm wise and wide awake how one
[55:58] translation actually renders it using
[56:00] one of these phrases in Peter let us be
[56:02] calm wise and wide
[56:05] awake it's the notion of being roused
[56:08] from a slumbering state it speaks of
[56:11] recover recovering from a dullness or
[56:13] being disoriented as we've been talking
[56:15] about Israel as they were in The Exodus
[56:17] they collided with Moab and whenever the
[56:19] spiritual meets the car the carinal
[56:21] there's a collision and sometimes in
[56:23] that conclusion we can be a little bit
[56:25] concussed and we we don't know how many
[56:26] fingers are being held up and we don't
[56:28] know where we are but that concussion
[56:30] has to be resolved it has to go away we
[56:33] have to pass the concussion protocol and
[56:35] be declared available to serve and to
[56:39] function and to be what God has called
[56:41] us to be we there's a time comes for all
[56:45] of us where we come off the spiritual
[56:47] injured list and we get back into AC of
[56:49] Duty because God is
[56:52] able we're not just using a bunch of
[56:54] excuses but if if you're in this state
[56:56] of disorientation and you've been struck
[56:58] and you've been wounded then there's a
[57:00] care for that there's a concern for that
[57:02] and there's those of us who can be on
[57:03] the front line fighting the battle while
[57:05] you get well in the medical
[57:07] tent and there's no jealousy or
[57:09] bitterness and there's no
[57:11] judgment because we've all been there
[57:14] before if if you say you haven't you
[57:16] just forgot or you're one of the worst
[57:18] wounded on the front
[57:20] line and it might do you some good to
[57:22] pull back and get the healing you need
[57:26] watch and be sober be sober be vigilant
[57:28] the word for Vigilant it speaks of this
[57:31] being
[57:32] awakened watch comes from the root I
[57:34] mentioned earlier to raise up to Rouse
[57:36] from sleep to the Colossians chapter 4:2
[57:39] continue in prayer and watch in the same
[57:42] with Thanksgiving
[57:45] amen now think about that continue in
[57:48] prayer and watch in the
[57:51] same it's not just a praying praying is
[57:54] not the a the activity of sticking our
[57:56] head in the
[57:57] sand and ignoring what's going
[58:00] on he's saying we ought to continue in
[58:03] prayer and
[58:05] watch continue prayer and watch in the
[58:07] same let our prayer Be watchful Let It
[58:09] Be observant Let It Be Discerning Let It
[58:12] Be Something That We're Not just praying
[58:14] and we're praying ignorantly but there's
[58:15] a soberness there there's a serious
[58:17] there there's a vigilance there's been
[58:18] an Awakening our prayer is not what we
[58:20] do to put ourselves as sleep but praying
[58:22] is what we do to put us on a greater
[58:23] state of alertness
[58:26] maybe that's why when we pray sometimes
[58:28] it's the time we take our
[58:30] nap unintentionally right I don't know
[58:33] what it was but I promised I was going
[58:34] to pray all day and I slept all day I'm
[58:36] going to go seek the Lord by
[58:40] dream now I'm I need to skip I'm going
[58:42] to skip M Mark chapter
[58:45] 14 or as we say in North Peoria Mack
[58:48] chapter 14 Mark chapter 14 I'm going to
[58:51] skip that but I want you to ponder it as
[58:52] Jesus has asked his disciple to pray and
[58:54] he says watch you and pray they fall
[58:56] asleep he's
[58:58] like can't you just stay away for an
[59:03] hour I just I want to skip it and I want
[59:07] to well let me just keep figure out
[59:10] where I'm at in all
[59:11] this
[59:13] um I'm going to skip a
[59:16] lot you ever heard the phrase ignorance
[59:19] is
[59:22] bliss if you don't know about it you
[59:24] don't have to worry about it
[59:27] you want to ask questions you don't want
[59:29] you don't really want the answer
[59:34] to I want to I want to spend more time
[59:37] next time on this phrase but there's
[59:38] actually a phrase that's used in
[59:40] literature and it was with respect to a
[59:42] totalitarian
[59:43] government and they had a phrase called
[59:46] ignorance is
[59:48] strength and it was used as a part of a
[59:53] getting the people just to never
[59:55] question question
[59:57] authority and to be able to hold two
[59:59] thoughts in your mind that were
[1:00:01] completely impossible and you wouldn't
[1:00:03] just believe that one was true and the
[1:00:06] other one was false but you could bring
[1:00:07] yourself to believe that both were true
[1:00:10] even though you knew they weren't talk
[1:00:12] about a crazy way the or Willian a
[1:00:16] dystopian future that was being talked
[1:00:18] about the double think that people could
[1:00:21] say absolutely yeah that's true I
[1:00:22] believe this and then something be done
[1:00:24] or said that's AB absolutely contrary to
[1:00:27] that and they yeah but that's true and
[1:00:29] that's good
[1:00:30] too and to get to that point where the
[1:00:34] people didn't just accept it but they
[1:00:36] literally believed that 2 plus 2 equals
[1:00:38] 5 and in in this novel and I find myself
[1:00:41] getting pulled right into it to share
[1:00:42] more of it but they had this phrase
[1:00:44] ignorant is strength and it was joined
[1:00:46] with war is
[1:00:48] Peace and Freedom is
[1:00:52] slavery to get the people to believe
[1:00:54] that if you're constantly in the state
[1:00:55] of War that's peace and to believe that
[1:00:57] if you're enslaved that's actually
[1:00:59] freedom and so in order to really
[1:01:00] complete the full bringing people under
[1:01:04] control and subjugating them to to
[1:01:06] totalitarian way of thinking they had to
[1:01:09] take them to believe that ignorance is
[1:01:11] strength if you're ignorant that is a
[1:01:20] strength I I want you to think let me
[1:01:23] say it this way
[1:01:31] I um I'm just being very very purposeful
[1:01:35] right
[1:01:37] now and very deliberate in what I choose
[1:01:39] to say because I I I want to get into
[1:01:41] this in Greater detail perhaps next
[1:01:44] Sunday but what's being identified in
[1:01:46] this natural thing I'm using I'm looking
[1:01:48] at a lit literary uh a book that was
[1:01:51] written that described these things and
[1:01:52] as a response to Rising socialism and
[1:01:55] communism
[1:01:56] and maybe some commentary even on
[1:01:58] Nazism and it was it spoke of a
[1:02:02] totalitarian government which is a
[1:02:03] system of government that is centralized
[1:02:05] in dictatorial it's you know centered
[1:02:08] around a dictator dictatorial and
[1:02:11] requires complete subservience to the
[1:02:15] state complete total subservience to the
[1:02:18] state to the government to the head that
[1:02:20] everything had to be completely
[1:02:21] subservient now I could take more time
[1:02:24] getting into the specifics of the
[1:02:25] natural phenomena or even this phenomena
[1:02:27] in literature but let me just say it
[1:02:29] perfectly describes Satan's
[1:02:31] kingdom Satan's kingdom can only be
[1:02:33] established through lies and deceit and
[1:02:36] so for there to be a totalitarian
[1:02:38] government the people have to think that
[1:02:40] war is peace freedom is slavery and that
[1:02:42] ignorance is strength because you have
[1:02:44] to make them ignorant you have to get
[1:02:46] them to believe a lie you have to get
[1:02:48] them to be able to accept double think
[1:02:49] and news speak to say well that's true
[1:02:51] but this is also true that if someone
[1:02:53] was in their right mind they'd say no
[1:02:55] they both can't can't be true freedom is
[1:02:57] not slavery war is not peace ignorance
[1:03:00] is not strength and there's a way of War
[1:03:02] of Attrition to break a person down for
[1:03:05] they exist within a man-made system and
[1:03:08] a cult of personality and say well yeah
[1:03:11] that's true but this is also true and
[1:03:12] somehow they both can AG exist within a
[1:03:15] person's mind is absolutely true when
[1:03:18] they both are completely
[1:03:20] incompatible and that's how Satan
[1:03:22] accomplishes his agenda that's Satan's
[1:03:24] kingdom that's Satan's way that is
[1:03:26] Satan's order and his order is a
[1:03:28] perversion of God's order so Satan
[1:03:31] establishes his kingdom upon lies and
[1:03:33] deceits and that ignorant strength but
[1:03:36] God establishes his kingdom in
[1:03:39] truth he says and you shall know the
[1:03:42] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:03:45] let me say this that Joy is not
[1:03:48] possible without
[1:03:52] truth he said Joy is not only impossible
[1:03:55] with truth is the most important
[1:03:57] resource for it you shall know the truth
[1:04:00] and the truth shall make you free your
[1:04:02] joy can't be prefaced by a lie your joy
[1:04:04] can't be prefaced on a half truth in
[1:04:06] order for you to have full Joy it has to
[1:04:08] be full
[1:04:10] knowing fully aware fully cognizant not
[1:04:14] ignorant but willful ignorance ignores
[1:04:17] discomforts ignores
[1:04:21] inconsistencies disregards pain in order
[1:04:23] to force
[1:04:24] Harmony in order to make the person feel
[1:04:27] stable in order to make the person feel
[1:04:29] safe and feel
[1:04:30] secure as one phrase is if one is not
[1:04:33] concerned with truth one's existence
[1:04:36] assumes an unreflective
[1:04:41] contentment when you stop caring about
[1:04:43] the
[1:04:44] truth and you care more about
[1:04:47] church you'll have an unreflective
[1:04:49] contentment about everything that goes
[1:04:52] on when you stop loving truth in
[1:04:55] believing in truth more than just
[1:04:57] position and power and politics and
[1:04:59] preest when you stop loving truth you
[1:05:02] may say you're happy but it's prefaced
[1:05:04] on ignorance is strength war is
[1:05:08] peace and you know you know what uh part
[1:05:10] of the party that uh established the The
[1:05:12] Motto ignorance is truth the ministry or
[1:05:15] ignorance is strength the ministry of
[1:05:17] Truth in this book that spent engaged
[1:05:20] its whole time in revising history to
[1:05:22] always fit the current Party Line go
[1:05:25] back and change things change the order
[1:05:28] change the history change the theology
[1:05:30] change the beliefs called the ministry
[1:05:32] of truth but it's dedicated to changing
[1:05:36] things into a lie there was the ministry
[1:05:38] of love you know what its sole function
[1:05:40] was to torture people who did
[1:05:42] Love there was the ministry of Peace you
[1:05:44] know what it sole goal was to perpetuate
[1:05:47] War now you say well brother Aaron that
[1:05:49] that that's a fantastic novel I had to
[1:05:50] read that in college use some
[1:05:53] discernment and recognize how that not
[1:05:55] only is that a critique of uh certain
[1:05:58] types of government and structure in the
[1:06:00] natural world but it could be used just
[1:06:02] as much as a criticism of what
[1:06:04] Christianity has become and what church
[1:06:07] has become and how we become sheeple or
[1:06:10] sheep and not in a good
[1:06:14] sense because God's kingdom must be
[1:06:16] established on
[1:06:20] truth and sometimes people say that
[1:06:22] they're happy but there's the Bible says
[1:06:24] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:06:25] shall make you free people are not happy
[1:06:27] they're just unaware at best or
[1:06:30] willfully ignorant at
[1:06:32] worst they just don't really
[1:06:36] know point I'm trying to make as I need
[1:06:38] to move on and I'll amplify this further
[1:06:40] if the Lord would lead me to the world
[1:06:43] society structures governments Powers
[1:06:45] will try to manufacture happiness
[1:06:48] through
[1:06:49] ignorance through
[1:06:52] dullness that that in order to have
[1:06:54] control
[1:06:56] complete subservice to the system
[1:06:59] complete uh uh uh faithfulness
[1:07:01] unquestioned authority to an order to a
[1:07:05] structure but Paul says in 1 Corinthians
[1:07:07] chapter 15:
[1:07:15] 33-34 he says be not deceived evil
[1:07:19] Communications corrupt good
[1:07:21] manners awake to righteousness and sin
[1:07:25] can
[1:07:27] not in order to to walk in perfect faith
[1:07:30] in order to have this nature and
[1:07:33] character on display we have to awake to
[1:07:38] righteousness for some have not the
[1:07:40] knowledge of God and I speak this to
[1:07:42] your shame he's saiding return to
[1:07:45] soberness of
[1:07:46] Mind return oneself from a drunkenness
[1:07:49] from an intoxication from an influence
[1:07:51] from a power that's perverted your
[1:07:53] understanding perverted your discipline
[1:07:55] perverted verted your relationship to
[1:07:56] Christ perverted your relationship to
[1:07:58] one another awake to righteousness and
[1:08:00] sin not get a hold of yourselves Shake
[1:08:02] yourselves Corinthians do you not
[1:08:03] realize you've been overcome with the
[1:08:05] wrong things awake to righteousness then
[1:08:07] you can act the right way it's not a
[1:08:09] matter of dulling our senses and
[1:08:11] becoming subject to the wrong kind of
[1:08:13] ideals in order for there to be order
[1:08:15] and the appearance of Harmony and
[1:08:17] everyone is happy right everyone is
[1:08:18] happy everyone's happy everyone say
[1:08:21] yes but a true Liberation by truth we
[1:08:24] know the truth the truth made us free
[1:08:26] you do realize this yes I know it
[1:08:28] despite my knowledge of that I found
[1:08:30] something deeper I found something
[1:08:31] greater yes I know yes I know yes I know
[1:08:33] and there doesn't have to be all these
[1:08:35] mechanisms at work trying to produce a
[1:08:37] forced obedience at the end of the day
[1:08:39] to produce a forced
[1:08:41] happiness I hope that you can be uh
[1:08:44] spiritual about this because ignorance
[1:08:46] is not Bliss that's a
[1:08:50] lie and in Luke 15: 17 to 18 it tells
[1:08:55] the story about the prodical
[1:08:57] son and in this story he had wasted all
[1:09:01] his
[1:09:03] living and and I imagine that when he be
[1:09:05] did it at the beginning there might have
[1:09:07] been part of his conscience that told
[1:09:08] him you know you're not doing the right
[1:09:09] thing but his dad lets him go and takes
[1:09:11] his part of his inheritance and he goes
[1:09:14] and he Wast all of it and riotous living
[1:09:16] and then having lost all of his
[1:09:17] substance he has to become a slave in a
[1:09:20] foreign country in order to get some
[1:09:22] sort of renumeration or income or be
[1:09:24] able to survive and he's out feeding
[1:09:26] pigs and I imagine by that point his
[1:09:28] mind had become so dull and so hardened
[1:09:30] and he runs so far from conviction he's
[1:09:32] this numb person existing in this swine
[1:09:35] pit in there wanting to eat the husk and
[1:09:38] eat the things that pigs eat and then it
[1:09:39] says in verse 17 and when he came to
[1:09:43] himself you know what that this phrase
[1:09:46] means he sobered
[1:09:48] up whatever had been influencing him
[1:09:51] before if it was bitterness towards his
[1:09:52] dad if it was jealousy of his brother if
[1:09:55] it if it was ambition if it was if it
[1:09:57] was alcohol and all the influences of
[1:09:59] the world and he had numbed himself and
[1:10:01] become dull he says and he came to his
[1:10:03] self it means he sobered up he came to
[1:10:05] his
[1:10:06] senses when he began to think
[1:10:09] clearly when he began to think
[1:10:11] appropriately when he was aware not only
[1:10:14] of his circumstances but aware of other
[1:10:16] opportunities and other circumstan when
[1:10:17] he came to himself notice how clear he
[1:10:19] begins to think how many hired Servants
[1:10:21] of my fathers have bred enough in
[1:10:23] Despair and I perish with hunger
[1:10:26] here's here's the awaking this is the
[1:10:29] waking up and the vigilance I will
[1:10:32] arise how wide awake would he he been if
[1:10:35] he thought that and stayed in the hog
[1:10:37] pin not completely not totally he still
[1:10:40] would have been a little bit drunk he
[1:10:41] still would have been a little bit
[1:10:42] intoxicated he still would have been
[1:10:44] laboring under certain hindrances but
[1:10:45] when he came to himself fully came to
[1:10:47] himself I will arise and go to my father
[1:10:49] and I will say unto him noce the
[1:10:51] evidence of a sober mind the appropriate
[1:10:54] thought father I have sinned against
[1:10:56] heaven and before thee and in no more
[1:10:58] worthy to be called thy son make me as
[1:11:00] one of thy hired
[1:11:02] servants and it was when he came to
[1:11:05] himself and arose from that state and
[1:11:08] came to the father in the appropriate
[1:11:10] state of mind that he experienced the
[1:11:12] feast and the celebration of one that
[1:11:14] was being restored and I want you to
[1:11:16] ponder this I want him to come to a
[1:11:18] place of finishing today that in order
[1:11:21] for him he would have never experienced
[1:11:23] the joy of restoration if he had not
[1:11:25] first experienced the horrors of
[1:11:27] realizing his
[1:11:28] sin he never could have enjoyed
[1:11:31] restoration he never could have enjoyed
[1:11:33] Redemption he never would have had that
[1:11:35] robe he never would have had that ring
[1:11:37] he never would have had that Feast
[1:11:38] unless he first experienced the full
[1:11:41] and the weight and the reality of
[1:11:44] what he had
[1:11:47] done he didn't get drunk one day off the
[1:11:50] strongest
[1:11:51] liquor and go back to his father and say
[1:11:55] you know give me my room
[1:11:57] back and the law it says I'm your son no
[1:12:00] matter what let me come back some sort
[1:12:04] of presumption and arrogance but no he
[1:12:06] had to First with the sanness of Mind in
[1:12:09] his emotions feel the whr of sin and
[1:12:11] realizing it once he realized that in
[1:12:13] the soberness of mind he went to the one
[1:12:16] who could remedy it he had the
[1:12:17] appropriate humility he had the right
[1:12:19] kind of attitude in light of the
[1:12:20] circumstances father I'm not worthy to
[1:12:22] become I'm not worthy to be your son let
[1:12:24] me be a servant and now notice the
[1:12:26] father's response to his sober son who's
[1:12:29] obviously no longer thinking with the
[1:12:31] same mind that caused him to go he sees
[1:12:34] it remedied he sees it changed he could
[1:12:37] have said the son that left was half
[1:12:38] dead already with a mindset like that
[1:12:40] but he went out and fully died but now
[1:12:42] he saw a son that was yet dead but now
[1:12:45] is alive because he's come back to his
[1:12:47] mind he has a son that he had lost the
[1:12:49] enjoyment of long before he ever took
[1:12:51] that napsack in the inheritance and ran
[1:12:53] out of the world and once the son soed
[1:12:55] up the father got his son
[1:12:58] back let me say though they can have
[1:13:00] application in a lot of different ways
[1:13:02] without the horrors of sin he would have
[1:13:05] never ever ever sought the Comforts of
[1:13:09] home without the horrors of what he'
[1:13:11] done he would have never longed for the
[1:13:13] Forgiveness of a
[1:13:15] father does that not speak to that
[1:13:17] subject of
[1:13:19] numb does not help us understand what it
[1:13:21] would mean to be wide
[1:13:23] awake pure joy is found in being Wide
[1:13:28] Awake pure joy is found in a healthy
[1:13:31] conscience and being fully
[1:13:35] conscious we can experience the calm
[1:13:37] amid a
[1:13:39] storm we
[1:13:41] can we can experience peace in the
[1:13:43] middle of
[1:13:45] chaos we don't console ourselves with a
[1:13:48] delusion we don't Comfort ourselves with
[1:13:50] an
[1:13:51] illusion we know the truth we know the
[1:13:54] reality
[1:13:55] we know what's going on we can
[1:13:57] appreciate these different things so let
[1:14:00] me say this this is how it struck me so
[1:14:02] hard yesterday our joy is
[1:14:06] irrational to the world and I'm going to
[1:14:08] end on this I'm skipping several
[1:14:09] scriptures here so we're probably just
[1:14:10] going to come to that last statement our
[1:14:13] joy is
[1:14:15] irrational but only to the
[1:14:18] world because our joy is not based on
[1:14:22] ignorance we're not believing ignorance
[1:14:24] is bliss
[1:14:25] we don't believe that ignorance is
[1:14:27] strength we have a contentment that
[1:14:29] defies human
[1:14:30] nature we we have a peace that as the
[1:14:33] Bible says is beyond our
[1:14:35] understanding and what does that mean it
[1:14:37] doesn't mean a
[1:14:40] disassociation it doesn't mean a
[1:14:42] Detachment to have a peace that passes
[1:14:45] understanding doesn't mean that you pass
[1:14:46] from a sanness and sensibilities and you
[1:14:48] no longer know and you're now ignorant
[1:14:50] and you're dumbed down and you're D it's
[1:14:52] like you know this is a Raging Sea you
[1:14:55] you know that this is bad you know that
[1:14:57] that is not good you know the
[1:14:58] consequences of that you feel the
[1:15:00] buffeting you feel the hate you feel the
[1:15:03] persecution you feel the sorrow you feel
[1:15:05] the grief you it's in other words you're
[1:15:07] not ignorant say I don't want to know I
[1:15:08] don't want to know too late I already
[1:15:10] know cat out of the bag I'm fully aware
[1:15:13] and we're not beating ourselves up about
[1:15:15] the fact that we know this and we're
[1:15:16] conscious of that is that not where the
[1:15:19] devil tries to get us well if you really
[1:15:21] had Faith you wouldn't even know it hurt
[1:15:24] what come on where we get that
[1:15:27] idea brother BR even talking about being
[1:15:29] able to overcome something he says oh
[1:15:32] you you see you say you don't have
[1:15:33] cancer he says yes you
[1:15:35] do how you going to believe to be healed
[1:15:37] from it if you want to keep denying
[1:15:38] you've got it how is a sinner going to
[1:15:41] be in a sinful State say I'm Justified
[1:15:43] I'm Justified I'm Justified and somehow
[1:15:44] experience justification doesn't work
[1:15:47] that
[1:15:48] way so our our our peace in this world
[1:15:51] is not based upon a lie or a delusion
[1:15:55] you remember where we ended last time on
[1:15:57] how that Paul was talking about how that
[1:15:59] and we were using the emphasis and the
[1:16:01] point to say that as he was using the
[1:16:03] scripture in meets he was showing us
[1:16:06] that things that are not true defiles a
[1:16:08] believer's
[1:16:09] conscience that here's a born again holy
[1:16:11] spirit filled believer but yet him
[1:16:14] believing in something that was a lie
[1:16:16] would defile his
[1:16:18] conscience and how that God wants to
[1:16:21] deal with the untruths God wants to deal
[1:16:23] with the lie so you say well brother
[1:16:25] Aaron what does this mean in the
[1:16:26] practical application because there's
[1:16:28] certain things I can't deny there's
[1:16:30] certain things that I know are true but
[1:16:32] this is where we need the whole truth
[1:16:34] that I was a sinner but now you're saved
[1:16:37] I did it but in his mind you never did
[1:16:39] it in the first place and there's a word
[1:16:41] answer to any lie anything that the
[1:16:44] devil can bring up and that's what
[1:16:46] grounds Us in true Joy is not denying
[1:16:49] what has been but in accepting your appr
[1:16:52] appropriation or the very thing that
[1:16:54] remedies it
[1:16:56] you can have perfect faith and accept
[1:16:58] the fact that you're
[1:17:00] sick but perfect faith is I believe I am
[1:17:04] healed because think about isn't what
[1:17:06] the that's exactly what the world would
[1:17:07] do you have cancer well I don't have
[1:17:09] cancer I don't have cancer everybody's
[1:17:11] trying to tell you you've got cancer I
[1:17:12] don't have cancer I don't have cancer
[1:17:13] you believe it you go in you get a you
[1:17:15] get an MRI they do a scan they do a
[1:17:17] blood test and the doctor says you don't
[1:17:18] have cancer and you go I'm Healed he's
[1:17:20] like nuh no uhuh you never had to begin
[1:17:22] that you're like no no no I was healed
[1:17:25] no you told me yourself you didn't have
[1:17:26] it and guess what you're right you beat
[1:17:29] the doctors you never even had cancer to
[1:17:30] begin with
[1:17:32] Checkmate
[1:17:34] right the bride's the bride's basis is
[1:17:37] not a lie she's not standing on some
[1:17:40] half truth she's not the system of some
[1:17:43] party that's made her subservient just
[1:17:45] to believe things just because she's
[1:17:47] told these things she
[1:17:49] knows she's fully aware she's not she's
[1:17:53] not a Christ without the knowledge of a
[1:17:54] a Judas just loving everybody and
[1:17:56] everything's awesome she knows who the
[1:17:57] Judas is but nobody can
[1:18:01] tell because she doesn't call them
[1:18:04] out should I have to make a public scene
[1:18:06] or an
[1:18:08] example that may just wet your whistle
[1:18:10] for the next one wide awake what does
[1:18:13] brother brandham say about the world
[1:18:14] they have not recognized The Awakening
[1:18:18] of the
[1:18:20] Bride they have not recognized The
[1:18:23] Awakening of the Bride
[1:18:26] I have a personal sensitivity to the way
[1:18:28] that this message can be used as a
[1:18:30] three-pointed club to beat up the bride
[1:18:33] right how many have experienced that
[1:18:35] like our very liberators are using the
[1:18:38] club to beat us up you're the bride
[1:18:39] you're the bride of Christ like really
[1:18:41] is this a is this how it's supposed to
[1:18:44] feel
[1:18:48] well I would
[1:18:50] say to some degree and I don't mean this
[1:18:53] in other words that I become the the uh
[1:18:56] the abuser in this statement but have we
[1:18:59] recognized
[1:19:01] it if they haven't recognized The
[1:19:04] Awakening of the bride and we can say
[1:19:06] all day long that they haven't
[1:19:08] recognized it but are we Wide
[1:19:10] Awake are we willing to be honest with
[1:19:13] ourselves are we willing to face things
[1:19:15] and give them an honest look and look at
[1:19:16] it and be honest with ourselves because
[1:19:18] the bride doesn't stick her head in the
[1:19:20] sand and hide herself oh no no no no
[1:19:23] this isn't Le to see know this this
[1:19:24] isn't L to see no this isn't true it
[1:19:26] isn't real this doesn't happen she
[1:19:29] knows she knows there's a storm she
[1:19:31] knows it's a dark day she knows she's
[1:19:33] fully aware they have not recognized The
[1:19:36] Awakening of the Bride have
[1:19:38] we have we recognized
[1:19:41] it I was overwhelmed with this feeling
[1:19:44] not for myself
[1:19:47] but I felt the the weight of
[1:19:50] it of this attitude of how one could
[1:19:53] doesn't want to wake up in
[1:19:55] someone anybody ever experienced that I
[1:19:58] know what it feels like you finally go
[1:20:00] to sleep and once you're finally asleep
[1:20:02] you don't want to wake up again because
[1:20:04] what happens when you wake
[1:20:05] up
[1:20:09] reality and and I got to face it now I I
[1:20:14] and you just wish that you could sleep
[1:20:15] it off or stay in
[1:20:17] bed but let me say this I'm speaking to
[1:20:21] you
[1:20:22] today straight from the Throne of God
[1:20:25] there should be no fear in Remembering
[1:20:26] your
[1:20:28] past fully understanding your present
[1:20:31] and looking forward to your
[1:20:34] future should be no fear in Remembering
[1:20:36] your past fully understanding your
[1:20:39] present and looking forward to your
[1:20:42] future I can look back upon my
[1:20:45] past I can experience my present and
[1:20:48] face my future without
[1:20:50] fear because with his love I can bravely
[1:20:53] endure past present
[1:20:56] future why because my happiness is not
[1:20:59] built on a
[1:21:00] Li and my happiness cannot be taken away
[1:21:03] by
[1:21:05] truth think about it no matter how
[1:21:09] difficult and inconvenient the truth may
[1:21:11] be I hope you realize just how
[1:21:13] liberating this is no matter how
[1:21:16] difficult and inconvenient a truth may
[1:21:18] be it cannot rob you of the Lord's joy
[1:21:22] and if you experience some discomfort or
[1:21:24] the loss of happiness you realize that's
[1:21:26] merely a state of mind and that there's
[1:21:29] got to be a word answered to that
[1:21:31] condition in order to fill the void that
[1:21:34] this truth has now created because now
[1:21:36] there's a vacuum in my mind a vacuum in
[1:21:38] My Flesh and now I'm feeling lost and
[1:21:40] I'm feeling unstable and there was now
[1:21:42] that this lie has been taken away and
[1:21:44] this truth has driven this away and this
[1:21:46] truth has created weakness oh I I feel
[1:21:48] like I'm I'm lost I feel like I I'm
[1:21:50] without an anchor and that's when the
[1:21:52] Lord says I'm that I'm the one that
[1:21:55] fills the void I'm the one that's got to
[1:21:57] answer that need I'm the one that you
[1:21:59] were kept away from based upon that
[1:22:02] listen we are going to be healed when we
[1:22:04] acknowledge that we're sick but he's the
[1:22:06] Healer we're going to be set free when
[1:22:09] we acknowledge we are in bondage but
[1:22:11] he's the deliverer there is no hopeless
[1:22:14] case there is no situation too far God
[1:22:18] why we believe that it's shalom it's
[1:22:21] good morning my healer my deliverer my
[1:22:24] Liber is
[1:22:26] here I do not have to fear past present
[1:22:30] or
[1:22:31] future in other words I'm not
[1:22:34] asleep I'm wide
[1:22:36] awake and there's nothing I'm afraid of
[1:22:39] in this state of
[1:22:41] awareness I I trust I I I I I feel like
[1:22:44] I just kind of made an absolute mess of
[1:22:46] where I was going because of how long I
[1:22:47] was in the outset but I blame you
[1:22:49] because you guys are pulling hard this
[1:22:51] morning fully blame you I feel Justified
[1:22:54] because you guys are hungry as can be
[1:22:57] maybe the time between Wednesday and
[1:22:59] Sunday is too
[1:23:01] long but with this kind of hungry heart
[1:23:04] you know you've got to say say what God
[1:23:06] wants you to say and I feel so impressed
[1:23:10] to tell you don't be afraid to wake
[1:23:14] up don't be able to be afraid to face
[1:23:17] realities don't be afraid to face
[1:23:20] consequences don't be afraid because
[1:23:23] there's a word there
[1:23:25] there's a word there that's going to
[1:23:26] meet the inefficiency there's a word
[1:23:28] there that's going to meet you in your
[1:23:29] need there's a word there that when you
[1:23:30] feel that you could be Forsaken and cast
[1:23:32] out there's a word there to welcome
[1:23:38] you they have not
[1:23:40] recognized The Awakening of the
[1:23:44] Bride then this is where the attack
[1:23:48] is I'm just going to close on that I'll
[1:23:50] save the remainder for another time but
[1:23:53] let me say that that's where the attack
[1:23:57] is Satan doesn't want you to wake
[1:24:03] up let's stand to our feet
[1:24:33] could we bow our heads for a word of
[1:24:36] prayer this is the opportunity I believe
[1:24:38] that as we've been ministering you've
[1:24:40] been introspective and you've been
[1:24:42] looking
[1:24:48] inward I believe that you've
[1:24:51] been uh processing it for for
[1:24:55] yourself I love how
[1:24:59] um in your heart you have
[1:25:04] uh you have today not merely listened to
[1:25:07] a sermon to
[1:25:10] understand how it was put together and
[1:25:12] whether or not there was a complete
[1:25:13] thought but you in you in you actually
[1:25:15] entered into this in a way that you felt
[1:25:17] like the Lord was counseling with your
[1:25:20] heart and so with that type of
[1:25:24] uh Dynamic could you now with heads
[1:25:27] bowed speak to your
[1:25:30] counselor open up your heart to
[1:25:34] him it's an amazing
[1:25:38] Dynamic how in the world you go
[1:25:41] to a doctor who diagnoses but then send
[1:25:44] you to another one that
[1:25:46] treats who send you to another one to
[1:25:48] rehabilitate
[1:25:49] you and you just get passed from one
[1:25:52] specialty to another sometimes you can't
[1:25:54] even see the specialist until you've
[1:25:56] seen the general
[1:25:57] practitioner and sometimes you need to
[1:25:59] go get second opinions you go see this
[1:26:02] one they say well I diagnose you with
[1:26:03] this condition I need to prescribe you
[1:26:06] medication so then you have to go to a
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:14] pharmacist forget about all
[1:26:16] that you're in his care
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:20] today he
[1:26:22] diagnoses he prescribes
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:26] he identifies he
[1:26:29] remedies the same one that tells you you
[1:26:31] need surgery is performing it
[1:26:35] already the same one that tells you you
[1:26:37] need healing healed you
[1:26:39] already the same one that awakened you
[1:26:42] to a discomfort today is the same one
[1:26:44] that comforts you you're not being
[1:26:47] handed off
[1:26:49] today you do not have to leave church
[1:26:52] today with a list of of things that you
[1:26:54] can do better to make things
[1:26:58] work he do even schedule a follow-up
[1:27:01] appointment you know what he says let's
[1:27:02] do this
[1:27:05] together and he just kind of take you by
[1:27:07] the hand the way that he does and says
[1:27:08] let's go you got
[1:27:11] this CU he's with you even in you until
[1:27:13] the
[1:27:15] end and with him by my
[1:27:18] side and if I could be wide awake to
[1:27:22] what he's done I'm not not afraid to
[1:27:24] wake up to a world that's
[1:27:27] dark I'm not afraid to wake up to the
[1:27:30] horrors of my past I'm not afraid to
[1:27:31] wake up to the challenges that I face
[1:27:34] because this Bliss is not
[1:27:36] ignorance This Joy is not delusion it's
[1:27:40] pure and all knowing amen could you
[1:27:44] accept him
[1:27:45] today could you accept him as your
[1:27:47] healthc care

[1:27:50] Soul Provider your soul health care

[1:28:08] need heart
[1:28:10] surgery today I lift my hands before a
[1:28:13] loving
[1:28:14] father I'm separating myself from the
[1:28:16] abuses of other fathers I'm separating
[1:28:18] myself from the Dynamics of church and
[1:28:20] pastor and church order and I've made
[1:28:23] myself feel important because I fit
[1:28:25] within the structure of a local church
[1:28:28] and today I realize I'm important
[1:28:30] because I fit within his
[1:28:32] kingdom and that's what makes me who I
[1:28:35] am is my relationship to Christ would
[1:28:37] you accept it today today listen I
[1:28:39] believe that today there's people who
[1:28:43] don't have to be afraid to wake up
[1:28:46] anymore accept it in the name of the
