TRANSCRIPT
========================================
genesis chapter 11 verse 1 it might seem a little odd because we're continuing on supreme faith revealed in abraham but i want to just slow down tonight and be a very very simple on identifying some characteristics that god uses to set up the life of abraham and it says and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech if you looked at chapter 10 it it outlines noah's descendants and his three sons those are kind of what chapter 10 sets forth as japath ham and shem's descendants and now it's saying that the whole earth is of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they from order and they said go too let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men build in the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth and then it transitions these are the generations of shem hashem was 100 years old and begat our facts said two years after the flood let's pray our gracious heavenly father we're so happy to be in your presence this evening just a wonderful group a wonderful gathering we've been blessed by the singing by the special lord just even the ministering gifts amongst us and the love of coming this evening and and showing their support and their love lord we're just blessed by your presence we're blessed by the voices that have been raised and lord we're now excited about what your word holds for us tonight though we could read this bible a thousand times or there's a thousand different touches and a thousand different revelations and a thousand different uplift upliftings that we could receive from your word so tonight lord though this may be the 10 000th service for somebody and though this may be hundreds of hours that we put in together as a church lord it's still fresh it's still new to us and so we pray that you come break the bread of life to speak to us in a powerful way take control of this service for your glory as we all just relax in your presence and rest in your word tonight in the name of lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you you can be seated continue on the subject of supreme faith revealed in abraham and kind of what we've been identifying is how that god's dealings with abraham help us to understand our faith and by recognizing that abraham's supreme faith that he comes to in genesis chapter 22 is the product of god developing that faith and cultivating that faith it was the process not only of election but god appearing to him many times revealing himself revealing his character expanding on the promise abraham i'm going to do this and then he identifies with more specificity as he walks with god uh what those things are so we kind of look to looking at abraham to help us understand how that rapturing faith is going to be cultivated by the word of god in our hearts in the end time and i want to back up to kind of a theme that we have a subject that we a principle that we identified in the first couple services on this series is that in choosing abraham and i just want to do this very briefly in choosing abraham god intended to set forth abraham as an example and it was his intent to use his life to portray the plan of salvation now i'm not wanting to touch on this right now but it just it's at the forefront of what's in my burden is really when you come to abraham's life this is god picking up genesis chapter 3 verse 15 that there's going to be a seed come see to the woman and so this is god wanting to not only fulfill prophecy but in this prophet's life and not only to bring genesis 3 15 to past he's wanting to use this character abraham to portray his plan of salvation so you could actually look into his life and by looking at his life you could see something mirrored back that god will do in your life and brother branham makes this statement very brief statement that i'm pulling out of the sermon abraham's grace covenant he says what is he doing and he's referring to very specific instance in scripture i believe it's even genesis chapter 18. he says he's showing to abraham this what he's going to do to abraham's seed and we saw that in several different statements we used last month and how that um several services ago how that god was going to use abraham as an example and he's an example to the believer and he's determined to be an example of the believer today an example of that faith and in the book of romans you'll find that paul the central character to paul expressing the plan of salvation and grace and faith he uses abraham and in romans chapter 4 verse 1 he says what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found and he's asking this question and i'm not maybe going to help you to understand that verse any with any greater clarity but just use it to show that here in romans chapter 4 paul's talking about abraham our father and he uses him as a central figure and an example of salvation by faith and what he's doing is he's identifying a pattern that if this is our father abraham and this is how god dealt with abraham he said he's identifying if this is what god did to the father this is what god does to the children and he uses him as an example that was not abraham justified by faith and wasn't he called by grace and did he do this and didn't he do that and he's expressing this and he says in the same chapter in verse 16 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all so abraham is the father of us all and being the father he's one that affords an example because that's what fathers ought to be they ought to be examples and and and there's even paul expresses the ideal that we would be followers of god as dear children so it's that that father relationship he's the example he's a forerunner and so paul is expressing how using abraham as a central figure an example of salvation by faith he's using a first example of grace he's using him as this pattern that god wanted to establish and he's identifying it and so this is again this is just kind of review uh to set the stage for a very specific thought tonight but i'm wanting to remind you that the exercise of looking at abraham's life is to help us to yield to god's process to produce a rapturing faith in our hearts and when i say rapturing faith in our hearts i believe that that is to put us into a position to believe that we have power to bind the greatest to the least so when we're we're not talking about just living completely defeated uh miserable lives and then one day just be like all right fine i've had enough of them to change my body but to begin to exercise faith to have victories in all sorts of areas of our lives whether it be mental and physical financial relationships estrangement to see health restored to our bodies to see family members restored to the faith and all sorts of exercises of our faith that we could have as we come into a real mature love of god in a real mature faith and so abraham is an example in the message abraham and his seed after him brother brahm says what he did to abraham by justification he did to his seed what he did to abraham through sanctification separation when he did he did the same thing when the church separates itself from all the things of the world then god applies the blood to it i isolated this particular one from a dozen or so where brother branham is using abraham and there was a few that seemed to be maybe more particular on brother branham identifying the process of justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost it's already foreshadowed in abraham he uses in one place when he crossed over the river that that was a type of baptism and justification and he and he uses different examples in abraham's life to say look what abraham's doing his life is telling a story that we can relate to in our spiritual journey and he uses it here that what he did to abraham by justification he did to his seed and so what he does to abraham in these phases of his life and these stages of his journey though it might not be perfectly chronological to our stages and though we can't just we don't try to specifically try to match up certain things and say well i'm just in the euphrates crossing right now of my life as abraham was and and have a trip planned to egypt coming up right because we could learn from his example and not go to egypt and so it's not that we would try to force ourselves in a particular scriptural pattern uh that's a mistake sometimes we make we try to identify so particularly to people and says well i'm just like job or i'm just like prof the prophet amos and we try to take the specific details in their lives and kind of shoehorn our way to fit their their model but there's things we can learn there's examples and types and shadows and that's what brother branham is pointing out is that abraham is used to portray the plan of god that he's even used to foreshadow god's purpose and god's plan of salvation very specific things that happen with the the vision that he has uh uh of the sacrifices a vision of jesus christ the the isaac walking up mount moriah to be sacrificed is portraying and foreshadowing christ and so these many different details that god preserved within the book of genesis holds significance to us and we realize he doesn't tell the whole story there's many many details that are left out there's some that are he just refers to in general there's a lot of gaps that maybe you feel by drawing some of these inferences from the scripture but and there's and certain things that are implied there's a lot of things that we can draw from it but the specifics hold importance to us and there's details in his life that reveal important characteristics that help us relate to his faith if we just read that there was a man named abraham who had perfect faith and offered up his son isaac upon the altar upon the moment that god spoke to him and that is the faith that we ought to have in the end time i would think i failed the test every time i even once i begin to have children i begin to think you know what and this is if this stumbles anybody i apologize but with the thought of wow if the if in the rapture i was to leave my children behind there was a part of me that thought i would just rather stay with them through tribulation i'd rather be there for them i'd rather nurture them and be there and help them and comfort them and the whole thought of being separated from my children almost completely changed my ideal of let's just get out of here i thought hold on i want to be sure i want to know about the the the the permanence of my child my children's salvation i want to know that they're going with me i want to understand better the promise of the token uh because it completely changes your whole attitude i begin to feel if god was going to ask me to take the life of my son or my daughter i'd be like wait a minute how could i do this but thankfully god does not just tell the story of this perfect man abraham who had the faith of god's elect and this is what we got to do we got to fit into a two scripture a panel of what perfect faith is he tells the story and then telling the story it unfolds specific details um pacific and at length details that we can identify with to help us relate to his faith now if you like to turn in your bibles i'm going to focus in genesis chapter 11 and a little bit in chapter 12. it's going to be a lot of scripture reading going to be very very very simple and it's been 111 times that i've thought this since we begin to minister here but i think i'm going to be short and brief tonight but as has happened in 110 times to this point i'd be very surprised if i'm less than an hour but in genesis chapter 11 verse 26 i just want to start here because it kind of helped me just to orient uh orient myself to how i was looking at these scriptures it says and terra lived 70 years and begat abram now we're introduced to this character abram who we know later in genesis 17 his name is changed to abraham abram the and haran and so this this verse is the introduction to abram and i thought it was just a good point to start tonight if we're going to start looking at his life if we want to look at a particular detail in his life i thought this would be a good starting point if we read the next six verses it it gives greater details of his particular life and so at this point as there's been a genealogy um of abraham genesis chapter 11 verses 10 to 25 we begin to read these are the generations hashem those 15 verses outlined the lineage of shem's descendants after the flood and then once we get to abram we don't know these kind of details there's some very specific details more than just who begat and how many sons they were and how many years it was we get more details to abraham's life because that's the story that's going to be amplified through the remainder of the scripture right we look at the book of we look at the old testament and we realize that even the book of genesis is trying to get us to abram as fast as we can and provide some context for who this character is because the rest of the bible result revolves around and is centered around abraham and his seed and we look we realize that it's only recorded if it has something to do with abraham and his seed and that the entire bible is built around that so we it starts to give us a few more details in the next six verses about his life and about his wife but then these these prior verses these 15 verses before in verses 10 to 25 these descendants after the flood it kind of gives the um the appropriate genealogical context we can understand who abraham is within this long line of descendants of sham and even noah it also gives some historical context because it's giving us some years that we can begin to recognize how long after the flood that it was but even kind of building this together we would we could see that uh it's likely that abraham was alive hashem was alive at the same time abraham was having lived 500 years but it's kind of giving us some context to understand who did abraham come from and who his family was and ah and that helps us with the story but it's in probably the most important context and i don't i there's not some big great reveal here so if you're in suspense holding your breath this is the moment where it's like right like wow i never saw that before and i don't expect this but the most important context probably to abraham's life isn't so much who his father was his uncle was great great grandfather and all those things but the first nine verses of genesis chapter 11. and these this it's written in here because it provides this necessary contrast to what god's going to do in abraham in chapter 12. because there's a way that we could read this and you think oh well did we really even need this this tower of babel uh reference here did why was this in here oh god god provided that in there so we could understand why there's so many different languages and why the whole earth is overspread uh with with different languages and cultures and ethnicities and these things and maybe we use it to kind of have some archaeological make sense of it or genealogical sense or anthropology kind of gives us this study kind of gives us this well this is where this all stems from but it it provides us some very important contrast to the life of abraham and i think it's some of the most important context that we can draw from the life of abraham is in genesis chapter 11 starting with verse one because what and i want to read it with you the first five verses what god begins to do with abraham now i want to say this before i read these five verses what god begins to do in abraham is distinctly different than his family than how god dealt with his family it's distinctly different than his ancestors like the condition of mankind and the condition of the world and society and the uh and the and the cosmos at large it's very different the way that god has just dealt with them and god has just addressed them even if we wanted to see how he dealt with noah you realize that his dealings with adam his dealings with noah uh adam cain noah you just could come on down genesis chapter 11 and then how god deals with abraham it's very important just to see how distinctly different god deals with abraham and then also how distinctly different abraham becomes because god intervenes in his life and i think it would be very important for us to realize that abraham was the way he was because god so uh graciously yet forcefully imposed his character in his life had god never done it abraham wouldn't be written about as the father of faith that there's no animals that he'd be recorded and said oh we were just reading of harambe and nimrod and abraham you wouldn't have done it but it's because god kind of made this point to force himself into abraham's life and guide him and direct him and abraham just was overwhelmed with the revelation of god and that's how he becomes this father of the faith and this father of billions of people around the world that look to him as the father of their religion this is it's because god changed him and diverted his path so by god's intervention in his life abraham begins to react and behave very differently than the rest of the people in the world now verse 1 of genesis chapter 11. we've already read this but i want to read these i want to read five verses and then i want to read three verses of genesis chapter 12 and i want to bounce back to verse 4 of genesis 11 and start looking at the compare and contrast it says and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plane in the land of china we'll come to that towards the end of the service and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly throughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they from order they're wanting to build now to this point they would have dwelt in tents and they would have been more nomadic and they would have but now they're wanting uh some solid something permanent and they said now really grab a hold of this and then let it linger then we'll read god speaking to abraham and then we'll start to pick out this contract these contrasts and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded so they had begun to build and we're making some progress on this this is mankind and their attitude and it's positioned right in the middle right after the japan's descendants ham's descendants shems descendants and right before it goes from shems line to abram it inserts this detail chronologically but more importantly to provide context for what how go of what the world was like when god began to deal with abraham and now in genesis chapter 12 it says now the lord had said unto abram and this is what kind of gives us more of this background of what was happening in verses 27 to 32 of genesis 11. the lord had said unto abram get thee out of that country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i'll show you so the land the kindred the father's house the family the ancestors there these are all god brings them into view and he says i want you to look at the land look at the people look at your family and i want you to get away from it and i'm going to take you to a different land that i'm going to show you and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and then thee all families of the earth be blessed shall all the families of the earth be blessed now i think you can already see just by reading those verses like the lego pieces start connecting like this is interesting point counterpoint spy versus spy you start seeing these contrast now let's look at verse 4 of genesis chapter 11 so we can see the mindset and the attitude of the people it's really the only insight into the dialogue of the day the prevailing mindset of the day before god speaks to abram uh we could see some activity of abraham's family but that's spurred on by god but these this activity in genesis 11 at the end is god's response to what's happening within this climate that we see here in genesis 11 at the beginning and in verse four i'm going to go just phrase by phrase and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower and i don't think did i yeah thank you brother john for putting that up there i think i just realized that maybe i didn't even put this these things in the slide because i was just going to go back and look at this verse go to let us build us a city and a tower notice that let us build us it's not let me build you and it's not um will you build me it's it's it's us let us build us and notice how different this is from the language that god uses towards abraham i will bless i will make and right away you begin to see this difference wherein the people in genesis 11 say let us build us and we're going to do this and we're going to accomplish this and it shows that there's a self-reliance that they're reliant on their ingenuity we can make bricks and we can have mortar and we can build things and we can we can achieve certain uh accomplishments and what a what a great turnaround to a civilization that had just been wiped off the face of the earth when they were achieving such great scientific achievements and they may have looked and thought oh man we can replicate the the pyramids and we can do this and we can do that and it was still this is still in us we can still accomplish these great things by science and so there was a self-reliance whereas god is using a language to abraham to not imply that if you will i will but unconditionally i'm going to do it abraham i am going to do it there was there's this difference then between the self-reliance of the day that prevailed in that day versus an individual completely relying upon god and so it's let us build us a city and a tower and very interesting as i begin to study this how that they desired and i want to get to in a moment actually i realize now i took several scriptures out that we're going to show how god in genesis 1 28 wanted the world wanted the humanity to disperse and even in his commandment to know it it implied that there's this disbursement that you're to cover up and this place is referenced later in the scripture that's to to say that man was to fill up the earth and to go to these bounds and he had established these bounds and man was to go to it so they were going to be on this journey and i'm kind of getting ahead of myself here and by them saying you know what let's build because if you're on a journey you want to travel light right it was very it was uh very humorous to watch elliott pack for his very first uh youth camp he's going to and i thought well man will they allow a u-haul on the plane because and uh and i was like man i think they have a limit on checked bags and uh and it was it was i thought i was gonna have to buy another ticket just for his backpack to sit in the seat i'm a little bit of hyperbole there but he's wanting to bring a lot of stuff and i'm saying elliott if you could just i've been traveling for a few decades now if you could just learn from me i've got some pretty good ideas on how you can do this and we managed to get it all into a carry-on size uh bag and then micah shows up with well okay well maybe it was okay to bring a few bags and the biggest one you got uh he had an excuse because he was packing a whole sleeping bag and we arranged one for him in north carolina but if this idea would be like you know what maybe you shouldn't build a house out of bricks if you want to take it with you right right you know this idea that there's the permanence and something being established and what begin to this idea and this i kind of get lost in just my comfort tonight with you as family but this idea that's being conveyed here and i've been very moved by studying this maybe just personally as i've started studied this in depth and there's a lot of things maybe fun to fellowship on and it this may not be something that um would open up into preaching on this subject right now but there's the entity is being lifted up in this moment more than individual when they begin to say let us build us a city and a tower the entity if i could use this or the state or the church now becomes greater than the individual let's build something with walls and foundations and make this permanent and now we're all going to be sacrificed to the entity we're all going to be sacrificed to the state we're all going to be sacrificed to the government we're all going to be said come on yes get your pitchforks get your ars out right um there's this subservience then to the greater entity the sacrifice to the entity and so there's something there's this ambition to build something not just greater than the individual but that strips the individual from the the leadership in their own lives and their own individual identity to make the city and the tower that they're building to be preeminent it's very interesting we begin to look at kind of what the political agenda was or really what's taking place is whereas a man could take his family and he would be going forth to find a place where he could be positioned and he could be satisfied that he's found his lot and he's found his placing and he has this family there's kind of this idea of let's now forsake this leadership and come together to serve the city and the tower and it really begins to speak of something very different than what the mindset god wanted the people to have and it's not to say that building the city itself would have been wrong but the motive and the ambition behind it begins to expose a great air in their hearts and we'll see that as they they continue to talk about what they're wanting to accomplish and so where there might be state and government and church and and and certain uh higher or organizational structure it's fine so long as it doesn't sacrifice the individual it's fine as long as it doesn't strip away the individual leadership of the holy ghost in a person's life in in a family's life in a husband's life and his ability to lead the family and what you see beginning happening here is this lifting up of the state lifting up of the church lifting up of this entity and that becomes what is preeminent and what has to be served and what has to be sacrificed for it and so they are wanting to build a city and a tower with what the brick and stone and slime that they had come up with in verse 4. but then it says of abraham in hebrews chapter 11 verse 10 for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god wasn't the foundations that were wrong it wasn't the permanence that was wrong but abraham sought a city built by god whereas his his ancestors sought to build a city without god abraham's looking for a city that would have foundation something that's permanent but it's not let us build us a city it's a city that god has built for him it's a city that would be identified specifically with something eternal and this is the ideal that is being expressed by his ancestors let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven let us build us speaks of self-reliance whose top may reach under heaven speaks of self-preservation that now they're wanting to preserve themselves they want to achieve certain heights in order to avoid god's judgment because it's still very fresh in their minds you know the water raised up about yahai and so we could just build a city about yeah we're going to be all right like they're looking around and said see the watermark see how this was destroyed let us build us a city whose whose height may reach unto heaven and it wasn't so that they would merely have a spire that could be visible from hundreds of miles away but so that they could do it as a as a sign of surpassing god's judgment avoiding god's judgment and and so i think that's just a very simple uh simple point to make that they are wanting to avoid god's judgment whereas if we wanted and this is why i'm not maybe bringing the contrast uh it's uh in in detail as i would have liked but abraham in contrast is willing to yield himself to god's judgment and just do whatever god wants him to he's not looking to preserve uh completely totally preserve himself but ultimately he yields to god's plan and we see that there's actually a working out of these instincts from abraham because of this is what is in his ancestors so whose top may reach unto heaven this is their wanting to preserve themselves avoid god's judgment and let us make us a name this city and this tower is to be a monument of pride this was something that they wanted to establish permanent recognition of that just as the the so many things of our ancestors have been wiped out so let us build us a city and a tower that will be a monument of pride that will have eternal significance permanent recognition and this is their ambition let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name self-reliant self-preservation a self-exaltation to to lift up themselves to make a monument unto themselves to have this accomplishment look at the city that we built look at this monument that the whole world looks to and it has this permanent recognition so what they wanted to do is establish an identity that no one would ever forget wanted to establish a name that everyone would always remember they wanted to be this center and this focal point and the genesis of all commerce and religion and that billions of people could look back one two one day and say that's where we began see the spire see the city see the tower that's our origin that's our genesis they wanted that to be the father and and think of who is now abraham how different it is that god allows this story to unfold because in genesis chapter 12 verse 2 it says and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and i will make and i'm adding that i will and make thy name great again notice the specific contrast see how those pieces fit together perhaps in opposition to each other says let us make a name for ourselves let us make us a name a reputation let us establish ourselves permanently before the people as this legacy that can be looked back upon and god now singles out abraham and notice how specifically it seems to be that god is contradicting the attitude of his ancestors and his family by saying i'll make you a great nation and i will make thy name great it's god now what they wanted to make of themselves god is singling out one man it's not a group thing it's not a state thing it's not this entity it's not this city in this tower but it's one man from which there's going to come a great name and a great nation and notice how again the the attitude of the people just unfolds even more let us make us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name this is kind of this is part of their whole uh inspiration lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth let's do this lest that we be scattered this is their effort to prevent separation notice these different things that come cropping self-reliance self-preservation self-exaltation now they want to prevent separation and there's several scriptures we could have used we've alluded to this just several moments ago they're saying unless we're scattered abroad that right now we're all together and humanity's somehow amassed together in this valley in this plane in this area and why don't we go ahead and build something permanent this can become the hub let's all settle here let's all make this great and we're not allowed to leave and this is who will become this is what's going to be the focal point and it's and if you're not a part of this you're not a part of it and and let's establish something great here and let's not move out the rest of the world and they're doing this so that they could all stay together and that they wouldn't be separated but the most important thing to recognize is that they're rebelling against god's specific command to fill up the earth this is this is a this is a rebellion against a known command and even an instinct that god may have been placed inside of them that you're to disperse to go to the bounds and god has set the boundaries and god has set the bands and you want to go and disperse and spread out all over the whole earth and we'll find here in a moment when we read it again just to have these things click together as we go that that is what god wanted and so god accomplished it but they're doing it in rebellion against god they're building a tower to avoid god's judgment they're they're building it to the city to prevent separation they wanted permanence they wanted protection and so there's all these things that they wanted to achieve on their own now can you just can you see the contrast and this is why god put it in genesis chapter 11 in the beginning and then and then not that it's the chapter and verse that is so remarkable but genesis chapter 11 first few verses genesis chapter 12 first two verses and it's like these people and abraham the world and abraham humanity abraham the mindset of the society the mindset of the world this mindset of government and man and humanity what god wants to do in abraham and it provides a perfect contrast he said in genesis chapter 12 12 genesis chapter 12 verse 1 well now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee now this is i want you to zero in on this think about this allow your allow the holy spirit kind of push open some understanding expand some understanding brings or or bring some things into view to understand abraham's life in this greater context god called him out of er he says i want to get thee out of thy country he's called him out of ur and to haran then he's going to come out of her and toward canaan and begin to identify whereas they never wanted to be lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and we're moving around and we're going to permanence we want protection abraham never had a permanent address he's always having to change his mail forwarding and don't ever do it in newton north carolina you'll never get your mail i i've i was promised checks and all sorts of things i probably want to sweepstakes and i've never got it because they don't know how to afford mail in newton north carolina i feel like i've started all over in a witness protection program and and so abraham never had to worry about the postmaster in newton but he had a he had he never had a permanent address or maybe he really had to worry about it just a tip here i was told by the postmaster in phoenix when i was moving from here before that all i had to do is just forward my i didn't know where i was moving a lot like abraham glory um i didn't know where i was going and he said just do forward it to general delivery in the area where you're staying temporarily i'm like you're a smart man well they didn't have it in the area i was living in two months worth of mail gone so pray for me that happened 14 years ago it doesn't matter whenever it was but just a thought there as i was reading about permanent addresses so think about it abraham or abram as the bible says the the hebrew the one who crossed over from the other side and really never settles down is actually also is really abram the wonderer if you look at it in deuteronomy chapter 26 verse five i didn't just kind of pull that out in a scrabble match but it says and thou shalt speak and say before the lord thy god a syrian ready to perish was my father and he went down into egypt and sojourned there with a few and became their great a nation great mighty and populous now whether you're referring to uh jacob or um israel or or isaac jacob israel isaac or abraham and all the same in this sense that it's part of this lineage in this great history a syrian ready to perish was my father i want to come back to that and he went down into egypt and soldiered there with a few and became their nation great mighty and populist exactly according to what god said he would do but this statement a syrian ready to perish literally means a wandering syrian and nobody needs to change their name to a wandering syrian but here he is known and referred to this is exactly how god wants him to speak a syrian ready to preach a wandering syrian to perish was my father this is how that you're going to speak and this is how you're going to speak to god this speaks of abraham who is a nomadic shepherd very specifically speaks of abraham because he was a syrian by birth and here he is he's a wandering and this it's important to kind of recognize this aspect where in hebrews 11 excuse me in genesis chapter 11 they're wanting to they have their own bricks they have their own slime they have their own plans they have their own architects they have their own labor let us build us a city and a tower permanence protection um central hub of traffic and and laws and governments and you see in that time period the code of harambee and nimrod and these great governments and cities that are all being built up it kind of had this reliance upon the entity reliance upon the state and reliance upon structure and government and economics but by making abraham nomadic it kept him in constant reliance on god kept him unsettled it kept him unsettled just enough to where he was always having to rely upon god and what happened is instead of a city or a church or man or a personality or or some kind of program that never could become central to abraham's life only god was the central center of his life you couldn't even say well here it was in this city here it wasn't this city god was the center and so if god moved he moved from hebron if god moved he moved from this place and that place because god remained the center of his life and he was put in a position where he needed to depend upon god's word he needed to depend upon god's leadership to find his placing to find his rest and to find success in the city of the tower of babylo of babel they just would have found their success in how thriving the entity was and how booming the metropolis was and how successful their crops were and how much they were growing how much commerce they achieved and all the taxes that were paid and how everyone lined up and got along and achieved this great accomplishment but now abraham could only find his success in the leadership of god he could only find success in this voice that was speaking to him driven by this unseen hand to do what he wanted to do and you look at his life and his wonderings of his life we would say this man never found a footprint a place that he could call home but as we did sunday morning we look back on him realize that god was using abraham for something very great consecrating the very ground of palestine consecrating the very places that his aunt his descendants would later visit somehow rescuing them from the curse of his ancestors it says by faith hebrews chapter 11 verses 8 and 10 by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went a wonder the wandering syrian by faith he soldiered in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles dwelling in tents the difference you begin to one of the differences you begin to recognize between the people in genesis 11 which will be the same mass of people that abraham is a part of you begin to recognize a difference in dependence in genesis 11 the people are dependent upon themselves they're going to accomplish things on their own but then you begin to recognize the story that unfolds in abraham and we see it happening through many many different chapters that abraham was going to learn to totally depend upon god and not his idea of well what about eliezer's son and oh well what about my wife's suggestion that it'd be by hagar all these he had to come to a place where he completely and totally depended upon god so in verse genesis chapter 11 verses five to nine this is kind of god now zeroing in on what they're doing the lord came down to see the city in the tower which the children the men builded and the lord said behold the people is one it struck me how it uses the singular verb to describe the people this is how one they had become the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do so they started on this great plan with this brick and this mortar to build the city and the tower whose height may reach to the heavens and to keep them from separating being scattered abroad he says and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do so god then this is god's attitude towards the people go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech this is this is god's dealing with humanity the last thing we see of how god deals with people before he deals with abraham now i want you to recognize just this vast difference that when they're all making this big huge mistake and trying to do something they shouldn't do god just confounds them they confound their language and separate so the lord scattered them abroad from fence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city this is god's judgment because they can't understand one another anymore they can no longer do what they were wanting to accomplish and they become separated by their languages and they're divided amongst themselves and we begin to see in just a few chapters there's wars among kings different tribes and different powers and different things being coming coming to the surface verse 9 therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth god had to use confusion in strife and disagreement and misunderstanding in order to get the people to spread out like he wanted them to and this is how god deals with the people with the self the selfish ambition and this attitude let us build us a city and make us a name and avoid the judgments of god and avoid from spreading out in rebellion against god's commandment and think about how differently god deals with them we're going to come down this is a move of god upon humanity he's going to confuse their language cause strife and division scatter them out of the whole earth and it's a judgment of god to interrupt their program and how differently god then begins to deal with abram that instead of god causing confusing confusion to motivate abraham instead of all sudden abraham walked waking up one day and going up to his dad saying hey dad would you like to have some breakfast and his dad hears abraham going he's like i don't wanna ha ha and abraham's like what are you what are you saying do you want breakfast and they can't communicate and it's like hey this is not gonna work we just need to separate it wasn't that that caused the separation abraham it's not frustration it's not also in the failures of these plans god is using get yourselves together all right you've heard the charlie brown teach your voice before it shouldn't confuse any of you but there's a uh there's such a difference in how god wants to deal with abraham now it's very personal god needs to correct the people in genesis 11 and they need to fulfill his word of dispersion all across the whole the earth and to the boundaries that god had established and so he uses confusion and strife and disagreement the interruption of plans where they're just kind of spread out with all these disagreements and all this upheaval but with abram he deals with the completely different says abram i will get up i want you to leave your father's house i want you leave your kindred i want you leave your country but i'll tell you where you're going later doesn't say in genesis 11 that god told any of them where they were going to end up they just ended up where they met where they ended up it is in this as we read in verse 1 genesis 11 verse when it is from this plain in the land of shinar that the city and the tower of babel rose up and again i want to i want you to think about abraham now shinor biblically and was the country of two rivers the southern region of mesopotamia now i want you to think very specifically now of where abraham where this tower was built it says in genesis chapter 10 verses 8 to 10 and cush begat nimrod and he began to be a mighty one in the earth he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it has said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord and the beginning of his kingdom was babel remember how it said in genesis 11 therefore the name of it is called babel the beginning of his kingdom this man nimrod the beginning of his kingdom was babel and iraq and akkad and khalnay in the land of shinar in verse 11 it says and and he went forth with power and began to establish cities it's in the land of shinar where nimrod builds he begins to build these cities and the beginning of his kingdom is babel and shinar is the ancient name for the territory nader later known as babylonia or chaldea you see where i'm going with this and i'm going to stop on this because then i want you you get to the subject of babylon and right god called abraham while he was living in babylonia in the plane of shinar in er this is why god gives us the context of the spirit in the climate and the motive and objective in the mindset of the people in the plane of shinar in the city of ur of the chaldees because it's representative of babylon it's the place where the tower of babel was built this would have loomed large in the people's conscience this would have been something that was part of the uh of of their ancestry and part of their uh history and their geology the land of the entire babylon babel and it's the very place of babylon which means confusion and and i want to just i want to read a couple statements to close tonight and i'll lord when i'm very very excited to pick up on this on sunday and uh as a precursor to our picnic this subject to see what god is doing in abraham and just recognize it i know it's very very simple but this is what i've been building to in this and i think there's some wonderful things to recognize in the contrast but this is the most important uh thing that kind of raises up as it all comes together what we're reading about in genesis 11 is babylon we're identified as a babylonian mindset a character a nature a government a way of doing things and that's what god calls abraham out of we're thinking that we were the first to be called out of babylon no abraham was and that's why we are because he set the example in the message israel in the church part one this is a series i recommend it's one of those beautiful series if you're trying to think of something to listen to it's a very tremendous series to go back and listen to in 53 in march of 53 brother branham has been on the field preaching a lot for six or seven years he's kind of coming off the field and he says man i've been out there i've been looking at things and he preaches a series called israel in the church and he's shown the parallel as a prophet diagnosing the condition of the church world and how it parallel parallels the journey of israel and this israel the church a very very profound series of sermons and i that i recommend you listen to if you're looking for some listening something to listen to as you ought to be listening to the message it says israel in the church part one abraham coming from babylon with his father down into the valley of shinar where the souls of many journeyed after the destroying of babylon or the confusion taking place genesis 11 the tower of babel abraham's father parent brought abraham and his loved ones down into shinar in all that land among all those people one man found favor with god now i want you to notice that is the beginning of christianity of the church because what is god calling him out of out of babylon out of confusion out of this mindset and this lifting up a personality and lifting up a pretense and pride in all these monuments of self-preservation self-exaltation prevent separation self-reliance all these things that's wanting to take place within this structure of babylon that's what god calls abraham out of he says this is the beginning of christianity when did christianity begin the parallels are so striking it began when god called abram to get out of the country of what earth the land of the counties babylonia the plain of shinar the place of the entire babel come out of the confusion abraham and it's going to be a journey to a place that i will show you just several paragraphs later i think that was paragraph 42 this is in maybe in the 70s he says now abraham after coming out of the land the chaldeans the land the city of irv the chaldees or the of the chaldeans the land of shinar separated come out look at that just like christians today still wondering maybe it's not a wandering syrian wondering phoenicians right wondering human wondering christians we're wandering but not away from god not wondering and questioning god but there's still this journey he says just like christians today in the beginning of the christian church is it brother ram is bringing back before christ back before the day of pentecost he's coming all the way back to the example of abram and say the moment he called him out of ur in the land of the caldis from the plain of shinar away from the tower of babel out of babylonia he was beginning the christian church the beginning of christianity and he established this pattern of this journey what may seem to be just like christians today separating still wandering the patriarch abraham will close on this statement abraham was just an ordinary man wasn't something special god never called him as far as we have any record until he's 75 years old his wife which was his half-sister being 65 years old at the time they'd probably lived together since they were very young and she was barren and had no children god called the complete separation to separate himself from the rest of the world and from all his people and from all of his kindred now before we think that this is just a prescription to separate from family remember the context is the babylonian mindset the context isn't just separating from there's this attitude well light can't have fellowship with darkness and it's this real arrogant projecting of revelation and we know more and understand more and this is why family members can't fellowship with other family members because they just have way too much revelation right and and they use certain scriptures how can two walk together except they be agreed and light can't have fellowship with darkness and abraham had to separate from his family but the division wasn't so much oh you got to cut yourself off from your family but it was god calming away from an attitude and a mindset and a spirit that probably sounded a lot like we know too much and we're too good for you and abraham was probably really happy to get away from the pretense the narcissism that existed long before we came up with the word i said god called a complete separation to separate him from the rest of the world from all his people from all of his kindred why why because babylon and then also there was a special thing for him to do and when god expects you to do a special thing he demands a complete separation from any doubt you've got to come to full obedience to obey what he says notice this god demands it continue the same statement you can't do it no other way and now he always sets an example and that was his example who abraham abraham was his example of a complete separation from all of his family all of his kindreds and so forth to walk a life separated to god there could not be this overbearing influence of personality and opinion and politics and pretense and this is the way we do it and this is how we want it done and this is what we're trying to achieve and we want to we want to have this certain persona and a certain image and and project a certain thing abraham had to be separated out of this mindset of babylon separated from this tower of babel ambition separated from the lifting up of human government and human state and human entities he had to be separated from that to walk a life separated to god and when people do that on their own it brings a harmony among the people not a forced agenda not a forced a union not a force getting together and we all try to find something that we can all agree on and we all kind of get along on this particular agenda but when we're all consecrated living separated lives to god it promotes the right kind of fellowship amongst us the right kind of unity and so where i i invite the musicians to come and i want i just want to close right there with what god called abraham out of was babylon and think about it and try not to preach it right now but think about it read in the book of jeremiah read in second kings read read in the old testament that when god wants to use something to punish israel for their disobedience they're taken out of the promised land and into where babylon exactly where they go why because that's the pattern it's what god called abraham out of to go into the promised land and when they forsook the covenant of god and forsook his commands it's as if god takes away the blessing and they're carried out of the promised land the kings bound and blinded and dragged into where babylon and made captives in babylon because it's what god established in genesis 11 and chapter 12 is look at babylon look at the attitude look at the politics look at the government look at the mindset look at how laodicean it is now and he said this is what i'm calling you out of let's stand tonight thank you so much for your pulling on the word of god your attentiveness wonderful spirit amongst us tonight thank you so much for allowing me that the privilege of just releasing releasing my burden to you if we could just bow our heads in a word of prayer sister and if you had something on your heart to play you just take that liberty if you have a need you can make it known by lifting your hand tonight to him and i have no doubt that he knows he's the god who sees [Music] and hopefully as we've been attempting to make the faith of abraham relatable you could realize yet again how personally your experience matches abraham's because what did he call you out of babylon called you out of confusion some of us have experienced separation in our family because of our obedience to truth and realize wow i have the faith of abraham with that faith quickened and kind of instigated and stirred up tonight could you accept him now for all that you have need of as a church there's things that we desire to see could we bind our hearts together to believe that god's going to give us provide us what we have need of there's ones that even though we're a young church we see things that take place amongst families or individuals and we desire to see god bring a restoration come upon the scene to benefit and to take hold and nurture and encourage let's lift these people before the lord tonight such a beautiful presence here such tremendous needs we have in our hearts lift your voice to him as you've raised your hands let's pray our heavenly father lord i pray tonight that as we stand in your divine presence that you would hear our cries as we join our hearts together individually consecrated to you and living a life separated to you lord we have this unity unique unity because of separation it is a paradox but in coming away from the world and lay out to see it coming away from our own ideas and certain things that bind and kind of get under pervert our view of things we found unity in separating i pray lord that as we have this unity of the faith tonight to believe all things are possible may you grant us this desire of our heart as a church to to have a more permanent facility to see god moving within families see the restoration of those who are lost and the further quickening of those that you begin to deal with or even things that we begin to experience in the beginning and fellowship that we had that might might seem to be a little bit distant now may you restore these things restore different loved ones and bring a greater unity and fellowship amongst us that's our desire and lord for the need that was represented by the hands that were lifted i pray now lord that you would heal sick bodies release encumbered minds lift up lord downtrodden spirits and may your presence be felt within our homes lord for one who has a divided home may your presence be felt and just as you came down in the life of abraham in a very clear way and articulate way begin to unfold your promise to abram within his household within his family may you do that within our households lord may we reject the notions of laodicean babylon and babel that come into our homes and we're all speaking different languages and this person's anti this and this person's provat and we seem as if we're speaking completely different languages can we not recognize it's because we have selfish ambition and we've allowed ourselves to come under the anointing of genesis 11 as opposed to the anointing of genesis 12. may we find that voice can bring us under one headship and gain a greater clarity lord and i commit the people to you believing that we will hear testimonies we will hear more praise reports as you did this wonderful work in the life of sister sandy lord cancer-free having manifesting that she had always been cancer-free lord i believe there's going to be more outstanding testimonies of deliverance from life-long disabilities and and ailments that have plagued and situations that seemed long gone i believe lord we're gonna have more testimonies so may we with the faith of abraham take our position and begin to walk through your promised word grant us a great peace tonight as we close our service bless your people in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you
