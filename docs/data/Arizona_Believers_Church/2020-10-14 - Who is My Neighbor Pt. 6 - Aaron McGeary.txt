TRANSCRIPT
========================================
matthew chapter 23 verses 1 to 7 then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses's seat all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uppermost rooms at feast and the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets and to be called of men rabbi rabbi let's bow our heads in a word of prayer our gracious heavenly father lord we're grateful to be gathered together this evening in your house lord we've appreciated the worship lord just even the the continuity of the specials that were sung and lord just having those things ringing in our hearts as truth lord we've been our hearts have been prepared to receive your word lord we trust and and no lord that you're here present with us to divide to us our portion tonight to distribute to us the bread of life so come now lord take control this service for your glory as we commit it to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated i'd like to continue with the subject of who is my neighbor and we have drawn it from luke chapter 10 and i think i might just uh touch on that just very quickly and how that jesus is asked in regards to eternal life and the question being posed to him he answers in this that question he's one of the lawyers says unto him master thus saying thou reproach us also and um he's talking about even in luke chapter 11 actually i just wanted to refer to how he rebukes these lawyers he says woe unto you also you lawyers free laid men with burdens grievous to be born and ye yourselves touch not the burdens of one of your fingers and so this is the continuity in luke chapter 11 how jesus addresses this and he's looking at how they have um the the admiration of men before them and they're not considering the things of the lord and i'm just trying to find a spot here to launch from because i had some things i wanted to share and just trying to get my order together i'm not nervous so you shouldn't be i'm i'm at home today i'm not worried uh i don't usually eat my dessert before my meal and if it looks like i'm doing that maybe i got things a little bit out of order but in luke chapter 10 jesus also is rebuking the scribes and the pharisees he often calls them hypocrites but it's in luke chapter 10 where we see the question is asked of who is my neighbor in verse 29 luke chapter 10 verse 29 says who is my neighbor and he asked this question wanting to justify himself and it's then that jesus gives the parable of the good samaritan and so i wanted to take a moment tonight just to kind of back up a little bit and go back over what it was what we have covered so far in the first few parts so that we could kind of see the um where we've been and then maybe even give you a little bit of a pointing of a direction to where we're going to be and so the question we're pondering is who is my neighbor we recognize that this question is asked by a lawyer in regards to eternal life and then jesus gives the parable of the good samaritan in order for us to think and to ponder who our neighbor is in order to challenge even a lawyer on some of his assumptions so in part one we talked about the right foundation and how you have to lay the right foundation and looking at the right foundation we were considering how we're asking ourselves who is my neighbor not to do as the lawyer did to self-justify but rather to understand our calling and so in looking at that in the first part we really challenged this mechanism of self-justification how man wants to be right he's usually right in his own eyes and this is what was motivating the lawyer to ask that clarifying question in the second part we looked at how eternal life is living for others and this lawyer initially begins to inquire about eternal life and and he's wanting to know uh what shall i do to inherit eternal life in verse 25 jesus says well what does the law say he says well to love god and then and to love thy neighbor as thyself and then when he's he asked go and do that's right you've done well he says who is my neighbor and then jesus gives the parable the good samaritan they haven't left the subject of eternal life because eternal life is living for others and we saw that symmetry even in the original question and the parable and then in part three we were looking at how that one of the remarkable characteristics that's often expressed about brother branham is you couldn't tell who is his friend and who is his enemy by the way that he treated people so it wasn't suggested that he had no idea who his friends were had no idea who his enemies were it was you on the outside couldn't tell by how he treated people with respect and courtesy that you couldn't tell who his friend was or who his enemy was and that we also want to be able to have that kind of character to where people don't just look at how you're acting and how you're treating somebody and say well we can tell they're not friends but rather know do as the scripture says love thy enemy as thyself and then in part four we were saying don't be a thief and we're looking at how that we offend people and also how we treat those who are offended and even looking at some of the different levels to backsliding and that's where we were at last week in looking at the concept of backsliding and how there can have a bruised cell or bruised seed and to backslide actually means you can be repulsed or pushed away so often if we talk about a backslider oh they chose to do this they're just reaping what they sow but a seed can be bruised and when it's bruised it backslides and then they take a path that they didn't really want to go down and one that's not even in character with their true calling or their true election and so we can call them a hypocrite when they come to church but do you realize church is the only place that the seed of god can't be a hypocrite right when you're in the world doing everything that you would be doing in the world you're testifying that you're of the world you're testifying that you enjoy the things the world but deep down inside there's a representation from eternity so it's not at church that you're a hypocrite it's when you're out there in the world living like the world that you're actually a hypocrite so we wouldn't want to discourage anybody from coming to church because they wouldn't want to be a hypocrite actually we say come to church it's the only place you can't be because you're a son or daughter of god you're a seed of god and so we're looking at how we treat others and then even our attitude towards others and our attitude towards those that are backslid and then i want to give you a little bit of a road map as to where we're going and and in doing so not necessarily wet your appetite or not even put god in a box that means this is what i'm going to be doing for the remainder of these services that we might have to address this subject but just so you could see that there's a little bit of a vision as to where we're headed and so as we're looking at the parable of the good samaritan we will eventually get to the good samaritan and and looking at him we could see that in the good samaritan we can see an expression of christ and therefore by extension we can see ourselves because christ has no hands but your hands he has no feet but your feet so we could see we could see christ in the good samaritan and then also us as being his body and then we even the end that is mentioned in this parable of the good samaritan and how he took this man after he poured in the oil and the wine put him on his own beast and brought them to brought him to an end and took care of them the n is our church brother branham makes reference to this the n is the church and in a broader sense it's the body of christ so there's all these different parallels that are applicable to us as individuals and i share this roadmap so you can see that it's part of the vision as this church has established that we're considering the role of a church the purpose of a church the character of a church and then the the parable speaks of the host that is at that end and brother branham talks about this host or this caretaker as being the pastor of the ministry so you have the in which would be the church you have those who are there or tasked with overseeing the church and the operations of it and then the oil and the wine we know brother graham talks about that being spirit and revelation or pure word and there's it's actually even connected with worship and then the two pence these are all different elements in the parable that the word of god expounds upon that's also spirit and words there's a lot of different things that we can that we can look through and learn from that's instructive to us in our fellowship together as a church now this is so now that i've done that i feel like i've kind of given you a review of where we've been giving a little bit idea where we're going i just want to jump right back into it in terms of where we were last week and when jesus gives this parable he's challenging the lawyer to put himself in the shoes of not just the priest and the levite or the good samaritan but also to challenge him to consider whether or not he's the thief or the thieves because he's very direct and purposeful in each one of these elements that he uses in this parable are you a thief are you a priest are you a levite which one is your neighbor and he's challenging this lawyer and the question at the end of the parable which of these three who was neighbor to the man who fell among thieves the first thing that this lawyer is confronted with is the group of thieves and what i want to do tonight again is we've done this in a little bit is i want to continue to compare this group of thieves to the priest and the levite and you might seem like well these these don't have any comparison at all but you'll find that these three if you want to consider the group or two groups or three groups or or three types of people they have more in common than you realize in luke chapter 10 in verses 10 to 31-32 it says and by chance there came down a certain priest that way so this man who left jerusalem is on his way to jericho has been found among thieves he's torn he's beaten his remnants ripped from him and now the priest is introduced to us it says and by chance there came down a certain priest that way he did he wasn't going looking for someone to help he wasn't going with even an idea that he would render aid to anyone it was just by circumstance and coincidence that he passed by this way of this man that was hurt and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and it says and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side and so in the the way the sentence is structured both the priest and the levite by chance pass by the one that was hurt and wounded they were neither seeking one that was hurt they were neither looking for one that was hurt it was only a coincidence that caused them to pass by one that was in need of aid but as you continue to read in verse 33 but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and this is immediately instructive to us and jesus is wanting to contrast the actions and activities of the priest and levi and so he says by chance by coincidence they passed by this one that was hurting but this is not suggested of the samaritan in other words he perhaps went out looking for someone to help because he had what you would need to help he had oil he had wine he had things to administer aid so it says a certain samaritan as he journeyed as he traveled he came where he was it was almost as if he had a purpose in going out he kept his eyes open he was prepared and he was seeking one who on this road might be accosted by thieves and and be beaten and robbed because he knew this was a dangerous way so he was looking for someone to help as he went out and this is instructive to us as i said when he came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and i think it's important for us to be to challenge ourselves because sometimes we can kind of get this prideful mentality of come to us right we're a church we have a church you come to us if you want help come to the church if you need healing come to the church if you want to find your way come to the church and if we're not careful all the great and wonderful things about church and church services and church amenities actually begin to work against us because we just settle in our comfort zone of church and we just expect everyone to come to us who needs help but the samaritan it says it went came where he was and so it changes this idea of come to us we know how to help the hurting but rather you go out to the lost you go out to the hurt and you seek those who are in need and you go to where they are and when you come to them you find them where they are you have compassion on him it says and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to and in and took care of him so you don't sit at the church store saying hey anybody hurt anybody lost come inside but rather you go out to the one who's hurting you find them in the place that they are and you begin to minister to them in their need wherever they are and then the goal and the objective is to bring them to a place of fellowship in christ in the body of christ and so it's by chance that the priest happens upon the hurting and it's by chance that the levite comes across the one that's hurting but it is it is by uh seeking and by humility that the samaritan found one that was hurting and he came to where he was went to him and ministered to him in his need and so the the priest and the levite have more in common with the thieves than they do the samaritan and this might seem like well if it seems a little bit a kind of a stark a contrast and you're not maybe seeing the overlap i very quickly want to come to it just use allow your mind just to ponder for a moment what a band of thieves would be he fell among thieves this was a group this was a band of thieves it was more than one and i'm going to characterize him a certain way and you say well this may be self-serving to what you're trying to preach tonight and i have the benefit of doing that because i've been pondering what i was preaching tonight so if it seems a little self-serving the way i define this i'm very intent on doing it this way but the thieves were a group who capitalized on the vulnerability of somebody else and so as they were watching those that would pass by they wouldn't attack another group that would be well defended or that they would have maybe even looked like they don't even have anything they're very discretionary and who that they would have cost but they were a group who capitalized on weakness vulnerability and even someone's inability to defend themselves or their resources for their own personal gain so these these thieves laid in weight and they were opportunist when one passed by that had something they wanted and they could get it out of them they would use force or whatever it was to get something and so jesus uses a group for a reason he doesn't say he passed by someone arrogant he didn't say passed by a gentile he didn't say passed by a a a ruthless priest but rather he says this is a gang this is a group of thieves and they fell upon him and wounded him and beat him and took away his clothes so each one of the of these thieves now they're acting in concert together and there's certain dynamics that are at work upon these thieves as they begin to rob this man who went down from jerusalem on his way to jericho and they were part of an organized social structure i want you to think about this and because they were part of an organized social structure they behaved according to a certain uh set of norms or behaved according to established set code of conduct that was expected among thieves and when they say there's no honor among thieves and so that but yet there's still a a a a professional respect or a accord or there are certain ways that you would treat one another certain ways that you would have acted so within this gang or this group of people they had this organized structure that would have behaved according to a certain set of norms in other words there would have been a culture that each one of them had joined and now they're characterized as robbers and thieves but they have a certain dynamic that makes them operate and the culture is a specific collection of values and norms that are shared by people in a group or an organization so cultures shared values and certain normative behavior that everyone shares within an organization and then it's those values and norms that control the way that you interact with one another and with others outside the organization we've heard of organizational culture an organization can have a culture a baseball team can have a culture a clubhouse can have a culture a school can have a culture churches can have a culture and so within this culture there's a set of norms there's certain values there's certain ways that we behave and it determines how we interact with each other and even how we interact with those who are outside of the group or the organization and so the priests and levites and the thieves both of them as two separate groups we want to look at it with groups or uh three different groups they acted according to group dynamics to be harmful and i'm wanting not to think of the priest in levite as jesus purposely putting him in a category of people and then purposely placing in a group of people in as a contrast you have thieves and you have priests and levines and now i want you to think about these thieves and these priests and this levite as having things in common in hosea chapter 6 verse 9 it says and as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company of priests murder in the way by consent for they commit lewdness now the old testament's just done all the hard work as i'm i'm suggesting to you that the thieves have more in common with the priest than the priests have with the samaritan that the thieves have more in common with the levite than the levite does with the samaritan the bible actually makes the comparison that as a gang of robbers would wait for a man to rob him so the company of priests murder in the way by consent through their commission of lewdness so an unfaithful priest an unfaithful levite operating in that capacity as a priest or unfaithful in the duties that he should administer in the temple the bible compares him to a gang of robbers then in matt micah chapter 3 verses 10 to 11 it says they build up zion with blood in jerusalem with iniquity the heads thereof judge for reward they're influenced by bribes and the priests they're of teach for hire for payment or for money and the profits therefore divine for money yet yet will they lean upon the lord and say he is not the lord among us none evil can come upon us so think about the example that these men are setting whether it be the the heads that judge for reward the priest that teach for hire the prophets that divine for money it's actually taking the priest and put him in the category of somebody who is influenced by gain influenced by something that they can benefit from it's not actually service it's not something that they can give but what can they get out of it and they actually are teaching for higher teaching for payment and the bible in the old testament's taking these priests to say they act just as robbers who just want to get into your pocket and take something from you and then in the text that we read in matthew chapter 23 verses 1 to 7 says then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses's seat that means they put themselves in a position of authority and it struck me that even in in the contrast now you have the scribes and pharisees and priests would certainly be a part of that though it may not be inclusive of all priests but scribes and pharisees now are seated in moses seat as the successors to the prophet and now they're sitting in a seat of authority and he says all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observant do if they teach good doctrine if they're teaching you what moses said if they're deriving what they teach for moses authority then you ought to do it but do not ye after their works for they say and do not in other words they become hypocrites they try to use the authority of moses they try to use the authority of the prophet and they teach you many wonderful things that you ought to do but they themselves will not do it so we're saying when you see the priest they act hypocritically and they don't even do what they're telling you to do so don't do what they're doing and then he says for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers they will not ease the burden they will not aid those that are in in this a predicament they've even placed upon them and there's other scriptures that i refrain from using but they're taking advantage of the people just as it said this company of priests murder in the way or they they teach for hire they're taking advantage of the sincerity of the people the bible even talks about how men will take a women who are laden with sins and lead them away captive why they capitalize on their guilt capitalize on their desire to be made free capitalize on their their predicament the situation that they're in and they prey on women who are vulnerable for their own benefit and for their own and for their own reputation it says verse five but all their works they do for to be seen of minutes for show not surface they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments they want you to be sure that you know this is a priest this is one who's very holy this is one that you ought to give attention to and love the upper most rooms that feast and the chief seats and the synagogues they separate themselves they want to have the preeminence they want to put themselves forward they want to be recognized as being better and as being greater and as the ones that need to be served and says and greetings in the markets and to be called of men rabbi rabbi and there's a number of different scriptures that could be used but i think with just the few that have been referenced here you could consider how these even the priests would be characterized as opportunists themselves who will capitalize on weakness for personal gain who were not leaders but rather manipulators because as leaders they would have required of the people to do certain things and to give service and to and to worship and to make an offering for the people's own benefit for the worshipers benefit and that's what a leader will do it'll compel you it'll encourage you to do things and obey for your own benefit but a manipulator requires you to do something for their own benefit they want you to dress holy because it makes the church look holy they want you to act right because it's a reflection of their personality their character their ministry but that's a manipulator versus a leader and so these priests they were all into pretense and how they looked and how everyone saw what they were doing and so they were manipulating the people to extract gain out of them for their own benefit not to take sides in this political season we're in but they would have been capitalist and so as we think about these things the thieves the priest and the levite they're all acting under the influence of a group dynamic a thief within the gang of thieves the company the troops of robbers as the scripture says and then the priest as a company the levite as being part of a group that's separated and set apart now if i seem to be nervous and jumbled and mixed around i realize it may be a little bit scattered and not well put together but now i know that maybe i've got your attention a little bit and at least now you can start to relate because we all do things in a group that we otherwise wouldn't do by ourselves can we all agree there's things that we will do as a group that we otherwise would not normally do if we were alone and then we'll do things because of a group even when we are alone because of the same dynamics that because we identify with a particular group because we know of a particular group so it doesn't mean we have to be in the group and physically together to do that but sometimes the fact that we belong to a group are identified with a particular group even when we're alone will act according to a certain set of dynamics that are associated with that group and so i want you to ponder the power of the culture that acted upon the thief the power of the culture that acted upon the priest and the levite to bypass the one that was wounded by the thieves consider the the power of a social structure consider the power uh uh that existed within this gang of thieves and they existed amongst the priests and the levites that actually influenced them one to rob one to hurt one to harm and the others to avoid and to bypass them so if you're thinking with me now on uh the way that a group works to influence our behavior because we're part of a group we'll act a certain way in a group in a group setting that we otherwise wouldn't do when we're all alone and then also we do things when we're all alone that we otherwise wouldn't do but rather because we're part of a group we're acting according to a group behavior i used to think it'd be fun just to take to video people i'm probably mentioning something nobody knows about except uh telling your age but you take a hacky sack and uh look maybe you could demonstrate but you get in a circle and you play hacky sack and you have a group of people standing around and you're bumping it and kicking it and stalling and everything you do and i thought it'd be great to do that and then take edit out the hacky sack and just watch this group of people doing the most bizarre set of movements and so you there's things that you do in a group that makes sense in a group that you wouldn't otherwise do if you were alone and i want you to use that being able to relate that way and think about how someone if you were an individual in this gang of thieves how you would begin to act a certain way and do a certain thing that you would have never done by yourself never jump out and rob somebody and this priest and this levite because the group that they were part of it affected the way that they acted now i'm going back to two statements we read last time just to see how this how this was unfolding as we were looking at this brother branham says when men and women get to a place and now he gets into their thought process well i really ought to stay at home i really ought to stay at home and see this good play tonight i should stay home and watch this tv show want to stay home and watch the ball game whatever it is he says but i tell you they will think i'm backslid if i go don't go on down to church so he's looking at thought process and how someone's at home on a wednesday night uh maybe a sunday night he's saying oh well i should go to church but i really want to watch this and they're wrestling with these thoughts inside of their mind but then they decide to go to church not because they want to go to church but because of what everyone else at church will think if i don't show up at church they'll think that i'm backslid if i don't go to church so it's identifying an individual's thought process then there the thought process of the group like well how did this person know that that's what everybody would think because that's what they think when they go when you don't have you ever been around somebody always talking about everybody else now do you think they don't talk about you when you're not around them you've got a lot of faith and that's why this person could say well i i really want to stay home and but i better go to church because they'll all think i'm backslid it was the way the group thinks it was actually something that the church had projected that they had participated in and and maybe i could say this maybe they didn't think that way but they felt that way about everybody that's how they knew people felt but it was something that characterized the church that was causing this person to think through well i better go to church tonight because if i don't the church is going to think i'm backslid then in the message thirst brother says let me tell you something when you're worshiping god in the spirit and in truth then so he says that's what we ought to be doing right worship begotten spirit and truth he says when it becomes a custom for you to do it when your worship as a church becomes tradition it becomes custom this is what we do this is how we worship because you think you ought to do it he says because you think if you don't shout or jump up and down or dance with the music your neighbor is going to think you're backslid you are drinking from a stagnated stream so again he's looking at a thought process one the first one about going to church now even while you're in church you're worshiping because you think a certain way and you're worshiping because others think a certain way and if i don't worship with a particular expression if i don't stand up when everybody else stands up if i don't clap when everybody else claps when i'm not doing what the group is doing then the group is going to think i'm backslid because i'm not acting like everyone else is so brother branham is identifying how we can even begin to be influenced by a group by our church and as a church have a way of thinking and because you have a way of thinking as a church the individual begins to operate within the structure of that church not by their desire to be in church or their desire to worship god in spirit and truth but because they don't want to be considered as backslid and as i mentioned last time that's the last reason we want people come to church is because they don't want to be considered backslid i guess i'll go to church because i don't want people think i'm backslid and then everybody's just hooting and hollering in worship service because they don't want you to feel like they're backslid and then they just say amen to the preacher and get all excited because they don't want to be considered backslid and what have we accomplished in the end if we should hand out buttons that say foolja didn't i right or at least have a bumper sticker says at least i don't look backslid right and that becomes the tagline arizona believer's church at least we don't look backslid can we fit that in our logo and that's what brother brahm's identifying so consider then the factors that are influencing thinking just in these two examples alone consider the factors that influence behavior we're talking about the thief we're talking about the priests we're talking about the levi we're not even talking about the samaritan we're just talking about these three that this lawyer should be accosted with and he should be thinking about man am i a thief am i a priest or am i levite because which one was neighbor to him who fell among thieves in proverbs chapter 19 verse 21 it says there are many devices in a man's heart nevertheless the council of the lord that shall stand now for the remainder of our time this evening i want to expound upon the devices in our heart but i want to make this very clear right now there's a comparison that's made devices in our hearts versus the counsel of the lord and the counsel lord this is the necessary answer to the devices so if i if i use economics or i use psychology or sociology are you some scientific discipline to identify a device in a man's heart i'm by no means suggesting that the same schools and of thought and the same disciplines that can identify the problem within human thinking i'm not suggesting that the same school or discipline is is equipped to have the answer to it science can tell us all day long what's wrong with us and science can tell us all day long how we act a certain way and we behave a certain way but it doesn't have the answer to the human condition the word alone has the answer to it and so there's many devices in a man's heart but it's the counsel of the lord that is the necessary answer the necessary resolution and barrier or guard to these devices that are in our hearts there are many devices in a man's heart that device actually means we might say it well that's where we're headed anymore right just by uh we actually get a device implanted in us and we can just have the devices uh uh installed in us since we think devices cell phones tablets and different things but this when it says devices they're inventions in our mind a device is a perception so it's talking about thoughts and not just a fleeting thought but calculations so there's a computer inside of everyone's head there's a computer inside everyone's hearts and it's processing data analyzing data and it's coming to conclusions so there's many thoughts or calculations and then instincts within a person's heart so when the bible says there's many devices in a man's heart that's judgments that's conclusions it's thought it's thought pat thought patterns even think about this there's a code in your heart and it basically says if this then that and so it's it's actually throwing things out oh it didn't it's not this then go to that it's not this then go to that and it's searching for the it's searching for the the variation of the data variable that's going to change what the output is and so all of us have that in our hearts and and maybe you too can be a coder or developer because it's just in you naturally to think that way so i want to put it this way and in science it called a heuristic but it's a mental shortcut that allows us to solve problems and make judgments quickly and efficiently so it's it's actually these devices that allow you to be able to say don't touch that it's hot right and you can do it very quickly it's what allows you to see a face and it's like that person looks angry it's what it's what makes you able to make decisions very quickly and not just quickly but efficiently so we all have mental shortcuts or formulas or ways that we process information and we use it to solve problems or make decisions or make judgments and it helps us to do it very quickly now that's a benefit right to have that in our heart to have a device in our heart would allow us to do that but there's a downside to it and the downside to it is a cognitive bias and so we have mental shortcuts we have ways of processing information if we see this and we see that then we make this conclusion if this happens and that happens then we view it a certain way but then the cognitive bias is basically a systematic error in that problem solving something that's wrong in the very a systematic error in that judgment making something wrong in our thought process that's actually creating a bias and keeps us from behaving correctly acting correctly or doing what we ought to do and and i established this in talking about groups or culture because it's these devices in a man's heart that puts us into groups desire to belong the desire to be accepted and so it's these very heuristics or these mental shortcuts or these thought processes and value judgments in our mind that cause us to be put into groups and then allow that group to influence us so there's many devices in a man's heart these devices in your heart cause you to become a part of a group and then it allows the group to influence the way that you act in the way that you think so i want to look at these group dynamics not necessarily how we get into them but the power and the influence of them the power and the influence of culture and revelations chapter 3 verse 17 this is speaking to the whole age so it addresses the age as a group because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou are wretched and miserable poor and blind and naked this is the spirit of the age and since we're part of an age and where we come forth in a particular age there's a attitude or a thought process or a spirit that works upon the age just by virtue of being born into laodicea there's an influence of laodicea there's the course of this world there's a way that we're made to think a way a way that we're made to act and it's a pressure that comes upon the age and since there's a spirit on the age it characterizes the entire age so i'm just putting the whole age into one group and the bible's saying they have a way of thinking and they have a way of acting why they're in laodicea they're in that time and so there's a power and an influence over the people's thinking it's the condition of the age that makes them think they're rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing it's the condition of the age that has blinded them to the fact that they actually are naked poor and miserable and then brother branham identifies this about this age he says it's the hour of uniting that's the spirit of the age we've got to unite everything you talk about has got to be organized so we're living in a time where things are being united things are coming together so there's a spirit on this age and then one of the spirits on this age is the spirit of let's come together let's organize let's come into groups and now this works on just the devices in a man's heart of wanting to belong and wanting to be accepted and wanting to to be acknowledged amongst your peers and those things these are all things that are working in the age that we're living in and now i'm gonna i don't care remember how many i might have here to go through but i want to start looking at some of these biases in our hearts there's a and again this is maybe academic and if you had taken your behavioral economics class today and it's all review give me credit if you get a good grade on your test but there's a conformity bias this is a device in our hearts this is a way of thinking this is a power this is a mechanism in our minds the way we think that works against us and the conformity bias is the tendency to behave like those around us rather than use our own personal judgment so instead of acting by your own conviction instead of doing what you would want to do you you conform to everyone else around you so it's a tendency to behave like those around you then use your own personal taste or your own opinion and you say well what would be an example of that brother and you go out to eat and you really really like tofu and you're finally at a place that's got tofu and everyone else starts ordering steak and you don't want to be the guy who orders the tofu burger and so you change your order to what everybody else is ordering especially if everyone else starts ordering it and what you do instead of just ordering according to what your personal taste is according to your preference you actually will order something else because everyone else is ordering it and that's a conformity bias that may be a very innocent simple way of how this works but we all have this mechanism in our heart to where we want to behave like those around us instead of just using our own conviction even our own taste or using our own opinions to guide us and influence us and let me point this out as we go forward with a lot of these influences and these dynamics of group behavior physical presence isn't necessary and all we needed was the facebook experience experiment to figure that out that you don't have to physically be with somebody in order for them to influence you and make you angry you're in a great mood next thing you know you're reading somebody's wall and it tells you something and you're a bad mood physical proximity being physically together is not required for a group to act upon you and to influence you so you can be subject to this desire to conform and to behave like everyone else around you but it doesn't mean they have to be within the same room you can just be grouped together through social media and what they find is that people are more comfortable with impersonating or mimicking others than they are with just doing what they would want to do and it's it it's how that uh they've done many different experiments and you can just see it work where if everyone else is doing something you won't even ask i guess i better stand up because everybody else is standing i guess i better clap because everybody else is clapping let's if you would you would just rather you're more comfortable fitting in with everyone else is doing than just following your own instinct to doing what you feel you should do they'd rather just follow the crowd than their own conviction and because of that they have what is called a bandwagon effect it's a tendency to like the team that just won the championship it's a tendency to act a certain way or believe a certain thing because many others are acting the same way the bandwagon effect it's the the tendency to act a certain way or believe a certain way because others are acting or believing a certain way and you just kind of get on the bandwagon everyone's liking this everyone's doing this and this is how these uh they call them memes they say they go viral they're actually just talking about the way that it infects because while because it's passed from person to person and it's this mimetic compulsion everyone else is doing it so i'm gonna do it and people do the silliest things because everyone else is doing it my goodness now that i'm thinking about it i didn't even have to edit out the hacky sack just with everyone tick-tocking they look crazy because you go by somebody like what in the world are they doing it looks so weird then you're like oh yeah they're tick-tocking that's why they're doing all sorts of weird weird things and why are they doing it because everyone else is it's the power of the crowd it's the sway it's the mood it's and they get on the bandwagon to fit in and they get on the bandwagon so they can be part of the group and go the direction everyone else is going now so far ordering a burger at a restaurant or a steak at a restaurant because everyone else is ordering it and liking the chiefs because they want a championship all those things may seem very very innocent but this is where it gets it really starts to get down to where we live there's a lot of different groups that we're a part of to where this isn't just as innocent as going out to dinner and where this worked on the thieves and where it began to work on the priests and levites is then there's such a thing called the group think the hive mentality we all behave the same way and how this is effective is we have a desire for harmony since we have this desire to conform this desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in decisions or conduct that is irrational or dysfunctional why because the desire to conform is there and the desire to have harmony within the group is what's motivating everyone to act and it actually causes people with this group think mentality to do things that are irrational to do things that are dysfunctional and group members will try to minimize conflict and reach consensus decision without critically evaluating other alternative viewpoints and by actively suppressing dissenting viewpoints this is what happens in group think everyone tries to minimize conflict to reach a consensus and so that since that's the goal we don't want to hear someone else's idea we don't want to hear someone else's opinion we isolate ourselves from other influences and because we're wanting to think a certain way act a certain way and you just get in this mentality is it doesn't matter if it's irrational doesn't matter if it's dysfunctional what we want to promote is a lack of we don't want any disconforming thought we don't want any it's what cognitive dissonance is just push anything out of the way so i feel good about what i'm doing and it occurs because there's a desire to conform it occurs because we derive our information from others and then what happens is our group becomes an echo chamber and you may have heard this phrase before it's not unfamiliar but its ideas are repeated within a closed a closed system which excludes any other input so the idea would be expressed that ideas are are promoted ideas are expressed and then they're repeated inside this closed system that won't allow any disconforming idea anything that's a rebuttal anything that balances anything that would be outside of this pattern of thinking and so what happens is the same thing is repeated over and over again they call it an echo chamber anybody ever heard that phrase used before and so because they want to keep anything that doesn't fit that narrative out it only allows information in that reinforces that view now when it when a group think becomes an echo chamber that's what that's when people get polarized and that's when you have social polarization social extremism political polarization political extremism was there's just a closed loop looper the only thing you keep hearing over and over again is the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and it becomes that's the only thing anyone ever considers i'm just looking at academia looking at things that are in our hearts to describe the way groups work and then i think you're spiritual enough to begin to apply that we've got to be careful how we behave and act in groups this was a conclusion that was drawn from a group study it said something strange happens when you put people into groups they take on new roles form in-group alliances get swept up by extreme stances succumb to peer pressure in a group setting the reasonableness of our thinking can be distorted and compromised so as soon as you identify yourself with the group you can take on a different kind of role you form alliances within the group you can get swept up in extreme stances how groupthink echo chambers you succumb to peer pressure why the group is doing it this is in the and you uh in the reasonableness of your thinking can be distorted and compromised all through what being placed within a group that's why it's called herb uh herb that's the combination of herd and mob and if i was in a real in a hurry i'd just do it it's herb mentality and maybe there is some kind of type there when it comes to herbs but but this herd mentality or mob mentality people are in a group and someone kicks a window and everyone's like let's bust some windows and you have a group of people that would never would have vandalized a day in their life but now that everyone else is doing it all of a sudden they get swept up in the collective everyone else is acting in this mob mentality this herd mentality individuals in a group begin to act collectively without even centralized decision making and everyone's doing the same thing and it's not like someone told them to do it it's not like they've received a command they call like a hive mentality there's just like a mindset that sweeps over the people and everyone starts doing the same thing this is what happens when people are put into groups now it can happen in a positive way when people see that others are giving they can be giving also but then when they see other people taking they can take also they did a cheating study and they found that cheating is contagious when we see others succeed by cheating it makes us more likely to cheat as well it's the attitude when you see somebody looting you may not be a looter but when you see somebody else coming out with a really nice pair of air jordans you're like i want a pair and good people can get swept up in the moment and do things and i'm sure none of you are wearing shoes that were looted but maybe i'm using well if if not then let's talk but i'm using maybe examples that we can begin to relate to then just think about how that we then and people can do things that they otherwise wouldn't do but the power of the crowd everyone else is doing it well if i don't do it i'm going to be at a disadvantage if i don't do it then everyone else is getting ahead and everyone else is cheating if i don't cheat i can't keep up my grades will be bad or they're getting the benefit why can't i get a benefit it's all part of the dynamics that work upon the devices in our heart that cause people to go down the wrong path there was a a a really profound experiment that was done in regards to this the power of the crowd and the way we behave in groups and they did a group experiment and in this experiment they had and and i don't have the numbers in front of me but i believe it was like maybe five people five or six people that were actors and they had one person who was not an actor they were the participant in the study but the participant didn't know everyone else was acting and so he's in a room with five other people the participant is and they're asked a question and then they're all going to have to answer uh orally out loud what the answer is but the participant is always going to go last and the question was which of these uh which of the of these four lines i'm trying to remember just exactly how it was phrased but i'll show you the slide in a minute and probably make it really easy to articulate this if you were looking at it so i'll just do that it was presented this way i'm going to get out of the way which line on the right is the same length as the line on the left so the question is of a b and c which letter here is the same length as this one here now we're looking at that and we're thinking well this is easy right this is not a hard question and it was done this way purposefully to where now you have six people in a room they're all participants in a study seemingly and the question is which line on the right a b or c is the same length as the one on the left now i'm not going to trick anybody how many think that it's c right all of us together is a group this is not a visual illusion it is true c is the same length as the line on the left but what they did is they had the five actors in the study answer first and they all said a or b and so as they got down the line the participant in the study now has to give an answer in the group dynamic and in the when the study was originally done 75 of the non-actors said the wrong answer and gave the same answer as the group so you had five people and they'd say which line on the right is the same as the length as the line on the left and they say a a a a a and the whole time you're thinking no no no and then it gets your turn you're like a yep a good job guys yep now what would make somebody do that conformity bias the even the group thing the echo chamber it's like that this i want to be a part of the group they did the study one time and 97 of the people in the study answered wrong when they knew better it's not that your perception changes necessarily it's not that by the time the fifth person gives the wrong answer you have this epiphany it's like i've been looking at it wrong the whole time you change it because the pressure you change it because you want to conform and then you might actually be trying to convince yourself oh well maybe maybe it is this way maybe it is that way and this is the power of the crowd this is how we many times act contrary to what we know is right and we do it because everyone else is doing it even in things that we know to be very very obvious and it's this should be obvious to everyone but because everyone else has given the wrong answers we've been raised better we see in the message that it's not this way we know the bible teaches differently but because everyone else is doing it it works on us and influences us and because we don't want to be considered to be backslid because we don't want to be non-conformist because we desire to fit in we'll do what everyone else is doing and then they have an in-group bias and i think this is where i was kind of narrowing it down it's a tendency to give preference or preferential treatment to others who belong to the same group and this is hidden head on where the priest and levite were because the reason why they didn't stop and render aid because he wasn't a jew and that's why jesus in answering the question gave the parable because he wanted this lawyer to think about who was in his group who he considered his neighbor who he considered a friend and not have a way of categorizing people so you don't have to behave correctly towards them well since they're not really my neighbor i don't need to be neighborly that's that's the notion that jesus was challenging he's challenging groupthink he's challenging group identity he's challenging how we can get this conformity bias that sweep people up into these extreme stances and this in-group bias is our tendency to prefer others and to give preferential treatment to those who belong to the same group and what's remarkable is you don't even have to have a strong relationship with the group identity in other words this prejudice exists even when people are randomly put into groups you're just going to randomly put people into groups and it's not because of their age it's not because their weight it's not because of their location it's not because of what they like and don't like you just randomly put people into groups and they still get swept up and we're the group so really the group itself the making of the group is meaningless the the identity of the group is mean is it's just the fact that we're all in a group and this prejudice works on people and this is what leads to extending privileges to those who are in the group but denying the privilege to those who are outside of the group it's this in-group bias that actually leads to discrimination and prejudice it's what creates unequal outcomes some people get preferred a certain way their outcome is better unequal treatment so it causes hypocrisy because you treat some people one way others another and so there's a disparity in action versus what you say and so there was a study that was done it was called the the the robbers the robbers cave study robbers k was a reference to a camp i think was in seriously arkansas and so they did a study and in this study they took 22 boys they're all 11 years old and they were invited to a fake summer camp if summer camp wasn't bad enough this was a fake one and as they took these 22 boys they separated them into two different groups of 11. and one team was called the eagles and the other one called the rattlers and because of our group thinking we all are biased for the eagles right we're already cheering for the eagles and we don't know who these boys are it's just a group of 11 year old boys they're called the eagles plus god i hope they win by the other group called rattlers don't they know the serpent in the beginning just by giving them names we've just we've said this one's serpent seed and this one's the bride because it's our group think and we're thinking yeah which one's the rattler oh yeah this kid here it's gotta be him don't have a shirt on kid with these beetle bangs over there yeah we're already figuring out who the rat would this has got to be an eagle nice short high and tight smiling shirt tucked in right and we can pretty much just sit there and figure out who's an eagle who's a rattler and so they had a group of 11 boys they were in a group called the eagles they had another group of 11 boys all of them 11 years old and they're the rattlers and so they're separated and they only interacted when they were competing in various activities so they never saw each other they didn't fellowship socialize they only did it when they were competing they only met up when they were competing with each other so the dynamic was we're the eagles we're the rattlers and we're always competing against the eagles or competing against the rattlers and then as they begin to interact through these competitions the two teams showed increasing hostility towards each other which eventually led to violence and the hostility so there's no they haven't been put into camps because these people from south arkansas the others are from north arkansas this one's a yankee this one's a rebel they weren't categorized that way without any other uh a means of separation it's just you're an eagle you're you're a rattler and then we're going to compete and then they got so swept up and we're eagles and we're rattlers that they actually begin to uh impose violence on one another and they're a hostile to each other and one of the most sound conclusions they come to is that it's a demonstration of how just group identity can become the foundation of conflict just group identity alone that i'm part of a group you're part of another group that's reason enough to be hostile towards you that's reason enough to not love you like i should that's reason enough not to be neighborly oh well i won't punch you in the face i had a brother tell me that one time we're in a conversation he said and i was standing standing here the brother was standing there there's another brother right here and he said see this brother here and he pointed to me and i'm like yes he said i want to punch him in the face right now i'm like what he says but i can't he's my brother and i thought oh my goodness well i'm glad he's got that bias in his mind you know at least he thought i was a brother because at the time i didn't really think he was my brother and i thought swing ahead you know go ahead swing i'm not really your brother but there this is where people if they can if you're not my brother i can take a swing at you if you're a rattler i can take a swing at you i'm an eagle you're a rattler they got so swept up in these groups they actually became violent towards one another eleven-year-old boys all they had to do was be put into groups and they could hate each other put into groups and they could be violent towards each other and it's these biases that harm our relationships with people who don't belong to our group i'm still asking the question who's my neighbor and we're not just neighborly to those who fit in our social circle or fit our group and paul is looking at this in second corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves supply their supply testimonials about themselves those that put themselves forward they're always bragging it's a very interesting statement where paul says i'm not so bold as to compare myself or to put myself in their shoes but he says but they measuring themselves by themselves measuring themselves among themselves and and to each other and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise we as humans are wired to compare it's hardwired in your mind you're going to compare and it's actually good at times to compare but it becomes a it becomes a a negative to us it becomes this cognitive bias because we're wired to compare so we compare ourselves with others who are in our group we compare groups with other groups and this is what makes social groups very very dangerous is because we're always comparing ourselves to those who are around us and because of these things that are in our hearts and these things that are in our minds the conformity bias the bandwagon effect group think echo chamber mob mentality or herb mentality and of this in-group bias and all these things that work within our lives it makes us think and act a certain way and it's all dependent upon what the group is doing maybe if it was always expected and priest had this pressure within the group if you see somebody who's been robbed the very least get them back up on their feet and give them your cloak and put them on their way the priest would have acted according to the group even if it wasn't in his heart he just would have done what the group was supposed to do because that's how powerful it is but the dark side of this group think the dark side of a group mentality or the sway of the crowd is it causes us to treat people unfairly it causes us to judge others entirely upon even their group affiliation oh right i was fellowshipping with a brother that says oh you're from down there a condescending way oh oh why because just by putting them in a category just by associating them with a particular doctrine we've already put it in a category say well these are all the characteristics associated with that group this is how we ought to treat that group are you making this real to the church you make it real to you personally i don't have time to do that i just have time to share some of these things with you but there's so much more that you personally can be doing to challenge yourself with this and i and i i am wanting to challenge our our thinking as a church we are a group well brother should we not have groups no no we just don't want to have a group think mentality you don't want church ever to become an echo chamber why because the way that seemeth right to a man there's many devices in a man's heart and if we don't allow the council of the lord to remain supreme churches become echo chambers if we don't allow the council lord to have preeminence then we do have a hive mentality we we just act because the group is acting and if i've gone so far in the academic side of it and the behavioral economic side of it remember what brother branham said people go to church just because they don't want to be thought to be backslid people worship because the group thinks a certain way brother brahma identified these issues within the framework of our church the local church in the body and how it interacts and how we have a group identity when we give ourselves a name we have a place where we associate we have to be aware that there's many devices in our hearts and it actually will influence our behavior and cause us to be a certain way when we don't want to be influenced by the group we want to be influenced by the word and i'm not just referring to a church identity when we talk about groups well this church and that doctrine these different groups i'm talking about even about groups within the church itself what do we call those clicks and though there is uh the sociology on this to suggest that there's this inherent uh desire to be a part of a group or be part of a clique and it's just it's innate in us and it's not harmful but the idea of a clique that's used in this in this context that i'm referring to is it's something that's exclusive or privileged and a click is associated by the fact that others can't just readily join you can't just join a click right like oh that's a neat click that's all the cool guys i'm just going to join you at your lunch table like who are you man you're not even rolling up your pants right right are those guest genes now if you're not wearing your bows you can't be part of this group i'm just dating myself here purposely being 80s for you but there's a way that people are put into categories you just can't readily join you can't just be part of that group why it becomes a click that you're not it's not it's not easy to join it's exclusive it's privileged and you know what it's only a click if you aren't in it right well those people over there you know that's just a click right right people i mean it's the pot calling the kettle black it's only a click if you're not in it but then your group like one buddy one brother told me one time he said man that church nobody fellowships and nobody gets together and there's seven or eight families that feel the same way i'm like how did that happen well we all got together and talked about it help me out here nobody gets together seven or eight families got together to talk about it well it sounds like you've got your group that's getting together what because it's not a click if it's a click if you're not in it since you weren't part of that click and i say that just to challenge ourselves can we be part of a clique but we wouldn't call it that because we're in it and this is how sides are formed this is how we take sides on an issue or situation that leads to divisive behavior i'm very i'm very conscious of the time here i realize it's a wednesday night but we're not just talking about being part of a group but now within a group you can have cliques or different groups and they form a side because of an issue that comes up and because there's an issue that raises up people quick to take sides and in taking sides at least a divisive behavior well the eagles are on this side and all the rattlers are on this other side well don't you all go to the same church oh no well yeah but i'm pro-drums i'm anti-drums and i'm pro-single cup for communion and i want multiple cups and pro master and time mask could you imagine a church splitting because of a position on mask the brother brand makes this statement he's talking about branham he says a little fuss can come up in the church and branham tabernacle he says it's okay i can say this i'm at home now he says a little fuss can come up the church and branham tabernacle and they'll form a little clique and one get on one side and one on the other within the branham tabernacle which would be a group a fuss raise up and then people start taking sides i notice what the scripture says philippians 2 3 let nothing be done through strife now the word strife to us is immediately contention fighting right but the word that's used for strife here is politicking or electioneering let nothing be done to make a party let nothing be done to create a group let nothing be done that's partisan or separates are factious that's what the bible's saying is if we can make groups if we can set people into parties if we can put people into categories this is how people justify their behavior this is how people justify their wrong attitudes this is why the lawyer was so quick to say well who is my neighbor because he wanted to justify his actions he wanted to justify his attitude and people actually justify immoral behavior and dishonest actions just as long as it benefits their group or their position people not above lying people not above hurting people not above breaking even the conviction and the standards of the word of god just because it benefits their group this is the danger of group thinking this is the danger of the sway of the crowd this is the danger when people begin to act according to group dynamics and not the dynamics of the holy spirit let nothing be done through party making electioneering causing sides splitting people up for where envy and his strife is in james 3 16 where envy and strife is there is confusion and every evil work where there's politicking where there's electioneering where there's party making it says there's there is confusion and every evil work brother brahman says this in revelations chapter four part three when he's preaching uh the church ages revelation of jesus christ taking that scripture to submit yourself he says congregation submit yourself to your pastor pastor submit yourself to your congregation it's not a one-way street right we all believe the message don't we so now speaking to the pastor he says if a little click rises up don't be on either side submit yourself to the whole congregation so you're going to submit to what is beneficial and what's best for the whole congregation don't take signs in it don't split it up don't harm it to submit yourself to the whole congregation he says congregation if you start in a click submit yourself to your pastor in the fear of god he's addressing the the tendency for people to be factious he said a little fuss rises up they'll form a little click one get on one side one another he's saying submit yourselves one to another and submitting yourselves one to another the congregation to the pastor pastor of the congregation you can bind yourselves together and keep yourself from being divisive infectious because when things are done merely for part of making party making or partisanship that's where there's confusion in every evil work there are many devices in a man's heart nevertheless the counsel of the lord that shall stand got a lot of ways that we think a lot of ways that we process information just to get along with one another just to be able to navigate work and school and make decisions but we're just exposing a dark side to our thought process biases that we hold within our hearts and because we have these biases we can be part of a group that acts a certain way and does certain things and treats people ways that makes other people feel isolated alone rejected hurt right if you're gonna if you can only say amen because you feel isolated alone rejecting a hurt just saying man i'm trying to wrap up right i'm not saying you all are part of you you're just a bunch of bullies tonight i'm so glad you came tonight i'm so glad you didn't stay home and do netflix i'm glad you came because you're afraid of being called a backslider no you're not the group of bullies but we're challenging groupthink we're challenging when a church culture becomes one where it's just everyone going because they don't want to be considered a certain thing everyone acting because they want to fit the mold that everyone else is doing could you imagine if you had a a a if because you have opinions and opinions become so ingrained within a church or within a group that people have to conduct themselves and conduct their lives and how they raise their children and how they act all by someone else's opinion or other people's opinions and no one has liberty anymore to obey the lord well i feel that for my home the best thing i can do is to send my kids to school i just feel led of the lord that they go to school they go to charter school go to private school but then create a culture in a church where everyone's looking down on the family that's sending their kid to school and now someone feels forced to home school because everyone else in the church is homeschooling i had a brother call me one time didn't even say hello said brother aaron i said hello he goes brother aaron do you have a christmas tree and i was like do i have a christmas tree and i i was like well no he goes okay good he said the church i'm at they're actually putting they're putting pressure on me to have one i thought well that's different and it ought not be that way it shouldn't be that way when someone has a an opinion or idea or someone wants to live a certain way they want to honor the lord with their own convictions who are just pervades to the whole group now everyone wants to do what everyone else is doing and they forfeit their liberty in christ and they merely conform and everyone's going to church because they don't want to be backsliders right and we all stand up at the same time in the songs we all sit down in the same songs right remember to talk about the pastor jerks his head certainly everyone else does the same thing it's the power of the crowd but the bible says this romans chapter 12 verse 2 and be not conformed to this world when it says be not conformed it implies there's a pressure implies there's a force that wants to mold you to an image and we're all susceptible to this in group dynamics and broader dynamics whether it be americans whether it be well maybe it's not fit for arizona because it's become more like california but in texas there's a pride that comes with being in texas and you know what you got to learn to shed that you got to learn to shed the bravado over a name where mcgeary's i remember the megiers could have such a bravado that my cousin leon's like i'm only going to marry a mcgear and you're kind of like well that doesn't really work that way well family identity we're mcgearies we're texans oh yeah lawyers right and you create an identity around what there's a force there's a pressure be not conformed to this world why there's a pressure whether it's on a state level or country level a broader level level to see there's a pressure that wants to make you conform to a particular image and then here's the answer to it be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind and so this transformation by this impact upon your mind it does this that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god so be not conformed to this world in judgment and spirit in an attitude or behavior but let your behavior prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god because you've had the devices in your heart transformed or made subject to the word of god the renewal of our minds by god's transforming power it's the only guard or defense against these devices in our heart because the devices in our hearts yield to the pressure of this world to conform to the group to conform to a group identity to conform to group behavior and we want to realize that we're not merely christians because we're part of a christian church we're part of a particular group here on earth but we have our place in a supernatural body one that is subject to a head one that has the mind of christ and so we do not want to be conformed to this world but we want to be transformed by the renewing of our minds that's the only way we can overcome these devices in our hearts if you'll stand with me sister cassandra if you come i like the song that she's saying is a special feel free to play that all i want to see is jesus brother man makes this statement in the sermon thirsting for life i want this to be our our preamble to this prayer wherever it says the pleasure of a christian is serving the lord at the house of god you don't have to sign no cards you can't open the door quick enough [Music] he's talking about the reason why you go to church i i'm not speaking cryptically or in symbols uh my family we moved across the country following god's leadership to start a church a new church so i i god is dealing with my heart of what kind of what kind of dna is the church going to have what kind of factors are going to be at work do you just want to create a dynamic social structure like a social community where everyone is just benefiting socially we could do that and still have a good church but that's not our goal our goal isn't that we would have church our goal isn't that we'd have all the accoutrements of church and we have the things that you need for church you have church order you have the officers you have this piano player you have the song we have everything that makes up a church without the real vision and purpose of a church being fulfilled so we're confronting them here at the beginning we're addressing group dynamics and the way groups can think because that's not what's influencing us that's that's what causing us to rally together the very beginning we're laying these things down in the foundation so we can always come back to this and challenge us you can even challenge me brother aaron you said brother aaron you read this quote this is what you were wanting this church to be founded on this is the very basis for the leadership of the lord that's reaching out to the lost and the hurting and the scattered sheep this is the reason why we came together not for politics not for party making and not to have some kind of dynamic social gathering but that the will of god would be done and we're looking at who is my neighbor who is it is it only those that go to our church is only those that believe that the seals are open [Music] because those dynamics that work that caused this lawyer to justify himself that caused the thieves to harm a man and hurt him and strip him of his clothing and take his possessions the the the pressure that worked upon the priest to cause him to walk by the pressure that worked upon the levite to forsake rendering aid all those group dynamics and group pressures work upon you now to even do as brother branham said you go to church because you don't want people to think your back's lit you worship because you think if you don't the neighbor is going to think your back's lit [Music] so he says the pleasure of a christian is serving the lord at the house of god you don't have to sign cards you can't open the door quick enough all right for the christian and if the members of the church love one or another enough instead of the little clicks and pulling away from the church they love one another enough he says brother if you love one another so much that it hurts your heart till you get together again that's the way it should be that's the kind of atmosphere i want the word to promote for our church kind of love that we have for each other not a cult of personality not a love for church order not a love for going to church but a real love for one another that's the way it should be he begins to quote the song blessed be the tithe that binds our hearts and christian love the fellowship of kindred mind is like to that above when we asunder part it gives us inward pain but we shall still be joined in heart and hope to meet again he says oh god if we have to take every miracle out of the church we have to take out all the pipe organs and the plush pews give us back to that godly love brotherly love among the people in fellowship if you have to do all that take it back to that again wow did you did you did it hit you like you hit me if you have to take out the pews take out the organs take out all the things that makes church what we think it makes a church he says even take out the miracles but just bring us back to brotherly love and fellowship and togetherness he says do all that and take us back to that again well i think we're a few steps ahead you look around there ain't no pipe organ behind that curtain there's no pews let alone plush ones but even gets down to the miracles i'd rather have love among the people than a bunch of miracles i'd rather have love than a dynamic worship service i'd rather have love than all the signs and wonders and testimonies of this and testimonies of that and comparing ourselves one to another i'd rather have love amongst us than any of those things and he says if you have to do all that just take it back to that godly love brotherly love and fellowship again it's wonderful when you're starting because then you don't have to ask god to take out the plush pews you don't have to ask god to take out the the screaming be three hammond organ you just say lord at the beginning establish us build us upon love godly love and brotherly love among the people and fellowship let's bow our heads and everything that i hold dear lay before the holy consuming fire and almighty every prayer said all my knees lay before the holy consuming fire and all i want to see is jesus all i want to see is him in me and all i want to see is jesus [Music] shining through me all i want to [Music] is [Music] is through me with our heads bowed i want you to ponder even the words to this song could you say lord that's what i want i want them when they see me they see jesus even if it might initially be a fearful sight upon the water let them see jesus even if the image that first strikes their eye is one that they're not familiar with and may cause fear let me have the kind of character that could say fear not let me have the kind of love that could break down barriers and prejudice and defenses and allay the fears of somebody who's been abused and manhandled in the name of the christianity with the using the bible not as a hammer to build but a hammer to destroy you know the bible belt means a different thing to a lot of people it's not just a belt in the geography of america where there's a lot of churches but it's the thing they've been whipped with you can build with a hammer but you can also crush a man's skull with it and we don't want to wield a hammer in such a way that it causes people to see an image that's contrary to that of christ let us challenge ourselves tonight lord if we're going to be part of a body let it be the body of christ if we're going to have a mentality let it be the mentality of christ let nothing be done through strife and vainglory but let each esteem other better than themselves let us not compare ourselves one to another let us not succumb to group dynamics that cause us to think we're better than another oh god help us i'm saying this before we pray let it be this way in our hearts this is our cry lord let them see you and me let it become a foundation i see how the devil would fight this so hard and try to scatter thoughts and minds and try to work against this oh god let us not act a part of a group mentality but let us act as a part of the body of christ truly in spirit and in truth [Music] our gracious heavenly father lord as we bow our heads in prayer lord i'm closing this service now and i'll be dismissing the people but father i'm praying that you would speak to our hearts through this even now lord i believe you have a way of just taking things and tying it up making sense of things lord there's times when a brother could preach a series through several services and then another brother get up and make one statement and all of a sudden everything this brother's been trying to say makes sense lord i believe you could do it within the context of even this church service lord the holy spirit could just come and make sense of these things that were expressed lord i don't want us to leave and be educated lord in how minds work but i would father that we would have a healthy distrust for our biases a healthy distrust of our prejudice a healthy distrust of all these devices that are in our hearts that quickly cause us to join a group and assimilate merely because of devices that work within our minds but lord may we above all be led as sons and daughters of god and lord if we're traveling down life's way may we be like a good samaritan that could act contrary to everyone else who walked before we can do that which is pleasing in your sight not even because the group did it not even because we were told by centralized headquarters what to do but lord because we've tapped into your word we've tapped into your mind we can begin to say and do the things that are appropriate let it be said lord that we act as christians at home that we treat others with respect that we have friends because we show ourselves friendly that our enemies are not readily identifiable by the way that we look at them with contempt or avoid them but rather we have a kind of character that gives the holy spirit liberty commit ourselves to you tonight as we close the service as we're soon dismissed bless the people i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen oh why
