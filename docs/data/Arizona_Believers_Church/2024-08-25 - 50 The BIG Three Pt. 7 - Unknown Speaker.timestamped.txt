[0:00] I'm going to continue on the subject of
[0:03] the big
[0:04] three and just review a few things very
[0:08] quickly from the last uh from Wednesday
[0:10] night and kind of touches on a little
[0:12] bit from last Sunday but we were looking
[0:14] at the big three the lust of the flesh
[0:15] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[0:17] life those have been the few things
[0:18] we've been covering in this series on
[0:20] the big three and how that they are run
[0:24] in Tangent with the uh Temptation Of
[0:27] Money women and popularity and most
[0:30] recently we've been looking at the lust
[0:31] of the eyes and that connection with
[0:32] women as brother B says those
[0:34] Temptations are money women and
[0:36] popularity and how that Samson
[0:38] represents not just the temptation to
[0:40] women but that's associated with the
[0:42] lust of the eyes and how that Samson's
[0:44] life demonstrates in the scripture that
[0:46] he was seduced and deceived LED astray
[0:49] by women not just one time but he found
[0:51] himself being tempted and always put in
[0:53] a compromising situation uh wherein the
[0:57] woman was to blame or at least the the
[1:00] factor in enticing him and as it says in
[1:03] first John that all that is in the world
[1:05] is the lust of the eye the lust of the
[1:07] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[1:08] of life we're saying that these big
[1:10] three are all that is in the world as
[1:12] Satan has designed it has the intent to
[1:14] deceive uh and to distract us if he
[1:17] can't deceive us he certainly wants to
[1:19] distract Us by it wouldn't it be
[1:21] something that if the devil sets
[1:22] something up to deceive and in seeing it
[1:24] and it's deceptive to us and we realize
[1:27] it's deception but all we did is spend
[1:29] our time railing against against it it's
[1:31] just as successful because it's now
[1:33] worked as a distraction and so the lust
[1:36] of the flesh we we identified how that
[1:39] relates to the body and how that we have
[1:41] see taste feel smell and hear and that
[1:43] it's through those channels that we
[1:45] might give some bodily thirst or human
[1:47] needs preeminence and the lust of the
[1:49] flesh drives us we saw that in the
[1:51] garden when the woman saw that it was
[1:53] good for food we see it in the
[1:55] wilderness when Christ was tempted that
[1:57] he was tempted to turn stones to bread
[1:59] and that's the temp ation of the lust of
[2:00] the Flesh and with the lust of the eyes
[2:03] it relates to the the mind of the person
[2:05] the spirit where you have this
[2:06] imagination conscience memory reason and
[2:09] affection and it's in there that you're
[2:11] both emotional and intellectual so we
[2:15] they're they're both guilty together and
[2:17] when one is implicated the other's
[2:19] implicated so if brother brandom's
[2:21] saying something against emotionalism
[2:24] don't desire to be intellectual brother
[2:27] brother BR saying something that kind of
[2:28] tampered down just while enthusiasm
[2:30] without truth he's not just saying that
[2:32] so that we just become intellectual when
[2:35] one is guilty the other is handcuffed to
[2:37] it and the other one is just as guilty
[2:40] because they're both these states of
[2:41] being wherein we are not in the balance
[2:44] of the word of God but we're either
[2:46] distracted or deceived and we're in
[2:47] these fringes so both are guilty and
[2:49] implicated because the spirit of a man
[2:51] can be both emotional and intellectual
[2:54] and at the same time and or they can
[2:57] lean to one or the other in the emphasis
[2:59] of either one at the expense of the
[3:01] truth is just as wrong and as we looked
[3:06] uh on Wednesday I think we spent a lot
[3:07] of time on this looking into the word of
[3:09] God how that Satan has uh manipulated uh
[3:12] humanity and even designed the genders
[3:14] and worked on them in a way to seduce to
[3:17] Blind and then to bind we saw that in
[3:19] Samson where first he's enticed uh and
[3:21] he loses his strength and then he's
[3:23] bound and then he's blinded he loses his
[3:26] insight and this is so both naturally
[3:29] and spirit spiritually how that we can
[3:31] be tempted to lust in the physical but
[3:33] then there's also a spiritual
[3:35] application where there's some
[3:37] unfaithfulness to the word of God and
[3:40] remember always that Satan is the author
[3:42] of The Big Three he's the one that has
[3:44] perverted money he's perverted uh the uh
[3:49] women and he's perverted Fame because we
[3:51] can say well just because someone is
[3:53] known doesn't necessarily mean they're
[3:54] evil uh just because we uh you're a
[3:57] woman doesn't mean you're inherently
[3:58] evil and just because you might have
[4:00] money doesn't mean you're inherently
[4:01] lost but he's perverted those different
[4:03] things so that they can be a distraction
[4:05] or stumbling block or deception and he's
[4:08] the one that does that God is the author
[4:11] of all things pure and righteous he's a
[4:12] giver of good things and we can receive
[4:15] things and know that they're from the
[4:16] hand of the Lord but then Satan wants to
[4:18] twist and pervert and manipulate so that
[4:20] the outcome or the effect of the
[4:22] blessing is not there but some sort of
[4:24] deception or binding and ultimately a
[4:27] blinding I was thinking about this last
[4:30] week and step fellowshipping with my
[4:32] wife and I wanted to and it just was
[4:34] coming to my heart just to point this
[4:36] out as we've been speaking on the house
[4:38] of the Lord and that's the temple or the
[4:40] Tabernacle and we've been making this uh
[4:43] and we spent a lot of time in that area
[4:46] and then we begin to look at the big
[4:47] three and what we've been doing and
[4:49] looking at these Temptations is applying
[4:52] those Temptations of the lust of the
[4:54] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[4:56] of life to you as an individual which is
[4:58] your heart is to be a house of the Lord
[5:01] and to us as a family uh in your own
[5:04] family or your home life and then to the
[5:07] church so as you would have personal
[5:09] Temptations uh that may be money women
[5:11] or popularity personal Temptations in
[5:13] the flesh and the eyes and the pride of
[5:15] life that would relate to you as an
[5:17] individual and how that God desires to
[5:19] have preeminence or to possess you
[5:21] wholly and how that these three things
[5:23] are trying to uh interrupt God's program
[5:26] for your life we could see that in your
[5:28] personal Temptations and within a family
[5:30] it can relate to a family standard and
[5:33] what you emphasize within your home and
[5:35] what you lift up and what has
[5:36] preeminence and then as a church again
[5:38] it just it comes down to what's the
[5:40] character of the church what is its
[5:41] emphasis uh what is its attraction and I
[5:45] think those things work the same way
[5:46] what are you attracted to In the Flesh
[5:47] what does a family lift up as the
[5:49] attraction and so looking at these
[5:51] different things is associated with
[5:53] those themes that we've been identifying
[5:55] in the house of the Lord now right here
[5:58] is where I want to pick up we were on
[5:59] this this Wednesday night the lust of
[6:01] the eyes as we are have we linked it to
[6:04] women and this temptation of women and
[6:06] how Satan uses women it's not just to be
[6:08] tempted to lust after a female or to
[6:11] even as a woman would be tempted to lust
[6:13] after a man that's not just it but it is
[6:16] Beauty and vanity in whatever form
[6:17] Satan's trying to use it in and we see
[6:20] that a woman in scripture represents a
[6:22] church and that woman being
[6:24] representative a church it represents
[6:26] organization represents
[6:28] denominationalism
[6:29] uh denominational Spirits Cult of
[6:31] Personality of movements anything that
[6:34] is uh that Satan is driving anything
[6:37] that he's using to try to keep you from
[6:39] truth in The Sermon Just Once More Lord
[6:41] where brother bradam is using the
[6:43] example of Samson he's talking about the
[6:45] Pentecostal move or the Pentecostal age
[6:47] he says just even take 10 or 15 years
[6:49] back look how it's declined since then
[6:53] look how it's went down down down it's
[6:56] got so it's almost a shame a fella feels
[6:58] embarrassed almost to talk about Divine
[7:00] Healing there's been so much reproach
[7:02] brought upon it he says talk about the
[7:05] Holy Ghost when so much reproach has
[7:08] been brought upon it now these are two
[7:10] tenants that we could say of the
[7:12] restoration of their gifts Divine
[7:13] Healing uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:16] and he's saying that there's been so
[7:17] much nonsense taking place within the
[7:19] Pentecostal movement that even though
[7:21] you would believe in it if you were to
[7:23] say something about Divine Healing
[7:24] there'd be this association with this
[7:26] Pentecostal movement you were to talk
[7:28] about the Holy Ghost it'd be assoc
[7:29] assciated with the Pentecostal movement
[7:31] and brother Bram is not saying he's
[7:33] ashamed to be identified as a Holy
[7:34] Roller he's not saying that he's ashamed
[7:36] to be identified with Divine Healing or
[7:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the
[7:40] manifestation of the spirit in the gifts
[7:42] but he's saying those associated with
[7:44] those things are bringing a reproach on
[7:46] the gospel he said it's not God it's not
[7:48] God it's not God's
[7:51] fault he says it's Samson that has left
[7:53] off the principles of God's word and has
[7:57] substituted something else and let the
[7:59] organization shave him down woo him into
[8:02] it so the Temptation is the organization
[8:06] Samson was tempted by delilo ultimately
[8:08] that was his uh near down complete
[8:10] downfall we know God restored him in the
[8:12] end but there's a substitute and the
[8:16] organization shaves you down and Woos
[8:18] you into the substitute so I encourage
[8:21] you to catch the principle so that you
[8:22] can always make present day application
[8:25] if we're drawing from uh things in the
[8:27] scripture and we say well they didn't
[8:29] have to worry about cell phones then and
[8:30] they didn't have to worry about this and
[8:32] you get real rigid with what God's
[8:34] trying to teach in terms of the
[8:35] principle and you leave it in history
[8:37] and you leave it only in that context
[8:39] you can't catch the thought that God's
[8:41] trying to bring out of it you can get
[8:43] entangled with modern-day applications
[8:45] that you have no the word isn't
[8:47] available to you to defend against it so
[8:49] we want to catch the principle uh for
[8:51] application if it is applicable then the
[8:55] sermon turn on the light he says we've
[8:57] passed around 60 years the the
[8:59] Pentecostals have organized we are this
[9:02] we are that so again this organization
[9:04] is what I'm want you to look at that's
[9:06] that female or the the woman this
[9:08] temptation and it's not uh it's not
[9:10] putting a spotlight on the gender but
[9:12] the church we are this we are that and
[9:15] God has walked right away from it out in
[9:17] Yonder and bringing forth a bride an
[9:19] elect out of that group so God's walked
[9:22] away from this Pentecostal organization
[9:25] or or the temptation of the
[9:27] Pentecostalism to organize
[9:30] and he says God's not working in that
[9:31] anymore he's going to call you out of
[9:32] that he said there'll never be another
[9:34] church age the Philadelphian Church age
[9:36] was Wesley and the Le in church age is
[9:39] the Pentecostal
[9:41] organization which all goes right
[9:43] straight into the mark of the beast
[9:46] that's the Bible as brother was saying a
[9:48] few moments ago now this I'm I'm reading
[9:51] these things to build to this momentous
[9:53] statement they are all them
[9:56] organizations because so now we're
[9:58] getting the definition of what it means
[9:59] to be an organization they're all
[10:01] organizations because they refuse to
[10:03] walk in further light they organize
[10:07] themselves saying we believe this when
[10:10] he says they refuse to walk in further
[10:12] light they may see it but they resist
[10:15] following it they may recognize it to be
[10:17] light but they don't really follow it or
[10:20] to yield themselves to it and submit to
[10:22] it and this is you you can determine
[10:24] this by the way they live the way they
[10:25] act what they emphasize so they are all
[10:28] organizations and you become an
[10:30] organization if you refuse to walk in
[10:33] further light I think of the context of
[10:35] this that you are going to be uh maybe
[10:39] I'm just trying to think of a way to say
[10:41] this and I I'm hoping to expound upon
[10:42] this in a greater way because I believe
[10:45] according to the message of the hour
[10:46] that we should all be Capital K's P
[10:50] Pentecostal we that's what we should be
[10:52] we should be Pentecostal but there's a
[10:54] lot of ideas attached to it that people
[10:55] want to capitalize right and that really
[10:58] in what some ways is what brother bandam
[11:00] called Pentecostalism so there is a
[11:03] genuine Pentecost is a Pentecostal
[11:05] experience that every person must have
[11:06] if you're going to be a part of the body
[11:08] of Christ there's a true Pentecost
[11:09] there's a true restoration of Pentecost
[11:11] and then there's all those things that's
[11:13] associated with it that people want to
[11:14] say is indeed Pentecost but really those
[11:17] things aren't necessarily the
[11:19] Pentecostal experience or what is
[11:22] Pentecost and what happens is they get
[11:24] organized around these other things
[11:26] related to it and as soon as you organ
[11:29] and refuse to walk further in light that
[11:31] is what becomes
[11:34] Pentecostalism was when you refuse to
[11:36] walk further in light said they
[11:37] organized themselves saying we believe
[11:39] this and what is he emphasizing period
[11:42] put a period on it go no further or you
[11:44] just emphasizing some partial truth as
[11:46] we saw in the spirit of balum he could
[11:48] repeat one thing God said but he didn't
[11:50] want to repeat the other because it
[11:52] didn't serve his ends it didn't meet his
[11:54] means and so in failing to walk further
[11:57] in the light we can look at the sense of
[11:59] there's there's no growth there's no
[12:00] maturity they just kind of stay very uh
[12:02] set in their ways and and they're not
[12:05] they're not growing in the word of God
[12:08] so the lure of the eyes the lust of the
[12:10] eyes and as it's typified with this
[12:12] temptation of women I want to say this
[12:14] it'll either hold you back or drag you
[12:18] back the lust of the eyes will either
[12:20] keep you from going forward or make you
[12:22] go backwards this is the Temptation in
[12:25] the wilderness and why so many perished
[12:27] after The Exodus from Egypt is they
[12:28] didn't want to go further into the
[12:30] promised land and some wanted to go back
[12:32] into Egypt and so the lust of the eyes
[12:34] will either keep you from going forward
[12:36] or it'll drag you right back to some
[12:37] other age or some other time and it'll
[12:40] do so by manipulating the mind to
[12:42] intellect or manipulating the mind to
[12:45] emotionalism now in Jude verse 8 well
[12:47] start with verse 8 and we'll read about
[12:50] these that
[12:53] are uh that are being re compared to or
[12:57] the spirit that's being compared to how
[12:59] one was once LED out of but then
[13:02] destroyed because they don't go all the
[13:04] way because of a lack of faith or how
[13:05] that some had first uh habitation but
[13:09] then they fall away and they're going to
[13:10] be facing judgment he says likewise also
[13:13] these filthy dreamers defile the flesh
[13:16] this is you got to think uh in terms of
[13:20] those who have come amongst the Church
[13:21] of God using religion and some sort of
[13:23] spin uh trying to bring people back into
[13:26] bondage they're they're Antichrist
[13:28] though they speak speak of Christ he
[13:30] says they despise dominion and speak
[13:32] evil of dignities now there's a certain
[13:34] personality trait here some kind of
[13:37] outstanding characteristic about the way
[13:38] they talk and what they emphasize he
[13:40] says even Michael when he was disputing
[13:43] with Satan didn't bring railing
[13:45] accusations but just said the Lord
[13:46] rebuke thee so there was not uh there's
[13:50] something in the manner which is
[13:52] betraying what they're saying he says
[13:53] but these speak evil of things which
[13:56] they know not is it this A A like a lot
[13:59] of people where they see something and
[14:01] they just speak against it speak evil of
[14:03] it not even knowing anything about it
[14:06] they speak evil H H uh the spirit of God
[14:08] can move and manifest in a certain way
[14:10] oh that's just a bunch of nonsense God
[14:11] doesn't do that anymore there's no such
[14:13] thing as speaking in tongues there's no
[14:14] such thing is being emotional that's and
[14:16] they just speak EV knowing nothing about
[14:18] it and on the other foot sometimes they
[14:21] see something and it doesn't look the
[14:22] way they want it they just be that's
[14:23] just dead that's cold that's formal
[14:25] God's not in it and they're speaking of
[14:28] things that they don't don't know
[14:30] because if someone's never experienced
[14:31] the Holy Ghost and wept or shouted or
[14:33] felt good because the power of God's
[14:34] moving upon them they can speak evil of
[14:36] it not knowing about it someone's never
[14:38] experienced the depths of the revelation
[14:39] of God's word and how it can just hold
[14:41] you Spellbound when the word is going
[14:43] forth they can speak evil about it not
[14:44] knowing anything about
[14:47] it but they know naturally what they
[14:50] know naturally as brute beast in those
[14:53] things they corrupt themselves we will
[14:55] corrupt ourselves in those things that
[14:57] we can only apprehend naturally naturen
[15:00] whether it be the things of the Mind the
[15:02] lust of the eyes those things which we
[15:03] can know by the body or the flesh we
[15:06] will corrupt ourselves in no matter how
[15:09] we try to phrase them in a way to make
[15:10] it seem spiritual or righteous or good
[15:13] we will corrupt ourselves in those
[15:15] things that we know naturally but it's
[15:17] only in those things that we know by
[15:18] Revelation that are
[15:21] Incorruptible just as there is no amount
[15:23] of gold that you can add to real gold to
[15:25] turn into Fool's Gold there's no amount
[15:28] of word that you can add to Faith to
[15:29] ever make your faith intellectual Faith
[15:33] or a false
[15:35] Faith wo unto them for they have gone in
[15:38] the way of Cain I'm reading all these
[15:40] things to focus on this first indictment
[15:42] they have gone in the way of Cain and
[15:44] ran greedily after the heir of balam for
[15:46] reward and perished in the gainsaying of
[15:48] Kora the heir of balam for reward
[15:51] there's your temptation to money there's
[15:52] the lust of the flesh the gain saying of
[15:54] Kora is rooted in the pride of life I
[15:56] think we're going to pick up on that
[15:58] maybe Wednesday next Sunday those things
[16:00] are uh related to The Big Three and I'm
[16:03] just putting it in this way so that we
[16:05] can apprehend it I'm not making that a
[16:06] Doctrine if you don't necessarily see
[16:08] that you're you're out and you're
[16:10] disagreeing with something you don't
[16:12] know of but we're just using it as a way
[16:14] for the scripture to come alive to you
[16:15] and comprehend it they've gone in the
[16:17] way of Cain ran greedily after the heir
[16:19] of balum for reward and perished in the
[16:21] gain saying of Kora as we've examined
[16:24] Samson let's look at the way of Cain in
[16:28] Judas we we've already read from verse
[16:29] four we see that he's associated with
[16:31] the spirit of Seduction these filthy
[16:33] dreamers they defile the flesh he's
[16:35] associated with uh rebellion and
[16:37] Disobedience we know that Cain was a
[16:40] murderer who envied the simple worship
[16:42] of his brother
[16:44] Abel and we could even say this that
[16:46] Cain really at the core was a son of the
[16:49] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[16:51] and the pride of life he was the product
[16:53] of that Temptation and those three
[16:55] aspects of it in the beginning and as a
[16:57] matter of fact we say all that is in the
[16:59] world the less of the flesh the less of
[17:00] the eyes and the pride of life produced
[17:03] Cain and he's the reason why we have the
[17:04] big three because it it all comes from
[17:07] that
[17:08] tree in the sermon the mark of the beast
[17:11] and the Seal of God part two I think we
[17:14] read some of this on Wednesday but we
[17:17] we're going to read just back up a
[17:18] couple sentences brother B's talking
[17:20] about these signs shall follow them that
[17:21] believe and how that that's a scriptural
[17:24] principle that you can't reject you
[17:26] can't do away with and and having spent
[17:29] some time looking at those things and
[17:31] what man can make of it and what those
[17:33] signs are that follow the believer and
[17:35] that God's the one that will do it and
[17:37] it's a promise and we believe that he
[17:38] does he he's using that as a truth and
[17:42] emphasizing how some people might want
[17:44] to water that down or get away from and
[17:45] he says you can't get out of the
[17:47] Scripture it brings itself right back
[17:49] and balances itself up each time that's
[17:52] what scripture does it's only when you
[17:54] get out of scripture that you get
[17:55] imbalanced but if you stay in scripture
[17:57] if there's one scripture there's another
[17:59] scripture and it all brings this great
[18:01] balance he says but Cain he wanted
[18:03] something
[18:04] beautiful Beauty that's the attraction
[18:07] of the eye the Catholic Church learned
[18:08] that long ago that through the eye is
[18:10] the gate to the soul to make Beauty and
[18:12] so forth and the people fall for
[18:14] that when you travel not so much in in
[18:18] America but in South America Central
[18:20] America and even around the world
[18:22] sometimes the most beautiful places and
[18:24] the greatest tourist attractions are
[18:27] Cathedrals and they're orn and they're
[18:29] dramatic and they were the tallest
[18:31] buildings in the world at their time and
[18:33] existed for sometimes centuries as the
[18:35] tallest structure because as we look at
[18:38] it here if we put it in this context
[18:39] they learned that if the eye can be
[18:41] enamored with it if you can catch the
[18:43] eye you can catch the heart if you can
[18:45] get somebody through the visual if you
[18:47] can get someone in the mind if you can
[18:48] win somebody's passions uh then you've
[18:50] gained their commitment you've gained
[18:52] their faith and that's how that he says
[18:55] uh Hollywood learned that a long time
[18:56] ago the devil knew it before you did
[18:58] that's exactly right that's the
[19:00] technique he works on the same thing he
[19:03] set himself a more beautiful kingdom
[19:05] it's always been beautiful so this is
[19:08] Satan's method of operation he worked
[19:10] solely in Beauty again you can't take
[19:13] the opposite of that and say oh where
[19:14] it's ugly it's God that's not what's
[19:17] meant but Satan Works only in Beauty so
[19:20] that it's a Whited supper but inside is
[19:22] death uh it it's it's presenting itself
[19:25] one way in reality it's hypocrisy uh and
[19:28] it's it's not what it is purported to be
[19:30] so there's a Satan Works in Beauty he
[19:34] works through the eye the attraction of
[19:36] the eye and that's what was working on
[19:39] Cain this is what works in the way of
[19:45] Cain brother bam continues don't look at
[19:47] Beauty look at truth not Beauty that's
[19:51] what's the matter with the church today
[19:52] it's jumping for beauty and
[19:54] dying that's right because it gets death
[19:58] so it's jumping for for beauty now there
[20:02] is a going back to the house of the Lord
[20:04] this may seem real directed towards
[20:06] church uh in US as Believers and the
[20:08] spirits that exist in the age today to
[20:10] defile our thoughts or distract us or
[20:12] deceive us and that's certainly true but
[20:15] make application to Family Life make
[20:17] application to your individual life how
[20:19] that we could be jumping for beauty in
[20:22] its corrupting we find that Cain went
[20:24] from God and took himself a wife out of
[20:27] another group in the land of nod that's
[20:29] exactly what the man does that will not
[20:32] come up and worship God in spirit and
[20:35] Truth Listen a man that wants worship
[20:37] God in spirit and Truth he goes off and
[20:40] gets him a church that will satisfy him
[20:42] now gets him a church that'll satisfy
[20:44] him where in the soul in the faith in
[20:48] the word or satisfy him outwardly in a
[20:51] way that he wants to be tickled in the
[20:53] way that he wants to be itched in the
[20:56] sermon the faith that was once delivered
[20:57] to the Saints he said says Cain was
[20:59] justified if God only required that an
[21:02] altar or worship said but God rejected
[21:04] him because his Spirit only looked to a
[21:06] thing
[21:08] temporal I'm wanting to show you
[21:10] according to the word of God what the
[21:12] lust of the eye is related to what this
[21:15] temptation to women is related to the
[21:17] way of Cain which looks for beauty jumps
[21:20] at be Beauty and only looks at something
[21:23] temporal the things that will fade the
[21:26] things that have to constantly be uh
[21:28] followed up on I think one of the things
[21:30] that comes up in uh some news reporting
[21:32] now in some studies is what are the
[21:35] long-term ramifications of
[21:37] Botox right and they're saying well this
[21:38] stuff was supposed to be gone years ago
[21:40] and it stays in people's system and who
[21:42] knows what's going to happen they might
[21:43] start birthing plastic
[21:45] children but there's uh there these
[21:48] things are temporal they they they fade
[21:50] away they go away and and Mankind is
[21:52] only interested in certain things that
[21:54] only last temporarily in the mind in the
[21:58] body that will ultimately
[22:01] die that man can
[22:03] destroy that can be healed in a
[22:06] Fantastical way in a miraculous way but
[22:08] only to get sick again a body that can
[22:11] uh praise God and shout and be happy and
[22:13] turn right around and
[22:14] sin and defile it so there's it's this
[22:18] interest in temporal things he says he
[22:20] was the nature of his daddy his daddy
[22:23] wanted a great big beautiful Church in
[22:24] heaven better than Michael he got kicked
[22:26] out of heaven for there so hears his
[22:29] nature down here beautifying The
[22:33] Altar and here it is yet today they make
[22:36] a big fine churches and he says you
[22:38] Pentecostal people are just as bad off
[22:40] as the rest of
[22:42] them that's the attention to temporal
[22:46] details and not Eternal things and the
[22:50] sermon marriage and divorce brother Bram
[22:52] says Satan is the one who features that
[22:53] kind of beauty if we'll notice he was
[22:55] the most beautiful of all the angels in
[22:57] heaven and he Des to make Heaven a more
[22:59] beautiful place than the kingdom of
[23:01] Michael if we could say this that heaven
[23:05] was created by or formed or manifested
[23:08] by the word of God the word is
[23:11] enough I but Satan felt like well if we
[23:14] could just add a few things to this then
[23:18] uh we can make it better but God's word
[23:21] is enough whatever it is whatever it
[23:23] looks like whatever it holds these signs
[23:25] shall follow them that believe it
[23:26] doesn't matter if you think that's
[23:28] radical or ugly B being baptized in the
[23:30] name of Jesus Christ full immersion that
[23:32] seems ridiculous it's the word it's
[23:34] beautiful in itself it's perfect in
[23:36] itself you don't have to add to it but
[23:39] there's this way of Cain that doesn't
[23:41] want to just look at Faith or Revelation
[23:43] but says I can improve
[23:45] that I make I can make that
[23:48] better said also to show that Cain was
[23:52] his son the son of that Spirit the son
[23:55] of that ideology he offered a more
[23:56] beautiful worship decorated his altars
[23:58] with fruits and flowers and so forth
[24:00] beautiful sin is beautiful what we call
[24:03] today sin is deceiving by Beauty says
[24:05] you'll never you'd never look at a woman
[24:07] going down the street and tell her
[24:08] what's in her heart but I wanted to say
[24:10] these things that you can see see why
[24:13] that Satan is her designer and think the
[24:14] way he's saying is you would never just
[24:15] walk up to a woman and say you may be
[24:17] beautiful but spiritually you're ugly
[24:20] right he's not wanting to do that but
[24:22] he's saying I wanted to say these things
[24:24] so you could see how Satan is her
[24:25] designer he said that's exactly right
[24:26] his own son proved it came
[24:29] I know that's maybe heavy language but
[24:32] Cain then being the the son of that
[24:34] Spirit birth through the lust of the
[24:36] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[24:38] of life was in his nature that when he
[24:40] went to worship and build an altar that
[24:43] what he built was something beautiful
[24:46] and without much consideration as to
[24:48] whether or not it's accepted now we
[24:51] could say well what why blame him he's
[24:54] born that way right he's born that way
[24:56] he this is all that he knew and even
[24:58] brother says as he was taught by his
[24:59] parents in the garden so maybe there was
[25:01] a way that Adam and the woman were koi a
[25:03] little bit and didn't exactly tell him
[25:05] and so he just kind of goes with what he
[25:07] knows and he tries to offer it in such a
[25:09] way to where H HH he's being sincere and
[25:12] brother brandom even says he wasn't
[25:13] being a smart alec he was being sincere
[25:15] he worshiped he was sincere in every way
[25:18] that Abel was but the way of Cain when
[25:21] it says way it's a way of thinking
[25:23] feeling and acting a way is the way you
[25:25] think the way you feel the way you act
[25:29] if you feel a certain way you'll act
[25:30] according to those feels if you think a
[25:32] certain way you'll act way so whether
[25:33] you're emotional or intellectual
[25:35] ultimately your way is way of thinking
[25:38] feeling and acting and the way of Cain
[25:41] it's a very interesting word as I was
[25:44] studying trying to study it out in the
[25:46] Hebrew and there's a lot of a lot of
[25:48] Rich scholarship and I won't uh wow you
[25:51] with slides on the Hebrew but it comes
[25:53] from even the when Eve said I have
[25:56] gotten a man from the Lord
[25:58] that it's uh she has Acquired and so
[26:01] he's named Cain and it seems the the
[26:04] verb acquired or got the connect in the
[26:07] in the Hebrew that the name is uh
[26:09] closely associated with that which means
[26:12] we we translate to buyer or acquire but
[26:15] it also is associated with and means to
[26:19] make or
[26:21] fabricate and it's to forge to fit
[26:24] together so Kane is a maker he's a
[26:27] fabricator one that fits together and he
[26:29] forges so this is at his heart this is
[26:32] in his nature but now as after he has
[26:35] offered up spiritual sacrif or he's
[26:37] offered up a sacrifice to the Lord and
[26:39] God has respect to Abel's sacrifice at
[26:42] that moment in his sincerity he could
[26:44] have said Abel that was amazing how did
[26:49] that happen yours was the smelliest
[26:51] ugliest scariest thing I've ever seen in
[26:54] my life over there whacking at a lamb
[26:57] and it's bleeding and it's blood
[26:59] everywhere and it's crazy and I'm over
[27:01] here with Cales and everything's very
[27:03] beautiful and you can eat it afterwards
[27:05] and everything's great and God respected
[27:08] yours but not mine let's let's what what
[27:11] happened but he gets
[27:13] jealous and in his jealousy and rage God
[27:16] comes to him and says hey if you just do
[27:18] right you'll be accepted and the way of
[27:21] Cain manifest itself because Cain
[27:23] doesn't say all right I'll go talk to
[27:25] Abel and we'll I'll I'll find out what I
[27:27] can do I I I want to be right he goes to
[27:31] Abel and murders him he kills him and
[27:35] then after he kills his brother God
[27:38] curses him and at that point surely
[27:42] Cain is not just Bound By Nature and
[27:46] nurture surely at that point he has seen
[27:48] enough externally and supernaturally to
[27:51] provoke some good in his heart somewhere
[27:53] to say oh my goodness what has happened
[27:55] to me I've become murderous in my my
[27:58] mistakes even I was sincere and I was
[28:00] corrected but I'm not and surely at that
[28:03] moment so let's see what the way of Cain
[28:05] is God said I'm going to put a mark on
[28:08] you or or he says I'm going to banish
[28:10] you and send you out and he goes here's
[28:13] the way of Cain Genesis 4: 13- 14 and
[28:16] Cain said unto the Lord my punishment is
[28:20] greater than I can
[28:22] bear yeah what about Abel's
[28:25] punishment right
[28:28] and he's he's the
[28:30] victim my I'm being persecuted My
[28:33] Punishment is greater than I could bear
[28:36] I I I've worshiped I've praised you I've
[28:38] done what you've asked behold thou Hast
[28:40] driven me out this day from the face of
[28:42] the Earth and from th thy face shall I
[28:44] be hid and I shall be a fugitive and a
[28:46] vagabond in the earth and it shall come
[28:47] to pass that everyone that findeth me
[28:49] shall slay me what you will not find in
[28:52] this is any
[28:54] repentance any hint whatsoever about the
[28:57] fact that his own half brother was just
[29:00] murdered nothing about the fact that he
[29:02] just robbed life as the first murderer
[29:06] he's only worried about what his image
[29:09] and his
[29:10] flesh he's only worried about what
[29:12] people think about him and what will
[29:14] happen to him he has nothing offered in
[29:18] any way whatsoever to say I'm sorry what
[29:20] can I
[29:22] do how how can we fix this he you know
[29:25] what he could have said my punishment is
[29:28] greater than I can bear but I've earned
[29:30] every bit of it my punishment is greater
[29:33] than I can bear I'll be a fugitive I'll
[29:35] be a vagabond people seek to slay me but
[29:38] I've brought this upon myself nothing of
[29:41] that in other words he's pleading to God
[29:44] hey could you kind of protect me a
[29:46] little bit
[29:47] here and then you'll find that Cain's
[29:50] ways manifested in his family in the
[29:52] civilization they form this is at the
[29:54] heart of the way of Cain the pretense
[29:56] the Optics the the image the the flesh
[29:59] do you realize what it would have meant
[30:00] for him to Humble himself to Abel and
[30:02] say you were right I was
[30:05] wrong and instead of doing that he
[30:07] postured and became
[30:09] murderous we know today that all it
[30:11] takes is to speak against someone
[30:14] wrongfully and murder their character to
[30:16] be of The Same
[30:19] Spirit Cain's way is manifested then in
[30:21] the sons that he begins to Bear the
[30:23] civilization they begin to form they
[30:25] built cities they made instruments
[30:26] musical instruments they forged weapons
[30:28] and armor they were
[30:32] Smiths any Smiths here
[30:34] today that the name Smith it's in tuban
[30:38] it speaks of someone like a gold smith
[30:40] or a blacksmith they were they were uh
[30:42] they had they were Tradesmen who formed
[30:44] things and fabricated things literally
[30:46] Cain is and some say literally A Smith
[30:50] this is in the nature of Cain the way of
[30:51] Cain is to build something to look good
[30:54] he built the city they built instruments
[30:56] they built weapons and armor they they
[30:58] they forg themselves a mighty
[31:02] image and the way of Cain we know
[31:05] scripturally leads to Vain
[31:07] worship Rebellion without
[31:12] consequence works with no
[31:15] heart worship without
[31:17] truth there are a number of ways that we
[31:19] could begin to emphasize what the way of
[31:21] Cain is and it's the way of Cain that
[31:24] spreads through all the face of the
[31:25] Earth so look at Genesis 6: 1 to
[31:30] 8 Genesis 6: 1-8 I'm wanting you to
[31:34] ident see here the way of Cain and it
[31:37] came to pass when men be to multiply in
[31:39] the face of the Earth and daughters were
[31:41] born unto them that the sons of God saw
[31:44] the daughters of men that they were fair
[31:47] and they took them wise of all which
[31:48] they chose now do you recognize what
[31:50] just happened the sons of
[31:53] Cain were having do and their daughters
[31:56] and the sons of Seth
[31:58] saw them that they were beautiful and
[32:01] married them chose them so this is where
[32:04] there's this mixing there's this
[32:06] intermingling these beautiful daughters
[32:08] of Cain this is where you can see then
[32:10] the way of Cain through Beauty through
[32:12] seduction through the woman and the sons
[32:14] of God see them begin to marry and the
[32:16] Lord said my spirit shall not always
[32:17] strive with men for that he also is
[32:20] flesh yet his days shall be 120 years
[32:23] there were giants in the earth in those
[32:25] days and also after that when the sons
[32:28] of God came in unto the daughters of men
[32:30] and they bear children to them and the
[32:33] same became Mighty Men which were of old
[32:36] men of renown this is the way of Cain as
[32:40] That civilization begin to mix with
[32:42] those that called upon the name of the
[32:44] Lord those humble sons and civil family
[32:47] of Seth uh uh through Adam and the woman
[32:49] through Adam and Eve as they begin to
[32:52] marry into that family they begin to
[32:54] take on the identity of the way of Cain
[32:57] and they were caught up in the beauty
[32:59] became men of renown less humble less
[33:02] seeking of God to where verse 5 and God
[33:05] saw that the wickedness of man was great
[33:06] in the earth and that every imagination
[33:08] of the thoughts of his heart was only
[33:10] evil
[33:11] continually and it repented the Lord
[33:13] that he made man on the earth and it
[33:15] grieved him at his heart and the Lord
[33:17] said I will destroy man whom I have
[33:19] created from the face of the Earth both
[33:20] man and Beast and the creeping thing and
[33:22] the fouls of the air for it repenteth me
[33:24] that I've made them but Noah found Grace
[33:27] in the eyes of the Lord he was one who
[33:30] had
[33:31] resisted this beauty this way of Cain we
[33:36] see here in Genesis 6 that the daughters
[33:38] of Cain lured the sons of Seth through
[33:40] Beauty through seduction and lust and
[33:43] the product was Men of
[33:46] renown uh Giants and great
[33:49] Beauty and brother bradam looking at
[33:51] Cain in the way of Cain he says oh those
[33:53] reprobates are religious they're smart
[33:56] they are the Cain
[33:58] line the serpent seed now before we
[34:02] start looking around for literal
[34:03] serpents in here if you're born of a
[34:07] woman you're
[34:09] hybrid he said they build their battles
[34:12] they babbles they build their cities
[34:14] they build their Empires and all the
[34:16] while calling on God it's religious
[34:19] cults right they build their cities
[34:22] their Empires Their Kingdoms their Cults
[34:25] all the while calling on God
[34:28] over and over again brother Bram
[34:29] identifies the way of Cain or Cain with
[34:32] false religion false Vine falsely
[34:33] anointed false Union false uh wife false
[34:37] church over and over and over again he
[34:39] said there's a false Holy Ghost baptism
[34:42] a false Holy Spirit baptism he said the
[34:44] devil is impersonated because he's
[34:46] religious Cain his father was religious
[34:48] so there's even a false Holy Spirit
[34:50] baptism in the way of
[34:55] Cain now
[34:58] I have several quotations I want to read
[35:00] to you here uh to emphasize this to the
[35:03] message of the hour on this lust of the
[35:06] eye capitalizing how it can work on you
[35:09] as an individual and I think you can you
[35:11] can think in terms of lust how the world
[35:13] is trying to find some way to get in
[35:15] your mind to lust and to act upon that
[35:17] lust in a physical sense in that real
[35:19] visceral fleshly sense but then there's
[35:22] also these temptations that we can have
[35:24] on a family level uh where we're drawn
[35:26] to certain things lust of the eye then
[35:28] there's this spiritual application that
[35:30] I'm looking at right now but it has
[35:32] brought application we'll try to move
[35:34] through this rather quickly I'm taking
[35:36] these from all sermons once more just
[35:39] once more and different places where
[35:41] brother brandham is ministering on the
[35:43] example of Samson he said and here he
[35:45] stands Samson the last organization of
[35:48] the church
[35:49] Pentecost was just as
[35:51] defeated as Samson was so here he stands
[35:55] and then he says Pentecost this
[35:57] afternoon was just as defeated as Samson
[35:59] was you might not believe that but
[36:00] you'll just open your mind to the word
[36:02] you'll see it's the truth they had him
[36:04] doing tricks for
[36:06] entertainment I I want you to think very
[36:09] deeply about this lust of the flesh lust
[36:11] of the eye he said what's the matter
[36:12] with this diluted Church the world has
[36:14] punctured its eyes don't you know Jesus
[36:17] said this would happen and when the
[36:18] sleeping virgin come to buy oil she
[36:20] never got it there's the sleeping virgin
[36:22] Lutheran method Methodist Presbyterian
[36:24] they're not getting it they might speak
[36:26] with tongues and jump but that don't
[36:28] mean anything I've seen heathens do the
[36:31] same thing devil worshippers speak in
[36:32] tongues jump Sing and Shout drink blood
[36:34] out of a human skull and call on the
[36:36] devil and speak in tongues don't you
[36:39] rely on Sensations it's the word of God
[36:42] that don't come it's the word of God
[36:44] that don't pass there she is defeated
[36:47] just as much as Samson Was Defeated
[36:49] doing tricks now how Satan stands up and
[36:52] laughs at them saying look they claim
[36:54] they believe the Bible look now some
[36:57] could probably take this say don't rely
[36:59] on Sensations and try to drive that down
[37:00] to say Sensations are of the devil but
[37:02] guess what Sensations are Sensations are
[37:05] of the
[37:06] human right Sensations are of the
[37:09] living and the holy spirit moves and
[37:12] it's just human to respond to it but the
[37:16] caution is don't cabbage down on a
[37:19] physiological response to a supernatural
[37:22] thing and tell yourself that because you
[37:24] could say yes to it or you could feel it
[37:27] that that's enough so it's it's he's not
[37:30] trying to become uh one-sided here but
[37:32] he's saying you might speak with tongues
[37:33] you might jump you might dance you might
[37:35] shout but if you're only doing that
[37:38] you're doing tricks for
[37:40] entertainment if that's the emphasis if
[37:43] that's the must if that's the have to if
[37:46] that's what makes us the bride's Revival
[37:48] as we do that that's
[37:50] easy if that we'll just take we'll just
[37:53] have dance
[37:55] lessons well we'll get a vocal coach
[37:57] that can teach us how to shout and not
[37:58] lose our voice this that would be the
[38:01] easiest bar to be a
[38:03] bride is if we could just make it magic
[38:06] to learn to do tricks little smoking
[38:07] mirrors and make people think God's
[38:09] moving says don't rely on Sensations
[38:11] it's the word that'll never pass away he
[38:14] says they're defeated Delilah has
[38:16] punctured their eyes so they can't see
[38:17] the
[38:19] truth says another thing about a lot of
[38:21] this modern evangelism today all the way
[38:23] from Pentecost all the way back it's a
[38:25] bunch of Hollywood Showmanship
[38:29] ship he says I see the spirit of
[38:31] Hollywood I see the spirit of world I
[38:32] see the spirit of
[38:34] Glamour go right on through I've been 15
[38:36] years preaching against it just
[38:37] worsening all the time I can see it I
[38:39] can see the spirit there but where is
[38:41] the spirit of God that can grasp God
[38:44] that can recognize the word itself when
[38:46] it's made manifest can recognize
[38:50] truth notice this Jun Theos of the word
[38:54] of God being made manifest and revealed
[38:56] and somebody saying I that it's revealed
[38:58] to them that's truth not what they know
[39:00] as Man by their corrupt desires and by
[39:02] their fleshly desires but something that
[39:04] they can only know by Revelation he says
[39:06] where is the spirit of God that can
[39:07] recognize the word recognize
[39:09] truth not just the visual things he said
[39:12] only the spirit of God can do that you
[39:15] take you can take glitter polish
[39:18] Showmanship Samson had just a big a body
[39:21] as he ever had but his strength was
[39:22] taken from him the church Pentecost
[39:25] today stands
[39:27] have they swapped the truth for glitter
[39:30] for poers for Showmanship do we do the
[39:33] same in our individual lives do we do it
[39:35] as a family where we're we're we're
[39:36] postering to look good and to fit in to
[39:39] have the Instagram life are we doing
[39:40] things so that we can look like we have
[39:42] everything put
[39:43] together you can take glitter polish and
[39:45] Showmanship he says but this Pentecostal
[39:48] modern evangelism today is a bunch of
[39:50] Hollywood Showmanship it's platform
[39:54] posturing it it it's it's all about the
[39:58] show he said what a condition it is an
[40:01] air he says if we could only stop like
[40:04] Samson did and just think a moment of
[40:05] what we're supposed to be by God's Bible
[40:08] not a great big something not going
[40:10] keeping up with the Joneses but a humble
[40:11] reverent Spirit-filled little group of
[40:13] people not shining glowing Hollywood
[40:16] shines the gospel glows we want
[40:19] something shiny the biggest churches
[40:21] we've ever had we'd be better off if we
[40:23] stood down at the valley in the alley in
[40:24] a store room and have the spirit of God
[40:26] back on us again
[40:28] again the way of Cain big beautiful
[40:31] flashy Showmanship doing things for
[40:35] show he knew Samson knew there was a
[40:39] possibility but the thing of it today is
[40:41] the people don't seem to have have come
[40:43] conscious that there is a
[40:45] possibility they're satisfied to go
[40:47] right on down the old Trend they're
[40:49] going don't do that believe God have
[40:53] faith in him now they say oh they we sit
[40:56] tight that's right we'll clap our hands
[40:58] and everything and Shout but you were
[41:00] all sails and no anchor how can you clap
[41:03] your hands and shout and deny the word
[41:04] being the
[41:07] truth how can you clap your hands and
[41:09] shout and the Holy Spirit will walk
[41:10] among you and then you say oh it's
[41:11] telepathy it's something that's just not
[41:14] worth
[41:15] it think of what he's trying to call out
[41:18] again make this catch the concept and
[41:20] the principle so the spirit can make
[41:22] application we have Great Gatherings
[41:24] glitter worldly tinsil great meetings
[41:25] and what do we get more members the
[41:27] Pentecostal Church three years ago put
[41:29] more members in it than all the rest of
[41:30] the churches together all kinds of
[41:33] scholarship men learned to talk in
[41:34] schools and say their speeches
[41:37] intellectual Hollywood showmen pardon
[41:39] the expression preaching to a bunch of
[41:41] so-called Pentecostal
[41:44] grandchildren this is what Samson
[41:48] represents Hollywood
[41:50] showman Hollywood
[41:53] Showmanship Hollywood shining tinsel
[41:56] glitter
[41:58] Polish people who have learned to
[42:00] talk maybe it does manifest itself in
[42:03] cold intellectualism where there's just
[42:05] inspired preaches uh preachers just
[42:07] teaching things and the congregation
[42:09] just doing its best to try to absorb it
[42:11] as brother Brandon called out and and
[42:13] that's one ditch that's one side that's
[42:15] one lust of the eye and the lust of the
[42:17] flesh but on the other side too when we
[42:19] implicate the intellectual when we
[42:21] implicate the emotional they're both
[42:22] joined together guilty Hollywood Showman
[42:27] and brother Bram says this and just once
[42:29] more Lord and I believe these are from
[42:31] shreport if you look at uh brother Jack
[42:34] Moore that Pentecostal faith that he
[42:38] had so where voice of healing began and
[42:41] started and Noti the things brother Bram
[42:42] says they call for Revival Revival
[42:44] Revival reval but they haven't
[42:46] recognized The Awakening of the Bride
[42:48] they can feel the pull of the hour
[42:50] there's a way that they can express
[42:52] themselves in worship and praise and the
[42:54] gifts but they miss the truth
[42:57] now anybody could say well we're not
[43:00] rejecting truth but by their fruits
[43:02] you'll know them when they say well
[43:04] we've received the full word of God but
[43:06] you don't have to do this you have to do
[43:08] that and this doesn't matter but this
[43:09] matters and they begin to say this is
[43:11] what we believe and put a period on it
[43:12] and they won't walk further in the light
[43:14] they can say well we believe the light
[43:16] well then come on into it they are they
[43:18] that are categorized as borderline
[43:20] believers they have entered into the
[43:22] promised land with the bride and fought
[43:24] for a season but they wanted their
[43:25] inheritance on the wrong WR side of
[43:27] Jordan and they've gone back on the
[43:29] other side of Jordan to settle down and
[43:32] erect a very large altar in a large
[43:34] Church to intimidate and to threaten
[43:36] those who've settled in their Promised
[43:44] Land he says something has stripped her
[43:47] talking about the church the same thing
[43:49] that stripped Samson all caused by
[43:51] listening to a woman that took him in
[43:54] and what stripped the church is
[43:55] listening to that organized woman
[43:57] situation I like the way he just phrased
[43:59] that the organized women woman situation
[44:02] words it doesn't have to be an
[44:03] officialorg doesn't have to be an actual
[44:04] denomination it just has to be an
[44:06] organized woman
[44:09] situation and O
[44:12] WS they have a little code now
[44:15] oh and he
[44:17] says and what stripped the church is
[44:19] listening to the organized woman
[44:21] situation that old Jezebel the very
[44:24] thing that Samson had been raised up to
[44:26] defeat had defeated
[44:28] him and the Pentecostal Church stands in
[44:31] those same tracks
[44:33] tonight the very thing they were called
[44:35] out of the very thing that the
[44:37] restoration of the gifts the very thing
[44:40] that the move of God in the last age was
[44:41] to call them out of was an organized
[44:44] Philadelphia age an organization they've
[44:46] gone right back into it the very thing
[44:48] she was raised up to defeat
[44:50] denominationalism she's grouped herself
[44:52] back into it again and her power is gone
[44:54] the power of the Lord left her by what
[44:57] organizing he says
[45:01] denominationalism he says how Samson had
[45:03] failed him the very nation that Samson
[45:06] was raised up to destroy had bound him
[45:08] and the very thing that God raised
[45:09] Pentecost to do has them bound stripped
[45:12] of Fellowship stripped of power fussing
[45:14] stewing lukewarm
[45:18] members that's the that's the mark that
[45:20] you read it in
[45:22] Jude the very thing that Pentecost
[45:25] represented
[45:28] unorganized non-denominational they
[45:31] begin to organize around what
[45:34] doctrinal their own doctrines their own
[45:36] Creeds
[45:38] evidences they begin to try divide lines
[45:41] and split up it's the spirit of
[45:43] denominationalism to put a period to
[45:45] emphasize One Truth at the expense of
[45:47] others and he says what caused it it was
[45:51] not exactly his natural eyes put out but
[45:53] it was his spiritual sight put out that
[45:55] he let Delila wo him into it so it's not
[45:59] the natural sight Lost first it's
[46:00] spiritual and that's what's hindered the
[46:02] church today is the spiritual Insight of
[46:04] the word of God has been swapped for a
[46:06] bunch of Creeds remember the deed the
[46:09] doctrine and
[46:10] death maybe something happens but then
[46:13] you make it a standard the unbending way
[46:14] you make it a
[46:17] Creed that's the eye the devil has first
[46:20] thing could do is put your eyes out and
[46:21] tell you it's a bunch of Holy Rollers
[46:23] it's this it's that or the other or some
[46:25] Devil's mood move or Al telepathy or
[46:27] something on that order if you could
[46:29] punch your eyes out you're in
[46:31] darkness like well you're spending a lot
[46:32] of time emphasizing emotionalism and
[46:35] shouting and dancing well I'm doing it
[46:36] as brother brandham says it trying to
[46:38] keep with what he said and guess what if
[46:41] he's given a a rebuke to those who
[46:43] emphasize emotions he rebukes those who
[46:45] criticize it say it's nothing but a
[46:47] bunch of holy rollers and Devil's move
[46:49] and mental telepathy and some emotional
[46:51] workup I spent my time last week reading
[46:53] over statements where brother bam was
[46:55] calling out that spirit that criticized
[46:56] IES a genuine move of God that can
[46:59] manifest itself on human beings what
[47:01] else are they supposed to do right
[47:03] spirit of God can move in an audience
[47:05] and people cry and people dance and
[47:06] there's a shout that goes up and there's
[47:08] an order to it and there's times where
[47:10] brother the most powerful anointing
[47:11] you're Spellbound you're quiet you're
[47:13] sober he tells you to sober up when he's
[47:15] teaching onc in one place he says you
[47:17] need to qu we need to quiet ourselves
[47:19] down so we can catch this back in
[47:21] Genesis and what is he trying to do is
[47:23] to keep us out of some modality or some
[47:26] uh H uh tradition that we rest in saying
[47:29] we've got to and see the truth of the
[47:31] word of God and accept it and embrace it
[47:33] and let it do its
[47:35] thing so yes there's a finger pointed at
[47:38] the intellectuals the cult the formal
[47:40] the word rejectors who say well we
[47:42] believe the word of God we believe the
[47:43] revelation we believe the open of the
[47:44] word but then call something that is of
[47:46] god Unholy and the same goes to those
[47:49] who say we're not word rejectors we
[47:51] believe the word but then right out of
[47:52] their own mouth they deemphasize truth
[48:00] Genesis
[48:02] 4:3 says in the process of time it came
[48:05] to pass that Cain brought of the fruit
[48:07] of the ground an offering unto the Lord
[48:09] Brother bam says Cain built an altar and
[48:11] he says an altar is a church a place of
[48:13] worship so what he wanted to be and
[48:16] being like God was something different
[48:18] than God so what he wanted to be and
[48:19] being like God was something different
[48:22] than God is there is equality there
[48:25] because you realize there's some that
[48:27] Satan is an impersonator so he wanted to
[48:29] be like God he wanted to be like the
[48:31] most high when your eyes are open you'll
[48:32] become as Gods there was something in
[48:34] his gospel that's not too far off maybe
[48:36] in the fundamental structure of what God
[48:38] wants in a wife or in his bride but the
[48:41] difference is what God is the difference
[48:43] is in who he really is in his character
[48:46] and so some people have the conception
[48:47] that Jesus is a John Wayne he's a Rambo
[48:49] he's a Donald Trump and so that's what
[48:51] they think the word is and that's what
[48:52] they want to become and it's not wrong
[48:54] to be like Christ but when your Christ
[48:56] is Antichrist it's
[48:59] wrong it's not wrong to be like your
[49:01] heavenly Father which is perfect but
[49:02] when you've perverted the character of
[49:03] your heavenly father that's
[49:05] imperfect Satan drew his own conception
[49:09] said he's a good god he's overall nature
[49:12] I'll get the beans and potatoes too much
[49:14] starch too much lectin too many
[49:18] carbs he says and I'll get the flowers
[49:21] and I'll make him a real pretty altar
[49:22] brother said that's a
[49:24] church K's way is religious
[49:28] remember it's Rebellion without
[49:29] consequence Works without
[49:33] heart Spirit without truth worship
[49:35] without truth because then you just all
[49:38] you have to do is just say well you know
[49:41] did did really did Cain do anything
[49:42] wrong don't you think if he's talking to
[49:44] God and he really was wrong he would
[49:45] have said I'm you're right I'm wrong but
[49:47] look he was the
[49:51] victim Genesis
[49:54] 4:16 Cain went out from the presence of
[49:56] the Lord dwelt in the Land of Nod on the
[49:58] East of
[49:59] Eden on the East of Eden indicates a
[50:02] religious way a religious move brother B
[50:05] said see how religious it was the east
[50:08] side it's just like lot this was the way
[50:11] of Cain is inherently
[50:14] religious the way of Cain is inherently
[50:17] the lust of the eye not in a way to
[50:20] where the devil I had some statements
[50:22] here I don't know if I have them in here
[50:23] maybe I do I just forgot that I have a
[50:24] lot more things to read
[50:26] but he talks about
[50:28] seeing uh prostitutes in France I think
[50:32] it was he said if you thought you were
[50:34] going to see something vulgar and filthy
[50:36] in terms of something ugly and
[50:37] downtrodden and Drug addled or something
[50:40] he's like that's not the way it happened
[50:43] Satan tries to present it in a very very
[50:45] beautiful
[50:47] way and just once more Lord again
[50:49] continuing on to Life Tabernacle he says
[50:51] the church could only knew that there
[50:53] was a
[50:54] possibility but the people don't seem to
[50:56] to catch the vision yet they don't seem
[50:58] to catch it there's a little possibility
[51:00] it doesn't come through you can shout a
[51:02] little more Pat your hands a little more
[51:04] or dance a little more that isn't it no
[51:08] it's back to the word there is a
[51:10] possibility of coming back and getting
[51:12] the word on the inside again you
[51:14] bypassed it there notice they sit tight
[51:17] oh sure they clap their hands yes sir
[51:19] but you see that's all SS without any
[51:21] anchor I've seen the heathens clap their
[51:23] hands and do dance speak in tongues and
[51:25] do all those things an interpret it but
[51:27] they were African heathens sure I've
[51:29] seen them lay a pencil down and watch a
[51:30] witch doctor stood there and made the
[51:32] pencil stand up run up and down in place
[51:34] up there and come back and play like and
[51:36] shave a hair cut two bits draw it out on
[51:38] an unknown tongue and wrote it out and
[51:39] one of them stood there interpreting
[51:41] it you can't rely on that many of them
[51:45] speak in tongues and they deny the very
[51:47] principles of Jesus Christ I took my
[51:49] Bible laid it right out to a man him
[51:52] standing there speaking in tongue says
[51:54] brother this is exactly I don't even
[51:56] want see it glory to God I know Jesus
[51:58] said I don't care about the rest
[51:59] Hallelujah glory to God like
[52:02] that why a man that would turn his back
[52:04] upon truth and actually put on a shind
[52:06] dig like that to keep from seeing the
[52:08] truth that's hypocrisy in the heights of
[52:12] it listen using that against the word
[52:17] well I don't I don't care what the
[52:19] brother said I don't care what Jesus
[52:20] said I don't care about the glory to God
[52:22] hallelujah and he says put on a
[52:23] dick to to reject the word
[52:26] that's the heights of hypocrisy just
[52:28] because he would have to give up his
[52:29] Fellowship card if he accepted what was
[52:32] truth in other words when you when you
[52:33] get in the premium group right to stand
[52:36] for the full word of God might get you
[52:37] kicked out he said that's worse than
[52:41] Samson why is it worse than
[52:44] Samson those locks will never grow
[52:46] back she'll keep his head
[52:49] shaved doing
[52:51] tricks remember brother B said That's
[52:53] what Satan had been or Samson had been
[52:55] reduced to
[52:57] diluted doing tricks Showmanship
[53:02] entertainment he says the thing of it is
[53:04] that people have gotten so wound up into
[53:06] the world and the world and them till
[53:08] they have just just enough religion to
[53:10] make them miserable not enough to really
[53:12] turn loose to God and give your whole
[53:14] heart into him but enough yeah I go to
[53:17] church certainly I enjoy good singing
[53:19] and clapping hands yeah I love that are
[53:21] you listening I'm almost done almost
[53:25] almost
[53:27] done but when it comes right down to
[53:29] putting what you say you believe into
[53:32] practice and willing to confess the
[53:34] wrong they don't do it it just isn't
[53:36] there they don't have it well that's
[53:39] real conviction that's what we need
[53:41] we've left that a long time ago and
[53:44] swapped it what have we what have we
[53:46] left and swapped prayer and con con
[53:49] confession and conviction we've swapped
[53:51] it for emotion shaking jerking or
[53:54] jumping up and down
[53:56] it's true today because we've created an
[53:59] environment where people who have no
[54:01] respect for headship no desire for
[54:04] Holiness and unsanctified lives can Pat
[54:08] themselves on the back and feel good
[54:10] because they've got emotional shook jerk
[54:12] or jumped up and
[54:14] down and what have they swapped prayer
[54:16] confession
[54:17] conviction that's the reason it's
[54:19] holding tight they're holding tight
[54:21] because there's nothing there to hold
[54:22] them until you come upon the basis of
[54:25] God's word god sorrow ready to repent
[54:27] make everything right and do what's
[54:29] right ready to live like right I don't
[54:32] care what the people say or anything
[54:33] else you live for Jesus Christ and what
[54:35] he said then you take a church like that
[54:37] coming back there is a possibility of it
[54:39] coming but they're not willing to do
[54:43] iten sister Rebecca if you could come to
[54:45] the Piano Brothers to your instruments I
[54:48] want to close with this statement as we
[54:49] before we
[54:51] pray put yourself in Samson's shoes
[55:02] I don't know where balum will be in the
[55:05] final
[55:06] analysis he was a prophet who became a
[55:08] soothsayer and ultimately he rejects God
[55:13] Cain doesn't have very good
[55:16] standing
[55:18] Kora doesn't as we looked at money balum
[55:23] is type of that
[55:27] Samson tempted with women Saul the pride
[55:32] of life we know in Saul as we're going
[55:33] to get into that maybe Wednesday and
[55:36] Sunday there's a the prophet Saul seeks
[55:41] The Witch of indor that said maybe a lot
[55:42] about Saul but he has this sees Samuel
[55:46] and Samuel says you'll be with me and so
[55:48] there there is a Salvation for Saul so
[55:52] just because you're there's a Temptation
[55:53] in these things doesn't mean you're
[55:54] eternally lost
[55:57] and that's the beauty of I could say of
[55:59] Samson's testimony we've read a lot over
[56:03] the last few services on
[56:05] Samson but where he ends up in the end
[56:09] he kills more in
[56:11] death than he did in life and there was
[56:15] Redemption that's why brother says just
[56:16] once more he tells Life Tabernacle run
[56:19] for your life run for your
[56:21] life so there's a lesson in Samson that
[56:24] you've got to rec recogniz the
[56:28] possibility and be willing to follow no
[56:30] matter what it takes brother Brown makes
[56:33] this statement I just want to end on
[56:34] this and go to prayer he says You must
[56:36] die with your enemy you must die to the
[56:39] enemy that's got you in this condition L
[56:42] the flesh less the eyes and the pride of
[56:44] life money women or popularity whatever
[56:46] it might be you must die with it Samson
[56:49] was willing to pay the price to get the
[56:52] power of God back on him
[56:54] again he saw what he was raised up to do
[56:58] not be a
[57:00] showman listen that's that's why these
[57:02] if there's any rebuke at all uh for any
[57:04] of us whether it be me as a pastor with
[57:06] my emphasis well he seems to be too
[57:08] intellectual or he seems to be anti-
[57:10] this or or he seems to be Pro this and
[57:12] anti whatever it might be here's your
[57:14] opportunity to recognize what you're
[57:16] called to do what you're called to be
[57:18] not a showman not emotional or
[57:20] intellectual but a servant to have
[57:23] himself so that the power of God could
[57:25] flow through him and there's our
[57:28] Redemption is when we could just say you
[57:30] know what I need to die to the enemy
[57:32] that's got me in this condition my the
[57:34] worst enemy the the big three the money
[57:36] women popularity Lusty eye lust of the
[57:38] flesh The Pride life I don't want them
[57:40] to entice me I don't want them to delude
[57:41] me I don't want them to seduce me I
[57:43] don't want to be bound I certainly don't
[57:45] want to be blind oh God I die to those
[57:47] things I don't want to be in it for
[57:49] show but I want to be in it f show I
[57:53] want to be in it all the
[57:54] way I want to be
[57:56] I want to be fully committed to the word
[57:58] of
[57:59] God a servant so this power can flow
[58:03] through
[58:05] me let us not be those that through our
[58:09] own
[58:10] complexes as I've studied this I
[58:12] realized especially with the example of
[58:14] Saul he was just a prisoner to his own
[58:17] perception of himself and how Pride
[58:19] worked in him in such a subtle way what
[58:22] we can find is through our complexes we
[58:24] build up all these complexes and all
[58:25] you're doing is you're boxing yourself
[58:26] in all you've done is you forced
[58:29] yourself into some image or some way or
[58:31] something that uh uh you've got to do
[58:33] and you're going to always be guilty
[58:35] because you're going to condemn yourself
[58:37] and you're going to measure Yourself by
[58:38] other people and other things and you're
[58:40] never going to quite match up to it so
[58:42] break the chains that binds you whether
[58:44] it be of the flesh or the eyes or the
[58:46] pride of life break the chains that bind
[58:48] you whether it be money or popularity or
[58:50] women let those chains dissolve in the
[58:52] power of God's word and just be who he
[58:54] called you to be
[58:56] it's a shame that you'd miss out on so
[58:58] much as an individual because you're
[59:00] trying to fit some other image for your
[59:02] life instead of the one that God has for
[59:04] you be what God called you to
[59:06] be the same would go for a family trying
[59:09] to keep up with the Joneses trying to
[59:10] match this and match that could you
[59:13] imagine telling somebody that you ate at
[59:15] some taco joint and just to keep up with
[59:16] you they go twice in one day what kind
[59:19] of life is
[59:20] that I'm just kidding brother Michael I
[59:22] know you did that
[59:26] but this a this this I kind of feel bad
[59:29] now he's going to think man is this his
[59:30] opportunity to finally get
[59:32] me you got to have someone you take it
[59:34] out on otherwise you hurt the
[59:37] innocent but there's so many things we
[59:39] could do as a family to drag people
[59:41] around and and try to make things work
[59:43] and fit in the best thing you could do
[59:46] is follow God for your life for your
[59:47] family do what's right in in your heart
[59:49] as you sincerely follow the lord and I
[59:51] trust that if you're sincere God will
[59:53] show up just like he has in times past
[59:55] and say that wasn't good but if you do
[59:57] well I'll bless it and you won't go in
[1:00:00] the way of Kane you say you corrected me
[1:00:02] thank you and I trust that we can always
[1:00:05] have that heart as spiritual Believers
[1:00:06] as members of this church and as we
[1:00:08] Embrace those who are part of what we
[1:00:10] say the message Community or the
[1:00:11] Christian Community around us that we
[1:00:13] always have the right heart not in the
[1:00:14] way of Cain not in bringing railing
[1:00:16] accusations but we keep our heart right
[1:00:18] amen and we don't do it for show cuz
[1:00:21] there are people that need God more than
[1:00:23] ever thirsty for it hungry for it and
[1:00:26] that's the reason why God put us here
[1:00:28] you say why are we still here cuz
[1:00:29] there's somebody out there that needs
[1:00:31] this that's part of it there's somebody
[1:00:33] in in whether it be in Prescot whether
[1:00:35] it be in Tucson or Maricopa County
[1:00:37] there's somebody that needs
[1:00:40] Christ and if all you present is the big
[1:00:43] three they've had all of that they
[1:00:46] want and that's not what they're
[1:00:49] after amen let's Stand Together
