[0:00] continuing on the series on the house of
[0:02] the Lord and wanting to just go further
[0:05] in this subject as we mentioned on
[0:07] Sunday maybe take it piece by piece what
[0:09] the house of the Lord means I've already
[0:10] looked at it in two respects it's a
[0:12] tabernacle or a dwelling place it's
[0:14] referred to as a tent um the house of
[0:16] the Lord is the Tabernacle of the Lord
[0:19] that Tabernacle in the wilderness was a
[0:20] Dwelling Place of God's presence a place
[0:22] that he promised to meet meet them in
[0:25] between those Cher boms above the mercy
[0:27] seat and then it became a temple when
[0:29] Solomon built the Temple that Tabernacle
[0:31] that was the house of the Lord now the
[0:33] temple this physical structure this one
[0:35] with a permanent foundation is called
[0:37] the house of the Lord and to be called
[0:40] the temple it speaks of a consecrated
[0:42] place a place of worship and offering
[0:45] and just I think you probably already
[0:47] know this already well before we even
[0:48] started the series but to use the house
[0:51] of the Lord as a subject it's just rich
[0:52] in meaning so many different types and
[0:55] examples to us and we've even mentioned
[0:57] how that the Lord desires to tell the
[0:59] story of Redemption and see our own
[1:01] selves reflected in the house of the
[1:03] Lord and I believe that there's uh
[1:05] personal things that we can gather from
[1:07] this that are very very practical and so
[1:10] before I continue and go further tonight
[1:12] my title is going to be the Gates of
[1:14] Heaven and going to be drawing it from
[1:17] here in Genesis chapter 28 the Gates of
[1:19] Heaven and I'll show you what my
[1:20] original title slide was going to be I
[1:22] was originally going to call it all your
[1:23] gates are belong to us and that was my
[1:25] working title and uh just at the last
[1:28] minute things just shifted around and I
[1:30] realized maybe all of us could really
[1:31] participate in the Gates of Heaven but
[1:33] all your gates are belong to us might
[1:35] not uh belong to God may not quite ring
[1:38] true to to all of us or ring the way
[1:40] that I would want it to but if you could
[1:41] turn to John chapter 14:
[1:44] 23 and and look at the scripture
[1:47] together Jesus is saying if I go I'm
[1:49] going to come again to you I'm going to
[1:50] prepare a place for you in my father's
[1:53] house are many mansions and there's a
[1:55] forward-looking aspect to that where
[1:56] we're going oh one day in eternity in
[1:59] the future there'll be a place where we
[2:00] could sit down forever and it'd be the
[2:02] house of God and in my father's kingdom
[2:05] are many palaces and we know that
[2:06] there's a body waiting for us Eternal in
[2:09] the heavens and all that light is on
[2:11] that but in verse 23 in that same
[2:13] reading Jesus answered and said unto
[2:15] them if a man love me he will keep my
[2:18] words and my father will love him and we
[2:20] will come unto him and make our Abode
[2:24] with him make our mansion with him and
[2:27] so when it says that you're going to be
[2:29] uh a dwelling place there's going to be
[2:30] an abiding or a staying with you and we
[2:33] looked at this on Sunday as this is a
[2:35] home for heaven that we want to go make
[2:37] Heaven our home and one day we want to
[2:39] leave here and we want to live eternally
[2:41] in heaven and we've got a body in heaven
[2:43] and our angel in heaven behold is before
[2:45] the father's face and there's a lot of
[2:47] things that are forward looking but now
[2:49] to say that we'll make our Abode it
[2:51] means there's a mansion here now and you
[2:53] are that home your your heart can be a
[2:56] home for heaven and we've looked at
[2:59] three different aspect aspects of the
[3:00] house of the Lord how that in the Old
[3:01] Testament God dwelled in the Tabernacle
[3:03] he dwelt in the temple in the New
[3:05] Testament God dwells in his body the
[3:07] church or the bride and that and that's
[3:10] been our real emphasis and we'll
[3:11] continue to emphasize that part tonight
[3:14] and then in eternity in the future home
[3:15] God is resident in man with man in
[3:19] Christ and the bride and we looked at
[3:21] all these different instances old Old
[3:23] Testament New Testament future home all
[3:26] of them in every instance God makes a
[3:28] home on Earth
[3:30] that God has a place where he dwells God
[3:32] has a place that he wants to be and so
[3:34] tonight as we look at the subject of the
[3:36] Gates of Heaven and it to use the phrase
[3:39] Gates expresses an entr entrance of an
[3:42] access or even an introduction uh to
[3:45] heaven and I want you to think of that
[3:47] way when we talk about we're still
[3:48] talking about the house of the Lord and
[3:49] a home but now the Gates of Heaven is
[3:52] expressing an entrance or an
[3:53] introduction to something now just take
[3:56] your Bibles and turn to where you were
[3:57] just a moment ago in Genesis chapter 28
[4:00] start with verse 16 and I will go
[4:02] through this and read to verse 22 again
[4:05] we've already uh read this and we'll
[4:07] just make reference again how in the
[4:09] night uh Jacob was dreaming and he saw
[4:12] this ladder which was from the earth and
[4:14] reached to heaven and angels ascending
[4:16] and descending from that ladder in this
[4:18] place where he was it says Jacob awake
[4:21] out of his sleep and he said surely the
[4:23] Lord is in this place and I knew it not
[4:26] now he has this sensitivity to believe
[4:28] that when he arrived the Lord was
[4:30] already there that him having laid there
[4:32] and and dreamed there that God was
[4:35] already present with him but now he's
[4:36] been awakened to this and he's alarmed
[4:38] by it and he says I I didn't know it and
[4:40] he was afraid and said how Dreadful is
[4:42] this place now not in a terror that you
[4:44] would run from but it's this awe and
[4:46] this reverence for it he says this is
[4:48] none other but the house of God and this
[4:51] is the Gate of Heaven that's quite a
[4:54] statement just imagine going to sleep in
[4:56] the wilderness and putting together some
[4:57] stones to make a bed and you fall asleep
[4:59] and you have a dream and you wake up and
[5:01] you feel as if you had fallen asleep
[5:03] unknowingly in the house of God somehow
[5:06] you found yourself at the foot of a
[5:07] ladder to Heaven he says this is the
[5:09] very House of God and this is the Gate
[5:11] of Heaven these are very strong words
[5:13] for Jacob to utter and Jacob rose up
[5:16] early in the morning and took the stone
[5:17] that he had put for his pillows and set
[5:19] it up for a pillar and poured oil upon
[5:22] the top of it and he called the name of
[5:24] that place bethl but the name of that
[5:25] city was called lus at the first I
[5:27] believe that's almond tree and Jacob
[5:29] vowed a vow saying if God will be with
[5:32] me and will keep me in this way that I
[5:34] go and will give me bread to eat and
[5:36] reignment to put on so that I come again
[5:39] to my father's house in peace then shall
[5:42] the Lord be my God and this Stone which
[5:45] I have set for a pillar shall be God's
[5:48] house so he erects something this this
[5:50] this stone that he laid upon now he sets
[5:52] it upright and he he says this shall be
[5:55] God's house and of all that thou shalt
[5:58] give me I will surely give the tenth
[6:00] unto thee so here's where the these
[6:01] tithes are born where he's going to give
[6:03] this tenth and are not necessar born but
[6:06] here's this expression of this tithing
[6:08] to God and he says I'm going to set this
[6:10] pillar up and it's going to be God's
[6:13] house when he calls it the house of God
[6:15] it's a place that he's going to identify
[6:17] with God but not a stopping point it's a
[6:20] place where God dwelt when he wakes up
[6:22] he says surely the Lord is here this is
[6:24] the place where God is pleased to be he
[6:26] says I I'm going to call this God's
[6:28] house a place where God dwells the word
[6:30] he's using is going to imply a dwelling
[6:32] place and then he says and this is the
[6:35] Gate of Heaven now when he says the Gate
[6:38] of
[6:39] Heaven I hope you can get this image in
[6:41] your mind right now and I'll just get to
[6:42] it and just fix it it was a meeting
[6:44] place between the natural and the
[6:46] supernatural he's a natural man wanting
[6:48] to get a good night's rest because the
[6:49] sun is down and it's late at night and
[6:51] he goes to bed and in his dream in his
[6:52] sleep he dreams of this latter reaching
[6:54] to heaven and angels coming from Heaven
[6:56] to Earth God above it God speaking God
[6:59] de de claring things to him so when he
[7:00] called it the Gate of Heaven he said
[7:03] this is where Heaven comes to Earth this
[7:05] is a meeting place this is a way that
[7:08] angels can come from Heaven Down to
[7:10] Earth this is the place where God can
[7:11] speak from Heaven to Earth this is a a a
[7:14] super a place where the supernatural
[7:17] communes and makes itself known to the
[7:19] Natural this is a a a a meeting place
[7:22] Between Heaven and Earth and the word
[7:25] that's used there for gate it refers to
[7:27] an entrance it's also can be referred to
[7:29] a meeting place a place of authority a
[7:32] place of judging so when he says gate it
[7:34] carries with it a a lot of meaning in
[7:36] Psalms chapter 24:7 says lift your lift
[7:39] up your heads oh ye gates and be ye
[7:42] lifted up ye Everlasting doors and the
[7:44] king of glory shall come in so to speak
[7:47] of a gate it's an entrance and Gates
[7:50] often uh reflect the glory of a city and
[7:53] there's a reason why they had gates in
[7:54] those days and you'd find it in a
[7:56] village you find it in a town you find
[7:57] it in a city that they would use build
[7:58] walls they build Gates and it had a
[8:00] purpose and it had a design even when
[8:03] God is describing the New Jerusalem one
[8:05] of the last descriptions it has of it is
[8:06] the 12 gates to that City all the doors
[8:09] are made of one Pearl and so it speaks
[8:11] of the glory and the Grandeur of a city
[8:14] uh how the how ornate they are how big
[8:16] they are how many it would have would
[8:17] speak to just the vastness of the city
[8:19] and the beauty of the city and so this
[8:21] the gate reflects a point of entrance
[8:24] into something and speaks of the glory
[8:26] of something in Proverbs 31:
[8:29] 23 speaking of this virtuous woman it
[8:32] says her husband is known in the gates
[8:34] when he sth among the Elders of the land
[8:37] when this is an illusion to the fact
[8:39] that there are Elders that would sit
[8:41] together and dispense judgment in the
[8:43] gate and the Bible speaks of it in
[8:44] different places that when the father
[8:46] stands there his sons will stand with
[8:48] him in the gate as a witness as a
[8:49] Defender and it's a place of it's the to
[8:53] say that the husband sits there in the
[8:54] gate it's a place rightful place of
[8:56] honor and respect and he sits there with
[8:59] a place of power and judgment with the
[9:01] other Elders to discern a matter to
[9:03] judge a matter so the gates is a place
[9:05] of honor it's a place of power in
[9:08] judgment says in Proverbs chap 22:22 Rob
[9:11] not the poor because he is poor neither
[9:13] oppress The Afflicted in the gate
[9:16] because in the gate it's a judgment
[9:18] scene Justice is dispensed at the gate
[9:20] there's correction uh that goes forth in
[9:23] the gate and and this is the image of a
[9:26] gate it's a place of grandeur and Glory
[9:28] it's a place of entrance it's a place of
[9:29] honor and respect it's where Justice
[9:31] Goes Forth and righteousness Goes Forth
[9:34] when you possess the gates of a city you
[9:36] possess the city it's what the Bible
[9:38] says over you shall possess the gates of
[9:40] your enemy in different places it speaks
[9:42] of when you go to possess their Gates
[9:44] and possess the gates of the city if you
[9:45] possess the gates you possess the city
[9:48] you determined what would come in and
[9:49] what would go out and so it carries with
[9:51] it Such Great Expressions Zechariah 8:16
[9:56] these are the things that you shall do
[9:58] speak ye every man the truth to his
[10:00] neighbor execute the Judgment of Truth
[10:03] and peace in your Gates so the gates was
[10:06] a place where Justice is served a place
[10:08] where Justice is to go forth but it's
[10:09] the place where you to find truth place
[10:12] where you find righteousness this is
[10:13] what the gates mean when he says these
[10:15] are the Gates of Heaven uh don't just
[10:17] simply look at as maybe a doorway but
[10:19] there's something that Jacob recognizes
[10:21] in this this the symbolism what it typed
[10:24] and what it showed this place of
[10:25] authority this place of righteousness
[10:27] this place of judgment this rightful
[10:29] place this place of
[10:30] Correction it says in Matthew 16:1 18
[10:34] Peter has this Revelation and he says
[10:36] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[10:38] Living God and Jesus says I say unto
[10:40] thee that thou art Peter and Upon This
[10:42] Rock I will build my church and the
[10:45] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[10:48] it expression of Satan's kingdom and his
[10:52] his authority and his attitude and his
[10:54] judgments and uh the things that he
[10:56] would honor the Gates of Hell shall not
[10:58] Prevail against the Revelation but Peter
[11:01] with the Revelation the Gates of Hell
[11:02] could not Prevail against Peter and and
[11:05] with the Revelation the Gates of Hell
[11:06] cannot Prevail against the church so it
[11:08] cannot Prevail against the Revelation
[11:10] nor the church that's built upon that
[11:12] Revelation and the individuals who make
[11:14] up that church that's built upon that
[11:16] Revelation and it's the gates of hell it
[11:18] represents the power and authority the
[11:20] Grandeur all the all the conspiracies
[11:23] and all the activities and all the
[11:24] tricks and everything that the devil
[11:26] would do that's what the gates of hell
[11:28] are
[11:30] so when he looks at this he says this is
[11:32] the Gate of Heaven the gate has a an
[11:36] expression it has a life behind it it
[11:38] has a power behind it it means something
[11:40] say this is the Gate of Heaven but he
[11:42] calls it bethl this place he calls bethl
[11:45] which is the house of God what it
[11:47] translates to the house of God from Beth
[11:49] which is house and L which is God this
[11:52] was a consecrated place it was a sacred
[11:55] meeting place this is the reason why
[11:57] when Jacob wakes up he says surely God
[11:59] has been in this place a and because God
[12:02] was there he wants to consecrate it he
[12:03] wants to dedicate it he wants to
[12:05] acknowledge that this is this is a place
[12:07] special where God has revealed something
[12:09] very great to me notice the promise
[12:11] given to Jacob and how it echoes what he
[12:13] said to Abraham what he said echoed to
[12:15] Isaac it's now being rehearsed to him so
[12:17] this is the very uh precious place for
[12:20] him to lift up this
[12:21] Stone and it says that he took the stone
[12:24] that he used for a pillow and he he sets
[12:27] it up for a pillar
[12:29] maybe it was laying flat but now he
[12:31] wants it to be standing up in a way that
[12:32] you would look at says man has Man Has
[12:34] Lifted this up he's it's not just a
[12:36] stone Lan on the ground it's been
[12:37] erected by man and then he anoints it
[12:40] with oil and by anointing it with oil
[12:42] it's this act of dedicating the place
[12:45] says this is the house of God it ought
[12:47] to be Anointed with oil ought to be
[12:49] consecrated and dedicated and he was
[12:51] doing it as a sign and and these things
[12:54] as I've been studying on them even since
[12:55] last year this these very elements that
[12:57] begin to this this picture begin to
[12:59] crystallize before me as I was seeing
[13:02] what Jacob would do here in Genesis
[13:03] chapter 28 and here there's a picture of
[13:06] the house of the Lord and all these
[13:07] different applications there's things
[13:09] that you could start to see when he's
[13:11] there in this moment he places this
[13:13] pillar up and he pours this this oil
[13:15] upon this pillar and he's it's as if
[13:17] it's a sign of this rock being
[13:19] anointed just as Jesus says Upon This
[13:22] Rock I'll build my church and we know
[13:25] that that rock is a revelation and now
[13:27] as the stone is being lift it up he
[13:29] pours oil on it this act of consecrating
[13:32] and it gives so many different
[13:33] applications to God's house to
[13:36] us and when he says this is the house of
[13:39] God the word that he uses for house this
[13:42] is just language so what I'm sharing to
[13:44] you here is just language we wouldn't
[13:46] just build this principle on this alone
[13:49] but the word that's used for house in
[13:51] the Old Testament refers to the human
[13:52] body or can ref refer to a Dwelling
[13:55] Place such as a home or a house that
[13:57] contains the family or it can refer to a
[14:00] temple this is the house of God and it
[14:03] could be uh this word house could be
[14:05] used of a person's body the individual
[14:07] or the house that they live in or the
[14:08] temple that they would Worship in and so
[14:11] this is kind of the picture that I've
[14:12] been chasing now even through some
[14:14] series we were on last year I just feel
[14:16] like I'm right at the cusp of getting
[14:17] into some things that have been very
[14:18] burdensome upon my heart but I want you
[14:20] to consider your body your house your
[14:23] residence where you live and your church
[14:26] as the Gates of
[14:27] Heaven I want you to first look at
[14:30] yourself as in your body now you say
[14:32] well is the body the gate to heaven well
[14:34] we know the soul we emphasize that over
[14:35] and over is the soul but now I want you
[14:37] to look at your person and who you are
[14:39] you're a three room house and you are a
[14:41] gate to heaven and as the word bethl
[14:45] uses the word house it can also relate
[14:46] to a home that you live in so where you
[14:48] live whether it be an apartment whether
[14:50] it be a room in in some other house
[14:52] whatever it might be or a home that you
[14:54] rent or a home that you own regardless
[14:56] of where you live or you live in an
[14:57] office or live in your car are the place
[14:59] where you dwell and you spend your time
[15:01] we look at that as a place where my
[15:03] possessions are a place where my heart
[15:04] is we call that also look at that as a
[15:07] Gate of Heaven and then also your church
[15:10] where you go to church you should think
[15:11] of your church in some in as the house
[15:14] of the Lord amen you should look at your
[15:16] church the church you go to as a place I
[15:18] want you to think of it this way as a
[15:19] Gate of Heaven these three things your
[15:22] body your house and your church as the
[15:24] Gates of Heaven in 1 Corinthians chapter
[15:27] 6:9
[15:29] this is just the review uh from other
[15:31] services but now wanting to use these
[15:33] tonight says in 1 Corinthians chapter
[15:36] 6:9 know ye not that your body is the
[15:39] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[15:42] which you have of God and ye are not
[15:44] your own we have been baptized with the
[15:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost uh that
[15:49] anointing oil as it was has been poured
[15:51] out upon us and so now we are as a a
[15:54] building we have been Anointed with oil
[15:56] we've been consecrated we've been
[15:57] dedicated and he says says that we are
[15:59] the Temple of the Holy Ghost that when
[16:01] that Soul has been sealed through the
[16:03] new birth it God dwells there and Paul
[16:05] says your body is the house of the Lord
[16:09] your body is the Temple of the Holy
[16:11] Ghost brother Brandon when he's
[16:13] preaching the statue of a perfect man if
[16:14] you go and read those scriptures and
[16:16] listen to that sermon he makes a
[16:18] statement similar to this in several
[16:19] places but this was this title building
[16:21] the living Tabernacle of the Living God
[16:24] Dwelling Place the perfect man the
[16:26] living Tabernacle of the Living God
[16:28] where he
[16:29] dwells building the living Tabernacle of
[16:32] the living God's Dwelling Place the
[16:35] perfect man the living Tabernacle of the
[16:37] Living God where he dwells and he just
[16:40] doesn't relate it to Christ but he says
[16:42] this is the building that God is doing
[16:43] in us that we want to be a Dwelling
[16:46] Place how to be a Dwelling Place of his
[16:48] Spirit how to be a Powerhouse for God
[16:50] and all those different things that's
[16:51] expressed in them and so as we read
[16:53] Sunday in 1 Peter chapter 2:5 ye also as
[16:57] Lively Stones live living stones are
[16:59] built up a spiritual house and a holy
[17:02] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[17:04] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[17:07] Christ you are an anointed Stone uh oil
[17:10] has been poured out upon you that oil of
[17:12] the Holy Ghost sealed into your heart
[17:13] your body your life has been Anointed
[17:16] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[17:18] you are a living Stone you are a
[17:21] spiritual house so as Jacob said oh this
[17:23] is none other than the house of God and
[17:25] this is the Gate of Heaven you as in
[17:28] that house of God you become a portal
[17:31] you become a Gate of
[17:33] Heaven brother B saiding you are God's
[17:36] house living walking around manifesting
[17:39] the Living God for he dwells not in
[17:41] temples made with hands but a body hast
[17:43] thou prepared me you are God's letter a
[17:46] written epistle God is in you
[17:48] manifesting himself through that's what
[17:51] we are this these are the very things
[17:53] that you are to be that's the ultimate
[17:56] and in the sermon why Christ speak if
[17:58] you could could just focus on this for a
[18:00] moment here he says but there's only one
[18:03] real church and you don't join
[18:05] it right too bad there's only one real
[18:08] church and you don't join it you're born
[18:10] into it by one Spirit you're baptized
[18:13] into the body of Christ so he's saying
[18:15] there's only one real church and if
[18:17] you're born in it the Living God works
[18:20] himself through you in making himself
[18:22] known so now you now God if once you're
[18:26] born into that church God works through
[18:28] He makes himself known through you now
[18:31] if you'll think about that there is one
[18:33] true church that true church is his body
[18:35] that true church is the bride and we
[18:37] have this thought well then that's where
[18:39] God is he's in his church he's in his
[18:41] people and He makes himself known
[18:43] through the church and I know
[18:44] immediately in our minds we start
[18:45] thinking of an entity where God's going
[18:48] to make himself known maybe a church off
[18:50] of some road or or some building
[18:52] somewhere some special meeting like
[18:54] through that edifice and through that
[18:55] structure and through that building and
[18:57] it's local government govern and its
[18:58] Pastor the special speaker that's where
[19:00] God makes himself known but he has no
[19:02] means of making himself known through
[19:03] the church except through you and your
[19:05] life and how you live and what you say
[19:06] and what you lift up says that's where
[19:09] God dwells in his church God goes to
[19:13] church every
[19:14] day just lives in
[19:17] church am he lives in
[19:20] you God goes to church every day just
[19:23] lives in church he lives in you you are
[19:26] his church you are are his church you
[19:29] are the Tabernacle that God dwells in so
[19:32] God goes to church every day least we
[19:34] could do is couple times a week right he
[19:37] goes to church every day he dwells in
[19:39] church he just lives in church and he's
[19:41] saying that's you so in my in my the way
[19:45] I see this it's that's the ultimate that
[19:48] God that Christ would live in you and
[19:49] since it's certainly not practical us
[19:51] not being God for us to live every be
[19:53] here every day and just live in church
[19:55] all the time and go to church every day
[19:57] we do this even showing what God does in
[20:00] us he Tabernacles in us so going to
[20:02] church is just a reflection of what
[20:03] God's done for
[20:05] me and maybe that's why people don't go
[20:08] to
[20:08] church says you are his church you are
[20:11] the Tabernacle that God dwells in you
[20:14] are the Church of the Living God
[20:16] yourself then he kind of tightens this
[20:18] down quite a bit if you if the Living
[20:20] God lives in his living being then your
[20:22] action is of God if it isn't then God
[20:24] isn't in there it challenges us to be
[20:27] then if I'm his church
[20:28] I then I want to reflect him well I know
[20:32] that you know we've all been in the
[20:33] message long enough to hear it whether
[20:34] it be just a rumor or whether it be from
[20:36] our neighbor in the apartment next door
[20:38] how that many times some Churches want
[20:39] you to do things because they're really
[20:41] at the end of the day concerned about
[20:43] their
[20:43] image they whether they tell you just to
[20:46] come as you are and you can wear shorts
[20:47] and flip-flops do whatever you want they
[20:49] want to appear cool and hip to everyone
[20:50] else and they're asking you to do things
[20:52] not to please the Lord but to be
[20:54] instagrammable or they tell you to do
[20:56] certain things because people are
[20:57] watching they don't want to be perceived
[20:58] a certain way and so there's this idea
[21:00] well the pretense of well we don't want
[21:02] to make the church look bad but I tell
[21:03] you there's something better than that
[21:05] is to have a real genuine experience of
[21:07] the new birth and know that my life what
[21:09] I say what I do how I dress and how I
[21:11] live is somehow reflecting upon God and
[21:14] I don't want to be a wrong reflection of
[21:16] who he is if we concerned ourselves with
[21:19] that we wouldn't have to worry about the
[21:20] reputation of a
[21:22] church because it's God in there he says
[21:25] he wouldn't make you act like that when
[21:27] he says in the word his blueprint don't
[21:29] do it there's our challenge the word
[21:31] says something we do it if it says not
[21:32] to do something we don't do it you go do
[21:34] it he says see that's wrong when you
[21:35] deny it then that shows the life isn't
[21:37] even in you I acknowledge it that kind
[21:39] of pulls it down tight but it's
[21:41] challenging to us to recognize that the
[21:43] Life of Christ inside of me lives The
[21:45] Life of Christ and it would be my own
[21:47] human nature that would be manifesting
[21:48] anything different and if you can't
[21:50] express his life if you can't express
[21:52] his nature and character then one ought
[21:54] to examine themselves so our body is the
[21:57] Bible showing
[21:59] it is a temple of the
[22:01] Lord and and and I know there's so much
[22:03] we can keep talking about that so many
[22:05] scriptures I'm repeating some of the
[22:06] same ones just so that we uh maybe don't
[22:09] get caught up in going through even more
[22:11] verses but your body is a temple of the
[22:13] Lord and now I want to take this a step
[22:15] further and say your home should be
[22:18] too and the church ought to be
[22:21] that they ought to be Gates of
[22:23] Heaven and there is a duty as it is as
[22:26] we've already read that your body is the
[22:27] temple of the Lord and he's admonishing
[22:29] them even in that very chapter that you
[22:31] ought not to defile the Temple of the
[22:32] lord your body is a temple don't defile
[22:34] it there's a duty for us to consecrate
[22:37] and to set aside our home or our house
[22:40] as a home and also the church different
[22:44] rules regarding uh different things that
[22:45] are taught in the message of the hour
[22:47] different scriptures that speak to how
[22:48] the home ought to be operated and it's
[22:50] telling us that yeah you are a temple of
[22:52] the Holy Ghost but now also you live in
[22:54] that house and you live in a place this
[22:55] is where you reside you lay down your
[22:57] head this is a place that you're
[22:58] identified with this is the place where
[23:00] you're raising your children and where
[23:02] you go to church these are places that
[23:03] they too like you ought to be set aside
[23:07] we have things that rules and
[23:08] governments and and things in the word
[23:10] of God and how to keep our home and even
[23:12] how to keep the church there's things
[23:14] that we don't do in the sanctuary
[23:15] there's things that we try to do in
[23:16] preparation for service and it's all
[23:18] because we recognize a sacredness of
[23:20] these
[23:21] things 1 Timothy
[23:24] 3:5 Paul in these parenthetical phrase
[23:27] as it is in our translation for if a man
[23:29] know not how to rule his own house how
[23:32] shall he take care of the Church of God
[23:35] well Paul is doing and speaking about
[23:37] the qualifications to to rule the Church
[23:39] of God and he's talking about the local
[23:41] church he kind of draws this parallel
[23:43] and this connection between the home
[23:44] life and Church Life and he doesn't
[23:47] Begin by saying hey if the guy's a
[23:48] really good pastor then he'll Ru rule
[23:50] his home well he said no if the guy if
[23:52] the guy can rule his home then he'll
[23:54] know how to rule the house of God
[23:56] because there's a certain fac that you
[23:58] can put on at church but when it really
[24:00] gets real it's how a man lives at home
[24:02] that really speaks to his qualifications
[24:04] in his own family in his own marriage
[24:06] speaks to his qualification for caring
[24:08] for the Church of God so he saying your
[24:10] home life and the way things are at home
[24:12] if he can rule his own house then he is
[24:14] able to take care of the Church of God
[24:18] Amen and that asks the question if he's
[24:20] unable to rule his own house if he
[24:22] doesn't know how to rule his own house
[24:24] it's very clear that he cannot take care
[24:25] of the Church of God that's right
[24:28] and therefore we must rule not only our
[24:30] bodies but also our
[24:32] homes and we need to do so if we want
[24:34] the church to be right it's not our
[24:37] responsibility and I'm not trying to
[24:39] Sherk responsibility today and say well
[24:40] it's not on me guys it's on you but it's
[24:42] not the responsibility of the deacons
[24:44] and the pastor to get everything perfect
[24:45] here so that you guys can escape
[24:47] imperfection and come to a perfect
[24:48] church and feel like all right we're
[24:50] doing our part in a really good place
[24:51] but rather the strength of this church
[24:53] relies upon the individuals who gather
[24:55] inside of it it relies upon the heads of
[24:58] homes it relies upon even the young men
[25:00] who are single and living lives single
[25:02] they don't have accountability where
[25:03] they live and how they conduct
[25:04] themselves and the places they go and
[25:06] the things they feed on there's a lot of
[25:07] ways there's finger pointing and
[25:09] everything he can point right back at
[25:10] you there's a lot of ways that we do
[25:12] things and we say things and we explore
[25:14] things that it's incumbent upon us from
[25:16] the top down all of us that the way what
[25:18] we think about the things we live on the
[25:20] things that we pursue it's the things
[25:22] that take place outside of the church
[25:24] that are going to determine the strength
[25:25] of the
[25:26] church
[25:30] because our heart is a home for
[25:31] heaven and therefore if our heart is a
[25:34] home for heaven then I would argue and
[25:36] that is this is that what I'm positing
[25:38] tonight is that our house then must be a
[25:42] home for us if I'm a spiritual
[25:45] being if I'm a if I'm one that has is
[25:48] bearing the presence of God in my life
[25:50] and I have I have the Holy Ghost and I
[25:52] have a spiritual consciousness and
[25:54] brother Braham said you are the Church
[25:55] of the Living God you are God's Dwelling
[25:57] Place you are the Temple of the Lord
[25:59] then as a as a temple I would want to
[26:02] have an atmosphere that I could live in
[26:04] I I would want to have a home that has
[26:06] the token applied to it I would want to
[26:08] have a certain structure and a certain
[26:09] emphasis and I'd want it to be a certain
[26:11] way to where it's a refuge I believe
[26:13] when we were preaching in the series our
[26:15] family tree how that we would come to a
[26:17] sanctuary at church and we enjoy our
[26:18] fellowship and this music and the
[26:20] presence of God and the things that we
[26:22] get from one another but we don't want
[26:23] to have this kind of dread where we
[26:25] leave this Sanctuary to go home uh uh uh
[26:27] to hell hole we want to go from one
[26:29] Sanctuary to the next and that's how
[26:31] homes ought to be structured and that we
[26:33] would want our house and our living
[26:35] quarters and where we live and where we
[26:36] stay that there'd be some sacredness to
[26:39] it not that it would become like church
[26:41] where you tell Siri to turn on the
[26:44] pre-service music on your way home and
[26:46] then by the time you get home it's been
[26:47] playing for a while and you have to get
[26:48] real legalistic about it but there's
[26:50] just a Consciousness that you know what
[26:52] this is a Dwelling Place th this is
[26:55] where I live this is where my thoughts
[26:57] come together this is where I try to get
[26:58] away from the world and there's a ought
[27:00] to be an attention to detail in those
[27:03] things I I have one of the places that
[27:05] brother bam tells the story printed out
[27:07] in front of me I think just kind of
[27:09] reading it might might lose a little bit
[27:11] of my momentum this evening but I'm sure
[27:14] that most of you remember the story that
[27:16] brother bam tells where he had married a
[27:18] rich
[27:18] couple and then he had also married a
[27:20] poor couple and I was doing some
[27:23] research this week on EV night and the
[27:26] new Al and the places they even this
[27:27] neighborhood that brother BR refers to
[27:29] as Silver Hills uh quite extraordinary
[27:32] pieces of property and an amazing
[27:34] neighborhood eeve night was very
[27:36] successful uh prior to the depression in
[27:39] and Manufacturing uh siding for houses
[27:42] and things like that so he brother br's
[27:43] talking about how he had a daughter that
[27:45] married uh Herman Holtz I believe is his
[27:47] name and it was a friend of brother
[27:48] Brams and and he's telling this he's
[27:50] going to tell a story of that that rich
[27:52] man this young man who married this rich
[27:54] man's daughter and lived in Silver Hills
[27:57] a and big huge beautiful homes and then
[28:00] this other couple that lived in a box
[28:02] carart down by the river not a van but a
[28:04] box
[28:05] carart and and brother brandham says
[28:08] that he he opens this story in some
[28:10] places and happiness doesn't consist in
[28:12] the amount of things that you have in
[28:13] this world and how much of the world's
[28:15] Goods you own but how contented you are
[28:17] with the portion that's given to you
[28:19] that's kind of the thing that he
[28:20] expresses and he's talks about I know
[28:22] this one sharp intelligent man who
[28:24] married a Millionaire's daughter and the
[28:25] door knobs he says we're 14 kid in their
[28:27] home so he said there's this one man who
[28:30] married well and had a really really
[28:31] nice house but then he said I did
[28:33] another ceremony and this boy that he
[28:35] married he said just within a short
[28:36] period of time after that the boy didn't
[28:38] have enough money to get married on and
[28:40] the girl didn't have enough money to pay
[28:42] the preacher and his brother said hey
[28:44] his brother knew him and said my my
[28:45] brother will marry the couple and he
[28:47] said when he come to marry him it was
[28:49] during the time of depression he said
[28:50] his old washed out pair of trousers an
[28:52] old shirt one collar piece of collar
[28:53] buttoned higher than the other he's just
[28:55] describing this disheveled kid probably
[28:57] put on his best didn't know how to
[28:58] button it up like I've never had this
[29:00] many buttons before which one goes where
[29:03] haircut needed he said he needed it bad
[29:05] he said the girl hitch hike from
[29:08] Indianapolis her feet were on the ground
[29:10] he said I felt like buying that poor
[29:11] child that child a pair of
[29:13] shoes and he said well where are you
[29:15] going to live he goes he he said he had
[29:18] an old box car down by the river where
[29:19] they used to do an old dial Iron Works
[29:21] and he said I'm just going to live down
[29:24] there and I said what are you going to
[29:25] do if this job Runs Out you don't have
[29:27] anything she says I love them just the
[29:29] same and he's just thinking wow this is
[29:32] this is quite a
[29:33] couple and but then he says one day he
[29:35] goes to visit his friends in Silver
[29:37] Hills and he goes to visit them the eeve
[29:39] knight's daughter and Herman Holtz and
[29:40] he goes he said had a nice home they had
[29:42] plenty of money he said that they were
[29:45] sitting when he came up he walked on he
[29:47] said one was sitting one corner the
[29:48] other in the other corner and he said
[29:50] they were fussing they were in a big
[29:52] huge fight in this particular reading
[29:54] he's not describing the home in great
[29:56] detail but you could you you can go
[29:57] search civil Hills in in New Albany just
[30:00] a platial home 14 karat whatever uh door
[30:03] knobs in the home H this is this is
[30:05] extraordinary and he he kind of walks up
[30:08] on them and they're fighting they've
[30:09] been fussing the way they were living
[30:10] their lives it brought discontentment in
[30:12] the home and then he shows up and they
[30:14] real quick kind of grabbed their hands
[30:16] together and wanted to put on a front
[30:17] here's the preacher that married me so
[30:19] we want to put on an affront for
[30:20] him and he said are you
[30:23] happy oh yes dear aren't we right aren't
[30:27] we happy completely forgot all about the
[30:29] dance the night before and he goes I
[30:31] knew they were fussing and yet and they
[30:34] went on and you couldn't see it wasn't
[30:36] right the spirit didn't feel right here
[30:38] they are saying the right things but he
[30:40] knows the spirit's not right in that
[30:41] home but he says one day I thought I'd
[30:43] find out what had become of this couple
[30:45] that I married that lived in a box car
[30:47] and he talks about how he's working for
[30:49] the service company he's going to make
[30:50] his way down there and he's going to
[30:51] find his place path to where they
[30:53] were and he said that um this boy worked
[30:56] for a Lumber Company
[30:57] and he said he had an old box car and
[30:59] they put newspapers up and tacky buttons
[31:01] and he asked if anybody knew what a
[31:02] tacky button is does anybody know what a
[31:03] tacky button is and brother Brandon
[31:05] would say well what part of Kentucky are
[31:07] you from anyhow because apparently
[31:09] people who knew what that was were from
[31:11] Kentucky take cardboard he said they put
[31:12] a tack in it push it into the wall and
[31:14] they put up paper and newspapers This Is
[31:16] How They furred out and finished out the
[31:19] inside of an old train car he had bought
[31:21] some brought down some old boxes and
[31:23] they had made a table out of
[31:26] it he says and this is where the quote
[31:28] is here he says' but brother if I'd ever
[31:30] found a heaven on Earth it
[31:34] was if I'd ever found a heaven on Earth
[31:37] it was not walking through the place
[31:39] that had the really nice gate and the 14
[31:41] karat door knobs and the the
[31:43] Millionaire's daughter and a a nice
[31:45] intelligent good-look young man on the
[31:46] inside but he calls this box car with
[31:49] newspaper as wallpaper with box of old
[31:52] boxes as a table and chairs and he says
[31:54] brother if I ever found heaven on Earth
[31:56] it was
[31:58] brother Braham dramatizes how from that
[32:00] vantage point he could look up and turn
[32:01] around this way and look to the top of
[32:02] the hill and see one home of the other
[32:04] the top of one home the Steeples on top
[32:06] of the house and then look at the box
[32:08] car and his question was who is the rich
[32:10] man but notice what he says about this
[32:13] home it might not have had a lot of
[32:16] amenities it might it wasn't even a home
[32:17] let's just be technical wasn't a house
[32:20] it was a box car but yet somehow they
[32:22] took a box car how cold and hard and and
[32:26] how much it would have lacked but yet
[32:28] brother Bram said they made an old box
[32:30] car heaven on
[32:33] Earth and I say that to express this
[32:36] ideal tonight just as much as our body
[32:38] is a temple of the Holy Ghost and we
[32:40] could call ourselves the Gates of Heaven
[32:42] as being the very place where God dwells
[32:44] and where God manifests himself written
[32:46] Epistles and and and the manifestation
[32:48] of the Living God we could say that our
[32:50] house can be a home for heaven a place
[32:54] where God is welcome and this is
[32:56] something to a Spire or two that our
[32:58] home can be a place that when other
[33:00] people come they find that the
[33:02] atmosphere in our home is
[33:04] different it can be a a Gate of Heaven
[33:08] where we as the church live and others
[33:11] can be at the very foot of Heaven
[33:14] themselves that they too can meet Christ
[33:17] in your home that might be the most
[33:19] effective tool of witnessing and not
[33:21] necessar just to invite them to church
[33:22] but when they're with you you're a Gate
[33:24] of Heaven that your life is lived in
[33:27] such a way to where something's
[33:28] beckoning them there's Angels descending
[33:30] now to this portal in this place and
[33:32] you're a bear of heaven and they find
[33:34] themselves coming in contact with heaven
[33:36] and that your home likewise could be a
[33:37] place that when people are in that home
[33:39] like it's different here has a different
[33:41] vibe to it I could tell that this isn't
[33:43] like all other homes and that would not
[33:45] only be in the way that it's laid out
[33:47] necessarily and and the things that are
[33:48] in it but even the
[33:50] atmosphere that you provide in that home
[33:53] because you are the church and where is
[33:55] the church it lives in that home home
[33:58] and I could even just kind of point that
[33:59] your children live
[34:01] there other family may live there from
[34:03] time to time people come visit your your
[34:05] house if I could put it this way this
[34:07] will maybe be a theme that we'll try to
[34:08] pick up here soon your house can be made
[34:10] a home also a home for the
[34:14] supernatural a Gate of
[34:17] Heaven 1 Timothy chapter 3 we read about
[34:20] how he was drawn that parallel how a man
[34:22] who rules his house could take care of
[34:24] the Church of God all right is asking if
[34:27] a man can't rule his own house then how
[34:29] can he rule the Church of God because I
[34:31] believe it's incumbent upon all of us as
[34:33] men to rule our house whether we rule
[34:35] the house of God or not it is something
[34:37] that we ought to
[34:39] do and in verse 15 he says but if I T
[34:42] long that thou mayest know how that thou
[34:44] oughtest to behave thyself in the house
[34:47] of God which is the Church of the Living
[34:51] God the pillar and ground of the
[34:54] truth we'll amplify this more later
[34:58] tonight I just I have just a few more
[35:00] things to share with you and be finished
[35:02] and the scripture has a lot of detail we
[35:04] can bring into it but he brings in the
[35:07] church which we've read about brother BR
[35:08] says you're born into the Church of the
[35:10] Living God and there's only one church
[35:11] God lives in his church God goes to
[35:13] church every day uh that is the Church
[35:16] of the Living God he calls it the pillar
[35:18] and ground of Truth well that's a
[35:20] statement to chew on a little bit to
[35:21] ponder some that the pillar and ground
[35:23] of truth that is the Church of the
[35:25] Living God but he also brings in the if
[35:28] I could say the local Gathering into
[35:29] view at the same time that you might
[35:31] know how you ought to behave yourself in
[35:33] the house of God that has something to
[35:35] do with the Church of the Living God
[35:37] which is the pillar and ground of truth
[35:40] because the local church itself and its
[35:41] government its structure and its
[35:42] location is not the pillar and ground of
[35:44] truth but it is a Gathering Place for
[35:46] those who are part of the Church of God
[35:49] as we said before this church serves the
[35:51] true church this church isn't the true
[35:52] church otherwise I would have just
[35:54] called it true church or the true church
[35:56] and all the others are Impostors right I
[35:58] mean that has to be what it is if you
[36:00] want to call it that but it's not the
[36:02] true church yet it serves the true
[36:04] church we are a church because there are
[36:06] churches who are the living place of God
[36:08] who are the individuals who are God's
[36:10] church and God's dwelling place that
[36:12] come to church that the Holy Spirit
[36:13] leads them to be in service and so God
[36:16] has churches to receive the members of
[36:18] the true church if there was no the
[36:20] church we shouldn't even have a church
[36:23] puts things into
[36:25] perspective we read this it may have
[36:27] been in part one on this series in the
[36:29] sermon why I fa just to read it again
[36:31] tonight CU he gives an emphasis here he
[36:34] says because there's no joy in the house
[36:35] of the Lord why do people are not
[36:37] overcoming and why things are the way
[36:39] they are why don't people go to church
[36:40] is it because you don't find Joy there
[36:42] what makes a person want to drink and
[36:44] run around and act like that is it
[36:45] because we don't have any God is it
[36:48] because there's no joy in the house of
[36:49] the Lord
[36:50] anymore that that's good that's a good
[36:53] question why do people fall away and why
[36:56] do things get cold and get things get
[36:58] stagnant he said is it because there's
[37:01] no joy in the house of the Lord anymore
[37:03] is it because the Holy Spirit isn't
[37:04] ready to bless all of us is there
[37:06] anything wrong with it is there anything
[37:08] wrong with God nope anything wrong with
[37:09] the word nope anything wrong with the
[37:10] Holy Ghost nope something's got to be
[37:12] wrong somewhere but because that we do
[37:14] it that's the reason we're cursed that's
[37:16] the reason God's puts this thing upon
[37:18] the church this cold and dampness we're
[37:20] going to other places for pleasure
[37:22] instead of the coming to the house of
[37:24] the Lord for pleasure I what a checkup
[37:27] you say well I come to the house of the
[37:29] Lord I'm checking the box I'm there I'm
[37:30] a good message Catholic I'm there I'm
[37:32] checking the boxes I'm doing the
[37:33] stations this is what a message uh
[37:35] believer does but if you're not coming
[37:37] to the house of the Lord for pleasure
[37:39] but you're going to all the other houses
[37:41] and and and opportunities and
[37:44] extravaganzas and invitations and
[37:47] attractions if you're going there for
[37:48] pleasure but yet you go to church and
[37:50] you're not finding your pleasure there
[37:52] if your one thing desired isn't found in
[37:54] this house but you find all the other
[37:56] Desires in other places that's why
[37:58] that's how a church get
[38:00] cold it's the reason why God puts the
[38:02] cold and dampness on the church it's
[38:05] because people don't want to be there
[38:06] anymore for the right
[38:08] thing that's how they go in the ruts and
[38:10] and and and the presence of the Lord
[38:11] leaves it and it's just routine and it's
[38:13] just up and down it's the roller coaster
[38:15] the up and down because people are going
[38:17] to other places for pleasure and he
[38:18] doesn't say they're forsaking to go to
[38:20] the house of the Lord but they don't go
[38:22] for
[38:24] pleasure then he says the house of the
[38:25] Lord is the Joy the
[38:27] Lord the house of the Lord is where God
[38:30] finds joy amen there's something
[38:32] satisfying to the Lord to have a house
[38:34] where he can dwell then he says the joy
[38:36] of the Lord is the joy of his people so
[38:39] the house ought to be something that
[38:40] gives Joy there's something that
[38:42] stimulates Joy he says he wants you to
[38:45] to come to church and to worship him and
[38:48] be happy and satisfied give him praise
[38:51] and honor and glory and wisdom and might
[38:52] and power to God he wants you to do that
[38:56] this should be a thesis statement for
[38:57] every service that we come to church to
[39:00] worship him and to be happy and
[39:02] satisfied giving praise and honor and
[39:04] glory and wisdom and might and power to
[39:06] God this is what church ought to be we
[39:09] ought to have these elements in it if
[39:10] this church doesn't have it all then all
[39:12] let's get serious about seeing
[39:15] it come to church to worship Him be
[39:18] happy
[39:19] satisfied you ought to be happy to come
[39:21] to church I know what it's like to dread
[39:24] going to church that's no way God wants
[39:26] a Believer to live I believe that
[39:28] there's a certain trauma that's
[39:30] inflicted into a spirit of a Believer
[39:31] every time they go to the house of the
[39:33] Lord in
[39:34] dread fearful of what will be swn into
[39:37] them with complexes already being beaten
[39:38] into them and they go and it's wound
[39:40] after wound after wound When God says
[39:42] that we're to be happy when we go to
[39:44] church we ought to be satisfied when
[39:46] we're
[39:47] leaving there's such a trauma to a
[39:49] person's Spirit they begin to express
[39:51] certain physical maladies and problems
[39:53] because they're not getting the
[39:54] satisfaction they should from the house
[39:56] the
[39:57] Lord about to be honor glory and wisdom
[40:00] and might and the power of God he says
[40:01] he wants you to do that he wants us to
[40:03] go to
[40:05] church brother Bram in the sermon the
[40:07] unchangeable word of God he says the
[40:08] Bible says these signs shall follow them
[40:10] that
[40:11] believe and I believe that go read that
[40:15] these signs shall follow them that
[40:17] believe we know where he put it in the
[40:19] Bible and he never took it away he says
[40:22] God makes a distinction he gives a mark
[40:24] on the people if he believes these signs
[40:28] shall follow them that believe that's
[40:29] right the believer not that they say
[40:32] they believe or not the supposed
[40:34] believer but the real believer says I
[40:36] want to belong to a church that's got
[40:38] them signs and wonders following it now
[40:41] make sure they're biblical right make
[40:42] sure they're scriptural make sure
[40:43] they're according to scripture but he
[40:44] said I want a church that's got
[40:46] scriptural signs and wonders following
[40:48] it that's where I want to have my
[40:50] fellowship right under the blood of
[40:51] Jesus Christ notice what he says about
[40:54] the about church cuz he's being very
[40:56] clear he's not saying I want to go to
[40:57] heaven he's not saying he wants to go to
[40:58] the temple in Jerusalem he's saying I
[41:01] want to go to a church this is going to
[41:03] a local church this is a place that a
[41:05] Believer finds himself wanting to be
[41:07] place where he just said we ought to go
[41:09] to church and he wants you to come to
[41:10] church and worship him he says I want to
[41:12] belong to church that's got signs that's
[41:14] where I want to have my fellowship we're
[41:16] angels and powers and Holy Ghost and God
[41:18] works back and forth through his church
[41:20] through his people showing signs and
[41:23] wonders says why it's the greatest thing
[41:25] I've ever not my life it's a part of
[41:28] Heaven on
[41:30] Earth look at that Cemetery where a man
[41:33] and a woman living in poverty in a box
[41:35] car down by the river could have what
[41:37] brother said if I've ever found a heaven
[41:39] on Earth it was in the arrangement of a
[41:43] man to a woman in a and a box car that
[41:45] wasn't even a proper house but yet
[41:47] brother man sister there was a home
[41:48] where there was Heaven on Earth and then
[41:51] he could say of a church no matter what
[41:53] its address whether no matter what if
[41:56] it's
[41:57] composition he could say a place where
[41:59] the Holy Ghost moves and works God works
[42:02] back and forth It's a
[42:04] gate Holy Spirit descending coming
[42:07] angels and powers of the Holy Ghost
[42:08] coming to the church working through his
[42:10] people showing signs and W says it's a
[42:13] part of Heaven on Earth Church ought to
[42:15] be a place where Heaven makes himself
[42:17] known on
[42:19] Earth again it's a
[42:25] gate
[42:28] I feel like I'm pre I've been preaching
[42:29] like 13 minutes and then I I look and I
[42:32] know probably been preaching fast enough
[42:34] to fill 13 hours and I look at the clock
[42:36] it's time to stop I don't know how this
[42:39] happens what I don't it's the mic I know
[42:41] it it's got to
[42:42] be the mic this not you brother
[42:46] Mike or is it the
[42:50] mic but as we just try to tie this
[42:52] together and I've been looking at a lot
[42:53] of different places where brother BR
[42:54] talks about God's house
[42:56] even went down a rabbit Trail in Phoenix
[42:58] history here recently where brother
[42:59] Bam's referring to he's in an auditorium
[43:02] and he says this is God's house he's in
[43:04] an auditorium and I've gone back and
[43:05] I've read newspaper clippings from the
[43:07] 30s and 20s of what's held in this
[43:10] Auditorium it was a a law it was a
[43:13] Auditorium put together H for a place of
[43:16] amusement and and other people could
[43:17] rent and things could be expressed but
[43:19] BR say now it's a place that's been set
[43:21] aside for the word to go forth for
[43:23] angels to descend the power of God to
[43:24] move he says this is the house of God
[43:26] and a place that may be used for
[43:28] something totally different when eyes
[43:30] are turned towards heaven and the holy
[43:32] spirit's made welcome it could become a
[43:34] heaven on
[43:35] Earth and if God could do that in an
[43:39] auditorium look what God did service
[43:41] after service at the Hilton Garden in at
[43:44] the Marriott service after service if
[43:46] God could turn a hotel room and I
[43:48] remember I had this in my heart every
[43:50] time we would gather we might not know
[43:51] what happened in the Saturday night
[43:53] before sometimes we did and we were like
[43:56] oh boy that's interesting but we had
[43:59] this confidence to know that what they
[44:01] did the night before wasn't greater than
[44:03] what my God could do and we knew that
[44:05] God had ordained that ground for us to
[44:07] come together in the name of the Lord
[44:09] Jesus Christ and where we were he would
[44:11] be there also and we believe that when
[44:13] we gathered that was the house of God
[44:15] and the presence of God would come and I
[44:17] want you to think if a hotel room that's
[44:20] used for weddings and sell seminars and
[44:22] there's this yo-yo back and forth from a
[44:24] Wednesday to a Sunday and all sorts of
[44:26] other nonsense that takes place can be
[44:28] turned into the house of God how much
[44:30] more can we transform our own homes into
[44:33] a house of
[44:34] God and not be afraid of the change that
[44:38] we can make within our own Dwelling
[44:39] Place you may not have much say what you
[44:42] can do in the rest of the house but you
[44:43] could turn your
[44:44] bedroom into a place that's
[44:48] consecrated I mean these
[44:50] words and we ought to feel the same way
[44:53] about this
[44:54] church it ought to be be a place where
[44:56] we're happy and satisfied to come a
[44:59] place where the praise of God the honor
[45:00] and glory and wisdom and the might of
[45:01] God is welcome place where the power of
[45:03] God moves and because it because it's
[45:06] that's so we have a we have a respect
[45:08] for it when we come we come expecting to
[45:11] hear from God because it's a Gate of
[45:14] Heaven I am the Church of God and here I
[45:17] am coming to a house of God where God
[45:20] wants to speak to me talk about
[45:21] omnipotence
[45:23] meeting talk about how we we might we
[45:26] might be wanting to check what the speed
[45:27] limmit is so we could hurry up a little
[45:28] bit and get to church right I don't want
[45:31] to drive below the speed limit what is
[45:32] it I want to hit it I want to get there
[45:33] I want and have this excitement to be in
[45:35] church and say well why what's the whole
[45:37] point do you even know what it is do you
[45:39] even know what it can do very reason why
[45:42] I was using the tagline kids eat free my
[45:45] whole rationale and justification and my
[45:47] vision in sharing that was to get you
[45:50] thinking about
[45:54] it but there's a
[45:58] parallel among the three
[46:02] gates your body which we say your body
[46:05] it's who you are your three- room house
[46:08] Body Spirit soul and because the Lord
[46:10] lives down in that Soul guess what the
[46:12] house it was called the house of the
[46:13] Lord but the Lord wasn't walking around
[46:15] the outer Court he was in the inner
[46:17] court or in the holies of holies so
[46:20] there's a parallel among these three
[46:22] gates that we can begin to see and
[46:24] recognize and we could use it to bring
[46:25] certain things out that there's things
[46:26] that's true of the local church that are
[46:28] just a type of the family and there's
[46:31] things that are true of the temple that
[46:32] are just a type of you as an
[46:35] individual but these parallels among the
[46:37] three gates the body your house where
[46:39] you live your residence your room your
[46:41] apartment whatever it might be in the
[46:44] church and your home life ought to
[46:47] reflect the hidden
[46:49] life the way that we dress the way that
[46:51] we act reflects the hidden life and then
[46:54] the home life ought to reflect the
[46:55] hidden life and the church ought to
[46:57] reflect the Life of
[46:59] Christ and I believe as I've already me
[47:02] mentioned this I believe that the church
[47:03] exist to promote the health and
[47:05] well-being of your body and your
[47:07] home and not so much just your physical
[47:10] body but that too there's a lot of
[47:12] things that we could teach from the
[47:13] house of God to correct Us in the way
[47:15] that we even keep our natural bodies
[47:18] there's a lot of things that could be
[47:19] taught uh that relate to things that
[47:21] relate to mental health and physical
[47:23] health and I believe the church exists
[47:26] with an idea that it must give resources
[47:28] and minister to the needs of the
[47:30] individual and to the home life the
[47:33] family because we need all three this is
[47:36] kind of where I'm wanting to wrap this
[47:38] up we need all three we need to have a
[47:40] body otherwise who who are
[47:43] you we need we need that home otherwise
[47:47] we have no place to
[47:49] live and we need a church because
[47:52] together they constitute in that three
[47:54] that three room house three different
[47:56] elements of our existence your soul
[47:59] think of this your soul which has been
[48:01] sealed by God that is that's the real
[48:04] you as brother BR calls it that's the
[48:06] that's the me that's the US the
[48:08] individual it's inner it's the most
[48:12] private that's where you know who you
[48:14] really are deep down in your soul no
[48:16] matter how much we wrestle in our spirit
[48:18] sometimes as a result of Disobedience or
[48:20] stubbornness or everything there's just
[48:22] a place we come to deep down in our soul
[48:24] brother even desing it at one time just
[48:26] like maybe the sliver of her fingernail
[48:27] but once your Anchor's there you realize
[48:29] no I know I'm a Son of God I know I'm a
[48:30] daughter of God and that's the inner
[48:32] part that's the private part that's
[48:34] where the faith is but then even as we
[48:37] have a spirit that's the part that other
[48:38] people get to know a little bit your
[48:41] personality it's it's still personal but
[48:44] and and but yet some of it's hidden not
[48:46] so much from everybody but your spirit
[48:47] is even indicative of the house people
[48:50] come into your home they get to know you
[48:51] a little bit better they learn certain
[48:52] things about you I don't know why this
[48:54] just pops in my mind but you want know
[48:55] some houses just have a smell to it
[48:58] right and it's not that it's bad but
[48:59] you're like that's the meiri smell right
[49:03] and uh and like man if they ever made a
[49:05] candle just don't ever buy it for me or
[49:07] something like that right there there's
[49:09] just a scent that some people have and
[49:11] we associate so there's a there's the
[49:13] you in the soul but then there's also a
[49:14] spirit that's a you that other people
[49:16] know they don't know you in the soul
[49:18] just like your house becomes an
[49:19] extension of who you are it's hidden
[49:21] from the world it's personal but yet
[49:23] people can be invited into it you can
[49:25] see the outer
[49:27] court and then you have your body that's
[49:30] visible it's public other people can see
[49:34] it other people can make judgments about
[49:36] you based upon your body and how tall
[49:37] you are how short you are and boy he's
[49:39] short he must have a little man's
[49:40] complex or you know there's just certain
[49:42] things that people could try to say he's
[49:43] tall he must play basketball and there's
[49:45] things that people conclude and things
[49:46] they could know about
[49:48] you and things that they can see that's
[49:51] public and you can even see in that Soul
[49:53] spirit and body there's a lot of things
[49:54] that we could see in these parallels
[49:55] among them how that even the body that's
[49:57] the
[49:58] church this is it's open to the public
[50:01] people could come and they can see and
[50:03] they can experience things they can
[50:04] relate to it and people drive by they
[50:06] see the church they see how we keep up
[50:08] with the property they can see the
[50:09] services online everyone can PE into
[50:11] this not the same way that others could
[50:13] into someone's home and certainly not
[50:15] the way that someone knows your life
[50:16] privately and so you can see Soul spirit
[50:18] and body even laid out in these
[50:20] different rooms and these different
[50:23] Gates brother Bram says in the sermon
[50:25] and it not he says that's three rings
[50:27] three circles it's where he The Body
[50:30] Spirit Soul he said that's you and he
[50:32] says that's God God and a trinity is one
[50:35] and without a trinity he's not
[50:37] God he can't be manifested any other way
[50:40] and neither can you be manifested
[50:43] without being the Trinity that you are
[50:45] the Trinity person that you are that's
[50:47] Body Spirit Soul so you have to have all
[50:50] three to be manifested without either
[50:52] one of them you are not complete
[50:56] you didn't have a soul you'd be nothing
[50:58] you didn't have a spirit you wouldn't be
[50:59] nothing you didn't have a body you'd
[51:01] just be a spirit not a body and what I'm
[51:04] wanting to say and not that anyone would
[51:06] overthink this and try to over type it
[51:08] or try to be legalistic with it but if
[51:10] we don't have these three gates
[51:13] something's
[51:14] missing if he doesn't If he if we are
[51:16] not a Gate of Heaven our souls aren't
[51:18] sealed you could have a house and you
[51:20] could have a CH church but without it
[51:22] you're nothing and you could have you
[51:24] could say I have the Holy Ghost and you
[51:26] could have a home but yet you don't have
[51:28] a church something's
[51:30] missing he says you can't be manifested
[51:33] without being a trinity person that you
[51:34] are without any one of them you're not
[51:36] complete and could we not say that yet
[51:39] even as an individual I could recognize
[51:41] the need for these places the need for
[51:44] these things the strength of my own
[51:45] spiritual well-being as an individual
[51:47] the atmosphere and the condition of my
[51:49] home and a happy place where I'm
[51:51] satisfied to go as a
[51:53] church and I believe as I I say this and
[51:55] just rounding it out got a couple more
[51:57] scriptures and a statement to read from
[51:58] the message we have a duty to consecrate
[52:01] these
[52:02] Gates we have a duty to make these Gates
[52:05] of Heaven and not gates of hell we have
[52:08] duty to consecrate these Gates and these
[52:11] houses as homes to
[52:13] God we become Gates of Heaven our body
[52:19] me as a person my home and my
[52:23] church remember what we read about a
[52:25] gate Gate of Heaven was a meeting place
[52:28] a gate was an entrance it was a meeting
[52:30] place place of authority a place of
[52:32] judging a place where others can have
[52:34] access to God a place to see God
[52:36] manifested a place to receive the
[52:38] truth that's what we ought to be and say
[52:41] I want to be a Gate of Heaven my life
[52:44] let my life me as an individual my words
[52:47] the things I seek the way I live the way
[52:48] I dress let it be a Gate of Heaven our
[52:52] distinction that God gives us in our
[52:53] distinction as men and women and and
[52:55] even the way that we individually live
[52:56] it out as brothers and sisters he does
[52:58] it so that we can be identified as a
[53:00] Gate of
[53:03] Heaven but because these are to be Gates
[53:05] of Heaven me as an individual Christian
[53:09] my home life and my church the gates are
[53:12] what the enemy
[53:14] attacks he wants to that's where he
[53:16] wants to find uh he wants to make us
[53:18] vulnerable and weaken us because that's
[53:20] where he can have access in Ezekiel CH
[53:23] 21:15 he says I've set the point point
[53:25] of the sword against all their
[53:30] Gates it's referring to
[53:32] this act of pointing the sword toward
[53:35] their gates in this particular passage
[53:37] as I was reading and studying on it he's
[53:40] not only just saying my sword is at the
[53:41] gates of the city but it's at the gates
[53:45] of your Palace and at the gates of your
[53:48] home it's not just going to be the city
[53:51] structurally that's going to be punished
[53:53] but the palace The Authority is going to
[53:54] be punished the homes are going to be
[53:56] punished it referred to the city the
[53:57] palace and their houses why because
[53:59] they're all have
[54:00] Gates and these are things that we must
[54:02] guard we must strengthen things that we
[54:04] must be aware of that these are Gates of
[54:06] Heaven my life my home my church these
[54:09] are Gates of Heaven and and I want to be
[54:11] conscious of them we must guard these
[54:15] Gates my body my house my church in
[54:17] Psalms 147: 12 and 13 praise the Lord oh
[54:20] Jerusalem praise thy God o Zion for he
[54:23] ha strengthened the bars of thy Gates
[54:26] Heath blessed thy children within thee
[54:29] this is the secret to even strengthening
[54:32] relationships with our children and as
[54:34] our children are reared I've blessed thy
[54:36] children within thee because he
[54:37] strengthened the
[54:39] gates I I the Gates of Heaven whether it
[54:42] be myself my home the physical house or
[54:45] the church we've got to have all three
[54:48] strong and again I'm not trying to Sher
[54:51] responsibility uh because if anything
[54:53] I'm taking on more responsibility I
[54:54] believe in my heart and that
[54:57] begins the strength of a church is
[54:59] directly reflected in the strength of
[55:01] the individuals and the strength of the
[55:03] family so as a church I want to
[55:04] strengthen those and willing to take
[55:07] responsibility if there's weakness say
[55:08] all right we need to do better we need
[55:09] to try harder as a church but let's all
[55:11] take responsibility to strengthen the
[55:16] gates and think about what these Gates
[55:18] mean the Gates of Heaven and how that
[55:21] God wants all your gates to belong to
[55:24] him
[55:25] God hiding himself in Simplicity then
[55:27] revealing himself in the same we've read
[55:29] this recently we've read it several
[55:31] times but he says now I think it's our
[55:32] duty to make the inside right by the
[55:35] grace of God to be so grateful to
[55:39] God it's our duty he's talking about the
[55:42] Tabernacle he's talking about a recent
[55:43] Remodel and he says man they do a lot to
[55:45] make the outside look good and I was
[55:47] even just looking at some pictures of
[55:49] what this church looked like when we
[55:50] first rented it you remember the 30x30
[55:53] red carpet red chairs
[55:55] the the portal to the 80s that it was
[55:59] and and and we were happy maybe we've
[56:02] done a lot to make things look better
[56:04] even on the outside it doesn't even look
[56:05] the same anymore things that have been
[56:07] done and by the help of Agape Church our
[56:09] landlords and and just everyone working
[56:11] together the labor the trustees and
[56:12] those that have given there's been a lot
[56:14] of things made right but then he says we
[56:16] have a duty to make the inside right by
[56:18] the grace of God and when he says that
[56:20] he doesn't mean just alone in the
[56:22] physical upkeep of the building but yet
[56:24] the ATM spere the thing that really
[56:26] makes house a home he said this will
[56:29] just not only be a beautiful building
[56:31] that we come to but may everyone who
[56:33] comes in see the beautiful
[56:35] characteristic of Jesus Christ and every
[56:38] person that comes
[56:40] in church after
[56:42] church such like on a you say well
[56:45] people say well how many people were at
[56:46] church on Sunday we we say we don't
[56:49] count people anymore we count
[56:52] churches there was aund 50 churches
[56:56] there on Sunday people like wait what
[56:58] what in the world I was at a meeting one
[57:00] time where a brother had all the
[57:01] ministers stand up in the meeting and so
[57:03] about maybe 30 Brothers stood up in the
[57:04] meeting and the next night he asked
[57:07] again and the same Brothers like oh well
[57:09] here we are again and stood up again and
[57:10] the third time third meeting he had it
[57:12] happen again he goes there was 30 the
[57:13] first night 30 the second night 30
[57:15] tonight there was 90 ministers
[57:16] represented the building we're
[57:18] like it's the same 30 every
[57:21] night but maybe we could have even that
[57:23] kind of added to us I'm Church coming to
[57:26] church that this is a place where people
[57:28] can see the beautiful characteristic of
[57:29] the Church of Jesus Christ and each
[57:32] family and how it conducts himself in
[57:33] each individual he says may it be a
[57:35] consecrated place to our Lord a
[57:37] consecrated people I'm talking about the
[57:40] Gates of Heaven as us as individuals and
[57:43] now even the church itself and our homes
[57:45] may it be a consecrated place to our
[57:47] Lord as he's talking about the physical
[57:49] Church to be a consecrated place he says
[57:51] a consecrated people for no matter how
[57:53] beautiful the structure is that we
[57:55] certainly do appreciate the beauty of
[57:57] the church is the character of the
[57:59] people I trust it'll always be a house
[58:02] of God of beauty let me be a house of
[58:05] God where people could see the beauty of
[58:07] the Lord as David said one thing have I
[58:09] desired Lord that will I seek after that
[58:11] I may dwell in the house Lord all the
[58:14] days of my life to inquire in his Temple
[58:15] to behold the beauty of the Lord let me
[58:18] be a bear of God's
[58:20] Beauty the beauty of the church is the
[58:22] character of the people therefore I want
[58:25] my life to be seasoned I want it to be
[58:27] working towards a glory I want it to be
[58:30] expressing the right kind of things and
[58:31] emphasizing the right kind of thing
[58:33] because my life expresses the beauty of
[58:35] Christ's
[58:36] character and as he prayed this for
[58:39] brandom Tabernacle I pray it for you as
[58:42] individuals I pray it for your houses
[58:44] that they could be homes and I pray it
[58:46] for Arizona Believers Church that the
[58:48] beauty of this church would be the
[58:49] character of the people that it would
[58:52] always be a house of God's Beauty
[58:55] will you stand with me this
[58:58] evening bow our heads in prayer that it
[59:01] would be a house of God's
[59:03] Beauty
