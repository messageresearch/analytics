TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I have planned and trus in that the Lord will give us uh the ability to do so if he leads otherwise we can always pivot but we have uh wanted to take over the next several Services a Christmas series and uh I want to explore and you can give that title slide brother John I want to explore the subject of hate and so Mary Haus just wasn't ringing very good so we're just going to go with the title of hate uh if I get more creative I will and um my title is where is the peace or where is the Peace uh drawing from a Wendy's commercial when I was growing up where's the beef and so where's the peace and I think that this will uh be very relevant to you God's really dealt with my heart on the subject of hate and I want to explore it through several Services if you'll allow us I feel uh heavily burdened on the subject and even very directed with some of the very specific things that we would like to address and I think you'll find that uh maybe we'll put in the context of Christmas and the different things that relate to the birth of Christ or maybe the season but I think the subject matter will be extremely practical and relevant uh just the word of hate has to be very relevant to you I mentioned this to somebody uh last week uh and I just was mentioning what we're going to be preaching on and he said um how relevant this is hate week I didn't even realize it was called hate week uh being The Devout Christian that I am I wouldn't have known that uh but apparently there's even a week called hate week and uh I think it's just relevant in a lot of ways just even with some things people experience from time to time I hope you can draw something from it at the end of the day I'm trusting that we're able to expose the devil and his tactics the ways that he works against us and gets our mind uh moving and some of the things that he does and if we could just take that and ask yourself the question where is the Peace where is the Peace that God has promise so now if you'll turn to Luke Chapter 2 as you're already there like to just start here and look at this this scripture and to take from it a few places where it's kind of putting in context what this birth of Christ is to bring and as we read there how there were shepherds in the field uh there near Bethlehem and at night this Angel comes and the glory of the Lord is around them and it says in verse 10 and the angel said unto them fear not behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people and this phrase Good Tidings of great joy it means good news of intense happiness it's something of great strength of intense gladness uh we're going to bring you good tidings it's the gospel of great great joy so this is something that ought to impact your senses something that's powerfully affecting the way you think the way you feel and that's the news that they were bringing something that would be intense and I want to give you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people and then this is kind of the that great news the gospel For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddl closes lying in the manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying this is this pronouncement this excited utterance glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men there's a lot that we could say to amplify these two phrases of Good Tidings of great joy and uh this uh glory to God and peace on Earth and Good Will towards men but it's declaring God's favor to man kind which is remarkable seeing how dark it was and how forgetful the people had been of God and it's announcing this there's going to be peace there's going to be reconciliation to say peace on Earth and Good Will towards man it's to create some sort of anticipation an expectation for what the Messiah is to be and what he's to accomplish and really kind of sums up salvation and Reconciliation and this great peace that's going to be given to men and I'd like to uh Focus for a few moments on the peace that is brought to us through Jesus Christ says in Romans 5:1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ being justified by faith and being our sins being forgiven we have peace with God so this is when he declares and they said we're bringing you the gospel Good Tidings of intense gladness and glory to God in the highest because there's peace on Earth and Good Will to men it speaks of the peace that we can have with God God through Christ says in chap verse 8 of that same chapter but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him that's speaking of God's Wrath and you say well I'm saved but people still get angry at me well you might want to evaluate your conduct but also there's just some Knuckleheads out there I guess that get angry pretty easily but we're saved from the wrath of God that this is the peace that he gives us that God's no longer his wrath has been satisfied being justified I'm not subject to punishment therefore we do not have to live in fear of God's anger or God's Wrath or God's uh condemnation we have peace through Jesus Christ it says in verse 10 for if when we were enemies that's what he say while we were yet sinners and now he uses this phrase and I hope this can kind of follow through the whole service when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life amen we were at one time an enemy with God because of sin and now when we were enemies we're reconciled by the death of his son the relationships changed where we don't have to think of God as our adversary we can't we don't have to think of God as being one who's angry with us who's going to punish us and who's going to uh destroy us or do something to harm us we can rest knowing that God's Wrath has been satisfied that we're no longer enemies we've been reconciled together with him Paul writes it this way in Ephesians chap 2: 14 15 and 16 for he is our peace who ha made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us there was a wall between us there was a barrier between us there was there was something there that uh made us um against God and our minds against God and we resisted God but through the work of the Cross uh that wall has been torn down the middle wall of ition between us is abolished he says verse 15 having abolish abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances this enmity is hatred he hath abolished the hatred that was between us Heath abolish this anger this wrath even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of Twain one new man so making peace that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby where there was hatred where there was hostility the the Messiah through his death he slays that he abolishes it if there was a a Chasm if there was a gap if there was a wall between you if there was some sort of distance and well we're not getting along anymore and we're not talking we're aranged the the death of Jesus Christ brings peace and brings parties together and it reconciles it to where there's no more h ility there's no more anger there's no more finger pointing there's no more blame there's no well you're going to get what's coming to you it's one of those things that's always uh people live their whole lives looking over their shoulder wonder if something's going to catch up to them and or or whenever there's disagreement or somebody's done something that's hurt somebody there's always this tendency sometimes when you think it's all been forgiven and it's no longer an issue and everything's in the past it comes up again it's kind like well you remember that one time and so there's still some sort of hostility or conflict God is saying go gone am absolutely gone there's there's not a a way that we walk with Christ for a while and we're really really happy and things are going well he's I love God is where things are going really well he's like I love you you're Justified you never did it in the first place and then you miss the service and he goes you know what as a matter of fact I was just thinking about when you and bring something up no it's there's peace with God we're no longer enemies and this peace that it's speaking of is quietness tranquility oh brother Loy was singing that oh the I've heard it said the gospel is rest that's what it is it's Tranquility there's this exemption from Rage and havoc and Chaos of War uh there's there's no conflict you can rest there's uh you know how it can be in life and there's certain situations where you're just kind of always uptight a little tense because you don't know what's going to happen uh even if it's just you you uh you're in the middle of a big prank war and you never know when you're going to turn around a corner and somebody's going to throw water on you so you're you're always on edge you're always looking you're always watching and you always have to be on guard well this is to be to have peace means you're not looking over your shoulder you don't have to be on guard you don't have to worry about tomorrow whether or not your sins are going to catch up to you if you're justified by faith you have peace it's quietness this word peace means Harmony or Accord there's agreement there and because of this harmony Accord the word and the scripture especially in the Old Testament the images that are raised and then are carrying over into the New Testament to have peace means that there's safety and there's Prosperity because of the peace when you're at War there's certain resources that have to be dedicated to Warfare when you're at War there's certain things you cannot do in order to safeguard yourself and so in the Bible when it speaks of Peace it means there's safety and there being safety there's Prosperity uh for you to do the things to create income to grow your crops and to sustain yourselves and so for there to be peace that means there's safety and there's prosperity there's Harmony there's agreement and your enemies have laid down their arms and everyone is satisfied when Zachariah at the announcement uh that he was going to have a child when he was no longer and he was no longer mute he could speak it says in Luke 1:71 he says that we should be saved speaking of the Messiah to come that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us when you expresses this as a Jew and and the promise of the Messiah we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us this is more than just peace with God but this is peace on Earth this is suggesting arrest from hostility and torment or the attack of haters in other words Zachariah was saying I know haters going to hate but guess what one day they ain't it was saying this is this is going to be peace we're going to be safe from our enemies and from the hand that all all that haters haters going to hate was another working title I was going to use and we may still use it we got a few more services yet but he's talking about not just AR rest from the uh wrath of God or enmity with God but it's saying we're going to be safe from our enemies those that hate us and so there's there's this relaxing of the hostility externally there's no looking over your shoulder there's no wondering if the Philistines are going to come it's no worry whether not the syrians or the Assyrians or the Gentiles are going to attack us and ravish our land and carry us off into Babylon say there's going to be peace because he would have had in mind Isaiah 9: 6 and 7 For unto us a child is born these are the very things these angels are glory to God in the highest on Earth peace and Good Will toward men because this is the promise of the Messiah For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful ful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace because that messiah's Reign is going to bring peace therefore there's safety and prosperity this is the reain that's envisioned by these even these Shepherds would have been oh this Kingdom Reign this reign of peace and Tranquility is upon us of the increase of his government and of the increase of his peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this this is the peace that is Promised in Christ and I'm I'm wanting to lay that Foundation of this great peace asking the question where's the peace because this peace promised by Christ is in stark contrast to hate right when they're even speaking of the Messiah and what he's to accomplish Paul is saying we've been saved from the wrath of God we were enemies but we're no longer enemies we've been reconciled Zachariah proclaims we're going to be saved from our enemies in the hand of all that hate us to have peace contrast hate if I can even say this his peace is the answer to hate that where there's hate peace is the answer now with that as a a setting I want to point to Matthew chapter 10 and so I will in Matthew chapter 10 few verses here from verse 34- 37 when we were speaking on the subject of perfect love earlier this year we took a service called love and hate there's a lot that we could still draw from that there's a lot of things we were trying to show that there's a there's a wrong kind of jealousy and envy but then there's a Godly jealousy and as we address uh the subject of hate there's some things we need to identify about hate and hatred but now Christ I mean this is what the Bible says Good Tidings of great joy uh on Earth peace and goodwi to men and then we read what Paul has said we read uh what Zachariah proclaims we read what Isaiah 9 has to say and so we're thinking something right and he says think not that I'm come to send peace on Earth and we're like that's exactly what I was thinking and he's saying don't think not that I'm come to send peace on Earth I'm come not to send peace but a sword and now I'm confused because the Bible's clearly saying there's to be peace and Jesus is saying now and I think you could think about this maturely and know that I'm not a skeptic and I'm not trying to create dissonance uh we know that there's this harmony here that there's truth here he said you you're thinking in your way about way things are going to transpire in the way things are going to be and he's saiding maybe you haven't got it all figured out and the way that you think it's going to be isn't exactly how it's going to happen and where you're thinking all your enemies are going to stop hating you and the Messiah is going to rule and reign in a particular way my coming is actually going to bring division for I'm not come I am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foe shall be they of his own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me this is quite a quite a declaration and as we read it maybe if we read it without any other knowledge of scripture maybe if we put it in more modern language uh he's saying that you you've got to choose me over your family a a and we would even we could put it in maybe some terms that are narcissistic and we think this is going to be somebody who's just going to take us away from the people that care about us going to manipulate us going to control us and it sounds pretty harsh but he he's expressing something about human nature and how that we could go deeper in several other scriptures there a lot there in that sermon on Love and Hate he says it this way in Luke 14:26 If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and breth and sisters yay in his own life also he cannot be my disciple I I I know that's that's strong that's a strong imagery and it's the T kind of things that makes some people get kind of tense and anxious and nervous because of human experience but what he's expressing is it's this hatred is to reject any influence that would call you away from Christ it it's not it's not a you U your mom serving God all our life and teaching you truth and filled with the Holy Ghost a good Godly Christian and then one day you meet Christ and you come home and your mom says oh honey it's so good to have you home I hate you it's like I know you've been telling me that for 21 years he like no I really do now because now I'm a Christian and the red letter says if I don't hate you and the mom's like right it's not it's not asking that we immediately turn around and start hating people as a way to declare our love to God our love to Christ but it's to it's to reject any influence that would call you away from Christ that love of family that would call to us and uh want to nurture you and look out after you and even the the peace we have sometimes and knowing that Daddy will take care of it or Mom you will take care of it saying that when you give your heart to God and you want to serve the Lord if they would try to call you away from that you would have to treat them as if you hated them by rejecting that that call to you and asking you to do something that you know would displease Goden he says I will set a man at variance that means to cut into two or to sever I will divide a man from his family they will be pitted against each other right and I I'm acknowledging the Paradox today he promises peace but it's division that comes he promises peace but it's animosity that rises up he promises peace think not that I come to bring peace on Earth in other words you're thinking everybody's going to soon get along with the Messiah but actually there's going to be Warfare there's going to be hostility there's going to be opposition he he's a polarizing figure if we could put it that way where there's Christ if you're going to serve him you've got to serve him because then there's an opposition that comes against it you've got to be with him there's he talks about no man can serve two masters cuz he'll you'll either uh you'll love one and hate the other and it's showing that there's got if there's going to be dedication if there's going to be service to Christ in in the presence of the disagreement and the presence of sin that's going to create opposition so this and I hope I'm not failing to to make it um I hope it's making sense to you because I want to move move on this hate now then is the opp I want to look at hate as the opposite of peace now we might think well love is the opposite of of hate and I'm I'm not disagreeing with that notion I'm looking at hate now as the opposite of peace and I'm making that connection very deliberately hate is defined as an intense negative emotional response towards someone or something has its atmology in spiked or malice it's an intense negative emotional response towards someone or something just as it's declared we bring you good tidings of great joy this was to be uh good news of intense gladness hate is on a different level it's an intense negative response towards someone or something has some sort of malice or spite it's to regard with extreme ill will to have a passionate aversion to it's not saying that you don't like it if you hate something this is to treat something as an enemy it has intensity to it and and I hope that there's this is relevant uh uh for you as you think about these feelings of hatred and to hate it's something that it's negative it's emotional and it's int intense it it's ill will I I guess in the the way that vernacular changes and how that you know there's a time when something was bad and it it was good a and even now maybe still when something is sick it's like really good you like I'm sick hey you need to be humble right let somebody else make that decision I and and there I don't but I don't know if they've co-opted hate just yet and to something positive to have hate is negative it's to hate is to treat something as your enemy now if if you could allow yourself to begin to picture what what is intended and what is in hate that if you hate something your aversion to it is you think that it's adversarial it's against you you're against it that it can do some harm to you now in John chapter 15 as we're hoping to understand better why Jesus said that I'm come to set a man divide a man with his own family and there's this hatred this hostility that's going to come as a result of Christ in John chapter 15 several verses from 17 to 25 this will just give us a larger context for this these things I command you that you love one another lest we confuse what he is expressing in Luke and Matthew earlier about if any man come and hate not his father and I've come to set a man at variance let it not not be any confusion he says you should love one another if the world hate you you know that it hated me before it hated you if you were of the world the world would love his own but because you are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you now God Christ commands us to love and in commanding us to love he identifies the hate that remains in the world and and his response isn't to say and because they hate you you can hate them back he's saying we ought to love one another and in the in this commandment to love he's acknowledging that there will be intense negative emotions directed to us that there may even be intense negative emotions trying to be provoked within us and love one another and the world is going to hate you and just remember they hate you because they hated me first remember the word that I said unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they've kept my saying they will keep keep yours also but all things will they do unto you for my name's sake because they know not him that sent me if I had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin kind of helping us understand a little bit why Christ is so reviled now let's continue in this and notice uh as we'll keep reading some of these other places how that he's identifying the B human nature that's unredeemed and their propensity to hate he that hateth me hateth my father also if I had not done among them The Works which none other man did they had not had sin but now they have both seen and hated both me and my father but this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law they hated me without a cause this it would seem to suggest that there could be some basis for hate the law deals with it quite a bit about if a man hates his neighbor if he hates this he hates that and sometimes it's getting down to the root cause as to why one would hate and one why would have this enity with somebody else but in Psalm 694 says they had they that hate me without a cause more than the hairs of my head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are Mighty then I restored that which I took not away incredible statement but he says they hate me without cause in Christ is saying I've come I've preached the word yes it exposed their sins I've come I've done Mighty Works yes it took away uh it exposed their sin but because I've done what the fathers asked me to do they hate me for it he says they're not just in their hatred they're they're they cannot be excused for their hatred they hate me without cause they are my enemies wrongfully they have they have no right to do it as as even the songwriters have exclaimed and says well what what has he done he healed your sick what has he done he raised your debt what has he done he's paid for you the price of your sins he he's not worthy of this punishment he's not worthy of this death they have made themselves an enemy of the Cross wrongfully brother Bram in the sermon discernment of spirit says and you notice Jesus when he came he was loved of the father and then he brings this parallel and father and the father gave Joseph a coat of many colors the rainbow of Covenant and the father God gave his son Jesus the Covenant and then the Jewish brother hated him without a cause they were jealous of Joseph and it was in their jealousy of Joseph that they hated him notice this intense negative emotional response and these other factors if there's some enmity or jealousy some envy and how it works to produce this hatred and this callousness and even to act to throw their little brother into a a pit and to sell him into slavery he says the Jewish brother hated him Christ now without cause he had no reason to hate him he was spiritual and he was God's word made manifest he come to do the will of the father he come to fulfill the scripture I I want you to catch this because we're not put you haven't put yourself maybe in the seat of the scornful and to put yourself in the shoes of these Jews who were who are there looking calling for his crucifixion and you don't put yourself in the seat of those of the world when Jesus says well if they hate you they hated me first we're not putting ourselves as a hater we're putting ourselves as the hated but it it would do us some good to think about how that we sometimes hate and the reasons why we hate and why the world is hating Christ he says they hated him without cause they were his enemies wrongfully it may not be as Sinister as we think it is cuz notice what Jesus what brother brandham says he says he came to do the will of the father he came to fulfill the scripture he came to bring them peace but they misunderstood him and hated him without a cause he came to bring peace but they misunderstood him now that is that ought to be eye openening and I don't want to get into it in great detail this morning of course if the Lord would have me to I certainly will but saying that hate can AR eyes solely on the basis of a misunderstanding an intense negative emotional response to someone or something solely because of a misunderstanding that there can be a strong a ver passionate aversion to something extreme ill will to treat someone as your enemy on the basis of a misunderstanding and therefore with this mis says they hated him without a cause they didn't stop to try to see what he was trying to achieve now this is an anecdote to hate I guess maybe just getting right into it there's no way really to bury the lead or kind of hide the ball here they didn't try to stop they didn't stop to try to see what he's trying to Chief they just judged him because they didn't agree with because that he didn't agree with him and in the face of disagreement and on its face there's a disagreement and instead of trying to understand where he was coming from what he was trying to achieve they just judged him on the surface and on the basis that he disagreed with him and on the basis of disagreement and misunderstanding that was enough to hate that was enough to crucify and Paul says it this way in Galatians chap 4:1 16 he says am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth that's what brother Bram identifies as the reason why Christ became an enemy it's why Jesus says in John 15 how he became an enemy because I gave them no cloak for their sin now I'm their enemy as long as they could excuse themselves as long as they could get away with something they were fine but now I'm their enemy he says am I therefore become your enemy am I become hated the word there could have easily been translated am I therefore hated by you am I H you become hostile you oppose me when he says I'm your enemy it means you hate me you oppose me just because I tell you the truth it seems when you put it in terms of hating Christ we think of the most spiteful honorous hate there is but hate itself is such a nasty thing I don't know if we put it this way when we spoke on Love and Hate actually we looked at it in a little bit different perspective how that Christ is speaking to us if any man come to me and not hate his father and mother that where there's love where there's love there has to be some there has to be some hate as a result of that love but if perfect love now I'm not looking at the The Godly jealousy or perfect a perfect hatred just yet but a perfect love is God's ultimate and and then we say that God is love then Satan can be expressed in terms of hate animosity that acrimony hostility and if that's what God is trying to bring us to a place of perfect love Satan's ultimate would bring you to a place of hate in Matthew chapter 5: 38-48 I'm reading this it's lengthy I think it's worth reading through just to see the full context of what Christ expresses here you''ve heard it that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and we said amen closed her Bibles went home and never forgot it an eye for an eye and a tooth for tooth it says well if somebody takes if someone slaps you slap them back if somebody lies on you you lie on them back it's kind of Tit for Tat an eye for an eye and tooth for tooth uh if they want to escalate conflict I I I'm going to anti up I'm going to I'm going to come hard he says but but I say unto you that you resist not e Vil that where there is someone who is offending and someone that's doing something wrong that when you respond in kind and you respond likewise he's saying you can't if they've given you evil you can't give evil back but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also we spoke many many services a few years ago here on uh borders and boundaries or barriers and boundaries rather did I title it wrong the first time no I think it was barriers and boundaries a and how that there's certain things that we make barriers there's certain things that the word of God wants us to make a boundary and so I just feel like I've got to call out this qualification in studying the scripture in depth we found that turning the other cheek wasn't becoming subservient to someone who's abusing you and doesn't mean as Christians we just have to acues and let people abuse us and treat us toxically a and do all sorts of evil and harmful things to us but to turn the other cheek is to respond in way that declares they're not the master and ruler over you without returning evil and kind says and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go mile go with him Twain this is just so opposite of the human nature and Instinct give to him that asketh the and from him that would borrow of thee turn thou not not thou away ye have heard that hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy and we think to that that makes some sense he says but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you as he says if they persecute you just know that they also persecuted me if they hate you know also that they hated me and it gives us puts us on notice that the world is going to hate me the world is going to persecute me and we might say but he taught me to love one another to love the disciples to love the Believers to love those who who believe in Christ but now he takes it a step further we could say he had already established that you're not to treat those that hate you with hate also he says but love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you in other words don't respond to hate with hate that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth reain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you this is that a real the real Crux of it if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so that's not Republicans it's publicans be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect there's a lot that we can draw from this even say showing that God does not withhold the sun and the rain from the unjust and the evil that God has not even P banished the wicked to where every day is just a day of torment and boils and Sadness and Sorrow and all you have to do is just look out and see the ones who are itching themselves wow there's a sinner right there yeah yeah they're the ones that are just burning as they walk down the streets that's just not the way God has done it and he says that we ought to love our enemies because if you only love those that love you what good is that how is that even real love if you're only kind to those who are kind to you if you only salute the Brethren well how are you better than the publicans and so he says be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and it's saying that this this is perfection to elevate yourself above hate to be able to live above hatred to be able to not let hatred bring you down and the criticism and the and the animosity and all the negativity to be able to live above that he's saying that that's Perfection to not offend with the tongue to not be quick to bite back he's say let us live Above This know that the world is going to hate you but don't hate back know that they're going to persecute you but don't persecute back when brother bradam said bride won't persecute bride it was it was the easiest saying because bride won't persecute any body because it's not it's not inner to do so so Christ does not ask us to fight fire with fire on and he will not allow us to justify our hate because of another's hate it's a broad caution if I could put it that way against the the evils of hate or if it helps you a little bit an evil hate there is a wicked hatred that is not of God brother bam said he let there be hate that he might be love it has to be there has to be hate because of love and there is a hate that is not a compliment to love right but a contradiction there's something sinister about this hatred I've already acknowledged if If any man come to me and hate not his father that there's there's got to be some semblance of it that there's something there's something there about an aversion to something and we'll get to it here in just a moment I so I'm just kind of maybe foreshadowing a little bit we know that there's some aversion that we will'll have that we'll have these strong negative impulses towards something it God is it's not suggesting that we ought to be like murder lest I hate that it's it's we want to be mature about this there's there is something sinister about hatred there's a hatred that we must be aware of to guard against in Hebrews 12:14 Paul says follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord this is quite a statement when he says follow peace with all men it means cultivate a good understanding of others don't just except be ignorant they hated Christ because they did not understand understand him they became enemies to Christ because they disagreed with him so when Paul says follow peace with all men it means cultivate an understanding of other people get to know what another person's going through if if you if they act in a way that's offensive they do something that that would cause you to begin to hate stop for a moment take a deep breath and try to understand them better cultivate a cultivate a good understanding of others with to be without prejudice right to be with without Envy when Paul says follow peace with all men he he does he does not qualify it like we we're not seeking to be enemies don't indulge the passions that lead to Strife follow peace means eagerly pursue after it give attention to it give diligence to it don't always be quick to be adversarial there there you know there's I'll say this there this is uh confession time forgive me congregation it's been so many weeks since my last confession these are my not my sins but these are my weaknesses we're MC's we're contrarians if you told me that was an electric vehicle I'd say well actually it's a battery powered vehicle right you just can't accept that it's an electric vehicle right you got to get you got to dis get really precise and disagree well no actually it's not a blue hue and and just you can't ever accept something for what it is and that sometimes we just have that nature where we're just contrarians well I think this well that's ridiculous you know I really like that well you do that's crazy and there's just you can't ever be at peace with anybody and this is what he's saying follow peace with all men don't be so quick to disagree don't be so quick to complain don't be so quick to be negative but maybe seek to understand and explore maybe you need to learn what electricity is follow peace with all men because there is a enity there's a hatred there's an animosity that we could have that is not of God I want to read several verses in Romans chapter 12 verses 9 to 21 I'll read verse 9 and I'll I'll just draw from a few other places real quick and we'll pick back up in verse 10 do an excellent on time today Ros his a open it's available don't get Negative don't hate Romans 12:9 let love be without dis dissimulation we know that means hypocrisy and in order to not have a hypocritical love he says abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good to have a strong intense hate that which is evil and so if our love is going to be correct if it's going to be sincere if it's going to be without hypocrisy you have to know that which is evil and you have to have an verion to it you have to know that which is good and you need to cling to it and so Paul is saying that there must be some hatred to that which is evil now we' have this I okay I get that some a strong aversion to a passionate aversion extreme ill will towards that which is evil we must have that in order for our love to not be hypocritical we cannot say that we uh love God and also love the world when he says this this is not an admonition or an admonishment to anger this is not encouragement to wrath this is not being able to say well that's wrong so I hate them I I maybe I'm going to get myself in trouble but I I find it so heartbreaking when people identify sin and then Express such venomous hatred towards someone to to express hatred for somebody who gets an abortion hatred for somebody who who is gay and he get such hatred that's not of Christ you've been drawn off sides there's things that are wrong there's things that are not pure there's things that are wicked but God hasn't ask you to become mean mean-spirited and hateful and be vengeful this is not our authorization to Rampage to protest to injure but yet we know that hate is a a consequence it says in Psalms 11914 through the pre through thy precepts I get understanding therefore I hate every false way hatred of evil is a consequence of loving truth but sometimes people just excuse their hatred and they use truth as their excuse It's just hate it's just malice they just made someone their enemy they're not pouring that which is evil because they certainly haven't got even close to good they're just hating they're just resisting not submitting to the lord they're just say they're resisting evil they're just tearing down other kingdoms they're just they they've drawn the a sword against the wickedness in the world today but they're not clinging to Christ Revelations 2: 6 and also verse 15 it says but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate in this great compliment to the church he's saying you hate something that I hate so there is a hatred there is a strong aversion there is some kind of repulsing to sin and these Deeds of the nians he says so hast thou hast thou also them that hold the doctrine nians which thing I hate so he affirms it again that God God has hatred he says Jacob I've love Esau I've hated there's could be some there's a there's a hatred that is a companion and a compliment to love but don't use that as an excuse to hate that which is against love to have that hate which is not pure there's a Godly hatred a hatred that is perfect that is pure that produces righteousness through thy precepts I get understanding as I've understood your nature of as understood your word I hate every false way as it says in Psalms 139: 21 and 22 do not I hate them oh Lord that hate thee and am I not grieved with those that rise up against thee I hate them with perfect hatred I count them mine enemies I know you might think man you were just building a house and now it's just become a house of cards in one scripture but there there is this acknowledgment that where there's an intense passion for Christ there will be a rejection of evil that where there is a through understanding by the word of God there's going to be a strong negative reaction response to evil to every false way he says I hate them with the perfect hatred I count them my enemies well if we could just say this daavid was being honest let thy love be without dissimulation abhor that which is good excuse me aord that which is evil cleave to that which is good verse 10 be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love in our abhorring evil we ought to never become so abhorent and always rejecting and always hating till we can't be kindly affectioned to one another in honor preferring one another not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in hope patient in Tribulation continuing instant in prayer Distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitality drawing now even for the very things that Christ taught bless them which persecute you bless and curse not to bless those that persecute you is to say that you're going to invoke a blessing upon them that you would actually pray for them and he says curse not to bless and curse not do not invoke evil upon on them do not speak of their doom and I know that's going to change our days completely like what are we going to do when we're driving home from work if we can't Doom everybody as we do so but it's just one of these things especially when something happens and I know I'm just speaking in a way that's very plain to us today but what is it kind of our knee-jerk reaction when we've had a negative interaction with somebody in in some sort of service setting or somebody does something to us we're like oh they're going to pay for it they have no idea who I am you know why I'm bride you get that your cars going to explode your your Tesla is going to explode you we all of a sudden start imagine all sorts of crazy things you're going to fall in a sinkhole right and we just think we're going to Doom them we've immediately begin to think to ourselves what kind of crazy horrible things are going to happen to them because they charged me gratuity immediately and and and that's kind of the attitude we get and God is cautioning the word is cautious against that kind of instinct of do you know who I am you treated me wrong you're going to get it but rather seek to bless someone and not just Doom them or condemn them bless them which pers persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep be of the same mind toward mind one toward another mind not high things but but condescend to Men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits recompense to no man evil for evil if somebody's paid you in evil don't pay him back in evil got like when when some of these guys they get a judgment against them and they have a $10,000 judgment so they pay in pennies soaked in oil right they're they want to they want to get back they want revenge he's saying don't recompense evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible and I love the grace with which Paul expresses this if it be possible as much as lith in you live peaceably with all men he acknowledges that there will be some situations where peace is not possible and therefore you're not to engage in Conflict but you're to disengage you don't want to to escalate you got to find a way to get out of it but he said as much as it's possible as much as you are able live peaceably with all men dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place under wrath for it there written vengeance is mine I love how Paul still kind of speaks to our human nature but I want him to get it and he say well just let it it'll come in time vengeance is mine I will repay sayith the Lord don't don't need to avenge yourselves don't get consumed with it don't get eaten up with it therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for do so Thou shalt Heap coals of fire on his head we don't need to be Avengers sorry Star Wars fans we do not need to be Avengers he says but be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good when he says recompense to no man evil for evil and he just run through this list of things and acknowledges where there's hostility there there might be this tendency to engage and to respond and kind he says no is as much as possible live peacefully don't make people your enemies he says and if you feel like they need to have Justice rained out upon them you don't need to one be the one that do it God will look after you if they're hungry feed them if they're thirsty give them something to drink because in doing so it's just going to he more condemnation on because he says be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good amen I hope in the next few Services we can look at hate in a way that helps us to overcome it maybe in the next few Services we'll look at the origin of hate where it begins even how it starts for us some of the things that kind of give rise to it the reasons why we hate and ultimately how to overcome it I going say this as I close I'll invite the musicians to come there are I was I I just feel to say this to kind of help maybe give something to hold on to before we go if I could even use the phrase there are isms that hide our hate right good beliefs because we believe a certain way and it hides our hate we have judgments and opinions that cover up our hatred I read a statement that was so remarkable to me and it was I don't believe it was the founder the history of the clux clan is you know the the second iteration of it in the 1900s when it became very very powerful and and it was sweeping politics gripping States I don't can't remember if it was the founder at that time of that movement or it was one of the grand dragons or whatever they call him who who said I didn't sell and it might have been the in Indiana I didn't sell them on hatred I sold them on americanism and there's a lot of isms we're sold on and it's actually hate it leads us to hate and they don't have to teach us to hate this person don't have to teach us to hate this and don't have to teach us to hate that they just have to sell us on an ism and it begins to take care of itself and I pray to God that we're not allowing ourselves to be gripped by any ism that's right that leads us to hate to where we don't realize it but slowly but surely something is eating us up oh no no no no this isn't hatred this isn't this isn't hatred but in reality it's exactly what it is and there's just been a little here that we've read to you today but I believe the word of God has given us a sharp warning about not being overcome with hate Romans chap 14: 19 let us there therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another when those angels appeared to those Shepherds that night he said we're going to bring you news that'll produce intense gladness peace on Earth good toward men but yet Christ becomes this dividing character he sets a man at variance against his father against his family there's there's this in in this peace that is coming hatred Rises up against [Music] it and in the day and age that we're living in now I could say where is the Peace where is the Peace that Christ promised I read it over and over again that the gospel is rest and I find myself that's what I need more than ever is rest let us therefore follow after things that make for peace things which build up that strengthen and [Music] encourage I can't remember where I think it was a Psalm of Life that we quoted here recently and Henry wodsworth Long Fellow you can't just say his first and last name but you got to say all three but he wrote a poem called Christmas bells it's been turned into it became a Christmas carol turned into a song but he wrote this on Christmas Day 1863 if you can place yourself historically in that time period in the Civil War it's Christmas Day and he hears the bells of the Town Church playing and as he hears these bells he begins to write a song that how the bells are playing this familiar Carol and it's a sound it's heard and it's kind of the a tune that you would recognize but then he begins to write this then from each black a cursed mouth the cannon thundered in the South with the sound the carols drowned of peace on Earth Goodwill to men riding now in this Christmas day of how that here's the bells declaring peace but it's the it's the war it's the conflict it thunders out and it sound drowns out the sounds of the carol singing peace on Earth Good Will to men it was as if an earthquake rent the hearth stones of a continent and made for Lorn the households born of peace on Earth Goodwill to men the very ones that were rooted in this peace the very ones that believed in the gospel now they've been made for Lauren there's been a rending there's been a tearing in the light of this conflict that's divided a nation divided families divided sons and brothers he then in light of it says and in despair I bowed my head and this is what Henry Wadsworth Longfellow says there is no peace on Earth I said for hate is strong and mocks the song of peace on Earth goodwi to men what a what perception what contrast to Bell's ringing maybe in a a snow covered town and and all the trappings of Christmas but yet he recognizes he exists within a world that's torn apart and no matter how Charming he may have been able to make his home no matter how Charming The Village may have been he knew that not too far away War had met people's households War had come to cities doorsteps and states were being ruined and lives are being lost he says oh the belts are playing on Christmas day and it says peace on Earth and goodwi to men but he hangs his head in his own dispair says no there's no peace on Earth where is there peace on Earth because hate is strong and mo the song of peace on Earth Goodwill to men and it wasn't just the Civil War on the doorsteps of the virgins on the doorsteps of the pennsylvanians it wasn't just Those whom D had come to their very cities and towns but long fellow's oldest son Charles had joined the union without his father's blessing and had been severely wounded the month before and if that wasn't enough just before that Henry's wife had died in a tragic accident and here he with his wife recently deceased his son severely wounded because of this war maybe his son leaving without his Blessing maybe begging him to not be a part of it you find him just with the acrimony of war the hostility of the conflict maybe eating up the union eating up the South hatred and animosity on both sides and perhaps perhaps his own hate perhaps it's his own hate for what's happened to his family his wife did it was an accidental fire she dies and maybe with his grief and now his son is running off to war now he's severely wounded and as he sits there and he hangs his head in despair he's not wagging his his his finger at the South he's not just taking issue with the soldiers in the north he says it maybe with his own hate raging in his heart there is no peace on on Earth how can there be peace my son lays dying my wife dies tragically what is this world coming to as he says it I said there is no peace on Earth for hate is strong and mocks the song of peace on Earth Good Will to men but it does not end this poem there he says the bells don't stop in light of everything that's happened and everything that has been despite the death of the tragedy the Warfare and all the acrimony despite the strength of hatred that mocks the song The Bells don't quit he says then P the bells peeled the bells more loud and deep God is not dead nor does he sleep the wrong shall fail the right Prevail with peace on Earth Good Will to men I believe we can find peace in knowing that God made a promise and no matter how work it gets there is light for us there is peace for us no matter how hard the trials may get we can rest in Jesus Christ knowing there will be peace as he sat there that Christmas Day pitting this maybe that's what first struck him is the of the joy and the lightness of Christmas bells and out of his own loss and sorrow and he began to see this great contrast to the things that were in the world he says there is no there is no peace he hatred is way tooo strong hatred is one there's too much animosity there's too much bitterness hatred is one and as he began to yield to it and give himself into hatred and spess and anger and frustration and Vengeance the bells just kept on ringing and as it kept ringing he said no no God is not dead my Avengers is not dead and as long as he is alive the right shall win the right shall Prevail and the wrong will fail there will be peace on Earth Let There Be Good Will to men I challenge you to find the peace that you so desperately crave there's a lot of ways we describe it what we're searching for and what we're longing for and there's a lot of ways that we might talk about our present situation but a lot of times the very thing the very thing you're craving is peace there's only one way to find it and I hope that even by bringing up this Spectre Spectre of hatred you might find that it's hatred that's driving you from the very thing that can give you the peace you need stand with me today
