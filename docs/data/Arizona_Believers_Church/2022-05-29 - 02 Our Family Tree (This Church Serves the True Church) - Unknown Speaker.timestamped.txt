[0:01] My subject this morning um as I
[0:03] mentioned before is we're continuing on
[0:04] part two on our family tree and this
[0:08] service the subtitle is this church
[0:10] serves the true church. This church
[0:14] serves the true church. Last time we
[0:16] spoke on a vision of home and we were
[0:19] kind of taking Genesis to Revelation and
[0:21] tying things back to the beginning, but
[0:23] also to have us to be forward looking
[0:25] about what our the future holds for us,
[0:27] about what God would be calling us to
[0:29] and how that we know uh one day there's
[0:31] going to be an eighth day, a perfect
[0:33] Eden that will be unending. And we see
[0:36] that reflected in the beginning and then
[0:38] come to its climax, the seeds coming to
[0:40] fruit in the end. And we mentioned that
[0:43] in that service, we were wanting to
[0:45] rearticulate what our vision is for the
[0:47] church and the church having grown a
[0:49] little bit and many people being here
[0:52] now who weren't here originally when we
[0:54] begin to express these things at the
[0:56] beginning of 2021. Uh we just felt in
[0:58] our hearts it'd be nice just to kind of
[1:00] reset and go back over some of these
[1:02] things. And God just opened up this
[1:04] subject of our family tree. And um the
[1:07] the tree that I'm using in this graphic
[1:09] is the one that many people believe is
[1:11] the type of tree that Abraham planted in
[1:13] Genesis chapter 21. And so I've just had
[1:16] this thought of a tree in our family
[1:19] tree as a local church. And as we went
[1:21] over the vision last time, we were
[1:24] talking about how our church, our vision
[1:26] as a church is one that must honor God's
[1:29] vision for his family and and God's
[1:32] vision uh for the church of God, not
[1:34] just a vision for this local church. And
[1:36] we're just going to try to make it work
[1:37] as a local church, but we recognize that
[1:39] our vision has to harmonize with God's
[1:41] vision for his family. And if we do
[1:44] that, then we're also going to be
[1:47] supporting the vision that you would
[1:48] have for your family. Okay. So these are
[1:50] how these things would work together.
[1:52] It's not merely that we want to make
[1:53] this church dynamic, but we want to
[1:55] allow the mechanics and dynam dynamics
[1:58] of the Holy Spirit to operate freely to
[2:00] support God's vision for his family and
[2:03] to support your families. And we used a
[2:06] statement where brother Brandon refers
[2:08] to God as an extreme parent. And so he
[2:11] was an extreme parent before there was
[2:12] extreme sports. He was the first
[2:15] extreme. And as an extreme parent, he
[2:17] put everything in order. And this
[2:19] characterization of God as an extreme
[2:20] parent is he made a paradise for his
[2:23] children. And that's the characteristic
[2:25] of an extreme parent. Make a paradise
[2:28] not for yourself but for your children.
[2:31] And I think that's instructive to us as
[2:33] parents. It's certainly instructive to
[2:34] us as a church as we try to create an
[2:37] atmosphere. We don't do it for
[2:38] ourselves, for our own reputation. We
[2:40] don't do it to be self-s serving, but
[2:42] rather we do it for the children and for
[2:44] the family. And I I expressed even in my
[2:48] heart taking these things into
[2:49] consideration and maybe at the at that
[2:51] part of the service last time, I just
[2:54] said, I I want to purpose to be an
[2:55] extreme pastor in order that we might we
[2:58] could become as a church an extreme
[3:00] family. And we should we should labor to
[3:03] make even this church family and this
[3:05] church a paradise. And and that would be
[3:08] something that we would labor to do.
[3:10] Now, just a couple summary things and
[3:12] I'm going to use a scripture in Isaiah
[3:14] 11 and we'll just it'll be kind of
[3:16] connecting back to where we were last
[3:18] time on Christ. But in God's paradise,
[3:20] we saw this scripturally in the
[3:22] beginning and then the end. In God's
[3:23] paradise, Christ is the tree of life.
[3:26] So, in one one sense, I want you to
[3:28] recognize when I say our family tree,
[3:30] I'm speaking as the bride. Our family
[3:33] tree is the bride tree. It is Christ.
[3:36] And we see this things that brother
[3:38] Brandham taught in that. And Paul's
[3:40] saying being rooted and grounded in
[3:41] love. He used that sense of agriculture
[3:44] and architecture. We being rooted. We
[3:46] are described as a family being rooted.
[3:48] So he describes us as trees. And the
[3:50] Bible describes us as trees. In Jeremiah
[3:52] and Psalm, there's many places that a
[3:54] man is described as a tree. Uh and so
[3:56] we're saying we're a family of trees.
[3:59] But not just a family of trees. We're a
[4:01] family of one tree. And we are uh we are
[4:04] a um uh we are as it said before a one
[4:08] tree forest and we were using that
[4:10] example of the po which is a grove they
[4:13] call it a grove of one aspen. So you
[4:16] look at all these uh over 107 acres
[4:18] nearly 107 acres and over 40,000
[4:20] different trees that you would see but
[4:22] yet it's a grove of one h one tree and
[4:26] that then they called a one tree forest
[4:28] and that's the image that we're reusing
[4:30] of the family of God. Now, in Isaiah
[4:34] 11:1, we're going to look at the I want
[4:36] to again re-emphasize the scriptural
[4:38] image of Christ being the tree of which
[4:41] we are all a part of. So, if it's a one
[4:43] tree forest, then it's Christ who's the
[4:46] tree. It's Christ who's the forest, but
[4:47] we're all members of that forest. In
[4:50] Isaiah 11:1, this is where we see a
[4:54] depiction of a family tree. So when we
[4:57] say our family tree, we may think of
[4:59] matriarchs and patriarchs and
[5:00] great-grandparents and this man married
[5:02] this woman, they had these children and
[5:04] they had they married these women and
[5:06] had these children or these men. And you
[5:08] kind of chart this family tree. Well,
[5:10] this is the image that is expressed
[5:12] here, a family tree or the tree being
[5:16] used as a symbol of lineage. It says,
[5:18] "And there shall come forth a rod out of
[5:21] the stem of Jesse." There's going to
[5:23] come forth a branch out of the stump of
[5:25] Jesse, being cut down, chopped down to
[5:27] its root. But there'll be a new chute
[5:28] that comes up, a rod out of the stem of
[5:30] Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of
[5:33] his roots. This is a prophecy of Christ.
[5:37] Christ is the rod. He is the branch that
[5:39] springs forth. And so the Bible is
[5:41] referring to Jesus Christ as a tree. And
[5:44] what remarkable symbolism then that
[5:46] Christ is the tree of life and he is
[5:48] described as a tree and then he's hung
[5:50] on a tree, right? two different trees
[5:53] nailed together, fastened together,
[5:55] united together, atoning for the
[5:57] original sin of man. Here he is, Christ
[5:59] the tree cut downh um a as a symbol or
[6:05] literally cut down as a sacrifice for
[6:06] us. In Zechariah 6:12, again, I'm just
[6:11] using a few scriptures to emphasize
[6:12] Christ as the tree because I'm wanting
[6:14] us to clearly identify ourselves as part
[6:17] of this. says, "And speak unto him,
[6:19] saying, thus speaketh the Lord of hosts,
[6:20] saying, behold the man whose name is the
[6:23] branch." So, there's going to be a man
[6:25] who's called the branch. That's this is
[6:27] a an appellation given to him. He's
[6:29] called the branch. And he shall grow up
[6:31] out of his place, and he shall build the
[6:34] temple of the Lord. And so, this is
[6:36] who's the branch? It is Christ. He's
[6:38] referred to as the branch in other
[6:40] places. It's Christ. and and he's going
[6:42] to build, notice this, the branch, the
[6:44] tree, this new tree is going to build
[6:46] the temple of the Lord. Now, just think
[6:49] of this, and I don't know if I'm just
[6:51] letting my mind kind of work with the
[6:53] symbols that are given to us, but this
[6:56] man is going to be called a tree, and
[6:57] he's going to build the temple of the
[6:59] Lord. It it's this is just me in my mind
[7:01] as I ponder this. Here's all the
[7:03] elements it's going to take to build a
[7:05] building. Christ is the wood. He He is
[7:08] the the elements. He's going to be this
[7:10] is the branch and he's going to build
[7:12] the temple of the Lord. It's it would be
[7:14] like looking at a giant tree and saying
[7:16] this tree is going to build a house. And
[7:19] so he is the branch and he'll grow up in
[7:21] his place and he shall build the temple
[7:22] of the Lord. A lot of things being
[7:24] expressed there. This is one of the most
[7:26] identifiable prophecies of Christ in
[7:28] Isaiah chapter 53. We'll just pull
[7:30] verses 1 and two. Who hath believed I
[7:32] report? And to whom is the arm of the
[7:34] Lord revealed? For he shall grow up
[7:38] before him as a tender plant, and as a
[7:41] root out of a dry ground. He hath no
[7:43] form nor comingless. And when we shall
[7:45] see him, there's no beauty that we
[7:46] should desire him. Who's it talking
[7:48] about? Christ. Christ, the sacrificial
[7:51] lamb. This one who is born of a virgin.
[7:53] He's going to grow up as a tender plant,
[7:55] as a root out of a dry ground. Described
[7:58] in Isaiah, as the the the root, the
[8:00] branch that comes forth out of the stump
[8:02] of Jesse. Here he's And then in
[8:03] Zechariah, he's the branch. He's going
[8:05] to grow up. He's going to build the
[8:07] temple. Now, he's going to grow up as a
[8:08] tender plant, a root out of a dry
[8:10] ground. Jeremiah 25 calls him 23 calls
[8:13] him a righteous branch. This is Christ.
[8:16] This is who this is what he's described
[8:18] at the branch, a righteous branch, a
[8:20] tender plant, a root of a dry ground.
[8:23] So, when it comes in the end in
[8:24] Revelations 22:1 16 and makes a very
[8:27] remarkable paradoxical statement, I am
[8:31] the root and offspring of David. Amen. I
[8:34] am the root. I am that which has come
[8:36] forth from the seed. But I'm not just
[8:39] merely that which has come forth from
[8:40] the seed, but I'm also the fruit in the
[8:43] top of the tree. I am the offspring. I
[8:45] am the I am the fullness of this tree. I
[8:47] am both the root and the offspring of
[8:50] David.
[8:51] The one that says before Abraham was, I
[8:54] am I am the root and the offspring of
[8:56] David. He is the seed of Abraham. He has
[8:59] connected uh through genealogy through
[9:02] Joseph and Mary back to the very kingdom
[9:05] of David and the seed of David. And he
[9:07] comes in in fulfillment of those
[9:09] prophecies. This tender branch, the stem
[9:11] of Jesse, the branch, it is Christ.
[9:14] Amen. And it is that tree that is our
[9:18] family tree. Christ is our family tree.
[9:23] And we as members of the body of Christ
[9:25] are members of this one tree. Again, in
[9:28] type, it's just using the po as a type
[9:30] there in Utah, it is a trees of a one
[9:33] root system.
[9:35] So all these quaking aspens that they
[9:37] see in that forest, they're all part of
[9:39] one root system. So they're all over
[9:42] 40,000 different trees, but they're all
[9:44] genetically identical. So you go and you
[9:47] do a DNA test of this tree and you go do
[9:49] a DNA test of this tree and they'd be
[9:52] exactly the same. The genetic marks are
[9:54] 100% exactly the same. In other words,
[9:55] they are the exact same tree. And that's
[9:58] the beauty of the new birth. If somebody
[10:00] took your spiritual DNA, you know,
[10:02] brother Chris doesn't have any more
[10:04] spiritual DNA than brother Martin. Why?
[10:05] Because it's the new birth by the very
[10:07] exact same elements. And spiritually,
[10:09] we're genetically identified the same,
[10:12] genetically identical. And that's why
[10:14] we're joint airs with Christ.
[10:18] And so, this is the body that we're a
[10:20] part of. Now I have four scriptures here
[10:23] to read just to show this body of Christ
[10:27] and and that we are a part of a and how
[10:29] it connects back to Christ the branch
[10:31] who builds the temple to this tree.
[10:34] Ephesians chapter 1 22 to 23 and hath
[10:37] put all things under his speaking of
[10:39] Christ his feet and gave him to be the
[10:42] head over all things to the church. So
[10:45] he is the head over all things to the
[10:47] church. And this is Paul's description
[10:49] of the church. The church which is his
[10:52] body, the fullness of him that fillth
[10:55] all in all. Now that's another very
[10:57] fascinating statement. So the church is
[11:00] his body. And he's saying the church is
[11:02] the fullness of him. That this is where
[11:04] the fullness of Christ comes into view
[11:06] is through this bride tree. The fullness
[11:08] of him that fleth all in all that fills
[11:10] up the dispensation that finishes the
[11:13] plan. When God told Adam to multiply and
[11:16] replenish the earth, it meant fill it up
[11:17] to what I've ordained. So in a in a pro
[11:20] prophetic way, he's saying, I have so
[11:22] many seeds. I have so many genes. I have
[11:24] so many elect and ordained. Fill it up.
[11:27] And so now the body of Christ will fill
[11:30] fill that up. That which fillth it all
[11:33] all in
[11:34] all. And then in 1 Corinthians chapter
[11:37] 3, so I'd say this, Christ is then and
[11:40] we can turn to 1 Corinthians chapter
[11:41] 3:9. Christ is now depicted as a
[11:45] body. The Christ which is his body and
[11:49] this is the temple of the Lord. His body
[11:51] is the temple of the Lord. And it says
[11:53] in 1 Corinthians chapter 3:9, "For we
[11:55] are laborers together with God." And
[11:57] then he says, "Ye are God's husbandry.
[12:00] Ye are God's building." Again, this is
[12:02] the agriculture and architecture. Both
[12:05] of them, two different types. A and it's
[12:07] just ways to try to express what we
[12:09] actually are. We're not literally a
[12:12] building, but in type we are God's
[12:14] building. You're not literally just a
[12:17] plant, but in type you are a plant.
[12:19] These are just terminologies that we use
[12:21] so we can relate to what we are in God
[12:23] and what we've become by his grace. He
[12:26] says, "You are God's husbandry. This is
[12:28] God's vineyard. You are his planting.
[12:30] You are his garden." So the tree, you
[12:34] are God's husbandry. You are his
[12:35] vineyard. But this is the body which God
[12:38] has made.
[12:39] This is the tree is his body. And then
[12:42] in verse 16 of the same chapter, know
[12:45] you not that ye are the temple of God,
[12:48] God's husbandry, God's building. So now
[12:50] he says, ye are the temple of God, and
[12:52] that the spirit of God dwelleth in you.
[12:54] If any man defile the temple of God, him
[12:58] shall God destroy. For the temple of God
[13:00] is holy, which temple ye are. Think of
[13:03] that. You are the temple of God.
[13:07] And in and in this way it it it it poses
[13:10] the individual as being that that
[13:14] sanctified precious element that gathers
[13:16] into the house of God.
[13:19] Do you know why the presence of God
[13:20] comes into the sanctuary a and we honor
[13:23] it and we reverence this temple and we
[13:25] reverence this tabernacle and we try to
[13:26] show respect to it because God's
[13:28] presence comes here. But why does God's
[13:30] presence come here? You bring it. Amen.
[13:34] It's where two or three are gathered
[13:36] together and in my name there I'll be in
[13:37] our midst. So, you know what? We we
[13:39] couldn't just spray paint the name of
[13:41] Jesus Christ on this wall and all of a
[13:42] sudden the presence of God is just going
[13:44] to come. We couldn't put a gigantic
[13:46] banner over this church saying the name
[13:48] of Jesus Christ. We couldn't call this
[13:49] the church of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[13:51] just by name all of a sudden his
[13:53] presence would be here. But his presence
[13:55] comes because you come
[13:58] and because you are the temple of the
[14:00] Holy Ghost. It's saying it so plainly
[14:01] here. We ye are the temple of God. Which
[14:05] temple ye are? You are the dwelling
[14:07] place of Christ. And that's what makes a
[14:10] place like this holy. Amen. Is because
[14:13] we come with one mind and one accord to
[14:15] gather in this place which temple you
[14:17] are. And remember Christ says upon this
[14:19] rock I will build my church. It's the
[14:23] only place that Christ and I think he's
[14:26] very explicit though some may could
[14:27] wrestle with his terminology say well
[14:29] it's an allegory. it's in type or he's
[14:31] referring to this, referring to that.
[14:32] But Christ says, "Upon this rock, I will
[14:35] build my church." And it's just that one
[14:37] little seed that Paul takes and brings
[14:39] into a full tree in the New Testament.
[14:42] Outside of that statement of Jesus, you
[14:44] you you wouldn't know of my church or
[14:46] his church or his body. But Paul is
[14:48] taking this revelation and this is the
[14:50] church, his body, God's husbandry, the
[14:53] temple which ye are. Amen.
[14:57] Now in 1 Corinthians 12
[15:00] 12-4 it it
[15:04] says for as the body is one and hath
[15:07] many members and all the members of that
[15:10] one body being me being many are one
[15:13] body so also is Christ. So as the
[15:16] natural body is one body but many
[15:18] members. So if if you want to know what
[15:20] you're talking about just do this. Just
[15:21] kind of wiggle your fingers in front of
[15:22] your face right like this. No you don't
[15:24] want to do you don't want to wiggle your
[15:25] fingers. Okay. Well, I'll remember
[15:28] that. Uh and and so like, oh yeah, I
[15:32] have a left hand. I have a right hand. I
[15:33] have all these different members, but
[15:34] it's one body. And Paul amplifies that
[15:37] to a great degree. And he said, the same
[15:38] way with Christ, there's only one
[15:40] Christ. There's only one body, and
[15:43] there's only one church,
[15:46] right? I know. I know Christian churches
[15:49] don't like to think that there's only
[15:50] one church, but there is only one
[15:52] church, and it's his body. It's Christ.
[15:54] It's it's not a physical thing. It's a
[15:56] spiritual thing. There's one body,
[15:58] there's one Lord,
[16:00] right? There's only one God. There's
[16:02] only one church and it's the Christ
[16:05] Church of Christ. It's God's building.
[16:06] It's God's body. And now he's saying we
[16:08] are members of this. He says, "For by
[16:11] one spirit." This is a very key phrase
[16:13] here, I think, that we do not want to
[16:14] lose sight of. For by one spirit, we're
[16:16] all baptized into one body. Not by
[16:19] shaking hands, not by joining the role.
[16:22] Amen. You're not even you do not become
[16:24] a member of this body by giving tithes
[16:27] and offerings and regular church
[16:28] attendance,
[16:30] right? That'll make you a member of a
[16:33] local church, give you the all the
[16:35] rights and privileges of voting and
[16:37] different things as we see in the word
[16:38] of God. But just by doing that doesn't
[16:40] make you a member of this body. When I
[16:43] say this body, the one spoken of here in
[16:44] 1 Corinthians 12, he says, "For by one
[16:47] spirit, we're all baptized into one
[16:48] body." You've got to be born into this
[16:51] family. You've got to come up from that
[16:53] one root. That life has to shoot up. You
[16:56] have to be a chute off of that that root
[16:58] and and then and and become a part of
[17:00] that one tree system. For by one spirit,
[17:02] we're all baptized in one body. Notice
[17:04] whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
[17:06] we be bond or free and have been all
[17:09] made to drink into one spirit. Now, he's
[17:12] using a he's using a a symbolic
[17:15] language. It's things that ties into
[17:16] even physical ordinances. We're made to
[17:19] drink into one spirit. For the body is
[17:21] not one member but many.
[17:24] The body is one but it has many members.
[17:28] Amen. Brother Bram says in question and
[17:30] answers part one he says the body in
[17:32] 1964 the body has grown just like a tree
[17:35] till it's coming to the head. So here's
[17:38] the here's the image. The body growing
[17:40] as a tree coming to the head coming to
[17:42] the fullness back to the fruit the seed
[17:45] the original seed again. The body has
[17:47] grown just like a tree till it's coming
[17:48] to the head. So here's Christ which we
[17:52] are a member of. We are part of it's his
[17:53] body. It's symbolized as a tree. Now in
[17:56] John chapter 15 verse
[17:59] five. Are we smiling this morning? It's
[18:02] always wonderful to preach to people who
[18:04] look like they want to be
[18:05] here. And I can say that is one thing I
[18:08] could say about our church is you're all
[18:10] very close, right? So I can see your
[18:12] faces and generally you all look like
[18:14] you want to be here. Amen. Amen. And
[18:16] hopefully it's the same when we go
[18:17] another 30 minutes and we don't we're
[18:19] not wearing you out like you've gone a
[18:21] lot longer than my Netflix show I watch.
[18:23] So I'm about to check out here. But John
[18:26] chapter 15 verse 5, Jesus himself is
[18:29] saying this and I know I'm skipping
[18:30] ahead a little bit. So just uh focus uh
[18:33] you might be thinking, "Oh, you're
[18:34] missing you're missing the real gold
[18:35] here in verse one." Well, I'll come back
[18:37] to it. In John 15:5, he says, "I am the
[18:40] vine." Yes, here's Christ the vine. He's
[18:43] the He is the This is a a plant. This is
[18:45] a growing up. This is him using language
[18:49] that is going to catch the attention of
[18:51] a Jew because their prophecies of
[18:53] Israel, there was prophecies of Israel
[18:54] being the vine. Prophecies of Israel
[18:57] being a planting. And now he's saying,
[18:58] "I'm the vine." And to a Jew, this is
[19:00] like,
[19:03] "Oh, no. Uh-uh. No, he didn't just say
[19:04] that because now he's he's he's taking
[19:08] credit for prophecy. This is the
[19:10] fulfillment of this prophecy." And it
[19:11] really kind of rubs that their theology
[19:13] the wrong way. I am the vine. And then
[19:15] in the most beautiful
[19:18] way, he he completely makes available to
[19:21] them to become a part of this
[19:22] fulfillment. Ye are the branches. I am
[19:25] the vine. Ye are the branches. He that
[19:27] abideth in me and I in him, the same
[19:29] bringeth forth much fruit. For without
[19:31] me, ye can do nothing. Oh, it's so
[19:35] beautiful the dependency that you would
[19:37] have upon this root system. He's the
[19:39] vine. I'm the branches. The vine
[19:41] furnishes energy to the branches.
[19:43] Without the vine and his energy, I
[19:45] cannot be fruitful. Without me, ye can
[19:48] do nothing. I am the vine. If you look
[19:51] up what that means in the in the Greek
[19:54] lexicon, so if you do it in some system
[19:56] where you could click on it, if you look
[19:57] it up in Strongs and you want to know
[19:58] what vine means, it just says
[20:01] vine. But branches, it means a vine
[20:04] chute, a sprouting, something that
[20:07] sprouts from the vine. a vine shoot or
[20:09] vine sprout. And so the sprouting what
[20:11] it expresses is I am the vine. You are
[20:14] that which sprouts off from the vine as
[20:16] a further growth of the vine. You're
[20:19] that which branches off from the vine as
[20:21] a further expression of the life of a
[20:24] vine. So you can look at a vine and say
[20:26] that's a vine. Yep, I see the vine. But
[20:28] then it sprouts off into a branch and it
[20:30] bears a leaf and you go that's the type
[20:32] of vine that it is. You know it by its
[20:34] branches because it's the branches that
[20:36] bear the fruit. Amen. It's the those
[20:40] branches that are going to then uh
[20:42] flower, going to bring forth the leaf.
[20:44] Now, what what you need to catch in this
[20:46] is I am the vine. You are the sprout off
[20:49] the vine. Exact same material.
[20:54] Exact same material. Within our bodies,
[20:55] there's ways that they take um they
[20:57] could take samples to get our DNA and
[21:00] they can pretty much take it from
[21:02] different parts of the body, right? It's
[21:04] not like, well, we we took a sample, a
[21:06] piece of skin um off his heel and it's
[21:08] this DNA, but we just we don't know
[21:10] really it's we just know it's a heel. We
[21:13] don't know what body it belongs to. No,
[21:15] no matter where you get this the sample
[21:17] from, it's going to declare this person.
[21:20] This marker. So, it's the same material,
[21:23] same life, same tree. So, you wouldn't
[21:26] say, well, you have the vine and you
[21:28] have the branches. The vine exists over
[21:29] here, the branches exist over there.
[21:31] He's just describing to you the
[21:32] beautiful articulation of nature where
[21:34] you have a vine that's the backbone the
[21:36] furnishing of the life and then it goes
[21:38] out into the branches which flower which
[21:40] fruit which leaf and we consider that's
[21:43] one plant that's a tender plant that's
[21:45] one tree now there's a a beautiful
[21:49] connection back to the body of
[21:52] Christ and a connection to Christ and I
[21:54] think it's even I believe it's even
[21:56] deliberate when he says I am the vine we
[21:58] know that there's grapes that come from
[21:59] the vine there's a way that You can look
[22:01] at the vine as being even symbolic of of
[22:04] the wine and the grapes that would come
[22:06] forth from the wine. He says, "And ye
[22:07] are the branches, the vine and branches
[22:10] and branches." The klema, the word there
[22:12] in the Greek comes from clao, which
[22:14] means to break. So they just they've
[22:17] basically taken this word to break and
[22:18] it's become branches clao conjugated to
[22:21] kma. And it's the same word that's used
[22:24] of breaking of bread and communion.
[22:27] And this stood out to me so much that I
[22:29] am the vine, ye are the branches. And
[22:32] it's here in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 16
[22:35] and 17. He says, "The cup of blessing
[22:37] which we bless is not the comm is is it
[22:39] not the communion of the blood of
[22:41] Christ? The bread which we break, is it
[22:44] not the communion of the body of
[22:46] Christ?" So the cup is symbolically even
[22:49] in the communion uh at the communion
[22:50] table is the wine the grapes of the
[22:52] vine. Now he says, "Is not the bread
[22:54] which we break?" There's that
[22:57] claw from which we get branches. He says
[22:59] this bread which we break. Is it not the
[23:01] communion of the body of Christ? For we
[23:04] being many are one bread.
[23:08] What is it? He says we are one body
[23:10] being many. We being many are one bread.
[23:13] What did Jesus say? This is my body
[23:14] which is broken.
[23:17] So it's become this is my body which is
[23:20] broken which is cla to break to cause to
[23:23] spread into many branches. This is my
[23:26] body which is broken into clea into
[23:29] branches. It's become branches. A vine
[23:33] breaks off
[23:35] into a branch. A vine a tree breaks off
[23:37] into a lamb. This is exactly what's
[23:39] being expressed here. Says this is the
[23:41] bread which we break. Is it not the
[23:43] communion of the body of Christ? For we
[23:45] being many are one bread and one body.
[23:48] For all are partakers of that one bread.
[23:52] Amen. And he's not just talking about
[23:54] the loaf, right, in communion. He's
[23:57] actually not even really spec
[23:58] specifically referring to communion
[24:00] bread. The communion bread is just a
[24:02] type of this, but he's talking about
[24:03] Christ, the word. That's the bread that
[24:05] we're feeding on. We're all made
[24:08] partakers of that one bread. And by us
[24:10] partaking of that one bread, we are then
[24:13] we are then symbolized, we're partaking
[24:15] of the same life, feeding on the same
[24:17] substance.
[24:18] And what is it causing us to do? to come
[24:20] together and unite together as one body.
[24:24] It's that one bread that allows us
[24:26] because it's by that one bread, by the
[24:28] word of God, that incorruptible seed
[24:30] that we hear jointly uh those who've
[24:33] been born again by one spirit, baptized
[24:35] in the body of Christ, we are all united
[24:37] in our souls by the word. Amen. But then
[24:41] we have we have the the body and the
[24:43] spirit and and and those things it comes
[24:46] to the way we look and where that body
[24:49] lives and and how we talk, the languages
[24:51] we use, our past experiences, the way we
[24:53] think and perceive things. And how is it
[24:55] that we're ever going to have
[24:57] unity when we're so different in body
[25:00] and spirit? How is it we have unity
[25:01] except by feeding on the same thing? We
[25:05] begin to connect together and harmonize
[25:07] despite differences. And we realize,
[25:09] wow, you must you think that way and I
[25:11] think this way, but in the scheme of
[25:12] things, that's nothing in terms of what
[25:15] we agree on in the word of God. That
[25:17] nothing like your attitude towards this.
[25:19] I see it a little bit differently. But
[25:21] our commonality in the word of God, as
[25:23] we let that have preeminence, as we feed
[25:25] on the unfailing body, word of the son
[25:27] of man, as we are feasting on this one
[25:30] bread, which is the message of the hour,
[25:33] that's how we become one body in
[25:35] practice and in reality. Yeah. And I am
[25:38] the vine and ye are the branches. You
[25:40] are the broken part of that. That part
[25:42] that branches off the body, the one
[25:45] bread. Amen. And as Jesus says in John
[25:48] chapter 6 verse 35, I am the bread of
[25:50] life.
[25:52] He that cometh to me shall never hunger,
[25:54] and he that believeth on me shall never
[25:55] thirst. So Christ is the bread of life.
[26:00] This is this is the bread which we feed
[26:02] on. He's the bread that came down out of
[26:05] heaven. Amen. And you'll find that uh if
[26:07] you just were deliberate about it to
[26:10] just every time Jesus speaks, ask
[26:13] yourself, how would this rub a Jew the
[26:14] wrong
[26:15] way? And you find that he's often using
[26:18] phrases and using a language that to a
[26:20] Jew, they're like, really?
[26:23] Really? It's almost as if he's just
[26:25] trying to trigger them.
[26:28] He's not using any political
[26:29] correctness, but I am the bread of life
[26:32] that came down out of heaven. And a lot
[26:33] of people could say, I think he's
[26:35] talking about the bread that came down
[26:38] in the wilderness. So Jesus says, "Your
[26:39] fathers ate man in the wilderness and
[26:41] every single one of them are dead."
[26:42] Like, yep, that's exactly what he was
[26:43] talking about. There's no ambiguity now
[26:45] because he's trying to show them this is
[26:47] me. This is my fulfillment. He couldn't
[26:49] kind of dance around it. Don't want to
[26:51] offend anybody. He had this is the word.
[26:53] This is what he fulfilled. I am the
[26:56] bread of life. That's the bread that
[26:57] you're partaking of. And that's the one
[27:00] body that you're a part of. Amen. Now,
[27:03] in God's only provided place of worship,
[27:05] you'll find that there's certainly a lot
[27:07] in these sermons that Brother preaches
[27:09] on this exact subject.
[27:11] So much in there along these lines, but
[27:14] he's he's picking up what we just read
[27:16] in 1 Corinthians 12. But by one spirit,
[27:18] we are all baptized into one body. And
[27:22] that body is a family, the family of
[27:25] God. That body is a family, the family
[27:29] of God. And he
[27:31] says, "And that's the house of God." And
[27:34] the house of God is the name of Jesus
[27:37] Christ.
[27:38] Now again, you have to be thinking in
[27:40] this literal but yet spiritual sense.
[27:44] When sometimes there's a way that we say
[27:45] spiritual, we mean it's not literal. No,
[27:47] the things that are spiritual and
[27:49] eternal are more real than what we're
[27:50] seeing right now. So he says, "And that
[27:53] body is a family, the family of God. And
[27:55] that's the house of God. And the house
[27:56] of God is the name of Jesus Christ. The
[27:59] name of the Lord is a mighty tower. The
[28:00] righteous run into it and are safe. Now,
[28:03] how can you come how are you going to
[28:04] come in by a title? He said, how is your
[28:09] check going to be received by saying
[28:10] paid to the order of reverend, doctor,
[28:12] minister? You might be a reverend,
[28:14] doctor, minister, but the name of the
[28:16] Lord is Jesus Christ. I've chosen to put
[28:19] my name at the door of the house of my
[28:22] worship. For my family will be gathered
[28:25] in there under the blood. And he brings
[28:27] it to the type in Exodus like it was in
[28:29] Egypt. Anything outside died. And in
[28:32] there, in this place where he's put his
[28:34] name, where the families gathered under
[28:36] the blood, the house of God with the
[28:37] name of Jesus Christ. In there, there's
[28:40] no leaven bread. There's no
[28:42] denominational mixture in it anywhere.
[28:45] My house, my children, born of my genes.
[28:49] Amen. He says, "Amen. Glory to God." I
[28:51] say, "Amen. Glory to God. My children
[28:54] born to my genes." The body is a family.
[28:56] The family of God. He's saying that's he
[28:58] says my genes are in them. I put my word
[29:01] in them. I'll write up them upon the
[29:04] tables of their heart. That's my family.
[29:07] The family of the body of Jesus Christ.
[29:10] The family.
[29:12] It's this is the perfect type. This is
[29:14] not just this is the perfect
[29:15] representation of family. If I could say
[29:18] this and it's something I I can deeply
[29:20] recall that something in my my brother
[29:23] David, my younger brother David, that
[29:25] something really struck him early on in
[29:27] his Christian experience of the type of
[29:29] man to wife and husband and wife and
[29:32] just how true that was between Christ
[29:34] and his bride. And and it it so shook
[29:37] him and and I just can even now still
[29:40] vividly remember how much that stayed
[29:42] with them that Christ and his bride,
[29:44] it's husband and wife. And then what the
[29:47] marriages of today are just a type of
[29:48] what that is. We could say well well
[29:52] this is a type you know that's a type of
[29:54] this but but this is that's the perfect
[29:57] that's the fullest. When he says you are
[29:58] the family of God that's the perfect
[30:00] family. Our families here ought to
[30:03] strive to reflect that family. Uh the
[30:06] the the house of God is the perfect
[30:08] home. Our our homes and families ought
[30:10] to strive to reflect that perfect home.
[30:13] God is the extreme parent. He's the
[30:15] original parent. He's the source of all
[30:16] parenthood. We should strive as parents
[30:18] to reflect that parent. Amen. I kind of
[30:21] turn it around and say, "Well, God's
[30:22] just like me. You'll run your children
[30:24] off."
[30:26] Because sometimes that's the reason why
[30:27] our children have the hardest time
[30:29] coming to God because they know you love
[30:31] them,
[30:33] and then they hear that God loves them.
[30:35] And so, they expect God to treat them
[30:37] just like you've treated them. And let's
[30:39] just all admit, we haven't always
[30:40] treated them perfectly.
[30:43] We haven't always kept our word. We
[30:44] haven't always used a tender hand when
[30:46] we ought to. We haven't always corrected
[30:48] when we should. And it it can be the
[30:50] hardest thing for them to come to God.
[30:52] Is just the inconsistent reflection of
[30:54] love that we show. I didn't mean to
[30:56] bring the house down there with that.
[30:58] And everybody's just like I could just
[31:01] hear
[31:01] the hear the power power down. Someone
[31:05] blow a transformer. What just happened?
[31:07] Like well that deescalated quickly.
[31:10] So he says, "My house, my children, my
[31:12] genes, that's my family. The family of
[31:14] the body of Jesus Christ. The family and
[31:16] this door you'll come in. Not Methodist,
[31:19] Baptist, or Pentecostal, but in the door
[31:21] where I put my name." Now, I'm not
[31:25] trying to be
[31:26] controversial, but could have he said
[31:28] the message, too,
[31:30] right? Could have he said it because you
[31:31] say well Pentecostal is not a dirty word
[31:33] but it's a word that's used for to refer
[31:35] to an organization and the message will
[31:38] never denominate but people can use the
[31:40] appellation and the name the message
[31:43] with a denominational conception
[31:45] that if you believe the message you have
[31:47] the Holy Ghost if you're in the message
[31:49] you're saved and there's a way that we
[31:50] can have these constructs about the
[31:52] message that is really the same way of
[31:54] thinking in denomination so we need to
[31:57] be careful because he says where I put
[31:58] my name it ain't Methodist God's name
[32:00] ain't Methodist. God's name ain't
[32:02] Pentecostal. God's name ain't Brandham.
[32:04] I mean Baptist. God's name ain't
[32:06] Catholic.
[32:08] He says, "Stay out of the doors." Then
[32:11] in other words, if it has that kind of
[32:13] name, if it has that kind of
[32:15] organization, if it has that kind of
[32:16] denominational representation, what do
[32:19] they claim to be? They claim to be the
[32:22] church. They claim to be the body of
[32:24] Christ. and they have changed the word
[32:27] of God to fit the agenda of their
[32:30] particular denomination and
[32:31] organization.
[32:33] Just ask them, well, what does the Bible
[32:34] say about this? And immediately they
[32:36] become experts and homalytics and
[32:38] exodists and everything else and say,
[32:39] well actually that wasn't in the
[32:41] original and actually if you use this
[32:42] language and really we just don't want
[32:44] to talk about it, right? All of a sudden
[32:48] the word of God changes. Then you you
[32:50] realize that in that case it's she said
[32:52] she said and and they better be they
[32:55] better hope that they're right. Had a
[32:57] conversation with the friend in law
[32:58] school who was uh at the time he was not
[33:01] a Christian and we began to become uh
[33:05] friends and and had fellowship together
[33:07] and he would always ask me how's your
[33:09] walk? You know he'd kind of be a little
[33:10] bit sarcastic and isn't that what you
[33:12] guys call it? Walk and uh come to find
[33:15] out his wife was a Christian and really
[33:16] loved the Lord. Uh but he said made a
[33:19] comment to me one time and he said the
[33:21] thing he said he said the thing is that
[33:23] one of the problems I have is you
[33:25] Christians think that your God's the
[33:27] only
[33:28] God. And I said well I said I guess you
[33:32] don't have to put it that way. I'll say
[33:35] um I believe that the God of the Bible
[33:38] is the one true God. And I'm not saying
[33:40] that their gods aren't true. The only
[33:42] question that remains is whether their
[33:43] God can save them from mine.
[33:47] And so there just let your faith right
[33:49] rest where it is. You believe your God's
[33:51] right. That's wonderful. That's fine.
[33:52] But my God said he's going to destroy
[33:54] your God. My God said that all those
[33:55] that don't believe in him are going to
[33:56] be destroyed. So the question remains
[33:58] whether or not your the gospel of your
[34:00] God provides salvation from my God. It's
[34:04] a question of whether or not your
[34:05] reality, your supernatural, your divine,
[34:07] your deity, can he save you from the
[34:10] wrath of my God? Or do you think your
[34:12] God's the only true God and mine's not
[34:14] real?
[34:16] Well said. He might have he didn't
[34:17] couldn't just say, "Well, you're a
[34:18] lawyer." Because well, we're both
[34:19] training to be lawyers. You can't use
[34:20] that. You can't use that on me. And I'm
[34:23] happy to say that today he's a
[34:25] professing Christian.
[34:27] Hallelujah. In John 15:E1, then let's
[34:30] come back to this um burying the lead a
[34:33] little bit how he says, "I am the vine,
[34:35] you're the branches." He said it even
[34:37] more forcefully and again in a way to
[34:40] aggravate the Jews. I am the true vine.
[34:42] Yeah. In other words, they say we are
[34:45] the br vine. We are the true vine. This
[34:47] is prophesied of our prophets. Israel is
[34:49] the vine. And now he says, but but I'm
[34:51] the true vine. You can be a vine, but
[34:53] I'm the true vine. And my father, which
[34:56] he said was God, is the husbandman.
[34:59] What a statement. I am
[35:02] the father is the husbandman. He is the
[35:05] one that dresses and keeps the vine.
[35:09] This is the true vine which you are a
[35:10] branch of.
[35:12] He doesn't say, "I am the true vine with
[35:14] branches." May you be a vine with
[35:17] branches. No, he says, "I am the vine,
[35:19] ye of the branches." God is the dresser
[35:21] of this true vine which will have those
[35:24] that are broken branches that come off
[35:26] of this one body, this one bread.
[35:28] There's going to be those and God is the
[35:30] dresser of that vineyard. When he comes
[35:32] later, a couple chapters later, and he
[35:33] begins to pray, let them be one. What?
[35:36] It's to be part of that one vine. I am
[35:38] the true vine. Brother Benham writes
[35:40] this in the church age book. He's
[35:41] quoting John 15:1 he says I 155 I am the
[35:45] vine the branches. He says he is the
[35:47] main vine that which comes out of the
[35:50] original root from the original seed
[35:52] that has the life in it. Spoken words
[35:54] the original seed from that original
[35:55] seed comes this root which is Christ the
[35:58] branch. So there's not any other
[35:59] branches that come from this. He is the
[36:01] one branch that comes off. Now the vine
[36:04] does not bear fruit. It is the branches
[36:06] that do that. Amen. So we're seeing this
[36:09] bride tree, this perfect representation
[36:11] of Christ and this singularity and this
[36:13] oneness and this unity that we share. So
[36:15] he is the true vine. You are a part of
[36:18] that true vine. Amen. We catch that. Now
[36:20] I'm going to read a few statements here
[36:21] and I I haven't provided these in the
[36:23] slides but so I want you to listen here
[36:26] of the connection between the true vine
[36:28] and the true church because I'm wanting
[36:30] to use a language about the true church.
[36:31] I want you to associate the vine with
[36:32] the true church. There is a true church
[36:34] brother says and a false church. There
[36:36] is a true vine and a false vine. So true
[36:38] church is true vine. He says in another
[36:41] place and he's quoting from the book of
[36:42] revelation uh revelations 3 we find the
[36:45] true vine true spirit true church people
[36:48] exalted to the very throne of god with
[36:50] the highest compliment ever paid to a
[36:52] humble steadfast spiritual group. This
[36:55] is where this is where it collects up
[36:57] the true vine which is the true church.
[37:00] Now, this is where there's a little bit
[37:01] of a transition into what our title was,
[37:04] our subtitle was. This church, local
[37:07] church, Arizona believers church serves
[37:08] the true church.
[37:11] There is a true church which all are
[37:13] members
[37:14] of that there's a there's a true church
[37:16] with if I can say there's a true church
[37:18] which all members of the body of Christ
[37:20] are part of. So, the true church is the
[37:22] body of Christ. It is the vine. It is
[37:26] that tree. So in that body there are
[37:29] members. In that vine there are
[37:31] branches. That's the true church. That's
[37:33] the same way we could refer to those two
[37:35] different things. Temples of the one
[37:37] tabernacle Christ. We could say branches
[37:40] of the one vine. Members of the one
[37:42] body. So if you've been baptized by one
[37:44] spirit then that's the family of God.
[37:46] Those are my children born of my genes.
[37:48] That's my family. The family of the body
[37:51] of Jesus Christ. He says the family.
[37:53] That's the true church.
[37:55] And this is the family tree. When I say
[37:57] what I want you to think of the family
[38:00] tree is Christ and and and you are a
[38:04] branch of that. You are a part of that
[38:05] tree genetically
[38:07] identical. This is the family tree. But
[38:11] this is where I know that you'll have to
[38:12] stay real close to what I'm trying to
[38:14] say because it's a delicate balance I
[38:15] want to bring. But this is distinctly
[38:18] different from this local church,
[38:20] Arizona believers church, which I could
[38:22] even say is our family tree. Right? So
[38:26] there's the family tree and something we
[38:28] could say as believers around the world,
[38:30] members of the body of Christ. Say this
[38:32] is our family tree. We are all members
[38:34] of the body of Jesus Christ. But then we
[38:37] recognize there's another reflection or
[38:40] manifestation of a body. And it's
[38:42] referred to as a church, a local church
[38:45] or this church, which can also be and I
[38:47] think ought to be reflective of that
[38:49] family tree ought to be a family tree
[38:52] itself. Sure, desired to be. Brother
[38:55] Brand makes the statement, but
[38:56] Christian, if you call yourself
[38:57] Christian, he says Christian is not a
[38:58] church that you belong to. You say, I'm
[39:01] a Christian. Well, why are you a
[39:02] Christian? I go to a Christian church.
[39:03] I'm a Protestant. Why? Because I go to a
[39:05] church that protested the Catholic
[39:07] Church. I These are the these are you
[39:09] could say this is what you are based
[39:10] upon where you go. But he says a
[39:12] Christian is not a church you belong to.
[39:14] It is an experience that you have had of
[39:16] being born into the family of God.
[39:21] So you can have a Christian church. But
[39:23] to be a Christian, you're born into a
[39:25] family. So there is a family of God.
[39:29] There is a true vine, there is a true
[39:32] church, and then there are churches.
[39:35] And this is a distinction that's
[39:36] sometimes missed because we conflate the
[39:38] body of Christ to our own local church.
[39:41] Right. And if we're not careful, what we
[39:43] do is we treat we treat this church as
[39:47] the body of Christ and then things can
[39:50] just start getting a little bit out of
[39:51] balance, right? Like this is the body of
[39:54] Christ. But the more proper view is all
[39:57] the you you want I look at every member
[39:59] who's here, every person that's here
[40:01] today, I look at you as members of the
[40:03] body of Christ. Not just not just
[40:06] members of a church. And this is the
[40:08] body of Christ. But this is reflective
[40:11] and symbolic of the true church.
[40:15] Because there is a difference, but
[40:17] there's also a connection.
[40:19] There is a difference, but there's also
[40:21] connection. And this church serves
[40:24] something greater than itself.
[40:27] This church does not exist. This church
[40:29] does not exist to serve itself.
[40:32] If I could say this even uh to the
[40:34] believers here uh uh who had been with
[40:36] brother Patterson for so long and some
[40:38] had been with him for decades a and
[40:41] pastored for so long the vision and goal
[40:43] of brother Patterson as he led that
[40:45] flock cornerstone Christian Tabernacle
[40:48] uh and and led them it didn't serve
[40:50] itself it served the body of Christ. So
[40:54] even when he feels led as a pastor to
[40:56] step down and to step away, the body of
[40:58] Christ doesn't discontinue. But what his
[41:01] the legacy of that church lives on in
[41:04] the hearts of these believers who are a
[41:06] part of something greater than just the
[41:08] local church. Why? Because another
[41:11] Sunday comes around and guess what?
[41:12] They're still in church.
[41:17] Because that church served a greater
[41:19] purpose than itself.
[41:21] Because if it only served itself, there
[41:23] would have been it would have been there
[41:24] would have been this uh uh it would have
[41:26] been it's necessary for this alone to
[41:28] continue. But what's necessary is that
[41:30] the believers are fed and continue.
[41:33] So I wish brother Chris Kavanagh could
[41:36] have been here this morning. His wife is
[41:38] out sick, but he had made a statement to
[41:40] me um a couple weeks ago that really
[41:42] caught my attention because I'd been
[41:44] pondering on some things and I'd even
[41:46] mentioned some things in a service. and
[41:48] he said, "I really wish you would
[41:50] preach on a subject that I had spoken on
[41:53] at a ministers meeting." And I thought,
[41:55] "Wow." Uh, it really brought it really
[41:57] focused into view to me. And so, I'm
[42:00] going to take a few things that I've I
[42:02] think we've mentioned these things to
[42:03] you before, but I want to go through
[42:04] these very slowly with you. Maybe not
[42:06] slowly. I don't want to put myself in a
[42:08] box, but I I want to go through these
[42:10] things with you as just a quick look at
[42:12] the sermon, the five definite
[42:15] identifications of the true church of
[42:17] the living God. You could go ahead and
[42:18] put that up there. The five definite
[42:21] these this is brother Brandham's title.
[42:22] So every each one of these words in this
[42:24] top he preached it 1960 September 11th.
[42:26] So if you want to remember 911 1960 uh
[42:29] he preached the five definite
[42:32] identifications of the true church of
[42:34] the living God. It's not five suggested
[42:38] uh characteristics of a church of a god
[42:42] but he's very deliberate the five
[42:44] definite identifications of the true
[42:46] church of the living God. In other
[42:48] words, this is just me maybe uh using
[42:50] his language and kind of taking some
[42:51] proddding that these are definitely
[42:54] identifications. You could come up with
[42:55] others perhaps, but these are definite.
[42:58] Yes. The the five definite
[43:00] identifications of the true church of
[43:02] the living God. And these are my
[43:04] summaries of the five that he outlines
[43:08] in this sermon. So, this is my coming up
[43:10] with a summary for you to kind of grasp.
[43:12] And I wanted them all up there in case
[43:13] you wanted to jot them down, you could
[43:15] just kind of have them up. And I'm not
[43:16] worried about you getting ahead of me
[43:17] here. But the five definite
[43:20] identifications of the true church and
[43:22] living God. It is the body of Christ.
[43:24] The true church is the body of Christ.
[43:27] And it was started by Jesus Christ. It
[43:31] is the body of Christ started by Jesus
[43:33] Christ. Its message is salvation by the
[43:36] new birth and divine healing. So it has
[43:39] a message. Its message is salvation by
[43:42] the new birth. And it has a message of
[43:43] divine healing. And the membership is
[43:47] through the new birth. You can only be a
[43:50] member, I say, use the word membership.
[43:52] You can only be a member of this body of
[43:54] Christ which Jesus Christ started by
[43:57] being born again by the baptism of the
[43:58] Holy Ghost. By one spirit, you're
[44:00] baptized. It's the only way. And then
[44:02] the fifth definite identification of the
[44:05] true church of the living God is it
[44:08] alone is predestinated to be in the
[44:10] resurrection and the rapture. It's just
[44:12] the true church that's in the
[44:13] resurrection. It's just the true church
[44:15] that's in the rapture. It's just the
[44:16] true church in which all members are
[44:18] born again by the baptism of the Holy
[44:19] Ghost which is your ticket in a rapture
[44:22] or a resurrection. So it is the body of
[44:24] Christ started by Jesus Christ with the
[44:26] message of salvation and healing and its
[44:28] membership is through the new birth and
[44:30] those who are born again into this body
[44:32] are the only ones that are going to come
[44:33] up in a resurrection the resurrection
[44:35] and go in the rapture. Amen. Now, with
[44:38] these five still before you, these
[44:41] definitive identifications, Brother
[44:44] Brandham comes up with by answering five
[44:47] different
[44:49] questions. And and so the questions that
[44:51] he asked, and again, I'm just pulling
[44:53] these through uh pulling these through
[44:55] the message. I think it's a very
[44:57] beautiful way that brother Brandham
[44:59] brought it out. such a tremendous uh
[45:01] labor and you could see just the
[45:03] deliberation and the anointing a and the
[45:06] study that how he constructed this. It's
[45:08] fascinating. These are the five
[45:10] questions. What is it? It's the body of
[45:12] Christ. Who set it up? Started by Jesus
[45:15] Christ. What is its message? Salvation
[45:17] by the new birth uh divine healing. How
[45:20] do we become a member of it? By this new
[45:22] birth. And can we get to heaven without
[45:26] it? These are the five questions. What
[45:28] is it? Who set it up? What is its
[45:29] message? How do we become a member of
[45:31] it? Can we get to heaven without it?
[45:34] Now, again, I'll just leave the leave
[45:36] these up here just for a moment. Uh
[45:37] perhaps just leave it up there till I'll
[45:39] tell you to take it down because I think
[45:40] it might be good for us just to keep
[45:41] looking back at this and those five
[45:43] questions. What is it? Who set it up?
[45:45] What's its message? I like this. Can we
[45:46] get to heaven without it? Now, can we
[45:49] get to heaven without it? It's a
[45:52] wonderful wonder, wonderful question. We
[45:55] know no you can't because it's only
[45:56] those
[45:57] predestinated those in the body of
[45:59] Christ those alone are the ones
[46:00] predestinated to be in the resurrection
[46:01] and rapture. So when he says can we get
[46:03] to heaven without it? He's specifically
[46:05] referring to the translation the
[46:07] resurrection and rapture. And it's in
[46:09] that I think we can just begin to think
[46:11] most logically but in a scriptural way
[46:14] how the local church is different than
[46:16] the true church. Because these five
[46:19] definite identifications of the true
[46:20] church of the living God highlight how
[46:23] the true church is different from the
[46:25] local church. And I think it's important
[46:27] sometimes we have a tendency to want to
[46:29] conflate the body of Christ and the true
[46:31] church with the local church to where we
[46:33] are so fervent of the local church that
[46:37] in our minds the the distinction is
[46:39] completely blurred and we become the
[46:42] true church and then guess what? You
[46:44] can't go to heaven unless you go to
[46:49] because you you you've lost lost that
[46:52] distinction.
[46:54] But this is I'm going to go through
[46:57] maybe I want to do this and I don't want
[47:00] to get bogged down in it. But let's
[47:02] start looking at the difference between
[47:03] the local church and true church. The
[47:04] local church is a gathering of people
[47:06] that require organization and
[47:09] structure. It's it it's important that
[47:11] we set a time for service so that we all
[47:14] kind of get here around relatively
[47:15] around the same time. It's important
[47:18] that it have structure that it have uh
[47:20] that it have particular order a and
[47:22] governments placed within it. And so the
[47:25] local church requires organiz in some in
[47:28] some states there's a requirement that
[47:30] in order for you to own property you
[47:33] have to organize. And I can remember
[47:35] years ago that when one of the first
[47:36] churches got their web address and it
[47:38] was.org that there was a whole sect of
[47:41] message believers. They were like, "See,
[47:42] Mark of the Beast, they're all going to
[47:44] hell because they the message is
[47:47] denominated." And it was like, "Oh,
[47:49] really? Okay, let's back up a little
[47:51] bit. Let's figure this out. Where are we
[47:52] in all this?" And and so there's certain
[47:55] legal requirements to be organized, to
[47:59] be formally incorporated, to have
[48:01] trustees and executive officers. And
[48:03] this is just all this is all things that
[48:05] may be required in a natural sense.
[48:07] That's part of the local church. But the
[48:08] true church is not an organization.
[48:10] Amen. And the true church is not just a
[48:12] gathering of people. The true church is
[48:15] the family of God.
[48:18] The local church has a physical location
[48:20] and serves a
[48:21] community. It has a physical location,
[48:24] but the true church is free and not
[48:25] bound by any boundaries. Again, I'm just
[48:27] taking these things straight from the
[48:29] message. Five different identifications
[48:30] of the true church of living God. And a
[48:32] local church members can come and
[48:35] go. There's people that come, they can
[48:37] be here for a while. They can they can
[48:39] be at every service. They can be paying
[48:41] their tithes. They can participate and
[48:42] then feel led of the Lord to go on and
[48:44] move on. And when they have done so,
[48:46] they may no longer be quote unquote a
[48:48] member of the local church, but they
[48:50] have not left the body of Christ by no
[48:51] means.
[48:53] Because the true church's membership,
[48:55] the membership is eternal by birth.
[48:59] In a local church, you can change
[49:00] shepherds, right? There's local churches
[49:03] that uh through time and through
[49:05] circumstance, you can have a church can
[49:07] have one name. It can have one group of
[49:09] people, but the the the pastor can
[49:10] change and a new pastor come and be over
[49:13] it. So, a local church can have multiple
[49:14] pastors over its lifetime. But the true
[49:16] church has one shepherd forever, Christ.
[49:20] There's no change in shepherds.
[49:22] The local church has three kinds of
[49:24] believers.
[49:25] As believers, we all say, "Amen." That's
[49:27] right. We think about our neighbors in
[49:29] the apartment next door who didn't come
[49:30] to church this morning. But every church
[49:32] has, we're taught has three kinds of
[49:34] believers. But the true church is only
[49:36] believers.
[49:39] That's right. Local church. Don't amen
[49:41] too loud with this one. But local
[49:43] churches have
[49:44] politics, divisions, clicks, splits.
[49:48] It's in the local church that there's
[49:49] big I's and little U's. Amen. But the
[49:52] true church is an indivisible body
[49:55] with no unnecessary members. No big
[49:58] eyes, no little U's. There's no schism
[50:01] in that body. Paul had to admonish local
[50:03] churches that there not be divisions,
[50:05] there not be politicking, there not be
[50:06] clicks. But in the body of Christ, there
[50:09] is no. He says in 1 Corinthians 1:13, is
[50:12] Christ divided? No. So when you say, I
[50:16] am of Paul, I am of Apollos. Brother
[50:19] Randy, you may remember, maybe sister
[50:20] Lori, you may remember brother Perry
[50:22] Green's principal. It was North Side
[50:24] Tabernacle. It was Love Divine. It was
[50:27] Tucson Tabernacle. It was Evening Light
[50:29] Fellowship. It wasn't, oh, Brother
[50:31] Doug's and Brother Bakers. And it was he
[50:33] used the name of the church, because but
[50:36] what it's easy, I know, sometimes just
[50:38] to say, "Oh, I go to brother so and so's
[50:40] church." But Christ is not divided,
[50:44] right? We may be and not in a sense of
[50:47] actual division or conflict but we are
[50:50] separated in a sense and we gather in
[50:52] our different gatherings as the Lord
[50:53] would lead us but that doesn't separate
[50:55] the body of Christ. Paul says is Christ
[50:58] divided? No. But you divide yourself. I
[51:00] am a Paul. I'm of apost. But the body of
[51:02] Christ is not divided. There is no there
[51:04] are no politics. There are no schisms.
[51:06] There are there is no breach in that
[51:08] body. Amen.
[51:13] as it says in I don't have these there
[51:14] brother John so if you could just keep
[51:15] this up here in Galatians 3 27 and 29
[51:19] for as many as you have been baptized
[51:21] into Christ have put on Christ there is
[51:24] neither Jew nor Greek there's neither
[51:26] bond nor free there's neither male nor
[51:28] female for you are all one in Christ
[51:30] Jesus and if you be Christ then you are
[51:32] Abraham's seed and hes according to the
[51:35] promise all are equally accepted through
[51:38] faith God's not standing there and
[51:39] saying by faith you believe but are you
[51:41] a gentile yeah Okay, go over here. By
[51:44] faith, you believe. Are you a gentile?
[51:46] No. Are you a woman? Yes. Go over here.
[51:48] You know, I guess he doesn't want to
[51:49] assume you're gender. So, he just you go
[51:50] over here. And and there's not just this
[51:52] dividing based upon gender, bond or
[51:55] free. We're all We all have equal rights
[51:58] and access to God's blessings and
[52:00] promises. All external distinctions
[52:03] disappear in Christ. And we are all
[52:05] Abraham's seeds, heirs of the promise.
[52:07] In other words, heirs according to the
[52:09] promise, heirs of God. All of us
[52:10] together collectively one.
[52:13] That's in the church. That that's in the
[52:15] true church. But then in a local church,
[52:19] we're taught to let your women keep
[52:20] silence in the churches.
[52:23] That there's even instructions to
[52:25] servants. The the bond within
[52:28] churches. Even Paul with Fleiman sends
[52:31] him back to the church and he says, uh
[52:32] uh uh let him be to you not as a servant
[52:35] anymore, but receive him as one that is
[52:36] free. In other words, there are still
[52:38] some of these distinctions that could
[52:40] exist. I'm not saying necessarily to
[52:42] bond or free, but we know that within
[52:44] churches, there's churches sometimes
[52:46] that are purely a church that speaks
[52:48] French.
[52:50] There's churches that speak only
[52:51] Spanish. There's ones that have
[52:52] different languages. And and is there
[52:54] anyone say, "Oh, well that they can't be
[52:57] some other church that speaks Swahili.
[52:58] There can't be another church. We all
[53:00] need to come together and form one
[53:01] church." No. Those distinctions will
[53:03] exist in local churches. But in the body
[53:06] of Christ, it's one language, one mind,
[53:08] one DNA, one fa father. And all those
[53:12] sting distinctions disappear. But on a
[53:14] local church level, these things can
[53:16] still remain.
[53:20] So then how does our church, this church
[53:23] fit in with the true church and its
[53:25] calling? Just as much as these
[53:28] identifications show how the true church
[53:31] is different from this church or a local
[53:34] church, it's these characteristics that
[53:36] also identify the common goal and
[53:39] purpose of a local
[53:42] church. The vision and purpose of this
[53:45] church must promote the edification of
[53:48] the true church.
[53:50] Thank you for that slide.
[53:53] The local
[53:55] church, the local church must have the
[53:57] same message as the true church.
[54:01] It's a it's reflecting salvation by the
[54:04] new birth, justification,
[54:05] sanctification, baptism, holy ghost.
[54:07] That's the message of the of the local
[54:08] church. It preaches repentance and water
[54:10] baptism. It preaches divine healing. The
[54:13] local church has the same message as the
[54:15] true church. The purpose of this church
[54:18] and it was even articulated in the
[54:19] vision we shared last week and uh uh and
[54:22] that we've had since the beginning. It's
[54:23] to lead lead those who come lead our
[54:26] members to partake to become a part of
[54:29] the true
[54:30] church. Uh my desire as a pastor is not
[54:33] that you just would all come a and and
[54:36] be members of this church, but I would
[54:38] desire that as you come your membership
[54:41] in the body of Christ is secured or made
[54:44] known. that I would know your testimony,
[54:46] Brother Aaron. I know I'm new to your
[54:47] church, but uh in fellowship. What's
[54:49] your testimony? Oh, I was raised in the
[54:51] message. I received the Holy Ghost at
[54:52] this time. I've been a member of the
[54:54] body of Christ ever since then. Then I I
[54:56] recognize your position in the body of
[54:58] Christ. And I and and I have peace then
[55:00] in teaching the word of God that that
[55:02] that part's been made. And then anyone
[55:04] else who wouldn't have a testimony, my
[55:06] burden, my desire for these young men on
[55:07] the front row who won't wiggle their
[55:08] fingers, these my desire is that they
[55:10] would receive the new birth experience.
[55:13] I don't want them just to become good
[55:14] church members, learn to run the camera,
[55:16] learn to play the instruments, everybody
[55:18] who's serving together so we can have a
[55:19] really, really good youth group. No, I
[55:21] want them to meet God face to face.
[55:24] And if if meeting God face to face and
[55:27] feeling Owen with the baptism of the
[55:28] Holy Ghost means that God would call him
[55:30] uh to go preach the gospel somewhere and
[55:32] start a churchying, I would say, "No,
[55:35] you belong here. You're under my
[55:36] ministry." No, God, take your son. Place
[55:39] him where he belongs.
[55:43] Hallelujah. So we want we want the
[55:46] people to be to have the new birth
[55:48] experience then to preach the word to
[55:50] establish them in the truth. Encourage
[55:52] them to partake in all the benefits of
[55:54] the true
[55:55] church not the benefits of this church.
[55:59] The benefits of this church. Uh there
[56:01] could be certain benefits that maybe we
[56:03] say well the benefits of this church
[56:04] where we go now. You might list some of
[56:06] the benefits. And uh the church we had
[56:09] before the benefits is it it had like
[56:11] 114 rooms and had a full bar and a nice
[56:14] patio with the fire feature and
[56:15] everything. And you say those are the
[56:17] benefits of going to this church. You
[56:19] know all the amenities and all the all
[56:20] the different things that churches can
[56:22] offer. And uh but what the the purpose
[56:25] and goal of a local church isn't to
[56:28] offer benefits so that you become
[56:30] faithful to this church to that church
[56:33] but ultimately despite whatever might be
[56:35] provided at what that's driving all that
[56:38] is that we're providing a place for you
[56:40] to learn of all your benefits in the
[56:42] true church and take advantage of those.
[56:45] There are some people that treat church
[56:46] they just come and go. They just come
[56:48] and go and they don't they don't ever
[56:50] take part in all the other benefits that
[56:52] the church has to the local church has
[56:54] to offer. And maybe it begs the
[56:56] question, are they not take partaking in
[56:58] all the benefits that the body of Christ
[57:00] has to offer by the way that they treat
[57:02] treat church?
[57:04] So we want to encourage then what we do
[57:06] is we encourage the leadership of the
[57:08] Holy Ghost and the liberty of Christ in
[57:10] each believer. We encourage it. Amen.
[57:12] Amen. It's what we desire to see the
[57:13] leadership of the Holy Ghost in the
[57:14] individual's life and the and to see the
[57:17] liberty of Christ in each believer.
[57:19] That's why we have I've purposed in my
[57:22] heart and and and I want to be careful
[57:24] how I say this because I know we've each
[57:26] had different experiences and I think I
[57:27] certainly think there's an element of
[57:28] truth to it. But how many have ever been
[57:30] in a situation where you were told maybe
[57:33] through counseling or fellowship or
[57:34] something you were you were seeking
[57:36] guidance or you were sharing something
[57:37] that you felt led to do and you say,
[57:39] "Well, I feel led to do this." And the
[57:40] person you're talking to says, "Well, I
[57:42] can't say anything because you said you
[57:43] felt led." Anybody ever had that happen
[57:45] before, right? Okay, good. I'll just
[57:48] preach to you. Because you sit there and
[57:50] say, "Well, um, I believe that God's
[57:52] calling me to do this." And and it's
[57:54] almost as if the person who ought to be
[57:56] giving you counsel out of it. They pull
[57:58] the pilot. They're going to just wash
[57:59] their hands of this. Well, you told me
[58:00] God told you, so I can't say anything.
[58:02] Really? So, if I told you that God told
[58:05] me to go rob a bank, you're gonna be
[58:08] like, "Sorry, sorry." Can't say anything
[58:11] because you said God said, "God told me
[58:13] to kill my wife and marry a new one."
[58:18] God told you.
[58:20] But what a what a what a I believe in my
[58:22] heart as a man of God, if you told me
[58:24] you felt led to do something, in my
[58:26] heart of hearts, I am not neutral. I
[58:29] want you to follow God's word. I want
[58:32] you to follow God's will. I want you to
[58:33] follow God's will for your life. So I
[58:35] realize I can have an idea of what it
[58:37] is. You can have an idea of what it is.
[58:39] You believe God wants you to do this.
[58:41] Then I believe that I have an obligation
[58:42] if you came to me as a pastor to talk to
[58:44] you about it.
[58:46] Well, that's wonderful. Let's talk about
[58:48] it. Not to give you my opinion or tell
[58:50] you what I think you ought to do, but
[58:52] actually say, "Well, you feel led to do
[58:54] this or God is telling you to do this
[58:56] this. Let's walk through this process of
[58:58] how God spoke to you. Let's at least
[59:00] talk about it." And then if I could say,
[59:01] "But brother, according to the word of
[59:03] God, I don't believe you should kill
[59:05] your wife and marry another one." Right?
[59:09] Like I certainly would have that uh that
[59:11] authority to do it. But ultimately, end
[59:13] of the day, what you desire is to see
[59:15] that each believer is following the
[59:17] leadership of the Lord in their life.
[59:20] Says in Romans 8:14, "For as many as are
[59:22] led by the spirit of God, they are the
[59:24] sons of God." Amen.
[59:27] It doesn't say as many as follow their
[59:28] pastor, but it's for as many as are led
[59:30] by the spirit of God, they are sons of
[59:32] God. There are millions and millions of
[59:34] people that follow their pastor, but
[59:36] they're not necessarily sons of God just
[59:38] because they follow the pastor. You
[59:40] understand the distinction I'm making?
[59:43] All all lontainees are singers, right?
[59:46] But not all singers are lontains.
[59:51] All sons of God are led by the spirit of
[59:54] God. Right? All of and being led by the
[59:56] spirit of God. They make themselves
[59:57] subject to gifts. They make themselves
[59:59] subject to to authorities and they and
[1:00:01] they follow a certain way. But just
[1:00:02] because you see somebody as a really
[1:00:04] really fervent and passionate follower
[1:00:06] of a church doesn't mean they're a son
[1:00:07] of God unless they're following the
[1:00:09] leadership of God. So let me just share
[1:00:11] something with you. I think that'll help
[1:00:12] you. If anyone ever asks you, why does
[1:00:14] that person go to that church? Just
[1:00:16] immediately assume because they feel
[1:00:18] led.
[1:00:19] Just immediately assume that. Why do
[1:00:21] they go to that church?
[1:00:23] Well, I'm assuming they feel led as sons
[1:00:25] and daughters of God to go to that
[1:00:26] church,
[1:00:28] right? I I I'm just that would be what I
[1:00:31] that would be the grace I'd want people
[1:00:32] to give me, right? Why did brother Aaron
[1:00:35] go to church and start go to Phoenix to
[1:00:36] start a church? Well, I I like the the
[1:00:40] those who have said, "Well, brother
[1:00:41] Aaron's doing it. I just imagine he was
[1:00:43] I believe he felt led to do it." And I
[1:00:45] have been led to do it. But that's for
[1:00:48] me. You know, in that sense, when God
[1:00:51] leads one son to do something, that
[1:00:53] doesn't become a mandate for everybody
[1:00:54] to weigh in on it. Well, he feels led to
[1:00:57] go to that church. Well, I don't feel
[1:00:58] led to go to church. And this is my
[1:01:00] reasons why for not doing it. You don't
[1:01:01] even need to say anything. You don't
[1:01:04] need to justify your staying. You don't
[1:01:05] need to justify your going. Are you led
[1:01:08] by the spirit of God? Brother Brandham
[1:01:11] said the sen is up. The slaves to sin
[1:01:14] and church denomination, church annity,
[1:01:16] and all those things. You are free. Whom
[1:01:19] the Son hath set free is free indeed.
[1:01:22] You shall know the truth of the truth
[1:01:24] shall make you free. My original
[1:01:26] inspiration for this was a family free.
[1:01:30] That as a family we're free. When you
[1:01:32] recognize your position, oh hallelujah.
[1:01:34] When you recognize your position in the
[1:01:36] body of Christ, then you're free. It's
[1:01:39] not recognizing your place in Arizona
[1:01:41] believers church. That's what brings
[1:01:43] bondage. When you feel that you're so
[1:01:45] tied to a church name, a church pastor,
[1:01:48] then you can be dominated and you can be
[1:01:50] held in bondage. But when you recognize
[1:01:52] your place in Jesus Christ, then you're
[1:01:54] free.
[1:01:58] Thank you, Lord. Brother Joshua, you had
[1:02:01] asked me in an email a month ago, what
[1:02:04] does brother Brandon mean about church
[1:02:05] entity? I hope you don't mind me
[1:02:06] mentioning it. And I thought it was a
[1:02:08] wonderful question. I won't tell tell
[1:02:10] you how long it took me to answer that,
[1:02:11] but I thought it was a very good
[1:02:13] question. Okay, it was a month, right?
[1:02:15] Sorry. But I had always kind of taken
[1:02:18] that word church annity just kind of
[1:02:20] just churchiness, right? Just an
[1:02:23] emphasis on church. And I searched it
[1:02:25] and brother Bram says church annities
[1:02:26] and church annity around 20
[1:02:29] times. And I thought, well, I want to
[1:02:31] learn what this word is. and being the
[1:02:32] etmologist that I am, which isn't the
[1:02:34] study of
[1:02:37] insects, I looked it up and there's a
[1:02:39] word called churchianity. So whether or
[1:02:41] not it's he's meaning to say
[1:02:44] churchianity and it's just being uh
[1:02:46] written a certain way, but churchianity
[1:02:48] is an excessive or narrowly secretarian
[1:02:52] attachment to the practices and interest
[1:02:54] of a particular church.
[1:02:58] So when brother man says we're free of
[1:02:59] church annity, church annities or
[1:03:02] churchianity, we're free from the
[1:03:04] successive
[1:03:06] narrow secretarian dividing attachment
[1:03:09] to the practices and interest of a
[1:03:12] particular church.
[1:03:15] You realize that we could become so
[1:03:17] narrow in our view of the message and
[1:03:20] Christ to where all of a sudden we are
[1:03:22] just narrowly attached to the practices
[1:03:24] of this church, the interest of this
[1:03:27] church, this particular church, and we
[1:03:29] don't recognize the role that we play in
[1:03:31] the broader vision of God's family.
[1:03:35] Brother man said the voice of politics
[1:03:37] is actually stronger than the voice of
[1:03:40] God in the churches.
[1:03:42] This is the voice of politics is
[1:03:45] actually stronger than the voice of God
[1:03:46] in the churches. That's a direct
[1:03:48] statement.
[1:03:54] We know and we're taught that local
[1:03:56] churches have sovereignty, right? Local
[1:03:59] churches having sovereignty. That means
[1:04:01] they're not controlled by outside
[1:04:03] forces. They're they're free from
[1:04:05] external control. This is in the
[1:04:07] natural. The local church, Brother says,
[1:04:10] it's sovereign. He's meaning that they
[1:04:11] don't answer to a board. They're not
[1:04:13] answering to headquarters and being told
[1:04:15] what to do in their services. They don't
[1:04:17] they don't have somebody on the outside
[1:04:18] placing things. There's no formal
[1:04:20] structure, a a local church in its body
[1:04:22] in its unit as far as pastor, associate
[1:04:24] pastor, deacon, trustee. He says even in
[1:04:26] that there there's no dictator in the
[1:04:28] church. They all have one vote. And he's
[1:04:30] saying this is that in itself is a is is
[1:04:33] a is sovereign a sovereign not
[1:04:35] controlled by outside forces. But the
[1:04:37] local church is not a sovereign over the
[1:04:40] true church cuz that's a different word.
[1:04:43] It means to be supreme. It means to be
[1:04:44] ruler. It means to be master of. The
[1:04:47] local church is not the master of the
[1:04:49] true church.
[1:04:51] Right? Brother Brandham never placed
[1:04:54] even the local church as master over the
[1:04:56] families. He never t took the pastor and
[1:04:59] shoved out the husband and put him in
[1:05:00] the place of the husband. No, those
[1:05:02] things remain intact according to the
[1:05:04] word of God. within the church. This
[1:05:06] church begins to kind of recognize its
[1:05:08] place. Says, "I want to stay in my lane.
[1:05:11] I want to want to serve the purpose
[1:05:12] because the local church has sovereignty
[1:05:15] or is sovereign, not controlled by
[1:05:17] outside forces, but it serves a greater
[1:05:20] force. It serves a greater master
[1:05:22] because it's not sovereign over the body
[1:05:24] of Christ."
[1:05:26] I've run out of time.
[1:05:30] And so I appreciate that. But
[1:05:33] um I want to be very very careful
[1:05:36] here, brother. The G I'll just quickly
[1:05:39] refer to these things in first if you
[1:05:41] could put up there 1 Corinthians
[1:05:43] 12. You're you are the body of Christ
[1:05:46] and members in
[1:05:48] particular. So that's that oneness. And
[1:05:50] it's amazing to think the problems that
[1:05:52] Paul was dealing with in the Corinthian
[1:05:55] church and think about what his solution
[1:05:57] was. Ponder this. These this this
[1:06:00] division, the schism, the the the the
[1:06:02] sin that was existing within the local
[1:06:04] church and Paul is orienting them so
[1:06:06] much to the fact that there's something
[1:06:07] bigger than them. You recognize it.
[1:06:10] We've read from chapter 3, chapter uh
[1:06:12] chapter 12, chapter 10. Uh we referred
[1:06:16] to chapter 1. This is all from 1
[1:06:17] Corinthians again now chapter 12 again.
[1:06:20] And there's all these references in
[1:06:22] here. And I have references here before
[1:06:24] me in chapter 14 that that he's all he's
[1:06:27] taking things and there's a way that you
[1:06:29] could break this down. So I guess I am
[1:06:31] just gonna go ahead and run with it.
[1:06:32] Break this down to where Paul is saying
[1:06:34] this is the local church. That's where
[1:06:35] the problems exist. But then there's a
[1:06:38] true church true church and there's no
[1:06:40] problems that exist there. And that if
[1:06:42] you want to resolve the problems in the
[1:06:44] local church, harmonize your vision with
[1:06:46] the true church. recognize your place as
[1:06:48] members of this local church in the body
[1:06:51] of Christ in the true church and all of
[1:06:53] a sudden it begins to be a paradigm
[1:06:55] shift and you start to address things
[1:06:56] the right way. You start to deal with
[1:06:58] sin. You start to change your attitude.
[1:07:00] We're not of Apollos. We're not of Paul.
[1:07:01] We're not of Arizona believers. We're
[1:07:03] not of cornerstone. We are of the body
[1:07:05] of Christ. And then you begin to take
[1:07:07] your place in the body of Christ. And
[1:07:09] that makes you a fruitful member of the
[1:07:10] local church. Amen.
[1:07:13] And he says he set some in the church,
[1:07:16] apostles, prophets. And he gives a
[1:07:17] ranking here. First, apostles,
[1:07:19] secondary, prophets, teachers, miracles,
[1:07:20] gifts of healings, helps, governments,
[1:07:22] diversities of tongues. What are all
[1:07:24] these gifts? Gifts and ministries within
[1:07:28] the body of Christ. When brother says
[1:07:30] you're baptized in the body of Christ,
[1:07:31] what does he say? It makes you subject
[1:07:32] to these
[1:07:33] gifts. He says, "What good would the
[1:07:35] gifts do outside of the body?"
[1:07:38] So they work within they their their
[1:07:39] gifts and ministries within the body of
[1:07:41] Christ that work within the framework of
[1:07:42] what the local
[1:07:44] church. This is where they have their
[1:07:46] opportunity to be expressed. This is
[1:07:48] where they function amongst the family
[1:07:50] of believers, the body of believers.
[1:07:51] Brother Bam refers to this even a local
[1:07:53] church as your post of duty. We have a
[1:07:56] home church. So you have these gifts
[1:07:59] that exist in the body of Christ and now
[1:08:02] they become they find their post of duty
[1:08:04] or they find their home in a local
[1:08:05] church. But then those gifts, brother
[1:08:07] said, are subject to the word.
[1:08:12] Just as even an example, how there can
[1:08:14] be a gift according to the word and to
[1:08:16] be a gifted man. He's a member of the
[1:08:18] body of Christ, but then he he's called
[1:08:20] to be a shepherd. He's called to be a
[1:08:21] pastor. So when God anoints a man and
[1:08:23] gives him this gift, he says in this
[1:08:25] ranking of apostles and prophets and
[1:08:27] teachers that we know in Ephesians, it
[1:08:29] refers to that uh the that he's given us
[1:08:32] these gifts and one is being a pastor.
[1:08:35] When God calls a man to be a pastor,
[1:08:37] he's not a pastor to the body of Christ.
[1:08:39] Right.
[1:08:41] And so I I could just I could just walk
[1:08:43] into one of these high-end stores. We'll
[1:08:45] go to uh maybe there's a boutique in
[1:08:47] Paradise Valley and just kind of walk in
[1:08:48] and say, "Excuse me, are you a
[1:08:50] Christian? Professing believer. When's
[1:08:53] the last time you paid tithe?" Well, I
[1:08:55] don't pay tithe. Well, I'm a pastor to
[1:08:56] the body of Christ. If you don't mind,
[1:08:58] you can either give me a 10% discount or
[1:09:00] just pay me give me give me your tithing
[1:09:02] right now. There's no you can't just
[1:09:05] make everyone subject to you.
[1:09:08] But what does God do? He places them as
[1:09:10] Peter said, "Feed the flock of God which
[1:09:12] is 1 Peter 5:2. Feed the flock of God
[1:09:14] which is among you.
[1:09:18] Woe unto you worldwide web, right? Where
[1:09:21] all of a sudden we feel that our
[1:09:23] ministry expands beyond the flock among
[1:09:26] us and we begin to make the audience
[1:09:28] those beyond the fourth wall." Yeah.
[1:09:31] It's one of the things you don't break,
[1:09:32] right? Am I right? It's one of those
[1:09:33] things you don't break in film unless
[1:09:35] you're trying to make a point is you
[1:09:36] never look directly into the camera,
[1:09:38] right? It's the fourth wall in film.
[1:09:40] It's something that's not done unless
[1:09:42] it's for a dramatic instance. It's
[1:09:44] something done can be done very
[1:09:46] effectively within cinematography. And
[1:09:48] it's something that we have to be very
[1:09:49] careful of as ministers is not to break
[1:09:52] the fourth wall because you're to feed
[1:09:54] the flock of God which is among you. I
[1:09:56] may be called to be a pastor, but I'm
[1:09:58] not a pastor to the world. I'm not a
[1:10:00] pastor to flocks around the world. I'm
[1:10:02] called to pastor those. He gave us the
[1:10:04] word of the Lord. Those who he's
[1:10:06] ordained to put here. And we've had a
[1:10:08] confidence since day one that this was
[1:10:10] God that was doing it. And he would call
[1:10:12] his sheep home and they would find their
[1:10:15] own fold and they would find be part of
[1:10:17] their own family and their own flock.
[1:10:24] And so that's a position within a local
[1:10:26] church.
[1:10:28] But these gifts
[1:10:29] though are for the health and strength
[1:10:32] of the true church.
[1:10:34] Do you realize that? Otherwise, very
[1:10:36] literally, if if the gift is to the
[1:10:39] local church and then as a pastor of the
[1:10:42] local church, my goal is to just build
[1:10:44] the local church and it's not for the
[1:10:46] health and benefit of the true church.
[1:10:48] Think of how empty that is because
[1:10:51] there's no guarantee of salvation just
[1:10:52] by being a part of a church, local
[1:10:54] church. It just all of a sudden what is
[1:10:56] it? It does become a cult. It becomes an
[1:10:59] organization.
[1:11:00] It becomes what so many people have
[1:11:02] turned Christianity into.
[1:11:06] They treat church now like they do
[1:11:07] restaurants.
[1:11:09] How many How many tables do we have? We
[1:11:11] have 125 tables. All right. We need to
[1:11:13] turn them over every hour. See how many
[1:11:15] services we can get in.
[1:11:18] It's exactly what it's become.
[1:11:22] So uh these
[1:11:23] gifts, these
[1:11:26] positions, they may operate within a
[1:11:28] local church, but they have a duty to
[1:11:30] the true church and a position. They
[1:11:33] must first have a position in the true
[1:11:35] church. Bam says, "All these things that
[1:11:38] go in the local body, what does it say
[1:11:39] in Ephesians 4:12?" And let me just read
[1:11:41] this quick. Perfecting the saints,
[1:11:42] edifying of the body of Christ, till we
[1:11:44] all come into the unity of the faith,
[1:11:45] the knowledge of the son of God, the
[1:11:46] stature of the measure of the fullness
[1:11:48] of Christ. So the goal isn't a perfect
[1:11:50] local church. The goal is his saints in
[1:11:52] his body, the perfecting of them, the
[1:11:54] perfecting of the saints, the perfecting
[1:11:56] the building up of the body of Christ,
[1:11:58] the unity of the faith, the knowledge of
[1:11:59] the son of God to preach the word of God
[1:12:01] until the members of the true church
[1:12:02] come into the stature of the perfect
[1:12:04] man. The goal isn't a perfect local
[1:12:05] church. The goal is that the people
[1:12:07] would get the true revelation of the
[1:12:08] true church and what she is and what she
[1:12:11] stands for. It's not to get a revelation
[1:12:12] of who your pastor is. It's to get a
[1:12:15] revelation of the true church and what
[1:12:16] she stands for. That's the goal. Get the
[1:12:19] people to get a true revelation of the
[1:12:21] true church and what she stands for,
[1:12:23] what she is, and what she stands for.
[1:12:24] And that she can do their greater work.
[1:12:26] She will be an invincible army.
[1:12:29] That's the goal of the local church is
[1:12:31] that the people of God will get the true
[1:12:33] revelation of the true church and what
[1:12:36] she is and what she stands for and that
[1:12:38] you, the member of the true church, can
[1:12:41] do the greater works. She will be an
[1:12:43] invincible army.
[1:12:46] We may not be an invincible church.
[1:12:47] There's churches that are ordained of
[1:12:49] God and moved of God and they're not
[1:12:50] invincible. They're not eternal. They
[1:12:52] don't always last, but they served an
[1:12:54] eternal purpose and they'll have a
[1:12:55] legacy in eternity.
[1:12:58] Brother says, "And all these things go
[1:13:00] into each local body. And every person
[1:13:02] in the church has an individual
[1:13:03] ministry."
[1:13:05] And that individual ministry goes
[1:13:07] together with the rest of the ministry
[1:13:08] to edify the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:13] That's the goal. These things are in the
[1:13:16] local body and these gifts work together
[1:13:19] subject to the word but to do what? To
[1:13:21] edify the body of Christ.
[1:13:25] And therefore it gives us it gives you
[1:13:27] pause. It gives you pause as as people.
[1:13:30] I believe that as Christians we ought to
[1:13:32] do this. Don't give up on me now,
[1:13:33] brother Loyel. that it gives us it gives
[1:13:36] us pause as as ministers as believers
[1:13:41] that I don't want to just I don't want
[1:13:44] to act in such a way that it's self-s
[1:13:46] serving I I I don't even want to just
[1:13:49] think in such a way to where what makes
[1:13:51] my church look good but what edifies the
[1:13:55] body of Christ what won't bring smut on
[1:13:58] the message what glorifies God what
[1:14:00] honors the Lord what honors one another
[1:14:04] And how is it that I can act and how is
[1:14:06] it that I can do things that if if I
[1:14:08] don't take it in consideration? You
[1:14:10] could say that you could do that, but
[1:14:11] what would that do to the body of
[1:14:13] Christ? You could act that way, but what
[1:14:15] would that do to the body of Christ?
[1:14:19] And and by no means am I eliciting some
[1:14:22] restraint or bondage to a man of God. If
[1:14:24] it's in the word, it's for the body.
[1:14:28] Now, let me read this. You're thinking,
[1:14:31] "How in the world are you just going to
[1:14:32] wind your way around to Genesis 21?"
[1:14:33] Well, I'm just going to read it at the
[1:14:35] end. I don't even need to connect it.
[1:14:38] This is my last quote, I
[1:14:40] think. Last paragraph of the church age
[1:14:43] book. Very last things you'll read. Some
[1:14:46] of the very last things you'll read. I
[1:14:47] maybe it's I realize this maybe I just I
[1:14:49] left a little bit out um in this,
[1:14:53] but maybe I just need to look it up. I I
[1:14:55] have this up here for my clock and for
[1:14:57] the songs. And uh maybe I'll just pull
[1:15:00] this up here. You don't mind, do you? If
[1:15:03] I just use this uh fruit of the tree of
[1:15:06] knowledge of good and evil, kind of
[1:15:08] redeeming the curse here and just uh see
[1:15:11] if I've left something out here. Oh boy,
[1:15:15] there's a lot
[1:15:16] here. Um it says this. Do you have it?
[1:15:19] Pull it up. So we conclude
[1:15:29] this. We conclude the seven church ages
[1:15:32] saying only what the spirit said to each
[1:15:40] age. He that hath an ear, let him hear
[1:15:43] what the spirit saith to the
[1:15:45] churches. You see that?
[1:15:49] This is what he concludes. I'm conclude.
[1:15:51] I'm in concluding my book. This is what
[1:15:52] I want to conclude
[1:15:55] is only what the spirit says. He that
[1:15:58] hath an ear. So it's he that has an ear
[1:16:00] ordained to hear. Have an e a r in your
[1:16:02] h e a r t to h e a r an ear in your
[1:16:07] heart to hear. He that hath an ear, let
[1:16:10] him hear what the spirit say to the
[1:16:12] churches. I sincerely believe that the
[1:16:13] spirit of God has been speaking to us.
[1:16:14] not only teaching us the truth of the
[1:16:16] ages, but he has been faithfully dealing
[1:16:18] with hearts that may that they may turn
[1:16:20] to him. That is the reason for all
[1:16:24] preaching and teaching. Are we Are
[1:16:28] we That is the reason for all preaching
[1:16:31] and teaching. For it is in the preaching
[1:16:33] and the teaching of the word that the
[1:16:35] sheep hear the voice of God and follow
[1:16:39] him. Think of how perfectly he's setting
[1:16:41] this forth. That's the reason for all
[1:16:43] preaching. That's the reason for all
[1:16:44] teaching is that by teaching the word
[1:16:46] and preaching the word, you hear his
[1:16:48] voice, not mine, but his voice and you
[1:16:50] follow him. Cuz he says, not for one
[1:16:53] moment do I bring a message to the
[1:16:55] people that they may follow me or join
[1:16:58] my church or start some fellowship and
[1:17:01] organization. In other words, that's not
[1:17:03] the end all. That's not the goal. That's
[1:17:05] not the reason for preaching. That's not
[1:17:07] the reason for God vindicating his
[1:17:09] ministry. is not that they would follow
[1:17:11] him or join a church or just start some
[1:17:12] church organization. I've never done
[1:17:14] that and will not do that now. I have no
[1:17:16] interest in those things. But I do have
[1:17:18] an interest in the things of God and
[1:17:20] people. This is why you go to this and
[1:17:23] you go to what our church vision is.
[1:17:24] You'll find that we're mapping this
[1:17:26] perfectly because this is our vision
[1:17:29] that we preach. We start a church. We
[1:17:31] preach the word of God. Not that anyone
[1:17:33] would follow us or become part of a
[1:17:35] dynamic local church, but that this is
[1:17:38] our interest, the things of God and
[1:17:39] people. And if I can accomplish just one
[1:17:42] thing, I will be satisfied. That one
[1:17:45] thing is to see established a true
[1:17:47] spiritual relationship between God and
[1:17:49] men, wherein men become new creations in
[1:17:52] Christ, filled with the spirit, and live
[1:17:55] according to his word.
[1:17:57] Yes, Lord. And he says, 'I would invite,
[1:18:00] plead and warn all to hear his voice at
[1:18:02] this time and yield your lives
[1:18:03] completely to him even as I trust in my
[1:18:05] heart that I've given my all to him. God
[1:18:07] bless you and may his coming rejoice
[1:18:09] your heart. Amen. That ends it. That's
[1:18:12] the resume of the ends the church age
[1:18:13] book in our some of our compilations of
[1:18:15] the message. Those are the last words
[1:18:17] you read. Isn't that a beautiful last
[1:18:19] statement?
[1:18:22] Think of it. Just just be spiritual now.
[1:18:25] that that let's just say that that
[1:18:27] becomes the final the final thing. Of
[1:18:29] course, with his last sermon being
[1:18:30] communion, just put those together and
[1:18:32] may his coming rejoice his heart. It's
[1:18:34] almost as if you take a step back and
[1:18:36] look at what the whole message is
[1:18:37] declaring to us. He's saying, does it
[1:18:39] rejoice your heart?
[1:18:42] What is it? What has it done for
[1:18:44] you? What has it produced for you? If I
[1:18:47] can accomplish just one thing, I'll be
[1:18:51] satisfied.
[1:18:54] That's the goal and the vision of the
[1:18:55] true church or that's the only way you
[1:18:57] become a part of the true church and
[1:18:59] then that's what a local church wants to
[1:19:00] support and
[1:19:03] facilitate. Not to create such hard
[1:19:06] structure that we're just so quick. I
[1:19:09] think I've said it before. We're so
[1:19:10] quick when people leave. Well, they went
[1:19:11] out from us because they weren't part of
[1:19:14] us. Instead of saying, you know what,
[1:19:16] the body of Christ is a many membered
[1:19:18] body. It places people all over the
[1:19:20] place.
[1:19:21] God bless him and be with him.
[1:19:25] Genesis
[1:19:27] 21:33. And Abraham planted a grove. I'm
[1:19:30] going to just pick right up with this,
[1:19:31] Lord willing, next Sunday. And Abraham
[1:19:34] planted a grove in
[1:19:36] Beerseba and called there in this grove
[1:19:39] called there on the name of the Lord the
[1:19:42] everlasting
[1:19:43] God. In other words, Abraham planted a
[1:19:47] tree and made it a place to worship God.
[1:19:51] I'll expound upon it in greater detail,
[1:19:53] Lord willing. But this is an act of
[1:19:54] revelation. What he does in this
[1:19:56] instance, go back and read this chapter.
[1:19:58] I think you'll start to connect these
[1:19:59] things together on your own. This was an
[1:20:01] act of revelation that looked back to
[1:20:02] the garden and looked forward to Christ.
[1:20:05] That's right. When he plants this tree,
[1:20:07] immediately connects it back to the
[1:20:08] paradise of God and the tree of life.
[1:20:10] And it points forward to Christ, which
[1:20:12] is the tree of life. When he planted
[1:20:14] that tree, it had purpose and meaning.
[1:20:16] And I want you to think of this. He
[1:20:18] didn't plant the tree for himself. It
[1:20:20] was connected to something greater than
[1:20:22] him.
[1:20:23] It wasn't Abraham's tree.
[1:20:27] It was a place where you called on the
[1:20:29] name of the Lord. And then this phrase
[1:20:30] that's not yet seen, the everlasting
[1:20:33] God. And the word there, Abraham planted
[1:20:37] a
[1:20:38] grove. It's viewed as a tree, though
[1:20:41] it's called a grove. The pando, 40,000
[1:20:44] trees, but called one grove. one tree.
[1:20:48] It's
[1:20:49] symbolic of our family
[1:20:51] tree. What I want you to see in Genesis
[1:20:54] 21:33, when Abraham planted a grove, it
[1:20:56] represents even the local church
[1:20:59] where those who are ordained from the
[1:21:01] beginning and be with him in the end can
[1:21:04] come and gather under the shade of a
[1:21:06] tree and call upon the name of the Lord,
[1:21:09] the everlasting God,
[1:21:12] and be a reflection of the true church.
[1:21:16] We love you today. Thank you so much for
[1:21:18] your attentiveness, your pulling on the
[1:21:19] word of God. Let's stand together.
