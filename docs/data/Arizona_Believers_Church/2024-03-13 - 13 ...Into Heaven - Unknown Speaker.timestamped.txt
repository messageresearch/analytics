[0:00] just want to take a few moments in the
[0:02] beginning to touch on uh last Wednesday
[0:06] night so just a few summary things not
[0:09] very long I don't try to take much just
[0:11] to recap but I do want there to always
[0:13] be some overlap and connection on some
[0:15] of these things so just a uh um a quick
[0:17] summary and just hold for the title for
[0:19] tonight but last time we preached out of
[0:22] dust and we took some time just to
[0:24] Define what dust is and some of its
[0:26] places in scripture and um one of the
[0:29] things that we identified is it's just
[0:31] something that's carried about by the
[0:32] wind it's something that's F real fine
[0:34] but we took from Genesis chapter 2 where
[0:37] it says the Lord God formed man of the
[0:38] Dust of the ground and breathed into his
[0:40] nostrils the Breath of Life in Man
[0:42] became a living soul that dust there
[0:45] even could be translated to ashes or
[0:47] just rubbish debris comes from even this
[0:50] mist or vapor or smoke we could see that
[0:53] dust is used just to symbolize the most
[0:55] basic element of the human body so we
[0:57] talk about dust we come from the Dust we
[1:00] arise from the dirt of the earth and
[1:03] being born of the Dust the Bible tells
[1:05] us that we return to the dust and so
[1:07] here we are just ashes God's uh made us
[1:10] out of the Dust of the earth and that
[1:12] represents human life and we use job a
[1:15] lot as an example last time on Wednesday
[1:17] night and just his struggle and um his
[1:19] thoughts on humanity and life he says in
[1:22] Job chapter 14: 1 and two man that is
[1:25] born of a woman is of a few days and
[1:26] full of trouble that's agitation turmoil
[1:29] it's it's a trembling it's a raging uh
[1:32] when I was studying the word it just to
[1:33] me life is just boiling just constant
[1:36] boil constant pressure and I kind of use
[1:38] the thought in my mind life is like a
[1:39] pressure cooker that uh eventually the
[1:42] moisture runs out and we just get burned
[1:44] to a crisp and we we go right back to
[1:46] ashes again we go right back to dust but
[1:48] he said man is just a born of a woman is
[1:50] of a few days and full of trouble he
[1:52] cometh forth like a flower and is cut
[1:54] down he fleeth also as a shadow andth
[1:57] not that's life is but a vapor just a
[1:59] Mist it's just a smoke and no matter how
[2:02] long you live when you compare our
[2:03] lifespan to even those of the of the in
[2:06] the Old Testament realize our life is
[2:07] just a very small slice we come and we
[2:10] go and what is what is man what's left
[2:12] of him when he's done and just memories
[2:14] and there's a lot that we could expound
[2:16] upon just how fragile life is and H and
[2:19] just how we are just dust as it were
[2:22] scripturally but one statement I want to
[2:24] repeat to you is from the sermon letting
[2:26] off the pressure and brother Bram we
[2:29] read this he says it's just becoming a
[2:30] neurotic age everybody's all built up
[2:33] haven't got no time and that builds up
[2:36] to a place that it breaks up things it
[2:38] causes people to have hard feelings when
[2:41] they snap them off and say things you
[2:42] don't mean to say now everybody's guilty
[2:45] of it I'm guilty you're all guilty we do
[2:49] things under pressure that we wouldn't
[2:50] do otherwise and there's an excess
[2:52] pressure built up today that you
[2:55] sometimes you read these statements so
[2:57] that you get everybody on the same page
[2:58] I don't think anybody should disag agree
[3:00] with this I imagine even the youngest
[3:01] ones here like yeah pressure these days
[3:03] man I got homework my mom's making me
[3:05] make the bed you know I don't get to
[3:07] take naps anymore whatever it might be
[3:08] there just might be some things it's
[3:09] like pressure is building I think we can
[3:11] all relate to this and things just it's
[3:14] just coming on us this pressure and if
[3:16] you don't have the proper ventilation if
[3:18] you don't have the proper vent to that
[3:20] it causes us to blow up and it causes us
[3:23] to build builds up and we snap and he
[3:24] says we do things and remember this
[3:27] under this kind of pressure you act act
[3:30] in ways you otherwise wouldn't act and
[3:33] sometimes you get experience people
[3:34] under certain situations and they
[3:36] manifest something like oh I didn't know
[3:37] they were like that I could say in their
[3:39] defense they're not really like that but
[3:41] something made them do it they snapped
[3:44] they came to a point they acted out of
[3:46] character and I can say this just by my
[3:48] own testimony and a time in my life when
[3:50] things were just coming under a lot of
[3:52] pressure it became evident to me what
[3:54] the impact it was having on me when I be
[3:56] to act out of character I this isn't
[3:59] that's not how I think that's not how I
[4:00] process things that's not the way I
[4:02] should be responding so it's really to
[4:04] us a warning sign when we begin to snap
[4:06] and we do things we wouldn't normally do
[4:08] Under Pressure he says before I go any
[4:11] further I might say this and I'm so glad
[4:13] he does I believe it's the enemy coming
[4:14] down and pressing I believe it's the
[4:17] devil so it's that adversary who's
[4:19] walking about who makes due use of every
[4:21] opportunity to squeeze you wants to put
[4:24] you in that press he's you got a Punch
[4:26] coming so he's looking to put you under
[4:28] pressure to get you overthinking to get
[4:30] you reacting and we know the coming of
[4:31] the Lord is at hand and the Bible said
[4:33] in the last days the devil would go
[4:35] about like a roaring lion and if he
[4:37] could get you under pressure hurrying
[4:39] running over something you'll make
[4:41] decisions that you wouldn't make if you
[4:43] sit down and think it over now there's
[4:45] that contrast of being under pressure
[4:48] and life is boiling it's raging and this
[4:50] this natural life is just a constant
[4:53] turmoil a constant pressure but what we
[4:55] talked about before is how we could come
[4:57] to Christ and that we could let off the
[4:59] pressure in Christ as we reading our
[5:02] family devotion this week thy loving
[5:03] kindness is better than life and brother
[5:05] Braman thirsting for Life says wait how
[5:07] can something be better in life and he
[5:09] said there must be two different kinds
[5:10] of life and this life is pressure but
[5:13] his life is release this life is burdens
[5:16] and turmoil and anxiety and blowing up
[5:19] but his life is peace and a and love
[5:22] everlasting and it just it's a relief in
[5:24] Christ so Christ is who we come to to
[5:27] relieve this pressure amen and so
[5:30] despite that pressure we were using a
[5:32] lot just out of dust and God's going to
[5:34] take us out of dust and we use job as an
[5:36] example and he says in job 29:18 then I
[5:39] said I shall die in my nest and I shall
[5:42] multiply my days as the sand and a lot
[5:45] of translations render that I'll
[5:46] multiply my days as the phoenix bird and
[5:49] so job in referring to this is it's an
[5:51] emblem of the Resurrection this is an
[5:53] emblem of redemption I know my redeemer
[5:55] liveth and though this body be reduced
[5:58] to dust one day I'm I'm going to come
[6:00] back I'm going to come forth as a
[6:02] phoenix bird that phoenix bird Burns in
[6:04] the fire but that is Born Again from its
[6:06] own ashes and Rises up again it's saying
[6:08] we'll Rise Again death doesn't even have
[6:11] victory over us if this body dissolves
[6:13] and if this body is broken down and this
[6:15] body it Wast away it's it's going to
[6:17] come back again I I've got to apologize
[6:20] I meant to welcome Lucas and Haley as
[6:22] well but just I got sidetracked by Judah
[6:25] so we can blame it on my cousin how's
[6:27] that but it's so good to see Lucas and
[6:29] Haley Haley coffee here God bless you
[6:32] now you get a shout out that's going to
[6:33] make the cut too everybody else is going
[6:35] to get cut off in the archives you're
[6:36] right in the middle of all of it should
[6:38] I start over 5 4 3 2 1 edit there we go
[6:44] but the the phoenix bird uh it would
[6:46] even in this mythology it would make its
[6:48] own nest and there in that Nest he says
[6:50] I shall die in my Nest it's an illusion
[6:52] to that bird and there it would burn up
[6:54] it would die it be reduced to ashes but
[6:56] it rises up again from the Flames as it
[6:58] were Rises up from the ash is to live
[7:00] again and and that's that's an image to
[7:02] us that job is pointing to about being
[7:05] redeemed and being restored even when
[7:07] something is reduced to Rubble even when
[7:10] something's been completely destroyed oh
[7:12] my testimony is a mess my life's a mess
[7:14] I I I I it's completely been reduced to
[7:17] Rubble reduced to ashes in other words
[7:19] it's not that you've made a mess of your
[7:21] finances you've made a mess of your of
[7:23] your body with drug addictions you've
[7:25] been burned to ashes you've been buried
[7:27] you've died God's able to redeem
[7:30] God's able to restore so where we ended
[7:32] was how on God has a plan of redemption
[7:36] God has a promise to restore us and so
[7:39] my my title has been in my heart just
[7:41] out of dust into heaven and so tonight I
[7:44] just want to look on this into heaven
[7:45] but I've put in parentheses Christ
[7:48] because it this it's just this image of
[7:50] Christ being that place where we can let
[7:52] go this place place where we are
[7:54] relieved it could have been out of dust
[7:56] into the temple it could have been out
[7:58] of dust into a number of things but it's
[8:00] a state of perfection it's being in
[8:02] Christ it's becoming
[8:04] Christlike and and I believe it's a
[8:07] place where if you're dust uh maybe if
[8:09] we're in the dust and David talks about
[8:11] how I I cleave to the dust and I'm drawn
[8:14] down and I look down and I can't even
[8:16] lift up my head and he's talking about
[8:18] this depression and this melanchon this
[8:20] weight that brought him low to the Earth
[8:23] but I believe that even if we find
[8:24] ourselves in the dust we've got reason
[8:26] to be positive cuz he's going to take us
[8:29] out of dust if even if we're ashes he's
[8:31] promised he'll take us out of ashes and
[8:33] bring us back again and this is the
[8:36] promise that's given in Joel chapter 2
[8:39] as we've read it we're all very familiar
[8:40] with it uh as students of the message
[8:43] and usually with the Wednesday night
[8:45] crowd you have the benefit of those who
[8:46] are in the word themselves not just on
[8:48] Sundays and Wednesdays but they're in
[8:50] the word and so they know these things
[8:52] they they're familiar with them but the
[8:54] scripture refers to this process of
[8:57] Destruction through the king the Locust
[9:00] the canker worm the caterpillar and the
[9:02] Palmer worm and brother Braham gives a
[9:04] lot of attention to these things in the
[9:06] message of the hour and how they brought
[9:08] destruction and it was this process that
[9:10] ultimately yields death and God is
[9:13] saying I will restore so there has been
[9:16] this process of Destruction and Ultimate
[9:19] Death no more fruitfulness it's this the
[9:20] vine dies and it's why he says fear not
[9:23] to the land and fear not to the Beast
[9:25] because those things that have been
[9:26] wasted and laid waste I'll bring back
[9:28] again it'll spring forth and I'll bring
[9:31] the the former and latter rain upon the
[9:32] Earth I'm going to bring them together a
[9:34] and and it's going to bring forth a
[9:36] great uh triumphant Harvest and so
[9:39] there's a great promise to Israel and
[9:40] there's a beautiful promise of the
[9:42] Redemption of the body of Christ his
[9:44] bride but it's an illus it's he's a
[9:47] pointing to a time where what has been
[9:49] torn up what has been brought down and
[9:51] reduced to ashes will be raised up again
[9:55] and we see it's emblematic where there's
[9:57] a teaching rain that goes forth and then
[9:58] there's a harvest rain that these very
[10:00] things the the the harvesting of crops
[10:03] and wheat and fruit speaks of a Rapture
[10:06] so it's a it speaks of a translation it
[10:08] speaks of Us coming to the ultimate of
[10:11] redemption now if you could see what God
[10:13] is saying fear not and be glad for the
[10:16] Lord will do great things the these
[10:19] these this Locust in these stages
[10:21] brother talks about the same insect has
[10:23] torn everything down a and and you look
[10:26] at it says I'll never get a harvest
[10:28] again I'll never get fruit when will
[10:29] never be able to enjoy these things and
[10:30] there's maybe some uh sadness as you see
[10:34] that scene we were painting a similar
[10:36] picture last Wednesday night I think
[10:37] it's when it dawned on me that I thought
[10:39] I was going to be a great encouragement
[10:40] and then realized three quter of the way
[10:41] through all I've been doing is talking
[10:43] about job and realize man you know if
[10:46] you're trying to compare make people
[10:48] happy by saying hey at least you're not
[10:49] job it's probably not going to work
[10:52] right like well job didn't have a car
[10:55] job didn't have to worry about a
[10:56] mortgage right I mean there's we'd have
[10:58] a way just to think that had it easy but
[11:01] still there is it was something when we
[11:04] compare as we went through those steps
[11:05] on Wednesday night and think about life
[11:07] and how hard it is and what we endure
[11:09] and what we go through right this life
[11:11] is very um there's a Darkness to this
[11:14] life there's a Darkness to this age that
[11:15] we're living in and it's a reality of
[11:17] human existence as the Bible describes
[11:19] this as um ashes to ashes dust to dust
[11:22] and we're all uh just going to
[11:24] eventually back end up in a grave as
[11:26] it's alluding to it says in Isaiah
[11:28] chapter 64 vers 6 but we are all as an
[11:31] unclean thing and all our righteousness
[11:33] are as filthy rags it' be one thing for
[11:36] him to say we're just all an unclean
[11:38] thing but then to say even our
[11:39] righteousness is as filthy rags it says
[11:42] no matter what we're doing to be good no
[11:43] matter how what kind of morality we
[11:45] might have and integrity we think we
[11:47] might have it's just all doesn't compare
[11:49] to the glory of God and being sinful
[11:52] creatures it's not going to change
[11:53] anything says and we all we all do Fade
[11:56] as a leaf and our iniquities Like the
[11:58] Wind have taken us away this is the
[12:01] reality of humanity this is what we are
[12:04] uh this is the reality of sin this is
[12:06] just the reality of our existence a man
[12:08] born of a woman is born in sin in sin
[12:11] did my mother conceive me the psalmist
[12:13] says that we come forth into this world
[12:16] with the stain of sin upon us where as
[12:18] an unclean thing any good we do as
[12:20] unclean creatures is still as a filthy
[12:23] rag because it carries with it the
[12:25] stain it is we are just dust moved about
[12:29] by whims we're moved about by Nature
[12:31] we're moved about by the the shifting
[12:33] sands of time this is just life for
[12:36] us in Psalms 102: 1
[12:40] to14 originally I kind of had some of
[12:42] these things just put together thinking
[12:44] we might just do a study in scripture go
[12:46] back and read U all of this Psalm it
[12:48] speaks of the prophesies of this end
[12:50] time but I wanted just to take the first
[12:52] 14 verses it says a prayer of The
[12:54] Afflicted when he is overwhelmed and
[12:57] porth out his complaint before the Lord
[12:59] Lord and just now somebody has made this
[13:01] their favorite
[13:02] Scripture A Prayer of The Afflicted when
[13:04] he's overwhelmed and porth out his
[13:06] complaint before the Lord hear my prayer
[13:09] oh Lord and let my cry come unto thee so
[13:12] this is this supplication this crying
[13:13] out from one who is Afflicted he feels
[13:16] overwhelmed and he's pouring out in his
[13:18] complaint it's not like a you know a
[13:20] survey you fill out or you you want to
[13:22] you want to return something we got
[13:25] grievances it's not necessarily that but
[13:27] just your situation your your your
[13:30] status what you're going through hear my
[13:32] prayer Lord and let my cry come unto
[13:34] thee hide not thy face from me in the
[13:36] day when I am in trouble well life am
[13:39] Mana is just a full day a few days and
[13:41] full of trouble and it says incline thy
[13:45] ear unto me in the day when I call
[13:47] answer me speedily that's a language
[13:50] that Jesus uses when he talks about uh
[13:52] the just crying out to Christ and the
[13:56] the righteous saying oh Lord avenge us
[13:58] the elect crying says I will avenge them
[14:00] speedily H there's something about our
[14:02] cries that go up to him and the Prisoner
[14:05] as the scripture comes to we're be we're
[14:07] locked up in a prison we're Bound by
[14:09] death and we have this this appointment
[14:11] with death that's coming so we're bound
[14:13] up in this flesh we're bound up in this
[14:15] dust and we're crying out Loose us oh
[14:17] Lord loose us who will deliver me from
[14:19] the body of this death says for my days
[14:22] are consumed like smoke and my B bones
[14:25] are burned as a hear here's this image
[14:28] of just the hardness of life and even
[14:30] what it ends in my heart is smitten and
[14:32] withered like grass so that I forget to
[14:34] eat my bread by reason of the voice of
[14:37] my groaning my bones cleave to my skin I
[14:41] am like a pelican of the Wilderness I'm
[14:43] like an owl of the desert so much
[14:45] imagery being offered to us in this a
[14:48] pelican of the Wilderness an owl of the
[14:50] desert there's there's maybe something
[14:51] in congruent with the image that he's
[14:53] thinking of and there's some despairing
[14:56] of life there's something that's lacking
[14:58] I watch and him as a sparrow alone upon
[15:01] the Housetop mine enemies reproach me
[15:04] all the day and they that are mad
[15:06] against me are sworn against me for I
[15:09] have eaten ashes like bread and mingled
[15:11] my drink with weeping because of thine
[15:13] indignation and thy wrath for for thou
[15:16] Hast Lifted Me Up and cast me down my
[15:19] days are like a shadow that Decline and
[15:22] I'm withered like grass are you
[15:24] encouraged
[15:26] yet somebody's reading job's diary
[15:30] but now the scene's going to change says
[15:33] but thou oh Lord shalt endure forever
[15:35] and thy remembrance into all generations
[15:37] I love how it sets the scene for us so
[15:39] we can understand just the beauty of the
[15:41] prophecy if man wasn't full of sin and
[15:45] condemned to be lost I I mean really
[15:47] just how excited would people be about a
[15:49] savior if Israel hadn't been in bondage
[15:51] just and the and the kingdom was perfect
[15:53] and they had great glorious Kings how
[15:54] excited would have they been about a
[15:55] messiah so it has to appropriately paint
[15:58] this picture of this Doom and Gloom not
[16:01] as a a misrepresentation but just the
[16:04] reality of how we live and our lives it
[16:07] paints that picture but now it mentions
[16:09] Lord You're great you endure forever
[16:11] your remembrance unto all generations
[16:13] Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon
[16:16] Zion for the time to favor her yay the
[16:19] set time is come and and this as this is
[16:23] prophesied of of Israel we know that the
[16:26] bride she's to come on the scene in the
[16:28] in the last days and there's a time and
[16:30] a place that's appointed for her to rise
[16:33] and so Zion is even a reference to the
[16:35] bride brother bam says in one place it's
[16:37] always the bride so there's some
[16:39] application to us as his Gentile bride
[16:41] and as the body of Christ though she may
[16:44] be able to say as as a prayer of The
[16:46] Afflicted she may be able to say as one
[16:48] that's overwhelmed one that's suffered
[16:50] one that's gone through church ages one
[16:52] that's been torn away one that's been
[16:54] brought to the ground and goes back into
[16:55] the ground the Lord will arise and have
[16:57] mercy on Zion there will come a time for
[17:00] him to have grace and favor upon her
[17:02] amen for thy servants take pleasure in
[17:05] her stones and favor the dust
[17:08] thereof so here is a
[17:11] prophecy not so much at the moment that
[17:13] it's going to be completed but even at a
[17:16] time when it's completely in Ruins and
[17:19] it's been reduced to dust he said thy
[17:22] servants take pleasure in their Stones
[17:23] they're looking upon them they're
[17:24] considering them and they even have
[17:27] mercy and pity upon the dust that there
[17:30] there's a love for it there's a longing
[17:32] for it there's a burden for it and
[17:34] looking at it it's like oh I I I'm not
[17:37] dismissive of the Dust I'm not
[17:39] dismissive of the rubble what it used to
[17:42] represent what it could have been all
[17:44] the glory that was referred to it
[17:46] there's some connection it has with it
[17:48] and this the writer using it in the
[17:50] sense to kind of take the picture oh I
[17:52] know something's going to happen because
[17:54] even your servant's eyes are turned to
[17:56] the dust there's even a a longing and a
[17:58] burn it has for the rubble and and if I
[18:01] could say this about whatever condition
[18:02] your life is in I don't despise it don't
[18:06] disregard it don't don't walk don't
[18:08] necessarily Walk Away From the Ashes and
[18:10] say it's all run but look at the dust
[18:12] and know that God is able to bring
[18:14] Beauty out of the rubble he's able to
[18:16] build
[18:18] again beauti if God could make man out
[18:21] of dust if man was made from ashes then
[18:24] you you know that God has all the
[18:26] material he needs to bring forth
[18:28] something glorious
[18:30] and so here's the great prophecy of
[18:32] though this darkness of Affliction and
[18:34] being overwhelmed God is able to raise
[18:36] up from the dust and redeem Zion if you
[18:41] continue to read this's beautiful
[18:42] prophecy contained in Psalms 102 it's
[18:45] one of my favorite chapters not because
[18:48] of verse one in the
[18:50] intro but Ezekiel chapter 37 verses 1 to
[18:53] 14 as well there's a so much in this I'm
[18:57] just wanting to preach it and not stop
[18:59] too much on this but it's just so
[19:02] chocked full but here we see another
[19:04] image of something coming out of dust
[19:07] says the hand of the Lord was upon me
[19:09] and carried me out in the spirit of the
[19:10] Lord and set me down in the midst of the
[19:12] valley which was full of
[19:14] Bones and so this is an image of death
[19:17] and not just death but long death to
[19:18] where it's not a rotting corpse but it's
[19:20] been reduced to bones and caused me to
[19:23] pass by them roundout and behold there
[19:24] were very many in the open Valley and he
[19:27] says and lo they were very dry there was
[19:30] no strength in them uh they would have
[19:33] been maybe breaking up and brittle so
[19:36] he's wanting to say these are dry
[19:38] there's no there's no strength in them
[19:39] it's not recent but these are those that
[19:41] have been dead for some time and he said
[19:44] unto me son of man can these bones live
[19:47] so it's the hand of the Lord that brings
[19:48] him to this place shows him this Valley
[19:50] full of Bones and he deduces from it in
[19:52] the way that he's shown it that these
[19:53] are very very dry these bodies are long
[19:56] dead they've been reduced to maybe I and
[19:58] I'm just trying to speculate and make it
[20:00] fit my prior title but maybe they're
[20:01] dusting a little bit maybe they're
[20:03] brittle maybe they're breaking and the
[20:05] the he's asked this question the spirit
[20:07] of the Lord ask him a question can these
[20:09] bones
[20:11] live and he's got the right answer in
[20:13] verse in the next statement he says and
[20:15] I answered oh Lord God thou
[20:19] knowest and what a statement it's not I
[20:22] just love even uh the confidence in God
[20:26] uh to say that uh you know well if you
[20:28] were just if it was up to me of course
[20:30] not H uh bones don't live and uh um and
[20:34] these things this just isn't common but
[20:35] he says Lord you know so there's some
[20:38] difference to a God who has the power
[20:40] just like uh Lazarus sister said oh uh
[20:43] even now Lord I know that whatsoever you
[20:45] ask we could have that there's some
[20:47] there's some belief that With God all
[20:49] things are possible and I answered oh
[20:52] Lord thou knowest in verse four and he
[20:53] said unto me prophesy upon these bones
[20:56] and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear
[21:00] the word of the Lord now I want you to
[21:02] key in on that what's the secret of dead
[21:06] Dry Bones what what can have an impact
[21:09] on ashes what can have an impact on the
[21:11] dust what is it that can take a lump of
[21:13] clay what is it that can take a handful
[21:15] of dust what is it where is the power
[21:18] what does it reside in oh ye Dry Bones
[21:21] hear the word of the Lord thus sayith
[21:23] the Lord God un these bones behold I
[21:26] will cause breath to enter into you and
[21:28] ye shall live that that's the fullness
[21:31] of the statement prophesy hear in the
[21:33] word of the Lord bones and this is what
[21:35] you're going to see breath will enter in
[21:37] and you shall live and then it kind of
[21:39] steps back a little bit to describe it
[21:41] and I'll lay senes upon you and I'll
[21:43] bring up flesh upon you and cover you
[21:45] with skin and put breath in you and you
[21:48] shall live and you shall know that I am
[21:50] the Lord notice how he says hear the
[21:52] word and you're going to live then it
[21:54] kind of gives more description to the
[21:56] process so he says so I prophesied as I
[21:58] was commanded and as I prophesied there
[22:01] was a noise and behold the shaking and
[22:04] the bones came together bone to his bone
[22:07] and when I beheld lo the Senus and the
[22:09] flesh came up upon them and the skin
[22:12] covered them above but there was no
[22:14] breath in
[22:15] them now this is the the stage at which
[22:18] God brought Ezekiel to the valley was
[22:21] not at this point because just maybe
[22:24] some conjecture here had the hand of the
[22:26] Lord been upon Ezekiel and the spirit of
[22:28] the Lord takes him out to the valley and
[22:30] he said I saw h a uh people and I saw
[22:33] them I saw the Flesh of man arrayed a
[22:36] certain way and I saw them dressed and I
[22:38] saw the skin uh his the image would have
[22:41] been very different but now this goes
[22:43] from dry bones to flesh with senu they
[22:47] would have been upright skin covered
[22:49] them and the only thing that he could
[22:51] remark is that there was no breath in
[22:53] them because he knew that God said Not
[22:56] only would I lay Senus upon you and
[22:58] bring flesh upon you and cover you with
[23:00] skin but I was going to breathe he knew
[23:02] there was a promise that he wasn't just
[23:04] directing a lifel likee statues he was
[23:07] going to bring forth something that
[23:09] would have breath something that would
[23:11] have life so he says there's no breath
[23:12] in them so despite those stages of
[23:15] restoration there still was something
[23:18] else to happen listen I say it today to
[23:21] not don't stop short of a total
[23:24] Deliverance don't stop short of the full
[23:26] promise we said well there will was dry
[23:29] bones and now Bones have come together
[23:30] and senu and tendons have come and skins
[23:32] come back I I'm happy just to have skin
[23:35] no if God promised you breath you don't
[23:37] stop till you get the breath if God's
[23:40] promised you 100 you stay with it until
[23:43] you get
[23:44] 100 I think it was someone at the Mesa
[23:46] Church who wrote the song 99 and a half
[23:48] won't do I I I I don't want to sell
[23:51] myself short of his
[23:53] promises and it said in verse n then he
[23:56] said he unto me prophesy un the wind
[23:58] prophesy son of man and say to the wind
[24:00] so notice the what the the very thing
[24:02] that's going to bring these things to
[24:03] pass thus sayith the Lord God come from
[24:05] the Four Winds oh breathe and breathe
[24:08] upon the slain that they may live they'd
[24:11] been slain they'd been reduced to ashes
[24:13] but now they come back up to this
[24:15] process of restoration and for some
[24:17] people that might have been good
[24:19] enough if people just look they'll think
[24:21] it's a
[24:22] church just get him to look the
[24:26] part so I prophesied verse 10 as he
[24:30] commanded me I love how there's this
[24:32] image of a prophet bringing the word of
[24:34] God as he's commanded and it's in with
[24:37] that Dynamic that says and the breath
[24:40] came into them and they lived and stood
[24:44] upon their feet an exceeding great Army
[24:47] we know that with true Revelation the
[24:49] bride will be an invincible Army it says
[24:52] and the breath came into them and they
[24:55] lived and not only did they live they
[24:57] stood on their feet and became an
[24:59] exceeding great Army this breathing is
[25:04] it points us to the Breath of God all
[25:07] scriptures given by the Breath of God
[25:09] the inspiration of God to where there's
[25:10] a there's a breath of God that goes
[25:12] forth and therefore as God is giving
[25:14] breath you breathe that in and the word
[25:17] of God is God's breath the word of God
[25:19] comes from his mouth but as you eat that
[25:21] word you're breathing in God that breath
[25:24] you're breathing in his life you're
[25:25] breathing in his in his inspiration and
[25:28] the Breath of God Goes Forth the
[25:31] inspiration of God goes forth and he
[25:33] breathes but it's not just getting lost
[25:35] in The Ether it's it's mouth to mouth
[25:38] it's Life coming into your lungs it it's
[25:41] power it's the it's the supernatural
[25:44] power of God it's the life of God being
[25:47] breathed and you don't just feel it you
[25:49] breathe it
[25:50] in and it being breathed in life comes
[25:53] in and it animates you to be an
[25:55] invincible Army an exceeding great
[25:59] Army and I want to continue to read to
[26:01] verse 14 then he said unto me son of man
[26:04] these bones are the whole house of
[26:07] Israel behold they say our bones are
[26:10] dried and our hope is lost we are cut
[26:13] off cut off from our parts now this is
[26:16] this is the it's kind of as we read it
[26:19] this way that this is the way it begins
[26:20] just like Psalms 102 and you see a
[26:23] connection between those this is this is
[26:25] job on his Ash Heap this is this is that
[26:27] oh her bones are dried our hope is lost
[26:29] we're cut off from our parts Israel is
[26:31] separated everything's in disarray he
[26:33] says therefore prophesy and say unto
[26:35] them thus sayith the Lord God behold oh
[26:38] my people I'll open your Graves and
[26:41] cause you to come up out of your Graves
[26:43] and bring you into the land of Israel
[26:46] and ye shall know that I am the Lord
[26:48] when I have opened your Graves oh my
[26:51] people and brought you up out of your
[26:53] Graves now we know that brother Brandon
[26:55] when he preaches the seals and we have
[26:57] the overview of the church Church age
[26:58] book that brother Brown is saying that
[26:59] the church was dead she is in a grave as
[27:03] it were and even when we come up to the
[27:05] time of the seals he says she's still
[27:06] dead as a door now and there's been no
[27:09] manifestation of God to wake her up if I
[27:11] could put this way breathe into her the
[27:13] breath of life and cause her to stand on
[27:15] her feet as an invincible Army and he
[27:18] talks about how what a resurrection this
[27:20] is so there's a resurrection out of the
[27:23] grave of dark denominationalism there's
[27:24] a resurrection out of sin there's a
[27:26] resurrection out of Leo DEA and this
[27:29] promise to Israel has a beautiful
[27:30] spiritual types to the bride and a very
[27:33] literal type to all the redeemed who
[27:35] will come up out of the graves at the
[27:37] time of the great translation says and I
[27:39] shall and shall put my spirit in you and
[27:41] you shall live and I shall place you in
[27:44] your own land then shall you know that I
[27:46] that I the Lord have spoken it and
[27:48] performed it sayith the Lord he will
[27:51] cause the dry bones to live again though
[27:53] the valley may be full of dry bones
[27:56] though it may wander through a spiritual
[27:57] desert though might seem to be forsaken
[28:00] there will come a time when the valley
[28:02] is no more dry bones when God pours out
[28:05] his spirit in such a way where it's the
[28:07] word of God being received into his body
[28:10] to animate her and to cause her to
[28:13] stand and be an exceeding great Army
[28:17] because God promised he will
[28:20] restore and the restoration of the brid
[28:22] tree brother Bram is taking a lot from
[28:24] Joel chapter
[28:25] 2 and he's going through the steps of
[28:28] showing that there were four different
[28:31] stages of the
[28:33] destruction and how that it was
[28:35] Locust and then cankerworm caterpillar
[28:38] and
[28:38] palmerworm and that it was he calls them
[28:41] four death Messengers and each one
[28:43] eating away different parts he goes into
[28:45] great details in this in this sermon
[28:48] restoration of the brid tree and other
[28:49] places and and I had a lot I wanted to
[28:52] read to and I think we're doing awesome
[28:54] on time and uh and so I'm just going to
[28:58] I'll try not going try to go quickly but
[29:00] I'm not going to belabor some things
[29:01] here and I'll just come to this part
[29:03] where he says four Killers took it four
[29:05] Messengers destroyed it four messengers
[29:08] of death took it away in
[29:10] dogmas so now there's this stage of
[29:13] Destruction he says four messengers of
[29:16] righteousness restore it
[29:18] back now to this point in the sermon and
[29:21] some of the things I'm skipping over
[29:23] where's a lot of references to Joel 2 a
[29:25] and the four death Messengers and then
[29:27] he's also referring to he comes back to
[29:29] it again he for refers to four life
[29:31] Messengers and I love it when you get to
[29:33] four because a lot of people who only
[29:35] add by threes all of a sudden you get to
[29:37] four and it's like wait a minute wait a
[29:38] minute
[29:40] stop uh but we don't ever use numerology
[29:44] to leave the word right we just we just
[29:46] want the word types Shadows numerology
[29:49] isn't what's so important it's the truth
[29:51] that's important and so here is a truth
[29:53] that we could see in the word of God now
[29:55] brother Bram says he's he's been looking
[29:57] at Joel too but now he says prophesy son
[30:00] of man can these bones live prophesy can
[30:03] these bones live now he has taken Joel
[30:06] to and this process of Destruction and
[30:09] he begins to marry it with Ezekiel
[30:12] 37 and and and you could even you could
[30:15] even begin to see that there was these
[30:17] stages of Bones coming together senu
[30:19] being added then skin and there was this
[30:22] noise and shaking and there's this
[30:24] restoration that takes place where you
[30:25] have what looks like bodies and people
[30:28] but then the Observer the prophet says
[30:30] there's no breath in them and brother
[30:33] brandham is now bringing Joel to where
[30:35] had four death Messengers and he
[30:37] connects it to Ezekiel 37 he says what's
[30:40] the four stages of the coming forth of
[30:42] that church what is the four stages of
[30:45] ezekiel's dry bones coming forth so this
[30:48] is the prophet kind of tying these two
[30:50] things together he says but the life
[30:52] only come not when the senu skin was on
[30:55] them but when the wind blow upon them
[30:59] that's when it come back that fourth
[31:03] message of life was brought back I will
[31:06] restore sayith the Lord he says
[31:09] hallelujah Glory praise be to God and I
[31:11] I second that he says the fourth light
[31:14] is to come that will bring forth the
[31:17] same
[31:19] signs justification brought back the
[31:21] pulp sanctification brought back the
[31:23] bark do of doctrine of Holiness what
[31:26] brought back the leaf pentec costals
[31:28] what is it Pentecostals leaves clap
[31:30] their hands Joy rejoicing Pentecostal so
[31:33] there's your three stages of restoration
[31:35] to that point he said the fourth was the
[31:39] word
[31:41] itself there's a lot that we could show
[31:44] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost made
[31:45] way for the Holy Ghost itself that he
[31:47] forms the wheat outside of those three
[31:49] stages that those three stages are
[31:51] critical but he even put the Pentecostal
[31:53] Le toine age as the shook but it's got
[31:56] to come back to see it again we're not
[31:58] creating a doctrine of fors but it's the
[32:00] truth and reality that God uses these
[32:03] three stages but then the ultimate
[32:04] product comes back to the original three
[32:07] stages of restoration but the original
[32:09] is the final climactic this last great
[32:12] step must come into Perfection he
[32:15] said you have repent you have
[32:17] justification sanctification the Seal of
[32:19] God which is the New Birth the baptism
[32:21] of the Holy Ghost those three stages
[32:23] make the new birth but then the last
[32:25] great step is into Perfection we've had
[32:27] the the restoration of the new birth and
[32:30] we've had certain great truths restored
[32:32] to us but there's got to come a bright
[32:34] age to this there's got to come an
[32:35] exodus in Ephesians age of Harvest Time
[32:38] am amen so he says this fourth was the
[32:41] word
[32:43] itself the word made flesh fruits of the
[32:47] proof of the Resurrection sign that
[32:50] Christ has finally I hope you can catch
[32:52] this finally after justification being
[32:55] planted sanctification being planted
[32:58] baptism of the Holy
[33:00] Ghost organizations died out this is the
[33:03] phrase to me that's so beautiful and
[33:04] Christ has again centered himself like
[33:08] that cap of the
[33:10] pyramid this is what it's got to come to
[33:12] that's Christ is the mystery of God
[33:13] revealed places this more uh uh
[33:15] permanently I guess you could say Christ
[33:18] has centered himself like the cap of the
[33:20] pyramid first line justification
[33:23] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[33:25] then coming of the cap he said what is
[33:27] it that Holy Ghost Bunch that maybe that
[33:31] could be a cover band for the believer's
[33:33] songs the Holy Ghost Bunch the Holy
[33:36] Ghost Bunch being honed out so it can
[33:39] fit with the same kind of ministry he
[33:41] had when he went
[33:43] away now then when he comes back it'll
[33:47] catch the whole thing in the Rapture
[33:50] when they're Justified Sanctified and
[33:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ has
[33:54] to come through that and Center himself
[33:56] again on the pyramid
[33:58] he's got to come back and make himself
[34:00] known unite together with it catch it
[34:02] away in a Rapture he says this the
[34:04] pyramid will stand again do what you
[34:07] want with it it's going to stand again I
[34:10] I don't cap it off he'll cap it off
[34:13] reduce it to Rebel it'll stand again he
[34:15] says the house of God will live again
[34:18] this statement has been at the heart now
[34:20] my heart for several months it's been
[34:22] kind of the inspiration even behind
[34:23] preaching on the house of God the house
[34:26] of God will live it again if there was a
[34:29] time where it was thriving and it was
[34:31] busy and everyone was in their place and
[34:32] the god presence of God was being made
[34:34] known and it was glorious and it was
[34:36] beautiful and the kingdom was at its
[34:38] peak and it's reduced to rubble and it's
[34:40] Forsaken and every all its instruments
[34:42] and everything is taken away and broken
[34:44] and the priesthood has fell and it's
[34:46] reduced to rubble and it's reduced to
[34:48] ruins and it's reduced to ashes and dust
[34:50] the house of God will live again carry
[34:54] all its instruments to the four corners
[34:56] of the earth bury in the sea burn it to
[34:59] ashes God will raise it up again he said
[35:02] the tree of life is growing
[35:05] [Music]
[35:06] again I can say it of this bride time
[35:09] this Harvest Time this is the time of
[35:11] redemption this is the time when these
[35:13] things are being
[35:15] restored what he's talking about is
[35:17] coming out of dust into
[35:19] Christ it's a it's a statement that
[35:21] serves my purpose for my titling but he
[35:24] taking it from ruin from the one who's
[35:26] Afflicted and overwhelmed from the
[35:29] oneand whose days are consumed like
[35:31] smoke and groaning as a prisoner who's
[35:34] hated whose days are like a shadow which
[35:37] decline who withered like grass the Lord
[35:40] will behold from heaven will look down
[35:43] from his Sanctuary to loose those
[35:45] appointed to
[35:46] death to build up and to bring forth
[35:51] Zion it's the time when he is going to
[35:53] breathe the word of God into your hearts
[35:57] through the open of the word to bring
[35:58] you back to full life again amen full
[36:03] manifestation in Isaiah chapter 61 veres
[36:06] 1
[36:08] to4 just a few people reached out to me
[36:11] after last Wednesday night just shared
[36:13] some things that came on their heart and
[36:14] it was it was Ezekiel 37 it was Isaiah
[36:17] 61 you could just see there was already
[36:20] this uh part in your hearts like yeah
[36:22] this is what God's
[36:24] doing it says the spirit of the Lord God
[36:27] is upon
[36:28] me because the Lord hath anointed me to
[36:31] preach Good Tidings unto the
[36:33] meek Heath sent me to bind up the
[36:36] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[36:38] captives and the open of the prison to
[36:40] them that are bound you can see some
[36:42] continuity with Psalms 102 you could see
[36:44] so much in here to proclaim the
[36:46] acceptable year of the Lord and in his
[36:49] first coming he
[36:50] stops Jesus doesn't read any further and
[36:54] so there's hundreds of years almost
[36:56] almost 200000 year
[36:58] comma and the day of Vengeance of our
[37:01] God which brother B says this this
[37:05] time this this the preach the acceptable
[37:08] year of the Lord this is related to his
[37:10] first coming now he's still Christ who
[37:11] binds the Brokenhearted who proclaims
[37:13] Liberty the open of the prison to them
[37:14] that are bound but he stopped at the day
[37:16] of Vengeance of our God because that
[37:17] relates to the time we're living in now
[37:20] now the day of Vengeance of our God
[37:22] continues to comfort all that
[37:25] mourn and now there's a new appointment
[37:28] if you read in Psalms 102 I realize now
[37:30] some of the things I cut out in the Book
[37:31] of Psalms might actually leave leave
[37:34] some of this
[37:35] out aren't you glad you have your
[37:41] Bible it says to hear in Psalm verse 20
[37:43] to hear the groan of the prisoner to
[37:45] loose those that are appointed to death
[37:49] and here it says that there's going to
[37:50] be those appointed to death but he says
[37:53] I'm going to appoint unto them that
[37:55] mourn in Zion he changes your
[37:57] appointment amen I had an appointment to
[38:00] get a um a feeling back in I can't
[38:03] remember when it was sometime last year
[38:05] and I had a little bit of a cold and
[38:06] wasn't feeling well so I canceled it and
[38:08] guess
[38:09] what I haven't made a new one right
[38:12] don't you wish you could do that
[38:13] sometimes you can cancel appointments
[38:15] and never have to worry about them again
[38:18] but this is a this is a change of
[38:20] appointment tooed to them that mourn and
[38:22] Zion those that are overwhelmed those
[38:24] that are afflicted those that have been
[38:25] reduced to to Rubble those are mourning
[38:28] repenting in their ashes and dust to
[38:30] give unto them this is your new
[38:32] appointment to give unto them Beauty
[38:34] instead of Ashes the oil of joy for
[38:37] mourning the Garment of Praise for the
[38:39] spirit of heaviness and that's what he
[38:41] wants to do is you're sitting there with
[38:43] the spirit of heaviness covered in this
[38:46] H in sackcloth covered in ashes and
[38:49] you're mourning and you have a spirit of
[38:51] heaviness and you're covered in ashes
[38:53] and he says let me have the ashes for
[38:55] beauty let me have your your mourning
[38:58] with the oil of Joy let me have your
[39:00] heaviness and give you a Garment of
[39:02] Praise what is he going to do what he
[39:04] takes away he gives back something he
[39:06] wants to restore you he wants to
[39:08] exchange he wants to give you a new
[39:10] appointment oh I wonder if any of us
[39:12] tonight are willing to let go of our
[39:14] mourning for the oil of Joy if we're
[39:16] willing to let go of the spirit of
[39:18] heaviness for a Garment of Praise are
[39:20] you willing to let go of the aces for
[39:26] beauty we might be called the tree of
[39:28] righteousness the Trees of Righteousness
[39:31] the tree of life growing again he says
[39:32] it's going to come back to her the Tree
[39:34] of Life That's you we might be called
[39:37] the Trees of Righteousness the planting
[39:39] of the Lord that he might be glorified
[39:43] am and they shall build the old
[39:46] wastes they shall raise up the former
[39:49] desolations and they shall repair the
[39:51] waste cities the desolations of many
[39:55] generations even though it might have
[39:57] been for a long time tored down there
[39:58] will be a people that'll be the
[40:00] restoration the finality of all that's
[40:02] been destroyed all that's been defeated
[40:05] it may be dust but out of dust God
[40:07] raises it
[40:08] up may seem to be just ashes but God can
[40:11] do beautiful things with
[40:12] ashes it's actually going to turn your
[40:15] ashes into
[40:16] Beauty your mourning into joy and your
[40:19] heaviness into
[40:20] praise I would even you know just take
[40:23] some Liberty here at the end of this
[40:24] service to say he's going to turn those
[40:26] ashes
[40:28] into
[40:29] Beauty he's actually going to take your
[40:32] mour and turn it into
[40:34] Joy he's going to take your heaviness
[40:37] and by the spoken word of God make it
[40:41] praise and so the devil tells you we are
[40:43] nothing but ashes mourning and heaviness
[40:45] it's like well those are all the
[40:46] elements of beauty joy and praise those
[40:50] are the things that God uses to produce
[40:52] praise those are the things that God
[40:54] uses to bring joy those are the things
[40:56] that God uses to bring Beauty hey if
[40:58] you're rich in heaviness you're going to
[41:00] be rich in Praise if you're rich in
[41:02] asses you're going to be rich in Beauty
[41:03] all think about it we should not be
[41:06] defeated no matter what it is what's
[41:08] been or what's happened God has made me
[41:10] a promise from Death can come life
[41:13] what's the worst you can do I can murder
[41:15] you kill you burn you up and throw you
[41:17] in grave even from that from the de
[41:20] depths of the sea and from the valley
[41:22] wherever I am I'll hear my name and I'll
[41:25] come forth there's no victory and death
[41:28] there's no power of the
[41:31] Grave because from the waste from the
[41:34] desolations they'll be
[41:36] repair they'll bring a ra they'll be a
[41:38] raising
[41:40] up because that's the God I serve
[41:43] amen thank you Lord
[41:46] Jesus out of dust into heaven I used
[41:48] Heaven just to describe a
[41:50] Perfection a relationship with
[41:53] Christ it was inspired to me as I was
[41:56] studying on Esther too it just connected
[41:58] where vashy is this uh presented kind of
[42:02] as a evil queen refuses her husband and
[42:06] the King says take the throne away and
[42:07] give it to one who's
[42:09] better than vashan and it comes to
[42:12] Esther Esther chapter 2 I believe it is
[42:14] he says and the King chose her brings
[42:17] her to the Royal Palace and she was made
[42:19] Queen said of ashai and when you think
[42:22] about it
[42:24] Esther is one I we think we've shared
[42:26] this before and I think it's just
[42:28] something that's uh in the scripture
[42:29] it's often expressed she her her
[42:31] original Hebrew name was
[42:33] hadessa which is myrtle tree it's
[42:38] Earthbound and and carries with it this
[42:40] and myrr bitterness it speaks of death
[42:43] it's the cycle of life and death
[42:44] represented even in a tree and she's
[42:47] changed from Myrtle tree to Esther which
[42:50] is
[42:51] star and as the as brother bam talks
[42:54] about in some places and as we see in
[42:55] the scripture this image being brought
[42:57] from the dust to the
[42:59] heavens she's brought from a tree to to
[43:02] the
[43:03] heavenlies and this is what God does for
[43:06] us as Humanity we're born of a woman
[43:10] we're just a few days in full of trouble
[43:12] we come into this Earth
[43:14] stained we're not like Adam was in the
[43:17] beginning we're not it's not like it was
[43:19] then our lives are so uned from the
[43:22] reality that God had originally placed
[43:24] it and life is headed it's a it's a
[43:26] raise to a grave
[43:28] everyone's appointed to it but there's
[43:30] this story of redemption that God is
[43:32] going to take us who were Earthbound
[43:35] headed for a grave who Satan even felt
[43:37] he had ownership he argued over the body
[43:39] of Moses because of sin he goes That's
[43:42] my meat I have the right to eat that
[43:45] that's the Serpent's bread I have a
[43:46] right to that body I have a right to
[43:48] that flesh but God says I'm going to
[43:50] bruise crush your head and I'm even
[43:52] going to take those who succumb to death
[43:54] I'm going to raise them up out of their
[43:55] graves and give them glorify bodies and
[43:58] there will be a people who are alive and
[44:00] remain who will not taste death what
[44:03] will but will be changed in a m in a
[44:05] twinkl of an eye and will be exalted
[44:07] from the dust to the Stars
[44:09] amen and brother brandham says where
[44:12] where can we put this woman where can we
[44:13] put her he said she's exalted to the
[44:15] very Throne of God as the only place
[44:19] befitting such a
[44:21] queen from dust to a
[44:24] throne out of dust into heaven into
[44:28] Christ so I I leave you with this
[44:31] lengthy statement from the sermon the
[44:32] absolute or absolute is what it's called
[44:34] is March
[44:36] 4th that's that's a command March
[44:40] 4th and he said in 1963 and if you
[44:43] recall the settings of this and I'd like
[44:44] to get into this in more detail uh later
[44:46] on if the Lord would allow me to he has
[44:49] asked to go speak he's asked to go and
[44:52] uh speak at this prayer meeting because
[44:54] a young man and a young woman were
[44:56] facing the death p
[44:57] penalty and so it was a kind and he had
[45:00] relation to another Minister there the
[45:01] the young man did I believe and so there
[45:03] was just a real urgent time if you could
[45:04] just get this in your minds there's a
[45:05] time where the penalty of death is being
[45:08] held over someone who's guilty in in the
[45:11] eyes of the of the prosecutor who's had
[45:14] there was guilt in his life if we could
[45:16] say that and so brother I'm speaking in
[45:18] this and I don't want you necessarily to
[45:20] get your mind working in that but now
[45:21] just make this very personal as we close
[45:23] on this remember how that we began last
[45:26] Wednesday and remind you today that
[45:27] there's such a pressure that's being
[45:29] built up till you come to a place where
[45:31] you break you snap and you do things
[45:34] that you wouldn't normally
[45:35] do brother Bram says
[45:38] now if in your life you have an absolute
[45:41] you do things ordinarily you would not
[45:45] do okay well I thought that was I
[45:48] thought we were going to end on that one
[45:49] okay well let me let me let me try it
[45:52] another way okay should I take my coat
[45:54] off I'll I'll say it louder
[45:57] oh I know what I can
[46:04] do if your life has an
[46:08] absolute he says you'll do things you
[46:10] would not normally do especially if you
[46:13] have a god- centered life the god-
[46:15] centered life makes a person do things
[46:18] that ordinarily they would not do so
[46:20] there's an opposite to this there's a
[46:23] life that we live that we're forced to
[46:25] do things we otherwise wouldn't normally
[46:27] do it's out of character but there's
[46:29] also a place that you can come in Christ
[46:31] where if I'm in the dirt I'm in the dust
[46:34] and I'm being pressured by this world
[46:35] I'll do things I otherwise wouldn't do
[46:38] but I could also come to him and give V
[46:40] to my frustrations and when I have an
[46:42] absolute and I have a god- centered life
[46:45] it'll make me do things I ordinarily
[46:48] wouldn't do he says very odd peculiar
[46:51] why is a Christian life so odd and
[46:53] peculiar because they're looking to
[46:55] God's word which is almost foreign to
[46:58] the world today that's what we're
[46:59] looking to we're looking to God's word
[47:03] the world sees you burdened the world
[47:04] sees you down in the dust the world sees
[47:06] you on the ash Heap and it's expecting
[47:08] you to curse God it's expecting you to
[47:10] act out of character it would actually
[47:12] say hey buddy I don't mind if you cuss
[47:14] I'd do the same thing it they don't mind
[47:16] it they understand I know why he went
[47:18] crazy I know why he did this they can
[47:19] relate to it but there's a people who
[47:21] could be in that very same circumstance
[47:23] and say you speak like a foolish woman
[47:26] why would I deny am now why would I give
[47:28] up now why would I lose my hope now why
[47:30] would I act like that why would I lose
[47:32] that why would I lose my control why
[47:34] would I give in why would I snap I've
[47:36] got a promise in
[47:40] him job served a God that could turn
[47:43] every single one of those pieces of
[47:44] ashes into everything he had lost he was
[47:48] sitting on a gold
[47:50] mine he says why Christians are odd it's
[47:53] because they're looking to God's word he
[47:55] says now we have a churches we have
[47:57] organizations we have religion oh so
[47:58] much of it around the world but that
[48:00] isn't what I'm talking about I'm talking
[48:03] about an absolute connected with Christ
[48:06] then it makes you an odd person you do
[48:08] odd things your thinking is altogether
[48:12] different than the thinking you once did
[48:15] because you found something that you've
[48:17] anchored a faith in someone that created
[48:21] the heavens and the
[48:23] Earth that his very word itself is
[48:26] creative
[48:27] a God who spoke the world into existence
[48:30] and there's nothing too hard for him I'm
[48:34] I'm just I'm wanting to end on this
[48:35] statement just a way of kind of summing
[48:36] up this out of out of dust into
[48:39] heaven as a way of just to encourage you
[48:42] and just give you something positive to
[48:43] go forward in he said the very word is
[48:46] creative it's a God who spoke the world
[48:47] in existence and there's nothing too
[48:49] hard for him that's what you who are
[48:52] under pressure are looking to and that's
[48:54] why you act odd and do things you
[48:56] ordinarily wouldn't do Under
[48:58] Pressure so you're going to act out of
[49:00] character either way or you're going to
[49:02] do something you wouldn't ordinarily do
[49:04] but it could be negative or it can be
[49:07] positive he says so you're looking to
[49:09] the word you have an absolute where
[49:12] you're connected with Christ where
[49:14] there's nothing too hard for him and
[49:15] listen so it makes you
[49:19] creative yourself because you take his
[49:23] words amen right it makes you creative
[49:26] amen
[49:27] gives you power why because the word has
[49:29] gone forth and you've breathed that in
[49:31] you're connected to it you're tied to it
[49:33] and the word is a thought expressed he
[49:36] said Paul had to go into that state
[49:37] where he had to not a theological
[49:39] experience but he had a personal witness
[49:41] he met God and he knew that he was
[49:42] called of God and nobody had to tell him
[49:44] anything about it he was absolutely sure
[49:46] that God still remained God if the world
[49:49] could just do
[49:50] that remember that group there that
[49:52] night was fearful of death it was coming
[49:54] it was at the doorstep and if this group
[49:56] night set in here could just remember
[49:58] that God is still God and I'm not saying
[50:01] this to those who are in Houston I'm not
[50:03] repeating this to remind people in
[50:04] Houston but I say it to us here tonight
[50:06] if this group could just remember that
[50:09] God is still God there's nothing too
[50:12] hard for him he's the one that created
[50:15] the world by his spoken word and that
[50:17] word is in you and it makes you
[50:20] creative remember that he's still God
[50:22] he's just as able to answer in this case
[50:25] as the in is a of Divine Healing or
[50:27] anything else you recognize just the
[50:30] parallel that we can make now sometimes
[50:32] well God said he's a Healer he'll answer
[50:34] healing and we think that if we're sick
[50:36] God's going to come on the scene and
[50:37] heal our bodies but here was a court
[50:39] case and a trial and the and the the
[50:42] possibility of a death sentence he says
[50:44] he's able to answer in matters like this
[50:46] just like he is in Divine Healing so we
[50:48] could just take that and extend it out
[50:50] whatever it is he cares if it concerns
[50:52] you he will perfect that which
[50:54] concerneth you that God is mind ful of
[50:57] what you're going through if I could say
[50:58] this if God's servants would favor the
[51:00] dust if they would look favorable upon
[51:02] the ruins then what do you think God
[51:04] thinks when he looks at you he sees in
[51:06] you the beauty of that New Jerusalem he
[51:09] sees the purchase he sees the Power he
[51:11] sees the glory he sees the beauty he's
[51:14] not giving up on
[51:19] you and he says by I can do this I can
[51:21] heal you I can raise you up whatever it
[51:23] might be says he's still
[51:25] God in the case of divine Hill or
[51:27] anything else he's still God and if we
[51:30] can build our hopes not only our hopes
[51:33] but a positive thought upon what he says
[51:36] amen invite the musicians to come and we
[51:39] know that it is the truth amen and
[51:42] people act
[51:43] funny think of this think this this is
[51:46] the part just coming to I know it's
[51:48] lengthy uh we're not going to get into
[51:50] an after hour tonight so we're just
[51:51] right here in this moment he says they
[51:54] seem to just forget about the negative
[51:57] side because they found an absolute
[52:01] because it's the word of God can I just
[52:03] challenge you with that tonight am
[52:06] there's a little bit of a reflection in
[52:07] here they seem to forget the negative
[52:11] side I just wanted to say it to me I
[52:14] want to forget the negative side I know
[52:17] I spent a lot of time in these last two
[52:19] Services talking a lot about the
[52:20] negative side but we've got to come to a
[52:22] place where we just seem to forget the
[52:25] negative side because we found an
[52:28] absolute and you say well forgetting I
[52:31] can't do that well that CU that's
[52:33] divine
[52:34] right to to forgive is human to
[52:38] forget is
[52:41] divine says forget about the negative
[52:43] side because they found an absolute
[52:45] Jesus said heavens and earth will pass
[52:47] away but my word shall never fail so if
[52:50] he got the Word of Promise then there's
[52:53] no failing to it it cannot fail
[52:57] so I'm believing that that's what the
[52:59] prayer meetings here the religious
[53:00] people of Houston are interested in
[53:02] human
[53:02] lives and that's what we're gathered
[53:05] here for is to call on a power that's
[53:08] beyond all man-made laws and
[53:10] Powers something who could change the
[53:13] hearts of men like he did Pharaoh in
[53:15] Egypt and he's still God Amen but he
[53:19] says this to these people in desperation
[53:21] and maybe people so closely connected to
[53:23] it there there was maybe a lot of fear
[53:25] and maybe too much aware of the
[53:27] situation he says and we must stop now
[53:30] looking at the negative side and go to
[53:34] looking at the positive
[53:35] side and that's what I want us to do
[53:38] turn our eyes to Heaven turn our eyes to
[53:40] the word of God turn our eyes to Jesus
[53:43] Christ away from the negative side let
[53:45] our eyes behold heaven let her eyes
[53:48] behold his Beauty let her eyes behold
[53:50] his
[53:51] Perfection for I am no longer Earthbound
[53:53] I'm no longer dustbound but but I have
[53:56] be G to
[53:57] rise my my heart is set on Heaven I I'm
[54:01] like that boy who's holding on to a kite
[54:03] I can feel something tugging on the
[54:05] other side the morning uh the sunlight
[54:08] has risen and I feel something pulsating
[54:11] within me this is the day to rise and
[54:14] shine for my light has come and I'm not
[54:17] left in Le de I'm not Earthbound I'm not
[54:20] discouraged I'm not defeated my flesh
[54:23] may feel so and there might be a lot of
[54:25] negative side but oh God help me tonight
[54:28] may I be one who can look to you and
[54:31] call on a power that's beyond man-made
[54:34] laws that's beyond the rulers of this
[54:36] land and stop looking at the negative
[54:39] and look at the
[54:42] positive help me Lord to do that in all
[54:44] things father help
[54:46] me help me to do that Lord in all things
[54:49] let's
[54:50] pray oh God we pray tonight that you
[54:54] would help us
[54:56] to not look at the
[54:58] negative Lord in this maybe this
[55:01] two-part these companion Services last
[55:03] Wednesday and
[55:04] tonight we focused a lot on the
[55:07] dust seemingly the negative
[55:11] side but Lord I was so wrapped up in the
[55:15] thought that even while I was describing
[55:18] Mankind in such horrible terms and using
[55:20] the example of job I it never dawned on
[55:23] me just how dark it could seem
[55:27] because even in the ashes there was
[55:31] Beauty even in the suffering it's
[55:33] pregnant with
[55:35] Glory that every every
[55:39] ounce of
[55:41] pain is a seat of
[55:44] Promise every hurt every bruise every
[55:48] harm Every Lie every wound every sin
[55:51] Lord everything that we could think of
[55:53] every Speck of dust
[55:56] has the potential of
[55:58] Glory because of your
[56:01] word and Lord even as we would describe
[56:04] a valley full of dry bones we know what
[56:07] it's going to
[56:09] be so we do not look at Dry Bones as the
[56:12] evidence of death but we see in it the
[56:15] potential of cartilage and tendon and
[56:18] senu and muscle and
[56:21] skin and we see the promise of the wind
[56:24] to breathe into us the Breath of
[56:27] [Music]
[56:28] God and Father if Paul could say I know
[56:31] all things work together for the
[56:33] good then may we father believe that the
[56:36] suffering of this present time is not
[56:38] worthy to be compared to the glory which
[56:39] shall be revealed in
[56:41] us that my past my Rebellion my
[56:45] suffering my stains my sins even my
[56:48] memories Lord I could be brought back to
[56:49] things that be so burdened with the
[56:51] negative I want to start looking to the
[56:55] positive the positive that I'm
[56:57] Justified the positive that I'm
[56:59] Sanctified the positive that I'm his son
[57:01] and daughter the positive that I'm
[57:04] rising to meet you in the
[57:06] air and Lord may we be a people as
[57:09] brother brandham admonished that group
[57:11] in Houston so many years ago may we be a
[57:14] people that doesn't just look to the
[57:16] negative but looks to the positive and
[57:19] with all of our heaviness and all our
[57:20] mourning and all of our ashes may we
[57:22] realize that those have the potential to
[57:25] become Beauty joy and
[57:29] praise Lord I pray for your people
[57:31] tonight as they set Lord if some
[57:34] standing some with lifted hand whatever
[57:35] they may have in their hearts I pray
[57:38] that you would encourage them
[57:39] tremendously
[57:40] Lord take us out of dust into Christ I
[57:44] commit them to you now in the name of
[57:45] the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:48] amen
[57:50] amen
