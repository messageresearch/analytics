[0:00] my title today is impatient Liberty we
[0:03] talked about imperfect Liberty perfect
[0:05] Liberty uh today we're going to look it
[0:07] at from the standpoint of impatient
[0:10] Liberty my choice of that title might
[0:12] have more to do with uh trying to keep
[0:14] that uh connection to imperfect Liberty
[0:17] and then impatient Liberty could have
[0:20] called it uh patient Liberty just to tie
[0:22] into perfect Liberty but I think you'll
[0:24] get uh the gist of this I would call it
[0:27] part one if you're droing that down I
[0:28] think it this would will probably have
[0:30] another part on this uh to to just
[0:33] background and lay some things out so
[0:34] that we're all on the same page perfect
[0:36] Liberty is to live and to do as we ought
[0:39] to do it is to fulfill our duty it's to
[0:42] act right or correctly uh perfect
[0:44] Liberty is not Liberty just to do
[0:46] whatever you want to do but when you're
[0:48] free you can be as you should be and be
[0:50] as you ought to be and we realize that
[0:53] that Liberty in Christ is to uh live as
[0:57] the word would ask us to live or fulfill
[0:59] God's desire in our lives uh to live
[1:01] under what is the expectation of the
[1:04] word in 2 Corinthians 3:1 17 it says now
[1:08] the Lord is that spirit and where the
[1:10] spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[1:12] we've been looking at that phrase and
[1:14] how the idea that where the spirit of
[1:16] the Lord is there is Liberty to say that
[1:18] well whatever he wants to do we're going
[1:20] to let him do and then at the end of the
[1:22] day all we've really seen is things that
[1:24] we can do things that we can do without
[1:26] inspiration or instigation and so there
[1:28] is sometimes this conflation of uh
[1:31] different human behaviors and activities
[1:33] or certain um manifestations as being
[1:37] what the the scripture means what it
[1:38] says where the spiritual Lord there is
[1:40] Liberty but scripturally we would
[1:43] identify this Liberty as being able to
[1:45] live as we ought to to fulfill the word
[1:49] of God and we see that in James and
[1:51] Corinthians how that this Liberty is
[1:53] connected with fulfilling the word of
[1:56] God now over a couple Services we talked
[1:59] about perfect Liberty and to have
[2:01] imperfect Liberty is to use your Liberty
[2:05] or your freedom to live as you want to
[2:07] so that if you're free you live just
[2:09] however you feel whatever you want to do
[2:11] it's doing what one wants to do in order
[2:13] to please the flesh that's the
[2:16] principles of perfect Liberty and
[2:18] imperfect Liberty as I'm using those
[2:20] terms now impatient Liberty as we use
[2:23] that phrase now impatient Liberty it's
[2:26] to use Liberty as an excuse to act out
[2:29] of order
[2:31] to use Liberty as an excuse to do things
[2:36] untimely if I could put it that way as
[2:39] we were touching on last week on Sunday
[2:42] and Wednesday this lie of Liberty we saw
[2:45] very pronounced in the Scripture it uses
[2:47] the word it uses it is written to entice
[2:50] the believer to cause the believer to
[2:52] act out of Pride to act out of lust or
[2:55] to fulfill the desires of the flesh so
[2:57] the act in itself isn't necessary neily
[3:00] doesn't have to be in itself wrong just
[3:02] in general but it's just what are what's
[3:04] your motive and objective why are you
[3:06] acting and as Satan uh enticed Christ we
[3:11] see these different Dynamics and uh
[3:13] certain ways that he tried to entice him
[3:15] and he say it is written and Jesus said
[3:17] but it's also written and so he didn't
[3:19] want to Jesus was careful to not act out
[3:21] of Pride out of lust or just to satisfy
[3:25] the
[3:26] flesh now if you'll turn your Bibles to
[3:28] Matthew 4: 1
[3:31] to1 I'm I'm intentionally trying to go
[3:34] maybe at a little bit better Pace
[3:35] because brother Alfonso is trying to
[3:37] translate into Spanish today and I'm
[3:41] hard enough to translate if I'm up here
[3:43] stopping after every sentence let alone
[3:45] doing it in the back where you can't
[3:47] take a
[3:48] breath now I want to go back over today
[3:52] everything I think I'm going to be
[3:53] reading today as so far as scriptures
[3:54] are ones that we've used very recently
[3:56] and used quite a bit but I want to go
[3:58] back some over some of the foundational
[4:00] scriptures for our thought on the
[4:04] Simplicity that is in Christ uh the
[4:06] Labyrinth the maze that this that the
[4:08] devil tries to cause and even that home
[4:10] life that simple life in a home of Honor
[4:13] we've been drawing a lot from these
[4:14] different scriptures I want to go back
[4:16] over them just to set these back set
[4:19] these forth in a way that we're it's in
[4:22] our conscience and try to look at it in
[4:24] a little bit stronger detail then was
[4:27] Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wild
[4:29] Wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[4:32] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[4:34] nights he was afterward in hunger and
[4:37] when the tempter came to him he said now
[4:40] give some hard uh thoughtful
[4:43] consideration some real hard thought to
[4:45] the concept of Temptation he's led to be
[4:49] tempted of the devil the tempter comes
[4:52] and just look at what this how this
[4:55] temptation is for a lot of us temptation
[4:57] is uh sweet rolls or chocolate cake or
[5:00] something and we find ourselves
[5:01] wrestling with that Indulgence for
[5:02] others it might be music or
[5:04] entertainment or lust there we think of
[5:06] Temptation in a lot of ways but just
[5:09] give some real strong thought to
[5:11] Temptation and what it might be not to
[5:14] what you're tempted by the concept of
[5:15] Temptation find people just
[5:18] going it says and the tempter came to
[5:21] him and he said if thou be the Son of
[5:23] God command that these Stones be made
[5:26] bread but he answered and said now
[5:29] contextually Christ is hungry Jesus is
[5:32] hungry he's fasted uh beyond what would
[5:35] be appropriate uh for human endur
[5:37] endurance and tolerance he's hungry and
[5:40] so when Satan comes and ask him to turn
[5:42] the stones to bread the the supposition
[5:45] is if you are the Son of God then feed
[5:48] Yourself by manifesting a miracle that
[5:51] would meet your immediate need and so in
[5:54] that in that ask it would seem like what
[5:57] would be wrong if I turn stones into
[6:00] bread what would be wrong if I was able
[6:02] to use power or this gift or this
[6:04] ability to feed myself because I need I
[6:08] need nourishment I need I need strength
[6:11] but Jesus gives us such a key to
[6:14] overcoming every day of Our Lives he
[6:17] says it is written man shall not live by
[6:19] bread alone but by every word that
[6:22] proceedeth out of the mouth of
[6:24] God so he he is telling Satan this he's
[6:28] saying I will stand stand on the word of
[6:30] God Alone that I will not allow my
[6:34] fleshly desires or even my fleshly needs
[6:36] and Necessities to be greater than the
[6:40] will of God in my life that my I have
[6:43] your word is my meat I have esteemed
[6:45] your word more necessary than my daily
[6:48] bread and my daily food so he's saying
[6:50] that it's written that man shall not
[6:52] live by bread alone but by every word of
[6:54] God that's what man lives by that's
[6:57] brother bram's text in the sermon
[6:59] Harvest time that's his anchoring point
[7:01] when he's talking about the different
[7:02] temptations that come and how the Satan
[7:04] works against us and it's in that sermon
[7:08] that he establishes that once Jesus said
[7:11] I won't leave the word he said the devil
[7:14] realized that if you won't reject the
[7:16] word he'll just give you a supernatural
[7:19] offer and it'll it'll be that offer
[7:22] where it says Okay since you're not
[7:23] going to deny the word of God or the
[7:25] word of the hour you're not going to be
[7:26] a word rejector then if I could just get
[7:29] you to act out of the character of the
[7:32] word or start to make the word compete
[7:34] against itself or just in some way cause
[7:38] you to not reject the word but not
[7:40] properly manifest the
[7:42] word he makes him a supernatural offer
[7:45] and here's another Temptation then the
[7:47] devil taketh him up into the holy city
[7:50] and Seth him on a pinnacle of the temple
[7:52] we see those images in the word of God
[7:55] how that now this Supernatural offer is
[7:58] there's going to be some display it's
[8:00] here at the house of the Lord it's it's
[8:03] public and he saith unto him if thou be
[8:06] the Son of God so now it's still the
[8:08] same
[8:09] ask but now it's prove it it prove it
[8:13] without rejecting the word prove it
[8:15] without abandoning the word or going
[8:16] beyond the
[8:17] word if thou be the Son of God cast
[8:20] thyself down jump for it is written
[8:23] because the word of God says that you
[8:25] believe in the the the prophet said or
[8:28] the the this says he shall give his
[8:30] angels charge concerning thee and in
[8:32] their hands they shall bear thee up lest
[8:34] at any time thou Dash thy foot against
[8:37] to Stone the ask is the word said that
[8:41] you would be this would happen if you
[8:43] were in this situation the word says
[8:45] this would happen if you found yourself
[8:47] doing this certain thing so he's saying
[8:49] jump so that God would fulfill his word
[8:53] jump so that if you're the Son of God
[8:54] the angels will catch you they'll be
[8:56] your safety net and Jesus said unto him
[8:59] it is is written again Thou shalt not
[9:01] tempt the Lord thy God this is the also
[9:05] it is written that he goes back to in
[9:07] this in the face of trying to be
[9:10] encouraged to do something Supernatural
[9:12] encouraged to give a sign or a proof or
[9:15] Vindication that he was the son of God
[9:17] he says Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
[9:19] thy God again the devil taketh him up
[9:22] into an exceeding high mountain and
[9:23] showeth him all the kingdoms of the
[9:25] world and the glory of them and sayth to
[9:27] him all these things will I give thee if
[9:30] thou Wilt Fall Down and Worship me now
[9:33] we realize that Christ has promised all
[9:35] these kingdoms already they stand to be
[9:38] his already and Satan is saying this is
[9:41] yours anyways take it now you can have
[9:43] these things you can have it now then
[9:46] saith Jesus unto him get thee hint Satan
[9:48] for it is written Thou shalt Worship the
[9:51] Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[9:53] serve there was something greater
[9:58] something greater than just
[10:00] getting to the end there was something
[10:01] greater than just uh
[10:04] circumventing H uh hardship and getting
[10:06] the promise that was given to you he
[10:08] says there's something this
[10:10] overarching principle in my life that I
[10:13] live by the word of God I don't tempt
[10:16] God and I only worship God you could
[10:20] just distill uh his answers to just
[10:23] principles of daily living these are my
[10:26] my standard operating procedures this is
[10:28] my this is the the the principles by
[10:31] which every day I govern thought and
[10:33] action and how I would respond in a
[10:35] particular
[10:36] situation how do I face how do I
[10:38] overcome
[10:40] Temptation now brother brandham when
[10:42] he's writing the church age book chapter
[10:44] nine and he's addressing the Le Dey in
[10:46] church age he tells us that in Matthew
[10:49] chapter 4 Jesus was tempted of the devil
[10:51] he says he overcame the personal
[10:54] Temptations of Satan by the word so it's
[10:57] a personal Temptation where Satan is
[10:59] working on him in a very particular way
[11:02] uh Jesus maybe in his uh if thou be the
[11:06] Son of God well if there ever was a Son
[11:07] of God that's the Son of God right there
[11:10] here he is he's the son of God and so
[11:13] he's tempting him in a very personal way
[11:15] he's tempting him about his his
[11:17] instincts or his desires even at the
[11:19] time he's hungry oh well you have need
[11:22] of this why don't you do this a a and
[11:24] there's this maybe this need for
[11:26] affirmation maybe he's trying to find
[11:28] what his complexes might be what his
[11:30] bent is do you are do you tend to be
[11:32] more need this affirmation do you do you
[11:34] need to be uh patted on the back do you
[11:36] want others to know who you are and to
[11:38] recognize you so it's a personal
[11:40] Temptation he says that he overcame by
[11:42] the word and the word
[11:47] only it was the word only by which he
[11:50] overcome and he says each of the three
[11:51] major
[11:52] trials that he experienced that Jesus
[11:55] experienced correspond exactly to the
[11:58] temptation in the Garden of Eden this is
[12:01] what brother bam is making this
[12:02] connection the three uh Temptations and
[12:06] the trials that he endured in the
[12:08] wilderness correspond exactly to the
[12:11] temptation of the woman in the Garden of
[12:14] Eden and then he brings it to the
[12:15] scripture in first John the lust of the
[12:17] flesh the lust of the eye and the pride
[12:19] of life so Jesus in these three
[12:22] Temptations was tempted to by the lust
[12:25] of the flesh the lust of the eye and the
[12:27] pride of life and he said Jesus Jus
[12:29] overcame by the
[12:31] word eve fell to the personal Temptation
[12:35] Of Satan by failing to use the word to
[12:38] use the word and the word only there's
[12:41] your contrasting Temptations one in a
[12:44] perfect uh Garden a perfect Eden one in
[12:47] an imperfect Wilderness one overcame by
[12:50] the word the other one fell because they
[12:52] didn't use the word of God now since
[12:55] these Temptations correspond and we're
[12:57] wanting to look at these more carefully
[12:58] now to understand Temptation and this
[13:01] idea of we're free we're Christians
[13:03] we're message Believers the word of God
[13:05] says this the word of God says that and
[13:07] then being impatient in Genesis 3: 1-6
[13:12] says now the serpent was more subtle
[13:13] than any beast of the field which the
[13:15] Lord God had made and he said unto the
[13:17] woman y hath God said ye shall not eat
[13:19] of every tree of the
[13:21] garden Satan uses the question if thou
[13:24] be the Son of God so it's kind that's
[13:26] the the question could say if you are
[13:29] the Son of God wouldn't you be able to
[13:32] turn these stones into
[13:33] bread and it's a here again there's this
[13:37] question if did God say you could eat of
[13:39] every tree of the garden this is a
[13:43] Temptation and the woman said unto the
[13:45] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[13:46] Trees of the garden but of the fruit of
[13:48] the tree which is in the midst of the
[13:50] garden God hath said You shall not eat
[13:51] of it neither shall you touch it lest ye
[13:54] die there's some commentators that
[13:58] identify how she said neither shall ye
[14:01] touch it and how that in the the
[14:02] original Commandment that God gave and
[14:04] that prohibition that God gave he
[14:06] doesn't say anything about touching it
[14:08] some surmise that maybe this is her
[14:10] adding to the word of God I certainly
[14:12] think that this that would be something
[14:13] fun to discuss around a campfire but
[14:16] it's uh it and I'm not sure just exactly
[14:19] if that indicates anything but we do
[14:21] know that on its face she's at least
[14:24] saying no I know what I can eat and I
[14:27] know what I shouldn't do and the serpent
[14:29] said un the woman ye shall not surely
[14:31] die so she knows what she can partake in
[14:35] now the very thing that was Pro
[14:36] prohibited she knew that if she engaged
[14:39] in it it would cause death but now he
[14:41] directly contradicts the word and says
[14:44] oh you you won't die and that's the door
[14:48] that opens up to say that to imply that
[14:50] God has lied and not only does he lie
[14:53] about God he lies about his character he
[14:55] says for God doth know that in the day
[14:57] ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[14:59] open and you shall be as Gods knowing
[15:02] good and evil now if you follow in the
[15:04] path of the scripture we've pointed this
[15:06] out before that exactly what Satan said
[15:08] would happen is exactly what happened
[15:10] because once she ate God himself said
[15:12] they become like one of us to know good
[15:14] and evil so there was there was this
[15:17] reality that it happened just exactly
[15:18] like he said and it manifested in the
[15:21] same way that he suggested this is the
[15:23] problem when the woman saw that the tree
[15:25] was good for food so her her perception
[15:28] is changed from what God said about it
[15:31] and the consequence for indulging she
[15:33] saw that it was good and that it was
[15:35] pleasant to the eyes the language that
[15:38] is used here has nothing to do with
[15:40] eating it speaks of a lust and a desire
[15:43] in the flesh to indulge uh um and some
[15:46] excitement in the flesh it says and a
[15:48] tree to be desired to make one wise so
[15:52] it was good for food Pleasant to the
[15:53] eyes but now it's desired to make one
[15:56] wise God doth know that when the the day
[15:59] the day that you eat you'll be changed
[16:02] the day that you eat you will have
[16:04] experienced something that'll make you
[16:05] more Godlike the day that you eat will
[16:07] be the the next Evolution or the next
[16:10] step in what God has for you so she
[16:12] desired that wisdom she longed for that
[16:15] knowledge she took the fruit thereof and
[16:18] did eat and gave also under her husband
[16:20] with her and he did
[16:23] eat we all on the same page trust that
[16:26] we're each one in
[16:29] um these these these two things put
[16:32] together now we're considering the
[16:33] Temptation in the wilderness the
[16:35] temptation of the woman in the sermons
[16:38] The spoken word is the Original Seed I'm
[16:40] just I'm going to go over these very
[16:41] quickly I didn't provide I don't think I
[16:43] provided these quotes because I just
[16:45] took several places and as you look into
[16:47] this sermon you'll find dozen at least a
[16:50] dozen more instances where brother B is
[16:52] saying this very similar thing speaking
[16:55] of the woman he says Adam's bride could
[16:57] not wait God had told Adam and Eve
[17:00] multiply and replenish the Earth it was
[17:02] an oncoming thing a promise so it was
[17:05] going to happen if we could say that the
[17:08] woman by experiencing conception and and
[17:13] childbirth that it was going to change
[17:15] her understanding and her perception
[17:17] that she was going to become more
[17:18] Godlike and bringing forth life and
[17:20] regardless of how you think it would
[17:22] happen brother bam said it would have
[17:23] happened by them mixing themselves
[17:25] together the man and the woman and and
[17:28] however we would believe or feel that
[17:30] that would take place it was going to
[17:34] happen and I want you to consider that
[17:37] that it wasn't that for her to bring
[17:39] forth children was wrong that that's not
[17:41] necessarily the error and it's not that
[17:44] we need to necessarily say oh well the
[17:46] fact that it was The Serpent and and
[17:49] that alone we want you I want you to
[17:51] recognize how brother brandham
[17:54] identifies the very first thing that
[17:57] began to happen in her heart and in her
[18:00] mind that led her to the original sin
[18:03] like what's the and if I could say
[18:07] this there are there are things that
[18:10] happen in our lives especially when we
[18:12] see people fall in sin and we ask
[18:15] ourselves how in the world did it ever
[18:18] get
[18:19] there sometimes we think man they must
[18:21] have always been rotten they must have
[18:22] always had that problem and this must
[18:24] have always been the case but a lot of
[18:25] times it's it's it's people who lived
[18:29] well done good but something happens
[18:32] along the way and the devil finds just
[18:34] the right way to work within them you'll
[18:37] find people who very adamant about the
[18:40] truth of the message very against um
[18:43] eighth Messengers and people who make
[18:45] themselves God and people who uh try to
[18:47] do certain things to draw people to
[18:49] themselves and they're very vocal
[18:51] against it and in the passage of time
[18:53] they become the very thing they were
[18:55] against and say oh well maybe they were
[18:57] all just rotten they were all just uh uh
[19:01] it was always there at the core well it
[19:03] the woman didn't start out
[19:06] lusting she didn't start out uh with
[19:09] this uh this longing and this desire to
[19:12] do something wrong she has moved into
[19:16] that place where she considered these
[19:18] things and it happened out I've gone
[19:21] down that whole path to say let's
[19:22] recognize how brother bradam said that
[19:25] Dynamic that was something that happened
[19:27] inside of her that caught cused her to
[19:29] act she couldn't wait something was
[19:32] going to happen but once Satan was able
[19:34] to get her to think that it was more
[19:37] necessary
[19:39] immediately brother Bram says again she
[19:41] got in a hurry what did she do she
[19:43] crossed her seed mingled it with the
[19:46] serpent seed she brought a child of
[19:48] death the child that she perverted every
[19:50] child after that I think maybe we'll
[19:52] pick up on more of that on Wednesday
[19:54] night she got in a
[19:56] hurry I notice he says got in a hurry
[19:59] then she made the mistake so there was
[20:01] some urgency some uh excitement that
[20:05] takes place and
[20:07] she gets in a hurry and then she brings
[20:10] forth death he says it again Adam's
[20:12] bride could not wait she mingled her
[20:14] seed
[20:16] illegally in another place and those of
[20:18] you are familiar with a servant I'm kind
[20:19] of CH just cherry-picking these
[20:21] sentences where he says Adam's bride
[20:23] could not wait he says it again now
[20:25] Adam's bride could not wait but she went
[20:27] forward first
[20:29] first now notice in that he says she
[20:32] went forward first she got out of her
[20:35] place and in going forward first she
[20:38] went ahead of her
[20:40] husband there could have been and I
[20:42] maybe this is just conjecture there
[20:43] could have been this Enlightenment in
[20:45] her mind to be like whoa
[20:48] okay didn't know that never thought
[20:51] about that but ended it there and said
[20:54] I'm going to go to my husband and I'm
[20:56] going to tell him and a and I'm going to
[20:59] I'm going to have this conversation with
[21:01] him but she went he said that she went
[21:03] forward first she went ahead of her
[21:05] husband she left that that relationship
[21:08] she got out of her place and she was
[21:10] brother brand if I could put it in my
[21:11] own words she was
[21:13] impatient she could not wait she got in
[21:16] a hurry he says she could not wait she
[21:17] could not wait she was in a hurry and
[21:21] became
[21:25] impatient please please catch this
[21:27] principle
[21:30] Temptation isn't
[21:33] always being encouraged or enticed to do
[21:36] something
[21:37] wrong when we are tempted we're not
[21:40] always tempted or encouraged or enticed
[21:44] to do something sinful but it can be to
[21:47] do the right thing the wrong way or at
[21:49] the wrong
[21:51] time we can be tempted to do right
[21:54] things we could be tempted to do Godly
[21:56] things we could be tempted to do right
[21:58] ious things we could be tempted to do
[22:00] things that are things that the spirit
[22:03] does or things that we know Christians
[22:04] ought to do and I know maybe I'm head a
[22:06] lot of verbiage to it that makes it
[22:08] harder to accept but we could be tempted
[22:10] to do right things the wrong
[22:13] way and we can be tempted to do things
[22:16] the right things at the wrong
[22:20] time now
[22:23] not I'm not emphasizing this aspect
[22:26] above all other aspects and I'm not
[22:28] wanting to diminish all the other ways
[22:30] in which Satan is working against the
[22:32] woman but in just putting a microscope
[22:35] on this aspect he used he prayed on her
[22:39] in a way to where she got impatient so
[22:42] Satan schemes and we'll look at this
[22:44] let's look at this in terms of Christ
[22:45] his schemes prey on
[22:48] impatience that he's wanting to incite
[22:51] encourage to cause us to act either out
[22:54] of order or out of time so this is the
[22:58] right thing thing to do and we could say
[22:59] that it was the right thing to do for
[23:00] the woman to bring forth uh to bring
[23:03] forth children and so Satan causes her
[23:06] to be impatient and her impatience
[23:09] caused her to bring forth a child of
[23:12] death which was Cain but also Abel was
[23:15] not the promised son that she should
[23:17] have brought
[23:18] forth had she waited brother bam says
[23:21] she would have brought forth
[23:23] Christ and we realize that God allowed
[23:26] it to happen to bring forth what was
[23:28] necess NE for the Plan of Redemption to
[23:30] unfold so there's this looking into and
[23:33] recognizing Satan's Dynamics but we're
[23:35] learning from this what God wants us to
[23:37] learn about how Satan operates and how
[23:39] he works against us he was able to get
[23:41] the woman to act out of time and in
[23:44] acting out of time even the child that
[23:46] she had with her own husband wasn't the
[23:48] proper
[23:50] one in Matthew chapter 4 if we if we
[23:54] looked at it and we were able to take
[23:56] more time with it I I'm just wanted to
[23:58] be very careful about time and just our
[24:02] our uh patience today and
[24:06] endurance Jesus was
[24:09] hungry right J says you're hungry why
[24:12] don't you eat
[24:13] now and we don't need that scripture
[24:15] quite
[24:17] yet he's hungry why don't you eat
[24:22] now you why wait you can do
[24:27] it but he offered this into the record
[24:30] well the word of God is more important
[24:32] than my daily
[24:36] bread said the angels will bear you up
[24:40] so
[24:42] jump he says that this could happen so
[24:44] why don't you why don't you bring it to
[24:46] pass brother Braham touches on it in the
[24:48] question and answers and he says about
[24:50] tempting God to um handle snakes and the
[24:53] person said I'm around snake handlers
[24:55] what about it and brother bham says
[24:57] that's tempting God God just like
[25:00] drinking poison or doing something um to
[25:02] say well the word says this happen so
[25:04] let's make it
[25:06] happen there's there is a there is a
[25:10] scriptural principle things that are
[25:11] word-based it's promises in the word of
[25:13] God a and whether it be casting out
[25:16] Devils or laying hands on the sick or
[25:17] speaking with new tongues anything that
[25:19] we might find in the scripture we could
[25:21] find that unless it's God doing it
[25:23] through us it avails us nothing do we
[25:26] realize if we could distill the the word
[25:28] of God and the message hour of the hour
[25:30] down to 1162 laws that we can govern
[25:33] ourselves by and that we can live by
[25:36] that unless God is doing it through us
[25:38] all of those things mean
[25:40] nothing that you must be born again you
[25:42] must have the late nature of Christ
[25:44] inside of you and so there's things that
[25:47] are right things that are true but
[25:49] notice how if you jump this is what God
[25:52] said he would
[25:54] do he said well do you want Power do you
[25:57] want these kingdoms are these kingdoms
[25:59] promised to you then you can have them
[26:02] right now if you just bow and worship
[26:04] me Jesus Christ was being tempted to
[26:08] tempt
[26:09] God that's why he answers in that
[26:12] Supernatural offer he said thou sh it is
[26:14] written it is written Thou shalt not
[26:17] tempt the Lord thy God he was wanting
[26:20] him to tempt God through
[26:23] Pride lust of the eye lust of the flesh
[26:25] the pride of life through
[26:27] impatience what would have he done if he
[26:29] turned stones to bread he would have fed
[26:31] himself and that's
[26:34] it clearly he could do this cuz then he
[26:36] fed over
[26:38] 5,000 he he would he would have fed only
[26:41] himself if he was to cast himself off
[26:44] the temple he would have only Vindicated
[26:49] himself he could have taken Power by his
[26:53] own act according to his own program in
[26:56] each one of these instances there could
[26:58] be is uh uh what's the final outcome
[27:00] what's the final result and we have to
[27:01] look at it in the eyes of what
[27:03] Temptation was in those three major
[27:05] Temptations in the garden and of Christ
[27:08] and how it connects to the lust of the
[27:09] eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride
[27:10] of life and how that Jesus would have
[27:12] been feeding only himself he would have
[27:14] only been vindicating himself and he
[27:16] would have taken all the kingdoms and
[27:18] the power promised to him and that was
[27:20] rightly his but he would have done it on
[27:21] his own and he would have done it
[27:24] according to his own
[27:26] plan I tou on this in terms of
[27:29] impatience because Matthew 4:1 it says
[27:32] then the devil leaveth him and behold
[27:34] Angels Came and ministered unto
[27:38] him in other words he demonstrated
[27:42] patience he demonstrated it he said well
[27:45] you're hungry why don't you make turn
[27:46] stones to bread so that you can get your
[27:48] nourishment Jesus did not uh he Jesus
[27:52] did not give into the needs did not give
[27:55] in to the ask he didn't clown for the
[27:57] devil but he demonstrates patience
[27:59] because ultimately the Angels come and
[28:02] minister to him and I believe that in
[28:05] the ministering to him it was
[28:07] ministering to the need that he had in
[28:09] his flesh I believe it was ministering
[28:10] to his hungering it was ministering to
[28:13] his Spirit it was something that was
[28:15] nurturing to him in his given situation
[28:18] and his condition know words Jesus
[28:20] didn't need to act out he just needed to
[28:24] wait he was hungry he all he had had to
[28:28] do is wait he was the Son of God the
[28:31] Angels were going to Bear him up but all
[28:33] he had to do is wait he's going to get
[28:35] the kingdoms but all he had to do is
[28:37] endure all he had to do is
[28:40] wait so there's this principle of
[28:42] impatience that's working at the core of
[28:44] these
[28:46] Temptations to be impatient is to feel
[28:49] the wanting of something to happen as
[28:51] soon as
[28:52] possible there may be some here that
[28:55] want this service to end right
[28:58] now and you're being
[29:01] impatient the idea of wanting something
[29:04] as soon as possible and I and sometimes
[29:08] the question is you know can you wait
[29:10] for this and I can't wait for this and
[29:12] that's just to convey the idea of
[29:14] impatience because in reality it'd say
[29:17] well I can't wait for it well yeah you
[29:19] can because you're going to have to
[29:21] right I can't wait for Monday who says
[29:23] that I I I can't wait for Monday and
[29:26] then it's like well if you can't then
[29:29] what
[29:30] happens what happens if you don't wait
[29:31] do you just poof you just disappear you
[29:34] die or does Monday come for the record I
[29:37] can't wait till Monday Monday it's it's
[29:40] to convey this idea of that I want
[29:43] something it's this feeling I want
[29:44] something to happen now I really don't
[29:46] want to wait I want it
[29:47] now but the word
[29:50] means the word then is expressing this
[29:53] this is at the very heart of impatience
[29:55] a Restless desire for change or or
[29:59] excitement the Restless desire for
[30:02] change the Restless desire for
[30:07] excitement at the very
[30:09] core it's restlessness to be restless we
[30:13] could say what's impatience to lack
[30:16] patience when you become when you're
[30:18] patient you may want something but
[30:20] you're not being agitated it's not
[30:22] becoming Restless to where now when
[30:24] you're when someone's impatient or
[30:25] Restless they begin to fidget they begin
[30:27] to want to act they begin to think and
[30:29] move and and they're not resting so at
[30:33] the heart of patience is rest at the
[30:35] heart of impatience is a Restless desire
[30:39] you'll find over and over and over again
[30:41] that Satan's schemes are intended to
[30:43] provoke a Restless
[30:46] longing Satan schemes to Pro provoke
[30:49] some sort of anxious desire where
[30:52] there's this I want that I I'm longing
[30:54] for that I need that I need it right now
[31:01] now
[31:02] if in this Matthew chapter 4 where he
[31:06] says there in Jerusalem at the Pinnacle
[31:09] of the temple cast yourself down because
[31:11] if you're the Son of God the Bible says
[31:12] that his angels will have charge
[31:14] concerning thee and will keep you from
[31:17] dashing your foot against a
[31:19] stone Satan is making a supernatural
[31:22] offering taking that directly from the
[31:23] message of the
[31:25] hour and Jesus said Thou shalt not tempt
[31:28] the Lord thy God so it was that him
[31:31] doing that even the asking in the
[31:33] Temptation Of Christ maybe this is the
[31:35] distinction I really we should have
[31:37] pointed out
[31:38] earlier or this is the moment to do
[31:41] it Satan is tempting
[31:45] Christ and there there's that's the one
[31:47] temptation is being asked by the devil
[31:50] to do something for Jesus to have done
[31:52] it would have been de clown for the
[31:54] devil Jesus using that scripture oh well
[31:59] my he said my foot wouldn't be dashed
[32:01] against a stone that the Angels would
[32:02] intervene and stop this for Jesus to
[32:04] have done that would have been Jesus
[32:06] tempting God so Satan's not tempting God
[32:09] directly but by proxy he's trying to get
[32:12] Jesus to act in a way where God's going
[32:14] to do something not necessarily out of
[32:17] character but out of
[32:21] order so Jesus quotes from Deuteronomy
[32:24] chapter 6 verse
[32:25] 16 if we could look at this
[32:29] uh very just in a very focused way so
[32:33] that we can understand what is Jesus
[32:35] referring to what is this temptation
[32:37] referred to Deuteronomy chapter 6:16 you
[32:40] shall not tempt the Lord your God as you
[32:42] tempted him in
[32:44] Massa verse 17 says you shall diligently
[32:47] keep the Commandments of the Lord your
[32:49] God and His testimonies and his statutes
[32:51] which he hath commanded thee so it's not
[32:54] tempting God to do what you ought to do
[32:58] it's not tempting God to do what he has
[33:00] specifically asked you to
[33:03] do but there can be a tempting of
[33:06] God wherein you act in a way that's
[33:09] beyond what he has prescribed it's
[33:11] beyond the character and the timing of
[33:13] what he has asked you to do or what you
[33:14] think you should do we understand
[33:17] there's a principle trying to do God a
[33:18] service without it being his will says
[33:22] you shall not tempt the Lord your God as
[33:23] you tempted him in Massa Massa there
[33:25] means temptation
[33:28] scripture speaks of the days of
[33:29] provocation the Temptation in Hebrews it
[33:32] speaks of it so let's go to this place
[33:34] in scripture where he's saying don't
[33:36] tempt the Lord your God as you tempted
[33:37] him in this place in Exodus chapter
[33:40] 17 says that the people were tempting
[33:43] Moses and complaining to Moses and says
[33:45] why do you want me to tempt God because
[33:47] they were saying why did you bring us
[33:49] out here to die in the
[33:51] wilderness
[33:56] and and it says in verse for Moses cried
[33:58] to the Lord saying what shall I do unto
[34:00] this people they be almost ready to
[34:02] Stone me and the Lord said unto Moses go
[34:05] before the people and take with thee the
[34:08] of the Elders of Israel in thy rod where
[34:10] withth thou smolest the river take in
[34:12] thy hand and go they're hungry they're
[34:14] thirsty they have no water we we need we
[34:16] need water we need water notice just
[34:18] even this symmetry to Christ in the
[34:19] wilderness they're being tempted he
[34:21] needs bread here's the children of
[34:23] Israel in the wilderness they need water
[34:25] and they're begging and Moses saying why
[34:27] do you want me to attempt God why are
[34:28] you asking me to do this I I apologize
[34:31] if maybe more context in those first few
[34:33] verses would be helpful I want to
[34:35] quickly get to where he this idea of
[34:37] Temptation he says behold I will stand
[34:40] before thee upon the rock in Horeb and
[34:42] thou shalt Smite The Rock and there
[34:44] shall come water out of it that the
[34:46] people may
[34:48] drink and Moses did so in the sight of
[34:50] the Elders of Israel now very very
[34:53] interesting the people are thirsty they
[34:55] need water Moses feels uneasy about the
[34:58] way that they're trying to make this
[34:59] happen he goes before the Lord and he
[35:01] says I don't know what to do they're
[35:02] about to sto he says I'll stand on the
[35:04] Rock Smite it water will come forth I'm
[35:07] going to give the people what they ask
[35:09] for this is going to be Supernatural the
[35:11] same Rod that you used to part the water
[35:13] you're going to Smite The Rock it's
[35:14] going to bring forth water but notice
[35:16] how this place is characterized it's not
[35:19] characterized with the language that
[35:21] says oh Bountiful fountain water from
[35:23] the rock it it doesn't have all those uh
[35:27] that doesn't create a word picture of
[35:29] what we believe Christ is to be in the
[35:31] wilderness but rather it says and he
[35:33] called the name of the place Massa and
[35:36] meah because of the CH the chiding of
[35:39] the children of Israel maraba means
[35:41] Strife or contention this chiding mass
[35:44] of Temptation and maraba because of the
[35:47] Ching of the children of Israel and
[35:49] because they tempted the Lord
[35:51] saying is the Lord among us or
[35:55] not is God really with us
[36:01] and it's this
[36:03] statement that becomes the basis for God
[36:07] saying in Deuteronomy 6 you shall not
[36:10] tempt the Lord as you tempted me in
[36:12] Exodus 17 as you tempted me in the
[36:14] wilderness where when you were in a
[36:17] situation your question was basically
[36:20] well is God not among
[36:22] us is he is he really a man of his word
[36:26] when he says is the Lord among us
[36:28] the phrase means is God a liar is God a
[36:32] god of his
[36:34] word God had thoroughly declared his
[36:37] presence with the children of Israel no
[36:40] question about it signs and wonders and
[36:43] miracles had preceded them but now in
[36:46] this moment they demanded more
[36:48] proof as if God had not done enough to
[36:52] vindicate his presence and tell him that
[36:54] the promise was true it was a temptation
[36:57] because God wanted the children of
[36:59] Israel God help me to say this the right
[37:01] way God wanted the children of Israel to
[37:04] look back and see what he had done to
[37:05] bring them to where they were and to
[37:07] recognize where he promised to bring
[37:09] them and say I don't know how he's going
[37:11] to do it but somehow he's going to take
[37:13] this hungry thirsty dehydrating believer
[37:17] and get him into the promised land where
[37:19] it's flowing with milk and honey and I
[37:21] just believe he's going to do that but
[37:25] in that moment moment of crisis in that
[37:27] moment of weakness they demanded that
[37:29] God prove and vindicate who he was
[37:32] instead of taking God at his
[37:36] word and God was gracious to give them
[37:39] what they asked
[37:40] for to manifest his presence yet again
[37:43] to bring forth water from the rock to to
[37:46] show uh his grace to them and his
[37:49] presence with them but yet it was a
[37:50] Temptation and he said don't tempt me
[37:55] like
[37:56] that he's not saying don't ask me for
[37:59] things and and don't don't ask me
[38:01] according to my word he's he's not he's
[38:03] not trying to get us to where it's like
[38:05] we we don't ever want to go before the
[38:06] Lord we said there's something at the
[38:08] heart of the ask where they are
[38:10] requiring more from God in a moment when
[38:13] he wanted them to take him at his
[38:16] word because Jesus overcame by the word
[38:19] and the word only
[38:34] you if you were to just follow in the
[38:37] that
[38:38] path once you've tempted God once it
[38:40] becomes easier to tempt him again
[38:44] especially when he
[38:46] answers and it was that Dynamic that
[38:48] ultimately gets Moses in trouble where
[38:50] in Anger he smites The Rock
[38:53] twice and God was so displeased with
[38:56] that
[38:58] I want I want you to to cons consider
[39:01] the danger of those
[39:04] things so the Temptation in the garden
[39:06] of Eve and the Temptation in the
[39:09] wilderness of
[39:11] Christ they are at the heart about
[39:14] proving about
[39:17] evidence is is the Lord among us or not
[39:20] is God With
[39:22] Us is he a man of his
[39:25] word is is he really real has he made a
[39:29] promise cuz if he if he has then let him
[39:32] do this now so it was about proving it
[39:35] was about evidence even Christ if thou
[39:36] be the Son of God if thou be the Son of
[39:38] God the Temptation is a trial or a test
[39:42] of faith through
[39:45] enticement you recognize that Satan is
[39:48] tempting Christ to prove who he is are
[39:52] you who you really say you are so we can
[39:55] be asked to clown for the devil we can
[39:56] be asked to clown for the world we can
[39:58] be asked to demonstrate and be
[39:59] demonstrative or do things in order to
[40:01] prove to somebody else who we are but
[40:03] then also we could be asking God you
[40:05] prove to me who you
[40:08] are and therein is the
[40:11] crisis the Temptation is about proof and
[40:18] evidence I'm just going to push a little
[40:20] bit further here this morning I'll try
[40:22] to go rather quickly in 2 Corinthians
[40:25] 11:3 he says but I fear CU I want to
[40:27] bring this to the end
[40:29] time remember how that brother bam says
[40:32] you watch there in the Harvest time he
[40:34] says you watch in the end where that
[40:36] Temptation comes watch when you get to
[40:39] the end where this temptation comes
[40:41] maybe he might let some of you speak in
[40:43] tongues and think you got it remember
[40:45] they in the Harvest Time this temptation
[40:48] watch where it comes at the end and he
[40:49] goes he says a lot more but I want just
[40:51] to recall to you those things but I fear
[40:53] less by any means as the serpent
[40:55] beguiled Eve through his subtlety so
[40:56] your mind should be corrupted from the
[40:59] Simplicity that is in
[41:01] Christ there had been a corruption from
[41:04] Simplicity in the garden there certainly
[41:07] was an attempt to corrupt Christ in the
[41:10] wilderness now in the end we're facing
[41:12] Temptation Paul is touching on it to the
[41:14] Corinthian Church as Eve was beg guiled
[41:17] your mind should not be corrupted from
[41:19] the Simplicity that is in Christ
[41:21] Simplicity remember means free from
[41:24] pretense to live simply in Christ it
[41:27] speaks of that liberality that
[41:29] generosity it is to live and not be
[41:34] self-serving what did the people want
[41:36] God to prove himself but not for himself
[41:39] for
[41:41] themselves they wanted him to feed them
[41:43] they wanted to be cold they wanted to be
[41:45] uh uh watered they they wanted it only
[41:47] for themselves they didn't think about
[41:50] God they didn't think about his will or
[41:52] his program or his promise this is true
[41:55] Liberty to be free from pretense to be
[41:57] free from self-serving or self-seeking
[42:00] maybe a better word to use Simplicity is
[42:03] not
[42:04] self-seeking we read it on Wednesday
[42:06] from The Trumpet gives an uncertain
[42:08] sound brother BR says not something you
[42:10] try to do something you manufacture you
[42:13] can't manufacture you can't manufacture
[42:15] salvation you can't manufacture the
[42:17] gifts he says and the Church of the
[42:18] Living God doesn't inject this to try to
[42:21] make themselves look like
[42:24] something that's that's being corrupted
[42:26] from the simp is in Christ where you try
[42:28] to inject this you try to inject the
[42:30] word to make yourself look like
[42:33] something so then brother brandham says
[42:35] and spoken word is the Original
[42:38] Seed I've provided the paragraph numbers
[42:40] here on these I believe so that you
[42:42] could just see that I'm skipping that's
[42:45] exactly what Adam found that's what
[42:48] Christ found he's talking about the New
[42:50] Testament Church couldn't wait that's
[42:53] what's the matter with the people today
[42:56] they can't wait for the real Holy Spirit
[42:57] to take the church in
[43:00] position what in what positionally
[43:02] places a
[43:07] Believer they've got to manufacture
[43:09] something work up something initial
[43:12] evidence speaking in tongues to get more
[43:13] members in the church all these kinds
[43:16] all these kind of Tommy rot instead of
[43:18] waiting upon the Lord for the real
[43:20] manifestation of the resurrection of
[43:22] Christ making himself known among the
[43:24] people she can't wait
[43:27] says it shortly after that now Adam's
[43:29] bride could not wait but she went
[43:31] forward first we've already read that to
[43:32] you that's the wrong that's the way
[43:34] today the bride today she wants to
[43:37] manufacture something glory to God she's
[43:39] got to work it up on the platform she's
[43:42] got to have everything what is she doing
[43:44] manufacturing
[43:47] something let me say this these things
[43:50] that he's talking about we wouldn't use
[43:53] one scripture against
[43:55] it as being
[43:57] sinful whether it be tongues whether it
[44:00] be uh the moving of SP the spirit
[44:03] remember how that there's things that
[44:05] God does and only he can do it
[44:07] Discerning the thoughts causing a limb
[44:10] to grow raising the dead there's a lot
[44:12] of things uh
[44:14] prophesying accurately according to the
[44:16] word there's a lot of things only God to
[44:17] do Revelation these are things that God
[44:19] does and then there's a response of the
[44:22] flesh to the stimulation of Revelation
[44:25] there's the response of the flesh to a
[44:27] healing there's a response of the flesh
[44:29] to the spirit where we are in our flesh
[44:32] responding to some
[44:34] stimulus and the word of God could take
[44:37] place and we go yes
[44:39] yes or we could be listening to the
[44:42] lottery numbers being
[44:43] read the same thing just like those
[44:46] meetings I were in like I'm describing
[44:48] to you a rock
[44:50] concert because you realize there's just
[44:53] a limited Spectrum in terms of how it's
[44:55] it's large but it's limited in terms of
[44:58] how the human can body can react to
[45:03] stimulus so there's things that in
[45:05] themselves are not sinful they're not
[45:06] wrong we wouldn't want to preach against
[45:08] them we wouldn't want to put a Scarlet
[45:11] Letter on them to where uh these things
[45:14] that brother Bram is saying is to say
[45:16] that if you do these things you're of
[45:17] the devil but notice at the core it's
[45:21] not the product that is that issue as
[45:24] much as how you got to it
[45:27] and it's how you get there that
[45:29] identifies the
[45:31] problem paragraph 81 if that child has
[45:33] been for brought forth right there' have
[45:35] been no death but she couldn't wait
[45:37] talking about the woman that's what's
[45:39] the matter today you want some kind of
[45:41] phony makeup with screaming jumping
[45:43] speaking in tongues or something instead
[45:45] of waiting for the real word of God to
[45:47] be made manifest through the
[45:49] bride who is the bride the kind that
[45:51] takes the word is God's true bride
[45:54] bringing forth children
[45:57] so what is the principal error I'll be
[45:59] closing here shortly I have uh just one
[46:01] lengthy statement to read but I'll just
[46:03] chop it up a little
[46:05] bit what's the what's the principal
[46:07] error now brother brandham is going to
[46:10] Great Links to identify what had gone
[46:12] wrong in the Leo desan Church age and
[46:14] where Pentecost had failed a and the the
[46:18] Dynamics that caused them to go into
[46:20] organization to adopt evidences and to
[46:23] uh to make it Showmanship all these
[46:25] things brother brandham is clearly
[46:28] calling out the Pentecostal organization
[46:31] and the the slipping away and the
[46:33] Sliding Away of the Christian church
[46:36] where in Christ is kicked out the doors
[46:38] and he's been kicked out of his own
[46:39] church so I want you to understand that
[46:41] he's he's saying that very specifically
[46:43] and precisely in the time that he's
[46:44] saying it about very specific things but
[46:47] what's the principle we can draw from it
[46:48] for today because we're not UPC we're
[46:52] not independ independent Pentecostals
[46:54] we're not Pentecostal organization we
[46:56] don't are we shouldn't believe that
[46:57] tongues or any manifestation in the
[47:00] flesh is the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[47:03] I trust that none of us have bought into
[47:05] that uh error or that theology so what
[47:08] is at the core the principal error if we
[47:11] look at what brother bam is saying in
[47:13] the garden and then now in the end time
[47:15] is the and even at the initiation of the
[47:17] church this impatience that leads to a
[47:20] human effort to manufacture proof or to
[47:23] manufacture signs or to manufacture some
[47:26] outward
[47:27] working at the core it's impatience
[47:30] leading to human
[47:32] effort the underlying motivator in this
[47:36] is is is this we want it we want it we
[47:39] can't wait we want it this is what he
[47:41] said we got to have it he said this
[47:42] would happen let's make it happen and
[47:45] really at the core if we look at what
[47:46] Jesus said in Matthew 4 if you look at
[47:49] Deuteronomy 6 and exodus 17 and
[47:51] especially if we look at the
[47:53] woman the very thing that prompts the
[47:57] impatience is some sort of unsettledness
[48:00] with respect to
[48:02] Faith it has something to do with doubt
[48:05] in God's
[48:07] promise if you were anchored in the word
[48:09] only you would say well he said it's
[48:12] going to happen then it's going to
[48:13] happen but if he could create a little
[48:16] bit of Doubt but what if it doesn't so
[48:20] then what do you want to do well let's
[48:22] make sure it
[48:23] does let's make him prove it
[48:25] now I I what if what if it is wrong
[48:27] let's let's put it to the
[48:30] test it's when it becomes what you ought
[48:32] to do and not what he said he would
[48:42] do spok con word is the Original Seed
[48:46] Brothers if you could come to your
[48:47] instruments we'll we'll wrap it up
[48:52] here remember the power of patience
[48:57] and we are taught in the message of the
[48:58] hour that to see God's word fulfilled
[49:01] requires
[49:02] patience to see God's word perfected and
[49:06] manifested by God requires
[49:09] patience that being true and the power
[49:12] what do patience perfect work let
[49:14] patience have a perfect that you would
[49:15] be perfect so if we could take patience
[49:18] out of the equation you'll never be
[49:19] perfect and God's word will never be
[49:21] manifested if he can just cause you to
[49:24] be impatient I don't necessarily have to
[49:27] make you want to reject God's word I
[49:29] don't even have to make you reject God
[49:30] words God's word I just have to make you
[49:33] impatient about his promise and cause
[49:35] some slightly slightly doubting well
[49:38] maybe maybe God isn't with the bride
[49:40] maybe it hasn't been working maybe all
[49:42] these 50 years has proved that there's
[49:43] something wrong with Ministry maybe
[49:45] there's something wrong with the message
[49:46] the are maybe we ought to be working in
[49:48] these Realms maybe we've got away from
[49:50] the things that the church ought to be
[49:52] doing and he wants to cause you to
[49:54] slightly doubt and step out and get
[49:57] ahead of him to force his hand and prove
[50:02] his word or who you
[50:04] are but for God's word to be fulfilled
[50:07] it requires
[50:09] patience meaning this at the core of
[50:13] Temptation is
[50:16] impatience and impatience isn't always
[50:18] to do the wrong thing but it can do be
[50:21] to try to do the right thing the wrong
[50:23] way or in the wrong time good spoken
[50:27] words of the Original Seed paragraph 121
[50:29] what's she trying to
[50:30] do she manufactures a little jumping on
[50:33] the platform not making fun of it it's
[50:36] all right God forbid that we would ever
[50:39] mock it or make fun of it ridicule it or
[50:42] shame it there can be so much violent
[50:45] rhetoric when it comes to certain things
[50:47] and certain people and certain
[50:48] circumstances and you're you're only
[50:51] you're only asking for it
[50:55] yourself make making fun of it and
[50:57] mocking it he says don't make fun of it
[50:59] it's it's all right but what does he
[51:01] want us to
[51:02] learn not to mock jumping and dancing
[51:05] and shouting don't ever do
[51:07] that don't don't ever uh uh uh speak
[51:11] against it with a nastiness or
[51:14] negativity he says it's all right but
[51:16] what is he trying to teach us as the
[51:17] bride what does he wants to know that
[51:19] there's a there's this motivation she
[51:22] manufactures something else why I to get
[51:25] members in the church
[51:27] what's the matter she just can't
[51:30] wait she can't wait for God to do it
[51:33] they've got to get members in there
[51:35] somewhere so they tell them you have to
[51:38] do that and away they go there's the
[51:41] seed coming right up you have to do it
[51:46] if I could say this a little jumping on
[51:48] the platform not making fun of it it's
[51:51] all right if I could jump higher I
[51:53] probably would do
[51:55] it but he say
[51:57] it's when it becomes you have to do
[52:00] it but there's a way that we begin to
[52:02] say well if it's not this way it's not
[52:05] the right
[52:06] way now there's groups of people that if
[52:08] you are sweating and you're perspiring
[52:10] and you're preaching and you're and
[52:11] you're more charismatic there's you know
[52:13] there's just a a Pentecostal they're
[52:15] this they're that and we make it a have
[52:16] to this is what you have to do somebody
[52:20] who doesn't preach this way or say these
[52:22] things he's wrong because this is what
[52:23] you have to do to the point to where
[52:25] it's been said that if you're church I'm
[52:27] just being very transparent if your
[52:29] church doesn't have this your church is
[52:31] dead and they're talking about shouting
[52:33] dancing passing out screaming speaking
[52:35] in tongues and what's the implication
[52:37] this is what you have to do or you're
[52:41] dead that's air that's the Tommy rot
[52:44] that brother Brandon was calling
[52:46] out we shouldn't make fun of those who
[52:49] shout and dance and maybe it would be
[52:51] good if some of us were those but the
[52:53] problem is is we make fun of those who
[52:55] don't and that's just as
[52:59] wrong that's the seed of discrepancy
[53:02] that's the seed coming right up you have
[53:05] to do
[53:11] [Music]
[53:16] it I was when I was mentioning earlier
[53:18] about just the human response to
[53:22] stimulus concept is is if you do not
[53:25] respond to stimulus
[53:27] begs the question whether or not
[53:28] something's
[53:29] dead right feel no pain in your in your
[53:33] some extremity is there is there dead
[53:35] nerves is something wrong is something
[53:37] been breached is something wrong and so
[53:39] if a person has no emotion brother bam
[53:41] says they're dead bury it in other words
[53:44] if there's no activity if there's no
[53:46] response to stimulus maybe your brain
[53:48] dead maybe you're dead it was it to say
[53:51] that we had to have a certain
[53:53] manifestation of emotions to prove we're
[53:56] living
[53:57] that's just that's just human basic
[53:59] human biology that he's referring
[54:02] to on one level he says when you have to
[54:05] do it and then he goes to this he says
[54:08] I'm a I've been a missionary I've been
[54:09] to Africa and he said I've seen him get
[54:12] all painted up and hang hooks into them
[54:14] a a and pour things over themselves and
[54:17] blood and Stripes themselves and all
[54:18] this thing and he says and shout and
[54:20] dance in the spirit and speak in tongues
[54:21] and worship devils and he goes evidence
[54:23] of the Holy
[54:24] Ghost I've seen natives who reject God
[54:28] act in the same manner that you think
[54:29] blood Point coming out of your hands
[54:30] doing all these things and you say
[54:32] that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost he
[54:34] says I've been right there in India
[54:35] where they walk on fire they sew their
[54:39] lips
[54:40] up a and they run a saber through their
[54:42] lips and they do all sorts of things
[54:43] with Fish Hooks and stuff he said they
[54:46] go over there and dance around an idol
[54:47] and kill a goat and worship like this
[54:48] and walk through hot fire with without a
[54:51] Scorch he says some of you Pentecostals
[54:53] try it
[54:56] think about those things these Feats of
[54:58] endurance and these testings and and
[55:01] being preserved for these painful things
[55:03] and walking on coals and not being burnt
[55:06] and then brother BR says this but it was
[55:09] done the Hebrew
[55:12] children they stepped into the fire one
[55:15] day they didn't just walk on coals they
[55:17] walked into a furnace that was heated
[55:18] seven times harder than it had ever been
[55:20] heated before he said but they never
[55:22] tempted the Lord their God they were
[55:24] just thrown into it right they didn't
[55:27] try to manufacture something that's
[55:30] what's the matter with Pentecostals
[55:31] today they're manufacturing something
[55:34] they can't
[55:35] wait oh God they just can't wait so they
[55:38] commit adultery tears to manufacture
[55:41] something and what does it bring forth
[55:44] what's the mixing what's the hybriding
[55:46] it's to take divine nature and mix it
[55:48] with human
[55:49] nature outside of God's
[55:52] timing outside of God's will or the
[55:55] wrong way because the flesh is becoming
[55:57] word and word is becoming flesh we are
[55:59] partakers of his divine nature but that
[56:01] doesn't mean that everything that we put
[56:03] our hand forward to do when we think
[56:05] it's the will of God is the right thing
[56:07] it can produce tears he says like it did
[56:10] the first time the first bride couldn't
[56:11] wait she brought death through a bastard
[56:13] born child which we all are children of
[56:16] but God Came In the Flesh to give us
[56:18] another birth I hope to come to this
[56:19] more on Wednesday to bring us back to
[56:21] original Sons and Daughters of God there
[56:23] you are the life sperm of Eve never
[56:25] happened in never did why she mingled it
[56:28] kept it away instead of Adam coming for
[56:30] her bride coming to her for a bride when
[56:32] the time appointed would be just like
[56:35] Christ would have come to the group
[56:37] Christ would have come to his church he
[56:38] promised to do it God promised to
[56:41] multiply them but they had to wait until
[56:43] God's time that's what's the matter
[56:45] today they don't wait want to wait God's
[56:51] time if it's God's time then let him do
[56:55] it but let us not allow our flesh or the
[56:58] devil to place upon us a burden or a
[57:01] bondage or a Temptation that we need to
[57:05] make it happen to prove that we're his
[57:08] bride brother Brandon was very clear
[57:10] what our Revival
[57:12] is he very clear about what would matter
[57:15] the
[57:16] most and I believe that in this Exodus
[57:19] we can make the same mistake of meah and
[57:21] Massa by tempting God when he's already
[57:25] fir thly Vindicated his presence to
[57:29] us therefore I believe that we ought to
[57:31] do what he asked us to do and do what we
[57:34] ought to do and leave the rest to
[57:38] him let's pray today if we could just
[57:40] bow our heads and just stand with me
