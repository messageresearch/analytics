[0:00] I'm going to conclude on the subject we
[0:02] started Sunday morning on unshakable and
[0:05] just bear with me as we reviewed just a
[0:07] little bit from Sunday I want to go back
[0:10] through Hebrews chapter 12 just a little
[0:11] bit add some more scriptures uh that we
[0:14] didn't get to on Sunday
[0:16] and I want this to kind of serve as a
[0:18] lead into going into Kingdom Life and in
[0:21] particular order and character and just
[0:24] not sure how we might break it up but I
[0:26] think there's a lot of things that are
[0:27] applicable to daily life even as Paul
[0:30] references how that we receive in a
[0:32] kingdom let's serve God acceptably let's
[0:34] do it right and let's do it with Godly
[0:36] reverence and a Godly fear so there's
[0:38] just a lot there for us to take into
[0:40] consideration and if you could just look
[0:42] at verse 22 there in Hebrews chapter 12
[0:45] I don't have much to cover tonight just
[0:47] a little bit to kind of capture the
[0:49] feeling and some of the prophecies in
[0:51] Hebrews 12 and then come back to the
[0:53] unshakable nature that we're to have as
[0:56] being a part of this Kingdom and
[0:58] contrasting with Mount Sinai as he
[1:00] called it a terrible Mountain where they
[1:02] had come in Exodus 9 19 into Blackness
[1:05] and darkness and Tempest and and kind of
[1:09] the even as you continue in those
[1:11] chapters there in Exodus it arrives at
[1:13] God's judgment upon them but he's saying
[1:15] we haven't come to Mount Sinai but Mount
[1:17] Zion in verse 22 but year come unto
[1:19] Mount Zion and a note spelled maybe a
[1:21] little bit differently in the New
[1:23] Testament but this is Mount Zion and
[1:25] unto the city of the Living God the
[1:27] heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable
[1:29] company of angels to the general
[1:32] assembly in the Church of the firstborn
[1:33] which are written in heaven and you can
[1:35] see how that speaks of the body of
[1:37] Christ it speaks of that church that
[1:39] Jesus said that he would have that the
[1:40] Gates of Hell could not Prevail against
[1:42] it once it's founded upon the revelation
[1:44] of Jesus Christ and to God the judge of
[1:47] all and to the spirits of just men made
[1:49] perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the
[1:52] New Covenant and to the blood of
[1:54] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[1:55] than that of Abel he's saying you've
[1:58] come to the kingdom this is what he's
[1:59] describing all these different elements
[2:01] when it refers to Mount Zion that city
[2:03] of David the city of God there is all
[2:06] these different elements he starts
[2:08] referring to or just a way of him trying
[2:10] to describe something that's very very
[2:12] vast and in a lot of ways if I could say
[2:14] this summarize kind of the things he's
[2:16] been driving home through the first 12
[2:18] chapters and 11 chapters and now he's
[2:21] kind of saying this is what we've come
[2:23] to and all these different things that
[2:24] kind of fit into it and tie into it
[2:26] you've come to the kingdom and the
[2:28] kingdom God of God we know is the word
[2:29] of God living in flesh the kingdom is
[2:32] made spirit and life in you and I so
[2:34] Paul's not just wanting them to think of
[2:36] a physical Mountain he's wanting them to
[2:38] think of a spiritual sense you haven't
[2:40] come to Mount Sinai that you couldn't
[2:42] touch but you're coming to something
[2:43] that is the kingdom of God that you are
[2:45] a part of and if I could even put it
[2:48] this way as you turn to Exodus chapter
[2:50] 19. he's saying you haven't come to
[2:52] Mount Sinai as a physical Mountain but
[2:55] you've come to the promise of Mount
[2:56] Sinai it was that it was at Mount Sinai
[2:59] that the law was given which pointed to
[3:01] Christ now Mount Sinai says I'll make
[3:03] you a peculiar treasure from out of the
[3:05] earth and I'll make you a kingdom I'm
[3:07] unto me it says in Exodus 19 5-6 now
[3:11] therefore if you will obey my voice
[3:12] indeed and keep my Covenant then ye
[3:15] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[3:17] above all people for all the Earth is
[3:19] mine there's going to be a people that
[3:21] are a treasure out of the earth and ye
[3:23] shall be unto me a kingdom of priests
[3:25] and a holy nation this is what Peter and
[3:28] the writers in the New Testament pick up
[3:30] on includes the Gentiles it's not just
[3:32] the Jews that you are a peculiar people
[3:34] you're a holy people a royal people a
[3:37] treasure these are the words which Thou
[3:39] shalt speak unto the children of Israel
[3:41] this is the prophecy that goes forth at
[3:43] Mount Sinai this is what Paul is wanting
[3:46] them to think about in type now Mount
[3:48] Sinai foreshadowed this great kingdom of
[3:50] God that now we've come to
[3:52] and we know that Mount Zion is of the
[3:55] city of God it says it right in there
[3:57] Mount Zion the city of the Living God it
[3:59] is the Heavenly Jerusalem mentioned it
[4:01] before that Paul sees it here at the
[4:04] beginning John sees it finished it
[4:06] coming down out of Heaven from God
[4:08] and this city as we've emphasized many
[4:11] times before represents the bride
[4:14] we'll set on Sunday Daughter of Zion
[4:15] refers to the rightful citizens of Zion
[4:18] even The Heirs The Joint heirs with the
[4:20] Messiah as they saw themselves as the
[4:22] daughters of Zion they would be related
[4:25] to the Messiah they would have this
[4:26] kinship and and reign with the Messiah
[4:29] in Psalm 78 verses 68 and 69 it says but
[4:33] choose but this is God but I chose the
[4:35] tribe of Judah the Mount Zion the Mount
[4:37] Zion which he loved think of that he
[4:40] chose the tribe of Judah the Mount Zion
[4:42] which he loved and he built his
[4:44] Sanctuary like high palaces like the
[4:46] Earth which he had established forever
[4:48] this is God's attitude towards Zion so
[4:52] when there's a reference to Mount Zion
[4:53] this is a very special place a lot of
[4:56] other significant mountains Mount Carmel
[4:58] Mount Transfiguration Mount Sinai a lot
[5:00] of other places where we see
[5:01] mountaintops but now there is this Mount
[5:04] Zion which signifies something climactic
[5:06] about God's desire it's the climax of
[5:09] The Kingdom you've come to Mount Zion
[5:11] Mount Zion which God loves and he built
[5:13] this Sanctuary like high palaces like
[5:15] the Earth
[5:16] which he hath established forever
[5:18] there's a another reminder that there's
[5:20] something about this Earth that'll be
[5:22] forever
[5:23] and then in Psalms 87 verses one to
[5:26] seven again just kind of bear with me as
[5:27] they We Lay this Foundation again from
[5:29] Hebrews 12 I believe we read this
[5:31] earlier this year it says a Psalm or
[5:33] song for the sons of Korah his
[5:35] foundation is in the Holy mountains the
[5:38] Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than
[5:40] all the dwellings of Jacob this is God's
[5:43] attitude towards this Mount he loves the
[5:45] gates of Zion more than any other
[5:47] dwelling this holy city they call it the
[5:49] city of the Living God the Mount of God
[5:51] because this is a special place that God
[5:53] loves
[5:54] it says glorious things are spoken of
[5:56] the O City of God say Lord this is Zion
[5:59] again o city of God
[6:02] I will make mention of Rahab in Babylon
[6:04] to them that know me behold Felicity and
[6:07] tirey with Ethiopia this man was born
[6:09] there talking about Zion
[6:11] and of Zion it shall be said this and
[6:13] that man was born in her and the highest
[6:16] himself shall establish her this is this
[6:19] is incredible language I'm just going
[6:21] over very quickly tonight because we
[6:23] don't want to be long and it's it ought
[6:26] to get us to be thinking about how
[6:27] special of a designation it is to refer
[6:29] to Zion
[6:31] and even if we made this a very literal
[6:33] place and those that are actually born
[6:34] in Zion will be regarded as oh wow this
[6:37] man was born there and all Miami
[6:38] established this city well whatever it
[6:41] pertains to the Natural you are the
[6:42] Fulfillment of it in the spiritual and
[6:45] we use this uh in the past and maybe it
[6:47] was in a different series on our family
[6:49] tree how there's something about this
[6:51] place as it continues to write this man
[6:54] was born in her and we all ought to have
[6:57] this representation in the body of
[6:59] Christ not that we go to church that
[7:00] we've been born into the body of Christ
[7:02] the highest himself shall establish her
[7:04] the Lord shall count when he rideth up
[7:07] the people that this man was born there
[7:10] say long
[7:11] this is this is the body of Christ you
[7:14] have to be born into it this is the roll
[7:16] call in heaven the names written in the
[7:19] Lamb's Book of Life the Lord shall count
[7:21] who is he going to count those who have
[7:23] been born into the body of Christ those
[7:25] whose names are written in the Lamb's
[7:27] Book of Life and so Zion is God's
[7:29] dwelling it is his body it is his
[7:32] dwelling place it's a place that he
[7:33] loves above all other dwellings of Jacob
[7:37] and Paul as he's writing this that
[7:40] you've come not to a mount that might be
[7:42] touched and that burned with fire and
[7:44] Blackness and darkness and Tempest but
[7:46] you've come to Mount Zion if we could
[7:49] look at it in the sense that Paul has
[7:51] come to the base of it and is beholding
[7:54] it all from the base and look it up and
[7:56] saying this is what we've come to we've
[7:59] arrived at the Prophecies of the Old
[8:01] Testament we've come to that thing that
[8:03] has been spoken of before that the
[8:04] kingdom would come and that God would
[8:06] establish his presence in his people he
[8:08] says you've arrived at the base of Mount
[8:10] Zion
[8:11] at the foundation of the beginning the
[8:13] body of Christ even is in Exodus 19 had
[8:16] they traveled to the Mount Sinai they
[8:18] were at the base but they couldn't go to
[8:20] the top
[8:22] but it was at the top of the mountain
[8:23] that God came down
[8:25] and as it reads in verse 28 of Hebrews
[8:28] 12 we skip to this part and we'll come
[8:30] back to verse 25 here in a second
[8:33] just so you can see that this is
[8:35] this is the kingdom wherefore we receive
[8:37] in a kingdom which cannot be moved this
[8:39] is what he says Mount Zion is it's a
[8:41] kingdom that cannot be moved let us have
[8:43] Grace whereby we may serve God
[8:45] acceptably with reverence and godly fear
[8:48] for our God is a consuming fire that
[8:51] fire came down at the top of Mount Sinai
[8:54] there's something about these showdowns
[8:56] whether it be Mount Carmel Mount
[8:57] Transfiguration if you want to look at
[8:58] Mount Sinai in view too in this Mount
[9:00] Zion it's not the base where the
[9:02] activity happens it's at the top it's at
[9:04] the peak where the the fire came down
[9:06] and God was a consuming fire at the top
[9:09] of that mountain in Mount Sinai and Paul
[9:11] is seeing this in type in an image
[9:13] you've come to a kingdom so let us serve
[9:16] god with reverence and godly fear for
[9:18] our God is a consuming fire
[9:21] as he said you've come to Mount Zion the
[9:24] city of God and he begins to describe
[9:25] these elements into Jesus the media to
[9:27] the New Covenant he's introducing Mount
[9:30] Zion Christ as the foundation and as he
[9:33] introduces it he also prophesies of the
[9:36] finishing of the completion of Mount
[9:37] Zion
[9:38] so if you look at verse 25
[9:48] I hope I'm not going too fast for you I
[9:50] apologize if my my pacing isn't just
[9:53] right
[9:54] in verse 25 it says see that you refuse
[9:57] not him that speaketh
[9:59] for if they escape not who refused him
[10:02] that spake on Earth
[10:04] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[10:07] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[10:10] and and I'll say this now
[10:13] that what one of the things that Drew me
[10:15] to this is how that in Isaiah chapter 4
[10:18] it says and it shall come to pass that
[10:20] he that is left in Zion and he that
[10:22] remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be Called
[10:24] holy and everyone that is written among
[10:26] the living in Jerusalem
[10:28] and it's speaking of those who have
[10:30] escaped the judgments those that have
[10:32] escaped the Wrath those that have
[10:33] escaped from the the times that are
[10:36] being mentioned of hear it even in the
[10:39] chapter three I've been drawing more
[10:40] from chapter three than I have chapter
[10:42] four and how there's there's this image
[10:45] of a Daughter of Zion that's judged but
[10:48] then there's those that have escaped
[10:50] and and the image that was before me is
[10:52] how you have Revelation 17 Revelations
[10:54] 18 and it's this beautiful church this
[10:57] powerful church and God calls the people
[10:59] out of it that they might escape the
[11:01] plagues that are coming down upon it and
[11:04] this woman that claims to be the Church
[11:05] of God God's going to judge her and
[11:08] there's going to be judgments upon her
[11:09] but there's a people that is the bride
[11:11] because God's calling a bride out of the
[11:13] church they're the ones that escape
[11:15] and as there is a voice that calls the
[11:18] bride out of Babylon it's that same
[11:20] voice that pronounces the Judgment upon
[11:22] it
[11:23] and here we have them saying that if you
[11:25] refuse The Voice How Can You Escape
[11:30] and there's there's just something that
[11:31] has impressed me about the end times and
[11:33] this message of the hour and I'm
[11:35] realizing now I took some scriptures out
[11:37] later in the day to where the with the
[11:40] voice of thundering and the voice of
[11:42] lightning the shaking of the earth and
[11:44] all these symbols that we see in under
[11:46] the open of the word and the open of the
[11:48] seals and the very same image that's
[11:50] coming up in the message of the hour
[11:52] verse 26 whose voice then shook the
[11:55] Earth so there on Mount Sinai it shook
[11:57] the Earth
[11:58] but now he hath promised saying
[12:02] yet once more I shake not the Earth only
[12:05] but also heaven and the language he's
[12:08] using
[12:09] uh you could use
[12:11] you see this here in a moment that
[12:12] there's there's some
[12:14] application to the Messiah making
[12:16] himself known in that day and that time
[12:19] but there's a forward-looking promise of
[12:21] this
[12:22] and shaking up the Earth only but also
[12:23] heaven and this word yet once more
[12:26] signify the removing of those things
[12:28] that are shaken once more again it's
[12:30] going to come again
[12:31] there's things going to be shaken that
[12:33] it's going to be shaken again so he's
[12:35] using this language to say that once
[12:37] more there's going to be a shaking and
[12:40] this word yet once more signify the
[12:42] removing of those things that are shaken
[12:44] as of things that are made
[12:46] that those things which cannot be shaken
[12:48] May remain
[12:49] it's going to be a blasting fourth
[12:52] there's going to be winds that that goal
[12:54] if whether you want to look at it the
[12:55] whether it be the Breath of God or the
[12:57] judgments of God or storms or agitation
[12:59] even as God says I'm going to send a
[13:02] strong delusion I'm going to allow
[13:03] things to come and it's going to shake
[13:05] those who can be shaken there's going to
[13:07] be an agitating causing people to
[13:09] teeter-totter it's going to be a shaking
[13:10] down there's going to be an overthrowing
[13:12] there's going to be people that are cast
[13:13] down and agitated and Disturbed but
[13:15] that's the the tearing down of those
[13:17] things that are made that the things
[13:20] that cannot be shaken remain in
[13:23] and whether we want to accept it or not
[13:25] I think this would be helpful for some
[13:27] of us maybe to look at it this way
[13:28] the agitation that takes place in our
[13:30] lives and the stirring and the teetering
[13:32] that's taking place that's God's way of
[13:34] getting all the things that have been
[13:36] made out of you so that the things that
[13:38] are perfect will remain and we're put
[13:41] into The Crucible sometimes and we're
[13:42] put on The Potter's Wheel and we go
[13:44] through difficulties and we go through
[13:45] uh tribulation and we go through
[13:47] Temptation and we go through great
[13:48] sorrows and testings but listen we've
[13:50] got to have that anchor that tells us
[13:52] I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God
[13:55] and nothing's going to change that and
[13:57] he's committed to me to see that I'll
[13:59] come forth tried but as pure gold
[14:03] and so there'll be a shaking so that the
[14:05] things that can be shaken will be shaken
[14:08] and when I am trying I'll come forth
[14:10] purged
[14:12] cleansed and whole
[14:15] he's Paul is speaking of how a voice
[14:17] shook the Earth
[14:19] and a voice shook the Earth when the law
[14:20] was given at Mount Sinai but if I could
[14:23] put it this way another Mount voice is
[14:24] going to shake again it's going to be a
[14:26] blast to go forth it's going to be the
[14:28] voice of God in the end times and it's
[14:29] going to cause a shaking in Earth and in
[14:31] heaven
[14:33] and Paul is drawing from haggai chapter
[14:36] 2
[14:37] if you could turn there with me to
[14:38] haggai chapter 2 verses 20 to 23.
[14:45] it says again the word of the Lord came
[14:47] unto haggai and the four and 20th day of
[14:49] the month saying Speak to zerubulo
[14:52] governor of Judah now this is a type of
[14:55] Christ
[14:57] and there is an image of Christ that's
[14:59] in this and even the Jews
[15:02] and even the the teachers and their oral
[15:05] tradition they they seize the ruble as a
[15:08] type of the Messiah we see Christ being
[15:10] typified typified here speak to
[15:13] zerubbabel governor of Judah saying I
[15:15] will shake the heavens and the Earth you
[15:17] can see how Paul is using this very
[15:19] language I will shake the heavens and
[15:21] the Earth
[15:22] I will overthrow the Throne of Kingdoms
[15:25] I will destroy the strength of the
[15:27] kingdoms of the heathen and I will
[15:30] overthrow the Chariots and those that
[15:31] ride in them and the horses and the
[15:33] writers shall come down Everyone by the
[15:35] sword of his brother
[15:37] now this is the this is the image the
[15:39] prophetic image that Paul is drawing
[15:41] from when he says once more I shake not
[15:45] the Earth only but also heaven
[15:47] and when he comes when he speaks of that
[15:50] he's he's hearkening to haggai chapter 2
[15:52] verses 20 to 23 and to Hebrew this would
[15:56] have been something that hopefully they
[15:57] would have had in their minds that oh
[15:59] he's going to speak and when he speaks
[16:01] it's going to shake heavens and earth
[16:02] and it's going to overthrow kingdoms
[16:04] it's going to overthrow powers and
[16:07] there's there's a way that you can
[16:08] actually they say that you can break
[16:09] this up and recognize these different
[16:11] kingdoms the kingdom of the Heathen the
[16:13] Chariots the horse and writers and
[16:16] they'll try to break it up historically
[16:18] how there's been an overthrowing of
[16:19] these Kings and there's different ways
[16:21] that they could overlay this I I think
[16:23] some of that's fun to do but for this
[16:26] for these purposes I want you to
[16:28] recognize that Paul is pointing to a
[16:30] prophecy of the Old Testament bringing
[16:32] it Forward into the New Testament and as
[16:34] he says I'm going to shake uh Heaven and
[16:36] Earth that the things that can be shaken
[16:39] will be shaken the kingdoms of that they
[16:42] would have thought of Kingdoms the
[16:43] Throne of the Throne of Kingdoms and the
[16:45] strength of Kingdoms of the Heathen and
[16:47] their chair and those that ride them and
[16:48] the horses and the writers and everyone
[16:50] the sword of his brother that they would
[16:52] have thought of these kingdoms being
[16:53] destroyed so then when he gets to verse
[16:55] 28 says but you're part of a kingdom
[16:57] that's not going to be destroyed
[17:00] so they would have been thinking about
[17:01] heathen kingdoms worldly kingdoms the
[17:03] things of this world and in that day
[17:05] saith the Lord of hosts I will take the
[17:07] osiruba my servant the son of shittil
[17:10] saith the Lord and will make thee as a
[17:13] Signet this is a ring as a seal
[17:15] so this is this is a this is a ceiling
[17:18] this is a sign I have for I have chosen
[17:20] the saith the Lord of hosts
[17:22] and zerubbable is Christ
[17:25] the Messiah King this is who's spoken of
[17:27] here and this prophecy in haggai too is
[17:30] that all worldly kingdoms must be
[17:33] overthrown
[17:35] and Christ it's even spoken Christ says
[17:38] it himself in John chapter 12 31 now is
[17:41] the Judgment of this world now the
[17:43] prince of this world is cast out so he
[17:46] was using he was putting himself in the
[17:48] very language of haggai that this is
[17:50] what the Messiah is to do that I am I'm
[17:52] coming and by my death burial and
[17:54] Resurrection there's going to be a price
[17:56] paid there's going to be a loosening
[17:58] from the the chains of sin the price
[18:01] paid for the elect that they might be
[18:03] free from that spiritual bondage so we
[18:05] see this in Christ the Messiah
[18:09] that all worldly kingdoms must be torn
[18:12] down
[18:13] and the kingdom of God must prevail
[18:17] I was thinking about the word
[18:19] how brother Branham is using preeminence
[18:21] preeminence
[18:22] and and it has it has a royal Regal
[18:26] sound to it
[18:27] and that his eminence
[18:29] it would speak of one who's in royal
[18:31] power this the most Sovereign and Christ
[18:34] is to be preeminent and it's bringing
[18:37] into view the kingdom Christ is Mystery
[18:38] God revealed his centering us on the
[18:40] fact that this is the kingdom the
[18:42] headship declares that the king is here
[18:45] and so there is a the kingdom of God
[18:47] here must Prevail the Throne of Kingdoms
[18:49] of this world the strength of the
[18:50] kingdoms of the heathen they're all
[18:53] going to be tore down
[18:55] now this isn't necessarily happening in
[18:57] just an instant in a moment they're all
[18:59] banished because here we are in the time
[19:01] that we're living in now and we're
[19:03] living in an age that Satan would have
[19:04] showed Christ and said I'll give it to
[19:06] you if you'll worship me
[19:08] now I'm gonna try to swing here with
[19:11] this momentum
[19:15] as a type of Christ
[19:18] I hope that some of you been listening
[19:20] to a reading future home
[19:22] and I don't know how many times I've
[19:23] hinted at that
[19:25] uh but someone here recently told me
[19:27] that they just started reading it and
[19:29] listening to us like Well there must be
[19:30] a you know a certain uh tipping point
[19:32] where if you hit added enough
[19:34] and we know that one of the things that
[19:37] brother Brown has to me the
[19:39] uh the main theme of that that brother
[19:41] Brown keeps identifying is whatever God
[19:44] does to the Earth he's done to the
[19:46] individual and whether or not you we
[19:48] could look at it this way say oh well
[19:50] I'm Justified Sanctified sealed with the
[19:51] Holy Ghost and we see that type in The
[19:53] Believer brother Brahm is dropping down
[19:55] and showing that we can see the same
[19:56] things happening uh to the Earth and and
[19:59] this is a some of the stages of the
[20:01] earth it wasn't new theology to brother
[20:03] Branham but he takes some of the things
[20:06] that had been before and he actually
[20:07] places them correctly to see where the
[20:10] actual stages of the earth were and how
[20:13] it received what we received now if you
[20:16] could think of that for a moment what
[20:18] God does to the Earth he doesn't type to
[20:20] the believer and to the bride
[20:22] and then we have here in haggai a
[20:25] prophecy that I will overthrow the
[20:27] Throne of Kingdoms I will destroy the
[20:29] strength of the kingdoms of the Heathen
[20:30] I will overthrow the Chariots and those
[20:32] that ride in them and the horses and the
[20:34] Riders shall come down Everyone by the
[20:35] sword of his brother if there's going to
[20:37] be a tearing down of Kingdoms upon the
[20:39] face of the Earth in only one remain
[20:41] then we have a promise that even in our
[20:44] lives every Kingdom can be destroyed
[20:48] every stronghold anything that's
[20:50] contrary any Veil that we've built up in
[20:53] our heart any partition between us and
[20:54] Christ that that ought to be our desire
[20:57] that that was at the heart and if it
[20:59] took me this long to finally say it but
[21:01] that was at the heart of the perfect
[21:02] love series I was on is I was realizing
[21:05] that I that the perfect love that I want
[21:07] to attain to is when he has my whole
[21:09] heart that there's just nothing between
[21:11] he and I there's nothing hidden there's
[21:13] nothing I'm hiding there's no pretense
[21:15] in my life but that he has my whole
[21:17] heart
[21:21] is a type of Christ of the Messiah
[21:24] and according to haggai and
[21:27] the book of Hebrews he is to shake
[21:31] and there's destructive power in this
[21:33] shaking the voice is going to thunder
[21:35] forth there's going to be a separating
[21:37] out there's going to be a destruction as
[21:39] it says I will overthrow kingdoms and
[21:41] the strength of Kingdoms and chariots
[21:43] and those that write in them this is the
[21:45] prophecy obserubbabel
[21:47] and the Very word zerubba will mean sown
[21:51] in Babylon
[21:52] again we see that image of the the
[21:54] Gentile bride the word to be sown into
[21:56] the hearts of a gentile bride Christ hid
[21:59] in a gentile woman Christ manifested in
[22:02] a gentile bride
[22:04] and this is Aruba which we see Christ
[22:06] the word as it's going to uh separate
[22:09] and destroy
[22:10] all that offends
[22:12] as we see that image in the parable of
[22:14] the tears and the Sea the seed that is
[22:16] song that I'm going to separate out all
[22:18] the worldly kingdoms I'm going to
[22:19] separate all the tears I'm going to bind
[22:21] them together there's going to be a
[22:22] purging so the wheat stands on its own
[22:25] as we've said before the same word that
[22:27] judges destroys separates binds together
[22:31] is the same word that heals restores
[22:35] perfects completes
[22:38] and and that's one of the reasons why we
[22:40] took the time in the devil's life
[22:42] and the truth of God is there's there's
[22:45] parts of the word of God that are
[22:47] judging judging the false church and and
[22:51] it's and if we are if we receive our
[22:53] judgment and we repent then there's a
[22:55] message for those who continue
[22:57] I didn't come to it but one thing that's
[22:59] remarkable to me in the scripture is
[23:02] when God judges and kadus barnia and
[23:05] numbers 14 he judges him and says those
[23:08] of a certain age you won't go into the
[23:10] promised land except Joshua and Caleb
[23:12] and says you're all going to die in the
[23:14] wilderness and then the very next
[23:16] chapter he says speak unto the children
[23:18] of Israel that when you go into the
[23:19] promised land in other words that
[23:21] message wasn't to those who were going
[23:23] to die in the wilderness it was to the
[23:24] generation that was going to possess the
[23:26] promise and so God is going to speak to
[23:29] those who can possess the promise once
[23:31] the judgments get given to those who
[23:33] can't pertain to it God's not going to
[23:35] shut his mouth and have you exist under
[23:37] this judgment message and this
[23:39] condemning and oh I guess we're all
[23:42] condemned and oh I guess the door is
[23:43] shut no there's a message to those who
[23:45] can receive it of life to the bride
[23:48] and so there's a there's a message that
[23:51] judges and separates and destroys but
[23:52] there's the same message that completes
[23:54] and perfects and finishes and heals
[23:57] and in the Bible zerubbable is the one
[23:59] that led the Jews out of Babylon
[24:01] and then laid the foundation of the
[24:03] temple now that that I've been studying
[24:06] on the temple
[24:07] and because I think it just fits so
[24:09] perfectly in the subject of the kingdom
[24:10] and in this image of the Tabernacle in
[24:13] the temple you can see Christ and his
[24:14] bride Heaven and Earth
[24:16] and so there's an image of king and
[24:18] queen in there and the bride in this
[24:20] Temple and so zerubbabel leads Jews out
[24:23] of Babylon and he lays the foundation of
[24:26] the temples and the Book of haggai that
[24:27] we read that God is saying what have you
[24:29] done you laid the foundation but now you
[24:31] haven't done anything else you haven't
[24:33] finished it so zerubbabel lays the
[24:36] foundation Christ is that Foundation
[24:38] Christ in his first coming that we see
[24:41] the foundation and the Cornerstone of
[24:44] Mount Zion
[24:47] doesn't just lay the foundation
[24:50] and in Zechariah Chapter 4 verses 7 to
[24:53] 10 I love it when the people listening
[24:55] are already way ahead of you
[24:58] and they're thinking we were wondering
[24:59] when when in the world you'd get to
[25:00] Zachariah
[25:02] but Zechariah Chapter 4 verses 7 8 9 and
[25:04] 10. it says then he answered and spoken
[25:07] to me saying this is the word of the
[25:08] Lord undeserable now remember in haggai
[25:11] he's gonna I'm going to shake the
[25:13] heavens on the earth I'm going to
[25:14] overthrow and durable is going to be a
[25:16] Signet he's going to be a seal
[25:18] and so this is a tearing down but notice
[25:21] this other side to it
[25:22] though this is the word of Lord
[25:23] undeservable saying not by might nor by
[25:26] power but by my spirit saith the Lord of
[25:29] hosts and his word is spirit in his life
[25:32] what art thou o great Mountain
[25:35] and this is this is the worldly kingdoms
[25:38] these are the kingdoms of this world oh
[25:40] great Mountain before is Aruba Thou
[25:42] shalt become a plane and there's going
[25:44] to be a leveling out there's going to be
[25:46] a destroying and a tearing down and he
[25:48] shall bring forth The Headstone thereof
[25:50] with shoutings crying Grace Grace undo
[25:53] it now there should be so many things
[25:55] from the message that would just pop uh
[25:57] when we read that The Headstone the
[25:59] Capstone crying Grace Grace moreover the
[26:02] word of the Lord came unto me saying the
[26:04] hands of zeruba will have laid the
[26:06] foundation of this house
[26:07] his hands shall also finish it
[26:11] so the very one Christ who is the
[26:13] beginner the author of the Christian
[26:15] faith and he'll come in the end time and
[26:18] be the Perfecter of it he's going to be
[26:20] the finisher of it
[26:22] he said that this one who laid the
[26:25] foundation will finish it and thou shalt
[26:26] know that the Lord of hosts has sent me
[26:28] unto you for who hath despise the day of
[26:31] small things that's quite a statement
[26:34] as the pyramid is built up to its
[26:37] finishing there's a lot less work that
[26:39] goes on
[26:40] a lot of work is done in the lane of the
[26:42] foundation even the pre uh foundation
[26:44] work to dig things out and put in
[26:47] Footers and put in the plumbing and
[26:48] electrical and everything goes in and
[26:49] you lay the foundation and some of your
[26:51] greatest expense is in the very
[26:53] beginning and your hardest work and as
[26:56] it comes down to Perfection and
[26:57] finishing up into that final move and
[26:59] it's just maybe a piece of tape here a
[27:01] little bit of finish work there it may
[27:03] be small things but it's the perfecting
[27:06] I says who hath despise the day of small
[27:08] things for they shall rejoice and shall
[27:11] see the plummet that's the Plumb line
[27:13] that which is used to measure height and
[27:15] and depth is a measuring line which we
[27:18] know for the believer the only Plumb
[27:20] line is the word of God
[27:22] it's the only Plumb line we have we
[27:24] shall see the plummet in the hand of
[27:25] zeruble with those seven
[27:28] and they are the eyes of the Lord which
[27:29] run to and fro through the whole Earth
[27:32] if you come into the church ages in the
[27:34] Book of Revelation you'll see in these
[27:36] words an image of Christ in his bride
[27:38] but notice it's zerubbabel which is
[27:41] Christ with those seven
[27:43] it's a figure of Christ out together
[27:46] with the messengers to the church you
[27:48] have seven Messengers to the church but
[27:50] then remember the last Messenger to the
[27:52] church is the life messenger the Lord
[27:56] Jesus Christ himself
[27:58] is the one who has in his hand the
[28:00] measuring line the measuring stick the
[28:02] word of God
[28:04] therefore we see then
[28:06] as Paul is prophesying of Mount Zion
[28:09] and maybe there's a broad Foundation as
[28:11] the body of Christ is built up it gets
[28:12] narrower and narrower to the top
[28:15] remember as it gets narrower and
[28:16] narrower there's a certain way you have
[28:17] to walk
[28:18] certain way you have to live certain
[28:20] narrowing down
[28:22] I think you could think of those
[28:23] different statements that brother banham
[28:25] refers to that
[28:30] brother Bradham says this and God's only
[28:31] provided place of worship
[28:39] he says the lutherans this is I'm
[28:41] reading this this statement here a
[28:43] couple statements before we close it
[28:45] just kind of come back to being unshaken
[28:47] just to see how brother Brown places the
[28:50] capping in this end time
[28:52] and I'm wanting you to see this image in
[28:54] in Hebrews chapter 12 or hope that you
[28:56] can see it at least in type
[28:57] the lutherans under justification the
[28:59] feet raised it like that
[29:02] Wesley under sanctification
[29:04] the Pentecostals under the arms the
[29:06] works and deeds and so forth have the
[29:08] Armenian had to be legalist had to be
[29:09] Armenian had to be a legalist
[29:11] but now we come to the Head the Capstone
[29:15] brother Bam's laboring to get this point
[29:17] across
[29:18] quite frequently
[29:20] to see the work of God Through the Ages
[29:22] and to do so in a way to where we
[29:25] appreciate what has been
[29:27] and recognize that these are the things
[29:29] that were built on top of
[29:31] and I think there's a Temptation
[29:33] sometimes to want to kick away certain
[29:35] things but you have to be careful what
[29:37] you knock out from underneath you
[29:39] because if certain things haven't been
[29:41] right and haven't been correct then we
[29:43] have nothing to stand on
[29:45] so now we've come to the Head the
[29:46] Capstone what a statement We've Come To
[29:48] The Head the Capstone he brings in
[29:50] Zechariah 4 Grace Grace the Capstone
[29:53] cried The Headstone crying what Grace
[29:57] Grace
[29:58] from death and and and Creed into a
[30:02] Living Word of the Living God this is
[30:05] what we've done we've been called out of
[30:07] death we've been called out of Babylon
[30:09] we've been called out a dead
[30:10] denominationalism called out of
[30:11] organized religion you've passed from
[30:13] death and created into a Living Word of
[30:15] the Living God what a resurrection he
[30:17] said that was what a resurrection this
[30:19] is to be resurrected out of dark
[30:21] denominationalism
[30:23] he's saying this is The Headstone crying
[30:25] Grace Grace pass from death into life
[30:27] from a Creed into the Living Word of God
[30:29] he said God's only provided plan for his
[30:32] age
[30:32] his sons in the word age quickened by
[30:36] the spirit like a spark that's lit off
[30:38] of something to make it alive keep
[30:40] reading it if you have time it's
[30:41] beautiful poetry this is where we're
[30:43] living today and and for it don't get
[30:46] kind of caught up in the theological
[30:47] sense of it where you can kind of get
[30:49] your head lost in the types and
[30:50] Tabernacles and feasts and everything
[30:52] and just get dizzy reading the Old
[30:54] Testament but this is something that
[30:55] means something in our daily lives and
[30:57] power and overcoming the healing power
[30:59] of God the delivering power of God his
[31:02] sons in the word age his daughters in
[31:05] the word age quickened by the spirit
[31:07] like a spark that's lit off something to
[31:09] make it alive
[31:11] this is something living
[31:13] in this Capstone age this Capstone time
[31:16] the climax
[31:18] coming back to the sermon Christ is
[31:20] revealed in his own word but the bam is
[31:22] referring to Zechariah 14 7 it shall be
[31:24] light at the evening time he's really
[31:26] amplifying that when he says this
[31:28] pointing directly at those scriptures if
[31:30] I could say it this way he's putting his
[31:31] finger on Zechariah 14 he said that's
[31:33] the forming of the body from the feet
[31:35] coming up
[31:37] the light at the top of Mount Zion the
[31:40] Capstone coming to seal it at the end
[31:42] that's the format of the body from the
[31:44] feet coming up when he was here on Earth
[31:46] he was the Sun the lightness then he was
[31:49] killed the church took his place then
[31:51] martyrdom and went through the Dark Ages
[31:53] and began to build on the foundation
[31:55] coming out then where does the light the
[31:58] sight come from at the top of the head
[32:01] see that Vision Nebuchadnezzar see him
[32:03] going down from the beginning of the
[32:04] Gentile age before the blood was shed
[32:06] from them and made an atonement they
[32:08] were proselytes brought in but notice
[32:10] they went right down right down right
[32:12] down to the bottom in symbol see brought
[32:15] it down from the head to the feet now it
[32:17] started right back coming back the
[32:19] church coming back from the feet coming
[32:20] up now it's in the head time
[32:24] now notice the light
[32:26] you can't see with your hands yet it's
[32:29] part of the body you can't see with your
[32:31] ears yet it can hear you can't see with
[32:33] the nose yet it smells you can't see
[32:36] with the lips though it speaks see that
[32:38] was the Pentecostal age but now it's in
[32:41] the eye time and keep following here he
[32:43] says the scene now there isn't one
[32:45] moving faculty beyond the eye is that
[32:47] right
[32:48] so now when you have when you come to
[32:50] the prophetic time and the eye time
[32:52] after that Pentecostal time watch what
[32:55] what what comes next the next is the
[32:59] intelligence which is Christ itself who
[33:02] controls the whole body
[33:03] [Music]
[33:04] there has to come and that's what the
[33:06] the the role of the Prophet was in the
[33:08] ministry of Elijah as he's there to to
[33:11] introduce the intelligence there's this
[33:14] this crowning in the end time there Upon
[33:16] Our foreheads the intelligence there is
[33:19] a crowning of Mount Zion there's a
[33:21] capping of Mount Zion there's a there's
[33:23] an intelligence that comes to us at the
[33:24] open of the word the next is the
[33:26] intelligence it's Christ himself who
[33:28] controls the whole body from the head
[33:30] ship down
[33:32] this is the image he's bringing us
[33:34] through historically to see it in the
[33:36] Old Testament from head to feet now in
[33:38] the New Testament or the Gentile bride
[33:40] through church ages built on up to the
[33:42] Capstone the head the top of Mount Zion
[33:46] he says in the sermon the voice of the
[33:48] sign now if the Lord Jesus Christ the
[33:49] son of God
[33:52] who I've proven by the Bible promised
[33:54] that he would return in the last days
[33:56] and reveal himself in the fullness of
[33:57] his spirit
[33:59] just like the church coming up I know
[34:01] that's a you know another mouthful that
[34:02] maybe I'm just glossing over
[34:04] but that's that has some heft to it he
[34:07] promised to return the last days and
[34:08] reveal himself in the fullness of his
[34:10] Spirit just like the church coming up
[34:12] like it comes from a human being all the
[34:14] way from the feet come up the thighs Up
[34:16] To The Head and the head is the head of
[34:17] the body
[34:18] and the bodies come up ever since the
[34:20] first church come right on up in this in
[34:23] the reformations has come up till now
[34:26] it's come through justification
[34:28] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[34:31] now there are ways that you could kind
[34:34] of cut this up
[34:37] and begin to look at it based upon the
[34:39] things that brother bam taught to where
[34:42] and I want to say this carefully but
[34:44] please help understand what I mean when
[34:46] I say this you can make the mistake that
[34:49] only the Holy Ghost is only given in
[34:51] this age
[34:52] but brother man said every age is the
[34:54] age of the Holy Ghost for the True
[34:55] Believer
[34:56] and there have been genuine members
[34:59] added to the body of Christ from the
[35:00] beginning through the true sill which is
[35:02] the new birth that's been happening
[35:03] throughout the church ages we don't want
[35:06] to change uh change the teaching of the
[35:08] message to say oh well now now under the
[35:11] message of the hour now we are the only
[35:13] ones the bride is having her Revival and
[35:15] it's the power of the god poured out by
[35:17] the baptism holy ghost in no other age
[35:19] had it no every age has been the age of
[35:21] the Holy Ghost for the True Believer and
[35:23] we're not just in the age of the Holy
[35:25] Ghost we're in the ages brother Graham
[35:27] said the Holy Ghost itself this isn't
[35:29] the age of just a baptism this just is
[35:31] an age of individuals being added this
[35:33] is something of an adoption age this is
[35:35] the word age this is the bride ages
[35:37] brother Brown calls it
[35:39] says it's come through justification
[35:40] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[35:42] now it's the head Christ coming to the
[35:46] body the body of Christ he is the one
[35:49] who knows that's the intelligence
[35:51] it's the head coming to the body of the
[35:53] body of Christ he is the one who knows
[35:55] you could go back in Christ the mystery
[35:57] God revealed and see how these things he
[35:59] teaches through 63 64-65 connect back to
[36:02] these things he was preaching then he
[36:04] says my hand don't know how to act just
[36:05] by my head but he's the one who knows
[36:08] that's the reason he is the word
[36:11] it's come to the Head
[36:13] as Paul brought the church to the base
[36:15] the foundation of Mount Zion we've come
[36:18] to the climax
[36:19] we're coming to the finishing
[36:22] this is this is at the top
[36:25] and they're at the top
[36:27] you know the Capstone is a mini pyramid
[36:29] in itself
[36:31] and the pyramid had never been capped
[36:33] and now you have a a Capstone that comes
[36:35] and settles down this is the time we're
[36:37] living in right now the ceiling time the
[36:39] camping time
[36:41] and I share this
[36:44] with you
[36:46] to as brother bam said in Christ is
[36:48] revealed in his own work to stabilize
[36:49] you
[36:51] to see where we are in the end time to
[36:53] have confidence in what God is doing
[36:55] and and and I want to just close with a
[36:57] few statements here brother Adam says
[36:58] we're in the last days
[37:01] and the last hours of the days
[37:04] do you see him now in his word
[37:07] and all of his word made manifest right
[37:10] here before us
[37:12] this is this is what I'm wanting to see
[37:14] I know I've done it very quickly maybe
[37:16] I've done it um uh in a uh
[37:20] maybe in an immature way I don't know
[37:22] but maybe there's just been a lot that's
[37:24] kind of been pushed out there maybe it
[37:25] seems messy and maybe it's done in a way
[37:28] where there's a lot there to try to pick
[37:30] up and grab a hold of and if I've if
[37:32] it's been done in a way that's clumsy
[37:34] let me just say this I'm throwing a lot
[37:36] out there hoping that there's something
[37:37] that sticks in your heart that says
[37:39] God's fulfilling his word God's right on
[37:42] time prophecies are being fulfilled
[37:44] Zechariah 14 Zechariah 4 haggai 2
[37:47] Hebrews 12. the word of God is just
[37:50] clicking right along things are being
[37:52] fulfilled and you are ordained to see it
[37:55] you ordained to see God fulfilling his
[37:57] word in the age that we're living in
[37:58] your a son and daughter of God in the
[38:01] word age to be quickened to be made
[38:03] Alive by the word of God this is the
[38:05] time we're living He says do you see him
[38:07] now in his word that's what I want you
[38:09] to be able to see is to see him now in
[38:11] his word to see him in the message of
[38:13] the hour to see him in the messenger to
[38:15] see him brought up to the church ages to
[38:17] see where we stand right now as his
[38:19] Gentile bride in this Union time he says
[38:22] do you see him made manifest right here
[38:24] before us
[38:26] so then with that he says oh Church of
[38:28] the Living God get to your feet believe
[38:31] him with all that's in you
[38:33] what a statement stand up on your feet
[38:36] uh don't be cast down don't be Dilly
[38:39] down around don't be laying around he
[38:41] says get to your feet believe him with
[38:43] all that's in you I hope that's
[38:46] something that we're learning through
[38:47] everything we go through through our ups
[38:49] and downs and our ins and outs and all
[38:50] our trials is that we're learning to
[38:52] believe him with everything that's in US
[38:58] he says hold to that little will
[39:02] if you could just think of that then
[39:04] hauled to that little will in the middle
[39:06] of the will
[39:08] he says Let It stabilize every move
[39:11] and every motion
[39:13] that you make
[39:15] let it stabilize
[39:17] every emotion that you make
[39:20] every thought that you have
[39:23] may it be controlled by this tower on
[39:25] the inside of you
[39:27] because God is sitting right in his word
[39:29] of this hour in the evening light
[39:31] showing forth the light sounds like for
[39:34] our God is a consuming fire
[39:36] that says let every thought be
[39:38] controlled by him which is on the inside
[39:40] of you church of living God he says get
[39:42] to your feet believe him with all that's
[39:43] in you hold to that little will in the
[39:46] middle of the will let it stabilize
[39:49] hold to something Beyond yourself yet
[39:51] within yourself let it stabilize every
[39:53] move every motion every thought
[39:57] that's where our stability comes
[40:00] that's that's where it must come from
[40:03] that's where we must find ourselves
[40:06] being fed
[40:07] my wife has been testifying to me and
[40:10] testifying how in her heart she had
[40:12] desire to know what it means that men
[40:14] shall not live by every by bread alone
[40:16] but by the word of God the bread of God
[40:18] the every word that proceedeth out of
[40:21] the mouth of God said well what does
[40:22] even mean to live by that and and
[40:24] there's a there's there's a lot to think
[40:26] about in that statement that we can't
[40:28] live by bread alone and there's a lot
[40:31] that we could say is the bread
[40:34] but we got to know what proceeds out of
[40:36] the mouth of God because that's what we
[40:39] live by there's no systems there's no
[40:42] order there's no man-made nothing
[40:44] there's nothing of this world that feeds
[40:46] the flesh that we can live by that that
[40:49] in itself will give us the sustaining
[40:51] power that we need but we must have the
[40:53] word of God
[40:56] and it's it's sure
[40:59] on Christ the solid rock I Stand All
[41:03] underground you sinking sand
[41:07] brother Branham at the end of a sermon
[41:09] go wake Jesus
[41:13] I I don't have any more
[41:16] um slides I don't believe now so if you
[41:19] could just bear with me here for a
[41:20] moment
[41:22] he says I see two sisters sitting here
[41:24] tonight in wheelchairs
[41:27] I did it's I we're just making awesome
[41:30] time tonight in and out here we come we
[41:32] might be able to beat the Pentecostals
[41:34] there tonight
[41:37] maybe the Lord will have his way till
[41:38] midnight over there
[41:40] he says I see two sisters sitting here
[41:42] tonight in wheelchairs just listen to
[41:44] this just let this strike home
[41:46] see no doubt but then women has tried
[41:48] everything in the world to get well
[41:50] quite a statement
[41:53] and then he says there may be people
[41:55] here with cancer
[41:56] someone with heart trouble
[41:58] and the doctor's skill has worked
[42:00] everything they can to help you but
[42:02] you're at the end
[42:04] there's nothing can be done
[42:08] let's put ourselves in this position
[42:12] and then he says have we forgot who is
[42:14] with us
[42:16] who is this
[42:17] selling life solom Maine with us
[42:20] who is it to give the promise he is the
[42:24] word
[42:25] it's never been taken from us yet
[42:28] I want it so in my heart if they ever
[42:30] take this
[42:31] I got it here
[42:34] but the word is still with us here's the
[42:37] word and the things that the doctor
[42:39] can't remedy the things that the church
[42:42] world can't remedy we have the creator
[42:45] of all things with us
[42:48] Hallelujah
[42:50] it begins to go into the ecumenical
[42:51] council
[42:53] now the Pentecostals are going right
[42:55] into it and the Pentecostals kind of
[42:57] represent the
[42:58] that last stage of development
[43:01] in the plant
[43:02] and as they've grown up to the the that
[43:05] last stage of development and the
[43:06] restoration of the gifts brings it looks
[43:09] to be the full bodies brought back they
[43:11] go right back into air and there's a
[43:12] falling away
[43:14] I says they're going right into the
[43:16] Pentecostals they're going right into
[43:17] the ecumenical movement the World
[43:19] Council of churches he says now the
[43:21] others will speaking of all these
[43:23] denominations and organizations where
[43:25] Jesus said the two spirits in the last
[43:26] days would almost deceive the very
[43:28] elected if it were possible
[43:30] but the elected Ones Will no different
[43:35] the elected ones were no different
[43:37] there's your Matthew 24 24 but we're in
[43:40] a time of trouble
[43:41] where there isn't a minister in the
[43:43] world can stop our denominations from
[43:45] joining this ecumenical council they're
[43:47] already in it
[43:48] no matter how many things God did how
[43:50] blessed he was Among Us they went right
[43:52] into it anyhow you can't stop it that's
[43:54] just all there is to it
[43:55] they're going to do it
[43:58] and it's just an amazing parallel the
[44:01] physical sickness and the religious
[44:03] sickness
[44:04] the spiritual sickness the physical
[44:06] sickness just right there in parallel he
[44:08] says troubles that cannot be remedied by
[44:10] the church
[44:12] then as soon as we find out that
[44:14] you go to the doctor he'll say now if I
[44:17] can look at those two parallels
[44:18] spiritual sickness that the church can't
[44:20] remedy physical sickness that the
[44:22] doctors can't remedy you go to the
[44:24] doctor and say well I'm sorry to tell
[44:25] you but you have cancer
[44:27] he says well quickly that's all he's
[44:28] dead that's all there is to it or she
[44:30] there she they're gone
[44:32] the doctors say well that's parallelism
[44:34] and that's leukemia well right quick
[44:36] they're as good as dead right then
[44:39] this is how the world looks at it
[44:41] remember our caution about whatever you
[44:43] have a symptom we say don't Google it
[44:45] because it ends in one sentence you have
[44:47] cancer and you're going to die no matter
[44:49] what it is
[44:50] I I've been waking up with with uh with
[44:54] uh feathers in my bed and say oh well
[44:55] you probably have cancer and you're
[44:57] going to die right not thinking well
[44:58] what kind of pillows do you have what
[44:59] kind of comforter do you use the world
[45:01] just concludes cancer and you're gonna
[45:03] die and he says that's that's all
[45:06] there's nothing more science can do
[45:08] there's nothing more medicine can do he
[45:10] said fear sets in see but it shouldn't
[45:15] thank you let's just be honest tonight
[45:17] we don't have any cameras on anybody
[45:19] else but me
[45:20] fear sets in doesn't it whatever there's
[45:23] just a little bit of a whisper well it
[45:24] might be this and it might be that and
[45:26] and all it takes is just one uh one
[45:29] little thing to begin to move in your
[45:30] spirit and you feel suffocated
[45:33] you feel a little claustrophobic you
[45:35] feel like you can't get out you feel
[45:36] like you're locked in and that's all it
[45:38] takes just to get your heart rate up a
[45:40] little bit and before you know it you
[45:41] begin to have this field of oh no this
[45:43] is Doom oh no this is where it's going
[45:45] to be but he says you don't have to he
[45:49] says it but it shouldn't
[45:52] why why shouldn't it he says who is this
[45:55] that made the promise
[45:58] as he said earlier have we forgot who's
[46:00] with us
[46:01] who is it that gave the promise
[46:05] he says who is this that made the
[46:07] promise what are we living for
[46:09] why we are we the Church of the Living
[46:12] God
[46:14] why are we filled with the Holy Ghost
[46:17] let me say it this way why are we the
[46:19] Church of the Living God
[46:21] why are we filled with the Holy Ghost
[46:24] to remember in the time of trouble he's
[46:27] still here
[46:29] to remember in the time of trouble he is
[46:32] still here he stabilizes things when
[46:35] brother Bradham said the stabilizers
[46:37] have been put on the ship he saw one who
[46:40] could turn on the light he saw one who
[46:42] was present with us riding with us on
[46:44] the ship who could calm the Raging Sea
[46:46] he saw the very one it was the
[46:48] foundation who'd become The Headstone in
[46:51] the Capstone and he looked at the whole
[46:52] picture he says we don't have anything
[46:54] to worry about God has done exactly what
[46:57] he said he would do
[46:59] Fair sets in but it shouldn't
[47:02] I said who is this that made the promise
[47:05] why are we the Church of the Living God
[47:08] why are we filled with the Holy Ghost
[47:10] why do you have the Holy Ghost why did
[47:12] he give it to you so that you can
[47:13] remember to the time of trouble he's
[47:14] still here and he stabilizes things
[47:18] Christ is the stabilizer
[47:21] sister Elizabeth I hope you don't mind
[47:22] I'll just read your testimony here
[47:26] I just some time ago my wife was given a
[47:29] prognosis by a doctor through different
[47:31] uh visitations and exams and uh They
[47:35] concluded that she had some form of
[47:37] breast cancer
[47:39] and and my wife has wanted to read this
[47:42] she shared some of these testimonies I
[47:43] just feel impressed now I just happen to
[47:45] have it with me I feel impressed to
[47:46] share this I don't like to use our own
[47:48] testimonies ourselves uh because I'm
[47:51] very careful about how certain things
[47:53] get lifted up so I hope you give me a
[47:54] little bit of Grace tonight to share
[47:55] this the the the good side is it's my
[47:58] wife and I think it would be different
[48:00] if it was me he says I would love to
[48:02] give all she says I would love to give
[48:04] all thanks and praise to my Lord Jesus
[48:06] Christ for granting me Faith for a
[48:07] difficult test
[48:09] a few months ago I had a routine exam
[48:11] and a screening for breast cancer
[48:13] three separate tests all came back with
[48:15] abnormalities and ultimately the doctor
[48:17] ordered a biopsy due to his suspicions
[48:19] and he was he was suspicious and
[48:20] believed it it was some form of cancer
[48:22] he's from the day the doctor ordered the
[48:25] biopsy I watched God have his say at
[48:27] every turn
[48:28] and it was on a Wednesday that this
[48:30] happened and she comes to church that
[48:31] night she says the word come forth
[48:33] strongly for my need
[48:34] at the end of the preacher word my heart
[48:37] reached out in faith and grabbed my
[48:39] promise Revelations 21 6 and he said
[48:42] unto me it is done
[48:43] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[48:46] the end
[48:47] I will give unto him that is the thirst
[48:49] of the Fountain of the Water of Life
[48:50] freely
[48:51] now I want you to see this in type
[48:55] how that brother Branham was looking at
[48:57] the beginning and he's looking at the
[48:58] end
[48:59] and when you see the beginning you see
[49:00] the end you can say oh it's done
[49:02] it's finished
[49:04] what do we have to worry about brother
[49:05] but I'm saying why why do we what have
[49:07] we forgot who's with us
[49:09] the very one who made the promises here
[49:11] to confirm the promise the very same
[49:13] satellite that established the church in
[49:15] the beginning he says comes again to
[49:18] finish it in the end it's the same s-o-n
[49:21] in the end
[49:22] he says why are you afraid Church why
[49:24] are you scared he says I am Alpha and
[49:27] Omega the beginning of the end he says
[49:29] it's done
[49:31] it's finished she says I said that's
[49:34] mine that is my promise and I held onto
[49:37] his word and I watched my faith become
[49:39] my eyes
[49:41] the devil tried to bring fear and doubt
[49:43] over the course of five weeks
[49:45] as the devil persisted in his lies each
[49:47] time the Lord responded with his Eternal
[49:49] Word and confirmed his presence with me
[49:52] this is what we ought to be looking for
[49:54] these are the things we ought to be
[49:55] building on Brother David when you were
[49:57] sharing with me last Wednesday night
[49:59] just the testimonies what God's done to
[50:01] declare his presence in the midst of
[50:02] what brother Theo is going through
[50:03] something welled up inside him and says
[50:05] this is how God works sometimes we're
[50:07] trying to look at the the scans and
[50:09] we're trying to look at the the
[50:10] measurements and trying to look at what
[50:12] the doctors say to find something in
[50:13] there that tells us we're healed when
[50:15] God all along is declaring his presence
[50:17] time and time again to take your eyes
[50:20] off what science sees and look to the
[50:22] Unseen and say it's finished
[50:27] the devil try it over and over again I
[50:29] know you all could just put yourselves
[50:30] in this and he says during this time
[50:32] Matthew 4 4 became my flesh became flesh
[50:35] in my walk men shall not live by bread
[50:37] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[50:40] out of the mouth of God
[50:42] his word sustained me during this Needy
[50:44] Time and my faith never strayed from his
[50:47] promise of it is done
[50:50] I never lost one night of sleep never
[50:52] had a moment of fear or ever doubted the
[50:54] outcome his word was my constant as my
[50:57] heart viewed every test through the
[50:58] faith he gave me
[51:00] this is just in the last week or the
[51:02] week before the biopsy came back
[51:04] completely normal and confirmed none of
[51:07] their concerns or suspicions it only
[51:10] confirmed my faith in his word
[51:12] I find myself just thanking him over and
[51:15] over for his grace he showed me to grant
[51:17] me Revelation in my hour of need God
[51:20] will have the final say
[51:22] let it let it just let her testimony be
[51:24] added to yours and the many of you who
[51:26] could testify I know you all if you
[51:28] could have time to write it out you
[51:30] could testify our God is real our the
[51:34] word is alive and it's powerful and as
[51:37] Believers in this end time we ought not
[51:39] to be behind in anything we ought not to
[51:42] live below any privilege but we've got
[51:44] to look to the word of God in the world
[51:46] alone to be our anchor
[51:50] who is it that made the promise
[51:53] what are we living for
[51:55] why are we filled with the Holy Ghost to
[51:57] remember in the time of trouble he's
[51:59] still here
[52:00] he stabilizes things
[52:04] we could have the musicians come
[52:07] brother Branham says in the world has
[52:09] fallen apart
[52:12] he says let's go to this Kingdom
[52:15] let's go we can find
[52:22] your things our thoughts are above
[52:25] where your inheritance lives
[52:27] let's go
[52:29] to this Kingdom
[52:31] let's go where we can find and live
[52:33] after that Kingdom this isn't
[52:35] this isn't a oh one day
[52:38] one day one day the kingdom will come
[52:41] we'll just if we could all just join in
[52:43] a circle and hold hands and sing Kumbaya
[52:45] or we'll work till Jesus comes and one
[52:47] day he's saying no let us go now
[52:52] where we can find and live
[52:56] he said then your thoughts are holy
[52:58] see as I read it earlier let it let it
[53:00] stabilize every move and every motion
[53:03] every thought that you have may be
[53:04] controlled by this tower on the inside
[53:06] of you
[53:09] there's a life that we could be living
[53:10] as believers
[53:13] I say well does that mean we won't ever
[53:15] be sick or you'll be sick but just look
[53:18] look at it through different eyes
[53:20] just look at it differently
[53:22] we just view it differently anything
[53:25] that happens we just view it differently
[53:26] because we can't let fear set in
[53:29] he said fear sets in and I hope I can
[53:31] minister to you in this way that there's
[53:33] Grace in that we know it fear What Fear
[53:36] feels like we've all felt it
[53:39] I've been experiencing some strange
[53:40] things just even this week right there's
[53:43] things that take place in your life and
[53:44] all of a sudden things seize upon you
[53:47] you know where's that coming from why
[53:49] why am I experiencing these distressing
[53:51] emotions why why are these things
[53:53] besetting me and you realize it's just
[53:56] this mind
[53:57] just this body
[53:59] it's susceptible to those things but I
[54:01] got a king on the inside of me there's
[54:04] one sitting on the throne and maybe I
[54:06] need sometimes I need to work my way
[54:08] start doing battle in my head battle
[54:09] with my spirit but I just think to
[54:11] myself let the king rise up brother Adam
[54:14] said oh Church of the Living God get to
[54:16] your feet and brave him with all that's
[54:18] in you I I want the real believer to
[54:22] stand up Let the real never stand up Let
[54:25] The King Stand Up let the bride stand up
[54:27] I say there's something inside of me in
[54:29] those moments I say let them arise let
[54:32] them arise
[54:34] Let It Rise Up
[54:37] oh and it cries out inside I'm
[54:39] distressed I'm I'm stressing out I'm
[54:41] panicking but let him rise
[54:45] oh Hallelujah
[54:48] let's all stand tonight
[54:49] [Music]
[54:51] oh Hallelujah
