[0:00] exodus chapter 32 going to begin with
[0:02] verse 9.
[0:04] exodus chapter 32 verse 9 read to verse
[0:06] 14.
[0:11] and the lord said unto moses i have seen
[0:13] this people
[0:15] and behold it is a stiff-necked people
[0:18] now therefore let me alone that my wrath
[0:20] may wax hot against them
[0:22] and that i may consume them and i will
[0:24] make of thee a great nation
[0:26] moses besought the lord his god and said
[0:28] lord why do thy
[0:30] wrath wax hot against thy people which
[0:32] thou has brought forth out of the land
[0:34] of egypt with great power
[0:36] and with the mighty hand wherefore
[0:38] should the egyptians speak and say
[0:40] for mischief did he bring them out to
[0:42] slay them in the mountains and to
[0:43] consume them
[0:45] from the face of the earth turn from thy
[0:47] fierce wrath and repent of this evil
[0:49] against thy
[0:50] people remember abraham isaac and israel
[0:53] thy servants to whom thou swearest by
[0:55] thine own self and set us unto them i
[0:57] will multiply your seed as the stars of
[0:59] heaven
[1:00] and all this land that i've spoken of
[1:02] will i give unto your seed
[1:03] and they shall inherit it forever and
[1:06] the lord repented of the evil which he
[1:08] thought to do
[1:09] unto his people we could let's pray
[1:12] together
[1:13] our heavenly father we are grateful for
[1:16] another gathering
[1:17] as we've gathered his family and lifted
[1:20] up praises and opened up our hearts
[1:23] you've followed the faithfulness of the
[1:24] people and even the atmosphere that has
[1:26] been created
[1:27] and you've come into our midst and i
[1:29] believe you desire to speak to us
[1:31] now lord take the bread of life and
[1:33] impart to us wisdom and instruction that
[1:35] we know
[1:35] can only come from above we're so
[1:38] appreciative of those who labor
[1:40] and do many different things to to see
[1:43] that this service can function to see
[1:45] that things are set up and even in the
[1:47] worship and the music lord so many that
[1:50] played their part and do their part we
[1:52] pray that you'd bless them and encourage
[1:53] them and strengthen them
[1:55] lord for those who are unable to be here
[1:57] tonight but desire to be here may you
[1:58] touch them
[2:00] heal those that are sick in body heal
[2:01] those who
[2:03] are crying unto you for a touch lord
[2:05] maybe even for years desiring a
[2:06] deliverance
[2:07] would you grant it lord for those who
[2:09] have other circumstances we ask that you
[2:11] comfort strengthen and encourage
[2:13] commit all things to you now lord asking
[2:15] that you come rightly divide the word of
[2:17] truth to our hearts as only you can
[2:18] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:20] amen you can be seated
[2:25] continue on the subject of what does
[2:27] wisdom look like
[2:29] now we've had five parts on this
[2:31] particular question
[2:32] of what does wisdom look like and
[2:35] tonight
[2:36] we're going to use the word uh
[2:38] consistent
[2:39] wisdom if you're looking for wisdom it's
[2:41] going to be consistent what does wisdom
[2:43] look like it's consistent
[2:45] and i i want to go back and touch on
[2:48] some scriptures that i know will be very
[2:49] familiar to us as we've used them over
[2:51] the last few weeks
[2:53] but do this to build a foundation for
[2:55] this thought of consistent or
[2:56] consistency
[2:58] and we've been looking at the different
[2:59] characteristics of wisdom even in asking
[3:01] the question what does it look like
[3:04] in order to give ourselves some specific
[3:06] guidance to judge our actions and to
[3:08] judge our thoughts
[3:09] and so the context is i need wisdom in
[3:12] my daily life and
[3:13] i need wisdom to approach certain
[3:15] situations to raise my children to
[3:17] to tackle certain responsibilities we we
[3:20] should desire wisdom in those things
[3:22] and we saw that how when solomon asked
[3:24] for wisdom it was something that
[3:26] pleased god so this is something that we
[3:28] should desire and something we should
[3:30] ask for so
[3:31] when we're using these characteristics
[3:33] of wisdom and identifying these certain
[3:35] characteristics
[3:36] uh to kind of give us a measuring stick
[3:38] of whether or not we have wisdom whether
[3:40] or not we're thinking the right way
[3:41] making the right kind of judgments
[3:43] it's to help us when we're asking the
[3:45] specific question in certain situations
[3:47] of
[3:47] what should i do i have a decision to
[3:50] make what should i do i have two
[3:51] different job offers what should i do
[3:53] i'm trying to deal with a particular
[3:54] situation within my family what should i
[3:56] do
[3:57] or how should i respond to this request
[3:59] or what should i say and
[4:01] what should my actions be and when we
[4:03] ask those questions we're desiring
[4:05] not just kind of a general wisdom so
[4:07] that people would think that we're smart
[4:09] but we're asking god for wisdom for the
[4:11] moment for the decision that we're
[4:13] facing the circumstance that we're in
[4:15] and what we're touching on may not be um
[4:18] specific so it's such as to say that
[4:21] well when you find yourself
[4:22] in this particular situation this is
[4:24] what you're supposed to do
[4:26] and kind of giving you a cheat sheet on
[4:27] wednesday nights how to how to make the
[4:29] right kind of decisions
[4:31] uh monday to friday but it's just giving
[4:33] you general principles
[4:34] so that you can think about my thought
[4:36] process my decisions even look back in
[4:38] your life and say
[4:39] i remember when i did that now that i
[4:40] look on it i see what it produced and
[4:42] the things that came out of it
[4:44] and giving you some general principles
[4:46] about wisdom
[4:47] that we can begin to guide um our
[4:49] answers to those questions how should i
[4:51] respond what should i say what should i
[4:53] do
[4:54] and we've been looking at how the bible
[4:56] refers to the meekness of wisdom
[4:58] and really just identifying how the
[5:00] meekness of wisdom can be known
[5:02] by its fruits the attributes of wisdom
[5:04] express
[5:05] are expressed a particular way the the
[5:07] manifestation of wisdom has a particular
[5:10] expression and that's what we can do in
[5:12] our own lives to say well well wisdom
[5:14] will produce
[5:15] certain fruits so i want to look for
[5:16] those fruits in my decision-making even
[5:19] in the things i'm thinking about how
[5:20] does it make me feel what is what kind
[5:22] of emotions are being stirred up within
[5:24] me
[5:24] as i ponder certain things and in james
[5:27] chapter 3 verse 13 it says who is a wise
[5:30] and man and in dude with knowledge among
[5:32] you let him
[5:34] show so this is expression this is
[5:36] manifestation these are characteristics
[5:38] that are being uh expressed to us and we
[5:41] can judge whether or not a man is wise
[5:43] and endued with knowledge
[5:44] as he shows out of a good conversation
[5:47] his works out of a life lived decisions
[5:50] and fruits works that he has a good
[5:51] conversation his works
[5:53] with the meekness of wisdom so it has a
[5:56] particular characterization it's meek
[5:59] and we saw in verse 17 but the wisdom
[6:01] that is from above is first pure
[6:03] then peaceable gentle and easy to be
[6:06] entreated
[6:07] full of mercy and good fruits it's
[6:09] fruitful in all these things
[6:10] without partiality and without hypocrisy
[6:13] and the fruit of righteousness is sown
[6:15] in peace
[6:16] of them that make peace so when james is
[6:19] teaching us
[6:20] how to identify wisdom and knowledge
[6:23] he's saying look for the fruits
[6:25] we mentioned last time in terms of uh
[6:27] confident
[6:28] that when you're abiding in the vine the
[6:30] branch bears fruit
[6:31] so even the the evidence of the energy
[6:34] is the fruit that's produced the
[6:35] evidence that a branch is in the vine is
[6:37] the fruits that it produces
[6:39] and so these uh characteristics of pure
[6:41] peaceable gentle easy to be entreated
[6:43] full of mercy
[6:44] without partiality without hypocrisy are
[6:47] the fruits of righteousness
[6:49] and these are things that james is
[6:50] saying if you see these things
[6:52] that's something that is a wisdom from
[6:55] above where you see strife and jealousy
[6:57] and envying and contention
[6:59] and competition that's the wisdom that
[7:01] comes from beneath
[7:02] and so we can look for at the fruits of
[7:04] something to judge
[7:06] what the source is is it from below or
[7:08] is it from above
[7:10] in matthew chapter 7 verses 15 to 20
[7:14] it says beware of false prophets so just
[7:16] as james says
[7:18] who's the wise men and dude with
[7:19] knowledge among you you could kind of
[7:21] take this to where saying this is would
[7:22] not be a wise man who is this unwise
[7:25] person
[7:26] beware of false prophets which come to
[7:27] you in sheep's clothing
[7:29] so this is outwardly they would appear
[7:31] innocent
[7:32] outwardly they would appear harmful but
[7:35] inwardly
[7:36] they are ravening wolves so outwardly it
[7:39] could look one way but inwardly the
[7:40] source the the things that are driving
[7:42] them the things that motivate them
[7:44] inwardly they are raving in wolves so
[7:46] then he tells us this
[7:47] and you think this seems to be maybe
[7:49] somewhat of a contradiction if i'm
[7:51] looking for fruits
[7:52] i see sheep's clothing and yet something
[7:54] is hidden behind it but he's saying that
[7:56] what's on the inside is going to come
[7:58] out
[7:59] so don't just look at the exterior don't
[8:01] look at um the efforts of politics and
[8:04] pretense to fool you
[8:05] be discerning about how this sheep is
[8:08] acting how is it manifesting itself and
[8:10] we should all be like well maya what big
[8:12] teeth you have right
[8:14] and my what what better what big claws
[8:16] that you have grandma why we should be
[8:18] able to discern by more than just the
[8:20] sheep's clothing
[8:21] that something else is going on and
[8:22] something else has taken place
[8:25] and so it says in verse 16 ye shall know
[8:27] them
[8:28] by their fruits who these ones that
[8:31] outwardly could appear
[8:32] kind and gentle and sweet and sincere
[8:35] but inside
[8:36] they desire to take advantage of you and
[8:39] to manipulate you or to destroy you you
[8:41] shall know them by their fruits
[8:43] do men gather grapes of thorns or figs
[8:45] of thistles
[8:47] do they no you don't you don't get the
[8:50] grapes from thorns or the figs from
[8:51] thistles it's saying that there's a
[8:53] particular
[8:54] characterization of these thorns and
[8:55] thistles and they're not fruit bearing
[8:58] fruit they don't bear the fruits that
[8:59] are pleasing to you every so
[9:01] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[9:04] good fruit
[9:04] but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil
[9:07] fruit he's expounding upon how that you
[9:08] can judge a tree
[9:10] or a person by their fruits judge a
[9:12] ravening wolf by his fruits
[9:15] you can judge even a sheep by its fruits
[9:17] you shall know them by their fruits
[9:19] because a good tree is going to bring
[9:20] forth good fruit a corrupt tree is going
[9:22] to bring forth evil fruit verse 18 a
[9:24] good tree cannot bring forth evil
[9:26] fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring
[9:28] forth good fruit
[9:30] every tree that bringeth not forth good
[9:32] fruit is hewn down
[9:33] and cast into the fire wherefore by
[9:36] their fruits
[9:37] ye shall know them this is instructive
[9:40] that you can judge something by its
[9:41] fruits
[9:42] it's the same thing that james is
[9:44] teaching us when he's telling us that
[9:45] wow who who has wisdom well look at what
[9:48] it produces look at the fruits of it
[9:50] and if it produces these particular
[9:51] fruits then you know that has to be
[9:53] wisdom from above
[9:55] but if it produces fruit contrary to
[9:57] that or prickly or
[9:59] a carnal or a devil issue say well that
[10:02] can't be the wisdom of god this can't be
[10:04] christ
[10:05] the life of christ and the wisdom of
[10:07] christ being expressed so you shall know
[10:09] them
[10:09] by their fruits in james chapter three
[10:12] let's just drop back a few verses and
[10:14] look at verse nine
[10:16] it says therewith bless we god they're
[10:18] with the therewith is the tongue
[10:20] so he's talking about our mouths and
[10:21] what we say and how the tongue is an
[10:23] unruly member and he says we can
[10:25] i use the tongue in a particular way and
[10:27] we can use the
[10:28] tongue to bless god even the father and
[10:31] use the
[10:32] same tongue and therewith curse we men
[10:35] which are made after the similitude of
[10:37] god so he said on one hand
[10:38] we can use the tongue to bless god but
[10:41] then use the same mouth
[10:43] to curse men that are made after the
[10:44] likeness of god and james is kind of
[10:46] identifying the hypocrisy of it
[10:49] that your religious confession on one
[10:50] hand but you're tearing down and
[10:52] destroying of a man on another
[10:54] is incongruent with how of one who truly
[10:57] understands the greatness and goodness
[10:58] of god so he says out of the same mouth
[11:01] proceedeth blessing and cursing and he
[11:04] says my brethren these things
[11:06] ought not so to be this challenges us we
[11:09] realize
[11:09] the same mouth we praise god the same
[11:11] mouth that we use to worship god
[11:13] oftentimes things that are not pleasing
[11:14] to god or do not align with the nature
[11:16] and character of christ
[11:17] come out of the same mouth so i love the
[11:19] grace that james has he just says it
[11:21] shouldn't be that way
[11:22] it doesn't condemn us so we go oh
[11:24] according to matthew chapter 7 because i
[11:26] had a cursing
[11:26] then i must be an evil tree and i'm
[11:28] going to be cast into fire james kind of
[11:30] deals with us in grace and says it
[11:31] should not be that way
[11:33] so that we could challenge ourselves if
[11:35] i really have the mind of christ if i
[11:37] really have the holy spirit
[11:38] then i can bridle my tongue to speak the
[11:41] right things
[11:42] and to use it correctly my brethren
[11:44] these things ought not so
[11:46] to be verse 11. does the fountain sin
[11:48] forth at the same time
[11:49] same place sweet water and bitter no can
[11:52] the fig tree my brethren bear olive
[11:54] berries
[11:55] no either a vine figs no so can no
[11:58] fountain both yield salt water and fresh
[12:02] it's impossible cannot get them out of
[12:04] the same fountain
[12:05] and this is the foundation for him
[12:07] asking the question
[12:08] who is a wise man and endued with
[12:10] knowledge among you
[12:12] if there's a wise man and dude with
[12:13] knowledge among you then look at the
[12:15] fruits that it bears if it's always
[12:16] caustic and critical and condemning
[12:19] and those things the same just be just
[12:21] be white be honest be discerning be
[12:23] be those who can judge by fruits and say
[12:25] well i don't know if this is really
[12:27] christ that's expressing itself be
[12:29] willing to judge ourselves and say
[12:31] what spirit is motivating me what's
[12:33] what's the source behind
[12:34] these things i'm thinking i'm saying i'm
[12:36] doing because
[12:37] he's using this as the foundation to
[12:40] this question
[12:41] of who is the wise man and dude with
[12:43] knowledge among you let him show out of
[12:45] a good conversation his works
[12:47] this would be the olives of an olive
[12:49] vine these would be the
[12:50] the figs of an olive tree these would or
[12:52] the olives
[12:53] of an olive tree the figs of a fig tree
[12:55] these he's telling us these are the
[12:56] fruits that you want to expect
[12:58] if this is the life that's behind it so
[12:59] if you have a wise man you'd want to see
[13:01] the fruits of wisdom
[13:02] someone is dude dude with knowledge you
[13:04] want to see his works with the meekness
[13:06] of wisdom
[13:07] and so that's why when we're looking at
[13:09] this what does wisdom look like
[13:11] we're using this very context of james
[13:13] chapter 3
[13:14] how he's saying identify it by its
[13:16] fruits
[13:18] look at the decisions that are being
[13:19] made look at the thought process behind
[13:21] it look at
[13:21] your immediate motivation and what
[13:23] feelings have motivated that and the
[13:25] principles that you're trying to lay
[13:26] down in the manner in which you're
[13:27] trying to establish them
[13:28] and you can judge it by saying well this
[13:30] is what wisdom produces
[13:32] this is what wisdom of the flesh or the
[13:34] carnal mind produces
[13:35] and you can you i'm saying i believe
[13:37] that you as hun sons and daughters of
[13:39] god can have the ability to say
[13:41] i think wisdom lies in this this is
[13:44] where the real wisdom is
[13:46] and so we were at the kind of the
[13:48] characteristics we've looked at so far
[13:49] on what does wisdom look like
[13:51] is we kind of took this general
[13:52] principle about the meekness of christ
[13:54] that wisdom is the word in action and
[13:57] the word in action to be effective is it
[13:59] has a humility and a meekness to it
[14:02] and and then there was this
[14:03] characteristic last week of uh
[14:05] wisdom is confident but it's confidently
[14:08] at rest not defensive
[14:09] not always trying to prove itself and
[14:10] putting itself forward but it's
[14:12] confident
[14:13] and that confident was fully assured
[14:14] meaning having strong belief and
[14:16] conviction
[14:17] and and having a firm belief and strong
[14:19] belief it's firmly trusting
[14:21] it's relying upon something and because
[14:24] it's relying upon something that's sure
[14:26] not only is it rest but it's bold and
[14:27] daring and this this is what wisdom is
[14:29] it
[14:30] is confident and a phrase that we ended
[14:32] with we are reading of charles spurgeon
[14:34] and he made this statement if we have
[14:36] full faith in god
[14:38] we shall teach succeeding generations to
[14:41] expect jehovah's hand to be stretched
[14:44] out still that this is how this is how
[14:46] the wisdom from above demonstrates
[14:48] itself it demonstrates it in that
[14:49] quiet confidence that abraham had when
[14:52] he had been promised to have seed after
[14:54] him
[14:55] promised to have seed by through isaac
[14:57] that when he was asked to sacrifice
[14:59] isaac he walked confidently
[15:01] and he used confident speech and he he
[15:03] prepared himself he did everything god
[15:05] asked him to do confident that god would
[15:08] do it and and we expressed in the sense
[15:12] that jehovah sees and jehovah will see
[15:14] to it
[15:15] that he knows the situation he knows the
[15:17] need and not only does he see it but he
[15:19] will see to it he will
[15:20] he will make sure that his word comes to
[15:22] pass and that gives us confidence wisdom
[15:24] from above
[15:25] instills confidence in us that we can
[15:27] trust in it we can rely upon it
[15:29] and spurgeon's comment is if we have
[15:31] this
[15:33] then we can teach others that jehovah's
[15:36] hand will be stretched out still
[15:38] as we know that the wisdom from above is
[15:40] consistent
[15:42] and it speaks to the consistency of
[15:43] christ that if he's done something one
[15:46] way
[15:46] we can expect him to do the same thing
[15:49] in the same situation
[15:51] and so as we look at this characteristic
[15:52] of consent a consistent
[15:55] it means to stand firm to take a
[15:58] standing position
[15:59] and and even comes from the the idea of
[16:02] something uh
[16:03] standing erect and standing up and it's
[16:05] firm and it's in it's in a solid place
[16:08] uh the the root it comes from the word
[16:09] meaning to place a steer
[16:11] consistent sister means to place
[16:14] and so it's it i can see how this is
[16:17] very much akin to confident
[16:19] or confidence but now we're looking at
[16:21] it consistent
[16:22] or consistent and the idea of
[16:25] consistency this is an essential
[16:26] characteristic of jesus christ
[16:29] this is something that's just you know
[16:31] it's completely connected with christ
[16:32] connected with god
[16:34] and it's it's an absolute necessity for
[16:36] our own confidence
[16:38] it's an absolute necessity for there to
[16:40] be consistency there can be some sort of
[16:41] expectation we can
[16:42] we can have some idea what's happening
[16:44] next that gives us confidence
[16:46] and it gives us comfort and so if the if
[16:49] wisdom
[16:50] is the meekness of christ we're looking
[16:51] at how that there's a consistency to
[16:53] christ
[16:54] in hebrews chapter 13 verses 7 to 9
[16:58] and i just want to compliment you i
[17:00] could agree with brother loyal that
[17:01] you know these weeks seem to be
[17:02] difficult i was fellowshipping with them
[17:04] earlier and he said it's been a weird
[17:06] week
[17:06] and i felt like weird weeks are just the
[17:08] you know commonplace anymore
[17:10] if it wasn't a weird week we might say
[17:11] well this is weird
[17:13] it's not a weird week what's happening
[17:15] and so uh we we
[17:16] i appreciate your attentiveness and just
[17:18] the pull and the sense of
[17:20] a desire that i sense in your spirit to
[17:23] hear from god tonight
[17:25] hebrews chapter 13 verses 7 to 9
[17:27] remember them which have the rule over
[17:29] you
[17:29] who have spoken unto you the word of god
[17:32] whose
[17:32] faith follow so we're looking at those
[17:35] that have rule
[17:36] and now it's telling us that we want to
[17:37] remember them we have respect to them
[17:39] and they speak the word to us and then
[17:41] it says whose faith follow
[17:43] and suggesting that we ought to follow
[17:46] their example of faith and then it tells
[17:48] us considering the end of their
[17:50] conversation
[17:51] so if there's those who are speaking the
[17:53] word of god to you then they should be
[17:55] given you and affording you an example
[17:57] of faith
[17:59] as you consider as you inspect as you
[18:02] see
[18:02] manifest to you the end or the fruit of
[18:05] the life they live
[18:07] it's not just somebody with a name tag
[18:09] that says i'm the manager you should
[18:10] listen to me or
[18:11] i'm the boss listen to what i have to
[18:13] say but you kind of look at their
[18:15] their demeanor their characteristic and
[18:17] if they're speaking to you the word of
[18:18] god
[18:19] if you see that their life produces
[18:21] fruit considering the end of their lives
[18:23] the fruit of their lives then that's a
[18:25] faith or an example that we ought to
[18:27] follow
[18:28] and then this is the verse that we all
[18:29] know and we could we could quote from
[18:31] heart
[18:31] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[18:34] today and forever
[18:36] so what what end are we considering what
[18:39] fruit are we looking for those who
[18:41] speak the word of god to us whose faith
[18:43] we ought to follow
[18:44] considering and identifying the fruit of
[18:47] their life
[18:49] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[18:51] and forever
[18:53] is this not what we longed to see in
[18:55] leadership especially let's say from
[18:56] those who preach the gospel and those
[18:58] who are pastors and those who are in
[19:00] positions of authority that when they
[19:02] make a decision or they tell us what
[19:04] they feel that we ought to do or they
[19:06] they handle a difficult situation
[19:08] or maybe even we've made a mistake how
[19:09] do we want to be dealt with we want to
[19:11] feel that what we're being
[19:12] who's dealing with us is christ what we
[19:15] want to see in the decisions that are
[19:17] made and the response to certain things
[19:18] is we're just longing to see
[19:20] christ and i believe that a son or
[19:23] daughter of god
[19:24] knows it when they see it that there's
[19:26] something about the way you can be
[19:28] talked to there's something about the
[19:29] way you can be
[19:30] confronted there's something about the
[19:31] way that you can be treated and say well
[19:33] i don't know what's right or wrong and
[19:34] i'm not sure what the right thing to do
[19:35] is but i don't feel or see christ in the
[19:38] way that i'm being treated
[19:39] and this is the standard that's being
[19:41] lifted up according to hebrews 13
[19:43] is remember these things and consider
[19:45] their lives
[19:46] do you see jesus christ who is the same
[19:49] yesterday
[19:50] the same today and the same forever
[19:54] the way that he's always been is the way
[19:55] that he is now and that's the way that
[19:57] he'll always be such that no one should
[19:58] be able to say well i know that jesus
[20:00] christ was this way
[20:02] but i'm telling you now he's this way
[20:05] that there's something about
[20:06] something consistent and never changing
[20:09] about the character of jesus christ
[20:11] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[20:13] and forever
[20:14] that's consistent and it continues be
[20:17] not carried about with diverse and
[20:18] strange doctrines so this is
[20:20] kind of forms the hub jesus christ the
[20:22] same yesterday today and forever
[20:24] so remember them who are instructing to
[20:25] you the word of god
[20:27] look at their faith examine the end of
[20:29] their lives the fruit of their lives
[20:30] do you see jesus christ the same
[20:32] yesterday today and forever
[20:34] looking for this now and holding to the
[20:36] sameness of christ
[20:38] in this oneness of christ and this never
[20:40] changing attribute of christ it says
[20:42] be not carried about with diverse and
[20:44] strange doctrines
[20:45] this would apply to verse 7 the looking
[20:48] at those who
[20:48] purport to be leading and guiding and
[20:51] controlling and sharing the word of god
[20:52] with us
[20:53] be not carried about with diverse and
[20:55] strained doctrines
[20:56] for it is a good thing that the heart be
[20:59] established with grace
[21:01] and not with meats which have not
[21:03] profited them that have been occupied
[21:05] therein
[21:06] so he's talking about stability be not
[21:08] carried about and tossed to and fro and
[21:10] going this way and going that way being
[21:12] up and down and all excited one minute
[21:14] all depressed the next and all in one
[21:16] minute and hedging on the next minute
[21:18] he's saying we ought not to be carried
[21:20] about with
[21:21] whims and ideas and and feelings and
[21:24] emotions and charisma
[21:25] and all these different things he says
[21:27] for it's a good thing
[21:28] notice this it's a good thing that the
[21:30] heart be established with grace
[21:34] and not with meats so now he's talking
[21:36] about the outside not the heart but the
[21:38] outside he's talking about legalism or
[21:39] the meats which have not profited them
[21:41] that have been occupied therein somewhat
[21:44] something that's internal
[21:46] something that's long-lasting something
[21:47] that's effective versus something that's
[21:49] external and temporal
[21:51] the heart being established in grace
[21:52] versus these external things where
[21:54] you can abstain from meats and you can
[21:55] do these things that are outward do
[21:57] these things that are physical
[21:58] do these things that are legalistic he
[21:59] says it doesn't really yield the prophet
[22:01] so
[22:01] a heart must be established with grace
[22:05] and a heart established with grace it
[22:06] means to make firm to make sure to make
[22:09] stable comes from the greek word basis
[22:12] so speaking of that which one steps on
[22:14] it's important that the heart
[22:16] be established in grace that that be the
[22:19] basis
[22:20] that be what you're stepping on that be
[22:22] your solid ground and if that is your
[22:24] solid ground what is that it's jesus
[22:25] christ
[22:26] the same yesterday today and forever
[22:27] it's the basis for identifying the end
[22:30] of the conversation
[22:31] it's the basis for identifying is it's a
[22:33] strange or diverse doctrine it's going
[22:34] to throw me away and throw me that way
[22:36] and toss me about
[22:37] so he's saying that there the heart must
[22:39] be established made stable made firm
[22:41] in grace the basis upon which we're
[22:44] standing
[22:45] must be grace not law the basis upon
[22:48] which
[22:48] we're governed the basis upon which
[22:50] we're teaching the basis upon which
[22:52] we're learning
[22:52] is not legalism not law but it is grace
[22:56] and it's very it's very easy for
[22:57] something that can be spelled out
[22:59] explicitly in the word of god
[23:01] for it to be snatched by the hands of
[23:02] legalism and applied in a legalistic way
[23:05] and then it doesn't produce the fruits
[23:07] that it ought to why because it's
[23:08] important
[23:09] it's necessary it is a good thing that
[23:11] the heart be established with grace
[23:14] and that's where we want to deal with
[23:16] someone from on the heart level within
[23:17] their heart within their spirit
[23:19] not just externally making everything
[23:20] measure up but within the heart
[23:23] and paul consistently admonished the
[23:25] believer to be consistent
[23:27] because this is a divine attribute a
[23:30] number of scriptures we can use about it
[23:31] being established and being fixed and
[23:33] being firm
[23:34] there's a number of different places
[23:35] where he says and i'll use one example
[23:37] in first corinthians 16 13
[23:39] watch ye stand fast that means to stand
[23:43] firm to persevere to persist to keep one
[23:45] standing
[23:46] to cause or to make to stand to place or
[23:49] to put or to set
[23:51] so we're being this is that same idea of
[23:53] being consistent
[23:55] and being established we're being placed
[23:56] i'm being set this is the basis watchy
[23:59] stand fast in what in the faith and then
[24:02] it says quit you
[24:03] like men be strong in other words be
[24:06] consistent
[24:08] when it says stand fast be consistent
[24:10] know where you stand know how to stand
[24:12] quit you like men that means be
[24:13] understanding and wise don't be like
[24:15] children
[24:16] create you like men be understanding be
[24:18] wise not unstable
[24:20] not inconsistent like children
[24:23] that's the one of the frustrations of of
[24:26] of raising children is it they're
[24:29] they're not always
[24:31] the same way every day i can remember
[24:33] when we
[24:34] with our first child elliot that it was
[24:36] he was a very picky eater
[24:38] and so you'd buy something and he would
[24:40] eat it all up like stock the
[24:41] refrigerator
[24:42] he he liked it he ate all of it this is
[24:44] really going to work so you go to costco
[24:45] and you buy all the family size packs of
[24:47] it
[24:47] and then the next day he doesn't like it
[24:49] anymore
[24:51] because they're just finding things out
[24:53] they're learning they're growing they
[24:54] like it one day they don't like it the
[24:56] next paul is touching on this idea
[24:58] when he says stand fast stand firm keep
[25:00] your standing be set be placed in other
[25:02] words be consistent
[25:04] know where you stand know how you're
[25:05] standing quit you like men don't be
[25:07] unstable don't be inconsistent
[25:11] the the speaking is this is how he's
[25:13] admonishing the believer that there
[25:15] ought to be some steadiness there ought
[25:16] to be some stability there ought to be
[25:18] some consistency in your life
[25:21] he says this in ephesians chapter 6
[25:23] verses 13 to 14
[25:24] and you'll find several other places in
[25:26] the scripture where this
[25:28] stand firm stand firm stand firm is used
[25:31] but now in ephesians chapter 6 verses 13
[25:33] to 14 it says wherefore take unto you
[25:35] the whole armor of god
[25:37] that you may be able to withstand in the
[25:39] evil day
[25:40] and having done all to stand
[25:44] stand therefore there's many that read
[25:47] it that way that say having done
[25:49] all to stand stand therefore as
[25:52] this is the statement having done all to
[25:54] stand then stand therefore
[25:57] that this is what our efforts ought to
[25:58] be producing is this standing it means
[26:00] to place
[26:01] to set to make firm to be fixed to be
[26:04] immovable
[26:05] this is what all this armor is to do is
[26:08] to make you
[26:08] immovable it's to make you steadfast is
[26:11] to make you stand firm
[26:12] is something to where you can defend
[26:14] your position you can
[26:16] all the things that would buffet you to
[26:17] try to throw you off and to push you to
[26:19] the side and carry you about with every
[26:21] wind of doctrine
[26:22] he's saying these are things that ought
[26:24] to make you established and fixed and
[26:26] strengthened and settled
[26:28] to be placed to be set firm to be fixed
[26:30] to be immovable
[26:32] so we want to know where to stand
[26:36] and and then once we identify where we
[26:38] stand we always well this is where it's
[26:39] at this is where we need to be this is
[26:40] what
[26:40] this is what it is and then oh well no
[26:43] maybe we should go over here or
[26:44] no maybe we should go there maybe we
[26:45] should do this maybe we did that that's
[26:46] inconsistent
[26:49] that's that's taking a position that
[26:50] well let's defend this with everything
[26:52] that's in us it's this way and it's got
[26:53] to be this way and this is what's right
[26:55] and this is what's going to work and
[26:56] then as soon as it seems like oh this
[26:58] isn't quite working out
[26:59] let's abandon this position that's run
[27:00] over here and where are you ever going
[27:02] to have confidence when that's what's
[27:03] driving you
[27:05] just think about uh your own personal
[27:08] situations
[27:09] we've come we've come tonight with the
[27:12] the rake
[27:12] and not the pitchfork right so we're not
[27:15] saying
[27:16] boy this is really good for brother
[27:17] chris you know hey sister so-and-so
[27:20] could really use this and we're kind of
[27:21] looking around trying to wonder did she
[27:22] make it
[27:23] is she here i hope she's getting this i
[27:25] hope she's streaming if she's not here
[27:27] let's just take it personal
[27:29] because i may not be specific tonight
[27:31] but i feel that you can think
[27:33] yep that that fits really really well
[27:34] with respect to this and
[27:36] this fits with this particular pattern
[27:38] in my own life or i could really use
[27:40] this right now to
[27:41] to evaluate something that i'm facing
[27:43] and so we need to stand
[27:45] and then knowing where to stand you want
[27:47] to know you're standing on something
[27:48] solid
[27:49] you want to know that this is wisdom
[27:51] from above that this is something i can
[27:52] trust i can have confidence in this
[27:54] and then having this confidence it
[27:56] brings this consistency that this
[27:58] principle works it's timeless it works i
[28:01] can i can trust this
[28:03] brother branham and the message images
[28:05] of christ said the church can never
[28:07] progress
[28:08] until it knows what ground what grounds
[28:11] it's progressing on
[28:13] so if you want to go forward you got to
[28:14] know the path forward you don't want to
[28:16] just be blindly
[28:18] saying well let's just see if this works
[28:20] let's see if that works
[28:22] and he says and i believe that before
[28:23] anybody can ever move
[28:25] or have real confidential faith it's
[28:27] first they have to know
[28:29] where they stand and how to stand
[28:32] after they make their stand
[28:36] so i need to know where to stand make my
[28:39] stand
[28:40] and then know how to stand there's these
[28:42] different principles he's looking at
[28:43] just as
[28:44] paul said you know having done all to
[28:45] stand stand there for i need to know
[28:47] where to stand
[28:48] make my stand and then know how to stand
[28:51] now this is where i stand
[28:52] i know this is where i stand so i'm
[28:54] going to stand now how do i
[28:56] make this consistent how do i make my
[28:58] stand how how can this position
[29:00] be strengthened and how can i benefit
[29:02] from this position and
[29:03] how can i experience the rest that comes
[29:05] with me in my position how can i
[29:06] experience the fruitfulness that comes
[29:08] from being in my position
[29:09] if you want fruit sow the seed water the
[29:12] seed
[29:13] and leave it there don't keep digging it
[29:15] up well i'm wondering if no it's got to
[29:17] stay
[29:18] it's got to be fixed it's got to be
[29:19] established it's got to become rooted
[29:20] it's got to grow up under the right kind
[29:22] of atmosphere
[29:22] and these are the things that's being
[29:24] spoken to they have to know where they
[29:25] stand
[29:26] how to stand if they make their stand
[29:28] brother brahms using in one sense that
[29:30] how can we progress
[29:31] unless we know the path how can we grow
[29:33] unless we find the ground that we can
[29:35] grow in
[29:36] and allow our roots to go down and stand
[29:38] and make our stand he says i believe
[29:40] that is essential for you cannot just
[29:43] headlong plunge into something with
[29:44] faith
[29:45] when you don't know where you're
[29:46] plunging isn't that exactly how we've
[29:48] defined faith though
[29:51] i have no idea but i'm just going to
[29:52] jump in
[29:54] and we've almost made faith like a shot
[29:56] in the dark and that's really not what
[29:58] faith is it's
[29:59] well i'm not so sure it's going to be
[30:01] there but i'm just trusting it will be
[30:02] and i really don't know what's going to
[30:04] happen i just have faith
[30:05] well um that's not really what faith is
[30:08] faith
[30:08] has something faith speaks of something
[30:13] so it's well i don't know i'm just i'm
[30:14] just hopefully this works i'm just kind
[30:16] of
[30:16] trusting that it's gonna work well you
[30:18] have to be very careful how you
[30:19] characterize faith because it's saying
[30:21] you can't just
[30:22] headlong plunge into something with
[30:23] faith if you don't know where you're
[30:25] plunging you've got to know
[30:28] that's what faith tells you i know
[30:31] now you may you may not know the next
[30:33] step you may not know
[30:35] just exactly how things are going to
[30:36] unfold but at least faith has to be
[30:38] be behind that step what is motivating
[30:40] to make this step
[30:41] faith is and you've got to know where
[30:44] faith is wanting you to step
[30:46] and what faith is wanting you to do you
[30:47] have to know where you stand in order to
[30:49] stand therefore
[30:51] he says you've got to know and if our
[30:53] faith is set right and in the right
[30:55] position
[30:55] it gives constant satisfaction remember
[30:58] how we identified that
[30:59] earlier how that when our faith is set
[31:01] right and in the right position then
[31:04] that's what gives us the contentment
[31:05] that's what just
[31:06] doesn't give us the moment flash in a
[31:08] pan boy that felt good but the constant
[31:10] steady consistent satisfaction
[31:13] gives us constant satisfaction that's
[31:15] what we want we want constant
[31:17] satisfaction
[31:18] i don't want just the highs and the lows
[31:20] and the highs and the lows i want
[31:21] something just to be steady
[31:23] a trajectory that's rising i may have my
[31:25] dips here and there but i know
[31:27] that this is trending the right
[31:28] direction it gives a constant
[31:30] satisfaction
[31:32] now to put this in context again i just
[31:36] i
[31:36] feel impressed to remind you that we're
[31:39] looking at this in terms of
[31:40] relationships
[31:41] you know the whole trajectory of how we
[31:43] arrived at this very subject was
[31:45] i felt this impressed that in the
[31:47] beginning god created a family
[31:49] and that the family unit uh even us as
[31:52] hus
[31:52] husbands to wives and that marital
[31:54] relationship and the children that
[31:56] i will bless the union that this is
[31:58] something that god was achieving
[31:59] and that is a picture of god it is a
[32:01] masterpiece
[32:02] and so our the our god-likeness is
[32:05] manifest in relationships and how we
[32:07] love our spouse and how we raise our
[32:09] children and
[32:09] god is achieving that on this family
[32:12] level and then the church itself
[32:14] is a family and there's a way that we
[32:15] ought to function and the way that we're
[32:17] mutually accountable and there's ways
[32:18] that god has made manifest to the
[32:20] relationships we have within the church
[32:22] and so it was it seemed as if we would
[32:25] very quickly
[32:26] enter into maybe teaching on the family
[32:28] where we could just say this is rule
[32:30] number one this is rule number two this
[32:32] is rule number three
[32:33] if you're raising girls this is what you
[32:34] need to do if you're raising boys this
[32:36] is what you need to do and this is
[32:37] church we're gonna lay down church order
[32:39] and maybe it was kind of like this
[32:40] thought was well here we go better get
[32:42] out the rule book because we're about to
[32:44] get it
[32:44] and nothing against that that was even
[32:46] in my own mind i thought well maybe the
[32:48] lord's going to lead me into this area
[32:50] and we may be very very specific but god
[32:52] immediately dealt with my heart with
[32:54] it's complicated
[32:56] that everyone even myself and i begin to
[32:59] think about well there's these rules and
[33:00] these these ways to do things and these
[33:02] are these
[33:02] uh platitudes or these are these
[33:04] responsibilities and these are
[33:06] descriptions
[33:07] and you can get it in your mind and
[33:08] realize very quickly that we all need to
[33:09] be reminded
[33:10] that every single one of us have a
[33:12] different background
[33:14] right i mean that should be the easy
[33:16] amen right i mean even if we had a twin
[33:20] but you know it's been a little bit
[33:21] different for them because i'm on this
[33:22] side of the room they're on that side of
[33:24] the room it's been different
[33:27] and and there's really everyone has a
[33:29] different unique perspective of
[33:31] different things and so
[33:32] one we could be viewing something one
[33:33] way somebody else can be viewing
[33:34] something from another way and we can
[33:36] all have our own filters and we could
[33:37] even be
[33:38] producing a filtered uh uh expression
[33:41] and so we look at things are complicated
[33:43] especially in the day and age that we're
[33:44] living in now
[33:45] where things just aren't neat and tidy
[33:47] and clean cut and we can all just say
[33:49] everybody who takes this side everybody
[33:51] get across the line and stand over here
[33:54] and you start really looking at the
[33:55] situation you go well where in the where
[33:56] is the line
[33:58] this is complicated and so i want to
[34:00] bring it back to this
[34:01] this the context that we're consider
[34:03] consider this principle
[34:05] of consistency when it comes to our
[34:07] relationships
[34:09] consider this principle of consistency
[34:12] when it comes to family
[34:14] and how we wisdom is the principal thing
[34:18] and so well what do i need to raise
[34:19] children we need wisdom
[34:21] what do i need to love my wife we need
[34:23] wisdom
[34:24] and we don't characterize in the way
[34:26] well oh these are some real brutes or
[34:27] boys she's a doozy i really need wisdom
[34:29] but no
[34:29] that there's this there's a sense of i
[34:31] want it to be right i want it to be the
[34:33] right thing and
[34:34] it's complicated and there's my emotions
[34:36] get in the way and she goes through
[34:38] difficult things or my children are
[34:39] acting out
[34:40] and i just don't want to be harsh and in
[34:42] rigid i need wisdom in this situation
[34:44] so many opportunities present themselves
[34:46] should we buy this should we allow our
[34:48] children to do that is this something
[34:49] that's
[34:49] harmful and that we can be bombarded
[34:52] with so many different questions
[34:54] what we need is wisdom and so
[34:57] pondered this as a foundation not for a
[35:00] future sermon but right now ponder this
[35:02] as a foundation
[35:04] for examining whether we are providing
[35:06] model behavior
[35:08] that our as a parent the most
[35:13] uh the most effective well i could just
[35:15] say the thing that
[35:16] is most instructive i got i just want to
[35:19] think about just the right way to say
[35:21] this
[35:22] what our children are going to follow
[35:23] first is the example we set
[35:26] and we've arrived at this a number of
[35:27] times in our own family that something
[35:29] happens and really the explanation is
[35:31] well
[35:31] that's what you do and it's like well um
[35:34] that's what adults do
[35:36] but children children look at says well
[35:38] if dad does it
[35:39] then then then i can do it and they're
[35:42] not doing it to be
[35:43] greedy they're not doing it to be foul
[35:44] they're not doing it to be disobedient
[35:46] but it's just they see a certain
[35:49] activity they see something that's done
[35:50] they see
[35:51] a way that something is handled or
[35:53] addressed or even you go to the
[35:54] refrigerator you open up you eat
[35:55] whatever you want whenever you want the
[35:57] children think
[35:58] hey i'm hungry right
[36:01] and then they go and they grab the milk
[36:02] and they pour a bowl of cereal it's like
[36:04] why are you getting a bowl of cereal
[36:06] what dad did it
[36:07] it's like well he can have a midnight
[36:09] snack if he wants
[36:11] and you have to teach the children just
[36:13] because they're certain when you say
[36:14] well just because we did it
[36:16] you shouldn't do it right that right
[36:17] away that causes conflict
[36:20] because when we have the attitude with
[36:22] our children do as i say not as i do
[36:24] this is going to get really confusing
[36:29] because wisdom has consistency
[36:32] something constant it has a footing or a
[36:35] basis
[36:37] if there's consistency if you're if if
[36:39] you're launching from the same spot
[36:41] then the the a similar power ought to
[36:44] produce a similar result
[36:46] if all the parameters are the same if
[36:47] things are consistent then you can
[36:49] produce consistent uh fruits i was
[36:52] pondering again
[36:53] i just uh i say again it was just
[36:55] something i had
[36:56] studied before and it may be
[36:57] administered on in the past how that
[37:00] if you're going to compare uh
[37:03] the financials of a company they can't
[37:07] be on a cash basis
[37:09] one month or one quarter and an accrual
[37:11] basis on the next
[37:13] and be able to say wow they really did
[37:15] good this quarter
[37:16] you're not even comparing the same thing
[37:18] anymore if they're booking debt as soon
[37:20] as it's incurred or they're booking out
[37:22] profits as soon as it's billed in one
[37:24] month but then the next month
[37:25] they're not then you're going to get
[37:26] completely different outcomes there
[37:28] needs to be a consistent method of
[37:30] accounting from period to period
[37:32] in order for the results to make any
[37:34] sense and so if we're
[37:36] if we're going to achieve the right kind
[37:38] of results and understand what's taking
[37:40] place and
[37:41] be able to measure whether or not we're
[37:43] looking at the fruits of righteousness
[37:45] then there has to be something constant
[37:46] something steady something consistent
[37:48] where we have a basis and we have a
[37:50] footing upon which we're established
[37:53] and this conflict between our command
[37:55] and our conduct
[37:57] creates inconsistency i know i told you
[38:00] to do that and i did something just do
[38:02] as i say not as i do
[38:04] this is something where we need to ask
[38:06] ourselves
[38:07] in what i'm requiring and what i'm
[38:09] commanding
[38:11] is there a sufficient understanding in
[38:13] terms of my conduct so that they know
[38:14] that what's being required of them
[38:16] what's behind it and what we're asking
[38:18] of them and how what i'm doing
[38:20] is different not contradictory not
[38:22] inconsistent but it's different from
[38:24] what
[38:24] we're asking them to do and we realize
[38:26] well it's a lot more than just writing
[38:28] out rules on a piece of paper and making
[38:30] sure they can read them
[38:33] we're just pondering this this this
[38:34] consistency the bible says in ephesians
[38:37] chapter 5 verse 1
[38:38] be therefore followers of god as dear
[38:42] children
[38:43] what is the explicit implication of this
[38:47] that children follow so it says we ought
[38:51] to follow god the same way
[38:54] that we as children follow our parents
[38:57] even paul says be therefore followers of
[38:59] me as i am of god why it's
[39:01] it's in the nature of one to follow
[39:02] their father to follow their mother to
[39:04] do what mom does to do what dad does
[39:06] this is instinctive within children and
[39:08] yes we may take it within our hearts
[39:10] in this situation to realize it says be
[39:12] you followers of god so
[39:14] then god provides the model behavior and
[39:16] so we're to follow god
[39:18] as children follow their parents but
[39:20] let's consider this
[39:21] how we as parents then ought to be
[39:24] modeling the correct kind of behavior
[39:25] for our children
[39:29] and notice how james deals with this
[39:31] issue
[39:32] or is setting this as the foundation
[39:34] when he begins to deal with wisdom in
[39:36] james chapter 3
[39:37] it says in james chapter 1 verses 16 to
[39:39] 17
[39:40] if we're going to be followers of god as
[39:41] children who model the behavior of their
[39:43] parents
[39:44] he says do not err my beloved brethren
[39:46] and this is how we can be sure
[39:48] that we're not making mistakes and how
[39:49] that we're not airing every good
[39:51] every good gift and every perfect gift
[39:54] is from above
[39:56] remember how we evaluate wisdom from
[39:58] above being pure and peaceable and
[39:59] gentle and without hypocrisy and
[40:01] full of good fruits and full of mercy
[40:03] saying every good gift and every perfect
[40:05] gift is from above
[40:06] and cometh down from the father of
[40:08] lights with whom is no variableness
[40:10] neither shadow of turning there's no
[40:13] variation in his light where light can
[40:15] be obstructed and light can wane and
[40:17] light can get greater and light can get
[40:19] weaker
[40:19] he's saying there is no variableness
[40:21] there is no dim
[40:22] switch with god there's he is always at
[40:25] a particular intensity there's this
[40:26] brightness there's this shining forth
[40:28] that there's no shadow of turning with
[40:30] god
[40:31] he's not hot and then cold he's not
[40:33] bright and then dark he's
[40:34] within god and his essential character
[40:37] is there's no variableness there's no
[40:38] changing there's no inconsistency
[40:40] there's no up there's no doubt
[40:41] there's neither shadow of turning god is
[40:44] the same
[40:44] yesterday today and forever and so when
[40:47] we're told be therefore followers of god
[40:49] is dear children
[40:50] in other words he is going to provide a
[40:52] consistency
[40:54] a solidness and a stability that we as
[40:56] children can rely on
[40:59] and what does that produce in children
[41:00] of god confidence and growth and
[41:02] maturity
[41:03] because they're relying upon a god who
[41:04] provides model behavior
[41:06] which will never fail them with the
[41:07] wrong kind of example
[41:10] so god is there's no variableness
[41:12] there's neither shadow of turning
[41:14] be therefore followers of god then
[41:16] malachi chapter 3 verse 6 says for i
[41:18] am the lord i change not
[41:23] even if it appears as if if you looked
[41:25] in the context even if it appears as if
[41:27] i'm not judging like i ought to or or
[41:29] i'm blessing when you don't think that i
[41:31] should or
[41:32] or where there should be a blessing i'm
[41:34] actually bringing judgment he's saying i
[41:35] am the lord i change not
[41:37] in other words divine nature is
[41:39] consistent
[41:41] divine nature is constant there's no
[41:43] variable there's no shadow of turning
[41:45] and he's saying that i am the lord and i
[41:47] change not my word
[41:48] ever remains the same my reasons for
[41:52] doing something my standard never
[41:54] changes
[41:54] that you cannot change the word if i do
[41:57] something
[41:58] what i do does not change my word
[42:01] we cannot let be left to wrestle and try
[42:03] to figure these things out
[42:04] and think that god is undoing his own
[42:06] principles he says i am the lord i
[42:08] change not there's no variableness in me
[42:10] there's no shadow
[42:11] turning any james is saying don't air
[42:13] brother if something is perfect if
[42:15] something is unchanging if something is
[42:16] good that has to come from god
[42:21] that we're to be followers of god we're
[42:22] challenging ourselves as we think about
[42:25] how
[42:25] we we are providing as as husband or
[42:29] as parent as spouse or parent and in our
[42:31] relationships to one another
[42:33] is my behaviors my conduct sufficient to
[42:36] convey the right things
[42:38] to convey even what's in our heart i'm
[42:40] the lord i change not
[42:44] now this brings us to exodus chapter 32.
[42:47] we read this in the beginning as our as
[42:50] our text
[42:51] exodus chapter 32 verses 9 to 14.
[42:55] we're to follow god we're saying that
[42:57] god provides a consistent example
[42:59] no variableness no shadow of turning
[43:02] divine nature is constant it's
[43:03] consistent the word never changes i am
[43:05] the lord i change not
[43:07] and it says and the lord said unto moses
[43:09] i have seen this people and behold it is
[43:11] a stiff-necked people
[43:13] now therefore let me alone get out of my
[43:15] way let me do what i want to do
[43:17] that my wrath may wax hot against them
[43:19] and then i may consume them
[43:21] i'm going to utterly destroy these
[43:23] people and i will make
[43:25] v a great nation i will start all over
[43:27] will bring forth
[43:28] a nation but let me destroy these these
[43:30] millions however it would have been let
[43:32] me
[43:32] however many it would have been let me
[43:34] consume them and destroy them this is
[43:36] this seems to be god's judgment
[43:40] god is saying let me do this he says
[43:43] if you will like let me alone that i may
[43:47] pour out my vengeance upon them and
[43:48] consume them and utterly destroy them
[43:50] and start all over
[43:52] so it appears as if god says i am going
[43:54] to destroy them
[43:56] then in verse 11 and moses besought the
[43:58] lord his god and said lord
[44:00] why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy
[44:02] people
[44:03] which thou hast brought forth out of the
[44:05] land of egypt with great power
[44:06] and with the mighty hand moses is now
[44:10] standing in the gap he's he's pleading
[44:12] on behalf of the people and he's
[44:13] reminding god that
[44:15] god why are you angry to destroy these
[44:17] people when you're the one that's
[44:18] preserved them and you're the one that
[44:20] brought them out of egypt and
[44:21] it's been your mighty hand that's
[44:22] preserved us thus far and then he speaks
[44:24] something that i think is very profound
[44:26] wherefore should the egyptians speak and
[44:28] say for mischief did he bring them out
[44:30] to slay them in the mountains and
[44:31] consume them from the face of the earth
[44:33] in other words if this happens god this
[44:36] is what the objections are going to say
[44:38] why would you do something that would
[44:39] cause the egyptians to say they trusted
[44:42] in their god
[44:43] and he led them into the wilderness just
[44:44] to utterly destroy them and completely
[44:46] wipe them out
[44:47] to slay them in the mountains so he says
[44:50] turn from thy
[44:51] fierce wrath and repent of this evil
[44:53] against thy people
[44:55] all right if you're a prophet maybe you
[44:57] can say that
[44:59] you're right so all of us not being
[45:01] prophets let's be very careful before we
[45:03] write that down and say let's remember
[45:04] that we can tell god to repent
[45:06] of these judgments that you're pouring
[45:08] out in my life but
[45:09] it it's it's
[45:13] him expressing now god could would you
[45:16] turn away would you would you change
[45:18] your actions because
[45:19] repentance is used of god but certainly
[45:21] not the same way it's used of man
[45:25] god does not experience unease or pain
[45:27] with how he feels
[45:29] god does not experience the change of
[45:31] mind as we would experience in terms of
[45:33] repentance
[45:33] but he's saying god would you change
[45:35] your action would you stop what you're
[45:37] wanting to do
[45:38] he says remember abraham isaac and
[45:40] israel thy servants to whom thou swearst
[45:41] by thy own self and set us unto them
[45:43] i will multiply your seed as the stars
[45:45] of heaven and all this land that i've
[45:47] spoken of will i give unto your seed
[45:49] and they shall inherit it forever what
[45:52] moses
[45:52] is raising and what he is bringing up is
[45:55] not politics pretense
[45:57] feeling and emotion and pulling on god's
[46:00] heartstrings
[46:00] he's just simply stating what the word
[46:02] has already said amen
[46:04] it's actually just telling god what he's
[46:05] already done you brought him out by a
[46:07] mighty hand you've preserved him you've
[46:08] brought us here
[46:09] you made the promise and he's just
[46:11] bringing the word back up that is the
[46:13] absolute that is the standard that is
[46:15] the principle
[46:15] and he's not getting all emotional and
[46:17] appealing to god's feelings and god's
[46:19] emotions and saying
[46:20] oh this would be horrible think about
[46:21] everybody they'll be crying think of how
[46:23] smelly it will be
[46:24] and think about this and think about
[46:25] that no he's just bringing god right
[46:27] back to the word and says the lord
[46:28] repented of the evil which he had
[46:30] thought to do unto his people
[46:33] i recognize this as a paradox and i'm
[46:35] not going to
[46:36] labor to unpack this in a way to where
[46:38] we can all go home saying that makes
[46:39] perfect sense i like that that's good
[46:41] and resolve it for you i want to
[46:42] identify that this is a paradox
[46:46] but understand this the perfectly wise
[46:48] god did not change his mind
[46:51] the word was not changed his intent had
[46:53] not changed as a matter of fact moses
[46:55] is just speaking what god's intent was
[46:58] move out of my way so i could destroy
[46:59] these people and moses is saying
[47:01] well i know what your intent is because
[47:03] you said it
[47:04] you brought us here and you didn't just
[47:05] bring us out here to destroy us you made
[47:07] a promise
[47:07] to abraham isaac and jacob that you
[47:09] would bring their seed into a land and
[47:12] that they would multiply and inherit
[47:13] this land forever
[47:14] and so god did not change his mind or
[47:17] his intent or his overall objective
[47:19] but he changed his way
[47:22] notice he changed what he had suggested
[47:24] to moses he was going to do
[47:25] he made a statement that made that gave
[47:27] moses
[47:28] the the understanding that god was going
[47:30] to do this god did not change his mind
[47:33] about his word god did not
[47:34] reverse course and he's like you know
[47:36] what i changed my mind but he
[47:38] changed what he was going to do from the
[47:40] perspective of moses
[47:43] because god is perfectly wise and
[47:45] unchangeable
[47:47] in his nature and his mind and his
[47:49] thoughts and in his counsels
[47:51] so this is what i want you to consider
[47:55] then in order for god to say what he had
[47:57] said
[47:59] and then repent of the evil which he
[48:01] thought to do unto his people
[48:02] there must be a divine wisdom expressed
[48:05] in this
[48:06] change of course
[48:11] right yeah i mean i don't know if you're
[48:13] all saying nope we're there and sorry
[48:15] wrong like you
[48:15] you wish you had that buzzer okay let me
[48:18] try again
[48:19] let me say it another way i'm trying to
[48:21] force you to nod or say amen
[48:23] but if god says i'm going to destroy
[48:25] these people moses stands in the gap and
[48:28] then most and god says
[48:29] okay i won't do it then god has not just
[48:33] been compelled
[48:34] by moses to compromise
[48:38] we'll find moses let's see if it works
[48:41] out buddy
[48:42] and this will all be on you let's see
[48:44] how this well fine you want to do it go
[48:46] ahead then have your way moses ooh mr
[48:48] big shot prophet
[48:50] no there must be some wisdom not god
[48:53] well i guess moses is going to fight me
[48:54] on this i got to give in there must have
[48:56] been some divine wisdom or an expression
[48:59] of a divine attribute
[49:00] in god saying okay i won't do it
[49:04] does that make sense individually just
[49:06] ponder your own selves
[49:07] that this isn't god changing his mind
[49:09] but there must be some wisdom and god's
[49:11] saying
[49:11] this is what i'm going to do and then he
[49:14] says he's not going to do that there
[49:15] must be something divine
[49:18] unchangeable and immutable in god's
[49:20] decision
[49:22] that helps me out even if i'm not quite
[49:26] sure well this seems to be a paradox he
[49:27] said he was going to do one thing and he
[49:28] did another there must
[49:30] be some wisdom in this and this is what
[49:33] i want to
[49:34] the point i want to bring it to as we
[49:37] just bring this to a close tonight
[49:40] that often this is what god did
[49:44] often we try to achieve consistency
[49:47] through rigidness and through harshness
[49:49] and we call it discipline
[49:50] we want to be consistent so we make a
[49:53] rule we got to stick to it this is what
[49:54] we've got to do and we've got to always
[49:55] do it because if we don't always do it
[49:56] this way we're going to cause problems
[49:57] and so we want to have consistency so
[49:59] we're going to achieve consistency
[50:01] through
[50:01] discipline through harshness setting the
[50:03] schedule right the rules being very very
[50:04] rigid
[50:05] in these things because we need to do
[50:07] this we need to do that in order to be
[50:08] successful and we set all these
[50:09] parameters in order to do that
[50:11] and what we do is we achieve consistency
[50:13] for the sake of
[50:15] consistency that's all we've done
[50:19] we've achieved it but our goal was
[50:21] consistency
[50:23] and and the goal of consistency is not
[50:26] consistency we're well we're consistent
[50:30] so what did you produce
[50:31] consistency well why are you consistent
[50:34] because we want to be
[50:35] consistent and it's just kind of like
[50:37] chasing your tail well at least we're
[50:38] doing the same thing every day over and
[50:40] over and over again it's like well where
[50:41] are you going what are you doing
[50:42] are you making a stand we're consistent
[50:44] aren't we we're consistent we do the
[50:46] same thing every day we get about 5
[50:47] o'clock we do this we do this
[50:49] consistent but then we don't want to be
[50:51] consistent just for the sake of
[50:53] consistency
[50:57] we're achieving consistency for the sake
[50:59] of consistency
[51:00] and not consistency because that's the
[51:02] fruit of wisdom
[51:05] in other words wisdom will produce
[51:07] consistency
[51:09] but an undying unflinching fortitude to
[51:12] be consistent can produce consistency
[51:15] and it not be wisdom
[51:18] and the unchanging wise god
[51:21] exhibits grace and meekness
[51:24] in his quote unquote repenting
[51:28] we would say the unchanging god if he
[51:30] says he's going to destroy you
[51:31] then he must in order to be revered as
[51:33] god and respected as god
[51:34] he must destroy you and we would have
[51:37] advised god not as a prophet but as his
[51:39] counselors say
[51:40] lord you said you would consume them off
[51:41] the face of the earth despite moses
[51:43] objection
[51:44] if you're going to be respected as god
[51:45] you ought to destroy the people from the
[51:47] face of the earth
[51:48] because you should be consistent
[51:51] and god is demonstrating a meekness of
[51:53] wisdom he's demonstrating
[51:54] how that the heart must be established
[51:56] with grace
[51:58] that that is how a heart is established
[52:00] with grace not cursing
[52:02] and if you make cursing and punishment
[52:04] and condemnation the basis upon which
[52:06] you want to establish your family and
[52:07] establish discipline and establish your
[52:09] children
[52:09] that is not the meekness of wisdom that
[52:11] will produce a lot of curses
[52:14] not a lot of blessing because the heart
[52:16] must be established
[52:18] in grace
[52:21] god's decision that he would destroy the
[52:23] people from the face of the earth that i
[52:24] may consume them
[52:26] and then him to say that he has repented
[52:29] of the evil which he thought to do in
[52:30] his people
[52:31] this was not something that was
[52:32] inconsistent
[52:35] his decision or what we might call a
[52:37] reversal now the point of this deeply
[52:40] his decision to not consume them could
[52:43] not
[52:43] be the cause of future rebellion
[52:48] i like it you're thinking very very deep
[52:50] i'm getting more raised eyebrows like
[52:53] okay say on
[52:56] we'll give you a few more minutes yet
[53:00] think about it god's decision
[53:03] could not be the seeds of their future
[53:06] rebellion
[53:09] god's saying i'm going to consume you
[53:10] off the face of the earth this is god's
[53:12] decision there must be a wisdom behind
[53:14] it
[53:14] but that in itself would not be the
[53:16] impetus the provoking
[53:17] and the opportunity or the the the power
[53:21] for them to then despise god and turn
[53:23] against god no
[53:24] this is a grace that afforded them the
[53:26] power to get it right
[53:28] this is the grace that gave them an
[53:29] opportunity to do that which was
[53:31] pleasing in his sight
[53:32] so god's decision could not be the cause
[53:35] of a future failure so that way even
[53:38] though he may have
[53:39] changed his course not changed his mind
[53:41] changed his word
[53:43] changed his character he didn't do any
[53:45] of those things but for him to say now i
[53:47] won't do what i said
[53:48] would not be the reason that the
[53:50] children of israel would fail to live by
[53:52] the word
[53:54] i hope that makes sense
[53:57] and so when we look at our own selves
[54:00] and however way that you can apply this
[54:01] but i would say this certainly has
[54:03] a great context for family
[54:07] the goal of instruction and correction
[54:12] is to form the right character this is
[54:14] what the word wants to do
[54:16] not just to get us all to conform to a
[54:19] form
[54:20] but rather to transform our minds to
[54:22] transform our hearts so the goal of
[54:23] instruction and correction in the word
[54:25] and the house of god
[54:26] in ministry however you want to look at
[54:27] it in terms of the spiritual family of
[54:29] god
[54:29] the goal of instruction and correction
[54:31] as parents is to form the right kind of
[54:33] internal
[54:34] mechanisms or character within the heart
[54:36] of the child not
[54:37] external compliance it is a good thing
[54:40] that the heart be established in grace
[54:41] not in meats not in laws and legalism
[54:43] but the heart be established made firm
[54:45] through the consistency and the meekness
[54:47] of wisdom so when we teach when we
[54:49] instruct and when we're learning as a
[54:50] family we're learning as children of god
[54:52] the goal is to form the right kind of
[54:54] internal character
[54:55] not just external compliance
[55:00] in order to do that we must find the
[55:01] heart of god
[55:03] in order to do that we must connect with
[55:05] the same principle the same divine
[55:07] attribute that was inside of god
[55:09] that found a place that when it looked
[55:12] like god ought to consume the people the
[55:14] wisdom of god was not to
[55:19] if it had been divine if it had been the
[55:22] right thing if it had been what would be
[55:24] the attribute of god to consume the
[55:25] people then what would have happened
[55:28] moses could have objected all day long
[55:30] god would have said stand aside
[55:33] we must find the heart of god we must be
[55:36] connected with the thought or the
[55:37] principle or the wisdom
[55:39] behind the word the logos of the word in
[55:42] not just the letter of the law or the
[55:44] rhema of the law
[55:44] that it can be spelled out exactly this
[55:46] way if there's a law that is written if
[55:48] there's a word that is given and we can
[55:50] understand it with our ears
[55:51] we can begin to contemplate it with our
[55:53] minds and we could write it out and we
[55:55] could do it a hundred times on the
[55:56] chalkboard or we could read it and print
[55:58] it out quote it we know the scripture
[55:59] what we want to be connected with is not
[56:02] just the framework of the words and the
[56:04] letters that are there before us
[56:05] to tell us what the rule is but we want
[56:07] to know the thought and the intent of
[56:09] the rule
[56:09] itself because we do not desire just to
[56:12] be technically compliant
[56:14] we want to catch the spirit of the word
[56:16] and be in harmony with the spirit behind
[56:18] it
[56:18] i don't want to just get everything
[56:20] right technically i want to get right
[56:22] spiritually i want to be right in the in
[56:24] the motive behind it the objective
[56:26] behind it i just want to well i'm doing
[56:27] the right things everybody is going in
[56:29] the right way
[56:30] i want to have the life behind it the
[56:32] nature behind it the character behind it
[56:38] and we must find the heart of god to do
[56:39] that
[56:41] because legalism will never accomplish
[56:43] what wisdom does
[56:45] it'll never do i don't care if it looks
[56:47] like it does
[56:48] legalism law will never accomplish what
[56:51] wisdom does
[56:56] i'll say it this way you don't need
[56:58] force if you have wisdom
[57:01] you can say may the force be with you i
[57:03] want wisdom to be with me
[57:06] you don't need force if you have the
[57:08] wisdom of the word
[57:11] you don't need authority if you have the
[57:13] power of faith when i say authoritative
[57:15] the authority that's rooted in a carnal
[57:17] position
[57:19] we achieve our objectives whatever our
[57:21] goals may be whatever we think the right
[57:22] thing to do we achieve it by finding
[57:24] faith and acting in the character of
[57:25] christ
[57:27] we don't do it by privilege we don't do
[57:28] it by opportunity we don't do it by
[57:30] power
[57:31] this speaks to men within their
[57:32] relationships it speaks to fathers to
[57:34] their children it speaks to leaders
[57:35] it speaks to us as parents and spouses
[57:37] if we're in a position of authority
[57:38] or position of control we never
[57:40] accomplish our objectives by privilege
[57:42] or opportunity or advantage we do it by
[57:45] faith in the word of god and in the
[57:46] character of christ
[57:48] if we do it by the letter of the law and
[57:50] the authority that i have and i believe
[57:52] i have and by the privilege and
[57:53] opportunity
[57:54] and the advantage i have over somebody
[57:56] else to achieve a particular result and
[57:57] i have not done it in the character
[57:59] character of christ what i'm producing
[58:01] is a wolf in sheep's clothing
[58:03] i can actually produce one who is
[58:05] compliant externally
[58:07] but has not been molded internally to
[58:10] maintain the facade
[58:16] oswald chambers makes this statement
[58:19] i'm not sure exactly i failed to note
[58:21] this exactly where he says this in
[58:23] my utmost for his highest i believe it's
[58:25] in one of the daily devotions
[58:27] this is going to be heavy-hitting are
[58:28] you ready
[58:30] most of us are not consistent
[58:32] spiritually
[58:35] are you ready because we're more
[58:38] concerned about being consistent
[58:39] externally
[58:44] that's powerful most of us are not
[58:48] consistent spiritually
[58:50] because we're more concerned about being
[58:51] consistent outwardly
[58:54] we're more concerned about the optics
[58:56] how things look and how things are
[58:57] perceived and doing things externally
[58:59] and making sure everything is done right
[59:01] externally and we've never quite
[59:03] actually regarded
[59:04] how we could be consistent internally
[59:06] and really if you're doing that you're
[59:07] gonna run out of gas eventually
[59:10] because you're trying in your flesh to
[59:11] be perfect in your flesh and you're
[59:12] gonna the war of attrition is gonna wear
[59:14] you down
[59:15] eventually gonna run out of willpower
[59:17] and you're going to crash and you're
[59:18] going to be inconsistent why
[59:19] because you're only trying to maintain
[59:21] consistently consistency externally
[59:24] and he says most of us are consistent
[59:26] inconsistent
[59:27] spiritually because we're more concerned
[59:29] about being consistent
[59:30] outwardly or externally
[59:36] and what happens is we apply the word
[59:38] inconsistently
[59:40] oh we actually fail to catch the wisdom
[59:43] of what we're trying to apply
[59:45] like real what's the think about it we
[59:47] know certain things that god says
[59:49] this is what must be done there are
[59:51] certain things in the message that we
[59:52] really can't argue about
[59:55] and when we do argue we're really just
[59:57] wrestling with the implications or the
[59:59] consequences or this just doesn't seem
[1:00:01] fair
[1:00:01] so we're wrestling in terms of justice
[1:00:03] and fairness not with the actual
[1:00:05] explicit prescription of the word and so
[1:00:08] what's missing
[1:00:09] an understanding of the wisdom behind it
[1:00:11] because if god said it had to be a
[1:00:12] certain way there has to be some wisdom
[1:00:14] behind it
[1:00:15] if god said we had to do something there
[1:00:17] has to be some wisdom behind it well why
[1:00:18] would someone need to be baptized in the
[1:00:20] name of the lord jesus christ well
[1:00:22] we know the bible says to do that and if
[1:00:24] we never
[1:00:25] achieve a wisdom or understanding behind
[1:00:27] it if we're wrestling with it we're
[1:00:29] wrestling with the
[1:00:30] understanding of why not the fact that
[1:00:32] it is
[1:00:35] kind of like one of my favorite i think
[1:00:36] it's far side we're not asking how
[1:00:39] we already know how what we want to know
[1:00:41] now is why why now brown cow
[1:00:44] and that was going to be the title of my
[1:00:46] sermon and i shared it with my wife and
[1:00:47] went right over her head and i am not
[1:00:49] going
[1:00:50] to title my sermon why now brown cow
[1:00:53] when people don't even know
[1:00:57] how now brown cow
[1:01:02] most of us are not consistent
[1:01:04] spiritually
[1:01:06] because we're more concerned about being
[1:01:07] consistent externally paul said it
[1:01:10] it's a good thing that the heart be
[1:01:12] established in grace
[1:01:14] not in meats we ought not to be so
[1:01:17] concerned about making sure the external
[1:01:19] technical compliance is made outwardly
[1:01:22] but we ought to know even inwardly
[1:01:25] ourselves
[1:01:26] the things we're applying the things
[1:01:29] that we're doing for ourselves or even
[1:01:30] the standards that we're trying to
[1:01:31] elicit
[1:01:32] and get others to follow whether it be
[1:01:34] in raising children or how that we love
[1:01:35] our spouses
[1:01:36] how we interact with one another and how
[1:01:38] we address certain situations and how we
[1:01:40] overcome difficult
[1:01:41] uh circumstances we want to know the
[1:01:43] wisdom behind what god is asking us to
[1:01:45] do and we ought to know the wisdom
[1:01:47] behind it because if we can kind of
[1:01:48] catch that and be connected with the
[1:01:50] wisdom and the heart of god behind
[1:01:52] it the next time we find ourselves in a
[1:01:54] similar situation
[1:01:55] if we know the wisdom then we may know
[1:01:56] that this time a different approach is
[1:01:58] necessary
[1:02:02] let me give you an example
[1:02:05] we teach children not to lie
[1:02:09] i know few do we teach our children not
[1:02:12] to lie and then teaching them not to lie
[1:02:14] we typically punish lying very severely
[1:02:18] and so we have this standard if you lie
[1:02:20] you're going to be punished
[1:02:21] and so you have a standard and then you
[1:02:23] have a you have a consequence for not
[1:02:25] meeting the standard
[1:02:26] and this is one way that i had been
[1:02:28] instructed and it seemed to really stick
[1:02:30] out to
[1:02:31] sister elizabeth and i when we begin to
[1:02:32] raise children is this idea of that
[1:02:35] you don't want to be a threatening
[1:02:36] repeating parent
[1:02:39] like if you make a threat then you want
[1:02:40] to follow through with it
[1:02:42] and so that's the standard right if you
[1:02:44] make a threat then you better follow
[1:02:46] through with it
[1:02:47] because if you don't you are
[1:02:48] characterized as this weak
[1:02:51] threatening repeating parent and so god
[1:02:54] in exodus 32 became
[1:02:56] the weak threatening repeating parent
[1:03:00] because he didn't do it the first time
[1:03:01] he didn't do it he didn't he didn't
[1:03:02] enforce it he didn't
[1:03:03] follow through with what he was wanting
[1:03:04] to do but follow through for the sake of
[1:03:07] follow through we'll miss the mark
[1:03:11] if all we're wanting to achieve is
[1:03:12] follow through so we say you better do
[1:03:13] this and if you don't you're going to be
[1:03:14] punished
[1:03:15] if we don't if we don't understand the
[1:03:18] motive and objective the reason behind
[1:03:20] why we're requiring of them
[1:03:21] then how can we ever expect them to ever
[1:03:23] achieve the right kind of obedience to
[1:03:25] what we're asking them to do
[1:03:27] you better make your bed when you get up
[1:03:28] in the morning if you don't do it i'm
[1:03:30] going to spank you
[1:03:30] and you wake up in the morning you find
[1:03:32] out the bed's not made i'm like oh i
[1:03:33] guess i better spank you
[1:03:34] all right that's the first thing you're
[1:03:36] going to do every day
[1:03:39] probably forever because after a while
[1:03:42] the kids are like you know what i'm kind
[1:03:43] of used to this by now
[1:03:45] so they're just going to walk into the
[1:03:46] room and go
[1:03:48] what do you want i'm not making my bed
[1:03:50] so spank me
[1:03:52] right i guess i can't be a threatening
[1:03:55] repeating parent
[1:03:58] what does it become follow through for
[1:04:00] the sake of follow through
[1:04:01] and we miss the mark when we ourselves
[1:04:04] don't understand the wisdom of our
[1:04:06] instruction
[1:04:08] or there's actually no wisdom in our
[1:04:10] instruction
[1:04:12] think about that you better do this or
[1:04:14] else
[1:04:15] and the better do this has no wisdom
[1:04:17] behind it
[1:04:19] has no goal you've merely created an
[1:04:22] opportunity
[1:04:23] to spank somebody to discipline somebody
[1:04:26] to chastise somebody
[1:04:28] you've created an opportunity for your
[1:04:29] child to fail and then teach them that
[1:04:31] when they fail
[1:04:32] you come down hard
[1:04:37] well let's just think about that for a
[1:04:38] moment we're all children now this is no
[1:04:40] we're not talking
[1:04:41] we're not you know we're all just
[1:04:42] children our parents won't hear this
[1:04:46] right that's not very nice is it
[1:04:50] do we feel good when that happens i
[1:04:52] admired it even preston last i think it
[1:04:54] was last night
[1:04:55] there was something a comment that i
[1:04:56] made and i made some kind of assessment
[1:04:58] about the children's recent behavior
[1:05:00] and preston started talking about it and
[1:05:02] expressing things got very very
[1:05:04] talkative and
[1:05:04] we're trying to work through with what
[1:05:05] he's expressing and finally says dad it
[1:05:07] really doesn't make us feel good when
[1:05:09] you say that
[1:05:10] and i was like now that is profound
[1:05:14] as we work through it in the end he was
[1:05:16] just trying to say dad when you say that
[1:05:17] and i realize you know what
[1:05:18] exactly that's exactly right what i said
[1:05:20] would never make a child feel good
[1:05:22] a child i can hear that and go dad
[1:05:26] i just can't wait to obey you i just
[1:05:27] can't wait to do things right i'm just
[1:05:30] man you've really empowered me i can't
[1:05:31] wait till tomorrow morning and make my
[1:05:34] bed
[1:05:36] all right you because you've destroyed
[1:05:37] their will you you've compromised them
[1:05:39] you actually
[1:05:40] set them up for failure and you're
[1:05:42] surprised when they fail
[1:05:43] your master is setting up parents pat
[1:05:46] yourself on the back
[1:05:47] you are incredible and doing the bumps
[1:05:50] that spike on your kids
[1:05:56] our consistency then
[1:05:59] our our instruction our correction our
[1:06:01] consistency i might even say
[1:06:03] our consistency must be based in truth
[1:06:06] there must be wisdom behind it
[1:06:09] it must be connected with the principle
[1:06:12] of true wisdom
[1:06:13] otherwise that is exactly what we're
[1:06:15] setting up as a situation
[1:06:17] for conflict and aggression and
[1:06:18] disappointment and frustration
[1:06:20] i asked you to do this and you didn't do
[1:06:22] it and this is the consequence for it
[1:06:24] when sometimes we need to revisit what
[1:06:25] was the wisdom
[1:06:27] and ask in it listen our standard is not
[1:06:30] to ever be a threatening repeating
[1:06:32] parent
[1:06:32] our our our our standard is
[1:06:36] when i give an instruction may there be
[1:06:37] wisdom behind it
[1:06:40] so that when i require correction for
[1:06:42] not obeying it we're enforcing
[1:06:44] some principle behind it does it make
[1:06:47] sense
[1:06:50] as we teach our children not to lie this
[1:06:52] is a quote from
[1:06:53] a study said in studies scholars find
[1:06:55] that kids who live in threat of
[1:06:57] consistent punishment
[1:06:59] don't lie less instead they become
[1:07:02] better liars
[1:07:05] now think about this if you're always
[1:07:07] threatening your kids that if they lie
[1:07:08] they get punished and you follow through
[1:07:10] you do not achieve honesty you achieve
[1:07:13] better lying
[1:07:14] because you've upped the ante the risk
[1:07:16] is real high now that if i don't tell
[1:07:18] the truth it's going to hurt
[1:07:20] when i've lied so in order to avoid the
[1:07:23] consequence you've got to be better at
[1:07:24] lying
[1:07:25] not more in more coaxed and encouraged
[1:07:28] and to tell the truth come on somebody
[1:07:30] that people should be running the aisles
[1:07:32] right now speaking in tongues whatever
[1:07:34] it is doing the whirly
[1:07:36] i mean this is something that excite us
[1:07:38] i'm not actually asking anybody to do
[1:07:40] that i'm just saying
[1:07:41] this is something there should be wow
[1:07:43] amen praise god yes i believe that
[1:07:46] that's true
[1:07:46] i've been missing that
[1:07:51] so the type of parents who are lied to
[1:07:53] the least had rules
[1:07:55] and enforced them consistently but they
[1:07:57] found a way to be flexible
[1:07:59] that allowed the rule setting process to
[1:08:01] still be respected
[1:08:05] now this is just what they found in
[1:08:07] observing parents this is what they
[1:08:09] found in observing the way that parents
[1:08:11] were raising their children
[1:08:12] i'd love to get into this more and maybe
[1:08:14] expound upon i actually
[1:08:15] pulled some things out thinking that if
[1:08:17] the lord would lead us maybe we'd get
[1:08:18] into more specifics about this next
[1:08:20] wednesday
[1:08:21] but they found that rigid unbending
[1:08:23] parents
[1:08:25] who who were always in their
[1:08:27] psychological way trying to impose
[1:08:28] discipline and force their kids to do
[1:08:30] things
[1:08:30] they actually had teen teenagers who
[1:08:32] were obedient
[1:08:35] they achieved obedience but they found
[1:08:36] the kids were depressed
[1:08:39] they weren't happy i tell you what if
[1:08:42] there's anything i want my children to
[1:08:43] be
[1:08:44] i want them to be free in their spirits
[1:08:46] and i want them to be happy
[1:08:48] and i don't want everyone to say oh my
[1:08:50] brother aaron and sister elizabeth
[1:08:51] really got their kids in line
[1:08:53] so everybody looks at it on the outside
[1:08:55] and it's like look at them they look
[1:08:56] good
[1:08:57] they do exactly what they're told and my
[1:08:59] children and themselves and their hearts
[1:09:01] and in their spirits don't feel safe
[1:09:04] and aren't happy
[1:09:08] if you want to stabilize your family
[1:09:10] relationships if you want to stabilize
[1:09:12] your family
[1:09:13] tap into the consistency of wisdom
[1:09:18] when we say wisdom is consistent it
[1:09:20] means there's stable footing
[1:09:23] it means there's a solid foundation
[1:09:26] that is the basis for my action that is
[1:09:28] the basis for my thought
[1:09:30] that is the basis for my instruction
[1:09:32] therefore it's what i'm enforcing in my
[1:09:34] correction
[1:09:36] is there an amen
[1:09:40] invite the musicians to come but
[1:09:41] although if you want to play the
[1:09:43] acoustic guitar he'd welcome you to do
[1:09:44] that
[1:09:45] with a mic if you come i want to read
[1:09:47] one last statement to you
[1:09:51] in the message looking at the unseen
[1:09:55] when a man once catches that vision of
[1:09:58] the invisible god
[1:10:00] now i want to use this i want to
[1:10:02] emphasize this the vision of the
[1:10:04] invisible god
[1:10:05] this is an understanding a perception of
[1:10:08] tapping into connecting with
[1:10:10] the unchangeable god that when you could
[1:10:13] ever get
[1:10:13] a revelation of god and know that he's
[1:10:16] always present so there's something
[1:10:18] about
[1:10:18] tapping in and connecting to the present
[1:10:20] god recognizing his presence recognizing
[1:10:22] his character being
[1:10:23] connected to his eternal wisdom and
[1:10:25] feeling the heart of god he says there's
[1:10:27] something
[1:10:28] that stabilizes that man's thinking it
[1:10:31] stabilizes his actions
[1:10:34] and in the time of distress and trouble
[1:10:36] it'll still make him look
[1:10:38] upward and above the things that are
[1:10:39] happening around him because he's
[1:10:41] looking at the unseen
[1:10:42] yet by promise and
[1:10:45] in this in this vision wherein we we
[1:10:47] look at a circumstance where a man must
[1:10:49] be in a distress and trouble
[1:10:51] but yet he's caught a revelation of the
[1:10:54] invisible god and that he's with him
[1:10:55] then he's looking at the things that are
[1:10:57] invisible and then it allows him in a
[1:11:00] time of distress and trouble to be
[1:11:01] stabilized in his thoughts and in his
[1:11:03] actions
[1:11:04] now i want to take this and apply it to
[1:11:06] life
[1:11:09] that if at a time of distress and
[1:11:10] trouble a revelation of this invisible
[1:11:13] god stabilizes thinking
[1:11:14] and it stabilizes action then it'll do
[1:11:17] the same thing
[1:11:18] every time in any situation when you can
[1:11:20] tap into the heart of god
[1:11:21] and be connected with the truth and the
[1:11:23] principle of god's character
[1:11:24] in and act by faith and do it in the
[1:11:28] character of christ
[1:11:29] it stabilizes your actions and it
[1:11:31] stabilizes your thinking
[1:11:33] and this should be the number one
[1:11:34] principle that governs our lives
[1:11:36] that i want to exercise the wisdom of
[1:11:39] christ
[1:11:39] i want to live a life that exhibits the
[1:11:41] meekness of christ
[1:11:42] i don't want to just be technically and
[1:11:44] compliant and be a wolf in sheep's
[1:11:46] clothing
[1:11:47] and everyone i come in contact with
[1:11:49] feels as if they've been bitten
[1:11:52] and my excuse well those are the marks
[1:11:54] of truth
[1:11:57] i want to have and exhibit the life of
[1:12:00] christ
[1:12:01] [Music]
[1:12:03] where i'm not always apologizing for
[1:12:05] biting you
[1:12:08] and up and down and up and down
[1:12:11] but because i catch the heart of god
[1:12:15] and it's not just the rules that i'm
[1:12:16] trying to apply in rules that aren't
[1:12:18] followed
[1:12:19] i will result in consequences but that i
[1:12:22] understand
[1:12:22] the wisdom behind it god why did you
[1:12:26] ask me to teach raise my boys this way
[1:12:29] god why are you asking me as a man to
[1:12:32] live this way
[1:12:34] god why do you have standards for the
[1:12:36] sisters
[1:12:37] and standards for the women i want to
[1:12:39] understand the reason behind it
[1:12:41] i want to understand the wisdom behind
[1:12:43] it so that when i
[1:12:44] require it of others i'm not just merely
[1:12:46] slapping their hand
[1:12:48] because they didn't obey but that i can
[1:12:50] impart the reasons
[1:12:51] and the wisdom behind it
[1:12:55] in order to make a stand for truth and
[1:12:57] not just
[1:12:59] the external consistency
[1:13:04] i want him to i want to be stabilized in
[1:13:07] my thinking and my action
[1:13:10] especially in the times of trouble and
[1:13:12] distress
[1:13:13] so i need a vision of god i need to tap
[1:13:16] into the heart of god
[1:13:18] let us stand this evening
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:28] i know you desire to pray
[1:13:32] in a moment like this
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:38] you might say wow i was strong
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:43] that was that was heavy
[1:13:47] that was heavy
[1:13:51] it's times like this that i believe we
[1:13:52] can go to god and expect
[1:13:55] expect grace and expect kindness
[1:14:00] expect a a nurturing
[1:14:03] that maybe we did not learn to
[1:14:05] anticipate from our natural parents
[1:14:09] but the word that has been expressed
[1:14:10] tonight if it's corrective
[1:14:12] if it if it seemed cutting remember it's
[1:14:16] the wisdom of god
[1:14:17] that wants to promote happiness and joy
[1:14:19] and liberty
[1:14:20] not shame not not a broken character and
[1:14:24] a broken spirit that can be manipulated
[1:14:26] and abused
[1:14:26] but god would only correct us tonight
[1:14:28] and expose oh i've been operating under
[1:14:30] this wrong kind of influences i've done
[1:14:32] a lot of things that weren't wise and
[1:14:33] i've maybe been more trying to be
[1:14:35] consistent externally instead of finding
[1:14:37] tapping into the real wisdom of god that
[1:14:39] produces the consistency
[1:14:40] there's no shame tonight i'm trying to
[1:14:43] create a scenario where everyone looks
[1:14:44] around the other person
[1:14:45] if there's ever been a word that
[1:14:46] described that family brother aaron
[1:14:48] found it tonight
[1:14:49] inconsistent let's let go of that let's
[1:14:52] not worry about what everybody else
[1:14:53] thinks
[1:14:54] and certainly don't be afraid of what
[1:14:56] god thinks tonight
[1:14:58] and let's find let's find his
[1:14:59] forgiveness as we pray
[1:15:01] let's find his encouragement our
[1:15:03] gracious heavenly father
[1:15:06] i thank you that you could speak plainly
[1:15:07] to us i think that there's a liberty
[1:15:11] that we can even tackle
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:13] some of the myths that we've developed
[1:15:15] in our own theology
[1:15:18] how that the right thing uh it was there
[1:15:22] seemingly in principle
[1:15:25] even with the idea that well i i don't
[1:15:28] want to be the kind of parent that's
[1:15:29] saying you ought to do this and if you
[1:15:31] don't do it this is going to happen and
[1:15:32] all we do is
[1:15:33] threaten and repeat and we never
[1:15:35] actually we start counting down and we
[1:15:37] start the countdown all over again
[1:15:40] lord that principle even in itself
[1:15:46] is not used to teach us
[1:15:49] to use the switch when we get to zero
[1:15:51] [Music]
[1:15:54] but it ought to cause us to question why
[1:15:56] we even have a countdown
[1:15:59] [Music]
[1:16:01] i pray lord that we would be challenged
[1:16:05] in our
[1:16:10] misconceptions our preconceived ideas
[1:16:13] our patterns our habits
[1:16:18] even our methodology that we use to try
[1:16:21] to
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:23] bring bring discipline and promote
[1:16:26] character
[1:16:29] lord i i would say i i'm not speaking a
[1:16:32] thing against the method lord
[1:16:34] but i believe that we ought to challenge
[1:16:36] ourselves whether or not we've tapped
[1:16:37] into the wisdom of it
[1:16:41] and ask ourselves if it's not producing
[1:16:43] what it should
[1:16:45] am i misunderstanding the wisdom behind
[1:16:47] it
[1:16:48] or is there even any wisdom to begin
[1:16:51] within it
[1:16:53] lord i know your word is true and i know
[1:16:55] there's a wisdom behind it
[1:16:57] and i believe that there's safety and
[1:16:58] merely obeying it even if we don't
[1:17:00] understand it
[1:17:03] the lord just as much as you inspire us
[1:17:06] and promise us that the spirit which we
[1:17:08] have received
[1:17:09] will lead us and guide us into all truth
[1:17:11] and that we will give
[1:17:12] receive understanding and that we will
[1:17:15] we will know it and we will understand
[1:17:16] it more
[1:17:17] deeply and more consistently this is how
[1:17:19] we relate to you as children that you
[1:17:21] will reveal yourself
[1:17:22] and will gain a deeper understanding of
[1:17:24] your word as we follow you as dear
[1:17:26] children
[1:17:26] that we then can also in our
[1:17:28] relationships one with another
[1:17:30] not just have a standard that the other
[1:17:32] might meet
[1:17:33] but have a patience and a grace to
[1:17:36] express to them why
[1:17:37] we want this standard why we want to see
[1:17:39] this kind of conduct
[1:17:42] why would my wife take the time to say
[1:17:44] honey i
[1:17:45] need to see this sir i love it when you
[1:17:47] do this
[1:17:50] to have this kind of instinct to say
[1:17:51] lord let me know her heart let me
[1:17:53] understand their heart let me understand
[1:17:55] my children let me understand my spouse
[1:17:57] to know what need it is i'm meeting not
[1:17:59] just be technically and compliant or
[1:18:01] all these robots just acting out
[1:18:06] consistent externally but missing the
[1:18:08] grain and the kernel internally
[1:18:11] i pray that you help us tonight lord i
[1:18:14] know it's plain i know in some ways it's
[1:18:16] very
[1:18:17] very direct and explicit
[1:18:20] but we're just provoking
[1:18:22] [Music]
[1:18:24] desiring lord in our hearts to provoke
[1:18:27] sons and daughters of god to examine
[1:18:28] themselves
[1:18:31] and ask like solomon for wisdom
[1:18:35] bless your people tonight we commit them
[1:18:37] to you
[1:18:38] i thank you for the kind of expectation
[1:18:41] and pull that's been exhibited from the
[1:18:42] heart of these believers lord i can
[1:18:44] testify
[1:18:45] as your servant that it's absolutely
[1:18:48] pleasing to you
[1:18:50] may they sense your your love and grace
[1:18:53] tonight
[1:18:54] may they sense your own patience with
[1:18:56] them as these principles are elicited
[1:18:58] and these things in your word are lifted
[1:18:59] up
[1:19:00] and may we as your children
[1:19:03] not despair be depressed but experience
[1:19:06] liberty and freedom in our spirits
[1:19:09] not misinterpreting what you've been
[1:19:11] doing in our lives and producing
[1:19:13] the complexes that were produced when we
[1:19:15] experienced
[1:19:16] correction and admonishment and
[1:19:18] instruction naturally but now realize
[1:19:20] we're in a total different kind of
[1:19:22] paradigm we're exhibiting we're
[1:19:23] experiencing something totally different
[1:19:25] and that we could challenge our
[1:19:26] complexes and challenge our disposition
[1:19:29] and say no
[1:19:29] i can lift up these hands that have been
[1:19:31] chastised i can lift up praise i can
[1:19:33] lift up my head and believe
[1:19:35] that my god has my best in mind that my
[1:19:38] god is provoked promoting the right kind
[1:19:40] of virtues and the things that he's
[1:19:41] changing in my life
[1:19:44] and not leave here depressed and
[1:19:45] discouraged but lord shoulders back
[1:19:48] and empowered the sons and daughters of
[1:19:50] god to do the right thing
[1:19:52] we receive your wisdom in the name of
[1:19:54] the lord jesus christ
[1:19:56] amen
