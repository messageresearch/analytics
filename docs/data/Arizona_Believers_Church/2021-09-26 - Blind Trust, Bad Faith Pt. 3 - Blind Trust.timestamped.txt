[0:00] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 7
[0:03] and just reading a very very short verse
[0:05] for we walk by faith
[0:07] not
[0:08] by sight
[0:09] for we walk by faith
[0:11] not by sight let's bow our heads in a
[0:13] word of prayer
[0:14] heavenly father lord as we've gathered
[0:16] in your divine presence today as we have
[0:18] sensed it in the worship and just in
[0:20] lifting up of our hands and our voices
[0:23] to you and we felt your presence we ask
[0:25] that you'd come now
[0:26] take the word which we have read and
[0:27] bless it to our hearts may you make it
[0:29] alive to us
[0:31] by revelation we know that's only
[0:33] something you can do
[0:35] so we pray that you would do so
[0:37] and father just fill our hearts and
[0:39] strengthen us and encourage us
[0:41] and lord may if the settings seem to be
[0:44] unfamiliar if there's anyone that might
[0:46] be uncomfortable whether it be through
[0:48] fatigue or weariness lord or cold
[0:51] whatever it might be father may we just
[0:54] cause ourselves to be settled and focus
[0:57] upon you knowing that this is a
[0:59] this is an opportunity to hear your word
[1:01] and be strengthened and be lifted up and
[1:02] encouraged so we commit ourselves to you
[1:04] now father praying that you bless this
[1:06] service bless our time together in the
[1:08] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[1:11] amen god bless you you can be seated
[1:15] we're continuing on the subject of blind
[1:17] trust bad faith
[1:20] and wanting to just go forward in this
[1:22] subject and maybe approach it from a
[1:24] little bit different angle
[1:26] but we're looking at how that our faith
[1:28] as believers and as christians is not
[1:31] blind
[1:32] and there's some ways that we approach
[1:34] faith or ways that we have been taught
[1:36] faith or we've kind of come to
[1:37] understand or no faith to where we
[1:40] really are using faith more as blind
[1:42] trust
[1:43] than we are what faith really is
[1:46] and we are actually in just having blind
[1:49] trust it really results in bad faith and
[1:51] so we're kind of challenging ourselves
[1:53] to recognize that our belief is with
[1:56] understanding
[1:57] that it's not just somebody said
[1:59] something so we believe it we just take
[2:01] it for face value this guy told me this
[2:03] and i just believe it but rather we have
[2:05] a personal relationship with god because
[2:08] he has
[2:09] disclosed himself to us he's made
[2:11] himself known to us and so by revelation
[2:14] we know that we're standing on a solid
[2:16] rock and we have this assurance that his
[2:18] word is true and that it's not just
[2:20] something i'm going by somebody else's
[2:22] testimony or i'm going by what somebody
[2:23] else said but this is something that god
[2:25] has disclosed to me
[2:28] and we even were looking at it from the
[2:29] standpoint that our faith has a basis it
[2:32] has a foundation it has something that
[2:34] supports it and something that lifts it
[2:36] up
[2:36] and our faith we could say faith has no
[2:38] reason
[2:40] and that's in the sense that faith is
[2:42] not rooted in the process of logic and
[2:44] human thinking and through the rigorous
[2:47] scientific method and we have this
[2:48] hypothesis that there's a god that
[2:50] created the heavens and the earth and we
[2:52] have tested this hypothesis and we've
[2:54] been able to duplicate the results many
[2:56] different times and so our theory has
[2:58] become fact that god created the heavens
[3:00] and earth that's not how that is not
[3:02] what when we say faith does not have
[3:04] reason or faith has no reason that's the
[3:06] process we're talking about but when we
[3:09] say that faith has reason it's rooted in
[3:11] the fact that god has disclosed
[3:13] something to you and we have a basis for
[3:16] belief in what we believe and even
[3:18] brother branham makes this statement
[3:19] about
[3:20] simeon that god had created in him a
[3:23] faith to believe the word
[3:25] and so god has created in us of faith to
[3:28] believe his word and that's a creation
[3:29] that's very real to us and i think i
[3:32] think i've got a little bit too much
[3:34] maybe on the monitors now but it sounds
[3:36] good i can hear myself today less in a
[3:38] box uh this time than i was last sunday
[3:40] but maybe you could bring the monitors
[3:42] down just a little bit
[3:43] faith is the confident assurance
[3:47] that god
[3:48] has promised confidence assurance that
[3:50] something god has promised is going to
[3:52] happen so faith is the evidence and
[3:54] faith is the substance it's not that
[3:57] you're trying to work up a faith in what
[3:58] somebody else said it's not that we're
[4:00] trying to work up uh faith in a dream
[4:02] that we had but rather faith is a
[4:04] substance in the evidence of something
[4:06] god has divinely promised to us
[4:08] something that god has said something
[4:09] that the word points to so we have a
[4:11] confident assurance that something god
[4:13] has promised is going to happen
[4:16] and and faith is so real that it just
[4:18] it's i know it's going to happen he made
[4:20] the promise it's going to be there i'm
[4:22] not i'm not doubting it i know it's
[4:24] going to take place and so it's a
[4:26] deliberate confidence and a god whose
[4:28] character's been proven to us we know
[4:31] his nature we know his character it's
[4:32] been proven to us and we so we can have
[4:34] a very deliberate confidence in him
[4:37] and these are just some you're saying
[4:39] well you preached this last time this is
[4:41] just me trying to get started and trying
[4:43] to pull in some things to relay the
[4:44] foundation and this faith that we've
[4:46] received is so precious
[4:48] it is such a precious thing so it must
[4:50] remain pure
[4:52] and if you think about how if we were at
[4:54] one time faithless without belief and
[4:56] didn't know what to believe and was
[4:58] aimless and didn't have direction but we
[5:00] hear the word of god preached and
[5:02] hearing the word
[5:04] it excites the faith in us and so in
[5:06] this faith being instigated where's the
[5:07] faith directed right back to the word
[5:10] that we heard and so we hear the word
[5:12] and it produces a faith we know that's
[5:14] god speaking to us so our faith is
[5:16] projected back to to god and to the word
[5:19] then we've got to keep that pure
[5:21] and we don't want to take the faith that
[5:23] god has given us to believe him to trust
[5:25] him to take him at his word if he says
[5:26] it he meant it we believe it and that
[5:29] kind of pure trust that we have to god
[5:31] we shouldn't take that faith and then
[5:32] direct it to anything else
[5:35] that doesn't mean that we need to be
[5:37] doubt everything else and disbelieve
[5:39] everything else and be suspicious of
[5:40] everything else but just realize that
[5:42] that dynamic of faith that pure faith is
[5:45] to the word so we don't want to take
[5:47] that faith and begin to direct it to
[5:48] anything else and then another sense
[5:51] faith being to the word maybe we can we
[5:53] keep our eyes on the word but there's
[5:55] things we start adding to the picture
[5:57] there's things we start adding to the
[5:59] word and things that become a part of
[6:00] the word so it's really not faith being
[6:02] directed alone to the word what we start
[6:04] to add a lot of other things into it and
[6:06] that's that's not going to make our
[6:08] faith real strong because we're adding
[6:10] things into it that doesn't inspire our
[6:12] faith so that's just a way maybe even to
[6:14] challenge ourselves
[6:16] in terms of whether our faith is really
[6:18] strong and robust and growing and so our
[6:20] faith is to the word we don't want to
[6:22] add to the word we don't want to add
[6:24] things into that picture
[6:26] now let's look at where we where we just
[6:28] read in second corinthians chapter five
[6:29] verse seven we mentioned it last time
[6:32] and i really wanted just to uh amplify
[6:34] this a little bit
[6:36] this morning
[6:38] uh paul is talking he's writing about an
[6:41] eternal tabernacle that is waiting in
[6:43] the heavens he says we have this earthly
[6:45] tabernacle but when this one is
[6:47] dissolved we have an eternal a body a
[6:50] building not made by hands waiting for
[6:52] us already in the heavens so he's he's
[6:55] established this present reality in this
[6:58] tabernacle we're groaning and we get
[6:59] sick and we get weak and we have we have
[7:02] disappointments so we're very we're very
[7:04] much aware of this tabernacle through
[7:06] five senses but he's telling them about
[7:08] another body that they obviously can't
[7:10] see
[7:11] and it'd be something else if we woke up
[7:12] every morning and there was this perfect
[7:14] specimen of a body there
[7:16] at the end of your bed that was like hey
[7:18] one day you're going to have me
[7:19] you know one day when you die you're
[7:21] going to be in this perfect body and so
[7:22] every day we just could kind of look at
[7:24] it man i'm going to fit real nice into
[7:25] that and it's going to be wonderful
[7:27] but that's not the reality we don't see
[7:30] that with our eyes so that's what paul
[7:31] is talking about when he makes this in
[7:33] in my bible and i think in most
[7:35] translations kind of that it's in
[7:36] parentheses and i believe it stands it
[7:39] really stands uh in a lot of different
[7:41] contexts we could make this statement
[7:43] but i want you to recognize the context
[7:45] that apologies in it in so that we don't
[7:47] make the wrong conclusions
[7:49] kind of like we do with uh what we refer
[7:51] to doubting thomas and you could build a
[7:54] lot of
[7:55] uh theology off of this doubting thomas
[7:57] doubting thomas but he arrived at faith
[7:59] eventually
[8:01] and brother adam there's only one place
[8:02] i find where brother branham refers to
[8:04] thomas as being a doubter or doubting
[8:06] thomas he never uses the phrase doubting
[8:08] thomas but i think he says about thomas
[8:09] the old doubter and he's using him as an
[8:12] example where sometimes in that
[8:13] pentecostal ranks they had to they had
[8:15] to have this and they had to have that
[8:17] there had to be signs it had to be these
[8:18] different things happening he says if
[8:19] you want to take the old doubter out
[8:21] that's the way that you want to go
[8:23] that's fine he says but god gave us his
[8:25] word and that's what we go by
[8:27] and and in the dynamics of thomas we
[8:29] wanted to look at it a little bit
[8:30] different to say well we can't take
[8:33] those scriptures to lead us to this
[8:35] conclusion that our faith is blind our
[8:36] faith was is without experience our
[8:38] faith is without some substance or
[8:41] evidence uh and and to so that we engage
[8:44] in kind of this blind trust and we never
[8:45] know what's coming we never really know
[8:47] what we're believing it we're just kind
[8:48] of blindly trusting um a story
[8:51] we don't want to take this scripture and
[8:53] we want to kind of look at it within its
[8:55] context to understand that paul is not
[8:57] advocating for blindness when it comes
[8:59] to faith
[9:00] but he says for we walk by faith
[9:03] not by sight again this does not mean
[9:05] that faith is blind because faith is a
[9:07] greater sense
[9:09] it accounts for a sense it's even called
[9:11] the sixth sense in in that it's going to
[9:13] declare something to us and in declaring
[9:16] some sense to us we can act upon that we
[9:19] can we can go forward so this is not
[9:21] blind trust
[9:23] and i think what one of the things
[9:25] that's kind of stern within my heart is
[9:26] we should never put faith in the place
[9:28] to where uh faith is ignorance
[9:32] or or faith is uh well is i don't want
[9:35] to know or i don't understand i don't i
[9:37] i can't figure this out i don't know
[9:38] that i don't know this and we kind of
[9:40] think that faith is always in this realm
[9:42] of uncertainty but yet despite all the
[9:44] uncertainty i have no idea i have no
[9:46] clue i don't have any understanding i
[9:47] don't have any wisdom but i believe
[9:49] we need to be careful that we don't put
[9:51] faith in the wrong
[9:52] wrong place that we understand faith is
[9:55] strong
[9:56] faith is burly faith has hair on its
[9:58] chest and faith is something that is
[9:59] wise and faith is something that is
[10:01] knowing faith in it
[10:03] self is is inspired by hearing the word
[10:06] so there's knowledge there's revelation
[10:08] there's wisdom that's associated with
[10:10] faith
[10:11] paul says for we walk by faith we're
[10:13] influenced by faith we're guided by
[10:15] faith we are governed by faith in what
[10:17] an unseen god
[10:20] and this is the reality paul's talking
[10:21] about we believe in a god that we have
[10:22] not seen
[10:24] and we trust in him and we and we love
[10:26] him and we've given ourselves to him so
[10:28] we're influenced guided and governed by
[10:30] a god who's unseen he says we walk by
[10:33] faith not by sight
[10:35] now when he says not by sight he's not
[10:37] referring to eyesight or the act of
[10:40] vision to where this is uh he's not
[10:42] saying that we walk by faith but we're
[10:44] blind but he's saying we walk by faith
[10:46] but not by the thing that is seen
[10:49] we walk by faith but not the shape of
[10:51] things so it says by sight it's speaking
[10:53] of shape or appearance so ponder how he
[10:56] phrases that then we walk by faith but
[10:58] not the the shape or appearance of
[11:00] something so he's saying while we're
[11:02] here on earth why we live here on earth
[11:05] faith takes the place of direct of a
[11:08] direct vision of heaven
[11:11] while we're here on earth faith takes
[11:13] the place of a direct vision of a new
[11:15] body
[11:16] while we're here on earth faith takes
[11:17] the direct a place the place of direct
[11:20] vision actually i seen the appearance or
[11:23] the shape of the things that are in
[11:24] glory
[11:25] so in the world to come paul is not
[11:28] saying that in the world to come we're
[11:29] going to be blind
[11:30] and we're not going to have eyesight and
[11:32] we're just going to kind of believe oh
[11:33] isn't heaven wonderful isn't this great
[11:35] but he's saying that while we're here on
[11:37] earth faith takes the place of actual
[11:39] vision but when we in the world to come
[11:41] we will have eyesight
[11:43] we will see the shape and appearance of
[11:45] things we will be fully present with
[11:47] only eternal things around us so then
[11:49] just as that that song really encouraged
[11:51] me this morning brother michael because
[11:53] i've been this very thought was that
[11:55] pondering it's part of my foundation
[11:57] that one day our faith is going to end
[11:58] in sight
[12:00] that we're not always just going to live
[12:02] believing in eternal things and just
[12:04] live believing in the resurrection and
[12:05] live believing in a rapture one day they
[12:07] were going to realize the realization
[12:09] the perfect realization of these things
[12:11] that are very real to us and a
[12:12] tremendous reality and a great joy but
[12:15] one day it's going to be absolutely full
[12:17] and complete and everything around us
[12:19] will be eternal
[12:20] you'll never see a flower fade you'll
[12:23] never see something dim you'll never see
[12:25] death and that's the reality that is
[12:27] awaiting the believer one day we're
[12:29] going to be fully present with only
[12:31] eternal things around us
[12:33] but while we're here he's saying here we
[12:35] have the word of god
[12:37] and here we have this promise we believe
[12:38] in the reality of his promises
[12:41] we believe actually we believe in the
[12:43] existence of invisible things that might
[12:46] put us in a little bit of a niche and
[12:47] there might be people out there say ooh
[12:48] you believe in invisible things too but
[12:50] uh we're not talking about uh you know
[12:52] ghost stories and and
[12:54] some kind of phenomena related to uh you
[12:58] know some kind of science fiction
[12:59] phenomena but we we believe in the
[13:02] existence of invisible things and we're
[13:04] influenced by them
[13:07] we are governed by things that we do not
[13:08] see we are driven by things that we have
[13:10] not seen
[13:12] as of yet so to walk by faith is to live
[13:14] in a confident expectation of things
[13:16] that are to come
[13:18] they even think about how where brother
[13:20] branham left us uh when his ministry was
[13:22] finished and i believe it was complete
[13:23] and i believe he delivered us a perfect
[13:25] word and where he comes to preaching the
[13:27] rapture and he preaches things that are
[13:30] to be
[13:31] what was he doing he said we ought to be
[13:33] notified beforehand of the things that
[13:35] are going to be this so that was this is
[13:37] part of the prophet's ministry of
[13:39] disclosing to us what things are going
[13:41] to be like so that we can have an
[13:43] expectation and we can have this
[13:44] confident expectation of things that are
[13:47] to be or things that are to come
[13:49] and so our faith is a belief
[13:52] in unseen realities that one day are
[13:54] going to be realized
[13:56] and then we we yield ourselves to them
[13:57] we allow these these things to influence
[14:00] us
[14:01] so i i want to
[14:04] in that
[14:05] with that we walk by faith not by sight
[14:07] we're not living now because we see the
[14:09] appearance of heaven with natural
[14:11] eyesight
[14:12] like we see oh there's the there's the
[14:14] exit up ahead and these are the things
[14:16] and that's what we're living by it's a
[14:18] faith in the things that god has
[14:19] promised in things that are unseen and
[14:21] those unthink unseen things are
[14:23] influencing us and i want to make this a
[14:26] point before i go forward we ought to be
[14:29] living in the end time with this desire
[14:32] to see the translation
[14:34] realizing that the word that we've
[14:35] received to the prophet
[14:37] and the word that we believe is focused
[14:39] on and centered around the change of our
[14:41] bodies in a translation and a rapture so
[14:44] we should be putting that in view and
[14:45] decisions that we make and the way that
[14:47] we treat one another and even our desire
[14:49] to come to church and to be where the
[14:51] word of god is preached that it's i'm
[14:53] not just living this life so that i can
[14:56] i can have a really good funeral and
[14:57] people could say things about me or i'm
[14:59] not just living this life i can figure
[15:00] out i can buy a burial plot and my goal
[15:02] is the grave no we in this hour can live
[15:06] under a different kind of expectation
[15:08] that this is the hour in the age of a
[15:09] rapture
[15:13] so there's uh there's a foundation i
[15:15] want to come back to it and say that we
[15:18] again hold this in your mind that we as
[15:19] believers
[15:21] live by faith in things that are not yet
[15:24] seen
[15:25] seen by the touch and the sea and the
[15:27] taste and the feel and the smell those
[15:29] things we have a faith a sense that
[15:30] declaring does something very real
[15:32] though it may not be declared in this in
[15:35] a way that everyone else can witness it
[15:37] and realize it so keep that in mind i
[15:39] want to come back to it
[15:42] now i want to read a statement i'm going
[15:43] to read a statement from balman gilead
[15:46] in 1959 and i referred to it in a couple
[15:48] services the first two services on the
[15:51] subject he says the one thing that we
[15:52] have to move up to now
[15:54] is a supreme faith to what we have had
[15:57] so we have a faith and he's saying we
[15:58] want to move up to a supreme faith a
[16:00] more supreme faith than what we have had
[16:02] and he says you cannot have that faith
[16:05] until you know perfectly what you were
[16:06] doing
[16:07] so we have there's a faith he's saying
[16:09] we're moving up in faith and that's
[16:10] something we have to understand about
[16:12] faith is it can move up it can grow it
[16:13] can increase and so he says that supreme
[16:16] faith that he's talking about he says
[16:17] you cannot have that faith until you
[16:19] know perfectly what you're doing
[16:22] now don't be discouraged think oh well
[16:24] great if it takes a perfect
[16:25] understanding to perfectly know what i'm
[16:27] doing in order to have supreme faith i'm
[16:29] never going to get there no if the
[16:30] promise of supreme faith is imperfectly
[16:32] knowing what you're doing then god is
[16:34] going to let us know perfectly what
[16:35] we're doing
[16:37] so he's you just said this is very uh
[16:40] significant to me it
[16:41] impacted me tremendously you just say
[16:44] well i'm going home i'm going out to and
[16:46] start the car he said that's all an act
[16:48] of faith
[16:50] tomorrow i'll meet you at a certain
[16:52] place that's all an act of faith
[16:55] because you've just done it so much
[16:57] because it's a regular routine with you
[16:59] so what's it based upon
[17:02] you sit down in a car you're going to
[17:03] turn the ignition there's some you've
[17:05] had some understanding that the
[17:07] mechanics of sitting down in the
[17:10] driver's seat
[17:11] and turning the ignition is all for a
[17:13] purpose and accomplished something
[17:16] i need to go somewhere so i'm going to
[17:17] go to a car why do you go to a car
[17:19] because you know that that is a vehicle
[17:21] that can move by some sort of propulsion
[17:22] you may not understand all the mechanics
[17:24] of how an engine works but you know hey
[17:26] you know what people use these things to
[17:28] get from one point to another so there's
[17:29] some understanding there
[17:31] and he brings it to the place to say
[17:32] that we you sit in your car and you
[17:35] start the car and the reason why you
[17:36] expect your car to start is because it
[17:38] started before
[17:40] and so this is all an act of faith but
[17:42] it's been informed to these experiences
[17:44] he says tomorrow i'm going to meet in a
[17:45] certain place it's all just a regular
[17:47] routine
[17:48] this to me is so it's just profound well
[17:50] that's the way things of god are
[17:54] now this is very
[17:55] this is very striking
[17:57] starting your car going to meet somebody
[17:58] this regular routine he says after
[18:00] you've trusted him
[18:03] and watched him do so many things till
[18:05] it becomes just like a regular routine
[18:07] now not common
[18:10] uh not taken for granted but it's in the
[18:12] routine of things it's something to
[18:14] where i've come to expect this i've come
[18:16] to know this and that's the condition i
[18:18] think the church will be in just before
[18:20] the coming of the lord so the rapture
[18:22] will just go right on that way
[18:25] it'll just be a regular routine of
[18:27] following the scriptures and the plans
[18:29] of god
[18:30] there's a way that we make the rapture
[18:32] be in mind the whole earth is just going
[18:33] to split open right these perfect bodies
[18:35] are going to come flowing up from these
[18:36] crevices or
[18:38] it's just going to be so
[18:40] so significant and so global and so
[18:42] worldwide that cnn's going to be running
[18:45] and it's going to be on the front page
[18:46] of every website but really we know it's
[18:48] the secret going away of the church to
[18:51] the bride the rapture is a
[18:53] revelation and so there's so much that
[18:55] we begin to realize about this
[18:57] translation and this rapture and so this
[18:59] statement brother man is putting this
[19:00] kind of i'm not trying to downplay the
[19:02] rapture it's going to be extravagant
[19:03] it's going to be glorious it's going to
[19:04] be amazing going to be supreme going to
[19:06] be epic with six eyes it's gonna be
[19:10] something that's really gonna be awesome
[19:12] however you wanna describe it so i'm not
[19:13] trying to downplay it but notice how
[19:15] we're gonna get there it'll just be a
[19:17] regular routine of following the
[19:18] scriptures and the plans of god
[19:21] now a regular routine he says it's an
[19:23] act of faith a regular routine is an act
[19:25] of faith where i'm routinely doing
[19:27] something with expectation and my
[19:29] expectations are being rewarded just as
[19:32] i get in my car start my car and i go
[19:34] somewhere that's all an act of faith and
[19:36] i'm going to meet somebody someone
[19:37] promises me they're going to meet me
[19:38] somewhere tomorrow i go there with the
[19:40] expectation that they're going to be
[19:42] there because it's happened before this
[19:44] is the regular routine of things taking
[19:46] place so it'll just be a regular routine
[19:48] of following the scriptures and the
[19:50] plans of god notice how this is not this
[19:54] is not blind a blind trust
[19:58] this is uh this is an experience
[20:00] it's a process of promise improve
[20:04] god made a promise he proved it god made
[20:06] a promise he vindicated god made a
[20:07] promise he confirmed it god said he
[20:09] would do it he did it and so we're in
[20:11] this regular routine of following the
[20:13] scriptures and the plans of god and we
[20:15] find ourselves being rewarded and
[20:17] experiencing the promises of god and
[20:19] experiencing the benefits of god and
[20:22] focus on this part this is the part
[20:24] that's really really strong in my heart
[20:26] and as that happens we begin to learn we
[20:28] can take god at his word
[20:30] and my faith gets stronger and stronger
[20:33] and stronger
[20:35] and so if you have just blind trust that
[20:37] can stagnate
[20:39] it gets cold it gets weak it kind of
[20:42] fizzles away bad faith cannot grow
[20:45] because you're trusting something that
[20:47] cannot energize you cannot invigorate
[20:49] you or strengthen you but true faith
[20:51] just as brother says we've got to move
[20:53] up now into a supreme faith true faith
[20:55] grows
[20:57] true faith increases all in this regular
[21:00] routine even if you look at it in the
[21:02] sense of uh
[21:03] somebody who lifts weights or there's
[21:05] some sort of exercise program or walks
[21:07] on a daily basis they people do that and
[21:09] they get in the habit and the routine of
[21:11] it and it's not that it becomes common
[21:13] it becomes a
[21:14] drudgery to them but they're benefiting
[21:16] from it
[21:18] they start doing something on a regular
[21:19] basis hey this works this helps me i
[21:22] benefit from this and they get in the
[21:24] regular routine of it and so in doing
[21:25] that they're receiving positive feedback
[21:28] and strength and endurance and energy
[21:30] that's the way that we ought to be in
[21:32] the scriptures to where there's this
[21:33] routine there's this discipline of
[21:35] trusting god and it causes our endurance
[21:37] our spiritual endurance our supernatural
[21:39] strength and our faith muscles to build
[21:41] and to grow and so we see the direct
[21:44] benefits of being in the regular routine
[21:46] of the scriptures and following god's
[21:48] plans
[21:49] all four he says a rapture
[21:53] in the message perfect faith and this is
[21:55] um
[21:56] it's some very heavy things
[22:00] i find that what he the point he's
[22:02] making here
[22:03] is very remarkable especially in the
[22:05] context of the message perfect faith has
[22:07] anyone listened or read the message
[22:09] perfect faith recently
[22:10] last few months or so last five years
[22:14] this sweet spot five years i'm just
[22:16] going to remember that and
[22:18] how many have listened to it this
[22:19] century
[22:20] and it's uh so this is it so you know if
[22:24] you can recall and i'm very familiar
[22:25] with we're very familiar with this
[22:27] sermon that brotherhood's trying to
[22:28] build faith even he says before a prayer
[22:30] line coming right
[22:31] and he's looking at this as being some
[22:34] something's building something's growing
[22:36] something's increasing he says now faith
[22:38] is the substance and by it we understand
[22:40] all those things are done so certain
[22:42] supernatural things taking place
[22:45] we understand it's by faith it's not an
[22:46] imagination it is a substance especially
[22:50] perfect faith that's what i'm talking on
[22:52] tonight
[22:53] getting to perfect faith it's not an
[22:55] imagination and this is the part to me
[22:57] that's just very uh is very
[23:00] staggering
[23:02] now others have people come say oh i got
[23:04] all faith oh sure i have
[23:06] well what are you standing here for then
[23:10] right you know in a prayer line have
[23:12] hands laid on your very actions prove
[23:14] you haven't got what you're talking
[23:16] about
[23:17] if you had faith then what you what what
[23:20] you stand in the prayer line for
[23:24] oh okay this is
[23:26] he's gonna be calling a prayer line and
[23:28] he's preaching because he wants to build
[23:29] people's faith but in in a sense this is
[23:32] the way and i don't like to maybe share
[23:34] my personal
[23:35] uh my personal opinion my on my regular
[23:37] job every day i get paid to give my
[23:39] opinion and i'm glad i have that outlet
[23:41] because when i do this i don't have to i
[23:43] don't give my opinion i'm not supposed
[23:45] to and i don't like to but to me it's
[23:47] almost as if brother branham is looking
[23:49] at something and he kind of he's wanting
[23:51] to build their faith he's not going to
[23:52] chastise him he's not wanting to uh you
[23:54] know belittle their faith he's want to
[23:56] take that faith and encourage it and if
[23:58] their faith can build and god can meet
[24:00] him on the prayer in a prayer line and
[24:02] something can happen then that ought to
[24:04] strengthen their faith as they leave
[24:06] like wow did you notice that the word
[24:08] built my faith up he met me on the
[24:10] platform and you leave with the stronger
[24:12] faith
[24:13] not not with the wrong kind of uh
[24:15] approach to god and not with this a
[24:17] cyclical attitude where he's always
[24:19] going in circles and it's never
[24:21] never progressive he's wanting to build
[24:23] them up and it's almost as if he kind of
[24:25] really he's letting out just in a moment
[24:27] of what he's really looking at saying
[24:28] look our faith should be increasing and
[24:30] growing and if you really are talking
[24:33] about how strong you are and how big
[24:34] your faith is and oh yeah i've got that
[24:37] kind of perfect faith he's kind of
[24:38] saying if you really had that then you
[24:40] wouldn't even be in the prayer line
[24:42] and he's not saying anything against
[24:43] prayer lines but he's wanting us to
[24:44] recognize something he says so he makes
[24:46] he asks this question if you had faith
[24:48] and why are you standing the prayer line
[24:50] notice what do you do these things for
[24:54] he's asking a question of what's your
[24:56] reason for doing this
[24:58] what's your it in and not so much maybe
[25:00] in the sense of motive and objective but
[25:02] what's your basis what are you basing
[25:04] this on
[25:05] what what are you
[25:06] looking to accomplish and why do we even
[25:08] why does god make a promise and then
[25:10] fulfill it is it just so he could he has
[25:12] like a bucket list and oh brother aaron
[25:14] asked for this okay well i guess we we
[25:16] got rid of that it's not a to-do list
[25:18] with god
[25:20] it's it's a it's a following the
[25:22] scriptures and the plans of god god has
[25:24] an objective god has a goal so when god
[25:26] does something in your life makes a
[25:28] promise and fulfills it he has this
[25:30] long-range vision to where that's
[25:32] fitting into the overall vision and
[25:34] picture of what he's wanting to
[25:36] accomplish in your life so he step back
[25:38] and say he healed me why did he heal me
[25:40] he's got a purpose in doing it brother
[25:42] mary even teaches us that he's got a
[25:43] purpose in healing us he had a purpose
[25:45] in saving you he had a purpose in doing
[25:47] these different things so he says what
[25:48] are you doing these things for see if
[25:51] you had perfect faith you'd look right
[25:53] straight to god and believe it and walk
[25:55] away
[25:57] you would have no need of coming into a
[25:58] prayer line you'd have no need of these
[26:00] things because your faith has done made
[26:02] it so
[26:03] now i i want to i acknowledge that just
[26:05] how striking that is and how it's really
[26:07] confrontational to say whoa okay he's
[26:10] going to be calling a prayer line he's
[26:11] wanting to faith to raise and he's
[26:13] wanting to see it come to a level and
[26:14] people are going to be coming through
[26:15] the prayer line later on in that service
[26:17] but he kind of slips this in to ask
[26:20] ourselves why are you doing this
[26:22] why are these things done
[26:24] and if you say oh i've got that kind of
[26:26] faith oh i sure of god he said then if
[26:28] you had that kind of faith you wouldn't
[26:30] be standing here
[26:32] no i want to make this point it doesn't
[26:34] mean if you had faith you'd never be
[26:36] standing there that doesn't make sense
[26:39] but he's saying that if you had that
[26:41] kind of faith you wouldn't be coming
[26:43] back here
[26:45] you just take god's word and go forward
[26:47] so he says what do you do these things
[26:49] for
[26:50] he's asking if there's an actual
[26:52] understanding or he's challenging our
[26:54] understanding of why we're doing these
[26:56] things
[26:57] why are you doing it
[26:58] what's your reason for doing it he's
[27:00] actually is there an understanding
[27:01] behind uh these actions in in the things
[27:04] that you're doing do you know what
[27:05] you're doing
[27:06] do you know why you're doing it
[27:09] do you even know why you're in a prayer
[27:10] line is it just because everybody else
[27:12] is
[27:13] well it's saturday night it's the
[27:14] special meetings
[27:16] right everybody puts on their prayer
[27:17] line shoes
[27:19] because that's just what happens he's
[27:21] saying hey are you just doing this
[27:22] traditionally are you just going up
[27:24] there because everybody else is do you
[27:25] know why you're doing it do you know
[27:27] upon what basis god's going to meet you
[27:29] there because it can't be hope so
[27:33] now i i'll say this because i i know uh
[27:36] i'm wanting to if we have time i'd like
[27:38] to get to this
[27:39] apportion in the service today
[27:43] but
[27:44] we
[27:45] there's a
[27:46] i want to trying to be very careful in
[27:47] the way i express this not that i don't
[27:49] want to give away what i'm going to be
[27:50] saying later but at this point i want to
[27:52] be very careful why i say it
[27:54] there's times in our lives when we look
[27:55] back in our christian experience
[27:58] and it's almost as if oh
[28:00] if i could just have that again
[28:02] like the glory years and the the glory
[28:04] days and the power of god was moving and
[28:07] i had this experience at the altar and i
[28:09] remember i could go through the prayer
[28:10] line and i could feel his presence and i
[28:12] could be healed and we almost look back
[28:14] like i just wish i could go back there
[28:16] again and have that
[28:18] and you wonder why it doesn't work again
[28:22] and i want you to ponder if maybe
[28:25] in that the way that you're looking at
[28:26] it you've allowed that to weaken your
[28:29] faith
[28:30] instead of strengthen it
[28:33] because instead of looking at all these
[28:35] wonderful things that god has done for
[28:36] you and just looking forward to what he
[28:38] has and said hey that's got me here so
[28:40] this must be good
[28:42] i'm not denying his word i'm not back in
[28:44] sin i'm not back in sickness again but
[28:46] i'm here i am god has done all these
[28:48] wonderful things for me so those things
[28:50] were powerful those things were
[28:51] supernatural and they've got me where i
[28:53] am today and begin to appreciate just
[28:55] how rich and mature your faith is as a
[28:58] result of those glory years and those
[29:01] wonderful days and those great times and
[29:03] say look i am more stable today because
[29:06] i'm not looking to those things and
[29:07] needing those things to trust god and
[29:09] believe them but they are a part of my
[29:11] pedigree my legacy and my history as a
[29:13] believer so they're ever present with me
[29:15] now
[29:17] now paul says for getting those things
[29:18] which are behind behind
[29:20] now we are connected to our past we're
[29:22] connected to our childhood we're the sum
[29:24] of the experiences that we've had in our
[29:26] past so we really can't leave them
[29:27] behind behind
[29:29] as if we could somehow divorce ourselves
[29:31] from them but realize i am where i am
[29:33] today as a result of all these forces
[29:35] and experiences and things that have
[29:37] moved to my life as a christian so i've
[29:39] got to use what's behind me as momentum
[29:41] to look forward impress on
[29:47] so brother branham
[29:48] makes this statement in the message
[29:50] communion
[29:51] and now i'm
[29:53] uh you all are just pulling so well
[29:55] listening so well today that i
[29:57] i realized i might have bitten off more
[30:00] than i could chew which in another
[30:02] parlance would be printed out more than
[30:03] i could preach
[30:05] i think i got more quotations and
[30:07] scriptures here then i'll be able to get
[30:08] to
[30:09] now this is this is his last
[30:12] last words to us and i look at this
[30:14] message as being very very
[30:17] uh special december 12 1965 he says now
[30:19] we're fixing to observe something here
[30:21] that's really sacred talk about
[30:22] communion
[30:23] i was called on a few days and i want
[30:24] you to i'm just
[30:25] using this story that brother branham
[30:27] tells him this to make make a point here
[30:30] i was called a few days ago to some very
[30:32] fine christian gentleman that's never
[30:34] had this and he understood that we've
[30:36] taken communion literally so here's a
[30:37] christian gentleman who's never taken
[30:39] communion he's like you guys are
[30:40] literally taking bread and wine
[30:42] he says they take in what they call
[30:45] spiritual communion
[30:47] now you think well that seems pretty
[30:48] far-fetched there's people that
[30:50] believe the message and believe there's
[30:52] really no literal rapture
[30:54] they just believe in a spiritual
[30:55] resurrection spiritual rapture no
[30:57] literal rapture and they're very
[30:59] very adamant about what we believe to be
[31:02] the prophet to be the messenger to the
[31:04] age and the word of god being true that
[31:06] we've received but they spiritualize
[31:08] everything there's no literal
[31:10] reality to it this is somebody of some
[31:12] group that didn't take literal communion
[31:15] because they took it spiritually
[31:16] and which as far as communion i'd say
[31:18] all right because communicate is to talk
[31:21] see and the brother give me this
[31:22] scripture said brother don't you think
[31:25] now
[31:26] and so he's looking at this
[31:28] this brother's using the scripture to
[31:30] say don't you see that this is as we
[31:32] take the word of god in the spiritual
[31:34] communion that that takes the place of a
[31:36] literal communion
[31:37] see that reason i'm saying this is so
[31:40] that you would understand what you're
[31:41] doing
[31:43] whether i was addressing this in
[31:45] bringing this up
[31:46] and he's taking time to teach on
[31:48] communion so that whenever one comes to
[31:50] take communion they understand what
[31:51] they're doing
[31:52] so we do not have even when it comes to
[31:55] the things of god he doesn't i know we
[31:57] do this sometimes as parents and there's
[31:58] a time to do it but he doesn't just say
[32:00] take communion because i told you so
[32:02] well why because i told you so
[32:05] why do you guys take him in well the
[32:06] bible says it we just do it because the
[32:07] bible says it if the bible says it we
[32:09] should accept that there's got to be
[32:10] some reason behind it that there's a
[32:13] there's a divine purpose a divine motive
[32:15] a designed plan there's a there's a plan
[32:17] of god behind these scriptures that we
[32:19] follow and so he says i i want you i re
[32:22] saying this so that you'd understand
[32:24] what you're doing if you walk into
[32:25] anything blindly
[32:28] you don't know where what you're doing
[32:31] you can't even have you can't even
[32:33] confidence it have confidence even in
[32:36] you can't have even confidence if you
[32:38] don't know what you're doing
[32:40] we need confidence we need some sort of
[32:43] sureness and stability that we need to
[32:44] have faith he says you can't have
[32:46] confidence if you don't know what you're
[32:47] doing but you must understand what
[32:50] you're doing and why you are doing it
[32:52] these are the things that we are taught
[32:54] in the message of the hour we believe we
[32:56] trust in him and having trusted in him
[32:58] he says after you've trusted him you've
[33:00] watched and do so many things to it just
[33:02] becomes like a regular routine by then
[33:04] there's understanding there's you know
[33:06] the character of god you know the nature
[33:07] of god you know what he promised you're
[33:09] working in wisdom and knowledge and
[33:11] revelation in these different things he
[33:13] says you must understand what you're
[33:15] doing and why you're doing it he said
[33:17] now if we take the word of god isn't
[33:19] that god that we're taking this is the
[33:20] young christian gentleman who had
[33:22] spiritual communion if we take the word
[33:24] aren't we aren't we taking god and i say
[33:26] i said exactly right sir it's true but
[33:29] we read here that they actually paul
[33:31] taught taking the literal lord's supper
[33:34] so this is
[33:35] brother branham identifying how that
[33:37] some tradition had stripped away the
[33:40] meaning of the word
[33:42] that some interpretation well we take
[33:44] the scripture and if we take the word of
[33:46] god aren't we taking god and so it's
[33:48] kind of taken away the real
[33:50] understanding of the word paul is
[33:52] teaching a literal communion and here's
[33:54] somebody people taking the same
[33:56] scriptures twisting them around a little
[33:58] bit and stripping away
[34:00] the the real act behind it and brothers
[34:03] saying the reason the problem exists
[34:05] because there's no understanding
[34:08] then we say oh well i just need to be
[34:09] communing with god i can just pray i can
[34:11] just read the word and as i read the
[34:12] word i'm eating the word and there's
[34:14] revelation that's the intoxication from
[34:16] the wine and so there's the bread and
[34:18] the wine and so i have communion anytime
[34:20] i read my bible and pray and any time
[34:22] god speaks to me and discloses things to
[34:24] me brother i'm saying that's all fine
[34:26] he's actually saying that's wonderful
[34:27] that's great but paul is talking about
[34:29] literal communion
[34:31] so there was
[34:32] some it's very unique because i don't
[34:35] know that i've ever myself met anyone
[34:37] who believed this brother branham
[34:39] explains it in enough detail to realize
[34:41] that this was some mythology based on
[34:44] the word
[34:45] it wasn't denying the word outright but
[34:48] he's actually taken the scripture and
[34:49] said i showed him a scripture don't you
[34:50] think that it means this so they were
[34:52] basing it on the word but it's not
[34:54] actually the word
[34:56] the thought behind it the real meaning
[34:58] go ye and all the world baptize them in
[34:59] the name of the father and the son and
[35:00] the holy ghost we say oh let's be very
[35:02] strict that's what it means that's what
[35:04] it said but then you do that and you
[35:06] follow that to the letter and you find
[35:08] that you lack the revelation and the
[35:10] meaning of it to be baptized in the name
[35:12] of jesus christ
[35:14] and so it could be based on the word but
[35:16] be entirely against the word
[35:18] and so in that
[35:20] taking that kind of approach to
[35:21] scripture oh well it says this and it
[35:23] says that and maybe we should do this
[35:25] and
[35:26] and take it this way it had actually
[35:27] taken their trust in the word of god and
[35:30] misdirected it not in what the meaning
[35:32] of the word was and not what the word
[35:34] literally was or really was but into
[35:36] some explanation or false interpretation
[35:39] so they developed this mythology even a
[35:41] religion can be built around those
[35:42] things
[35:44] and whenever they their trust is
[35:46] misdirected that's basically
[35:48] that's trust that is blind and that can
[35:50] only produce bad faith
[35:53] and a faith that's not growing
[35:56] is bad faith
[35:58] he could never be this person could
[36:00] never be walking in the scripture and
[36:01] brother brahman says look if you don't
[36:03] understand what you're doing you can't
[36:05] even you can't walk into anything
[36:07] blindly you have to know what you're
[36:08] doing you must understand what you're
[36:10] doing and why you're doing it if that's
[36:12] the case then our prayers ought to be
[36:13] lord i want to understand
[36:16] what i'm doing i want to understand why
[36:18] i'm doing it
[36:20] and and even if that becomes a routine
[36:22] to you to where you you're desiring that
[36:24] and seeking that it can even cause you
[36:27] as you seek those spiritual things and
[36:28] to have this benefit of knowing what i'm
[36:30] doing and why i'm doing it it'll give
[36:32] you
[36:33] discernment and wisdom to begin to
[36:35] identify natural things that you're
[36:37] doing
[36:38] so you can ask myself what am i doing
[36:41] why am i doing that and realizing wow
[36:44] maybe i shouldn't be doing it
[36:46] once you start having this understanding
[36:48] to realize what you're doing and why
[36:50] you're doing it doesn't fit within the
[36:52] wisdom of the word and the expediency of
[36:55] the work of god in your life and even in
[36:56] the lives of your children and others
[36:58] that you're around it becomes a really
[37:00] strong
[37:01] mechanism of our faith to be able to
[37:03] know what we're doing and why we're
[37:04] doing it
[37:06] in matthew chapter 15 and i want to use
[37:09] this story
[37:11] of this exchange as an ex as it will
[37:14] it's going to come to jesus tells his
[37:15] disciples hey
[37:17] they're they're blind leaders of the
[37:19] blind so we're looking at blind trust
[37:21] and bad faith and really these pharisees
[37:23] and these jewish leaders made arguments
[37:25] in bad faith
[37:26] they're making a bad faith argument here
[37:29] there is a blind trust of the people in
[37:32] these bad faith arguments so there's a
[37:34] lot of ways that what was inspired to me
[37:36] and how i've been studying this
[37:37] personally
[37:39] brings me to this place but i want to i
[37:41] want to read through it and maybe not
[37:42] get uh go piece by piece in too much
[37:45] detail
[37:46] but matthew chapter 15 verses 1 to 14.
[37:53] it says then came to jesus scribes and
[37:56] pharisees
[37:57] which were of jerusalem saying why do
[37:59] thy disciples transgress the tradition
[38:02] of the elders for they wash not their
[38:04] hands and when they eat bread so they
[38:07] are being he's been challenged
[38:09] as to why his disciples
[38:12] transgress notice the tradition of the
[38:14] elders
[38:15] but he answered the sin of them why do
[38:17] ye also transgress the commandment of
[38:19] god by your tradition ooh okay
[38:22] what do we call that these days micah a
[38:23] sick burn is that it
[38:26] do i get an instagram credit for that
[38:28] uh this is something where oh you need
[38:30] some melody for that is what they needed
[38:32] after after jesus comes right back says
[38:34] your disciples transgress the tradition
[38:36] of the elders by not washing their hands
[38:38] when they and he says well why do your
[38:39] traditions transgress the hand of god i
[38:41] say that's checkmate
[38:43] your traditions transgress the
[38:45] commandment of god
[38:47] why does it matter if we transgress your
[38:49] traditions
[38:50] your traditions are contrary to the word
[38:52] he says for god commanded saying honor
[38:54] thy father and mother and he that
[38:56] curseth father and mother let him die
[38:58] the death jesus now points to
[39:00] deuteronomy 5 16. he points to exodus 21
[39:03] 17 jesus has the very words of the
[39:06] prophet and the very words of god to say
[39:09] god commanded honor thy father and
[39:10] mother he also commands curses he that
[39:13] curses his father and mother let him die
[39:16] the death
[39:17] this is what god said he says but ye say
[39:20] whosoever shall say to his father his
[39:22] mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou
[39:24] mightest be profited by me
[39:26] in honor not his father is his mother he
[39:29] shall be free so even though the
[39:30] scripture says he ought to be put to
[39:32] death you liberate him and free him thus
[39:35] have you made the commandment of god of
[39:36] none effect by your tradition ye
[39:38] hypocrites well did isaiah prophesy of
[39:41] you saying this people draw nine to me
[39:43] with their mouth and honoreth me with
[39:45] their lips but their heart is far from
[39:47] me but in vain they do worship me
[39:49] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[39:51] of men
[39:53] now i'm going to try to put this in just
[39:55] a little bit different terms so we can
[39:57] understand this
[39:59] in deuteronomy 5 exodus 21 the word
[40:01] created an obligation and i'll just put
[40:03] it in maybe more modern terms created an
[40:05] obligation
[40:06] for a child to support his parents if
[40:10] they were in need
[40:11] so provide some sort of relief and uh to
[40:14] give them some sort of aid to give them
[40:16] uh food or money or some some some sort
[40:18] of if they were in need and deficit then
[40:20] the word obligated a son or a daughter
[40:23] to give to their parents to meet their
[40:26] needs
[40:27] but jesus is saying that the pharisees
[40:29] and these other jewish leaders had
[40:31] honored a tradition and created a
[40:33] tradition that actually was against the
[40:35] word
[40:37] where they said and this is what jesus
[40:39] said they're saying even if your parents
[40:41] are in need and your parents
[40:42] need your support you may give your
[40:45] money and give your support money to the
[40:48] church instead
[40:50] like the word would obligate you
[40:52] to give this money to your parents but
[40:55] will it in order for you to fulfill your
[40:58] obligation in the word but we'll let you
[41:00] give it to the church
[41:02] and by giving it to the church you
[41:04] fulfilled your obligation and you can go
[41:06] free
[41:08] and you realize how that how that breaks
[41:10] down
[41:11] by their man-made tradition they voided
[41:13] the direct commandment of god's word and
[41:16] in doing so they bypassed the wisdom of
[41:18] the word that you create this obligation
[41:21] where children were to support their
[41:22] parents with their need why so that
[41:24] their parents who are in need could be
[41:26] supported
[41:28] and it creates this discipline and an
[41:30] honor and it's a it's a system that
[41:32] would help maintain the health of
[41:34] families and the health of the nation
[41:36] and keep everyone supported but the
[41:38] church comes up with a different way and
[41:40] really to line their pockets to make
[41:42] them look better and and to satisfy
[41:44] their means and they bypass the word of
[41:46] god and in direct violation of god's
[41:49] word
[41:51] and so they come up with and this is
[41:53] where i just trust god could amplify
[41:55] this to your minds and in your hearts
[41:57] because i think this is could be applied
[41:58] in so many other ways and it could be
[42:00] more instructive if the holy spirit did
[42:02] it for you than me just using examples
[42:04] but they came up with the religious
[42:06] function that profited the church
[42:08] and justified the worshiper or the
[42:10] individual but didn't honor god's word
[42:14] came up with some sort of religious
[42:15] function something you could do
[42:18] that would profit the church
[42:20] make the individual feel justified but
[42:22] didn't honor god's word i feel like in
[42:24] some ways i've just defined catholicism
[42:28] and so there's other ways brother
[42:30] vincent caught on to that then there's
[42:32] other ways that you might be able to
[42:33] recognize that maybe in and not so whoa
[42:35] that's way down there we're not
[42:36] catholics
[42:38] but there's ways we can become message
[42:39] catholics
[42:40] there's ways that we can become very
[42:42] denominational become very religious and
[42:44] perform things through some sort of
[42:46] perfunctory religious duty that's going
[42:47] to benefit the church and the overall
[42:49] church and the church system this church
[42:50] structure make me feel good about myself
[42:53] but what what was i doing
[42:55] why was i doing it how has the word of
[42:57] god been on to honored and if we're not
[43:00] if we don't know what we're doing and
[43:02] why we're doing it am i following the
[43:04] routine of the scriptures in the plan of
[43:05] god that's going to benefit me when the
[43:08] rapture is going to come through what
[43:10] following the routine of the scriptures
[43:12] in the plan of god that's how the
[43:13] rapture is going to take place but if i
[43:15] find myself entering more into this
[43:17] blind trust into a religious system in
[43:19] some sort of a
[43:21] structure and function where i can give
[43:23] i can do something within this context
[43:25] and it benefits the church and makes me
[43:27] feel good but that's not going to get
[43:28] you closer to a rapture
[43:31] and when we pause for a moment and ask
[43:33] ourselves is what i'm doing why i'm
[43:36] doing it getting me closer to a body
[43:38] change that'll cause a lot of people to
[43:40] change what they're doing
[43:41] if they really want a body change we
[43:43] came to that realization as a famine
[43:45] this is very personal but we came to
[43:46] this realization as a family that what
[43:48] we were doing and where we were and what
[43:50] was taking place was not getting us
[43:52] closer to supreme faith
[43:56] and that if that's what we wanted as a
[43:58] as individual christians and that's what
[43:59] we wanted for our children then we had
[44:01] to make a very difficult decision to be
[44:04] where we could get supreme faith i thank
[44:06] god it's in phoenix now
[44:08] but we're challenged by this idea it's
[44:10] not just going to church it's not just
[44:12] oh is there a church there does the
[44:14] church believe the message oh great i
[44:15] want to go there i want to be where i
[44:18] know the word i'm hearing is creating an
[44:21] opportunity for me to follow in the
[44:23] routine of the scriptures fulfill the
[44:25] plan of god for a rapture because this
[44:28] is rapture season
[44:32] jesus is just taking this
[44:35] uh uh
[44:36] the religion and the pharisitical
[44:39] approach to tradition and saying listen
[44:41] your traditions are real strong and real
[44:43] great and all figured out makes
[44:44] everybody feel good but you're not even
[44:46] honoring god's word
[44:48] and he called the multitude verse 10 and
[44:50] said unto them hear and understand and
[44:53] this really
[44:54] this really bothers these pharisees
[44:57] not that which goeth into the mouth
[44:58] defileth a man
[45:01] but that which cometh out of the mouth
[45:02] that defileth the man in other words
[45:04] it's not eating non-kosher food that's
[45:07] going to corrupt you
[45:08] because this is what's so big the
[45:10] the religious function and the and all
[45:12] the sticklers of all these other things
[45:14] and
[45:15] that if you eat this it's going to
[45:16] defile you says it's not eating
[45:17] non-kosher food that's going to corrupt
[45:19] a man and make him wicked
[45:21] he says it's that which cometh out of
[45:23] the mouth that defileth a man now he's
[45:24] going to expound upon this later because
[45:26] the disciples asked maybe peter says can
[45:27] you explain this a little bit more to me
[45:29] and he says hey whatever you eat just
[45:30] comes out right body digest it
[45:33] but he's saying there's things that are
[45:36] morally corrupt within a man in on the
[45:38] inside and that comes out that's where
[45:40] the corruption is
[45:42] so after he makes this statement that
[45:44] really runs against the tradition of the
[45:46] elders and these jewish leaders and
[45:47] these pharisees
[45:48] of hey don't worry all this non-kosher
[45:51] food you think that's eating that meat
[45:53] is really going to morally corrupt
[45:54] somebody he says then came his disciples
[45:57] in him know us thou that the pharisees
[45:59] were offended after they heard the
[46:00] saying boy you really offended him this
[46:02] time
[46:03] but he answered and said every plant
[46:05] which my father heavenly father hath not
[46:07] planted shall be rooted up
[46:10] a strong language
[46:11] let them alone
[46:13] he says they be blind leaders of the
[46:16] blind
[46:17] and if the blind lead the blind both
[46:21] shall fall into the ditch
[46:24] he's saying the pharisees are blind
[46:27] they are blind leaders of the blind
[46:31] and if the blind are leading the blind
[46:35] the blind leaders fall in the ditch
[46:37] and the blind followers fall into the
[46:40] ditch
[46:41] so they're saying the pharisees are
[46:42] blind because and they're blind to what
[46:45] the word of god
[46:46] they're blind to
[46:48] they they could probably quote
[46:49] deuteronomy 5 they could do quote exodus
[46:51] 21 they knew honor thy father and their
[46:53] mother and he that revived his father
[46:55] and mother is to be cursed and
[46:57] and they understood those things but
[46:59] then they're blind to what they were
[47:01] doing and why they were doing it and
[47:03] they come up with what they think is a
[47:05] tradition that in their minds they
[47:07] rationalize somehow satisfied the
[47:10] obligation that was created by the
[47:12] commandment of god but it was actually
[47:14] anti-word
[47:16] they said they're blind they don't have
[47:17] any understanding they don't even know
[47:19] what they're doing and why they're doing
[47:20] it and everyone else is blind following
[47:25] blind leaders
[47:27] and if you're following a blind leader
[47:28] jesus says you fall into a ditch if
[47:30] you're blind you'll fall in a blind
[47:31] leader you follow there's no progress
[47:35] there was no benefit from the traditions
[47:37] it was actually making the word of god
[47:39] of none effect in other words the word
[47:40] has a purpose it ought to be effective
[47:42] it ought to produce something in your
[47:44] life it ought to bring you further
[47:46] in this spectrum of faith but when you
[47:48] make it a tradition
[47:50] you're going to stay within that
[47:52] tradition
[47:53] so you're stumbling
[47:54] in darkness you know not what you
[47:56] stumble at you're not going forward
[47:57] you're not this is not the path of the
[47:59] just that shineth more and more into a
[48:00] perfect day you're kind of caught in
[48:02] this system you're caught in this
[48:03] paradigm you're caught in this way of
[48:04] viewing things and it's traditionally it
[48:06] stagnates and it grows cold he says
[48:08] there's no progress there's just
[48:09] stumbling
[48:12] there's a saying i think was a ball
[48:13] player back in the 70s made a comment he
[48:15] couldn't tell if he was in a groove or a
[48:17] rut
[48:19] right because if you're in a groove and
[48:20] in some ways it's kind of shaped like a
[48:21] rut
[48:22] but when you're when you're when you're
[48:24] on a road this is something that's been
[48:26] grooved out this is something that's
[48:28] been playing now something that's been
[48:29] leveled out for you to go on a
[48:31] particular path so that you can be more
[48:33] expedient in your travel well you could
[48:35] there's a ditch that can line that
[48:38] and basically kind of go in the same
[48:41] way as the road
[48:43] but it's a lot harder to make the way in
[48:44] the ditch
[48:45] than it is on the road
[48:47] and so here they stumble into the ditch
[48:49] they seem to be real close maybe ride in
[48:51] the border like but you can't make
[48:53] progress in the ditch
[48:56] now i want you to ponder this and think
[48:57] about this
[48:59] they be blind leaders of the blind if
[49:01] the blind lead the blind
[49:03] both shall fall into the ditch
[49:06] he does he is not making the proposition
[49:08] i know he didn't think about this but
[49:10] just by me bringing it up maybe it's i
[49:12] would have never thought of that but it
[49:14] caused us to think about the scripture
[49:15] in another dimension he's not making the
[49:17] proposition
[49:18] that we ought to be blind followers
[49:22] it's not the fact that there was blind
[49:24] leaders
[49:25] that was bad so as long as the blind or
[49:27] following a sighted leader were okay but
[49:30] they're both wrong
[49:32] you don't want to be a sighted leader
[49:34] leading the blind
[49:37] but a lot of people these days want
[49:38] their sheep to be blind
[49:40] right
[49:41] and they want to blind trust
[49:44] and accept all my bad faith arguments
[49:47] because they they're the leaders with
[49:48] vision and follow me i'm going to lead
[49:50] you to a rapture and they exploit these
[49:52] things to the detriment of the people
[49:54] and they get away with it because the
[49:56] people are told keep your head down
[49:58] close your eyes
[49:59] trust me
[50:01] and the bible is saying no that's not
[50:03] how jesus is not saying it's okay for
[50:05] you to be blind if your leaders are
[50:06] sighted is saying the leaders ought not
[50:08] to be sighted or they ought not to be
[50:10] blind and neither should you be blind
[50:13] with the scriptures not telling us that
[50:15] we are to be blind followers to be a
[50:17] blind follower is blind trust and bad
[50:20] faith
[50:23] we should never follow anything blindly
[50:27] i feel like i'm doing
[50:29] all right with time so i'm going to read
[50:31] this statement i'm going to read through
[50:32] it and i want you to just kind of catch
[50:34] what brother branham is writing here in
[50:36] chapter 4 of the church age book it's
[50:37] time to get back to god
[50:39] they have a name that they live but are
[50:41] dead
[50:42] tongues
[50:43] aren't the evidence of revival it is the
[50:45] evidence of death
[50:47] tongues proclaimed the evidence that the
[50:48] ceremonial religion of the jews was over
[50:51] that a new era had begun now this is
[50:53] pretty heavy stuff
[50:55] tongues is not the evidence of revival
[50:57] it's the evidence of death
[50:59] this is very very striking
[51:02] and the way that he's putting it in this
[51:03] context it to be very uh
[51:06] i think we should we should desire to
[51:08] really catch the theme the heart of what
[51:10] the prophet is expressing tongues today
[51:13] are ringing down the curtain of the
[51:14] gentile church ages and the gospel's
[51:17] going back to the jews so once we have
[51:19] the restoration of the gifts and
[51:20] speaking in tongues
[51:21] it was once again signifying a new era
[51:25] a change
[51:27] it says people are talking about tongues
[51:29] heralding in a great spiritual move they
[51:31] have missed the boat
[51:33] that's quite a phrase for formal writing
[51:35] they have missed the boat the truth is
[51:37] that it is writing the finish to all of
[51:40] man's ideas programs and kingdoms and
[51:43] the kingdom of god is being ushered in
[51:45] so the speaking in tongues is not in
[51:48] itself this great awakening this
[51:51] spiritual move this great revival in the
[51:53] tongue all the tongues this is life this
[51:55] is revival brother said no the
[51:57] restoration of the gifts is now
[51:59] signifying that we're entering into a
[52:00] new era the curtain is coming down on
[52:02] the gentile kingdom and there's a move
[52:05] of god where man's ideas and programs
[52:07] and kingdoms are going to be torn down
[52:09] and the kingdom of god is going to have
[52:10] preeminence that's what it's a symbol of
[52:13] wake up people of god wake up
[52:16] he says if you don't think this is true
[52:18] just listen to this all over the world
[52:19] in both pentecostal and fundamental
[52:21] groups they're organizing the
[52:23] businessmen
[52:25] they have invaded the pulpit without a
[52:27] call from god
[52:29] they have styled themselves the fishers
[52:31] of men and the founders of a move of god
[52:36] this is very stag striking here
[52:39] they say the gifted ministry of
[52:41] ephesians 4 10 to 13 that god gave the
[52:44] church has failed so they are taking
[52:46] over
[52:48] actually he specifically said we've had
[52:50] all these preachers for some 55 years
[52:52] and hadn't had a rapture yet
[52:54] so let's just go back to tapes only
[52:58] isn't that interesting
[52:59] here we are right in the midst of the
[53:00] fulfillment of prophecy calling the game
[53:02] sayings of korra and they don't even
[53:04] know that they have fulfilled it they
[53:06] are blindly going on preaching
[53:09] experience for truth
[53:11] so it's blind leaders
[53:13] preaching what experience
[53:15] for truth
[53:18] in other words
[53:19] the experience itself becomes the truth
[53:22] well did you speak in tongues then you
[53:24] got it
[53:26] did you feel it then you got it it
[53:28] doesn't have its bases in the word of
[53:31] god
[53:32] he's not it's not bringing it back to
[53:33] god made the promise god fulfilled the
[53:35] promise god said he would do this god
[53:36] did that so they are blindly preaching
[53:39] experience for truth they are blind
[53:41] leaders
[53:43] and in reality this is to me it may be a
[53:46] the perfect way to understand that
[53:47] scripture blind leaders can only lead
[53:50] the blind
[53:52] because a blind leader is never going to
[53:54] get away with leading somebody who could
[53:56] see because they're like uh
[53:58] do you even know what you're doing and
[53:59] why you're doing it
[54:02] i have no idea where you're going i have
[54:04] no idea what you're trying to do
[54:06] this is not right i can see better than
[54:08] this
[54:09] my sheep hear my voice and they'll not
[54:11] follow they will not follow another they
[54:13] will follow only him and they can tell
[54:15] by the way this guy is going he is just
[54:17] making this up as he goes
[54:19] he's a blind leader of the blind and
[54:22] therefore it's saying that if you have
[54:24] eyes to see follow what you see follow
[54:27] what you know
[54:30] and don't blindly accept experience for
[54:32] truth he says may god have pity on them
[54:34] may their eyes be opened before it is
[54:36] too late
[54:37] oh listen to me and this is i just wanna
[54:40] i actually was gonna take it out i
[54:42] thought that this would be just perfect
[54:44] just to let this marinate for a while
[54:47] when did the prestige of money
[54:49] social leadership business ability or
[54:52] sheer mental prowess ever qualify a man
[54:55] for spiritual leadership or give any
[54:57] weight to the word of god
[54:59] why should any of these things give more
[55:01] weight to what somebody is saying than
[55:02] just the word itself
[55:04] how would this give anybody more
[55:06] spiritual leadership than the word that
[55:09] they preach
[55:10] and when in any way materiality or human
[55:12] values begin to show as the media by
[55:15] which god works isn't that remarkable
[55:18] media wouldn't even is more prominent
[55:20] these days social media just
[55:22] entertainment media materiality or human
[55:24] values begin to show as the media by
[55:26] which god works instead of the holy
[55:28] spirit alone then we are fighting
[55:29] against god not for him
[55:32] when we allow materiality and human
[55:34] values to begin to show as the means by
[55:36] which god works and the way that we
[55:38] think god is working in the evidence by
[55:40] which god is moving when we look to all
[55:42] these natural things instead of the holy
[55:44] spirit alone we're actually fighting
[55:47] against god
[55:49] it's not enough that you've it's not
[55:50] that you've created your own arena and
[55:52] you're just over here playing church
[55:54] you've actually lined yourself up on a
[55:56] battlefield and drawn a line and you've
[55:59] stood against god's word
[56:02] it's not like you're just off playing a
[56:04] game somewhere by yourself oh we're just
[56:05] gonna do this and believe that he says
[56:07] you're actually fighting against god not
[56:09] for him
[56:13] and when paul said we walk by faith not
[56:15] by sight he is characterized the
[56:17] believer of having a particular dispens
[56:20] a disposition
[56:21] strong conviction and faith
[56:24] that we walk by things that aren't seen
[56:28] and then so it's a paradox
[56:31] in that
[56:33] brother branham is talking about blind
[56:35] leaders
[56:36] preaching experience for truth so some
[56:39] experience is something that the senses
[56:40] are having to declare to you
[56:43] and he says open your eyes so what are
[56:44] they blind to the spiritual reality of
[56:46] things
[56:47] it's not really faith it's not just it's
[56:49] not that real conviction
[56:52] because he says money social leadership
[56:55] business ability share mental prowess
[56:58] materiality
[57:00] human values
[57:02] is what people are drawn to
[57:05] and if you think about the world today
[57:07] as contrasted by
[57:08] a true believer the body of christ
[57:11] they're influenced by the things that
[57:12] are seen
[57:14] that's what influences them
[57:17] and so if they can see it they trust
[57:20] what they're seeing
[57:22] and they go they're only going by what
[57:23] is presented to them in the appearance
[57:25] paul says we walk by faith not just the
[57:28] mere appearance of things
[57:30] we walk by faith not just by how things
[57:32] appear because sometimes things will
[57:34] appear in a certain way but we have to
[57:36] have discernment to try the spirit to
[57:38] know whether it be of god or not to get
[57:39] behind it and understand the motive
[57:41] objective behind it so we're not just
[57:42] always going by appearance
[57:45] but the world goes by appearance they
[57:48] live for pleasure they live for
[57:49] possessions they live for popularity
[57:51] this is this is how the world lives if
[57:54] it can bring them pleasure they'll do it
[57:56] if it can bring them possessions and
[57:57] money and wealth they'll do it if they
[57:58] can bring them fame they'll do it it's
[58:01] things what the world lives by are
[58:02] things that only the world can give
[58:06] and when you put it in that context when
[58:08] paul says we walk by faith not by sight
[58:10] the world
[58:12] lives as if there's nothing unseen
[58:16] and when you talk about the tenets of
[58:17] communism brother man talks about
[58:19] communism taking over america
[58:21] communism one of its uh
[58:23] foundational beliefs
[58:26] is that there is nothing unseen
[58:29] there is not a supernatural
[58:31] there is not something beyond this
[58:34] everything there's got to be there's no
[58:36] uh subjective truth it's ev everything's
[58:39] common everything's agreed upon there's
[58:40] no supernatural there's no god beyond
[58:43] what we see there's things there it's
[58:44] only what's in this world that we can
[58:46] touch and taste and and these different
[58:48] things so that actually the world lives
[58:51] merely
[58:52] they do not they live as if there's
[58:53] nothing unseen
[58:55] and they live only by the appearance of
[58:57] things
[59:00] and just even in our base nature as
[59:02] human beings
[59:04] we really do blindly trust
[59:06] what we can see
[59:09] we blindly trust we can touch and what
[59:11] we can taste and what we hear we can
[59:13] hear something and we're very it's very
[59:15] easy just to believe what we heard and
[59:18] what's the uh the
[59:20] i don't think it's called the truth
[59:21] fallacy trying to remember exactly what
[59:23] fallacy of truth might be what it's
[59:24] called that the more often you hear
[59:26] something the more likely you are to
[59:28] believe that it's true even if it's a
[59:29] lie
[59:30] just because you hear it so much
[59:32] and so don't you don't you see the
[59:34] challenge and the hour that we're living
[59:35] in we're through every channel through
[59:37] every way there's things there's lies
[59:39] there's myth truths there's fake news or
[59:41] all sorts of stuff that's trying to be
[59:42] channeled and presented to us and we
[59:44] might hear it and be like well that
[59:45] doesn't sound right but you keep hearing
[59:47] it
[59:48] and pretty soon you're like well i heard
[59:51] or you just believe it to be true you're
[59:52] not even sure why you do it's just
[59:54] through the repetition of a lie
[59:56] and we have to be very careful to
[59:58] realize the world lives by that metric
[1:00:01] that's how that's science science it's
[1:00:02] got to be something that can be
[1:00:03] confirmed tested proven confirmed
[1:00:06] hypothesized
[1:00:08] subject to a very rigorous method to
[1:00:09] come up with some some immutable fact of
[1:00:11] this method and the world lives by what
[1:00:14] can be touched lives by what can be seen
[1:00:16] what can be tasted and felt and they
[1:00:17] live by that without any realization or
[1:00:21] consideration of what may be unseen
[1:00:26] let's just live this life and enjoy this
[1:00:27] life what about a life to come
[1:00:30] they don't live with this reality that
[1:00:33] they're going to be called to answer for
[1:00:35] what they see and what they taste and
[1:00:36] what they do
[1:00:39] brother brown in the church age book the
[1:00:41] same chapter chapter 4
[1:00:43] he's talking about the misunderstanding
[1:00:46] and the false teaching
[1:00:47] that you can have an experience of being
[1:00:49] born again and have eternal life and
[1:00:51] then there's another experience of
[1:00:53] receiving the seal of god or the baptism
[1:00:56] of the holy ghost so there's like this
[1:00:57] one is the salvation and
[1:01:00] and they'll be born again and you have
[1:01:01] eternal life and then there comes this
[1:01:02] another
[1:01:03] baptism of dynamic power and he's saying
[1:01:06] there's that there's he said they're one
[1:01:08] and the same
[1:01:10] but there's this teaching that kind of
[1:01:11] divides and tries to separate him in the
[1:01:13] church age book he's being very
[1:01:14] particular to divide that out he says
[1:01:16] what is it that caused this
[1:01:18] misunderstanding that would separate the
[1:01:19] two
[1:01:21] he said the answer is experience
[1:01:24] what has caused this misunderstanding
[1:01:27] experience
[1:01:28] it could be the blind preachers right
[1:01:33] blindly preaching experience for truth
[1:01:35] they take their experience
[1:01:37] and cause a misunderstanding
[1:01:40] well i remember i got saved when this
[1:01:41] happened then i got the holy ghost later
[1:01:43] so i must have been born again then and
[1:01:45] got the holy ghost later and they try to
[1:01:47] take their experience and make it fit
[1:01:49] take the word and make it fit their
[1:01:51] experience he says listen listen as he
[1:01:53] says we've gone by experience and not
[1:01:55] the word
[1:01:56] away with experience as your measuring
[1:01:59] line there's only one plumb line only
[1:02:02] one rod and that is the word
[1:02:06] so not this is this is a
[1:02:10] it's i i use the term paradox because
[1:02:12] it's interesting
[1:02:14] that people are using experience as
[1:02:16] validation experience for truth and they
[1:02:19] say well spirit i can see it i can feel
[1:02:21] it i can taste it i i've heard it this
[1:02:22] is wonderful this is great we're
[1:02:24] interacting with it and brother is
[1:02:25] saying call that that's blind
[1:02:28] he's saying that is blindness
[1:02:31] why because it's not faith in the word
[1:02:35] because faith is a greater eyesight he
[1:02:37] said you guys are just blindly trusting
[1:02:39] your experience oh you felt good and it
[1:02:40] was like this happened and this happened
[1:02:42] oh that must be why but he said you've
[1:02:44] got to come back to the word you've got
[1:02:45] to base it on the word so he goes so far
[1:02:48] and say away with experience as your rod
[1:02:52] away with experience as your measurement
[1:02:54] well i remember when i was 13 i gave my
[1:02:56] heart to lord and i was born again and i
[1:02:57] received eternal life and then i didn't
[1:02:59] get the seal again i lived in sin and
[1:03:00] this happened to him i didn't get the
[1:03:02] holy ghost until later don't try to take
[1:03:04] your experience and make sense of the
[1:03:06] word just accept the word
[1:03:08] thank god for prior experiences thank
[1:03:10] god for giving your life as a young
[1:03:12] child thank god for his rescuing out of
[1:03:14] sin if you backslid don't take your
[1:03:16] experience as the measuring line and try
[1:03:19] to make the word fit your experience
[1:03:20] just know that your experience fit the
[1:03:22] word
[1:03:24] that one day through everything i
[1:03:26] experienced and everything that i went
[1:03:28] through whether that was my
[1:03:29] justification and this was my
[1:03:30] sanctification just rest in the fact
[1:03:33] that you were born again by the baptism
[1:03:35] of the holy ghost
[1:03:37] that you've had that sure experience
[1:03:40] because that's a word experience
[1:03:43] and i want to this is i
[1:03:47] well
[1:03:50] i'm just going to try to go quickly here
[1:03:52] i'll go as long as my voice will hold
[1:03:54] out i told them to turn down the
[1:03:55] monitors i think they just turned them
[1:03:56] off
[1:03:59] because it must just be a real sweet
[1:04:00] spot there between what sounds good to
[1:04:02] me and what they can actually do back
[1:04:04] there
[1:04:04] and so i think i'm getting out losing my
[1:04:07] voice
[1:04:10] this is where now
[1:04:12] i feel like you're right with me now
[1:04:13] this might i want to bring this balance
[1:04:16] to it
[1:04:17] brother brown is saying we've gone by
[1:04:18] experience and not the word away with
[1:04:20] experience is the plumb line experiences
[1:04:22] cause misunderstanding blind leaders are
[1:04:24] preaching experience for truth and it
[1:04:26] can kind of create this
[1:04:28] ah ooh well experience i don't know
[1:04:30] but faith
[1:04:32] true faith
[1:04:34] is a process
[1:04:36] of believing god's promise and
[1:04:38] experiencing him fulfilling it right
[1:04:41] so faith is vindicated through
[1:04:42] experience
[1:04:44] so for us we've gone we've actually been
[1:04:47] in the place where we didn't believe
[1:04:48] anything and god we hear the word
[1:04:49] preached and we experience something
[1:04:52] and that's what causes us to believe and
[1:04:55] so faith is vindicated through miracles
[1:04:58] and signs and wonders in mark chapter 16
[1:05:01] verses 17 and 18 and these signs shall
[1:05:03] follow them that believe in my name
[1:05:07] shall cast they shall cast out devils
[1:05:09] that's going to be an experience they
[1:05:11] shall speak with new tongues that's an
[1:05:12] experience that shall take up serpents
[1:05:13] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:05:15] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:05:17] the sick and they shall recover these
[1:05:18] are experiences of miracles
[1:05:22] but this has been said before notice it
[1:05:24] says
[1:05:25] these signs
[1:05:26] shall follow them that believe we've
[1:05:30] heard it so many times it's cliche it's
[1:05:31] just kind of yeah yeah yeah brother and
[1:05:33] we hear this every time the scripture is
[1:05:34] mentioned believers aren't following the
[1:05:37] signs
[1:05:38] we're not even believing the signs
[1:05:41] but these signs shall follow them that
[1:05:43] believe
[1:05:44] and if you get that mixed up you're
[1:05:46] going to get mixed up
[1:05:47] there's no telling where you're getting
[1:05:49] an apostasy in rejection and blasphemy
[1:05:52] when you get it the other way around
[1:05:53] where i'm going to believe the sign no
[1:05:55] signs follow the believers
[1:06:00] so you have to in looking at this i
[1:06:03] brought this up in the lateness of the
[1:06:04] hour and been long preaching already and
[1:06:06] i know you're being very very faithful
[1:06:08] just to stay focused i appreciate that
[1:06:10] never forget that the context of this
[1:06:13] these signs follow the believers these
[1:06:16] things are done to vindicate faith
[1:06:20] these things are done by virtue of faith
[1:06:23] these signs follow them that believe
[1:06:25] they're a confirmation of faith they're
[1:06:27] vindication of faith
[1:06:30] and this is what i'll be very careful
[1:06:31] maybe i realize maybe it would be good
[1:06:32] just to start singing take the name of
[1:06:34] jesus with you because i want you to i
[1:06:35] don't want you to
[1:06:37] lose sight of i don't want you to put
[1:06:39] this in the wrong part of the puzzle
[1:06:43] these things do not become the object of
[1:06:45] faith
[1:06:47] these things come out of faith
[1:06:49] confirm faith
[1:06:51] but they're not the object of faith
[1:06:53] where we let experience take precedent
[1:06:55] over the word
[1:06:57] we're now everything is just all about
[1:06:59] whether or not we can feel and we could
[1:07:00] do this miracle and do this and do that
[1:07:02] and it all becomes about that and said
[1:07:04] this is this this is the outflow of my
[1:07:06] faith
[1:07:08] these things happen because i believe
[1:07:10] god i take god at his word i'm trusting
[1:07:11] him there's a need that arises i pray i
[1:07:13] lay my hands on the sick these things
[1:07:15] take place we don't become serpent
[1:07:17] hunters
[1:07:18] i just find a snake today somebody
[1:07:20] brings snake anybody brings snake they
[1:07:21] handle snakes
[1:07:22] so we can assume what proof prove that
[1:07:24] we're believers
[1:07:26] i want to go to the altar now i might be
[1:07:27] able to hurry right there you keep
[1:07:28] passing my time out of there because i
[1:07:29] think in tongues
[1:07:30] right that's what i'm looking for i want
[1:07:32] to have the experience we don't become
[1:07:34] experienced hunters we trust the word of
[1:07:36] god we believe the word of god these
[1:07:38] signs shall follow them that believe and
[1:07:40] i am trusting to see that in our lives
[1:07:43] we'll experience these things
[1:07:45] as we believe god and take him at his
[1:07:48] word
[1:07:51] and as these things transpire and take
[1:07:53] place these signs that follow the
[1:07:54] believer they become a part of the
[1:07:55] purpose and plan of god
[1:07:57] to what perfect
[1:07:59] you your character
[1:08:02] and to rapture the bride
[1:08:05] this is what they're all for
[1:08:07] this is what these things ought to be
[1:08:08] doing these things are done to make
[1:08:11] confirm our faith to vindicate that
[1:08:12] we're on the right path that we can
[1:08:13] trust god to where we get to the place
[1:08:15] to where it's just the regular routine
[1:08:16] of following the scriptures in the plan
[1:08:18] of god after you've trusted him and
[1:08:20] watched him do many things till it just
[1:08:21] becomes a regular routine
[1:08:23] so we're not just focused on
[1:08:26] manufacturing these things but in doing
[1:08:28] what god's will these things happen
[1:08:30] because they follow the believer
[1:08:33] brother branham in the message perfect
[1:08:34] faith we quoted earlier he says if you
[1:08:36] had faith what are you standing in the
[1:08:37] prayer line for
[1:08:38] he says the word operated in human flesh
[1:08:41] by physical signs by material signs by
[1:08:44] scriptural signs perfectly to bring to
[1:08:47] you a perfect faith for a perfect
[1:08:50] rapture so then it must be the word
[1:08:53] operated in the human flesh the word
[1:08:54] operating in human flesh will bring
[1:08:56] physical signs material signs scriptural
[1:08:58] signs and that ought to bring us to a
[1:09:00] perfect faith for perfect rapture
[1:09:03] but that's not going to happen if our
[1:09:05] faith is centered on the signs and our
[1:09:08] faith is centered on the materiality of
[1:09:11] things and our faith is centered on and
[1:09:13] those things become the object of our
[1:09:14] faith and not the the result of our
[1:09:17] faith because our faith must be centered
[1:09:18] on the word
[1:09:21] we must understand the purpose of these
[1:09:23] things
[1:09:26] jesus says in luke chapter 6 verses 39
[1:09:28] and 40 and he spake a parable unto them
[1:09:30] can the blind lead the blind
[1:09:33] if we answered yes
[1:09:34] the the truth is not well
[1:09:37] but the blind cannot lead the blind to
[1:09:39] the gold the purpose i know they say a
[1:09:41] broken clock is right twice
[1:09:44] a day
[1:09:48] i don't know what if that one's right or
[1:09:49] not i got one in front of me tells me
[1:09:51] i'm i'm late i know that
[1:09:53] say a blind scroll can find a nut every
[1:09:55] once in a while
[1:09:57] so we're not talking about blind luck
[1:09:59] blind can't really lead the blind cannot
[1:10:01] make the goal and shall they both not
[1:10:03] vote he says shall they not both fall
[1:10:05] into the ditch
[1:10:07] but then watch this next part this is
[1:10:08] the part to me it's so beautiful blind
[1:10:10] leaders of the blind you're a blind
[1:10:13] leader you're a blind follower guess
[1:10:15] what you're always going to be
[1:10:16] blind
[1:10:19] so the result is the same and you both
[1:10:21] end up in the ditch
[1:10:22] so in that way you do have a scenario
[1:10:24] where hey i followed really really well
[1:10:26] i'm just like my leader he's blind he's
[1:10:28] in a ditch i'm blind i'm in a ditch look
[1:10:30] at this is great it worked we're all the
[1:10:31] same
[1:10:32] but he says the disciple is not above
[1:10:34] his master but everyone that is perfect
[1:10:37] shall be as his master
[1:10:41] in other words if you have faith and
[1:10:43] you're following god you'll never be
[1:10:45] greater than christ you'll never be
[1:10:47] above them but the object of following
[1:10:50] god's plan the object of just a regular
[1:10:52] routine of following the scriptures and
[1:10:54] the plans of god the object of following
[1:10:57] god and following the word in signs
[1:10:59] following you is that you would be
[1:11:01] perfect as he is perfect
[1:11:04] that's the object of our faith and god
[1:11:06] confirming his promises is not that we
[1:11:08] would always be in a state of need but
[1:11:10] if our master had a faith then we could
[1:11:13] come to that supreme faith if christ
[1:11:16] lived a particular way then we can live
[1:11:18] that way we're not always these gravely
[1:11:20] beggars in need but we are becoming as
[1:11:23] our teacher
[1:11:26] the disciple can become perfect just as
[1:11:28] his master
[1:11:35] and the message unchangeable word of god
[1:11:37] he said that's the reason they give
[1:11:38] prayer cards
[1:11:43] if you don't you'll come right back in
[1:11:44] the line again
[1:11:46] come back again
[1:11:48] it just weakens your faith each time go
[1:11:51] weaker and weaker weaker and weaker
[1:11:55] but the man referenced
[1:11:57] the problem he had early on in his
[1:11:58] ministry i believe where he said the
[1:11:59] angel lord told him that the people are
[1:12:01] going to get to the place to where they
[1:12:02] won't do anything unless they see a sign
[1:12:04] and he said it hinders he even talked
[1:12:06] about how he entered his ministry
[1:12:07] because things always had to go to
[1:12:09] direct positive
[1:12:11] so instead of assigning
[1:12:14] creating a faith
[1:12:16] to say wow
[1:12:17] god said he would do that and he did it
[1:12:21] well if god can do that then he can do
[1:12:23] this
[1:12:25] it creates this very narrow paradigm
[1:12:27] through which people want to meet god
[1:12:29] it always has to be at the altar it
[1:12:31] always has to be in a prayer line it
[1:12:33] always has to be in this particular way
[1:12:35] and god i think god is very gracious to
[1:12:37] us sometimes to withhold from us that
[1:12:39] same ex that that experience
[1:12:42] and to not keep meeting us there because
[1:12:44] he's like look i got so much more for
[1:12:46] you
[1:12:48] the the and to recognize the very faith
[1:12:50] that's trying to that i'm trying to use
[1:12:52] to draw me back to that is trying to
[1:12:54] tell me you could take him
[1:12:56] where you are at hearing the word of god
[1:12:58] you can take him right where you are
[1:13:01] and he recognizes this dynamic you would
[1:13:03] think that if coming through a proud
[1:13:04] especially one that let's just all be
[1:13:05] honest
[1:13:06] we could all agree well brother aaron
[1:13:08] you're going to have a prayer meeting
[1:13:08] every sunday and we went through it i
[1:13:10] already just get weaker and weaker it's
[1:13:12] me right
[1:13:14] but with the brother branham this is my
[1:13:15] brother brown's prayer line
[1:13:17] if you come back through this prophet's
[1:13:19] prayer line he's saying it weakens your
[1:13:21] faith each time go weaker and weaker
[1:13:23] weaker and weaker he doesn't explain it
[1:13:25] but i don't think we have to have real
[1:13:27] deep uh understanding and knowledge to
[1:13:29] kind of figure out why you would your
[1:13:31] faith would get weaker when you come
[1:13:33] through the prayer line for your healing
[1:13:35] don't get it and come back again
[1:13:38] and are you convinced are you absolutely
[1:13:40] convinced oh no you just you know you
[1:13:42] just didn't pray long enough last time
[1:13:44] you're coming in doubt the second time
[1:13:46] well it didn't work the first time
[1:13:47] hopefully it'll work the second time
[1:13:48] maybe the third time's the charm what's
[1:13:50] happening each time expectation
[1:13:52] disappointment
[1:13:54] and you think oh wow i mean is it really
[1:13:56] going to work he's identifying that
[1:13:58] there's no vision to begin with there's
[1:14:01] no understanding
[1:14:02] upon the word of god the basis that
[1:14:04] you're meeting him the word of god that
[1:14:06] you're claiming and staking your promise
[1:14:07] on the faith that you're utilizing and
[1:14:09] acting in to even come to the prayer
[1:14:11] line and because of that there's no
[1:14:13] progress and when you keep trying to
[1:14:14] jump start it again your faith is
[1:14:16] getting weaker and weaker instead of
[1:14:18] stronger and stronger
[1:14:23] and he approaches it from this
[1:14:24] standpoint
[1:14:27] and the message perseverant
[1:14:29] brother brother mike if you guys could
[1:14:30] come just to create expectation for a
[1:14:32] close
[1:14:35] he says what's the use of coming up here
[1:14:37] if you're just walking up here
[1:14:40] he said a perfect faith if you if what
[1:14:42] do you stand at what are you coming up
[1:14:44] here for
[1:14:45] what do you do these things for
[1:14:48] he says you walk through tommy hicks
[1:14:49] line tommy osborne oral robbers then
[1:14:51] back and forth through the line it only
[1:14:53] weakens your faith that's all
[1:14:56] when you come here with the full
[1:14:57] assurance that you're not walking before
[1:14:59] your brother or anyone else you're
[1:15:00] coming here because the spirit of god in
[1:15:02] you has bid you to come something's
[1:15:04] going to happen
[1:15:06] that's the reason why you would do it
[1:15:08] not because it's called and everyone
[1:15:10] else is going you're not even going
[1:15:12] because oh i remember that one time at
[1:15:14] camp that's where i met god
[1:15:15] i want to feel that again
[1:15:17] and you're in prayer line trying to
[1:15:18] figure out why you're there
[1:15:20] what should i ask for hmm
[1:15:22] that's not what you do it for
[1:15:24] he said there's something where you know
[1:15:26] your bid to come something's going to
[1:15:27] happen there isn't nothing to keep it
[1:15:30] from it
[1:15:31] until then you're just on a walk
[1:15:36] until then you're just on a walk and you
[1:15:37] know what
[1:15:38] walking on a regular
[1:15:40] even there's even some people go to get
[1:15:42] uh
[1:15:44] emotional i need a i need a pill for
[1:15:45] this anxiety i need this and doctors
[1:15:47] will just say go on a walk go for a walk
[1:15:49] it's therapeutic
[1:15:50] walk and talk therapy
[1:15:52] it beats a lot of drugs that are out
[1:15:54] there
[1:15:55] because there's a benefit of
[1:15:56] physiological benefit there's an
[1:15:57] emotional benefit from walking and
[1:15:59] exerting yourself in the natural the
[1:16:01] mind and the body but this walk
[1:16:05] it's only going to weaken your faith
[1:16:07] you mean i could walk here and walk
[1:16:09] there run there run here and it weakened
[1:16:12] my faith yeah because faith works
[1:16:14] differently
[1:16:16] it's not through repetition
[1:16:18] alone just like anybody that lifts
[1:16:21] weights he'll tell you it's not just the
[1:16:23] reps you got to be doing them right
[1:16:25] if you're not doing the reps right you
[1:16:26] could be doing your body greater harm
[1:16:30] and no good at all
[1:16:33] and i think the same with faith muscles
[1:16:36] there's been things we've sought through
[1:16:38] the repetition of things and it really
[1:16:39] didn't make us stronger it made us
[1:16:40] weaker
[1:16:42] because we didn't understand what we
[1:16:43] were doing and why we were doing it
[1:16:46] he says until then you're just on a walk
[1:16:48] right around
[1:16:49] just on a walk right around next
[1:16:50] minister comes in town right around next
[1:16:52] minister comes right around that's no
[1:16:54] good
[1:16:55] then he says this there's nothing in a
[1:16:57] preacher no more than there is in your
[1:16:58] husband or your brother or whoever it
[1:17:00] might be we are just representatives of
[1:17:03] his
[1:17:04] telling you the word
[1:17:07] some of them have different gifts which
[1:17:08] the bible speaks of these gifts
[1:17:10] and i love this part
[1:17:12] this is all done to vindicate his
[1:17:13] presence
[1:17:16] let me say this just to clarify
[1:17:18] it's all done to vindicate his presence
[1:17:21] for you
[1:17:22] not for me
[1:17:24] not for the preacher
[1:17:25] not with the one who's getting ready to
[1:17:26] lay his hands on you
[1:17:28] not for the one that called the prayer
[1:17:30] line and we get names we maybe we could
[1:17:32] read this little bit differently you
[1:17:33] walk through tommy hicks line tommy
[1:17:34] osborne on line oral roberts line maybe
[1:17:36] we have different names today
[1:17:39] for our circle of fellowship the
[1:17:40] ministers that we god has met us in and
[1:17:43] god has vindicated godly men in this
[1:17:45] hour that he has vindicated with signs
[1:17:47] and gifts and we've witnessed it but yet
[1:17:50] there's a dynamic that brother branham's
[1:17:52] identifying that if you go through these
[1:17:54] lines and you don't understand what
[1:17:56] you're doing and why you're doing it
[1:17:57] you're just on a walk
[1:18:00] because when you went through that
[1:18:01] prayer line years ago and god met you
[1:18:03] the power of god fell upon you and you
[1:18:04] were healed or still with the holy ghost
[1:18:06] or spoke with tongues and whatever
[1:18:07] happened that didn't vindicate the
[1:18:09] minister it didn't vindicate the camp
[1:18:11] what it ought to have done is vindicated
[1:18:13] to you the presence of god in your life
[1:18:15] and how personal and intimate he wants
[1:18:17] to become and then you realize i've got
[1:18:19] access to this god without a prayer line
[1:18:21] without a cathedral without a tent
[1:18:23] meeting without a without a congregation
[1:18:26] without a preacher i've got access to
[1:18:28] the divine presence
[1:18:30] and whether it be pillars of fire or
[1:18:32] angels or tongues or miracles or signs
[1:18:34] and wonders you begin to have a personal
[1:18:36] intimate relationship with god and that
[1:18:38] becomes your type post
[1:18:42] because these things are done to
[1:18:42] vindicate his presence
[1:18:45] cause us to go forward walk further in
[1:18:47] the word of god
[1:18:49] who do we bow our heads this is a prayer
[1:18:51] that brother branham prays and i want
[1:18:52] there to be something instinctive inside
[1:18:54] of you
[1:18:55] something to help you something to
[1:18:56] encourage you
[1:18:58] brother branham and modern events are
[1:18:59] made clear by prophecy
[1:19:02] december 6 1965
[1:19:04] [Music]
[1:19:05] and father as we open this word now
[1:19:07] speak to us directly out of this word
[1:19:10] that we might know the hour that we are
[1:19:12] living
[1:19:14] if we know the hour we are living then
[1:19:16] we can prepare for that hour
[1:19:19] listen
[1:19:20] but if we go in blindly not knowing what
[1:19:23] or where
[1:19:24] then we don't know how to prepare
[1:19:27] think of this preparation
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:32] what am i doing that's preparing me for
[1:19:33] rapturing faith
[1:19:36] how are these things how are the me
[1:19:37] seeking signs and miracles and wonders
[1:19:39] and tongues and gifts
[1:19:41] in great choirs and moot specials or
[1:19:43] whatever it might be whatever they might
[1:19:45] sensitize you and really get you stirred
[1:19:47] up make you feel that god is moving how
[1:19:49] is all this preparing me for rapturing
[1:19:52] faith
[1:19:54] and this is his prayer i make this let's
[1:19:56] make this our prayer today as this
[1:19:58] morning is closing so father we pray
[1:20:01] that you
[1:20:02] will let us see the ark there
[1:20:05] and the door open
[1:20:07] and the message calling us in
[1:20:11] granted through jesus christ's name
[1:20:13] he says amen
[1:20:15] father we pray that you'll let us see
[1:20:17] the ark there the door open
[1:20:20] in the message
[1:20:21] calling us
[1:20:22] in
[1:20:23] that's what i want to see
[1:20:25] do everything that transpires i want to
[1:20:27] be calling me i want it to be the
[1:20:29] message calling me into this open door
[1:20:31] that vindicates his presence
[1:20:34] that gives me a faith
[1:20:36] to believe
[1:20:37] when it's hard to believe
[1:20:40] let's bow our heads stand together with
[1:20:41] me today
[1:20:48] you
