TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so I just want to say I I don't know if brother aon's listening or not but uh we certainly thank him for the opportunity he's never heard me preach um so uh some of you may know that sometimes that can be a risk uh you can get some interesting things that happen Lord willing that's not tonight so uh we'll uh just see how it goes but um I want to talk this evening and you can go ahead and bring up the title their brother um about the X Factor and in particular particular representation and as we go through this you'll understand what and I'm going to come back hopefully to that picture maybe at the end just to because I want to to focus on something there um in order to to kind of bring this out I I've got to go and set a foundation so um first thing I want to do is kind of set a foundation for the young ones so we understand what an X Factor is because I think the older ones we kind of know and an X Factor I'm not going to give you the definition I'm going to give you my personal definition it's basically something that you don't really know how it happens but yet somebody is able to do something incredible just because they have this particular thing whatever it is in their life right so if you would turn with your Bibles because I just want to give the young people an example just before we move on First Kings 19 and the Bible says this says and the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto Horeb the Mount of God so this is speaking of Elijah now and I I don't know about you all but I've never had food that lasted me more than a few days and you can tell that that I make sure I hang on to what I can uh so but Elijah here has something that's been given to him by God and that meat that he's been given he's able to take the strength of that food that he eats one day and 40 Days Later he's still able to to live off the strength of that meat now even science will tell us today that you can't go very long without food most people 40 days and you're going to be you know withered to nothing if if you last that long and most people will never do that with water even less it's just a few days actually you can go without water but the X Factor here is the fact that God could provide something to a man that could so strengthen him and so give him something in his being that would carry him for such a long long time so you understand that that's what a next factor is it's something outside of you something maybe outside of your ability or something outside of the way that you can do things that will allow you to do things that are Supernatural or things that are superum something that's beyond the norm form of what you would see physically or mentally or any of those other things something beyond that kind of Realm and that's what an X Factor is and so I just kind of want to set that groundwork before we get going here on on this service this evening and I I would love to to just jump in but I feel like we need to do a background on um kind of where I'm going with this with regard to representation and so um if you could just go to the next slide please so brother random says this I'm going to have to read it because I I don't have it with me so now things that were made of things that do not appear now I have learned through all these years that all the things that are natural are types of spiritual things everything that's in the natural and now just remember that when you see anything in the natural it's t typifying a spiritual thing see all things are made after things which do not appear see the natural then has reflected the spiritual I realize Aaron's got better eyes than I do because I should be able to read that from here and I'm having just a little bit of struggle so and I thought I made it big enough that I could even catch it from this distance but it didn't so the prophet is telling us that when you see something in the natural there's a significance to it and a lot of times we live our lives we see things all the time and we don't really realize that there's a significance to everything that's happening now I I think most of us will agree it's it's still a good time to be a Christian but it's probably not a great time to be an American or a Canadian or an AUST Australian or a New Zealander or any other country amen because pretty much The Fifth Dimension is kind of thrown up on the world right and it it just so the kids understand The Fifth Dimension is the bad Dimension where where there's really bad things okay that's where where Satan dwells and where the lost souls go and it looks like that's what you're dealing with all of the time is that that has just basically you know I and this is a terrible thing to say hopefully nobody's hungry but uh had projectile vomiting once and boy you I can't tell you what that's like but it it'll shoot across the room and that's kind of what Satan has done to the world it's just he's shot at everywhere and it's pretty much landed on everything and so for the world this is very discouraging but yet for the Christian we've got an X Factor that's always there and and we've got a representation that's always there and we've got something to look forward to and Beyond who's in control of this world right now and what's going on in in this world now the great thing is for the believer he's not in control of us right might be in control of politics might be in control of religion you know might be in control of different churches might be control of people might be control of the wind might be control of air but at the same time God provides a factor for us that allows us to escape all those different things it allows us to rise above Democrat or Republican and be Christian right it allows us to take steps Beyond those political divides or those religious divides or those different things like that allows us to get beyond that onto something else so if you could go to the next slide please so this is not my drawing this was not done by a a child um this is actually done by an astronaut and I don't know has anybody seen this before okay so uh it might be copyrighted I did my best to kind of piece together because I couldn't get a good picture this without taking several pieces of it and piecing it together but uh last year there was a group of astronauts that went uh into space they orbited the Earth three days and came back and the interesting thing about this AST astronaut group was all four of them were citizens not one of them was an astronaut and one of the people in in this particular ship called inspiration for on a dragon X um uh ship were sent into space and one of the people that were in there Drew this particular picture and it just really Drew my attention to something here because I thought that is really interesting because brother brandom talked about the red dragon and we know that was the Roman Catholic church but the dragon gave power to the Beast W right and this artist depiction was the Dragon giving power to their rocket or to to their spacecraft to get it out so that was her idea and and you know inspiration is a really interesting thing because we know that uh you know I don't know about you all and I'm pretty sure that you're with me but most of us don't believe in coincidence right you you may wait 20 or 30 years to realize why did this particular thing happen but it's not coincidental All Things fall into some kind of path or pattern because and I don't know how the Lord does it have you ever thought how do you keep you know all these different families and all these different individuals and all their different paths and how do you keep all these things working until all these things can come together like a bride draws together right until you're get to a bride that's going to be caught away how does all those things how's it I mean it's mindboggling to think of the different things because I can think of things in my life where you know 30 years 40 years 50 years sad to say that 50 years later you realized that something that happened way back then God had a plan and you w you you wouldn't see it until it came to fruition some decades later now you young people it might be years or days later but for some of us that have been here a little longer it becomes decades after a while and you don't see those kind of things but so we know that what the red dragon is and what it represents that we're not going to go down that path because it's just too long to to do but in Revelations 12 and and 13 you can read about it and see how that red dragon gave power to the Beast um it talks about the Seven Hills and you know the um and that so anyway do we understand that we kind of have a an idea of that so the reason that I guess I was drawn to this initially is because there was a brother that had come to me and he had a particular Revelation and I I won't tell you his Revelation and um but he had a particular number that he felt that the bride was going to be and he felt that absolutely brother Brandon and said it and he asked me did I know the number um and I said well I've heard a lot of numbers so uh and so he he shared with me this particular number and so I started to think about it you can take that down if you want um I started to think about it quite a bit and that led me to start to look into how many astronauts have been into space and the thing on human nature that I find is if you give somebody a number they try and figure it out they try and solve what it is so if you say there's three kinds of Believers in the church and and there's three of you guess what's going to happen everybody's going to be trying to figure out which is which right so if you say there's X number of people in The Bride guess what people are going to do they're going to try and figure it out and they're going to try and hold somebody out because oh you can't be because there's only this number and therefore this person can't be so I can treat that person differently because they're obviously not bride material this other person though well I can see them being in in this particular number that I've decided so they are so everything's good now right we're we've got it we we figured out the number everything's settled but God doesn't work that way and and I think brother brandham taught us the best lesson that he possibly could and that was if you're the only one that can believe the word and can be in the bride just be that one so then you only have to worry about yourself because that's what we're supposed to do is just worry about oursel nobody else we're we're supposed to take care of oursel now it doesn't mean we don't help people and try and help our family and pray for others but what I'm talking about is when it comes down to it you can't start putting people in you can't start putting people out and you can't start going by a number at least this is Brother Chris's opinion now Aaron can correct it later if he wants to but uh but if you start to put a number on something you're going to go in your mind to that number and that's why God doesn't tell us the day or the hour right because we're going to go to that day right I'm going to live however I want until the night before that day because that's human nature right that's what we do we we just go down that pathway and we try and think of those things or figure those things out right so um if you could pull up the next slide so this is probably a little bit of a hard picture to to see um but this is actually a capsule that had John Glenn in it he was an astronaut kids from a long time ago when I was a very young person like you all um and he's being lifted onto a particular ship so just to give you a little bit of background because I felt this was important and hopefully we can get actually to the message that I wanted to do um when John Glenn was uh sent into uh space he wasn't actually the first astronaut to go from America it was a man named Alan Shepard and then A Man Named Gus Grom went after and then it was John Glenn that went so Allen Shephard which is interesting here um his name uh Shepherd kind of fits right because here we are where brother brandom talks about astronaut age and we're going into space have has anybody heard that before we're in the astronaut age okay just making sure that some if you haven't uh we're going to kind of explain it really quick so yeah it's not a great picture but but it's the best one that I could find so uh you can put it down for just a minute um so brother brandom talks about uh in the message countdown uh and when he starts to be begin talking about astronauts and he said that um one of the things that happens with astronauts um is that they're taken well he he started to talk about astronauts and talking about the age that we're in and where he started at so in with the natural types the spiritual uh where we just read what he starts with is the horse and buggy and you know this is the amazing thing to me about the prophet right and we're and I'm going to show you kind of I I think it probably doesn't happen maybe so much here but I know Brothers back East that I've talked to they've faced a lot of folks really coming down on them about message things um and and I don't know how much it happens here it doesn't really happen to to me much thank god um hopefully it doesn't happen to you either but just kind of arguing and fighting about it so I'm going to take this natural thing and kind of show you how how amazing it was and some people would say it was just coincidence I don't think so but I'll let you be the judges of it so brother brandom talks about Transportation because he says the natural types the spiritual and that's you're always going to see that natural types the spiritual natural types of spiritual so when you're seeing the the destruction of a country and you're seeing the Fifth Dimension having its effect on the world you're seeing the natural but it's a spiritual happening and it's taking place in the natural where we're seeing it right so he talks about the horse and bug and he he says that's justification there was the power of the horse you're coming under justification and that that horse and buggy is something to get you going right it it it gets you somewhere it'll take you it's not necessarily the best way to travel it's not the fastest but he typed it and he said when the horse and buggy was there it was a type of justification and then as the horse and buggy moved on it became something called an automobile and a car um for those of you that know what automobile is but it became the car and the car had more horsepower and initially the cars didn't have a lot of horsepower but they in fact sometimes the horses were a lot faster than the cars but it was a step up because now it could go under a different power than that of the horse but it was still horsepower in fact when they talk about cars I have friends that have muscle cars and they like to talk about the horsepower in the car it's Greek to me cuz I don't necessarily understand all the horsepower stuff but it's pretty cool that it goes fast so but anyway it goes from that that horsepower to the automobile well now you got horses in an engine and then one day there's some guys called the Wright brothers and they build an airplane and that airplane takes man from the ground into the sky and brother brandom typed that with the the the releasing of the the the the gifts of the Spirit back in in the the early part of this well in the early 1900s and there was a a cross-eyed man named Seymour interesting name right Seymour but he saw more in the word than somebody else had seen before just like the Wright brothers saw more in in in the fact that you could take and and make an airplane and get off the ground so now they've seen this and they they break it into the natural but brother Brandon is saying look at that's a spiritual happening and then he goes on to say now we're in the astronaut age because man has taken and made a ship and used more horsepower now same power just more of it and launched people into space right and now they're no longer bound just by so before when it was horse and buggy or car you're bound by the ground right you're you're stuck in the ground once you get to the airplane you you have to stay within a certain elevation because once you get too far out there there's not enough air and you get out into space and you become too light and all those different things and there's a a vacuum of space that occurs and there's a lot of cold and there's a lot of special things but now man has went beyond even basically mostly the pole of gravity and I'm sure most of you have seen pictures where people float around you know they're they're in in something but they float around I don't know if you've ever seen photos of it but they float because they get out somewhere beyond so brother random is typing this and he's saying each one is a step right each one is a spiritual happening but you're seeing it in the natural so with that picture that you saw um of the the dragon carrying the Space Capsule there's something that's changed now something that's happened that hasn't happened before but I want to just really quick background with regard to John Glenn so John Glenn was by brother brandom he said he's the first person the first astronaut in America but again we know from history that he wasn't so why would brother random say that and if we can go back to that picture for just a second so we know from the word today and I have this down but we know from the word today that we're living in the days of Noah can we agree on that I think I think even people that aren't so much Believers kind of understand that hey there's something going on in the world there's something happening here so this picture that you see is John Glenn being fished out of the water so by the by the way back when these astronauts are set up sent up they're part of the Mercury program and Mercury if you go into the kind of different gods thing was known for being a God that transported people from basically uh Earth to other Realms so um and they're riding on an interestingly enough a Redstone Rocket so you know when you're going up in a Redstone Rocket to me that's just typifying in the spiritual sense of things how the blood of Christ is because these things are named for a certain way now this is brother Chris so you can take it how you want but this is just how brother Chris is looking at it so they they take off in this in the in a Redstone Rocket and they launch into space and when John Glenn comes back down he's he's sent into orbit he orbits the earth three times when he lands back down they think a heat shield on his little capsule Something's Happened and so when he comes back down to earth they're worried about the heat shield and so they've had to do some other things so he misses his Target and so this particular ship that picks him up is called the USS destroy excuse me USS Destroyer Noah NOA and it's named after of all things a person named love man Noah and when we go back in Genesis and we read about Noah the Bible tells us this Noah found Grace in the sight of the Lord and we think of that that or most people think of well God how horrible to destroy man but man was destroying himself right God loved man right and he he evidenced that through Noah right in addition to this you can go ahead and take it down again in addition to this particular happening when the first person that launched in face was a Russian named Yuri gagaran Noah we know was a farmer did we know that okay I'm making sure you're with me Yuri's name meant farmer guess where Yuri was born on a farm in Russia so all these things so you're it's amazing to me that here the prophet that the Lord revealed to the prophet to say hey here's something about this here's something about this particular thing thing that we need to know about we're now in the astronaut age we' we've we've had justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and now there's an an adoption and a change in what you can be and how you can live in Christ right so can you bring up the next slide please so it says he said salvation is of the Jew woman we know what we're talking about he said and I'll get to this in just a minut he said you worship you don't know what a Jew is supposed to know the word see what was supposed to be but see he was watching now why he's going to what he's going to do prove his word he said by the way go get your husband and come here and she said I don't have any husband so what brother brandom's talking about here um let's continue on go ahead and bring it up brother sorry he said you've told the truth see because you had five and the one you have now is not your hus usband watching something happen see something took life now if he hadn't have been there to begin with if she hadn't have had representation from predestination it had have never took hold so he's talking about the the woman at the well in this particular uh quote And for those of you I think most of us do we know that story am okay because I'm I'm not going to read it but I I do want to quote or talk about her so we know that uh from from the prophet that she was just a young woman had had five husbands and and the one that she was with at the time that when Jesus comes to her wasn't her husband but was the sixth person that she'd been with and from all intents and purposes in other words from every view that you could see she wasn't a candidate for much of anything in fact she had to go to the well by herself people didn't want to hang out with her there wasn't much that you could see but we find out that there was actually something that was in here that there was a representation there uh of something inside of her that was special and when Jesus said something to her and said hey that that guy's not your husband you know and and she's well he said you'll get your husband she said well I you know I don't have one he said well you said well you told the truth because that guy's not your husband and you know I appreciate what you're saying that you're telling the truth but there was something inside of her that was represented somewhere else so in her natural person there was a spiritual something represented somewhere else that could be touched by that I want to go back to the um to the the inspiration um spacecraft that was launched in 2021 so there were four people that were on this Craft um there was a man named Jared isaacman interesting that his name is Isaac man because he actually paid for the flight so he bought the seats for the three other people that went on the flight and was in this ship with them when they went so I I'm not going to mention the other people's names but the one of them had tried to be an astronaut was not taken as an astronaut and thought that she would never be an astronaut and ended up being chosen to go on this particular trip another one was chosen um because his he had put in for a particular contest that they had he wasn't successful in the contest but another man appeared to have been chosen and he ended up not being able to go because of a certain restriction so he gave that seat to his friend and the last one was a young woman who at the age of 10 got bone cancer and the bone cancer was in her femur so in her leg in the upper part of her leg and the bone cancer led to the fact that she had to go under chemotherapy and I don't know if you know what that is but it's medication that they put into people and it causes them to lose their hair no I'm not young and and female but I can imagine what it would be like for a 10-year-old to lose their hair and not just that but and and you sisters could probably imagine more than I but in in the natural course of things you're going to want to go to like a prom you're going to want to graduate from high school you want to do things with your friends and now she's under this particular thing of where she can't go and do anything because she's stuck in a hospital she's undergoing chemotherapy she's in a place called St judees and at 10 years old she has to do all these things they they're not sure if she's going to live or die she's undergoing all these treatments and so they eventually do a surgery after the chemotherapy and they put a prosthesis in her leg and the prosthesis is basically a femur so it's a big metal basically Rod they have to sew it into her so it's very limited what she's going to be able to do with her life there's not a lot that's going to happen for her there's not a lot of places that she's just going to be able to to do now she eventually builds strength back up she becomes a physician's assistant physician's assistant I think that's what she is and she works at the the St judee's hospital she she um the cancer goes into remission she doesn't have anything like that now this uh young lady has no Ambitions to go to space she has no idea that there is a contest going on she has no idea that that she would be a candidate for it she's not even thinking about it worrying about it talking about it nothing and then one day she gets a call and the call is from Mr isaacman among other people and he said to her I would like to take you to space would you like to go and I thought you know that's such an interesting thing but what she didn't know was she had on the St Jude's staff representation because St Jude's was told we need you to pick somebody to go so she had somebody who went through all these different files or whatever and said you know what you're going to be the person that goes to space so what an amazing thing for a young woman who could have died when she was 10 with cancer could have not been able to to get where she was then but all of a sudden she becomes this person that has representation that allows to do something that very few humans have done a little over 600 so far they say have been shot into space so it's not a large group and this young woman though because of that representation she's able to take a a trip and see the world that that so few people see and take go onto a place where so few people are able to to be a part of that particular group and experience something that so few were able to do and I thought from that particular thing of that woman at the well you know here's a woman here's a woman that nobody thinks could possibly be anything at all in her life people don't want to hang around her they don't want to be near her they they they don't want to talk to her she has to go to to get water by herself because of whatever is happened in her past but God saw something different amen and he had representation for her and and and just in his thought in his thinking he thought this woman is going to recognize me one day when I come walking up to her at the well because there was representation in her to do so amen there was something inside of her saying you know you know I've done a lot of things right I I I've done a lot of bad things I you know I can't keep a man whatever and and like I said brother R said she was a young woman she wasn't like you know 70 years old and had six husbands or five husbands she was a young young woman so she she was like a Hollywood type woman like you know you have a husband and then a year later you got a new one and then you know maybe six months to a year later you got another one and I don't know how they do it uh I I don't know how they you know I don't know it's an amazing thing but that was that was that woman is here she is is she's in that particular State and yet God has a different plan because he's representing her in his thoughts already so there's an attribute of God that he places down in her to see something different and we could you know we can take so many characters from The Bible and we have the same thing you have Gideon who's hiding and by a wine press right he's he's he's ducking for cover doesn't want anybody to know him and the angel of the Lord comes and says hey you're a mighty man of Valor I was like I'm hiding by The Wine Press I don't know what you're talking about that's not me I'm I'm doing something different down here I'm hanging out in in you know a place that I don't want anybody to know that I'm here but yet he had representation somewhere else so the angel of the Lord wasn't lying when he came and said you're a mighty man of Valor though Gideon in his mind wasn't thinking that he wasn't accepting it he didn't at first but eventually right eventually the words keep coming and eventually the the the things keep saying to him and pretty soon he's like I am I am this but it was because he had representation to begin with that was already there and you know this this kind of brings me to to an interesting point you know we have a five-fold Ministry I know some people don't like it but we still have it here so uh it's okay um but we have a five-fold Ministry and we have that Ministry for a reason because you might have Aaron get upset brother Aaron get up and say something and maybe 99% of everybody catches what he's saying but there's always one that needs somebody else to say it and and let me give you an example when I was a young person uh a long time ago uh my uh uh one of my relatives uh was the first one that well sorry the second one that actually came to the Lord um I was raised Roman Catholic by the way so just to give you a background and um he had come to the Lord and he was he was a very uh zealous person and uh uh very smart and and a good speaker and um all those things but it was real interesting because I I came to the Lord several years after he did gave my heart to the Lord and he would go and talk to people and he would say you know whatever he was witnessing or testifying or it didn't even have to be about you know Church it could have been about just anything and he would say something to him and they just never really got it and then I'd come and I didn't know what I was saying hardly and I'd say something and just because my Approach was different saying the exact same thing but with a different approach they would receive it and he's like this how does this work like how is it that I can say this to somebody now that wasn't everybody because there were other people that he would reach just fine and I wouldn't be able to do it but because there is something in there it doesn't mean that the first time that you hear something you're necessarily going to catch it right you might hear it from 20 different people but there's a representation somewhere that makes you able to receive it when the time for you to receive it arrives there's a way that you're going to receive the word of God no matter what when that time arrives for you because there's a representation somewhere that's making sure that you're going to going to dive into that or or or step into that particular thing there's no way that you're going to miss it because God has an attribute and that's his thought from the beginning of the foundations of the world to say brother sister when the time is right someone's going to get up and say something or somebody's going to come by your job somebody's going to happen by the Circle K or wherever it is that you get your soda I don't know but something is going to happen somewhere and you're going to catch that thing we're living in an astronaut age and you're all meant to be astronauts do you know that now you're probably not going to get to fly on a dragon X Space Capsule and you probably won't get to meet Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos and his new Shepherd spacecraft or one of those people you probably won't get to do those things but at the same time you're going to get to go something beyond that spiritually you'll be so far beyond that now brother brandom said that you're going to go by the moon so fast you won't even see it that's pretty fast that's pretty impressive you know right now they they have a power and and in fact I'm sorry I didn't put it in the slide presentation but they uh one of the Rockets actually more than one um when they started writing about uh the astronauts and that that some of the writers would say they rode into space on a pillar of fire and in fact NASA even has a picture of it where they have the space shuttle Columbia and it's taking off and they have this big thing of fire behind it and it says they they're riding on the it says right in their thing Pillar of Fire so I just find it so fascinating that that you know Satan tries to do everything with man and tries to work out all these things and yet God just keeps working to say hey I have kind of hidden this for you amen but take a look over here because something's fixing to happen now in the scripture we know that there was a wedding supper right and in that wedding supper there's an invitation made and the people that are invited not everybody can come people just say sorry I can't make it right so then the the the invitation from the wedding supper moves on and says well listen go in and invite those people in the highways and edges let's see if they can make it right actually it's the lame the Halt and and the MIM that get invited and then those in the highways and hedges so we see not a change in dispensation but a change in management because that wedding the wedding hasn't changed the supper is still the same The Wedding Planner is still the same the location is still the same what they're going to dine on is still the same everything is still the same about the wedding but what's changed is the way that they're managing who is coming to the wedding right that the the the the robes that they're going to be handed out all the same nothing's changing on that wedding but the management has changed and that's what's in my opinion right now happening today something has changed now I'm not a prophet I'm not going to tell you I don't know what that thing is but I know this much if God went out of his way to tell a prophet to pay attention to astronaut age and said listen your astronauts he said we're in the eagle age and then he equated it to the astronaut age right we know what we're feeding on we're feeding on the true word of God we know that that word is going to take us to somewhere somewhere greater than what this is right now and you have a representation somewhere that says you're going to make it amen and you can read in the word and and when we identify in the word there's a bride that's going to be without spot or wrinkle do you know that there's there's a representation in you to say Amen to that word and not just say Amen to it but that it becomes a part of what you are when brother bradam originally preached the countdown he was preaching three different messages and and he he kind of had it in a group and he was talking uh on the first one he was um got I have to remember where he was at he was talking about um in his presence was the last one and then it was the countdown oh present stage of my Ministry so present stage of my Ministry he was doing a teaching and he said present stage of my Ministry this is what's happening everybody's separating from me right just like he talked about Deus when Deus separated from Paul and he went in and he was talking about how you know a brother wanted to go up and hit Deus when he got to Heaven he said like I don't know that you're going to do that but I'm not sure if we're going to be hitting people over there but you know but he understood why he was he was frustrated that Deus had left Paul and he was saying in my ministry right now this is what's happening people are going to leave because I'm sticking with a particular word and I'm going to continue with that word and he talked about how when it was The Healing Ministry how everybody came right right and and you know for the gifts and when the discernment and everybody was excited but when it started to say you need to to stick with the whole Bible when it started to say that look it you this is this is how God is revealing himself in this day Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change everything else changes God doesn't change right and so he's pointing out in this particular thing that there's going to be persecution the closer you get to fulfilling that word the closer so the closer he got to accomplishing what he was sent here to do there was a separation that started to happen so I just want to say Saints don't be surprised by the separation right because that's what we learned from there and then after he he preached that he went into the countdown and he said he wanted to do something prophetic So Pro prophetic means future right means forward thinking it's it's something that's going to happen so he said we're in the astronaut age now but he was pointing also to a future time a future thing that was was going to take place and I believe that he left that for us to show us just by those things that I'm talking about this even evening that that future time is upon you because you're seeing in that in that countdown message where he showed those different steps from horse and buggy to car to airplane to to astronaut where we're living at but there was a huge to me this is a huge change a huge change in the natural in fact just so you know even in the natural they're recognizing that particular change because they're saying that for the past six decades basically the way the astronaut program has worked is it's either been nation states or you know particular countries things like that and they handpick their astronauts right when when the astronaut program started you had to be under 40 years old you had to be so I was out already I'm out of there some of you are still good you're still hanging in there you had to be a man you had to have a bachelor's degree or you had to at least to have the equivalent of a bachelor's degree you had to be a test pilot you had to endure incredible physical uh tests they would have them like blow into tubes and see who could blow the longest they'd Splash them into water they'd put them in a spinner and spin them around like crazy I don't know what the name of it is maybe Michael knows but I I don't know what it is but anyway theyd put him in there and they'd spin him around until they were you know as sick as could possibly be they had all kinds of physical tests for them if you weren't the cream of the if you weren't the best of the best you were not going to be an astronaut there was no way that you were going to be in this program so now we come to 2021 and you got a A guy who has a a basically a business where he processes payments and becomes a billionaire amazing how many people become billionaires doing things nowadays and he chooses a person that's been a rejected astronaut a a person that wasn't even going to be there because their their their friend won but couldn't go kind of like the you know the ones that said hey I can't go sorry you know you're going to have to go get somebody else and then they start searching you know in the highways and hedges and then you have one that ends up going on this trip that is damaged physically is not going to be able to run like those astronauts ran is not going to be able to go and do the test that the astronauts did in fact kind of like Jacob and Israel has a little bit of a walk that's funny because something has happened to her in her life and you would say and and she's got a scar I'm sure I I I I don't know how big or how long or whatever I haven't seen the SCAR or pictures but knowing surgery uh it's probably as long as her her thigh is because they had to cut it and take that whole bone out and put something back into place and they had to to fix that particular flaw but yet in her flaws in all those things that she had just like the woman at the well in those flaws yet there was somebody representing her saying listen you can do this this is something that's possible for you amen and there was an attribute there now St Jude just so you know St Jude is the the the uh patron saint of impossible causes amazing I I the the types are just amazing but we know this with God there's nothing right nothing is impossible am nothing at all when he comes to the Virgin Mary he starts talking to her and he's and he's saying look it you're you're you're you're going to conceive a son it's going to be Jesus that's what you're going to call him these are the things he's going to do he's going to save his people from his sins and by the way your cousin Elizabeth is six months pregnant with with the Forerunner to your baby and it's like yeah but see with God nothing's impossible am everything is possible so the scars that this young woman had the struggles that she had as a young person losing her hair and having to undergo these treatments I'm sure that you know I get made fun of I'm bald and the guy in Old so you can imagine that a young girl that's you know 10 and loses her hair kids tend to not be that that nice at least they weren't when I was in school I don't know maybe maybe they're different now and I'm not talking about you kids but I'm talking about kids in general right because I'm sure you kids are are awesomely nice right you got to say Amen come on you got to you got to throw it out there say Amen but she didn't have those things and I I I just want to bring this down to the point for you all that in in the course of your life God has forethought everything that's going to happen for you not only has he forethought it he's written it in a Bible because you have to start seeing yourself in the pages of this word when when you when you read the message you have to start seeing yourself in the pages of that message because those thoughts you know God brother brandom said God doesn't have to do anything he doesn't have to heal people he doesn't have to save people he doesn't doesn't have to make himself known he doesn't have to do anything but do you know why he does it according to brother brandham he does it because he wrote it because he said this is what I'm going to do so he put it in his word and he said this is what I'm going to do so he doesn't have to do it right but he wants to do it and he wanted to do it so much that he thought about it and then he said you know I'm not just going to think about it I'm going to put it down on paper I'm going to put it down so that people can read about it I'm going to put it on tapes so people can hear about it I even I'm going to even make some videos so people can see it for themselves right years after the occurrence has happened you can see those things so Jesus Christ is able to take somebody because you've got some kind of representation inside of you so it doesn't matter the scar and and and you know we're talking about a physical scar with this young lady but I want you to put this in the spiritual sense okay because there's a lot of people that are scarred scenes in fact I I would venture to say if you're you're you're old enough to understand what I'm saying you've probably got some scars not physical ones necessarily although you could but emotional ones and they they tie people down they hold them back right you know what's amazing to me is we have a a problem as humans when someone has a cancer like this this young lady did we're we're pretty good about it right we feel bad for them we we you know want the best for them we we give them gifts we you know when they lose their hair or they have to go under these treatments we we want to do something but when a person has a mental illness we're not so good at that right right it's still a Cancer and it's still a demon and it's still a sickness and God still heals it good right it's still something that can be overcome it's still something that that Jesus Christ has made a way and he's written in his word a Deliverance for everyone you know when when he went to the the man of gadera that wasn't a guy that people wanted to be around right he wasn't dressed well right he's out there running around and his all together and he's very mean right he had a mental illness right right he had a cancer of the Mind basically if you want to say it that he had a brain cancer even a cancer of the heart maybe at least for that time but yet there was a representation somewhere and Christ went to him not worried about what he could do not worried about what what he' done not worried about where he was going not worried about those things what he was worried about was that Soul because there was something in there there was an attribute there was a representation somewhere and he had to go to him and deliver him from that particular thing and saints of God if there's anything that I could bring to you tonight is this is that you've got a representation for every scar that you've got and regardless of the scars that you have that representation is able to overcome those things and it's able to put you into the eagle age or in other words the astronaut age did you know that you were created to be an astronaut you're created to be a spiritual astronaut and you've got a representation somewhere that says you're absolutely able to do this you know that Pillar of Fire that I talked about so they have a picture can you go back to the very first slide make sure we're doing okay on time we're doing okay on time I think so um so you see that this is the that Rocket taking off with those four citizens in it that's a picture from um NASA of the particular um ship going up so you can see where they say it looks like a pillar of fire right in other pictures when you see when you see a rocket take off it's a pillar of fire and in that thing where we showed that red dragon you notice that the red dragon was giving it its power right it was pushing it from the back but the reality is for us as Believers yeah we've got a pillar of fire that that sometimes s pushes us but the awesome thing is it also pulls us right just like a magnet like brother random said you had that magnet that was passing over and that iron is drawn to it because it's pulling all the time and right now it's pulling you closer to a body change the Rapture right now we we like to think that it's off somewhere it's not off anywhere it's working right now it's already pulling on you kind of like if you take a magnet you ever take magnets now if you flip it one way it it pushes against right you can't get it to come any closer but sometimes you just got to change the direction of the magnet and sometimes that's what needs to happen in our lives because all you got to do is change the direction of the magnet and as it starts getting closer to that other big magnet Bo CU one day there you know you get closer and it's kind of hanging in there and it's kind of hanging in there and that's drawing all the time but when you get it too close what happens bam and that's the same thing that's going to happen to the bride of Christ it's you're you're being drawn you're being pushed you're being pulled and at the same time he's his presence is living in you so you don't just have the push of a pillar of Fire or the draw of a pillar of fire but you've got the pillar of fire inside right that connects you that's your representation to connect you back to the word that was spoken about you from the very beginning yes sir that's the thing that's and and and it's pulling and it's pushing and it's living and it's breathing and it's drawing drawing you somewhere else into a a deeper depth and a higher height with Christ it's moving you in such a direction and that pull doesn't stop Saints amen now when I first started thinking about these things one of the problems that we have is humans and I'm going to close in just a moment one of the problems that we have as humans is changes really hard right right I work with firefighters thankfully the firefighter that I work with isn't here so I can throw this out there and not get in trouble but they love to say we want change so we want change we need change change has to happen change has to and there's a challenge with change right there's always a challenge with it because it's a hard thing to do so guess what we we we hired a a deputy chief they said we need new blood we got to have a new person so we hire this new person and the new person starts to make changes and guess what they say that's not the way we do it right we don't do it that way and then they start to complain because things are changing isn't that that's human nature right we start to I hate this change change me change me oh I hate it don't change me don't don't change anything we're doing here I just want to keep everything exactly the same right but the Lord knows how to change and if we're like that magnet and we're the wrong direction and repelling all we got to do is do 180 and you do that flip 180 and you're going to be drawn right to it because you've got a representation somewhere Saints you're an astronaut a god astronaut a star sailor right that's an awesome thing why don't you stand with me if you can go to the last slide I think so brother brandom is saying this in the countdown he says may they rise from their Shackled down sickness to go out yonder in outer space where doctors science none of them knows anything about where the power of God is Promised by scientific research of the Bible here where he says or spiritual research rather of the Bible to show that God ever was he still be God and he is the infinite omnipotent Almighty omnipresent being that can keep his word and can do all things and promis us all things are possible to them that will believe God grant it amen so I think that should be our prayer God grant that amen because we can realize he's infinite omnipotent Almighty omnipresent he keeps his word and your representation is in that word Jesus Christ the word is your representation today as the bride of Christ we're representing him right on Earth we we've heard it said many times will be the final voice to the final age but that's the truth because when you have that Pillar of Fire behind you and in front of you just like they did when they were marching out of uh of Egypt and now living inside of you you can't help but be that you can't help but be a representative of that person so you can't help but be a representative of Jesus Christ on this Earth and as that representative you know what you can do you can intercede for others you can step in into the gap for others and make a difference in somebody else's life along with at the same time being that one that has the faith to receive the body change that that we talk about all the time we talk about it a lot but we have to realize we've got a representation and that representation is that X Factor that we need that representation is is the one that that is going to take you and give you power like Elijah had that he could go in the strength of what he was feeding on the word but that meat that he had he could go in that strength for so many days I'm not recommending that you do that by the way but you can go in that strength for so long because you've got that representation and it holds you and it lives in you and it's omnipresent and it's omnipotent it you know what the the awesome thing is it can overcome me and brother sister if it can overcome me it can overcome from you amen and we need to to think of that for each other don't don't be a counter that would be my advice don't start counting good just stay away from it because it's not safe what is safe is the word and and the word said whosoever will and I believe it whosoever will and and the word said just believe that you're the one okay I'm the one if there is one if there's a million wonderful I think there's going to be more than what natural man has done right I think there's more than 600 so I'll throw that number out there how's that CU I don't think God's going to be outdone by man he hasn't been outdone by man before uh we like to think that we we can outdo it you know that part of the space program is their thought was hey let's get to Mars so in case something bad happens on Earth well they tried that program before and Genesis if you'll remember and and that's when the language got confounded the awesome thing was God confounded the language then but when he reintroduced himself in the in the in the baptism of the Holy Ghost guess what he did everybody could speak and understand the same language amen we can all do that through the word of God today amen I I hope that's been encouraging to you I just want to encourage you today you've got a representation you've got an X Factor Beyond uh beyond anything that right now you could think or imagine because that's what the word teaches us right that's beyond anything we can think or imagine and I don't know about you all but I can imagine some pretty impressive things kids I'll bet you guys can imagine better stuff than me right that's kind of what kids do right they have fantastic imaginations you know one of the last things I want to leave you with just just as a thought when you are looking at different things so let's say that you're out walking on a beach has anybody walked on a beach put your hands up this is audience participation time okay ever walked in sand maybe not on a beach okay so everybody's at least walked in sand okay so how many of you have ever looked at the sand and said you know what I see in the sand I see a silicon chip that can power a cell phone that can power your refrigerator now your car I see computers I see all these different things have you ever looked at metal and went wow that that's a plane right there that's that's a that's a that's a spaceship I see it in my mind right there's all kinds of things you know that that God one day looked at dust and saw you right I mean how many of us look at dust and go yeah there there's no Emmy right right there just right put yourself there God looks at those things right we we we can look at these different things but we don't typically we don't do that but yet somebody does and that's what God does right you can walk on a beach and there's all that sand or whatever and I don't see well let's put it this way dinosaurs right they say dinosaurs made all the the oil reserves that we have how many of you have ever looked at a can of oil and went hey there's a toy right hey there's buttons for my shirt there's pretty much every Chinese thing that's ever been made right there cuz all the plastic right that's what it is so all those things are there they're they're just sitting all the time but we don't think about that because there's not in us maybe the representation that the person had that I don't know how they came up with if I take sand I can make glass and then eventually they came up with if I take sand I can do something to it and make it wayf for thin and create these things and make a lot of Oodles of money right I'm just walking on the beach thinking you know sand gets in some irritating places I I I love the water but Sand's not so great but but there's a representation there and there's something to draw and so Jesus Christ is that way you know maybe we don't see that dust becoming something but yet he does maybe we don't see the the sand of time becoming something in our lives but he does you know those Rocky places that that we find just tough to get over and tough he seen something that is makeable there he sees something that he can work on there something that be drawn out just like man is able to see all those things Thomas Edison could see a light bulb you know we enjoy him all the time I do anyways but you know here's a guy trying a thousand different kinds of elements to figure out how to get power so that we could see by it everybody else is like Mister you're there's something wrong with your head cuz who's going to want to try a thousand times to come up with something about three times in I'm I'm out maybe four it might last till four or five but people we can see in the natural if somebody is willing to put in that kind of effort to achieve something that's in their mind imagine the effort that God is willing and able and will put into you take it personally now what God is able and willing to put into you amen because you've got representation and he sees the end from the beginning Saints scars nothing don't matter God sees the end from the beginning amen why don't we just bow our heads for a word of prayer heavenly father we're a privileged people today to realize that you care for us in such a deep way Lord that father when when we didn't have a hope in the world yet there was a representative for us God there was a representation Lord that took our place there was a representation that that put things down on paper that we could rely on father that we could hang our our lives on that our souls could could though being weighed in the balance father we could be Lord not found wanting but Lord found receiving every good promise and every good gift from above God we thank you for the representation of Jesus Christ God we want to be in your presence Lord because we know when we're in your presence everything changes so every day we want to invite your Holy Spirit In Lord not just into the building not just into the home but into our hearts into our lives to to have control father because Lord You've made us to be that you've made us to be astronauts Lord you've made us to to live with the pillar of fire in the pillar of fire father God and Lord we just appreciate these lessons from the word that Lord can encourage our hearts that can just Lift us up father that that can make our souls to know that we can rest in you that you're omnipresent Lord you know all things father God you're all powerful everything can be done and accomplished and so father we just thank you again for your word today we thank you for this opportunity that we've had to gather together father we pray that it was pleasing to you Lord that we've come to worship you in in the best way that we know how and God if we're not doing it right then open up our understanding Lord to to to just make it a a better and a deeper worship father God and Lord we thank you for that rapturing Spirit that's in US Lord God we thank you that is drawing us Lord to that magnet Lord and as you come closer to us and we come closer we know that it'll just be so fast when we get so quick that we won't even see the moon as we go by God what a what an idea that is Lord we don't need jet fuel or rocket fuel or atomic energy we just need the power of God and that power of God will allow us to to to travel at a thought father and and see worlds that others have never seen God we just appreciate that today we just appreciate your presence and we thank you for your children we pray that you'd bless them in a special way Lord for we ask it in Jesus name amen God bless you
