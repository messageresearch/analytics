TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] amen i'm going to be reading from ecclesiastes chapter 2 and i have a little bit of a lengthy reading because i want to come back to some of the verses here later on and do so without necessarily needing to read them again so ecclesiastes chapter 2 verses 1 to 11. wow wonderful presence here tonight and a little bit different arrangement than what we were expecting um but i just feel that god's pleased with the hearts that have come and the openness we have to receive from him and uh we're gonna we're gonna have we're gonna let the lord have preeminence regardless of where we're gathered and so we're so happy that you've come tonight and you do so with such a a wonderful expectation that god can honor with this presence ecclesiastes chapter 2 verses 1 to 11 i said in my heart go to now i will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also as vanity i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what do with it i sought in my heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainting my heart with wisdom and to lay hold on folly till i might see what was that good for the sons of men which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life so he's giving us what he's what he's seeking what he's searching he's trying to figure certain things out and he says i made me great works i builded me houses i planted me vineyards i made me gardens and orchards and i planted trees in them of all kinds of fruits i made me pools of water to water there with with the wood that bringeth forth trees i got me servants and maidens and had servants born in my house and also i had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in jerusalem before me i gathered me also silver and gold and a peculiar treasure of kings of the provinces i get the men got me i got me men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and all that of sorts so i was great and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not from them i withheld not my heart from from any joy from my heart rejoiced in all my labor and this was my portion of all my labor then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labor that i had labored to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no prophet under the sun you may be seated i'm continuing on the subject of in the beginning and now it's complicated and we're not going to have i apologize in advance for lacking um scriptures and quotations but with the new setup tonight i wasn't exactly sure just how much we would have um in terms of time to set up and also whether or not you'd even be able to see a slideshow so i didn't want to put any extra pressure on the brothers tonight by having a real extravagant slideshow with animations and multi-colored only to be disappointed that we couldn't get it working so if you want the notes we can always email them to you provide them to you if you'd like to have them but continue on the subject uh the end of the beginning which is looking at uh how we've been examining the first three chapters of genesis and a little bit into chapter four and looking how in the beginning god created a family and now we're looking at how they're transitioning from the image that god gave in the beginning to the end of that and and then it be that's when it gets complicated and so we were looking at sunday on how in the beginning life was simple and in that way it was clear it was easily understood uh god had laid everything out in a particular order where you could see even the species having their place and and having their order and having their position we could see how that everything had a particular arrangement to it and this is god's way this is god setting things in place and arranging different things and it was just a beautiful in its simplicity yet we know there was a lot of layers to it very intricate creation and yet life for adam and the woman was simple and but the bible even says the man and his wife were naked and they were not ashamed it was a the man and his wife just conveys so much and we can draw on a lot of the things that we've ministered already before just to try to capture those things in our minds but they're living in the garden you could just sum it up this way there's the man and his wife living by the word and that was it that was just the most simple way that you could put it and it was definitely complex and incomp when you speak about complexity it's something that requires a particular skill or a level of understanding special knowledge or special understanding so it was definitely complex but it wasn't complicated life had a lot of different things to it a lot of challenges uh not challenges but things that they were to do and ways that they were told uh to manifest the word of god and in doing that it was a it was something that they were tasked with doing but it was easy it was clear to them they understood their roles they understood what they were supposed to do and yes we could say it was complex but it wasn't complicated and we say complicated confusing difficult hard hard to even relate what's taking place what's up or down and the will of god was clearly expressed and it was perfectly understood and we draw that from the message of the hour because brother branham tells us and teaches us they had perfect love they had the perfect understanding of the love of god so the will of god was straightforward and it was not misleading in any way the will of god though we read it now and in some of it's in symbolic form it wasn't a riddle to them as a matter of fact i would even make this point that when the woman is having a conversation with the serpent there's something that's written that is more in symbolic form and representative of what actually happened but the conversation that the woman in the serpent may have been having may have been completely different moses is inspired to write in a way where the trees are symbolic the fruit is symbolic but yet they had a more perfect understanding of what those symbols meant so to them it wasn't a riddle she wasn't told not to eat of a tree and she's trying to figure out well i don't really see a tree what tree what fruit is he talking about it wouldn't have been something that would have been this mystery to her that would have caused her to be confused or misunderstand so it wasn't a riddle to them and regardless of how complex life was they adam and the woman were simple towards the promise and that they believed god's word they took him at his word they were trusting to his word so they were very simple in that they just put their faith in the promise of god they put their faith in the commandment of god and god had made it simple and that's the beauty of it god is in simplicity and if any time the word is complicated that's not god's doing can we agree i would even go so far as to say that if i preach something that's from the word of god and it's complicated that's my fault not the word's fault because the word is not complicated the word is sim is simple it's straightforward it's clear and god had made it simple and so he took the burden of complexity off the man and his wife and said i will bear the burden of complexity this is just simply how you need to walk this is just simply how you need to go just trust in me advancing in the word of god i've already taken care of everything i've already sown the seeds i've already placed everything in the way that it needs to be and so life in the garden was complex it had a different it was a very expansive universe it was a vast creation there was very intricate creatures there was a great plan that was to be fulfilled so it was very life in the garden had some complexities to it but again it wasn't it was simple it was a complex life but yet there was simplicity to it and brother branham called it god's economy of innocence that means innocence is there's no corruption it's pure there's freedom from evil there's there's no wrong mixed in with it he calls it god's economy of innocence that's a very interesting phrase that he uses and the very word economy it just means household management and that's what the words mean the the greek word and even in the latin and even in the old english it speaks of household management the arrangement or mode of operation is kind of how it's evolved in the way it's used today or a system of interaction and exchange and so regardless of what definition you want to use it has a beautiful meaning when god says this is the brother man says it was god's economy of innocence that it was a household management was managed in innocence and simplicity it had an arrangement and mode of operation which was innocence the system of interaction and exchange was all based upon innocence and that's how god had ordered it and arranged it in the beginning in second corinthians chapter 11 verse 3 he says but i fearless by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety so so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ satan had defiled this their singleness of mind that they had this simple faith in god's word they were trusting to him they were believing in him and what paul is even pointing out is that the serpent through his subtlety corrupted her simple faith in the word of god her simple obedience in the word of god regardless of what the act was at its most basic level the most basic principle is that she violated the word of god she acted in disobedience with the commandments she had been given and she was given another way to view the world because paul says just as some come preach another jesus or another spirit comes or is another gospel so that's basically what the serpent brought is she had one way of viewing the world she had one way of living in the world she had one way of existing it was by the word of god it was faith in the word of god and satan was able just to add to it in such a way to where it complicated the promise it complicated her understanding of the promise and that was the way that the word was was forsaken and allowed sin to enter in and paul is saying lest that same thing that happened to the woman he fears that we could also be beguiled from our simplicity that is in christ and again it's not that we have faith in a simple christ because the word is the word is uh has great depth great breadth to it the height the depth the length everything there's a lot of there's a lot to the word of god but it was being simple towards it just say i believe it i believe all of it i take it for exactly what it is and for us we're we're not born into an age of innocence that was going to be my biggest amen of the night so um i'm just gonna i'm just gonna kind of buckle down and get through it but we are not born in an age of innocence that there you go all right i might try that more often but there it's it's a time which we all understand and are very very sensitive and aware that we live in an evil age in a dark age and it's not an economy of innocence but it's an economy of chaos and it's a confusion complication is the word that we're wanting to use just to refer to it how that complexity is something that requires special knowledge or understanding or skill and and but yet complicated something that even regardless of knowledge and skill it's like this thing doesn't even make sense it's not these things aren't even related they don't even connect and that's kind of the world that we're living in now it's a it's a world that's lost all sanity it's a world where common sense doesn't uh doesn't exist anymore where people have these great platitudes and they take these positions and these stances and they feel that they're doing it in the sense of justice and fairness and they don't realize that the ver their very justification for their position is the exact same thing on the other side that they become we're against tolerance so we're going to intolerate people who are intolerant and just that principle in itself says well how could you how could you be intolerant in defense of tolerance i just kind of throwing it out there you chew on a little bit how could you how could you there's just so many inconsistencies i won't get in it but there's just a lot of things that we look and say well this doesn't make sense that doesn't make sense it's the world we're living in now and brother branham said the great burden of this last age is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in this last age has a burden which is made up of pressure riches soft living and nervous tensions so we can say that this god's economy of innocence has been replaced by a complex age that even we whether he's talking about believers or just human beings we could say amen to it but especially believers we don't seem fit to live in such a godless society we don't seem fit to live in such a godless world and and satan's eating and all the horrible things that exist in this world it's just not it doesn't it doesn't thrill us it doesn't satisfy us and and the whole world seems to be uncomfortable in its existence that's the age that we're living in pressure rich is soft living and nervous tensions it's the anti-eden it's really the opposite of everything god did and if you could just take that principle and say whatever was in the beginning just take the opposite that's exactly what is now whatever god had accomplished whatever god had achieved everything was arranged it was all orderly there was male female this that and the other you just take the opposite now to where now there's not even male female now there's not order it's chaos it's confusion and that's the age that we're living it's the complete opposite of everything that god had arranged and established in the garden and this is my this is my thesis and this is my burden there's only one there's only one way to untangle all the confusion there's only one way to make sense of all the complications and that's the word of god and and this is impressed upon me even at this juncture and the things that we're looking at in terms of uh the family in relationships and principles that we can challenge ourselves by to be better brothers and sisters to each other within the family of god to be better husbands and to be better parents and to be better children even before we could even begin to speak on those principles i feel it is so necessary that we as a church are rooted and grounded in one thing and that's the word of god that our ambition and our aim isn't to try to figure out how to have the most dynamic song service or to try to figure out how we're going to be able to get the smoke machine in here and get all the lights to work and that's not our objective is to create a dynamic atmosphere through songs and through worship and things that kind of um scratch that itch of our flesh to enjoy a church service and maybe some some shouting and some dancing and maybe some of the chairs getting knocked over or whatever that's not what we want to be rooted and grounded in we want to be rooted and grounded in the word and it's when the word has preeminence that gifts can be manifest and healings can take place and we have the proper balance to see that those things are furthering us in our faith instead of holding us back and i believe it's absolutely imperative that we understand that our foundation and the basis upon which we are living is upon the word of god and that what we preach what we believe and the things that we live are things that come from the word of god because christ alone is the answer to the chaos the only way we're going to be able to untangle this ball this uh all this confusion the knots that are in our stomach the what we don't know about the future we're all worried about our past the only way any of that's going to make sense is through the word of god and as we mentioned it on sunday to comprehend the complications of this life i'm wanting to look at the beginning and i'm looking at the beginning draw this contrast for the way things were to the way things are now and in genesis chapter 2 i'm going to read three places in genesis 2. i'm going to read from genesis 3 and then and then we're going to take a step further in this but notice how god establishes the man in the beginning and this is important just to to kind of finish up the contrast as we were looking at it last week it says the lord god planted a garden eastward in 80 in eden genesis chapter 2 verse 8. i apologize if i seem a little nervous tonight and i'm going too fast i'll learn to slow down eventually and says the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed so eden means pleasure eden means delight and this is no doubt a garden of pleasure to the lord but it is a garden of pleasure for the man that when god planted the garden eastward and even before even man was created god provided for him and we realized that this is exactly what brother branham teaches us about the future home and things that are to be that god knows you like this and god knows you like that and knowing that one day you're going to be in that land he's already preparing it to suit you that's how our heavenly father works so when god created in the beginning this garden of eden this garden of pleasure it wasn't just god's delight but it would be to man's delight he knew how he was going to make the man he's like this is going to make adam so happy he's going to love these trees he's going to love these fruits he's going to love these mountains he's going to love these rivers he's going to love everything about this creation and so adam identified first with all creation that this was something delightful or pleasing it was a place of pleasure for the man and then it says in verse 15 and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it so now not only is it a place of pleasure but it's a garden of labor it's a garden of work now i know you probably wince a little bit and go oh that doesn't make any sense but work was different then it had a completely different meaning to it and it's very hard for us to comprehend how that work and it wasn't a j-o-b if i could put it that way it was labor it was work but to him it wasn't a burden it wasn't a task it wasn't chores like oh i've got to take out the trash or oh my goodness i washed the dishes last week yeah it's a new week right i've already done that i've done this it wouldn't have been this cycle of every day the same old thing but he was put in the garden to labor to dress and to keep it and this did not diminish the pleasure of the garden if anything it amplified it this is a place that he loved and now he would have responsibility over and he would dress it and keep it and in verse 20 verse 19 and 20 god says that he brought all the animals unto adam to see what he would name and what he would call him and it says that adam gave names to all the cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field so adam's labor was fruitful his labor invoked the exercise of distinction he had to he had to use his knowledge and his wisdom to name the creatures he had to his dominion required wisdom and so adam's existence in the garden was one of pleasure it was also one of labor but it was one in which he exercised knowledge he was exercising his gifts it was a very full life a very fulfilling life and his dwelling the entire domain the entire world was one of pleasure and the labor that he undertook was pleasant to him it was pleasing now again i realize that probably we really can't quite relate to that because our enjoyment comes on a pay period right every two weeks we get a paycheck or every week or whatever it is we get paid and in that one moment of that satisfaction of having that direct deposit hit we feel like okay well maybe it was worth it i'll give it another two weeks but adam just loved it work and labor and everything he was doing having dominion and subduing and naming and everything that he would have to do was all was pleasant and satisfying to him it was a garden of pleasure it was a garden of labor it was a garden of of exercising all of his gifts it was a beautiful beautiful thing but in genesis chapter 3 verses 16 to 19 and i will just read to verse 17 actually for time's sake and just amplify a couple words in this when it comes after the fall now it says unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and then it says to adam in verse 17 because he has eaten of the tree it says thou shalt not eat of the ground it is cursed cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life and what is he going to describe thorns and thistles this ground is going to bear unto you in the sweat of thy face in verse 19 you're going to have to labor and work to eat bread and then it says and they're going to go back to the dust this is this this dynamic now that adam is working within is completely incongruent with what he was originally doing god is basically saying that in the beginning if we could put it this way in the beginning you're going to work you're going to have you're going to have dominion you're going to have to subdue you're going to labor but everything's going to be pleasant to you it's going to be pleasing there's going to be a great reward it's going to come easy because the way that you're gifted it's going to happen because of the seeds are already sown and god's presence has dominion and you're in the image of god and everything is just clicking and working harmoniously and now he's wanting him to understand it's going to be different now so he tells the woman it's going to be sorrow it's going and this sorrow even the the language that is used of sorrow the very thing is pain or labor or hard hardship it's going to be a vexation is the word that you use it's going to be torture and we can say amen because that's what work is now and he's telling them that now work is no longer going to be as fulfilling as it was before because now you're going to struggle you're going to labor and you're going to work because you need to eat bread to live but this labor is going to is going to be frustrating because you're going to plant seeds and expect those seeds to come up and bear to you fruit but guess what thorns and thistles are also going to come up and they're going to compete with that seed for the light and for the water and for the nutrients and it's not just going to be as easy as you knew it before again if we could if we could say this that the words that we read convey the things that we need to to begin to understand what was happening in this moment but let's just say that god by speaking to adam was giving him a full understanding of how different the reality would be in all the ways that maybe we can't understand that's being conveyed in these very verses adam was realizing this is going to be different now that's going to be different everything is turned on its head there's so many things that were taking place in that moment the thorns and thistles the sweat of his brow going back to the dust everything had been turned on its head and so this is man's departure from the the pleasure this is man's departure from the pleasant labor and now it's an entrance into a struggle it's entrance into confusion that every man entered into from that point on nobody's had the the horror of the transition that adam and the woman had to go from a perfect eden into absolute chaos because every man from that point on has been born into the chaos they don't know the transition but we do know the transition from being unregenerate from being sinful to being confused to being broken to being depressed to being sick to having god come in his word transform our lives into new creatures and all of a sudden everything that was chaotic everything that was hurtful everything that was bringing us down something changes and becoming a new creature in christ we experience a transition out of the confusion and chaos into a glorious light and i thank god that we can have that transition because it's a beautiful transition it's a glorious transition and so the issues of life became complicated work was full of trouble it was un fruit was unpredictable there was no way to anticipate what would be maybe there just even and how adam would begin to to wrestle with the earth and he said well i think this is going to work and then it wouldn't work and i think that maybe this will work and it wouldn't work it was not it wasn't it wasn't uh it wasn't the life that he lived before though it was complex it wasn't complicated now life was a trouble life was a burden life was a struggle in one that in the struggle all he could look forward to was a grave could you imagine that this is and this is how all man has lived for thousands of years we're going to work and then we're going to die so when we i want to turn if you could to ecclesiastes chapter one and i kind of arranged this so that we could go through it chronologically in these verses until we'll skip back a little bit at the end but i'm going to start with chapter one and i just want to read through um the book of ecclesiastes just some key parts i'm not going to read the whole thing so i don't want you to get too nervous really i wouldn't want you to get nervous at all but if you're just prone to it don't get too nervous we're just going to read little snippets and several chapters because this book and i'm sure most of you are familiar with it it is it is so it's an excellent summary of the vanity of life it's an excellent summary of the complications of life and the confusions of life and there's a way that you can read it that that speaks to the spiritual type and how there's certain things that are natural but then there's a spiritual side to it and there's things that you could see that approaches it from the angle this is what a foolish man does this is what a wise man does but i want you to look at from the viewpoint of the one who speaks here in the very beginning that this is him who's the wisest of all looking at all of life so he's a wise man and he's giving his assessment his conclusion about the life that you're living now so when i read it let's not go back thousands of years to the days of solomon or back to the old testament think of how they walked around with leather sandals and they wore robes and they had donkeys pulling carts think about where you're living right now and make the application of the language that's being used and it still 100 diagnoses the human existence it summarizes the human existence i'm not talking about the believer's existence in christ because that hadn't been opened up yet and that contrast is definitely being pointed to but initially before we even come um to emphasize the other side to that ponder for a moment how the things he's saying here perfectly describes our natural existence in our natural life it says in ecclesiastes chapter one verse one the words of the preacher will read to verse three the son of david king in jerusalem they believe that this is to be solomon so when he referred to the book of ecclesiastes you could say this is solomon you could say this the preacher but he says vanity of vanities saith the preacher vanity of vanities this is uh this is kind of akin to this is emphasis you have the holy of holies here this would be the opposite the vanity of vanities if that's the most if the holy of holies is the most holy place you can't get any holier he's trying to use this as infinite emphasis this is the vanity of vanities vanity of vanities all is vanity uh what now preacher what is vanity all is vanity well what about this vanity well what about that vanity what about this vanity he's saying all his vanity what prophet hath the man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun all is vanity it's futile it's meaningless that's what the word means the meaning is it's chasing the wind what's gonna happen if you chase the wind nothing you're gonna get tired and there's there's no there's nothing there's nothing to catch there's nothing to harness if you chase it that's what's being thought here it's futile it's meaningless and it it's he says all is vanity it's not in and remember he's not describing it as it was in its original condition he's describing it in its present condition he's not describing the beginning he's describing after the end of the beginning he's describing his existence at the time and it applies today so he's not describing the original arrangement he's not describing heaven he's not describing the word of god he's describing the human life he's saying all is vanity as the bible says in romans 8 20 for the creature was made subject to vanity all creation was made subject to vanity all creatures were made subject to vanity mankind became subject to vanity he says vanity of vanities vanity of vanities all his vanity and he asked this question what prophet hath the man of all his labor which he taketh and this phrase under the sun it means all of life what does man really gain from all his work in this life what a question the wisest man in the world is asking this question what does a man get out of it everything he labors to do everything he tries to do everything he accumulates and the people he meets and the relationships he has he said at the end of the day what have we gotten out of it what does a man really gain from everything under the sun everything that is in life and so really the whole book examines this question what what is there a prophet to this is there anything that's beneficial is there anything we can take from this is there anything that takes away the vanity and that's the question he begins to examine now i'm going to skip across a lot of really really good scriptures but just try to find some real impactful condensed statements that this preacher makes to drive this point home verse 13 and i gave my heart to seek and search out wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven so now we understand that this is his focus to this book i have searched out wisdom and i've sought these things out concerning everything under the sun because my promise is or my problem is this that man works and he labors and he doesn't get anything out of it so i want to look at this a little bit more i want to understand everything is vanity so i really want to dig into this to figure out am i seeing this wrong why is it vanity what's happening so he's kind of setting us up for what he begins to say and he says concerning all things that are under the heaven this sore travail hath god given to the sons of man to be exercised there with where did this sword travail come come from where did this sorrowful labor where did this burdensome um work come from from the when the beginning ended genesis chapter three i want to seek out and search out wisdom concerning this sword travail that god has placed upon the sons of man that man is exercised with he labors and he struggles with the things that he exists within i want to search it out and understand what's taking place verse 14 i have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit vanity means empty it's a vapor you can't grab it it's just a mist and vexation it speaks of a striving or longing in other words there's no satisfaction or fulfillment you keep striving you keep longing it's like having a hunger pain but you can't quite satisfy it and and maybe that's a good maybe a good example to use as there's times when we're really really hungry and we actually eat and what and what happens it doesn't hit the spot and we're left dissatisfied we're like man i i actually feel like i want to eat something else or eat something different even though you might be full you still feel like that i'm left completely unsatisfied i may physically have a full belly but there's some part of me that hasn't been satisfied and has and it hasn't been quenched do i mention food a lot i might need to eat more before i preach but it's a striving or a long and there's no contentment or satisfaction that comes with the labor says all is vanity not just vanity where it's empty but it also this is incredible the emptiness vexes me there's such a power to the the emptiness it's a vexation it's a torture it'd be one thing if there's something there was some substance would be another thing if there was nothing to it and we're just like oh well there's nothing but even the emptiness has a force and a way to leave us dissatisfied discontent and unhappy and now look at this this is incredible he says that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numbered he begins to point out the inconsistencies the anomalies we can't account for like here i am the wisest man in the world and and and i'm looking out and mankind has had these a few thousand years of existence four thousand years at least of existence and we've done roughly they've had all this time together and yet they can't account for certain things they can't figure certain things out things are inconsistent things don't seem to fit the very words that are used speak of defects there's defects and deficiencies we can't solve or fix all the works of man that he's exercised in or vanity and vexation because that which is crooked cannot be made straight that which is wanting cannot be numbered the incompleteness can never be remedied man has a need he has a longing there's things that he tries to accomplish things that he tries to do but that incompleteness can never be satisfied the deficiencies are too numerous to resolve the wanting cannot even be numbered the crooked things cannot be made straight and realize that what he's talking about there it speaks of things that don't make sense things that aren't level not even the natural things but the things that they cannot seem to make sense of the things that seem incongruent contradictions maybe is a good word of thinking about it the these are things that man wrestles with and tries to figure out the paradoxes those are the things he's wanting us to ponder and begin to think about and remember that meaning when you read about john the baptist and the coming of the messiah when it speaks about the crooked being made straight and things being leveled out it's the resolution to man's paradox it's the resolution to man's struggle it's the resolution demands confusion and so now if you look at chapter two in ecclesiastes chapter two in the several verses that we read at the beginning solomon again begins to describe his efforts to satisfy himself and and to give life fulfilling purpose because he's kind of set us up in chapter one saying the sword travail that man is exercising it's all vanity it's vexation of spirit these things that seem incongruent inconsistent all these contradictions how can we make sense of it so now chapter two is almost uh solomon's attempt to try to make sense or find the prophet the benefit he's trying to find the wisdom he's trying to he's trying to prove that he can be happy and find mirth and he says i said in my heart go to now i will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this is also vanity i'm just going to make myself happy as much as i can i'm going to really make joy the principal thing and my physical sensation of being happy and being fulfilled and making this flesh feel sensi uh sensitized he says i'm going to do that i'm going to enjoy pleasure but this was vanity and in verses 2 to 8 let me summarize it to you this way he begins to say i enjoyed wine he found intoxicating substances he built houses he planted vent gardens he he planted vineyards he planted orchards he planted trees of all various kinds of fruit he made pools he obtained servants and maidens he had great possessions of cattle he gathered silver gold unique treasures he had the best antique collection then he got singers and musical instruments he had entertainers i mean he's really destroyed describing the life so he has wine he built a nice house the house had a garden the house didn't have just a garden it had a vineyard it did just have a vineyard that had an orchard and it didn't just have one tree in the orchard had many different trees of many different fruits and it also had a swimming pool he had pools and not only did he have this house he had to keep track of the vineyard and he had to keep track of the pool and he had to keep track of the house no he had servants to do that he had maidens he had great possessions of not just orchards with trees of fruit but now he was a cattleman he had all cattle that exceeded anything that anybody had in jerusalem and then he gathered silver and gold and peculiar treasures from all different kingdoms and so the house was just arrayed beautifully and then to top it all off he had the best entertainment he got himself singers and he got musical instruments he had men singers and women singers he had musical instruments he had entertainment everything he would need whether it be drama whether it be singing whether it be orchestration whatever it was solomon went out and made sure he had everything he thought he needed to find satisfaction everything that he thought he would need to be life is fulfilling now i finally found that kernel i found that grain i found that attraction that really gets me going gets me up in the morning makes me feel like i'm alive it makes me feel fulfilled but verse 9 he says so i was great and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem so we're going to read to verse 11. i was great and increased in possessions and mirth and joy and all the things that you could derive in this life he's pointing out specifically what his riches and what his power were able to accumulate for him with respect to natural things but then this is important also my wisdom remained with me so now solomon's saying i got everything that a natural man could have in life but i had something maybe better than everyone else i had a wisdom that excelled everyone else's wisdom but he says and whatsoever my eyes desired i kept not from them i withheld my heart i withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labor and this was my portion of all my labor remember his wisdom remains with him and this is what he does he goes out and gets everything he possibly can everything he can accumulate anything he could could think of he says then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labor that i had labored to do and behold despite all his possessions despite all his wisdom all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no prophet under the sun he enjoyed every single pleasure that you could think of right now you say well brother aaron did he have a switch i was like well no he didn't have a nintendo switch could he play fortnite no he couldn't do that but you take the equivalent in entertainment you take the equivalent in addiction you take the equivalent and how the mind would have been satisfied because the same areas of your brain that are firing now when you enjoy certain things it's the same area of the brain that men have been have wanting to fire throughout all centuries that pleasure center that endorphin rush all these things they tried to get going it's the same thing now they just changed it they changed the way that it triggers but it's the same process and you're saying ever i've enjoyed every pleasure of the flesh but i'm still not satisfied in the end now can we just start making this relevant for ourselves that if any of us in the flesh right now have thought if i could just live in a different place if i could just have the view of the mountains if i could just do this if i could just do that and you just go ahead and start lining it up whatever your bucket list thinking that somehow change of job change the location change in pay changing all these different if i could just have this if i could just make six figures if i could just drive a different car i'm tired of buying you know buying these used cards and whatever it is you think that's finally going to click and make it work for you solomon wants to talk to you solomon wants to have a conversation and he wants to say hey look i promise you it just doesn't satisfy just not going to do it oh if i could just have this i can just have that how many can identify with that sense of emptiness we experienced when we got everything we wanted oh this is going to be awesome oh this is going to be great oh this oh i can't wait i can't wait and you're all excited you finally get it you're like well i mean i don't know that that didn't that really wasn't all i thought it to be and then in that very moment cognitive dissonance kicks in and you're like that was amazing why because you just spent so much money on it and you keep telling yourself it was worth every penny it was worth every penny and everything in your beam that's saying that was a stupid decision you shouldn't have done that that was horrible and your mind says no no no no no no you're creating dissonance i don't like this i'm very uncomfortable so you just no no this was awesome it was worth every penny but if we're honest with ourselves we've sensed that we felt that and solomon's trying to tell us something look i've got this covered if you could just listen to me i'm the wisest man in the world i've done it all nothing seems to satisfy me then he continues his talk he has said i had wisdom and he in his wisdom he could see folly in his wisdom he could see that wisdom excelleth folly and it's far as light he says it exceeds folly as far as light exceeds darkness so he's saying my wisdom is so powerful it's his lights exceeding darkness it exceeds falling but listen to the conclusion he comes to being the richest man in the world giving his flesh every kind of satisfaction he thinks he could give it in order to find peace and to find contentment he says then verse 15 ecclesiastes 2 15 then said i in my heart as it happeneth to the full so it happeneth even to me i hope that just like really resonates with you solomon is actually saying i'm the wisest man in the world and the discontentment and the lack of satisfaction in all the frustration and all the lost hopes and all those things he's saying all those things happen to the full and guess what i'm the wisest man in the world and everything that happens to the full has happened to me he goes why was i then more wise what even benefit has my wisdom got me i'm the wisest man in the world and i still find myself lacking i still find myself wanting i still find myself miserable i still find myself sad then i said in my heart that this also is vanity even solomon's wisdom had not kept him from the vanity and sorrow of life there was still something about being the smartest man in the room that because you were a man you're still going to be left dissatisfied even though he was the smart the wisest man on earth there was something about just being a man on earth that he couldn't remedy there was something that he couldn't excel past and this is the point he's trying to make yes wisdom is is the principle thing with all thy getting good understanding but that has application to something very specific that we're going to come to hopefully by the end of this evening it comes to something very specific and what he's trying to point out is this human wisdom and human understanding and abilities and gifts and talents and all these different things and accolades they're empty in the end he says in verse 17 now this is heavy therefore i hated life because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous calamity of distress it's interest it hurts me it's grievous unto me for all is vanity and vexation of spirit the guy who built the house the guy who built the house with a nice backyard the guy that built the house with a nice backyard and a swimming pool the guy who built the house with a nice backyard and a swimming pool that had people to take care of it he had lawn service and pool service was included and then he had all the live entertainment he wanted that guy said he hated life that guy said life is harmful it's a calamitous distressful it's interest it's vanity it's empty it's missed it's vexation it's torture i want you to relate to it this perfectly describes the complications of human existence and he's pointing it out as we'll come to he's saying he uses these phrases later that what happened in the garden that caused the mixing in the hybriding and the another way and another plan in satan's life which begin by a question and delved into a lie he's describing way we exist now because of that mixing he's describing the wrestling and the struggle that we all have to deal with and he starts talking about the inequality of outcomes if you want to turn to ecclesiastes chapter eight how you would think that certain outcomes would always be the same and that if certain things always happened a certain way then you could begin to they could be predictable and and you could say this is what's fair but he starts recognizing the inequality of outcomes the inconsistencies and experiences and because it's inconsistent and it's unpredictable and it's any there's unfairness to it it causes frustration it causes disappointment you're expecting something this is the way that it should be watch this is the way it should be and then it doesn't happen that's an injury to you but the battery even talks about how is someone is always crossing bridges before they get there when they get there and they can't cross it it so injures their spirit to actually cause physical problems because in their mind they'd already crossed that they're already i'm already on the other side and they get there and things fall apart things don't happen exactly like they used to they thought it would because they're planners and they figure everything out and when it doesn't happen they respond to it as if it's a greater calamity than if they had just prepared that it might not happen and this is kind of the human nature that's being frustrated when he begins to examine these things as the preacher the one who's wise ecclesiastes chapter 8 verses 14 to 17 there is a vanity which is done upon the earth now listen to this vanity that there be just men these are righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked in other words there's good men that bad things happen to he said this is the vanity upon the earth i see good men righteous men upright men honest men men of integrity who deserve good but get evil he says and there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous can you see how he's fig i mean he's figured it out there's nothing that exists in the world today there's no behavioral economics book there's no social sociology book there's nothing that has been written today that he has not already addressed in some way in ecclesiastes the inequality of outcome is saying you know i've seen good men who deserve good get evil and you know what i've seen evil men get good he said the good that this guy got is the good that this guy deserved and the evil he'd got is the good the evil that this guy deserved he said this doesn't make sense this is vanity what good was it for the man to be honest and upright and have integrity when the guy who lied got the deal in the end right and what does man learn from that to lie what's happened to human nature is it falls further and further down this this trap he said i said that this is also vanity he said there is no apparent reason or justice in life events i can't figure it out there's no rhyme or reason to it there's no justice in it verse 15. then i commended mirth because a man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry now there's a tremendous principle with respect to this and there's a lot of depth that we could use to teach on different aspects of human nature and even what god desires for a man but he's saying in light of the injustices a lot of the unfairness he's saying just enjoy what you get there's nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and be merry and for that shall abide with them of his labor for that shall abide with him of his labor the days of his life which god giveth him under the sun hey look the good get evil the evil get good so just work enjoy what you can get because everything is so vexing and so vanity then he says when i applied my heart to no wisdom and to see the business that is done upon the earth again when he says under the sun on upon the earth he's taken he's including every single possible scenario that a human could experience from the beginning all the way to the white throne judgment he's covering all of it for also there is that neither day nor nor night seeth sleep with his eyes this is god is awake it's a god who never slumbers or sleep i applied my heart to no wisdom and to see the business that is done upon the earth then i beheld all the work of god that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun because though a man labor to seek it out notice his frustration yet he shall not find it ye further though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find it he's someone to see all the businesses done upon the earth and and really the application there is that there's neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes the business is constant it's continual it's always happening it's always unfolding but when he considers the work of the lord man cannot find out the work that is done unto the son though he labors he can't find it though he seeks he can't find it even a wise man who you think would know it he says he's not able to find it in other words the more the man labors and the more the man seeks the less he receives and the less he finds oh i'm going to find it through labor and work and i'm finally going to click it's finally going to make sense and the more he does it the less he's satisfied the wise man thinks he ought to know the more he seeks the more dissatisfied he is with his seeking so in ecclesiastes chapter 9 verse 11 i returned and saw under the sun that the race well let me just slow down before we get to this i hope you caught what he was saying in chapter eight the inequality the the good the good man getting evil the evil man getting good so he says you know what the the best thing a man could do is just work get stuff and enjoy it while he can because in reality when you consider everything that's under the sun no matter how much a man labors he won't be able to find real purpose no matter how much he seeks he won't be able to find purpose what is all this business under the sun what is all the work of god man cannot find the work that is done to the son he can't find that thing that clicks he can't find the thing that satisfies so he says i return and this is just more of this complicated inconsistent contradictory existence that we have ecclesiastes 9 verse 11 i returned and saw unto the son that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bred to the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favor to the men of skill are you picking up with solomon's laying down here you would think that the winner of the race is the one who's the fastest right say but you know it's not the fastest that wins the race oh you'd think in battle the battle would belong to those who are the strongest he said that doesn't even happen oh the the the wise will be able to get bread the wise will be able to gain increase the wise will figure that out no they can't do it you think the riches uh the the riches the real wealth is to men of understanding no they can't even figure it out oh and favor is to men of skill those who are skillful they receive the accuracy they receive the favor he is saying how completely contradictory life is that a race doesn't always go to the fastest the war is not always one by the strongest the bread doesn't always go to those who are the most uh sharp in business and the riches to men of understanding and the favor to those who have skill but he says this and this is so beautiful but time and chance happeneth to them all whether you want to say time it speaks of the untimely grave or even the grave but it also just speaks that time and chance you're at the wrong place at the wrong time that would have been better yesterday or that would have been good tomorrow i would go to my barber and he'd cut my hair and he'd say i'd say he'd go that'll be you know x number of dollars and oh i thought today was free tuesday goes no that was last tuesday how it always worked i always kept missing it was always the one before and this is time and chance happens to them all does that make sense to you chance oh man that was unlucky oh that was that's really horrible that's some bad fortune it's in every single one of them whether it be the fast the strong the wise the understanding the men of skill time and chance happens to all of them there's no resting in riches there's no resting in skill there's no resting in understand there's no rest in the strength there's no rest in being the the fastest because he says time and chance happens to every single one of them she said what promise does all our hard work hold in light of this fact he said well i just want to be the fastest well chance happens to the fastest they don't always win well i just want to be the strongest that doesn't guarantee you victory what does it matter if we all labor and we strive we try to do all these things he's pointing out the the complications of this life how you would think the fastest would win a race when the goal is to get there first you think the strongest would win battles when it's might over might and who would be the best but these are all the observations of a wise man who's recognizing the disharmony the inconsistencies the the chaos the confusion and the complications of just being a man the complications of just being a human being that the things you think will work don't work the things that you think shouldn't work do work the people that you think deserve a reward don't get it the fast don't win the races the strong but win the wars he's saying this is all this is a man i hope you're able to just see this picture and i realize the failure could be on my part just to adequately convey it but this is a man looking at all of life and being able to say this doesn't make sense mankind is irrational he's unpredictable that you can't even you can't even figure this out from that out all this chaos trying to make sense of all this chaos it doesn't even make sense because when you ought to do this you do that and it's so it's so utterly chaotic he's just saying this is the way that it is i imagine solomon if he had time he would have described us just all these biases we have in our minds that don't make any sense at all he's recognizing him he's getting all the heuristics laid out right here in ecclesiastes chapter three these are all the things that are happening to man and all these things we try to explain well this is why it's happening and this is why it's happening we're only trying to make sense of why man is the way he is why outcomes are irrational why things are unpredictable why things don't seem to line up why things are so complicated ecclesiastes chapter 10 verses 6 to 9. ecclesiastes chapter 6 verses 6 excuse me ecclesiastes chapter 10 verses 6 to 9. here's some more of his frustrations folly is set in great dignity and rich the rich sit in the low place that doesn't make sense does it folly gets the the crown folly gets the respect folly gets all the attention but the rich sit in a low place he said the rich ought to be in a high place in folly and foolishness that why why would that get dignity why would that be respected why would people follow that why would people revere that i have seen servants upon horses and princes walking as servants upon the earth the do you see the imagery the imagery what he's trying to convey this picture doesn't make sense here's a servant on a horse and a prince walking and walking beside it that doesn't make sense verse eight heat now this is this i hope i hope you can catch this he that dig at the pit shall fall into it now you say oh the guy who lays a trap the guy who lays a snare that's the guy that's going to get it absolutely that fits perfectly but his observation let's be a little bit more simple about it as he said the folly is set in great dignity that's kind of an opposite outcome that you would expect the rich sit in a low place you'd think by virtue of being rich they would have achieved the high place he's saying the servants are upon the horses when the prince has to walk beside it walking as a servant you would think that the benefit of being the prince would be that you'd get to ride on a horse he's saying things don't make sense anymore and then it speaks to the labor and the travail that man is tasked with in the man labors and man works he says the man who digs a hole he falls into it what was his job to dig the pit what happens he falls into the pit he's he's he is he is found to be injured by his labor i was trying to dig a pit and now i've fallen into it and then this just continues the same he uses these four different examples to make the same point whoso breaketh the hedge the guy who's trimming the hedge the guy who's doing a little bit of gardening a serpent shall bite him he's just trying to work i'm just trying to trim the hedges i'm just trying to do a little bit of gardening i'm just trying to pull the weeds out i'm trying to keep the vineyard clean i'm trying to this is this is my job i've been asked to purge the vineyard i've been asked to clean it i've been asked to dress it i've been asked to trim the hedges and what do i get for my word i get bit by a snake again think very simply now don't think about the types and things that are being referred to in here this is solomon just being very simple and very real about what happens to man whoso removeth stones shall be hurt there with in other words a man's job is to remove stones what happens it gets cut by them think about even the travail that we experience in natural labor sisters you just want to bake a cake that's all you want to do you want to have a nice cake you want to bake some chicken you want to cook something what happens you cut yourself you burn yourself all you're wanting to do is prepare a meal i say well that's is that really what he's saying yes this is what he's saying all you want to do is domesticate all you want to do is work all you want to do is do your job all you want to do is do it right but in doing it there's always some injury some harm you're you're simple in what you're trying to do you're sincere in what you're trying to do there's no guile and trying to bake a cake there's no guy in trying to put something uh put a nice dinner together but you go to grab something and you burn yourself you're cutting something and you you cut yourself he said this is what happens to man no matter what he tries to do there's something he gets bit by a snake he falls into the hole he cuts himself with the stones and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby there's splinters there's fragments that fly off he said this is what happens to man you chop wood well there's a damn downside to chopping wood you want to trim hedges there's a downside to trim and hedges you want to pick up stones you want to gather stones well you can be hurt by them i was just trying to pick one up through my back out and this is what he's describing this is the vanity this is the frustration is there anybody individually by hand or amen could say i think i'm seeing the picture that solomon is is laying out here that we can all relate to it in some way that's the life you live seems like no matter what you try to do there's there's a caveat to it there's a complication there's something that happens like i'm just trying to provide for my family i'm just trying to do this i'm just trying to do that i'm not out there trying to get rich on a quick stock sale i'm not out there trying to get do this i'm not trying to do that i'm just trying to be simple just trying to live my life and solomon said hey it doesn't matter it doesn't matter how wise you are it doesn't how smart you are it doesn't matter how good you are doesn't matter your pedigree or your legacy all those different things listen this is just life it's complicated he's wanting us to all understand this is just the way that it is and i'm the wisest man in the world and i figured this out this is what happens to man because he breathes this is what happens to woman because she lives this is what happens to all humanity it's a complicated confusing chaotic inconsistent contradictory life amen to that solomon that's the preacher i can say amen to he's dead on he's figured it out and then let's just back up to ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 29 because he says something nearly right in the middle of this book that is so profound ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 29 and we may just uh um leave off with some of this and and get to it on sunday and just maybe make a few references here in closing just to get your minds really pondering these things lo this only have i found that god made man upright but they have sought out many inventions he said this is what i found this only have i found so this has a way of putting everything into perspective all the vanity all the labor all the hardship whether you want to talk about an ecclesiastes 10 9 8 chapter 2 all these places we've read he says the reason for the vanity is man has become corrupted that's the reason for it and he's alluding the phrase he uses here that god made hath made man upright brings us back to genesis 1 and 2. this is exactly the comparison the wisdom that solomon begins to have he says i know why things are crazy i know why things are chaotic because this isn't the way that god wanted man to be he's like the man may god made man to be pure god made man in his image that's the way that god made man but now mankind is defiled now mankind is misguided now mankind is irrational and he says why because man by mixing himself with infinite things has become vain man's no longer simple the man is no longer focused no man does not is no longer just desirous of one thing he says this is the problem god made man to be righteous god made man in the beginning in his image but now something has happened to mankind and now he says he seeks out many different inventions and has become vain he has devised so many different ways so many different views so many different disciplines so many different belief systems to resolve the vanity to give purpose to all his labor he says god made man in his image man has lost that image and now man is constantly inventing things and mixing things and trying to figure things out to make sense of life he says that's why everything is as chaotic and complicated as it is it's almost as if everything solomon proposes in this book turns on this verse man is not living as god intended man to live originally in the beginning god had an order god had a purpose he said outside of that it's all vanity it's all frustration it's all confusion this only have i found that god hath made man upright but they've sought out many inventions it's a lot of ways that that phrase can be amplified just ponder it man has come up with all different ways of viewing the world what to try to make sense of the paradoxes to try to give purpose and meaning i work i labor i tried to do this i tried it and i'm not satisfied so i will create a god and it'll be that god that i bring my labor to to be that god i bring my fruits to be that god that i believe that you plant a crop and the crop burns up and and there's no rain so you begin to worship the cloud god you begin to worship the rain god because you're trying to figure out why your crops didn't grow and you find out that you need the sun and so you begin to worship the sun and you see how life and all these cycles and all these evolutions and there's some way you're trying to make sense of everything so they create deities they create belief systems they come up with inventions they come up with calculations they come up with theories and they try to make the a hypothesis and they test and they come up with a theory and they're trying to make sense of the world around them that's the condition of man that's why everything's vanity and corrupt and i would love just to read so many other verses in this book but let's just go to chapter 12. chapter 12 verses 13 and 14. this preacher who said vanity of entities all is vanity who said i sought out to figure out why all this sore travail that man has exercised with it wherewith that god has given him all the vanity and vexation of spirit all these different things we've read the inequality of outcomes the frustrations the lack of justice all these things that we've tried to express to you from this book tonight in contrast to the way that it was in the beginning the writer gives us kind of this cornerstone right in the middle everything turns on this god made man in his image in the beginning pure and righteous with a singleness of mind towards his word but now man being corrupted seeks out many different inventions and that's the reason why everything is the way that it is he sees this disharmony he sees this incongruence so now when he's painted the picture of all this vanity he has a conclusion ecclesiastes chapter 12 verses 13 to 14 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter the preacher has preached a three-hour sermon he's got 11 chapters he's laid it all out there he's completely described the failure of humanity the failure of wisdom the failure of all these different things and when i say wisdom it's more the intellect and the carnal understanding without positional place and purpose he says all these things are vexation and trouble and calamity he says so let's come to the conclusion of the matter fear god and keep his commandments the wisest man in the world realized the one who saw the human condition the one who had everything everything he had it every category you could come up with well did he have this yes he had the equivalent if not more did he have that yes the equivalent if not more he had it all he had it all he had it all he had it all you say what about air conditioning he had the equivalent he had everything that a man would want to some degree in the same equivalence as we would want to have it today and he still says and this is still applicable today it's more relevant now than i believe it ever has been in humanity fear god and keep his commandments this is a man that even at a time when men would have had more integrity or maybe at a time when there was more widespread there was not such a widespread connectivity to evil and filth and perversion and here he is just saying look at the end of the day this is the only thing that makes sense is the only thing that can give you reason to purpose fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man or if it's not to build a house with a swimming pool and an orchard no no it's not that fear god and keep his commandments this is the whole duty the entire duty this is the only thing that gives man purpose and reason to be and he's he he says this in such a beautiful way for god shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil there's the great equalizer he brings it right back to the beginning wherein good was mixed with evil brings it right back to the beginning when man began to mix and man who was made in the image of god the man was made pure he was made righteous he was made holy god made man upright without any impurities but now he's become he's become mixed with evil he says god is going to be the one that judges what is good and what is evil and he's telling us there's only one thing that could remedy the curse there's only one thing that can remedy the confusion there's only one thing that removes the complication and will navigate you through the complexity he says fear god and keep his commandments if we could simplify the fall the fall was simply disbelieving god's word and acting against god's word the fall simplified at its base at its most basic component it was leaving god's purpose for man god had a place for the man god had a place for a woman god had a word for them to live by he had things that they were not supposed to do and by man doing what he was supposed wasn't supposed to do caused the woman to leave her position the man to leave his position and the entire economy of god fell in that moment you see the economy the god's economy of innocence in the beginning the fall was simply disbelieving god's word and acting outside of his promises now let me leave you with this this is where i hopefully will not want to emphasize perhaps on sunday if that's what caused the fall then there's only one way back there's only one way back right now in the time we live in 2021 today in the in the midst of all the pleasures and all the amenities and all the gifts and all the science and all the technology and whatever it might be that makes our lives that we can use from vacuums that vacuum without us touching them they can map your house roomba just do your job the roomba horror stories are quite atrocious especially the pictures especially if you have pets all right are we over it yet but this is what man has cars that can drive themselves cars now that you can have particular cars where you don't need to worry about where you're parked you just need to know where you're standing and how to push a button on your watch and your car will come get you in the midst of all that and everything that exists in the world today what's the way back to simple life what's the way back to happiness and joy and contentment the word it's not even church because it's not programs it's not social connections it's not education you're not going to find it in politics it's not getting the right guy in office you're not going to find it in science there's only one way solomon the preacher the wisest man who saw everything that we see today says this is the conclusion this is it if you want to know how to live fear god and keep his commandments i know this seems really really simple and it's not really that deep but maybe if i could have took time to add up what all these numbers mean and fear god and keep his commandments and say well the a is one and this is two and all that adult maybe you come to 777 and we'd all say that's it for there and that's it fear god keep his commandments but it's not in the types it's not at all the head ear scratching things it's not in all the great flowery things it's not an education it's not in all those things the soft living the pressures of lit riches and the nervous tensions that'll never you can't try to address those in any other way and resolve them unless you come back to the word only by god's word can we find peace and fulfillment in this complicated age that's it there's there's no other way that i i mean i realize there's certain things that maybe we could take time to teach and just you know principles of living and say well these are the seven steps to finding that your house is less stressful than it is and if there's somehow if it's somehow not coming back to a word the word of god and a word experience in your heart listen god will frustrate every single one of your carnal plans until you have a word foundation he won't let any of it work but i bought the book i did the program i've downloaded the app i paid extra to remove the ads and i'm doing everything they said i needed to do to not live a cluttered life i'm doing everything i could do to try to simplify and to do this and to do that and to eat right and all these different things and everything you try to do as a believer you wonder why you're frustrated you wonder why things don't work because everything you're trying to do as a believer if you don't have a word birth if you don't have the foundation of the word thank god he'll frustrate everything we try to do to get us to the place like god nothing's working what's missing and he says i'm missing you need to have a word birth you need to be born again and then you need to take my word and live by my word and then do all those other things and you'll find that they work and you'll find that's why some things work for other people and some things work for other people because it's discretionary because the word doesn't make a distinction but where it won't work for the believer is if it's outside the word you say what do you mean about that well the one guy who wants to go no carbs and he loses weight by no carbs the other guy says i mean i eat all the carbs i want i just don't eat after five right am i mentioning anything that somebody can say hello i mean this kind of starting to make sense they're both believers they both have the holy ghost and they both lose 40 pounds by completely different diets where the rationale contradicts well no you really can't lose weight if you're eating a lot of high fat you know i don't remember there well the only way to lose weight you know but it works why because god having that anchor in your heart in your life those things don't become your religion those things don't become your type post at the end of the day lord i'm just trusting you give me wisdom give me guidance lord you make the difference at the end of the day i hope this drives home listen god will frustrate every ideology every plan every viewpoint every paradigm every belief system every discipline every diet every goal until he gets a believer to the place where they surrender to him and they're born again that's the climax that's the ultimate that's what places you in the body of christ i'm a new creature in christ jesus and now you begin to live a different life according to different set of rules and i thank god he does it now even in that regards if you have a word experience in a word basis he'll still frustrate your plans until you realize at the end of the day my faith belongs in the word alone and not a fad diet my faith belongs in the word alone instead of something else you've got to come back to that there's no growing kids god ways or five love languages or anything like that that's going to resolve child rearing problems resolve marriage problems you know the solution you know the resolution it's in the word of god let the word give you the wisdom let the word lead you and guide you explicitly specifically plainly let him do it there'd be nothing better for you than to be digging into the word of god and read a scripture and have it quicken to you this is how i can handle this difficulty with my child nothing better than to be listening to a sermon and brother brown's just laying in the word and you're quick and this is how i can resolve a bad atmosphere in my home it comes from the word oh wow i lost track of time all right uh we invite brother micah to come but i want to read a quote to you and this has so moved me it is so powerful i want to challenge us as a church to make a phrase in here that's basically three lines to make it our personal individual uh vision brother brown says what can help he's referring to the chaos the confusion the labyrinth the maze that seems no way out you go down this hallway and it's closed you go down this one it's closed he goes only the one thing needful only the one thing needful return to christ looking to christ as the only leader and walking in his footsteps listen this this is this is present day application to whatever you're going through right now doesn't matter what it is this is applicable return to christ look to him alone as your leader walk in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we all reach the goal there's no other way but christ there's no other way but through the word and have come to the unity of the faith and then he says as the heavenly master built everything on the ground of the scriptures so should we leave all particularities of our special confessions and be satisfied with the revealed word of god which belongs to us all wow wow [Music] i i mean you won't find something like this in barnes noble the master built everything on the word so we have to leave all of our little specific isms and all our little beliefs and all of our little personal special confessions and all our all our little ideas and be satisfied with the word of god that belongs to us all that's why you can like one thing i can like another i can think this works you can think that works i can i could drive a a chrysler because it was given to me and you could drive a ford and someone could drive a toyota and like ah a toyota and someone could drive a chevy and say well you know that 90 of all fords are still on the road right why because the other 10 actually made it home [Music] those are just the kind of things people say and they get oh yeah i'm a chevy man and somebody drives a four no look before you on you you're no man but these are all the little special confessions and all the peculiarities you do this you do that listen this isn't a joke there's people that resent one another in church because someone's in the doterra camp and someone's in the young living camp i speak the truth it's a little special confessions that we have leave all that and be satisfied with the revealed word that belongs to us all that's what binds us together that's what makes us one that's why i can relate to you and you can relate to me though we have different backgrounds and different ambitions and different hobbies after the flash and different things that work for us and different belief systems when it comes to diets and education and how we're raising our children and what we let them do this way we do that with those different areas that we might have differences in discretion where god allows it but where do we find our common ground we are all satisfied with the revealed word of god that belongs to you just as much as it does to me and then he says this oh this is so beautiful with the bible in our hand we should cry i believe what god has revealed in this book i will obedient keep his obediently keep his commands i hope for that which he has promised that's just so simple to live by this i believe what god has revealed in this book i will obediently keep his commandments i hope for that which is promised how does that not cover it all how is that not a prophet taking everything he goes what can help what is needful what do we need to do we need to return to christ well then how can i live what can i do he says just take this bible in your hand and say i believe all that is revealed in this book i will obediently obey its commands i will obediently keep his commands i hope for that which he has promised if there's a promise that's not fulfilled i still believe in it and not hope is an enemy to faith but hope that he expects it to knows it's coming so he says christians give here there's only one life but death comes to us in a thousand forms there's only one christ but a thousand antichrists so thou knowest o christendom what is the one thing needful either thou turn us back to christ or thou go us to the destruction like the antichrist if thou art wise and will live follow the leader of life brother reg preached on hide and seek now we have another one we can ponder follow the leader follow the leader of life only one life but death comes in a thousand forms only one christ but a thousand antichrist and though he speaks to christendom though he speaks to the church so there's one thing needful return to christ or face destruction this is applicable to us as individuals tonight as we ponder our life we plan to our pathway we ponder our past and everything we're facing our desires our ambitions and our goals there's only one thing needful christ looking to him as your only leader walk in his footsteps setting aside all the other ways until we reach the goal and grab this bible in our hand and say i believe what god has revealed in this book i will obediently keep his commands i hope for that which he has promised could you do that tonight could you stand on your feet and grab your bible if you've got a bible it's a good reason it's good to bring a bible to church if you read your bible on your phone you can get a lot more out of that phone than just the word the beautiful thing about the bible if you take out the maps and the concordance which even then has some connection the word all you're going to get out of this is the word there's no other distracting app but take your bible in your hand and say this i believe what god has revealed in this book i will obediently keep his commands [Music] i hope for that which he has promised hold that in your heart remember this tonight when you read this book remember tomorrow when you ponder the scripture remember i believe what god has revealed in this book i will obediently keep his commands i hope for that which he has promised that's a real simple way to live bow our heads our prayer will be simple tonight it'll be these very words that brother branham tells us with the bible in our hand we should cry our gracious heavenly father i believe what you have revealed in this book i believe it's become a new book i believe all the veils that science and religion have tried to place on it are being torn away i believe all that is revealed in this book and i will obediently keep your commands may i not lord fail on one in one regard not in one lord may i not fail lord may i obediently keep all that which is revealed to me the word which i know that i must keep may i keep it and lord as far as my footsteps i confess that i hope for that which you have promised [Music] therein lord it expresses the hunger and the desire of a christian for more but an understanding that the more can only be satisfied by what you give [Music] so lord i believe in you i believe your word i believe you're bringing me back to a simple faith you're bringing me back into simple faith to a perfect faith because i believe what is revealed in this book and i will obey your commands and i will hope for the promises which are yet to come it may somehow someway these things become the overarching theme of my life may they become my life tuned may it become the melody by which i live the lord i'm not gonna lay these things down and try to figure it out in something else lord may we recognize that the good which we have received has come by your hand the blessings which we have enjoyed in this life have come by your hand that even the difficulties and the struggles you have saw us through them in mercy and you've used them for your glory and our benefit father my prayer my burden my desire is that this is what we're anchored in as a church this is what we're anchored in as individuals and this is what we're anchored in as husband and wife father and mother son and daughter brother and sister that i we can have our little special confessions but when it comes to this we're satisfied with the revealed word that belongs to us all oh god there's it's all those things that have torn us apart and separated us have been the very the carnal interpretations of the revealed word which ought to bind us together no wonder lord your heart bleeds to see your people come back to the word i pray you'd bless the people tonight for the special attention and discipline lord admits the different changes in room lord but the atmosphere has been so beautiful the faith has been so high [Music] the pull on the word has been so dynamic lord it's so powerful i pray you just touch your people now lord and bless them i pray in the late hour that we're in in this lengthy service bless them in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen can you remember that i believe what god has revealed in his book i will obediently keep his commands i will hope for that which he has promised that's the right that's the right way to live
