TRANSCRIPT
========================================
sounds about right for Thanksgiving text I didn't I had necessarily pondered it that way but we just felt on a heart to continue on the subject of red herring a rainbow trout and just I think all of us that are here today were in the service on Sunday or have caught the service in an archive so you probably know just exactly where we're at but a red herring is something that distracts it's something that misleads and so there's an issue at hand there's something irrelevant maybe problem solving maybe a discussion could be something that's used in terms of debate or an argument over a policy or a particular situation and then somebody kind of throws something out whether it be a question or some sort of position oftentimes it could just be a factor uh you know it point to anything but it's done in a way to kind of Veer you off what is important gets you away from problem solving the actual issue when you start debating something totally different discussing something kind of off track so a red herring is something that misleads maybe the key word I've been using is or is distracts from something that's relevant the relevant conversation the relevant point or the important question so we have what a red herring is on the other hand rainbow trout is something different we're using these uh things as kind of contrary to one another opposed to one another red herring is something that distracts and the red herring distracts from the rainbow trout because the rainbow trout is our I'm thinking of it this way our personal revelation of Christ and our personal Union with Christ that's what the rainbow trout is it's our joining together with Christ that Union with Christ or drawn it from that from that third pull uh Vision that brother Bradham had where he said those those great big rainbow trout in that Lake and so that's what we use as a phrase to refer to the third pull the open of the word Christ is the rainbow trout and what we're emphasizing on somebody is we cannot let our attention be taken away from that what counts can't allow our attention to be distracted by red herrings or using the phrase red hair in a very broad umbrella to refer to a lot of things that distract us from that which counts or from the main thing and just a few more things to kind of give us the review but in the church age book chapter 4 brother Branham says no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God very simple very straightforward that you are your strength is directly connected to your knowledge of the word of God and your obedience to the word of God and that ought to strike all of us in a particular cord to where faith is what we must have you must believe it you you want to just have that simple Faith but then there's a desire to understand to grow deeper in the things of God because you have to have a knowledge of the word of God and an obedience to the word of God and our strength our spiritual health and we're no more alive so life depends upon our knowledge of the word of God and our obedience to the pure word of God and as we said on Sunday what the red herring wants to do is disconnect us from the source of our strength and if you find yourself getting weakened you find yourself losing your spiritual health you find that you're not quite alive or living like you want to live of then you could find that there's a connection to the word of God whether by knowledge or obedience to it that's been cut off and the red herring is what tries to throw us off balance and get us into things that don't strengthen our faith but rather weaken our faith and where we we're picking up on tonight and I I was wanting to go back and maybe since I had to stop kind of right in the middle I felt bad we were looking at hair splitting and people who separate themselves and and how we can take certain issues and make them so large in our minds that it separates our fellowship or divides us then when you go back to it you look it says this is not part of the rainbow trout to begin with this isn't even in the pool this isn't this isn't what we ought to be focusing on but yet it divides people and we were wanting to really take a step further in that and we'll have to do it tonight but it's the word that unites us it's that uh it's the third pool we can put it that way the third pull that unites us and I want to draw some thoughts on what the third pull is so if it's the word that unites us it's the red herrings that divide us so it's the red herrings that kind of slip in and cause us to draw swords against one another it's the red herons that cause to look side eye at people and say I don't know about that you know they they don't do communion with a single cup or they uh they they do this or they do that there's ways that we start dividing over what is brother Brown called hair splitting where you take something very small and it's a small maybe seemingly insignificant difference but we allow it to become so large that it divides us and that's what brother Brown said the people that hair split and he talked about uh and he quoted Jude 19 and it was allowing it to separate themselves but the Bible tells us where the carcass is where the fresh meat is where that fresh word is there will the Eagles be gathered together so we don't gather around anything else but the word of God and as we gather around the word of God if we can make that our gathering point if we can make the word of God our rallying point when we were traveling uh flew into Amsterdam our uh the the ride service that we had scheduled uh sent us a picture and it was a picture and it was called it was called the meeting spot and we had arrows and everything it was a clock I think and that was the place to meet and it didn't matter what else was around what kind of restaurants around there was actually a Starbucks there to our disappointment there was a lot of Starbucks in Europe that uh there's um so at least you knew you could get a bad cup of coffee while you're in Europe but there's uh there was a meeting point a rallying place and there's a place that you could go and say this is the meeting spot and nothing else mattered but knowing where that was and as long as you could hold to that meeting spot didn't matter where what time your flight landed and what kind of background you had didn't matter who you're riding with whatever what the point I'm trying to make is if we can rally around the word of God while we're there rallying around the word of God we can recognize our differences but as long as we rally around the right thing our differences aren't going to make such a matter as much and we can acknowledge oh you see it this way oh you do this and oh you don't celebrate Christmas oh you think Thanksgiving is a pagan holiday and we can all have all sorts of ideas but say hey but you know what it's the fresh kill that matters isn't it it's like that's right that's right we're right we're rallying around the right things we don't want to let small things that are not word things begets so big that it separates us from our fellowship in the word and that's where we really took great encouragement from the statement and for what is the attraction brother Brahm says that's what the attraction is the predestinated seat of God who can't do nothing else but follow it follow up the attraction the word of God he says means more than life to us take our lives but don't you take that so there's a lot of things we ought to be willing to give up there's a lot of things we ought to be willing to say oh it doesn't matter there's things that we should be able to say you know what that's my personal opinion you have your personal opinion these are things that at the end of the day really really don't matter take all these other insignificant hair splitted issues but whatever you do don't take the word of God and he says what is the attraction God as usual fulfilling his word so we gather around the word of God despite our differences or we can remain gathered around the right thing despite our differences when the main thing stays the main thing I I I could almost guarantee it if you look at where either it begins to get a little bit of a friction a little bit of Separation it's when the main thing loses its emphasis and the main thing is no longer the main thing and something else begins to get more preeminent and matter more and that's where the division comes but as long as we can keep our eyes on the rainbow trout keep our eyes on the things of God then we can recognize differences but realize that God will use those but it shouldn't separate us as Jude wrote in verse 19 he said these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit so uses that phrase Central to identify that these are carnal Ambitions these are carnal desires these are carnal estimations and as we delved into a little bit deeper on Sunday that there's some things that Judah is referring to where people had some unique Doctrine maybe a different standard of living or they had some some platitude that they pointed to says this makes me better this makes me more holy this makes me different and they used it to separate from The Fellowship of the Saints they used it to separate from the teaching of the word of God and they suppose themselves more spiritual because they had a different take and Jude's saying no these guys aren't more spiritual they're sensual they're carnal these things have nothing to do with the spirit brother Branham said seemingly not having the faith and so it's not rooted in the word of God it's more their own personal uh particularities that they they're cabbage down on and causes separation and brother Branham uses that phrase or use the description identifying those who fuss and fight over insignificant things and over differences and then separate their Fellowship from the people and so it is it is the word of God this is something write it down however you feel that you can write this down but it's the word of God that we value over all of our own opinions it's the word of God that we value over all of our little particularities just in this room tonight there's enough different um uh you know taste and desires and likes and preferences to where we might have dozens of difference of opinions on what kind of meat we should have for Thanksgiving that's one of the reasons why I didn't choose a Thanksgiving me because I thought for sure if I said spam or turkey some of the spam people like wait a minute we've been doing spam on Thanksgiving for Generations in our household and you offend somebody so but there might be a lot of different ways the different Traditions think of all the different Traditions that we have that people approach holidays and they approach certain things and it's those things that make us different and we value those things and they're wonderful and diversity is a beautiful thing but there's something we value over all of that and it's the word of God there's a point at which it uh one thing that you have to be very careful of and maybe I hope I'm not making a political point but it's something that seems very obvious to me that if you make diversity the most important thing you'll lose your diversity have you thought about that that as soon as soon as you as soon as the main thing's not the main thing and you make something else the main thing you're gonna You're Gonna Lose even the ideal you're trying to support and you're trying to lift up because the only thing that harmonizes everything is the word of God it's the only thing that makes makes sense of everything so it's the word that we value over all other opinions ideas or approaches and we evaluate even over our own personal differences and our our personal differences our personal preferences should never be elevated above the word of God and I guess I'm very glad to say this to a Wednesday night crowd because it takes a lot of maturity and a lot of discernment and maturity with that discernment to recognize hey you know what this may not be right down the middle of the road in the word of God are very clear in the word of God and it takes the maturity sometimes to look at our own ideas and say you know what this is just my personal preference I'm not going to elevate this to the status of thus saith the Lord so I can use it as a kajal to beat other people up and tear other people's spirituality down but you recognize it yourself that this is personal conviction this is how the Lord is dealing with me I'm not saying it's so for you I'm not saying it so for you but this is how it is for me it takes a lot of maturity to do that it'll take a lot of maturity to recognize uh just a little personal differences and different ways that we feel and not allow those to be elevated above the word of God and so as I look at this tonight and just look at the pace we're going uh well I was just about to skip my text and I thought well maybe I shouldn't do that I'll just give everything I had there for my text we'll just we'll touch on it because I think it'll be beneficial and I want to I want to come back to this in Greater detail if the Lord continues just to Thrill Me personally on this study I'm doing about the third poll and if he inspires it for the church but in Luke chapter 14 we won't read the whole thing but uh just look back at a couple verses here there was a great supper that is made and there's going to be those that are invited to the feast the table's already everything's set and there's invitations that are given out and then one by one there's these different uh excuses that are made and we realize at the very end there's these different efforts to get people to come and so what we've read because we're using the rainbow trout as a symbol of the third pool and how the red herring distracts us from that rainbow trout of that third pool and in Luke chapter 14 it gives us a tremendous example of what a pull is because and looking around the room we are your third pool we hear it enough to where we don't really think about what a pull is some might think that someone has more than one swimming pool uh there's like the Seven Seals people often think about those that are barking and swimming in the ocean and but a pool is this tells us what a pull is and so when brother Brown says um a pool then when we a pool is something it's a verb it's telling you what it does the third pool and this scripture helps us understand what a pull is in verse 16 is we have it up there then said he unto him a certain man great a great made a great supper and bade many there's your pull he invited him he called them this is an invitation this is a calling out we could say this is the first pull he bade many there's a there's a kind of a attention get your attention invite you to the table could you come that's an invitation to come and the sermon is your life worthy of the Gospel brother Brown says did you notice there were three pools or three turns of it this is referring to the scripture when they went out first and called to them that were bidden to come they didn't do it so they went out a healing campaign went out to get the Blind and Halt and still there were room so he went out and compelled the good bad and indifferent that they should come in so here's brother Adam calling this three pulls first an invitation then a healing campaign and then a compelling and so when he says pull it's an actual get your attention ask you to come try to draw you out so a pull is something that gets the people's attention a pull is something that draws people it it's a tug a pull is a tug just as it sounds the third point you say the first pull is that second pull is that and the third pull is that it's trying to get somebody's attention I don't know where it started uh well as I said I don't know where it started but I but I'm going to mention a child's name but I was talking about Jack he started just a very very very young age even before he could talk if he if he he just want he'd always want to grab your cheek to talk to you now you look up at you just grab you and you want to look you in the face and that's that's the pull get your attention look at me this is what I want to say I'm trying to talk to you there's an effort that's being made and we're working with him to not do that but uh but what God wants to do sometimes and we'll let God do it if he wants to he can grab our chin right it's a pull it's a tug it's to get our attention as brother remember says it's a bidding it's a call it's that invitation to draw you out so when we get to verse 23 he says in the Lord said unto the servant so the first pull he paid many the second pull brother bam calls it a healing campaign and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled that word compelled means to necessitate it to to give it some sense of urgency to compel it means to drive them or whether by force or any other means and that to me is really really helps identify what a pull is because it's gonna say hey if you want I'm having friendsgiving uh why don't you come over any friends who want to come over don't have family come over to the house and it's like people just hey you know what if you want you could come I don't have to come and that's kind of what the first invitation is is it's kind of like well I bid you to come the second is imploring those who might have a greater need hey the healing campaign and oh I'm sick and the whole those who would be a little bit more urgent I I want to be there but then when it gets to that third pull this is something that becomes necessity this compelling Drive whether by Forest and so that third pool is the greatest attraction that third pull is the one of the greatest necessity and brother Bradman the sermon from that time he said oh if I could only go back if I could only have a chance I would grab them I would pull them I would persuade them don't let no one miss this this is perfection so when he had gone beyond that curtain of time and there was something in them that realized my this is greater than I could have ever thought before he uses a language that helps us understand what first second and third pull means he says I would grab them pull them persuade them don't let any of them miss it this is perfection this is what the idea of a pool is it ought to grab your attention and pull you to it kind of a tractor beam of sorts it's going to get your attention it's going to gravitate you to it and so the open of the word is we use this rainbow trout this third pool it's what draws us it's what pulls the bride uh to to her position in the end time it's the it's what is it's the third pull that brings us to that Gathering Place around the things of God the word of God that that Feast that fresh that fresh kill that's our the third pool is our gathering together if it's anything else it's cultish and brother Branham it was we read it before in the seventh seal he says I was standing there with a little baby shoe on I think I referenced it on Sunday said I was standing with a little baby shoe when he told me there make your first pull and when you do the fish will run after the Lord said then watch your second pull said because there are only be small fish he said then the third pull will get it you realize the third pull is the final attraction it's the third pull that is the final attraction it's the only Gathering Place this this let this sink in it's the only Gathering Place there is to receive rapturing faith in time for the Rapture and so this third poll it's the it's the only source of rapturing Faith the third pull is the only invitation to draw us to feasting around the things that matter and so put in that way I think you could understand just how tremendous it is to not get distracted by red herrings because the only place that there's Rapture in faith is in the third pool the only place that you're going to receive strength that you need to fly out of here and rise above all the things of the world is in the third pool so the very purpose of that stinking red herring is to take your mind off the the trout to take your mind off the third pull the very thing that's going to feed your faith and give you power to fly out of here so in the sermon excuse me in Hebrews chapter 12 this is where we stopped Sunday morning Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 and 2. wherefore seeing we are also compassioned about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth which doth so easily beset us and the way that it's phrased it means the weight don't so easily beset us and the sin does so easily beset us and we hear the phrase besetting sin but it can be a weight and it can even be a sin so it doesn't even have to be sin but just even harmless things and even useful things things that are lawful can hinder our growth can impede our progress and so it can be a weight and we've got to recognize the weights just as much as we need to recognize the sins can you can you think about that in terms of sin is unbelief and there's things that maybe we're very quick to recognize that's unbelief that's taking me the wrong direction that's not pleasing to the Lord but what about the weights what about the weights that beset us and I want to amplify that besetting here a little bit in a moment but he says and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith when Paul says this looking unto Jesus he turns our face away from the weights turns our face away from the sin because we don't even want to be focused on that we don't want to spend our entire time trying to find weights trying to find sin but he says let's look unto Jesus I guess I would say that's part of laying aside every weight part of laying aside the sin that does so easily beset us is taking our eyes off the weights taking our eyes upon off the sin and looking to Jesus it refocuses us the the whole idea of removing uh laying aside the weight and the sin that does so easily beset us it kind of removes the red herring and I know I'm using general terminology to bring things under a particular rainbow or umbrella it takes us removes the red herring focuses on that rainbow trout it puts our eyes on that which matters and in the sermon Victory Day and I'll be reading from it again here towards the end but if you want to take it's actually during this time period where brother Adam's using the Looking Glass a lot and using the eyeglass and hunting and focusing he says now God is trying to get a man to look to that innocent substitute for a way back and man wants to look at it in his own way and I'd say that looking at your own way that's that red herring approach he says he don't want you to see that God is trying to show him in his innocent substitute therefore that's what's caused the trouble then when man does as it was picks up the glasses to view off in a long distance to see what God is trying to show him he fails to focus his glasses right so a man seemingly has control over what he focuses on he picks up the glasses now what are you going to zoom in on what are you going to zero in or what are you going to look at and and we have that autonomous we have that ability we have that opportunity to kind of zoom in on the things that we want to and he says God is wanting you to recognize the qualities of this innocent substitute he says but the problem is man wants to look at it his own way and he says in that sermon he looks so at so much of the natural he fails to see the spiritual application that the word gives and that reminded me of brother I'm saying oh seemingly not having the faith and Jude's saying they're sensual they separate themselves they they're looking so much to the Natural things they're looking so much to the red herring so much too uh the political things of it they're looking so much to the Natural carnal side of things that they fail to catch the spiritual application they fail to catch the depth of it that the word gives and he said this is all in the way we view things it's all in the way that we focus on things it's the way that we give things preeminence or give weight to certain things and quantify certain things he says it's it's a carnal or sensual approach it's very humanistic and when we do that we're not focusing on the right things the scripture here Bears much greater amplification than what I'll give it tonight but Paul writes and he says in First Corinthians chapter 3 verses 1 2 and 3 says and I Brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual why couldn't he speak unto him as a spiritual but as unto carnal even as done to babes in Christ he had to speak to him in a way that addressed them in their immature state and so as I have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to Bear it neither yet now are you able so he has to feed him with milk because Peter said the milk will cause you to grow and then you grow to a place where you can endure the meat it comes back to the Hebrews and talks about that he says for a year yet carnal now notice where the carnality Manifest itself for where is there is among you in being in strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men this is It's the idea of separation envying strife and divisions where would Indian come from looking at things carnally where does strife come from that's that divisiveness and division The Strife there means debate or differences it actually comes from the root of electioneering or party making where one is the word actually means seeking to win followers now as I said I'm not given as much tension to this as I ought to because that word can be used to be so precise on how sometimes we act around particular issues we see it a certain way and what do we start doing we start acting through Strife because we want others to see it the way we see it we want others to kind of see our side of things and we want to kind of pull people away to get it to view our standpoint and to view our angle and you ask yourself is it a red herring or is it the word of God if it's in the word of God we want to see it the right way we want to be shoulder to shoulder we want to be standing we want to see eye to eye as we come up this great Mount Zion but there's some things that we start electioneering about our party making that is nothing more than politicking to gain followers in a hair splitting agenda to see things a certain way and that's when Judah is saying you're sensual and you're trying to pull off to yourself followers and separate yourself from fellowship and policing the envious drives and divisions are the results of being carnal it's when through our Looking Glass we zoom in on the wrong things and things start to seem much larger than it ought to and we want to die on that mountain zoom in much larger on things that gets more Amplified and gets more weight than it ought to and we start attributing to so much value to this and this is the way it should be and this is the way things ought to be run and this is how we ought to see it and this is what we ought to be pursuing and when you take a step back from and refocus you realize oh my goodness that was such a red herring what was I thinking it's the result of being carnal this other man says they see so much of the natural of it and fail to see the spiritual application that the word gives and in many ways that's the exact rebuke that Paul was giving and so there has to be there has to be a a recognition of what matters in the sermon healing and what cancer is or healing and sometimes what cancer is Barbara says and I'm certainly I'm grateful to God that what he's doing in this last days and how that he's drawing men from everywhere to serve him and may this great drawing power he says it's the greatest drawing power that the world has ever known Jesus said if I be lifted up I'll draw a men unto me and if we'll just in the simple gospel draw Lift Jesus Christ up before the people he'll do the drawing it's the greatest magnet the world has ever known so there's only one thing that ought we ought to be magnetized to there's only one thing that ought to be party making that's the word of God certainly there would be no no no air in politicking for Christ there'd be no air in electioneering for Christ there'd be no air in seeking to win followers for Christ and so that's what ought to have the preeminence we ought to be honest with ourselves and we have to be very humble to be sure that we are lifting up Christ we're lifting up the word we're staying faithful to the message and and faithful to the things that it presents and it has taught us so that we're not lifting up the red herring they were not lifting up something else because if rather I'm saying that that's the greatest drawing power that's where if I be lifted up draw I'll draw them into me it's the greatest joint power the world has ever known that's what you want to lift up and let him draw people to him let him be the drawing card let him be the pull but as soon as you step away from that and you make an agenda an ideology a personal opinion that's when you're doing exactly what Paul was chastising the Christian the church for or your carnal and it's through strife and Indian politicking and causing divisions now I'm going to take a little bit of a different I'm still wanting to stay in that vein of looking Victory Day where he's talking about the glasses and focusing our glasses right and so much of my thought in red herring and rainbow trout was focusing on the right thing getting the right Focus and so this is a little bit of a change of subject matter but or change of terminology a little bit but red herrings we've established are distractions but they're distractions in the sense that if you if you think about it in terms of the original use of the the um the phrase the red herons used to throw um that is used in the one sets to throw a Hound off the scent of a fox and so a fox is following a scent it's a signal it's it's feedback he's he's following it and as long as he can catch that sin of the fox he can track that fox he can find where that fox is and he can get the prey he can meet his goal then the red herring comes along and it's to interrupt that scent and cause that Hound to pick up a different scent and chase after this pungent uh stinky fish and so the red herrings are distracted in that they send out a different scent or signal that mixes things up and you can't quite discern the scent of the fox so now if we're trying to relate that to the idea of red hair in a rainbow trout and if we're using in terms of what you want to eat I'm still talking about something being distracted and what you don't want to do is develop a taste for the red herring because it's very easy it'd be very easy for us to really enjoy debating certain things and getting caught up in certain things and there's an energy that comes with that you want to be careful that you don't take develop a proclivity or desire or leaning to red hair and say well I'm sorry brother but I kind of like red herring I kind of like anchovies I kind of like the taste I it's it's in our tradition it's in our blood I'm Norwegian we like to eat raw fish for breakfast and stinky things for lunch and there might be just certain things that you like and you enjoy you say hey as for me as for the word of God we don't want to develop a taste for anything that's not the fresh kill that Manna the word of God however you want to use these these words so the red herring distorts what we're trying to pick up and when we look use the example of fishing but everyone talks about in that third point he says there's little nibbles you feel something and what's the temptation just try to set the hook a little bump or something like this you got to be patient Got to Hold Steady there's little things that are trying to entice you into a hook set little things trying to get you to jerk the hook trying to get you to react to it and lose your patience but we want to stay patient because the rewards that that rainbow trout and so Paul says the Sin that does or the weight or the sin that does so easily beset us that phrase it means stand so conveniently around us you ever thought about it this way I'm sure that with such tremendous Ministries we have in the message today there's just no doubt you've probably heard it preached on even better and you've heard this before but the sin that does so easily beset us uh besetting kind of has this idea of It kind of pushes me down or it weighs me down it's a sin that trips me up but the word says so easily besets us it means that we are eagerly encircled by it it's it's so easily besets it so easily surrounds us it's much admired much applauded we have easy access to it one one way it's used in the term is it closely clings and encircles us so their sin that so easily besets us it it doesn't even necessarily have to be something that we're actively engaging in but it's right there at our disposal it encircles us it clings to us it's it's much applauded it's lifted up it's just so easy we're always being enticed by we're always being attracted by it's right there and when brother Brown says in this day we're unbelievers and scientists are trying to smother out the real value of the word of God it's the weight and the besetting sin that encircles us it's like as if one one uh translation described it as a robe that just surrounds us and tries to cling to us and encircles us and when you look at the context of the Hebrew church and I know I'm trying to take an entire book that's got so much wealth of information and distill it down but you can kind of pick up these Clues to the Hebrews they were under constant pressure to turn away from the mystery of Christ to a natural law that was tangible and there were there was constant pressure that you have these things that you can do and things that are discernible and can be touched and can be handled and Paul say no these are all types of the mystery of Christ who cannot be touched and he's trying to encourage him to remain steadfast and says don't don't lay aside your confidence don't cast that confidence away he says Ah you know don't don't lay aside every weight in the sin that does so easily beset you and he's imploring the Hebrew Church who are under constant pressure to reject the mystery of Christ and to turn to carnal things he's telling them to turn from all the noise turn from the distractions turn from the red herrings and focus on the word to see Christ and I what this is the warning that we're giving to the church just as a caution the red herons throw us off the track and it's that once once you've allowed once you've picked up the scent of the red heron and if you just begin to step after it just a little bit you'll get far away from your goal get far away from what matters we've been doing this as an exercise in our family since Sunday everything's a red herring right whenever you have a conversation no matter what you're talking about it's been me I'm the guilty party but you bring it back to a red herring but try this in your own in your own families whether it be a discussion with one of your children or between spouses that when you're trying to talk about an issue watch how easy it is for red herring to come up and then all of a sudden you're arguing the red herring and the red herring and the red herring and then you stop and you go wait a minute how did we end up here we're not even talking about the issue anymore way out over here debating something totally different why you followed the trail of the red herring and it gets you so far from what really counts to where this is just practical advice for any relationship so this is the bonus for being here on a Wednesday night before Thanksgiving is this is something to be in tune for because it'll keep you from solving just natural everyday problems whenever the red herring kind of sticks its head up you gotta like no I think that I got to recognize that that's something ancillary that's that's something maybe closely related or something tangential to this but it's not the real core this is not something that really matters we've got to come back to the goal because the red herrings throw us off track and I feel compelled to share this with you just to close with this thought that we are and I think I might have a oh you can use the slide now I think I have there we're entering into a very noisy season and and I mentioned noise I've been looking at the subject of noise and uh every sense is going to be enticed every when I say since every thought every ambition every desire is going to be targeted and and I can I'll just speak for myself personally right now as a personal testimony I'm fine I'm great but there's going to be something start getting inside my head tomorrow about all the Black Friday deals and I'd be wondering I probably should get that vacuum at Home Depot or I mean I've always wanted a really really really big trash can or can you believe it these gloves are only 2.99. and there's going to be things that you're just drawn like I got to get this this is this is a great deal and it's like you're you don't even scuba dive you know like but it's cheap it's like half price what if one day I want to do it and so there's a lot of things that are just bombarding us and and it's easy maybe to draw to it now in the time that we're living in or the season that we're coming into where it's coming from every angle we're being bombarded with it and there's ways that they're trying to entice us and and I think if you could just think about yourself how you feel fine you don't need anything else you're perfectly happy everything's working just fine but all it takes is just one email right from anthropology and you realize you know what maybe I could use more candles and and you're drawn to it and you're thinking this is everything was fine but now a Signal's been sent out and it starts working as I and I'm not saying any of this is wrong right these are the but these could be weights right I've learned my lesson in traveling don't carry on candles because the TSA is going to want to swab all 22 of them and they're they're heavy too but the in the terms of the noise and I say tis the season noise right it's just noise that comes and this is something that maybe we'll amplify it in Greater detail through some other services but the body is actually designed a human body is designed to react to environmental noise whether you realize it or not even while you're sleeping the body picks up on noise and the body's in tuned to things and can hear things and so even if you don't realize it the body responds to sound the body's responding to signals it's responding to things so even while you're sleeping you may not wake up but your body's responding to certain things that's why you could actually have dreams and in your dreams something's happening and you're incorporating other stimuli that you're actually hearing or feeling into your dream because the body's going to respond to it not unless it's maybe a very very deep thought or a very broad a more complex thought than we're amplifying tonight but there's our body will respond to noise and so it responding to noise let's just say there's a price to be paid if you're in a noisy environment and so in the time that we're living let's say if we enter in tomorrow's Thanksgiving Friday's Black Friday are we that Friday is Black Friday and as we go forward into these other things and we go forward into these uh this time of year in these Seasons it's very important for us to recognize and to realize that there's a lot of things that start getting into a fervor pitch and kind of get us excited and there's a lot of agitation and there's a lot of noise that's going to be in the world and so I'd say tis the season to be focused because there's a sub there's a subconscious price for entertaining red herrings and you may not recognize it you may not realize it and I want you to maybe draw that back we're not just talking about Thanksgiving and Christmas we're talking about in our daily lives there's a subconscious price to be paid for falling after red herrings and there's a spiritual price to be paid for Domin allowing red herons to dominate our attention so much just as a type this is a statement I came across one time people who live in cities experience chronically elevated levels of stress hormones and the people said amen people live in cities experience chronically elevated levels of stress hormones hormones especially cortisol increase one's blood pressure contributing to heart disease and cellular damage noise harms your body and boils your brain this is the conclusion this is what noise will do environmental noise these things it harms your body it boils your brain so just even noise making and sounds and certain things are harming your body and boiling your brain and even the word noise that it can be used in a sense of a even to being a pleasant sound and it can be used as a an utterance to get someone's attention but it means a clamor it there's one theory that it comes from the Latin word nausea meaning to discuss to annoy or discomfort another another theory traces it to a from an old French word to the Latin noxia which means to heart or to injure or to damage so we look at in that sense where there's the noise that hurts us there's noise that damages us there's noise that is a disgust it's an annoyance it causes nausea and this is I'm putting red herrings now this is where maybe there was a little bit of a switch in terminology red herrings are noise right it's things that are designed a flood of information a flood of opinions and news and facts and figures and all sorts of takes on different things and the politicization of uh events it's all trying to come and disturb our peace and deserve disturb our tranquility and you'd be better off staying away from them they've done a number of studies that kind of examined the difference between living in a calm Place uh you were in where you could maybe be out in the country or living in a place with a bunch of commotion or living in the midst of a city and the conclusion was every single study arrived at the same conclusion that noise and distraction are toxic and there's so much to be said about this noise and distraction are toxic red herons are toxic and and this I'm not talking about the actual fish that's is pickled and smoked and salted and that you eat maybe it is maybe it is a point at which you can eat so much of it it becomes toxic but a red herring in that analogy sense and that type of something that distracts it's toxic it is it is something that distracts it is something that is uh disturbs us it's it's noise and therefore it's toxic and the message perseverant brother Brown says the trouble of it is today that we American people are always looking for something big and bright and I kept thinking of that Christmas song may your days be merry and bright right and God don't do that something noisy what we look for is something big bright and noisy that's what that's what we like something that's big bright flashy noisy God can draw more water with the sun in five minutes than we can pump out of a noisy pump in 40 days I like that he says sure but we're looking for something big and noisy God is looking for something that is small and quiet now he's using the example of Elijah and and where he was out in that he's out in the cave and he says uh and there's the call that comes to him or there's he's told to go hide out in the cave and the Lord says the Lord pass by passes by and there was a wind earthquake and fire right maybe not in that order but there's this these things happen and those are the effects of God's passing by but none of it moved the prophet because he said those there's things that God can do and there's certain effects and we can say that can become the distraction that's what has the preeminence we talked about majoring on a minor a lot of people major on a minor yeah that comes from God but that's not the major you can only major on a major here he is Elijah's there he says the Russian wind the Thunder the smoke the earthquake none of those things ever attracted the prophet Elijah when he was in the cave but when he heard that still Small Voice God was in there he's in the still Small Voice not the big and flashy not the noisy then he come walking forth none of the rest of it could attract him it's something there's got to Anchor something's got to take place and so in this is just as this word of caution and this series is where these two Services were wrapping up on a red hair in a rainbow trout the rainbow trout is the word of God it's the third pull and there's a way that the world has dressed up the red herring there's a way that they've made it big and flashes a lot of things that get our attention it signals it's noise it's a lot of things that draw but that's not where God is God is stealing the still Small Voice he's in the simple things not in the great big flashy things something big and bright something noisy is what people want to run after he says but we're looking for something big and noisy God's looking for something that's small and quiet that's still small voice that rainbow trout and so picking up that thought again and or brother random in the Victory Day saying man wants to look at it in his own way and he sees so much to the Natural that he fails to take the spiritual application of the word that the word gives he says in the victory day and this kind of sum everything up I think it's a great summary quote because it pulls from all these different splittings and makings of differences where it doesn't matter he says now in that you see like our Pentecostal groups it's the grass root of that and he's talking about just even this uh the divisions what they do they get the focus well now here's a woman completes like lightning well there's no doubt about that at all absolutely I heard some women preachers could preach that men could even stand in the shadow a shadow of doing it but that doesn't have one thing to do with what's righteous see it doesn't have one so there's something that says something can be true but what is it in light of the word of God it says Paul said if one speaks in tongues there'd be no interpreter then let him hold his peace say I can't hold my peace but the Bible said you can see so that's it so these little things where there's these hair splitting these divisions and maybe so that's maybe not exactly hair splitting but it's these things where people don't want to come back to the word of God he says it must be done in order placed in order put in its right place and there remain ever in its place see there you get out of focus that was the main thing you see these examples he's using how things get out of focus and like oh but they can preach like lightning you're focused on the wrong thing I can't hold my peace it doesn't matter you're focused on the wrong things that causes hard feelings greed and so forth that's what causes hard feelings that's what causes splits that's what causes divisions when the focus isn't on the word of God he says instead of focusing ourselves back with the word we focus ourselves out and see well let them do what they want what they see see like that just the way then now we find that it breaks up the fellowship of homes it breaks up the fellowship of churches it breaks up the fellowships of Nations that same thing what is it a lack of focus a lack of focus is what causes it so if we all focused on the right thing then we'd stay we'd stay in Union and let me say this we're never given permission to take our Focus off the word of God for the sake of unity so you say oh well let's we all want to be one big happy family well I want to be focused together and well this group's pulling this way to do this alone and we're getting a lot of pressure on this side that we've got to do this there's a lot of pressure to do that and we never take our Focus off the word of God for the sake of broader Fellowship for the sake of drawing a bigger Circle as it were we cannot do that so it ever Remains the Same as if we all focused on the word of God there'd be Unity so where does the division start as soon as we take our eyes off the word of God and then there comes that pressure to conform by taking our eyes off the word of God but then that's he says that's what breaks up Fellowship of homes it's what causes hard feelings it's what breaks up churches fellowships among churches and so in a similar thought brother branham's preaching this Victory Day then the very next week and the sermon look it might have actually been here in Phoenix he says we must cope Our Lives and focus it in to the word of God just like that we would a picture camera or try to get the right Focus before we snap it and then we've got the real true picture tis the season for family pictures right they said the time of year where everyone fights goes out and finds or buys matching outfits and thinks of the best place to get pictures and think of all the effort that's put into getting that shot to put on the Christmas cards right can we all agree that's what why people aren't here tonight is they're getting family pictures right or at least the neighbor in the apartment next door he says just like getting a camera picture camera you try to get the right Focus before we snap it and then we got the real true picture think of all the effort in getting the shot just right he says that's what we want to do with our lives cope Our Lives to focus it in on the word of God that's what we want to do to focus our lives into Jesus Christ and I love this phrase that Christ and you become the same person think about that in terms of focus if you have something out of focus sometimes you see two but then when you get it focused in those binoculars or something once you get the glass just right those two images come together and you no longer singing seeing two you see the saying and that's what that's what we want to do as long as there's a red herring there's going to be a division it's going to be a separation but if you can get your eyes off of this and focus in on the word of God then you in Christ he says focus our lives into Jesus Christ that Christ in you become the same person let's not get distracted in this endeavor let's go let's not get distracted in our desire to see that Christ have the preeminence so I say for Thanksgiving let's enjoy some rainbow trout Happy Thanksgiving to all of you thank you so much for coming out to the house the lord it's been a privilege being with you let's Stand Together
