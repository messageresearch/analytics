TRANSCRIPT
========================================
revelations chapter 3 verse 13 i'd like to read verse 11 to verse 18. and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exercises all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 603 score and six let's bow our heads in prayer heavenly father thank you lord for bringing us to this place this evening to be in fellowship lord we know that there's several that cannot be here we think of sister sandy contradius her and brother victor lord at home and her unable to be in service with us lord we know it's her desire to be in service and lord we pray that you would touch her father continue to mend her wounds and comfort her as she is unable to be here lord there's others that we could think of that circumstance keeps them from gathering together with us and we pray that you'd bless them that you'd be with them that you'd encourage them lord we've felt from the very beginning lord that it's our desire to serve and that the the church is here to serve and lord we don't sit by with an attendance role and take attendance lord and see who's here and who's not here but when one isn't here lord we notice the lord we desire that you'd help them strengthen them and encourage them in whatever situation they may be in and father tonight as we have gathered we recognize that it's your grace that's caused us to be here and now gathered in your presence with one another with your grace made manifest before us we pray that you'd come take these words which we have read thus far make them alive to us by revelation take lord whatever it would be that you've burdened me with father that i i put on paper through quotations of the prophet and scriptures from our bible and you take a hold of it lord you deliver it to the people's hearts you rightly divide the word of truth and you quicken it to them lord that goes beyond just recitation lord and goes beyond just repeating things but it's something that you do and i pray that you do that tonight we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you may be seated i'm kind of continuing on the subject of you were made for this and i found that there certainly is so much here that god has quickened and i'm hoping to hoping to finish uh tonight and it's just me just me saying i hope hope to finish the subject tonight but it was born from just sensing the stress with the pressure that was coming with the uncertainties related to uh the election um even the pandemic and economic things social things and just a lot of different statements of brother branham that we try to bring into view bring into focus could it be this could it be that and so we were we were pondering the current current events and things that were going to be happening and we wanted just to get outside the realm of presumption and speculation and just look to the word of god and anchor in what he said would be and one thing we can say is regardless of what's coming you're made for it that he's made a promise he's going to look out after you he's going to keep you he's going to take care of you so there's nothing coming upon the earth that he does didn't know already was coming and there's nothing prophesied to come upon the earth that we and we may have a clear understanding of things that are to come but we ought not to fear it and let me ask it this way if you're a member of the bride should you be afraid of tribulation even though it's a reality even though it is going to come upon the earth the great tribulation is going to come up on the earth we should not be in fear of it because we know that god is going to take us out of this earth before it comes therefore no matter what's prophesied we look to the promise we look to the word of god and we anchor the fact that he loves us he cares for us and anything coming my way is either going to perfect me or he's going to protect me he's not going to let anything happen to you that he's not going to use for his glory and for your benefit therefore we shouldn't stress we shouldn't tense up we shouldn't act out of fear we shouldn't let go of our confession of faith we shouldn't be driven by certain things that are more national force more natural things but just stay steady in the word of god and so the title you were made for this might not seem like it it carries through some of these things that we're teaching on as it relates to the modern events and the end time conditions but it's i want that to be the overall theme as we're looking at this so you can gain confidence in who you are and what god's made you to be in this end time and the statement that we used at the very end last time okay and we say it because we're looking at the thought of if if we could lose the fear of death and realize we have power over death that's the greatest and the least we we have we shouldn't fear anything and so we're focusing on maybe scriptures and prophecies and things that point to people having to give their lives at the end time people are going to have to die people have to shed their blood and recognize that the bride as a whole is not prophesied to have to shed her blood in order to go in the rapture in order to become a rapture worthy that that's not a prophecy to the bride and so we're looking at death and we're coming to the place where we can say death i'm not afraid of you if we had to give our lives the bride would do it she's that sold out she's that secure and brother branham says he writes this in the church age book chapter 4 often we think that it would be almost impossible to be a martyr and i would admit that if as i ponder i think man it just it seems like such a difficult proposition in this time would i be willing to give my life knowing that i have a five-year-old at home knowing i have three children other you know 12 10 and 9 and i have a wife and am i willing just to give my life and leave them leave them behind and there's a lot of a lot of thought process that can go into it you think i just don't know if i could be a martyr and brother i'm saying often we think it would almost be impossible to be a martyr he says but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to triumph in christ jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycarps and all martyrs so it is a faith that's anointed we have the faith for it and if that's what you're going to be called to do it's going to be anointed so he says the supreme faith will give supreme grace for the supreme hour and that's the time that we're living in we're living in the time of the supreme and we're living in a time where this kind of faith is precious and it's the faith of god's elect the supreme faith will give supreme grace for the supreme hour and just a few statements still continuing in review as there's other statements brother ram talks about persecution of the church he talks about church doors being closed and becoming a storehouse and and i felt just to maybe leave those statements aside uh even though there's you can watch it unfolds in certain brother references brother browner makes and i'll say this maybe just to to to add this to clarify there's at least three different instances where brother branham's talking about the church church doors being closed and becoming a storehouse and he says i've read it already and he makes reference to the fact that the lutheran minister had written a document that basically laid it out that if you weren't part of the this organization a part of this charter and the world council of churches that they could use your facility pull your charter or they could come and use your church for a storehouse or close the church doors and so this luther minister was saying it's already in writing he was putting it out there and he was suggesting this and brother branham reads that and then brother brown says hey i've already read it this is what they're saying they're going to do it's already in writing that this is what they're going to do to your churches if you don't join up with this so brother branham was basing certain things he said on the things that were being said by this lutheran and people are writing people are saying so he's basing a lot of these things on what he's hearing and what he's seen behind the thought process of these organizations and these denominations and so there's other statements that brother battle makes and christ is a mystery god revealed and even there in 63 that refer to this but we've been looking more particularly at the message look away to jesus and we can see that the word is prophesying of a persecution and a pressure and even a tightening and the word does not prophesy of what we call the squeeze or persecution in order to cause anxiety we shouldn't read look away to jesus we shouldn't read these statements about closing the church doors and putting a dead bolt on it and all those different things in order to cause fear if anything it was if it was thus saith the lord they're gonna put a dead bolt on our church doors and we think well there's gonna be another place to meet amen and earlier this year when all the state home orders were hidden and nobody was able to go to church i told elizabeth i said we're either getting out of here within a number of days or we're getting back to church amen because there's a god-ordained way that our faith is enriched and the way that we come into the knowledge of the son of god and we come into the unity of the faith and to the stature of a perfect man and going to church as part of that amen and we don't live to go to church we go to church to live but we realize you can't stay at home and be a christian you can't stay at home and live the same kind of life and so there's a important part of this dynamics right now where we gather together that god uses to bring us to and is using to bring us to a place of rapture and faith so if this ceased and we could not gather then you might as well just expect to leave it's got to come to that place where god's going to take us take us out of here because this is such a crucial part so there's no reason to fear there's nothing to fear and look away to jesus these things he talks about where foundation point or a beginning point of what he was trying to say look away to jesus it wasn't the conclusion what you should walk away with uh when listening to look away to jesus or reading it is not all there's going to be a squeeze but rather i better stay in this word i want to stay looking at jesus christ i want to be focused on the right things and so our attention should be on christ and and not solely on the crisis if your attention is on the crisis you've got some of the letters right right you're close but you need to be focused on christ not the crisis and if we can just keep our eyes on christ then then we can have confidence in any crisis we can actually just look for him in any difficulty if there's a crisis look for christ within the crisis i'm going to i'm going to look for christ in there if there's a fire look for him in the fire if there is if there's some kind of if there's trouble trouble you're in the raging sea and there's troubled waters look for him to come walking on the water there's there's no fearful thing coming there's no fearful situation there's no difficulty calamity where you shouldn't start looking around saying i need to look for jesus i need to look away from all my carnal feelings all my apprehension all my dread no matter what kind of calamity what kind of a disaster it may seem to be coming upon me i need to be looking for jesus and what a lesson it's so to me and i feel like just so much inspiration is bubbling in my heart right now he says he says this when talking about the third pull and think about how precious this open to the word is to us that no matter what's happening we need to focus on the truth that's revealed in the word and brother branham when this whole concept i say concept of a third pool and it's the angel that used that language god that used that language to brother branham when he's given that vision that has those three parts of lace and a booty and fishing and then that cathedral or that tent which says this will be the third pull this is the language of god that he uses and so there was the first pull second pull and third pull when this vision came to brother branham it came to him on a night that he had just come off the field preaching had considered himself a failure said he wasn't going to be holding any more meetings and was going to go try to get his old job back by talking to his old boss the next day he's going to go get a job again going to go work a regular nine to five wasn't going to be an evangelist anymore wasn't going to be having meetings in prayer lines and his son disagreed with him his wife disagreed with him he's like you know what i'm a failure it was no success after all these years of signs and wonders and the dead being raised and going around the world brother branham was quit he's going to quit doing it and that night after billy paul said dad i think brother billy paul was making a i think you're making a horrible mistake his wife disagreed with nope i'm going to go ask for my old job back i'm coming off the field and that night god gave him the vision of the third pool the vindication of his ministry what we appreciate and loved the most so in the moment where he felt like he was a bitter failure god wanted to say the third pool's coming and that's and i think it should speak to us in the same way when we feel like we're we we've lost our way and it's come to an end and and there's uh and i don't see any way out of this and i've been a failure just keep looking just keep looking and so we've been looking at um we've been quoting donald rumsfeld the great uh general donald rumsfeld secretary of defense and how he said in the gulf war that there was no knowns there were known unknowns but then there were unknown unknowns and you're thinking how could you know you it's a it's an unknown you don't know and he was making a very good point to the media that day and i've been using it just as a basis to say we should focus on the known knowns and there's certain known unknowns we don't know how it's going to be and there's certain prophecies that could still be in symbolic form we don't know exactly how it's going to play out and so we're looking at the known knowns and what we've seen already in the scripture in the in the bible unknown known as it this is a right now it's a spiritual persecution of the bride and it comes by way of deceit it's very cunning it comes with flatteries it's aligned with matthew 24 24 it can be so close that it could deceive the very elect it comes by way of a twin or an impersonation so the real challenge in the world real test to the bride is a word test it's a challenge to stay with the word of god stay with the truth of this hour walk in the light that's the real challenge that we're facing not to give our lives and shed blood but stay in the word of god and we know that it is a spiritual persecution upon the bride and when i say that it's things that relate to the word of god it comes in a spiritual sense in a religious sense in not an economic sense and then also a known known we saw last time is how before this pale horse begins to ride in that fullness of its power to bring a physical persecution on all those who do not bow to that system and take part of that system the bride comes under the anointing of a flying eagle so before this pale horse can come into the fullness of its power the bride's under this anointing of a flying eagle to go meet the lord in the air and so we're not we're not thinking oh how in the world am i going to defend myself against the pale horse the the anointing to combat the pill horse that's coming in its fullness upon laodicea is a rapturing anointing and so we were looking at this uh this persecution how it comes and the persecution of the bride is because of her spiritual revelation of the word that's why the devil is howling it's a revelation of the word of god that's given solely to you and and that's not expressed to try to put a period on who's in and who's out and it's not expressing the way to try to make ourselves feel that we're special but it's the truth that it's to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom to others it is not given amen and so when brother bannon says watch the third pull it's to look at the third pool keep your eyes focused on the right thing because the persecution or the squeeze works in a way to attempt to separate you from the power of the word of god it's an attempt to keep you from the open of the word keep you from the revelation of jesus christ brother brandon said don't let somebody squeeze something into you that's not thus saith the lord so the squeeze is trying to squeeze something into you as we looked in the scripture in revelations chapter 9 those 200 million demons are loosed upon the bride are now working according to feasts of the trumpets are now working in an ecclesiastical realm working in a religious way it's not working boldly through politics it's not working through a government legislation it's not working that way here in america and and we should we should recognize very quickly that when they stay at home orders were instituted this was uh this was upon uh all sorts of businesses this was on all sorts of churches it wasn't that they said well if you believe god sent a prophet and his name's william branham you can't go to church now that would have happened we said whoa now this has manifested itself a lot this is hit and that's different than it's hitting everybody else so there's when it's churches were closing and grocery stores were closing and everything was closing uh we can't try to think it force in our minds oh here it is this is that spiritual persecution this is where it's coming to a razor's edge well no everyone had to stay home catholics pentecostals presbyterians episcopalians they were all staying at home they were all closing their doors so you couldn't take these things happen and put in the category this is where the power is coming to do this but we can say we look how easy it can happen you can see how certain things are being put in place and certain things are happening and certain things are adding up and measuring up there's no doubt things are being added up and measuring up but that's going to work on some but that's not what the bride's worried about she's not worried about those things because before it fully joins with political power this ecclesiastical power before it joins with the political power the bride's going to be gone in a rapture because you'll notice in the scripture i think there's some of these things we'll be able to express tonight that physical persecution these judgments are these things that come down upon the people it's god's judgment upon the church and the word judges god's bride we're receiving our judgment now we avail ourselves to it it's correcting us it's shaping us it's perfecting us but we'll go in a rapture and then what falls is the judgments of god upon those that are left so in revelations chapter 13 and brother branham uh points out how this beast of the sea it's one that comes out of the multitudes of the people and and he relates this to it's the roman catholicism it's this mystery babylon but then when he speaks of the beast coming out of the earth he relates this to the united states how it was a nation that was born now uh not out of people but in the in the pilgrims coming to america and coming to this land that by the time the pilgrims have got here the the explorers that came before had brought diseases into into this this land that so devastated the indigenous populations to where they were decimated by the time that the pilgrims began to come over here and establish colonies in north america disease had already ravaged it and and there was crusades and different things that would come behind it a and a lot of people giving their lives the disease and my you go back and look at how the catholic church performed these crusades that you'd have conquistadors and different ones that actually go to the indigenous people and say either accept the doctrine of the church or you're all going to die and this was happening in the name of the church no wonder people don't like church no wonder christianity has a bad name in a lot of places but brother brown points some of those things out the historical elements out but revelations 13 11 it represents the united states as a lamb with two horns speaking as a dragon and the lamb it points out that this this refers to the united states it begins innocently how does it begin with freedom of religion but then it turns to where it begins to speak as a dragon which represents rome or roman catholicism pagan rome then papal rome and brother branham and i'm just taking these things from the message then brother branham talk shows how those two horns and he says this in a number of places that the two horns is a uniting of civil power and ecclesiastical power so it's a uniting of religious power and political power and he talks about how it joins to church and state how these things are going to line up and then we know ultimately it speaks of a uniting then of all denominations all the daughters under mystery babylon under the one harlot she's the mother of all denominations that there's going to be adjoining together and brother branham refers to this ecumenical movement and the world council of churches and how they're all head up and he identifies the election of john f kennedy as a catholic as fulfilling some of these things in part because he says remember that vision in 1933 i saw this this coming together and he says and i live to see it with my own eyes and so it's many of these things have already been fulfilled in brother branham's eyes these this joining together these manifestations uh uh whether it be these prophecies of night from 1933 and this powerful woman raising up but we know there's a time when church instead are going to unite together and then there's going to come to the place as we read in revelations chapter 13 where it begins to act upon the people in a way to bring persecution and force worship and if you don't you're going to lose your life now brother branham and feast of the trumpets identifies revelations 13 and he says now right now it's loosed he says loosed in the ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon what not up upon the denominations upon the bride in an ecclesiastical way not in a political way not in a civil way not in the state way but in the ecclesiastical realm in the church realm it's released upon the bride he says but here you'll get it the bride will not go through that time the bible says not the church will but not the bride and as we saw this last sunday that time he's referring to the slaughter he's referring to the time where there's a uniting of the civil power the state and the ecclesiastical power the religious power a uniting of church and political religious and political to where it will materially and physically persecute those who do not align itself with its doctrine and line itself with its system and brother branham's saying that the bride will not go through that time so let's not let's not look for that time and this would be my emphasis because please if i seem to be very definitive i am not saying thus saith the lord there won't be suffering i'm not saying thus saith the lord will not be persecution i'm not saying brother bannon said there wouldn't be persecution i'm not saying brother bam said church doors wouldn't be closed or that what he said isn't true i'm saying that when it comes to this brother brandon when it comes to that place where this full power is exercised upon the people we're gone but even right now there's church doors that are closed message church doors that are closed around the world preachers that are thrown into jail ministers that are in prison for standing for this truth so those things are being accomplished but when it comes to right here in america revelations 13 these things come into pass brother brown's identifying that there's a spirit on the bride that raptures her and the rest of the bride worldwide will go with her this can be raptured before these things come into the fullness of their power now in the chapter 10 of the church age book and the resume of the ages brother branham is looking at this very place in scripture revelations chapter 13 he reads actually verses 11 to 18 right after he says this the false group church groups will come together in a world council of churches this world council of churches is the image erected to the beast and then he reads revelations chapter 13 verses 11 to 8. so it's false church groups that come together under the image of this beast the false church groups do so then he says this and i'm skipped several places in this reading but he says thus all the people have to belong to this world church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the hand or head now before we take that and start speculating that a mask could be that that mark because you can't go into trader joe's without a mask and they wouldn't they wouldn't sell me my juice cleanse at nectar the other day because i didn't have a mass so you can't buy or sell without a mask hold on now just relax a little bit right i think sometimes people listen to too much talk radio stream too many podcasts and you're when you you realize when you believe some of that stuff you're actually believing what the denominations believe because that's what they're preaching that's what john hagee's preaching that's what some of these other guys out there is preaching and we start buying into it like man did you know did you know did you know that we're all going to have to wear a mask that has a barcode on it and you're when you shop you have to go [Music] right and so just slow down a little bit he says this mark in the head means that they will have to take the doctrine of the world church system which is trinitarianism and the mark of the hand which means to do the will of the world church amen so i can take a known known here i don't know what's going to happen after we're gone people have chips in their hands if if people have barcodes on their heads i'm let them sort that out but i know for me right now is to believe the doctrine and to support it amen that those are the marks right that's a known known if there's multiple levels how it's compound prophecy and different things can be fulfilled i'm not putting the period on it i'm gonna let god interpret it by bringing it to pass but he's showing that it's gonna be a religious world system that comes together it's gonna come to a time he says where if you aren't a part of the system then you're gonna have to rely upon the elements now that seems like oh i'm going to be left out now to where i won't be able to engage in a particular economy and listen he says it this plainly he says with this great power what great power the power of trinitarianism this religious power to of this world council churches the church systems will persecute the true bride church systems will do it theologies ideologies organizations groups and ways of thinking interpretations will persecute the true bride this is this image will try to keep the bride from preaching from preaching and teaching etc they'll try hallelujah through through uh through some intimidation through persecution through ostracization cutting you out of the circle cutting you out of fellowship all these different ways they can do it this is just in the ecclesiastical realm he says her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it now you could read that and say see right there ministers will be forbidden of giving comfort to the bride but that's not what he said he said they'll be forbidden from giving comfort and truth to the people who need it you know who needs it everybody needs it but because of politics because of personality because of persecution because of theology and because of the spirit behind the world council of churches and a denominational spirit the true ministers will not be able to preach truth and give comfort to the people in their congregations why they're pushed out of the pulpit this happens in brother brown's ministry he's no longer able to give the truth and comfort to the people that need it because they pushed him out and it wasn't it wasn't the governments that were doing it was the churches that were doing it and he says you've crucified afresh the son of god he indicted them for the second crucifixion and that wasn't a mandate coming down from jfk that wasn't lyndon b johnson that did it it wasn't governors it wasn't it's senators it wasn't congressman it wasn't anything in a political realm it was religious people that had crucified him again so he says his minister her ministers so they'll try to keep the bride from preaching but she's going to keep on preaching right but the man says she won't be shut up right christ is mr god she won't be shut up should be taken up so before they can shut you up you're going to be taken up and he says they'll be forbidden he says but before the antichrist in person takes over this complete world system of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the lord god will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the lamb so what are you looking for the going away that's what we're looking for i'm not looking for the antichrist to come into his fullness because if i see that based upon the teaching of the message i missed it so if you're waiting for the fullness of that to get rapture in faith that that ship already sailed it's too late it's already gone so we're not looking we don't want to keep looking to modern events and who is there a american cardinal that could become the next pope and who's going to be the next president and we're all worried about all those things let's stay focused on jesus christ focused on the word of god because if we're if if there's certain things coming and certain things that may go into motion and certain laws being passed and it sure looks like it's headed a different direction that's when jesus says look up just keep looking up because that means the translation is coming change of our bodies is coming we're not looking out saying oh no they're gonna shut us up and i won't have food for my children this is gonna happen that's gonna happen no we're getting out of here and let me say this the third pull speaks to provision for everything for the bride i i've been it's i i encouraged just how the trajectory of these things is coming together when we left off speaking on in the beginning god created i was coming to a place where the third pull comes into view god speaking out into creation and then looking at this so much of these five temporary manifestations of the third pull are mentioned in context of persecution tightening and squeeze and the power of the open of the word these five temporary manifestations of the third pull speak to the promise that the bride has in the fullness of the word regardless of what it is physical healing salvation of your children the the the walking with god and the the the the defeating of cancers the care and love for your wife all these different things are mentioned and even to the point where there's provision in the open of the word if it relates to food because brother branham when he when he spoke squirrels into existence brother bam wasn't just hunting for sport he was hunting for food amen and so there is a there is a a provision that is spoken to there's a promise spoken to in five temporary manifestations to where we realize now with the fullness of the word and us being the fullness of the expression of that word we're not fearing our children we're not fearing for food we're not fearing for anything we're resting in the promise of god's word he said before it comes to this place the bride's going to be taken away in a rapture taken away for this world from this world to be with the lord god will catch away his bride so be before it comes to that place where you're pressed out before it comes to a place where there's it's gonna these things are being manifest you're already gone in luke chapter 21 verses 33 to 36 it says heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away now think of that heaven and earth will pass away but his word will not pass away his words shall not pass away take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life so whether there be some excess there's some carelessness so some some a lack of moderation in cares of this life i'm so bowed down by the pressures of laodicea he says so that that day come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth there's that that day's coming but remember we're believing that brother man says the bride will not go through that time so we want to he take heed ourselves and not let our hearts be overwhelmed and he says because this snare is going to come upon everyone that dwells upon the face of earth he says watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man that that speaks to me that speaks to me in the context of luke 21 the context of matthew 24 it speaks to me to believe that what i must do is watch the word watch what he has said pray always that i may be counted worthy to escape the snare that's going to come upon all them that dwell upon the face of the whole earth that i'll be counted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and where will i be standing in the presence of the son of man in the presence of jesus christ in his glorified body with a glorified body to match his glorified body with the rest of the resurrected saints in their glorified bodies that's what if we can stay connected and tethered to the word of god i'm not worried about having to give my life in this realm i'm not worried about the things that are coming upon the earth yes there'll be individual challenges your family will be challenged there's people that'll lose their jobs there's people that'll despair for food there's believers that will despair for life there's sicknesses there's disease there's divorce there's tribulation that we suffer in a personal level and we'll all have to meet that with faith and the supreme faith will give us supreme grace for the supreme hour but when it comes to a prophecy of the elect she is under a prophecy of a translation she is under a promise of provision that's what we rest in and so we're watching the word of god we're watching the third pool we're staying with his words that shall not pass away heaven and earth will pass away but his word shall never pass away so he says watch that you might be counted worthy you're counted worthy you are the ones that are worthy to escape the things that are coming upon the earth because watch because god brings away a vicks gate in the message of noah that was telling that rain was coming upon the earth and everyone would be slaughtered there was a promise of an ark so the very the very warnings of judgment look for the way where is it in this prophecy of this and the prophecy of that and all these statements these terrible things that are coming upon the earth where's the way of escape i made reference to it maybe last week how that brother man i'm talking about these plagues coming upon the earth and only those who have the holy ghost will escape it right i believe i actually have those scriptures here tonight to get to it but they're contained in revelations 19 they're contained in different places where brother branham or they they're parallel to these places in scripture we realize brother branham is pointing to a time of tribulation under the sixth seal when the bride is gone the very scriptures he's referencing of these things that are coming upon the earth he said all those who have the holy ghost are not going to be impacted by it think well how can this be how can this be and you realize the mystery of that is the bride's translated when that time comes so look for the way of escape and listen if there's something that look well brother aaron i can't see it it just seems like an airtight case we're all going to have to give our lives brother aaron i can't see it we're all going to have this is going to happen that's going to happen then what i would tell you to do is just take it and lay it there and just leave it there and pray lord show me in this threat of things to come in this prophecy show me my promise show me show me the full take let me take the full word of god in consideration because god brings a way of escape from the snare that shall come upon all them that dwell upon the face of the earth from this great power that's going to come into this man even the manifestation of the antichrist he says in person where these marks come into the image is erected unto the beast this ecclesiastical power joining with political power the revival of church and state united together god provides a way of escape and where is it revelations 18 4. it's in there he says and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues there's plagues coming upon her by virtue of her sins her sins of unbelief and her plagues it's the judgment it's physical persecution it's death all those things are her plagues so he says come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her plagues we're not partakers of her sins and that you received not of her plagues so we have heard revelations 18 4. have you heard it do we believe brother iran identified himself as being one who spoke according to this he is the angel of revelations 18 4 and therefore we have to be here in revelations 18 to have heard this voice that says come out of the system come out of the organization come up from underneath that spirit listen you don't have to have a slash inc on the end of your church name or have a register be registered with the state or or be an official member of a denominational organization to be under denominational spirit i remember years ago brother biscuit was criticized as an organization because he had bibleway.org and man there was a whole group of people saying mark of the beast ah.org you know he had there he was he had it that's why we're dot com but uh but i did register.org um so don't try it or i'll sell it to you how's that anybody want to buy a domain but there's these little little things they start to criticize and it doesn't you don't have to have.org in your url you have to be registered with the state to be under a denominational spirit come under the spirit of a dominating female and to become a church that's characterized by the woman the fallen woman in mystery babylon through spirit through cruelty as opposed to the body of christ which is that the lamb's wife and the new jerusalem so it says come out of her my people this powerful beautiful woman yet cruel right that john was marveled at he says come out of her that you receive not of her plagues and remember the last plague before the rapture is spiritual death the last plague to hit the earth the last plague to hit the church is spiritual death in the exodus the last plague to hit the whole land was death right and that was upon everyone except those who had followed the prophet's message had the token applied had the lamb inside right so we see it a parallel in a type then that this last plague that hits the world and hits the church is spiritual death but only those who have the token who have the lamb inside they're the ones that bypass the spiritual death bill abraham says in the fourth seal like he give egypt he give egypt place to repent what was the last plague was death that's the last plague that hits the pentecostal church which is the laodicean church age it's spiritual death and then he says she's dead that's in the name of the lord she's spiritually dead he gave her place to repent and she rejected it now she's dead she'll never rise again laodicea is not going to rise again there's no revival coming out of leo to see you pentecostal church is not raising again that eve and this is why god hated it so much he had restored even the gifts that were lost that represented the la the one of the last things that was taken away from that church on the day of pentecost it's restored genuine pentecostals and brother ram as a messenger is coming out preaching telling them get back come back come back come back tell them and they reject it and he says she's dead when the seals are being opened she's dead in the name of the lord she's spiritually dead that's the plague that's come upon her she's rejected it she's now dead she'll never rise again so what do you need not a revival of that woman but a message to call you out of it amen she says come out of her my people because the bride hadn't received her revival yet but what was her revival the revealing of the seven seals the manifestation of god to wake her up again that's what brother branham says when he's preaching those seven seals so here we see that the last plague upon the earth is spiritual death the last plague upon the church is spiritual death and we receive a message come out of her so we have life revelations chapter 19 verses 7 to 9 as brother banham said that the bride is going to be taken away to the marriage supper of the lamb where does the union take place takes place here right now so you're not called away to the marriage but the marriage supper revelations chapter 19 verses 7 to 9 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb why are they blessed just go back and read what they miss they're missing these vials that come forth under the sixth seal they're missing these things that are mentioned here before the tribulation upon the earth the the hailstones that are coming all these different things that are come upon the earth the bride misses those things it says blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he says and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god and i fell at his feet to worship him now in this i see an example or type of us in our message of revelations 18 4 come out of her my people and he said to me see thou doest did not i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy so we never want to make the mistake of worshiping william branham we never want to make the mistake of elevating him above scripture elevating him above the word and so we're not worshiping william branham we're not brahmites we're not looking for brother branham to fulfill all the word of god we're looking to jesus christ to bring the fulfillment of all the word of god and he delivered to us a message saying blessed are they which are called into the marriage supper of the lamb because they're going to leave before that time they're going to be under the anointing of the flying eagle to escape this pale horse rider when he comes riding out against the church they're going to be gone in the rapture before the antichrist takes his full control over church and state there's going to be the bride's going to be gone so blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb but who's left those who didn't heed what this revelations 19 10 said he said don't worship me i'm your fellow servant one that has the testimony of jesus christ he says worship god don't worship me and brother branham writes in the church age book chapter 5 he said then there is elijah to whom the word of the lord came when he got through preaching the truth and that group back there that this for that this is the forerunner of the american jezebel group would not receive the word god called him off the field and plagued that generation for rejecting the prophet in the message that god had given how are they plagued spiritual death right that's a known known they're plagued with spiritual death but notice it comes upon those that reject the prophet and the message that's given he says this in the seventh seal now we're in the eagle age we're in the age of the eagle the revelation to be revealed the whole thing compare this with revelations 10 verses 1 to 7 then in the days of the sound of the seventh angel's message was to finish up all the mysteries of god we find out also that the sixth seal now being opened it was for a threefold purpose so let's contrast this the eagle age the eagle anointing the revelation of the seven seals revelations 10 1 to 7 the mighty angel descended with the book open but now the sixth seal that's opened for a threefold purpose he said here was the purpose the first thing was that the sleeping virgins have to go through the tribulation period for purification she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period so the tribulations that to come is to purge for what rejecting the message brother said they reject the atonement in its fullness so the plagues the judgment the persecution it comes upon those that have actually rejected the true message they've rejected the heartbeat of it the revelation of it they rejected the truth rejected the truth of it so the tribulation under the sixth seal is upon those who are left who do not go under the eagle anointing of revelations 10 amen because the seventh seal is to the bride it is christ it results in a marriage that takes you away to the marriage supper you're not left for those things under the sixth seal they're not for you because it's a threefold purpose the persian of the foolish virgin the purging of israel and the purging of the earth so if it's under the sixth seal it doesn't apply to you you could even see how the fourth seal applies to the judgment of laodicea and death the fifth seal relates to martyrs the sixth seal to the purge of the foolish virgin persian of israel the purging of the earth the seventh seal is yours it's christ the mighty angel descended to receive you unto himself to take you out of here to escape all those things that have come you should rejoice that you've been counted worthy to escape the tribulation that's to come and listen i believe we ought to preach it to give you confidence that if you stay in the word of god and have faith then you're more than able to take what's coming and not try to put you under some kind of fear to bind you close to this pulpit better stick with us here better be with us you're not going to be able to make it and try to put fear into you that you need to resort to some kind of humanism to make it through what's coming no i believe god all he has to do is raise up one amen and if you have to just be the one in whatever church you would go to say i'm the one that's been counted worthy it's not a church move it's not a group move it's an individual move that's embodied in this body of christ around the world our brothers and sisters brother adam says this and does that does that resonate with you amen in the message of shame he says you know in the last days they're supposed to be them plagues repeat again all right this is where all the quotes we were looking up back in march right here it is he says and remember an adulterer in the bible time his penalty was death by stoning and the unbelieving church will be stoned to death with hailstones wow was once god's way that he says which was once god's way of punishment he'll stone this unbelieving world this adulterous generation he'll stone it from heaven he's referring to revelation 16 and revelations 19 under the sixth seal that's what he's referring to if you go back and look at what he's what he's quoting from these these stones that weigh a talent a piece he says these hailstones weighing a town a piece which is a hundred pounds the adulterous church will die the adulterous world will die under the punishment of god under stoning like he did in the beginning the plagues coming upon all the earth there's a snare to catch everyone and everyone's going to be subject to it and hailstones will be coming down it's god's righteous judgment upon the world and upon the church for rejecting the message he calls them the unbelieving church and we're not going to be here as spectators sure glad i got my malachi 4-5 umbrella nope you're going to be gone you're out of here i'm trying to go quick i bit off more than i could shoot again he says in god hiding himself in simplicity he's already told us this the rapture then judgments will strike he's already told us the rapture then judgments will strike sin plagues sickness and everything the people cry for death to make them take them from the judgment lord why is this judgment come upon us when you said there would be a rapture first he'll say it's already come and you didn't know it god hiding himself in simplicity oh my all right it's already happened and you knew it not let me just say this and i'm not just trying to use simple logic but i believe this is this is this is scriptural scripturally sound if there is going to be a literal disease come upon all the earth and only those who have the holy ghost do not get it you have just created another evidence of the holy ghost and what does that do to a genuine holy spirit-filled believer puts them in the state of awaiting judgment that a blood test or a nasal swab is going to determine whether or not they're the elect so it takes a genuine holy spirit-filled believer and places them under a state of now judgment where i'm subject to a medical test to determine whether or not i've got the holy ghost and you've created another evidence and you've put the believer out on no there's no solid ground the evidence of the holy ghost is to receive the word amen and any subsequent evidence is no better than speaking in tongues we've got to be careful what kind of theology we build around statements brother man says here these plagues these sins these sicknesses that are coming he says it happens after the rapture oh i thought these things were going to happen oh he's already come he's saying this and god hiding himself simplicity right before he preaches the seals it's already coming you didn't know it god hiding himself in simplicity oh my all right it's already happened and you knew it not why don't believers believe the simple signs of his coming they're expecting all these things that spoke of by the scripture and the sun's going down in the middle of the day and there's going to be all kinds of things i got notes wrote here to show what them things are and we'll get to it on the breaking of these seals this week anyhow there it is just where it's already passed and you didn't know it so if the angel lord will break them seals forth to us they're looking for the judgments to come or they're looking for something to happen before these judgments come and right as he preaches before he preaches they opened the seals he says the the rapture's already come and you missed it when these sins plagues and sicknesses and everything come upon the earth notice how he places it in the god of this evil age he says this naked stripped stripped-off bunch of laodiceans worshiping the god of this world through their ethics and education and shrewdness and prettiness notice notice how he describes them he says come out of her there's your revelations 18 4 be not partakers of her sins and don't receive her plagues follow the prophet as he lays this down very perfectly here god will reign hell out of the skies one day as big as a hundred pounds of peace and will destroy her by stoning her like his word always said he done his laws who is it coming upon the church what is the church the subject to the pale horse rider subject to the antichrist so he says well if god did a thing like that revealed his word to such a people as that he would be defeating his own purpose god is not foolish he's the source of all wisdom so you see where that stuff come from it comes from satan and it's still satan and the church has believed it now if you yeah and i don't think it's super deep here but pause for a moment and notice what he says the judgment is coming upon those to whom god has not revealed himself to he says would god reveal himself to somebody and then judge him like that in other words god's not going to reveal himself to you through the open of the word the third pull and show himself to you the full word be born in a manifestation quicken to the bride you've heard from your theophany you're raptured up quickly to meet it you're feeding an unfailing body word of the son of man and then hailstones are gonna rain down upon you not gonna happen listen not one drop is your motto not one drop is how you ought to see this there's not one drop of tribulation going to strike before the bride's gone you're actually holding away the judgment coming upon the church you're holding away the judgment gonna come upon laodicea you're holding away all these kind of catastrophes and things that are going to come down upon it you're holding it away second thessalonians chapter 2 verses 7 to 15. i'm still i'm still under an hour so i feel i feel like i can just read this and just have a few more a few more jabs and hooks and throws at the devil and wrap it up ii thessalonians chapter 2 verses 7 to 15 for the mystery of iniquity death work doth already work only he who now let us will let until she brother ram said be taken out of the way she is him so she is he until he which is her be taken out of the way and the beautiful brother branham brings that clarity to us that what's holding it away right now is the elect and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming brother branham and i don't have the statements here but brother branham in the seals i can't remember if it's the first seal the third seal he identifies this scripture as transpiring the wicked one being revealed or exposed and then he's asking questions and answers brother branham does the opening of these seals the first seal does it do this ii thessalonians 2 3 says yes so in spiritual now it's revealed to us spiritually he says verse 9 even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all powers and signs and lying wonders and with all deceitfulness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved now he's talking about powers signs and wonders it's what we read about in revelations 13. where it talks about how it he had these great wonders and it makes fire to come down he deceived them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast so all these all this deceivableness and satan work with all powers signs and lying wonders only works on them that perish why because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved from that time save from the deceit saved from the delusion and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie he sent you truth but he sends them delusion that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness this is paul prophesying of this church that take that is under this plague of spiritual death and how if it remains those that remain in this system after the bride is gone all that's left is this mark of the beast this power of of spiritual deception to even work in a physical way to deceive people and he says they'll believe a lie because they didn't love the truth they didn't receive a love of the truth you should thank god that you love the truth he gave you that amen and they're all damned because of it and they're they're not saved but rather they perish then notice verse 13 but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brother and beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation to be saved through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth you are the the he in second thessalonians 2 7 you're the he there you're the one that has spoken of he's bound to give thanks always to god for you because you've been chosen to escape where until he called you by her gospel to the obtaining of the glory of the lord jesus christ therefore brethren stand fast you know what the truth hold the traditions which you've been taught whether by word or our epistle hold fast to the things that you've been taught in this bible and in this message hold fast to them because that's your way of escape that's your safety your love for the truth is your inoculation against deceit it's your it's your uh what i'm trying to think immunization passport i guess we could say i'm trying to think of the word herd immunity well the bride's got it drop the d it's her immunity amen she's got it she's been inoculated and and the way that we achieve that is we all come under the blood we've come under the we've come under the power of the revealed word and satan is ineffective against that he doesn't even know he doesn't even know what to do with it because he don't know what it is these scriptures these things you read there's so many things to share with you but at the end of the day what i'm trying to emphasize to you what i'm hoping i've showed in bits and pieces and different ways that it's come forth is that the bride is secure amen this word is enough could you imagine if we got so desperate that we were more concerned about who was in office than who was being revealed to protect us from the things that had come that we lost hope in the provision of the word of god because the wrong one gets voted in and we despair i read an article and i've clipped it i thought about sharing it with you last sunday how it's in the new york times and they said how the evangelicals when they begin to flock to the republican party that it began as a as a kind of a swell of support for certain platforms and certain things that were held within the republican party but then he said through time the salt has lost its savior and said now evangelical has become more of a political label than a spiritual one and said for evangelicals electing a republican to office has become their goal the goal of an evangelical is to put republicans in every office and they've lost the goal of evangelism that's what it means to be an evangelical is not make sure we have a republican senator and republican congressman from our district and make sure we have republican presidents our goal as evangelicals if you want to use that in the pure sense is to evangelize jesus christ to spread the good news why why would we ever lose hope and despair because of who's in office i i i'm willing to apologize if it seems that i'm making too much political commentary i'm not i i'm trying to express that we ought to be more concerned about christ amen we ought to be more concerned about the word spending more time in the word of god and realize that politics in entertainment and sports and fashion and pandemic numbers and all those things fuels your fear not your faith and you wonder why you begin to despair you wonder why you're thinking this is going to happen and that's going to happen and and mask this and mask that and vaccines this and vaccines that and you're all worried about that stay channeled in the word of god let your faith sort those things out not your fear brother branham says in the message broken cisterns someone called me not long ago from up in the east and said brother branham i hear you moved out to arizona and you formed a place there where there is safety praise god i find myself in that quote brother john don't you see yourself in that quote moving from north carolina arizona don't you all feel good right now and as you know how the message come and the lord told me what would happen in alaska and how down through california it would be and it's just been that way they said now if that's shaking and everything where's the safety zone i said there's one safety zone that i know of that's in christ for those that are in christ will it's the only one i know the only one i know he says is it in arizona no is it in a particular church in arizona no no it's in christ and see the discrepancy he says we find out these statements are both just five days apart from each other we find out god gave his children his word for their defense we have no other defense than the word of god that is our defense there's no bomb shelters no shelter no bombs no shelters no hiding places no arizona's or california's or whatever it is there's only one defense we have and that is the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us which is jesus christ he is our only defense being in him we are safe that's what i'm trusting in amen being in him we are safe job chapter 23 verses 10 to 12 but he knoweth the way that i take and with yet when he has tried me you're going to be tried by his word what brother and i say the test is the greatest thing that's ever happened to you why he says i shall come forth as gold whatever your test is whatever your trial is you're going to come forth as gold and notice the testimony my foot hath held his steps what did jesus say take heed there too to my words that you may be counted worthy to escape brethren stand fast and hold the traditions that you've been taught whether by word or our epistle he says my foot hath held his steps his way have i kept and not declined neither have i gone back from the commandments of his lips this is your safety zone i have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food his word was more important to me than natural bread his word was more important than a green chili burrito enchilada style mixed with cheese from burritos beans and rice on the side all in one plate it was more necessary than that than the machaca deep fried tacos from tp he said it was more important than that i have esteemed the words of his mouth i've esteemed the word more than my necessary he's acknowledging food's necessary to live but his word was more important what's going to keep you amen what should you be worried worried about the short of a shortage of chicken and beef if it comes this winter or the famine for hearing the word of god i thank god that when then this hour there's been a famine for the hearing of the word he raised up something for us to feed on amen and that i esteemed that more precious more precious than my necessary food amen and three kinds of believers brother bram says sometimes believers are put to the test when you have tried me i shall come forth as gold he says not sometimes every time for every son that cometh to god must be chased and tried child trained remember the trials the dusty roads the hot sun of persecution he says but the loyalty the loyalty of your heart beats that material until she's ready to go in the mold the loyalty of your heart he can trust you that's your heartbeat god's children is made up correctly on his word for their living examples and the word of god living through them so the trials dusty roads hot sign of persecution through all of it the loyalty of your heart beats and all that beating is making the material ready that's all it can do to you whatever's to come it can't beat christ out of you it can only bring his image more perfectly in you he says every he says sometimes believers are put to the test he says not sometimes every time what is our test what's the primary test we're facing in this hour the bride showdown is not physical it's not material it's spiritual it's not for money it's not for possessions it's not health but it's the word and where there is where there is a challenge with clothing where there is a challenge with food where there is a challenge where i'm going to lay my head seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you amen brother abraham said and choose another bride sister cassandra if you'd come the true church of christ the bride is so sold out to him and his promised word to the very mind that's in christ is in you he says what a difference what a difference you aren't just the dust of this earth there's a difference you're made of a different material a heartbeat in your heart is a material that can be molded but it says the very boycott will come and maybe this kind of leaves it open for you know more scriptures and quotes on a later time the very boycott will come but in that hour you promised to take your church it'll come but who does it work on those that are left he says but in that hour you promised to take your church he said there should nothing bother us nothing worries us we are his do you believe that amen let's stand to our feet
