[0:00] and um but i i feel like i'm very near
[0:02] just delivering this burden we have on
[0:04] this subject of i am an open book
[0:07] and i just want to jump right into it uh
[0:09] and some of these principles we've been
[0:11] fellowshipping on and all of us here i
[0:13] think have been in these services so you
[0:15] are really in tune to what we're wanting
[0:17] to share
[0:18] we took a statement from christ is the
[0:20] mystery of god revealed and it says and
[0:22] all that's in this book would be him
[0:24] for that's the believer the words in the
[0:27] book and the word is him and he's
[0:29] referring to the seven sealed book he's
[0:30] referring to the book of redemption so
[0:32] he says all that's in this book would be
[0:34] him we know christ
[0:36] even as the seals he's the there's a
[0:38] representation in christ and then he
[0:40] says for that's the believer the words
[0:42] in the book so we've been looking at how
[0:44] the bible has become a new book christ
[0:46] fulfilled the old testament the bride's
[0:48] going to fulfill the new testament
[0:50] christ was the written word made flesh
[0:52] of the prophecies to israel now the
[0:55] bride is going to be the full word made
[0:57] manifest
[0:58] in terms of the promise of the new
[1:00] testament and we've been looking at it
[1:01] in this sense that the believer is the
[1:04] interpretation of the written word today
[1:06] the believer today is the interpretation
[1:08] of the written word and we we're
[1:10] bringing a lot of that out of question
[1:11] and answers on the seals the map says
[1:13] don't interpret it don't interpret it
[1:14] don't interpret it we found that he
[1:16] taught later that the life is the
[1:17] interpretation how you live your life
[1:19] how you love your wives and how you
[1:21] raise your children and how you dress
[1:23] and how you act is going to be an
[1:25] interpretation of the word
[1:27] now if you look at colossians chapter 3
[1:30] i just want to introduce this because
[1:31] i'm wanting to maybe expound upon it to
[1:34] a greater degree in future services and
[1:36] it it's been coming up in my study and
[1:40] kind of been pushing it off a little bit
[1:41] but i want to just read it now and have
[1:44] this scriptural thought in the forefront
[1:46] of your thinking tonight if you then be
[1:48] risen with christ seek those things
[1:50] which are above where christ sitteth on
[1:53] the right hand of god that ought to be
[1:55] uh relevant to all of us if you've been
[1:57] risen with christ if you're born again
[1:59] by the baptism of the holy ghost and uh
[2:01] and you have had this new life inside of
[2:04] you then we ought to be seeking
[2:05] different things and have a different
[2:06] ambition and be desiring other things
[2:09] and things that are natural or earthly
[2:11] so it kind of you begin to set our gaze
[2:13] on the eternal and he says for year dead
[2:16] and your life is hid with christ in god
[2:20] now there's a lot there you are dead we
[2:22] could certainly expound upon that in
[2:24] many different ways how
[2:26] we have um
[2:27] died to the flesh we've died to the
[2:29] things of the world and there's a
[2:30] deadness to the old man
[2:33] but then he says your life is hid with
[2:36] christ so you're hid with christ where
[2:39] in god
[2:40] and and that's putting it in this
[2:42] putting the relationship and position
[2:44] and wanting us to think about where our
[2:45] life is but then he says it's hid with
[2:47] christ in god we know there's a
[2:50] beautiful ways to bring out the hidden
[2:51] life and the the secret life and these
[2:53] things that where your life is hid with
[2:55] christ and god then notice this next
[2:58] statement when christ who is our life
[3:01] so it says your life is hid with christ
[3:03] in god and then it says when christ who
[3:06] is our life so there's your life is hid
[3:08] with christ your life is christ
[3:10] it's really not a separate entity it's
[3:12] not a separate thing where there's just
[3:13] a collection of different lives there in
[3:15] god but he says your life is hid with
[3:17] christ in god so we can look at it this
[3:19] way if you've been risen seek things
[3:21] which are above because your life is
[3:23] there
[3:24] the true life that what you what you
[3:26] crave and what you long for
[3:28] and so he says you're dead and your life
[3:30] is hid with christ in god in christ when
[3:33] christ who is our life shall appear
[3:36] then shall ye also appear with him in
[3:38] glory
[3:39] i want you to think very deeply about
[3:41] that i want you to think in ways that
[3:43] how can this become applicable and
[3:45] really what is this saying because your
[3:47] life which is christ
[3:49] is hid
[3:51] and and it's in god and he says when
[3:53] that life will appear
[3:55] it does something where ye shall appear
[3:57] with him also there's there's going to
[3:59] be something that bursts forth to life
[4:02] and it says in christ who is our life
[4:03] appear it means to make manifest what
[4:05] was hidden
[4:06] so there's a appearing of what was
[4:08] hidden something hidden something unseen
[4:10] and so christ who is our life and it's
[4:13] in colossians and even in the crisis the
[4:15] mystery of god revealed where brother
[4:16] brown's drawing from how that christ is
[4:18] the image of the invisible god
[4:20] and this colossians 1 15 and so he is
[4:23] christ who's the image of the invisible
[4:24] god christ who is the mystery of god
[4:27] that's where your life that is who is
[4:29] your life when he shall appear ye shall
[4:32] appear also with him you shall also
[4:34] appear with him in glory now glory we
[4:37] might think christ is in heaven when he
[4:39] appears we'll appear in heaven but the
[4:41] glory there is something different than
[4:42] a dimension but it's a character it's a
[4:45] it's an excellence of person
[4:48] now to
[4:51] uh just to kind of see what how these
[4:54] things tie together in the word of god
[4:56] and the seed does not air with the shock
[4:58] but the brain says but at the open of
[4:59] the seals revelations 10. notice what he
[5:01] just did there connected is open to the
[5:03] seals of revelations chapter 10. it's an
[5:05] important connection that he makes quite
[5:07] often so at the open of the seals in the
[5:09] fulfillment of revelations 10 the full
[5:11] word is to be born into manifestation
[5:14] again
[5:15] i believe he's he's it's it's deliberate
[5:18] that it's revelations 10 because there's
[5:20] the mighty angel comes down uh with the
[5:22] book open there's the sounding of seven
[5:24] thunders uh there's the symbolism of it
[5:26] being sealed up and then it's gonna be
[5:28] finished in the days of the voice of the
[5:30] seventh angel and then john goes to the
[5:32] one who has the book takes it eats it in
[5:35] what prophesies again so he's saying
[5:37] this is all at the open of the seals
[5:39] revelations 10 the full word is to be
[5:42] born into manifestation again if you're
[5:45] using the language of birth that means
[5:47] life comes forth the full word is to be
[5:49] born into manifestation again and
[5:51] vindicated by the spirit of god so to be
[5:54] vindicated there has to be a
[5:55] manifestation that's the interpretation
[5:58] in the full strength as it was when he
[6:00] was here on earth so just as christ
[6:03] fulfilled the promises in his day the
[6:05] forward's going to be born into
[6:06] manifestation today
[6:08] in its full strength as it was when he
[6:10] was here on earth manifested in the same
[6:12] way
[6:14] doing the same things that it did when
[6:16] it was here on earth
[6:18] that's how you could see in the
[6:19] scripture that in the days of the voice
[6:21] of the seventh angel and he shall begin
[6:22] to sound the mystery of god should be
[6:24] finished this it's going to be born into
[6:27] manifestation again it's going to be
[6:28] expressed it's going to be lived out
[6:30] and i i think on a wednesday night it
[6:32] affords us the opportunity sometimes
[6:34] just to make quick references to certain
[6:35] things
[6:36] we know that uh the open of the seals
[6:39] brought quickening power
[6:40] and brotherhood says one place to snatch
[6:42] us from death to life and it's this
[6:44] quickly empowered that brings the
[6:46] manifestation it's the quickening power
[6:48] is loosed upon the bride to bring forth
[6:50] life
[6:51] he says in one place
[6:53] the fullness of the word come into
[6:55] existence he says or the open of the
[6:57] seals so the opening of the seals is the
[6:59] full word coming into existence made
[7:01] available a loose it's being revealed
[7:03] and we know that manifestation follows
[7:06] revelation because
[7:07] we could all uh we could
[7:09] we could look at the message and can't
[7:11] argue that brother man taught the
[7:13] revelation of the seven seals has come
[7:16] but what need what is needed not just a
[7:18] revelation but a manifestation
[7:21] and so it's the revelation of the seven
[7:23] thunders i think it's even in a third
[7:25] seal where brother branham is saying
[7:26] there's no manifestation of god yet to
[7:28] stir the bride but he says i'll take
[7:30] those seven unknown thunders to wake her
[7:32] up so the reveal of the seven thunders
[7:34] brings a a manifestation of god or a
[7:36] revelation of christ to stir us up to
[7:39] life
[7:40] and he says if they even be risen with
[7:42] christ there's something that stirs us
[7:44] up something that animates us and brings
[7:46] us to an audience with christ and then
[7:48] christ is the mystery god revealed
[7:49] brother brahm is saying she is now risen
[7:52] the body of christ is now risen so there
[7:54] was some
[7:55] something transpiring then in that
[7:56] season that's very important to catch a
[7:59] hold of
[8:00] now
[8:01] that is just one portion of
[8:04] the sermon i want you kind of look at
[8:05] that as something you could just
[8:07] reference as kind of indicating what
[8:09] direction we're going now i want to drop
[8:11] back for some moments here and try to do
[8:14] it so very quickly so in my slides i
[8:16] think i just put up some key statements
[8:17] because i want to go very quickly
[8:19] through question and answers on the
[8:20] seals and i think we maybe took two
[8:22] services doing that so i'm not going to
[8:24] be an hour and 45 minutes reviewing it i
[8:26] just want to hit it real quick but the
[8:28] ram says and it was a little lamp
[8:29] talking about the interpretation they
[8:31] had of john
[8:32] or the messiah coming he's going to have
[8:34] that mile-long spear and pick off people
[8:37] from the hills of judea says it was but
[8:38] when it came he says it was a little
[8:40] lamb moving out among them meek and
[8:42] gentle pushed around this way in that
[8:43] way
[8:44] even john said go ask him is actually he
[8:47] the one so humble
[8:49] till that prophet missed it
[8:51] so the manifestation of the word of god
[8:53] in that day was even so humble that the
[8:55] forerunner
[8:56] wrestled with the manifestation of what
[8:58] he foreign there was i would say
[9:00] wrestling he rather eventually asked an
[9:01] honest question
[9:03] uh there is because it was the uh
[9:05] expected expectation versus
[9:07] interpretation as it was a little lamb
[9:09] humble meek and so humble to that
[9:10] prophet missed it so then he says you
[9:12] just go and these are just clips sound
[9:14] bites you just go ahead and just
[9:15] remember what you're told live a
[9:17] christian life go to your church be a
[9:19] real light wherever you are and just
[9:21] burn for christ and tell the people how
[9:23] you love him and just let your testimony
[9:26] be with love all the time with the
[9:27] people because if you don't
[9:30] you twist yourself out into something
[9:32] there
[9:33] and then you're off the beaten track so
[9:36] if you're not living the life if you're
[9:37] not going to church if you're not
[9:38] burning for christ you twist yourself
[9:41] out into something else you're off the
[9:42] path you're off the way that you ought
[9:44] to be going
[9:45] the path that's going to lead you to the
[9:47] intended result
[9:48] so again just skipping around he says
[9:50] you just go ahead and just be humble and
[9:52] go right on with the same plain message
[9:54] now you say brother brandon we be in the
[9:56] church of the living god shouldn't we
[9:57] and why can't i and i ought to have he
[10:00] says no no
[10:01] right there's this expectation something
[10:03] great something fantastic all right we
[10:05] should be able to do this we should be
[10:06] able to do he says no no no whatever it
[10:08] is he's referring to he says just be
[10:10] humble go on with the same plain message
[10:13] then he said he's answering the question
[10:14] would the bride of uh of christ have a
[10:16] ministry before the rapture and he says
[10:18] his answer says sure absolutely she's
[10:20] going to have a a ministry he says sure
[10:22] she's got a ministry great ministry it's
[10:24] the minister the hour it'll be so humble
[10:28] it's a great ministry but it's humble it
[10:30] says how many was here at the first last
[10:32] sunday remember what i preached on
[10:34] humility oh don't forget that i'm going
[10:37] to stop a minute to warn that again
[10:38] remember when god predicts anything
[10:40] great to happen the people are looking
[10:42] so far away by their wisdom till they
[10:44] miss what happens
[10:47] so when you're when god's going to do
[10:48] something great god's going to do
[10:49] something great god's going to do
[10:50] something everybody starts looking for
[10:51] something great and they look right over
[10:53] the top of it
[10:54] look right over the top of it when it
[10:56] happens because they're looking for some
[10:57] great ministry some some some powerhouse
[11:00] some move that's going to get
[11:01] everybody's attention and yet it just
[11:03] comes in a very simple way even though
[11:04] it's powerful
[11:06] and even though people's attention may
[11:07] beget it's not always everyone oh wow
[11:10] isn't this awesome and this wonderful
[11:12] is usually something simple and humble
[11:14] to where the people look right over it
[11:16] then he says
[11:17] speaking of the disciples they didn't
[11:19] the people and the first coming they
[11:20] didn't understand it even the disciples
[11:22] didn't get it that's right
[11:23] simplicity be humble
[11:25] go right down when god promises
[11:27] something big it is big in his sight
[11:30] and he says take that blade of grass
[11:32] remember he's talking about that blade
[11:32] of grass he says it has life in it it's
[11:34] so simple and humble
[11:37] and then he talks about a big man if a
[11:38] big man if he's a big man all right but
[11:40] if he's big enough that he can become
[11:42] simple he'll find god
[11:44] but if you don't become simple he'll
[11:45] never see him so you've got to become
[11:47] simple
[11:48] he says get humble
[11:51] just stay humble so that's our goal get
[11:53] humble and then stay humble
[11:55] what is it they say about humility it's
[11:57] a funny thing as soon as you think you
[11:58] have it
[11:59] you lost it
[12:01] and so you want to get humble and stay
[12:02] humble
[12:04] now i provided this statement um
[12:06] from question answers on the seals could
[12:08] i want us to start i want to see the
[12:10] these things together he says don't put
[12:12] your own interpretation to anything you
[12:14] just go on and live a good christian
[12:16] life
[12:17] because you'll only wind yourself away
[12:19] from the real thing when you do it if
[12:21] you put your own interpretation to it
[12:23] stop living the christian life you get
[12:25] off the beaten path
[12:27] you twist yourself out of what god has
[12:29] intended it for
[12:30] and god's intent is that the
[12:33] man would live by the word of god and
[12:34] that would be the word expressed so he
[12:36] says you gotta live a good christian
[12:38] life or you wind yourself away from the
[12:39] real thing you only wind your way again
[12:42] away from the thing and all you are
[12:44] conscious and know that there's
[12:45] something mysterious happening and it is
[12:47] happening and i know what it is it's
[12:49] been told to you before so just don't
[12:51] try to put any interpretation but just
[12:53] believe me as your brother we're living
[12:54] in a great hour
[12:56] we're living in a time where thee
[12:58] well we're
[13:00] will you just be real humble
[13:02] be a christian and try to live for god
[13:05] and live honest with your fellow man and
[13:06] love those who don't love you he's not
[13:08] trying to distract from the truth
[13:11] he's not trying to say oh well you know
[13:12] do a little bit of a head fake to keep
[13:14] you from thinking he got real close to
[13:15] telling you what it was but he's given
[13:17] you the key to what it is
[13:20] he's really pointing us in the right
[13:22] direction that we're living in a great
[13:23] hour where there's going to be an
[13:24] interpretation there's going to be a
[13:26] great happening he knows what it is he's
[13:28] being very careful with his language he
[13:30] says so just live for god be a christian
[13:33] live honest with your fellow man love
[13:34] those who don't love you don't try to
[13:36] make any you see you do you only make it
[13:39] a mysterious something and mess the real
[13:41] program of god up
[13:44] so there's a way that we can act a way
[13:45] that we can conduct ourselves
[13:47] even with this sense that some great
[13:49] mysterious thing has happened and we
[13:51] mess the program of god up now whether
[13:53] you want to take it to mean that
[13:55] whatever god's program is you've upset
[13:56] his program or whether or not you mess
[13:59] the program of god up for your own life
[14:02] you getting out of cater which is living
[14:04] a good christian life upsets the
[14:06] continuity of what god is wanting to
[14:08] accomplish at the very time that these
[14:10] seals are being preached
[14:13] so he says if you're planting wheat
[14:14] plant your wheat if you're digging
[14:15] potatoes go on and dig them out
[14:18] if i knew he was coming tomorrow and i
[14:19] was a farmer i'd put my crop in today if
[14:21] you made me a farmer i'm going to stay
[14:22] right at my duty i think i have some of
[14:24] these statements there if i'm home
[14:26] potatoes it'll just be hohen just as
[14:27] hard as i can
[14:29] he says dig the potatoes and go to
[14:30] church and write on if it takes place in
[14:32] the morning you'll be found doing just
[14:34] exactly what you're supposed to be doing
[14:36] don't start
[14:37] he says when you do you twist the very
[14:40] thing away from the purpose that it's
[14:41] intended for
[14:43] so if you're planting wheat plant wheat
[14:45] if you're digging potatoes dig potatoes
[14:46] if you're a mechanic be a mechanic do
[14:48] what you're supposed to be doing and if
[14:50] you have this
[14:52] expectation and desire to see the coming
[14:54] of the lord he said just keep doing what
[14:56] you're supposed to do because that's the
[14:58] only way to get there
[15:00] keep doing what you're supposed to do
[15:01] because it's going to be through daily
[15:03] life daily living when you're doing what
[15:05] you're supposed to be doing do it at
[15:07] your post of duty
[15:09] consecrating your life to god whatever
[15:11] whatever it is you're asked to do
[15:12] whether a brother or sister in christ be
[15:15] at your post of duty because that is the
[15:17] only way you're going to come to that
[15:19] great climax in that meeting in the air
[15:23] if you're going to i think it was way
[15:24] that it had struck me one time and i
[15:26] preached on farmers i think farmers was
[15:28] even in my title and it was probably
[15:30] clickbait to a lot of people there's
[15:32] farmers in the rapture and what's strong
[15:34] is if you're going to see the
[15:35] supernatural it's going to happen while
[15:36] you're farming
[15:39] if we're going to go out and just stare
[15:40] stare on the horizon for something
[15:41] supernatural to happen you're going to
[15:42] miss it but if you'll just go back in
[15:44] the field
[15:45] and start holding that row start picking
[15:47] weeds planting potatoes harvesting wheat
[15:50] doing whatever it is you're supposed to
[15:51] do that's where you see the supernatural
[15:53] is when you're doing what you're
[15:54] supposed to do
[15:57] there was a time when
[15:59] israel was going to anoint its first
[16:01] king and a prophet was commissioned by
[16:02] god to go anoint a king and the prophet
[16:05] arrived and he said hey go get all your
[16:06] sons i want to anoint one of your sons
[16:08] to be a king and all the ones that
[16:10] showed up for the meeting and took a day
[16:11] off none of them were the king
[16:14] who was the king the one that was still
[16:15] out there in the field doing what he's
[16:17] supposed to do about his duty and i had
[16:19] to go get him out of the field to come
[16:20] and be anointed so if there's going to
[16:22] be an anointing come it's not because
[16:24] you've got some special appointment
[16:25] where you take your day off and it
[16:26] happens it's going to happen while
[16:28] you're doing what you're supposed to do
[16:30] every day as a christian
[16:33] so as we have these things kind of lined
[16:35] up
[16:37] before us now
[16:38] let's let's step forward to the seventh
[16:41] seal
[16:42] which was preached that evening and i
[16:45] want to read these statements to you to
[16:47] connect with the theme
[16:49] that was in question and answers on the
[16:50] seals that morning i had several other
[16:53] places
[16:54] from god hiding himself in simplicity
[16:56] all the way up through the sixth seal
[16:58] where brother-in-law's kind of using a
[16:59] similar language be humble stay simple
[17:02] but now let's just follow this this i
[17:04] don't even think i provided this quote
[17:06] so just listen to what i'm sharing with
[17:08] you
[17:09] and be very in tune to these elements
[17:12] that he's referring to because he's
[17:13] going to refer the third poll
[17:15] and
[17:16] and he's referring to actually right
[17:18] here where we start the vision that he
[17:19] had at the third pole which is a
[17:20] three-part vision
[17:22] and and he's the other parts with
[17:24] respect to fishing and lacing the booty
[17:26] and then he's carried away to this great
[17:27] cathedral and then there's a little room
[17:30] and you how many here are all familiar
[17:32] with that with those tellings
[17:34] he says just then he picked me up and he
[17:36] took me up and set me way up high to
[17:38] where a meeting was going on looked like
[17:39] a tent or a cathedral of some sort and i
[17:42] looked and there was a little box like
[17:43] little place over in the side and i see
[17:46] that light was talking to somebody above
[17:47] me
[17:48] and that light you see there on the
[17:49] picture so this is a pillar fire it
[17:51] world away from me like that went over
[17:53] to that tent and said i'll meet you
[17:55] there
[17:56] this will be the third pull and you
[17:58] won't tell it to anybody
[18:01] and that's why he's so careful
[18:03] can't tell to anybody can't tell if
[18:05] anybody can't tell to anybody right
[18:06] have you made you've all made that
[18:07] connection where brother ram is so
[18:09] reluctant to share more it's because of
[18:11] this
[18:12] commandment that he received at the time
[18:14] that this vision was given
[18:16] that pillar of fire
[18:18] which is the uh
[18:19] veiling god or declaring his presence
[18:22] goes into that little room and he says
[18:24] i'll meet you there and he says and that
[18:26] will be the third pull
[18:28] and brother he says and you won't tell
[18:30] it to anybody and in sabino canyon he
[18:33] said this is the third pool
[18:36] now this is intentional there's one here
[18:39] in 56 and when he first tells the story
[18:41] this will be the third pool now in 1963
[18:44] he says this is the third pool so it's
[18:47] not a will be anymore
[18:49] it's important to understand that and he
[18:50] said there's three great things that go
[18:52] with it and one unfolded today he says
[18:55] yesterday one unfolded yesterday the
[18:56] other one folded today and there's one
[18:59] thing i cannot interpret because it's in
[19:01] an unknown language
[19:06] i really wanna i wanna share something
[19:07] with you but i don't wanna get started
[19:08] on it because it's a separate it's a
[19:10] whole separate line
[19:12] but i'll just say it i'll just say it to
[19:14] you all tonight if we have to cut the
[19:16] tape we'll do it
[19:24] how was that seventh church age ushered
[19:25] in
[19:27] gifts
[19:28] speaking in tongues so then what has to
[19:30] follow
[19:31] the interpretation
[19:33] what interprets it the life
[19:35] that's what we are the bride that is
[19:36] raised up in this bright age is the
[19:38] interpretation that follows the tongues
[19:41] and so he says in this he says there's
[19:44] an unknown language and he says it needs
[19:46] an interpretation remember what it takes
[19:48] to interpret it
[19:50] he says but i was standing right there
[19:51] and looked right straight at it and this
[19:53] is the third pull coming up and the holy
[19:56] spirit of god oh my that's the reason
[19:58] all heaven was silent
[20:01] and he says now i better stop right
[20:02] there i feel checked to say no more
[20:03] about it
[20:05] because he's right there he's right
[20:06] there at the seventh seal he's right
[20:08] there at this time of this great
[20:10] unfolding he's this is the third pool
[20:12] you must not say anything about it he
[20:14] says i feel checked to say no more about
[20:16] it
[20:17] and he says so just remember the seventh
[20:19] seal the reason it did not reveal it no
[20:21] one should know about it and i want you
[20:23] to know before i even note a word about
[20:25] that the vision come years ago and i i i
[20:28] forgot to bring my other set of notes
[20:30] right i have this sermon this excerpt
[20:32] printed out and you can see exactly
[20:35] where they stop
[20:36] it's right here in this area here where
[20:38] they stop and they published a different
[20:41] tape
[20:42] and so some of these things we're
[20:43] reading right now weren't even released
[20:44] to the public until after brother
[20:45] branham had passed away he said so just
[20:48] remember the seventh seal the reason
[20:49] they didn't reveal no one should know
[20:51] about it and he says and here it is just
[20:53] this other slides right straight into
[20:55] the word exactly where it was and god
[20:56] knows my heart i never one time thought
[20:58] of such a thing as that and here it was
[21:00] it's later than we think oh my just
[21:02] shows it's from god it fits exactly in
[21:04] the promises of god for the end time
[21:06] message you notice now for the end time
[21:09] message this seal after all he's
[21:11] revealed all the six seals but didn't
[21:13] say anything about the seventh and the
[21:15] end time seal when it starts it will be
[21:18] absolutely a total secret according to
[21:20] the bible
[21:21] it says and remember revelations chapter
[21:23] 10 1-7 at the end of the seventh angels
[21:25] message all the mysteries of god should
[21:27] be known we're at the end time the
[21:28] opening of the seventh seal
[21:32] a lot of if you'll notice the language
[21:34] that brother branham uses about the
[21:36] third pull is the same language he uses
[21:39] about the seventh seal it's even the
[21:40] same language he uses about the coming
[21:42] of the lord
[21:43] same exact language secret third pull
[21:45] mystery not public not known
[21:47] paragraph 305 just continuing they open
[21:49] to the seventh seal now how did i know
[21:51] the other day last sunday a week ago
[21:52] today when i was preaching on
[21:55] be humble be humble remember god deals
[21:57] in the little things
[21:58] so he's talking about this is the third
[22:00] pull this is the seventh seal
[22:03] and you could tell he's astounded by
[22:04] these things never in my life i thought
[22:06] this and this is this is the end time
[22:08] message it fits perfectly he says but
[22:11] last week i was preaching on be humble
[22:13] be humble remember god deals in little
[22:15] things i didn't realize what it really
[22:17] was talking about and now i see it
[22:20] it is in such a humble way
[22:23] you'd think that something like that
[22:25] would be revealed to the vatican
[22:28] but it comes just like john the baptist
[22:31] it comes like the birth of our lord and
[22:32] is stable
[22:34] glory to god soul help me the hour is at
[22:36] hand we are here
[22:39] he's looking at this tremendous event
[22:41] the seventh seal the open of the seven
[22:44] seals the the the interpretation of
[22:46] these seven thunders he says something
[22:48] like this
[22:49] that all the church will just look
[22:51] forward to that everyone is expecting to
[22:52] happen you'd think it would happen in
[22:54] the vatican some great cathedral
[22:56] something big and something worldwide
[22:59] known and great he says but it comes
[23:01] like john the baptist the forerunner it
[23:03] comes like the birth of our lord jesus
[23:05] in a stable
[23:07] he goes right back to forerunner and the
[23:09] coming of christ he said the hour is at
[23:11] hand we're here glory to god so help me
[23:12] we're here but he's saying be humble
[23:14] remember god deals in the little things
[23:17] he says this is what uh this is what
[23:20] he's arriving at even after he's
[23:21] preached this this far into the seventh
[23:24] seal
[23:25] so then he comes to the very end
[23:27] of the sermon he preached that evening
[23:29] he said there's no great man among us
[23:32] we're not great men not great women
[23:33] we're all brothers and sisters all the
[23:35] same in the same bracket
[23:38] i encourage all of us here in this
[23:40] church to look at one another as being
[23:42] the same
[23:43] if you've been serving the lord in this
[23:45] message for 40 years and someone else
[23:47] has only been serving them for four
[23:48] months look at one another as the same
[23:50] see yourself and the one who's coming up
[23:52] behind you when you look at someone
[23:54] who's been serving the lord for 40 years
[23:56] and you've only been serving them 40
[23:57] months 4 months maybe look to something
[24:00] in them that you know you aspire to be
[24:02] or see yourself and one another don't
[24:04] look down on one another
[24:06] i was so overwhelmed uh this week with
[24:09] with the thought of just the the where
[24:11] god has manifested himself in this end
[24:12] time it's in humility it's in simple
[24:15] people it's in people that have been
[24:16] rejected and kicked out and despised and
[24:18] thought little of and never felt like
[24:20] they fit in that's where god's revealing
[24:22] himself
[24:23] that's where the truth is being revealed
[24:25] that's where it's really growing and and
[24:27] coming to preeminence he says we're no
[24:30] great he says one don't one don't make
[24:32] one greater than the other one not a
[24:33] thing at all to do no sir but we're all
[24:36] just human beings
[24:38] don't try to interpret the things don't
[24:39] try to do anything more than
[24:42] just live a close life
[24:44] give giving praise and honor to jesus
[24:46] christ he says everybody understand that
[24:47] now amen love him with all your heart
[24:50] he's in no way trying to downplay how
[24:53] significant these events are and the
[24:54] things that are coming up but in his in
[24:57] what he says he says something
[24:58] mysterious has happened and i know what
[25:00] it is whatever's beginning to dawn on
[25:02] his heart whatever is coming up he
[25:04] there's this
[25:05] sensitivity to encourage us and admonish
[25:07] us as christians keep living the life
[25:10] keep doing what you're supposed to do
[25:12] live close to god give praise and honor
[25:13] to jesus christ love them with all your
[25:15] heart
[25:18] now in the table if you were to research
[25:20] the message using the table
[25:22] and i'm not sure if it's
[25:24] paragraphed the same way on in the
[25:26] applications we have on our tablets our
[25:28] cell phones
[25:29] but in the seventh seal the portion that
[25:31] was added the next day it's paragraph
[25:32] 391 with the study version i use but
[25:36] it's it's a segment that's added after
[25:38] the fact he says now do you notice on
[25:40] the open of the seventh seal it's also
[25:43] in a three-fold mystery so he says
[25:45] earlier there's three great things that
[25:46] goes with it one unfolded today
[25:48] yesterday one unfolded today
[25:50] he says it's also in a three-fold
[25:52] mystery
[25:54] this one will speak or this one i have
[25:57] will speak and have spoke that it is the
[25:59] mystery of the seven thunders
[26:01] the seven thunders in heaven will unfold
[26:03] this mystery it'll be right at the
[26:04] coming of christ because christ said no
[26:06] one knew when he would return just talk
[26:08] about the threefold mystery and how that
[26:10] it is
[26:11] the mystery of the seven thunders so
[26:13] christ said only god himself knew not
[26:16] even the angels
[26:18] no wonder it wasn't even written you see
[26:20] they hushed nothing take place then
[26:22] angels don't know it nobody knows when
[26:24] he's coming but there'll be seven voices
[26:26] of these seven thunders that will reveal
[26:28] the great revelation at that time
[26:31] so i believe to to us who if we don't
[26:34] know it
[26:35] and it won't be known until that time
[26:37] but we revealed in that day in that hour
[26:39] that it's supposed to be revealed in
[26:42] so if we don't know it now we don't know
[26:44] if it's not known until that time but it
[26:45] will be revealed in that day now when
[26:46] it's supposed to be revealed in i don't
[26:48] have it here in front of me i don't
[26:50] believe so but he makes the statement
[26:51] that it's not yet revealed but it's
[26:53] moving into that cycle because what he
[26:54] said the night before he's preaching it
[26:56] this part it hasn't been revealed yet
[26:57] but it's moving into that cycle
[26:59] he said so the thing for us to do is
[27:02] try to figure it out
[27:06] so the thing for us to do is to be
[27:07] reverent before god and serve him and do
[27:10] all that we know how to do and live good
[27:13] christian lives
[27:15] right at this time what he's thinking
[27:16] about the things he's saying
[27:18] boom boom boom boom it's building this
[27:20] expectation of seventh seal revelations
[27:22] 10 revelations eight one all these big
[27:24] things he says so the thing for us to do
[27:27] i mean you sir surely it would be
[27:29] uh something significant right give the
[27:31] pastor the keys to your house because if
[27:33] the rapture comes you're not going to
[27:35] need it right do all these do all these
[27:36] things get rick something great happen
[27:38] sell the farm you know um stop stop
[27:41] stockpiling and get ready sell
[27:43] everything just kind of wait um
[27:45] everybody put on their sweatsuit and
[27:47] drink the kool-aid and wait for the ufo
[27:48] to come because it's going to happen any
[27:50] moment
[27:52] he says no just live good christian
[27:54] lives be reverent before god
[27:57] here now we find that the sixth seal is
[27:59] open to us we see it and we know that
[28:01] the seventh seal cannot be broke to the
[28:03] public until that hour arrives
[28:05] now there was some reason that god let
[28:08] these seven voices be thundered
[28:11] you just take that in your mind the
[28:12] reason why he lets it be thundered we
[28:14] find christ the lamb took the book in
[28:16] his hand so he and he opened that
[28:18] seventh seal but you see it's a hidden
[28:20] mystery no one knows it again this is
[28:21] what he's recording
[28:23] and replaces
[28:24] uh the portion that he ministered on the
[28:26] night before and if you go back and
[28:28] listen to the part that he originally
[28:29] took out all he's really what he's
[28:31] saying is this was the tent vision i had
[28:33] this is fulfilled this fulfills the tent
[28:35] vision and he feels like he said too
[28:37] much
[28:38] so he kind of wants to retract it and
[28:39] back up a little bit so as to not make
[28:41] too many
[28:42] public direct connections to that so he
[28:44] says it's a hidden mystery uh no one
[28:46] knows it but it's right along with what
[28:48] he said no one would know his coming
[28:50] they also would not know about this
[28:51] seventh thunder mystery so you see it's
[28:54] connected together so brother brahm is
[28:56] making the connection himself that's
[28:58] that much we have an understanding of it
[29:00] today but because the rest of it
[29:03] is all unfolded
[29:05] but this is not unfolded but setting in
[29:08] my room i seen it unfold to this seven
[29:10] thunders now that's as far as we can go
[29:13] right here and now i trust
[29:16] he's brought you right up to the very
[29:18] moment where it's like okay this is what
[29:19] we've all been waiting for
[29:22] this is the moment peel back the curtain
[29:24] speak to us plainly brother branham so
[29:26] he says now this is as far as we could
[29:28] go
[29:29] and now i trust that each and every one
[29:31] of you will
[29:33] figure it out
[29:35] serve god
[29:36] and do that which is right
[29:38] and love him with all your life and
[29:40] serve him and god will take care of the
[29:45] rest
[29:47] god will take care of the rest if
[29:49] there's a reveal and if there's an
[29:50] unfolding if there's a manifestation if
[29:53] there's a truth that's to be quickened
[29:54] to you he even says it earlier if you're
[29:56] to know it he's going to reveal it to
[29:57] he's going to share it with you he's
[29:58] going to um he's going to pour out this
[30:01] understanding and release these things
[30:03] to us so he says just serve god love him
[30:06] do that which is right and god will take
[30:08] care of the rest and i'll say this if
[30:10] you're not doing this serving god doing
[30:12] that which is right and loving him with
[30:13] all your life and serving him then
[30:16] nothing the rest isn't being taken care
[30:18] of
[30:20] it doesn't mean god's not going to do
[30:21] his part but you're going to be left
[30:23] standing not walking in the vision not
[30:25] fulfilling the part that god has for you
[30:27] and if you feel that some things are
[30:28] withheld from you and you're not quite
[30:30] getting
[30:31] the understanding of the blessing that
[30:32] you desire don't try to press harder to
[30:34] figure out all the types and start
[30:36] counting your steps to see if you can
[30:37] add have a bunch of threes and sevens in
[30:39] it no just get to the place where you
[30:41] can serve god do that which is right and
[30:43] love him with all your life and servant
[30:45] and god will take care of the rest
[30:49] and i want you to try to gather a lot of
[30:51] these things in your mind over these
[30:53] last few services
[30:54] uh the following sunday wednesday this
[30:56] sun this wednesday night kind of gather
[30:59] all these things together think of how
[31:00] this all ties together
[31:02] because it's almost as if there's he's
[31:04] running two different things it's almost
[31:05] as if he's teaching a class on the
[31:07] seventh seal but then he's kind of going
[31:09] back to a sunday school class something
[31:11] very simple and it's like real i really
[31:13] want to get in these mysteries ah but
[31:14] you really can't handle it so just live
[31:15] a christian life and it would almost
[31:17] seem like there's these different
[31:18] different things he's emphasizing
[31:21] and
[31:21] and there's i know there's those of you
[31:23] here that know it
[31:25] that there's you've sat under pastors
[31:27] and you've known ministries that have
[31:28] basically taken these statements i've
[31:30] shared with you about the seals and said
[31:32] see god doesn't want you to know it you
[31:33] can't understand it forget about it let
[31:35] that book collect dust on the shelf
[31:37] and thought nothing of it not realizing
[31:40] that what brother brandon was doing was
[31:41] not trying to separate the two but bring
[31:43] him
[31:44] together he kept mentioning them side by
[31:47] side not to create a dichotomy but to
[31:50] unite them together and being this
[31:51] fusion between whatever the seventh seal
[31:54] is whatever these thunders reveal
[31:56] whatever is behind that veil and the
[31:58] life that you're living whatever's
[32:00] hidden in your life come together and
[32:02] unite together
[32:04] it all ties to think of how it ties
[32:06] together the simple humble manifestation
[32:08] of god by living the life
[32:12] and he and he brings it right to
[32:14] revelations chapter 8 verse 1.
[32:16] and i i know that i'm sharing quite a
[32:18] bit with you
[32:19] and it may seem to be very compact and
[32:21] very dense
[32:23] but i believe you can digest this
[32:25] in revelations chapter 8 verse 1. and
[32:27] you won't even need an enzyme to do it
[32:32] revelations chapter 8 verse 1 this is
[32:34] the seventh seal
[32:36] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[32:37] there was silence in heaven about the
[32:39] space of a half hour
[32:40] that's it that's all it says
[32:44] the seventh seal
[32:45] is hidden within this language there was
[32:48] silence in heaven about the space of and
[32:49] a half hour seven stills opened and now
[32:52] it's represented symbolically in this
[32:54] saying silence in heaven about the space
[32:56] of a half hour
[32:58] there's a lot of things that could be
[32:59] shared on this
[33:00] i think there's different ways that you
[33:02] can use it as
[33:03] uh um
[33:04] it may be a shadow or a type or try to
[33:07] use some sort of example or an allegory
[33:10] in a way of just trying to bring out the
[33:11] full truth of this and so i think it's i
[33:13] don't i don't want to make i would i'm
[33:15] always careful in the way that i express
[33:17] things i don't want to be so come across
[33:19] as so dogmatic because this is the only
[33:21] way you can see it period this is it
[33:23] this is the only way you can see it uh
[33:25] but because there's different ways that
[33:27] you could express the same truth
[33:29] and he says when the seventh seal opens
[33:31] there's silence in heaven about the
[33:32] space of a half hour
[33:35] and
[33:36] in the sard when brother man preaches
[33:38] the sardisian church age
[33:41] listen to this statement
[33:43] do i have that quote there from the
[33:44] sardisian church age
[33:46] it would be right after revelations 8
[33:48] chapter 8 verse 1. i may not have put it
[33:50] in there
[33:51] so listen so this is what he says and um
[33:54] i can still remember the first time this
[33:56] really came to my conscience i heard
[33:58] brother lonnie jenkins share it so i can
[34:00] still hear it in his voice and boy did
[34:01] he get me back later
[34:03] he says and the bible says someone
[34:06] thought i was referring to brother
[34:07] michael when i said that
[34:09] no it happened in a men's meeting where
[34:11] after i had spoke he came across the
[34:13] next morning says well it's not exactly
[34:14] going to be that way and that's how he
[34:16] got me back so he says and the bible
[34:18] says that the heavens were empty for the
[34:20] space of a half hour
[34:22] now the brother branham is now he used
[34:24] the language the heavens were empty for
[34:25] a space of a half hour he's clearly
[34:27] referencing the open of the seventh seal
[34:29] revelations 8 1 and he says this
[34:31] statement where is this big foul of god
[34:33] then what an interesting question
[34:36] heaven is silent and he takes it and
[34:38] again just think of how
[34:40] i think it holds weight i mean there's
[34:42] there's something to this i'm not
[34:44] building some new doctrine around one
[34:45] little question where is this big fellow
[34:47] god then but it impresses the prophet to
[34:49] make this connection that when the
[34:51] heavens are silent he says the heavens
[34:53] are empty
[34:55] and he says where is the big fellow god
[34:58] then where's god where's this big fellow
[35:00] god uh-huh see he's in christ
[35:05] so the heavens are empty or the heavens
[35:07] are silent where's god he's in christ
[35:10] maybe we just want to debate all day
[35:11] well the heavens aren't empty and this
[35:13] is the reason why their heavens are
[35:14] silent but he's wanting us to think
[35:15] about where god is and he says he's in
[35:17] christ remember your life is hid with
[35:19] christ in god
[35:21] and he says where is where is the god
[35:23] where's this big fellow god he's in
[35:25] christ so now where's christ
[35:27] so where's this where's this big fellow
[35:29] god where's christ i want to know where
[35:31] christ is where is he at the open of the
[35:33] seals where is he found
[35:37] bringing you right up to the
[35:39] right up just go on and keep living a
[35:41] simple life
[35:43] and he says
[35:44] so
[35:46] we're wanting to know where christ is if
[35:47] god
[35:48] is in christ
[35:49] where's this big fella at the time of
[35:51] the seventh seal being opened well god
[35:53] is in christ where's christ
[35:55] remember the seventh seal brother said
[35:56] it unfolds in a three-fold manner
[36:00] he said did you notice at the opening of
[36:01] the seventh seal it's also in a
[36:03] three-fold mystery is what he says
[36:06] when brother branham describes
[36:08] i can't remember now just off the top my
[36:10] head where it was he said it was the
[36:11] next
[36:12] few services after he preached christ is
[36:14] the mystery god revealed he described
[36:15] the sermon this way pointed back to what
[36:17] he preached
[36:18] and he described it this way he preached
[36:20] on the threefold revelation of jesus
[36:21] christ being god's hidden secret from
[36:24] the foundation of the world so christ is
[36:26] the mystery god revealed the summary is
[36:28] it's the threefold revelation of jesus
[36:30] christ
[36:31] being god's hidden secret from the
[36:33] foundation of the world so there was a
[36:34] hidden secret a mystery of god
[36:37] in his heart heart purpose of god in the
[36:39] back part of god's mind and it unfolds
[36:41] in a three-part manner all through jesus
[36:43] christ
[36:45] and he says i'm trying so in christ and
[36:46] mr god revealed he says i'm trying to
[36:48] bring you the three-fold revelation or
[36:50] mystery of god
[36:52] the revel and i'll just i'm skipping
[36:54] through several statements now the
[36:55] revelation of the threefold mystery the
[36:56] secret and by the person of indication
[36:59] vindicated word by his original headship
[37:01] so he's trying to bring you the third
[37:02] threefold revelation he makes the
[37:04] statement the revelation of the
[37:04] threefold mystery the secret
[37:07] this is what he's preached on and christ
[37:08] is the mystery god revealed this is just
[37:10] a few several months four months or so
[37:13] after the preaching of the seven seals
[37:16] what i'm wanting to emphasize and you
[37:18] can see here is that christ
[37:20] is in his bride christ in his bride is
[37:22] part of the unfolding of this great
[37:24] threefold revelation
[37:26] because he said it's a three-fold
[37:28] revelation three-fold revelation of
[37:29] jesus christ revelation threefold
[37:30] mystery the secret and he says so notice
[37:32] some of these bullet points christ in
[37:34] the church today taking his wife back
[37:36] see the threefold mystery now
[37:39] cried the first part of that threefold
[37:41] mystery was jesus christ fulfilling the
[37:43] old testament being the interpretation
[37:46] of the written word that's the first
[37:47] part that's the first uh unfolding of
[37:50] the threefold mystery of christ but now
[37:52] the next part christ in the church
[37:55] and that and he says taking his wife
[37:56] back and so we know there's a
[37:57] restoration to eden see the threefold
[38:00] mystery now
[38:02] listen he says it this way god
[38:03] manifested himself in his body christ
[38:06] now you see the threefold beautiful
[38:08] thing christ in his body the church
[38:10] vindicating his promised word like god
[38:12] did through christ
[38:14] threefold mystery the the the seventh
[38:17] seal is in a three-fold mystery this
[38:19] mystery of christ is in a three-fold
[38:21] mystery and he says it's in in his body
[38:23] christ now in his body the church
[38:26] vindicated his promised word
[38:28] he describes that second fold this way
[38:30] to have the preeminence in his bodies of
[38:32] believers that is his bride that he
[38:34] might live in people
[38:36] what's the second fold of the threefold
[38:38] mystery to have preeminence in his body
[38:39] of believers his bride that he might
[38:41] live in the people
[38:43] he says what's this threefold purpose
[38:45] manifest himself in jesus christ to come
[38:48] into the body by jesus christ to have
[38:50] the preeminences
[38:51] part of this three-fold mystery and he's
[38:53] using the same language here in the
[38:55] christ is a mystery god revealed
[38:58] now paragraph 210 and that we could look
[39:00] at this together he says do you get it
[39:02] if you fail come back to this tape again
[39:04] i don't know how much longer i'll be
[39:06] with you remember this is the truth of
[39:07] thus saith the lord it's the truth it's
[39:09] the scripture
[39:10] like the seven mysteries of the seven
[39:12] last seals the mysteries of them
[39:14] the seals have been broken every age
[39:16] come down and there they left a lot of
[39:18] scattering and god not willing to be
[39:21] scattered he comes back
[39:23] and picks up those things those
[39:25] doctrines they started and brought it
[39:26] out and revealed the whole thing
[39:28] same thing he's doing now in revealing
[39:31] the mystery of christ
[39:33] how he was god's threefold purpose for
[39:35] the church oh my letting him out
[39:39] reveal
[39:41] if i finish this series tonight i'll
[39:43] make reference too the very initial
[39:46] inspiration
[39:48] that struck me is how brother branham
[39:50] makes reference to the book being sealed
[39:51] and you were sealed
[39:53] and so you were sealed in that book with
[39:55] those seals and the holy spirit being
[39:58] held back for two thousand years but at
[40:00] the open of seven seals christ the holy
[40:02] spirit is loosed again
[40:05] and what did that do it loses you
[40:07] it it whatever is holding you back
[40:09] whatever's restraining you
[40:12] there's no reason why the anthem is only
[40:14] believe
[40:16] all things are possible
[40:18] this is the only age where you can
[40:19] actually have the the faith to believe
[40:21] in a body change
[40:23] he said what do you mean by that well it
[40:25] wasn't given any other age
[40:27] and everyone who's passed on can tell
[40:29] you yeah i obviously didn't have the
[40:31] faith
[40:32] right because it wasn't given for that
[40:33] hour in this hour you have to have more
[40:34] faith than ever given ever it was given
[40:36] any other age and that's power to change
[40:38] your body
[40:39] so he says he comes back
[40:42] revealing the mystery of christ how
[40:44] god's threefold purpose for the church
[40:46] oh my letting him out he says reveal
[40:50] that's what's happening
[40:52] he says like those seven mysteries the
[40:54] seven last seals he comes back the same
[40:56] thing he's doing now is revealing the
[40:58] mystery of christ that's the same thing
[40:59] he's doing now
[41:02] again paragraph 377
[41:05] i like that three seven seven
[41:07] he said now he's sanctified with his
[41:08] spirit and blood at church that he might
[41:10] make every promise in the last day be
[41:12] revealed
[41:13] now see he could go back and pick up
[41:15] these other fellows has left off here in
[41:17] the last days and by his holy spirit
[41:20] reveal all the mystery of the seven
[41:22] seals
[41:23] he is expressing himself
[41:26] well there it is
[41:28] all the mystery of the seven is hills he
[41:29] is expressing himself that's his purpose
[41:31] that's why he died that's the second
[41:34] fold of his threefold manifestation
[41:36] first to express himself in christ then
[41:38] express himself through the church and
[41:41] the same thing christ was the word and
[41:44] the church becomes the word when it lets
[41:46] the word go through them
[41:50] you're only going to be the word when
[41:51] you let the word go through you it's got
[41:53] to be some process
[41:54] of the word going through you becoming a
[41:57] part of you so he wants to the threefold
[42:00] manner of his expression the first is
[42:02] expressing himself the second fold of
[42:04] his threefold manifestation first christ
[42:07] himself in christ then himself through
[42:09] the church
[42:10] becoming the word as you let the word go
[42:12] through you
[42:16] again we're this is how you're the open
[42:18] book
[42:19] paragraph 5 15. he is the first fruits
[42:21] of the resurrection is that right
[42:24] then what is he he is the head of the
[42:25] body which is his church bride
[42:29] then the bride body must follow the head
[42:32] for it is part of his resurrection and
[42:35] part of the mystery
[42:37] you're part of the mystery
[42:39] it's impossible for it not to go oh my
[42:43] it's part of god's mystery
[42:45] how god revealed himself here and raised
[42:48] it up by the word
[42:50] so he reveals his church and raises it
[42:53] up by the same word it's part of his
[42:55] threefold mystery
[42:58] he's pointing to god in christ
[43:01] manifesting himself god declaring
[43:03] himself through the flesh of his son
[43:05] jesus christ he revealed himself in
[43:08] christ and raised christ up by the word
[43:11] so now he reveals himself in his bride
[43:14] and will raise her up by the same word
[43:17] it's part of the threefold mystery
[43:22] i know you've heard these things before
[43:23] i just want you to i want these to
[43:25] become more pronounced and connected
[43:26] with what brother brown was saying when
[43:28] he preached the seals
[43:29] and that humility that simplicity that
[43:31] living the life
[43:33] paragraph 5 29 and the word in god is
[43:35] one in his church today
[43:38] making it the headship of the body that
[43:40] is redeemed to bring the message into
[43:42] the last day
[43:43] and be taken up from the dead
[43:45] in the resurrection to go back and
[43:47] restore again as adam and eve in the
[43:49] beginning in the garden of eden
[43:52] the threefold mystery of god his body
[43:58] like the seven mysteries of the seven
[44:00] last seals
[44:02] he said he came and he told me when he
[44:04] comes and takes the book
[44:05] he said it's the same thing he's doing
[44:07] now
[44:09] he's making this allusion to he's
[44:10] alluding to
[44:13] christ coming and taking the book in the
[44:15] word in the bible in the symbolic form
[44:18] he says the same thing he's doing now in
[44:20] revealing the mystery of christ
[44:23] it's the same thing
[44:25] in the revelation of the mystery the
[44:26] three-fold mystery you're a part of it
[44:28] you have to believe you're a part of it
[44:30] out there's there's those that would
[44:32] come along and try to make it all
[44:33] brother branham that this is all
[44:35] fulfilled in brother branham and and i
[44:37] believe that they've kind of gone off
[44:38] into a ditch and then there's some
[44:40] people that want to pull you out of that
[44:41] ditch right into another one
[44:43] and leave brother branham out of it
[44:45] but if you'll notice i'm not quoting
[44:47] brother long jenkins
[44:49] i'm quoting the message he preached
[44:52] i'm not quoting another another prophet
[44:54] another somebody else god raised up uh
[44:56] we're all the minister of god come back
[44:58] to this voice come back to this message
[44:59] because this is what's pointing us to
[45:01] these things and there's some that maybe
[45:02] while you i wish you didn't read so many
[45:04] quotes or uh maybe can't you just bring
[45:06] these things through the bible you know
[45:08] we could preach the word of god using
[45:09] whatever means we we have but i know
[45:12] whom i'm speaking to
[45:13] and it's important for me to at least at
[45:16] this time in this moment for us to
[45:18] become so rooted and established in what
[45:20] we've been taught and what we've been
[45:22] given because what's most important is
[45:24] what was delivered is translated into a
[45:26] lived life
[45:29] so he reveals his church and raises them
[45:31] up by the same word
[45:33] amen
[45:34] the word of god in his church today the
[45:36] threefold mystery of god his body
[45:39] now brother brahms finished the sermon
[45:40] and he's preaching he's coming he's
[45:42] beginning to sing
[45:44] i think it's take the name of jesus with
[45:46] you and he's singing
[45:47] this song
[45:49] right before he sings now the threefold
[45:51] great mystery of revelation has been
[45:54] revealed
[45:55] it has been threefold purpose of his
[45:58] great mystery of revelation has been
[45:59] revealed he's the main one that's the
[46:01] one
[46:03] just earlier that summer he's preaching
[46:05] and he makes a reference he says
[46:07] i'm going to be preaching on the
[46:08] threefold i think he says the threefold
[46:09] revelation he says i've worked out the
[46:11] first one and he says i'm working on the
[46:13] second one now bringing all the
[46:14] scriptures out
[46:16] and he says now the threefold purpose is
[46:17] great mystery revelation has been
[46:19] revealed he's the main one that's the
[46:20] one
[46:22] he says it's the revelation it says
[46:23] eternal is god's word is eternal it's at
[46:25] the end of the service while the worship
[46:26] is going on but the threefold purpose of
[46:28] god's great mystery is revealed god
[46:30] manifested in christ christ manifests in
[46:33] the church
[46:35] we look back historically to see god
[46:37] manifested in christ but now it's the
[46:38] same god
[46:40] or the same christ manifested in the
[46:42] church in order to redeem the lost eve
[46:44] back to the original condition the
[46:45] garden eden there's your three-fold
[46:46] purpose
[46:48] several paragraphs later in paragraph 6
[46:50] 35 the threefold revelation hope and joy
[46:53] of heaven revealed in him and he sings
[46:55] precious name
[46:57] oh how sweet
[46:58] hope of earth and joy says what the hope
[47:00] of earth and joy of heaven
[47:03] what a beautiful
[47:05] visual at this very time of the third
[47:07] pole this great union of heaven and
[47:09] earth coming together hope
[47:11] of earth and joy of heaven everything is
[47:14] manifested in christ god the church
[47:17] everything else is manifest in christ
[47:19] the bible is christ
[47:22] the bible is the written word
[47:24] which he is the word
[47:27] it's manifestation what the written word
[47:30] its manifestation
[47:32] is the evidence of the life coming into
[47:34] the flesh of the word to manifest it oh
[47:37] isn't it wonderful
[47:39] do you realize just how closely this
[47:41] language fits with what he's preaching
[47:42] in the seventh seal and the things he's
[47:45] alluding to in the question and answers
[47:47] on the seals the bible is christ the
[47:49] bible is the written word but the
[47:51] manifestation of it is the evidence of
[47:53] the life coming in the flesh of the word
[47:55] to manifest the evidence of the written
[47:57] word is life coming into the flesh to
[48:00] manifest the word
[48:04] now you see how the bible became a new
[48:07] book when the seals were opened
[48:10] not so much becoming a new book because
[48:12] when you read it
[48:14] you see it differently
[48:16] but when you receive it you live it
[48:17] differently
[48:18] when it becomes a new book now the whole
[48:20] truth of it's being unveiled
[48:22] now the seals are tore off of it the
[48:24] life is being loosed under it now now
[48:26] now there's a life that's resonant in
[48:28] the body if you could kind of maybe
[48:30] catch it in this way you'll realize that
[48:33] um
[48:35] the the it it's always pointing to the
[48:37] rapture
[48:39] and so
[48:40] the life as it had moved through the
[48:42] carriers as it moved to the church age
[48:43] they always experienced what revival
[48:45] death revival death now at the open the
[48:48] seals we're snatched from death to life
[48:52] there will be no other cycle
[48:54] this is it
[48:58] so the opening seals makes the bible a
[49:00] new book the it's the fulfilling of the
[49:03] word of god in the last days the bible's
[49:05] christ the bible's the written word now
[49:07] it's christ in his bride fulfilling and
[49:10] living out this written word
[49:13] so i'll close with this statement i
[49:16] don't have it first slide i want you
[49:17] just to uh listen to these words i've
[49:19] read the statement
[49:21] for christ the mystery at the very
[49:22] beginning
[49:23] where he says all that's in the book is
[49:26] the believer
[49:27] he says now you see the seals
[49:30] when he was in his mediatorial work back
[49:32] there redeeming
[49:33] but someday he comes forth to get this
[49:35] book that he's redeemed
[49:37] so now he's looking right at revelations
[49:39] 5
[49:41] and all that's in this book would be him
[49:43] for that's the believer the words in the
[49:45] book
[49:46] and the word is him
[49:48] and all that's in that he come forth for
[49:50] this book of redemption whose names are
[49:53] written on the book before the
[49:54] foundation of the world
[49:56] when he was slain as a lamb now can we
[49:59] get the image then of revelations 5 and
[50:02] the lamb coming to take the book
[50:04] and yes
[50:06] we're all i think we're all familiar
[50:08] with just such significant strong
[50:10] language is used of that event
[50:13] what it signifies and whether you're
[50:14] looking at the breach or sirs is this
[50:16] the time
[50:17] and what it would have meant to the
[50:19] prophet and what it symbolized and stood
[50:21] for
[50:22] as he neared that great event
[50:24] and now we're hearing him at in the time
[50:27] in the season of these things
[50:28] transpiring
[50:30] and how he's he's taking in the
[50:32] magnitude of these things
[50:34] but he says do you see the seals i feel
[50:37] like this is all building this is all
[50:39] building to this do you see the sills
[50:41] and so he walks us to the paces he was
[50:43] through in this mediatorial work but
[50:45] someday he comes to get this book and
[50:47] he's walking through revelations chapter
[50:49] five it's that open book in five that
[50:51] comes down in revelations 10 it says in
[50:54] one place revelations 5 comes to
[50:55] revelations 10 7. and so he says all
[50:58] that's in that book he come forth this
[51:00] book of redemption whose names are
[51:01] written on the book before the
[51:02] foundation of the world do you have it
[51:03] in the image now what's happening when
[51:04] he was slain islam and here he is today
[51:07] in his word manifesting the same thing
[51:10] he did there
[51:14] it's a taking of the book
[51:17] it's a loosing of the seals
[51:19] it's the bible becoming a new book and
[51:22] don't get weird

[51:47] death
