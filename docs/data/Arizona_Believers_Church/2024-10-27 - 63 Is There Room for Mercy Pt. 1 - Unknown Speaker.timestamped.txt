[0:01] and it came to pass when the king sat in
[0:03] his house and the Lord had given him
[0:05] rest round about from all his enemies
[0:08] that the king said unto Nathan the
[0:10] prophet see now I dwell in a house of
[0:13] Cedar but the Ark of God dwelleth within
[0:16] curtains and Nathan said to the king go
[0:19] do all that is in thine heart for the
[0:21] Lord is with thee and I you can
[0:24] recognize what he's speaking of is
[0:26] transitioning from the ark that's been
[0:28] placed in the Tabernacle which was
[0:30] present in the wilderness which was
[0:31] moving around now he wants to build a
[0:33] fixed permanent Temple or house for the
[0:36] ark and it came to pass that night that
[0:38] the word of the Lord came unto Nathan
[0:40] saying go and tell my servant David thus
[0:42] sayith the Lord shalt thou build me and
[0:45] house for me to dwell in whereas I have
[0:47] not dwelt in any house since the time
[0:49] that I brought up the children of Israel
[0:51] out of Egypt even to this day but have
[0:54] walked in a tent and in a Tabernacle in
[0:57] all the places wherein I've walked with
[0:58] all the children of Israel spake i a
[1:00] word with any of the tribes of Israel
[1:02] whom I commanded to Feed My People
[1:03] saying why build ye not me in House of
[1:06] Cedar now therefore so sh so shalt thou
[1:09] say unto my servant David thus sayith
[1:12] the Lord of host I took thee from the
[1:14] Sheep coat from following the Sheep to
[1:15] be ruler over my people over Israel and
[1:18] I was with thee whether soever thou
[1:19] winest and have cut off all thine
[1:21] enemies out of thy sight and have made
[1:23] thee a great name like under the name of
[1:25] the great men that are in the earth
[1:27] moreover I will appoint a place for my
[1:29] My People Israel and will plant them
[1:31] that they may dwell in a place of their
[1:33] own and move no more neither shall the
[1:36] children of wickedness afflict them
[1:37] anymore as before time and as since the
[1:41] time that I commanded judges to be over
[1:42] My People Israel and have caused thee to
[1:45] rest from all thine enemies also the
[1:47] Lord tth thee that he will make thee a
[1:50] house and when thy days be fulfilled and
[1:53] thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will
[1:54] set up thy she seed after thee which
[1:57] shall proceed out of thy bows and I will
[2:00] establish his kingdom he shall build a
[2:02] house for my name and I will will
[2:05] establish the Throne of his kingdom
[2:07] forever I will be his father and he
[2:10] shall be my son if he commit iniquity I
[2:13] will chasen him with the rod of men and
[2:15] with the stripes of the children of men
[2:17] but my Mercy shall not depart from him
[2:20] as I took it from Saul whom I put away
[2:22] before thee and thine house and thy
[2:24] kingdom shall be established forever
[2:26] before thee thy Throne shall be
[2:29] established forever
[2:30] according to all these words and
[2:31] according to all this Vision so did
[2:33] Nathan speak unto David amen you can be
[2:38] seated I know there's Clear Connection
[2:41] in these the scripture reading I think
[2:43] we've even read some of this this year
[2:45] already to the house of the Lord and
[2:47] David meditating at the end of his days
[2:49] and as he is looking at the peace that
[2:52] reigned there in Israel he thought well
[2:55] God who dwells between those cherubims
[2:58] and there at the ark
[3:00] he has he lives behind a tent he lives
[3:02] behind a veil and I live in a nice house
[3:04] so I want to build him a house and the
[3:07] Lord's response to him is uh quite
[3:09] remarkable he's saying I've never once
[3:11] asked for you to build me a house but
[3:12] yet you say I want to build a house and
[3:14] it must have been something that please
[3:16] the Lord because he says you won't build
[3:18] the house but your son will build the
[3:20] house and he says that he will build
[3:23] this house and I will establish your
[3:24] house and your seed and I'll be a father
[3:26] to him and he says in my Mercy shall not
[3:29] depart from from him and it's kind of
[3:30] central uh to this theme in the house of
[3:33] the Lord you'll find and so I want to uh
[3:36] change titles in our subject now to is
[3:39] there room for mercy and ask this
[3:43] question is there room for mercy and
[3:45] we're still looking at these aspects of
[3:48] the house of the Lord and I want to
[3:50] blend the last subject where we were
[3:51] looking at the role of the house and how
[3:53] that the a household or a house whether
[3:55] you're an individual a family or a
[3:57] church is that you would develop
[3:59] character character that there'd be
[4:01] growth and maturity of the members of
[4:03] that household either uh maturity is
[4:05] demonstrated by those that are doing the
[4:07] leading and those that are doing the
[4:09] following are growing into the image of
[4:11] a of a an adult a mature individual and
[4:14] we took the approach of youngans uh
[4:17] whether you go from infancy to
[4:18] adolescence of growing into mature Sons
[4:21] and Daughters of God so that your's not
[4:24] you're not always just staying in one
[4:25] place you're not just being stagnant but
[4:27] there's this trajectory of growing into
[4:30] the image of Christ and I'd like to
[4:32] transition into a new focus on mercy and
[4:36] in particular been just studying again
[4:38] on the mercy seat and uh there's a lot
[4:41] in that and I realize we've ministered
[4:43] on these subjects quite a bit already
[4:44] over the last few years but yet it's a
[4:48] you you cannot exhaust the subject of
[4:50] mercy and I was blessed even this
[4:52] morning in singing this song about the
[4:54] goodness of God because that goodness is
[4:56] Mercy and and so this is there room for
[4:59] mercy you could have said is there room
[5:00] for goodness it goes back to kindness
[5:02] that we were ministering on and some of
[5:04] those things that we've touched on in
[5:05] the house of the Lord but just to uh
[5:08] blend this together we were looking at
[5:10] the statements wherein brother brandham
[5:12] is uh preaching the invisible Union of
[5:14] the bride of Christ in shreport we
[5:16] looked at that series quite a bit and
[5:18] how he's talking about the the modern
[5:19] church and he says they don't want any
[5:21] of these here screaming uh shouting
[5:23] tongue speaking acts 238 youngans around
[5:26] her and he's talking about the natural
[5:28] process of a birth and the way that a
[5:30] baby would act an infant even at the
[5:32] time that it's born there are certain
[5:34] signs of life and crying and shouting
[5:36] and breath is coming in and so he talks
[5:38] about screaming and hollering and
[5:39] blabbering he talks about an
[5:41] oldfashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost
[5:43] filled child born of the spirit
[5:45] screaming hollering shouting praising
[5:47] God and these are characteristics he's
[5:50] saying of a genuine child that's born
[5:52] there going to be some signs of life
[5:53] there's going to be some activity
[5:54] there's going to be something and even
[5:56] talks about at the in the birth of that
[5:57] church where there were signs and
[5:59] miracles and and wonders and crying and
[6:01] shouting and lifting up a loud voice and
[6:02] a cry to the Lord and it's the two acts
[6:05] 238 youngans been born again by the
[6:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I believe
[6:10] these statements stand as truth it just
[6:13] uh some of us have in our birth in our
[6:15] experience it was a mess and there's
[6:17] different ways that it manifest itself
[6:19] uh uh through different uh uh in many
[6:22] different ways but this stands for a
[6:24] definite truth but the truth can be
[6:27] misused Paul even uses a phrase handling
[6:30] the truth in
[6:31] unrighteousness and I want to use an
[6:33] example in the scripture and this to me
[6:35] is just perfect overlap of how you could
[6:37] take a truth and just try to apply it in
[6:41] a like a legalistic way and say well we
[6:43] got the results or this is what it says
[6:45] it's supposed to do so this is what it
[6:47] is but you completely miss the whole
[6:49] point and in there the word isn't
[6:51] effective it can't produce what it's
[6:52] supposed to produce in Proverbs 13: 24
[6:56] it says he that spareth his Rod hateth
[6:59] his son but he that loveth him
[7:01] chasteneth him be times so this be times
[7:04] there it means early and we might say
[7:06] early and often but the meaning here is
[7:09] that uh one who loves his son is going
[7:11] to correct him and chasen him early on
[7:14] uh because he loves him and he wants him
[7:15] to turn out right he wants to train him
[7:17] up in the way that he should go and so
[7:20] with it stands for the proposition I
[7:22] think it's very clear in the language
[7:23] it's using if you love your child you
[7:25] chasen him early on so where they get
[7:27] the saying spare the rod spoil the child
[7:30] you won't find that necessarily verbatim
[7:32] in scripture but this is what it's
[7:34] drawing from and I'll say it right now
[7:37] because this the point I'm trying to
[7:38] make at this at this particular juncture
[7:40] is some read this scripture he that
[7:42] spares his Rod who he who does not spank
[7:45] his child or punish his child hates him
[7:48] but if you love him you'll spank
[7:50] him and and we read that scripture and
[7:54] you really can't I mean even if you just
[7:56] try to break down the Hebrew you can't
[7:57] get away from the fact that it's saying
[7:58] that there ought to be some sort of
[8:00] chastening some sort of
[8:03] Affliction uh I if you love your child
[8:06] early on to train them up in the way
[8:07] that he should go but this scripture is
[8:10] taken and used to justify outright
[8:13] abuse in Proverbs chap 23 verses 13 and
[8:16] 14 withhold not correction from the
[8:18] child for if thou beatest him with the
[8:21] rod he shall not die and some think that
[8:24] the goal then is to beat him with the
[8:26] rod until with an inch of their life and
[8:29] that's going to save them from dying and
[8:31] what is it it's a blatant misuse and a
[8:33] perversion of the Scripture it says Thou
[8:35] shalt beat him with the rod and shal
[8:38] deliver his soul from death and so many
[8:40] thinking that they're being faithful to
[8:42] the scripture will clinch their teeth
[8:43] and take a rod and beat the devil out of
[8:46] you boy right and they're going to spank
[8:48] them and they're going to inflict pain
[8:49] and they're going to inflict this great
[8:51] harsh punishment and all the while say
[8:53] well it's in the word this is what the
[8:55] word says says in Proverbs 22:15
[8:58] foolishness is Bound in the heart of a
[9:00] child but the rod of Correction shall
[9:02] drive it far from him and there's a
[9:05] there's a lot in the language that's
[9:07] used and how they took it from what it
[9:08] was originally written in and then we
[9:10] reading from the King James version and
[9:12] maybe even a little more archaic
[9:14] language than we might use it to use
[9:16] today but it's saying that if you don't
[9:18] spank your child you hate him but if you
[9:21] love him you'll spank them and if you
[9:23] withhold correction uh uh you know don't
[9:25] withhold correction but beat him with a
[9:27] rod or just apply
[9:30] uh contact you know spank them we could
[9:32] say is maybe more modern parlament Thou
[9:34] shalt beat him with the rod and shalt
[9:36] deliver his soul from Death because
[9:38] foolishness is bound up in the heart of
[9:39] a child but the rod of Correction
[9:41] spanking corporal punishment will drive
[9:43] it from him and I believe that these
[9:46] scriptures can be used and are used to
[9:48] support what we call corporal punishment
[9:51] or to justify physically correcting a
[9:54] child you say well what does that mean
[9:55] is it a switch is it a spank is it am I
[9:58] using a literal or a belt what what is I
[10:01] use and I think that without taking much
[10:03] thought if we just tried to apply it
[10:05] literally truth can be wrongly applied
[10:09] and uh and I'll say it this way and I
[10:11] think we've addressed it in the past
[10:13] where if the heart's not right of the
[10:15] one that's doing the correcting and they
[10:17] just grab a hold of this as you know the
[10:19] rod will drive it from them and they use
[10:22] this without being connected with the
[10:24] thought behind the scripture the intent
[10:26] of even what they might call punishment
[10:29] or I like to say correction that if
[10:31] they're missing that what it what that
[10:34] very act to follow the scripture becomes
[10:37] is not the scriptural Act of correcting
[10:39] the child physically but just abuse and
[10:43] it doesn't mean if it leaves a Mark it's
[10:44] an it's abusive or uh you say well I
[10:47] didn't leave a mark it's what's the
[10:48] intent it's the understanding it's the
[10:50] approach that can change something that
[10:52] the scripture is advocating for and
[10:54] turning it into something that the
[10:56] scripture is not advocating for even
[10:59] though looks like you're doing exactly
[11:00] what the scripture
[11:01] said I do recall when we were
[11:03] ministering on this uh some time ago it
[11:05] was on a Wednesday night H we looked at
[11:07] through scriptures and it's very hard to
[11:09] deny that the Bible is uh teaching these
[11:13] things we clearly see the Bible is
[11:14] teaching it but then we look at the
[11:16] product that those who follow some of
[11:18] these scriptures have produced in their
[11:20] children and the the the thousands of
[11:22] people that say in the studies they've
[11:24] done that said well the kids that were
[11:25] corporately punished turn out with great
[11:27] more mental health issues they become
[11:28] more abusive and the results are very
[11:30] hard to deny and the and what we could
[11:33] say is the word's not wrong but the
[11:35] application was and so you can't judge
[11:38] the word by the results because it
[11:40] wasn't applied in the way that the word
[11:42] calls for it to be
[11:45] applied and so the Bible is by these
[11:48] verses admonishing us to diligently seek
[11:51] useful effective discipline for our
[11:53] children now if it seems like I'm just a
[11:55] out somewhere else real quick I'm really
[11:57] not we're we're still just right real
[11:59] close to our subjects here and it's that
[12:01] correcting that CH trains and
[12:04] disciplines so it's got to be done in
[12:06] love it's got to be forward-looking it's
[12:09] not you're not just trying to and I
[12:10] don't want to get pulled into this but
[12:12] you're not just being uh reactive where
[12:14] you know child spills milk and you told
[12:16] them not to get the milk and so you just
[12:18] you just slap them and you smack them up
[12:19] real good and you tell them to clean
[12:21] clean up the mess and so what you're
[12:22] doing is you're looking backwards to
[12:24] punish them for prior conduct but you
[12:26] want to address it in a way that you uh
[12:28] you take care of or you moderate future
[12:30] conduct in the right way you want to do
[12:33] it to where they're always afraid to
[12:34] drink milk so they never drink milk like
[12:37] why are you breaking your bones why is
[12:38] this happening why because they're
[12:39] afraid to drink milk because you didn't
[12:41] address it so Behavior going forward
[12:43] wasn't really properly corrected and it
[12:45] creates complexes and fears and negative
[12:47] Dynamics so there's an approach to
[12:48] addressing Disobedience that's
[12:51] forward-looking it's love it's training
[12:53] it's cultivating and there's a wisdom
[12:55] that's joined with it Proverbs 29:15 the
[12:58] rod and repr give wisdom so if it's only
[13:01] giving pain it's not the rod and the
[13:03] reproof that the Bible wants the rod and
[13:05] reproof give wisdom but a Child Left to
[13:07] himself bringeth his mother to shame and
[13:10] all the
[13:12] mothers don't say anything the rod and
[13:15] reproof give wisdom but a Child Left to
[13:16] himself bringeth his mother to shame in
[13:18] a lot more ways than we might think
[13:20] because a mother who doesn't train her
[13:22] child it shames her right and that child
[13:25] will act in a way that'll bring the
[13:26] mother reproach there's a lot that's
[13:28] meant in this verse verse but if a child
[13:30] is allowed to remain a child oh just let
[13:34] them be who they want to be explore who
[13:36] they think they are find out for
[13:38] themselves and even as we've maybe seen
[13:40] as of late to where they won't put a
[13:42] gender on the birth certificate because
[13:44] won't name the child because they want
[13:46] they them to figure it out on their own
[13:48] and there's a lot of approaches where
[13:50] this this newborn is going to find their
[13:52] own way and explore their own way and
[13:53] the Bible is saying if you don't train
[13:55] that child up in the way that it should
[13:57] go that's a shame to you and they will
[13:59] shame
[14:01] you they can't just be allowed to remain
[14:03] a child oh isn't that great the goooo
[14:05] Goa a they beautiful and they wonderful
[14:06] just let them just let them enjoy that
[14:07] and be what they want to be there comes
[14:09] a time when you've got to approach the
[14:11] child to train them and let the rod and
[14:14] reproof give wisdom it's what the uh the
[14:18] rod and reproof the correction and even
[14:19] the disciplining and even if we want to
[14:21] say this uh use of a rod this physical
[14:25] punishment the way that you uh trust
[14:27] that you're doing as you feel let with
[14:29] your individual children using love and
[14:32] wisdom and restraint so that it's proper
[14:35] but there is a you've got that's what
[14:37] should give the child wisdom to grow
[14:39] correctly the Bible says Folly is rooted
[14:43] in children at Birth and so it's in
[14:46] their nature and correction is the means
[14:48] of reforming that nature you're not
[14:50] necessar reforming their soul you're not
[14:51] going to get them the Holy Ghost by
[14:52] beating them and you may think you're
[14:55] beating the Devil out of them when you
[14:56] spank them but that's not going to give
[14:57] them the Holy Ghost and if you apply
[15:00] discipline incorrectly you are reforming
[15:02] their nature can cause you can cause a
[15:04] lot of future problems but properly
[15:06] administer this correction is a means of
[15:08] reforming that foolish nature to where
[15:10] they're no longer foolish so foolishness
[15:13] is bound in the heart of a child when
[15:15] one is
[15:16] foolish if there's foolishness they're
[15:18] childlike they lack wisdom so if you
[15:21] when you see like this characterization
[15:22] of one being foolish they haven't
[15:24] properly developed or grown as they
[15:26] ought to what's expected if you
[15:29] if you walked into a restaurant today
[15:31] and you saw a grown man over there with
[15:33] a binky in his
[15:34] mouth sucking on a pacifier you say well
[15:37] that's foolish you look over there and
[15:39] you see a six-month-old doing it you'd
[15:41] be like that's that's not foolish all
[15:44] right you see a man over there with a
[15:45] blanket and a stuffed stuffed teddy bear
[15:48] you say that's that's crazy this man's
[15:50] crazy's acting like a child but then a
[15:51] child doing it you don't even judge it
[15:53] whatsoever and so this is you would
[15:56] train and and and that that's a shame to
[15:58] the right if the guy's gr adult and he's
[16:00] holding on to a blanket and wearing a
[16:02] diaper and sucking on a binky because he
[16:04] never was trained out of
[16:06] that and so this correction properly
[16:09] administered will the Bible says that
[16:12] that it the rod of Correction will drive
[16:15] foolishness away and it will deliver his
[16:17] soul from hell and it'll do it so that
[16:19] he shall not die correction properly
[16:22] applied
[16:25] will will deliver the child keep the
[16:28] child from harm not inflict it I that's
[16:32] a good uh maybe a good way of looking at
[16:34] that is that you if you trained them
[16:37] properly if you discipline them
[16:38] correctly and I I maybe I'm spending
[16:39] more time on this than I envisioned uh
[16:41] but I want to maybe having pointed to
[16:45] this I feel that it it deserves some
[16:47] attention that in training our children
[16:50] and however that we would do that we
[16:52] will save them as the Bible says from
[16:54] death and from harm and injury and that
[16:57] discipline should not be inflicted the
[17:01] injury and so the word says and I would
[17:03] say based upon these scriptures we must
[17:05] discipline our children and it times
[17:07] corporately where there is pain as a
[17:10] consequence they are going to feel it
[17:13] but physical pain alone does not produce
[17:16] the
[17:17] results physical pain alone will not
[17:19] produce the results proposed by the
[17:21] scripture that uh foolishness is bound
[17:23] up in the heart of a child and if you if
[17:26] you give the correction uh then the and
[17:29] reproof will give wisdom you say all the
[17:30] rod and reproof will give wisdom you're
[17:32] a failure and then expect the child to
[17:35] be wise that's not what the Bible's
[17:38] saying it's but even though it is
[17:39] scripturally saying one thing if you
[17:41] don't apply it correctly you won't get
[17:43] the results that the Bible suggest that
[17:45] you will have failure to apply the
[17:47] wisdom and the nurture with the nature
[17:50] of the word will cause
[17:52] abuse by the
[17:54] word gu what I'm saying the Bible says
[17:56] take the rod and correct your child so
[17:59] just grabs the rod corrects the child
[18:01] and it produces different results but
[18:03] yet it was quote unquote by the word in
[18:06] Proverbs 3 chapter 3: 11 and 12 my son
[18:09] despise not the chastening of the Lord
[18:12] neither be weary of his correction for
[18:14] whom the Lord loveth he correct even as
[18:17] a father the son in whom he delighteth
[18:19] when a father has Grace towards his son
[18:21] favor pleasure towards his child even
[18:23] the father who is so loving and kind and
[18:27] smitten with his children a father that
[18:29] loves his children will correct them
[18:31] will chasen them so he says whom the
[18:33] Lord loveth and every son that he
[18:35] receiveth he scourgeth he he he chastens
[18:37] and so don't despise it when the Lord
[18:39] corrects you don't get weary of his
[18:42] correction because even the father who
[18:44] is the most smitten and in love and
[18:46] delights in his child will correct and
[18:49] Scourge and
[18:50] smite or chasen and correct his child
[18:55] but the Bible says in Hebrews 12:11
[18:57] drawing from these various same
[18:58] scriptures now no chastening for the
[19:00] present seem to be joyous but Grievous
[19:03] when we are chastened of the lord we
[19:05] feel it when our parents after the flesh
[19:08] chastened Us in even in a physical way
[19:10] or they used words we felt it
[19:12] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[19:15] Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[19:17] them which are exercised thereby how
[19:19] many have been exercised by chastening
[19:21] how many had some parents that exercised
[19:24] uh uh this kind of chastening and what
[19:27] the if if Don in the right way It
[19:30] ultimately produces this Peaceable fruit
[19:32] of righteousness where you don't see
[19:35] this as a result something's wrong in
[19:37] the application somewhere the word
[19:40] misapplied will not produce the results
[19:42] the word says will uh will
[19:46] transpire you could have the outward
[19:48] appearance and you could have maybe an
[19:50] image or some sort of
[19:53] semblance semblance of what the word is
[19:56] saying in a legalistic way but it's not
[19:59] the proper
[20:00] expression and let me use this again as
[20:02] I'm trying to blend some subjects and go
[20:04] further in uh in this into is there room
[20:06] for Mercy I just feel like there needs
[20:08] to be some of this connection here let
[20:10] me use this example of a False Image
[20:13] here's a false image of Proverbs 13
[20:16] Proverbs 23 Proverbs 22 Proverbs 29
[20:18] Proverbs 3 Hebrews 12 here's a False
[20:20] Image a spanked
[20:22] child and you see a child spanked and
[20:26] you see them crying and maybe you see
[20:27] them being corporate punished and and
[20:30] you look at that and you say well that's
[20:31] a scriptural image but that does that
[20:34] that's not telling the whole story
[20:36] because that isn't the aim of the
[20:37] scripture that isn't the goal to have
[20:39] spank
[20:40] children right I mean if the goal was
[20:43] just to spank children I'd wake up every
[20:45] day and just beat my kids and say well
[20:46] the word of God's been
[20:48] fulfilled you know that's what church
[20:50] becomes right spare the rod SP the child
[20:53] I'm not going to spare you sheep you're
[20:54] going to get it and there's your image
[20:57] spank children that's a False Image
[21:00] because we're not examining the fruit
[21:02] that precedes afterwards we're we're not
[21:04] waiting say well what kind of does it
[21:06] produce Peaceable fruit or does
[21:08] everybody just cow down and cower and
[21:10] everyone obeys the man of the house and
[21:11] everyone's afraid and as soon as the
[21:13] garage door is opening everyone has a
[21:14] panic attack because Dad's coming home
[21:16] and he's going to produce a scriptural
[21:18] image of a home under subjection by
[21:20] producing spank children and a wife that
[21:23] keeps her mouth shut so well that's
[21:25] that's that's a False
[21:27] Image because all you're doing is
[21:29] replicating a rod to the backside of a
[21:32] kid and saying that's the word no that's
[21:34] not the word and in the same way talk
[21:37] about you know maybe hard right here but
[21:39] in the same way we could have a false
[21:41] image of crying babbling
[21:45] youngans right that's what we have we
[21:48] have we have this move we have this look
[21:50] we have this expression of crying
[21:53] shouting screaming dancing
[21:54] tongue-talking people and we say oh that
[21:57] that's the image but it can be a false
[21:58] image because the word is aiming for
[22:00] something
[22:01] more you can't look at the spank child
[22:04] say oh that's wrong well no you can't
[22:06] say that nor can you point to say now
[22:08] that's perfect there's got to be more to
[22:12] this image that God's wanting to
[22:13] accomplish and I want to use that I'm
[22:15] using this example I don't know if you
[22:17] could call it as a fulcrum but just as a
[22:19] a touch Point even as a way of saying
[22:21] that in the same way that these things
[22:23] in Proverbs about correcting children
[22:25] it's a truth it's an absolute truth can
[22:27] be misapplied and used to abuse in the
[22:29] same way other things are used and
[22:32] they're truth but they're used to for
[22:35] the wrong slant the wrong motive without
[22:37] the right purpose it's not yielding the
[22:39] right kind of fruit ultimately that the
[22:41] word of God says should be produced and
[22:43] we can't be deceived into just narrow
[22:46] being narrow-minded about well this is
[22:48] what it says this is what it says but we
[22:50] want to catch the heart of God in
[22:52] everything he has
[22:54] said in Psalms 103: 13 and 18
[22:59] says like as a father pth his children
[23:02] so the Lord pth them that fear
[23:05] Him pth in the Hebrew there is Raam it
[23:08] means to love deeply to be compassionate
[23:11] to have tender affection it means to
[23:14] have
[23:16] mercy as a father pth his children so
[23:19] the Lord pth them that fear Him I so
[23:22] this we'll see it here in the scripture
[23:24] in a moment the Lord's Mercy this
[23:26] compassion this tender affection as a
[23:28] father has this affection a son in whom
[23:31] the father Delights as a father pies his
[23:34] children the Lord pies them that fear
[23:36] Him and so the Lord's uh attitude is
[23:39] hard is the Lord's Mercy is tied to this
[23:41] deep love and compassion and I want you
[23:44] to catch this pity in order to truly
[23:46] have pity as a father pth his child
[23:50] notice not says as a man pies
[23:53] children right for the most part we
[23:55] probably you know are jealous of just
[23:56] children in general they get to nap they
[23:58] have snacks you know right there's
[23:59] things that we might we might pity we
[24:02] might be jealous but in this way it says
[24:03] a father pies his own child why he knows
[24:06] them and not in the sense of wow he's a
[24:09] you know he's a real knucklehead but
[24:10] it's this understanding of that the true
[24:12] condition and the helplessness and even
[24:14] the potential and the struggles they go
[24:15] through so it's rooted in some
[24:17] understanding of the child is the father
[24:19] has this tender affection and compassion
[24:22] and pies his child the Lord pies them
[24:24] that fear Him and notice this connection
[24:25] in verse 14 for he knoweth our frame
[24:28] he remember that we are dust there's
[24:31] your uh uh that connection to as a
[24:34] father knows his child and has
[24:35] compassion the Father Knows us knows our
[24:38] frame knows who we are knows where we
[24:39] come from as for man his days are as
[24:41] grass as a flower of the field so he
[24:43] flourisheth for the wind passeth over
[24:45] and it is gone and the place thereof
[24:46] shall know it no more but the mercy of
[24:50] the Lord is from Everlasting to
[24:52] Everlasting upon them that fear him and
[24:55] his righteousness unto children's
[24:56] children not just the children
[24:58] grandchildren to such as keep his
[25:00] Covenant and to those that remember his
[25:01] Commandments to do them but the mercy of
[25:04] the Lord the Lord pities as a father pth
[25:08] his children this to to love deeply to
[25:10] be compassion have tender affection it
[25:11] means to have mercy and then it says the
[25:13] mercy of the Lord this Hebrew word
[25:15] cassed it speaks of uh to of goodness
[25:20] kindness
[25:21] faithfulness it is often connected with
[25:23] pity and this uh Raam it's this uh
[25:27] compassion this desire the mercy of the
[25:29] goodness of God the kindness of God the
[25:32] faithfulness of the Lord is from
[25:34] Everlasting to Everlasting this is where
[25:36] I want to start to blend some of these
[25:38] concepts of the house of the Lord and
[25:39] youngans with this next subject is there
[25:42] room for
[25:43] Mercy Mercy we know is a very vast
[25:45] subject I've been looking at it aresh
[25:48] myself it's such a large Concept in the
[25:51] scripture misunderstood misapplied
[25:54] controversial in some ways but it's such
[25:57] a important part of the story of
[26:00] redemption and I'd like to as we're
[26:03] looking at the father's attitude towards
[26:04] a child youngans growing up into
[26:08] maturity what I this has come come to me
[26:12] in several different ways as of late
[26:14] that this Mercy is at the heart of
[26:17] this it's it's an element perhaps that's
[26:19] missing that causes the
[26:21] confusion and I'll say this before we go
[26:24] on to our text if you want to turn to 2
[26:25] Samuel 7 I'll start with verse 12
[26:28] that in the house of the Lord just get
[26:30] this picture in your mind in the house
[26:32] of the Lord and how that God arranged I
[26:35] want you to think very spiritually and
[26:37] explore this deeply now that there was
[26:39] an arrangement in the house of the Lord
[26:41] of outer Court inner Court the holiest
[26:43] of holies the most holy place the holy
[26:45] place and that that uh Arrangement as
[26:48] we've looked at in great detail was
[26:50] saying something about God it was uh uh
[26:52] emphasizing about something about God's
[26:54] character and about his house the house
[26:55] the Lord was saying something about God
[26:57] it tells the story of
[26:59] redemption and in the most holy place of
[27:02] all the elements and everything that you
[27:04] read about in the most holy place there
[27:07] was truth and
[27:09] mercy there was really nothing else
[27:11] that's not inside or connected with
[27:14] those that representation in the most
[27:16] holy place there was the ark which
[27:18] contained the law there is your truth
[27:20] and then you had the covering or the
[27:22] seat that was on top of that Ark so that
[27:24] it became one thing and those cherubs
[27:26] forming the covering that was called The
[27:28] Mercy Seat so there's all sorts of stuff
[27:31] everywhere else all sorts of activity in
[27:32] the outer all sorts of offerings and
[27:34] Washings in the inner but once you went
[27:36] in behind that Veil all there was was
[27:37] truth and mercy that should tell you
[27:40] something that should tell you something
[27:43] about God something about the the word
[27:45] and something about the truth and mercy
[27:48] in 2 Samuel 7:12 this Builds on the
[27:51] thought of a father connects with the
[27:53] youngans going up to maturity and this
[27:55] new uh focus on Mercy
[27:58] and these are the words that are being
[28:00] spoken and when th thy days of God to
[28:04] through Nathan to David and when thy
[28:06] days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep
[28:07] with thy fathers I will set up thy seed
[28:09] after thee which shall proceed out of
[28:11] thy bowels and I will establish his
[28:13] kingdom it's speaking very particularly
[28:15] of
[28:16] Solomon yet here David the king who had
[28:19] a desire to build the house of the Lord
[28:20] who couldn't because he was a bloody man
[28:22] he had murdered but yet his house his
[28:25] name right this the son the builder of
[28:27] the family name the the one that the the
[28:30] first born that comes we looked at in
[28:32] the scripture on Wednesday is the one
[28:33] that builds the house and a brother who
[28:35] doesn't perform his duty isn't
[28:36] interested in building the house so it's
[28:38] going to be in the family he says he
[28:39] shall build a house for my name and I
[28:42] will establish the Throne of his kingdom
[28:44] forever and then God says this to David
[28:47] about his own son I will be his father
[28:50] and he shall be my son now that you know
[28:53] I don't know how would you act if
[28:55] somebody went up to you and said hey uh
[28:58] you know your boy over there I'm going
[28:59] to be his daddy he be like Luca don't
[29:02] talk about never mind Booker like that
[29:06] he says I will be his father and he
[29:08] shall be my son if he commit iniquity I
[29:11] will chasten him with the rod of men and
[29:13] with the stripes of the children men now
[29:15] God's telling us something very deep
[29:17] here I think it's just beautiful he says
[29:19] I'm going to be his father he's going to
[29:20] be his son and if he does something
[29:23] wrong I'll correct him with the rod of
[29:25] men there'll be a price to pay with the
[29:27] stripes of the ch
[29:28] but my Mercy shall not depart away from
[29:31] him God is telling us something very
[29:33] important as I took it from Saul whom I
[29:35] put away before thee if you didn't catch
[29:38] Wednesday night I really encourage that
[29:39] those of you who follow are following
[29:41] the the series here go listen to
[29:43] Wednesday night cuz kind of trying to
[29:44] end the thought on the when the youngans
[29:46] don't grow up and Saul is that final
[29:48] example of one who wouldn't listen and
[29:51] because he wouldn't listen he lost
[29:52] something doesn't lose his salvation God
[29:54] didn't call him a reprobate and a
[29:55] heathen but he lost the throne and he
[29:58] lost it for his own children and so we
[30:00] can always have a relationship with God
[30:02] but benefits and privileges that come by
[30:04] that relationship can be forfeited
[30:06] through rebellion and stubbornness which
[30:08] Saul demonstrated and so Saul here is
[30:12] put away he says but says something M
[30:15] remarkable to David I won't take my
[30:17] Mercy away from your son and thine house
[30:20] and thy kingdom shall be established
[30:21] forever before thee thy Throne shall be
[30:23] established
[30:25] forever God is expressing something
[30:27] about
[30:28] the the proper elements of a
[30:30] relationship in this uh and even it
[30:33] speaks of a family relationship I'll be
[30:35] his father and he shall be my son so
[30:36] there's chastening with the rod there's
[30:38] Stripes of a child he's saying if
[30:41] there's going to be a relationship of a
[30:43] parental figure to a child then there's
[30:46] got to be correction there's got to be
[30:47] chastening he says the rod of men and
[30:49] the the stripes of a child we go back to
[30:51] Proverbs and we see those very things
[30:52] that he's talking about but the very
[30:55] next thing he says is but his Mercy
[30:57] would not depart
[30:59] and this is why the house was
[31:01] established
[31:03] forever cuz this Mercy is an essential
[31:05] characteristic it's this it's this
[31:08] necessary attribute maybe I could put it
[31:10] this way it's an absolute necessary
[31:12] material to build the house if you're
[31:15] going to fix it if you're going to
[31:17] establish the house of the Lord you
[31:18] couldn't just throw out all the raw
[31:20] materials you couldn't just have a rod
[31:22] you can't just have stripes you've got
[31:23] to have
[31:24] mercy and God reveals the type of
[31:27] character that fathers should be aiming
[31:29] for that parents and leaders should be
[31:31] aiming for he reveals the type of
[31:33] character that a father should have and
[31:35] it's the type of character that we
[31:36] should seek to cultivate at home because
[31:39] God wants his young to grow up and he's
[31:42] showing us the
[31:44] way that's why I was so encouraged
[31:46] personally and even as a pastor when
[31:48] brother elizer ministered on a deep to
[31:50] respond in the approach that he took is
[31:52] like this is this is necessary when
[31:54] we're looking at things in the scripture
[31:56] be therefore perfect and the great
[31:58] standards that God's wanted to use in
[32:00] our lives and we look at it from our
[32:01] standpoint say God's doing overtime to
[32:03] get me where I need to be and I'm not
[32:04] getting there and then the word of Lord
[32:07] word of the Lord comes along and
[32:08] expresses great Mercy says I'll get you
[32:10] there just keep yielding I'll get you
[32:12] there then brother Reggie preaching on
[32:14] PTSD I wish brother John I wish you
[32:17] wouldn't have spoiled the punchline
[32:19] because man it was just wonderful a
[32:20] posttraumatic stress uh disorder he said
[32:23] but no the d stands for deliverance
[32:25] because God in his Mercy just doesn't
[32:27] want to leave us victims to our trauma
[32:30] he actually can use it right use the
[32:33] trigger use the trauma not only having
[32:36] delivered us but now use it to propel us
[32:38] to Greater Heights and to perfect our
[32:41] character and so God wanting us to grow
[32:45] up he's not just going to use the rod
[32:47] he's not just going to use chasing and
[32:48] he's going to use
[32:50] Mercy it takes speaking the
[32:55] truth you've got you you you've got got
[32:58] to have a standard you've got to tow the
[32:59] line you've got to do things according
[33:01] to the word of
[33:02] God if you fail to speak truth if you
[33:05] fail to correct that's a lacking of
[33:08] truth but an overcorrection is a lack of
[33:11] Mercy an over application or misapplying
[33:14] it or going to some extreme not catching
[33:16] the heart of it that's a lack of Mercy
[33:19] yeah maybe you maybe you don't correct
[33:20] you're lacking truth but if you don't
[33:22] correct correctly you're lacking the
[33:23] mercy and it takes truth and mercy to
[33:26] have Christ amen amen meditate on that
[33:30] you can have
[33:32] truth but if you don't have mercy you
[33:34] don't have all of Christ because truth
[33:37] is something
[33:38] else if it's divorced from
[33:41] Mercy in 1 Corinthians chap 4:
[33:45] 14-6 I want you to see this in the heart
[33:48] of Paul he says I have I write not these
[33:50] things to shame you but as my beloved
[33:53] Sons I warn you as God said that he
[33:55] would be a father to Solomon and that he
[33:57] would Solomon would be his son and that
[33:59] he
[34:00] would uh correct him but his Mercy would
[34:03] never depart from that correction that
[34:05] the correction would not be punitive but
[34:07] it would be remedial restorative that he
[34:09] was looking to promote Solomon and the
[34:11] seed after David to establish a house
[34:13] forever so he was not trying to punish
[34:16] and put away or destroy expressing
[34:18] something very beautiful in God's
[34:19] character Paul is now expressing
[34:22] likewise similar things to the children
[34:24] or his beloved Sons as converts and
[34:26] cians I'm not right in these corrective
[34:28] words just to shame
[34:30] you I'm not just calling you out I'm not
[34:32] just exposing you he says for though you
[34:35] have 10,000 instructors in Christ I
[34:37] think it's important remember correction
[34:38] should never result in shame for though
[34:41] you have 10,000 instructors in Christ
[34:43] you have not yet not many
[34:45] fathers for in Christ Jesus I have
[34:47] begotten you through the gospel Paul is
[34:50] likening himself as to a father in The
[34:52] Gospel so he says wherefore I beseech
[34:53] you be you followers of me now someone
[34:58] that would say that without the wrong
[34:59] heart is wanting to bring followers to
[35:01] themselves make it all about them and
[35:04] it's the the ministry is what I call it
[35:08] and they are both mean and it's all
[35:10] about me and so in this ministry it's
[35:13] gaining followers to themselves but we
[35:14] know Paul said be followers of God as
[35:17] dear children he's saying as I follow
[35:19] Christ follow me so his heart was right
[35:23] and we don't fear uh though you know in
[35:25] our your own household a father should
[35:26] always be praying Lord I want to be the
[35:28] right kind of example because whether I
[35:29] like it or not my children are watching
[35:31] and and and they're going to follow me
[35:33] so I want to walk closely to God and I
[35:36] want to be I want to be like Christ so
[35:38] that as they desire to be like me
[35:39] they're coming closer to God's heart and
[35:42] that they would have their own
[35:43] experience so Paul is expressing this
[35:45] and he starts out by saying this
[35:46] correction is not meant to shame but as
[35:49] a father to you and because there's this
[35:52] relationship and bond of love I'm trying
[35:54] to promote growth so he says be ye
[35:57] followers of me he's not looking for
[35:58] discipline he's not looking for
[35:59] subjection he's not looking for absolute
[36:02] obedience and just say yes sir and if I
[36:04] say jump you say how high or whatever
[36:05] you want to say it's it's one of those
[36:07] things where he says I'm trying to
[36:08] demonstrate I'm trying to teach and
[36:10] cultivate because I want you to
[36:14] become and so the rule and discipline
[36:17] the law or the truth must have the same
[36:19] nature of the truth and Paul's
[36:21] expressing that the nature there has to
[36:23] be a relationship there so that one
[36:25] could understand the heart of the one
[36:26] being corrected and the one being
[36:28] corrected can understand and be
[36:29] connected to the heart of the
[36:32] corrector and it gives that context to
[36:35] where correction discipline training
[36:38] comes from a place where the one doing
[36:39] the teaching understands the condition
[36:41] of the young and wants to promote growth
[36:43] and the young and understands the heart
[36:45] of the teacher and wants to come into
[36:47] the image of the
[36:49] master he says in 1 Thessalonians 21 as
[36:52] you know how we exhorted and comforted
[36:53] and charged every one of you as a father
[36:56] doth his children
[36:58] this is how Paul is writing this is how
[37:00] he approached the church this is how he
[37:02] wrote to his converts we've exhorted and
[37:04] comforted and charged every one of you a
[37:07] father exhorts he Comforts and charges
[37:09] as a father doth his children so Paul
[37:12] had to speak truth but he's not just
[37:14] speaking truth he's showing
[37:16] Mercy we've identified this here
[37:19] recently in Galatians 4:19 my little
[37:20] children of whom I travail and birth
[37:22] again until Christ be formed in you in
[37:25] Galatians he's talking about the subject
[37:27] of adoption he's looking how that one
[37:29] would just would not just begin in
[37:32] Christ but would grow into the image of
[37:35] Christ having begun in Christ that you
[37:37] had grow to this maturity and Paul was
[37:39] striving and teaching he was exhorting
[37:41] he was comforting he was charging he was
[37:43] not riding to shame but he was
[37:44] approaching the church and saying hard
[37:46] things but he was joining it together
[37:48] with Mercy because he didn't want just
[37:49] to have disciples to himself he wanted
[37:51] to see Christ in
[37:53] them that was his aim Christ be formed
[37:57] manifest itself in attitude and behavior
[38:00] and conduct that morphe to where Christ
[38:02] be formed in you to where you are the
[38:04] very bearer of Christ Image in his heart
[38:07] and to do this it took
[38:10] pity it took love it took truth and it
[38:13] took
[38:14] Mercy in order to know how and to
[38:18] properly cultivate this image look at
[38:20] how he addressed the Corinthian Church
[38:21] many called it out but he did it in such
[38:24] a way to where he addressed it he even
[38:26] they think to them he says What would
[38:27] you want me to come to you with a rod
[38:29] and and some of us would read in
[38:30] Proverbs and say that's exactly what you
[38:32] should do
[38:34] Paul see you want me to come and you
[38:36] want me to beat it out of you he said
[38:37] would you want me to come with love I
[38:39] said well that doesn't mean there's no
[38:40] Rod doesn't mean there's not correction
[38:42] doesn't mean the words won't sting or
[38:43] hurt but what he's saying is that what
[38:45] do you want me to do just come in and
[38:46] start uh beating you shaming you tearing
[38:50] things up or would you want me to come
[38:52] with the rod of Correction and reproof
[38:53] that gives wisdom would you want me to
[38:56] come and address it as a father with his
[38:58] children and not just an angry Shepherd
[39:01] who's sick of
[39:03] sheep don't have the love of God in our
[39:06] heart
[39:07] right so in Galatians chapter 3: 1 to 4
[39:10] here's Paul giving us this he's
[39:14] demonstrating
[39:15] this all foolish
[39:19] Galatians foolishness is bound in the
[39:22] heart of a child and he's saying you're
[39:25] childlike
[39:28] all the foolishness isn't out of you yet
[39:29] who hath Bewitched you that you should
[39:31] not obey the truth before whose eyes
[39:34] Jesus Christ hath been evidently set
[39:36] forth crucified among you this only
[39:38] would I learn of you this is the only
[39:41] question I have I got one question to
[39:42] ask he says received you the Spirit by
[39:44] The Works of the law or by the hearing
[39:46] of
[39:47] Faith it's one thing he wants to know
[39:49] but he's going to break it up into a few
[39:51] different questions receive you the
[39:52] Spirit by The Works of the law or by the
[39:53] hearing of Faith how did you receive the
[39:54] spirit through Works did you did you
[39:56] earn it did you jump high enough what
[39:58] did you do or did Faith hearing the word
[40:01] and a confirmation of your faith was the
[40:03] Seal of God so he says are you so
[40:05] foolish are you so childish are you so
[40:07] immature having begun in the spirit
[40:10] hearing the word believing the word the
[40:13] faith in God's word the Seal of God the
[40:15] birth is a seal of your faith not your
[40:18] shouting not your emotion not your works
[40:21] but having begun in the spirit are you
[40:22] now made perfect by this flesh how
[40:24] childish are you to think that you can
[40:27] take control of this process he says
[40:29] have you suffered so many things in vain
[40:32] he says if it be yet in vain and I love
[40:33] that because suffering is the process of
[40:35] character development and once we've
[40:37] endured and the sufferings of this
[40:39] present time are cultivating this great
[40:41] Glory inside of us so he's saying that
[40:43] you are to this place where you've
[40:45] suffered but if you remain foolish it's
[40:48] in vain if you don't grow up it's in
[40:50] vain he goes but if it yet be in vain
[40:52] because I'm calling you out cuz I don't
[40:55] want you to remain foolish I I don't
[40:57] want you to remain immature you're not
[40:59] growing up and this is where I see this
[41:02] overlap to in this growing from emphy to
[41:05] adulthood it takes truth and
[41:08] mercy it takes it takes this tremendous
[41:11] balance in the word of God that can only
[41:13] come from God everything in the I guess
[41:17] it's such a man it's just leod DEA I
[41:20] think it's just the best way it's just
[41:21] gray it's everything's mixed CU on one
[41:23] hand you say well it's it's it's
[41:25] polarized and you it's on on the left
[41:27] it's on the right and everything's
[41:29] polarized and and then you start getting
[41:31] into it and you're like I don't even
[41:33] know where they all stand it's all
[41:35] confusing nothing makes sense and you
[41:37] got this side that says this and that
[41:39] side and everybody's trying to pull it
[41:40] every every all these different sides
[41:42] and so we get into this idea that
[41:43] there's this it's just this binary
[41:45] system and we're saying oh yeah that's
[41:46] right everyone's over here and
[41:47] everyone's over there then we hear
[41:48] somebody saying no it's not non it's
[41:50] it's non-binary it's nonbinary like it's
[41:51] got to be nonb wait wait what's going
[41:53] on it's crazy out there and the only way
[41:57] you're going to find the balance is to
[41:58] tap into the heart of God to really
[42:01] catch the heartbeat of the word of God
[42:02] and that's what's going to help help you
[42:04] to take a look at a situation and not be
[42:06] polarized yourself and not hate this
[42:09] side and clean lean to this side and get
[42:11] mixed up in the politics of it but live
[42:13] Above It Rise Above It resurrect take a
[42:16] step higher out of leod DEA and come
[42:18] into the Capstone age in your heart and
[42:19] your relationship with God to where you
[42:21] can look at all the rest and know where
[42:23] they are and have
[42:25] pity it's going to take
[42:28] Mercy together with this truth he says
[42:30] cuz they've been
[42:32] Bewitched I mean that's quite a quite a
[42:36] statement right they've been Bewitched
[42:38] it's to bring evil on one by feigning
[42:40] praise it's using deceit you know ah
[42:42] you've been Bewitched kind of coaxed
[42:44] into this evil eye they CH Charmed I
[42:48] mean Bewitched they've been Charmed into
[42:51] something they've been kind of coaxed
[42:53] and cultivated and used that that in
[42:55] innocence and that infan and use kind of
[42:58] their their trusting and their
[42:59] enthusiasm and bewi them into
[43:02] transmitting their Zeal towards just
[43:04] blowing out a lot of
[43:06] steam in works of the
[43:09] Flesh and when he says Bewitched I know
[43:11] we kind of just think about you know the
[43:13] twitch of a nose and poof something
[43:15] happening but it's it speaks to a
[43:19] deception and Jesus says in Matthew
[43:21] 24:24 that it's going to be so close in
[43:23] the end time the spirit of Deceit and
[43:26] the false Christ false Christ and it
[43:28] says he's go they're going to produce
[43:29] and show by false prophecies and signs
[43:33] and wonders that are great and the signs
[43:36] and wonders going be so great that if it
[43:38] were possible it would deceive the very
[43:41] elect such an image and such a false
[43:44] image that unless God would say I will
[43:47] not let it happen it would deceive the
[43:51] very
[43:51] elect I see the same with Solomon and
[43:55] the words of Christ too
[43:57] H H uh excuse me the words of God
[43:59] through Nathan to David that what if it
[44:02] wasn't for God just saying he would do
[44:04] it it wouldn't have
[44:07] happened and so God makes it an
[44:09] impossibility that the elect can be
[44:10] deceived but yet it tells us there's a
[44:13] bewitching that in our foolishness in
[44:15] our infancy in our youthful state if
[44:17] we're not growing properly then we fail
[44:19] to discern Paul says having our s senses
[44:22] exercised as we grow by going from milk
[44:24] to meat we're able to like whoa there's
[44:26] a bewitching here this is muddled this
[44:28] is confusing this is a Pale Horse I
[44:30] don't I'm not sure what's happening here
[44:31] this is really really h h h there's a
[44:33] mixture here I need to know I need to
[44:35] understand I need to get through
[44:37] this there'll be those that are
[44:39] Bewitched in Matthew 7 that come before
[44:41] the Throne of God and they'll say Lord
[44:43] we've prophesied in thy name we've cast
[44:46] out devils in thy name and in thy name
[44:49] done many
[44:50] wonderful wonderful works and his
[44:54] response in Matthew 7:23 is not to say
[44:57] no you didn't he's just say depart from
[45:00] me I never knew you and he says you're
[45:03] workers of
[45:05] iniquity toward still at the end of the
[45:07] day the prophecy the casting and the
[45:11] working amounted to
[45:14] iniquity they elicit their works and his
[45:17] his summation in the end is oh at the
[45:19] end of the day all your works are
[45:22] iniquity
[45:23] how they're performing the signs they're
[45:25] performing the Wonders things are
[45:27] happening what would it become a False
[45:29] Image because it didn't produce the
[45:32] fruit that the seed is supposed to
[45:34] produce it might look like True Vine it
[45:37] might act like true word it might look
[45:39] like the truth but at the end when you
[45:41] examine the fruits of it what does it
[45:43] promote and produce in the end he says
[45:45] man I'm sorry you did run
[45:48] well but who who who kept you from
[45:51] obeying the truth it looked good
[45:54] everything was lining up just right but
[45:56] you you failed in the mercy you you
[45:59] failed in the application you failed in
[46:00] the growth you failed in the image
[46:04] ultimately and I believe this is at the
[46:06] heart of what brother brandham was
[46:07] teaching there in the sh Port Series in
[46:09] 1965 he takes that sermon the next day
[46:12] after invisible union he says that's the
[46:13] reason I say people can jump up and down
[46:15] and speak in tongues people can shout
[46:17] lay hands on the sick and heal the sick
[46:19] and so forth by
[46:20] faith and don't you dare say it's not
[46:25] God right I remember one time somebody
[46:28] said oh did you hear Vander Holyfield
[46:30] said that he went to Benny Hinn's
[46:31] meeting and he prayed for him and and
[46:33] God healed a hole in his heart he said
[46:35] God didn't do that I'm like why not I
[46:38] mean God's A Healer that's what God does
[46:42] so if I if I I didn't have to believe
[46:45] that brother Benny Hinn well you know
[46:47] was upstanding honest you know good guy
[46:51] or whatever and I'm not advocating for a
[46:52] Vindication of his ministry thank God
[46:55] that Benny Henn was able to promote
[46:57] enough atmosphere for Evander Holyfield
[47:00] to say I believe God's A Healer and
[47:01] healed the whole in his heart who did
[47:03] that not Benny hen my god did so I don't
[47:07] have to disparage and run down and shame
[47:09] and tear apart and judge all because
[47:12] maybe it feels like some sort of threat
[47:13] to me no I believe that I believe that's
[47:15] what God does by faith they can do all
[47:17] these he says great things by the
[47:20] spirit but still be
[47:23] lost and he says anointed ones
[47:27] there is an anointing there is a move
[47:29] there's things that happen and we want
[47:31] to be careful that we never say that's
[47:32] not God but God's not just a move flesh
[47:36] God's not just a promoter of excitement
[47:38] God is a Visionary father who looks at
[47:41] our lives and says I'll provide these
[47:42] things for you I'll even give you these
[47:44] things in the Youth of your experience
[47:46] because I want to establish you and I
[47:47] want to cultivate you but as we go in
[47:49] this I want to grow you to be more
[47:51] mature more solid I want you to learn
[47:53] how to swim without splashing all the
[47:54] water out of the pool I want you to be
[47:56] able to take that that Steam and put it
[47:57] in the into the engine to cause those
[48:00] Wheels to move and God has a way of
[48:01] training us because he's not just
[48:04] interested interested in truth without
[48:06] Mercy but they have been met
[48:08] together and at the end of the sermon an
[48:10] invisible Union brother Brams has an Al
[48:12] alar call he says I wonder around the
[48:14] altar now those who are kneeling here
[48:16] many of you claim to be Christians but
[48:17] you felt there's always something
[48:18] somewhere that you didn't possess wow
[48:21] there's some
[48:22] self-examination you know something's
[48:24] missing he says you might have done all
[48:26] the religious Act remember he may be
[48:28] talking to people who thought they were
[48:30] the
[48:31] youngans he may be talking to people who
[48:34] demonstrated all these outward signs and
[48:36] because they did they thought that's it
[48:38] this is the seal this is the This is the
[48:41] End you might have done all the
[48:43] religious acts you might have shouted
[48:44] you might have done all things might
[48:46] have danced in the spirit you might have
[48:47] spoken tongues and no one can say
[48:49] anything wrong against that that's true
[48:51] that's all good and we say Amen it's
[48:55] true it's all good right but you see
[48:57] that's gifts of the Spirit without the
[48:59] spirit or we can say according to how he
[49:02] explains it in other places it can be
[49:05] the the the gift of the spirit without
[49:07] the spirit
[49:09] indwelling if the spirit was there that
[49:11] feeling wouldn't be condemned like that
[49:14] so he said God's dealing with your heart
[49:16] as a father dealing deeply with you
[49:19] don't don't chase that voice away don't
[49:21] rationalize well I did this I did that
[49:23] follow that
[49:24] leading it's how God deals with you
[49:26] through his spirit in the heart of a man
[49:29] do you really sincerely hear at the
[49:30] altar believe that right now while
[49:31] you're here that just the act of turning
[49:34] yourself loose and we're all like oh
[49:37] yeah that that that's what I'm talking I
[49:40] want to get loose right and he says not
[49:42] an emotion now because that's what some
[49:44] people think I just want to let loose
[49:47] says not an emotion but in a genuine
[49:49] unadulterated faith that God notice this
[49:52] this is what this is what he wants you
[49:53] to let loose too that God will receive
[49:55] you and nurture you with his word until
[49:59] you are eagles yourself and can
[50:04] fly he's telling he's telling them in
[50:07] such a beautiful way truth and mercy
[50:09] saying if you're not a young and you
[50:11] need to be a young and if you're young
[50:12] and you need to grow
[50:14] up you need the baptism so will you now
[50:17] in an act of turning Yourself Loose with
[50:20] a sincere belief in your heart not an
[50:25] emotion why is he tampering that because
[50:27] it was them there that Pentecostal
[50:31] hotbed that would tend to those emotions
[50:33] he says no not an emotion now those
[50:35] Sensations with it emotion goes with it
[50:37] he's not saying anything against that he
[50:38] said that's all good but he says but in
[50:40] genuine unadultered faith that God will
[50:43] receive you and God chastens and
[50:45] scourges every son that he receiveth God
[50:47] will receive you and nurture you this is
[50:49] not just an experience but he will
[50:51] nurture you with his
[50:53] word until you are born again by the the
[50:56] word of God and teaches you how to
[51:00] fly where you grow
[51:04] up amen I'm just going to stop there
[51:08] we'll pick up the rest of it on
[51:09] Wednesday night let's
[51:17] stand is there room for
[51:21] Mercy is there a place and I'm skipping
[51:24] a lot here so I don't want this to seem
[51:26] disjointed but I want to read a
[51:27] scripture to close just to kind of wet
[51:30] your whistle a little bit in this is
[51:32] there a place in our hearts is there a
[51:33] place in our homes is there a place in
[51:35] this church for
[51:37] Mercy I touch it on it Lord willing a
[51:40] little bit on Wednesday night or is
[51:42] there just a lot of personal opinion and
[51:45] judgment or is there just
[51:49] indifference well are realize sometimes
[51:51] if we've been the victim of harsh
[51:53] judgment if we've been a victim of the
[51:55] word misapply sometimes we can just
[51:57] swing the other way and just be
[52:00] indifferent so much uh vital and animous
[52:04] and hatred and such uh spewing forth of
[52:07] anger towards something and we don't
[52:09] share in that so what happens is we just
[52:11] become indifferent towards it you find
[52:14] out so- and so is doing something and
[52:15] this is happening and you're like oh
[52:17] well you know I don't get all worked up
[52:19] like they do about it well yeah maybe
[52:22] you don't need to get worked up about it
[52:24] but maybe you shouldn't just be so blasé
[52:25] about it
[52:27] but is so in that is it all indifference
[52:31] is it all legalism is it all harsh or is
[52:33] there room for Mercy it's the mercy that
[52:36] calls away from those sides and brings
[52:38] us to the very center
[52:40] amen and as we're using this image of
[52:43] youngans and a a certain scriptural
[52:46] pattern that we can cabbage down on or
[52:48] even statements of the Prophet to say
[52:50] well this is what we need to produce
[52:51] this is what we need to produce and you
[52:53] can't really argue that's what the
[52:54] spirit produces but is there enough
[52:56] Mercy in our hearts to say that not only
[52:59] is that
[53:00] true but that that that there it must
[53:03] yield the Peaceable fruit that with it
[53:05] there's Mercy to teach and to train and
[53:07] to discipline and take that be press
[53:10] into the perfect things of
[53:13] God and if you could take time to read
[53:15] if you want to read the book of Hosea
[53:17] it's not long if you want to read
[53:19] chapter 6 it's really at the heart of
[53:20] some of these things I'm speaking on but
[53:21] in Hosea chapter 6 particular verses 1
[53:24] to 7 verse 6 it says for I desired mercy
[53:27] so where he's saying I've smitten but
[53:29] I'm going to heal I've I've scourged
[53:30] I've done these but I'm going to bind
[53:32] you up he says I'm going to revive you
[53:34] I'm going to live in my presence and
[53:35] you're going to know the Lord he says I
[53:37] desired mercy and not
[53:40] sacrifice and the knowledge of God more
[53:42] than burnt
[53:44] offerings think of that Saul was bent on
[53:49] justifying his Disobedience because he
[53:51] could perform all sorts of religious
[53:53] acts and Samuel said no no to bayy is
[53:56] better than sacrifice to listen to God
[53:59] to hearken to God is better than the fat
[54:01] of rams and here in Hosea says you know
[54:04] what Mercy is better than sacrifice God
[54:06] desired mercy God didn't want the
[54:09] sacrifice this listen I hope you catch
[54:11] this he it wasn't the sacrifice that he
[54:13] wanted the offerings the praise the
[54:15] blood the Bullocks the incense and all
[54:17] it wasn't all that that he wanted what
[54:19] he wanted was
[54:21] Mercy it wasn't all about the offerings
[54:23] and the outer court and the inner court
[54:25] that was all a process to get us to that
[54:26] place of mercy and the knowledge of
[54:29] God it was all a process to bring us to
[54:32] a place of that behind the veil the most
[54:34] holy Place into the house of God the
[54:36] true Dwelling Place of the
[54:37] shikina to where when you come in behind
[54:40] that Veil all that other stuff is behind
[54:41] you it was part of this process to get
[54:43] you where you are now but there now in
[54:45] his presence what is there mercy and
[54:47] Truth he desired mercy and the knowledge
[54:50] of God more than the sacrifice more than
[54:52] the offerings and if the sacrifice and
[54:54] offerings bring us to that place we can
[54:56] never do away with them but we got to
[54:57] recognize what it was for he says but
[55:00] they like men have transgressed the
[55:01] Covenant there have have they dealt
[55:04] treacherous
[55:06] treacherously against
[55:08] me should I have you all say
[55:11] treacherously yeah thank you I couldn't
[55:13] even get it right my
[55:17] interpreter without
[55:20] Mercy against
[55:22] God he desired Mercy not sacrifice and
[55:26] the the knowledge of God more than burnt
[55:28] offerings Lord help me search my heart
[55:32] is there room for
[55:34] Mercy you're students of the Bible you
[55:36] know this is an important subject in the
[55:39] end times when judgment comes and and
[55:42] there's this oh is there when does mercy
[55:44] in when is it over what what where do we
[55:46] stand today in the urgency of the hour I
[55:49] in my heart say is there room for Mercy
[55:53] let's pray our gracious Heavenly Father
[55:56] Lord our we're examining our hearts
[56:00] today we're asking ourselves is there is
[56:03] there
[56:03] [Music]
[56:05] room Lord you made a place for us at
[56:07] your
[56:08] table you found room for
[56:12] us you made room in your house
[56:16] you you built a house Lord you allowed
[56:19] Solomon to build the house after
[56:21] dwelling he said I all this time I
[56:22] followed you I never lived in a house of
[56:24] Cedar and I lived behind a tent in the
[56:28] Tabernacle I never asked for anything
[56:31] more and then David says I want to I
[56:33] want to build a place I want to build a
[56:35] place for you permanent God said I
[56:37] didn't ask for it
[56:39] but what house will you build me where's
[56:41] the place of my
[56:43] rest and you said I'll allow Solomon to
[56:46] build this
[56:48] house and in the very image of what that
[56:51] house was to you you said I'll be a
[56:54] father to him and he'll be my son son
[56:56] and I'll correct him and I'll train him
[56:59] and I'll discipline him but my Mercy
[57:01] will never leave
[57:03] him and isn't that what your house
[57:05] always represented whether it be the
[57:07] Tabernacle in the wilderness or the
[57:09] temple there in Jerusalem it was
[57:12] you with your
[57:14] family it's your way of dwelling with
[57:16] your
[57:17] children you didn't even care that it
[57:19] was a
[57:20] tent you just loved having your
[57:23] family positioned around you
[57:27] everyone with their ENT door facing
[57:30] you and you gathered them together and
[57:32] it didn't matter to you that it was just
[57:34] a temporary and these staves and these
[57:37] Transitions and the curtains and
[57:38] everything you were at home in your
[57:42] people and Lord when David built you
[57:45] that had that Vision to build you a
[57:47] temple and Solomon brings it to pass
[57:49] Lord you were pleased to come when that
[57:51] Ark settled in that place once again
[57:53] your shakana glory declared you were
[57:55] amongst your people
[57:56] in your
[57:58] [Music]
[58:01] house and Lord it has such
[58:04] a such a message to
[58:07] us that what you desire more than
[58:11] sacrifice and offering more than great
[58:12] signs and wonders more than talking in
[58:15] tongues and gifts and all these other
[58:17] things Lord that what you
[58:19] want is the knowledge of
[58:23] you and you recognize that in order for
[58:25] us to ever come into that Union that
[58:28] perfect union you're going to have to
[58:29] have a lot of Mercy on
[58:31] us and Lord as you made room for
[58:36] mercy and there in the shikina glory not
[58:39] only did you place your
[58:42] law but you
[58:44] wanted that wood overlaid with gold and
[58:47] there between the two
[58:49] cherubims you would come and settle down
[58:52] and you wanted to be called The Mercy
[58:54] Seat
[58:56] that's the place that you wanted to meet
[58:59] us and so you
[59:02] designate a
[59:04] mercy that'll never
[59:07] end help us father to make room for this
[59:10] Mercy forgive us Lord for our failures
[59:13] and our
[59:14] mistakes Lord I pray that you forgive me
[59:16] as a husband and as a father Lord if I
[59:19] failed in this
[59:21] Mercy Lord I pray that you forgive me as
[59:24] a pastor that if truth has been lifted
[59:28] up in
[59:30] Mercy lay it aside Lord we quickly take
[59:33] it back
[59:36] up recognize Lord to not speak the truth
[59:39] as a lack of truth but Lord to mishandle
[59:42] truth as a lack of Mercy I don't want to
[59:44] be guilty
[59:46] Lord bless us today as we desire your
[59:48] loving Embrace as we believe that you're
[59:50] with us and you've confirmed your
[59:52] presence may you be merciful to our
[59:54] hearts Lord may you bless our children
[59:56] children bless our family heal those
[59:58] that are
[59:59] sick be a comfort to those that are
[1:00:02] visitors
[1:00:03] today Lord May above all may your peace
[1:00:06] guide them may they know that you're
[1:00:08] real you're mindful of them Lord that
[1:00:10] you have their best in
[1:00:12] mind Lord I pray this in my heart just
[1:00:15] now recalling the things that we've
[1:00:17] skipped over how that you as a father
[1:00:20] know each one of us in such a particular
[1:00:22] way where you would not force anything
[1:00:24] on us
[1:00:26] so Lord I will not force anything on
[1:00:29] anyone
[1:00:30] else but admonish them to receive you
[1:00:33] completely and holy without
[1:00:35] reservation bless us I pray Lord as we
[1:00:38] dismiss this service shortly as we
[1:00:40] worship you be with us in the name of
[1:00:42] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
