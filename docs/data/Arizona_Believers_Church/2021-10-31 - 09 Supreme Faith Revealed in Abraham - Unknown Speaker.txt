TRANSCRIPT
========================================
genesis chapter 11 let's start with verse 1 and then i'm going to skip down towards chapter 12 or maybe just skip to chapter 12. and then want to draw heavily from these verses at the outset but with save some time by not having to go back and read them but i want to read them now together it says and the whole earth was one of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go two let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the lord scattered them abroad from fence upon the face of all the earth face of all the earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth the next several verses a dozen or so verses verses 10 to 26 are giving the lineage of until of shem to abram and then verses 27 to 32 talk about the movements of abram early in his life but then i want to look at chapter 12 the first three verses genesis chapter 12 verses 1 to 3 as a contrast to those first nine verses in genesis chapter 11. now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed amen you can be seated we continue on the subject of supreme faith revealed in abraham and one thing that we're kind of zeroing in on our is how the details in abraham's life uh reveal important characteristics to help us to relate to the faith of abraham and we take abraham's faith out of context and we make it this it is a mighty faith it's a supernatural faith but we can almost make it an idol as instead of a role model or something that we feel that we can follow behind and have ourselves one thing we're trying to identify in particular is how that abraham is used to portray the plan of god so when god calls abraham he has something he wants to accomplish in his life for abraham himself so there's something that's important to abraham something that god is accomplishing in abraham's life but he's also wanting to portray something in the movements and the actions and the work of god in his life and so it's important to it would be important to understand abraham historically it'd be important to understand his life in his in terms of him being memorialized in scripture but because he's used to express something to us the specifics in his life hold very great importance to us who are of that same faith and in abraham's grace covenant this is kind of a key statement that we're drawing from it says what is he doing he's identifying an event in abraham's life where god is visiting him and he said he's showing to abraham this what he's going to do to abraham's seed so there's something that god is accomplishing in the moment in the in the chapter genesis chapter 18 uh 17 wherever it may be god's doing something in the moment but what he's doing at that time is also expressing something to us so that we know the way that god dealt with abraham to bring him to a perfect faith and that supreme faith on mount moriah god also will do to his seed and so as we look at these verses that we read today and we looked at we began in chapter 11 the bible shares specific details in order to give the proper context to his faith so it's going to give us details that help us to give context to his faith that the bible is sharing details it's not um there's there's really no fluff in this it's provided to us and given to us in such a way to where it gives context to abraham's faith it helps us to identify a pattern of god in abraham's life and then even the process that god is putting abraham through to bring him to a perfect faith and so as is if we even begin went back to genesis chapter one you say well we know why that's there and we know why this is there let's just remind ourselves that genesis chapter 1 and each proceeding verse all the way up to chapter 11 is not fluff god's just not kind of putting it in there as a preamble that doesn't really matter these things are all very very specific they're in there for very specific purposes because even from genesis chapter 1 to genesis chapter 11 god is laying the foundation for election and he's laying the the uh the foundation for election by grace he's laying the foundation for salvation by faith so these first 11 chapters that we could read from and there's been a lot that i've been drawing from personally as i've been preparing for these services in the earlier chapters of the bible genesis 1 genesis chapter 3 to understand what god is to give context and meaning to what he does when he calls abraham now we didn't read the verses but the end of chapter 11 as it gets to the generations of terror and how terror begat abram and then it says that they went they took wives and they married and then they details their movements the end of chapter 11 introduces us to abraham and his extended family his father his brothers his nephews their wives his own wife and it tells us that they moved out of her and so this is we're introduced to abraham a little bit of his family and then we're told immediately that he's moving but understanding the beginning of chapter 11. not just zero in and on those last few verses of chapter 11 but the beginning understanding the beginning of chapter 11 helps us to fully grasp abraham's calling and the reasons for his movement and a lot of this is going to be reviewed from wednesday night but i just feel very compelled to go back over these and i feel like i'm going really fast this morning maybe faster than normal but it's just because i feel very pressed to get to something in particular but there's a way that i have to take to get there so i appreciate your patience and your and your pull on the word of god so as we read in genesis chapter 11 verses 1 to 9 we see what we call with the story of the tower of babylon and in looking at the tower babel it gives us some background to what they're thinking and what their motives and objectives were so we understand the character of the people and then based upon their action there's a response from god they do something and god is responding to what they do and we read how they say let us build us and in saying let us build us that was self-reliance we're going to do this ourselves this is something we want to accomplish on our own so there's this self-reliance at the beginning of genesis chapter 11. and then they say let us make us a name and so their self-ambition this is about making their name great and making themselves to be remembered and then they are doing this so that lest we be scattered over the face of all the earth and so there's a self-protection that's in there self-preservation so you begin to recognize how this is all centered around self in a way of what i can do self-reliance and self-ambition and self-preservation and then it says lest we be scattered upon the the face of the whole earth and there's a number of scriptures we could look at and and i'll just even skip in action chapter 17 verse 26 it even speaks how by one blood we've been made to spread over all the earth that would be the blood that came off the ark uh the blood of noah um it's it's his sons and their wives it kind of represents this mingled blood this mixed blood that comes forth from off the ark and it's caused all mankind to spread out upon the face of the earth and it's god has determined the bounds of their habitation lords god wanted them to be spread out over all the earth and that god wanted them to have a certain habitation and to fill up the earth and to to subdue it and to spread out not just to live in one place but to spread out and so when they didn't want to be scattered over the earth it was rebellion against god's word and these are important things to kind of recognize this self-reliance self-ambition self-preservation and then this rebellion against god's word and they're saying let us build us a city and a tower they're doing this to prevent the separation we don't want to be scattered or we don't want to be separated so there's a forced unity that's taking place this is where you belong this is where you're supposed to be we're not supposed to go out from here let's stay in this one area or stay right here in this city and in this tower and we mentioned it wednesday night and i think it just it really behooves us to ponder it to a great extent is when they begin to build a city and a tower they were wanting to make the entity you could call it the state the government the church whatever look at the organization of the entity greater than the individual leadership of god in a person's life they're making that greater than the individual and they want the individual to sacrifice their liberty and sacrifice the leadership of god sacrifice their obedience to god to make the name of the city great and a city that's a place that's a guarded city it speaks of something being guarded set up with the watch and so there's protection there and let us build us a city to protect ourselves a tower has a very interesting meaning it's an elevated stage it's a raised a raised bed or pulpit so they wanted to build something that would be raised up it means to that word comes from to grow or to become important to become great to promote or to make powerful they wanted this to have the preeminence among mankind they wanted this to be the the thing that everyone looked to and everyone remembered and this is our legacy and this is what we have built and as you read these descriptions of self-reliance and self-ambition and self-preservation and let us make ourselves great and let's watch after ourselves and protect ourselves and build this great monument it's that it speaks of the same attitude that exists today in laodicea the same things we read in revelations chapter 3 of being rich and increased with good and goods and having everything they need and not needing anything it's the same attitude we find in genesis chapter 11. and they're building a city and a tower whose top may reach under heaven this is a monument of pride and pretense and notice i want you to think of this language because we're going to find similar expressions later in the word of god today how they wanted to reach unto heaven they wanted to build this uh this thing that would make them great and important it's a monument of pride and they're doing it to arrogantly and pridefully avoid god's judgment why they had it very recent in their memory and even with sham being alive during this time they would have known about the flood it was very right there in their memory and their in their mindset in the same way that maybe to us we think about that we hear of the great depression and though we may not have lived in it we know those who have and it's something that's very prominent in our history and our oral storytelling and we know about this and maybe we'd want to do things to avoid it well they knew about the flood that covered the whole earth they thought if we can build a tower high enough if god wants to judge us again we can avoid his judgments so there's a lot of arrogance involved in this it's rebellion against god's people now genesis chapter 11 verses 5 to 9 the lord comes down to see what they're doing and sees the city that they build and he responds to the pride and the ambition of the people and he does so as the scripture says by confounding their language which means to mix or mingle by sowing to confound it means to confuse and he does this specifically that they may not understand one another so here are people who are rebelling they're self-ambitious they're they're preserving themselves they want to present prevent separation they're doing all these things arrogantly and pridefully and they're they're falling they're following a wicked way in a wicked path and instead of god coming down saying hey guys stop he actually confounds their languages and causes a misunderstanding and causes confusion to accomplish his will that they would spread out over the earth and he causes this misunderstanding god broke them apart god caused confusion by confounding their language they're no longer able to communicate communicate with one another and then this spreads in that over the earth according to the plan of god so now they're spread out like god wanted them to spread out and the bible tells us that this city and this tower is called babel if you were to look it up in other translations i think they stayed very faithful to this expression of babel because it it holds the that's the most common term we hear the tower of babel but it's the same word that's also translated to babylon so very well could have been translated to a city in a tower called and they called the tower they call this place babylon it's in the plain of shine or it's in chaldea it's a very specific place where they erected this tower and they built this city and we could have very easily called it babylon now in genesis chapter 12 and i appreciate you being patient with me and i i i have great comfort knowing that just about all of you have heard me preach before so if you've heard me preach once you've got some idea how long it takes me to make my point and uh and i know it can be very very difficult difficult to to like wait through it all but just remember there's a picnic afterwards and we want to get there so pull me through it so we can get there so in genesis chapter 12 verses 1-3 now god having just in the prior chapter visited uh babel the lord visits abraham and he visits him in ur the same place in the same region in a city in southern babylonia he visits him in ur and there's a lot of details about this city they're very interesting it was a center of moon worship it was a very thriving city a very large city and what god begins to do is he deals differently with abraham than he had with abraham's ancestors he is and what god is wanting to do is distinguish his plan his will and his work from the plan of man because a man could have built this tower and done something great and people could have marveled that says isn't it wonderful what god has done and how he's restored mankind and post flood he's allowed them to build this great civilization this great beautiful city and he's allowed them to build this great tower that they'll never be killed by a flood again and and however you'd want to spin it there'd be a way that people could have looked at that and thought that this was the blessings of god because how beautiful it was and how great it was but god calls abram in his simplicity and in his alone as a man just calling him he does it to distinguish between the work of man and the plan of god or god's will and as he speaks to abraham now if you can just help me or just on your own make this connection begin to contrast we've kind of lifted up what babel was in babylon god begins to deal with abraham and his life is so different and it contrasts so differently than what's taking place in genesis chapter 11. he says i will make thee a great nation i will bless thee i will make thy name great in other words god is going to accomplish an abraham what his ancestors wanted to do on their own what they set out to do on their own what they want to do make this great nation make a name for themselves make a civilization make a city that could thrive and continue forever god is god calls abraham and we have these specifics in genesis 11 for this the specific purpose of creating contrast to how god deals with abraham like when we get to genesis 12 let's not change the picture let's look at the context of how god begins to call abraham and god wanted the story told to the tower of babel to be the contrast to how he begins to deal with abraham he says thou shalt be a blessing in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed notice the comparison to the people in genesis 11. he confuses them they he confounds them and they were supposed to they were wanting to build a great civilization that would benefit people and that would survive forever and make a name for themselves but yet god confounds them and curses them but he tells abraham you're going to be a blessing whereas they wanted to impact the world forever but now he said but you're going to be the one that's going to be a blessing and in thee all families of the earth are going to be blessed think of the contrast now between how god deals with abraham and how the people were thinking in genesis 11. and he tells him get thee out of thy country the first commandment of god to abraham is separation and notice what he's wanting to separate him from or we say i say notice but let me make this point he's wanting to separate him from the culture and the character of where he was he's in this mesopotamia he's in babylonia he's in the southern region of babylon he's in the city of irv the chaldees he's in that very place where this region where the city was built and this tower is being erected he's in a an epicenter of idol worship and hundreds of different deities and gods they said that they speculate that when abraham traveled from ur to haran that he would have traveled along the euphrates river in a common trade route and as he went he would have passed dozens of altars built to false gods dozens of different false gods and so god is wanting to separate him from that atmosphere from that region from that unbelief from that godlessness and he's wanting to take him away from that culture and that character he says unto a land that i will show thee and by doing this it creates this longing in abraham he believes this is god he's fully persuaded that god will fulfill his promise but god holds a little bit back so it creates this longing in abraham's heart where now he's a seeker for this city that god has promised him this land that god has promised and we were making this point this was our very simple point on wednesday night is that what god called abraham out of is very important for us to understand and it's emphasized emphasized multiple times in scripture what god calls abraham out of in genesis 15 verse 7 god himself says and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit now we put a lot of emphasis on the promised land and the land that had been promised to abraham we put a lot of emphasis on the land that god brought abraham to and it's appropriate to put the emphasis on that but notice how god does not just say i called you to this land but he makes note of what he called him out of it says i called you out of ur of the chaldees this was something important to god to remind abraham of remind him what he brought him out of in order to bring the contrast to what he's bringing him into in nehemiah 9 7 then god is characterized this way thou art the lord the god who did us choose abraham and broadest him out of ur of the chaldees and gave him the name of abraham again this is the the now the people are repeating back to god what he has said you brought him out of ur the chaldees abraham is being identified as one who came from this particular region in acts chapter 7 verses 2 to 4 and he said men brethren and fathers hearken to the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia identifying where he was when he was called before he dwelt in quran and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which i will show thee then came he out of the land of the chaldeans and dwelt in haran from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein you now dwell so notice this is just three scriptures and we could have used genesis 11 we could use different places where god is identifying where abraham is brought out of but abraham this very very simple thought of this abraham is called out of babylon it's important for us to recognize that abraham just wasn't picked out of just any random place but abraham is there in babylon and abraham is called out of babylon and in calling abraham out of babylon god has something he wants to do in abraham's life but he's laying a pattern for the seed of abraham he's showing what he will do to the natural seed of abraham but also what he's going to do in a spiritual way to the royal seed of abraham and catch that the natural seed of abraham are always dealt are usually typically most often dealt with after natural things in a natural land in natural physical manifestations whereas to the royal seed of abraham it's a spiritual promise and a spiritual land but abraham is called out of babylon laying the pattern for the elect brother ram says that israel and the church abraham coming from babylon with his father down into the valley of shinar where the souls of many journeyed after the destroying of babylon or the confusion taken place abraham's father parent brought abraham and his loved ones down into shinar in all that land among all these people one man found favor with god now i want you to notice that is the beginning of christianity of the church where did it begin when they left babylon when abraham leaves babylon that is the beginning of christianity that is the beginning of the church i think oh i thought the church began in the book of acts or i thought it began when christ came well we're going back to the pattern and the original and the very seeds that are being sown that will one day be jesus christ and that'll one day be the christian church he's saying he go back to when god called abraham out of babylon and there's the start what does that say to each one of us if we're ever going to start we've got to be called out you have to come out of sin you have to come out of darkness you have to come out of unbelief you have to come out of laodicea you have to come out of out of babylon you have to come out of false beliefs and false ideas that's where it begins and so abraham is called out of babylon now i want to amplify for for some time today the importance and significance of babylon and babylon holds a a very prominent place in scripture and in the plan of god we find that it's uh very large in the story of abraham and extremely big in the story of his seed and in genesis chapter 10 verse 10 speaking of nimrod it says in the beginning of his kingdom was babble as we read in genesis chapter 11 this was a kingdom whose beginning is against god so nimrod had this motive and objective in establishing this kingdom and we see it manifesting when they build the tower of babylon something that is against uh against god now what i'm wanting to labor to do right now and i say this to kind of preface it so you could uh maybe i just open up and uh and be receptive to what i'm what i'm trying to share and maybe not be tense and trying to wonder where i'm going is to see what god called abraham out of so i'm just wanting to give more context to what god was wanting to do by separating abraham from this why does god have to call him out of babylon for these very reasons we're going to express here and then what god does to abraham he does to his seed so you recognize god does the same thing for you for the same reasons and so this beginning of babel or the beginning of babylon is against god's will and you'll find that the ambition of babel is in harmony with satan's ambition just look at satan's objective his plan what he wants to accomplish what he wants to do and you'll find that let us make us and we will do this and we will do that fits perfectly with the ambition of satan and isaiah chapter 14 verses 12 to 14 our thought fallen from heaven oh lucifer's son of the morning how about cut down to the ground which does weaken the nations for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the cloud i will be like the most high it's interesting how that these scriptures taught me how he's brought into the pit and the low places even a dugout well a pit but what he wanted to do is he wanted to ascend into heaven exalt his throne above the stars of god he was looking to build a tower he was wanting something that would reach under the heavens he would want to have an elevated pulpit a platform a throne that would be extended above all everything else that god had created everything else that god expressed as his own i will sit upon the mount of the congregation the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will i will i will i will i will be like the most high and this is the ambition in genesis 11. this is the ambition of the genesis of babylon this is the ambition of the genesis of the tower of babel in the city associated with it is we will we will we will do something great make us a name make us a reputation prevent separation bring a forced unity and gather here and grow here and raise and exalt ourselves above the creation of the earth and the one who created it and so satan is the architect and the inspiration of babylon and and again we're contrasting the call of abraham because in this it's satan's will it's satan's agenda it's an ambition to not fulfill the plan of god it's i will i will i will but when it came to abraham abraham really didn't have a say in it he said i will bless thee i will make of thee it wasn't abraham saying i am i am i will but god was saying he would do it let's look at some of these characteristics of babel and babylon i'm going to read a number of statements from the church age book chapter 5. brother bram says babel is the original name for babylon it means confusion it was literally started by cush the son of him but was brought to a kingdom of power and grandeur under his son nimrod the mighty hunter nimrod according to the genesis 11 account and also according to profane history set out to accomplish that's quite the characterization of history right no wonder we didn't like it in high school right but according to profane history set out to accomplish three things he wanted to build a strong nation which he did he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did he wanted to make a name for himself which he also accomplished his accomplishments were so monumental that the kingdom of babylon was called the head of gold amongst all world governments so this is what this is what we see rising up this is what's represented in the tower of bible this is what's represented in genesis 11. this is what god calls abraham out of notice his strong nation propagate its religion make a name for itself because babylon represents the seat and power of satan's kingdom it represents satan's ambition it represents his power it signifies his the seat it signifies his throne everything that's related it's his tower so babylon is it's his city and his tower i don't believe i provided these on a slide but i'll just read these three other uh pieces from the same passage babylon has always been literally and figuratively satan's headquarters it was in the city of babylon that satanic worship had its origin so think of this its origins its beginnings not only was the end i thought that was very interesting not only was ancestor worship originated in babylon but so also was the worship of nature gotta watch these things ancestor worship the lifting up of ancestors lifting up of a family name lifting up a family ancestor worship originates in babylon the worship of nature originates in babylon and i thought about how sometimes we lift we'll lift up natural remedies more than we will supernatural remedies come on somebody like there's only one essential oil right the holy spirit and so he says that this is where ancestor worship originated in babylon and this is where the worship of nature originated it was in babylon the gods were identified with the sun and the moon the chief object in nature was the sun which has light-giving and heat-giving properties uh oh sounds like some of the things we read about and hear about and appears to manage a ball of fire in the heaven so now they're looking at this and this becomes their object of worship this is what is great this is what is wonderful this is what is what is objectified this is what all manner submits themselves to is nature ancestor worship the worship of nature and then brother bran makes the point and this is verified in history monotheism or the worship of one god turned to polytheism in babylon worship of many gods this begins in babylon and this listen to the statement the devil's lie and the devil's mysteries rose up against the truth of god and the mysteries of god in that city this is where the mystery the mystery of god becomes lost this is where the mystery of god becomes assailed and attacked and it gets swallowed up in the devil's lie and the devil's mysteries in babylon the mystery of god is hid in babylon the mystery of god gets confused with the lies of the devil in babylon the devil's mysteries rise up against the truth of god in babylon the devil's liars are greater than the truth of god and the mysteries of god in babylon is a place where the truth of christ is pushed down and you cannot know it you cannot hear it he says satan truly became the god of this world and exacted worship from those that he had duped causing them to believe that he was truly the lord this is what god called abraham out of so we see that god calls abraham out of the city of ur in the land of the chaldees and we identify with the plain of shinar the bible says is telling us this is in mesopotamia this is in babylonia this is in the very place where this kingdom and this religion and this devil worship and these evil things originated and god said i want to call one man i'm going to begin with abraham and what is he portraying election by grace salvation by faith and it begins by calling them out of babylon so important for us to unders recognize that and see that part then it should be and i know i'm making a kind of a a huge leap here in in coming to this because of skipping a lot in abraham's story and his family story but god gives maybe i won't skip it i'll just do it very very fast god gives abraham a promise i'm going to give you children and i'm going to give you a land and your children enjoy on that land and i'll be your god forever and it's called the promised land and this is where they're going to dwell and this is what we begin to read about from genesis chapter 12 on even till now we're reading about the story of one man in his seat after him but in giving him this promise and we know that he even prophesied that your seed is going to go soldier in a strange land went down into egypt and they go down in egypt just as abraham went down into egypt and then he said i'm going to call them out they're going to bring you back to that land and i'm going to give you a word i'm going to give you promises and as long as you keep my word i'm going to bless you right and so he's telling him that this is the promise i've made and you have to you have to worship me you have to keep me uh at the center of your of your lives but then when israel fell away from those promises who does god use to judge him babylon god uses babylon to judge israel and whenever they disobeyed the word of god their disobedience leads them not only in some instances under babylonian rulership but also leads them back into babylon many scriptures a dozen or so scriptures we could use to share this with you i'll just choose chose two to read in second kings chapter 20 verse 17 behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried into babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord think of how striking this is we be the children of abraham we are that we serve the fa the god of abraham isaac and jacob this is our land this is our throne this is our people this is where we dwell and abraham was called out of babylon but as soon as they start disobeying and they won't hearken the voice of god he says you're all going right back back i mean they're going back to what they called their father of their faith out of in ezekiel 17 12 speaking of nebuchadnezzar say now to the rebellious house this is the the king of babylon who is referring to know ye not what these things mean tell them behold nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon is come to notice this jerusalem he's come to jerusalem and have taken the king thereof and the princes thereof and led them with him to babylon this is the exile in babylon we read about in the book of daniel this is the exile in babylon that we read about in jeremiah this is the lamentations of the children of israel why because they had been taken out of the land that was given to them that was established by their fathers abraham isaac and jacob the promised land and when they fail to honor god what happens the very thing that god separated abraham out of reaches back and takes them into the place that god wanted to keep them from he could have had all of them born there and then caused a mass exodus but no he wanted to cause them to be separated from earth he wanted them to be separated from chaldea he wanted them to be separated from babylon and so he did it by preserving the whole seed by calling him out of babylon and he says if you fail to obey me you're gonna go right back into babylon god allowing certain things and events to take place to portray something to us but notice god uses babylon i know this isn't any uh wonderful mystery to you but i'm wanting just to bring these things in your view so you can put these pieces together on this faith of abraham and how much you can relate to it brother man makes this statement in the the sermon in inside he said then there come another which was king nebuchadnezzar and he was going to build a city and if you'll notice sometimes those spirits that get onto men let me pause here he's going to get into some details about this city that nebuchadnezzar built this is the babylon that exists in second kings 20 ezekiel 17. this is the babylon that judged israel but remember the babylon that abraham was called out of nimrod built these great cities it was there where the two rivers were and it was in mesopotamia a very rich uh fertile area and actually with the name calder the chaldeans the chaldees it speaks of wisdom because it was wise to live there this is a fertile place the fertile crescent this is a place that's very rich and in resources to be able to thrive and to live and so nebuchadnezzar now many many years later he builds a city he's built it in the same region and if you'll notice sometimes those spirits they get onto men so now he's identifying the spirits still have nimrod nebuchadnezzar and it's a day coming and now where the christian church the church of the lord jesus christ ought to be so spiritual because that jesus said that the two spirits would be so close till it would deceive the very elected if it was possible the enemy is so coming cunning so now this is this kind of fast forwards to where i'm wanting to focus on or we want to focus on for ourselves we see it in nimrod nebuchadnezzar but the spirit's still alive today he said now watch him with nebuchadnezzar he built the city just exactly a pattern of heaven as the river euphrates flowed by the throne this is satan's agenda this is his plan like in heaven the river water life goes by the throne swinging guards and everything just exactly like it was for before why when abraham was journeying looking for such a city so when abraham was journeying looking for a city he was looking for the real one not er not babylonia not nimrod cities not these other cities that were built by nimrod in his seat after him but he was promised a city and abraham's vision was on a heavenly city everyone else was focused on natural things natural amenities the sun the moon the worship of the church the worship of false deities the worship of man and wanting to build something great making something great for themselves he says abraham is journeying looking for a city and notice this warning and if you're not spiritually my spiritual minded satan will blind you on these things something that looks almost like it but it isn't it if it's man-made it's no good if it's blood buttoned by god it's the truth these man-made cities man-made religions man-made rescue systems man-made programs man-made ideas man-made doctrines man-made theologies can be made to look very attractive very beautiful have a lot of amenities have a lot of programs have a lot of alert to the flesh and that's the deception of nebuchadnezzar's kingdom that's the deception of babel that's the deception of babylon as it's beautiful and great and alluring and it can cause one to wonder and think wow isn't this beautiful isn't god good but if you don't have discernment if it's not blood bought if it's not in the truth it's deceiving you and that's what god called abraham out of to not fool himself into thinking that oh here i am worshiping these great many wonderful things and this beautifully calls them away from these cities of nimrod to a city that he was going to show him and then when the children of israel backslide they fall right back into the kingdom that's pattern itself after nimrod's which is satan's ambition in the beginning but it makes this statement again in the pergamon church age he says thus the mysteries of babylon spread from nation to nation oh that spirit never dies he began his kingdom in babel satan's kingdom uh the worship of one god turned to the worship of idols and many gods in babylon and now the mysteries of babylon spread from nation to nation until it appears in rome in china india and even in both north and south america we find the very same basic worship why do all these religions have some christ figure why do all of them seem to have some element that we would say is wow this is just this is the story in that culture and christianity is just the story in this culture and this is and the jews have their story and everyone has their story and it's all kind of lumped in is just mythology and each one has a different one but notice satan's agenda to confuse the truth and he begins a kingdom that propagates its own religion and it spreads out throughout the whole world and so he borrows elements of the truth and mingles it with his ideology and his false doctrine in the culture and all these other isms so that the mysteries of babylon are sowed into all of it but what's babylon an impersonation of the genuine satan wanted to build a kingdom like gods but he wanted his to be greater he wanted to overthrow god so satan is a perverter he's an impersonator and so what nimrod does he's tries to fashion this city and build something that would be reflective of the city that god had hid away in the in the heavens and then nebuchadnezzar comes along and he's trying to pattern after us this supernatural city that's the city that abraham's trying to follow and this false religion has spread throughout the world and it has common themes and stories and allegories and different situations and they all have uh what they call a flood myth and they all have a christ superhero and they all have the most religions even have a queen of sheba they all have these different stories and these different elements it's the mysteries of babylon spreading to where this very same basic elements of worship exist in every religion now whereas in genesis chapter 11 and even later in the days of the children of israel being taken into bondage these were physical kingdoms that in physical cities that existed upon earth the mysteries of babylon spread building a spiritual kingdom to satan in revelations chapter 17 verse 2 and 5 speaks of babylon it says with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have made have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication speaking of a city the kings of the earth the inhabitants of the earth verse five and upon her forehead was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and the abominations of the earth they've been birthed from her every sin every evil every false god every false worship has come from babylon revelation 18 verses 3 and verse 5 for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of their delicacies remember when john first saw her what did he do wow she's beautiful first he caught him off guard and he marveled at her and wondered at this great beauty and her scarlet and her purple and all the way that she was erased and her amenities and her gold and everything that she is but then god begins to pull back the curtain for him to see that no she is the she is the cage of every foul bird she houses every evil and wicked spirit though it may be beautiful on the outside and have everything really great and beautiful and everything seems to be lined up just right she is she has caused all the earth kings of the earth to commit fornication all the inhabitants of the earth are drunk with the wine of her fornication all nations have drunk over wrath and her fornication kingdoms kings of the earth committed fornication with her and then it says in verse 5 for her sins notice this remember in the beginning the entire bible wanted to reach unto heaven but this is her legacy for her sins have reached unto heaven they made it there right but it was a tower of iniquity a tower of sin a tower of indignance towards god for her sins have reached unto heaven and notice and god hath remembered her iniquities there is a remembrance of god against babylon and what he remembers is her iniquities and so this is i wanted to share these things with you and i feel great that we're doing great on time we're going to make it to the picnic i i know there's a lot here a lot more that i would love to express and share in this but let me just ask you individually are you are these things making sense and piecing together for you i know it's just really just teaching without kind of the big reveal and the ear scratching but this is i want you just to be able to place these things in the context of abraham's life and then once we can see it in the context of abraham's life don't we see in the context of our life don't we see that what god called him out of in a spiritual and literal sense we have been called out of in a very spiritual sense somebody's very literal sense and so we can see it makes the faith of abraham relatable because our faith begins the same way his did and if it began the same way we go through the same process it'll end the same way and so as we look at babylon satan's kingdom and his power are represented by and embodied in that tower of babel his kingdom his power his authority his ambition is kind of embodied in babylon it's represented in chaldea and so by leading abraham out of babylon as we've mentioned before god foreshadows what he does for his seed he's going to take abraham out of babylon what is he doing he's removing him from the influence of it he's going to take him out of babylon he's removing the power of babylon he's he's not there to respond to the voices of of society he's not there ingrained in their way of worship to always be challenged by a comparison and what looks better and what's greater and and who has something that uh is more attractive and who's more popular and who what is going to benefit you economically and financially if you if you do this or you do that he leads him out of babylon breaking the power of babylon over him but again he's foreshadowing what he's going to do for his seed and he promises that he's not only going to break the power of babylon but he promises like this is going to be a deliverance to you and your seat after you he's going to and he makes promises even though that they would fall into bondage of babylon again he promises that there's going to be a revelation there's going to be deliverance of the seed of his seed in jeremiah chapter 42 verses 11 to 12 be not afraid of the king of babylon of whom you are afraid be not afraid of him saith the lord for i am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand and i will show mercies unto you that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to return to your land think of this this is prophecy that the power of babylon will be broken he called abraham out of it though his seed would go back into it he says don't be afraid of the king of babylon i am with you to save you and deliver you from his hand jeremiah chapter 50 verse 8 remove out of the midst of babylon and go forth out of the land of the chaldeans and be as the he goats before the flocks this is exactly what god did abraham now they're back in bondage again but god is prophesying to those who've been carried away into babylon remove out of the midst of babylon come ye out of the land of the chaldeans they're going to do exactly what abraham had done before abram get out of that country get out of this from my family get out of the city of ur in the land of the county and get out of babylon abraham and then when they find themselves back there he's saying i will call you back out again what a great prophecy what a great promise and then i i have to apologize to brother ellie and brother christian they asked me to preach an african sermon this morning and i said well that means they want me to preach for more than two hours and i said well if i could get some african amends i'll do that and uh i apologize i'm i don't even know if i'm going to make it in an hour brother ellie i need some i need some more pulling um i just realized i'm going a lot better on time than i thought it would i know i went really really fast but i'm going so fast i can start over and slow down because we really don't have the the pavilions rented till one so i feel like i can go to at least 12 45 and we'll make it there on time but i'll just take a deep breath slow down here in acts chapter 13 verse 19 notice what it says here it says in babylon the glory of kingdoms the beauty of the chaldee's excellency shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah i think this to me is such an important uh characterization that god is using he's identifying babylon it's the glory of kingdoms it's the mysteries of babylon that spread from nation to nation and appeared in every major religion in the world today it's the it's in babylon that the devil's lies and the devil's mysteries raise up against the truth of god in the mysteries of god this is in babylon it's the glory of kingdoms it's babylon that becomes the mystery the great the mother of heartless the abominations of the earth it's babylon the beauty of the chaldees remember what abraham is called out of and god makes this prophecy shall be is when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah i'm just wanting to recap this i just want to remind you again genesis chapter 11 a city and a tower now abraham is called out to a land that will be shown thereafter this is the contrast the comparison that we've been trying to make and see these things together now when god speaks of the destruction of babylon he compares it to the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah and in genesis chapter 19 god destroys sodom and when he does he's foreshadowing the destruction of babylon because in isaiah later when he talks about the destruction of babylon he says i'm going to destroy it like i did sodom and gomorrah so though god called abraham out of babylon in abraham's life he's going to give a a foreshadowing and a symbol of what is going to happen to babylon the glory of kingdoms the beauty of the counties i am going to destroy her and when i do it's going to be like when i destroyed sodom and gomorrah and then in genesis chapter 19 we know in chapter 18 god visits him in flesh and the lord comes down and visits him in the tent door abraham's there in the heat of the day it is tent door god comes down and he visits him and let me just see if i have um when he visits him he's going to speak to him specifically about the fact that sarah is going to bring forth a son in a year i'm going to visit according to my life and shara's going to conceive but then there's two other messengers with him right and they keep looking down to sodom and gomorrah their eyes are fixated on sodom and gomorrah and then those two angels go down into sodom and gomorrah but that one the lord stayed back with abraham and his group where the band characterizes it often and he says can i hide from abraham that thing which i'm going to do and he basically says their sins and their iniquities have reached me and i'm going to judge them and he begins to speak how he's going to judge him and abraham says well what if you just find 50 righteous and he starts saying lord maybe maybe if you could just find any righteous in the city you would preserve them and this was the the cry of abraham desiring to see soul save but in particular his family his nephew lot whom he called his brother and so god brings judgment on sodom and gomorrah there's messengers rescue lot out of there but notice what it says now at the time that sodom and gomor are being overthrown what god does to abraham he does to his seed what he's doing there he's showing that what he does to abraham he's going to do to abraham's seed and we're bringing this comparison in contrast genesis 11 genesis chapter 12. now genesis 11 is babylon now god associates the destruction of babylon being foreshadowed in the destruction of sodom and gomorrah and at the time that sodom and gomorrah is being destroyed there's abraham right in the middle of the story in verse 27 and abraham got up early in the morning in that place where he stood before the lord and he looked towards sodom and gomorrah he's in that place where he'd met the lord he's in that place where the word was opened up to him he's standing there as if before the lord and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plane and be held and lo the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of the land of the plain and beheld and loathed and the smoke of as a as went up as the smoke of a furnace and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and it continues to speak about how that he rescued lot out of that but notice how remarkable this is at the time of the destruction of sodom and gomorrah god remembers abraham and at the time of the destruction of babylon it tells us god hath remembered her iniquities but at the same time he's destroying babylon god remembers his elect just as god remembers abraham at the time of the destruction of sodom and gomorrah god remembers you at the time of the destruction of babylon he sets the precedent for god's protection in the end time in the time of the rapture and the time of the laodicean church age because it says in revelations chapter 18 verse 4 speaking about babylon this mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and the abominations of the earth it says and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of your plagues come out of here come out of who come out of babylon come out of mystery babylon come out of laodicea come out of this this this kingdom this this this culture this way of belief come out of all these things come out of her why because i'm going to judge it so you've got to come out of it you've got to be separated and stand before the lord you'll notice in the book of revelation that god uses sodom egypt and babylon all to describe satan's kingdom egypt sodom and babylon and all three of them can relate to abraham because he called him out of babylon though he went to egypt for a time he called them back out of egypt and the seed of abraham also went back into egypt they went into babylon but each time he's called him out of him and right there in the middle of all that he destroys the influence of evil right in the land of by destroying sodom and gomorrah all these things being represented by satan's kingdom now ponder this as we arrive at i would say our closing thought in in looking at it in terms of not that i'm closing i'm just coming to this thought that i'd like to end on when i was when the lord was just inspiring these things to me to just jotted down different scriptures and things kind of the thought that began to emerge to me was the tell of two cities because you have the the story of two different kingdoms and you see their beginnings and you see their destinies and they're all portrayed in genesis chapter 11 in chapter 12. genesis chapter 11 is the beginning of babylon it tells it starts the story of babylon and in it it's it it ends in confusion the entire genesis chapter 10 even begins to tell the story of the start of bible in genesis 11 this tower of babel it's representing babylon and god foreshadows its end confusion chaos but then at the same time he begins to story tell the story of the kingdom that abraham seeks because it says in hebrews chapter 11 verse 10 for he looked for a city which have foundations whose builder and maker is god here's a city that's being built in abraham's backyard and when god begins to call him his eyes turn away from that city and he begins to look for a city that's greater no matter how much that kingdom tried to impersonate and look like the city he was looking for he knew in his heart the one he was looking for was greater and it becomes a tale of two kingdoms a tale of two cities the city that man builds upon the earth and the city that abraham was looking for in his heart and in psalms 48 1-3 great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our god this is the city that abraham looked for in the mountain of his holiness remember this is the place that abra that satan wanted to have beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth what a contrast to mystery babylon it says is mount zion but makes a statement in one place where you see zion it's always the bride so it's associated with you on the sides of the north the city of the great king god is known in her palaces for a refuge notice this city that's being described the city of our god in the mountain of his holiness mount zion the city of the great king the city that's being spoken of here does not describe alone the natural jerusalem though some may associate it with that but natural jerusalem was just a type of the spiritual jerusalem natural jerusalem is a type of the supernatural jerusalem that god is going to brings forth this spiritual way that god is going to bring forth in a very literal way in that eighth day in that eternal city is speaking of the city that abraham was seeking after so it's no surprise after john marvels at this babylon in this city in revelations 17 and 18 and she's described in such detail but the bride has caught come out of her my people it's no surprise that john is then introduced to the real thing in revelations 21 verses 1 to 2 he says i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea ah and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god of the heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband john now sees the city and he sees this city described as a bride adorned for her husband what is it in spiritual type it's the lamb's wife in this literal coming of this city that we will inhabit it is the new jerusalem it is the mount zion it is the city of the great king it is the city of our god it is this great beautiful holy city that comes down out of heaven the heavens that the tower wanted to reach to the heavens that satan wanted to send to now god has made a city the city made by god descending out of heaven and coming down to earth and brother branham details this in into a great length in the future home sermon he says the redeemed shall walk in the light we sing now we'll walk in the light that beautiful light there's something in us calling out is passed from death and to life it's because that's waiting that's what the attribute what we feel truly this is what the attribute what we feel truly this is he says are you ready this is the city that abraham was looking for it says being a prophet he knew that city was somewhere so think of this what john sees coming down out of heaven in revelations 21 1-2 as a bride adorned for her husband which you are reflecting and manifesting right now as the bride of jesus christ that's the city that abraham was looking for because of him being a prophet he knew that city was somewhere so when god begins to call abram out of the city of earth in the land of the counties and he calls him out of babylon he's walking away from the tower of babel he's walking away from this mystery babylon he's walking away from that city that represents satan's ambition and he's walking by vision towards the new jerusalem that city that abraham was looking for and say babylon that city that abraham was looking being a prophet he knew that city was somewhere and he said there's something in us calling out for that it's an attribute that has called out for that city that abraham was looking for and in babylon chapter 11 excuse me genesis chapter 11. i'm writing a new book subscribe get an early copy i'll autograph it for you it has 11 chapters it's named babylon has 11 chapters babylon chapter 11. it speaks of genesis genesis chapter 11 babylon is represented there what is it it's the beginning of satan's earthly kingdom remember how brother brahman said when god called abraham out of babylon the beginning of christianity these twins are born satan's kingdom his perversion of religion his perversion of the worship of god his perversion of christianity is it culminates in climaxes in this mystery babylon and we see it in catholicism we feed all in all the isms of the world today it's the beginning of satan's earthly kingdom and what happens in genesis chapter 11. god comes down and brings confusion is that what the bible says i thought that'd be my easiest amen since i set it up for an hour in genesis chapter 11 god comes down he says i'm coming down into babylon i'm coming down i'm going to visit the city that they build and he visits it and what does he do he brings confusion god does the same thing in the end time he's foreshadowing what he does in the end time in second thessalonians chapter 2 verse 11 talking about the antichrist talking about the deceiving powers and all the lying wonders it says and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie think about that god came down in genesis 11 and caused confusion at the beginning of babylon now as babylon is going to reach its apex and the antichrist is going to be crowned incarnate and it's going to come to its fullest this is everything that satan was wanting from the beginning from genesis chapter 11 and god sends a strong delusion why he did it in genesis 11 he prophesies it in second thessalonians 2 11 that i will send confusion once again and satan's lies and the devil's lies will swallow up the mystery of god the devil's lies and the devil's mysteries will rise up against the truth of god in the mysteries of god in that city in babylon in the end time when this antichrist is coming to his full power i god will send confusion once again he promised it instead of rescuing them instead of speaking plainly to them instead of trying to help everybody in one mass of humanity as they all blindly built this entire bible and where of uh self-ambition self-preservation self-protection all these things that they were doing against god instead of god coming down and speaking plainly to them that they might change their ways he sends a strong delusion and confuses all of them and then by election speaks plainly to one man at the time that god visits them it's the same era that god sends strong illusion and confusion in genesis 11 he visited abraham genesis chapter 12. you you could even look at it in the context of chapter 11 because he says because god had said so that speaking to abraham took place in those events that are described in genesis chapter 11. but i want to close with this there's another visitation related to this city that abraham sought god visits one city to confuse it and keep it from being built god causes delusion in satan's kingdom at the end time and satan's eden the god of this world the god of this evil age all these things that could be used to characterize satan in babylon there's another place that god visits abraham that's reflective of this city that abraham's looking for what was it the new jerusalem genesis chapter 14 this is after a lot had been kidnapped abraham takes 318 of his trained servants and runs out and fights these kings and rescues uh lot and is returning genesis chapter 14 verse 17 to 20 and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of cheda lomaira and of the kings that were with him at the valley of chavez which is the kings dale and amazing this this battle of kings he defeats these kings and is returning the king of sodom meets them and you'll read later i think it's beginning in verse 21 that the king of sodom offers him things wants certain things and offers him certain things he's going to let you keep this and let's negotiate something and what does abraham do he refuses the king of sodom he says because i don't want it to be said that every anything i have came from you and so here it is this is this great beautiful type for those of us living in a modern sodom and gomorrah and then verse 18 and melchizedek king of salem notice this king of salem this is jerusalem now it's king of salem melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god he's king and priest who is this melchizedek who is it that's spoken of he has made a priest forever after the order of melchizedek he has made us kings and priests what was christ he was prophet priest and king all these images and these symbolisms start coming up right here in genesis 14 and one verse there's such an overwhelming introduction of who christ is who god is who you are melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine after the battle after the war with these kings after the rescue of his family he brings him bread and wine he was the priest of the most high god and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and abraham gave him tithes of all if you read when you read the story here comes this king of sodom and these others come come coming up to abraham and then right there in the presence of the king of sodom in the presence of sodomites in the presence of all these people the king of salem visits abraham right in the presence of all of them the king of salem salem is the same as jerusalem the king of salem the new jerusalem and what does he do he serves in communion feasted in the presence of his enemies thou had prepared a table for me in the presence of mine enemies he dined with him in the presence of these wicked kings here's abraham in the promised land but yet there's still a destruction that has to come of sodom it still has to be a completely removal of anything that's blinding anything that's wicked anything that's perverted and right there in the presence of these kings and the presence of these people the lord himself comes down veils himself in flesh and serves communion to abraham to abraham then what does jesus do in the days of his flesh he serves communion sits down with abraham's seed and serves communion to the natural seed so very exactly what he did to abraham then in revelations chapter 3 verse 20. revelations 18 4 i heard another voice saying come out of babylon come out of her my people it's the same voice in revelations 3 20 behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me that's exactly what we have the privilege of doing in this time it's exactly what we're doing right now in the end time is we're having communion with the king in the presence of all the wicked kings in the presence of sodom and the presence of gomorrah in the presence of laodicea and all that is babylon we've been called out spiritually seen this uh raptured up quickly to meet the word of god for our day in here we are feasting with the king in the presence of these the king in a time when babylon is reaching its apex we are dying and fellowshipping though it may be dark out there we have communion with the king right here why because he's called us out of babylon as he did abraham and he's feasting us with us in the shadows of the destruction of sodom and gomorrah just as he did with abraham in fact the musicians to come this is the last a statement i'd like to read it says jesus has gone to prepare with the divine hands a divine city divine architect for a divine bottom people for predestinated people he has gone to prepare abraham was looking for it and he professed that he was a pilgrim and a stranger for he looked for a city whose builder and maker was god that prophet knowing it was somewhere think of this now that what god does to abraham he does to a seed after him and how this tell of two cities god calls abraham right in the shadow of the tower of babel to bring a contrast to set the precedent so we can see his pattern in the process of coming to supreme faith he's walking abraham right through these steps these tell the two cities the city that abraham looked for and the city that man builds that wants to capture people and bind people abraham was looking for it he's a prophet he knows it somewhere john saw it coming down but abraham thought it must be on earth right then i think this is this is awesome why he met melchizedek the king of it [Music] this is what's represented in genesis chapter 14 and give him a tithe which had no father or nor mother he had no beginning of life or no ending of life if you've been saving your amends for you know for the end this is the end all right you can't it's like timeouts you can't carry them into the next half use up all your amens you get new ones in the next service notice how beautiful this is he's saying that the prophet knew this city was somewhere he thought it must be on earth because he met melchizedek the king of it what the king of new jerusalem he says abraham met him and they took communion right on the literal spot where the city will be raised up the holy mountain of the lord where the redeemed will live isn't that beautiful how what god is representing in the life of abraham abraham longed to see it and god knew that he wouldn't be in that literal city that's to come but the king of it came down and met him on the very spot where it would settle generations and generations later that city one day that'll come down that you represent now the king of it came and met abraham and served in communion and that's what's happening today in the midst of this babylon this laodicea this egypt this sodom and gomorrh the king of that new jerusalem has come down and is serving you communion he's doing it for you his elect why because he did it to abraham before you right on the literal spot what a what an amazing communion what am an amazing feast all the supernatural significance of god standing there feeding his servant and abraham knowing this is the king of the city that he's looking for and it creates this longing in his heart to find it isn't that what this word is doing for you today creating in you a longing think of it maybe just to wet your appetite i realize now i could have preached uh three sermons i came up here with notes enough for two and i preached him in very quickly i went way too fast i apologize and that awesome i'm apologizing for being short now god's good miracle-working god this this story that's being portrayed and what god's trying to express to us is so that we can relate to have faith in this end time and so think about this i'll just lay this out there is we want i want to go into this area maybe wednesday next sunday when abraham finally did receive that seed the the natural son isaac which isn't this but it's the sun that was promised sarah's son his name shall be isaac when it came time to find him a wife where does abraham send his servant to go get a wife babylon he goes right back into chaldea what to get a bride out of babylon so that you could relate perfectly with what god's doing in this end time he's called you out of babylon to be married to jesus christ he's called you away from there's no way you can turn where you have the excuse to say in sodom no excuse to stay in egypt no excuse to stay in babylon that's not where it takes place it takes place in the opening of the word it takes place in the presence of jesus christ it takes place in the promised land you've got to come out of it oh could we wake up today to hear his voice to come out of sin to come out of unbelief to come out of politics to come out of popularity to come out of pretest you come out of all the things that relate to babylon into dying with your king today could we stand on our feet blessed be the name of the lord melchizedek came down and served communion in the very spot that the city he longed to look for would come down and now in this end time he's come down into the very city in a spiritual way the bride of jesus christ to serve you i hope you can be encouraged today by these things could we bow our heads in a word of prayer if you have a need in your heart today i encourage you just to lift your hands to him lift it to him now trust him you can trust him i realize that there's things maybe that were ministered today that seemed they may have seemed very dry or just maybe difficult to relate to but i i trust that the lord is dealing with your heart now and you know what he's trying to say to you i believe he's calling us all completely out of babylon if there's the presence of anything wicked or vile then god wants to destroy it as he did sodom and gomorrah let's just yield ourselves to him today our gracious heavenly father lord as we stand in your divine presence we stand as a needy people and i recognize that there's sick bodies there's encumbered minds there's family situations that are broken up there's weaknesses of our flesh that we can't seem to outpace or get away from lord there's broken hearts there's troubled spirits there's grieving families lord and i believe that today regardless of what our particular vantage point is we can look to you and find what we have need of there may be some that need to look to you now as a comforter some that need to look to you as a deliverer some that need to look to you as a healer may that be what they see lord though we look from different vantage points and see something different we're looking at the same thing that's what i want to point who i want to point my finger to today lord at the close of this service is you who is working in the life of abraham telling this dramatic story portraying certain elements so that we can relate and identify with it lord help us to see ourselves in this tale of two cities help us to see ourselves in this story of abraham help us lord the heed revelations 3 20 to heed revelations 18 4 help us lord to know that place to start and abraham began lord by believing you and he was justified in that he just accepted he accepted your word and he began to leave and lord we may be aware of a lot of teachings we may be aware of a lot of uh platitudes or certain junctures of christian faith things that we think that we must accomplish and things that we must do lord may we just focus on the task that is at hand to believe you to take you at your word whatever it is in this moment that you've asked us to do may we not try to get too far in the process but just follow you to that land that you'll show us hereafter commit the people to you now lord praying that you'll bless us with your presence as we worship bless the remainder of our day lord as we fellowship together be with our visitors that have come may there be a an encouragement for them in their hearts be with brother brandon lord as he's fighting coveted lord i pray that you would intervene quickly on his behalf lord for brother carl and sister karma the lord's parents may you step in for them and touch them relieve them father brother stephen buckles the different ones that we're aware of that are afflicted by this the sickness lord may you come to their aid in their defense and rescue them commit ourselves to you now father and we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
