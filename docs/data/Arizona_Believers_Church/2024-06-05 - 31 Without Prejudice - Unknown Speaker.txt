TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I I hope to be able to explore that uh in some detail today without having to go back and read this uh parable of the Good Samaritan and perhaps what my desire would be that you would be able to make some connections yourself with the story especially since it's so familiar to us I want to give a summary I'm picking up on some things that we didn't get to on Sunday so I want to give a summary of these last few Services we've been ministering on a humble home and a home of honor and we've been uh using that phrasing and some specifics to highlight these uh certain characteristics that make a house a home very core core values or things that make up the kind of character uh that pleases the Lord and where his honors pleased to dwell and we use the parable of the unjust Steward who acted selfishly acted for his own benefit he was shrewd for only his own interest and it impressed his master he he was like that was a pretty slick move you looked out after yourself that was pretty shrewd you got one over on me but still it was self-serving and self-protective was only acting in his own interest and it's that Parable that provoked the Pharisees to kind of resent Jesus because he said you know you can't serve God and Mammon and he's saying you can't you can't serve riches and pursue riches and pursue Christ at the same time or Su pursue God at the same time and so the the Pharisees because they were cous and they wanted and they lusted for money and for wealth and popularity and all the things that go with it uh they resented him and even began to chide him and ridicule him so then Jesus gives the parable of the rich man in Lazarus and here's this rich man who has everything that the world could offer and a beggar lays at his gate and uh the rich man disregards him never ministers to him in his need and they both die Lazareth goes to the bosom of Abraham the rich man goes to hell and is tormented and he's showing the heart of the Pharisees this he's rebuking the Pharisee and he's saying the rich man in Hell lifts up his eyes and sees Lazarus and instead of repenting from missing the mark he says could Lazarus come and show mercy on me in the Gates of Hell uh in my torment unlike what I did to him he it's not no self-awareness whatsoever to say uh man I really missed the mark but he asked for Lazarus to come and comfort him in his torment and again this is one Jesus is using this Parable to address that self-serving self-protecting selfish attitude where one is only concerned about themselves and they even act religiously and act towards God and others to preserve their own testimony or make themselves look good so it really hits a lot at just this theater of the Optics of being a Christian and we've contrasted this selfish nature with the idea of being selfless living for others that's eternal life that's what Christ did he laid down his life we likewise are to take up the cross of self-denial and give and give abundantly as God gives to us we give out of what we've been given and that we're to be concerned more with the needs of others than our own selves and not be worried about about advancing our own interests But realize that as a Christian if I work to help others and make somebody else's life a little bit better and spread joy and and assist and give Aid that that's I'm doing this unto the Lord and he'll watch out over me and I'm not going to be double-minded in this I'm going to trust God that if I'm serving him and doing him right according to his word that he will take care of me and so we used humility as kind of a an important component to this where you don't have this inflated view of yourself and you don't think more of yourself than you ought to and you kind of have a modest view of your own importance and you're willing to do something because it's like that's not really beneath me I there's no Pride here I don't mind doing that and so you're you're not the narcissist where you're always looking down on people and critical so you don't have this sense of entitlement you don't have this attitude of of well it's my right and I me first but there's this deferring and I had a brother reach out to me and says man your sermon has been the talk of our family since Sunday it's constantly being mentioned and I'm kind of thinking this is great keep texting let it flow and it's like yeah it's like constantly you should prefer your brother you should prefer your sister and so I just kind of wrote back and said well perhaps not in this in a positive light that I would have wanted but nonetheless it's getting some air time but we should have an attitude of preferring one another and it's even the willingness to shed your own rights for the rights of somebody else uh if if if necessary it's just this respect that every person is due and and I've been thinking a lot about uh the the idea of do unto others as you would have them do unto you and the principle of of the the way don't be a hypocrite if if you would want if I would want you to treat me a certain way I should probably uh be the same way uh towards somebody else and so there's this idea of just giving someone their due and what's what's considerate and in Romans 12:10 it says be kindly affectioned one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another this kindly affectioned toward one another with brotherly love it's genuine it's authentic it's not for show it's not just putting on this pretense and just saying well we've been told to love everybody and but if I could really give him a piece of my mind I would it's actually getting to a place to where it's not hypocrisy to do good it's not for pretense to labor in the right things and it's just real genuine it's genuine from your heart even if there is an offense or even if there is something very difficult to wrestle with you've gotten to a place in your walk with God where it's like I can I'm looking past that and I see a bigger picture I see a greater need and I can be kindly affectioned one to another and then in honor preferring one another it's allowing putting other needs before our own and giving preference to somebody else for their sake knowing that God looks out after you and you're sure in his promise towards you so you don't have to try to cut corners and cheat and preserve for yourself you could even look at it from the standpoint of I don't know where they are with God I don't know where their faith is with God I I don't know if they can have the same peace I would have in this situation so let me help them in their weakness and in what they're going through cuz I know God will take care of me and maybe if if I could do something for them it'll encourage their faith a little bit more so that when they're in that position the next time their hands not out but their hands are together praying or they're up rejoicing and thanking God knowing that the blessing's coming because what's get what has put us in that position to Aid and to serve and to be empathetic towards others when they're suffering is we've been there before God met us in our needs and sometimes we find ourselves talking to people and they're really really going through it and we're like you just should believe the promises of God and God's going to come to your Aid and God's going to do this and this is going to happen and you speak so freely and boldly about what God can do and you're thinking where was all this 5 years ago when I was going through it but it's it's that's because you've lived it and they need to hear it and we're there for one another preferring one another brother bam said we must live for others Christian Life is a life that lives for others now I had a lot more to go to I just I kind of skipped a lot because there had been that statement in the church age book where God says the people of God are not Material material minded but they're christm minded and it was approaching it from that standpoint that um the majority of Christians are not wealthy they're but they're rather they're on the Poor Side and so a rich man is rich in God not in worldly things and we were using that to uh emphasize not trusting in wealth privilege or opportunity uh not thinking that we're better than other people and disregarding the needs of others and just this General attitude of no hypocrisy but honesty and and certain things within the home and within our own individual lives to where we can be Bears of the presence of God and so we've dealt a lot with our attitude towards possessions and wealth and money and riches and so I I mentioned that uh in light of The Parables we've been using to remember those elements as we go forward now tonight my title is without prejudice and this is a legal phrase that's how I'm typically uh familiar with it is this phrase without prejudice and I'm wanting to put a greater microscope on that Pharisee spirit that Jesus is rebuking and hopefully by addressing this part of the Pharisee Spirit that's been called out and and this these other Parables it it we can identify how this attitude this this idea of prejudice hurts us in our home life and our relationships with other people now if we could just keep this slide here until we maybe get to our next uh uh statement uh Prejudice is maybe to use maybe a fancy word is for judg judement or judging beforehand it's a preconceived opinion if you have a Prejudice you have a you're leaning towards one side of something for a reason other than your conviction of of what's right or Justice or or seeing the totality of evidence and saying uh this is a just conviction you if you have Prejudice even before you hear all the facts even before you really know the situation you have some reason to already take a side and that's what makes you Prejudice we you with me so far and so it a bias if you've heard that word before it's that one-sided tendency of the mind you have a bias towards something and a bias is like an undo Prejudice you just you lean that way you're you align yourself in a particular way it's called a bias and when you have this bias it kind of assumes that it's this undue Prejudice often without evidence like why are you partial to that that's just your inclination that's your you have this prejudgment you haven't heard all the facts you've decided it before beforehand and the word prejudice it's rooted in this idea of spite or contempt the meaning of the word prejudice and the prefixes and uh the the the wording in even different languages there's some harm or damage some hurt with prejudice if if the opinion was without effect maybe it's not Prejudice it's just a difference of opinion but this for judgment or bias this uh undue Prejudice indicates some Harmon damage in the violation of someone's right that you if you have a Prejudice toward something it's not an innocent well I prefer this place over this place but it's a it's it's a not just a preference but the Prejudice means in coming to that decision and viewing it that way it's some harm to that individual or it deprives them of some right or respect that they otherwise should have just as a human being and it has its roots as I said in this idea of cont tempt now when we were preaching on A House Divided cannot stand and we were looking at those different aspects we talked about just very briefly how contempt is one of the single greatest indicators of a relationship headed to a breakup that in a marriage one of the single greatest indicators of a divorce is when two people have contempt one for another and when you have contempt for somebody you look down on them so the Prejudice isn't like a compliment like I just think you're just don't know why I don't have any evidence but I just think you're better than me it would just be the idea of deciding beforehand without evidence that somebody else is beneath you or worthless deserves ridicule or doesn't deserve something that they otherwise would have some right to or are you deprived them of some justice or some Equity or fairness because you are prejudicial towards them maybe discrimination could be a word that we could have looked at a little bit but the word that kept coming to me is bigotry and uh it has a very interesting etymology and that's not the study of insects but it it has some real interesting history but it's an obstinate or unreasonable attachment to a Creed or opinion and thereby being intolerant of others so if there's a bigotry it's unreasonable it's a real stubborn attachment to some idea some judgment some opinion and intolerance of others and there's I just felt like it was so aligned with bias and this idea of prejudice to where you have some preconceived idea some you formed an opinion beforehand you're closed-minded you're stubborn and it'll it causes you to be very intolerant or reject full of others uh their opinions or their situation judgmental their situation and you would withhold something that's due to them I'm not really zeroing in on your faces and maybe I'm afraid to but just trust that everybody's with me so far and and you're not getting nervous that you're going to get a a sermon on being woke but I do think there's a lot here for us to consider now if we talk about bigotry we should refer we should uh make known the bigot and it's a sanctimonious person and the the history of the word bigot we might think a bigot is somebody who's uh racist against somebody or a bigot uh maybe we associate with a misogynist but a bigot in its wording it's a sanctimonious person who is a Rel religious hypocrite a bigot is a religious hypocrite it's one who is sanctimonious and I know we need the definition for sanctimonious it's making a show of sanctity one who makes a show of being Sanctified one who makes a show of being holy one who makes a show of being right where they're affecting affecting the appearance of Holiness so a bigot is somebody who tries to appear holy but is actually inwardly evil inwardly unclean so in the modern language Jesus was have said scribes Pharisees bigots because that's what they were they gave the appearance of Holiness but they were religious Hypocrites so now without prejudice when I say without prejudice it's withholding judgment or opinion it's acting without injury loss or damnation and when it comes to the legal phrase has anybody ever been in some situation where a cause of action was dismissed without prejudice anybody anybody I'm looking for new clients because if something is dealt with in litigation and it's done without prejudice that means that I've de I've dismissed this or there's a ruling and without prejudice means it does not infringe on my right to subsequently bring that cause of action again or Sue again so I could sue Brother Scott for no reason whatsoever and and then after the law lawsuits already started I could ask for a motion to dismiss and ask for it to be dismissed without prejudice meaning if I want to sue him again I have a right to sue so no uh no rights are being taken away from me I still have Justice made available to me but if something is dismissed with prejudice it deprives you of ever bringing that cause of action again I if something's dismissed with prejudice it's essentially like a final decision on that claim and your right to sue or get something out of it has been taken away and I've probably made a mess of this by bringing the law into it but what so what I mean by without prejudice is you are preserving somebody's right that you are being respectful of themselves and their journey and their experiences and what they're going through and so you withhold judgment you withhold damnation you withhold HHH harm you you don't act in a way that injures them or causes them lost so you're preserving a person's rights you're respectful of their rights and I'm not just talking about their rights as an American I'm not just talking about their rights a as a human being I'm talking about their rights as a child of God their opportunity that they should have as a Christian to Mercy and Grace and an opportunity to know the love of God so without prejudice we're dealing with prejudice uh discrimination bias bigotry and these certain attitudes that hinder Us in cultivating the right kind of atmospheres in our relationship a ships in in our home how many of here here have ever heard of Francis Bacon I'm not talking about fried bacon or anything like that but if you want to get a crowd's attention just start talking about bacon I had just thought about that you know fry onions and cook bacon and the house smells great maybe we should just kind of do that here fry onions in the pre-service but Francis Bacon in his uh work novin organum and that's a a shortening of the full title but there's too much Latin for me but in 1620 he wrote this and it's so profound as to what I'm trying to share I hope you can catch this because we're talking about Prejudice and bias and he says for what a man had rather were true he more readily believes you listening we going to get a lot out of this what you want to be true you're more quickly to accept as true what what you want to see you're you're it's easier for you to see it and this is very critical for us when sometimes we form opinions or judgments even with respect to the message what you want to believe is true it's easier for us to readily believe that which we would rather be true therefore he rejects difficult things from impatience of research through that hardship if it's if it's difficult to understand you just reject it because you don't want to you don't want to put in the hard work now I'm not so much looking at this from a spiritual standpoint but just a a human nature in general you reject sober things because they narrow hope I just thought that was profound you'll you'll reject things that are uh uh that limit your opportunities or kind of narrow down the options because you don't like that because it reduces your expectations or belief that there could be more they reject the deeper things of nature from Superstition the light of experience from arrogance and pride lest his mind should seem to be occupied with things mean and transitory things not commonly believed you reject out of deference to the opinion of the vulgar he says numberless in short are the ways and sometimes imperceptible in which the affections color and infect the understanding it's all about the Prejudice the bias the preconceived notions and opinions and Francis Bacon was uh he was a devout Anglican and um a Christian and as I was reading some of his other works this week he made this statement I just want to share this and it kind of was a late addition to my note but he said the causes and I'm reading this just so you could be hear the color in his words is one who's not he's not seeking abandonment to reason and science but he was a huge proponent of Science and even the the cover of this book it uses a scripture in Daniel that they shall set out and travel and gain knowledge and and that that there was that all any research and search for knowledge should only confirm the truth of the scripture and should always align up with the Divine so it wasn't it wasn't science as we know it today but he says the causes of atheism are divisions in religion if they be many for any one main division addeth Zeal to both sides so if religion is just separated into two it just we take our sides right we get very very zealous but many divisions introduces atheism so profound that the cause of causes of atheism divisions in religion that if you can divide it enough people resort to just rejecting God totally another cause of atheism is the scandal of priest when it came to that which St Bernard says one cannot now say the priest is of the people for the truth is that the people are not as bad as the priest and this is true now even more so of Christianity that it's popular say it's a popular saying among atheists that the Christians are the most UN Christlike people on Earth and third is the custom of profane scoffing in holy matters which does by little and little deface the reverence of religion so just scoffing at religion the scoffing at Holy things just it Waters down religion and the last thing that causes atheism is learned times especially with peace and prosperity he said for troubles and adversities do more bow men's Minds to religion so he he had some insight he had some conviction of the truth of God and the absoluteness of scripture and he was very concerned about the word of God being Mis misrepresented through the priest to who uh defile the people and and live profanely and it caused people to say the priesthood is not as the people because the people are better than the priesthood and it would lead one to reject truth and how that the divisions in religion that as the more you divide up the truth the more he introduces atheism just to whol Cale reject Christ and so coming back to the idea of Prejudice he says that a man had rather accept something as true what he already believes and if he has some sort of prejudice already that's what he's going to defer to that's what he's going to lean into now this is going to be a really hard turn but turn to James chapter 2: 1-9 that's my foundation on Prejudice opinions and uh introducing the concept of a bias and even this undo Prejudice where there's this contempt for other people classes of people even another person James chapter 2: 1-9 my brethren have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of God with respect of persons this came to mind when I was studying on the story of the rich man in Lazarus or Devas as he his attitude towards the poor man he would have looked down upon him and because of his wealth and privilege and opportunity he never thought to help Lazarus but when he had need he looked at Lazareth perhaps as a servant you know an Aaron boy bring me some water take care of me in my need and so it was this respect of persons where one person is preferred over another and that's this scripture has been in my notes the last couple services that we hadn't had a chance to get to so do not have uh Faith with respect to persons for if there come unto your assembly a man with the gold ring in goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in Vile reignment I don't if anything anyone has ever worn here has been called vile reignment or maybe goodly apparel at that but you know he saying if anyone comes amongst your fellowship and one dresses nice and the other one is is looking more poor maybe they're not dressed in a pleasing way to the eye he says and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing I don't know if we used that compliment either and saith unto him who's wearing the goodly apparel and the gold ring and the one who appears to be wealthy and has position and Prestige we say to him sit thou here in a good place make sure this guy sits right here next to brother Rowan so he can be on camera we want people to know that this ruler and this person is visiting and so we appreciate you chase sitting next to Rowan so everyone knows we get the celebrities here but there's a I only said that because Rowan starts reaching over there poking Chase like H sit thou at my right hand there's a you you know exactly what's happening and I've seen this happen in churches it's really overseas where in some places the governor or the mayor will attend the services or come and this is in Africa and and when this happens you know maybe for a lot more reasons than the fact that he's wearing gay clothing you're like come sit at the front and you make a show of it and you acknowledge the dignitaries and how many ministers do we have here today I'd never heard anyone say how many lay people are here tonight right preachers and pastors and missionaries and you acknowledge uh the important people and so he's kind of touching on human nature that still exists today that one person gets special treatment but the other person you say stand thou there or sit here under my foot stol go over here to the Wayside or you be my servant and you create this cast system within the house of God where somebody is deserving of attention and special treatment and the other one is essentially disregarded and trust me the one in the vial arment will feel vile and the one in the gay uh clothing is going to feel good but then James has this Stark rebuke are you not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts in other words you have unrighteous thoughts you have Prejudice you have bias in your mind simply because this man dresses good and this man dresses bad and you've made the decision this one needs to be at the foot stol this one needs to be over here this one needs to be preferred this one needs to have the best seat he says you have become judges with perverted judgment you've judged beforehand you've said this man deserves special treatment this man deserves unspecial treatment all because you've become partial in yourselves so he says hearken my beloved Brethren hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and Heirs of the Kingdom which Heath promised to them that love him as brother brandham said most of God's children are usually the majority of Christians are not wealthy but rather they are on the Poor Side he says but ye have despised the poor you've judged them incorrectly you've been a bigot towards them because you put on the pretense of religion and religion pure and undefiled is to vidle the Widow in her Affliction a a and to show this hospitality and kindness to those who are less fortunate and here you have this attitude of well this is really just all for show because when it comes down to it I'm given an opport to show Mercy to someone who really needs it I say you sit here at my foot stol and you're kind and nice to the one who gives you more Advantage you've despised the poor he says do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the Judgment seats he's say what what do these men of the world do to you what would they do if given the opportunity and the way sometimes we prefer celebrity and the way sometimes we show respect to worldly things or even well-known Ministries or different talk show host or podcast host a a and athletes or whatever it might be or politicians man we're just in awe of them and they would not hesitate to throw you under the bus if it did them good and they oppress the poor they oppress you they're not uh they're not acting to preserve your rights they're doing it for themselves he says do not they blaspheme that worthy Name by which you are called really wanting us to be mindful of man how is it sometimes we get drawn off sides to show favoritism that is essentially despising the less fortunate judging incorrectly you become judges of evil thoughts do not they blaspheme he says if you fulfill the Royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well it's called The Royal law fulfilling the law of Christ Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself it sums up all the law and the prophets it can hang on this if we suppose the love for God in all respects heart soul and mind and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself he says then you're doing well when you fulfill the Royal law but if you have respect to persons ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors if we have Prejudice in our hearts if we have bias if we are scribes Pharisees big then we sin and we are convicted under the law as a transgressor brother brandham takes he's kind of referring to this he says now this is nothing against rich people because God can save a rich man and all the rich people said amen some of God's children are rich but money can be such a snare not only to those who have it but to those who don't have it catch that how it be comes a snare to those who have it and especially sometimes to those who don't have it because they want it way back there in the first age James cried out to those who were putting stock in wealthy people have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons the poor there were trying to butter up the rich in order to get help rather than trusting in God I thought wow what a statement trying to advance themselves and even as the unjust Steward did in a sense whom you have one master that is God you have one that you ought to serve you cannot serve God in man but yet there was this effort to be shrewd and wise in the world to get an advantage in the world that you might be taken care of after worldly things and trying to get respect of the world instead of trusting in God don't do it says James don't do it money isn't everything money isn't the answer today it's not the answer either we have more wealth than we have ever had and yet less is being accomplished spiritually it is not with money that God works and this part to me is so critical to our thought in this series he moves by his spirit and that moving of the spirit comes only to a life consecrated to the word a man that is rich is rich in God not in worldly things a rich has come because his spirit moves in our lives and it moves because we have a life consecrated devoted partial to the word word so in fulfilling the Royal law Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself we do well but he says if you have respect of persons you sin this respect of persons is to prefer an ideal a scenario a person wealth or opportunity a and cater to that and give Credence to that and desire that at somebody else's expense that if we were to judge those who are spiritual in our church we might we what he's saying is that we would be quick to receive somebody who comes in amongst us that looks the part of a Christian that has things put together and I do believe that we would say wow this is a late model car and this is wearing new clothes and and he's got the nice shoes on and everything looks really nice and put well together that we would be more trusting and we'd be more open and be more accepting and maybe that's not wrong but our bias shows up that when someone comes who's not quite put together we're a little bit more uneasy a little bit more standoffish a little bit more suspicious we're less welcoming and warm and that exposes the bias because we've let some Optics or pretense uh we've been kind of Hoodwinked by that sanctimonious person and we're becoming sanctimonious ourselves we're kind of drawn into trying to play the part because maybe we think it could do us some good or we could maybe make some uh wow if this person starts coming maybe we could build a new church or whatever the thoughts might be it's for all the wrong reasons and you don't show kindness to the one who probably needs it the most there's so much in here that I'm just hoping you're picking up what I'm laying down without me belaboring some of these things and TI it all together if I could say this in the parable of the Good Samaritan the the priest and the levite show did not show compassion on a person in need and they passed by him and there was some because of the nature as Jesus is setting it up He is wanting to address this Prejudice that one would have towards a Samaritan and how they would narrowly construct their definition of neighbor to say that my neighbor would have to be only an Israelite who has not profaned the word my neighbor would have to be somebody in gay clothing my neighbor would have to be the priest himself or levac my neighbor would have to be one of the tribes of Benjamin or somebody else who's the Israelite who's in the faith my neighbor cannot be a Samaritan my neighbor cannot be a gentile I I I can't have some obligation outside of the household of this cult or this this group that were within uh so that I can justify myself when I uh look down on somebody and sneer at them in their need and say that guy probably asked for it and it is as we are addressing this Pharisees Spirit brother Bram well Jesus says woe we've taken a lot from Matthew 23 woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites and job it says the Hypocrites in heart Heap up wrath they cry not when he bindeth them it's exactly what Devas did in hell he was cast into hell and being tormented and he doesn't cry for Mercy he doesn't ask for forgiveness he wants to be relieved of his torment he has no self-awareness to say I did this I made a I caused this and asked for forgiveness so the the Hypocrites are so blind to their state they're so they lack so much self-awareness of what their needs are and how much they lack they're they're so rich in so many things that they've taken comfort in the objects in the theater of playing the part that they're not in humility asking God for help they're not recognizing their poverty to come to the Lord to buy isab so that they can see in white rant that they might be clothed but he says the Hypocrites in heart Heap up wrath so if you're a hypocrite what strikes me what's amazing the Hypocrites in heart Heap up wrath the heart of a Pharisee is Prejudice the at the heart of a Pharisee is bigotry because they look down on and judge anything unlike them and this idea of they Heap the heart heaps up wrath it's this idea of where there's just this uh contempt brother Bram in the sermon identification and there's so many statements that can take this he says the Pharisees of that day took a stand against him because of prejudice that's the same thing they do today he says Nicodemus said the same thing he said Rabbi we know that you are teacher come from God but because of their Creeds and denominations wouldn't accept his message then they forbid anyone anybody else he said you won't go in yourself and you forbid others to go in what a condition I wonder if we could identify ourselves with something like that and he ask in this series of sermons around that time upon this particular subject and he he calls out the Prejudice in the heart of the Pharisees and their prejudgments and their bias and their bigotry and how in that they couldn't accept Jesus Christ even when Nicodemus who's among them would say you have the truth but we're not willing to accept it that they would rather things be true that they were more inclined to believe whatever they they they desire to be true they it's easier to believe this man looks like he could be from God and and maybe he is a rabbi maybe he's a master but what they wanted to believe is that he wasn't so it was easier to believe that he wasn't and brother brandham calls it out as Prejudice he said in the sermon indictment they knew that was the truth but because of jealousy Prejudice they had they thought more of themselves than they did of Jesus Christ now I wonder if Jesus was one of them what would have they thought if he dressed like them talked like him acted like him he is who he is but Mary and Joseph want something better for their son and and they found a good school to put him in so he goes to school with all the other rabins and he's he's learning with them and he sits under the same teachers and he comes up through the system and then once he gets to that place I wonder how easy it would have been for them just to accept him as this makes a lot of sense and the things that he would say and the things that he would do like man this guy he's one of us and his miracles uh make us more powerful and his Prestige makes us more uh more popular and I imagine he could have been the exact same teaching the exact same thing and doing the exact exact same things and been more accepted if he would have looked like them talked like them had the same background but the rumors the stains the the questions he looked poor he looked he looked looked weak he hung out with the wrong kind of people and it was because of prejudice so in Galatians chapter 6:3 it says for if a man think himself to be something when he's nothing he deceives himself it could be said of the priest and the levite as they came across this man who was beaten and left half dead that they would have looked down on him and in their own self-conceit they would have thought oh well I I I'm busy I I've got to go to this appointment and I have thing better things to do with my time or I I can't I can't risk uh coming up against a dead person or I I they're more worried about these other things a man who thinks to himself their own because of what they thought of themselves it hindered their sympathy for somebody else going through something and I say sympathy because they probably had uh they had right to be empathetic but because they had so separated themselves from other people they wouldn't claim to understand what another person was going through who wasn't like them they would be as dogs they would not be worthy of the same things and they would not be worthy of accord or or to be loved as themselves so they would have looked at them and it would have even hindered their sympathy and because they could not sympathize they weren't willing to stop and help but a man who thinks himself to be something when he's nothing has deceived himself this is the attitude of the Pharisees the stage player The Pretender who is so invested in the role that they never leave it that they're uh this they've taken on this Persona and it becomes who they are brother bman the sermon investment says Nicodemus one day admitted the truth you know he came by night to make an investment he found the bake was a bank was open he come uh it's always open he thought well the bank is doing business all through the day for this investment but I believe I'll go by the night and he found it open ready he said Rabbi we know that thou are a man sent from God no man can do these things like you're doing except God be with him it's totally impossible see he admitted there to the whole denominational world that they knew it was so are you listening but for prejudice for prejudice and pride and social popularity of the day just like that rich kid did just like the Rich Young Ruler why did he reject Christ Prejudice he might have thought man I run with some of the wealthiest people I have the best social scene and it'd be one thing if you wanted me to sell everything I have and just store it up and kind of go on this journey so I could just be this kind of Bohemian and I could just tell my friends hey man I'm just following the teacher for a while I'll be back look after my goods but it's like I don't want to be identified with you I don't want to take up my cross and he's maybe looking at the folk he'd hang out with and he's like I don't know this isn't how I want to live this isn't how I want to be perceived but for prejudice Pride social popularity just like the Rich Young Ruler he said just like the rich kid did for Prestige and social understandings they didn't want to give up the world why didn't the Rich Young Ruler want to give up the world Prejudice he had already made up his mind perhaps he'd already had some sort of bias maybe himself and at the risk of offending some that he had kept the law from his youth but he was a religious hypocrite he was a bigot because it was all for show it wasn't sincere and genuine that given an opportunity to do something Beyond himself do something to show that he was willing to put some skin in the game that it wasn't all for himself that he wasn't a narcissist he wasn't selfish he wasn't self-serving and self- protecting that he could take some risk and trust God not his wealth it's like ah I don't want to take that chance Prejudice and pride is at the heart of the Rich Young Ruler it was at the heart of Devas it was the reason why day after day he could pass by Lazarus and never offer help because he did literally and figuratively look down on him brother Michael shared a quote with a group of uh young guys he shared this statement it's so powerful imagine you might have used it in your family devotion he said other leaders that he had in his youthful days talking about the Rich Young Ruler had such an influence on him till he refused to accept God's provided way which was Jesus Christ the other leaders that he had in his youth they had so swn into him ideas and opinions and leanings and biases a and the and these prejudices where he had become sanctimonious he was making a show of being righteous and because of prejudice and pride and soal popularity social understanding Prestige his other leaders had so such an influence on him he was already predisposed he was already had a bias he was already leaning he had a tendency in mind he had to undo Prejudice towards the things of God very subtle even as Francis Bacon would say maybe imperceptible the things that affected in his understanding and kept him from receiving the truth for if a man thinketh himself to be something I actually um inadvertently maybe cut out some of my notes but I think we'll be okay if a man thinks himself to be something he says this after verse one Galatians chapter 6 vers1 Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted to me it's remarkable only the spiritual can really help somebody who's wounded or hurt or made a mistake or overtaken in a fault he speaks to the spiritual why to the spiritual because they're the ones that would have the power the capacity and the wisdom to be genuine to be authentic and w to help somebody else and not go help the guy on the ground who's struggling who just fell down so you could pickpocket him right you notice they dropped something and you're like oh let me help you and you put your foot over the $100 bill that they dropped right and you're helping them pick everything up and you're never moving your other foot right because you you you're selfish so he's saying you which are spiritual and he says do it in a spirit of meekness why because meekness is not weakness meekness is power under control you recognize that one caught in a fault is vulnerable you realize that you could take advantage of them that you could maybe manipulate the situation oh man he made a mistake this is my chance this is my opportunity I can I can strike now I've caught him in something and he's made a mistake and he's done something wrong and you look for an opportunity to gain some power even maybe take some opportunity and you use it to your advantage I've seen this happen even in Ministry where when one looks to have made a mistake or there's some question or there's something going on that they that are who Who present themselves a spiritual seed as an opportunity to advance themselves instead of saying hey how could we help in a spirit of meekness and then this is to me the part that just really sums it up all he has to say is consider yourself lest thou also be tempted there there ought to be a meekness which is kind of combined with some humility that the spirit spiritual have the capacity to check themselves and when they see somebody overtaken a fault we might be inclined to Pearl clutch or just be oh my goodness I can't believe they do that they call themselves a message believer but there ought to be some mechanism inside that stops and says wait a minute man that that could have been me or I wonder what they're going through you know it's next time somebody does something that seems a little bit unhinged instead of saying oh my goodness this is the real them I never thought this just goes to show stop for a moment and just assume that you knew the real them and that this is out of character and ask yourself what must they be going through to act this much out of character change your attitude like man they must be going through it this isn't like them and not all of a sudden just be like well they finally showed their colors brother there's just an arrogant jerk just ask yourself what must I be going through see just so nice and agreeable there's not an arguing bone in him but you consider yourself if you're ever going to be able to help someone you can't be prejudicial you can't have this bias you can't be a bigot our judgment has to be right or if anything we have to reserve judgment he says considering your own self in other words you have some sort of self-awareness your own Humanity that by the grace of God I am what I am and I'm not what I used to be and I won't remain What I Am by God's grace I'll continue to grow and so there's some awareness of your own weakness there's even some even though we ask God to keep us from remembering and we don't not want to remember our past sins but sometimes we just need to remember I don't remember everything I did but I did some stuff haven't always been this perfect or this close to perfect I've had some of my own past failures so in humility and in this uh you know a low opinion of yourself it has to be that way if we want to put it that way or just a a modest view of your own importance you can see your own biases you can overcome Prejudice and that knee-jerk reaction sometimes to be a bigot and say no I'm not going to go there I'm going look at this situation a little bit better so he says a man who thinks himself to be something when he's not those are the ones that look at somebody in a fault and judge them and look down on them and they've lost the capacity to help them and I'm using this in the context of our home life and just how easy it is whether it be the Young's attitude towards towards the old I think it's easy sometimes for young people to begin to have contempt for their parents because maybe there's a time when they thought they knew everything they were the best Christians in the world and as they get a little bit older and they get a little bit wiser and they become you know 16 14 13 just throwing things out there they begin to realize whoa I don't know if that's exactly the right way to respond dad right and they're a little bit more wise to things and they're a little bit more sensitive to inappropriate responses and and they're wanting to understand the why behind some things and so it might be easy for them to say like man they're they were always so strict and they were so hard on us and Jack just gets to do whatever he wants I know you're all wondering why I choose Wednesday nights just to deal with our family issues I'm not doing it I'm just dramatizing for the sake of all the other families that have to deal with that but there's it's easy to begin to have contempt even as the child in a in a relationship that there begins to there's this resentment this contempt in Youth and even in teenagers and they're beginning to develop the wrong attitude maybe to Old older siblings or authority or their parents and it's a real dangerous area to be and I think it's even more dangerous when we as the adults and the parents begin to establish those types of resentments towards our own children or other people or Believers because of their faults and the real reason why it begins to harm us is we have not taken into consideration that being spiritual we consider ourselves and humble ourselves and we want to be in a position to help if the if there's the context of a relationship to do that is Paul is Paul is saying in the galatian letter to ye who are spiritual help one another and bear ye one another burdens and every man must bear his own burden and there's a little bit of give and take and there's a a huge balance that he's addressing but there's he's talking about this Prejudice or this bigotry that exists in our hearts where we see somebody who's a little bit unlike us and we really can't help them we can only look down on them or dog pile and the sermon the word became flesh and I've really got to zip through the rest of this now brother B says and I recognized the other day I share this because now it's it's you don't want all of a sudden like turn on the green light for everybody who thinks they're spiritual right and so after church it's like I'm just here to restore you I'm just here to restore you I'm being Meek right and in in the spirit of meekness sister I think your skirt's too tight right and and all of a sudden now the spiritual people are like I've been called out tonight I'm sorry brother Aaron I need to be more active in in dealing with everyone's faults wrong idea Diva and d. wrong idea he said I recognized the other day other day a selfish Spirit coming up in me saying this man's wrong I ought to tell him about it brother I'm just being honest I recognized a selfish spirit that rose up within me saying this man's wrong I ought to tell him about it now it wasn't the selfish spirit that caused him to perceive the man to be an error he was right based upon what I'm reading about the man being wrong but he was selfish in saying I to say something about it he said that's wrong God's the one to tell him about it it's none of my business it tells me that sometimes there's the lack of relationship there there's the the lack of agency there's something missing in the context to where you don't have the standing to say something if you say something you're only trying to advance yourself if you're say something you're only dog piling if you say something you're doing it for all the wrong reasons you need to pause and let God handle the situation he said it's n of my business but my business is preach the gospel and love everybody that's my business maybe I should put this up here preach the gospel and love everybody and move on and love my enemies as Jesus Christ loved me when I was his enemy I almost wondered if there was a man who had made a mistake who was very bitter towards brother Bram or maybe had castigated him publicly or done something maybe overt against brother brandham and this man makes a mistake and brother bram's kind of like you're right say well you know you're wrong right you shouldn't have done that and he says maybe he was an enemy he says but I got to love him that's right when I was unlovely he loved me to his bosom in anybody that's unlovely let me love them the same let the spirit that was in Christ be in us he says amen I love him I love him Oh my he begins to sing C it not this world's vain riches that so rapidly decay seek to gain the Heavenly [Music] Treasures they will never pass away hold to God's unchanging hand this is what he begins to sing as he's closing the service but he says I recognized a self selfish Spirit where I wanted to call somebody out for being wrong and he said that wasn't any of my business I need to love them I need to preach the gospel and he says covet not this world's vain riches seek to gain Heavenly Treasures he sings this and he sings that chorus when my journey is completed and he sings the chorus again he says is that the prayer of every man and woman boy boy or girl in here today he said God bless you and may he keep you that way humble in your spirit soft in your soul forgiving others as Christ for God's sake forgave you be kind generous welcome humble Spirit soft Soul forgiving humbl in your spirit soften in your soul forgiving others as Christ for God's sake forgive you be kind be generous be welcoming he recognized his selfish Spirit the the counter to that is the hum being humble in spirit being soft in our souls and forgiving others I'm going to power through this I'm going to finish in 1 John chapter 3: 17 and 18 but who so hath this world's Goods I hope you can see how this fits in the overall scene who ELO have this world's good there's Devas there there's the the Rich Young Ruler there's these uh the just Steward here's the priest and the levite they have this world's goods and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him now it's not explicit to us how that you could open up this compassion and you could you could somehow render Aid or help in this time of need and as brother bam said you know live for others the joy you can get from that and how that you can maybe help he said but you shut up the compassion I believe we can do this just with our attitude that when we are prejudicial and we're biased and we make these assumptions and these harsh conclusions and we lash out or we're cold or whatever it might be there's somehow that we close ourselves up and we withhold kindness we withhold friendship or prayer we withhold love we we uh we our arms length and I say this because I think this is some of our it's I I say this personally I'll just be real transparent it's a protection mechanism that when you've been hurt man you just you just separate yourself you stand your stand office you're going to you're going to uh be arms length and so you kind of close the door of those Avenues of relationship and friendship or opportunity to help but then he ask how dwelleth the love of God in him see somebody who has the AA availability this world's Goods he has opport opportunity he's as we've been talking about the rich man and and the steward and even brother Bram saying that the rich men that it's not impossible to be rich but you can't have uh these wrong opinions and these prejudices and these ideas he says how can you see somebody who's in need and then shut up compassion he says how do you have the love of God in you my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth some of us may have grown up without ever hearing much about I love you I love you and you might not have heard it very much but yet maybe there might have been acts of Love That affirmed affection or someone's interest and desire as parents to a child but it's one thing to say I love you but it's greater to show it I think it's good to be verbal and to give verbal praise and affirmation verbally that you love somebody but don't just do it in word or tongue but indeed and in truth now I want to I'm going to share these statements to CL as a way of just anchoring down this down real tight as to why this is relevant brother says how can we hold Prejudice a racial Prejudice I was reading a statement I don't have it here but I was reading through it the study where brother brandham was talking about uh Kennedy being assassinated and they even talked about this racial hatred where uh a man had just been it's in late 63 obviously in November of 63 and he says that even this uh man was just shot in racial hatred and there was a lot of race riots and a lot of things happening in the South during that time a lot of upheaval and he's saying but now our president's been killed and he begins to pray for the president's wife he says now I know we might have disagreed and she might have led this nation astray but he prays so sincere so heartfelt there wasn't this is the judgments of God on New Orleans for being so unrighteous right there wasn't this this is the judgments of God and all the homosexuals right there was it that's not the attitude that brother Ram took in this moment where it was like he could have been like yep I'm telling you she asked for it I I I told you this was coming he had such compassion he could relate to losing a spouse he prayed with empathy and he began to call upon God for this this wife of the Dead president a Jaclyn Ken was reading this week where she smoked like five packs a day there's a lot of mistruths about Obama being the first president who SP smoked couldn't hold the candle to Jackie but he says how can we hold Prejudice racial pre Prejudice how can we hold the denominational Prejudice and still saying we're walking in light how can we hold prejudice against the word of God and say the days of Miracles has passed God's Own word oh how it's a really Danger ous thing to be all closed-minded to put a period on everything to lean a particular way in the word of God in your own bias and your own judgment and because of the influence of people on you and your youth just got a certain way of seeing it and you're not willing to accept the word of God when it opens up when it becomes plain because you have a prejudice against the word of God and you say days of Miracles has passed I brother kyre Diggs was trying to walk that tight rope just even in his title fundamental people with Pentecost faith and you knew right away woohoo he's on the Highwire right and and you can't you can't say well we don't need fundamental faith we can't we can't be fundamental and you you don't want to do away with Pentecost being Pentecostal in the true sense of what is Pentecostal and so you could see here that sometimes if we lean some way you'll just reject it you call it Pentecostal or you lean the other way you reject it because it's fundamental it's just teaching because of your bias or your Prejudice I believe some times that's why the Lord ministers to us in the way that he does we're like man they were really hammering down a particular line on this line but maybe God's trying to address some bigotry in our own Hearts because if it's in God's word we want to embrace it if it's in God's word we we accept it but who can have this world's goods and not show compassion to someone in need he says how can the love of God be in you and he says it's Prejudice how can we even hold racial pre Prejudice when my uh my wife asked me what I was ministering on I said you Prejudice and bias and she was like are you going to talking about racial Prejudice and and I was do you want me to I think it's certainly part of it it listen message Believers are because they're raised in the message they're not above being racists it exists the the the the Prejudice and the discrimination and the attitudes that people can have it's it's it's disappointing but in 1 John 1:7 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another no if we're not in the light we separate we divide the atheist are are being born every minute when we can divide religion and we can create so many different factions to where it's just I'm going to give up I don't even know what flavor to subscribe to anymore there's just too much the Market's become so fragment I just want to get s out of it and here it says but if we walk in the light as he is in the light that's when two people could come together that that's when the the burlap and the L the silk or whatever that's when the uh the the farmer and the the the the banker can come together why because they find common basis they find common ground when we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another that's what begins to address our bias our bigotry our prejudice and he says and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin when we have respect to persons you have sin but when we walk in the light as his in the light we get rid of our prejudice we get rid of our bigotry we get rid of our attitudes and our preferences and our opinions and our preconceived notions and our judgments about certain things and then we begin to be washed of all the Prejudice and we hum we're humble in spirit soften our souls we're kind and generous even if they're our enemy even if they're wrong will will will will believe they're wrong without prejudice I'm not going to judge at this time it's too early it's too soon I'm not g to I'm not going to refuse to render Aid just on the basis that you know on its face this is something I don't agree with brother brandham prays this prayer in the sermon what do the Holy Ghost he says sanctify us Lord through thy precious word and thy blood and thy Grace we plead I hope you're listening I know I'm running into the after hour here didn't realize just how late it was getting but he says and all thanks and praise will be thine sanctify us this is not being sanctimonious this is not being a religious hypocrite if if I have any pretense outwardly and I've been playing the part out outwardly let me have it the part inwardly and he says take all Prejudice from our hearts cleanse us oh Lord I I I read the scripture in light of this if you walk in the light as he is in the light it'll cleanse us from all sin it cleanses us from Prejudice he says take all Prejudice from our hearts cleanse us oh Lord give us pure hearts and Clean Hands and clean Minds that we might come into thy Sanctuary night after night rejoicing and filled with your spirit we ask it in Jesus name and for his sake the prayer is that we would not have Prejudice in our hearts because Prejudice can hinder the moving of the spirit I do not want to have Prejudice in my heart because Prejudice causes me to have the kind of things in the way and I I can't be used of God like I should be I would like to amplify this more but I'll leave the scriptures and these statements with you and summarize try to summarize it with this lengthy quote Brothers if you could come to your instruments it'd be fine he's again talking from first John if our heart condemn us or one of the Epistles of John if our heart condemn us not but if there's something in your life that condemns you you better make that thing right the Instinct of a sanctimonious person it's almost like the seeds of sanctimony are in that conviction or that feeling that maybe somebody has something you don't or is unlike you and they may still be right and so In This Moment there's this idea you you sense May something that maybe they do have something that you need or may maybe they are right and when your heart begins to condemn you I know this might I might be getting into something at 8:40 that maybe I shouldn't but it swws that seed of now I've got to justify got to find a reason to reject them I I I can't stand this dissonance I I don't like to think these things I I don't like this idea what how I'm being challenged he says something condemns you in your heart he says just make that thing right he says I don't care what in the world he says you just can't operate right the Holy Spirit can't deal with you when you have prejudice and selfishness and all those things in you the Holy Spirit can never bless you now this is this is where the instinct is to immediately begin to find justification in your life towards like oh no uh-uh no I've been blessed I've shouted I've danced I screamed I've done this I've done that no God blesses me he says you might get some intellectual emotions some workup it's amazing how often people show the divide that the true Pentecostal faith is one thing in intellectualism as another Pentecostal faith in the sense of Pentecostalism that's not the truth that's not the word that's not the the the genuine anointing on the genuine seed that is just the quote unquote little case P Pentecostalism the penny brother bam was talking about that it is intellectualism it is formalism in a different sense they're they're the same Brothers it was presenting a little bit differently at the time but he says you might get some intellectual emotion some workup and this to me I I I'm not going to try to explain this cuz he says let me just explain something to you so you catch what he's trying to say here so profound I know you've heard this before you can't operate with prejudice and selfishness says let me explain something to you for instance when a woman gets married and she's afraid that she's not going to have a baby she won't have it no but let her go and adopt a baby then she'll have one he said now the books claim that that's nine out of 10 will do that why it sets her body in the right emotion and ask your doctor if that's not right why it puts her in the right attitude now if we just think about that he's trying to explain to us how Prejudice and selfishness keeps the Holy Spirit from blessing us and then when a woman adopts a baby how it puts her in the right attitude it's it's taking her mind off the selfishness and the prejudice the prejudgments all in other words she's chosen to live for something else that wasn't even hers they've adopted a child who's in need and now it sets are in the right attitude and it's not the attitude of necessarily being motherly it's not just the attitude of no longer fearing it's the attitude of that I filled my life up with genuine service to something needy I I'm doing something outside of myself this isn't self-serving I'm not declaring oh God bless my womb and I'm fruitful but it's the humility to even adopt the child and serve one that's not her own listen think of the example let me explain something to you said a woman it's like this a woman who can't have a baby and she's afraid she can't so she doesn't and when she gets out of the selfish mind and the Prejudice and she serves begins to serve this baby she gets in the right attitude and the Holy Spirit blesses her with the child and then he says job said the things that I feared worse has come upon me he says you want to be above everything you want to be above everything where there's no condemnation or nothing to you above the selfishness above the Prejudice you got to live like real Christians live in the presence of God live daily hourly momently say nothing do nothing go nowhere let it be Christlike everything you do all your actions God requires us absolutely abstain from all things of the world World separation I want to toot my own horn if you don't mind I woke up this morning to go a doctor's to a doctor's appointment and low and behold someone had stole our Suburban come to find out it was a tow truck driver who at the request of the HOA Association hell on arrogance I don't know what that stands for but really HOAs are something else but it was they they towed the card and it's so immediately in my mind I'm like I'm a lawyer I've dealt with this before this is going to be fun it cost me 250 bucks to get my car back they're going to pay at least that much in lawyer fees right you know you know how it works and but somehow some way I just chose to try to to to be nice and in the end I realized it's kind of just what we need to be as Christians even if we deal with the grievance even if there's something that's been wrong like you got to we've got to find a way to Humble ourselves and not be harsh and bitter and cruel and mean-spirited and God wants us to abstain from all things of the world world he says separation he said be Christlike in everything you do the world wants mixers they'll go down to the beach and bathe or have a card party in the basement Bunko in the church let me tell you God wants separators who will separate men and women from sin he says listen it condemns and there's where the sin condemns our hearts and he said if your heart condemns you deal with the sin but in the midst of this it's just it it's so amazing how he's dancing in and out of this selfishness and this prejudice he says let me show you something he's giving you the example of the woman who couldn't have a baby and was fearful and what she feared Came Upon her but then she can't get out of this mode of selfishness whatever these judgments and these biases are this Prejudice brother B refers to that somehow in adopting and living outside of herself and and hopefully she's not adopting for selfish reasons but something happens that puts her in the right attitude and he starts talking about we need to be Christlike he says let me show you something I apologize for going lengthy now so say for instance it's right now quarter till 10 by my time it's a quarter till 99 by my time says what if Joseph here which I know he would not but a week from today he wasn't a Christian and he wanted to defend a friend of his so he tried to say that he was in Philadelphia at this time on Tuesday night at 8 or 10 or what the 8th or 10th or whatever it is and he goes 9th 9th of June at quarter of 10 he was in Philadelphia because he has to defend that friend in other words a budd's in trouble he needs an alibi and so Joseph not being a Christian's willing to say oh no I was in Philadelphia on June 9th at 10:00 qu till 10 and he says all right they take his word for it and he says I solemnly swear he can say that intellectually but way down in his soul he knows it's wrong so they bringed him to trial and they say Mr Bose so he's talking about Brother Joseph Bose do you solemnly swear that you were in Philadelphia at a certain place certain certain place on Tuesday night June the 9th 1959 I solemnly swear that I was right here with my friend right here at a certain certain place said go get the lie detector fastened it across his wrist Mr Bose will you hold your hand and swear to that he say now i' I've got to make it look out to I make make it out to look right he can put on a big face yes sir my most precious friend I saw me here swear that I was a certain certain place up here in Philadelphia on that night and he's just wanting to show us something the hypocrisy the the dissonance and he says man wasn't made to tell a lie man was made to tell the truth he says if you can't throw back an old Prejudice and selfishness how do you expect God to ever answer prayer we're wanting our our home life to be blessed we want our individual lives we want to be a home to Christ we want our families to be blessed we want to see the blessings of God in our home and we want houses to be made into homes you're never going to be do it be able to do it selfishly you're never going to be able to do it with prejudice whether it be Prejudice towards one another the contempt and the Prejudice that can begin to breed in the competitiv between spouses or the the the feeling of a lack of attention or the the letting go whatever it might be that can begin to brew within a marriage and within a household attitude towards children children towards parents I'm wanting to Simply Focus the spotlight on Prejudice tonight so that we can in our individual lives say I want to act without prejudice Act without harm to my children Act without harm to my wife Act without harm to my brothers and sisters I want to withhold the wrong kind of judgment I don't want to be a respector of persons nor a disrespect of persons how can you not get rid of your Prejudice and selfishness and expect God to ever answer your prayer oh you can speak with tongues jump over the seats and shout and beat the tambourines and talk about your neighbor out there don't you expect God to ever answer prayer for you take the name of Jesus with you can speak with tongues jump over the seats and shout beat the tambourines you can have all the Optics of Pentecost you want and talk about your neighbor out there to shut up the bowels of compassion to be prejudicial to be biased to be a racist whatever you want to say to to be nasty to spew out hatred I believe we could even revisit how empathy uh is the answer to hate and some of these different things that we've addressed as I study these things I feel like man I'm just stuck in a circle in this Arena of all these different thoughts and the reason why is because these things hinder our prayers don't ever expect God to answer prayer when your heart condemns you of your Prejudice and selfishness so we just address it and I believe we should have hearts without prejudice homes without bias that doesn't mean we don't have standards it doesn't mean we don't have boundaries but we we're unselfish we're forward looking and we're Christlike and how that we view ourselves and especially how we treat others especially those we love can we just rise tonight together and pray
