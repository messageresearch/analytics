TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're going to continue on uh the subject of the house of the Lord and uh we've been exploring it through a number of different services to this point and a lot of these things all kind of connect together for myself I see this continuity of a number of different um touch points and uh building blocks in this subject but today I want to take the title why houses fall just drawing it from these four verses here on these different foundations why houses fall and recapping the last few services on this series the house of the Lord and laying a good foundation and some of those subjects that we were on uh we are using how the in the building of the house of the Lord um it's an example to us we've seen how the house of the Lord is a type of us um a type of us as individuals a type of our families a type of our church type of the body of Christ but we've been looking at how that in the building and the construction of the temple that it was it's an example to us in the wisdom and preparation that was used to establish the temple and to build it and the Bible tells us that all of Solomon's work when he began to build the temple was carefully considered and accounted for before work ever began there were materials uh procured and there was things carved out and things put together M materials fabricated a and and he made sure he made alliances with Kings and he made sure that he had everything he needed to build the temple before uh one thing was done and so it was a great work that was done and a lot of work done beforehand before you'd ever see something being built uh someone could uh when someone builds a house and you start to see the foundation go in and the framing go up and you say oh it took them six months to build that house well that might have just been in the visible construction there's a lot of things that take place uh before that to put you in a position uh uh to build and and sometimes it's a lot of time that goes by and you can just blame the city or the county for that cuz they just drag your feet on Perman processes but the that's right but the uh we've been looking at in that that a foundation or the beginning of something is not necessarily just the Bedrock or the first thing that's laid down but it's all the principles and planning that goes into the building beforehand and in the actual foundation of the temple it was very uh very deep in the ground it was and then once they got deep in the ground they used hard Stones durable Stones things that um were United to the Earth so that it would the Earth would have to pass away before this building would pass away and so it could withstand the test of time uh because its basis was Secure it's be its foundation or its Beginnings in principle was sure uh it was the Lord's uh doing and it was uh thought out and well planned and carefully planned but then its basis was Secure it was on the on the Bedrock it was sound and in Psalms 11: 3 and 4 it says if the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do and then it says the Lord is in his holy Temple the Lord's Throne is in heaven his eyes behold his eyelids try the children of men just that image of the Lord being in his Temple his throne being in heaven and what that was to represent on Earth with the temple and the Temple's Foundation uh where there was great stones and it was costly and it was a great work it says this and referring to a little bit different situation but yet the principle remains if the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do because it's if if the if order is upset if if the rules of right and Justice and and uh and what is right and correct is destroyed the very principles upon which things are governed and the laws by which a thing is governed are destroyed then it's chaos it's Anarchy and so here we realize that foundations are not just physical but it's the principles upon which the thing is built and if the foundation be destroyed then that which is built will fail that's what it's saying if the foundations be destroyed then what can the righteous do there's it doesn't matter how well the structure is built if you destroy the foundation the house is doomed if the foundations be destroyed then whatever is built upon that foundation will be ruined again regardless of what is built if what supports it is compromised it's going to eventually fall that brings us to the subject today of why houses fall and if you look at Matthew chapter 7 we'll just begin to go through this text a little bit we want to I want to examine the the parable of these two houses or you could say two foundations and I think in looking at this there's personal truths that we can glean from this uh but yet what I realized in in just putting these thoughts together and uh and there's been one particular very specific things I'd like to get to I may just have to do it Wednesday night I was wanting to do it on a Sunday morning but just some things that get to that I'm looking at but then it just seemed like it just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger and I want to slow down and take some things that are very practical but I'll I'll get it all out there this morning Lord willing but as we go through this glean very practical things from the scripture that answer or that are why houses fall and and look at yourself as an individual you can look at yourself as a family in your home or even churches and you'll realize there's very practical things that the Bible ask us to do or that we ought to be doing that are indicative of whether or not we're laying the right kind of foundation or building the right way now in Matthew chapter 7 we'll start with verse 21 we'll read to verse 23 and then we'll jump back uh to verse 24 here in a little bit says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven so you could read it this way he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven shall enter into to the kingdom of heaven but not just those who say Lord Lord so then he says many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity now brother brandham uh when he takes this and he gives us kind of the Divine commentary on it he he affirms this that Christ does not deny that they had cast out devils and that they had prophesied so it's not that Jesus it's not that we should read this to say oh they're lying and that's the real issue uh but they and and Jesus doesn't dispute that he doesn't say oh uh you never did that but he says depart from me ye that work iniquity and what's so outstanding is Works were at the heart of their objection or their question we've prophesied in name we in your name we've cast out devils and we've done many wonderful works and I would say the wonderful Works tie back to these other things that they speak of and he's saying he calls the work iniquity now I wouldn't I'm not suggesting that prophesying or casting out devils in these wonderful works are the iniquity but he's saying they worked but they're not righteous the the iniquities to contrast with with righteousness and brother Brandon makes this statement in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says neither can you bear God's sons of his word to this illegitimate denominational group and it says kind of I realized maybe I could have included a lot more before but it just that just keeps getting bigger and bigger so you can't bring forth denominations cannot bring forth a child of God says you cannot do it if your incubator in your incubator you cannot bring forth a word Son of God I'm speaking to the church but still you claim to be very religious so Cain the prostitute eveon very religious built altars and offered sacrifices paid his tithe and done everything that any other religious man would do but he failed to keep that word and then this connection is very important today he failed to have the Revelation now Cain worshiped he he built altars he worshiped he called upon the Lord and and the distinction in the scripture is that Cain did many wonderful works but he didn't obey the word and his obedience failed because he didn't have Revelation and so failing to have the Revelation he didn't have the rock because Revelation is the rock it's the only foundation so Revelation is one of those blocks that I need you to build upon today but Cain was very religious but he failed to keep the word in the sermon the indictment and I I want to put this here but I hope you hold on to it I was going to use it later but I hope you hold on to it he says today men walk ignorantly they don't know that that's the truth they think it's some kind of ism and I'll just say they don't know the message is the truth they think it's just bromism they think it's a cult they think it's just some fanaticism he says they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't call upon God enough and what are we taught that we should call upon God for more than anything Revelation they just lightly take it oh well I believe there's a God sure the devil believes the same thing the devil believes it more than some people claim to believe believe it the devil believes it and trembles people just believe it and go on and where's where's the problem not in that they believe it not in that they've heard it or they've heard the wrong thing they're hearing it but they don't dig down deep enough there needs to be some deepness they're not digging down deep enough so that concept of there being something there but you don't dig down deep enough to see it for what it is to really get the Revelation and in lacking the Revelation they just believe it and go on they're not getting in the spirit of Revelation they're not praying and calling upon God to then receive it and really walk in it because he says they walk ignorantly so as Jesus is saying this not everyone that says Lord Lord is going to enter the kingdom of heaven and he's laying out some of these very specific works that they'll do what is that issue is the failure to obey the word of God he says he that does the will of my father the will of father is his word this is a failure to obey the word of God to do God's Will and at the heart of it it's a question of faith if someone hears the word and claims to believe it but doesn't do it that's not real Faith that's just some sort of ascent and acknowledgement on an intellectual level but real faith is demon there's a demonstration when there's real Faith so by Revelation there's a demonstration of the inspiration that came to you at the incantation of the word of the Bride Nation but there's a when you have Revelation it's demonstration that that's when you really you're living it out you're not it's not an impersonation that's the alliteration that I could have ended on but the uh so the issue is obedience and if there's not obedience it's a question of do you really believe it's a question of faith and you may profess Many religious works like I did this and I did that and I did this and I did that but he says their Works were not build these Works were not building anything and Jesus is going to get into a parable of Foundations and so Jesus is showing a key to a firm foundation I I believe these three verses here are just as critical to understanding verses 24- 27 as verses 24- 27 are critical to understanding it you've got to these parts are very very important he's showing us the key to a firm foundation and it's obedience through Revelation there's got to be obedience according to Revelation because if it's just according to education that's just imp personation right so in Luke 11: 27- 28 it says and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the woman that bear thee and the paps which thou Hast sucked but he said now think of how that's giving honor and glory and praise bless the woman and bless the bless the church and Bless the Virgin Mary blessed is this he says but he said yay rather Christ now yay rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it right it's like someone saying oh your mom is awesome your mom is blessed your mom is great and give honor to your mom and she should be revered and she should be blessed he say my mom no blessed is the one that hears the word and keeps it so in the face of this praise that seems to give lip service and would be honoring the message of the hour and giving credence and and glory to something this is a question of honoring the Lord with your lips but not your life and this is not the right kind of building or you're not building on the right kind of foundation this Foundation of just presuming this Foundation of of of really not being serious that you could just say oh bless the woman that bear thee said no blessed is the one that hears my word and does it not everyone that cast out Devils is going to be in the kingdom of God but it's the one that hears the word and does his and does it now that's pretty uh that's a pretty interesting statement and we'll come to it maybe more here in a second especially when you say well doesn't the word tell us that we can C we should cast out devils and doesn't it say that we could should do this and do that but yet he saying well that's not that's not the point in James chapter 1:22 it says be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own s so one that hears and does not do deceives themselves and it's a product of Deceit therefore again we see this contrast to Revelation or understanding that a hearer who does not do is deceived but one who hears and does is one that's operating by Revelation and it should be pointed out that in the parable of both Builders both heard the sayings both were inspired to build both lived in what they built but only one obeyed is that isn't that remarkable though they both hear the sayings of the Lord they both begin to build they both enter into the shelter for a place of security and rest but only one actually obeyed in Romans 2:13 for not the hearers of the law are just before God but the doers of the law shall be justified that that just to be just is it uh and I want to come to it more in a moment but let me just make this connection just in just Justified and Justice relate to righteousness to be just it's one that lives according to the word therefore they're righteous to be just is one that's right or correct and so it's rooted in the concept of righteousness the foundations be destroyed what can the just or the righteous do in 1 John CH 3: 6-7 whosoever abideth in him sinth not whosoever sinth hath not seen him neither known him there's a there's that sin is unbelief and therefore those that don't believe don't know him they haven't their eyes haven't been opened to see him so if the if you see the results of sin or the evidence of unbelief or the symptoms of unbelief it can be rooted in a lack of faith a lack of Revelation little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he which the suggestion is it's Christ even as Christ is righteous he that doeth righteousness is righteous he that does Justice is just he that does uh good is good he that is doing the will of God is in the will of God he that does the word of God is the word of God so I think it's important to kind of catch this this uh theme in the scripture Jesus says those that hear the word and don't do it they are workers of iniquity they are they are sinful they are unrighteous but he that hears the word word and does it he's righteous so there is this to me I'll just throw it out there for you to chew on a little bit or Ponder think of the difference then between the wonderful works that and that word wonderful is dunamis it's powerful these powerful works and how they're not the same as the righteous works of God you can do many wonderful Works in his name right and brother BR even says there's a righteous unart of the name so people can have access to the power through the name but it not be righteousness it's powerful works it's wonderful works it's casting out Devils it's prophesying in his name do many wonderful Works powerful works but Christ is saying there's a difference between those types of things in the righteous works of God again I'm preaching on why Houses full you ought to think of yourself as a house you should think of your families as a home as a house a household and also a church amen these wonderful works are not the same as the righteous works of God the works that were being done here in their totality in the day he said was iniquity Psalms 145:17 the Lord is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works so the works of the Lord could not be uh would not be guilty of failing the will of God and righteousness I want you to think about it this way it's the reality that's in God it's the reality that's been created by God and and and sustained by God and ordered by his word right he's righteous and holy in all his works and in all his ways so righteousness is the reality of God it's how he thinks it's how he acts whatever God does is right whatever he does is just whatever he says is truth and so righteousness is that godlikeness it is God whatever he does is there unrighteousness with God no when he commands something to be done is it unrighteous no no matter how horrific it may seem to us as individuals he's God and in Galatians chapter 5: 5 and Jesus even saying he that hunger thirst after righteousness shall be filled there's this righteousness becomes an aspiration Beyond just doing wonderful works you know what can we do Jesus what can we do to work the wonderful works of God believe on him who he has sent knowing that real belief will uh follow in conduct and action so it says for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith and one thing we like to emphasize quite a bit when we mentioned righteousness is righteousness is the state of him who is as he ought to be to be righteous to be to be as you ought to be to be righteous is to be in the condition that God wants you to be in and it's righteousness according to Romans 3 322 it's righteousness by faith here in Galatians 5:5 the hope of righteousness by faith it's righteousness by faith so it's righteousness by Revelation that there's there's this faith that cultivates righteousness it comes from this place of understanding this is the beginning this is the foundation of faith and then it works itself into a manifestation of righteousness we through the spirit wait for the hope this is the expectation for those who have the spirit righteousness will come forth to do right am and if I could say this if we if we made it that we ought to prophesy that we ought to speak in tongues that we ought to do these different things and we ought to manifest a certain way then that's where we misde Define righteousness right because the righteousness is to be as you ought to be and then we kind of turn that around and make it out to where if you don't do this if you don't do this if you don't do this and we can't bring that back to the word to show no these are the works of righteousness not just the power that comes with his name but the reality of the life f 1 John 3:12 it says not as Cain he's talking about love and loving your brother who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him why did Cain kill Abel Cain killed his brother because Cain's Works were evil and and Abel's Works were righteous here's the response of Cain to his brother when he act according to Revelation remember righteousness is one who is keeps God's word by faith so these righteous Works were works that were done by faith worship that was done according to Revelation and Cain murders his brother because his Works Cain's Works were evil and his brothers were righteous now again think of this Cain murdered Abel because of the comparison of Works Abel's is by Revelation Cain's is by inspiration and Cain's Works to offer the most beautiful sacrifice most well put together altar the most uh sensory pleasing experience when it comes to worship and so if you were kind of comparing the two you'd be like I'm going to go to Kane's Church uh Abel's yours is a mess quite frankly it stinks there's a lot of flies right a a and and you're and you would say that kan's got it put together he understands like I can post this on Instagram right I mean this belongs on Truth social or whatever this this here is worth it this to me is pleasing to the eye this is something that that I could get behind and so in comparison it'd be quite Frank it's kind of odd to say this was evil and this is righteous but the difference was Revelation that's all in Hebrews 11:4 by faith abble and I say that's all it's because it uh there was a difference in the actual worship but the reason why Abel did what he did is because he had Faith Hebrews 114 by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh Abel by faith or by Revelation offered worship and sacrifice and because by Revelation he worshiped and manifested he obtained witness that he was righteous so you see the clear scriptural principle that when you act by faith that's righteousness when you act by Revelation that's the work of righteousness that's that's what God's looking for so God gives the Revelation he manifests the Revelation or it's the manifestation of the Revelation and now he obtains witness and as testation that he's righteous and now in Acts chapter 10 verses 34 to35 let me just wrap up this portion then Peter opened his mouth and saith this is the gospel going to the Gentiles of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons well what does he what does he uh look for but in every nation he that feareth him there's your faith there's your belief there's your respect and worketh righteousness is accepted with him this is what God looks for Faith and works by faith the kind of the James the James angle that a man is justified by his works that this is the outward manifestation of his Revelation in every nation where one fears God keeps his Commandments and demonstrates the the word of God and lives the life that's the one that obtains witness that he is righteous so there's a vast difference in the scripture in these uh Optics of wonderful works and the real belief and faith in God that is the work works of righteousness so Jesus saying that he that does the will of the father will enter into heaven not just everybody who can say they've done a lot of good work is going to enter into heaven but he that hears the word and does it so this is how he amplifies it in verse 24 therefore whosoever heareth these says of mine and doeth them I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about I'm going to give you a parable to understand what I'm mean in verses 21 to 23 so the parable is giving us Enlightenment about this statement that those who do the will of God will enter and not just those that do wonderful works in the name of the Lord therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock this term wise speaks of one that is Discerning and deliberate the word actually one of the ways it could be translated as Provident or prudent and that means this when one is wise in this sense it's not just knowing if you're wise and and you're Discerning it's not being able just to go to Wikipedia and look up a fact to be wise is not knowing history uh wisdom is not demonstrated in winning trivia that's not wisdom wisdom would be able to know by fact what's coming or using knowledge to anticipate something that is happening or transpiring and so to be prudent or providential it's to foresee wants it's to foresee lackings it's to foresee things and then making provision to supply them in advance so when you have discernment or you're providential or you're prudent you see something that's needful and in seeing the need you supply the provision you meet the need in advance before the lacking causes some failure amen like oh man we should bolster that up before the the monsoons come right and and then the monsoons come and guess what the tree the tree is laying over the car or the the the some fence fell down or something faed you're like ah I knew I should have put something up I knew I should have bll I put it should have put in another screw that's not wisdom sometimes that's just for that's just seeing the obvious but wisdom is acting in advance to secure against something that's what this wisdom is and I think it's very obvious in the scripture so I don't expect a lot of Wows and let's goes and come on this is amazing this is just the this is just the truth the plain truth of the scripture through Providence the wise man builds his house upon a rock and he's the example of one that knows and then does he's the example of one that looks at something goes oh there's a need here you know what I should probably make sure the need is filled and not wait till the winds are blowing but then in contrast we have in verse 26 and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be liken unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand this is in direct contrast where you could you could create these columns and show uh the check marks of what one does and what one doesn't do and this comparison between the two they both hear they both build they both live they both can endure the same storms so we'll come to that so there is this things that they are but there is one thing that's different one is wise and one is foolish means unknowing now foolish is to be not wise he's not prudent he doesn't fully understand now this is where I think the problem comes when it says that uh that we know him and we've seen him uh we kind of have this idea that it's just if we could just say well the message is right or William was a prophet or we can know the scripture we can know that Jesus Christ died for our sins and we can even believe that it's true and he rose from the dead and so we said well that's not ignorance but foolishness is knowing all that and not realizing the severity and the meaning and the implications and what it really means that he was a Vindicated prophet and what it really means is that the message is true and what it really means that he had to die on the cross and really what it means that he rose from the dead and what it means that you're a sinner and the need to be born again all those things so to be foolish is to not necessarily not know but to not have understanding as to not be providential somebody who looks at a a something a wall or a part of a building in a structure and just that example kind of came to me as I was ministering so I apologize if it's maybe not fully explained but if one sees a need in a structure and like oh my the winds are going to come later this year and that tree is going to fall or that Wall's going to fall or this covering is going to fall I should either cut the tree down now or I should I should put up some more structures I should have a contractor come look at it a person who sees that and doesn't do anything even though they said they saw something was lacking they clearly could not appreciate the need to do something about it or if they did that's the real foolishness cuz they didn't do anything about it that's why foolishness to say oh man if I don't cut that tree down now it's going to fall right across my my brand new electric car and and my Tesla and it's it's going to happen and I know it's going to happen and then you just go right inside and you say man I sure hope there's a firmware update where the car just kind of knows it's coming and just backs out and so if we bring that back to Caine brother bam talks about Cain creating an incubator well that's kind of maybe my the way I'm saying an incubator which is nice and cozy and warm and everything looks good but he said it doesn't it's not going to bring forth righteousness can't produce a sun denominations cannot bring forth life it's an incubator Cain did not have Revelation the reason why he slew his brothers he did not have Revelation so Cain's initial offering as we want to look at kind of this difference it could be excused because of the lack of Revelation am I right am I right it's got to be a meme for that right a gift I could use there's he doesn't know Abel does know Cain doesn't know so Cain's initial effort to please the Lord initial effort to worship we could say hey man he doesn't know any better I mean we wouldn't want to just call Cain a fool day one and Abel's over there hacking away at an animal a a and C's over there just creating a real beautiful Altar and guess guess which service Mom and Dad attended probably like what's going on with Abel over there gu is a psycho and and so you could maybe excuse it initially like I don't call Cain a fool Abel would be wrong to say you're a fool Cain Cain doesn't know but then he does and it's Cain's insistence on not obeying that demonstrates his foolishness yeah in the beginning we could say that it it was foolishness to him what Abel was doing and he was a fool to think that it was from the ground and he was lacking and there wasn't discernment there's a lot of things we could say about him but whenever he knows that's foolishness to insist on not obeying now maybe he abandons the fruit offering maybe abandons the altar maybe abandons worship and we'd say well that's not a good thing to do but the real foolishness is not in doing what God said to do and God says if you don't do else that's sin but he's telling them you got to you should obey so what did Cain he knew now God speaking to him if you just do as your brother did would you not well also be accepted which we could say he that hears and fears and works righteousness is accepted by God but if I could say this way Cain kind of knowing the surface of it you could have asked him Cain so what does God requir say blood con offering should be give the one that Abel gave the one my brother gave but he lacked the real concern concerning the truth he lacked an awareness of the consequences or at least did not appreciate them or didn't fear the consequences didn't respect them James chapter 4:1 17 therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin knowledge without practice is imputed to sin knowledge without obedience and that's really at the core of this Parable we I was Finding where the rabbis had these in their tradition oral tradition they had their traditional sayings of one who knew the law but didn't practice it is like a tree with no root and and therefore does not produce any fruit and so it's kind of Jesus is building on the same idea that they would have had within their oral tradition that one who has knowledge but doesn't act in it that's sin that's iniquity so just as righteousness is imp imputed H uh uh by faith and by faith you work and it's imputed as righteousness imputed to him that believes and to the faithful and to those that have faith one who knows but does not do it's imputed a sin you see the Counterpoint he that has Revelation in Acts it's imputed is righteousness according to the word he that has Faith it's imputed to him is righteousness but he that hears and does not do to him it is sin for to know to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin and when the Bible uses the phrase a foolish man and I'm realizing now I'm running out of time and that we may uh I'll amplify some more of this maybe Wednesday night this I the the consequence of um Tom Foolery or foolishness a foolish man to use that phrase I liken him unto a foolish man obviously it's a wise man versus a foolish man we see that contrast but it's wanting us to understand it's a term to indicate something lacking in the character of the person something lacking in their wisdom that there's a wise man and there's certain characteristics of one that is wise and there's a foolish man uh and there's certain characteristics of a man who is a fool so it's an ual condition that has very real symptoms and consequences it's not just putting labels and saying those of you who uh starting starting with you go one two one two all the odds here and all the evens there I mean it's not just something random this is rooted in real wisdom or real Folly Proverbs 14:16 a wise man fearth and departeth from evil but the fool rageth and is confident a fool no can be very inspired very emotional he rageth in other words this is there's some motivation a man a wise man fears and and and separates himself from something that is evil that's the wisdom of genuine knowledge that's the wisdom of running into a situation be like whoa I'm getting out of here right this is bad this isn't good or this is going to happen the monsoons are coming or this is evil God warns about this and and this is what a wise man does he sees it and he gets away from it he gets himself out of the situation but it says the the fool rageth and is confident and so and if you look at it this way it's kind of like the the wise man comes up against the situation says whoa this is bad I'm getting out of here and the foolish man goes whoa this is bad I'm going to tackle this I'm going to correct this I'm going to I can handle this and so he rages and it's a false confidence because it's based on false knowledge there's a false security the wise man fears and departs the wise man sees ahead of time as providential he's prudent he acts in advance knowing something's coming even if it means you get you remove yourself from the situation so there's that it's a false confidence versus a genuine knowledge now I I feel I need to stop here in not even halfway through but I want to just stop here and say this this I hope that you can begin to make very practical rubber meets the road conclusions about why houses fall when it comes to exercising wisdom and exercising foolishness and how there is this thought of righteousness by faith and sin by foolishness or sin by intellectual Faith or sin by carnality Sin Sin with knowledge without an appreciation so it's the wisdom versus uh uh versus this intellectual or you could say reverse it and say carnal wisdom versus Faith because there's this other other way that we could begin to talk about human knowledge and Human Experience and those things but it says this in Proverbs 15: 5-6 I'm wanting you to begin to glean uh we could maybe we could maybe hit a spot where I'll speed up and we can can be done so we don't just transition into communion this this afternoon but in Proverbs chapter 15: 5 and 6 a fool despiseth his father's instruction so going back to what Jesus said I want to make this point now when Jesus gives this Parable this is what he's drawing from the the the ti the connection points to uh to wisdom and foolishness that it's principles that would have been very rooted and grounded especially to a scribe or a Pharisee or the teachers of the law the rabbis they would have understood what the Psalms said what the Proverbs said and what the Old Testament said and this idea of foolishness and wisdom I mean scripturally the worst thing you could be is foolish it's the worst thing you could be a fool despiseth his father's instruction let me just say this uh you can brag about being a virgin but if you're foolish means nothing right a fool despiseth his father's instruction but he that regardeth reproof is prudent a fool despiseth his father father's instruction but he that regardeth this instruction regardeth the correction understands that when a parent says don't do this or give some instruction understand there must be a reason why this is being said there must be some kind of uh warning or there's there's a benefit in even giving respect to Authority there's even a benefit in acknowledging when one who has greater wisdom or authority or position uh uh expresses something a certain way then I'm going to regard it I'm going to respect it I'm going to acknowledge it I'm going to I'm going to digest it and and that is wise man hears the reproof a wise man considers what he's looking at whereas a fool despises it and then it says in the house of the righteous is much treasure now this is you know write this down in the house of the righteous is much treasure but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble wow some of us may have a lot of revenues large money right but it's trouble but then in the house of the righteous there's much treasure wisdom according to the scripture that Insight the foresight by faith wisdom Prudence being providential seeing things ahead of time understanding something that you uh if you want to say it's factual historical but it's being able to take the things that we know and been have given an understanding or given knowledge of it's having the understanding and revelation of what you've heard and seen to know that it projects into the future and it dictates and tells me these are the right things to do right now for what's to come wisdom securely builds the house and then richly fills the house securely builds it and then fills it that's what wisdom does the house of the righteous is much treasure in this house are a lot of good things a lot of beautiful things uh Treasures but in the house of a fool though he might have a lot these revenues are trouble so if I could before we go to the next part go to verse 24 and then read again and get further down verses 25 and 26 uh uh so we could and then verse 27 we could see this contrasting Revelation brings security o this obedience which is born from trust now in this image I want you to catch this here is one who hears the word of God and does it and Jesus says he's like a man who builds his house upon a rock in other words he trusts what he heard am he trust it when the Lord says to do something I trust him when he says the right way to be baptized is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I trust him when he says that our lives ought to be holy and women ought to dress a certain way I trust them when he says that men ought to be a certain way I trust them when the word God says something I trust him I don't start going I don't know I don't know uh-uh no I don't know and then just kind of build a structure that looks like a house of God but isn't because I didn't trust God's plans I didn't trust his blueprints God says build a house this way and those that hear it and want to do it they build it this way the others hear it and say oh you want a house well that looks good but I'll build you a house and so Revelation brings security because it's obedience which is born from trust foolishness brings trouble foolishness brings trouble all right how many how many want me to continue just raise your hands got to get them up get them up there's just no way those that don't want me to will win the day so the motion carries I know that wouldn't maybe EX exactly be parliamentary procedure but we had enough votes to continue that will be the only chance you had thank you in Matthew chapter 7 veres 24- 27 I'm just kind of looking at where I'm at hopefully I can finish this he says therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock let me tell you who I'm talking about that's in the Kingdom he's the one that hears and trusts and does the word and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand thinking Luke it might say the earth and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell you'll notice that the exact same things happen the rains come floods come the winds come one stands or one Falls not and the other one Falls and great was the fall of it a wise man's Foundation I I need to build on a lot of the things we've already expressed in some of these prior prior sermons on laying a good foundation but a wise man found wise men Foundation as we look at the building of the temple it was that habit of doing things the right way it was hearing the plans hearing the word and knowing that if God says to do something it's wise to do it and not just pay lip service to it this wise men's Foundation even if you could use some language as this pattern of good works in the founding because it says it was founded upon a rock settled and grounded it was established and that word means laid down a foundation or it even refers to the first principles of something it was founded in its Beginnings its principles it was built it was based upon something it had some logos to it it had some conviction it had some understanding it wasn't just knee-jerk reaction it just wasn't religion but it was founded upon a rock and its Beginnings it had the right kind of beginning it was operating by the right kind of principles and so the wise man was doing work in the beginning to secure it against the future floods he did things in the beginning that put him in a stronger position in the presence of rain he was doing things on a daily basis in the absence of wind that was going to give him strength when the winds came and so this Foundation gave strength to the house the foundation supported the house the rock gave power and strength to the house and kept it from falling in other words it kept it from ruin ruin amen the rain above the floods from below the winds from every side in every way this house was attacked beaten from every side but it stood and in 1 Timothy chapter 6: 19 this is the very image that this scripture could draw from laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life the pattern of good works the things that Paul was expressing to Timothy that one ought to do who has the Holy Ghost and how they ought to live and to act it's laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the rain to come against the floods to come against the winds to come that you may stand if great was the fall of the house then great was the stand of the house and it was because it was built upon a rock if I could say this and this is maybe forecasting a little a little bit but failing if I say failure under pressure is often the result of poor effort in the beginning not what's happening in the moment this is very practical failure under pressure is often the result of the the lack of effort in the beginning of something and not because of your sincerity in the moment not because your appreciation of the winds in the moment and your fear of the flood in the moment in your in the moment the wind the monsoon comes and you realize the palty just like it's born to do is going to fall and you're looking at you're going this is going to fall on my Tesla and now there's some anxiety in that moment you appreciate the situation you're concerned you want to do something about it right you see something happening in your family and you realize your daughter at 18 years old is going a certain way or your son is doing something and in the moment you're like this isn't right this shouldn't happen I don't want my children to do this and you realize your family's fractioning a little bit and something bad happen you think Lord I didn't want this to happen I knew this was wrong I knew there was a real problem here I was praying and I was sincere your attitude in the moment isn't the reason why it fail it was your attitude when she was 12 it was your lack of concern oh I could just stay home I don't have to go to church anymore we don't have to make the effort I don't care if kids eat free and then you pay the price one day because it didn't matter at the time and in the moment you care in the moment you're worried in the moment you realize I may lose my son to the world I may lose my family my spouse is no longer happy with the Lord and something's wrong and in the moment you're sincere in the moment you're calling unto God in the moment your heart is broken and you see it for what it is but you didn't have wisdom before that's right any Builder can tell you that Foundation problems are the worst problems you get they've made some remarkable progress in their ability to repair foundations but if you there's certain things that if you have a problem with it and it's remarkable what they can do nowadays with the the framing and the remodeling and you could look at a house these days and you could a house that's just got walls everywhere loadbearing walls everywhere and they can engineer it now just to remove all of them it's going to cost you some Gus but they can do it they can engineer around it but if the foundation can't be repaired the foundation's destroyed it's like man you could put $150,000 into this uh powder bathroom to remove that wall but uh the foundation's horrible I I can't even I can't even engineer this in a way because the slab won't support it it's not it wasn't done right to begin with Foundation problems in a building are often the result of improper design in the beginning not knowing the ground you're working with not knowing the way to the building that's going to be going on it poor construction of the slab so when you have Foundation problems it's like man I I I I knew I shouldn't have had a king California King bed it ruined my Foundation no it's probably not the weight of the bed and how much you weigh even though it's a pretty good argument right but it's something was wrong in the design wasn't made to support this kind of weight it wasn't made to support uh uh um it wasn't it wasn't built correctly you the vote was to continue and I know I'm getting really close to an hour or do you start counting as soon as I get up here while we're singing like am I as I'm singing are you like you're on the clock brother Aaron because if I was a lawyer that's exactly what I would do the phone's ringing I see the caller ID I go and I wait as long as I can because the clock's already started right and then I answer and then I act like I don't know who it is right for a few minutes like oh yes yes yes that's right and they ask what's that clicking noise in the background like don't think about it I don't really have any clients that pay me by the I wish there was a magic time clock so Luke 6: 46- 48 so if you didn't start when I got up here I have not yet quite preached an hour because I think I was right around 10:41 when I officially began to preach some may argue I still haven't started yet thank you Luke 6: 46 to 48 here's the a different rendering of this very passage and why call ye Lord Lord and do not the things which I say and rebut like well we cast out Devils he's like well that's not what I'm talking about we prophesy on your name well that's not what I'm talking about we do many wonderful works and Powerful works well that's not what I'm talking about I've been doing a personal study on some things and I've and it's just amazing uh of how much Christianity's become about church it's like just because it has a CH in it doesn't mean we got to make it all about church it's churchianity anymore right and it's all about church and it's the the health of the church which is important and and the health of the body is as far as a local body and it almost in a way asks the individual to sacrifice their own spiritual leadership in their lives and their own spiritual health for the health of the church thinking that if the church is healthy then everybody else is healthy but that's the that's the Mirage and and so this is I if I can say this the things that Jesus is rebuking and saying that's not enough can make a really good church can make a real powerful looking church but that's not what he's talking about says whosoever cometh to me and heareth my says and doeth him I will show you to whom he is like he is like a man which built an house and then what does he do and digs deep he dug deep and laid the foundation on a rock so it wasn't that he just found a rock and began to build but he he did the right thing in as a far as an engineer he did the right thing in terms of uh uh premeditating the structure he found Bedrock he found Solid Ground and then he he tethered the foundation upon which the structure would be built to that so it was Stone upon stone rock upon Rock maybe even to where he's drilling he's digging in he's chipping in he's allowing it to go in a way where it's anchored to the Rock not just even put upon a rock it wasn't just a tent spread out on a rock this is a firm foundation built upon a rock he dug deep what did Brother bam say was the problem in the indictment they don't dig down deep enough to get in the spirit of the Revelation what did Jesus say in what the parable that the word is sown but they have no deepness of Earth the word is not getting deep enough to that Bedrock of faith and Revelation they didn't dig down deep enough but the wise man digs deep he looks at it he considers it he gets beneath the surface he can appreciate the foundation and then the flood arose and the stream beat vehemently I love just how much more descriptive the the the flood arose the stream beat against it in this way it's almost as if it's just a torrent that comes from the earth beats against that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock to say that he dug deep it means he had to search for Bedrock he didn't just find a rock and build on it he dug for it he said I'm not just going to build in a place that's convenient I'm going to dig for it I'm not just going to take it for its surface meaning I'm not just going to take it for how it presents I want to understand I want to know it I want to dig into it I want to get Dusty with it it implies searching for that Bedrock digging for that stone chipping away at it so that it can make a foundation I mean I've in all the traveling we've done I don't think I've ever just found a slab in nature like wow this should make a perfect 2700t house and the Footers are already there and it's just just build on it there would be a if it was on a rock it even implies maybe a rock face and a Rocky outcropping and he'd have to level it chip away at it he knew he had good rock but he had to work let me just say this it's easier just to kind of find level ground and start building it's easier just to kind of find a spot well this looks good and just throw it up but it's harder to dig deep and find bedrock it's harder to pray about it it's harder to dig into it call upon God get in the spirit of the revelation of it it's easier just to have no forethought or effort in the beginning to guard against what may come well build there there's plenty of room it's got a great view just build there that's flat this will work kind of even we could kind of rake this out we can just kind of smooth it out go ahead and just build there and there's no thought about the future and there's no effort in the beginning to prepare for what may come Proverbs 223 and4 a prudent man foresee the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and that's not simple in a positive way just someone who cannot appreciate Truth The Prudent foresees the evil and hides himself the simple pass on and are punished I hope you can begin to kind of see this theme of how that the foolish can have a lot of revenues but it's trouble there is this concept of foolishness that leads to rule ruin foolish that leads to failure foolishness that leads to a fall but there's wisdom that leads to standing and being upheld a prudent man foresees the wise anticipates he realizes beforehand he expects and then he's ahead of time amen he's doing it he he's getting it before it happens but the evil hides himself or the evil uh cannot hide himself and so he's punished so by humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor in life do you see that through wisdom the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom through humility and the fear of the Lord are riches honor and life if you want to have riches honor in life then fear God keep his Commandments humble yourself to his precepts do what he says to do for therein is riches honor and life if you want riches honor honor his word fear Him keep his Commandments you want honor honor the Lord respect him serve him do what he says you want life listen the thing that people want more than anything now is to live to have honor and to have riches and the only place it can be found is in humility in the fear of the Lord the wise anticipate and therefore they prepare brother Brandman the sermon glorified Jesus say that's where God's Church God's built his church every time what on the solid rock on Revelation he says it's the only place he can build it it was upon the spiritual revealed truth of God job had it right when he that lightning Flash and he h the Revelation his Redeemer lived he says I want you to notice every man that ever has the spiritual revealed truth of the will of God makes preparation for the fulfilling I hope that goes down deep tonight way down on the fifth rib on the left side hope it goes down deep notice if it's ever revealed to you that God's going to heal you you just get ready for it that's all amen spiritual revealed truth it's it's demonstrated in the dramatization of Abraham buying all the things he would need for a baby it's demonstrated in Noah in actually building the ark God tells them rain's going to Water's going to fall from the sky and he's not watching for rain clouds to get into action he builds it he builds that Ark he does it there's this anticipation of the spiritually revealed truth of God puts you in action if I could dramatize it this way if one of you only had one foot and and you had bought shoes your whole life and always threw away the other one and God revealed to you that he was going to give you another foot you'd keep the other pair the next time you bought shoes right you you wouldn't you wouldn't throw it away you'd like oh the foot's coming I'm just thinking of the image of a shoe that's been worn for like 10 years and God gives you your foot one morning so you put on the other Air Jordan right and like one is perfect and pristine collectible the other one's been W for 10 years but what a testimony you those new shoes know it's a new foot in Isaiah chapter 59: 19 because he says every man that has a spiritually revealed truth makes preparation for the fulfilling now let's think of that in terms of anticipating and being prudent there's things that God says if you do you'll be blessed in and there's things that he warns us about this is why houses fall there's something we can draw from this I've just got to my hour let me hurry so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun this is what I want you to look at when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him this is us being forewarned the word time and time again tells us if you do this this is going to happen if you don't do this this is going to happen regardless of what you do this is what's happening there's things that we could take from the word of God to know these are Bedrock these are principles these things are truth and as Jesus said the flood came and beat upon that house but it could not shake it because it was founded in the beginning it was built upon something that could withstand the flood it was designed anticipating the flood it was designed anticipating of the Winds it was designed and built in such a way that it would withstand the trials to come later on and when the the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Bible is telling us that the storms of persecution the storms of Temptation the storms of disappointment will try the house will beat against the house it'll beat against you it'll beat against your family it'll beat against the church it will come Peter says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour we have been forewarned amen and so in light of the fact that we have an enemy who is like a lion presenting as a lion and even his ministers as angels of light because we have that enemy he says be alert and be calm amen that's what sober means he tells us to be sober and Vigilant so there's got to be this soberness to where you can appreciate it's kind of like they're saying that a fifth of whiskey will uh significantly reduce the awareness of a heart attack and so it's not that we want to see problems coming so we intoxicate ourselves so that we're not fearful like oh my goodness I just can't handle this give me some tranquilizers or I want to go take a nap or I want to just pop some pills to settle my heart down to be sober is to be able to see something to be alert and to remain calm in the face of it not be like I believe there's a lion after me the devil's after me every day oh my goodness what are we gonna do right but it's like yeah there's a devil he's real and I'm going to be calm and I'm going to be vigilant which means to be at watch less through your laziness or indifference ruin comes to be alert I know it's coming I know there's winds coming I know there's storms coming I know there's rains coming and I'm going to be vigilant in other words I'm going to do what I need to do to prepare for the storm I'm going to do what I need to do for when the lion the the the as a lion comes I'm gonna do it now the storm wants to wear on you wants to push on you wants to push you into failure it it it wants to impose itself on the horizon I'm coming to get you and then he wants you to begin to think oh whoa I don't know if he can survive this I don't know if we can get through this I don't know what's going to happen and then once it comes you say well just stand stand sure stand where you are stay where you are the trouble's the Lion's coming I see him I see the devil coming I see the devil coming just stay where you are stay where you are and then he begins to beat on the house and everything begins to shake he wants you to panic he wants to be like oh I don't know I don't I don't know if I can trust I don't know what are we going to do what are we going to do what are we going to do that's what he wants to do the storm wants to wear on you and then push you into a panic push you into failure it's an influence uh brother Michael jenin shared this quote last week it's just so powerful I just felt it fit perfectly here in the sermon a hidden life in Christ just think of that image that being hidden in him them days he dwelt in his tab Tabernacle and today he dwells in you as his Tabernacle but we must make this place a dwelling not an outer Court place or the first holy place but we must live with God in the holiest of holies a consecrated hidden life alone quiet with God soberness but yet vigil uh sober yet Vigilant he says we become too excited upset about too many things and the way that it struck me is we get really excited and happy about things and we get really disappointed and discouraged about things and he says we get too excited about some things too disappointed because of other things no we're not sober we're being intoxicated oh things are great things are awesome any wonderful any good and then next thing you know I just don't even know I don't don't even know I'm don't even know anymore and it's like woo woo we get too excited we're up and we're down we're up and we're down he says we get too excited and too upset about too many things we're letting the storms influence us we're letting the the lack of clouds on the horizon like all right I think we're good here I think we're good we can do this all right relax let's enjoy ourselves this is good everything's wonderful 65 degrees today it's not going to get hot this year this is great right and you don't ever have the AC checked you don't make sure your air conditioner is working like we just open the windows in Phoenix right year round and there's no care concern and then next week when it's 95 it's like what are we going to do what are we going to do who's the brother of the church that does AC I came up with an awesome business name ACDC okay all right we get too excited or upset about too many things it shows there's something lacking notice how he says it it shows there's something lacking he says the church ought to be a million miles up the road to what it is now we're still back down in the Adolescent age fussing fighting quarreling stewing right it's whatever's in the moment when we ought to be consecrated hidden away in the holiest of holies with God to me this is one of the most practical things we could take away from this morning is that why do houses fail because we're influenced by the moment that whatever's taking place at the time becomes what we lean into and what we experience in what dictates our mood instead of knowing honey we put in the work we trained up our children in the way that they should go this is the time we trust him this is the time that we look back and know we did all that we could do to be excited the strong feelings of enthusiasm to get hyped up eager have some increased energy then all of a sudden you're upset you're disappointed you're drained you're worried you're sad you're unhappy what does it mean you're not resting on the foundation you're not hid away in the holiest of holies you're still in some other court that's influenced by the elements either dependent on natural light or human man-made light or sunlight you're still caught in these other Realms and you're not certain or sure about where you're living am and what you need is revelation what you need is trust if I can say this I I I I to finish this before noon if I can I don't know if I'll be able to but I want to really go fast building your house on a rock is doing what's right in the moment you're living doing what's right right now she just well it's kind of late I haven't been taken this serious I was raising the message got married in the message I believe it I'm not going anywhere this is what I do this is what I this this is me and you realize wow I haven't really fully I don't even listen to the message you know I but I believe it you when it's quoted I just assume it's he said it right and you just and all of a sudden you realize oh no I'm so many years down the road I haven't done anything well okay you have no Foundation right start to build the right foundation is to do today what you know you ought to do it's the lack of indifference it's not being lazy it's casting out fear we can we can secure peace look at Isaiah 32 we can secure peace and safety right now by doing what God's word says we should do and Isaiah 32 verses 17 and 18 in the work of righteousness shall be peace see how it connects back into the wonderful Works versus the righteous works of God the works of righteousness shall be peace when you do what God says there's peace in it it shall be peace that's why we hear the saying that I'm better off over in a war Tor land in a disease infested land I'm better off being somewhere where the economics aren't as good being in his perfect will than I am behind the most secure walls with the greatest food and the best amenities out of his will because the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and Assurance forever I don't want to just have this dunamis and this power and wonderful works but I want to have righteousness so I can have peace and then the effect of righteousness is this quietness and Assurance forever amen and my people shall dwell in Peaceable habit Peaceable habitation and in sure dwellings and in quiet resting places to me the very works of righteousness are the same as the works of the wise Builder the one who built his house upon a rock was dwelling in a sure place a Peaceable habitation a sure dwelling it was a quiet resting place the the house had become a home just because he had a home didn't make the world not the world just because he had had a place that he could retire doesn't mean the storms weren't raging on the outside the work of righteousness is to give you peace in your dwelling I'll say this I'm going to use a term that I want to build on Wednesday night but being prudent Provident or proactive gives us Assurance when the storms come but I want to I want to close with just a I have a few more things here I may may save some of it I may save some of it for another time but I want to read this statement was from a a minister in England who made this comment about this was his his sermon or his commentary in the 1800s he died just before brother Brandon was born I believe and as the winds come he said the we read how the winds beat vehemently in this one place the stream beats vehemently he phrased it this way because I'm wanting us to have this assurance if you if you're on a foundation what make what cause it will make a house to stand is to be sure about what you're built on if in the moment that things happen you're uncertain that's when you're going to move even if you're even if you've got Bedrock if you're uncertain or sure of your foundation that's when you begin to WAND a little bit that's when you begin to move that's when you begin to get a little bit worried but if you you have the right foundation there's an assurance and this is such a beautiful thought he says but what can the hurricane do what can the winds do what will the floods of the rain do but he says what can the hurricane do just what the elements do in nature whatever they do not break they consolidate your trials will only consolidate they will consolidate your principles your affections your hopes they will make you on the Rock yourself a rock oh I hope you can hear what I saying don't fear the hurricane thank God if you're on a rock the way it'll only it won't destroy you or separate you it'll consolidate you amen it it will consolidate your faith your conviction there's nothing like oppressing iness to turn coal into a diamond there's nothing like the press to make you sure that your roots are going down deep that's right it'll make you on the Rock yourself a rock judgments may fall from above like the descending rain disappointments afflictions persecutions May swell around you like Roy rolling floods Temptations May Buffet you all the Myster with all the mysteriousness of the invisible wind oh love that beautiful poetry judgments like rain persecutions like floods ATT Temptations like a mysterious wind yet Luke says they could not shake it the strength of the Rock is in the believer he passes all his troubles onto his rock hallelujah that's the concept in the engineering that's the concept of trusses and beams that's the con the the concept of building correctly it's going to pass it all down to the foundation the strength of the Rock is in the believer he passes all his troubles onto his Rock and from his Rock he draws his strength and the Eternal unchangeableness of the foundation makes the poorest weakest stone that has once fastened to it unshaken and impregnable as the stone of Jehovah amen when you're built upon a rock then you pass all your troubles to the Rock The Rains beat upon it you stand because it reverberates the winds the waves the floods and it's passing all the energy to the Rock to the Rock to the Rock and you yourself who's planted on the Rock become a rock yourself am consolidates your faith it consolidates your principles that's what ought to be happening in a time of pressure and trouble if you're founded on a rock you don't say this isn't the time to get slack this is the time to get firm this isn't the time to panic this isn't the time to get shaken this isn't the time to worry this is the time to stand so it makes you double down on your faith it makes you dig in more to the word of God it makes you more Vigilant to apply the token that's what happens houses fall when they're not built on the right foundation the fall of this house was when the Builder wasn't sure of his foundation didn't make sure of his foundation was not proactive as what we're expressing the Bible says as the worldwind passes so is the wicked no more but the righteous is an everlasting Foundation we can trust in our foundation if you're not trusting isn't that where you should be prayed is that where isn't that where you should be digging down deep Brothers if you could come to your instruments I I I am just going to skip some things we'll hold it over to Wednesday night but let me close with this statement I think it's also from the same Minister I I just remember reading it and copy and pased it in my in my my memory here I think it's come from the same person in a different context different commentary on a different scripture a different sermon actually and I I I want you to just take this into your hearts I want to encourage you as we close this I think there's been a lot of practical things that we could begin to draw from that why houses fall is either because of a lack of a foundation or an A a trust and a security in the foundation and as we look at that in a very practical way like how does that look what does that look like brother that I got a good foundation and I'm trusting the foundation in other words you're living by principles you're living by conviction you're living by faith and you have a revelation of what the will of the Lord is and so you're using this spiritual insight and discernment to look at situations in your life and knowing these are things that God ask us to do and in doing it there's righteousness there's reward there's benefit there's protection there's security there's peace very real things that come and the reason why our house loses its peace it loses its stability the reason why we have uh separations in our marriages and difficulty with our children the reason why the world swims into our house and begins to infect our entertainments begins to infect our family time and the family's scattered and we're not together anymore and we're not going to church anymore the reason why we're infected in our homes and discouraged and despondent and all those things is because of what we failed to do befor amen it's not living in the uh the life of God and living in power living in Victory and everything's great and you've done everything you should do everything you do and you built for this time you built for this moment you built your house upon a rock you built it by Revelation you're living by faith and then one day you just open up the door and the floods come up and just wipe you away and and it's over you might be able to go back in your life and say I can go back to around this time in this time when the work wasn't done but I want to encourage you this way because there's a reason why the house is shaken so then you just you just fix the problem right you come back to your Bedrock you get the Revelation that this is this is the word of God and this is a statement I'd like to end on it says the reign of Temptation May descend upon him with great violence and force upon the one who built his house upon a rock every person's life is a house your testimony and your character is the building of a legacy which is upon that rock therefore you must be born again first there's no spiritual success outside of the new birth experience the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that becomes your bedrock and then as a husband and wife in a home in your marriage that's your Bedrock you both have that same experience are you you should and then as you begin to build your home it comes back to that it comes back to Christ on Christ's Solid Rock we stand as a family this is the what the guiding principles of our family life and those things it comes back to this is what we're building upon so the reign of Temptation May descend upon you you as an individual you as a family even us as a church with great violence and force but shall not beat us down he says shall not beat him down he shall be made able to Bear the whole force of it the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against him the floods of persecution may be cast after him but shall not carry him away the stream of corruption may run strong against him yet shall not overset him and the wind of diverse and strange doctrines May blow hard upon him but not cast him down listen some damage he may receive by these several things but shall not be Resto destroyed he may be shaken by them but not so as to be removed off of the foundation on which he has laid yay he may fall from some degree of steadfastness of his faith but not so as to fail totally and finally the reason is because he is founded upon the rock Christ Jesus who is sure and immovable whence it appears that such a man acts the wise and prudent part it may be truly called A wise man this ought to be our confidence going forward I believe it has been our confidence but a reminder today I'm built upon a rock and there may be some who look in our lives and realize I've fallen from steadfast some steadfastness I've let the circums of Life dictate my righteousness and dictate my conviction and my uh uh my attitude towards the word of God and my uh uh discipline and serving the lord and doing all the things that I know I ought to do go back to like those six basic foundational principles of Christian Living the things that we know we ought to do and all the specifics of it we can say man I I've got a little bit cold I've dabbled a little bit in the world I I am not going to say to you you're not a Christian I'm not going to say to you you've never been anywhere to begin with what I'm saying is if you're founded upon a rock if you've got that get back down on the Bedrock because though you may suffer some damage you will not be destroyed though you may feel that the house shakes at times it cannot be removed from the foundation you may fall from some steadfastness but you will not fail totally and finally you will get back up again the reason is because you're founded on Christ Jesus The Rock The Eternal unchangeableness of your foundation makes you a poor and weak Stone unshakable and impregnable just as much as God's Throne why houses fall we'll pick up on part two on Wednesday but it's rooted in these very concepts of Faith righteousness which was by faith and all the Optics and pretense of religion or the succumbing to The Winds of the world and what we need be is proactive the wisdom is to see ahead of time that God's provided he will with the Temptation make a way of Escape does it say you won't be tempted the rains will fall the floods will come the winds will blow it will beat vehemently the enemy will enemy will come in like a flood but the spirit of the Lord will lift up the standard against it the stand together today
