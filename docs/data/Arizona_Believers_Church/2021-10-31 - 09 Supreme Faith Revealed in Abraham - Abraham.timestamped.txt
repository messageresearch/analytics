[0:00] genesis chapter 11 let's start with
[0:02] verse 1 and then i'm going to skip down
[0:05] towards chapter 12 or maybe just skip to
[0:07] chapter 12.
[0:09] and then
[0:10] want to draw heavily from these verses
[0:12] at the outset but with save some time by
[0:14] not having to go back and read them
[0:16] but i want to read them now together it
[0:18] says and the whole earth was one of one
[0:20] language and of one speech and it came
[0:22] to pass as they journeyed from the east
[0:24] that they found a plane in the land of
[0:26] shinar and they dwelt there and they
[0:28] said one to another go two let us make
[0:31] brick and burn them thoroughly and they
[0:33] had brick for stone and slime had they
[0:35] for mortar and they said go to let us
[0:38] build us a city and a tower whose top
[0:41] may reach unto heaven and let us make us
[0:44] a name lest we be scattered abroad upon
[0:46] the face of the whole earth
[0:48] and the lord came down to see the city
[0:50] and the tower which the children of men
[0:51] builded and the lord said behold the
[0:53] people is one and they have all one
[0:55] language and this they begin to do and
[0:58] now nothing will be restrained from them
[1:00] which they have imagined to do
[1:02] go to let us go down and there confound
[1:04] their language that they may not
[1:05] understand one another's speech
[1:08] so the lord scattered them abroad from
[1:09] fence upon the face of all the earth
[1:12] face of all the earth and they left off
[1:14] to build the city therefore is the name
[1:16] of it called babel because the lord did
[1:18] there confound the language of all the
[1:20] earth and from thence did the lord
[1:22] scatter them abroad upon the face of all
[1:24] the earth the next several verses
[1:27] a dozen or so verses verses 10 to 26 are
[1:30] giving the lineage
[1:32] of
[1:33] until of shem
[1:34] to abram
[1:36] and then verses 27 to 32 talk about the
[1:39] movements of abram early in his life but
[1:41] then i want to look at chapter 12 the
[1:43] first three verses genesis chapter 12
[1:45] verses 1 to 3 as a contrast to those
[1:48] first nine verses in genesis chapter 11.
[1:51] now the lord had said unto abram get
[1:53] thee out of thy country and from thy
[1:55] kindred and from thy father's house unto
[1:58] a land that i will show thee and i will
[2:00] make of thee a great nation and i will
[2:02] bless thee and make thy name great and
[2:03] thou shalt be a blessing and i will
[2:05] bless them that bless thee and curse him
[2:07] that curseth thee and in thee shall all
[2:10] families of the earth be blessed amen
[2:13] you can be seated
[2:17] we continue on the subject of supreme
[2:19] faith
[2:20] revealed in abraham
[2:22] and one thing that we're kind of zeroing
[2:24] in on our is how the details in
[2:27] abraham's life
[2:29] uh reveal important characteristics to
[2:31] help us to relate to the faith of
[2:33] abraham and we take abraham's faith out
[2:35] of context and we make it this
[2:37] it is a mighty faith it's a supernatural
[2:39] faith but we can almost make it an idol
[2:41] as instead of a role model or something
[2:43] that we feel that we can follow behind
[2:45] and have ourselves
[2:46] one thing we're trying to identify in
[2:48] particular is how that abraham is used
[2:51] to portray the plan of god so when god
[2:54] calls abraham he has something he wants
[2:56] to accomplish in his life for abraham
[2:59] himself so there's something that's
[3:02] important to abraham something that god
[3:04] is accomplishing in abraham's life but
[3:07] he's also wanting to portray something
[3:09] in the movements and the actions and the
[3:10] work of god in his life
[3:12] and so it's important to it would be
[3:15] important to understand abraham
[3:16] historically it'd be important to
[3:18] understand his life in his in terms of
[3:20] him being memorialized in scripture but
[3:23] because he's used to express something
[3:25] to us the specifics in his life hold
[3:28] very great importance to us who are of
[3:30] that same faith
[3:32] and in abraham's grace covenant this is
[3:34] kind of a key
[3:35] statement that we're drawing from it
[3:37] says what is he doing he's identifying
[3:39] an event in abraham's life where god is
[3:41] visiting him and he said he's showing to
[3:44] abraham this what he's going to do to
[3:47] abraham's seed
[3:48] so there's something that god is
[3:50] accomplishing in the moment in the in
[3:52] the chapter genesis chapter 18 uh 17
[3:55] wherever it may be god's doing something
[3:56] in the moment
[3:58] but what he's doing at that time is also
[4:00] expressing something to us so that we
[4:02] know the way that god dealt with abraham
[4:05] to bring him to
[4:06] a perfect faith and that supreme faith
[4:08] on mount moriah god also will do to his
[4:11] seed
[4:13] and so as we look at these verses that
[4:15] we read today
[4:17] and we looked at we began in chapter 11
[4:20] the bible shares specific details in
[4:22] order to give the proper context to his
[4:24] faith so it's going to give us details
[4:27] that help us to give context to his
[4:29] faith that the bible is sharing details
[4:31] it's not um there's there's really no
[4:33] fluff in this it's provided to us and
[4:35] given to us in such a way to where it
[4:37] gives context to abraham's faith it
[4:39] helps us to identify a pattern of god in
[4:42] abraham's life and then even the process
[4:45] that god is putting abraham through to
[4:47] bring him to a perfect faith
[4:49] and so as is if we even begin went back
[4:51] to genesis chapter one you say well we
[4:53] know why that's there and we know why
[4:55] this is there let's just remind
[4:56] ourselves that genesis chapter 1 and
[4:58] each proceeding verse all the way up to
[5:01] chapter 11 is not fluff
[5:03] god's just not kind of putting it in
[5:04] there as a preamble that doesn't really
[5:06] matter these things are all very very
[5:08] specific they're in there for very
[5:10] specific purposes because even from
[5:12] genesis chapter 1 to genesis chapter 11
[5:15] god is laying the foundation for
[5:17] election
[5:18] and he's laying the the uh the
[5:20] foundation for election by grace he's
[5:22] laying the foundation for salvation by
[5:24] faith
[5:25] so these first 11 chapters that we could
[5:27] read from and there's been a lot that
[5:29] i've been drawing from personally as
[5:31] i've been preparing for these services
[5:33] in the earlier chapters of the bible
[5:34] genesis 1 genesis chapter 3
[5:37] to understand what god is to give
[5:39] context and meaning to what he does when
[5:42] he calls abraham
[5:44] now
[5:45] we didn't read the verses but the end of
[5:47] chapter 11
[5:49] as it gets to the generations of terror
[5:52] and how terror begat abram and then it
[5:54] says that they went they took wives and
[5:56] they married and then they details their
[5:58] movements
[5:59] the end of chapter 11 introduces us to
[6:02] abraham
[6:03] and his extended family his father his
[6:05] brothers his nephews
[6:07] their wives his own wife and it tells us
[6:09] that they moved out of her
[6:12] and so this is we're introduced to
[6:13] abraham a little bit of his family and
[6:15] then we're told immediately that he's
[6:16] moving
[6:17] but understanding the beginning of
[6:19] chapter 11. not just zero in and on
[6:21] those last few verses of chapter 11 but
[6:23] the beginning
[6:24] understanding the beginning of chapter
[6:26] 11 helps us to fully grasp abraham's
[6:29] calling and the reasons for his movement
[6:31] and a lot of this is going to be
[6:33] reviewed from wednesday night but i just
[6:34] feel very compelled
[6:36] to go back over these and i feel like
[6:38] i'm going really fast this morning maybe
[6:40] faster than normal
[6:41] but it's just because i feel very
[6:43] pressed to get to something in
[6:44] particular but there's a way that i have
[6:46] to take to get there so i appreciate
[6:48] your patience
[6:49] and your and your pull on the word of
[6:51] god
[6:52] so as we read in genesis chapter 11
[6:54] verses 1 to 9
[6:56] we see what we call with the story of
[6:57] the tower of babylon and in looking at
[7:00] the tower babel it gives us some
[7:01] background to what they're thinking and
[7:02] what their motives and objectives were
[7:04] so we understand the character of the
[7:05] people and then based upon their action
[7:08] there's a response from god they do
[7:10] something and god is responding to what
[7:12] they do
[7:13] and we read how they say let us build us
[7:16] and in saying let us build us that was
[7:18] self-reliance we're going to do this
[7:19] ourselves this is something we want to
[7:21] accomplish on our own so there's this
[7:23] self-reliance at the beginning of
[7:25] genesis chapter 11. and then they say
[7:27] let us make us a name and so their
[7:30] self-ambition this is about making their
[7:32] name great and making themselves to be
[7:34] remembered
[7:35] and then they are doing this so that
[7:37] lest we be scattered over the face of
[7:39] all the earth and so there's a
[7:40] self-protection that's in there
[7:42] self-preservation so you begin to
[7:44] recognize how this is all centered
[7:46] around self
[7:48] in a way of what i can do self-reliance
[7:50] and self-ambition and self-preservation
[7:54] and then it says lest we be scattered
[7:55] upon the the face of the whole earth
[7:58] and there's a number of scriptures we
[7:59] could look at and and i'll just even
[8:01] skip in action chapter 17 verse 26 it
[8:04] even speaks how by one blood we've been
[8:06] made to spread over all the earth that
[8:08] would be the blood that came off the ark
[8:10] uh the blood of noah um it's it's his
[8:12] sons and their wives it kind of
[8:14] represents this mingled blood this mixed
[8:16] blood that comes forth from off the ark
[8:18] and it's caused all mankind to spread
[8:20] out upon the face of the earth and it's
[8:22] god has determined the bounds of their
[8:24] habitation lords god wanted them to be
[8:27] spread out over all the earth and that
[8:29] god wanted them to have a certain
[8:30] habitation and to fill up the earth and
[8:33] to to subdue it and to spread out not
[8:36] just to live in one place but to spread
[8:38] out and so when they didn't want to be
[8:40] scattered over the earth it was
[8:41] rebellion against god's word
[8:43] and these are important things to kind
[8:44] of recognize this self-reliance
[8:46] self-ambition self-preservation and then
[8:48] this rebellion against god's word
[8:51] and they're saying let us build us a
[8:53] city
[8:54] and a tower they're doing this to
[8:56] prevent the separation we don't want to
[8:58] be scattered or we don't want to be
[8:59] separated so there's a forced unity
[9:01] that's taking place this is where you
[9:03] belong this is where you're supposed to
[9:04] be we're not supposed to go out from
[9:06] here let's stay in this one area
[9:08] or stay right here
[9:10] in this city and in this tower
[9:12] and we mentioned it wednesday night and
[9:13] i think it just it really behooves us to
[9:16] ponder it
[9:17] to a great extent is when they begin to
[9:19] build a city and a tower they were
[9:21] wanting to make the entity you could
[9:23] call it the state the government the
[9:24] church whatever look at the organization
[9:26] of the entity greater than the
[9:28] individual leadership of god in a
[9:29] person's life they're making that
[9:31] greater than the individual and they
[9:33] want the individual to sacrifice their
[9:36] liberty and sacrifice the leadership of
[9:38] god sacrifice their obedience to god to
[9:40] make the name of the city great
[9:43] and a city that's a place that's a
[9:45] guarded city it speaks of something
[9:47] being guarded set up with the watch and
[9:48] so there's protection there and let us
[9:50] build us a city to protect ourselves
[9:53] a tower has a very interesting meaning
[9:55] it's an elevated stage it's a raised a
[9:58] raised bed or pulpit so they wanted to
[10:00] build something that would be raised up
[10:02] it means to that word comes from to grow
[10:04] or to become important to become great
[10:06] to promote or to make powerful they
[10:08] wanted this to have the preeminence
[10:10] among mankind
[10:11] they wanted this to be the the thing
[10:13] that everyone looked to and everyone
[10:15] remembered and this is our legacy and
[10:17] this is what we have built and as you
[10:19] read these descriptions of self-reliance
[10:21] and self-ambition and self-preservation
[10:24] and let us make ourselves great and
[10:25] let's watch after ourselves and protect
[10:27] ourselves and build this great monument
[10:30] it's that it speaks of the same attitude
[10:32] that exists today in laodicea
[10:35] the same things we read in revelations
[10:36] chapter 3 of being rich and increased
[10:38] with good and goods and having
[10:40] everything they need and not needing
[10:41] anything it's the same attitude we find
[10:43] in genesis chapter 11.
[10:45] and they're building a city and a tower
[10:47] whose top may reach under heaven this is
[10:49] a monument of pride and pretense
[10:52] and notice i want you to think of this
[10:53] language because we're going to find
[10:55] similar expressions later in the word of
[10:57] god today how
[10:59] they wanted to
[11:00] reach unto heaven they wanted to build
[11:03] this uh this thing that would make them
[11:05] great and important it's a monument of
[11:07] pride and they're doing it to arrogantly
[11:09] and pridefully avoid god's judgment
[11:11] why they had it very recent in their
[11:13] memory and even with sham being alive
[11:15] during this time they would have known
[11:16] about the flood it was very
[11:18] right there in their memory and their in
[11:20] their mindset in the same way that maybe
[11:22] to us we think about that we hear of the
[11:24] great depression and though we may not
[11:26] have lived in it we know those who have
[11:28] and it's something that's very prominent
[11:29] in our history and our oral storytelling
[11:31] and we know about this and maybe we'd
[11:33] want to do things to avoid it well they
[11:35] knew about the flood that covered the
[11:36] whole earth they thought if we can build
[11:38] a tower high enough if god wants to
[11:40] judge us again we can avoid his
[11:42] judgments so there's a lot of arrogance
[11:44] involved in this
[11:46] it's rebellion against god's people
[11:48] now genesis chapter 11 verses 5 to 9
[11:52] the lord comes down to see what they're
[11:54] doing and sees the city that they build
[11:56] and he responds to the pride and the
[11:58] ambition of the people
[12:00] and he does so as the scripture says by
[12:02] confounding their language which means
[12:04] to mix or mingle by sowing
[12:06] to confound it means to confuse
[12:08] and he does this specifically that they
[12:10] may not understand one another
[12:12] so here are people who are rebelling
[12:14] they're self-ambitious they're they're
[12:16] preserving themselves they want to
[12:17] present prevent separation they're doing
[12:19] all these things arrogantly and
[12:21] pridefully and they're they're falling
[12:23] they're following a wicked way in a
[12:24] wicked path and instead of god coming
[12:27] down saying hey guys stop
[12:30] he actually confounds their languages
[12:32] and causes a misunderstanding and causes
[12:34] confusion to accomplish his will that
[12:37] they would spread out over the earth
[12:39] and he causes this misunderstanding god
[12:41] broke them apart god caused confusion by
[12:44] confounding their language they're no
[12:45] longer able to communicate communicate
[12:47] with one another and then this spreads
[12:50] in that over the earth according to the
[12:51] plan of god so now they're spread out
[12:53] like god wanted them to spread out
[12:55] and the bible tells us that this city
[12:57] and this tower is called babel
[13:00] if you were to look it up in other
[13:02] translations
[13:03] i think they stayed very faithful to
[13:05] this expression of babel because it it
[13:07] holds the that's the most common term we
[13:09] hear the tower of babel but it's the
[13:11] same word that's also translated to
[13:13] babylon
[13:14] so very well could have been translated
[13:16] to a city in a tower called and they
[13:17] called the tower they call this place
[13:19] babylon it's in the plain of shine or
[13:21] it's in chaldea it's a very specific
[13:24] place where they erected this tower and
[13:25] they built this city and we could have
[13:27] very easily called it babylon
[13:30] now in genesis chapter 12 and i
[13:32] appreciate you being patient with me
[13:35] and i i i have great comfort knowing
[13:37] that just about all of you have heard me
[13:38] preach before so if you've heard me
[13:40] preach once you've got some idea how
[13:42] long it takes me to make my point
[13:44] and uh and i know it can be very
[13:47] very difficult difficult to to like wait
[13:51] through it all but just remember there's
[13:52] a picnic afterwards
[13:54] and we want to get there so pull me
[13:56] through it so we can get there
[13:58] so in genesis chapter 12 verses 1-3
[14:01] now god
[14:02] having just in the prior chapter visited
[14:05] uh babel
[14:06] the lord visits abraham and he visits
[14:08] him in ur the same place
[14:10] in the same region in a city in southern
[14:12] babylonia he visits him in ur
[14:14] and there's a lot of details about this
[14:16] city they're very interesting it was a
[14:18] center of moon worship it was a very
[14:19] thriving city a very large city
[14:22] and what god begins to do is he deals
[14:24] differently with abraham than he had
[14:26] with abraham's ancestors
[14:29] he is
[14:31] and what god is wanting to do
[14:33] is distinguish
[14:36] his plan his will and his work from the
[14:39] plan of man
[14:41] because a man could have built this
[14:42] tower and done something great and
[14:43] people could have marveled that says
[14:44] isn't it wonderful what god has done and
[14:46] how he's restored mankind and post flood
[14:48] he's allowed them to build this great
[14:50] civilization this great beautiful city
[14:52] and he's allowed them to build this
[14:53] great tower that they'll never be killed
[14:55] by a flood again
[14:56] and and however you'd want to spin it
[14:58] there'd be a way that people could have
[15:00] looked at that and thought that this was
[15:02] the blessings of god because how
[15:04] beautiful it was and how great it was
[15:05] but god calls abram in his simplicity
[15:08] and in his
[15:09] alone as a man just calling him he does
[15:11] it to distinguish between the work of
[15:13] man and the plan of god or god's will
[15:15] and as he speaks to abraham now if you
[15:17] can just
[15:18] help me or just on your own make this
[15:21] connection begin to contrast we've kind
[15:24] of lifted up what babel was in babylon
[15:26] god begins to deal with abraham and his
[15:28] life is so different and it contrasts so
[15:31] differently than what's taking place in
[15:33] genesis chapter 11. he says i will make
[15:35] thee a great nation
[15:37] i will bless thee i will make thy name
[15:41] great in other words god is going to
[15:43] accomplish an abraham what his ancestors
[15:45] wanted to do on their own
[15:47] what they set out to do on their own
[15:48] what they want to do make this great
[15:50] nation make a name for themselves make a
[15:51] civilization make a city that could
[15:53] thrive and continue forever god is god
[15:56] calls abraham and we have these
[15:58] specifics in genesis 11 for this the
[16:02] specific purpose of creating contrast to
[16:05] how god deals with abraham
[16:07] like when we get to genesis 12 let's not
[16:09] change the picture let's look at the
[16:11] context of how god begins to call
[16:13] abraham and god wanted the story told to
[16:16] the tower of babel to be the contrast to
[16:18] how he begins to deal with
[16:20] abraham he says thou shalt be a blessing
[16:23] in thee shall all families of the earth
[16:26] be blessed notice the comparison to the
[16:28] people in genesis 11. he confuses them
[16:30] they he confounds them and they were
[16:32] supposed to they were wanting to build a
[16:34] great civilization that would benefit
[16:35] people and that would survive forever
[16:37] and make a name for themselves but yet
[16:39] god confounds them and curses them but
[16:41] he tells abraham you're going to be a
[16:43] blessing
[16:45] whereas they wanted to impact the world
[16:47] forever but now he said but you're going
[16:49] to be the one that's going to be a
[16:50] blessing and in thee all families of the
[16:52] earth are going to be blessed
[16:54] think of the contrast now between how
[16:57] god deals with abraham and how the
[16:59] people were thinking in genesis 11.
[17:02] and he tells him get thee out of thy
[17:03] country
[17:05] the first commandment of god to abraham
[17:07] is separation
[17:08] and notice what he's wanting to separate
[17:10] him from or we say i say notice but let
[17:12] me make this point he's wanting to
[17:14] separate him from the culture and the
[17:16] character of where he was he's in this
[17:18] mesopotamia he's in babylonia he's in
[17:21] the southern region of babylon he's in
[17:23] the city of irv the chaldees he's in
[17:25] that very place where this region where
[17:27] the city was built and this tower is
[17:29] being erected he's in a an epicenter of
[17:31] idol worship and hundreds of different
[17:33] deities and gods they said that they
[17:35] speculate that when abraham traveled
[17:37] from ur to haran that he would have
[17:39] traveled along the euphrates river in a
[17:41] common trade route and as he went he
[17:43] would have passed dozens of altars built
[17:45] to false gods
[17:47] dozens of different false gods and so
[17:49] god is wanting to separate him from that
[17:51] atmosphere from that region from that
[17:53] unbelief from that godlessness and he's
[17:55] wanting to take him away from that
[17:57] culture and that character he says unto
[17:59] a land that i will show thee
[18:02] and by doing this it creates this
[18:04] longing in abraham he believes this is
[18:06] god he's fully persuaded that god will
[18:08] fulfill his promise but god holds a
[18:10] little bit back so it creates this
[18:12] longing in abraham's heart where now
[18:14] he's a seeker for this city that god has
[18:16] promised him this land that god has
[18:17] promised
[18:19] and we were making this point this was
[18:21] our very simple point
[18:22] on
[18:23] wednesday night is that what god called
[18:26] abraham out of is very important for us
[18:28] to understand
[18:29] and it's emphasized emphasized multiple
[18:31] times in scripture what god calls
[18:33] abraham out of in genesis 15 verse 7 god
[18:36] himself says and he said unto him i am
[18:39] the lord that brought thee out of ur of
[18:41] the chaldees to give thee this land to
[18:44] inherit now we put a lot of emphasis on
[18:46] the promised land and the land that had
[18:48] been promised to abraham we put a lot of
[18:50] emphasis on the land that god brought
[18:52] abraham to and it's appropriate to put
[18:54] the emphasis on that but notice how god
[18:57] does not just say i called you to this
[18:59] land but he makes note of what he called
[19:01] him out of
[19:02] it says i called you out of ur of the
[19:04] chaldees this was something important to
[19:07] god to remind abraham of remind him what
[19:09] he brought him out of in order to bring
[19:12] the contrast to what he's bringing him
[19:13] into
[19:15] in nehemiah 9 7 then god is
[19:17] characterized this way thou art the lord
[19:19] the god
[19:20] who did us choose abraham and broadest
[19:22] him out of ur of the chaldees and gave
[19:25] him the name of abraham
[19:28] again this is the the now the people are
[19:30] repeating back to god what he has said
[19:32] you brought him out of ur the chaldees
[19:35] abraham is being identified as one who
[19:37] came from this particular region
[19:39] in acts chapter 7 verses 2 to 4 and he
[19:41] said men brethren and fathers hearken
[19:44] to the god of glory appeared unto our
[19:46] father abraham when he was in
[19:48] mesopotamia
[19:50] identifying where he was when he was
[19:52] called before he dwelt in quran and said
[19:55] unto him get thee out of thy country and
[19:57] from thy kindred and come into the land
[19:59] which i will show thee then came he out
[20:01] of the land of the chaldeans and dwelt
[20:04] in haran from thence when his father was
[20:06] dead he removed him into this land
[20:08] wherein you now dwell
[20:10] so notice this is just three scriptures
[20:12] and we could have used genesis 11 we
[20:14] could use different places where god is
[20:16] identifying where abraham is brought out
[20:18] of but abraham this very very simple
[20:21] thought of this abraham is called out of
[20:23] babylon
[20:25] it's important for us to recognize that
[20:26] abraham just wasn't picked out of just
[20:28] any random place but abraham is there in
[20:30] babylon and abraham is called out of
[20:33] babylon and in calling abraham out of
[20:34] babylon god has something he wants to do
[20:36] in abraham's life but he's laying a
[20:38] pattern for the seed of abraham
[20:41] he's showing what he will do to the
[20:42] natural seed of abraham but also what
[20:44] he's going to do in a spiritual way to
[20:46] the royal seed of abraham
[20:48] and catch that the natural seed of
[20:50] abraham are always dealt are usually
[20:52] typically most often dealt with after
[20:54] natural things
[20:56] in a natural land in natural physical
[20:58] manifestations whereas to the royal seed
[21:00] of abraham it's a spiritual promise and
[21:02] a spiritual land
[21:03] but abraham is called out of babylon
[21:05] laying the pattern for the elect brother
[21:08] ram says that israel and the church
[21:10] abraham coming from babylon with his
[21:12] father
[21:13] down into the valley of shinar where the
[21:14] souls of many journeyed after the
[21:16] destroying of babylon or the confusion
[21:18] taken place
[21:19] abraham's father parent
[21:22] brought abraham and his loved ones down
[21:24] into shinar
[21:25] in all that land among all these people
[21:27] one man found favor with god now i want
[21:30] you to notice that is the beginning of
[21:33] christianity of the church
[21:36] where did it begin when they left
[21:37] babylon when abraham leaves babylon that
[21:40] is the beginning of christianity that is
[21:42] the beginning of the church i think oh i
[21:45] thought the church began in the book of
[21:47] acts or i thought it began when christ
[21:48] came well we're going back to the
[21:50] pattern and the original and the very
[21:53] seeds that are being sown that will one
[21:54] day be jesus christ and that'll one day
[21:57] be the christian church he's saying he
[21:59] go back to when god called abraham out
[22:02] of babylon and there's the start
[22:05] what does that say to each one of us if
[22:06] we're ever going to start we've got to
[22:07] be called out you have to come out of
[22:09] sin you have to come out of darkness you
[22:10] have to come out of unbelief you have to
[22:12] come out of laodicea you have to come
[22:14] out of out of babylon you have to come
[22:15] out of
[22:16] false beliefs and false ideas that's
[22:18] where it begins
[22:21] and so abraham is called out of babylon
[22:25] now i want to amplify
[22:27] for
[22:28] for some time today the
[22:30] importance and significance of babylon
[22:34] and babylon holds a a very prominent
[22:36] place in scripture
[22:38] and in the plan of god we find that it's
[22:41] uh very large in the story of abraham
[22:43] and extremely big in the story of his
[22:46] seed
[22:47] and in genesis chapter 10 verse 10
[22:49] speaking of nimrod it says in the
[22:50] beginning of his kingdom was babble
[22:53] as we read in genesis chapter 11 this
[22:55] was a kingdom whose beginning is against
[22:57] god
[22:58] so nimrod had this motive and objective
[23:00] in establishing this kingdom and we see
[23:02] it manifesting when they build the tower
[23:04] of babylon something that is against
[23:06] uh against god now what i'm wanting to
[23:09] labor to do right now
[23:11] and i say this to kind of preface it so
[23:13] you could uh maybe i just open up and uh
[23:16] and be receptive to what i'm what i'm
[23:18] trying to share and maybe not be tense
[23:20] and trying to wonder where i'm going
[23:22] is to see what god called abraham out of
[23:26] so i'm just wanting to give more context
[23:28] to what god was wanting to do by
[23:30] separating abraham from this why does
[23:32] god have to call him out of babylon for
[23:34] these very reasons we're going to
[23:35] express here and then what god does to
[23:37] abraham he does to his seed so you
[23:39] recognize god does the same thing for
[23:41] you for the same reasons
[23:43] and so this beginning of babel or the
[23:46] beginning of babylon is against god's
[23:47] will and you'll find that the ambition
[23:49] of babel
[23:50] is in harmony with satan's ambition
[23:52] just look at satan's objective his plan
[23:55] what he wants to accomplish what he
[23:56] wants to do and you'll find that let us
[23:58] make us and we will do this and we will
[24:00] do that fits perfectly with the ambition
[24:02] of satan and isaiah chapter 14 verses 12
[24:06] to 14 our thought fallen from heaven oh
[24:08] lucifer's son of the morning
[24:10] how about cut down to the ground which
[24:12] does weaken the nations for thou hast
[24:15] said in thine heart i will ascend into
[24:17] heaven
[24:18] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[24:21] of god
[24:22] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[24:25] congregation in the sides of the north
[24:28] i will ascend above the heights of the
[24:30] cloud i will be like the most high
[24:34] it's interesting how that these
[24:35] scriptures taught me how he's brought
[24:36] into the pit and the low places even a
[24:38] dugout well a pit but what he wanted to
[24:41] do is he wanted to ascend into heaven
[24:44] exalt his throne above the stars of god
[24:47] he was looking to build a tower he was
[24:49] wanting something that would reach under
[24:50] the heavens he would want to have an
[24:52] elevated pulpit a platform a throne that
[24:54] would be extended above all everything
[24:57] else that god had created everything
[24:58] else that god expressed as his own i
[25:00] will sit upon the mount of the
[25:02] congregation the sides of the north i
[25:03] will ascend above the heights of the
[25:05] clouds i will i will i will i will i
[25:07] will be like the most high
[25:09] and this is the ambition in genesis 11.
[25:12] this is the ambition of the genesis of
[25:14] babylon this is the ambition of the
[25:15] genesis of the tower of babel in the
[25:17] city associated with it is we will we
[25:20] will we will do something great make us
[25:22] a name make us a reputation prevent
[25:25] separation bring a forced unity and
[25:27] gather here and grow here and raise and
[25:30] exalt ourselves above the creation of
[25:32] the earth
[25:33] and the one who created it
[25:35] and so satan is the architect and the
[25:37] inspiration of babylon
[25:40] and and again we're contrasting the call
[25:44] of abraham
[25:46] because in this it's satan's will it's
[25:48] satan's agenda it's an ambition to not
[25:51] fulfill the plan of god it's i will i
[25:53] will i will but when it came to abraham
[25:56] abraham really didn't have a say in it
[26:00] he said i will bless thee i will make of
[26:02] thee it wasn't abraham saying i am i am
[26:04] i will but god was saying he would do it
[26:07] let's look at some of these
[26:08] characteristics of babel and babylon
[26:11] i'm going to read a number of statements
[26:12] from the church age book chapter 5.
[26:16] brother bram says babel
[26:18] is the original name for babylon it
[26:20] means confusion
[26:22] it was literally started by cush the son
[26:23] of him
[26:24] but was brought to a kingdom of power
[26:26] and grandeur under his son nimrod the
[26:27] mighty hunter
[26:29] nimrod according to the genesis 11
[26:31] account and also according to profane
[26:33] history set out to accomplish that's
[26:36] quite the characterization of history
[26:37] right no wonder we didn't like it in
[26:39] high school right
[26:40] but according to profane history set out
[26:42] to accomplish three things he wanted to
[26:44] build a strong nation which he did
[26:47] he wanted
[26:48] to propagate his own religion which he
[26:50] did
[26:51] he wanted to make a name for himself
[26:53] which he also accomplished his
[26:55] accomplishments were so monumental that
[26:57] the kingdom of babylon was called the
[26:59] head of gold amongst all world
[27:00] governments
[27:02] so this is what this is what we see
[27:04] rising up this is what's represented in
[27:06] the tower of bible this is what's
[27:08] represented in genesis 11. this is what
[27:10] god calls abraham out of
[27:13] notice his strong nation propagate its
[27:16] religion make a name for itself because
[27:18] babylon represents the seat and power of
[27:21] satan's kingdom
[27:22] it represents satan's ambition it
[27:24] represents his power it signifies his
[27:26] the seat it signifies his throne
[27:28] everything that's related it's his tower
[27:31] so babylon is it's his city and his
[27:33] tower i don't believe i provided these
[27:35] on a slide but i'll just read these
[27:37] three other uh
[27:38] pieces from the same passage babylon has
[27:41] always been literally and figuratively
[27:44] satan's headquarters
[27:45] it was in the city of babylon that
[27:47] satanic worship had its origin
[27:50] so think of this its origins its
[27:52] beginnings not only was the end i
[27:54] thought that was very interesting not
[27:55] only was ancestor worship originated in
[27:57] babylon but so also was the worship of
[28:00] nature
[28:02] gotta watch these things
[28:04] ancestor worship the lifting up of
[28:05] ancestors lifting up of a family name
[28:08] lifting up a family ancestor worship
[28:10] originates in babylon the worship of
[28:12] nature originates in babylon
[28:15] and i thought about how sometimes we
[28:17] lift we'll lift up natural remedies more
[28:19] than we will supernatural remedies
[28:21] come on somebody
[28:25] like there's only one essential oil
[28:27] right
[28:28] the holy spirit
[28:31] and so he says that this is where
[28:32] ancestor worship originated in babylon
[28:34] and this is where the worship of nature
[28:37] originated it was in babylon the gods
[28:39] were identified with the sun and the
[28:41] moon the chief object in nature was the
[28:44] sun which has light-giving and
[28:45] heat-giving properties uh oh
[28:48] sounds like some of the things we read
[28:49] about and hear about and appears to
[28:51] manage a ball of fire in the heaven so
[28:53] now they're looking at this and this
[28:54] becomes their object of worship this is
[28:56] what is great this is what is wonderful
[28:58] this is what is what is objectified this
[29:00] is what all manner submits themselves to
[29:03] is nature ancestor worship the worship
[29:05] of nature
[29:07] and then brother bran makes the point
[29:08] and this is verified in history
[29:10] monotheism or the worship of one god
[29:12] turned to polytheism in babylon
[29:15] worship of many gods this begins in
[29:18] babylon and this listen to the statement
[29:20] the devil's lie and the devil's
[29:22] mysteries
[29:23] rose up against the truth of god and the
[29:26] mysteries of god in that city
[29:29] this is where the mystery the mystery of
[29:30] god becomes lost this is where the
[29:32] mystery of god becomes assailed and
[29:34] attacked and it gets swallowed up in the
[29:36] devil's lie and the devil's mysteries in
[29:38] babylon the mystery of god is hid
[29:40] in babylon the mystery of god gets
[29:42] confused with the lies of the devil in
[29:44] babylon the devil's mysteries rise up
[29:46] against the truth of god in babylon the
[29:48] devil's liars are greater than the truth
[29:50] of god and the mysteries of god in
[29:52] babylon is a place where the truth of
[29:54] christ is pushed down
[29:56] and you cannot know it you cannot hear
[29:57] it he says satan truly became the god of
[29:59] this world and exacted worship from
[30:01] those that he had duped causing them to
[30:03] believe that he was truly the lord
[30:06] this is what god called abraham out of
[30:09] so we see that god calls abraham out of
[30:11] the city of ur in the land of the
[30:13] chaldees and we identify with the plain
[30:14] of shinar the bible says is telling us
[30:17] this is in mesopotamia this is in
[30:19] babylonia this is in the very place
[30:21] where this kingdom and this religion and
[30:23] this devil worship and these evil things
[30:26] originated and god said i want to call
[30:28] one man i'm going to begin with abraham
[30:30] and what is he portraying
[30:32] election by grace salvation by faith and
[30:35] it begins by calling them out of babylon
[30:39] so important for us to unders recognize
[30:41] that and see that part
[30:42] then it should be and i know i'm making
[30:44] a kind of a
[30:46] a huge leap here
[30:48] in in coming to this because of skipping
[30:50] a lot in abraham's story and his family
[30:52] story but god gives maybe i won't skip
[30:54] it i'll just do it very very fast god
[30:56] gives abraham a promise i'm going to
[30:57] give you children and i'm going to give
[30:59] you a land and your children enjoy on
[31:00] that land and i'll be your god forever
[31:01] and it's called the promised land and
[31:02] this is where they're going to dwell and
[31:04] this is what we begin to read about from
[31:05] genesis chapter 12 on even till now
[31:07] we're reading about the story of one man
[31:09] in his seat after him
[31:11] but in giving him this promise
[31:13] and we know that he even prophesied that
[31:14] your seed is going to go soldier in a
[31:16] strange land went down into egypt
[31:18] and they go down in egypt just as
[31:20] abraham went down into egypt and then he
[31:22] said i'm going to call them out they're
[31:23] going to bring you back to that land and
[31:25] i'm going to give you a word i'm going
[31:26] to give you promises and as long as you
[31:28] keep my word i'm going to bless you
[31:30] right
[31:31] and so he's telling him that this is the
[31:32] promise i've made and you have to
[31:34] you have to worship me you have to keep
[31:35] me uh at the center of your of your
[31:38] lives
[31:39] but then when israel fell away from
[31:42] those promises who does god use to judge
[31:44] him
[31:45] babylon
[31:46] god uses babylon to judge israel and
[31:48] whenever they disobeyed the word of god
[31:51] their disobedience leads them not only
[31:53] in some instances under babylonian
[31:55] rulership but also leads them back into
[31:58] babylon
[32:00] many scriptures a dozen or so scriptures
[32:02] we could use to share this with you i'll
[32:04] just choose chose two to read in second
[32:06] kings chapter 20 verse 17
[32:08] behold the days come that all that is in
[32:10] thine house and that which thy fathers
[32:12] have laid up in store unto this day
[32:14] shall be carried into babylon nothing
[32:17] shall be left saith the lord
[32:19] think of how striking this is
[32:21] we be the children of abraham we are
[32:23] that we serve the fa the god of abraham
[32:25] isaac and jacob this is our land this is
[32:27] our throne this is our people this is
[32:29] where we dwell
[32:30] and abraham was called out of babylon
[32:32] but as soon as they start disobeying and
[32:34] they won't hearken the voice of god he
[32:37] says you're all going right back
[32:39] back i mean they're going back to what
[32:41] they called their father of their faith
[32:43] out of in ezekiel 17 12 speaking of
[32:45] nebuchadnezzar say now to the rebellious
[32:47] house this is the the king of babylon
[32:50] who is referring to know ye not what
[32:52] these things mean tell them behold
[32:54] nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon is
[32:56] come to notice this jerusalem
[32:59] he's come to jerusalem and have taken
[33:01] the king thereof and the princes thereof
[33:03] and led them with him to babylon
[33:07] this is the exile in babylon we read
[33:09] about in the book of daniel this is the
[33:10] exile in babylon that we read about in
[33:12] jeremiah this is the lamentations of the
[33:14] children of israel why because they had
[33:16] been taken out of the land that was
[33:18] given to them that was established by
[33:21] their fathers abraham isaac and jacob
[33:23] the promised land and when they fail to
[33:26] honor god what happens the very thing
[33:28] that god separated abraham out of
[33:31] reaches back and takes them into the
[33:33] place that god wanted to keep them from
[33:38] he could have had all of them born there
[33:40] and then caused a mass exodus but no he
[33:42] wanted to cause them to be separated
[33:45] from earth he wanted them to be
[33:46] separated from chaldea he wanted them to
[33:48] be separated from babylon and so he did
[33:50] it by preserving the whole seed by
[33:52] calling him out of babylon and he says
[33:54] if you fail to obey me you're gonna go
[33:56] right back into babylon
[34:00] god allowing certain things and events
[34:02] to take place to portray something to us
[34:05] but notice god uses babylon i know this
[34:07] isn't any
[34:09] uh wonderful mystery to you but i'm
[34:11] wanting just to bring these things in
[34:12] your view so you can put these pieces
[34:14] together on this faith of abraham and
[34:16] how much you can relate to it
[34:19] brother man makes this statement in the
[34:20] the sermon in inside he said then there
[34:22] come another which was king
[34:23] nebuchadnezzar and he was going to build
[34:26] a city
[34:26] and if you'll notice sometimes those
[34:28] spirits that get onto men
[34:31] let me pause here he's going to get into
[34:34] some details about this city that
[34:36] nebuchadnezzar built
[34:37] this is the babylon that exists
[34:39] in second kings 20 ezekiel 17. this is
[34:42] the babylon
[34:43] that judged israel
[34:45] but remember the babylon
[34:48] that abraham was called out of nimrod
[34:50] built these great cities
[34:52] it was there where the two rivers were
[34:55] and it was in mesopotamia a very rich uh
[34:57] fertile area and actually with
[34:59] the name calder the chaldeans the
[35:02] chaldees it speaks of wisdom because it
[35:03] was wise to live there this is a fertile
[35:05] place the fertile crescent this is a
[35:07] place that's very rich and
[35:09] in
[35:11] resources to be able to thrive and to
[35:13] live
[35:14] and so nebuchadnezzar now
[35:16] many many years later he builds a city
[35:18] he's built it in the same region and if
[35:20] you'll notice sometimes those spirits
[35:22] they get onto men
[35:24] so now he's identifying the spirits
[35:25] still have nimrod nebuchadnezzar and
[35:27] it's a day coming and now where the
[35:30] christian church the church of the lord
[35:32] jesus christ ought to be so spiritual
[35:34] because that jesus said that the two
[35:36] spirits would be so close till it would
[35:38] deceive the very elected if it was
[35:39] possible
[35:41] the enemy is so coming cunning so now
[35:43] this is
[35:45] this kind of fast forwards to where i'm
[35:47] wanting to focus on or we want to focus
[35:49] on for ourselves we see it in nimrod
[35:51] nebuchadnezzar but the spirit's still
[35:53] alive today
[35:56] he said now watch him with
[35:57] nebuchadnezzar he built the city just
[35:59] exactly a pattern of heaven
[36:01] as the river euphrates flowed by the
[36:03] throne
[36:04] this is satan's agenda
[36:06] this is his plan like in heaven the
[36:07] river water life goes by the throne
[36:09] swinging guards and everything just
[36:11] exactly like it was for before why
[36:14] when abraham was journeying
[36:16] looking for such a city
[36:19] so when abraham was journeying looking
[36:20] for a city he was looking for the real
[36:22] one not er not babylonia not nimrod
[36:25] cities not these other cities that were
[36:26] built by nimrod in his seat after him
[36:29] but he was promised a city and abraham's
[36:31] vision was on a heavenly city everyone
[36:33] else was focused on natural things
[36:35] natural amenities the sun the moon the
[36:37] worship of the church the worship of
[36:38] false deities the worship of man and
[36:41] wanting to build something great making
[36:42] something great for themselves he says
[36:44] abraham is journeying looking for a city
[36:47] and notice this warning and if you're
[36:49] not spiritually my spiritual minded
[36:51] satan will blind you on these things
[36:54] something that looks almost like it but
[36:56] it isn't it
[36:59] if it's man-made it's no good if it's
[37:01] blood buttoned by god it's the truth
[37:04] these man-made cities man-made religions
[37:06] man-made rescue systems man-made
[37:08] programs man-made ideas man-made
[37:10] doctrines man-made theologies can be
[37:12] made to look very attractive very
[37:14] beautiful have a lot of amenities have a
[37:16] lot of programs have a lot of alert to
[37:18] the flesh and that's the deception of
[37:20] nebuchadnezzar's kingdom that's the
[37:22] deception of babel that's the deception
[37:24] of babylon as it's beautiful and great
[37:27] and alluring and it can cause one to
[37:29] wonder and think wow isn't this
[37:31] beautiful isn't god good but if you
[37:33] don't have discernment if it's not blood
[37:36] bought if it's not in the truth it's
[37:38] deceiving you
[37:42] and that's what god called abraham out
[37:44] of
[37:45] to not fool himself into thinking that
[37:47] oh here i am worshiping these great many
[37:49] wonderful things
[37:50] and this beautifully calls them away
[37:52] from these cities of nimrod to a city
[37:53] that he was going to show him and then
[37:55] when the children of israel backslide
[37:57] they fall right back into the kingdom
[37:59] that's pattern itself after nimrod's
[38:01] which is satan's ambition in the
[38:04] beginning
[38:06] but it makes this statement again in the
[38:07] pergamon church age he says thus the
[38:09] mysteries of babylon
[38:11] spread from nation to nation
[38:14] oh that spirit never dies
[38:16] he began his kingdom
[38:19] in babel
[38:20] satan's kingdom uh the worship of one
[38:22] god turned to the worship of idols and
[38:24] many gods
[38:25] in babylon and now the mysteries of
[38:27] babylon spread from nation to nation
[38:29] until it appears in rome in china
[38:32] india and even in both north and south
[38:34] america we find the very same basic
[38:36] worship
[38:38] why do all these religions have some
[38:40] christ figure
[38:42] why do all of them seem to have some
[38:43] element that we would say is wow this is
[38:45] just this is the story in that culture
[38:48] and christianity is just the story in
[38:50] this culture and this is and the jews
[38:52] have their story and everyone has their
[38:53] story and it's all kind of lumped in is
[38:55] just mythology and each one has a
[38:57] different one but notice satan's agenda
[39:00] to confuse the truth
[39:02] and he begins a kingdom that propagates
[39:04] its own religion and it spreads out
[39:06] throughout the whole world
[39:08] and so he borrows elements of the truth
[39:11] and mingles it with his ideology and his
[39:13] false doctrine in the culture
[39:16] and all these other isms so that the
[39:18] mysteries of babylon are sowed into all
[39:20] of it but what's babylon an
[39:22] impersonation of the genuine
[39:25] satan wanted to build a kingdom like
[39:27] gods but he wanted his to be greater he
[39:28] wanted to overthrow god so satan is a
[39:30] perverter he's an impersonator and so
[39:32] what nimrod does he's tries to fashion
[39:34] this city and build something that would
[39:36] be reflective of the city that god had
[39:38] hid away in the in the heavens and then
[39:40] nebuchadnezzar comes along and he's
[39:42] trying to pattern after us this
[39:43] supernatural city that's the city that
[39:45] abraham's trying to follow and this
[39:47] false religion has spread throughout the
[39:49] world and it has common themes and
[39:52] stories and allegories and different
[39:54] situations and they all have uh what
[39:56] they call a flood myth and they all have
[39:58] a christ superhero and they all have the
[40:00] most religions even have a queen of
[40:02] sheba
[40:04] they all have these different stories
[40:05] and these different elements it's the
[40:06] mysteries of babylon spreading to where
[40:08] this very same basic elements of worship
[40:10] exist in every religion
[40:13] now whereas in genesis chapter 11 and
[40:16] even later in the days of the
[40:18] children of israel being taken into
[40:20] bondage these were
[40:22] physical kingdoms that in physical
[40:24] cities that existed upon earth
[40:26] the mysteries of babylon spread building
[40:28] a spiritual kingdom to satan
[40:31] in revelations chapter 17 verse 2 and 5
[40:35] speaks of babylon it says with whom the
[40:37] kings of the earth have committed
[40:38] fornication
[40:39] and the inhabitants of the earth have
[40:40] made have been made drunk with the wine
[40:42] of her fornication speaking of a city
[40:46] the kings of the earth the inhabitants
[40:47] of the earth verse five and upon her
[40:49] forehead was a name written mystery
[40:50] babylon the great the mother of harlots
[40:53] and the abominations of the earth
[40:55] they've been birthed from her every sin
[40:57] every evil every false god every false
[40:59] worship has come from babylon
[41:02] revelation 18 verses 3 and verse 5 for
[41:06] all nations have drunk of the wine of
[41:07] the wrath of her fornication and the
[41:09] kings of the earth have committed
[41:11] fornication with her and the merchants
[41:13] of the earth are waxed rich through the
[41:15] abundance of their delicacies
[41:17] remember when john first saw her what
[41:19] did he do wow
[41:21] she's beautiful
[41:23] first he caught him off guard and he
[41:24] marveled at her and wondered at this
[41:26] great beauty and her scarlet and her
[41:27] purple and all the way that she was
[41:30] erased and her amenities and her gold
[41:32] and everything that she is but then god
[41:34] begins to pull back the curtain for him
[41:36] to see that no she is the she is the
[41:38] cage of every foul bird
[41:40] she houses every evil and wicked spirit
[41:42] though it may be beautiful on the
[41:44] outside and have everything really great
[41:45] and beautiful and everything seems to be
[41:46] lined up just right she is she has
[41:49] caused all the earth kings of the earth
[41:50] to commit fornication all the
[41:52] inhabitants of the earth are drunk with
[41:54] the wine of her fornication all nations
[41:56] have drunk over wrath and her
[41:57] fornication kingdoms kings of the earth
[42:00] committed fornication with her and then
[42:02] it says in verse 5 for her sins notice
[42:04] this remember in the beginning the
[42:05] entire bible wanted to reach unto heaven
[42:07] but this is her legacy for her sins have
[42:10] reached unto heaven
[42:12] they made it there
[42:14] right but it was a tower of iniquity a
[42:16] tower of sin a tower of indignance
[42:18] towards god for her sins have reached
[42:20] unto heaven and notice and god hath
[42:22] remembered her iniquities
[42:24] there is a remembrance of god against
[42:26] babylon
[42:28] and what he remembers is her iniquities
[42:31] and so this is
[42:33] i wanted to share these things with you
[42:35] and i feel great that we're doing great
[42:36] on time we're going to make it to the
[42:37] picnic
[42:40] i i know there's a lot here a lot more
[42:42] that i would love to express and share
[42:43] in this
[42:44] but let me just ask you individually are
[42:46] you are these things making sense and
[42:48] piecing together for you i know it's
[42:49] just really just teaching without kind
[42:51] of the big reveal and the ear scratching
[42:54] but this is i want you just to be able
[42:56] to place these things in the context of
[42:58] abraham's life
[43:00] and then once we can see it in the
[43:01] context of abraham's life don't we see
[43:03] in the context of our life
[43:06] don't we see that what god called him
[43:07] out of in a spiritual and literal sense
[43:09] we have been called out of in a very
[43:11] spiritual sense somebody's very literal
[43:13] sense and so we can see it makes the
[43:15] faith of abraham relatable because our
[43:18] faith begins the same way his did
[43:21] and if it began the same way we go
[43:23] through the same process it'll end the
[43:24] same way
[43:26] and so as we look at babylon satan's
[43:28] kingdom and his power
[43:30] are represented by and embodied in that
[43:33] tower of babel
[43:35] his kingdom his power his authority his
[43:38] ambition is kind of embodied in babylon
[43:40] it's represented in chaldea
[43:43] and so by leading abraham out of babylon
[43:48] as we've mentioned before
[43:52] god foreshadows what he does for his
[43:54] seed
[43:57] he's going to take abraham out of
[43:59] babylon what is he doing he's removing
[44:01] him from the influence of it
[44:03] he's going to take him out of babylon
[44:04] he's removing the power of babylon he's
[44:07] he's not there to respond to the voices
[44:09] of of society he's not there ingrained
[44:11] in their way of worship to always be
[44:13] challenged by a comparison and what
[44:15] looks better and what's greater and
[44:17] and who has something that
[44:19] uh is more attractive and who's more
[44:21] popular and who what is going to benefit
[44:23] you economically and financially if you
[44:25] if you do this or you do that he leads
[44:28] him out of babylon breaking the power of
[44:30] babylon over him
[44:32] but again he's foreshadowing what he's
[44:34] going to do for his seed
[44:36] and he promises that he's not only going
[44:38] to break the power of babylon but he
[44:40] promises
[44:41] like this is going to be a deliverance
[44:42] to you and your seat after you he's
[44:44] going to and he makes promises even
[44:45] though that they would fall into bondage
[44:47] of babylon again he promises that
[44:49] there's going to be a revelation there's
[44:50] going to be deliverance of the seed of
[44:52] his seed
[44:53] in jeremiah chapter 42 verses 11 to 12
[44:57] be not afraid of the king of babylon
[44:59] of whom you are afraid
[45:02] be not afraid
[45:04] of him saith the lord
[45:06] for i am with you to save you and to
[45:08] deliver you from his hand
[45:10] and i will show mercies unto you that he
[45:12] may have mercy upon you and cause you to
[45:15] return to your land
[45:18] think of this this is prophecy that the
[45:21] power of babylon will be broken
[45:24] he called abraham out of it though his
[45:26] seed would go back into it he says don't
[45:27] be afraid of the king of babylon
[45:29] i am with you to save you and deliver
[45:31] you from his hand
[45:32] jeremiah chapter 50 verse 8 remove out
[45:35] of the midst of babylon and go forth out
[45:37] of the land of the chaldeans and be as
[45:40] the he goats before the flocks
[45:42] this is exactly what god did abraham
[45:45] now they're back in bondage again but
[45:46] god is prophesying to those who've been
[45:48] carried away into babylon remove out of
[45:50] the midst of babylon come ye out of the
[45:52] land of the chaldeans they're going to
[45:54] do exactly what abraham had done before
[45:57] abram get out of that country get out of
[45:58] this
[45:59] from my family get out of the city of ur
[46:02] in the land of the county and get out of
[46:03] babylon abraham and then when they find
[46:05] themselves back there he's saying i will
[46:07] call you back out again
[46:10] what a great prophecy what a great
[46:12] promise
[46:14] and then
[46:16] i i have to apologize to brother ellie
[46:19] and brother christian they asked me to
[46:20] preach an african sermon this morning
[46:23] and i said well that means they want me
[46:24] to preach for more than two hours and i
[46:26] said well if i could get some african
[46:27] amends i'll do that
[46:29] and uh i apologize i'm i don't even know
[46:31] if i'm going to make it in an hour
[46:32] brother ellie i need some i need some
[46:34] more pulling
[46:36] um i just realized i'm going a lot
[46:38] better on time than i thought it would i
[46:39] know i went really really fast but i'm
[46:41] going so fast i can start over and slow
[46:42] down
[46:44] because we really don't have the the
[46:46] pavilions rented till one so i feel like
[46:48] i can go to at least 12 45 and we'll
[46:49] make it there on time
[46:52] but i'll just take a deep breath slow
[46:53] down here
[46:55] in acts chapter 13 verse 19
[46:59] notice what it says here
[47:02] it says in babylon the glory of kingdoms
[47:05] the beauty of the chaldee's excellency
[47:09] shall be as when god overthrew sodom and
[47:11] gomorrah
[47:12] i think this to me is such an important
[47:15] uh characterization that god is using
[47:17] he's identifying babylon it's the glory
[47:19] of kingdoms
[47:21] it's the mysteries of babylon that
[47:22] spread from nation to nation and
[47:24] appeared in every major religion in the
[47:25] world today it's the it's in babylon
[47:28] that the devil's lies and the devil's
[47:30] mysteries raise up against the truth of
[47:32] god in the mysteries of god
[47:34] this is in babylon it's the glory of
[47:36] kingdoms it's babylon that becomes the
[47:38] mystery the great the mother of
[47:39] heartless the abominations of the earth
[47:40] it's babylon the beauty of the chaldees
[47:43] remember what abraham is called out of
[47:46] and god makes this prophecy shall be is
[47:48] when god overthrew
[47:50] sodom and gomorrah
[47:53] i'm just wanting to recap this
[47:55] i just want to remind you again genesis
[47:57] chapter 11 a city and a tower
[48:00] now abraham is called out to a land that
[48:02] will be shown thereafter this is the
[48:03] contrast the comparison that we've been
[48:05] trying to make and see these things
[48:06] together now when god speaks of the
[48:08] destruction of babylon he compares it to
[48:10] the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah
[48:14] and in genesis chapter 19 god destroys
[48:16] sodom and when he does he's
[48:18] foreshadowing the destruction of babylon
[48:21] because in isaiah later when he talks
[48:23] about the destruction of babylon he says
[48:25] i'm going to destroy it like i did sodom
[48:27] and gomorrah
[48:28] so though god called abraham out of
[48:31] babylon in abraham's life he's going to
[48:34] give a a foreshadowing and a symbol of
[48:37] what is going to happen to babylon the
[48:39] glory of kingdoms the beauty of the
[48:40] counties i am going to destroy her and
[48:43] when i do it's going to be like when i
[48:45] destroyed sodom and gomorrah
[48:49] and then in genesis chapter 19
[48:52] we know in chapter 18 god visits him in
[48:54] flesh and the lord comes down and visits
[48:56] him in the tent door abraham's there in
[48:57] the heat of the day it is tent door god
[48:59] comes down
[49:01] and he visits him
[49:02] and
[49:04] let me just see if i have
[49:07] um
[49:11] when he visits him
[49:18] he's going to speak to him specifically
[49:20] about the fact that sarah is going to
[49:21] bring forth a son in a year i'm going to
[49:23] visit according to my life and shara's
[49:24] going to conceive
[49:25] but then there's two other messengers
[49:27] with him right
[49:28] and they keep looking down to sodom and
[49:30] gomorrah
[49:31] their eyes are fixated on sodom and
[49:33] gomorrah
[49:34] and then those two angels go down into
[49:36] sodom and gomorrah but that one the lord
[49:39] stayed back
[49:40] with abraham and his group where the
[49:43] band characterizes it often
[49:45] and he says can i hide from abraham that
[49:47] thing which i'm going to do
[49:49] and he basically says their sins and
[49:51] their iniquities
[49:53] have reached me and i'm going to judge
[49:55] them and he begins to speak how he's
[49:57] going to judge him and abraham says well
[49:59] what if you just find 50 righteous and
[50:00] he starts saying lord maybe maybe if you
[50:02] could just find any righteous in the
[50:04] city you would preserve them and this
[50:05] was the the cry of abraham desiring to
[50:08] see soul save but in particular his
[50:10] family his nephew lot whom he called his
[50:12] brother
[50:13] and so god brings judgment on sodom and
[50:16] gomorrah there's messengers rescue lot
[50:18] out of there
[50:19] but notice what it says now
[50:21] at the time that sodom and gomor are
[50:23] being overthrown what god does to
[50:25] abraham he does to his seed what he's
[50:27] doing there he's showing that what he
[50:29] does to abraham he's going to do to
[50:31] abraham's seed
[50:32] and we're bringing this comparison in
[50:34] contrast genesis 11 genesis chapter 12.
[50:36] now genesis 11 is babylon
[50:39] now god associates the destruction of
[50:41] babylon being foreshadowed in the
[50:44] destruction of sodom and gomorrah
[50:46] and at the time that sodom and gomorrah
[50:47] is being destroyed there's abraham right
[50:49] in the middle of the story
[50:50] in verse 27 and abraham got up early in
[50:53] the morning in that place where he
[50:55] stood before the lord
[50:57] and he looked towards sodom and gomorrah
[50:59] he's in that place where he'd met the
[51:00] lord he's in that place where the word
[51:01] was opened up to him he's standing there
[51:03] as if before the lord and he looked
[51:05] toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all
[51:07] the land of the plane and be held and lo
[51:09] the smoke of the country went up as the
[51:11] smoke of the land of the plain and
[51:13] beheld and loathed and the smoke of as a
[51:16] as went up as the smoke of a furnace and
[51:18] it came to pass when god destroyed the
[51:20] cities of the plain that god remembered
[51:23] abraham
[51:24] and it continues to speak about how that
[51:26] he rescued lot out of that but notice
[51:28] how remarkable this is at the time of
[51:30] the destruction of sodom and gomorrah
[51:32] god remembers abraham and at the time of
[51:35] the destruction of babylon it tells us
[51:36] god hath remembered her iniquities but
[51:39] at the same time he's destroying babylon
[51:41] god remembers his elect
[51:44] just as god remembers abraham at the
[51:46] time of the destruction of sodom and
[51:47] gomorrah god remembers you at the time
[51:50] of the destruction of babylon
[51:53] he sets the precedent
[51:55] for god's protection in the end time in
[51:57] the time of the rapture and the time of
[51:58] the laodicean church age because it says
[52:00] in revelations chapter 18 verse 4
[52:03] speaking about babylon this mystery
[52:05] babylon the great the mother of harlots
[52:07] and the abominations of the earth it
[52:08] says and i heard another voice from
[52:10] heaven saying come out of her my people
[52:13] that you be not partakers of her sins
[52:15] and that you receive not of your plagues
[52:18] come out of here come out of who come
[52:20] out of babylon come out of mystery
[52:22] babylon come out of laodicea come out of
[52:24] this this this kingdom this this this
[52:27] culture this way of belief come out of
[52:29] all these things come out of her why
[52:31] because i'm going to judge it so you've
[52:33] got to come out of it you've got to be
[52:34] separated and stand before the lord
[52:38] you'll notice in the book of revelation
[52:40] that god uses sodom egypt and babylon
[52:42] all to describe satan's kingdom
[52:45] egypt sodom and babylon and all three of
[52:47] them can relate to abraham because he
[52:49] called him out of babylon though he went
[52:51] to egypt for a time he called them back
[52:53] out of egypt and the seed of abraham
[52:54] also went back into egypt they went into
[52:56] babylon but each time he's called him
[52:57] out of him and right there in the middle
[52:59] of all that he destroys the influence of
[53:01] evil right in the land of by destroying
[53:04] sodom and gomorrah
[53:07] all these things being represented by
[53:09] satan's kingdom
[53:13] now ponder this as we
[53:16] arrive at i would say our closing
[53:18] thought
[53:21] in in looking at it in terms of
[53:25] not that i'm closing i'm just coming to
[53:27] this thought that i'd like to end on
[53:31] when i was when the lord was just
[53:32] inspiring these things to me to just
[53:34] jotted down different scriptures and
[53:36] things
[53:37] kind of the thought that began to emerge
[53:39] to me was the tell of two cities
[53:43] because you have
[53:45] the the story of two different kingdoms
[53:48] and you see their beginnings and you see
[53:50] their destinies
[53:52] and they're all portrayed in genesis
[53:54] chapter 11 in chapter 12.
[53:56] genesis chapter 11 is the beginning of
[53:58] babylon it tells it starts the story of
[54:00] babylon
[54:02] and in it it's it it ends in confusion
[54:04] the entire genesis chapter
[54:07] 10 even begins to tell the story of the
[54:08] start of bible in genesis 11 this tower
[54:10] of babel it's representing babylon
[54:14] and god foreshadows its end confusion
[54:16] chaos
[54:18] but then at the same time he begins to
[54:20] story tell the story of the kingdom that
[54:22] abraham seeks
[54:24] because it says in hebrews chapter 11
[54:26] verse 10 for he looked for a city which
[54:28] have foundations
[54:29] whose builder and maker is god
[54:33] here's a city
[54:35] that's being built in abraham's backyard
[54:37] and when god begins to call him his eyes
[54:39] turn away from that city
[54:41] and he begins to look for a city that's
[54:42] greater
[54:44] no matter how much that kingdom tried to
[54:46] impersonate and look like the city he
[54:48] was looking for he knew in his heart the
[54:50] one he was looking for was greater
[54:53] and it becomes a tale of two kingdoms a
[54:54] tale of two cities the city that man
[54:56] builds upon the earth and the city that
[54:58] abraham was looking for in his heart
[55:01] and in psalms 48 1-3 great is the lord
[55:04] and greatly to be praised in the city of
[55:07] our god
[55:08] this is the city that abraham looked for
[55:10] in the mountain of his holiness remember
[55:12] this is the place that abra that satan
[55:14] wanted to have beautiful for situation
[55:17] the joy of the whole earth what a
[55:19] contrast to mystery babylon
[55:22] it says is mount zion
[55:24] but makes a statement in one place where
[55:26] you see zion it's always the bride
[55:28] so it's associated with you on the sides
[55:30] of the north
[55:31] the city of the great king
[55:35] god is known in her palaces for a refuge
[55:38] notice this city that's being described
[55:39] the city of our god
[55:41] in the mountain of his holiness mount
[55:43] zion the city of the great king
[55:46] the city that's being spoken of here
[55:49] does not describe alone the natural
[55:51] jerusalem though some may associate it
[55:53] with that
[55:54] but natural jerusalem was just a type of
[55:56] the spiritual jerusalem
[55:58] natural jerusalem is a type of the
[55:59] supernatural jerusalem that god is going
[56:01] to brings forth this spiritual way that
[56:03] god is going to bring forth in a very
[56:05] literal way in that eighth day in that
[56:07] eternal city is speaking of the city
[56:09] that abraham was seeking after
[56:13] so it's no surprise after john marvels
[56:15] at this babylon in this city in
[56:17] revelations 17 and 18 and she's
[56:19] described
[56:20] in such detail but the bride has caught
[56:23] come out of her my people it's no
[56:25] surprise that john is then introduced to
[56:27] the real thing in revelations 21
[56:30] verses 1 to 2 he says i saw a new heaven
[56:32] and a new earth
[56:34] for the first heaven and the first earth
[56:35] were passed away
[56:37] and there was no more sea
[56:41] ah and i john saw the holy city
[56:44] new jerusalem
[56:46] coming down from god of the heaven
[56:48] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[56:50] husband
[56:52] john now sees the city
[56:54] and he sees this city described as a
[56:56] bride adorned for her husband what is it
[56:58] in spiritual type
[56:59] it's the lamb's wife
[57:02] in this literal coming of this city that
[57:04] we will inhabit it is the new jerusalem
[57:08] it is the mount zion it is the city of
[57:11] the great king it is the city of our god
[57:14] it is this great beautiful holy city
[57:16] that comes down out of heaven the
[57:19] heavens that the tower wanted to reach
[57:21] to the heavens that satan wanted to send
[57:22] to now god has made a city the city made
[57:26] by god descending out of heaven and
[57:29] coming down to earth
[57:31] and brother branham details this in into
[57:34] a great length in the future home sermon
[57:37] he says the redeemed shall walk in the
[57:38] light we sing now we'll walk in the
[57:40] light that beautiful light there's
[57:42] something in us calling out
[57:44] is passed from death and to life it's
[57:47] because that's waiting
[57:49] that's what the attribute what we feel
[57:52] truly
[57:53] this is what the attribute what we feel
[57:55] truly this is he says are you ready
[57:58] this is the city that abraham was
[58:00] looking for
[58:02] it says being a prophet he knew that
[58:04] city was somewhere
[58:06] so think of this what john sees coming
[58:09] down out of heaven in revelations 21 1-2
[58:12] as a bride adorned for her husband which
[58:14] you are reflecting and manifesting right
[58:16] now as the bride of jesus christ that's
[58:19] the city that abraham was looking for
[58:21] because of him being a prophet he knew
[58:24] that city was somewhere
[58:26] so when god begins to call abram out of
[58:28] the city of earth in the land of the
[58:30] counties and he calls him out of babylon
[58:32] he's walking away from the tower of
[58:35] babel he's walking away from this
[58:37] mystery babylon he's walking away from
[58:39] that city that represents satan's
[58:41] ambition and he's walking by vision
[58:43] towards the new jerusalem
[58:47] that city that abraham was looking for
[58:50] and say babylon
[58:54] that city that abraham was looking being
[58:55] a prophet he knew that city was
[58:56] somewhere
[58:58] and he said there's something in us
[58:59] calling out for that
[59:01] it's an attribute
[59:03] that has called out for that city that
[59:05] abraham was looking for
[59:07] and in babylon chapter 11
[59:10] excuse me genesis chapter 11.
[59:12] i'm writing a new book
[59:13] subscribe get an early copy i'll
[59:15] autograph it for you
[59:17] it has 11 chapters
[59:19] it's named babylon has 11 chapters
[59:20] babylon chapter 11.
[59:23] it speaks of genesis genesis chapter 11
[59:25] babylon is represented there
[59:28] what is it it's the beginning of satan's
[59:30] earthly kingdom
[59:32] remember how brother brahman said when
[59:34] god called abraham out of babylon the
[59:35] beginning of christianity
[59:37] these twins are born
[59:39] satan's kingdom his perversion of
[59:41] religion his perversion of the worship
[59:42] of god his perversion of christianity is
[59:44] it culminates in climaxes in this
[59:46] mystery babylon and we see it in
[59:48] catholicism we feed all in all the isms
[59:51] of the world today
[59:53] it's the beginning of satan's earthly
[59:55] kingdom and what happens in genesis
[59:56] chapter 11.
[59:58] god comes down and brings confusion
[1:00:01] is that what the bible says i thought
[1:00:03] that'd be my easiest amen since i set it
[1:00:05] up for an hour
[1:00:06] in genesis chapter 11 god comes down he
[1:00:08] says i'm coming down into babylon i'm
[1:00:10] coming down i'm going to visit the city
[1:00:12] that they build and he visits it and
[1:00:14] what does he do he brings confusion
[1:00:16] god does the same thing in the end time
[1:00:19] he's foreshadowing what he does in the
[1:00:20] end time in second thessalonians chapter
[1:00:22] 2 verse 11 talking about the antichrist
[1:00:24] talking about
[1:00:25] the deceiving powers and all the lying
[1:00:26] wonders it says and for this
[1:00:28] cause god shall send them strong
[1:00:30] delusion that they should believe a lie
[1:00:33] think about that
[1:00:34] god came down in genesis 11 and caused
[1:00:36] confusion at the beginning of babylon
[1:00:39] now as babylon is going to reach its
[1:00:40] apex and the antichrist is going to be
[1:00:42] crowned incarnate and it's going to come
[1:00:44] to its fullest this is everything that
[1:00:46] satan was wanting from the beginning
[1:00:48] from genesis chapter 11 and god sends a
[1:00:51] strong delusion
[1:00:52] why he did it in genesis 11 he
[1:00:54] prophesies it in second thessalonians 2
[1:00:56] 11 that i will send confusion once again
[1:00:59] and satan's lies and the devil's lies
[1:01:02] will swallow up the mystery of god
[1:01:06] the devil's lies and the devil's
[1:01:07] mysteries will rise up against the truth
[1:01:09] of god in the mysteries of god in that
[1:01:11] city in babylon in the end time when
[1:01:14] this antichrist is coming to his full
[1:01:16] power i god will send confusion once
[1:01:19] again
[1:01:21] he promised it
[1:01:23] instead of rescuing them instead of
[1:01:25] speaking plainly to them instead of
[1:01:27] trying to help everybody in one mass of
[1:01:29] humanity as they all blindly built this
[1:01:31] entire bible and where of uh
[1:01:33] self-ambition self-preservation
[1:01:35] self-protection all these things that
[1:01:36] they were doing against god instead of
[1:01:38] god coming down and speaking plainly to
[1:01:41] them that they might change their ways
[1:01:43] he sends a strong delusion and confuses
[1:01:45] all of them and then by election speaks
[1:01:47] plainly to one man
[1:01:52] at the time
[1:01:55] that god
[1:01:57] visits them
[1:01:59] it's the same era
[1:02:01] that god sends strong illusion
[1:02:03] and confusion
[1:02:05] in genesis 11
[1:02:06] he visited abraham
[1:02:09] genesis chapter 12.
[1:02:10] you you could even look at it in the
[1:02:12] context of chapter 11 because he says
[1:02:14] because god had said
[1:02:16] so that speaking to abraham took place
[1:02:19] in those events that are described in
[1:02:20] genesis chapter 11.
[1:02:25] but i want to close with this
[1:02:31] there's another visitation
[1:02:34] related to this city that abraham sought
[1:02:37] god visits one city to confuse it and
[1:02:39] keep it from being built god causes
[1:02:41] delusion in satan's kingdom at the end
[1:02:43] time and satan's eden the god of this
[1:02:45] world the god of this evil age all these
[1:02:47] things that could be used to
[1:02:48] characterize satan in babylon
[1:02:50] there's another place that god
[1:02:53] visits abraham that's reflective of this
[1:02:56] city that abraham's looking for what was
[1:02:57] it the new jerusalem
[1:03:00] genesis chapter 14
[1:03:02] this is after a lot had been kidnapped
[1:03:05] abraham takes 318 of his trained
[1:03:07] servants and runs out and fights these
[1:03:09] kings and rescues
[1:03:11] uh lot
[1:03:13] and is returning
[1:03:15] genesis chapter 14 verse 17 to 20
[1:03:18] and the king of sodom went out to meet
[1:03:19] him
[1:03:21] after his return from the slaughter of
[1:03:23] cheda lomaira and of the kings that were
[1:03:25] with him at the valley of chavez
[1:03:27] which is the kings dale
[1:03:29] and amazing
[1:03:31] this this battle of kings he defeats
[1:03:33] these kings and is returning the king of
[1:03:35] sodom meets them and you'll read later
[1:03:38] i think it's beginning in verse 21 that
[1:03:39] the king of sodom offers him things
[1:03:42] wants certain things and offers him
[1:03:44] certain things he's going to let you
[1:03:45] keep this and let's negotiate something
[1:03:47] and what does abraham do
[1:03:49] he refuses the king of sodom
[1:03:51] he says because i don't want it to be
[1:03:53] said that every anything i have came
[1:03:55] from you
[1:03:58] and so here it is this is this great
[1:03:59] beautiful type for those of us living in
[1:04:01] a modern sodom and gomorrah
[1:04:04] and then verse 18 and melchizedek
[1:04:07] king of salem
[1:04:10] notice this
[1:04:11] king of salem this is jerusalem now it's
[1:04:14] king of salem melchizedek king of salem
[1:04:16] brought forth bread and wine and he was
[1:04:18] the priest of the most high god he's
[1:04:19] king and priest who is this melchizedek
[1:04:23] who is it that's spoken of he has made a
[1:04:25] priest forever after the order of
[1:04:27] melchizedek he has made us kings and
[1:04:29] priests what was christ he was prophet
[1:04:31] priest and king all these images and
[1:04:33] these symbolisms start coming up right
[1:04:35] here in genesis 14 and one verse there's
[1:04:37] such an overwhelming introduction of who
[1:04:40] christ is who god is who you are
[1:04:44] melchizedek king of salem brought forth
[1:04:46] bread and wine after the battle after
[1:04:48] the war with these kings after the
[1:04:49] rescue of his family he brings him bread
[1:04:51] and wine he was the priest of the most
[1:04:53] high god and he blessed him and said
[1:04:55] blessed be abram of the most high god
[1:04:58] possessor of heaven and earth
[1:05:01] and blessed be the most high god which
[1:05:03] hath delivered thine enemies into thy
[1:05:04] hand and abraham gave him tithes of all
[1:05:14] if you read when you read the story
[1:05:16] here comes this king of sodom and these
[1:05:18] others come come coming up to abraham
[1:05:21] and then right there in the presence of
[1:05:23] the king of sodom in the presence of
[1:05:25] sodomites in the presence of all these
[1:05:27] people
[1:05:30] the king of salem
[1:05:32] visits abraham
[1:05:34] right in the presence of all of them
[1:05:36] the king of salem
[1:05:38] salem is the same
[1:05:40] as jerusalem
[1:05:41] the king of salem the new jerusalem
[1:05:45] and what does he do he serves in
[1:05:46] communion
[1:05:48] feasted in the presence of his enemies
[1:05:50] thou had prepared a table for me in the
[1:05:52] presence of mine enemies he dined with
[1:05:53] him in the presence of these wicked
[1:05:55] kings
[1:05:57] here's abraham
[1:05:59] in the promised land but yet there's
[1:06:01] still a destruction that has to come of
[1:06:03] sodom it still has to be a completely
[1:06:06] removal of anything that's blinding
[1:06:08] anything that's wicked anything that's
[1:06:10] perverted and right there in the
[1:06:12] presence of these kings and the presence
[1:06:13] of these people the lord himself comes
[1:06:15] down veils himself in flesh and serves
[1:06:18] communion
[1:06:20] to abraham
[1:06:23] to abraham
[1:06:25] then what does jesus do
[1:06:29] in the days of his flesh he serves
[1:06:32] communion sits down with abraham's seed
[1:06:34] and serves communion to the natural seed
[1:06:37] so very exactly what he did
[1:06:40] to abraham
[1:06:42] then in revelations chapter 3 verse 20.
[1:06:45] revelations 18 4 i heard another voice
[1:06:49] saying come out of babylon
[1:06:51] come out of her my people
[1:06:55] it's the same voice in revelations 3 20
[1:06:56] behold i stand at the door and knock
[1:06:59] if any man hear my voice
[1:07:01] and open the door i will come into him
[1:07:05] and will sup with him
[1:07:07] and he with me
[1:07:09] that's exactly what we have the
[1:07:10] privilege of doing in this time it's
[1:07:11] exactly what we're doing right now in
[1:07:13] the end time is we're having communion
[1:07:15] with the king
[1:07:16] in the presence of all the wicked kings
[1:07:19] in the presence of sodom and the
[1:07:20] presence of gomorrah
[1:07:21] in the presence of laodicea and all that
[1:07:23] is babylon we've been called out
[1:07:25] spiritually seen this uh raptured up
[1:07:28] quickly to meet the word of god for our
[1:07:30] day in here we are feasting with the
[1:07:32] king in the presence of these the king
[1:07:34] in a time when babylon is reaching its
[1:07:37] apex we are dying and fellowshipping
[1:07:40] though it may be dark out there we have
[1:07:42] communion with the king right here
[1:07:44] why because he's called us out of
[1:07:46] babylon as he did abraham
[1:07:49] and he's feasting us with us
[1:07:52] in the shadows of the destruction of
[1:07:54] sodom and gomorrah
[1:07:55] just as he did with abraham
[1:07:58] in fact the musicians to come this is
[1:08:00] the last
[1:08:01] a statement i'd like to read
[1:08:10] it says jesus has gone to prepare
[1:08:13] with the divine hands a divine city
[1:08:17] divine architect for a divine
[1:08:19] bottom people
[1:08:21] for predestinated people he has gone to
[1:08:24] prepare
[1:08:26] abraham was looking for it
[1:08:29] and he professed that he was a pilgrim
[1:08:31] and a stranger
[1:08:33] for he looked for a city whose builder
[1:08:34] and maker was god
[1:08:37] that prophet knowing it was somewhere
[1:08:41] think of this now
[1:08:43] that what god does to abraham he does to
[1:08:45] a seed after him
[1:08:47] and how this tell of two cities god
[1:08:49] calls abraham right in the shadow of the
[1:08:51] tower of babel
[1:08:52] to bring a contrast
[1:08:55] to set the precedent so we can see his
[1:08:57] pattern in the process of coming to
[1:08:59] supreme faith he's walking abraham right
[1:09:01] through these steps these tell the two
[1:09:03] cities the city that abraham looked for
[1:09:05] and the city that man builds that wants
[1:09:07] to capture people and bind people
[1:09:09] abraham was looking for it he's a
[1:09:11] prophet he knows it somewhere john saw
[1:09:15] it coming down
[1:09:17] but abraham thought it must be on earth
[1:09:19] right then
[1:09:20] i think this is this is awesome why
[1:09:23] he met melchizedek the king of it
[1:09:25] [Music]
[1:09:27] this is what's represented in genesis
[1:09:28] chapter 14
[1:09:30] and give him a tithe
[1:09:32] which had no father or nor mother he had
[1:09:34] no beginning of life
[1:09:36] or no ending of life
[1:09:38] if you've been saving your amends for
[1:09:40] you know for the end this is the end
[1:09:43] all right you can't it's like timeouts
[1:09:45] you can't carry them into the next half
[1:09:48] use up all your amens you get new ones
[1:09:50] in the next service
[1:09:52] notice how beautiful this is he's saying
[1:09:54] that the prophet knew this city was
[1:09:55] somewhere he thought it must be on earth
[1:09:57] because he met melchizedek the king of
[1:09:59] it what the king of new jerusalem he
[1:10:01] says abraham met him and they took
[1:10:04] communion
[1:10:05] right on the literal spot where the city
[1:10:08] will be raised up the holy mountain of
[1:10:11] the lord where the redeemed will live
[1:10:14] isn't that beautiful how what god is
[1:10:16] representing in the life of abraham
[1:10:19] abraham longed to see it and god knew
[1:10:21] that he wouldn't be in that literal city
[1:10:24] that's to come but the king of it came
[1:10:26] down and met him on the very spot where
[1:10:29] it would settle generations and
[1:10:31] generations later that city one day
[1:10:34] that'll come down that you represent now
[1:10:36] the king of it came and met abraham and
[1:10:39] served in communion and that's what's
[1:10:41] happening today in the midst of this
[1:10:44] babylon this laodicea this egypt this
[1:10:47] sodom and gomorrh the king of that new
[1:10:50] jerusalem has come down and is serving
[1:10:52] you communion
[1:10:55] he's doing it for you his elect why
[1:10:57] because he did it to abraham before you
[1:11:01] right on the literal spot
[1:11:04] what a what an amazing
[1:11:07] communion
[1:11:08] what am an amazing feast
[1:11:12] all the supernatural significance of god
[1:11:15] standing there
[1:11:17] feeding his servant
[1:11:19] and abraham knowing this is the king of
[1:11:21] the city that he's looking for
[1:11:23] and it creates this longing in his heart
[1:11:26] to find it
[1:11:28] isn't that what this word is doing for
[1:11:29] you today
[1:11:31] creating in you a longing
[1:11:33] think of it maybe just to wet your
[1:11:34] appetite i realize now i could have
[1:11:36] preached uh three sermons
[1:11:39] i came up here with notes enough for two
[1:11:40] and i preached him in
[1:11:42] very quickly i went way too fast i
[1:11:44] apologize and that awesome i'm
[1:11:46] apologizing for being short now
[1:11:48] god's good miracle-working god
[1:11:53] this
[1:11:55] this story that's being portrayed
[1:11:57] and what god's trying to express to us
[1:11:59] is so that we can relate
[1:12:01] to have faith in this end time
[1:12:04] and so think about this i'll just lay
[1:12:06] this out there is we want i want to go
[1:12:08] into this area
[1:12:09] maybe wednesday next sunday
[1:12:12] when abraham finally did receive that
[1:12:14] seed
[1:12:16] the the natural son isaac which isn't
[1:12:18] this but it's the sun that was promised
[1:12:20] sarah's son his name shall be isaac
[1:12:23] when it came time to find him a wife
[1:12:26] where does abraham send his servant
[1:12:29] to go get a wife
[1:12:31] babylon
[1:12:33] he goes right back into chaldea
[1:12:36] what to get a bride
[1:12:37] out of babylon
[1:12:40] so that you could relate perfectly
[1:12:42] with what god's doing in this end time
[1:12:45] he's called you out of babylon to be
[1:12:48] married to jesus christ he's called you
[1:12:50] away from there's no way you can turn
[1:12:52] where you have the excuse to say in
[1:12:53] sodom no excuse to stay in egypt no
[1:12:56] excuse to stay in babylon that's not
[1:12:58] where it takes place it takes place in
[1:13:00] the opening of the word it takes place
[1:13:02] in the presence of jesus christ it takes
[1:13:04] place in the promised land you've got to
[1:13:06] come out of it
[1:13:07] oh could we wake up today to hear his
[1:13:10] voice to come out of sin to come out of
[1:13:12] unbelief to come out of politics to come
[1:13:14] out of popularity to come out of pretest
[1:13:17] you come out of all the things that
[1:13:18] relate to babylon into dying with your
[1:13:21] king today
[1:13:23] could we stand on our feet
[1:13:27] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:13:31] melchizedek came down
[1:13:38] and served communion in the very spot
[1:13:43] that the city he longed to look for
[1:13:44] would come down
[1:13:47] and now in this end time he's come down
[1:13:49] into the very city in a spiritual way
[1:13:51] the bride of jesus christ to serve you
[1:13:54] i hope you can be encouraged today
[1:13:56] by these things could we bow our heads
[1:13:58] in a word of prayer
[1:14:08] if you have a need in your heart today
[1:14:11] i encourage you just to lift your hands
[1:14:12] to him
[1:14:16] lift it to him now
[1:14:18] trust him
[1:14:20] you can trust him
[1:14:23] i realize that there's things maybe that
[1:14:26] were ministered today that seemed
[1:14:29] they may have seemed very dry
[1:14:33] or
[1:14:37] just
[1:14:41] maybe difficult to relate to
[1:14:43] but i i trust that the lord is dealing
[1:14:45] with your heart now and you know
[1:14:47] what he's trying to say to you
[1:14:50] i believe he's calling us all
[1:14:53] completely out of babylon
[1:14:56] if there's the presence of anything
[1:14:58] wicked or vile
[1:15:01] then god wants to destroy it as he did
[1:15:02] sodom and gomorrah
[1:15:05] let's just yield ourselves to him today
[1:15:07] our gracious heavenly father
[1:15:10] lord as we stand in your divine presence
[1:15:12] we stand as a needy people
[1:15:15] and i recognize that there's sick bodies
[1:15:18] there's encumbered minds there's family
[1:15:19] situations that are broken up
[1:15:23] there's weaknesses of our flesh that we
[1:15:25] can't seem to outpace or get away from
[1:15:28] lord there's broken hearts there's
[1:15:30] troubled spirits there's
[1:15:32] grieving families
[1:15:35] lord and i believe that today regardless
[1:15:37] of what our particular vantage point is
[1:15:40] we can look to you and find what we have
[1:15:42] need of
[1:15:44] there may be some that need to look to
[1:15:45] you now as a comforter some that need to
[1:15:47] look to you as a deliverer
[1:15:50] some that need to look to you as a
[1:15:51] healer may that be what they see lord
[1:15:55] though we look
[1:15:57] from different vantage points and see
[1:15:59] something different
[1:16:01] we're looking at the same thing
[1:16:03] that's what i want to point
[1:16:05] who i want to point my finger to today
[1:16:07] lord
[1:16:08] at the close of this service
[1:16:11] is you who is working in the life of

[1:16:53] leave
[1:16:55] and lord we may be aware of a lot of
