TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that is such a a remarkable reading and there's a lot there that we could Fellowship on in that and we'll come back to it here in just a few moments but I'd like just to reset our subject on a Place full of mercy and I've HED that through the last several Services we've been able to see with an honest look at the message of the hour and the scriptures that are being fulfilled that we're living in a moment when mercy is of great concern that when we see uh the totality of things and the finality of things and we see the IM of a body change and uh the signs around us everywhere then we know that uh Mercy becomes a very critical question and it's the question that brother brandham had when he preached uh the souls that are in prison now and he's probing and he's even asking questions could it be and it's because judgment was striking and brother B makes those statements how that judgment is striking that the Judgment hour of judgment is at hand and these are things that brother brandham was saying in his ministry uh preaching the Flash ing red lights and God doesn't send a warning God doesn't judge a man until he first sends a warning and so brother bram's using a language in a lot of his sermons still preaching some Evangelistic and still trying to bring the the whole message in a way to where uh people could understand what God had been doing in the church ages and all the different facets of God's Great Beauty but yet in there he's mentioning things to get people's attention about the the urgency of the time that we're living in I think the sermon the token would be a very good one to see where brother Ms I identifying this great need and get under that token get under that token the hour of judgment is striking and get under that token and then desperations because it was in a time when that that plague is coming that Death Angel is going to pass and you needed to be under that token in order to be rescued and I want to use tonight just uh will'll be very focused on if I could say it this way on how Mercy works of course I there's just no way you take a Wednesday night and tell you everything about how Mercy works and and uh don't get too superstitious if you've come across the word mercy in the last few weeks as you've been studying your Bibles that doesn't vindicate me CU it's everywhere uh you know there just really you know he preached about Jesus and I saw that in my Bible he he must be Vindicated uh but there's uh I want to look at how Mercy works by looking specifically at Paul this uh juncture in the Apostle Paul's life so it's going to be focused I think but there's just a lot of breath that the Holy Spirit can give to you tonight now in Ephesians 2:4 I want to start with this I do encourage you to go listen to the sermon The God Who is rich in Mercy January 19th 1965 right here in Phoenix at the westward hoe he says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us he said the greatest thing is being rich which is abounding in Mercy or kindness and more than material possessions and more than wealth and more than all those things that if we could uh that God being rich in Mercy should mean more to us than anything else else and we know that mercy God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us if we look there in the context of Ephesians chapter 2 we see that Mercy came in the form of Jesus Christ in that Paradox of him being a substitute of the atonement for us so God has Mercy on us because of our sins by bringing satisfying or appeasing his wrath or judgment in Christ so Christ was that form of Mercy or he contained that Mercy as being the atonement himself or The Substitute now I want us to just start right there with God who is rich in Mercy and he sends us Jesus Christ so let's look at Romans chap 3: 19- 26 as I was going through these scriptures this week I thought well this is just really like a a Bible study or a Sunday school lesson but a lot of times I heard we're just going to have a Sunday school lesson kind of just to signal to us we're going to get out of here pretty quick uh but I don't necessarily look at it that way uh but this is just real focused on scripture tonight and I hope there's a lot that you can grab a hold of verse 19 now we know that what things soever this the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God so there's this idea of all men being guilty and it puts men in this precarious situation especially whatever the law says we all guilty before God therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin it's a a unique facet of the law that Paul brings up and how that the laws is what gives us a consciousness of sin and the law is what condemns us and the law tells us that we really can't govern ourselves we need something else to restrain us and so all that the law can do is give us a knowledge of what is wrong and uh we try yet we're guilty before God by it and no flesh is justified by the law well that's all that Israel was under was the law so he says but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested now what was that how is it manifested we know it's manifested in Jesus Christ being witnessed by the law and the prophets which pointed to Christ we see that in the scripture even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe so the righteousness of God Is by faith through Jesus Christ in them that believe there's your formula of faith in Jesus Christ and there's this righteousness of God which you gain through believing in Jesus Christ he says for there is no difference verse 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God but we so we can all of us being in sin we can only have the righteousness of God through Jesus Christ and our faith in him so this is our way to being accepted by God by being right before God being correct or Justified or uh being deemed right and correct before God so he said says verse 24 being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus by faith uh which faith is by Jesus Christ is through Jesus Christ you just see this pattern here now speaking of Christ Jesus is whom God hath set forth to be a pritu through faith in his blood now there's a a a phrase there he has been set forth as this propitiation through faith in his blood so he can't be this perpetuation without faith faith in it through faith in his blood to declare righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God so it's this longsuffering of God a forbear he was he he he didn't judge he didn't condemn so there's this forbearance of God and then he declares this remission of sins of sins that are passed through faith in this perpetuation through faith in his blood he has set forth as a perpetuation then he says says in verse 26 to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus so how is one Justified how is one right or correct through faith in Jesus Christ through faith in his blood and through by the faith of Jesus Christ we are partakers of the righteousness of God through uh by this work of the calvary the sacrifice that was made this word perpetuation I know you've probably heard this before even ourselves having recently referred to it uh it's kind of a it's a word maybe if you say too often you start getting a little bit of a list but perpetuation it's a means of appeasing so if someone's angry it's plating it's satisfying and so it's a means of s appeasing someone's wrath or anger or something that's being required an example would be the blood of a sacrifice that was shed under the law was a pretu it was a means of appeasing or satisfying a requirement and perpetuation comes from the root word to be merciful or to make reconciliation to show Mercy or be merciful is what is meant in this word he has set him forth to be a pritu a means of appeasing and since there was a means of satisfying a means of appeasing that is done through Mercy that is done in being merciful and it's used of the cover of the Ark in the most holy place which was called in some places the lid of propitiation so this is a when he said he set him forth to be this it it's referencing even that special place in the holiest of holies the most holy place this lid of pritu this Ark uh of the Covenant there between the cherubims and he said he set him forth to be a perpetuation in Hebrews chapter 9 verses 1 to5 so we could see this aspect in Jesus Christ it says then verily the first Covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly Sanctuary this is him showing these different uh outer Court inner Court uh would be this uh worldly Sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick and the table and the showbread which is called the sanctuary and after the second Veil The Tabernacle this is he shall hide me in the secret of his Tabernacle uh he shall set me up upon a rock there's in this uh there between the cherubims where God dwells this is that place that David longed to be after the second Ville the Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden sensor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold wherein was the golden pot that had mana and Aaron's Rod that budded and the TA tables of the Covenant what is he describing in the house of the Lord the most holy place where God dwelt and over it the cherums of Glory over of Glory shadowing The Mercy Seat notice how it's one word mercy seat of which we cannot now speak particularly this word mercy seat is the same exact word you used in Romans 3 perpetuation so he said whom God hath set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood we could read it and over it the cherubims of Glory shadowing the perpetuation of which we cannot now speak particularly or we could read it this way that God hath set forth to be whom Jesus Christ God hath set forth to be a mercy seat right now think of this what this means cuz I I I I this is very helpful for me just in my walk with with the Lord to understand cuz when we think Mercy seed I know we sometimes literally get this idea in our minds that there's a place set in heaven that is a chair and that as long as Jesus Christ is sitting in that chair there's mercy and so if he gets up like okay false along right and so it's almost like this thing he's like and he's just tempting us to think no mercy yes mercy no no no no but it's it's not that it's that God has declared Jesus Christ as The Mercy Seat he the place of reconciliation through faith in his blood he is a mercy seat through this work of Calvary he becomes this uh pritu this a means of appeasing and so in Jesus Christ God has set him forth to be a mercy seat so he is a place of judgment because he's going to judge the World by one man Jesus Christ but Jesus Christ has also been set forth as a means of reconciliation as a means of satisfying God's Wrath now let's turn to Acts chapter 17 we'll start where we did at the beginning in verse 22 we'll read on down to verse 31 again now let's just look at this how this Mercy is working I think it's wonderful to do this because in Reading in Romans and Hebrews we we see even according to Ephesians that something has happened and Christ has been set forth as a mercy seat and for sins passed and you wonder well this haven't happened since this has happened where do we stand right now what what's the uh what's the verdict are we all guilty before God and how does God condemn those past and those present and those future so Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said ye men of Athens I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious for as I passed by and beheld your devotions I found an altar with the inscription to the unknown God so this is the god they did not know so they're ignorant they have no knowledge of this God they're admitting it whom therefore ye ignorantly worship the one that you have proclaimed to be worshiping ignorantly I will declare him to you you've been praising God you've been worshiping God but he's not known to you he's an unknown God you've had these superstitions and these means of worshiping a deity that you didn't know but now I'm going to declare him to you so that you're no longer ignorant so whom you therefore have been worshiping ignorant I'll preach him to you and then he kind of gives this sermon God that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples made with hand so you're not going to find him here in your altars you're not going to find him in these worldly um edifices these are things that man makes neither is he worshiped with man's hands as though he needed anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things so he's clearly establishing there's one God who's above all and he hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the Earth and have determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation now we might be thinking wow this is kind of real Elementary but if someone believed in multiple deities and they they thought Venus was going to do this and Saturn was going to do that and all and not the planets but the gods and there was this idea of all these different mythical Gods he said no there's not a whole bunch of gods there's one God who made everything he's the god that's above all and he's set and determined all these bounds and he's caused by one blood not some from this deity and some from this mythology but by one blood we've come into this Earth and of all all mankind of of speaking of everyone says that they should seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us so it was in Man by thirst and by desire that God would that they would seek after him and if one would genuinely seek after him he said that they would find him because he's not far from us and he says for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring very it's neat to go back and find the different pop culture references that Paul was using in his time and the things that he would call back to that to somebody here in Athens would be like see what you did there right because there was he was uh he would be able to make it relatable to them I just find it really fascinating he said for as much then as we are also his offspring we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone Graven by Art in man's devices so we can't make him he doesn't need our hand hands he's declaring God to them and then he says and the times of this ignorance the times of this ignorant could be them thinking that the godhead is likened to gold or silver Stone by Art Graven by art or man's devices but we can say that the ignorance is certainly ignorantly worshiping him as in verse 26 whom you are ignorantly worshiping this one that you are ignorant of and you've had this time of ignorance I'm going to declare God to you he says the times this ignorance God winked at in other words there was a time when the fact that you were ignorant God didn't hold it to your charge that God let you worship ignorantly that God didn't judge you and that God was longsuffering and he was forbearing but now this God at one time was merciful if we could say that because of your ignorance but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent he's not just the god of the Jews he's not just the god of the mountains he's not just the god of the Israelites and the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he's a God to Those whom he calls to and who he beckons to and who he wants to draw upon so he commands all men everywhere to repent now why is he asked all men everywhere to repent because Heath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained wherefore he hath given Assurance unto all men and that he hath raised him from the dead and then they kind of mock him about the resurrection of the dead but Paul now sets forth this moment where those who had been ignorantly worshiping God and don't really know him and and honest about it that listen there was a time when your ignorant worship was get okay but now he has sent forth his son Jesus Christ and he's manifestly declared him to be the Christ and you have to believe upon him and through this sacrifice I know I'm adding maybe a lot more to the gospel as Paul would have taught it that by this uh by this pretu and by this sacrifice we're to repent of our sins we're to uh be identified with this sacrifice so he says he commands men everywhere to repent because one day all men are going to be judged in maybe not in this exact moment well I refuse to repent lightning strikes them and they're gone doesn't happen that way he's saying there's going to be a day and there's going to be a time appointed when we're all going to be judged and we're going to be judged by the attitude towards the word of God going to be judged by what did with the word of God or attitude towards the word of God and there's going to be some who when they're judged though they may not have uh fully received the word of God but they showed Mercy to those who were the word and mercy shown is Mercy given so there's a lot of things that work in the Judgment but we see here that there's going to be a time of judgment so God is God knowing that he's going to judge all men is saying okay now we need to repent then we need to repent in Acts chap 14: 16 it's a very short verse who in times past suffered All Nations to walk in their own ways who is this God God in times past or in times of ignorance allowed man to walk in darkness now what allowed him to do that was his longsuffering it was he wasn't being wishy-washy I there was I think Sunday morning I want to get into maybe more detail on this aspect of Mercy as we referred to it on Sunday and I thought i' just carry that thought on Sunday over to Sunday morning just uh put this in here for the Wednesday night uh Gathering is that God's mercy isn't weak it's it's not spineless it's it's not uh boundless in the sense that he has no standards so God in times past or in times past suffered All Nations to walk in their own ways he allowed men to walk in darkness there was a time when we could say that ignorance was an excuse and God was merciful because of that ignorance you can say well what what do you expect the Gentiles to do what do expect the reprobates to do they even have a hunger inside of them to worship something Beyond themselves and so that they're sincere and they're worshiping and sincerity and they're they're wanting to do right and they they're not necessarily looking to themselves but they're trying to make sense of the world it's the reason why you found all sorts of Nations and people worshiping different things because like man fire just ruined our entire Village and they worship the fire god like man if we don't get rain we're not our crops aren't going to grow so they worship the clouds and there was a way that they recognized they were behold into something Beyond themselves and they tried to appease it through offerings and chants and meditation so these were things that man could be doing sincerely but the hour had come when they were sincerely wrong yes because God is going to declare to them Jesus Christ and so God was merciful because there was no clear way made for them to be brought into fellowship with the one true God but we can say now Christ has forever consecrated this new way this new way had been made to receive the same Mercy that they received in their ignorance cuz what was God doing he was forbearing even to think that there's some that God has Mercy on and that they'd never heard the gospel and God isn't going to judge them by the fact that they haven't heard and that's mercy so now there's a new way it's a way to receive the same Mercy you would have had in ignorance you catch that I don't know if that's maybe a an odd way of distinguishing it but let's watch how it works with Paul in 1 Timothy chap 1: 3-16 this reading will contain one of my favorite phrases in scripture extra credit if you can guess what that is as I besought Thee to abide still Ephesus when I went into Macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other Doctrine neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith so do now the end of the Commandment is Charity of a pure heart and of a good conscience and a faith and unfeigned for which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling that just about describes it all these days vain jangling Desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor what they affirm but we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully knowing this that the law is not made for righteous man but for the Lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and for sin ERS for Unholy and profane for murders of fathers and murders of mothers for manslayers for whoremongers for them that defile themselves with mankind for MERS for liars for perjured persons and if there be any thing that is contrary to sound Doctrine he was on a roll he says according to the Glorious Gospel of the Blessed God which was committed to my trust Paul is such an amazing guy and he's just kind of just this burn list right whoremongers and them that defile them Stealers Liars perjured persons he's really and then notice verse 12 and I thank Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injures I he's just kind of gone through quite the resume of the Monger those that defile themselves with mankind for men Stealers Liars purged persons any other thing contrary to sound Doctrine to murders of mothers and fathers profane Unholy ungodly Lawless disobedient quite a Rowdy bunch a lot of vain jangling in those sentences Bas or sorts lwd fellows he says but I no so he says I'm a blasphemer persecutor and injures but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief now it may be saying this a little bit in a condescending way but I really want you to catch what he just said I was a blasphemer I was a persecutor and I was inous but I obtained Mercy something in this phrase you'll find in several places I obtained Mercy it's not so much something that's incidental but it's something that you receive that you carry the benefit of forever it's not just uh well you know Mercy in this instance and then mercy in another instance but it's something that is Everlasting I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly and unbelief now hold that in your thought and the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundantly with all faith and love which is in Christ Jesus he's saying to himself this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners of whom I am chief he he's even competitive I guess in some ways about who is the bigger sinner chiefest of Sinners and your Revelation added nothing to mine when I came amongst you he's uh and he says so he's chiefest of Sinner who was a blasphemer or persecutor in inous but he obtained Mercy because he did it ignorantly in unbelief now quite a statement I don't mean to make light of it but I really want you to see what he's setting forth and maybe look at it with some rawness to it because then he says how be it for this cause I obtained Mercy now why was Paul who was a blasphemer a persecutor he was a murderer too why was it that he obtained mercy and then he kind of adds this caveat but I was ignorant in my unbelief why did he obtain Mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should Hereafter believe on him to life Everlasting Paul is saying that God wants to use me to demonstrate how Mercy works that is a pattern not just for everyone but it's a pattern to those who will believe on Jesus Christ it is a pattern to those who were persecutors and blasphemers and injurers and murderers and profane people disobedient and Unholy they he I am a pattern to you that though you were deep in sin and you couldn't be the chiefest because he was the chiefest but though we be princes of sinning and almost the chief sinner he is saying that God wants to use me as an example of how his Mercy will work if you believe on him he says he's a chief sinner he claims and being a chief sinner who a blasphemer a persecutor and a murderer he claims ignorance as the reason for him obtaining mercy and not just the only reason why he obtained Mercy but that God dealing with Paul in his ignorance shows how God's mercy Works cuz notice Paul's not saying he's not up there as a continued persecutor he's not up there as a continued uh injures person to other people Paul is not doing the same things he did before and says God's been merciful to me isn't God wonderful right he's not necessarily just continuing to live in the Sin but he's saying that I'm an example of how God's mercy works the way that God dealt with me in my ignorance shows how God will extend Mercy to those who believe on him to everlasting life amen I'm not I wouldn't ask that you see it this way or demand that you know that this is your understanding as you read these scriptures but I would challenge you to search it and pray about it to un to catch why God was wanting to use Paul as a pattern to those of us who would believe after him to those who would come later and live lives that were sinful and find ourselves because Paul is not one that would claim ignorance like why didn't even know there was a God too late for that right I didn't even know there was supposed to be a messiah too late for that he said is touching the law blameless he was well taught he knew the law he knew the he knew the word he knew the requirements and he was very zealous in these things and he's an example of how God deals with people in their ignorance so let's look at Acts chapter 9 I just will choose to use this telling of the story verse one and Saul this is Paul now yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord now could you imagine if somebody kind of read his telling I was inous to people and I wasn't a very good guy and then you find out he's breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord Paul did not delete this tweet still here for everyone to read went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they be men or women he might bring them bound into Jerusalem wow okay he now wants to go into Syria he wants to go to Damascus and round up any Christians and these these synagogues these places of teaching and he wants to round up not just the men but the women and bring them bound to Jerusalem to kill him he's breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord so he goes and he asks for permission to persecute to hunt down all these so-called Christians so now he's got the papers and he's on his way verse three and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and In This Moment Paul recognizes God is revealing himself to him that this isn't he had too much to eat this isn't a a sorcerer trick he says who art thou Lord and the Lord said and this is a very beautiful phrase I am Jesus first uh red flag for him or it's in that moment he's like oh I think I messed up this isn't going to go well who are you Lord I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest Jesus is now at the right hand of the father on high God is revealed himself to him and he does it through Jesus Christ he says I'm Jesus whom you are persecuting and who was he persecuting how is he persecuting Christ through his body which was on Earth through those of that way that he was breathing out threatenings to and slaughtering the Disciples of the Lord were Christ on Earth that's why they called them Christians and Jesus says I am them whom you are persecuting is it hard for thee to kick against the Pricks was there something working so deep within the consciousness of Paul even in his subconscious where God was calling to him and the more that he called to him the more he fought against it the more he wrestled with it and he trembling and astonished said Paul is just broken in these very short moments Lord What wilt thou have me to do I imagine I I don't I I I I'm not I wouldn't just say well this is all that was said and it would be certainly acceptable to think that maybe there was more going on or more time or more wrestling and maybe it wasn't just immediate but maybe there's some agonizing moments going by but notice Paul is caught up in this moment who are you Lord Elohim yahovah who are you I'm Jesus you're persecuting me is it hard to keep fighting against this thing that's prodding your conscience and he says he he's resigned Lord what wil thou have me to do he said you're not Jesus you know just he just said what would you have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City so he's going to continue to Damascus and it shall be told thee what thou must do Christ reveals himself to a blasphemer he reveals himself to a persecutor he reveals himself to some to someone who is breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord and is on his way to do it and his response is well what would you have me to do and this is what Paul is pointing out when he says he is a blasphemer when Paul uses the term blasphemer we're not talking about people who say well I prefer a Chevy and the Ford guy is like blasphemy right you know you drive an electric car blasphemy that we just use the term so loosely but in Leviticus 24:16 he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord he shall surely be put to death who art thou Lord I am Jesus whom thou persecutest Leviticus 2416 comes into play and all the congregation shall certainly Stone him as well the stranger as he that is born in the land when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord shall be put to death if anything this is what Paul thought he was enforcing as this Zealot as this one after the order of penhos said I'm going to follow after and hunt down all these people who blasphemed the name of the Lord by saying Jesus Christ is the Lord by saying Jesus was the Messiah I'm going to put him to death according to the law and Paul by saying he's a blasphemer has put himself guilty himself and we notice that it was the Holy Ghost working in the Disciples of the Lord it was Christ making himself known and revealing himself to these disciples and Jesus says in Matthew 12:31 wherefore I say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men they are in danger of Hellfire the Bible says them that would blaspheme the Holy Ghost it in this moment that a lot of people point out that Paul says he was a blasphemer that his blasphemy was of the Holy Ghost which Jesus said it shall not be forgiven unto men and Paul yet asserts that me as a blasphemer as a persecutor as one who harmed the body of Christ and breathed out threatenings and actually murdered Stephen and these this blood is on my hand and I'm guilty of the blood of the CH children of God I did so ignorantly and obtained Mercy that I might be an example to others so as we continue to read his testimony in this moment of Contrition who are you what should I do tells him to go arise and go to Damascus and I'll show you what to do verse 7 and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but see no man and Saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were open he saw no man but they led him by the hand so he's blind even though he could physically open his eyes and all were still there he could not see but they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus and he was three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananas and to him said the Lord in a vision ananas he said behold I'm here Lord so there's a is he says ananas calls him ananas recognizes it to God behold I'm here Lord and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for behold he prayeth so Paul is praying he's seeking L he's responsive to he he's uh pouring his heart out to God because he's in this Mo state of Contrition knowing that God's revealed himself and Paul hath seen in a vision a man named ananas coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight then ananas answered Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy Saints at Jerusalem now I guess I could make a lot of jokes here and try to put it modern language but he's saying Paul Saul of Tarsus has been murdering disciples and you want me to show up as a disciple and say yeah uh I'm a Christian and he's and God says and so he says here here he is he knows he's heard and here he hath Authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name so here's that that role of black blasphemy and this this uh this those that blaspheme the name of the Lord we're going to put him to death we're going to Stone him he said he's got papers to do that I would be one that's guilty but the Lord said unto him verse 15 go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake and ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul Wow Wow for ananas to be able to do that I don't know what he had to overcome I don't know if ananas ananas has some pretty good details about what he's done to the Saints at Jerusalem and knew enough that he was there with papers to take care of them could have ananas L lost loved ones could he suffered great harm and when it goes he doesn't extend his hand and be like well Mr Tarsus right he says brother Saul the Lord Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest so he knows he's speaking what the Lord has showed him has sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost now I want you to imagine this Paul the Apostle Paul I could kind of get lost in this particular reading right here but I really want you to catch this here's Paul that God's going to use before Kings before Gentiles to the children of Israel and he's going to show them things to come he doesn't give him the Holy Ghost on the road to or on the road to Damascus doesn't give it to him then he blinds him doesn't fill with the Holy Ghost then he says what I'm going to do is I'm going to have ananas come from the those one that is in the way one that you would have killed or dragged to Jerusalem and soon murdered and stone I'm going to have him come and lay his hands on you and speak the word to you that you might receive your sight I have come at his request to pray for you that you might be filled with the Holy Ghost verse 18 and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight for withth and arose and was baptized in the name of Jesus and when he had received meat he was strengthened then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus man I can't wait to hear the stories in straight way he preached Christ in the synagogues he shot up in Damascus to go to the synagogues with papers to murder them all he was going to judge them going to drag them all back to Jerusalem to have him stoned and he shows up and he's going to reveal the new Shalom the new place of Peace the real king of kings he's going to preach to him Christ right there in the very same synagogues where he would have brought papers of condemnation he's now preaching Christ the son of God but all that heard him were amazed and said is this not he that destroyed them which called on his name in Jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring forth them bound to the chief of priest I just think of that Meme with that kid holding holding that styrofoam Kip like he kind of overhears it he's like they know yeah they knew here he was this is the one that destroyed them which called on his name in Jerusalem who called us blasphemers and he came to Damascus that he might bring us bound back to Jerusalem ultimately to Stone us and now he's preaching Christ yeah certainly this is is a ruse right he's trolling us right if we say Amen does that mean he that's how he finds us out like if we agree he's like Jesus is the Christ and we're like if we say anything like don't say anything this is a trick I mean we really do need to get ourselves in our their shoes about how peculiar this would be They're All Amazed isn't this the one that was going to murder us has he not murdered before but Saul and increase the more in strength and confounder the Jews which dwelt dwelt at Damascus proving that this is very Christ this is very Christ my if I could say it this way when Paul excuse me when God or Christ made himself known to Paul Mercy was extended right in that very moment he was a murderer he was a blasphemer and he would have done more but God shows up what' he do he told him go to Damascus and he gave Paul's praying now as he's in Damascus and God gives him a vision of what to do next and what did God say I'm going to send you ananas and this is what he's going to do and what I what we can take from this and I believe this is absolute solid that we could take this and I I imagine brother elzer you could just see this so plain that God Saul is O obeying go to Damascus where did he go he went straight to Damascus and now he's praying because he's going to be shown what to do next I'll show you what to do so he's praying Lord show me and God shows them ananas is going to come and you let him pray for you and you let him baptize you and you call on the name of the Lord and you repent and these are the things that's going to happen and Paul was obeying the revealed word at every opportunity and where did he find Mercy in Jesus in the very body that he was persecuting in the very one that he would have put to death that's where he found the mercy because God didn't necessarily Grant it to him there when when the light overshadowed him and men were hearing voices and Paul is struck blind but he had to send ananas who had the spirit in him whom God had been communing with and ananas is the one that extends this Mercy to Paul God had to have somebody there to give Paul the opportunity and the reason why we still read of Paul in the manner that we do because Paul in his state in his broken State and in whatever character he had in him at the time to accept it and listen there's a lot a lot of people who would be lesser men to Double Down on their persecution double down on their platitudes double down on their religious exercises double down on their pretense and continue to defame and blaspheme the message of the hour by preaching false Doctrine and pedling their own self-righteousness but Paul in that moment was broken he said what do I need to do and he said go have this this one who's in the way because he's the way that you can receive Mercy and then God did this Acts chapter n so that we could understand how God's mercy Works how that we obtained Mercy even in a time in a moment where it seems God's commanding men everywhere to repent ignorance was an excuse until now up until this moment this worked but now that this has happened God's Mercy is available but only as he offers it and brother brandham says in the sermon The God Who is rich in Mercy now that's the only way to obtain Mercy is to follow the instructions that God has give us to follow in brother John I think it's there and the next all these quotes I'm going to be using all come from uh I hope I did put it in there God rich in Mercy now that's the only way to obtain maybe I didn't put this one in there that's the only way to obtain Mercy is to follow the instructions that God has given us to follow in that's the only way he can show Mercy is when we follow what he said do think of this now if I could say anything brother brandham is established in this not that we would go back and do an autopsy on ages past not that we would try to figure it out while in the days of Hezekiah no we just want to look at it right now in our time the only way to obtain Mercy is to follow the instructions that God gives us to follow Paul did exactly that Paul was right up to a very moment up to a Time time when Jerusalem ceased and now Paul is continuing in this old way continuing under the law he's one of these zealots who would have been recognized as someone who is very zealous for the cause of Yahweh whom Jehovah would shine his favor upon Israel because you stood for righteousness and you you Stone Those blasphemers and you hold it held tight to the law but now God reveals himself to Paul and Paul needs to follow the instructions that God gives and that's why Paul obtained Mercy brother B said God is rich in Mercy Mercy to those who will follow after him not after a Creed but after God brother Bron preached this in 1965 and I believe it was necessary for him to be able to emphasize where this place of Mercy is I don't think he would take back anything he had preached to that point after those seals are opened wouldn't water down any of it as a matter of fact he continues to reinforce to reinforce and to make clear and make clear these events that have transpired and how serious they are not that we would get mysterious about it mystical and weird but this is just the reality this is the way it is and now he's pointing us to God's instructions I think this one's there it says and the whole human race would have been wiped out at that time but God rich in Mercy he's talking about in the days of Noah God rich in Mercy would not let the innocent perish with the guilty okay now how does that work and he went away and made a provided way for the ones that wanted to come in that wanted to do what was right he made a way of Mercy for those who desired mercy and he prepared an ark Moses was a witness excuse me Noah was a witness and a testimony he gets to Moses here in a minute what was he testifying judgment's coming here's a way out remember he talks about them being locked in that Ark God shuts the door as the raindrops fall and there it sits for a moment as a witness to them before they're over overcome by judgment he he said in other words he put some wings on his Eagles that they could fly above the judgment and not drown with the chickens but he made a way of Escape in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Noah this caused him to do that to provide it because he was rich in Mercy notice that God being rich in Mercy doesn't mean wow the imagination of men is only evil continually and their sins have reached under heaven and his imagination is just filthy and ungodly and but I'm just so full of Mercy carry on there came a time when he said no enough's enough un lest I cause all the innocent to perish with the guilty I'll give him witness he continues later he says he made a provision for those who wants to be redeemed he made a provision for those who wants to be healed and that because that he did this makes him rich in Mercy as he has always been rich in Mercy it must be if you refuse this there's nothing left but the Judgment because sin must be judged I believe that's the phrase that we could really zero in on if you refuse this God is rich in Mercy he's always been rich in Mercy but now God provides a way and the only way to obtain the mercy that he's rich in the only way to obtain the mercy that he wants to abundantly Supply is to follow the provided way to obtain the mercy brother bradam says this and today friend the only way that we can ever have favor with God God is rich in Mercy today but we've got to respect what he said about it you can't take what somebody else said you got to take what God said he said let every words be every man's word be a lie and mine true today we're told all you have to do in many places is join church have a Creed and something like that or say a prayer or put your name on a book or be sprinkled or baptized a certain way or something like that that's all you have to do but that's wrong I love this part because that sentence just could have kept going on and on and on in that same accent to be an eagle of God you've got to follow the word day by day you've got to continue feed upon the word as we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all unrighteousness it's only under that bleeding bloody word it's only under that dripping word that word which is being crucified again in this hour it's only under that light am that we continue to have this fellowship and it says you're an eagle if you continue to feed upon that word that seems to maybe nail it down pretty tight what the standard is and say well what if I make a mistake well just get up up keep walking in the light Don't Turn back don't forsake it don't give up God is rich in Mercy today but we've got to respect what he said amen just pulling some of these things together and I could emphasize this in place after place after place after place and we maybe will'll get to it in the scripture on Sunday how that God's Mercy is available to those who fear Him God's Mercy is renewed and it's granted and it covers those who keep his Commandments and that's this Mercy is available but Mercy isn't going to be available to the one who continues to refuse and to reject truth the one who continues to refuse Mercy when it looks him in the face let me use this statement in closing he says God is the word and it was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now that he might bring forth the other attributes of God take time to listen to this sermon The God Who is rich in Mercy listen to it coming up on an anniversary of it 60 years next month or excuse me in January next year and I just think I've just been going through it so full so full of beautiful statements and he says the body Jesus was the body of God an attribute so Jesus was an attribute of God uh and and he is set forth to to bring forth these other attributes and then he says Moses seen him pass the back part of him no man had seen his his face but now we see him we have beheld him see him as the sacrifice now he was an attribute of God being displayed the word that's what he was now if we could keep in our minds the image of Acts chapter n and when any believer comes to God he becomes God's attributes attribute of his word he's used to manifest the word that's promised for that day that's right God rich in Mercy has never left left us without a testimony he's rich in Mercy and brother brandham in the sermon talks about how Moses was a testimony of righteousness Noah was a testimony God never left us left us without a testimony and here's Paul who is a blasphemer a murderer he was one that should have known better as touching the law blameless and was out to kill more Christians and what did God do he sent him ananas as a bear of God's mercy Paul under his own convictions had blasted fed the name of God and should have been subject to the punishment he carried out on Stephen but God rich in Mercy didn't leave him without a testimony and he used ananas to manifest the word that was promised for that day and he does it yet the same today there must be a voice and a witness and a testimony of Mercy in this hour even to those who are ignorantly worshiping I I'm hold I've been holding back this statement but just keeps pressing in my heart as I as I preach brother Brown when he preaches the revelation of Jesus Christ which is a church a series when he preaches he says there's an hour coming when you're sincerely wrong in other words you're sincere you're sincere but there's an hour coming when your sincerity will no longer count on and all this sincerity and all this effort and all the platitudes and everything you're doing God may be uh in it now and God may be blessed in it now and God may bring forth fruits out of it now and God may be able to meet you where wherever you are in these things now but there's going to become a time when your sincerity no longer matters and you're wrong and you've got to repent you've got to come out You' got to accept the truth you can't accept the Fable of what they've made Jesus Christ into and this applies to all not just those who don't believe the message because there's a lot of message Believers who've turned it into fables just the same amen I'm so glad he's rich in Mercy in Matthew 12:31 we read it a moment ago wherefore I say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men just going pushing a little bit further tonight because we have the time not going to be much longer at all but this blaspheming the Holy Ghost is the unpardonable and it's always been debated and I think within the Catholic Church they have different well suicide is the unpardonable sin there's different things you can do that if you terminate a life these things that you can never be forgiven or if you pay enough money maybe it can be but brother B said what is the unpardonable sin to reject truth when it's presented to you why because if you reject truth you reject Mercy because truth doesn't say Rowan you never did anything wrong ever you're fine you're okay you don't need to change a thing that's not how it works the truth says all men have sinned and come short of the glory of God the truth said that God's a just God that the truth begins to tell us as Paul did let me declare unto you the truth this God whom you've been ignorantly worshiping let me now remove your ignorance and make you accountable and now you're going to have to make a decision so the unpardonable sin it just to me makes so much sense to reject truth when it's presented to you he said you'll fight your way to Hell says it's not easy to go to hell you have to reject truth as they sang on Sunday there is a cross in the way full of Mercy full of Truth full of grace and most people want Mercy apart from truth they want Mercy apart from righteousness yeah they can say I don't want God's justice I want his Mercy but they don't want any of his truth and so that where there is freedom where there is Liberty from bondage where there's an appeasing uh God's Wrath is in the truth Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free Brothers Adam said God rich in Mercy has pulled us out of that chaos and let us see it before the thing hits here before the Judgment hits he lets us see the chaos of Babylon he lets us see the chaos of organized religion he lets us see the chaos of false Doctrine human Traditions lies and dishonesty he pulls us out of the chaos before it hits us and if you want to take time to go through the message of the hour to find these things that brother BR begins to emphasize he emphasizes the these things to support this this truth that Mercy can be found there's mercy found but it's in his instructions it's in God's only provided place of worship it's in it's in the in the token it's in these different things he begins to point us to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever who's revealing himself and he's preaches these things it is the rising of the sun who is this mezic he begins to preach sermons to get us to recognize this is where God is revealing himself Sauls of tarus recognize now what you need to do to recognize God who's stopping you on your on Damascus he's shining his light to you he's revealing himself to you he says he that believes not the full word of God is a sinner and we know according to the the word of God that the full word of God is Born Into manifestation this is why it meant so much to brother Bram even when he's preaching souls in prison now he says that the truth is presented to us through the opening of the word says it's opened up the entire Bible that what he tells us and he says in souls in prison I he says when the truth is presented to a person for the last time and they refuse to rece receive it according to the book of Hebrews there's not anything left in the world that can save them they're finished no repentance No Redemption there's nothing left for them and when truth of the Gospel has been proven thoroughly Vindicated and turn around and walk away from it they're finished he says it's awful but I have to tell it now you can put all sorts of spin on it you can say well if you don't accept the truth that William brandom's coming back in an airplane then you're lost and you're finished well okay and if he doesn't are you lost and are you finished and he say yep and say man I would trust in a shed blood of Jesus Christ more than I would a rickety old aircraft yes I'm going to I'm going to hold to the word which he promised I'm going to hold to the word which has been revealed I'm going to take it into my bosom and I'm going to hold to it I'm going to cling to this Jesus Christ that's been revealed to me I'm going to get away from the scarecrows that that try to make it blasphemy to believe in Jesus Christ they make it blasphemy to hold to the the blood of Jesus Christ to look into the word of God and recognize the things that are happening in this day listen there's a lot of people that have used this own personal gain and benefit at the cost of people's lives and their and their their tenderness and their virtue and they stand today as scarecrows to Jesus Christ the the the things that have been committed by the Catholic Church the things that have been committed by Mormonism and the names of all sorts of prophets have been used by filthy perverted ungodly men to build their own kingdoms and persecute and Destroy and harm people who've been sincere yes exactly and it's caused people to run away and flee from things naming Jesus Christ or naming and teaching things that pertain to the scripture or things associated to the ministry of William brandom and I believe there's got to be a voice of Mercy in this hour that's not identified with the defilers that's not identified with the false prophets that doesn't attach itself to some name but comes back and says yes Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever am amen believes in Redemption believes in the purity of the Gospel yes believes in R religion pure and undefiled that would believe that these things in their purity come to a place where we will Express the character and nature of God out of a pure heart an unpretentious love a clear conscience God help us I I I I just I just I'll just say it and I I I'm not saying this as a clickbait title to shock you but it's controversial in some circles to say Mercy's in the bride brother BR said the mercy seats in your heart he goes into great detail these are the very things I've been tracking the very things I've been trying to find a way to bring it out so we could see that these things are scriptural and what is what is say now he's put up a scarecrow puts up a scarecrow to it so we'll keep our mouth shut and think that we can have ceremony and we could have hands and all sorts of things that we do and God doesn't need our hands he wants our hearts if there's going to be a place of Mercy it's going to have to come from a pure heart and I believe I believe that we could say that there's things fulfilled in this hour that are a paradox and it sure looks like the lamb has come forward to take the book and loose the seals thereof and because he's done that some day of Mercy is over but as look into the word of God the prophet saying don't say there's no more Mercy yeah that day may be passed but I say there's still Mercy because I'm going to stand in this hour and I'm going to have a heart that sze and cries and I'll say Lord be merciful to The Sinner be merciful to The Backs slatter be merciful to those who need healing be merciful to those who need salvation and let my voice be a voice of Mercy amen and not just to those who are out there far from us but those the closest to me yes amen amen that I wouldn't just exhibit a a yo-yo of Mercy but I could find some way to be merciful to my children that don't yet have the Holy Ghost can't yet discern truth don't know how to live stable lives and their hones are out of control God helped me to be under Mercy we need it more than ever there's things that our children will battle their circumstances they might find themselves in that there was a day and age that if that cropped up in a church just kick them out right take people and beat them out behind a Woodshed people in the name of the message blooded their fist on young men who got caught doing certain things that wasn't Mercy that's right it was it was the blasphemy that Paul was guilty of but there's many that cannot claim ignorance God help us to not be guilty of the sins of Prior generations and stand for the righteousness of the word of God and take Jesus Christ into our bosom believe it with all that is in us and be a Place full of Mercy let's pray musicians come gracious Heavenly Father Lord I plead I plead for myself that you'd be merciful to me Lord I've I've made mistakes L growing up in a time when a lot of these things maybe weren't understood and people did the best they could and I've seen the Apostle worship I've seen the man worship I've been slapped in the face by men who called themselves Apostles I've been beaten Lord by those who named this message Lord there's scars and things in my past that have been buried that I probably don't even remember they carry in me the trauma Lord of Truth handled in unrighteousness but Lord I will not be used as an instrument to cry out against your mercy amen and I will not be used as an instrument of judgment but would softened my heart that I could cry all the more have mercy on them for they know not what they do and Lord I pray that you help us in this end time it's confusing time it's a lost time and Lord we hear voices and yet we'll hear them the more that this word is cultish it's abusive it's Sinister it's [Music] fleecing and Lord If we're honest with ourselves we can't say that that hasn't been done in the name of the message or in the name of William Bram but we have to answer for our hearts we have to answer for our Revelation our stand so Lord if we've done anything to profane this message if we brought any smut on it if we're not representing Christ well what can we do Lord show what show us what we must do Lord Heal us of our hurts and our complexes help us to not be instinctively angry or spiteful to those who cast down what we believe in and speak horribly of the things that we find precious but may we understand where one might be coming from and recognize that people with experiences that are very very real people who've traveled down paths that many of us will never know of they need Mercy just as much as we have received Mercy some may act today in a manner which is Blasphemous injures and persecuting and perhaps Lord they do it ignorantly that they might obtain Mercy Lord is what we would pray I believe there's coming a time when there will be no more no more voice no more truth there bit time as brother Brandon would say when that Rapture goes and when that Rapture takes us into another dimension in a changed body theophany to glorify it a meeting in the air it's sealed forever Lord the testimony of what they did and what they said how they acted and their attitude some having sealed their testimony with blood will find themselves on that day of judgment re receiving eternal life keep the door open Lord if it be but for just a few more days father help us to find lost souls help us Lord to empathize with others who are hurting may we not be hard-hearted and indignant and allow a righteous indignation to well up inside of us but just as brother brandham Cried Out Lord show us how to reach them show knows what to do and the right things to say I want to minister Grace not a Grace a brandom Grace or a tabernacle Grace Lord I want to be able to minister the grace of Jesus Christ I want to I want to be an ananas who could find that one who finds himself strick and blind now and is pleading oh God what must I do what must I do and be one that can be the Hands of Christ who prays and the scales fall from their eyes and they see you as you are and they receive the Holy Ghost yes I know that you're alive and well Lord I won't water it down I believe that Mercy exist today through Jesus Christ I believe that the blood is still effective but I do believe Lord that there'll come a time when people will reject you they'll reject you you and once they've rejected truth there's nothing left but judgment so let us be voices of Truth Lord not that we would cause judgment to come but that it would find the redeemed that it would find a heart who's at least willing just to believe in you and accept you hold fast to a profession Lord I know that end time of evangelism isn't just the Harvest of people who want to accept you as their Savior and confess you and be BT in the name of Jesus Christ we we could do that a lot as a program I know that's not what end time evangelism is but while we're still here growing and feeding on the word of God use us for Divine Healing use us for for those to see you to receive you and perhaps we'll find a lost soul in a Lex seed in this gleaning time bless us tonight as our service is soon dismissed be with us in our worship go with those who've been here tonight the weariness of the week and the demands of tomorrow morning cling to us they're right here in our face so father be gracious as they've been patient tonight I ask all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen let's stand
