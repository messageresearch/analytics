[0:00] We continue on the subject of wonder
[0:03] lust and wonder lost. Um maybe for some
[0:07] of the visitors here and different ones
[0:08] who are here for the first time, those
[0:10] phrases might be a little unique to you.
[0:12] Apologize if they remain somewhat
[0:14] mysterious as we go forward. But we're
[0:16] just looking at how in the age that
[0:18] we're living in and the way things are
[0:20] structured and the way that society is
[0:22] built that we're wanting to find wonder
[0:25] in Christ in an age which is full of
[0:27] wonder lust. And that wonder lust was
[0:29] just kind of speaking to a desire driven
[0:31] by desire. And so that's uh that's still
[0:34] under that that subject. My title today
[0:36] is a restless a restless mind. And
[0:40] hopefully I don't struggle saying it
[0:41] that that way. I might just change it to
[0:42] an uneasy mind if I get a lisp when I
[0:44] say restless. But uh I was going to call
[0:47] it a mind a mind at rest and a soul on
[0:50] fire. Uh but I really wanted just to
[0:52] spend some time today on the restless
[0:54] part of that mind and how it can just be
[0:56] so unnerved and unsettled. And so that
[0:59] would be our title today. Wednesday we
[1:01] spoke on a desire detox. And if you
[1:03] didn't hear that for the home folk here,
[1:05] I certainly would encourage you to go
[1:06] back and listen to that. uh we shared
[1:08] something in our hearts just even
[1:10] proposing to you as individual believers
[1:12] and as Christians uh to find ways to
[1:15] detox from desire where you're not
[1:16] always feeding the flesh and you're
[1:19] walking in the spirit and you're keeping
[1:20] your spirit sensitive to the things of
[1:21] the Lord. We looked at it from the
[1:23] standpoint of how that the constant
[1:25] stimulation that's provided to us by
[1:26] modern technology uh can be toxic that
[1:29] there's benefits in it. And there's
[1:31] great tools to use and they're very
[1:32] fertile uh and they provide us a lot of
[1:34] great things and they could reduce
[1:36] processes and they can allow us access
[1:38] to information and there's a wonderful
[1:40] things that can come from it. But in
[1:42] them there's always there's some levan
[1:44] in the world and technology and things
[1:46] there's always a levan that's in it and
[1:48] if you let leaven take root uh it'll
[1:50] pervade the whole thing and change
[1:52] things. So
[1:54] this technology is that it rewards us
[1:57] with these immediate but fleeting
[1:59] charges and and these dopamine rushes as
[2:01] we've talked about it. And since they
[2:03] can come so easily and we get rewarded
[2:05] when we do something with this little
[2:07] charge in our brains and some brain
[2:09] chemistry interacts uh it can once we're
[2:11] we get continually uh in that cycle can
[2:14] become an addictive bombardment. And so
[2:17] I encourage you to amen whether you're
[2:19] thinking about yourself or somebody else
[2:20] if it's true. and only if it's true. And
[2:24] what I what I want you to think about
[2:25] when we talk about a desire detox and as
[2:27] we go f further in a restless mind today
[2:30] as this uh it can become compulsive
[2:33] behavior because the stimulation of
[2:35] desire is constant. We read in the
[2:37] scripture how the Bible says the eye is
[2:39] never full of seeing nor the ear
[2:41] satisfied with what it hears. That it's
[2:43] never can be full. It's always longing
[2:45] and it can become compulsive because the
[2:47] desire is always there and it's never
[2:50] satisfied. And this is what's taking
[2:52] place for a lot of us when we use
[2:54] technology. We find ourselves waking up
[2:56] in the morning and as we make ourselves
[2:57] through our day even be till we go to
[2:59] bed that our mind's craving for novelty
[3:01] for something new and different and
[3:02] exciting. Uh for constant stimulation
[3:05] and even for immediate gratification uh
[3:07] creates that compulsion loop where you
[3:10] want it, you get it, you want it. It
[3:11] just keeps going over and over and over
[3:13] again. And if we could use what we were
[3:15] talking about Wednesday night, like drug
[3:16] addicts and lab rats, we can find
[3:18] ourselves needing more and more to get
[3:21] the same effect.
[3:22] And and we might think, oh, well, that's
[3:24] for drugs or that's for pornography.
[3:26] That that could be for all those things
[3:28] and some of these innocent things that
[3:30] we do day by day that are linked to
[3:31] technology and media and any kind of
[3:33] entertainment. And so the definition of
[3:36] detox that we're looking at is just to
[3:37] purge ourselves from these toxic things
[3:39] to it's a process or period when one
[3:42] abstains from something or rids their
[3:43] body from toxic things. If someone goes
[3:45] on a detox, if they're an addict, they
[3:47] remove all traces of an addictive
[3:49] substance. They get distance from some
[3:51] sort of addictive habit or action in
[3:53] order to overcome the dependence on it.
[3:55] So we're just using that thought in the
[3:56] natural in the world. This detox from
[3:58] desire and that you know even if I could
[4:01] say this as we this is kind of fits in
[4:03] with what we're thinking about. It's
[4:04] taking a break from something,
[4:06] right?
[4:06] Getting distance, being able to breathe
[4:08] and and letting your mind rest. It's
[4:10] important to let our minds rest at
[4:11] times. Now, in 1 Corinthians chapter
[4:14] 7:31, this was an important scripture we
[4:16] used on Wednesday night. This will kind
[4:18] of give us a real quick run through of
[4:20] some of the scriptures we were using
[4:22] then. And it says, "And they that use
[4:24] this world as not abusing it, for the
[4:27] fashion of this world passeth away."
[4:28] you. Paul is just being very astute to
[4:30] remind us don't get get connected to
[4:32] anything that is fashionable. Do not get
[4:35] tied to and depend upon anything in the
[4:37] world to bring yourself full
[4:38] satisfaction and joy.
[4:41] It'll change. If there's something you
[4:42] that gives you joy and it's solely of
[4:45] the world, it'll be gone. It'll be out
[4:46] of style. Uh just even if it comes to
[4:48] your favorite food, not maybe not too
[4:50] long till they ban it, right? They find
[4:52] out there's something synthetic in it
[4:54] and you're not allowed to eat it. And so
[4:55] whatever it is that you'd know that if
[4:57] it's of the world, he's telling you
[4:59] it'll pass away. So don't get too tied
[5:00] to it.
[5:02] And so this phrase using but not
[5:05] abusing, I mean, it's really remarkable
[5:07] language. It might even be to us modern
[5:09] parliament. And like that's something we
[5:11] would say today, but this the abuse is
[5:14] the overuse. That's what the the word
[5:17] means. It's just overuse. And so world
[5:19] abuse is just a compulsion to use the
[5:22] world for your happiness to your own
[5:23] detriment. Use it, but don't get your
[5:26] happiness out of it. Use it for what
[5:27] it's worth and for the necessities. Get
[5:29] out of it what you need, but don't look
[5:31] to that for your joy. Don't look to that
[5:32] for completion. And so, we use the
[5:35] world, but we don't abuse it. And the
[5:36] abuse is just to overuse it. And I think
[5:40] this is good to talk about addiction and
[5:42] addictive things and compulsive
[5:44] behaviors and compulsion loop and how
[5:46] we've been talking about how the mind
[5:47] works where when you get that feeling,
[5:49] you want to chase it, you want to feel
[5:50] it again. But they define addiction as
[5:53] just this relentless pull to any
[5:55] substance or activity that ultimately
[5:57] interferes with your daily life. And if
[6:00] you define it that way, there's a lot of
[6:02] addictions, right? Coffee can even be an
[6:05] addiction. And just like that, nobody
[6:07] wants to hear me anymore. But there's
[6:09] things that just become compulsions to
[6:11] us. And it would be any substance or
[6:13] activity that ultimately kind of to
[6:16] control you or you don't have control
[6:17] over and interferes with your daily
[6:19] life. And some of the markers of
[6:20] addiction, I don't want to get into
[6:21] great detail on this, have to do with
[6:23] control. Can you control it? Is there
[6:25] some compulsion to it? Are there
[6:26] consequences for that behavior? And even
[6:29] in using the phrase desire detox, we're
[6:31] wanting you to recognize that your mind
[6:33] and your spirit can crave for something
[6:35] that you don't even like.
[6:38] That dopamine mediates desire. It
[6:40] doesn't mediate joy.
[6:42] Doesn't mediate whether you enjoy
[6:44] something. Uh dopamine doesn't mediate
[6:46] uh happiness in a true sense. It just
[6:48] mediates desire. So it's something you
[6:50] would want but you don't love.
[6:52] And therefore it's even those things are
[6:54] addictive. Addicts can say, "I don't
[6:56] know why I do it. I don't even like it.
[6:58] I I don't even know why I do the
[6:59] mindless scroll and I get into zombie
[7:01] mode when I'm on TikTok and I and I do
[7:03] it for an hour without even thinking. I
[7:05] don't even like what I'm seeing. And I
[7:07] don't even like how I feel when I'm
[7:08] done." But yet you're still driven by
[7:10] compulsion to do it.
[7:13] And as Paul says that we ought to use
[7:14] the world but not overuse it.
[7:17] Ians 4:5 says, "Let your moderation be
[7:19] known unto all men. The Lord is at
[7:22] hand." And that word moderation, it's
[7:24] gentleness under provocation where one
[7:27] is able to restrain themselves and not
[7:29] act on what they're feeling. And we
[7:32] could look at in the context of
[7:33] relationships. We could look at it in
[7:35] the context of how you treat somebody
[7:36] who treats you. But the whole idea of
[7:38] gentleness and moderation speaks of
[7:40] being able to control your desires,
[7:42] being able to control your passions. We
[7:44] talk about moderation, the sense of of
[7:46] not being excess. We ought to be mindful
[7:48] of anything that would become excess.
[7:51] And this scripture here in Psalm 139:es
[7:54] 23 and 24. Appreciate your patience as
[7:56] we walk through some of these review
[7:57] things. Just felt they were important
[7:59] for context as we go forward.
[8:02] But it says, "Search me, oh God, and
[8:04] know my heart. Try me and know my
[8:06] thoughts." And this is an honest prayer.
[8:08] Being willing to be examined, being
[8:10] willing to be tried and tested. He says,
[8:12] "And see if there be any wicked way in
[8:14] me and lead me in the way everlasting."
[8:17] Wicked way. We might begin to think of
[8:19] evil and things that are awful and
[8:20] things that are foul, but the wicked way
[8:22] there is a manner or habit that has
[8:24] become a pain or offense. It's a manner
[8:27] or habit that is becomes hard on us and
[8:29] becomes difficult for us. Maybe it could
[8:31] be described as something that has sort
[8:33] of control over you that you don't have
[8:35] control over that you have compulsion to
[8:36] do and there's some consequence in your
[8:38] life. It says, "Search me, oh God, and
[8:40] know my heart, so that see if there be
[8:43] any wicked way." It doesn't have to be
[8:45] evil in a horrible way, but just
[8:47] anything that keeps us from the way
[8:49] everlasting.
[8:51] If I can say it this way, when we're
[8:52] talking about coming back to life,
[8:54] anything that keeps us from real living.
[8:56] Right?
[8:57] And just before I go forward into this
[9:00] subject today, as David was honest about
[9:03] saying, "Search me, oh God, know my
[9:05] heart. See if there be any wicked way in
[9:07] me." I just had this honesty uh to allow
[9:10] the Lord just to look inside his heart
[9:11] and find out if there's anything any
[9:13] manner or habit that doesn't tend to the
[9:16] way of life. He says,"I willing for you
[9:17] to examine me and try me so I could come
[9:20] out of that behavior, out of that wicked
[9:21] way, that manner or habit that is a pain
[9:23] or a burden and come into a way
[9:25] everlasting." They say that the greatest
[9:28] obstacle to overcoming any compulsion is
[9:31] our capacity.
[9:34] That's good. any any the greatest
[9:36] difficulty overcoming a compulsion is
[9:38] the capacity to rationalize our
[9:40] compulsive behavior. And if the Lord's
[9:43] been dealing with your heart, I feel
[9:44] like I could almost say, and I won't say
[9:45] it because I'm not going to pretend to
[9:46] be a prophet. Thus sayeth the Lord, you
[9:48] first tried to justify it.
[9:50] First tried to say, well, I kind of need
[9:52] that for work or I do it for this or I
[9:54] do it for that. And it's really easy for
[9:56] us. It's hard for us to admit we have a
[9:58] problem when we have a problem. And what
[10:00] is it they teach us? If you have a if
[10:02] you're if you're an addict, the first
[10:04] step is to admit you are one.
[10:06] And but I don't buy into the theology
[10:08] that says once an addict, always an
[10:10] addict. I believe in a God that can make
[10:11] you clean.
[10:13] But one of the biggest barriers to you
[10:14] overcoming compulsive behavior is is
[10:18] rationalizing it and justifying it so
[10:20] that you can continue in it. And if
[10:23] you're kind of just jumping in on part
[10:24] five and this sounds like you walked
[10:26] into an AA uh meeting or something,
[10:29] we're we're talking about the life that
[10:31] we ought to be living as believers
[10:33] and how all these things that have
[10:34] addict we become addicted to and all
[10:36] these things that have our time and
[10:37] attention and that we're always uh
[10:39] mixing ourselves up in has always served
[10:42] to cause us to lose the wonder of
[10:44] Christ.
[10:45] It's only caused us to not see the word
[10:47] of God in its beauty as we ought to.
[10:49] It's only caused the presence of Christ
[10:51] to become less valuable to us. And the
[10:53] things that are virtual, the things that
[10:55] are pretend, the things that are
[10:56] synthetic, have our attention and have
[10:58] our all instead of Christ
[11:00] who ought to be our all and all and
[11:02] ought to have our attention. And so
[11:03] that's been the thrust of the wonderust
[11:05] and the wonder lost.
[11:07] So a restless mind, when I talk about a
[11:09] restless mind, I want to inspire you as
[11:11] I was hoping to do Wednesday and even in
[11:13] this series is inspire us to find rest
[11:15] for our minds.
[11:17] and and in doing so rekindle that
[11:19] passion for God's word. Wonder lust. I
[11:21] use that phrase to kind of capture that
[11:23] restless mind that's constantly seeking
[11:25] after desire, constantly seeking for
[11:27] enjoyment in doing things that give them
[11:30] a synthetic reward but not true
[11:31] enjoyment.
[11:33] And when I talk about the mind, I think
[11:35] this is an important principle in the
[11:37] scripture and in the message of the
[11:38] hour. The mind is that which feels and
[11:40] wills and thinks and processes. It's
[11:43] that which has the intellect. It's our
[11:45] thought. It's our intention. It's our
[11:47] mental mental faculty. And that's when I
[11:49] talk about a restless mind, I'm talking
[11:51] about that part of our makeup, a part of
[11:53] our person. The mind is where the
[11:55] greatest battle ever is being fought.
[11:58] That's the that's the mind that we're
[11:59] talking about. And maybe we'll pick up
[12:01] on this on Wednesday, but we know, and
[12:03] I'm sure we all believe this today, the
[12:05] greatest battle ever fought is in the
[12:06] mind.
[12:07] But it's for the mind, too.
[12:09] It's not just in the mind. It's it's a
[12:11] battle for the mind. Satan chose the
[12:13] mind to do battle. God chose your heart,
[12:15] but when he chose your heart, he wasn't
[12:16] giving up your mind.
[12:18] The battle is in the mind because God
[12:19] wants to take it back over.
[12:21] Amen.
[12:22] And so, we have this battle in our
[12:24] minds. And you, it's important for us to
[12:25] realize that all the agendas of politics
[12:28] and economics and all the isms that are
[12:30] out there, their aim is to win your mind
[12:32] and your desires.
[12:34] They want to win your mind and win your
[12:36] passions. That's an economics. Uh
[12:38] there's not a company out there pushing
[12:40] green and pushing something that's good
[12:42] for the environment or pushing some
[12:44] story that they're not doing it in order
[12:45] to win your passion and win your desire
[12:47] so it can it can help them in the bottom
[12:49] line.
[12:50] It's that way with politics with
[12:52] economics. It's all a battle for your
[12:54] mind to get your attention and to drive
[12:56] you to a particular behavior. Right?
[12:59] And the the this focus on the mind is
[13:01] important because all of our emotions uh
[13:04] all our physical feelings originate in
[13:06] our brains and it's from there that it's
[13:07] distributed to the rest of the body.
[13:09] That's the physical process in our
[13:11] brains.
[13:12] And so when we think about our spirits,
[13:14] a lot of times to us that's something
[13:15] maybe we can't quite put our hands on.
[13:17] Our spirit, our heart, it's not maybe a
[13:19] physical part, but your physical brain
[13:21] plays a huge role in our state of mind.
[13:24] And in the there there's chemical
[13:26] processes there neural activity and
[13:28] that's what's making up your spirit.
[13:29] Your emotions, your feelings, your
[13:30] conscience, memory, reason, and
[13:32] affection can actually identify parts of
[13:34] the brain that light up in certain
[13:36] instances in certain thoughts and
[13:38] certain feelings. And if this is kind I
[13:41] think this is good for some review. It's
[13:43] that uh release of dopamine in our
[13:45] brains. Our brains are structured to
[13:47] release this dopamine for for certain
[13:50] behaviors. I just feel compelled maybe
[13:51] to go this path for a little bit that
[13:54] with certain behaviors there's a release
[13:55] of dopamine and it's there biologically
[13:58] in order to reinforce behavior.
[14:01] And so our brain uses dopamine as a
[14:03] reward system to reinforce behaviors
[14:05] that are essential to survival. And
[14:07] maybe that fight, the eat, to fight, to
[14:10] flee, they're supposed to signal and
[14:12] transmit messages to the brain in
[14:14] certain situations and to reward us for
[14:16] certain activity in order for survival,
[14:18] in order for necessities. And nowadays,
[14:20] we're not using the brain for that
[14:22] because all of our necessities are taken
[14:24] care of. Survival's been taken care of.
[14:26] So now that system is being hijacked for
[14:29] something it wasn't meant for. Amen.
[14:31] And these modern technologies, the
[14:32] substances, the activities, and all
[14:34] these things are tricking our brains
[14:36] about non-essential things because it's
[14:37] producing the same dopamine, but it's
[14:39] not essential to survival, but your body
[14:42] begins to act as if it is.
[14:44] That if you somehow aren't able to check
[14:46] Instagram today, you're going to die,
[14:48] right? And why do why do you feel that
[14:50] way? Like, this is killing me. Is
[14:53] because your body has released a
[14:54] chemical that used to tell you you need
[14:56] to eat or you're going to die. you need
[14:58] to run for your life because this animal
[15:00] catches you're going to die and now it's
[15:01] being misused and we kind of engage in
[15:03] these survival instincts to things that
[15:06] have no value in them whatsoever.
[15:10] And so it's because of this process that
[15:12] in our minds be we become to be restless
[15:16] that our minds begin to have cravings
[15:18] and desires and dependency and for
[15:20] cortisol for dopamine all these
[15:22] neuromodderators and neurotransmitters
[15:24] and all this neuro these are just fancy
[15:26] scientific words for your desire
[15:29] for your longings.
[15:31] And I'm sure I could get some amens if
[15:33] this if I say it right but the world has
[15:34] perfected the stimulation of our minds
[15:37] and this climax of Satan's Eden. They've
[15:39] perfected dividing our our minds and
[15:41] fragmenting our minds and getting us to
[15:43] hyperfocus on certain things. I read
[15:45] this in the book. It says the internet
[15:47] is designed to be an interruption
[15:48] system,
[15:50] a machine geared to dividing attention.
[15:54] So that's what it's for. It's there to
[15:55] divide your attention, to cause you to
[15:57] lose focus and be distracted. We
[15:59] willingly accept the loss of
[16:01] concentration and focus
[16:03] of our attention and the fragmentation
[16:05] of our thoughts in return for the wealth
[16:08] of compelling or at least diverting
[16:10] information we receive that we are
[16:13] willing to pay a price to get what we
[16:15] want in the interimm.
[16:16] We're willing to lose our attention.
[16:18] We're willing to lose our focus to get
[16:19] something in the interimm. And this is
[16:22] true. the the writer refers to the
[16:24] internet, but it's really just any
[16:26] platform uh connected information and
[16:28] communication technology, whether it be
[16:30] an iPad and all the apps that are on it,
[16:31] a cell phone or any other closed system
[16:34] that provides you access to information.
[16:36] All these things are working to divide
[16:38] your attention. And we've been willing
[16:40] to transact to pay the price of our loss
[16:43] of concentration, lo loss of focus, loss
[16:46] of deep thought to get something in the
[16:47] interim to satisfy us with this wealth
[16:50] of compelling things and wealth of
[16:52] exciting things. But it comes at a
[16:54] price.
[16:55] And I was thinking about this yesterday.
[16:57] This I don't know if I've ever mentioned
[16:58] this before, but when I knew God was
[17:00] calling me to start a church here, maybe
[17:01] there's a lot of things you start
[17:02] thinking about. Well, you know, what's
[17:04] the name of the church going to be? And
[17:05] are you going to have a mission
[17:06] statement? And what's the web address
[17:08] going to be? And you start thinking
[17:09] about I don't know why it all has to do
[17:11] with that but you start thinking about
[17:12] what are you going to you know what's
[17:13] what's going to be your vision what's
[17:14] going to be your burden and I adopted a
[17:16] social media policy before I did
[17:18] anything else. I don't know why, but it
[17:20] just came natural that there was I when
[17:23] we begin to think about what our vision
[17:25] was as a church, I realized it'd be very
[17:27] very shortsighted to occupy a presence
[17:30] on these social media platforms to
[17:32] disseminate information and get your
[17:34] story out because ultimately those
[17:36] platforms are designed to get people
[17:38] hooked to it.
[17:40] And I'm not going to be able to provide
[17:41] enough content to keep somebody happy on
[17:43] that platform.
[17:45] And so I didn't want to be anybody's
[17:47] reason for downloading Instagram. I
[17:50] didn't want to be anybody's reason for
[17:52] for having a pres, you know, for get
[17:53] logging on to Facebook and joining. And
[17:55] so I think that it's important for us to
[17:57] realize that these systems I don't want
[17:59] to be someone's reason for
[18:00] participating. And I think to do so is
[18:02] very shortsighted with just my person
[18:05] because of the way they're designed.
[18:08] Is my voice becoming more robotic?
[18:11] You don't this technology
[18:14] It's the It's the dopamine in our sound
[18:16] system.
[18:19] It's reaching cognitive overload. Well,
[18:22] what should I do? Should I have Ly be my
[18:23] interpreter? Should I grab a mic? I'm
[18:25] just waiting for you guys to say
[18:26] something.
[18:26] Yellow.
[18:27] Yellow.
[18:36] Oh boy.
[18:38] You'll probably hear me better, but my
[18:39] arm will be hurting in the morning
[18:40] because I just get nervous and I squeeze
[18:42] on it like this and I and I hope I can
[18:45] preach with one hand.
[18:53] What this statement is referring to and
[18:54] even what I'm thinking about in terms of
[18:55] a restless mind is we are experiencing
[18:58] endless access to knowledge.
[19:01] Endless
[19:03] access to knowledge. And now with the
[19:04] artificial intelligence uh that has
[19:07] seemingly endless access to knowledge,
[19:09] we can query it and we can invent things
[19:12] and create things that have never been
[19:13] conceived or put together before. And
[19:15] all this endless access to information
[19:17] easily overloads our minds whether we
[19:19] realize it or not. And it overloads our
[19:22] working memory where we're not able to
[19:23] retain things. It overloads our focus,
[19:25] so we're not able to concentrate. And it
[19:27] deteriorates our self-control.
[19:30] Now, I'm speaking a language that may
[19:32] seem scientific, but we've already spent
[19:33] four services using scripture that
[19:35] describe it perfectly. And we'll we'll
[19:37] dive more into this now as you want to
[19:38] look at Luke chapter 10.
[19:41] We're talking about cognitive overload
[19:42] when we talk about a restless mind that
[19:44] there's too much information, too much
[19:46] simultaneous task, too many things
[19:48] taking place in our minds. It
[19:49] deteriorates our thinking. And we can
[19:51] see an example of this in Luke 10 38-42.
[19:54] I feel like maybe I can just uh run away
[19:57] now and just begin to get into the
[19:59] scriptures and preach. Thank you for
[20:00] your patience in that first part. It
[20:03] says, "Now it came to pass as they went
[20:04] that he entered into a certain village
[20:05] and a certain woman named Martha
[20:07] received him into her house. And she had
[20:09] a sister called Mary, which also sat at
[20:12] Jesus' feet and heard his word." But
[20:14] Martha was cumbered about much serving.
[20:16] That means drawn away or distracted.
[20:18] Cumbered her attention's been divided
[20:21] about much serving. Now look at how
[20:22] innocent this is. It's not that Martha
[20:25] found herself in her gaming room or she
[20:27] found herself down at the internet cafe.
[20:30] She was cumbered about with much
[20:31] serving. But notice how when the mind
[20:34] gets encumbered and it gets distracted
[20:36] and it gets hyperfocused on one thing,
[20:38] how much it deteriorates our thinking. I
[20:41] would say she was since she's cumbered
[20:43] and and and and drawn and drawn away and
[20:46] distracted. It changes her thinking
[20:48] because she says she comes to the Lord
[20:50] and says, "Do you not care that my
[20:52] sister hath left me alone to serve
[20:56] and bid her therefore?" Now, it's not
[20:58] only not only does she complain about
[20:59] it, but she has an ask. Bid her
[21:01] therefore that she help me. And this
[21:03] must have come as some shock to Jesus
[21:05] because he says in verse 41, Martha,
[21:07] Martha, thou art careful and troubled
[21:10] about many things. Careful means
[21:13] selfishly anxious.
[21:15] She wasn't worried about Mary. She
[21:18] wasn't worried about Jesus. She really
[21:20] wasn't even worried about the food being
[21:23] prepared to her hungry guests that they
[21:24] might be full. She was worried about
[21:26] whether or not it would look good and
[21:27] taste good and whether or not the
[21:28] pretense uh was being satisfied and
[21:31] being met. He was selfishly anxious.
[21:33] Says Martha, thou art careful, selfishly
[21:35] anxious and troubled, which means
[21:37] disqued or restless.
[21:40] You're selfishly anxious and you're
[21:42] restless. Your mind is cumbered and
[21:44] you're restless and you're selfishly
[21:45] anxious. And he reminds her one thing is
[21:48] needful
[21:49] and Mary has chosen that. Mary hath
[21:52] chosen that good part which shall not be
[21:54] taken away from her. Mary is doing
[21:56] something that has lasting value and
[21:58] lasting purpose. sitting down at my
[22:00] feet, hearing what I have to say,
[22:02] finding wonder in me, finding uh
[22:05] fellowship and communion with me. That's
[22:06] not after the fashion of this world. And
[22:09] so she was rebuked for being cumbered.
[22:12] Her mind was restless. She was selfishly
[22:13] anxious and it was distorting her
[22:15] thinking because now she was rebuking
[22:17] Mary for doing the one thing that was
[22:20] needful.
[22:21] And she didn't recognize herself that
[22:23] that was an opportunity she ought to
[22:24] have been taken advantage of. And so
[22:26] this continual bombardment of
[22:28] information and notifications and uh uh
[22:30] rings and text and all these different
[22:32] things that kind of light up our brains,
[22:34] it's uh it's bombarding our our minds
[22:36] and clouding our understanding.
[22:39] It's confusing our purpose. It confuses
[22:41] our duty and it's keeping us from true
[22:42] happiness.
[22:44] Luke 8:14 and this is just gets more on
[22:46] on the nose and that which fell among
[22:48] thorns. You know, he's talking about the
[22:50] word of God is the seed and the word is
[22:52] sown into this the condition of the
[22:53] ground and the word which fell among the
[22:56] thorns or they which when they heard go
[22:58] forth and are choked. That means it
[23:00] draws off it chokes off uh choked with
[23:03] cares and riches and pleasures of this
[23:06] life and bring no fruit to perfection.
[23:10] The thorn is something that's
[23:11] undesirable.
[23:13] A thorn is something that is useless,
[23:15] it's worthless. Not only is it
[23:17] worthless, it's troublesome. It's
[23:18] detrimental. But even when it comes to
[23:21] thorns, if people get hungry enough,
[23:23] they'll eat them. And and they proved
[23:25] that in the drought in the worst hard
[23:28] time, as they call it, when they would
[23:29] they would grind this Russian thistle
[23:32] into a flower and they'd use it to eat
[23:34] because there wasn't anything else to
[23:35] eat. So before you think, I'd recognize
[23:37] the thorn. I wouldn't want to have
[23:38] anything to do with the thorn. It's
[23:40] amazing how many thorns we have in our
[23:41] lives that are useless and detrimental,
[23:44] but yet we allow them.
[23:46] And he calls it cares, riches, and
[23:48] pleasures. If somebody offered you
[23:49] riches, your instinct wouldn't say, "I
[23:51] don't need that thorn." You might say,
[23:53] "I'll see how I can live with it." Like
[23:55] brother Brandon, I believe, I don't know
[23:57] if it's brother Lee Vale that tells a
[23:58] story or if he said it, I can't recall
[24:00] exactly how he may have said on tape,
[24:01] but how he's offered a million dollars
[24:03] and and he turned it down because he he
[24:05] didn't want to he didn't want to have to
[24:06] handle it. And I'm kind of thinking, I
[24:08] don't know. I mean, I might want the
[24:11] chance, right? But there's things that
[24:14] we may not realize can become a choker
[24:16] to us. Cares, riches, and pleasures of
[24:19] this life. They overwhelm what is
[24:20] needful. They overwhelm real living.
[24:23] They're overwhelming spiritual growth.
[24:25] And he's using a language that we ought
[24:26] to be able to catch up, you know, catch
[24:28] with cares, riches, and pleasures of
[24:29] this life. These things choke
[24:32] the anxieties of life, the cares of
[24:34] life, the pretense, all these things
[24:35] that matter to us. and the the social
[24:37] clout and all these different rewards
[24:39] and things that we're chasing. It draws
[24:41] off our attention. It absorbs so much of
[24:43] our interest. It uses up so much of our
[24:45] time that there's no room for spiritual
[24:47] growth.
[24:48] There's no nutrients going to the word.
[24:50] There's no nutrients going to the seed.
[24:52] And we're pursuing and watering things
[24:54] that are fruitless, things that are
[24:55] vain, things that are empty and
[24:57] ultimately harmful.
[24:59] And it's those thorns that get all the
[25:00] nutrients. They compete in the same
[25:02] ground for the light. They compete the
[25:04] same ground for the water. They compete
[25:05] for the time and the energy and the
[25:07] nutrients. And what does it do? It draws
[25:09] the life away from the word and keeps it
[25:10] from growing.
[25:12] And if you turn to Ecclesiastes chapter
[25:14] 7,
[25:16] there's a perfect application to modern
[25:18] life in Leodysia with these things.
[25:22] And I would ask you, as we've already
[25:24] read from Psalm 139, allow the Lord to
[25:27] search your heart. Allow him to examine
[25:30] the things that are in your life, the
[25:31] things that we do, and the things that
[25:32] we engage in. They're talking about a
[25:34] restless mind. And I believe there's
[25:36] minds that are racing. There's desires
[25:38] that are unending that we need the Lord
[25:40] to satisfy. In Ecclesiastes chapter 7
[25:43] verse 29, I know some of these are very
[25:46] familiar to us. Lo, this only have I
[25:48] found, this is Solomon concluding things
[25:50] that God hath made man upright, but they
[25:53] have sought out many inventions.
[25:56] And these inventions, these desires and
[25:58] these processes and these ways to try to
[26:00] make themselves happy is what he's
[26:01] talking about. And so Solomon attributes
[26:04] humanity's insatiable appetite where
[26:07] they're always hungry but never
[26:08] satisfied and never filled. He's
[26:11] attributing it to the fall because he's
[26:13] saying God made man upright. God didn't
[26:15] make man to be this way. God made him
[26:18] happy. God gave him all the things he
[26:19] would need to be happy. But because of
[26:20] the fall, they seek out many inventions.
[26:23] I want to read this to you. I believe we
[26:25] read it to you before, but it's just
[26:27] another uh translation of it. I
[26:28] discovered the fountain of all vanity
[26:30] and evil is the original sin that has
[26:33] corrupted the nature of man. God made
[26:35] Adam and the woman without imperfection
[26:38] in likeness of his own desire and
[26:39] nature. But the woman not content
[26:42] anymore with her present condition
[26:44] accepted a new way of making herself
[26:46] wise. Ever since all mankind is prone to
[26:50] forsake the order of God's word and has
[26:52] sought new methods to attain fulfillment
[26:55] and happiness. This is Solomon taking a
[26:58] look at it and being honest about it and
[26:59] saying, "I look around and Solomon who
[27:01] had everything didn't get happiness out
[27:03] of it. Thought he could find it in
[27:05] wisdom alone. Couldn't. Thought he could
[27:06] get it in possessions and I made myself
[27:08] happy and I I had music and I bought
[27:10] this and I did that and I enjoyed this."
[27:12] And everywhere he found that man was not
[27:14] made this way. He was made pure. He He
[27:16] wasn't made with a taste for evil. But
[27:18] having lost God's image, he now
[27:20] endlessly pursues and is searching for
[27:23] happiness and can never find it.
[27:27] Have
[27:27] anybody ever heard the phrase distracted
[27:29] by distraction or distracted from
[27:31] distraction by distraction?
[27:33] You heard it before TS Elliott. All our
[27:36] uh Nobel Prize in literature experts. I
[27:40] was reading I was reading the poem it
[27:41] came from. It's called Burnt Norton. I I
[27:43] would even suggest you try to read it.
[27:45] I'm like swimming over here trying to be
[27:46] an intellectual trying to figure out
[27:47] what he's trying to say. But it was in u
[27:50] was published in 1936 and it was number
[27:52] one of these four quartets that he
[27:54] published and it's really is a
[27:56] remarkable poem and the burnt Norton is
[27:58] referring to some house or manor in in
[28:00] England that was burned down or just
[28:02] left in and wasted and actually Tis
[28:05] Elliot is reflecting on the fall of
[28:08] mankind. He's looking at humanity and
[28:10] saying we're fallen. We're lost and he's
[28:13] meditating on the nature of time. He's
[28:15] doing it from a biblical perspective, a
[28:17] historical perspective, the way things
[28:18] were physically. And he's and he's
[28:21] looking at the nature of time and the
[28:22] human condition and how time continues,
[28:24] what happens to to the humans. And what
[28:27] he's pointing at in this particular poem
[28:29] is this still point. And this is just
[28:31] the language he's using, the still
[28:32] point. And it's this it's experiencing
[28:35] the grace of sins
[28:37] uh by being released from inner and
[28:39] outer compulsion. That's the language
[28:40] he's talking about. He's walking the
[28:42] reader through this idea of is there a
[28:44] way that you could get to this place of
[28:46] being still where you're no longer
[28:48] you're free from compulsion.
[28:50] You're free from acting on your desires.
[28:51] It it reminded me I was reminded of this
[28:53] in looking at Sol Song of Solomon and
[28:56] how he's describing it the same way that
[28:57] this modern poet describes it that man
[29:00] mankind is constantly seeking after
[29:02] these things and what TS Elliott is
[29:04] using. He's describing mankind how
[29:06] mankind has been impacted by the
[29:08] original sin. It's what he's talking
[29:10] about is this modern writer right in Le
[29:12] oysia and he's using a rose garden which
[29:16] is symbolic of the garden of Eden and
[29:17] he's telling this story follow me walk
[29:19] with me and he describes modern life as
[29:22] a place of disaection where we're no
[29:24] longer satisfied with authority we're no
[29:27] longer satisfied with rule we're no
[29:29] longer satisfied with order and he says
[29:31] neither planitude nor vacancy neither
[29:34] abundance uh uh or empty space only a
[29:38] flicker over the strained timeridden
[29:40] faces, distracted from distraction by
[29:43] distraction, filled with fancies and
[29:45] empty of meaning.
[29:47] He called it a swollen disinterest with
[29:50] no mental focus.
[29:52] This is this is what he's he's
[29:53] describing us. He's noting how there's
[29:56] this self-numbness and this lack of deep
[29:58] spirituality amongst people and they're
[30:00] not thinking and you're thinking, "Oh my
[30:02] goodness, what church did he go to?
[30:03] Where did he pastor? He's just a writer,
[30:06] a modern poet. didn't publish a lot but
[30:08] he's been regarded as one of the great
[30:09] writers of the of the 20th century. And
[30:12] this po po po po po po po po po po po po
[30:12] po po po po po po po po poem was
[30:13] published in 1936 written somewhere
[30:15] between 1909 and 1935 and what caught my
[30:18] attention is here's a man who was
[30:20] observing Leodysia
[30:22] he witnessed the birth of Leodysia and
[30:25] is writing his observations about
[30:26] Leodysia and what he's saying is there's
[30:28] a swollen disinterest there's no uh uh
[30:32] swollen self-interest there's no mental
[30:34] focus the flicker h over the strained
[30:37] time faces distracted from distraction
[30:40] by distraction and you're thinking
[30:41] thinking, "This guy's got to be in
[30:42] 2023."
[30:44] But he wrote it a hundred years earlier.
[30:46] Before there was a flicker of a screen
[30:49] in in everybody's hand before we would
[30:51] even call distraction a a pandemic. This
[30:54] is something that he recognized and
[30:56] realized. And what's happening now as I
[30:58] look at this is we are walking in this
[31:01] very pattern. Our minds are constantly
[31:03] flickering.
[31:05] Desire is continually racing. He says,
[31:06] "Neither plentitude nor vacancy." Uh
[31:08] we're not empty, but we're certainly not
[31:10] full. Right.
[31:11] Right there. There's never any topping
[31:13] it off.
[31:14] Even the things we try to use to rest
[31:16] our minds ultimately end up stimulating
[31:19] our desires.
[31:20] We're trying to find something trying to
[31:23] find something uh uh uh to rest our
[31:25] minds and it only leads to something
[31:26] else that's engages it even more. Makes
[31:28] it worse.
[31:29] We think we're trying to help ourselves
[31:31] and we're only Yeah, I don't want to
[31:32] smoke. I just want to vape. And then
[31:34] you're going to find out that that makes
[31:35] it worse.
[31:37] I I I heard someone say one time that,
[31:39] you know, and I kind of identified with
[31:41] it that I just couldn't imagine ever
[31:42] imagine myself smoking. I'd probably
[31:45] have to start with a patch, you know,
[31:47] first to get there. Uh I kind of thought
[31:51] the same way about coffee. You know,
[31:53] you're going to have to you have to
[31:54] start me on a a a caffeine patch first.
[31:57] They probably have them out there. But
[32:00] the the whole idea is there's things
[32:01] that we think are going to fix us and it
[32:02] doesn't. It's the flickering across time
[32:04] ridden faces. distracted from
[32:07] distraction by distraction. This is the
[32:09] ceaseless endless mind that Solomon's
[32:12] looking said. They've sought out many
[32:13] inventions. They're inventing all these
[32:15] different ways to try to make themselves
[32:16] happy. But they cannot be happy. They're
[32:18] only distracting themselves now from
[32:21] their distractions by distraction.
[32:24] I don't want to do that. I don't want to
[32:25] do that. I'm going to do this.
[32:27] And and you're trying to distract
[32:28] yourself from distraction by just
[32:30] another distraction.
[32:31] He's describing Leodysia.
[32:34] You might be coming away with a weird
[32:36] opinion of me at the end of the day. And
[32:38] so I apologize if this is different. I
[32:41] admit that it is different. They've got
[32:42] a different angle, too. They can see me
[32:43] from the side.
[32:46] You might want to ask later, do I ever
[32:48] want to sit over there? Peek behind the
[32:50] curtain.
[32:54] Romans, excuse me, Revelations 3:1 17.
[33:01] If you can pull really, really hard and
[33:03] amen. if you can. If I don't want you to
[33:05] say amen just because I asked for it.
[33:07] I've I've hope I've taught you well that
[33:09] if a preacher says say amen, only do it
[33:11] if you can say amen. And let them
[33:13] wrestle with the silence when they don't
[33:15] get one. Right? Go back and think, hm,
[33:18] maybe brother Brandham didn't say that,
[33:23] but Revelations 3:1 17, if you pull
[33:26] hard, you amen if you can, we can get to
[33:28] lunch sooner than later.
[33:32] says, "Because thou saith," this is so
[33:34] familiar, and I know we're repeating a
[33:35] lot of themes, but I just want you to
[33:36] look at it in the context of what we've
[33:37] been preaching on on this wonder lust
[33:39] and wonder lost. Because thou sayest, I
[33:41] am rich and increase with goods and have
[33:43] need of nothing. And knowest not that
[33:45] thou wretched and miserable and poor and
[33:47] blind and naked. And then he gives the
[33:48] prescription to buy. And notice when the
[33:50] buying it so that you could see
[33:52] correctly,
[33:53] that your shame naked not appeared. that
[33:56] there's a there's an addressing the the
[33:59] the lack of perception in the things
[34:00] that he uh encourages them to do. But
[34:04] here's mankind's boast. We are
[34:06] materially wealthy. We just talking
[34:08] about being rich and we're morally
[34:10] ethical increased with goods. We we have
[34:13] an abundance of material things and
[34:15] we're moral with it. We're ethical with
[34:17] it. I am rich and increased with goods
[34:19] and have need of nothing. As brother
[34:20] Brandon said, they very well may say, I
[34:21] have everything or I don't want anymore.
[34:23] This is their attitude. And what we need
[34:26] to remember is they're deceived.
[34:28] So if they say, "I'm rich," they're
[34:29] actually not rich. They say they're
[34:31] increased with goods, they're not
[34:32] actually increased with goods. And when
[34:33] they say they have need of nothing,
[34:35] they're lying to you because their
[34:37] appetites are insatiable.
[34:39] It's an empty boast because their
[34:40] actions don't fit their confession. Oh,
[34:43] I'm rich. I'm increased with goods. I'm
[34:45] satisfied. We've just settled down in
[34:46] Leodysia, man. Once we sliced bread and
[34:49] had a had and invented the will, we were
[34:51] chill. we didn't need to worry about
[34:52] anything else. We could just relax,
[34:55] right? And we could we could just get on
[34:57] by with the way we've always been doing
[34:58] things. No, their own actions declare
[35:01] that they've deceived themselves because
[35:03] it doesn't fit their confession. We
[35:04] don't have any need of anything. You're
[35:06] you're constantly searching for more.
[35:08] And this is the vanity also observed by
[35:10] Solomon or brother TS Elliott. They
[35:12] observed the same thing. They had he
[35:14] Solomon had every material pleasure that
[35:16] man could desire and he still felt
[35:18] empty. So the scripture already warns us
[35:20] ahead of time. Don't think that being
[35:22] rich and increased with goods will ever
[35:24] get you to a place where you can
[35:25] honestly say, I have need of nothing.
[35:28] Because the Bible says, "And knowest not
[35:30] that you're driven by emptiness. That
[35:33] your riches and abundance have not
[35:34] satisfied your want. Knowest not that
[35:37] you're wretched, miserable, poor, blind,
[35:39] and naked." And that's what's actually
[35:41] driving them to have more riches,
[35:43] driving them to be increased with goods.
[35:45] They wouldn't have all that if they
[35:46] didn't have that emptiness. Amen.
[35:48] But since they don't recognize the
[35:50] compulsion loop, since they don't
[35:51] recognize the compulsive behavior like
[35:52] Oh, no. I'm good. I'm good, man. I don't
[35:55] I don't have a problem. No. Uhuh.
[35:58] Right.
[36:00] I I I don't need my cell phone. What's
[36:02] that's the biggest watch I've ever seen.
[36:04] Oh,
[36:06] hey.
[36:07] Is is that an earthquake? No, that's my
[36:09] Instagram blowing up.
[36:14] Brother Brandon writes it this way. It
[36:15] cries that it has a great amplitude of
[36:18] all things but it keeps burning with
[36:20] desire like an unsatisfied fire. Know
[36:23] what Maslov said? Even a man is just a
[36:25] constant perpetual yearning longing
[36:28] animal. Always desiring always wanting
[36:32] per perpetually wanting animal. Brother
[36:34] Brandham says it a great they have a
[36:36] great amplitude. We're rich. This is
[36:38] where I I I get the interpretation of
[36:40] the scripture from. Can you read it?
[36:41] Says well I I don't know. They say they
[36:43] don't have need any of need of anything.
[36:44] Maybe maybe they don't need it and
[36:46] that's the problem. No, they cry that
[36:48] they have a great amplitude of things,
[36:49] but they're burning with a desire like
[36:51] an unsatisfied fire.
[36:54] This is the calling card of Satan's
[36:55] Eden.
[36:57] This is the calling card of Satan's
[36:58] Eden. It's a wonderlust. It's a constant
[37:00] desire. It's the restless longing. They
[37:03] have a great amplitude of all things,
[37:05] but yet there's their thirst isn't
[37:06] satisfied. that that there's if you
[37:09] think of it this way and this is maybe
[37:11] where we'll just start uh pointing you
[37:13] to that what I'm trying to inspiring you
[37:16] is the wonder of Christ. We sing that
[37:18] song fill my cup Lord
[37:21] fill it up Lord. It says feed me till I
[37:24] want no more.
[37:26] And I I don't sing it that way. No
[37:28] offense but I sing feed me till I want
[37:30] more and more. There's something so
[37:33] unique about Christ. The more you have
[37:35] the more you want. But it comes from
[37:36] such a great place cuz you're not
[37:38] dissatisfied.
[37:40] You don't feel like, "Well, that just
[37:41] didn't hit the spot." You know, thank
[37:42] you for your presence, Jesus, but that
[37:44] just didn't hit the spot. But that's
[37:46] what the world gives us when it gives
[37:48] you what you ask for. You're left either
[37:51] first saying, "I never want to do that
[37:53] again." But later you want more and you
[37:55] can never find what you're looking for.
[37:58] But when it comes to Christ, you can
[38:00] experience him and you can never get
[38:02] enough.
[38:03] But it doesn't come from this place of a
[38:05] burning fire and an anxiety and a
[38:08] restlessness. It comes from a place of
[38:10] knowing I only got a little. I know
[38:12] there's more.
[38:16] This wonder lust is robbing us, taking
[38:18] all of our attention, drawing away all
[38:20] of our time, absorbing all of our
[38:21] interest, using up all of our attention,
[38:23] and driving us to chase things to try to
[38:26] satisfy the flesh that'll never give us
[38:28] happiness. And Christ sits here
[38:32] longing for fellowship. Brother Brandham
[38:35] says in the sermon to whom should we go?
[38:38] He says, you know, man hasn't changed
[38:39] very much.
[38:42] This is one of the cornerstone quotes in
[38:44] the beginning when I begin to study this
[38:46] at the beginning of the year. He's still
[38:47] wandering about in the world seeking
[38:50] pleasure,
[38:51] restless, never satisfied, never coming
[38:55] to any right conclusions, never finding
[38:58] rest. This is the nature of man. They
[39:00] cry a great amplitude of all things, but
[39:02] keep burning with the desire like an
[39:03] unsatisfied fire. He says they're
[39:05] wandering, seeking pleasure, wandering,
[39:08] restless, never satisfied, never coming
[39:11] to any right conclusions, never finding
[39:13] rest. He says he's just about the same
[39:14] condition that he was when he left God
[39:16] in the Garden of Eden and went to shift
[39:18] for himself. In other words, provide for
[39:20] himself.
[39:23] He's been shifting ever since. And he
[39:25] finds it. It's a rough way to go. And he
[39:27] looks like he doesn't care very much to
[39:29] many just where this life will end up
[39:31] for them. That's your wonder lust.
[39:34] Oh, it doesn't matter where I end up.
[39:35] It's just the journey. It's just
[39:36] enjoying things along the way. It's I'm
[39:39] rich and increased with goods and have
[39:40] need of nothing. And it's the distracted
[39:42] from distraction by distraction. It is
[39:44] the choking of the cares and riches and
[39:46] the pleasures of this life to where we
[39:48] bring no fruit to perfection.
[39:52] And brother Brandham says this is how it
[39:54] started in the Garden of Eden. Genesis
[39:56] chapter 2:8. It's even what TS Elliott
[39:59] is describing when he's said, "Follow me
[40:01] in the garden." He's going all the way
[40:02] back to the Garden of Eden to look at
[40:04] the nature of time and say, "Look where
[40:05] man has ended up now."
[40:07] Look at their nature. Look what they're
[40:09] prone to. Look what they're doing. Look
[40:10] at how it's they they claim to have a
[40:12] lot, but they're empty and they don't.
[40:13] There's there as he describes it, he's
[40:16] using he's looking at the fall of man as
[40:19] the explanation for the way things are.
[40:22] And brother Brandham says he's just
[40:23] about the same condition he is in when
[40:25] he left the garden because the garden
[40:27] represents that true happiness, that
[40:29] true perfection. Says in Genesis 2:8,
[40:31] "And the Lord God planted a garden
[40:33] eastward in Eden and there he put the
[40:35] man whom he formed." This is the
[40:37] beginning of mankind and the beginning
[40:38] of mankind and what it represented and
[40:40] what it expressed and the fall of
[40:42] mankind show the weakness of humanity
[40:45] shows you the modern tactics of the
[40:47] devil. How even then he be to change our
[40:50] our our our biology begin to change our
[40:52] thinking change our nature so that we
[40:54] act and respond a certain way contrary
[40:57] to the way we were made.
[40:59] The Solomon observes God didn't make man
[41:01] this way. God made man pure with no
[41:04] thought of evil. God didn't make man
[41:06] insatiable and dissatisfied. Come on,
[41:08] Jesus. Is this all you got in the
[41:10] garden? Can't you give me a little bit
[41:11] more palm trees here? No, there was no
[41:13] it was there was no drive that tended to
[41:15] the negative. There was no compulsion
[41:17] that would deteriorate quality of life.
[41:19] He says, "You didn't make man this way.
[41:21] You made man upright." But now they're
[41:23] seeking out so many ways to satisfy
[41:25] themselves. And in that garden, we can
[41:26] see the weakness of humanity get swn
[41:28] into or Satan sew weakness in humanity
[41:31] by the original sin. And we see the
[41:33] original tactic that he used. The Garden
[41:35] of Eden is pleasure ground. It was God's
[41:38] place of delight. God's paradise.
[41:40] Pleasure ground. A place of delight.
[41:41] That was man's home.
[41:44] It was a marvelous thing. It was a
[41:46] wonder. This has been part of my
[41:48] meditation the last month or so of just
[41:50] what that represented to man.
[41:53] And how they would have been in awe.
[41:54] They were in awe of creation. all in all
[41:57] of the simple things in all of the way
[41:59] that God had made you uh the the the
[42:01] animals and the way that God had
[42:02] arranged the plants and all the colors
[42:04] and the sun and the stars that that was
[42:07] a cathedral of joy.
[42:09] It was a cathedral of wonder. The only
[42:11] thing that was receiving glory in that
[42:13] was God. The only thing that man was
[42:15] receiving in that was pleasure and
[42:17] provision. It was it was a pleasure
[42:19] ground is what it was called. Amen.
[42:21] And I'm wanting you I want you to
[42:23] recognize I'm identifying our hope. I'm
[42:26] identifying how we can come back to
[42:28] life. And God's power to transform.
[42:29] There's your there's your answer.
[42:31] Amen.
[42:32] God's power to transform. He said this
[42:34] world was without form and it was void.
[42:36] And darkness was upon the earth. Nothing
[42:39] but complete chaos.
[42:41] And then this world was in that
[42:43] condition. The spirit of God moved upon
[42:45] the face of the waters. There was no
[42:47] order. It was restless. It's neither
[42:49] planitude nor vacancy. You can't discern
[42:52] what it is, but there's something there,
[42:53] but it's certainly not complete. It was
[42:55] absolute chaos. But the spirit of God
[42:57] moves upon the face of the waters. He
[42:58] says, "And the entire picture was
[43:01] changed from a total chaos to a garden
[43:04] of Eden. From a tomalt and top and
[43:07] things turning over and boiling and
[43:09] things just flowing without any form or
[43:11] discerning shape. It changes from chaos
[43:13] to a garden of Eden. says that is the
[43:15] transforming power of God that can take
[43:17] something that's nothing and make
[43:19] something wonderful out of it. God is
[43:22] reflecting in the beginning that where
[43:24] there's chaos, where there's disorder,
[43:26] where there's things that are upset,
[43:27] where there's things that don't make
[43:29] sense, we just need the spirit of God to
[43:31] come upon the scene. And even the things
[43:33] in your life that seem like chaos, even
[43:35] the things that seem like nothing can
[43:37] ever come out of it, God's spirit can
[43:39] move on it and fulfill the prophecy that
[43:42] in this there's good for them that love
[43:43] the Lord.
[43:46] Take something that's nothing and make
[43:48] something wonderful out of it.
[43:49] Amen. Amen.
[43:51] In Genesis 3:6, then we come to where
[43:54] the wonder is lost.
[43:57] And when the woman here, I know we're
[43:59] just we're with a mature group here that
[44:01] knows these things, the original sin and
[44:04] what it uh what it produced and even
[44:06] what it was.
[44:08] And after Satan through the serpent
[44:10] approaches the woman
[44:13] and and and this conversation, if you
[44:15] even recognize what did what did the
[44:17] devil use on her for the first time?
[44:18] fear of missing out.
[44:21] Oh, the Lord knows if you eat that,
[44:23] you're missing out on something.
[44:25] Because if you do that, there's more
[44:26] that you're not experiencing.
[44:28] When the woman saw that the tree was
[44:30] good for food, which the Bible said it
[44:32] wasn't, and that it was pleasant to the
[44:34] eyes, it couldn't be good for food
[44:35] because it says if you eat this, you'll
[44:36] die.
[44:37] So, it couldn't have grown from the
[44:38] ground because every tree that grew out
[44:39] of the ground was good for food.
[44:41] And it says when he saw that the tree
[44:43] was good for food and that it was
[44:44] pleasant to the eyes, that's an
[44:45] important phrase we'll come back to. and
[44:47] a tree to be desired to make one wise.
[44:49] She took of the fruit thereof and did
[44:51] eat and gave also unto her husband with
[44:52] her and he did eat.
[44:56] Brother Brandham in the sermon lean not
[44:58] to thunder understanding says Eve which
[44:59] was no doubt an intelligent person.
[45:02] So we we don't want to just dumb Eve
[45:04] down to where she was just, you know, a
[45:05] head full of rocks and she was a
[45:07] simpleton that was tricked into
[45:08] something. Says she was no doubt an
[45:10] intelligent person. The first right off
[45:13] of Adam who was the son of God and Eve
[45:16] certainly being in that spot where there
[45:18] had been no sin, no place for sin. This
[45:20] is striking what he says. She certainly
[45:23] must have had a wonderful conception of
[45:25] what God was.
[45:28] This to me makes the fall even more
[45:30] incredible, even more remarkable to
[45:32] think that she wasn't. It wasn't that
[45:35] she was just, you know, chewing on her
[45:36] tongue, mumbling through the garden and
[45:38] has no idea what she's doing. Oh, I
[45:40] don't have my husband. I have no idea
[45:41] what to do. She was an intelligent
[45:43] person. She was the first one from Adam.
[45:46] She had a wonderful conception of what
[45:48] God was. She had a pure mind that was at
[45:50] rest with God. Her mind was not
[45:53] disturbed. This is I believe what
[45:54] Solomon is saying that God made man
[45:56] upright. He's at peace. He has no evil
[45:59] mixed in his thoughts. He's got brother
[46:01] called it perfect love around him. There
[46:03] was no fear. And she goes from a place
[46:05] of perfect contentment with an
[46:07] understanding of how wonderful God was
[46:10] and had an understanding of how the
[46:11] nature of God was wonderful. And the
[46:13] devil used something to trick her into
[46:16] thinking that God's wonder was being
[46:18] withheld from her.
[46:21] And he and what the devil's sermon
[46:23] produced was something that was pleasant
[46:25] to the eyes. That pleasant is ta in the
[46:28] Hebrew. I know I'm probably not getting
[46:30] enough throat in there when I say it to
[46:32] make it sound like Hebrew, but it means
[46:33] a lust or desire in a bad sense. It was
[46:36] pleasant to the eyes. It's not
[46:38] physically plea. It wasn't phys visually
[46:40] pleasing, but it was pleasing to her
[46:42] mind. Right?
[46:44] Pleasant to the eyes would more
[46:46] accurately be translated to desirous to
[46:48] her spirit
[46:51] because pleasant to the sight means
[46:52] visual visually appealing which is what
[46:54] fruit was.
[46:55] Bible uses very strict language that the
[46:57] fruit was pleasant to the sight. That
[46:59] means when you look at it and go that's
[47:00] red apple. I want to eat that. Right?
[47:04] It's visually to the eyes but pleasant
[47:06] to the eyes means it's emotionally
[47:08] stimulating.
[47:10] She began to lust. A tree to be desired.
[47:12] That traumad means to desire to covet,
[47:15] means to take pleasure in. And it was a
[47:18] tree desired to make one wise. Now, she
[47:20] already had a wonderful conception of
[47:22] what God was.
[47:24] It wasn't true wisdom that she was
[47:25] looking after. But it meant that she was
[47:27] going to have some the word wise there
[47:29] means to prosper or have success. That
[47:31] it was a tree that if she experienced
[47:33] would reward her. It was a tree that if
[47:36] she experienced it, give her a different
[47:37] experience and there'd be some insight.
[47:40] Now, I don't mean to just bring this
[47:41] right back to the biology of it, but
[47:43] brother Bam teaches this. It started in
[47:45] the mind
[47:46] and that there was some there was some
[47:48] cue in her mind that begin to make her
[47:50] think that if I participate in this and
[47:52] I do this, I'm going to be made wise.
[47:55] There's going to be a benefit in this.
[47:56] There's going to be some experience that
[47:58] I get out of this that's going to make
[47:59] me have pleasure. There was going to be
[48:01] an enlightenment. And so as that begins
[48:04] as she begins to get that cue what she
[48:06] participated in the she then wants to go
[48:08] and show her husband meaning that
[48:11] literally what had happened within the
[48:12] mind of Eve is neurons were firing
[48:15] things were taking place in her mind
[48:17] that she had never experienced before.
[48:19] There was electrical activity. There was
[48:21] the release of neurotransmitters. There
[48:23] was something happening and putting this
[48:25] shock into her mind and it excited these
[48:27] nerve cells and and things begin to take
[48:30] place. And they actually used this
[48:31] language that when it happens, it tells
[48:33] it to go and send a message
[48:36] causing her to act, causing her to
[48:39] experience things and things that are to
[48:41] be. Brother Bear says knowledge is what
[48:43] the devil sold Eve.
[48:46] Knowledge is what he sold her in in the
[48:48] Garden of Eden. So you you think that
[48:50] it's only a Leodysa phenomenon that data
[48:52] is a currency.
[48:54] You think it's only a lessa that
[48:56] information is the most valuable
[48:57] currency. No. The devil started that.
[49:00] cuz he sold it to Eve in the beginning.
[49:03] And he says that caused her to cramp.
[49:07] This is this involuntary spasm.
[49:11] This is something that's happening.
[49:12] Knowledge is what caused her to act and
[49:15] transgress God's commandment. Where's
[49:17] the language used? Innocence perverted
[49:18] by knowledge.
[49:20] The wonderful conception of God
[49:22] perverted by some other knowledge.
[49:24] And and just to stay on the the dopamine
[49:26] line, they say that whenever you ingest
[49:29] sugar, it produces huge surges in
[49:30] dopamine. And the believer said,
[49:32] "Amen." That's why we enjoy sweets. And
[49:36] and food is a great use of an analogy of
[49:38] how that processed foods and things will
[49:40] give you a quick fix and reward, but
[49:42] it's empty. There's no nutrients in it,
[49:44] so you need more of it, more of it, and
[49:45] become addicted to it. They say when you
[49:47] ingest sugar, it causes huge increase of
[49:49] dopamine. You know what brother Brandham
[49:50] said that Satan did when he talked to
[49:52] her? He sugarcoated it.
[49:56] It's showing that he he found a way. As
[49:58] Paul said, you heap to yourselves
[50:00] teachers having itching ears. It means I
[50:02] have this cycle where I want to hear it
[50:04] a certain way. I I I only want the man's
[50:06] leaven mixed in. I want a certain taste.
[50:08] I want a highly processed and
[50:10] synthesized message so it can scratch my
[50:12] lazy itch for immediate gratification
[50:16] and not the depth of God's word.
[50:18] That's good.
[50:19] He sugarcoated it.
[50:21] He did it on purpose so that it would
[50:22] excite the wrong part of her mind or do
[50:25] it the wrong way. And the Bible says in
[50:27] 2 Corinthians 11:3, "But I fearless by
[50:30] any means as a serpent begile Eve
[50:32] through his subtlety,
[50:34] so your mind should be corrupted from
[50:35] the simplicity that is in Christ.
[50:40] I fearless by any means as a serpent
[50:42] beguiled Eve through his subtlety,
[50:45] so your mind should be corrupted from
[50:47] the simplicity that is in Christ." I
[50:50] believe that word is translated to
[50:51] bountiful in another place. It's the
[50:54] bountifulness and the liberty. I think
[50:56] it's even translated to liberty, but
[50:57] that's part of the meaning that I I I
[51:01] fear that in the same way the certain
[51:04] beguiled to his subtly, tricked her and
[51:06] deceived her that your mind, your
[51:09] thought, your purposes, how we ponder,
[51:10] how we consider things, how we perceive,
[51:12] we'd be corrupted, which means to spoil
[51:14] it, to waste it.
[51:16] God's given it to you to have a
[51:17] wonderful conception of him.
[51:20] She had a wonderful conception of what
[51:22] God was, but then Satan sold her some
[51:24] knowledge that wasn't true about God and
[51:26] it corrupted her thoughts.
[51:28] And so it was the corruption, the
[51:30] wasting of the bountifulness and the
[51:32] liberty. It speaks of no pretense,
[51:36] no hypocrisy, the humil the the the
[51:38] simplicity there is not self-seeking but
[51:40] generous because it's an abundance. It's
[51:42] a liberty not to satisfy the flesh, but
[51:45] it's through an abundance and God's
[51:47] power to transform. He says in the same
[51:49] pattern he deceived Eve, he's also
[51:51] deceived the church, which there Eve was
[51:53] a type of the church. Notice what he
[51:55] did. Now, I believe that we we use this
[51:58] no doubt to preach against spirits that
[52:00] are trying to deceive others with false
[52:01] doctrine. We use it to show how the
[52:03] Roman Catholic Church and all of her
[52:05] daughters are deceived and how the same
[52:07] thing that uh Satan was able to achieve
[52:09] in the garden, he was able to achieve
[52:10] before Christ could come to her. The
[52:13] church was a fallen woman and we see
[52:14] that through the church ages, but
[52:16] there's an application to us as
[52:18] individuals. That's not just
[52:19] theological. That's not just with
[52:21] respect to false doctrine, but it comes
[52:23] to righteousness and holy living and
[52:25] your personal individual union with
[52:26] Christ.
[52:27] Amen.
[52:28] And it's the same pattern that he does
[52:30] to the individual. Through the wondering
[52:32] for knowledge, she slips across the line
[52:34] between wrong, right, and wrong by
[52:36] listening to Satan's perversion or
[52:38] deformity of the original word. Let me
[52:42] just say this. Do not underestimate the
[52:44] subtlety of desire. Do not if you feel,
[52:46] well, I'm pretty steadfast in this
[52:47] message. I've already had the winds blow
[52:49] and kind of buff at me, and I'm standing
[52:51] firm, and I'm not going to leave it. And
[52:52] I'm I I've been inoculated against the
[52:54] deception that's going to tell me that
[52:55] it's wrong. I've been inoculated against
[52:57] the deception of all the false
[52:58] conceptions of the message. That's
[53:00] wonderful. But brother Bam taught us he
[53:01] can't get you out on that. He'll get you
[53:03] out on the other.
[53:04] And and if we stand firm in our doctrine
[53:06] and we're firm on what we believe,
[53:07] that's your strength to take advantage
[53:10] of this personal relationship with
[53:12] Christ to not be tricked by the other
[53:14] things.
[53:16] He says that it's he through wandering
[53:19] for knowledge.
[53:21] It's a subtlety of desire.
[53:24] Our minds are constantly racing for vain
[53:26] things.
[53:28] Constantly needing that fix.
[53:30] Yes.
[53:31] And we can be unconsciously driven by an
[53:33] excessive eager desire to possess
[53:37] things. That's what I'm thinking about
[53:38] when I say a restless mind.
[53:41] There's never enough.
[53:43] We're never satisfied.
[53:46] We never come to a place where we can
[53:47] just say, you know what, I've had I've
[53:50] had my feel.
[53:52] But we need to. Amen.
[53:55] We we we there's things that we should
[53:56] be able to put down and never come back
[53:58] to.
[53:59] So, I don't really need it.
[54:01] Well, is it sinful? No. It's it's
[54:03] lawful, but it's not doing for me what I
[54:06] think it should.
[54:07] It it's not demonstrating the example
[54:09] that it ought to have to my children.
[54:14] And you might utilize these things to
[54:16] get a break as a parent.
[54:18] And here here, watch this. Here, do that
[54:20] because you you just need some time. You
[54:21] need a timeout. You need a break.
[54:24] But what you're inviting your children
[54:25] to do is to enter into this process.
[54:50] tree time 7.
[54:54] Have that one just in case.
[54:56] Now, I haven't been preaching that long.
[54:58] Loyal just led song. Brother Loyal led
[54:59] songs for at least an hour or two.
[55:01] That's why that mic died because it
[55:03] hasn't I haven't been that long.
[55:07] This is where if I can say this, the
[55:10] reason why your children react the way
[55:12] they do to being deprived of those
[55:14] things, it's exactly what we've been
[55:16] describing.
[55:17] The mind, their mind tells them you
[55:19] can't live without that.
[55:21] In a mind that's not mature enough to
[55:23] assess risk, and a mind that's not
[55:24] mature enough to know that, yeah, you
[55:26] can, you're going to be fine without
[55:27] that.
[55:28] That that we've taught them to be
[55:30] dependent upon certain things in the way
[55:32] their mind gets stimulated.
[55:34] It's this excessive desire in the sermon
[55:37] the Easter Seal.
[55:39] You recognize the date? Pretty good.
[55:43] Brother Brandham actually said uh was it
[55:46] the the Palm Sunday? He said was uh
[55:48] April 2nd is a date he used for. He said
[55:51] every human being comes right back to
[55:53] the same place to make our choice. And
[55:56] that greed has always been right and
[55:59] wrong. Wrong trying to overthrow the
[56:02] right. It started in the garden
[56:06] and it's come down through the ages.
[56:08] It's come down till it's entered into
[56:10] national affairs. It's come down into
[56:13] church affairs. It's come down into home
[56:15] life. Greed trying to rule or ruin,
[56:19] trying to overpower, push out. And we
[56:20] see the thing working everywhere. And
[56:22] it's always has the same thing. Trying
[56:25] to overrule or overrun.
[56:27] Now, instead of just thinking about the
[56:29] Catholic Church and and their conquest
[56:32] and how they tried to wipe out other
[56:33] religions and, you know, and kill the
[56:35] heretics, I think we ought to just think
[56:38] about ourselves and how these mechanisms
[56:40] work on this. He says it's been greed,
[56:42] trying to overfill the right thing. What
[56:45] started in the garden has come down
[56:46] through the ages. He says it governs
[56:48] national affairs, church affairs, and
[56:50] home life. What is it? Greed, trying to
[56:53] ruin, trying to overpower, trying to
[56:54] push out. It's your own desire.
[56:58] We we can't blame it on anyone else.
[57:00] It's our own desire. God made us to be
[57:02] upright. God has given you things to
[57:05] satisfy and plate. God has given you the
[57:07] shelter. You go and read God's power to
[57:09] transform. We're not waiting to get out
[57:11] of here to have the shelter we need a to
[57:14] to survive the poison gas. He's given it
[57:17] to us by his word. Listen, we have been
[57:20] given the open word. The mighty angel
[57:22] has descended. We have the personal
[57:24] presence of Jesus Christ to shield us
[57:26] from these things.
[57:29] We can have heaven on earth right now.
[57:31] We can have our own Garden of Eden right
[57:33] now with Christ.
[57:36] But we just let so many things beat us
[57:38] out of it.
[57:39] It's greed trying to ruin, trying to
[57:41] overpower, trying to push out, trying to
[57:43] overrule and overrun. He says
[57:45] greed.
[57:47] It's a restless mind. That's a greedy
[57:49] mind. No offense. I was going to use the
[57:52] the title today, a hungry mind,
[57:55] and I didn't. But there's a way that we
[57:58] got to recognize our minds can be so
[58:00] insatiably hungry to the detriment of
[58:03] the thirsty soul.
[58:05] The detriment of our heart that can only
[58:07] try find true satisfaction in the word
[58:09] of God. It's the heart that can only
[58:10] find pleasure in the in as Christ
[58:12] reveals himself through his word. And
[58:14] now that process has been co-opted by
[58:16] all these cheap thrills and all these
[58:18] cheap rewards. As we said, the devil has
[58:19] reverse engineered the reward mechanisms
[58:22] to where now patience has died because
[58:24] we don't have the perseverance to stick
[58:27] with things to get the real reward from
[58:28] Christ.
[58:29] There's no more delayed gratification.
[58:31] There's no more pressing.
[58:34] As I'll close with our text, Philippians
[58:37] chapter 4:es 4-7. We'll pick up on the
[58:40] remainder later. Be careful for nothing.
[58:43] Let me just read it. I just can I'll
[58:45] come back to some of these phrases. Be
[58:46] careful for nothing.
[58:48] but in everything by prayer and
[58:50] supplication with thanksgiving.
[58:54] I was going to use this over the last
[58:55] few weeks. They've done a number of
[58:57] studies that have shown that gratitude
[58:59] impels our acceptance of short-term cost
[59:01] and increase our patience for long-term
[59:04] gains. That if someone is grateful, if
[59:06] they have a sense of gratitude, they
[59:08] will accept in the end losses and cost
[59:11] and pressure
[59:13] knowing that in the long term they'll
[59:15] get a better reward. And just the
[59:17] disposition of being grateful achieves
[59:19] that.
[59:20] That's why the Bible says do it with
[59:21] thanksgiving.
[59:23] If you're not grateful, if you don't
[59:24] have gratitude, if that's not a
[59:25] condition of your your mind, it's not a
[59:27] virtue you're promoting, you're going to
[59:28] be saying, "No, no, Lord. I want it now.
[59:30] I want it now. Please give it to me."
[59:31] But a sense of gratitude gives us a a
[59:33] more endurance. So, be careful for
[59:36] nothing, but in everything by prayer and
[59:38] supplication with thanksgiving, let your
[59:40] requests be made known unto God. And the
[59:42] peace of God which passeth all
[59:44] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[59:46] minds through Jesus through Christ
[59:48] Jesus.
[59:49] We're familiar with the scripture. Be
[59:52] careful for nothing. This means be
[59:54] anxious for nothing.
[59:56] Do not give place to that restless
[59:58] uneasy desire. That's what it speaks of.
[1:00:00] Be careful for nothing. The uneasy
[1:00:01] desire. Do not be restless for things
[1:00:04] that cannot produce joy. Do not be
[1:00:07] overly desirous for things, worldly
[1:00:09] things. Don't have this uh lack of
[1:00:12] moderation when it comes to the cares of
[1:00:13] this life.
[1:00:17] Be careful. We could say that it's not
[1:00:19] asking us to not be careful for
[1:00:21] anything, but he's speaking to these
[1:00:24] things that do not promote joy.
[1:00:27] We ought to be desires of the things of
[1:00:28] God. There ought to be things that we're
[1:00:30] longing for, but we ought to have no
[1:00:31] anxious for this anxiety for anything.
[1:00:35] And he says it with in in everything
[1:00:42] by everything.
[1:00:45] The the phrase is in every time
[1:00:48] as often as there is opportunity or the
[1:00:50] need requires
[1:00:52] let your request be made known to God.
[1:00:55] But in everything by prayer and
[1:00:56] supplication prayer means it the word
[1:00:59] that's used for prayer there is a time
[1:01:00] and a place that's set aside to seek
[1:01:02] God. by prayer. I have a time. I have a
[1:01:06] moment. The prayer that's referred to
[1:01:07] there is not necessarily the act of
[1:01:09] praying or making supplication, but it's
[1:01:12] the it's a word that would be used to a
[1:01:13] Hebrew if they couldn't go to the
[1:01:15] temple. They found a place set aside and
[1:01:17] away from distractions, a quiet place to
[1:01:19] say, I have prayer is to be set aside.
[1:01:22] Prayer is to find a place. I'm going to
[1:01:24] find a place or time to seek God. And by
[1:01:26] prayer and supplication, the
[1:01:28] supplication means a desire for God, a
[1:01:30] longing for God.
[1:01:31] Amen. Amen.
[1:01:32] And what is Paul saying? That where
[1:01:34] there is anxiety, where there is a
[1:01:36] restless mind, God is the one who can
[1:01:38] help.
[1:01:39] Brother Brandham says that prayer is not
[1:01:41] exactly bringing God down to man. It's
[1:01:43] bringing man up to God. As you pray, you
[1:01:46] lose sight of these earthly things.
[1:01:48] This is something that's being lost.
[1:01:49] This is something that we don't have
[1:01:51] distance. We're not carving out a place
[1:01:53] of meditation. We're not given to deep
[1:01:55] thought and quiet moments because we're
[1:01:56] always being sensitized by devices. We
[1:01:58] might even find ourselves reading our
[1:02:00] Bibles on our cell phones and we're
[1:02:01] keeping up with the notifications. We're
[1:02:03] distracted by other things coming in and
[1:02:06] we actually don't have prayer anymore.
[1:02:10] Because prayer is not just the act of
[1:02:11] begging. Prayer is not just the act of
[1:02:13] talking to God. But prayer is time and
[1:02:15] space,
[1:02:17] a place where you desire God.
[1:02:20] That isn't even really prayer if it's
[1:02:23] not a supplication. If it's not a desire
[1:02:25] for God, a longing for God. Be careful
[1:02:27] for nothing. be anxious for nothing.
[1:02:29] Well, how how how do I help this
[1:02:30] anxiety? How do I help this restless
[1:02:32] mind? Start praying
[1:02:34] because by prayer and supplication and
[1:02:36] gratitude, you can make your requests be
[1:02:38] known unto God. And it says, "And the
[1:02:40] peace of God, quietness,
[1:02:42] security, safety, prosperity,
[1:02:46] fearing nothing from God."
[1:02:49] There's nothing we fear from God.
[1:02:52] As Awtoer said, there's nothing in the
[1:02:54] will of God I fear and there's nothing
[1:02:56] out of the will of God I want.
[1:02:58] That's peace.
[1:03:03] He says the peace of God which passeth
[1:03:05] understanding. It's greater than our
[1:03:06] thoughts, higher than our wants.
[1:03:09] It's a superior state of mind. Brothers,
[1:03:12] if you could come to your instruments,
[1:03:14] be careful for nothing,
[1:03:17] but in everything by prayer, by making a
[1:03:19] place, by setting aside a time to seek
[1:03:22] God, and by supplication, longing for
[1:03:26] God, maybe we need to uncover the
[1:03:27] longing.
[1:03:30] Maybe we need to go through the
[1:03:31] multitude of our thoughts.
[1:03:35] I love it how David just assumed in his
[1:03:38] language that he had a right to the way
[1:03:39] of life, the way of understanding.
[1:03:43] Search me, oh God, and know my heart.
[1:03:44] Try me and know my thoughts. Go through
[1:03:46] them, sift through them,
[1:03:49] and then find the right ones.
[1:03:52] See if there be any painful way in me, a
[1:03:54] man or a habit, a way of thinking, a way
[1:03:55] of desiring that has become unfruitful.
[1:03:57] And Lord, divide me from that. Get rid
[1:03:59] of it. But identify those pure thoughts.
[1:04:01] Cuz Paul, we come to maybe the next
[1:04:03] service. whatsoever things are true and
[1:04:04] honest and pure. There's things in your
[1:04:06] mind that are of good report. There's
[1:04:08] things we can meditate on. There's
[1:04:10] thoughts. There's processes. There's a
[1:04:12] way that we can have our minds centered
[1:04:13] and focused on Christ. He says in Psalms
[1:04:16] 94:19, "In the multitude of my thoughts
[1:04:19] within me, thy comforts delight my
[1:04:22] soul."
[1:04:23] I say this of you that in the multitude
[1:04:25] of your thoughts and your compulsions
[1:04:27] for this and your desire for that, maybe
[1:04:29] if it be for uh for the young people,
[1:04:31] this desire for social clout, the the
[1:04:33] the the addiction to social rewards, the
[1:04:35] belonging, the feelings, the camaraderie
[1:04:37] of friends, and you have all these
[1:04:39] multitude of thoughts of how I'd be
[1:04:40] perceived and how am I being treated and
[1:04:42] and and all the things that we go
[1:04:44] through, which is a battle in the mind
[1:04:46] that in the multitude of my thoughts,
[1:04:47] Lord, I know somewhere in there that
[1:04:50] that it's that my comfort is from you.
[1:04:55] Thy comforts delight my soul.
[1:05:00] Lord, try my thoughts. Sift through
[1:05:01] them. If we can't find that place and
[1:05:04] that space to pray, if we can't have
[1:05:06] that supplication where we're design
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:34] think you know everything must be just
[1:05:38] this way way we think.
[1:05:41] I don't know. Maybe someone thought
[1:05:42] you're the one that's scientific,
[1:05:43] brother Aaron.
[1:05:45] Yeah. I love it. I love it that science
[1:05:48] is just catching up with God's word
[1:05:50] already told us. Whether it be in the
[1:05:52] message or the Bible, there's this weak
[1:05:54] mind, this depraved mind, this this
[1:05:56] restlessness in our minds is constantly
[1:05:58] seeking, constantly searching. And we've
[1:06:01] got to find a way to get out of that
[1:06:02] thought process.
[1:06:05] Be careful for nothing.
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:10] Be careful for nothing.
[1:06:15] God, help us today.
[1:06:17] [Music]
[1:06:18] God rest my mind. Is there anybody here
[1:06:21] that just be honest today? I got a mind
[1:06:23] that just has this static in it all the
[1:06:25] time. Got like this just this buzzing
[1:06:29] and and it never goes away. It's a
[1:06:32] restlessness.
[1:06:33] Maybe the doctor say, "Oh, that's just a
[1:06:35] chemical process and it's this and it's
[1:06:36] that." And maybe the world will say,
[1:06:37] "Well, what you need to do is, you know,
[1:06:39] get rid of your cell phone. You need to
[1:06:40] go on a in a sense deprivation tank or
[1:06:45] you need to go on this retreat or you
[1:06:47] need to go smoke this weed or something
[1:06:48] like that. Who knows what the world has
[1:06:50] to offer you? But I know a God who right
[1:06:52] now can start to do a wonder in your
[1:06:53] heart.
[1:06:55] A God right now who can begin to address
[1:06:56] things that's been taking place in your
[1:06:58] mind. You just have to first be honest.
[1:07:00] And instead of trying to justify your
[1:07:02] compulsive behaviors, just be honest and
[1:07:04] say, "Lord,
[1:07:09] [Music]
[1:07:10] I feel like a prophet now.
[1:07:13] I knew I would need this one."
[1:07:16] Just say to yourself, "Lord, I'm going
[1:07:17] to be honest with you today. I'm anxious
[1:07:20] about a lot of things.
[1:07:22] Lord, I'm going to be honest with you
[1:07:23] today. My heart is cumbered about with
[1:07:25] much serving my selfish anxieties."
[1:07:30] Think of how easy it would have been for
[1:07:32] Martha to be like, "Oh, Christ is here.
[1:07:33] He's coming. I need to make sure
[1:07:36] everything's right, and I I I don't want
[1:07:37] him to be a wallflower, and I want to do
[1:07:38] to him what everybody else is doing."
[1:07:40] And she's so busy with the pretense not
[1:07:43] not so busy want to take care of Christ
[1:07:45] not realizing it's all an act of
[1:07:46] pretense.
[1:07:48] It was all it was all selfish anxiety.
[1:07:50] It was all selfish care because really
[1:07:52] what Jesus wanted at the end of the day
[1:07:54] was for her to sit at his feet and that
[1:07:57] would be his entertainment.
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:00] You know, brother Brandham said about
[1:08:01] the ark finding rest
[1:08:04] in the temple and he says that's where
[1:08:06] the Holy Spirit finds rest today in you.
[1:08:09] God is seeking rest.
[1:08:12] I can say this. You got a restless mind,
[1:08:14] but there's also a restless God who's
[1:08:17] longing to be your all in all who wants
[1:08:19] to find that place of preeminence in
[1:08:21] your heart. And if you can start today
[1:08:23] by being honest with the things that
[1:08:24] you're going through, the things that
[1:08:25] you're suffering, the things that are
[1:08:27] bombarding your heart and bombarding
[1:08:28] your mind, and you say, "Lord, I'm going
[1:08:29] to be honest. I've got this static. I've
[1:08:31] got this buzz. I've got this this desire
[1:08:33] for certain things, and I don't know if
[1:08:34] I can overcome it." I'm telling you,
[1:08:36] maybe we could even use the words that
[1:08:38] it's an addiction and say, "God, I need
[1:08:39] you today to give me a deliverance."
[1:08:42] And not because you just want to be free
[1:08:43] of that platform to join another, but
[1:08:45] because you want the wonder of Christ to
[1:08:47] be restored.
[1:08:49] We're the one that has that has upset
[1:08:51] the world. God made it beautiful.
[1:08:57] He made it wonderful for us,
[1:09:01] but we've upset it with the way that we
[1:09:03] think. I say, "Lord, help me today with
[1:09:05] my thoughts. Help me with the way that
[1:09:08] I'm thinking." God bless you.
