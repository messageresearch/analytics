[0:00] as we go a step further in the subject
[0:02] of the Kingdom
[0:04] and identifying things that were at the
[0:07] heart of God things that were if we
[0:09] could call it Heaven's mystery but then
[0:11] are going to become magnified and
[0:14] manifested in the earth as we've been
[0:15] looking at that subject I'm taking from
[0:18] uh
[0:20] character expression to a kingdom
[0:23] identity and so there may be multiple
[0:26] Parts on this I try not to get hung up
[0:28] on the title but I do give some thought
[0:29] to it and I want there to be some
[0:31] continuity I heard from a brother here
[0:33] recently who found that my titling
[0:35] system was very confusing so I said well
[0:38] what do you suggest and he came up with
[0:39] volume and sub volumes and sub-genres
[0:42] and everything else and he said maybe
[0:44] this isn't maybe this isn't better but I
[0:46] appreciated the effort and I'm always
[0:47] open to suggestions I can always revert
[0:50] to Jesus Christ part 762.
[0:53] but here we're looking at Kingdom
[0:55] identity and in ways we're looking at
[0:58] how we identify the kingdom of God or
[1:00] the identification of the Kingdom and
[1:03] how it is identified in the lives of
[1:05] God's children those who have the life
[1:07] of the king will manifest and declare
[1:10] the character of the Kingdom
[1:12] and as we think about how Kingdom Life
[1:15] is expressed I want it to be very
[1:18] relevant to us I think I repeat then
[1:20] repeating these things quite often over
[1:22] the past three years that what happens
[1:24] within these four walls has less to do
[1:27] with the kingdom than what happens on
[1:29] the outside what takes place here is
[1:31] feeding on the word of God and
[1:33] ministering to one another and things
[1:35] that challenge us and shape us and set
[1:37] us in the right path and God manifest
[1:40] and declares his presence amongst us in
[1:42] our in our Gatherings like this but
[1:44] where the kingdom really is effective is
[1:46] when we leave and we live out amongst
[1:48] the people we get down to our daily
[1:49] lives and so that's as we've said before
[1:52] this is a sanctuary and we ought to be
[1:54] going from one Sanctuary to another when
[1:56] we return home and my wife even shared
[1:58] with me this morning about just a burden
[2:00] as a family and how we our whole must be
[2:04] a sanctuary in the way that it the
[2:06] feeling that it must occultivate in the
[2:08] presence of God being welcome and so
[2:10] there's a a bird there's a
[2:12] responsibility ability that we have not
[2:13] just to perfect our church services but
[2:16] to declare and manifest the kingdom
[2:18] Beyond ourselves Beyond these four walls
[2:21] so it has to do with our manner of
[2:23] living and even the order of our home
[2:25] and our home life our marriages and and
[2:27] the way those things uh operate now this
[2:31] is hopefully just going to grab from
[2:33] last two services in some way carry over
[2:35] thought in John chapter 10 verse 37
[2:38] Jesus says
[2:41] if I do not the works of my father oh I
[2:44] knew I was forgetting something
[2:46] but the David Cleveland and brother
[2:48] Joshua Shepherd put together this
[2:50] beautiful backdrop so I'm very grateful
[2:52] for all their efforts and their labor in
[2:54] doing this it was supposed to make me
[2:55] look better but I think that probably
[2:56] failed in that regards because there's
[2:58] just some things you can't fix
[3:01] but thank you so much for their labor
[3:03] and putting this together still making
[3:05] some changes and we trust that you're
[3:08] patient as things evolve he says if I do
[3:11] not the works of my father believe me
[3:14] not now as we looked at Hebrews chapter
[3:16] 1 and it said about Jesus Christ that he
[3:18] was the express image of God and that
[3:21] was he was the character of God he was
[3:23] the very nature and character of God
[3:24] that to us would be invisible and that
[3:26] maybe we would speculate as to In Christ
[3:30] he has declared and his character is
[3:32] declared he's the express image and that
[3:34] word is character
[3:35] and what I want to draw your to your
[3:39] bring back to your remembrance or Draw
[3:41] to your attention is we're told and
[3:43] we're taught very clearly in the message
[3:44] that God identifies himself by his
[3:47] characteristics so we recognize God and
[3:49] know who God is by his characteristics
[3:52] and almost everything brother Bram said
[3:54] is identified by its characteristics
[3:56] whether it be plant life or animal life
[3:58] if you're going to distinguish among
[4:00] certain certain trees or mushrooms or or
[4:03] animal life you have to look down into
[4:05] the characteristics my my boys were
[4:08] fishing quite a bit at their
[4:09] grandparents Pond and they came back so
[4:11] we found a frog and its head is
[4:13] completely blue and like wow that's
[4:15] fascinating you know and you you kind of
[4:16] wonder what it is and so you just kind
[4:18] of look it up and that particular
[4:20] characteristic says it's probably
[4:21] poisonous
[4:22] and and so there's certain traits and
[4:25] and you know is it black and yellow kill
[4:27] a fellow or whatever it is when you
[4:28] think about snakes and is reading a book
[4:30] about mushrooms is there certain ones
[4:32] that may look like you'd want to eat
[4:33] them but you can't eat them and you know
[4:35] it by its traits or its characteristics
[4:37] and so everything is identified by its
[4:40] characteristics this is where I'm
[4:41] getting the thought of Kingdom identity
[4:44] the characteristic is something if you
[4:47] use it as an adjective it's pertaining
[4:48] to or indicating character it's a
[4:51] characteristic of something it it speaks
[4:53] of its character it's that which
[4:55] identifies character and as we looked
[4:58] into the Greek of the word character the
[5:01] express image it's an engraved mark
[5:03] a symbol or an imprint upon the soul so
[5:07] it's a defining quality and what is on
[5:10] the inside of one person as the Bible
[5:12] says as a man thinketh in his heart
[5:14] that's how he really is he can do things
[5:17] externally but if the heart if it
[5:19] doesn't line up with the heart that's
[5:20] hypocrisy but eventually what's on the
[5:22] inside is what's being expressed on the
[5:24] outside
[5:25] and that's that that I defining quality
[5:28] of an individual is their character
[5:31] as Jesus says if I do not the works of
[5:34] my father Believe Me Not So these works
[5:38] are things that identify character these
[5:41] are things that are unique enough to God
[5:44] or say if we see these things it brings
[5:46] us to the word of God which is God
[5:49] and brother Branham says in the sermon
[5:51] God identified himself by his
[5:52] characteristics his characteristic he
[5:55] said Jesus said in Saint John 10 37 if I
[5:58] do not the works of my father
[6:01] and I don't have that character of my
[6:04] father then don't believe me now I love
[6:07] that amplification of it because as we
[6:09] said before there might be certain
[6:10] things we say oh well these are the
[6:11] works of Christ these are the works that
[6:13] he does and we could on a very surface
[6:16] level impersonate them say oh well these
[6:18] are the works of God but now there's
[6:20] more to it than just something on the
[6:22] surface but he says if I don't have the
[6:24] character of my father then don't
[6:26] believe me they are one they identify
[6:30] his character and me his characteristics
[6:33] so it's it's the whole package
[6:35] because the father is the word in the
[6:37] beginning was the word and the Word was
[6:38] with God and the Word was God and the
[6:41] characteristic of God is displayed by
[6:43] his promise for that age
[6:47] this is a very important principle that
[6:49] brother Brown expresses over and over
[6:51] again how that God would manifest
[6:53] himself according to a promise in
[6:55] particular ages and in doing that you
[6:58] had to recognize the promise for that
[7:00] age and then as the light moves on as
[7:03] the light moves on whatever is true in
[7:05] that age is true for the subsequent age
[7:07] but there's a there's a way that you can
[7:09] hold back in a former light there's a
[7:11] way that you could participate in the
[7:13] promises of God in a glare of another
[7:15] age so when he says God is identified by
[7:17] his characteristics in the promise for
[7:20] that age
[7:22] and examples that he would use to say if
[7:24] Moses showed up and he had a staff in
[7:26] his hand and a rod in his hand he said
[7:27] I'm coming to deliver you all out of
[7:29] Phoenix and he said this is what God did
[7:31] in the days of the Exodus from Israel he
[7:34] sent a prophet named Moses and a guy
[7:35] standing up here bat pounding the rod
[7:37] saying I'm Moses I'm Moses say oh well
[7:40] this must be him that you have to go to
[7:42] the promise of your age to recognize the
[7:45] characteristics of God and who he is in
[7:49] that age that he's wanting to express
[7:50] himself in
[7:51] so this is Brother Branham showing us
[7:54] that God is identified by his
[7:56] characteristics and the kingdom the
[7:59] kingdom is God expressed
[8:01] it is the very it's the character of God
[8:03] made manifest in the lives of his people
[8:07] to look further into
[8:09] identification let's turn our Bibles to
[8:12] First Corinthians chapter 14.
[8:16] verses 6 to 11.
[8:19] and then we'll jump to verse 26 and
[8:22] we'll read the
[8:23] verse 40.
[8:26] I'm looking at this and the Lord just
[8:28] really drew me to this
[8:30] because of how Paul is dealing with
[8:32] identification
[8:34] and how when something expresses itself
[8:36] how we relate to it and how that we can
[8:39] discern what it is based upon how its
[8:42] characteristics
[8:43] and then where he transitions to later
[8:46] on in this chapter is quite remarkable
[8:48] it says now Brethren if I come unto you
[8:50] speaking with tongues what shall I
[8:52] profit you
[8:53] except I shall speak to you either by
[8:56] Revelation or by knowledge or by
[8:58] prophecy sign or by Doctrine so he's
[9:02] establishing an order of emphasis he's
[9:05] establishing that in the end the goal is
[9:07] understanding in the end in the end is
[9:09] knowledge and wisdom and to know and
[9:11] brother Branham uses the phrase the
[9:12] order of the anointing and he's talking
[9:14] about how the Holy Spirit can fall and
[9:16] it can manifest certain things but
[9:18] there's a certain order to the anointing
[9:19] and hear the prophet to that age is
[9:23] establishing this order of emphasis it
[9:26] says in even things without Life Giving
[9:28] sound whether pipe or harp except they
[9:31] give a distinction in the sounds how
[9:34] shall it be known what is piped or heart
[9:37] ow I don't know Paul's musical
[9:39] background and I don't know if some
[9:40] would reject him weighing in on music if
[9:43] he didn't have a degree in musicology
[9:45] but he is saying that without order and
[9:48] without Harmony or Melody you can't
[9:51] discern a tune
[9:53] that just because someone is piping and
[9:55] someone is harping and someone is
[9:56] drumming and someone is banging on the
[9:58] uh big black box you bang them white
[10:00] keys and there's all these sounds that
[10:01] are taking place unless there's some
[10:03] sort of harmony with the parts unless
[10:06] each one knows their role and there's
[10:07] some sort of arrangement without order
[10:10] without uh one compliment in the other
[10:13] he says you can't discern what the tune
[10:14] is
[10:16] it reminds me of a story one time where
[10:19] brother Isaiah Brooks was out with some
[10:21] young men and after a youth meeting
[10:22] right there a recording session and uh
[10:25] they were I think brother Kenny was
[10:27] there with them brother Ben Erickson and
[10:29] different ones and they were at a fast
[10:31] food restaurant and and they uh and they
[10:33] said their brother something was they're
[10:34] they're waiting to order someone brother
[10:36] said brother Isaiah what do you think
[10:37] about this music and he goes I can't
[10:40] hear the music over this machine like no
[10:43] that is the music and so to him he
[10:45] thought it was a machine
[10:47] and so if you don't if it's not if
[10:49] there's something you can't take away
[10:50] from it you can't discern the melody you
[10:53] can't discern the tune but then also
[10:55] it's disconcordant you can't enjoy it
[10:58] there's times when maybe you're
[10:59] listening to something and you don't
[11:00] hear all the sound you just hear maybe
[11:02] one part and it sounds just concordant
[11:04] it's like that doesn't sound right
[11:05] that's because only one part is being
[11:07] emphasized and then when you bring all
[11:09] the volumes up correctly and you mix the
[11:11] Cradle oh no that's beautiful it all
[11:13] works together otherwise there's Discord
[11:16] and this is what Paul is saying that if
[11:18] you don't if it gives if there be a
[11:21] distinction without the distinction it
[11:22] becomes just gibberish
[11:25] is that the very words that's being said
[11:26] without distinction and sounds it's just
[11:28] jabbering it's just chattering and he's
[11:30] saying the same thing about tongues
[11:31] unless unless there be some clarity
[11:33] brought to it unless there's some
[11:34] interpretation that follows it's just
[11:36] unintelligible talk it doesn't edify
[11:38] anyone other than the one that is
[11:40] speaking
[11:41] anybody and he's talking about
[11:43] characteristics and identifying for if
[11:46] the trumpet give an uncertain sound that
[11:48] means you're not sure what is it what
[11:49] does this mean
[11:50] what is this uh is this retreat
[11:54] is this Advanced is this Dan Dan
[11:56] Butterfield Butterfield Butterfield what
[11:58] which one is it
[11:59] and he says for if the trumpet give it
[12:01] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[12:04] himself to the battle so likewise ye
[12:07] accept ye utter by the Tongue words easy
[12:10] to be understood how shall it be known
[12:12] what is spoken for ye shall speak into
[12:15] the air
[12:16] there are it may be so many kinds of
[12:19] voices in the world and none of them is
[12:23] without signification that means every
[12:25] sound every voice has a meaning
[12:27] every voice has an idea or concept
[12:30] that's attached to it and there's
[12:32] something behind it there's some
[12:34] reasoning there's some rationale there's
[12:36] some uh there's something that's trying
[12:38] to be accomplished and if that's the
[12:40] case our what we become and how we act
[12:43] isn't based together on all together
[12:45] upon what we see and what we hear but
[12:47] our discernment of The Voice or the
[12:50] emphasis behind what we're seeing and
[12:51] what we're hearing
[12:53] so everything is with signification so
[12:55] there's some concept attached to it
[12:57] therefore if I know not the meaning of
[13:00] the voice if I can't discern it by its
[13:02] characteristics if I can't figure out
[13:03] what it's trying to say I shall be unto
[13:06] him that speaketh a barbarian and I find
[13:08] this to be very extraordinary the way he
[13:10] says this in the example of speaking
[13:13] with tongues if someone is just speaking
[13:14] with tongues and Paul says if I don't I
[13:18] don't know what he's saying he thinks
[13:19] I'm a barbarian and he that speaketh
[13:21] shall be a barbarian unto me and that's
[13:24] why now you figure out why they're both
[13:26] pointing at each other saying the other
[13:28] one's wrong
[13:29] all right because one speaking with
[13:31] tongues you can't understand them and so
[13:32] to to him you're a barbarian and then
[13:35] and then you're looking at him saying
[13:36] well you're a barbarian you mean you
[13:39] don't understand what I'm saying you're
[13:40] a barbarian I don't understand what
[13:41] you're saying you're a barbarian
[13:43] and that's kind of real heavy language
[13:46] to be used
[13:47] he's saying there's so many voices
[13:50] all with meaning and intent that are
[13:53] trying to attract our attention
[13:55] and if if we don't understand the voice
[13:58] it causes confusion
[14:00] if the meaning cannot be identified you
[14:02] don't know the character of it he says
[14:04] it's barbaric which means rude or
[14:07] approachful
[14:08] that one speaking in tongues thinks the
[14:10] one who can't understand them to be a
[14:12] barbarian and Paul say but you're a
[14:14] barbarian to me you're rude you're
[14:15] reproachful all because the voice the
[14:18] meaning the intent can't be discerned
[14:21] now as Paul is identifying chaos and
[14:24] confusion
[14:25] based upon the manifestation of
[14:28] of a gift he says in verse 26
[14:33] how is it then Brethren when you come
[14:35] together
[14:37] every one of you have to Psalm hath a
[14:39] Doctrine half the tongue Hatha
[14:40] Revelation have an interpretation
[14:43] he says let all things be done unto
[14:45] edifying it has to build it has to
[14:48] promote has to encourage it has to
[14:50] strengthen If any man speak in an
[14:52] unknown tongue I recognize what's
[14:54] happening as a prophet is looking at a
[14:57] church we recognize that this church had
[14:58] some issues
[14:59] and clearly uh they when they would come
[15:02] together they have a Psalm a doctor and
[15:04] a tongue of Revelation interpretation
[15:05] and so we see these things must have
[15:07] been operating in their midst but
[15:09] recognize just how much sin he's having
[15:11] to deal with and attitudes he's having
[15:12] something to deal with at the same time
[15:13] but he says let all things be done unto
[15:15] edifying and now he's putting things in
[15:17] order if any man speak in an unknown
[15:20] tongue Let It Be by two or at the most
[15:22] by three in that by course and let one
[15:25] interpret it I I'm not wanting to get
[15:28] into this as an uh as commentary on the
[15:31] gifts of the placing of the gifts I
[15:32] believe brother Brown does a tremendous
[15:33] job of that
[15:34] but I want you to recognize the
[15:36] principle of a prophet to an age setting
[15:39] things in order
[15:40] but if there be no interpreter let him
[15:42] keep silence in the church let him speak
[15:45] to himself and to God
[15:47] let the prophet speak two or three and
[15:49] let the other judge if anything be
[15:52] revealed to another that sinneth by it
[15:53] let the first hold his peace for you may
[15:56] all prophesy one by one that all may
[15:58] learn and all may be comforted
[16:01] this is this is a very uh specific words
[16:04] he says in the spirit of the prophets
[16:07] are subject to the prophets brother
[16:10] Brandon he refers to this he says the
[16:12] word of God is first never secondarily
[16:15] that that when the preaching the word is
[16:17] going forth the gifts are subject to
[16:19] that and if they operate in an eruption
[16:22] to that he's saying that's out of order
[16:24] because the word is first he said that
[16:27] the the most Supreme and most powerful
[16:28] anointing that Jesus Christ had the
[16:31] Supreme anointing the most powerful
[16:32] anointing that Jesus Christ had
[16:34] manifested itself when he opened the
[16:36] scroll and began to teach in wonderful
[16:38] words proceeded from his mouth so that
[16:40] is in the brother brahm's own words
[16:41] that's re-identifying the anointing the
[16:43] Supreme anointing the supreme power is
[16:46] when the word is going forth and so the
[16:48] word of God is first never secondarily
[16:50] and the spirit of the prophets is
[16:52] subject to the prophet so there's got to
[16:54] be order
[16:55] and and when he when he's dealing with
[16:57] this when the messenger deals with this
[16:58] he says and he gives the example where
[17:01] when one would say something in the name
[17:02] of the Lord and if it doesn't happen he
[17:04] said that's a lying spirit
[17:07] in ought to have that Spirit prayed off
[17:08] of him and what do we do then we
[17:10] recognize the word is first and if
[17:13] anyone in expressing a gift before the
[17:16] people prophesies interprets a dream or
[17:18] says something in the name of the Lord
[17:20] that is wrong that is air and he said
[17:23] that's an evil spirit
[17:27] and therefore we give honor to the word
[17:29] of God to be saying well that's what the
[17:30] word says and that's what the prophets
[17:32] should recognize and accept
[17:35] and the spirit of the prophets are
[17:37] subject to the prophets for if for God
[17:40] is not the author of confusion
[17:44] that's instability disorder
[17:47] is he saying that when you come one has
[17:49] a song one has a doctor who has a tongue
[17:51] one has a revelation one has an
[17:52] interpretation he says let things be
[17:53] done to the edifying if this is how it's
[17:56] going to be and all this pulling and
[17:58] pushing and shoving and everything that
[17:59] he said that's that's not going to edify
[18:01] that's not going to build up
[18:03] for God is not the author of confusion
[18:05] but of Peace as in all churches of the
[18:09] Saints
[18:10] it's not the author of instability or
[18:12] disorder but he's the author of Peace
[18:13] which is harmony or Accord
[18:16] this is ties right back into what Paul
[18:18] was saying that if if one speak in
[18:19] tongues and one doesn't understand there
[18:22] is disconcordant if all are just
[18:24] speaking in tongues and there's no
[18:25] interpretations that's disconcordant
[18:27] he's saying but God is not the author of
[18:29] confusion but of Peace which is harmony
[18:32] or cord so he's bringing it right back
[18:34] into his analogy of harmonizing and when
[18:37] it comes to music and he says one is
[18:39] piping and one is harping the pipe is
[18:41] different than the heart
[18:42] they both give different sounds but
[18:44] there's a way that they can work
[18:45] together to where they're lifting up and
[18:47] expressing the same thing
[18:49] and what I'm wanting to draw from this
[18:53] is Paul looking at things that can be
[18:56] things that are of God and hopefully
[18:58] we'll get into this more here in a
[18:59] moment so we can see this
[19:01] things that are of God and how that God
[19:03] wants to use them to build up and to
[19:05] edify but they have to have the
[19:08] character of God with it
[19:10] and here Paul in this age this is the
[19:13] prophet putting the age in order
[19:15] and I find it remarkable too because you
[19:17] don't
[19:18] this is kind of a glimpse into church
[19:20] order because Paul was specifically
[19:22] dealing with them when they come
[19:23] together
[19:24] and he's dealing with the gathering
[19:26] together and this is where he gets in
[19:27] with the Corinthian Church about
[19:28] communion and he's placing things in
[19:31] order this is a prophet placing Church
[19:33] order this is the prophet play placing
[19:35] the Believers in order within their
[19:37] churches
[19:39] and brother Branham as we mentioned it
[19:41] to you before
[19:42] he said the proof of the indwelling
[19:44] spirit was to acknowledge and follow
[19:47] what God's Prophet gave for his age as
[19:50] he set the church in order
[19:54] yeah
[19:55] so if anyone in First Corinthians 14 in
[19:57] the Corinthian Church objected to this
[20:00] and was stubborn and stiff-necked and
[20:02] said no sorry not going to do it we like
[20:04] the way we're doing it that would be
[20:06] proof or give you enough reason to doubt
[20:09] whether or not this person was what they
[20:12] said they were remember how brother
[20:13] Brown said faith and works her husband
[20:15] and wife if a man has faith and claims
[20:17] to uh uh to have to have it apart from
[20:20] work she says you have reason to doubt
[20:22] that claim just like a man who says he's
[20:24] married and can't produce a wife
[20:26] understand what the works of the
[20:28] indwelling spirit are it's not just
[20:31] works that we might think are good
[20:32] because you could try to do God of
[20:34] service without it being his will but
[20:35] it's works that conform with the
[20:37] character of God therefore the proof of
[20:39] the indwelling spirit are works that
[20:41] acknowledge and follow God's order for
[20:44] that age
[20:48] the word of God is first never
[20:50] secondarily so it's to acknowledge and
[20:52] follow what God's Prophet gave for his
[20:54] age this is a prophet placing things in
[20:57] order
[20:59] I hope this doesn't seem to be too much
[21:01] of a um a jerk of the steering wheel but
[21:03] let's catch where he goes next as you
[21:05] look at verse 34.
[21:07] as he's placing things in order in the
[21:09] church and I don't think it's a
[21:10] coincidence
[21:12] that he's he's
[21:13] addressing these things and then the
[21:15] very next thing he has to deal with is
[21:17] he says let your women keep silence in
[21:19] the churches
[21:20] for it is not permitted unto them to
[21:22] speak
[21:23] but they are commanded to be under
[21:24] obedience as also saith the law
[21:28] and if they will learn anything let them
[21:30] ask their husbands at home for it is a
[21:33] shame for women to speak in the church
[21:36] these are very controversial words of
[21:39] poem with each day that passes they get
[21:41] more and more controversial
[21:43] now whether or not we want to wrestle
[21:44] with the interpretation of it and try to
[21:47] figure out a way that we can water it
[21:48] down or narrow it down whatever it may
[21:50] be we can all at least acknowledge he's
[21:52] saying let the women keep silence in the
[21:54] churches this is just exactly how it's
[21:56] been translated for us it's not
[21:57] prevented for them to speak they're
[21:58] commanded to be under obedience I say
[22:00] the law and he says if they'll learn
[22:02] anything let them ask their husbands at
[22:04] home
[22:05] to me this is one of the single greatest
[22:08] evidences that your pastor is not your
[22:10] husband spiritually speaking if you
[22:13] thought I was your spiritual husband I'm
[22:15] divorcing you right now
[22:17] except you sister Elizabeth
[22:19] I am nobody's spiritual husband
[22:23] Christ is your spiritual husband and
[22:26] sisters who are married your husband is
[22:30] your pastor spiritually speaking at home
[22:32] I'm your pastor literally speaking
[22:35] in the local church and this is Paul
[22:38] preserving the order of the marriages
[22:40] the order of the home where none can
[22:43] assert God's original order he says let
[22:45] the women learn at home by asking their
[22:48] husbands
[22:50] for it's a shame for women to speak of
[22:52] the church he goes what I just like that
[22:54] what he says and then this is really
[22:58] pointed came the word of God out from
[23:00] you or came it unto you only
[23:03] do you think your church and the way you
[23:05] do it's the only right way
[23:07] are you the first church of the Bride
[23:09] are you the first church of of the of
[23:12] the Christianity and that's exactly what
[23:14] Paul is saying what you think you're the
[23:16] only church you think the way you do
[23:18] things is the way things ought to be
[23:19] done he says if any man think himself to
[23:22] be a prophet or spiritual let him
[23:25] acknowledge that the things that I write
[23:27] unto you are the Commandments of the
[23:29] Lord he's challenging any spirit that
[23:31] would raise up and try to use some sort
[23:33] of excuse or justification to disregard
[23:36] what the prophet had to say and I say
[23:38] this is the word of God to us in this
[23:41] age we ought to never think more of
[23:43] ourselves than we ought to we ought to
[23:45] be willing as individuals as ministers
[23:47] as a church make ourselves subject to
[23:50] the word of God for this age and if we
[23:52] claim to be a prophet or spiritual we
[23:55] must acknowledge that the things that
[23:57] this messenger taught us are the
[23:59] Commandments of the Lord and they are
[24:02] right
[24:04] he says but if any man be ignorant let
[24:06] him be ignorant
[24:09] wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy and
[24:12] forbid not to speak with tongues what
[24:14] beautiful balance
[24:16] let all things be done decently and in
[24:19] order
[24:20] decently in its proper form
[24:23] Paul doesn't Paul doesn't say one thing
[24:26] to turn the gifts into something evil
[24:29] tongues into anything evil and I think
[24:31] that's the that's what the devil kind of
[24:33] does sometimes is you draw some of us
[24:35] offsides and he wave something in our
[24:37] face and he gets us to say something
[24:38] against against something when we
[24:42] shouldn't have never spoke to begin with
[24:44] Don't Let The Devil tempt you whether
[24:46] the devil can tempts some to clown for
[24:48] him and do all sorts of fanaticism but
[24:51] you can fall for the same trap by
[24:53] speaking against things that you don't
[24:55] need to even speak against it
[24:59] it's indecently is in the proper form
[25:02] if when to do something decently means
[25:05] it's becoming reverence
[25:08] it's well formed it actually comes from
[25:10] the the Latin Forma speaking of beauty
[25:12] or shape it's shapeless well-formed
[25:15] it's not out of form it's not
[25:17] disproportionate it's not exaggerated
[25:19] it's something that the symmetry of it
[25:21] and the balance of it presents Something
[25:23] Beautiful
[25:25] let everything be done decently in the
[25:27] proper form with becoming reverence and
[25:29] in order that means a fixed Arrangement
[25:31] the do or proper course the right order
[25:34] or orderly condition
[25:37] and as I was reading the scriptures
[25:39] yesterday I just maybe late in the
[25:41] afternoon and and my mind is always
[25:44] drawn to this concept that when God in
[25:46] the beginning when he created and and
[25:48] brother Branham saying that God spoke
[25:49] and as things were formed he let
[25:52] something go so far he says stop right
[25:54] there he said stop right there and it
[25:56] wasn't random that God knew exactly what
[25:59] he was doing to where now there are
[26:02] comments that we can time and there are
[26:05] certain manifestations in the heavens
[26:07] that we could predict is going to happen
[26:09] on the dot even whether it be blue moons
[26:11] or whether it be full moons these things
[26:13] are timely because God said it that way
[26:16] in the beginning
[26:17] and brother man said I thought of the
[26:18] order of the Heavenly Host not one of
[26:20] them is out of place everyone keeps its
[26:23] time perfectly and he calls it God's
[26:26] Great Army the heavens the Stars the
[26:29] planets are all declaring something
[26:31] about God
[26:32] in Psalms 19 verses 1 to 3. I'm looking
[26:34] at this to recognize Paul said let all
[26:37] things be done decently in order this
[26:39] identifies something about God the
[26:41] heavens declare the glory of God and
[26:44] that that phrase the glory of God is so
[26:46] important because this glory is a
[26:48] character the heavens declare the
[26:50] character of God and the firmament
[26:52] showeth his handiwork and a man's
[26:54] character is known by his words so the
[26:56] character of God is declared in his
[26:58] creation it's declared in the heavens
[27:00] it's declared in those endless galaxies
[27:02] as it seems and the firmament the stars
[27:05] and the moon show his character show his
[27:07] handiwork and then this is what it does
[27:09] day under day utter of speech
[27:11] and not in a night show with knowledge
[27:13] there is no speech nor language where
[27:15] their voice is not heard
[27:20] he continues says in them he have said a
[27:21] tabernacle for the son do you not see an
[27:24] image of the Bride
[27:25] that this is what God has called us to
[27:27] be that where our lives lived out that
[27:29] there's no speech or language where his
[27:31] voice has not been heard
[27:33] as you are the company that publishes
[27:35] the word of God you're the one that
[27:36] declares it the heavens declare the
[27:38] glory of God the firmament showeth his
[27:39] handiwork and it's speaking a language
[27:42] it's showing knowledge
[27:44] it's orderly it's in its place brother
[27:47] Branham again as I pick up on this and
[27:49] the greatest battle ever fought he says
[27:50] then I began to think that not one of
[27:51] those things gets out of their place
[27:53] they're all set in place this is the
[27:55] order of the Heavenly Host not one of
[27:57] them out of place
[27:58] he said if there's a move in anywhere of
[28:00] them it's for a cause and will affect
[28:02] this Earth
[28:04] we just see the results of it now from
[28:06] some of them moving into their spots
[28:08] it's effective it affects everything we
[28:10] see that in the tides
[28:12] and even how I believe it was brother
[28:15] Jason Watkins one time that expressed uh
[28:18] it's it seems something said that if the
[28:20] Earth was just kind of moved
[28:22] in its relation to the sun a little bit
[28:24] this way a little bit that way that it
[28:25] we could have been either too cold or
[28:27] too hot that God fixed us in a position
[28:29] and even the moving of the Earth on its
[28:32] axis and its rotation around the Sun
[28:33] creates the seasons so it affects things
[28:36] and I thought then if the great Heavenly
[28:38] Host like that has to keep its place to
[28:40] make everything in order they don't keep
[28:43] their place if they don't keep their
[28:44] order
[28:45] he says what about the disorder of the
[28:48] Earthly host
[28:50] how when one gets out of order how it
[28:52] whole throws the whole thing out of
[28:54] cater
[28:55] the whole program of God is upset when
[28:58] one member gets out of order
[29:00] we should continually to strive to keep
[29:03] the order of the spirit
[29:06] this is what Paul and brother man
[29:08] preached the same gospel that Paul
[29:09] preached and I say brother Brandon
[29:10] preached First Corinthians 14 and this
[29:13] is Paul recognizing the power that how
[29:16] God wants to use the gifts and how he
[29:18] can declare himself and manifest himself
[29:20] through the operation of the gifts
[29:21] therefore he's saying we must strive to
[29:24] keep the order of the spirit
[29:26] in Paul as he sets it forth he said God
[29:29] is not the author of confusion but of
[29:31] peace and God does not want to do things
[29:34] in the church in such a way to cause
[29:35] confusion so if we're going to do things
[29:37] let's do it under the edifine he's
[29:39] saying that the church as it operates on
[29:41] a local level in their church services
[29:43] he says when you come together the
[29:45] church should be a reflection of God's
[29:47] creation should be a reflection of God's
[29:50] character where there's form and there's
[29:52] order when God created there was form
[29:55] when God created there was an order we
[29:57] see it in nature that form an order they
[29:59] Reign they rule it's predictable because
[30:01] God is a god of order God is a god of
[30:04] structure God is a god of arrangement
[30:06] that's why he says women you learn from
[30:08] your husbands at home and he won't break
[30:10] that order because that's the way God
[30:12] does things
[30:15] there's an order
[30:17] and you'll find and this has been
[30:19] counsel given to me for even before I
[30:21] was a pastor even before I was
[30:22] ministering I remember a pastor sharing
[30:25] with me how that someone came to him uh
[30:27] for advice and he gave good advice but
[30:30] he broke the order
[30:31] that God God would have wanted it to be
[30:33] done in and in doing that God finds
[30:35] himself sometimes he can't bless even
[30:38] your desires if you don't honor his
[30:40] order
[30:42] and so God is a god of order
[30:45] we as opposed talking about the church
[30:48] and its characteristics should reflect
[30:49] this order
[30:50] this form we as individuals ought to do
[30:53] the same
[30:55] Abraham says in the sermon greater than
[30:56] Solomon's here says Pentecostal people
[30:58] let me say this with love that's the
[30:59] reason you're not getting anywhere
[31:01] you've got gifts he says you Baptist the
[31:04] same way and I love how he just he's
[31:05] wearing two gloves right equal rights
[31:07] and equal lefts Baptist the same way the
[31:10] gifts that's in the church God give the
[31:13] church the power but he never took it
[31:15] away from the church
[31:17] uh if anyone would want to get uh so
[31:20] full of unbelief to disregard and
[31:22] disavow the gifts brother Brandon's
[31:24] going to challenge it I can show you
[31:25] where he give it to the church you show
[31:27] me where he took it away
[31:30] this is the challenge he says you
[31:32] Baptist before brother Branham addresses
[31:34] the Pentecostal people he realizes I got
[31:36] to address the Baptist too because they
[31:38] may all be over there going yeah let
[31:39] them have yeah as soon as they said you
[31:40] Pentecostal people the Baptist said yeah
[31:43] and we got more baptic hostels in the
[31:45] message than anywhere and so he's got to
[31:47] he's going to get us on both ends
[31:49] so he says oh you say that let me say
[31:51] this with love and the Baptist start you
[31:52] know they get the popcorn right let me
[31:54] deal with you first
[31:56] you deny the gift say oh God took him
[31:58] out that was only given just to
[31:59] establish the church and there's a lot
[32:00] of dispensationalist and God took it
[32:02] away and that was only for the apostles
[32:03] he says he gave it to the church he
[32:05] didn't take it away now he addresses the
[32:07] Pentecostals you've got the power but
[32:09] you don't know how to use it you're not
[32:11] reverent enough
[32:13] that's the reason you're all speaking
[32:15] with tongues you just use it anyway
[32:17] some be speaking in tongues others doing
[32:20] this and just like a Babylon
[32:24] he says don't do that
[32:25] put things in their places
[32:28] put all the gifts in there your teachers
[32:31] your apostles
[32:34] put everything in its place and then
[32:36] operate in decency in an order you'll
[32:39] find God is a god of order and he'll
[32:42] bring the thing right up then
[32:44] this is where you'll edify this is where
[32:47] you'll build up this is where things
[32:48] will be strengthened as when the power
[32:51] that God put in the church you let it
[32:53] operate according to its character
[32:57] the gifts that's in the church God put
[32:58] them there he never took them away
[33:01] but he says you're not reverent enough
[33:05] it says you'll find that God is the god
[33:07] of order God identifies himself by order
[33:10] God identifies himself by things being
[33:12] in their place
[33:13] so if you change the order you change
[33:15] the meaning
[33:16] you change if you change the order maybe
[33:19] I should say this when you change the
[33:20] order you change the image
[33:22] and when the image changes the messaging
[33:24] changes
[33:26] if God is a God if he's an invisible God
[33:28] and he's made known by his
[33:29] characteristics and then you just you
[33:32] change the order of those
[33:33] characteristics it presents an image of
[33:36] God that's not true and then the
[33:38] messaging is wrong
[33:40] it Causes Chaos it causes confusion
[33:45] after you'll turn in your Bibles to
[33:46] Isaiah chapter 4
[33:52] I I just this identification and I know
[33:55] that might feel a little chopped off
[33:58] but I held some back just to resurface
[34:00] these things
[34:01] in the future Services as we deal with
[34:03] this so that we could kind of follow the
[34:05] same template
[34:09] God is made known by his characteristics
[34:11] if I do not the works of my father
[34:12] believe me not if I do not operate in
[34:14] the character of God and Paul sets the
[34:17] Corinthian Church in order by saying
[34:19] we've got to manifest the character
[34:21] nature of God God is a god of order the
[34:23] proof of the into one of the spirit is
[34:25] that you acknowledge and follow that the
[34:27] the there's God's a god of structure God
[34:29] of arrangement now that doesn't mean
[34:31] that God is
[34:33] uh formal
[34:35] in the sense that it's so rigid it's so
[34:38] structured it becomes sterile but God's
[34:40] a god of order
[34:42] God's a god of precision
[34:45] and if you change the order you change
[34:47] you change God's meaning and it becomes
[34:49] chaos or confusion
[34:52] now in Isaiah Chapter 4 verses 1 and 2
[34:54] we've been emphasizing this quite a bit
[34:56] and I apologize uh to those who are only
[34:59] catching this service alone if it leaves
[35:01] a lot to be desired but he says in
[35:03] Isaiah Chapter 4 verses one and two and
[35:05] in that day seven women shall take a
[35:07] hold of one man
[35:09] saying we will eat our own bread and
[35:11] wear our own apparel only let us be
[35:13] called by thy name to take away our
[35:15] reproach and we see this image of the
[35:17] culmination of Satan's Eden the climax
[35:19] of Satan's agenda that now through seven
[35:22] Church ages we've built a queen of Satan
[35:25] a bride of Satan identified through even
[35:27] these Seven Ages that the the daughter
[35:30] of a harlot and they want to be called
[35:33] Christians they want the name but they
[35:36] don't want the word
[35:38] and focusing on verse two as we have
[35:41] much in the past in that day
[35:43] shall the branch of the Lord be
[35:45] beautiful and glorious
[35:47] and the fruit of the Earth shall be
[35:49] excellent and comely for them that are
[35:52] escaped of Israel
[35:54] let's look at this for a moment the
[35:56] branch of the Lord shall be beautiful
[35:58] and glorious this is the order and the
[36:01] character of the Church of God this is
[36:04] the order and the character of the Bride
[36:05] brother Brown in the sermon God hiding
[36:07] himself in Simplicity then revealed
[36:09] himself in the same now I think it's our
[36:11] duty to make the inside right by the
[36:13] grace of God to be so grateful to our
[36:15] God he's talking about the changes that
[36:18] had been made at the Tabernacle and how
[36:20] they're rededicating the church after
[36:22] some remodel has been done and certain
[36:24] things have been moved around and he's
[36:26] looking at the maybe the outside and the
[36:28] way things would present externally said
[36:30] this is great this is fine uh having a
[36:32] new backdrop is great and it's got my
[36:34] back always
[36:36] uh and and there's there's things we
[36:38] said this is nice this is really good
[36:39] but that's not what makes the church a
[36:42] church
[36:43] and he says this he says we have a duty
[36:45] to make the inside right by the grace of
[36:47] God and we say the inside right it's not
[36:50] this
[36:51] hey
[36:52] this is good though I like this but
[36:55] that's not the end making the inside
[36:56] right making the ends of it has to do
[36:59] with a feeling a welcoming Spirit a
[37:02] character of God that that is as welcome
[37:04] in here he says this will just all not
[37:06] only be a beautiful building that will
[37:08] come to but may everyone who comes in
[37:10] see the beautiful characteristic of
[37:12] Jesus Christ in every person that comes
[37:15] in
[37:15] may it be a consecrated place to our
[37:18] Lord a consecrated people for no matter
[37:20] how beautiful the structure is
[37:23] that we certainly do appreciate
[37:25] the beauty of the church is the
[37:28] character of the people
[37:31] that's the real beauty of a Church's
[37:33] character that's the rest where the real
[37:35] power is is in the character I trust
[37:37] it'll always be a house of God of beauty
[37:41] that's that when it comes from the
[37:43] character of the people there's a lot of
[37:45] things externally that think that
[37:48] churches can have her that we can
[37:49] manufacture
[37:51] oh we love the gingerbread right it gets
[37:53] our eye the curb appeal and those are
[37:55] things that might seem kind of good but
[37:57] that has nothing to do with Glory that
[37:59] has nothing to do with power that has
[38:01] nothing to do with the real Beauty the
[38:02] beauty of the church is the character of
[38:04] the people
[38:06] and that day the branch of the Lord
[38:07] shall be beautiful
[38:09] that speaks of character it shall be
[38:11] glorious that means honor Splendor
[38:14] dignity
[38:15] reverence reputation
[38:19] to be glorious speaks of character
[38:24] this is this is order
[38:26] now in that day seven women shall take a
[38:28] hold of one man
[38:30] and let's just review that for a minute
[38:32] seven women taking hold of one man
[38:34] saying we'll eat our own food and wear
[38:37] our own clothes but give us your name
[38:40] they want his name
[38:41] but they want to eat what they want to
[38:43] eat they want to wear what they want to
[38:45] wear
[38:47] they want the name but they want their
[38:49] own expression
[38:51] what they feed on nurtures their nature
[38:55] what they what they feed on is the
[38:56] nurture what what they're what they're
[38:58] wearing is an expression of their nature
[39:01] so they don't want to change
[39:03] what they feed on and what they manifest
[39:05] the nurture and the nature we want the
[39:07] name but we don't want anything else to
[39:09] change
[39:10] and by taking on the name and continuing
[39:13] to nurture a particular way in manifest
[39:16] a particular way causes confusion
[39:18] because the character wouldn't properly
[39:21] identify the name
[39:24] let me have your name but let me eat my
[39:26] own bread and wear my own apparel it
[39:28] goes back to Faith and works being
[39:30] husband and wife and so you take someone
[39:32] who has the works and they call
[39:34] themselves a Christian but you can't
[39:36] find their husband anywhere you can't
[39:38] find them feeding them you can't find
[39:39] them dressing them you can't find them
[39:41] dwelling there but they have a lot of
[39:43] talk to try to show it up they all know
[39:44] we're in a Christian Church we're a
[39:45] Christian church but you can't find the
[39:47] word in their midst it's only lip
[39:49] service and that's what brother Bradham
[39:51] said when he when he addresses something
[39:53] whenever you try to show that they're
[39:55] anti-word they're excuses well we get
[39:57] results don't we and they want to go to
[39:59] the works but they don't have deity in
[40:01] their midst because they haven't
[40:03] welcomed and received the word
[40:06] and when they have the name but they
[40:09] don't have they have their own
[40:10] expression it causes confusion
[40:14] good it's the same confusion when
[40:15] brother man says if a man can't produce
[40:17] his wife you can doubt his claim
[40:19] if the woman has the name
[40:21] but doesn't have any other
[40:22] characteristic or attribute of being
[40:24] married that causes confusion
[40:26] and God is using the character of women
[40:30] to identify the disorder and Chaos of
[40:32] the time in Isaiah chapter 4.
[40:35] he's using the woman
[40:38] now let me be very clear about this the
[40:41] rebuke of the women is the rebuke of the
[40:42] man
[40:44] so the men aren't escaping by it's just
[40:46] like brother but I'm saying you
[40:47] Pentecostals and all the Baptists go
[40:49] right they don't realize but they're
[40:51] part of it too they're getting their
[40:52] correction too
[40:54] God is using the character of women to
[40:56] identify the disorder and Chaos of the
[40:58] age because the woman identifies the
[41:01] character of the man
[41:02] I think about that very deeply
[41:06] in the sermon the chosen of a bride
[41:09] we should be wrapping up here pretty
[41:10] soon
[41:12] I think oh wait never mind maybe not
[41:14] I didn't realize what page I was on
[41:17] he says
[41:18] in the chosen of a bride he says the
[41:20] kind of woman that a man would choose
[41:23] will reflect his ambition and his
[41:25] character
[41:27] so a man's ambition and character
[41:29] is something that we would say is an
[41:31] imprint on his soul
[41:33] and that this is something internal but
[41:36] now there's his Works will declare his
[41:38] character and now the woman that he
[41:40] chooses shows what's in the man
[41:44] if a man chooses the wrong woman it
[41:46] reflects his character
[41:49] what he ties himself to shows truly
[41:51] what's in him
[41:53] a woman reflects what's in the man when
[41:57] he chooses her for wife
[41:59] I'm wanting to think about this very
[42:01] very deeply that what is when a man
[42:03] chooses a woman that it's a reflection
[42:06] of him
[42:07] it shows what's down in him no matter
[42:09] what he says outside watch what he
[42:13] married
[42:16] now
[42:17] some people may be listening to this and
[42:19] think that's a death sentence
[42:22] but it's a challenge
[42:24] that if you have if you believe your
[42:26] principal and you have character then
[42:27] it's your responsibility to bring that
[42:29] out
[42:30] you have it is incumbent upon the man to
[42:33] bring that out
[42:35] but it's a reflection a woman is a
[42:37] reflection of a man's character so when
[42:40] God in Isaiah chapter 4 is rebuking the
[42:43] women of that age the men can't just be
[42:44] able to have these women they've sure
[42:46] made a mess of things yep always the
[42:48] woman it would come back on the men
[42:50] because they are a reflection of the
[42:51] failure of the fathers a reflection of
[42:53] the failure of the men so the women are
[42:55] reflecting the age
[42:57] and when it says seven women the seven
[42:59] women in this reflect the spirit that
[43:01] was on that age they're religious yet
[43:04] rebellious against headship
[43:06] there was a harshness there there was a
[43:07] stubbornness
[43:09] brother Branham in the sermon Oneness so
[43:10] we could see that how this this symmetry
[43:12] to the end times
[43:14] he says I've got thus saith the Lord 30
[43:16] years ago when I entered the ministry he
[43:17] told me that the strain of women would
[43:20] come so immoral and imputed in the last
[43:22] days they'd be the most defiled thing on
[43:25] the Earth right
[43:29] she started it at the beginning
[43:31] and Satan used her at the end
[43:35] and look what's happening look down
[43:37] through the years said she'll continue
[43:39] to strip herself and said there'll just
[43:41] be a tiny a little tiny group of the
[43:44] very elected that's predestinated we'll
[43:46] Escape that
[43:48] when the vision come I was worried then
[43:50] I thought women I turned back over in
[43:52] the Bible to Isaiah I believe I think he
[43:55] says the fifth chapter but it's the
[43:56] fourth chapter and it said the branch
[43:58] that has escaped from the daughters of
[44:01] Zion and that day will be beautiful to
[44:04] the Lord
[44:05] so he was drawn to this very scripture
[44:07] to identify the condition of women in
[44:10] the last days the seven women will take
[44:12] a hold of one man want to eat their own
[44:14] bread and wear their own apparel and by
[44:17] name be called a Christian church but he
[44:19] says the strain is so immoral
[44:22] that God used women at the beginning
[44:24] Satan used women at the beginning he
[44:26] uses her at the end but there'll be a
[44:28] tiny group that escapes
[44:30] the branch will escape the daughters of
[44:32] Zion will be beautiful
[44:35] there's only seven women expressed
[44:37] something about the spirit on the age
[44:40] but them that are escaped they're the
[44:42] ones that escape the spirit of the age
[44:44] they're the ones that escape the
[44:46] judgments that come upon the age now her
[44:49] Escape is by judgment her Escape is by
[44:52] purging her Escape is by the word but
[44:54] she escapes the punishment that's coming
[44:56] upon the age
[44:59] she will be delivered as Isaiah chapter
[45:01] 1 prophesied
[45:03] brother Branham says in the invisible
[45:04] unit of the bride of Christ I read these
[45:07] statements Wednesday night a portion of
[45:08] these Now Catch the part just before
[45:10] this because you're talking about the
[45:11] bride having a Revival notice this
[45:13] character when you see women just go on
[45:16] the Rampage just doing anything they
[45:18] want to do watch the church is doing the
[45:21] same thing
[45:22] notice but watch them the spiritual
[45:24] bride when she begins to have a Revival
[45:26] look at how different these characters
[45:28] are one is just doing whatever they want
[45:30] to do but the spiritual bride when she
[45:32] begins to have Revival when she begins
[45:34] to come back and line herself up with
[45:36] the word of God watch then again you see
[45:39] how that the scriptures at that time
[45:41] there'll be a message sweep out to catch
[45:44] that bride catch that woman elect
[45:47] this is the message that they
[45:49] acknowledge and follow well there's a
[45:51] spirit on the age that's causing the
[45:53] women to Rampage and just do anything
[45:54] they want to and this is magnified in
[45:57] the churches church is a woman it's a
[45:59] it's a type of a woman so whatever the
[46:00] woman is doing in society the churches
[46:03] are guilty of the same way in
[46:04] Christendom and he's saying there'll be
[46:06] a message to put that in order there'll
[46:08] be a message to catch the elector out in
[46:10] the chaos and that's the message that
[46:13] they acknowledge and follow and that's
[46:15] your Revival
[46:18] and not the traditions of men that have
[46:20] made it into something that's not but
[46:22] your Revival is when you catch the word
[46:24] acknowledge it and line up with it
[46:26] that's the message the promise for this
[46:28] day he continues in the same sermon it
[46:30] happened the same thing when Pentecostal
[46:32] first started they dropped them women
[46:34] right back in line with the word and
[46:36] then they Drift Away
[46:38] there she goes right back over into
[46:41] chaos he's looking at that layout of
[46:43] seeing age he's looking at that movement
[46:45] and he's recognizing there's a disorder
[46:48] to it where it just lends itself to
[46:50] chaos it becomes confusion they let down
[46:52] the bars the women begin to run things
[46:54] this drop right back women were in line
[46:56] with the word when the restoration of
[46:57] the gifts came but now they begin to
[46:59] drift away drift away from Holiness
[47:00] drift away from the order of the word of
[47:02] God but then the time that the people
[47:04] are ready to line up there is a message
[47:07] comes forth and they line with it
[47:10] this is the voice of Revelation
[47:12] Revelations 18 4 diagnosing the the
[47:15] cancer in organized religion diagnosing
[47:18] the evil spirit that's in spiritual
[47:19] Babylon dietel showed us exposing
[47:22] mystery Babylon exposing the Antichrist
[47:24] and that voice cried out come out from
[47:26] amongst are my people that you be not
[47:28] partakers of her plagues
[47:31] and brother Adam says what a warning
[47:33] when he catches this scripture what a
[47:35] warning that throws the church exactly
[47:37] back to Revelations 3 14 to the
[47:39] laodicean age lawlessness
[47:42] real religious but lawlessness
[47:45] no order No Authority
[47:50] the due course the right order the
[47:52] spirit of the prophets is no longer
[47:54] subject to the prophet
[47:56] now as we've kind of just going back
[47:59] quickly over those things in Isaiah
[48:00] chapter 4 I'd like to turn a corner now
[48:04] and this is where I thought it was a
[48:05] moment ago when I thought I was
[48:06] finishing so just seven minutes behind
[48:08] schedule
[48:11] and Isaiah the content catch the context
[48:13] of this is we just read it in verse one
[48:15] and at that day seven we should take
[48:16] hold of one man
[48:18] and the branch of Lord shall be
[48:19] beautiful glorious there's your contrast
[48:22] in Isaiah chapter 3 is the context for
[48:25] this
[48:26] and let's just look at verse 16. can you
[48:28] follow me in this for a little bit
[48:30] brother Brown took Isaiah chapter 4 and
[48:32] made it a
[48:34] uh end time scripture
[48:37] this is relevant to us now this is the
[48:40] context for these seven women this is
[48:42] what the seven women are doing and this
[48:43] is a contrast to the one bride moreover
[48:47] the Lord Lord saith because the
[48:48] daughters of Zion are haughty that means
[48:50] they're arrogant
[48:52] and walk with stretch forth next it's
[48:54] this pretense
[48:55] right by outward appearance they want to
[48:57] appear taller
[48:58] they want to appear better and so this
[49:00] is the pretense of the woman they're
[49:03] arrogant and they're concerned about
[49:06] their appearance the way they appear
[49:08] and wanton eyes it's a the word speaks
[49:11] of an ogling to make the eyes glance
[49:14] about but a lot of the translations I
[49:16] even think in the Greek render it they
[49:18] walk with painted eyes
[49:21] walking and mincing as they go that
[49:24] meantime is to take quick little steps
[49:26] and even fashion will tell you that
[49:29] walking with high heels causes you to
[49:31] make shorter strides
[49:33] and they're mincing as they go and I
[49:35] won't demonstrate mincing
[49:37] I could do it with a sharp knife but
[49:39] he says and making a tinkling with their
[49:42] feet ornaments about their feet too to
[49:45] to make noise to draw attention
[49:48] and what the the prophet is showing us
[49:51] is that there's this pride of beauty
[49:54] there is this infatuation with the
[49:56] outward adorning
[49:58] and what we could identify is the
[50:00] pretense of Satan in the beginning
[50:02] who's all about the show
[50:04] who's all about the big things and all
[50:07] about the glamor and all about the glitz
[50:08] and all about the things that we think
[50:10] May our breed we are pretty glorious and
[50:12] even when brother Brahm is preaching the
[50:14] Seventh Son he says man something like
[50:15] this you'd think it would be in a big
[50:16] Cathedral somewhere you're thinking have
[50:18] this kind of manifestation this kind of
[50:20] look he says it's so humble you're
[50:21] looking right over the top of it
[50:23] it's not something with the ankle
[50:24] bracelets and bells jingle and it's not
[50:26] with neck stuck out there's it's not
[50:28] this image that's being portrayed in
[50:29] these women where they're under the
[50:31] influence of satanic design
[50:35] the music as they mince and the dancing
[50:38] and the tinkling of their feet the
[50:39] stretch forth next
[50:41] and this is because they're haughty
[50:43] walking with stretch forth next mincing
[50:44] as they go verse 17 therefore the Lord
[50:47] will will Smite with the scab the crown
[50:51] of the head of the daughters of Zion
[50:53] and the Lord will discover their secret
[50:56] parts
[50:59] I'm gonna
[51:01] I'll be ending I want to read the next
[51:04] verses to verse 24.
[51:07] man I I want to pause for a moment and I
[51:09] want you all to ponder that for a second
[51:11] these women are going to be smitten in
[51:13] the head
[51:14] and the crown of their head is going to
[51:17] be a scab
[51:19] he smites the head with baldness
[51:22] showing that the women have rejected
[51:24] headship
[51:25] and they're losing their Glory
[51:28] think of how significant when we come
[51:30] over to the New Testament even how
[51:32] significant a woman's covering is
[51:34] and what her hair represents
[51:36] and then this attitude he smites the
[51:39] scab their head the crown of their head
[51:41] with the scab it means he smites them
[51:43] with baldness
[51:45] now again I'm going to leave this with
[51:46] you so you can chew on this for a little
[51:48] bit but the Syriac and Arabic Arabic
[51:50] translations render it this way
[51:53] he's going to take away that which
[51:55] distinguishes their sex
[51:59] now you now you chew on that
[52:02] spiritually
[52:03] think about this
[52:05] that in this day
[52:07] the Lord has allowed the curse
[52:10] and the delusion to become so strong
[52:12] it's eradicating the difference between
[52:15] a man and a woman
[52:17] and you might think oh well that's good
[52:19] because I don't I don't wear flannels
[52:21] and and Levi's as a woman and uh and Doc
[52:25] Martin Boots and you might think you're
[52:26] doing pretty good but there's an image
[52:28] there's an image of a woman that's out
[52:30] of her place
[52:31] and it has to do with headship to the
[52:34] word and headship to her husband and
[52:36] when she gets out of order she is taking
[52:38] the very thing that distinguishes who
[52:40] she are who she is and takes away her
[52:43] distinction and God is saying the Lord
[52:45] will Smite them in their head and cause
[52:47] them to lose their Glory that which
[52:50] distinguishes them who they really are
[52:54] and this is the condition of the modern
[52:56] day this is the condition of the modern
[52:58] confusion and brothers identifies that
[53:00] men wanted to become women women want to
[53:02] become men and in a complete eradication
[53:04] of the distinction and the
[53:06] characteristics between a man and a
[53:08] woman
[53:10] he'll Smite them
[53:12] and cause them to lose their glory and
[53:14] their distinction
[53:23] you think it I know that I'm very
[53:25] careful not to weigh in on these things
[53:27] I think I've mentioned it before but
[53:29] it's absolutely happened to where now
[53:30] women are realizing they're fourth class
[53:32] citizens is the phrase that's being used
[53:34] because it's men
[53:37] men who identify as women women who
[53:39] identify as men and then real women
[53:42] and they become fourth class they're
[53:44] they're gone
[53:46] womanhood's broke
[53:48] relegated to fourth class
[53:50] and then he says I'm going to strip them
[53:52] naked because he says the Lord will
[53:53] discover their secret parts
[53:55] this brings us to laodicean age
[53:57] revelation 3.
[53:59] where they're rich increase with Goods
[54:00] their necks are stuck out they think
[54:01] they have everything but he exposes The
[54:03] Emperor's New Clothes
[54:06] strips them naked the Lord will discover
[54:08] their secret Parts I know that strong
[54:10] language
[54:12] and notice what he's going to do in that
[54:14] day the Lord will take away The Bravery
[54:16] of their tinkling ornaments about their
[54:18] feet
[54:18] and their calls and that and they're and
[54:22] as it's uh looking how that they
[54:25] do their hair and their round tires like
[54:27] the moon the chains and the bracelets
[54:29] and the Mufflers the bonnets the
[54:30] ornaments of the legs and the headbands
[54:31] and the tablets and the earrings the
[54:33] Rings and nose Jewels the changeable
[54:34] suits of apparel and the mantles and the
[54:36] wimples and the crisping pins the
[54:38] glasses and the fine linen in the hoods
[54:39] and the veils
[54:40] and they'll succumbed to pass that
[54:42] instead of sweet smell there shall be
[54:44] stink
[54:45] and instead of a girdle of rent
[54:47] and instead of well-set hair baldness
[54:49] instead of a stomacher a gird in a
[54:51] sackcloth and burning instead of beauty
[54:58] there's a
[55:01] lot of confusion about what's beautiful
[55:04] a lot of confusion about what real power
[55:06] is
[55:07] but brother Brown takes this very
[55:08] scripture and he brings it down to our
[55:09] end times in the flashing red light of
[55:11] the sign of his coming
[55:14] this is the purging this is the judgment
[55:17] these are the seven women who want to
[55:19] eat their own bread and wear their own
[55:20] apparel but when he says the branch Lord
[55:22] shall be beautiful this is what they
[55:23] escape
[55:25] them that escape this is these are the
[55:28] ones that acknowledge and hear the word
[55:29] of God and if it be by the spirit of
[55:31] burning their Purge If It Be by the
[55:33] spirit of Correction they're corrected
[55:34] but this is what they're corrected to
[55:36] about
[55:37] brother Brown in the sermon the flashing
[55:39] red light of the sign of his coming Eve
[55:41] got from behind the word of God and that
[55:44] caused every heartache every graveyard
[55:46] every sin that was ever committed
[55:48] started right there here it is again
[55:51] what women were the cause of the first
[55:53] fall and women ends up the end time she
[55:57] started it she ends it
[55:59] now that's true in the evil sense
[56:02] she started it she ends it let me just
[56:04] say this you have something to say about
[56:07] the end
[56:08] no wonder the Bible said
[56:11] those that escape out of Zion shall be
[56:13] glorious in the sight of the Lord
[56:15] he's bringing it right back to Isaiah 4.
[56:18] women started at the beginning
[56:20] she ends it but there's those that
[56:21] escape
[56:23] in Isaiah 4 he talked about how the
[56:24] immorals of the women would get in the
[56:26] last days and how to be such so much
[56:28] clothes that they'd have and they'd have
[56:30] set have to set their hair set and
[56:32] everything like that the Bible speaks
[56:33] that in Isaiah 3 how she'd walk with
[56:36] high-heeled shoes on this is how he
[56:37] characterizes it
[56:39] remember how I think it was uh brother
[56:41] Brown's mom who had the dream I had this
[56:43] woman with high-heeled shoes was trying
[56:45] to walk and brother I said sister you
[56:46] can't you can't walk that way without
[56:48] that on and as she began to walk he got
[56:51] narrower and narrower as you walk up
[56:53] Mount Zion it gets narrow and narrow as
[56:55] you walk up the statue of a perfect man
[56:57] it gets narrow and narrow I know there's
[56:58] parts of us that want to think well
[57:00] that's just old-fashioned that's just
[57:01] funny daddy that's just a clothesline
[57:02] religion listen there's a purpose to
[57:05] Holiness there's a reason why brother
[57:06] Branham taught men to dress up the way
[57:08] off the dress to act away out the dress
[57:10] present themselves a certain way there's
[57:12] a reason why he asked the women to do it
[57:13] a certain way and the chaos you see in
[57:16] the world today is the very reason why
[57:18] the word of God was so plain and
[57:20] preserved so that we could sanctify our
[57:22] spirits and our homes to not be
[57:24] influenced and identified with the
[57:26] spirit that's on the world today to try
[57:28] to make our men look like women and our
[57:30] women like men they said sister you
[57:32] can't walk this way with those shoes on
[57:34] listen that's not old-fashioned funny
[57:36] dirty that's the word of God
[57:43] he says you let the women walk with
[57:45] high-heeled shoes Tink on her feet as
[57:46] she went along and she would roll down
[57:48] their stockings and things she'd do and
[57:49] how many changeable said apparel and
[57:51] stuff like that he's quoting Isaiah 3.
[57:54] and all that will be taken away from her
[57:56] and she shall sit and stink from immoral
[57:59] set her hair baldness instead of a
[58:01] stomach or girding of sackcloth and
[58:03] burning instead of beauty
[58:04] and said even seven women this is where
[58:07] it comes Isaiah 4. seven women will grab
[58:08] one man and said we'll do our own work
[58:12] this is how brother Brandon describes it
[58:14] we'll do our own work
[58:16] it says well I'll eat my own bread and
[58:19] I'll wear my own apparel but what does
[58:20] that take they've got their own Works
[58:22] they've got their own idea how it ought
[58:24] to be done they've got their own way
[58:26] that they want to present things but the
[58:28] word of God is discarded because God has
[58:30] an image that he wants to protect and
[58:31] uphold he says we'll do our own work let
[58:34] us just take your name to take away our
[58:36] reproach
[58:37] but he said how glorious will that
[58:40] little branch that escape all these
[58:42] things it'll be Holiness unto the Lord
[58:44] in that day
[58:47] when real genuine born-again women know
[58:50] their place
[58:51] though they be laughed at and called
[58:53] silly in old-fashioned and everything
[58:55] but act like a woman like a lady stand
[58:58] like a woman dress like a woman talk
[59:00] like a woman Live Like a Lady
[59:04] this is Kingdom identity
[59:07] now I know that may seem to be hard on
[59:09] the women
[59:10] but I'm not going to take the message of
[59:12] the hour I'm not going to take the
[59:13] scripture and use it as a bully Club
[59:15] to beat up the woman
[59:17] but I will use the word of God to beat
[59:19] up the bully
[59:20] who's trying to bully the women
[59:23] and the women we could take time to go
[59:26] through each one of these things
[59:28] how much pressure is put on the women
[59:32] to the spirit that's on this age
[59:34] and when it says that real genuine
[59:36] born-again women know their place a man
[59:38] has just as much a responsibility of
[59:40] finding that as the woman does
[59:42] Brothers if you could come to your
[59:44] instruments
[59:45] let me close with this in Isaiah chapter
[59:47] 1 verses 24 to 27.
[59:52] women need to act like women men need to
[59:54] act like men there's so many scriptures
[59:55] and quotes here I'm leaving out where
[59:57] Birdman brings it to the the both of us
[1:00:01] when it comes to the character
[1:00:08] Isaiah chapter 1 verses 24 to 27
[1:00:12] therefore saith the Lord the Lord of
[1:00:14] hosts the mighty one of Israel ah
[1:00:17] our ease me of my adversaries
[1:00:20] and avenge me of my enemies
[1:00:24] the Lord is going to do this
[1:00:28] and I will turn my hand upon thee
[1:00:31] and will purely Purge away thy draws
[1:00:34] and take away all thy 10.
[1:00:38] and it may seem like well this is this
[1:00:40] is the end this is
[1:00:42] there's going to be baldness there's
[1:00:43] going to be stink
[1:00:46] there's going to be
[1:00:50] this is going to be Calamity but notice
[1:00:52] what he says
[1:00:54] and I will restore thy judges as at the
[1:00:56] first
[1:00:57] and thy counselors is at the beginning
[1:01:00] this is even going back
[1:01:03] before they rejected God
[1:01:06] afterward Thou shalt be called the city
[1:01:08] of righteousness the faithful City
[1:01:11] that word has to come
[1:01:13] that order has to be observed the
[1:01:16] judging the discernment the counseling
[1:01:18] of the word of God then Thou shalt be
[1:01:20] called the city of righteousness the
[1:01:22] faithful City Zion shall be redeemed
[1:01:25] with judgment
[1:01:27] and her converts with righteousness this
[1:01:30] is what I believe that every believer
[1:01:32] ought to desire is to be judged here
[1:01:34] first by the word
[1:01:36] and to have that Spirit of burning and
[1:01:38] that Spirit of purging to root out of me
[1:01:40] I know we've emphasized this over and
[1:01:42] over again when we dealt with the tares
[1:01:43] but Lord me I'm a microcosm of that
[1:01:46] field I'm a microcosm of the earth even
[1:01:49] Within Myself I represent a field in
[1:01:52] which things have been sown and Lord I
[1:01:54] believe that deep down on the inside
[1:01:55] you've left your mark within my soul but
[1:01:58] in my spirit in my mind and in this
[1:02:00] flesh there's so many other things so
[1:02:02] many other images and calls and round
[1:02:03] tires and such all these other things
[1:02:06] these wimples and crisping pins though
[1:02:08] it might project in a fashionable way
[1:02:10] for women what might it ought to look
[1:02:12] like for a man how does it look within
[1:02:14] my thinking in my mind I said oh Lord I
[1:02:16] will be redeemed with judgment and me
[1:02:19] who is your son I am going to be
[1:02:21] redeemed with righteousness and that
[1:02:23] means I want to be as I ought to be
[1:02:28] oh there I think that there's a this is
[1:02:32] something that's been I've been
[1:02:33] unsettled with because there are certain
[1:02:36] things that I'm rejoicing over and
[1:02:38] there's certain things that I think we
[1:02:40] have every right to praise God but oh
[1:02:42] let's not be load to sleep we have an
[1:02:46] adversary who is with every breath is
[1:02:48] making due use of every opportunity in
[1:02:51] very subtle ways to try to drag us down
[1:02:53] and tear us down and I know we ought to
[1:02:56] be positive and we're always looking to
[1:02:58] the good and we want to be built up with
[1:03:00] a positive gospel but I believe the word
[1:03:02] of God says I'm going to expose and
[1:03:04] discover their secret parts and I'm
[1:03:06] going to expose baldness and I say if
[1:03:09] there be anything in me that is not
[1:03:11] subject to the word of God if there be
[1:03:13] any part of me that's not being covered
[1:03:15] with righteousness then Lord I don't
[1:03:16] want to lull myself to sleep I don't
[1:03:18] want to worship my way into some False
[1:03:20] Image Lord I Want to Be Right
[1:03:22] [Applause]
[1:03:24] and there's a
[1:03:26] there's a false sense of security that
[1:03:28] we can derive
[1:03:32] from a particular momentum
[1:03:35] that we can do as people
[1:03:37] [Music]
[1:03:38] but I want him to have preeminence
[1:03:41] in God's way of redeeming us
[1:03:44] is through judging
[1:03:46] and through righteousness
[1:03:48] that stand together
