[0:00] our gracious heavenly father as we stand
[0:02] in your divine presence this evening
[0:05] we're now turning our attention to your
[0:06] word desiring that
[0:09] you could come up behind it with an even
[0:11] greater force than you did
[0:13] in our worship knowing by faith that you
[0:16] are here and believing also lord if you
[0:18] would make your presence known to us
[0:21] as we lifted our hands and our voices
[0:23] then how much more will you
[0:25] make yourself known if we lift up your
[0:27] word so come now father
[0:30] you be the one that rightly divides the
[0:31] word of truth
[0:33] may you take what we know to be
[0:35] infallible what we know to be perfect
[0:38] this word of god and speak it to our
[0:41] hearts that it may be received into good
[0:43] ground and bring forth
[0:44] good fruit fruit to a hundred fold fruit
[0:47] unto perfection
[0:48] so lord we commit ourselves to you
[0:50] tonight desiring that you continue
[0:52] to move in this service i believe that
[0:54] you have already taken control of it for
[0:56] your glory now lord we just set
[0:58] ourselves aside and desire that you
[0:59] continue this great work tonight
[1:02] as we commit ourselves to you in the
[1:03] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:05] amen let's turn to
[1:08] the book of james james chapter 3 verses
[1:12] 13 to 18.
[1:16] james chapter 3 verses 13 to 18 just
[1:19] some marvelous presence that's here with
[1:21] this tonight
[1:23] so we'll just being very sensitive to
[1:25] that we'll jump right into the word
[1:28] so as to not distract anything james
[1:31] chapter 3
[1:33] starting with verse 13 who is a wise man
[1:37] and endued with knowledge among you let
[1:40] him
[1:40] show out of a good conversation his
[1:42] works with meekness of wisdom
[1:45] but if you have bitter envy and strife
[1:47] in your hearts glory not and lie not
[1:49] against the truth
[1:50] this wisdom descendeth not from above
[1:53] but is earthly
[1:54] sensual devilish for where envy and
[1:57] strife is there is confusion in every
[2:00] evil
[2:00] work but the wisdom that is from above
[2:03] is first
[2:04] pure then peaceable gentle and easy to
[2:07] be entreated
[2:08] full of mercy and good fruits without
[2:10] partiality
[2:11] and without hypocrisy and the fruit of
[2:14] righteousness is sown in peace
[2:16] of them that make peace you can have
[2:19] your seats
[2:21] i'm going to continue on the subject of
[2:24] what does
[2:24] wisdom look like and take
[2:28] uh as we were focusing sunday on wisdom
[2:31] is the word in action and wisdom looks
[2:33] like christ wisdom is christ
[2:35] i want to take this subject of meekness
[2:38] what wisdom looks like and begin to
[2:40] identify meekness and as i i just want
[2:43] to make a few statements in maybe the
[2:45] outset
[2:46] to emphasize this point
[2:49] how that wisdom is the word in action
[2:52] and so when we see wisdom and we know
[2:54] it's true wisdom or even if we don't
[2:56] know its wisdom
[2:57] wisdom is the word in action and the
[3:00] word in action is often contrary to
[3:02] popular wisdom they say well
[3:04] the this is what prevailing uh authority
[3:07] would do and this is what the popular
[3:08] uh uh the population would do and this
[3:11] is what people would do by vote or
[3:13] consent
[3:14] but uh so with the wisdom of god is
[3:16] contrary to popular wisdom but it's
[3:18] never contrary to the word and so it may
[3:21] run counter to
[3:22] our intuition it may be against even
[3:24] some of our instincts
[3:25] but one thing about the wisdom that is
[3:27] from above it will never violate the
[3:28] principles of god's word
[3:30] and we identified on sunday how the
[3:32] mystery of jesus christ holds all
[3:34] treasures of wisdom and knowledge
[3:36] so if you're going to have wisdom real
[3:38] spiritual wisdom it's going to come
[3:39] through the knowledge of jesus christ or
[3:41] understanding of christ if you're going
[3:43] to have real knowledge or any tre any
[3:45] richness in your knowledge any benefit
[3:47] from knowledge
[3:47] it's going to come from the revelation
[3:49] of jesus christ
[3:51] and one of our emphasis has been that to
[3:54] know him
[3:54] and to have this wisdom knowledge
[3:56] understanding revelation however you
[3:58] might want to place it in terms of your
[4:00] vocabulary
[4:01] it gives us practical discernment a
[4:04] discernment that's very practical
[4:05] not a discernment that makes us popular
[4:08] at parties and be able to read people's
[4:09] minds but something that's very
[4:10] practical
[4:11] and it gives us understanding that is
[4:12] useful and this is a discernment this is
[4:15] a wisdom this is an understanding
[4:17] that you can use every day in your life
[4:19] you can use it on the job you can use it
[4:20] in your relationships
[4:22] with other people you can use it within
[4:24] the family you can use it
[4:25] in working through disagreements with
[4:27] your spouse which i know none of us have
[4:28] them that's for the streamers
[4:30] uh but it's it's so that you can work
[4:32] through even raising your children the
[4:34] right way it gives you wisdom practical
[4:36] wisdom and
[4:36] useful understanding now i want to pick
[4:40] up in james chapter 3
[4:42] verse 13 and james is
[4:46] taking wisdom in the book of james
[4:48] you'll find it's something that's
[4:49] repeated throughout and
[4:50] the emphasis that he gives he's placing
[4:52] wisdom as the crown
[4:54] of a true believer's perfect character
[4:56] and how that faith
[4:58] is made perfect by works or perfectly
[5:00] expressed through works
[5:01] he's taking wisdom and he's placing it
[5:03] kind of as a crown of a true believer's
[5:05] character
[5:06] and even the crown of a true believer's
[5:08] faith that you can say you have faith
[5:10] but if your faith doesn't work then your
[5:11] faith is dead and this
[5:13] practical outworking of faith is
[5:15] manifested in wisdom and it becomes a
[5:17] crown in a person's life
[5:19] and so he's emphasizing this faith as a
[5:22] some
[5:22] sort of consummation of a believer's
[5:24] character and so he asked this question
[5:27] james chapter 3
[5:28] verse 13 and we're going to jump into it
[5:30] right here and be right in this area
[5:32] for the remainder of the service he says
[5:35] who is a wise man
[5:37] and endued with knowledge among you so
[5:40] he asked the question who's wise
[5:41] who's endued with knowledge among you
[5:43] let him show out of a good conversation
[5:46] his works with meekness of wisdom
[5:50] so in james asking the question this way
[5:53] who's why
[5:54] who's a wise man who is skilled who has
[5:56] a a particular skill or acumen and who
[5:59] is sharp who's shrewd
[6:00] and he says an endued with knowledge so
[6:02] these are two different principles that
[6:04] are related
[6:05] but he's kind of setting them together
[6:07] to think who's wise
[6:08] who's been empowered with knowledge and
[6:10] this phrase endued with knowledge is not
[6:12] used elsewhere in the new testament
[6:14] though it's a similar phrase that's
[6:16] found in the old testament
[6:17] and endued with knowledge it's one that
[6:19] has the knowledge of an expert
[6:21] who's wise and has the knowledge of an
[6:23] expert
[6:24] and having the knowledge of an expert in
[6:26] wisdom that makes them a particularly
[6:28] useful
[6:29] be one thing to have the wisdom of an
[6:30] expert but not know how to apply it
[6:32] not know how to formulate the best plans
[6:35] and then the best plans for the
[6:36] execution which is
[6:37] best way to execute the plan which is
[6:39] what wisdom speaks to
[6:41] and these are if i could say this way
[6:43] the wisdom or the wise
[6:44] man it speaks to an aspect of wisdom and
[6:47] even to be endued with knowledge speaks
[6:49] about an aspect of wisdom
[6:51] and so these two aspects of wisdom
[6:53] relate to
[6:54] understanding and even moral action it's
[6:57] speaking about somebody who has
[6:58] understanding who has
[6:59] the skills of an expert but yet there's
[7:01] it's a moral action it's something
[7:02] that's practical something that works
[7:04] itself out
[7:05] and even the word that's used about
[7:07] endued with knowledge it speaks of a
[7:08] discernment
[7:09] ability to make distinctions and
[7:12] in this uh aspect of wisdom that relates
[7:15] to understanding and moral action it's
[7:17] not just merely things that are moral
[7:18] it's not relating to
[7:19] a morality and even nature or natural
[7:22] decisions and natural decision-making
[7:24] but it's a wisdom that's rooted in
[7:27] spiritual wisdom
[7:28] and and we touched on this by
[7:30] identifying how that you have to be
[7:32] born again uh from above and you the
[7:34] double-minded man is one who doesn't
[7:36] have that mind of christ through the new
[7:38] birth
[7:38] to find that stability and that root or
[7:40] that anchor and so when he talks about a
[7:42] wise man and dude with knowledge it's
[7:44] not just somebody
[7:45] who's moral or has a particular
[7:47] expertise with respect to natural things
[7:49] but it's a wisdom that's rooted in the
[7:51] word it's a wisdom that can come back to
[7:53] the word of god and be in harmony with
[7:55] the word
[7:56] and so this phrase is used a few times
[7:58] in
[7:59] the old testament where you have wise
[8:01] and understanding used together
[8:03] and i want to refer to them and start
[8:05] with deuteronomy chapter 4
[8:07] verses 5 and 6. moses is saying behold
[8:10] i've taught you
[8:11] statutes and judgments even as the lord
[8:14] my god commanded me
[8:15] so we know that god spoke to moses then
[8:18] moses taught the people and many times
[8:20] the word says and the lord said unto
[8:22] moses and god says
[8:24] speak ye unto the people and tell them
[8:26] this so the statutes and judgments that
[8:28] moses shared with the children of israel
[8:31] they were the lord's commandments and
[8:33] and he says that ye should do so in the
[8:35] land whether you go to possess it
[8:37] keep therefore and do them so the word
[8:40] of god as
[8:41] given by the prophet moses to the people
[8:44] is
[8:44] what they are to keep and to observe and
[8:46] he says for this is your wisdom and your
[8:48] understanding
[8:50] in the sight of the nations so the
[8:52] wisdom of the people was their ability
[8:54] to hear the word of god and to do the
[8:55] word of god
[8:56] so the wise man and endued with
[8:59] knowledge
[8:59] we don't think in terms of who seems to
[9:02] be moral and has even natural integrity
[9:04] but this is something that relates to
[9:06] the word of god
[9:07] and aligns with the character and nature
[9:09] of the word not just some
[9:11] a moral principle or a natural skill or
[9:13] ability
[9:14] so the lord gives the commandments keep
[9:16] them therefore and do them
[9:17] for this is your wisdom and your
[9:19] understanding in the sight of the
[9:20] nations
[9:21] which shall hear all these statutes and
[9:23] say surely this great nation is a wise
[9:26] and
[9:26] understanding people now we might
[9:28] wrestle with that and trying to figure
[9:30] out how that
[9:30] israel could keep the law perfectly and
[9:32] all the outsiders and all the heathens
[9:34] and all the gentiles would say
[9:35] wow these people are wise and full of
[9:37] understanding
[9:38] and because israel failed to keep it
[9:40] perfectly we'll never know
[9:42] but it suggests that if they had done
[9:44] that if they had taken the word of god
[9:46] kept heard them kept them and did them
[9:49] then that would have been their
[9:50] wisdom and their understanding and this
[9:51] they would look at this great nation and
[9:53] said
[9:54] that they are wise and an understanding
[9:56] people
[9:57] and so james is hearkening back to this
[9:59] concept when he says who's a wise man
[10:01] endued with knowledge among you they
[10:03] have the wisdom and understanding
[10:05] who is this person and isaiah chapter 5
[10:09] verses 20 and 21
[10:11] it says woe unto them that call evil
[10:13] good and good evil put darkness for
[10:16] light and light for darkness that put
[10:17] bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter
[10:20] easily summarizes they lack discernment
[10:23] they don't know what's good they don't
[10:24] know what's bad because they call
[10:25] good evil they call evil good they call
[10:28] darkness light
[10:29] light darkness and then the sweet they
[10:31] call it bitter they last that they lack
[10:33] that distinction
[10:34] in their perception and their taste and
[10:36] their understanding and so it's woe to
[10:38] that person
[10:39] and then this phrase again is you though
[10:41] it's different words in our english
[10:42] translation it says woe unto them that
[10:44] are
[10:45] wise in their own eyes imprudent in
[10:47] their own sight
[10:49] and so this is wisdom unders and
[10:51] understanding but yet it's in the carnal
[10:53] sense
[10:53] where one is wise in their own eyes well
[10:56] i'm wise i can figure this out i can
[10:57] make my way through this or
[10:58] prudent understanding i have knowledge
[11:01] and i have all the things that i need
[11:03] it very well could characterize laodicea
[11:05] that says we're wise
[11:06] we have a lot of skill we we can plan we
[11:08] can plan a lot of things and we know the
[11:10] best way to execute them
[11:11] and we've learned a lot we've we've
[11:13] gathered knowledge we've accumulated
[11:14] data through
[11:15] thousands of years and through the
[11:16] centuries but that the bible is saying
[11:19] that this kind of wisdom
[11:20] and this kind of prudence is a detriment
[11:22] because they lack the spiritual
[11:24] discernment to recognize evil and to
[11:25] recognize good
[11:27] spiritual discernment to say that's
[11:28] sweet that's bitter this is light and
[11:30] that's darkness
[11:31] so james says who is a wise man endued
[11:34] with knowledge among you
[11:35] this is a wisdom and a knowledge that's
[11:37] related to the word of god it's rooted
[11:39] in the commandments of the lord
[11:41] and james is specifically dealing with
[11:44] those who place themselves as teachers
[11:46] and i just felt very directed to share
[11:48] this part although i know i'm not
[11:51] speaking to a group of people that claim
[11:52] to be leaders and teachers
[11:54] in the in the word of god and we're all
[11:56] trying to be um
[11:57] uh prophets and we're all trying to
[11:59] pastor but it speaks to those who place
[12:01] themselves as teachers and leaders
[12:04] and i will in a moment come down to how
[12:06] that's applicable to all of us in some
[12:07] way
[12:09] but he's identifying that true
[12:10] leadership requires more than just a
[12:12] profession
[12:13] that i'm a leader and more than just
[12:15] assuming the position well i have this
[12:17] position so you need to listen to me or
[12:19] i i am this so you should hear me james
[12:22] is identifying who is a wise man and
[12:25] dude with knowledge who's going to be a
[12:26] master who's going to be a teacher
[12:28] well it's going to have to be one who's
[12:29] wide and wise and endued with knowledge
[12:31] and he's wanting to amplify what the
[12:34] nature and characteristic would be of
[12:35] somebody that you should listen to
[12:38] this is very important just to kind of
[12:40] catch here because in deuteronomy
[12:41] chapter 1 verse 13
[12:43] this is another instance where wise and
[12:45] understanding is used together
[12:47] and as akin to this phrase of who's a
[12:49] wise man and endued with knowledge among
[12:51] you
[12:52] god is this is the wisdom spoken to
[12:54] moses take you wise men
[12:57] and understanding known among your
[12:59] tribes and i will make them rulers over
[13:02] you here's god's wisdom to moses
[13:04] take a wise take wise men and
[13:06] understanding men who are wise
[13:08] and endued with knowledge that have
[13:10] discernment known among your tribes so
[13:12] they are known they have their known
[13:13] commodity you know their works you know
[13:15] their family you know where they belong
[13:17] and i will make them rulers over you
[13:20] so this quality for ruler that god
[13:22] identified was that they were wise and
[13:24] understanding
[13:25] a ruler speaks of a leader speaks of a
[13:27] guide it's someone that's going to be
[13:29] looked to as an authority even the word
[13:31] is used as a head
[13:33] and so a head properly has to have
[13:35] wisdom and understanding
[13:37] not the profession that they are ahead
[13:39] and not the assumption of the position
[13:42] it's a lot of people that can be in
[13:43] positions of leadership or headship but
[13:45] lack
[13:46] the wisdom that the bible's speaking of
[13:48] and don't have the knowledge that the
[13:49] bible is speaking of
[13:50] and we ought to have the discernment of
[13:53] whether or not they they lack it
[13:55] right we should have the discernment
[13:57] that just because someone has the name
[13:58] on their badge or somebody claims it or
[14:00] professes it
[14:01] we have the kind of discernment to
[14:02] recognize that someone in this position
[14:04] and even we could challenge ourselves as
[14:06] we'll come to in a moment
[14:07] if i'm going to be accepting of or i've
[14:09] entered into some role of responsibility
[14:11] and leadership
[14:12] then i need to be endued with knowledge
[14:14] and have wisdom
[14:16] to execute that so both these qualities
[14:18] are required if one desires
[14:20] or claims to be a teacher or to be a
[14:23] head because james is dealing
[14:24] specifically
[14:25] with those who are a master or a teacher
[14:28] and
[14:28] in hebrews chapter 5 verses 10 to 14
[14:33] or 12 to 14 i believe is maybe where
[14:35] we'll take it
[14:37] it speaks directly to this um
[14:40] concept of we ourselves also being
[14:43] teachers
[14:44] let me just make sure i have the um the
[14:46] right reference here
[14:48] verse starting with verse 12 hebrews
[14:51] chapter 5 verses 12
[14:53] to 14 it says for when the time ye ought
[14:56] to be teachers
[14:57] so now he speaks that in some way we as
[15:00] believers mature to a place where we
[15:02] have
[15:02] the ability to communicate truth and to
[15:05] express it
[15:06] he says for when you ought to be
[15:07] teachers when the time has come that you
[15:09] ought to be teachers
[15:10] you have need that one teach you again
[15:12] which be the first principles of the
[15:14] oracles of god
[15:15] and to become such as have need of milk
[15:17] and not of strong meat
[15:18] for everyone that useth milk is
[15:20] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[15:22] for he is a babe so though james is
[15:25] dealing with
[15:26] the principle of who's a teacher among
[15:28] you who's going to be a leader who's
[15:29] going to have a position
[15:30] among you in the body of christ or who's
[15:32] going to be one that would teach you
[15:34] the principles of the word of god he's
[15:36] saying that type of person
[15:37] ought to be one who's endued with wisdom
[15:40] endued with knowledge and has wisdom
[15:43] identifying this very particularly that
[15:46] we ought to
[15:46] recognize that in those who set them for
[15:49] set themselves forth as teachers
[15:51] who is the wise man and endued with
[15:53] knowledge among you and then he begins
[15:54] to say
[15:55] this is how you must these are things
[15:57] that you must recognize
[15:58] that relates to wisdom and being endued
[16:00] with knowledge
[16:02] but lest we all just kind of sit back
[16:04] and say okay tonight we're going to be
[16:05] instructed
[16:06] how to judge ministry or how to judge
[16:08] those that claim to be ministers or
[16:10] pastors or teachers
[16:12] let's make it all applicable to
[16:13] ourselves because if we could start with
[16:16] ourselves
[16:16] then we'll be better qualified to judge
[16:18] even others
[16:20] because there is there's a there's a
[16:21] line there where we're not to judge but
[16:23] then there's a line where we must judge
[16:25] we want to be sure that we're always on
[16:26] the right side of the word when it comes
[16:28] to distinctions and discernment and
[16:29] judgment
[16:30] and since paul is expressing that we
[16:33] through the maturing of the word of god
[16:35] could come to a place of judgment and
[16:37] understanding
[16:38] to be teachers ourselves then the
[16:40] principles that james expresses
[16:42] about judging one who sets themselves
[16:44] forth as a master
[16:46] we can also apply it to us these
[16:48] principles are
[16:49] applicable to all of us who desire
[16:52] wisdom if we're going to ask god for
[16:53] wisdom and he'll give it liberally
[16:55] then this is something that we can
[16:56] practically judge ourselves by
[16:58] to determine whether or not the wisdom
[17:00] of god is operating in our hearts
[17:02] so it's applicable to all of us but also
[17:05] with respect to leadership
[17:07] and i want to i hope that you can make
[17:09] this very personal to yourselves and to
[17:11] your situation
[17:12] it's going to be very very simple and
[17:14] direct very specific tonight
[17:16] so he says uh who is a wise man and
[17:19] endued with knowledge among you this is
[17:21] james 3 13 and let him show out of a
[17:23] good conversation
[17:24] his works with meekness of wisdom let
[17:27] him
[17:27] show so if wisdom and knowledge are not
[17:30] shown then they're dead just like faith
[17:33] which is not working is dead
[17:35] if someone is says that they have wisdom
[17:37] if someone says they're a wise man and a
[17:39] dude with knowledge and james is
[17:40] actually saying
[17:41] if there is a wise man among you who's
[17:43] endued with knowledge
[17:44] then let him show so wisdom and
[17:47] knowledge are to be shown
[17:48] just like our faith is to be expressed
[17:50] through works wisdom and knowledge are
[17:51] to be shown
[17:53] john wesley took this verse and said it
[17:54] this way let him show his wisdom as well
[17:57] as his faith
[17:58] by his works not by words only
[18:01] the beautiful way to summarize it let
[18:02] him show his wisdom as well as his faith
[18:05] by his works not by words only well i'm
[18:07] a wise man
[18:08] and i believe and i'm a believer and i
[18:10] am wise and i have this
[18:11] and i have that and i give good counsel
[18:13] and i'm this and i'm that
[18:14] instead of one just claiming it how
[18:16] about having it how about living it how
[18:18] about giving it so we say let it be by
[18:20] their actions
[18:21] not just by their words only so let him
[18:24] who the wise man and dude with knowledge
[18:26] let him
[18:26] show out of a good conversation
[18:29] now he uses the phrase out of a good
[18:32] conversation not to refer to
[18:34] you know an instance where you one
[18:36] person communicates one per thing and
[18:37] the other person communicates back this
[18:39] isn't a text message or
[18:40] a dm this is a a good conversation
[18:42] literally means
[18:43] not a single act or occurrence but a
[18:46] life
[18:47] so to do it out of a good conversation
[18:49] it's not a single act but it's a course
[18:51] of living
[18:52] it is a way of life it's a manner of
[18:55] life we could say a good conversation
[18:57] well we have that sometimes with each
[18:58] other wow did you talk to so and so yeah
[19:00] how did it go it was a good conversation
[19:02] but the phrase that's being used here
[19:04] would talk about a way of life is lived
[19:06] not just one moment not just instance
[19:08] one instance where they say
[19:10] you know even a a broken clock is right
[19:12] twice a day
[19:14] and so you don't you don't want to be
[19:16] the broken clock that's
[19:17] you know you're right every once why i
[19:19] guess there's another phrase that even a
[19:20] blind squirrel finds a nut every once in
[19:22] a while too
[19:23] we want to be those that aren't just oh
[19:26] stumbling on happiness and stumbling on
[19:28] success and accidentally getting it
[19:30] right and
[19:30] all of our normal accidents adding up to
[19:32] something good but this is somebody
[19:34] you look at the whole character of their
[19:36] life and you say that this
[19:38] is a life that's lived well
[19:41] it is a how do they let them show out of
[19:43] a a life that is
[19:45] upright let them show out of a life that
[19:46] is worthy of the gospel
[19:48] we're challenged with the question is
[19:50] your life worthy of the gospel
[19:52] so it's a life that's righteous it's
[19:54] upright worthy of the gospel it's one
[19:55] that is influenced by the grace of god
[19:59] this is exactly what james is
[20:00] challenging us with we can challenge
[20:02] ourselves this is what we
[20:04] we're looking for in our own lives if we
[20:05] have asked god for wisdom and he's
[20:07] granted it liberally
[20:09] then what we want to see is not just a
[20:12] moment where we got it right but see a
[20:14] life that's
[20:14] changing and one that's influenced by
[20:16] the grace of god
[20:18] it's a life that's characterized by
[20:20] mercy it's a life that's
[20:22] characterized by goodness even jesus
[20:25] when he says in matthew chapter 5 verse
[20:27] 16 let your light so
[20:28] shine before men that men might see your
[20:30] good works and glorify your father which
[20:32] is in heaven this is what james is
[20:34] referring to
[20:35] let him show out of a good conversation
[20:37] his works
[20:39] let him show a life that's lived let him
[20:41] show
[20:42] letting his light shine that when others
[20:44] see that light they're seeing the
[20:45] goodness of god
[20:47] it's what god was setting forth when he
[20:49] told the children of israel
[20:51] that if you will keep my statutes and my
[20:53] commandments and do them then your
[20:54] wisdom and your understanding
[20:56] will be in the sight of the nations that
[20:58] they'll see it and they'll marvel and
[20:59] say this is a wise and understanding
[21:01] people
[21:02] if you hear the word and do it if you
[21:03] act upon it you're showing
[21:05] a out of a good conversation works
[21:09] a shining light and so it says let him
[21:12] show out of a good conversation his
[21:14] works
[21:15] with meekness of wisdom
[21:18] this phrase just to me keeps abounding
[21:22] and abounding and abounding even more
[21:23] and more
[21:25] to where it's almost as if you can
[21:27] repeat a phrase over and over and again
[21:29] and it
[21:30] loses its distinction and the words just
[21:31] in syllables begin to run together
[21:33] the more i look at this the more i look
[21:35] at it the more that it's
[21:37] it seems to me as something more
[21:39] distinct and more profound as if i had
[21:40] never even heard it before
[21:42] the meekness of wisdom it's declaring
[21:46] right off the bat
[21:47] that true wisdom is associated with
[21:49] meekness
[21:50] that it cannot be separated from it it's
[21:52] a gentleness of life it's a wisdom with
[21:54] humility
[21:56] brother branham when he's talking in how
[21:57] can i overcome and he's teaching us how
[22:00] that jesus overcame
[22:02] and he's wanting us to understand that
[22:03] the manner in which christ overcame
[22:05] is the same manner in which we overcome
[22:07] that jesus
[22:09] did not overcome base based upon a blood
[22:11] test to say well hey
[22:12] look take my blood and you'll find that
[22:14] my dna can't be traced to anybody here
[22:16] on earth i'm a different kind of
[22:18] specimen i'm a different kind of species
[22:20] and though the blood that ran through
[22:21] his veins was deity
[22:23] and though he could be able to testify
[22:25] that he had not bypassed
[22:27] his theophany and he knew where he came
[22:30] from and that the father dwelt perfectly
[22:32] in him
[22:32] he didn't overcome by dynamics that we
[22:35] don't possess
[22:36] today he overcame by the word and
[22:38] humility
[22:40] and so it took an elect son of god a
[22:43] predestinated son of god the very
[22:45] manifestation of the son of man
[22:46] and he places his ability to overcome
[22:49] not in the wisdom of the world
[22:50] but the wisdom which is from above that
[22:52] he could overcome by
[22:54] the word and humility wasn't in the way
[22:57] that he could rub his hands together and
[22:59] hold him together just right
[23:00] at just the right moment to cause
[23:02] something to transpire something to
[23:03] happen
[23:04] but he went by the word and by humility
[23:06] brother graham says overcome how by
[23:08] taking the word
[23:09] the promise in humility humbly walking
[23:13] so the meekness of wisdom wisdom is the
[23:16] word in action the meekness of wisdom
[23:18] then is the humility
[23:19] that's joined with it to make it
[23:21] effective
[23:23] the gentleness which let him show forth
[23:25] out of a good
[23:26] out of a good conversation his works
[23:28] with the meekness of wisdom it's a
[23:30] certain
[23:30] wisdom of humility a gentleness of life
[23:34] now i'm going to use two more verses or
[23:37] i believe just two more verses here in
[23:38] james maybe three more verses as he
[23:40] expounds upon this
[23:42] and and i'm not going to amplify the
[23:44] part where he says the wisdom which is
[23:46] from above but you can go and read those
[23:47] things later as we've already read them
[23:49] tonight
[23:50] and see that he's using phrases to
[23:52] expound more on this
[23:54] meekness of wisdom and what it looks
[23:56] like and how it acts
[23:58] but what he begins to express and when
[24:00] he calls says that the meekness of
[24:01] wisdom
[24:03] he let me say what wisdom does not look
[24:05] like or what is not wisdom
[24:07] wisdom does not look noisy
[24:10] wisdom does not look arrogant it's
[24:13] important for us to ponder this
[24:14] because it's he's wanting us to identify
[24:17] who is the wise man and endued with
[24:19] knowledge among you wisdom is
[24:21] the me he speaks the meekness of wisdom
[24:22] it is not boy
[24:24] boisterous it's not boastful wisdom is
[24:27] not self-justifying
[24:30] wisdom is not egotistical or egocentric
[24:32] it's not centered upon self
[24:33] wisdom is not expressed to lift the one
[24:36] who expresses it up
[24:39] when wisdom expresses itself then truth
[24:41] is it lifted up
[24:43] when true wisdom from above is expressed
[24:45] then god has lift up not the individual
[24:46] that's imparting it
[24:47] if one can actually express true wisdom
[24:50] in the meekness of wisdom
[24:51] then one doesn't walk away saying man
[24:53] that brother is smart
[24:56] they walk away feeling as if they've
[24:57] heard from god they walk away feeling as
[24:59] if the lord has opened up something to
[25:01] them not the
[25:02] not the sharpness and the shrewdness of
[25:04] the man and so it's a
[25:05] now we can make the mistake sometimes by
[25:07] attributing certain things to the
[25:09] the manner in which something is
[25:10] delivered or the way that someone
[25:11] structures something
[25:12] but when we really want to get it and it
[25:14] be useful to our lives we need to
[25:16] recognize that that wisdom is from above
[25:17] and not through the man
[25:20] and so he he's showing us that wisdom is
[25:23] not
[25:23] noisy it's not arrogant it's not a boy
[25:26] boastful
[25:28] and it is so it doesn't lift itself up
[25:30] it's not self-justifying
[25:32] and it's not selfish wisdom is not
[25:35] expressed to take advantage of somebody
[25:38] true wisdom is not going to be used in a
[25:40] way wisdom which is from
[25:42] above wisdom that is that is spiritual
[25:44] wisdom
[25:45] who is a wise man and endued with
[25:47] knowledge let him show forth out of a
[25:48] good conversation his works with the
[25:50] meekness of wisdom and others wisdom is
[25:52] it looking to take advantage of somebody
[25:54] else
[25:55] wisdom is not selfish therefore we can
[25:57] understand that true wisdom is not
[25:58] abusive
[26:00] truism is not controlling truism is not
[26:03] manipulative
[26:04] truism it does not intend to bring shame
[26:07] and to shame you
[26:08] and to make you feel awful to make you
[26:10] feel embarrassed true wisdom does not
[26:11] want to motivate you by fear
[26:14] i feel like saying come on somebody
[26:18] because it's true this is this is what
[26:20] the bible is trying to express to us
[26:23] now this is good on two parts number one
[26:25] let's all challenge ourselves that when
[26:27] we have truth on our sides
[26:29] let's not resort to force or any form of
[26:32] manipulation or control to get someone
[26:34] to accept truth
[26:35] if you have truth on your side you've
[26:36] got all you need
[26:39] you just ask god to give you wisdom to
[26:40] impart it to stay true to it and to
[26:42] express it in righteousness
[26:44] and then also so it gives us we can
[26:46] challenge ourselves that if i know that
[26:48] this is wisdom if i know this is from
[26:49] above then i should be able to conduct
[26:51] myself in a certain way i should have
[26:52] confidence with this truth
[26:54] that i'm trying to apply to my children
[26:55] or in this relationship or in this
[26:57] particular situation on my job and then
[26:59] also begin to recognize when one is
[27:01] supposing to be wise
[27:04] someone is trying to assert themselves
[27:06] as your head or as your teacher as your
[27:08] guide or one is wanting to give you
[27:10] counsel
[27:10] but you notice that at the end of the
[27:11] day what they're really trying to do
[27:13] is put you under their thumb
[27:17] and recognize they say wait a minute if
[27:19] i do exactly what they tell me to do
[27:21] it benefits them but where's the benefit
[27:23] for me and my family
[27:25] where's the benefit for me as an
[27:26] individual where is the glory to god
[27:28] where's the
[27:29] where's christ going to get the glory in
[27:30] this situation so it's very very
[27:33] practical for us to recognize
[27:35] that wisdom is not arrogant it's not
[27:37] abusive it's not controlling it's not
[27:39] self-justifying it's not selfish
[27:42] but true wisdom is always meek
[27:45] it's gentle it's calm
[27:48] it's it's something that is actually
[27:50] mild but firm and steady
[27:54] true wisdom does not need to raise the
[27:57] volume to get its point across
[28:00] truism is satisfied in being wisdom it
[28:02] does not need to
[28:03] uh it does not need to exaggerate
[28:07] it does not need to go to extremes it
[28:09] does not need to change the back story
[28:10] it doesn't need to change the context
[28:12] wisdom is something
[28:13] that is just firm and steady and being
[28:15] firm and steady it rests very strongly
[28:18] but quietly it's not snoring
[28:22] it just sets there very silently resting
[28:25] and i pondered this
[28:26] that may have been last week or earlier
[28:27] this week how
[28:29] whenever there's a ruckus and i know we
[28:31] all we all gotten ruckuses when we were
[28:33] in the world
[28:34] and there was a bruja hog going and
[28:35] people were sticking their chest out and
[28:37] people were kicking off their shoes and
[28:38] taking off their shirts come on
[28:40] come on bring it you want something pull
[28:42] over it's always the guy over there not
[28:44] wanting is not saying anything
[28:46] real quiet the guy said no i don't want
[28:48] any trouble no
[28:49] hey man i'm sorry that's the guy you
[28:51] want to back off and say you know what
[28:53] he could probably whip me really really
[28:54] good
[28:55] because he's not having to blow up get
[28:56] all loud and get all arrogant puff up
[28:58] and start fighting
[28:59] and using a lot of a big talk because he
[29:02] knows where he stands
[29:03] he's like i know i can take everybody in
[29:05] this room but it's not worth it
[29:07] and so they're usually the most quiet
[29:08] that wasn't me talking that was me
[29:10] as if somebody else was up here you know
[29:13] somebody spends a lot of time in the
[29:14] dojo not me
[29:16] and so that somebody could say no i know
[29:19] where i stand i know i can defend myself
[29:21] i know if i wanted to
[29:22] i could i could um god's physical harm
[29:24] and so they're the ones that are very
[29:26] quiet the ones very cool like hey man no
[29:27] i got no beef i'm sorry
[29:29] that's all right and they'll take all
[29:30] sorts of abuse and verbal abuse and even
[29:32] picking on and small little touches and
[29:34] things like that
[29:35] because they don't need they don't have
[29:36] to prove anything
[29:38] it rest wisdom rests very strongly
[29:42] but something that's arrogant and loud
[29:44] this kind of stormy
[29:45] competitious demeanor
[29:49] it does not indicate trustworthy counsel
[29:55] this is how we can challenge ourselves
[29:57] whether or not we're really convinced
[29:58] about what we're saying
[30:00] if we can rest quietly in the wisdom
[30:01] that we have or do we have to get more
[30:03] forceful or more loud or more
[30:04] manipulative with it but then we could
[30:06] also use it to discern whether or not
[30:07] there's some kind of false wisdom that's
[30:08] trying to bombard us
[30:10] it's something that is arrogant and loud
[30:12] does not indicate
[30:13] safe counsel this is a warning sign as
[30:16] james is lifting it up because true
[30:17] wisdom is quiet
[30:20] and something that wants to grit its
[30:21] teeth and intimidate you and cause fear
[30:23] that's something that's not safe counsel
[30:26] but the wisdom of the the word shows in
[30:29] all actions
[30:31] a life that exhibits rest and peace and
[30:35] so when we read that it says that let
[30:37] him show out of a good conversation his
[30:39] works with the meekness of wisdom
[30:41] it means true wisdom is always
[30:43] accompanied with meekness
[30:46] and meekness has such deep meaning it
[30:48] even speaks about the government of
[30:49] passions one's ability to govern their
[30:51] passions it speaks to
[30:53] ruling your own emotions not that you
[30:55] don't have them but meekness is the
[30:56] ability to bring them subject meekness
[30:58] is the ability
[30:59] to govern passions and to restrain them
[31:01] and restrain emotions
[31:03] and make emotions subject to the word of
[31:05] god
[31:06] as believers do we sorrow yes we sorrow
[31:09] but not as the world sorrows
[31:11] as believers we can feel we can feel
[31:14] certain emotions but we realize we don't
[31:16] go to the extreme that the world does we
[31:18] bring them subject to the word of god
[31:19] our headship is in the word of god
[31:21] so meekness is the ability to restrain
[31:23] emotions and govern passions
[31:26] james chapter three if you if you look
[31:28] at the heading in your bible and mine it
[31:29] speaks james chapter three is called the
[31:31] unruly tongue
[31:33] and the subject of chapter 3 is
[31:35] controlling of the tongue it's talking
[31:36] about temperance
[31:38] and it's talking about how that you know
[31:39] he who is able to control his tongue
[31:41] this is a perfect man
[31:44] and the man who can't control his tongue
[31:45] a man who's always spouting off a man
[31:47] who's always
[31:48] intemperate and and angry and spiteful
[31:50] and saying things that
[31:52] uh that are harmful or abusive just
[31:54] however you really want to say it he's
[31:55] talking about a mouth and a tongue being
[31:56] full of deadly poison
[31:57] he says anyone who can control that that
[32:00] is a man
[32:01] who is wise
[32:04] this is a man who gives good counsel
[32:06] such as a perfect man
[32:08] so meekness is inseparable from true
[32:10] wisdom
[32:12] and in verse 13 who is a wise man and a
[32:14] dude with knowledge among you
[32:16] let him show out of a good conversation
[32:18] his works with the meekness of wisdom
[32:20] verse 13 is talking about how wisdom
[32:22] acts
[32:24] that wisdom is something that has a
[32:26] particular
[32:27] way that it acts you'll know wisdom by
[32:30] how things get done
[32:33] you'll know wisdom by how it motivates
[32:35] people
[32:36] you know wisdom by how objectives are
[32:38] accomplished
[32:40] there's a way that the world can try to
[32:41] get things done i had a baseball coach
[32:43] in high school
[32:44] and he motivated by fear and you felt it
[32:47] you felt it in every practice you felt
[32:49] it in the off season you felt it in the
[32:50] games you felt that if you were on jv
[32:52] and he's the varsity coach
[32:53] you always just had this coach who was
[32:55] ready to chew you out in the back of
[32:57] your mind and he believed that fear was
[32:58] a great motivator and it worked with
[33:00] respect to baseball because he was an
[33:01] awesome coach
[33:02] but god doesn't motivate that way god
[33:05] has never been a motivator by fear he
[33:07] motivates by faith
[33:08] and so you know true wisdom by how it
[33:10] works within your heart does it provoke
[33:12] fear do you have the fear of missing out
[33:14] do you feel like well if i do that i'm
[33:16] going to lose this i'm going to lose
[33:17] that this is going to happen that's
[33:18] going to happen i'm going to
[33:19] just all sorts of things that rest in
[33:20] people's head that if that's the wisdom
[33:22] you're digesting you ought to be able to
[33:24] have the discernment to say this doesn't
[33:25] taste right
[33:27] this isn't bringing peaceable fruit this
[33:29] isn't this isn't from above the way that
[33:31] we're approaching the situation the way
[33:32] that we're wanting to see god come on
[33:33] the scene for us
[33:34] this is not going to bring forth a
[33:37] peaceable peaceable fruit
[33:38] because it's not wisdom from above
[33:40] because you're looking at how it gets
[33:42] things done
[33:43] and how objectives are accomplished
[33:47] the meekness of wisdom it means wisdom
[33:48] is meek
[33:50] and as we'll see in the preceding verses
[33:51] that wisdom does not dispute
[33:53] it does not fight it does not quarrel it
[33:55] does not wrestle
[33:57] but it rests in truth if it's wisdom
[34:00] from above
[34:01] then it's settling it's resting
[34:04] as a way of just covering something and
[34:07] a person could just give into it and
[34:08] yield to it
[34:09] but if it's this wisdom that we're going
[34:11] to read a moment that comes from beneath
[34:12] it's fighting for preeminence it's
[34:13] fighting to get above it's fighting to
[34:15] assert itself and
[34:17] and to come to the top and show that
[34:18] it's really the strong one or the good
[34:20] one
[34:20] but the wisdom is meek it doesn't fight
[34:22] it doesn't quarrel it doesn't wrestle
[34:24] it's just resting in truth and the old
[34:27] testament if we took time to
[34:29] examine many different scriptures we'd
[34:30] find that the meek as it's used in the
[34:32] old testament they're characterized
[34:35] those that were meek were characterized
[34:36] as relying upon god to defend them
[34:38] against any injustice
[34:41] the meek were people who didn't have to
[34:42] rail they didn't have to fight back they
[34:44] didn't have to throw back accusations
[34:46] if they were treated wrong if they were
[34:47] abused if things were not going their
[34:49] way they had they just said well you
[34:50] know what
[34:51] god's my defender the lord fights my
[34:53] battles
[34:54] and and that's who you characterized as
[34:56] the meek they were the ones that knew
[34:59] they were the ones in my example earlier
[35:00] that knew that they had a power on their
[35:03] side an ability on their side that could
[35:04] defeat everyone else in the brawl
[35:07] but didn't need to engage because the
[35:08] battle wasn't theirs
[35:10] they were trusted in something higher so
[35:13] they did not need to resort to their own
[35:15] devices they did not need to
[35:17] use their own abilities or their own
[35:19] schemes their own revenge
[35:20] however you want to place that to
[35:22] respond to a hurt or to respond to an
[35:23] offense
[35:25] because wisdom knows that god permits
[35:27] difficulties
[35:29] wisdom knows that god uses them to
[35:31] perfect us
[35:32] and wisdom knows that god delivers us
[35:34] out of them all
[35:36] so this is the wisdom that's from above
[35:37] wisdom knows that when you're in a
[35:39] difficult situation
[35:40] then you know that god god permits these
[35:43] and when you can accept that god permits
[35:45] certain things and you can
[35:47] recognize that if it's happening to you
[35:49] then it's permitted
[35:51] it changes a lot in the way that we
[35:52] react one of my biggest
[35:55] shames has been over the last several
[35:56] years is how
[35:58] little i truly have accepted the truth
[36:02] that how do we how do we prove our love
[36:04] to him
[36:05] by conducting ourselves with joy admits
[36:08] the trials that he and his wisdom allow
[36:10] us to come to pass
[36:12] and in my actions not not necessarily
[36:15] how i would have
[36:16] articulated it but in my actions and my
[36:18] response
[36:19] it's as if i took that statement to mean
[36:21] that there's some that he permits and
[36:23] allows but there's others that he
[36:25] doesn't
[36:27] but realize this as a son or daughter of
[36:29] god every trial you go through
[36:31] he has permitted in his wisdom
[36:34] so that no matter what you go through
[36:36] you just say lord you have in your
[36:38] wisdom allowed this to come to pass
[36:40] so this is god's wisdom active in my
[36:42] life he's trying to teach me something
[36:43] there's something i need to learn from
[36:44] this
[36:45] and so at the end of the day i'm going
[36:46] to conduct myself with joy
[36:48] admits the worst thing that's ever
[36:50] happened to me before
[36:51] because i know that god permitted this
[36:54] in his wisdom
[36:56] and not engage as we often do well i'm
[36:58] just trying to figure out whether or not
[37:00] this is god's wisdom or not
[37:02] and that's what we wrestle with many
[37:03] times at the end of the day we're like
[37:04] man i just
[37:05] is this god is this the devil is this
[37:07] the lord or is this the devil
[37:09] and what we need to realize is hey if
[37:10] it's god or if it's the devil he's
[37:11] permitted it
[37:14] and begin to rest in his work because
[37:16] god will permit it
[37:18] god will use it god will deliver us in
[37:20] his time
[37:22] so meekness in the scripture is a
[37:24] mildness of disposition
[37:27] to be meek it speaks of a gentleness of
[37:29] spirit
[37:30] so there's a very very clear and
[37:32] specific character
[37:34] characteristics of wisdom that james
[37:36] james wants us to catch
[37:37] we think of wisdom as being a solomon on
[37:39] the throne arrayed in his glory
[37:41] but wisdom doesn't always look that way
[37:44] wisdom is a of a gentle spirit it's the
[37:47] opposite of being self-assertive
[37:49] it's the opposite of self-interest
[37:52] and the in the ability to not be
[37:54] self-asserted to put yourself forward
[37:56] the ability
[37:57] to not try to serve your own interest
[37:59] stems from the rest that one is putting
[38:01] in god
[38:01] and the confidence that one place is in
[38:03] the lord i know he'll take care of me
[38:06] so i don't have to scheme i know he's
[38:08] watching out over the church
[38:10] so i don't have to try to protect it in
[38:11] my own carnality
[38:13] i know that he's going to advance his
[38:15] interests so i don't have to try to
[38:16] protect my own
[38:17] it's a yielding to god
[38:20] those that don't trust in the lord have
[38:22] to assert themselves
[38:24] to to make a way for them to
[38:27] to they have to make their own way
[38:31] that to put themselves forward because
[38:33] we're taught the gift makes way for
[38:35] itself
[38:36] you can always tell when someone's not
[38:37] quite sure about what god has done for
[38:39] them and the gift that they have because
[38:40] they're always trying to justify they're
[38:42] always trying to vindicate it they're
[38:43] always trying to make a way for it
[38:45] but the meek are not occupied with
[38:47] themselves
[38:49] they have no sense of self-entitlement
[38:52] they're yielding to god they're trusting
[38:53] to him
[38:55] they're not trusted in their own ability
[38:58] they're not self-sufficient
[39:01] that's what meekness is they're not
[39:02] self-sufficient as they they enlail to
[39:04] see if they were rich we're increased
[39:05] with goods and have need of nothing this
[39:07] is the very opposite of meekness
[39:09] look what i can do look who i am look
[39:12] what i've accomplished he's actually
[39:13] those that are meek are saying you know
[39:15] what if it had my name on it it was god
[39:17] that did it anyway so
[39:18] i'm not really going to stick my head up
[39:20] and brag about it because i know at the
[39:22] end of the day they can't take credit
[39:23] for it
[39:25] so the meek are not so occupied with
[39:27] themselves
[39:28] because they have no they've shed this
[39:30] sense of entitlement
[39:33] let's amplify that by reading verse 14
[39:36] then james chapter 3
[39:37] and we'll read to verse 16 verses 14 to
[39:40] 16.
[39:43] who is a wise man an endued with
[39:45] knowledge let him show forth out of a
[39:47] good conversation his works with the
[39:49] meekness of wisdom but now he's saying
[39:51] this is what we should see the meekness
[39:53] of wisdom and this so this
[39:54] is contrasting and amplifying what it
[39:56] means by the meekness of wisdom
[39:58] but if ye have bitter envy and strife in
[40:00] your hearts glory not and
[40:02] lie not against the truth this wisdom
[40:04] descendeth not from above but is earthly
[40:07] sensual devilish for where envying and
[40:10] strife
[40:11] is and and by using that singular verb
[40:14] is really joining them together
[40:15] where envy and strife is there is
[40:17] confusion
[40:19] in every evil work
[40:22] so james is contrasting true wisdom
[40:25] from a false wisdom he calls it sin
[40:27] earthly sensual devilish so that kind of
[40:30] wisdom
[40:30] is different from the meekness of wisdom
[40:32] the true spiritual wisdom
[40:34] so before even before he amplifies the
[40:36] meekness of wisdom from above in the
[40:38] preceding verses after verse 16
[40:41] he's defining the wisdom from below
[40:45] he's wanting us to be able to recognize
[40:46] the kind of wisdom that originates in
[40:48] the flesh the kind of wisdom that's
[40:49] earthly and sensual and devilish
[40:51] and he characterizes it by bitter envy
[40:53] and which is jealousy
[40:55] and bitter strife which is selfish
[40:57] ambition politicking
[40:59] party making wisdom which is from
[41:02] beneath wisdom which is from below is
[41:03] jealous it lacks gentleness
[41:06] it strives it creates conflict and
[41:09] positions and
[41:10] and polarization he's just being very
[41:12] very blunt about it if you have bitter
[41:14] envy and strife in your hearts you
[41:15] didn't get that wisdom from above
[41:18] that that if teaching has produced that
[41:20] then you didn't get that from christ
[41:22] he's saying something is wrong somewhere
[41:24] if there's bitter jealousy and bitter
[41:26] selfish ambition
[41:28] something that is uh very profound about
[41:32] the use of the word gentleness and it
[41:33] relates to meekness
[41:34] and it's contrasted by jealousy
[41:36] gentleness is the opposite
[41:38] of jealousy because jealousy is the
[41:42] inability to rejoice when somebody else
[41:44] is blessed
[41:46] and gentle gentleness means you rejoice
[41:49] when somebody else is blessed
[41:51] but if you're insecure and you're
[41:52] calling insecure in your position and
[41:54] secured who you are
[41:56] insecure in what god has made you or
[41:57] what god has given you as soon as god
[41:59] gives somebody else something different
[42:00] or even something equal
[42:02] you immediately want to distinguish
[42:04] yourself so you have a lot of things to
[42:05] say about that person or about the
[42:06] benefit of the blessing
[42:08] to make it seem inferior to what you
[42:09] have because you simply can't just say
[42:12] isn't that wonderful what god is doing
[42:15] isn't that wonderful what god has done
[42:17] did you hear this did you hear
[42:19] that gentleness is the ability to
[42:21] rejoice when somebody else testifies
[42:23] about the goodness of god
[42:25] but if you have that little and your
[42:26] spirit and there's something in you
[42:28] that wrestles with and gets bitter
[42:30] whenever you hear a testimony or god
[42:32] something being lifted up something
[42:33] being praised immediately challenge
[42:35] yourself whether or not that originates
[42:36] within you
[42:38] and your ability to rejoice is the
[42:41] source your own bitterness
[42:42] is a source your own jealousy he says
[42:45] where you need wisdom from above
[42:49] jealousy is a lack of gentleness so he
[42:51] says where there's
[42:52] bitter envy and bitter strife he says
[42:55] this wisdom
[42:56] this knowledge this experience this
[42:58] understanding or perception
[43:00] is not from god but it's earthly it's
[43:02] sensual it's devilish
[43:04] it's superficial it not being from above
[43:08] it's not deep
[43:10] it being very superficial and very
[43:11] shallow it's not discerning
[43:14] this wisdom that produces these
[43:17] characteristics
[43:18] is not established in truth but he says
[43:21] this wisdom
[43:22] produces confusion in every evil work
[43:25] there's the instability again the wisdom
[43:28] that is from the earth the wisdom that
[43:29] is sensual the
[43:30] wisdom that is devilish creates an
[43:32] instability a state of disorder
[43:34] it's disturbance when you are feeding on
[43:37] the wrong kind of wisdom you should know
[43:39] it in your spirit
[43:40] there's a part of you that becomes
[43:42] unsettled
[43:43] and that's when you know that you're not
[43:45] a double-minded man when you have that
[43:47] part deep inside of you that can
[43:48] recognize
[43:49] when something's trying to move you off
[43:50] the center and rule you in the emotional
[43:53] realm
[43:53] and you could take the word of god and
[43:54] say no i got to bring this now subject
[43:56] to the word bring it back to the word
[43:58] and become stable again
[44:01] get that equilibrium back and so where
[44:04] there's confusion in every evil work
[44:06] it's speaking of a restlessness
[44:09] why is it self-assertive why is it
[44:11] selfish why is it manipulative why is it
[44:13] controlling because it's restless
[44:16] where there's confusion in every evil
[44:17] work he's described in a state of
[44:19] rebellion
[44:20] where things are not in their proper
[44:21] order things are not subject to the
[44:23] higher powers
[44:23] it's chaos in that situation
[44:27] this wisdom he says descended not from
[44:29] above
[44:32] so then meekness now
[44:35] i'm just about to arrive to my my
[44:38] closing
[44:39] scriptures and if you're worried that
[44:42] the sermon's going to be too
[44:43] short my closing scriptures are an
[44:44] entire chapter in the old testament now
[44:50] you're really getting nervous because
[44:51] some long ones in the old testament
[44:55] so let's ponder this as we want to bring
[44:57] this to a head here
[45:00] this meekness that's talking about
[45:01] meekness comes from the revelation of
[45:03] knowing that god is in control
[45:07] a revelation that god is in control and
[45:10] you are a part of god
[45:13] brother tim dodd mentioned many many
[45:15] years ago it was so helpful to me it was
[45:17] at a men's meeting
[45:18] and he was using the example of joseph
[45:20] and he said
[45:22] you talk about how knowing your position
[45:24] resolves bitterness
[45:28] even to even to look back and see that
[45:30] whatever whatever has been done
[45:32] to harm you whatever's been done as a
[45:33] conspiracy against you whatever other
[45:35] people have done and
[45:36] how they've acted and all the things
[45:37] that they've done if you're confident
[45:39] that god has looked out after you and
[45:41] used all those things to make you
[45:43] more blessed and to produce a greater
[45:46] character in your life
[45:47] and to bring blessing your way if you're
[45:49] at peace with that then you can look
[45:51] back at all the evil actors in your life
[45:53] and you still don't have to hold a
[45:54] grudge
[45:57] you say you know what was meant for evil
[45:58] god's used i know this brother might
[46:00] have meant that and i really thought
[46:02] this brother was
[46:03] uh somebody that i could trust and you
[46:05] look back and you see all these things
[46:06] if you're really secure
[46:07] that god is in control and that he's
[46:09] placed you in your position
[46:10] it resolves bitterness that's why joseph
[46:12] still didn't harbor any bitterness in
[46:14] his heart
[46:14] even though the reality of everything
[46:16] that had been done to him was wicked was
[46:18] vile and was meant for evil
[46:20] he still recognized that god had put him
[46:22] in his position
[46:23] not just despite it but by it
[46:27] and it resolved any hard feelings he
[46:29] would have against any of the bad actors
[46:30] in his life
[46:32] and therefore he could be meek even in
[46:34] the face of his accusers he could be
[46:35] meek in the face of his abusers
[46:37] he let go of even his sense of demanding
[46:40] justice and things need to be a certain
[46:41] way
[46:42] because meekness comes from the
[46:43] revelation that god is in control and
[46:45] i'm a part of god
[46:48] thus wisdom responds to complication
[46:53] because we haven't left this whole train
[46:54] of thought that the end of the beginning
[46:56] now it's complicated
[46:58] and even the the and if you're wondering
[47:00] what does this have to do with family
[47:02] does not conflict help you understand
[47:03] the use of the phrase conflict
[47:06] not help you understand what it has to
[47:07] do with family
[47:09] resolving things and having wisdom what
[47:11] is it we want we don't want just a list
[47:12] of rules
[47:14] if this happens do this and it's like a
[47:16] cheat sheet we really actually think
[47:17] that we can sit down
[47:19] and be handed a cheat sheet so that
[47:20] whenever something happens we just pull
[47:22] it out and say
[47:22] hmm okay page chapter and have a
[47:25] playbook
[47:27] listen this still needs the wisdom of
[47:30] god
[47:31] to make it applicable that's what we're
[47:34] needing we're needing wisdom not just a
[47:35] bunch of rules and algorithms that we
[47:37] just can
[47:38] memorize and apply in every situation
[47:39] but lord give me wisdom
[47:42] parents who are homeschooling people who
[47:45] are teachers
[47:46] even in an academic setting have
[47:47] realized that not everybody in the
[47:49] classroom not everybody in the family
[47:50] learns the same way so you have to adapt
[47:53] you've got the curriculum you've got the
[47:54] answer book you think oh
[47:55] this is going to be easy we've got this
[47:57] we've got everything we need to teach
[47:58] and you think it's just like
[47:59] let's read the lesson now do the
[48:01] workbook and i'll grade it when you're
[48:02] done
[48:03] and you do everything that was laid out
[48:04] before you're like they're not getting
[48:06] it
[48:08] what do you need at that point you need
[48:09] some wisdom to figure out why are they
[48:11] not getting it
[48:12] what kind are they a different kind of
[48:14] learner is the curriculum not even
[48:15] suited for this child
[48:16] is there a different way that we need to
[48:18] come at this it's not just having
[48:20] some curriculum that spells out all the
[48:22] things you're going to need to do
[48:23] but it's god giving the wisdom from
[48:25] above
[48:27] i don't know that anybody here was
[48:28] thinking what in the world does this
[48:29] have to do with where you what you've
[48:31] been preaching on
[48:32] to the last 52 services but here we are
[48:35] wanting to emphasize this that true
[48:36] wisdom responds to complication
[48:39] differently than earthly wisdom
[48:43] responds to criticism it responds to
[48:45] injustice it responds to difficulty
[48:47] differently than earthly wisdom
[48:51] in first corinthians chapter 10 verse 1
[48:53] it says now i paul
[48:54] myself beseech you how he's going to
[48:56] beseech them how he's going to plead
[48:57] with them
[48:58] by the meekness and gentleness of christ
[49:02] that's what paul wanted to use the
[49:03] meekness and gentleness of christ
[49:07] i do believe that christ came to bring a
[49:09] sword i believe that christ
[49:10] is the word it is it is the sword that's
[49:12] been placed into the hands of the
[49:13] believer that christ
[49:15] is this lion he has revealed himself
[49:17] with this mane of a line he's declaring
[49:19] he's shouting he's
[49:20] he's bringing forth great judgment in
[49:22] this end time but he
[49:23] the same one who's the lion also is a
[49:26] lamb
[49:29] and so he says i can i want to use the
[49:32] meekness and gentleness of christ the
[49:34] clemency
[49:35] the mildness the fairness the even the
[49:37] word that's used in one translation i
[49:39] believe is the sweet reasonableness of
[49:41] christ
[49:43] there was a sweetness to his reason that
[49:45] though he was tied to the word and
[49:46] though he used the word and he could not
[49:48] react outside of it there wasn't this
[49:50] harshness that always came with it
[49:51] to where it was just bold in your face
[49:53] and there was never this
[49:54] yielding and this understanding and a
[49:57] really uh
[49:58] an apprehension of the situation that he
[50:00] was facing
[50:02] but the word was always effective in his
[50:04] mouth
[50:06] so paul says i want to use the
[50:07] maintenance and gentleness of christ the
[50:08] words
[50:09] that are used here paint the picture of
[50:10] moderation
[50:12] paint the picture of patience and grace
[50:15] we could even read
[50:16] about the characteristics of love what
[50:19] james is lifting up and what paul is
[50:20] referring to about the meekness and
[50:22] gentleness of christ
[50:23] is something that endures something that
[50:25] is kind something that is long-suffering
[50:29] being short-tempered and impatient
[50:32] relates to the lack of humility it
[50:35] relates to the lack of
[50:36] meekness this is why james is saying hey
[50:39] if you're a leader you shouldn't be a
[50:40] brawler
[50:42] that's why paul says it you shouldn't be
[50:44] someone that rolls up their sleeves and
[50:46] gets in fist fights
[50:48] if we're gonna if we're gonna have the
[50:49] right kind of temperament within
[50:50] relationships with our family we ought
[50:52] not be the ones that immediately roll up
[50:53] proceeds
[50:53] hey you want to fight and let's fight
[50:56] and so this quick temperament this
[50:58] impatience
[50:59] is the lack of humility it's a lack of
[51:01] meekness because how is jesus christ
[51:03] destruct
[51:04] meek and lowly
[51:09] we've allowed the devil to describe
[51:10] meekness as weakness
[51:13] when in reality the meek the broken are
[51:14] ones that have favor with god and power
[51:16] with god
[51:17] when jacob became israel when he was
[51:19] limping when he was broken
[51:21] then he had favor and power with god as
[51:23] israel
[51:25] so meekness isn't weakness because it
[51:27] begins with submission to god
[51:30] and james did not just tell us to resist
[51:32] the devil and he'll flee he said submit
[51:34] yourselves therefore to god
[51:35] resist the devil and he'll flee
[51:37] resistance without submission is futile
[51:41] we've done a lot of resisting without
[51:43] submitting and that's why it's failed
[51:46] but first submit yourselves therefore to
[51:47] god then resist the devil and he will
[51:50] no question about it he will flee
[51:54] so our meekness begins with submission
[51:56] to god so meekness is not bondage
[51:58] through
[51:59] helplessness and through weakness
[52:02] and since meekness begins with our
[52:04] submission to god and it's not because
[52:05] we're hopeless and because we're weak
[52:07] therefore there's no need for force
[52:08] there's no need for deceit when it comes
[52:10] to meekness
[52:12] if you've left meekness the meekness of
[52:14] wisdom if you don't have the meekness of
[52:15] wisdom
[52:16] but you have some sort of earthly wisdom
[52:18] you will resort to deceit and trickery
[52:20] because you think you're right and
[52:21] you'll justify the deceit
[52:23] you'll justify the white lie you'll
[52:25] justify a little bit of the fudging
[52:27] because you feel well this is true
[52:31] and so i can get away with this whereas
[52:32] wisdom does not need to
[52:34] manipulate the facts wisdom truism from
[52:36] above can rest in the truth
[52:38] and it does not need to resort to force
[52:40] or deceit to get the job done
[52:45] therefore the meat because we're saying
[52:47] wisdom responds to complication
[52:48] differently the meek endures suffering
[52:50] and criticism at the hand of others
[52:54] very differently than an earthly
[52:57] devilish wisdom
[52:59] the meat can suffer harm at the hand of
[53:02] others
[53:03] and look at their the one that's harming
[53:05] them and actually have pity on them
[53:08] how can you have pity on an accuser how
[53:11] can you have pity on an abuser how can
[53:13] you have pity on one
[53:14] that's criticizing how can you have pity
[53:16] on one that's harming how can you have
[53:17] pity
[53:18] because you're overwhelmed with the
[53:19] sense that you know what's motivating
[53:21] them
[53:22] you know what's guiding you know what
[53:24] they're working against you know what
[53:25] you're called to
[53:26] and therefore knowing that they have a
[53:29] wisdom that's from beneath and you have
[53:30] a wisdom from above
[53:31] you can look at them as objects of your
[53:33] pity
[53:35] like oh god they have no idea what
[53:37] they're doing
[53:42] we ought to be able to suffer criticism
[53:46] better than we have in the past
[53:50] we ought to be able to endure slights
[53:52] and accusations and false narratives and
[53:54] lies and
[53:56] difficulty and situations for even you
[53:58] know you know you're being falsely
[54:00] accused you know that's not the way it
[54:01] happened you know
[54:02] and be able to conduct yourself in such
[54:04] a way to say lord i don't know what i'm
[54:06] going to do this is this is not right i
[54:07] didn't do that i'm being falsely accused
[54:09] and rest in knowing that what you did
[54:11] was what he wanted you to do
[54:15] knowing that if you're wrong then you
[54:17] just need to say i'm sorry i made a
[54:18] mistake
[54:21] and take the the they no longer would it
[54:24] takes that ability to control you
[54:25] through condemnation and shame right
[54:27] away
[54:27] i'm sorry you're right i should have
[54:29] done that
[54:30] i'm real i'm really sorry please forgive
[54:32] me i was wrong for that and they're like
[54:34] wait a minute i've been told
[54:38] stories of others who are in road rage
[54:41] situations where someone pulls up next
[54:42] to them and is just going nuts and crazy
[54:44] like
[54:45] i am so sorry i did not see you and
[54:48] they're like
[54:48] huh what wait a minute i always want to
[54:51] get the fisty cuffs
[54:53] i got a concealed carry i was wanting to
[54:54] use today and you're just like hey man
[54:57] i'm sorry i made a mistake it defuses it
[55:02] when you go and read in the proverbs
[55:03] about how a soft answer turneth away
[55:05] wrath he begins to talk about how wisdom
[55:07] speaks
[55:09] and wisdom does not have to get boastful
[55:11] and forceful and loud
[55:13] it can rest strongly and knowing the
[55:15] truth's on his side
[55:19] so james concludes in verse 14 not
[55:21] concludes but let me just say
[55:23] go back to what he says in verse 14. if
[55:26] you have bitter envion and strife in
[55:28] your hearts
[55:29] if you do have it if you're going to be
[55:31] honest with yourself let him who's wise
[55:33] that a wise man and endure with
[55:34] knowledge who shows forth his
[55:36] uh uh wisdom and knowledge to the
[55:38] meekness of wisdom
[55:39] in his life living out you know that
[55:42] that's one who's in that place where
[55:43] he's been endued with the
[55:44] kind of wisdom from above but if you
[55:46] don't have that this is what he says
[55:48] light glory not if you do have bitter
[55:51] envy in your hearts then glory not and
[55:53] lie not against the truth
[55:55] don't be arrogant and deny the truth
[55:58] just be honest and admit it that's the
[56:01] simple
[56:02] prescription if you have it in your
[56:04] heart
[56:05] then he says don't be arrogant don't
[56:07] glory in what is not true
[56:10] don't deny the truth or lie not against
[56:12] the truth just be honest and admit it
[56:16] and if we can be honest and admit it and
[56:18] resolve the begin to resolve these
[56:20] things in our hearts
[56:20] then we'll be able to see it and we
[56:24] won't respond in kind
[56:26] because it's one of the weaknesses that
[56:28] we have to overcome is that when we're
[56:30] met with the intensity of 10
[56:31] from the devilish wisdom we respond with
[56:33] an intensity of 11
[56:35] from devilish wisdom the sensual wisdom
[56:38] when what we need to respond with is the
[56:40] wisdom from above
[56:42] you meet me with the 12 in earthly
[56:44] wisdom i can just come at you with the
[56:46] one in wisdom from above
[56:48] and it can defuse the situation
[56:52] just admit it
[56:56] so if you want to turn to psalms 119
[57:00] i want to read this chapter
[57:03] if you want to turn to second samuel 16.
[57:06] i believe i'm going to be able to use
[57:07] this entire chapter to tell us this
[57:09] story second samuel
[57:10] 16. i appreciate my wife being the only
[57:14] one that got that joke
[57:23] second samuel 16. i'm going to use this
[57:25] as something very practical
[57:27] to challenge ourselves
[57:32] well i'll uh i'll spare you i won't read
[57:35] the whole thing
[57:40] i'm going to read through verse 14.
[57:44] let's watch how these
[57:47] let's look at one man and see some
[57:50] differences here
[57:58] and this is at a time when absalom
[58:01] is uh wanting to take over the kingdom
[58:04] he wins the hearts of israel
[58:06] and so he david and his household flee
[58:08] as absolutely has deceived david
[58:11] it's a very difficult time for david a
[58:12] very troublesome part in israel's
[58:14] history
[58:15] it says and when dave was a little past
[58:16] the top of the hill behold siba the
[58:18] servant of mephibosheth
[58:20] met him and we know where david had
[58:23] restored to mephibosheth
[58:24] uh certain things and had blessed him
[58:26] and allowed him to eat at his table
[58:27] because he was the
[58:28] of the family of jonathan and so he met
[58:31] him with a couple of asses saddled upon
[58:33] them 200 loaves of bread
[58:35] and a hundred bunches of raisins and a
[58:37] hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of
[58:39] wine
[58:40] and the king said to seba what meanest
[58:43] thou by these
[58:44] and siba said the asses be for the
[58:46] king's household to ride on
[58:47] and the bread and summer fruit for the
[58:49] young men to eat and the wine
[58:51] that such as be faint in the wilderness
[58:53] may drink
[58:54] and the king said where is thy master
[58:57] son
[58:58] he wanted to know where mephibosheth is
[59:00] where's the family not just the servant
[59:01] where's the family
[59:03] and siba said unto the king behold he
[59:05] abideth at jerusalem and now he puts
[59:06] words in mephibosheth's mouth
[59:08] for he said today shall the house of
[59:10] israel restore me the kingdom of my
[59:13] father
[59:14] so siba is saying of mephibosheth that
[59:17] he's saying now that david is fleeing
[59:20] now my family can get this just reward
[59:22] and be restored back
[59:25] then said the king david says to see but
[59:27] behold thine
[59:28] are all that pertained unto mephibosheth
[59:32] and siva said i humbly beseech that i
[59:34] may find grace in thy sight my lord o
[59:36] king
[59:37] what's happened is david is met by this
[59:40] servant this one from the the servant of
[59:41] mephibosheth
[59:43] who greets him with these gifts and he's
[59:45] given them these gifts
[59:46] and david's like well where's
[59:47] mephibosheth shouldn't he agree to me
[59:49] this is my friend
[59:51] shouldn't he be the one that meets me
[59:52] and tries to refresh me
[59:54] and now siva says oh well he's kind of
[59:58] rejoicing at this predicament right now
[1:00:00] he's an ah
[1:00:01] he's our opportunist because he he
[1:00:03] stands to gain with you on the run and
[1:00:05] israel is going to restore
[1:00:06] the kingdom of israel the house of
[1:00:07] israel is going to restore to his family
[1:00:09] saul the family of saul the kingdom of
[1:00:11] his father that belonged to jonathan i'm
[1:00:13] going to get it back so david respond to
[1:00:15] that by saying you know what everything
[1:00:17] that's mephibosheth as the king i give
[1:00:19] it to you
[1:00:20] everything that belonged to him now in
[1:00:23] this
[1:00:24] instance that's a very extreme
[1:00:27] judgment by david right he's told this
[1:00:30] story this is what he hears and in this
[1:00:32] moment david acts very very quickly he's
[1:00:33] very quick to judge harshly
[1:00:36] and this is true of david he was a man
[1:00:37] of very excitable passions he always
[1:00:39] acted
[1:00:40] he acted very quickly he was his
[1:00:41] passions were easy to be excited and he
[1:00:43] acted upon them
[1:00:45] we won't read it but i want to refer to
[1:00:46] it in second samuel
[1:00:48] chapter 19 david meets mephibosheth
[1:00:52] and he gets his side of the story and he
[1:00:54] finds out that siba lied about him
[1:00:58] so here david has met with all this nice
[1:01:00] gifts and all these raisins and who
[1:01:02] wouldn't flip out over raisins and a
[1:01:03] bottle of wine and all
[1:01:04] all these different loaves of bread and
[1:01:06] he's all excited and he's like
[1:01:08] hey did mephibosheth bring this he's
[1:01:10] like no he actually thinks the
[1:01:11] kingdom's going to be restored to the
[1:01:12] house of his father and to saul
[1:01:15] and david immediately and is almost as
[1:01:17] if it's his anger says then whatever is
[1:01:19] his is yours now as a king i decree it
[1:01:21] you can have all of his estate all of
[1:01:22] his inheritance a few chapters later
[1:01:24] david actually meets with mesebeth and
[1:01:26] he has quite the conversation with me
[1:01:27] says hey you know what
[1:01:28] he lied to you that's not the case
[1:01:32] and david in a unique resolution of the
[1:01:34] situation says well you guys figured out
[1:01:36] you can have
[1:01:36] half you let them have half but siva
[1:01:39] lied to david
[1:01:43] and the scriptures warn us so many
[1:01:46] places to not judge too quickly
[1:01:48] does it not i'm just going to sow these
[1:01:50] seeds in here as we wrap this up it
[1:01:52] warns us so often
[1:01:53] not to judge too quickly it warns us
[1:01:55] about listening to false accusations
[1:02:00] and far too often we act like david
[1:02:03] without knowing the whole situation boom
[1:02:06] we just come down on it
[1:02:08] we give our opinion
[1:02:12] and really it's even worse because it's
[1:02:14] not that we don't know the whole
[1:02:15] situation
[1:02:16] what we know about the situation is full
[1:02:18] of lies
[1:02:20] and though we're constantly warned in
[1:02:22] scripture not to react quickly
[1:02:24] to not react without knowing the whole
[1:02:25] situation this this was david's
[1:02:27] knee-jerk reaction
[1:02:28] to judge very harshly in the face of
[1:02:30] this offensive news that this one did
[1:02:32] not
[1:02:33] his friend the one that he had been kind
[1:02:34] to the one that he had done all these
[1:02:35] good things too
[1:02:36] he hears this rumor about him he hears
[1:02:38] maybe what he thought was truth but he's
[1:02:39] very quick to act he's very harsh very
[1:02:41] excited in his passions
[1:02:43] but what's amazing we're at verse 4 this
[1:02:45] knee jerk reaction by david is
[1:02:47] immediately contrasted
[1:02:48] by his next response i find it so
[1:02:52] extraordinary because what i was drawn
[1:02:53] to is this next story
[1:02:55] but what god used for context is what
[1:02:58] happened with siba
[1:03:00] but now notice what happens so that we
[1:03:03] can relate
[1:03:03] more closely with david how it's easy
[1:03:05] for us to get only half the story and
[1:03:07] get all
[1:03:08] riled up and respond the wrong way but
[1:03:09] now notice where the real meekness of
[1:03:11] wisdom is exhibited
[1:03:13] and when david when king david came to
[1:03:15] bahrain
[1:03:17] the old fence by hiram behold fence came
[1:03:20] out
[1:03:21] a man of the family of the house of saul
[1:03:24] so now he's already had the seed sown
[1:03:26] into his head that saul's house
[1:03:28] is having a party because it looks like
[1:03:30] david's on the run the kingdom's going
[1:03:31] to be restored
[1:03:32] now comes a man from the house of saul
[1:03:34] whose name was shimmy the son of guerra
[1:03:36] he came forth and cursed still as he
[1:03:39] came as he leaves his house he was
[1:03:40] cursing
[1:03:41] and as he was coming he was cursing and
[1:03:43] he cast stones that david
[1:03:44] and at all the servants of the king
[1:03:46] david and all the people and all the
[1:03:48] mighty men
[1:03:48] were on his right hand and on his left
[1:03:52] catch this this man still held the
[1:03:55] grudge against david
[1:03:58] because of family loyalty
[1:04:01] he still had a grudge because in his
[1:04:03] heart he felt like
[1:04:04] saul deserved it all saul was the
[1:04:06] rightful king
[1:04:08] it should have been jonathan and he
[1:04:09] still had all this bitterness in his
[1:04:11] heart and because it was unresolved now
[1:04:13] he saw this king compromise he saw him
[1:04:15] in a bad situation
[1:04:16] and him holding this grudge because of
[1:04:18] his loyalty to his family
[1:04:19] he's bitter still after all these years
[1:04:22] against david
[1:04:24] i so bitter to where he just drew the
[1:04:26] blinds and turned his head and
[1:04:28] thumbed his nose at the procession as it
[1:04:30] walked by but left his house cursing
[1:04:32] continued to curse as he came
[1:04:33] and then he's throwing rocks at
[1:04:34] everybody
[1:04:36] this guy's mad he's hot under the sports
[1:04:39] caller
[1:04:40] as we might say he's given hot sports
[1:04:41] opinions about david and all his mighty
[1:04:43] men
[1:04:45] verse 7 and thus said shem me when he
[1:04:47] cursed
[1:04:48] come out come out thou bloody man and
[1:04:51] thou man of belial
[1:04:53] we had some choice words for him didn't
[1:04:54] he think of all the negative nasty
[1:04:57] words he could use today to describe
[1:04:59] king david instead of below
[1:05:02] the lord hath returned upon thee all the
[1:05:04] blood of the house of saul
[1:05:05] implying that the blood of it was
[1:05:07] david's
[1:05:09] and not saul's own and whose stead thou
[1:05:11] has reigned and the lord hath delivered
[1:05:13] the kingdom in the hand of absalom thy
[1:05:15] son
[1:05:15] and behold thou art taken and thy
[1:05:17] mischief because thou art a bloody man
[1:05:21] think about how hard this would have
[1:05:22] been for david to hear this
[1:05:24] in light of the fact that there's truths
[1:05:26] contained in this accusation
[1:05:28] that absalom his own son his own flesh
[1:05:30] and blood had turned against him
[1:05:32] to rest the kingdom away from him and
[1:05:34] now after he'd been told that
[1:05:35] mephibosheth
[1:05:36] had turned his back against him now
[1:05:37] shimmy comes out cursing and throwing
[1:05:39] rocks and stoning them and says these
[1:05:41] things you're a bloody man you're
[1:05:42] getting what you deserved
[1:05:45] and then said abhishey the son of syria
[1:05:49] under the king now that uh surya was a
[1:05:53] david's sister and it's very interesting
[1:05:56] that these three sons that are often
[1:05:58] mentioned in david's
[1:05:59] history are always related to the
[1:06:02] daughter
[1:06:04] and they're identified with the a
[1:06:06] dominating well i won't say that
[1:06:08] identified with the female spirit
[1:06:12] and said with the identity of their
[1:06:13] father indicating that
[1:06:15] something is wrong somewhere
[1:06:20] did i say i was going to be short
[1:06:21] tonight because this just blows this
[1:06:25] just blows wide open
[1:06:27] this is the abishai says why should this
[1:06:29] dead dog curse my lord the king
[1:06:32] let me go over i pray thee and take off
[1:06:33] his head
[1:06:36] and you could you could see how a king
[1:06:38] would be like you know
[1:06:39] go ahead do that let's use one of my
[1:06:42] mighty men to exact
[1:06:44] vengeance and justice but then the king
[1:06:47] said what have i to do with ye
[1:06:50] you ye sons of syria
[1:06:53] though he had something to do with them
[1:06:55] these were his nephews but he says so
[1:06:57] let him
[1:06:58] curse because the lord hath said unto
[1:07:00] him curse david
[1:07:01] who shall then say wherefore hast thou
[1:07:03] done so and david said to abasha and to
[1:07:06] all his servants behold my son
[1:07:08] which came forth from my bowels seeketh
[1:07:11] my life
[1:07:11] how much more now may this benjaminite
[1:07:14] do it
[1:07:15] let him alone and let him curse
[1:07:19] for the lord hath bidden him it may be
[1:07:22] that the lord will look on my
[1:07:23] affliction and that the lord will
[1:07:26] requite me with good for this cursing
[1:07:29] this day think about how differently he
[1:07:32] responds now
[1:07:34] in the face of false accusations mixed
[1:07:36] with some truth versus how he responded
[1:07:38] to siba
[1:07:41] you would think it would be in the same
[1:07:42] vein you'd think that it would be of the
[1:07:43] same character
[1:07:45] but here david is innocent of the
[1:07:47] accusations
[1:07:49] being innocent of the accusations he
[1:07:51] didn't need to be quick to defend he
[1:07:52] didn't say yeah you go after that liar
[1:07:54] you know i'm not a bloody man
[1:07:55] you go cut his head off but wisdom held
[1:07:57] to humility
[1:07:59] and even in the way that david speaks
[1:08:01] it's that of a broken man
[1:08:02] who perhaps is thinking of his own
[1:08:04] mistakes
[1:08:06] we ever want to get real self-righteous
[1:08:09] and we want to get all indignant and we
[1:08:10] want to start wishing harm and pain
[1:08:12] and tragic tragedy on other people just
[1:08:15] think about what you would be
[1:08:17] if you got what you deserved rightfully
[1:08:20] conclude that you'd be a dead man maybe
[1:08:24] you take a step back a little bit and be
[1:08:25] like david
[1:08:28] because his response evidenced a deep
[1:08:29] humble resignation
[1:08:32] is a response of a spirit of one that
[1:08:34] was subject to god
[1:08:36] and i believe that god brought these
[1:08:38] sons of syria up in this picture
[1:08:43] he brought them up in a way to bring
[1:08:46] these two
[1:08:47] this wrestling that was within david
[1:08:49] because these sons
[1:08:51] were david's nephews and you look at the
[1:08:54] story of their lives they were selfishly
[1:08:56] ambitious
[1:08:57] and they were power hungry and they
[1:08:59] wanted position
[1:09:00] and they were willing to do whatever it
[1:09:02] take took to get it and keep it
[1:09:05] and their testimonies and their stories
[1:09:07] throughout the history of david it shows
[1:09:09] that their arrogant nature
[1:09:10] always proved to be revengeful and
[1:09:12] spiteful and evil to the point where it
[1:09:14] was grievous to david
[1:09:17] and in these sons these nephews of david
[1:09:19] in this abbasid this one
[1:09:21] it represents our worst instincts and
[1:09:23] our worst nature maybe the worst things
[1:09:24] of our past
[1:09:26] david even said this in second samuel 3
[1:09:28] 39
[1:09:29] i am as king and i am this day weak
[1:09:32] though anointed king and these
[1:09:34] men the sons of surya be
[1:09:37] too hard for me
[1:09:41] the lord shall reward the doer of evil
[1:09:43] according to his wickedness
[1:09:45] david is acknowledging their wicked
[1:09:47] ambition
[1:09:49] he's saying these guys are too much for
[1:09:50] me even though anointed to be king
[1:09:53] they're so self-assertive they're so
[1:09:54] brash they're they they want so much
[1:09:56] power they're
[1:09:57] they're always willing to do this and to
[1:09:59] do that david found himself always
[1:10:01] giving in to them
[1:10:02] and even though he was conscious of
[1:10:04] their wicked ambition he still gave them
[1:10:05] authority
[1:10:06] still gave them permission position and
[1:10:08] even let them become rulers in israel
[1:10:11] even though he knew better what did it
[1:10:14] represent that part of david
[1:10:17] but in chapter 16 second samuel chapter
[1:10:19] 16 david finally overthrows the
[1:10:21] influence of pride and selfish ambition
[1:10:24] finally he looks at it and says what do
[1:10:25] i have to do with you
[1:10:27] it's in that moment whereas in times
[1:10:29] past this is how i would have responded
[1:10:32] in times past i would have acted even as
[1:10:34] i did to abigail i would have acted
[1:10:36] easily
[1:10:36] as i did to uh um to your i would have
[1:10:39] acted in a way that was clearly
[1:10:40] through passion and through excitement
[1:10:42] even as i was maybe he was even reminded
[1:10:44] of how he just overreacted just earlier
[1:10:47] to me
[1:10:48] february's servant and how he responded
[1:10:49] well take away his kingdom
[1:10:51] maybe dave was still carrying this guilt
[1:10:52] and this conviction so when he's finally
[1:10:54] met with this
[1:10:55] he says you know what perhaps god told
[1:10:58] him to do it
[1:11:01] even now as he curses me and spits at me
[1:11:04] and mistreats me
[1:11:06] maybe if i take it quietly the lord
[1:11:07] would require me good for this cursing
[1:11:10] because you know what at the end of the
[1:11:11] day i probably deserved it
[1:11:15] this is what his wisdom did and this is
[1:11:17] what our wisdom will do it'll turn
[1:11:18] reproaches into reproofs
[1:11:22] what could be a reproach you just say
[1:11:24] you know what i'm willing to see if that
[1:11:25] shoe fits
[1:11:27] i'm willing to be examined by it and
[1:11:30] when you can turn a reproach into
[1:11:32] reproof then you can be benefited by
[1:11:33] them
[1:11:34] instead of being provoked by them
[1:11:37] when we're being provoked by them that's
[1:11:39] not wisdom from above
[1:11:41] but when we find a way to take even a
[1:11:43] nasty insult and be benefited by it
[1:11:46] now that's wisdom wouldn't that be
[1:11:48] awesome to be able to take away all the
[1:11:50] nasty
[1:11:50] filthy vile things the devil tries to do
[1:11:52] to us and we just can kind of turn it
[1:11:54] around and it becomes a benefit
[1:11:56] so every wicked scheme everything he
[1:11:58] does you just keep getting benefited by
[1:12:00] it how do you do it with wisdom
[1:12:03] a wise man endued with knowledge takes
[1:12:04] the very attack
[1:12:06] in the of the enemy and is able to turn
[1:12:08] it around for good and realize
[1:12:09] i'm not going to let myself be provoked
[1:12:11] in this instance i'm not going to
[1:12:12] respond in the flesh i'm not going to
[1:12:14] meet his intensity with the same kind of
[1:12:15] ferocity i'm just going to
[1:12:18] live above it musicians if you'd come i
[1:12:21] want to read these last
[1:12:23] two verses
[1:12:29] i could put it this way in the midst of
[1:12:30] all the trials that come upon us
[1:12:33] maybe even the desertion of family and
[1:12:35] friends
[1:12:36] like david if we could just bear them
[1:12:39] meekly
[1:12:43] the problem is all too often
[1:12:45] self-righteousness clings fast to us
[1:12:48] and it's through that that we would
[1:12:50] express an
[1:12:52] indignation and a defensiveness what
[1:12:55] happens is we forget that our lord
[1:12:56] reigneth
[1:13:02] if we could connect the providence of
[1:13:04] god to all that happens
[1:13:07] then the smallest daily trouble
[1:13:11] will no longer completely upset us
[1:13:16] if we somehow allow the providence of
[1:13:18] god to be disconnected from our lives
[1:13:20] we'll daily be losing our temper
[1:13:22] daily flying off the handle daily
[1:13:24] getting defensive daily walk
[1:13:26] acting in the flesh but if we can
[1:13:32] be meek we can take these things
[1:13:35] patiently
[1:13:37] and so then as david and his men went by
[1:13:39] the way
[1:13:41] shemi went along on the hillside over
[1:13:43] against them and cursed as he went and
[1:13:45] threw stones at him
[1:13:47] and cast dust
[1:13:50] and the king and all the people that
[1:13:52] were with them came weary
[1:13:54] they were exhausted they were faint
[1:13:57] the bible says and but i want to say but
[1:14:01] refreshed themselves there
[1:14:05] they found reviving in their spirits
[1:14:09] means they actually found new life
[1:14:11] invigoration in their souls and their
[1:14:12] spirits and their attitudes they were
[1:14:14] lifted up
[1:14:16] think how different it would have been
[1:14:19] if david had been provoked to slaughter
[1:14:24] think how different it would have been
[1:14:25] of hatred and jealousy and malice
[1:14:28] overwhelmed the king in that instance
[1:14:30] and he acted at the
[1:14:31] behest of abishai why don't you just let
[1:14:33] me take his head off
[1:14:34] and just what kind of spirit would have
[1:14:36] went through david and his men
[1:14:38] but because david was not provoked and
[1:14:42] he showed the meekness of wisdom
[1:14:44] though weary they were able to refresh
[1:14:46] themselves
[1:14:48] this is where we find rest for our souls
[1:14:50] not in fighting
[1:14:52] but in resting not in trying but
[1:14:56] entrusted it's not going to be found in
[1:14:57] all the efforts we can do to prove
[1:15:00] i remember one time going through a
[1:15:02] difficult situation and
[1:15:04] a pastor contacted me and he said you
[1:15:05] know what you need to do you need to get
[1:15:07] your story out
[1:15:09] you need to let everyone know your side
[1:15:10] of the story
[1:15:12] i was listening okay continue and he
[1:15:14] says you you do you remember why michael
[1:15:16] dukakis won the presidential election
[1:15:18] that one year and i'm like
[1:15:19] no i don't
[1:15:23] and the point was because he allowed the
[1:15:24] republican convention to get out a bunch
[1:15:26] of false stories about him
[1:15:28] and he never said anything he never
[1:15:29] rebuttaled he never put out an ad he
[1:15:30] never
[1:15:31] he never you're such a forceful vengeful
[1:15:33] lie and since he never responded to it
[1:15:35] he just kind of conducted himself above
[1:15:37] it
[1:15:37] that's why he lost so what you need to
[1:15:41] do
[1:15:42] is you need to do what michael dukakis
[1:15:44] didn't and i'm thinking yeah this is
[1:15:46] wisdom from above
[1:15:48] you could take this to the bank thanks
[1:15:50] karl rove didn't know you had my number
[1:15:54] what is it that's the carnal instinct
[1:15:58] but what would the what would what could
[1:15:59] we learn from david the battle is not
[1:16:01] minus the lord's
[1:16:03] let all my enemies draw their swords and
[1:16:05] gather in the valley of oh no and say
[1:16:07] come on come on meet me
[1:16:09] let's work this thing out and say i'm
[1:16:11] sorry i'm busy on the wall
[1:16:14] i've got a job to do i've got a home to
[1:16:17] build
[1:16:18] i've got a wife to lift up i've got
[1:16:20] children to rear i've got a job to do
[1:16:22] i don't have time to draw my sword with
[1:16:24] you and quibble in the valley
[1:16:27] that's the meekness of wisdom
[1:16:30] and all too often we lose our rest
[1:16:35] because we're operating off of the
[1:16:36] sensual devilish earthly
[1:16:39] earthy wisdom from beneath
[1:16:43] so if any man have this
[1:16:47] strife in the hearts james says glory
[1:16:50] not and lie not against the truth
[1:16:53] all we have to do to say tonight is god
[1:16:55] i'm sorry
[1:16:57] i'm putting my sword back up i'm coming
[1:17:00] back to you with a hammer in my hand
[1:17:02] and i got work to do and let's get to
[1:17:05] work
[1:17:06] could we stand to our feet tonight
[1:17:10] this is where we'll find our refreshing
[1:17:13] and a wisdom from above
[1:17:17] [Music]
[1:17:25] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[1:17:30] lord jesus tonight as we close this
[1:17:33] service and soon dismiss the people
[1:17:37] very it's a very um
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:42] pointed subject tonight
[1:17:48] maybe not much time to ponder and
[1:17:50] reflect upon it
[1:17:53] it's one that lifted up the same
[1:17:54] principle over and over again the
[1:17:56] meekness of wisdom
[1:17:59] what does wisdom look like it's the word
[1:18:01] in action
[1:18:04] it's the word in action in humility
[1:18:09] lord that's how we're going to overcome
[1:18:13] that's how any wrongs in our life are
[1:18:14] going to be made right that's how we're
[1:18:16] going to face the challenges
[1:18:18] that are in our lives lord i pray that
[1:18:21] tonight you would help us to just
[1:18:22] surrender and yield to this power which
[1:18:25] is beyond ourselves
[1:18:27] lord if there's bitter envious strife in
[1:18:29] our hearts that there's politics that's
[1:18:31] overwhelmed us
[1:18:32] and restricted us and restrained us lord
[1:18:34] let us be free from it right now that it
[1:18:36] no longer impair our thinking
[1:18:38] no longer impair our health but be
[1:18:40] delivered from it lord
[1:18:42] and enjoy the health of the wisdom from
[1:18:46] above
[1:18:47] in the wealth that is in the wisdom from
[1:18:49] above bless your people tonight as i
[1:18:51] commit them to you
[1:18:52] knowing that your grace is enough it is
[1:18:54] sufficient we love you father

[1:18:58] which you've impressed upon our hearts
[1:19:01] the word which you've preserved in
[1:19:03] scripture and delivered in this message
[1:19:04] lord we believe it we're walking
[1:19:05] according to it may it bring fruit
[1:19:08] forth fruit lord we pray in the name of
[1:19:11] the lord jesus christ

[1:19:33] the meek and lowly one that's who we
[1:19:36] make our example
[1:19:37] isn't it grand to be a christian isn't
[1:19:40] it wonderful to have a five-star general
[1:19:42] who's not pointing you in the wrong
[1:19:44] direction not teaching you to war when
[1:19:46] it's not wise
[1:19:47] but the one who's who can teach us how
[1:19:49] to be successful in conflict that's the
[1:19:51] one that i'm yielding to
[1:19:52] thank you for your patience and
[1:19:53] listening tonight god bless you we've
[1:19:55] appreciated it
