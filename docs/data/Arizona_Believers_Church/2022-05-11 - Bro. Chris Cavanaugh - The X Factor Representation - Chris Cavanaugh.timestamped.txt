[0:00] so I just want to say I I don't know if
[0:01] brother aon's listening or not but uh we
[0:04] certainly thank him for the opportunity
[0:05] he's never heard me preach um so uh some
[0:09] of you may know that sometimes that can
[0:11] be a risk uh you can get some
[0:14] interesting things that happen Lord
[0:15] willing that's not tonight so uh we'll
[0:19] uh just see how it goes but um I want to
[0:22] talk this evening and you can go ahead
[0:24] and bring up the title their brother um
[0:27] about the X Factor and in particular
[0:30] particular representation and as we go
[0:32] through this you'll understand what and
[0:34] I'm going to come back hopefully to that
[0:36] picture maybe at the end just to because
[0:38] I want to to focus on something there um
[0:41] in order to to kind of bring this out I
[0:43] I've got to go and set a foundation so
[0:46] um first thing I want to do is kind of
[0:48] set a foundation for the young ones so
[0:49] we understand what an X Factor is
[0:51] because I think the older ones we kind
[0:52] of know and an X Factor I'm not going to
[0:54] give you the definition I'm going to
[0:55] give you my personal definition it's
[0:57] basically something that you don't
[0:58] really know how it happens but yet
[1:00] somebody is able to do something
[1:03] incredible just because they have this
[1:05] particular thing whatever it is in their
[1:07] life right so if you would turn with
[1:09] your Bibles because I just want to give
[1:10] the young people an example just before
[1:14] we move on First
[1:16] Kings 19
[1:30] and the Bible says
[1:31] this says and the angel of the Lord came
[1:34] again the second time and touched him
[1:35] and said arise arise and eat because the
[1:38] journey is too great for thee and he
[1:40] arose and did eat and drink and went in
[1:42] the strength of that meat 40 days and 40
[1:44] nights unto Horeb the Mount of God so
[1:46] this is speaking of Elijah now and I I
[1:50] don't know about you all but I've never
[1:52] had food that lasted me more than a few
[1:54] days and you can tell that that I make
[1:56] sure I hang on to what I can uh so but
[2:00] Elijah here has something that's been
[2:02] given to him by God and that meat that
[2:06] he's been given he's able to take the
[2:09] strength of that food that he eats one
[2:11] day and 40 Days Later he's still able to
[2:13] to live off the strength of that meat
[2:16] now even science will tell us today that
[2:17] you can't go very long without
[2:20] food most people 40 days and you're
[2:22] going to be you know withered to nothing
[2:25] if if you last that long and most people
[2:27] will never do that with water even less
[2:29] it's just a few days actually you can go
[2:31] without water but the X Factor here is
[2:33] the fact that God could provide
[2:35] something to a man that could so
[2:37] strengthen him and so give him something
[2:40] in his being that would carry him for
[2:42] such a long long time so you understand
[2:45] that that's what a next factor is it's
[2:46] something outside of you something maybe
[2:49] outside of your ability or something
[2:50] outside of the way that you can do
[2:52] things that will allow you to do things
[2:55] that are Supernatural or things that are
[2:57] superum something that's beyond the norm
[2:59] form of what you would see physically or
[3:01] mentally or any of those other things
[3:03] something beyond that kind of Realm and
[3:06] that's what an X Factor is and so I just
[3:08] kind of want to set that groundwork
[3:09] before we get going here on on this
[3:11] service this evening and I I would love
[3:14] to to just jump in but I feel like we
[3:16] need to do a background on um kind of
[3:19] where I'm going with this with regard to
[3:22] representation and so um if you could
[3:24] just go to the next slide
[3:27] please so brother random says this I'm
[3:31] going to have to read it because I I
[3:33] don't have it with me so now things that
[3:35] were made of things that do not appear
[3:36] now I have learned through all these
[3:38] years that all the things that are
[3:39] natural are types of spiritual things
[3:42] everything that's in the natural and now
[3:44] just remember that when you see anything
[3:46] in the natural it's t typifying a
[3:48] spiritual thing see all things are made
[3:51] after things which do not appear see the
[3:53] natural then has reflected the spiritual
[3:56] I realize Aaron's got better eyes than I
[3:58] do because I should be able to read that
[4:00] from here and I'm having just a little
[4:01] bit of struggle so and I thought I made
[4:04] it big enough that I could even catch it
[4:05] from this distance but it didn't so the
[4:08] prophet is telling us that when you see
[4:11] something in the natural there's a
[4:12] significance to it and a lot of times we
[4:14] live our lives we see things all the
[4:16] time and we don't really realize that
[4:18] there's a significance to everything
[4:19] that's happening now I I think most of
[4:22] us will agree it's it's still a good
[4:24] time to be a Christian but it's probably
[4:26] not a great time to be an American or a
[4:28] Canadian or an AUST Australian or a New
[4:31] Zealander or any other country amen
[4:34] because pretty much The Fifth Dimension
[4:36] is kind of thrown up on the world right
[4:38] and it it just so the kids understand
[4:40] The Fifth Dimension is the bad Dimension
[4:42] where where there's really bad things
[4:44] okay that's where where Satan dwells and
[4:46] where the lost souls go and it looks
[4:49] like that's what you're dealing with all
[4:50] of the time is that that has just
[4:54] basically you know I and this is a
[4:56] terrible thing to say hopefully nobody's
[4:57] hungry but uh had projectile vomiting
[5:00] once and boy you I can't tell you what
[5:03] that's like but it it'll shoot across
[5:04] the room and that's kind of what Satan
[5:06] has done to the world it's just he's
[5:08] shot at everywhere and it's pretty much
[5:10] landed on everything and so for the
[5:13] world this is very discouraging but yet
[5:16] for the Christian we've got an X Factor
[5:19] that's always there and and we've got a
[5:21] representation that's always there and
[5:23] we've got something to look forward to
[5:25] and Beyond who's in control of this
[5:27] world right now and what's going on in
[5:29] in this world
[5:30] now the great thing is for the believer
[5:32] he's not in control of us right might be
[5:35] in control of politics might be in
[5:37] control of religion you know might be in
[5:39] control of different churches might be
[5:41] control of people might be control of
[5:43] the wind might be control of air but at
[5:46] the same time God provides a factor for
[5:49] us that allows us to escape all those
[5:51] different things it allows us to rise
[5:53] above Democrat or Republican and be
[5:56] Christian right it allows us to take
[5:58] steps Beyond those political divides or
[6:01] those religious divides or those
[6:02] different things like that allows us to
[6:04] get beyond that onto something else so
[6:08] if you could go to the next slide please
[6:10] so this is not my
[6:11] drawing this was not done by a a child
[6:16] um this is actually done by an
[6:18] astronaut and I don't know has anybody
[6:21] seen this
[6:22] before okay so uh it might be
[6:26] copyrighted I did my best to kind of
[6:27] piece together because I couldn't get a
[6:29] good picture this without taking several
[6:30] pieces of it and piecing it together but
[6:35] uh last year there was a group of
[6:38] astronauts that went uh into space they
[6:42] orbited the Earth three days and came
[6:44] back and the interesting thing about
[6:46] this AST astronaut group was all four of
[6:50] them were citizens not one of them was
[6:53] an
[6:55] astronaut and one of the people in in
[6:57] this particular ship called inspiration
[7:00] for on a dragon X um uh ship were sent
[7:06] into space and one of the people that
[7:08] were in there Drew this particular
[7:10] picture and it just really Drew my
[7:13] attention to something here because I
[7:15] thought that is really
[7:17] interesting because brother brandom
[7:19] talked about the red dragon and we know
[7:20] that was the Roman Catholic church but
[7:22] the dragon gave power to the Beast W
[7:25] right and this artist depiction was the
[7:29] Dragon giving power to their rocket or
[7:31] to to their spacecraft to get it out so
[7:35] that was her idea and and you know
[7:37] inspiration is a really interesting
[7:38] thing because we know that uh you know I
[7:41] don't know about you all and I'm pretty
[7:43] sure that you're with me but most of us
[7:44] don't believe in coincidence right you
[7:47] you may wait 20 or 30 years to realize
[7:49] why did this particular thing happen but
[7:51] it's not
[7:52] coincidental All Things fall into some
[7:54] kind of path or pattern because and I
[7:56] don't know how the Lord does it have you
[7:58] ever thought how do you keep you know
[8:01] all these different families and all
[8:02] these different individuals and all
[8:04] their different paths and how do you
[8:06] keep all these things working until all
[8:08] these things can come together like a
[8:10] bride draws together right until you're
[8:12] get to a bride that's going to be caught
[8:13] away how does all those things how's it
[8:17] I mean it's mindboggling to think of the
[8:19] different things because I can think of
[8:20] things in my life where you know 30
[8:23] years 40 years 50 years sad to say that
[8:27] 50 years later you realized that
[8:30] something that happened way back then
[8:32] God had a plan and you w you you
[8:35] wouldn't see it until it came to
[8:37] fruition some decades later now you
[8:39] young people it might be years or days
[8:41] later but for some of us that have been
[8:44] here a little longer it becomes decades
[8:46] after a while and you don't see those
[8:48] kind of things but so we know that what
[8:51] the red dragon is and what it represents
[8:53] that we're not going to go down that
[8:54] path because it's just too long to to do
[8:55] but in Revelations 12 and and 13 you can
[8:58] read about it and see how that red
[9:00] dragon gave power to the Beast um it
[9:02] talks about the Seven Hills and you know
[9:05] the um and that so anyway do we
[9:09] understand that we kind of have a an
[9:10] idea of that so the reason that I guess
[9:14] I was drawn to this initially is because
[9:16] there was a brother that had come to me
[9:17] and he had a particular Revelation and I
[9:20] I won't tell you his Revelation and um
[9:23] but he had a particular number that he
[9:25] felt that the bride was going to be and
[9:27] he felt that absolutely brother Brandon
[9:29] and said it and he asked me did I know
[9:30] the number um and I said well I've heard
[9:34] a lot of numbers so uh and so he he
[9:38] shared with me this particular number
[9:40] and so I started to think about it you
[9:41] can take that down if you want um I
[9:43] started to think about it quite a bit
[9:46] and that led me to start to look into
[9:49] how many astronauts have been into
[9:51] space and the thing on human nature that
[9:54] I find is if you give somebody a number
[9:57] they try and figure it out they try and
[10:01] solve what it is so if you say there's
[10:03] three kinds of Believers in the church
[10:05] and and there's three of you guess
[10:06] what's going to happen everybody's going
[10:08] to be trying to figure out which is
[10:10] which right so if you say there's X
[10:14] number of people in The Bride guess what
[10:16] people are going to do they're going to
[10:18] try and figure it out and they're going
[10:20] to try and hold somebody out because oh
[10:23] you can't be because there's only this
[10:24] number and therefore this person can't
[10:27] be so I can treat that person
[10:28] differently because they're obviously
[10:30] not bride material this other person
[10:32] though well I can see them being in in
[10:34] this particular number that I've decided
[10:36] so they are so everything's good now
[10:38] right we're we've got it we we figured
[10:41] out the number everything's settled but
[10:43] God doesn't work that way and and I
[10:45] think brother brandham taught us the
[10:47] best lesson that he possibly could and
[10:49] that was if you're the only one that can
[10:52] believe the word and can be in the bride
[10:54] just be that one so then you only have
[10:56] to worry about yourself because that's
[10:58] what we're supposed to do is just worry
[11:00] about oursel nobody else we're we're
[11:02] supposed to take care of oursel now it
[11:04] doesn't mean we don't help people and
[11:05] try and help our family and pray for
[11:06] others but what I'm talking about is
[11:08] when it comes down to it you can't start
[11:10] putting people in you can't start
[11:12] putting people out and you can't start
[11:14] going by a number at least this is
[11:15] Brother Chris's opinion now Aaron can
[11:17] correct it later if he wants to but uh
[11:21] but if you start to put a number on
[11:23] something you're going to go in your
[11:25] mind to that
[11:27] number and that's why God doesn't tell
[11:29] us the day or the hour right because
[11:30] we're going to go to that day right I'm
[11:32] going to live however I want until the
[11:34] night before that day because that's
[11:37] human nature right that's what we do we
[11:39] we just go down that pathway and we try
[11:41] and think of those things or figure
[11:43] those things out right so um if you
[11:46] could pull up the next
[11:49] slide so this is probably a little bit
[11:52] of a hard picture to to see um but this
[11:55] is actually a capsule that had John
[11:57] Glenn in it he was an astronaut kids
[12:00] from a long time ago when I was a very
[12:03] young person like you all um and he's
[12:06] being lifted onto a particular ship so
[12:09] just to give you a little bit of
[12:10] background because I felt this was
[12:12] important and hopefully we can get
[12:14] actually to the message that I wanted to
[12:15] do um when John
[12:19] Glenn was uh sent into uh space he
[12:24] wasn't actually the first astronaut to
[12:25] go from America it was a man named Alan
[12:28] Shepard and then A Man Named Gus Grom
[12:31] went after and then it was John Glenn
[12:33] that went so Allen Shephard which is
[12:36] interesting here um his name uh Shepherd
[12:41] kind of fits right because here we are
[12:43] where brother brandom talks about
[12:44] astronaut age and we're going into space
[12:47] have has anybody heard that before we're
[12:49] in the astronaut age okay just making
[12:51] sure that some if you haven't uh we're
[12:53] going to kind of explain it really quick
[12:57] so yeah it's not a great picture but but
[12:59] it's the best one that I could find so
[13:01] uh you can put it down for just a minute
[13:04] um so brother brandom talks about uh in
[13:08] the message
[13:09] countdown uh and when he starts to be
[13:12] begin talking about astronauts and he
[13:14] said that um one of the things that
[13:16] happens with astronauts um is that
[13:19] they're
[13:20] taken well he he started to talk about
[13:22] astronauts and talking about the age
[13:24] that we're in and where he started at
[13:34] so in with the natural types the
[13:36] spiritual uh where we just read what he
[13:38] starts with is the horse and buggy and
[13:41] you know this is the amazing thing to me
[13:43] about the prophet right and we're and
[13:44] I'm going to show you kind of I I think
[13:47] it probably doesn't happen maybe so much
[13:48] here but I know Brothers back East that
[13:50] I've talked to they've faced a lot of
[13:52] folks really coming down on them about
[13:54] message things um and and I don't know
[13:57] how much it happens here it doesn't
[13:58] really happen to to me much thank god um
[14:01] hopefully it doesn't happen to you
[14:02] either but just kind of arguing and
[14:04] fighting about it so I'm going to take
[14:06] this natural thing and kind of show you
[14:08] how how amazing it was and some people
[14:11] would say it was just coincidence I
[14:13] don't think so but I'll let you be the
[14:15] judges of it so brother brandom talks
[14:17] about Transportation because he says the
[14:19] natural types the spiritual and that's
[14:20] you're always going to see that natural
[14:22] types the spiritual natural types of
[14:23] spiritual so when you're seeing the the
[14:26] destruction of a country and you're
[14:28] seeing the Fifth Dimension having its
[14:30] effect on the world you're seeing the
[14:32] natural but it's a spiritual happening
[14:34] and it's taking place in the natural
[14:36] where we're seeing it right so he talks
[14:38] about the horse and bug and he he says
[14:40] that's justification there was the power
[14:42] of the horse you're coming under
[14:43] justification and that that horse and
[14:46] buggy is something to get you going
[14:48] right it it it gets you somewhere it'll
[14:50] take you it's not necessarily the best
[14:52] way to travel it's not the fastest but
[14:54] he typed it and he said when the horse
[14:55] and buggy was there it was a type of
[14:57] justification and then as the horse and
[14:59] buggy moved on it became something
[15:01] called an
[15:02] automobile and a car um for those of you
[15:06] that know what automobile is but it
[15:07] became the car and the car had more
[15:11] horsepower and initially the cars didn't
[15:13] have a lot of horsepower but they in
[15:14] fact sometimes the horses were a lot
[15:16] faster than the cars but it was a step
[15:18] up because now it could go under a
[15:20] different power than that of the horse
[15:22] but it was still horsepower in fact when
[15:24] they talk about cars I have friends that
[15:27] have muscle cars and they like to talk
[15:29] about the horsepower in the car it's
[15:31] Greek to me cuz I don't necessarily
[15:33] understand all the horsepower stuff but
[15:35] it's pretty cool that it goes fast so
[15:38] but anyway it goes from that that
[15:41] horsepower to the automobile well now
[15:43] you got horses in an engine and then one
[15:45] day there's some guys called the Wright
[15:47] brothers and they build an
[15:49] airplane and that airplane takes man
[15:53] from the ground into the
[15:55] sky and brother brandom typed that with
[15:58] the the the releasing of the the the the
[16:00] gifts of the Spirit back in in the the
[16:03] early part of this well in the early
[16:06] 1900s and there was a a cross-eyed man
[16:09] named Seymour interesting name right
[16:11] Seymour but he saw more in the word than
[16:13] somebody else had seen before just like
[16:15] the Wright brothers saw more in in in
[16:18] the fact that you could take and and
[16:20] make an airplane and get off the ground
[16:22] so now they've seen this and they they
[16:24] break it into the natural but brother
[16:27] Brandon is saying look at that's a
[16:28] spiritual happening and then he goes on
[16:31] to say now we're in the astronaut age
[16:34] because man has taken and made a ship
[16:37] and used more horsepower now same power
[16:40] just more of it and launched people into
[16:43] space right and now they're no longer
[16:46] bound just by so before when it was
[16:48] horse and buggy or car you're bound by
[16:50] the ground right you're you're stuck in
[16:51] the ground once you get to the airplane
[16:54] you you have to stay within a certain
[16:56] elevation because once you get too far
[16:58] out there there's not enough air and you
[17:00] get out into space and you become too
[17:02] light and all those different things and
[17:03] there's a a vacuum of space that occurs
[17:05] and there's a lot of cold and there's a
[17:07] lot of special things but now man has
[17:09] went beyond even basically mostly the
[17:12] pole of gravity and I'm sure most of you
[17:14] have seen pictures where people float
[17:15] around you know they're they're in in
[17:17] something but they float around I don't
[17:18] know if you've ever seen photos of it
[17:20] but they float because they get out
[17:22] somewhere
[17:23] beyond so brother random is typing this
[17:26] and he's saying each one is a step right
[17:28] each one is a spiritual happening but
[17:30] you're seeing it in the natural so with
[17:33] that picture that you saw um of the the
[17:37] dragon carrying the Space Capsule
[17:40] there's something that's changed now
[17:42] something that's happened that hasn't
[17:44] happened before but I want to just
[17:46] really quick background with regard to
[17:48] John Glenn so John Glenn was by brother
[17:51] brandom he said he's the first person
[17:53] the first astronaut in America but again
[17:56] we know from history that he wasn't so
[17:59] why would brother random say that and if
[18:01] we can go back to that picture for just
[18:03] a
[18:04] second so we know from the word today
[18:06] and I have this down but we know from
[18:09] the word today that we're living in the
[18:10] days of Noah can we agree on that I
[18:12] think I think
[18:14] even people that aren't so much
[18:16] Believers kind of understand that hey
[18:18] there's something going on in the world
[18:20] there's something happening here so this
[18:22] picture that you see is John Glenn being
[18:24] fished out of the water so by the by the
[18:27] way back when these astronauts are set
[18:30] up sent up they're part of the Mercury
[18:32] program and Mercury if you go into the
[18:34] kind of different gods thing was known
[18:38] for being a God that transported people
[18:40] from basically uh Earth to other Realms
[18:45] so um and they're riding on an
[18:48] interestingly enough a Redstone Rocket
[18:51] so you know when you're going up in a
[18:55] Redstone Rocket to me that's just
[18:57] typifying in the spiritual sense of
[18:59] things how the blood of Christ is
[19:01] because these things are named for a
[19:03] certain way now this is brother Chris so
[19:05] you can take it how you want but this is
[19:07] just how brother Chris is looking at it
[19:09] so they they take off in this in the in
[19:11] a Redstone Rocket and they launch into
[19:14] space and when John Glenn comes back
[19:16] down he's he's sent into orbit he orbits
[19:18] the earth three times when he lands back
[19:20] down they think a heat shield on his
[19:23] little capsule Something's Happened and
[19:25] so when he comes back down to earth
[19:27] they're worried about the heat shield
[19:29] and so they've had to do some other
[19:30] things so he misses his Target and so
[19:33] this particular ship that picks him up
[19:36] is called the USS destroy excuse me USS
[19:39] Destroyer Noah
[19:43] NOA and it's named after of all things a
[19:47] person named love man
[19:50] Noah and when we go back in Genesis and
[19:53] we read about Noah the Bible tells us
[19:56] this Noah found Grace in the sight of
[19:59] the
[20:00] Lord and we think of that that or most
[20:03] people think of well God how horrible to
[20:06] destroy man but man was destroying
[20:09] himself right God loved man right and he
[20:15] he evidenced that through Noah right in
[20:20] addition to this you can go ahead and
[20:22] take it down again in addition to this
[20:24] particular happening when the first
[20:27] person that launched in face was a
[20:29] Russian named Yuri gagaran Noah we know
[20:32] was a farmer did we know that okay I'm
[20:35] making sure you're with me Yuri's name
[20:39] meant farmer guess where Yuri was born
[20:43] on a
[20:43] farm in
[20:45] Russia so all these things so you're
[20:49] it's amazing to me that here the prophet
[20:51] that the Lord revealed to the prophet to
[20:53] say hey here's something about this
[20:56] here's something about this particular
[20:58] thing thing that we need to know about
[21:00] we're now in the astronaut
[21:02] age we' we've we've had justification
[21:05] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:08] and now there's an an adoption and a
[21:10] change in what you can be and how you
[21:12] can live in Christ
[21:14] right
[21:19] so can you bring up the next slide
[21:24] please so it says he said salvation is
[21:27] of the Jew
[21:29] woman we know what we're talking about
[21:31] he said and I'll get to this in just a
[21:33] minut he said you worship you don't know
[21:34] what a Jew is supposed to know the word
[21:36] see what was supposed to be but see he
[21:38] was watching now why he's going to what
[21:41] he's going to do prove his word he said
[21:44] by the way go get your husband and come
[21:46] here and she said I don't have any
[21:47] husband so what brother brandom's
[21:49] talking about here um let's continue on
[21:52] go ahead and bring it up brother sorry
[21:53] he said you've told the truth see
[21:55] because you had five and the one you
[21:57] have now is not your hus usband watching
[21:59] something happen see something took life
[22:02] now if he hadn't have been there to
[22:03] begin with if she hadn't have had
[22:05] representation from
[22:07] predestination it had have never took
[22:09] hold so he's talking about the the woman
[22:12] at the well in this particular uh quote
[22:16] And for those of you I think most of us
[22:18] do we know that story am okay because
[22:20] I'm I'm not going to read it but I I do
[22:23] want to quote or talk about her so we
[22:27] know that uh from from the prophet that
[22:29] she was just a young woman had had five
[22:32] husbands and and the one that she was
[22:33] with at the time that when Jesus comes
[22:35] to her wasn't her husband but was the
[22:37] sixth person that she'd been with and
[22:40] from all intents and purposes in other
[22:42] words from every view that you could see
[22:45] she wasn't a candidate for much of
[22:47] anything in fact she had to go to the
[22:49] well by herself people didn't want to
[22:50] hang out with her there wasn't much that
[22:52] you could see but we find out that there
[22:56] was actually something that was in here
[22:58] that there was a representation there uh
[23:01] of something inside of her that was
[23:05] special and when Jesus said something to
[23:08] her and said hey that that guy's not
[23:11] your husband you know and and she's well
[23:14] he said you'll get your husband she said
[23:16] well I you know I don't have one he said
[23:18] well you said well you told the truth
[23:20] because that guy's not your husband and
[23:22] you know I appreciate what you're saying
[23:24] that you're telling the truth but there
[23:26] was something inside of her that was
[23:29] represented somewhere else so in her
[23:32] natural person there was a spiritual
[23:35] something represented somewhere else
[23:37] that could be touched by that I want to
[23:39] go back to the um to the the inspiration
[23:43] um spacecraft that was launched in
[23:47] 2021 so there were four people that were
[23:49] on this Craft um there was a man named
[23:52] Jared isaacman interesting that his name
[23:55] is Isaac man because he actually
[23:59] paid for the flight so he bought the
[24:02] seats for the three other people that
[24:04] went on the flight and was in this ship
[24:07] with them when they went so I I'm not
[24:10] going to mention the other people's
[24:11] names but the one of them had tried to
[24:14] be an astronaut was not taken as an
[24:17] astronaut and thought that she would
[24:19] never be an astronaut and ended up being
[24:22] chosen to go on this particular trip
[24:25] another one was chosen um because his he
[24:28] had put in for a particular contest that
[24:30] they had he wasn't successful in the
[24:32] contest but another man appeared to have
[24:35] been chosen and he ended up not being
[24:38] able to go because of a certain
[24:40] restriction so he gave that seat to his
[24:42] friend and the last one was a young
[24:45] woman who at the age of 10 got bone
[24:49] cancer and the bone cancer was in her
[24:51] femur so in her leg in the upper part of
[24:54] her leg and the bone cancer led to the
[24:57] fact that she had to go under
[24:59] chemotherapy and I don't know if you
[25:00] know what that is but it's medication
[25:02] that they put into people and it causes
[25:05] them to lose their hair no I'm not young
[25:07] and and female but I can imagine what it
[25:10] would be like for a 10-year-old to lose
[25:13] their hair and not just that but and and
[25:17] you sisters could probably imagine more
[25:18] than I but in in the natural course of
[25:21] things you're going to want to go to
[25:22] like a prom you're going to want to
[25:24] graduate from high school you want to do
[25:26] things with your friends and now she's
[25:28] under this particular thing of where she
[25:30] can't go and do anything because she's
[25:33] stuck in a hospital she's undergoing
[25:35] chemotherapy she's in a place called St
[25:37] judees and at 10 years old she has to do
[25:40] all these things they they're not sure
[25:42] if she's going to live or die she's
[25:43] undergoing all these treatments and so
[25:45] they eventually do a surgery after the
[25:47] chemotherapy and they put a prosthesis
[25:49] in her leg and the prosthesis is
[25:51] basically a femur so it's a big metal
[25:54] basically Rod they have to sew it into
[25:56] her so it's very limited what she's
[25:59] going to be able to do with her life
[26:01] there's not a lot that's going to happen
[26:03] for her there's not a lot of places that
[26:05] she's just going to be able to to do now
[26:07] she eventually builds strength back up
[26:09] she becomes a physician's assistant
[26:11] physician's assistant I think that's
[26:12] what she is and she works at the the St
[26:14] judee's hospital she she um the cancer
[26:17] goes into remission she doesn't have
[26:18] anything like that now this uh young
[26:21] lady has no Ambitions to go to space she
[26:24] has no idea that there is a contest
[26:27] going on she has no idea that that she
[26:30] would be a candidate for it she's not
[26:32] even thinking about it worrying about it
[26:33] talking about it
[26:35] nothing and then one day she gets a call
[26:38] and the call is from Mr isaacman among
[26:41] other people and he said to her I would
[26:44] like to take you to space would you like
[26:46] to
[26:47] go and I thought you know that's such an
[26:49] interesting thing but what she didn't
[26:51] know was she had on the St Jude's staff
[26:54] representation because St Jude's was
[26:56] told we need you to pick somebody
[26:58] to go so she had somebody who went
[27:03] through all these different files or
[27:04] whatever and said you know what you're
[27:05] going to be the person that goes to
[27:09] space so what an amazing thing for a
[27:12] young woman who could have died when she
[27:15] was 10 with cancer could have not been
[27:19] able to to get where she was then but
[27:21] all of a sudden she becomes this person
[27:26] that has representation that allows to
[27:28] do something that very few humans have
[27:30] done a little over 600 so far they say
[27:33] have been shot into space so it's not a
[27:36] large
[27:37] group and this young woman though
[27:40] because of that representation she's
[27:42] able to take a a trip and see the world
[27:45] that that so few people see and take go
[27:48] onto a place where so few people are
[27:50] able to to be a part of that particular
[27:53] group and experience something that so
[27:55] few were able to do and I thought from
[27:58] that particular thing of that woman at
[28:00] the well you know here's a
[28:02] woman here's a woman that nobody thinks
[28:07] could possibly be anything at all in her
[28:11] life people don't want to hang around
[28:13] her they don't want to be near her they
[28:16] they they don't want to talk to her she
[28:17] has to go to to get water by herself
[28:20] because of whatever is happened in her
[28:23] past but God saw something different
[28:27] amen and he had representation for her
[28:31] and and and just in his thought in his
[28:34] thinking he thought this woman is going
[28:37] to recognize me one day when I come
[28:40] walking up to her at the well because
[28:43] there was representation in her to do so
[28:47] amen there was something inside of her
[28:49] saying you know you know I've done a lot
[28:52] of things right I I I've done a lot of
[28:54] bad things I you know I can't keep a man
[28:57] whatever and and like I said brother R
[28:59] said she was a young woman she wasn't
[29:01] like you know 70 years old and had six
[29:04] husbands or five husbands she was a
[29:06] young young woman so she she was like a
[29:09] Hollywood type woman like you know you
[29:12] have a husband and then a year later you
[29:14] got a new one and then you know maybe
[29:15] six months to a year later you got
[29:16] another one and I don't know how they do
[29:18] it uh I I don't know how they you know I
[29:22] don't know it's an amazing thing but
[29:25] that was that was that woman is here she
[29:27] is is she's in that particular State and
[29:32] yet God has a different plan because
[29:37] he's representing her in his thoughts
[29:39] already so there's an attribute of God
[29:42] that he places down in her to see
[29:44] something different and we could you
[29:46] know we can take so many characters from
[29:48] The Bible and we have the same thing you
[29:50] have Gideon who's hiding and by a wine
[29:52] press right he's he's he's ducking for
[29:55] cover doesn't want anybody to know him
[29:58] and the angel of the Lord comes and says
[30:01] hey you're a mighty man of Valor I was
[30:03] like I'm hiding by The Wine Press I
[30:06] don't know what you're talking about
[30:08] that's not me I'm I'm doing something
[30:10] different down here I'm hanging out in
[30:13] in you know a place that I don't want
[30:14] anybody to know that I'm here but yet he
[30:17] had representation somewhere else so the
[30:20] angel of the Lord wasn't lying when he
[30:22] came and said you're a mighty man of
[30:23] Valor though Gideon in his mind wasn't
[30:25] thinking that he wasn't accepting it he
[30:27] didn't at first but eventually right
[30:30] eventually the words keep coming and
[30:33] eventually the the the things keep
[30:35] saying to him and pretty soon he's like
[30:37] I am I am this but it was because he had
[30:41] representation to begin with that was
[30:43] already there and you know this this
[30:46] kind of brings me to to an interesting
[30:48] point you know we have a five-fold
[30:51] Ministry I know some people don't like
[30:53] it but we still have it here so uh it's
[30:57] okay um but we have a five-fold Ministry
[31:00] and we have that Ministry for a
[31:01] reason because you might have Aaron get
[31:05] upset brother Aaron get up and say
[31:07] something and maybe 99% of everybody
[31:09] catches what he's
[31:11] saying but there's always one that needs
[31:14] somebody else to say it and and let me
[31:15] give you an example when I was a young
[31:18] person uh a long time ago uh my uh uh
[31:23] one of my
[31:24] relatives uh was the first one that well
[31:27] sorry the second one that actually came
[31:28] to the Lord um I was raised Roman
[31:30] Catholic by the way so just to give you
[31:32] a background and um he had come to the
[31:35] Lord and he was he was a very uh zealous
[31:38] person and uh uh very smart and and a
[31:43] good speaker and um all those things but
[31:46] it was real interesting because I I came
[31:49] to the Lord several years after he did
[31:51] gave my heart to the Lord and he would
[31:53] go and talk to
[31:55] people and he would say you know
[31:58] whatever he was witnessing or testifying
[32:00] or it didn't even have to be about you
[32:02] know Church it could have been about
[32:03] just anything and he would say something
[32:05] to him and they just never really got it
[32:08] and then I'd come and I didn't know what
[32:09] I was saying hardly and I'd say
[32:11] something and just because my Approach
[32:13] was different saying the exact same
[32:16] thing but with a different approach they
[32:18] would receive it and he's like this how
[32:20] does this work like how is it that I can
[32:22] say this to somebody now that wasn't
[32:24] everybody because there were other
[32:25] people that he would reach just fine and
[32:27] I wouldn't be able to do it but because
[32:31] there is something in there it doesn't
[32:34] mean that the first time that you hear
[32:36] something you're necessarily going to
[32:37] catch it right you might hear it from 20
[32:40] different people but there's a
[32:43] representation somewhere that makes you
[32:45] able to receive it when the time for you
[32:48] to receive it arrives there's a way that
[32:51] you're going to receive the word of God
[32:52] no matter what when that time arrives
[32:54] for you because there's a representation
[32:57] somewhere that's making sure that you're
[32:59] going to going to dive into that or or
[33:01] or step into that particular thing
[33:04] there's no way that you're going to miss
[33:05] it because God has an attribute and
[33:08] that's his thought from the beginning of
[33:09] the foundations of the world to say
[33:12] brother sister when the time is right
[33:15] someone's going to get up and say
[33:16] something or somebody's going to come by
[33:18] your job somebody's going to happen by
[33:20] the Circle K or wherever it is that you
[33:22] get your soda I don't know but something
[33:25] is going to happen somewhere and you're
[33:27] going to catch that
[33:29] thing we're living in an astronaut
[33:32] age and you're all meant to be
[33:34] astronauts do you know
[33:36] that now you're probably not going to
[33:38] get to fly on a dragon X Space Capsule
[33:41] and you probably won't get to meet Elon
[33:44] Musk
[33:46] or Jeff Bezos and his new Shepherd
[33:49] spacecraft or one of those people you
[33:52] probably won't get to do those things
[33:55] but at the same time you're going to get
[33:58] to go something beyond
[34:00] that spiritually you'll be so far beyond
[34:03] that now brother brandom said that
[34:04] you're going to go by the moon so fast
[34:06] you won't even see
[34:07] it that's pretty fast that's pretty
[34:11] impressive you know right now they they
[34:14] have a power and and in fact I'm sorry I
[34:16] didn't put it in the slide presentation
[34:18] but they uh one of the Rockets actually
[34:22] more than one um when they started
[34:25] writing about uh the astronauts and that
[34:27] that some of the writers would say they
[34:29] rode into space on a pillar of
[34:32] fire and in fact NASA even has a picture
[34:35] of it where they have the space shuttle
[34:37] Columbia and it's taking off and they
[34:39] have this big thing of fire behind it
[34:41] and it says they they're riding on the
[34:43] it says right in their thing Pillar of
[34:46] Fire so I just find it so fascinating
[34:49] that that you know Satan tries to do
[34:52] everything with man and tries to work
[34:53] out all these things and yet God just
[34:55] keeps working to say hey I have kind of
[34:58] hidden this for you amen but take a look
[35:01] over here because something's fixing to
[35:04] happen now in the scripture we know that
[35:06] there was a wedding supper right and in
[35:09] that wedding supper there's an
[35:10] invitation made and the people that are
[35:14] invited not everybody can come people
[35:17] just say sorry I can't make it right so
[35:20] then the the the invitation from the
[35:23] wedding supper moves on and says well
[35:24] listen go in and invite those people in
[35:27] the highways and
[35:28] edges let's see if they can make it
[35:31] right actually it's the lame the Halt
[35:33] and and the MIM that get invited and
[35:36] then those in the highways and hedges so
[35:38] we see not a change in dispensation but
[35:40] a change in management because that
[35:42] wedding the wedding hasn't changed the
[35:45] supper is still the same The Wedding
[35:47] Planner is still the same the location
[35:49] is still the same what they're going to
[35:51] dine on is still the same everything is
[35:54] still the same about the wedding but
[35:55] what's changed is the way that they're
[35:58] managing who is coming to the wedding
[36:02] right that the the the the robes that
[36:04] they're going to be handed out all the
[36:06] same nothing's changing on that wedding
[36:09] but the management has changed and
[36:12] that's what's in my opinion right now
[36:15] happening today something has changed
[36:18] now I'm not a prophet I'm not going to
[36:20] tell you I don't know what that thing is
[36:22] but I know this much if God went out of
[36:25] his way to tell a prophet to pay
[36:26] attention to astronaut age and said
[36:29] listen your astronauts he said we're in
[36:30] the eagle age and then he equated it to
[36:32] the astronaut age right we know what
[36:34] we're feeding on we're feeding on the
[36:36] true word of God we know that that word
[36:38] is going to take us to somewhere
[36:40] somewhere greater than what this is
[36:42] right now and you have a representation
[36:45] somewhere that
[36:46] says you're going to make it amen and
[36:49] you can read in the word and and when we
[36:51] identify in the word there's a bride
[36:52] that's going to be without spot or
[36:54] wrinkle do you know that there's there's
[36:56] a representation in you to say Amen to
[36:59] that word and not just say Amen to it
[37:01] but that it becomes a part of what you
[37:03] are when brother bradam originally
[37:05] preached the countdown he was preaching
[37:07] three different messages and and he he
[37:09] kind of had it in a group and he was
[37:12] talking uh on the first one he was
[37:15] um got I have to remember where he was
[37:17] at he was talking about
[37:20] um in his presence was the last one and
[37:22] then it was the countdown oh present
[37:23] stage of my Ministry so present stage of
[37:26] my Ministry he was doing a teaching and
[37:27] he said present stage of my Ministry
[37:29] this is what's
[37:30] happening everybody's separating from
[37:33] me right just like he talked about Deus
[37:37] when Deus separated from Paul and he
[37:38] went in and he was talking about how you
[37:41] know a brother wanted to go up and hit
[37:42] Deus when he got to Heaven he said like
[37:43] I don't know that you're going to do
[37:44] that but I'm not sure if we're going to
[37:46] be hitting people over there but you
[37:48] know but he understood why he was he was
[37:50] frustrated that Deus had left Paul and
[37:53] he was saying in my ministry right now
[37:55] this is what's happening
[37:57] people are going to leave because I'm
[38:00] sticking with a particular word and I'm
[38:02] going to continue with that word and he
[38:04] talked about how when it was The Healing
[38:06] Ministry how everybody came right right
[38:09] and and you know for the gifts and when
[38:11] the discernment and everybody was
[38:12] excited but when it started to say you
[38:14] need to to stick with the whole Bible
[38:17] when it started to say that look it you
[38:20] this is this is how God is revealing
[38:23] himself in this day Jesus Christ is the
[38:25] same yesterday today and forever he
[38:27] doesn't
[38:28] change everything else changes God
[38:31] doesn't
[38:33] change right and so he's pointing out in
[38:35] this particular thing that there's going
[38:38] to be persecution the closer you get to
[38:42] fulfilling that word the closer so the
[38:45] closer he got to accomplishing what he
[38:47] was sent here to do there was a
[38:49] separation that started to happen so I
[38:52] just want to say Saints don't be
[38:53] surprised by the separation right
[38:56] because that's what we learned from
[38:57] there and then after he he preached that
[39:00] he went into the countdown and he said
[39:02] he wanted to do something
[39:03] prophetic So Pro prophetic means future
[39:07] right means forward thinking it's it's
[39:09] something that's going to happen so he
[39:11] said we're in the astronaut age now but
[39:14] he was pointing also to a future time a
[39:17] future thing that was was going to take
[39:20] place and I believe that he left that
[39:23] for us to show us just by those things
[39:26] that I'm talking about this even evening
[39:28] that that future time is upon you
[39:31] because you're seeing in that in that
[39:33] countdown message where he showed those
[39:35] different steps from horse and buggy to
[39:38] car to airplane to to
[39:41] astronaut where we're living at
[39:44] but there was a huge to me this is a
[39:48] huge change a huge change in the natural
[39:51] in fact just so you know even in the
[39:53] natural they're recognizing that
[39:55] particular change because they're saying
[39:58] that for the past six decades basically
[40:00] the way the astronaut program has worked
[40:02] is it's either been nation states or you
[40:05] know particular countries things like
[40:07] that and they handpick their
[40:10] astronauts right when when the astronaut
[40:12] program started you had to be under 40
[40:15] years old you had to be so I was out
[40:18] already I'm out of there some of you are
[40:20] still good you're still hanging in there
[40:21] you had to be a man you had to have a
[40:23] bachelor's degree or you had to at least
[40:27] to have the equivalent of a bachelor's
[40:28] degree you had to be a test pilot you
[40:31] had to endure incredible physical uh
[40:34] tests they would have them like blow
[40:37] into tubes and see who could blow the
[40:38] longest they'd Splash them into water
[40:41] they'd put them in a spinner and spin
[40:42] them around like
[40:43] crazy I don't know what the name of it
[40:45] is maybe Michael knows but I I don't
[40:46] know what it is but anyway theyd put him
[40:48] in there and they'd spin him around
[40:49] until they were you know as sick as
[40:52] could possibly be they had all kinds of
[40:54] physical tests for them if you weren't
[40:56] the cream of the
[40:57] if you weren't the best of the best you
[40:59] were not going to be an astronaut there
[41:01] was no way that you were going to be in
[41:03] this
[41:04] program so now we come to
[41:08] 2021 and you got a A guy who has a a
[41:12] basically a business where he processes
[41:15] payments and becomes a billionaire
[41:17] amazing how many people become
[41:18] billionaires doing things nowadays and
[41:21] he chooses a person that's been a
[41:23] rejected astronaut a a person that
[41:26] wasn't even going to be there because
[41:28] their their their friend won but
[41:31] couldn't go kind of like the you know
[41:33] the ones that said hey I can't go sorry
[41:35] you know you're going to have to go get
[41:37] somebody else and then they start
[41:38] searching you know in the highways and
[41:39] hedges and then you have one that ends
[41:42] up going on this trip that is
[41:46] damaged physically is not going to be
[41:49] able to run like those astronauts ran is
[41:52] not going to be able to go and do the
[41:54] test that the astronauts did in fact
[41:57] kind of like Jacob and Israel has a
[41:59] little bit of a walk that's funny
[42:02] because something has happened to her in
[42:05] her life and you would say and and she's
[42:07] got a scar I'm sure I I I I don't know
[42:09] how big or how long or whatever I
[42:11] haven't seen the SCAR or pictures but
[42:14] knowing surgery uh it's probably as long
[42:16] as her her thigh is because they had to
[42:19] cut it and take that whole bone out and
[42:22] put something back into place and they
[42:25] had to to fix that particular flaw but
[42:28] yet in her flaws in all those things
[42:32] that she had just like the woman at the
[42:33] well in those flaws yet there was
[42:36] somebody representing her saying listen
[42:39] you can do
[42:41] this this is something that's possible
[42:43] for you amen and there was an attribute
[42:47] there now St Jude just so you know St
[42:49] Jude is the the the uh patron saint of
[42:51] impossible
[42:55] causes amazing I I the the types are
[42:58] just amazing but we know this with God
[43:01] there's nothing right nothing is
[43:05] impossible am nothing at
[43:07] all when he comes to the Virgin Mary he
[43:10] starts talking to her and he's and he's
[43:12] saying look it you're you're you're
[43:14] you're going to conceive a son it's
[43:15] going to be Jesus that's what you're
[43:16] going to call him these are the things
[43:18] he's going to do he's going to save his
[43:19] people from his sins and by the way your
[43:21] cousin Elizabeth is six months pregnant
[43:25] with with the Forerunner to your
[43:28] baby and it's like yeah but see with God
[43:32] nothing's impossible am everything is
[43:36] possible so the scars that this young
[43:39] woman had the struggles that she had as
[43:42] a young person losing her hair and
[43:44] having to undergo these treatments I'm
[43:46] sure that you know I get made fun of I'm
[43:48] bald and the guy in Old so you can
[43:51] imagine that a young girl that's you
[43:53] know 10 and loses her hair kids tend to
[43:56] not be that that nice at least they
[43:58] weren't when I was in school I don't
[43:59] know maybe maybe they're different now
[44:01] and I'm not talking about you kids but
[44:03] I'm talking about kids in general right
[44:05] because I'm sure you kids are are
[44:06] awesomely nice
[44:08] right you got to say Amen come on you
[44:11] got to you got to throw it out there say
[44:14] Amen but she didn't have those things
[44:17] and I I I just want to bring this down
[44:19] to the point for you all that in in the
[44:22] course of your
[44:24] life God
[44:27] has
[44:28] forethought everything that's going to
[44:30] happen for
[44:32] you not only has he forethought it he's
[44:35] written it in a
[44:38] Bible because you have to start seeing
[44:41] yourself in the pages of this word when
[44:44] when you when you read the message you
[44:45] have to start seeing yourself in the
[44:47] pages of that message because those
[44:49] thoughts you know God brother brandom
[44:51] said God doesn't have to do anything he
[44:53] doesn't have to heal people he doesn't
[44:55] have to save people he doesn't doesn't
[44:57] have to make himself known he doesn't
[44:59] have to do anything but do you know why
[45:00] he does it according to brother brandham
[45:02] he does it because he wrote it because
[45:04] he said this is what I'm going to do so
[45:06] he put it in his word and he said this
[45:08] is what I'm going to do so he doesn't
[45:11] have to do it right but he wants to do
[45:14] it and he wanted to do it so much that
[45:16] he thought about it and then he said you
[45:17] know I'm not just going to think about
[45:18] it I'm going to put it down on paper I'm
[45:21] going to put it down so that people can
[45:22] read about it I'm going to put it on
[45:23] tapes so people can hear about it I even
[45:27] I'm going to even make some videos so
[45:28] people can see it for themselves right
[45:31] years after the occurrence has happened
[45:34] you can see those
[45:35] things so Jesus Christ is able to take
[45:38] somebody because you've got some kind of
[45:42] representation inside of you so it
[45:44] doesn't matter the scar and and and you
[45:46] know we're talking about a physical scar
[45:48] with this young lady but I want you to
[45:50] put this in the spiritual sense okay
[45:53] because there's a lot of people that are
[45:54] scarred scenes in fact I I would venture
[45:57] to say if you're you're you're old
[45:59] enough to understand what I'm saying
[46:00] you've probably got some
[46:02] scars not physical ones necessarily
[46:06] although you could but emotional
[46:10] ones and they they tie people down they
[46:14] hold them
[46:16] back right you know what's amazing to me
[46:19] is we have a a problem as humans when
[46:23] someone has a cancer like this this
[46:25] young lady did we're we're pretty good
[46:27] about it right we feel bad for them we
[46:31] we you know want the best for them we we
[46:35] give them gifts we you know when they
[46:37] lose their hair or they have to go under
[46:39] these treatments we we want to do
[46:41] something but when a person has a mental
[46:45] illness we're not so good at that right
[46:49] right it's still a Cancer and it's still
[46:51] a demon and it's still a sickness and
[46:53] God still heals
[46:54] it good right it's still something that
[46:57] can be overcome it's still something
[47:00] that that Jesus Christ has made a way
[47:03] and he's written in his word a
[47:05] Deliverance for everyone you know when
[47:07] when he went to the the man of gadera
[47:10] that wasn't a guy that people wanted to
[47:12] be
[47:13] around right he wasn't dressed well
[47:17] right he's out there running around and
[47:18] his all together and he's very mean
[47:23] right he had a mental
[47:24] illness right right
[47:28] he had a cancer of the Mind basically if
[47:30] you want to say it that he had a brain
[47:32] cancer even a cancer of the heart maybe
[47:35] at least for that time but yet there was
[47:37] a representation
[47:39] somewhere and Christ went to
[47:42] him not worried about what he could do
[47:46] not worried about what what he' done not
[47:49] worried about where he was going not
[47:51] worried about those things what he was
[47:53] worried about was that Soul because
[47:55] there was something in there
[47:57] there was an attribute there was a
[47:59] representation somewhere and he had to
[48:01] go to him and deliver him from that
[48:04] particular thing and saints of God if
[48:06] there's anything that I could bring to
[48:07] you tonight is this is that you've got a
[48:10] representation for every scar that
[48:11] you've got and regardless of the scars
[48:14] that you have that representation is
[48:16] able to overcome those things and it's
[48:19] able to put you into the eagle age or in
[48:22] other words the astronaut age did you
[48:25] know that you were created to be an
[48:28] astronaut you're created to be a
[48:30] spiritual
[48:31] astronaut and you've got a
[48:34] representation
[48:35] somewhere that says you're absolutely
[48:38] able to do this you know that Pillar of
[48:41] Fire that I talked about so they have a
[48:42] picture can you go back to the very
[48:43] first
[48:47] slide make sure we're doing okay on time
[48:49] we're doing okay on time I think so um
[48:52] so you see that this is the that Rocket
[48:55] taking off with those four citizens in
[48:58] it that's a picture from um NASA of the
[49:02] particular um ship going up so you can
[49:05] see where they say it looks like a
[49:06] pillar of fire right in other pictures
[49:09] when you see when you see a rocket take
[49:10] off it's a pillar of
[49:12] fire and in that thing where we showed
[49:15] that red dragon you notice that the red
[49:16] dragon was giving it its power right it
[49:18] was pushing it from the back but the
[49:21] reality is for us as
[49:23] Believers yeah we've got a pillar of
[49:25] fire that that sometimes s pushes us but
[49:28] the awesome thing is it also pulls
[49:30] us right just like a magnet like brother
[49:33] random said you had that magnet that was
[49:34] passing over and that iron is drawn to
[49:36] it because it's pulling all the time and
[49:40] right now it's pulling you closer to a
[49:42] body change the Rapture right now we we
[49:45] like to think that it's off somewhere
[49:47] it's not off anywhere it's working right
[49:48] now it's already pulling on you kind of
[49:51] like if you take a magnet you ever take
[49:53] magnets now if you flip it one way it it
[49:56] pushes against right you can't get it to
[49:57] come any closer but sometimes you just
[50:00] got to change the direction of the
[50:01] magnet and sometimes that's what needs
[50:03] to happen in our lives because all you
[50:05] got to do is change the direction of the
[50:06] magnet and as it starts getting closer
[50:08] to that other big magnet Bo CU one day
[50:13] there you know you get closer and it's
[50:15] kind of hanging in there and it's kind
[50:16] of hanging in there and that's drawing
[50:18] all the time but when you get it too
[50:20] close what
[50:21] happens bam and that's the same thing
[50:24] that's going to happen to the bride of
[50:26] Christ
[50:27] it's you're you're being drawn you're
[50:28] being pushed you're being pulled and at
[50:31] the same time he's his presence is
[50:33] living in you so you don't just have the
[50:36] push of a pillar of Fire or the draw of
[50:38] a pillar of fire but you've got the
[50:40] pillar of fire inside right that
[50:42] connects you that's your representation
[50:44] to connect you back to the word that was
[50:46] spoken about you from the very
[50:48] beginning yes sir that's the thing
[50:51] that's and and and it's pulling and it's
[50:53] pushing and it's living and it's
[50:55] breathing and it's drawing drawing you
[50:57] somewhere else into a a deeper depth and
[51:00] a higher height with Christ it's moving
[51:03] you in such a direction and that pull
[51:05] doesn't stop Saints amen now when I
[51:09] first started thinking about these
[51:10] things one of the problems that we have
[51:12] is humans and I'm going to close in just
[51:13] a moment one of the problems that we
[51:15] have as humans is changes really hard
[51:18] right right I work with firefighters
[51:21] thankfully the firefighter that I work
[51:24] with isn't here so I can throw this out
[51:26] there and not get in trouble but they
[51:29] love to say we want change so we want
[51:32] change we need change change has to
[51:34] happen change has to and there's a
[51:36] challenge with change right there's
[51:39] always a challenge with it because it's
[51:41] a hard thing to do so guess what we we
[51:43] we hired a a deputy chief they said we
[51:46] need new blood we got to have a new
[51:48] person so we hire this new person and
[51:51] the new person starts to make changes
[51:53] and guess what they say that's not the
[51:55] way we do it right we don't do it that
[51:57] way and then they start to complain
[51:59] because things are
[52:02] changing isn't that that's human nature
[52:05] right we start to I hate this change
[52:08] change me change me oh I hate it don't
[52:10] change me don't don't change anything
[52:12] we're doing here I just want to keep
[52:14] everything exactly the
[52:16] same
[52:18] right but the Lord knows how to change
[52:22] and if we're like that magnet and we're
[52:23] the wrong direction and repelling all we
[52:25] got to do is do 180 and you do that flip
[52:28] 180 and you're going to be drawn right
[52:30] to it because you've got a
[52:33] representation somewhere Saints you're
[52:35] an
[52:37] astronaut a god
[52:40] astronaut a star
[52:42] sailor right that's an awesome thing why
[52:45] don't you stand with me if you can go to
[52:47] the last slide I think
[52:57] so brother brandom is saying this in the
[52:59] countdown he says may they rise from
[53:00] their Shackled down
[53:02] sickness to go out yonder in outer space
[53:04] where doctors science none of them knows
[53:06] anything about where the power of God is
[53:08] Promised by scientific research of the
[53:10] Bible here where he says or spiritual
[53:12] research rather of the Bible to show
[53:14] that God ever
[53:16] was he
[53:19] still be
[53:21] God and he is the infinite omnipotent
[53:25] Almighty omnipresent being that can keep
[53:27] his word and can do all things and
[53:29] promis us all things are possible to
[53:32] them that will believe God grant it amen
[53:36] so I think that should be our prayer God
[53:38] grant that amen because we can realize
[53:40] he's infinite omnipotent Almighty
[53:43] omnipresent he keeps his word and your
[53:47] representation is in that word Jesus
[53:50] Christ the word is your representation
[53:52] today as the bride of
[53:55] Christ we're representing him right on
[53:58] Earth we we've heard it said many times
[54:00] will be the final voice to the final age
[54:02] but that's the truth because when you
[54:05] have that Pillar of Fire behind you and
[54:07] in front of you just like they did when
[54:08] they were marching out of uh of Egypt
[54:11] and now living inside of you you can't
[54:13] help but be that you can't help but be a
[54:17] representative of that person so you
[54:20] can't help but be a representative of
[54:22] Jesus Christ on this Earth and as that
[54:25] representative
[54:26] you know what you can do you can
[54:28] intercede for others you can step in
[54:30] into the gap for others and make a
[54:32] difference in somebody else's life along
[54:35] with at the same time being that one
[54:37] that has the faith to receive the body
[54:39] change that that we talk about all the
[54:42] time we talk about it a
[54:44] lot but we have to realize we've got a
[54:48] representation and that representation
[54:50] is that X Factor that we need that
[54:53] representation is is the one that that
[54:55] is going to take you and give you power
[54:57] like Elijah had that he could go in the
[54:59] strength of what he was feeding on the
[55:01] word but that meat that he had he could
[55:04] go in that strength for so many days I'm
[55:07] not recommending that you do that by the
[55:08] way but you can go in that strength for
[55:10] so long because you've got that
[55:12] representation and it holds you and it
[55:14] lives in you and it's
[55:16] omnipresent and it's
[55:18] omnipotent it you know what the the
[55:20] awesome thing is it can overcome
[55:22] me and brother sister if it can overcome
[55:25] me it can overcome from
[55:27] you amen and we need to to think of that
[55:31] for each
[55:32] other don't don't be a
[55:34] counter that would be my advice don't
[55:37] start counting good just stay away from
[55:40] it because it's not safe what is safe is
[55:43] the
[55:44] word and and the word said whosoever
[55:47] will and I believe it whosoever will and
[55:52] and the word said just believe that
[55:53] you're the one okay I'm the one if there
[55:56] is one if there's a
[55:58] million
[55:59] wonderful I think there's going to be
[56:01] more than what natural man has done
[56:04] right I think there's more than 600 so
[56:07] I'll throw that number out there how's
[56:08] that CU I don't think God's going to be
[56:10] outdone by man he hasn't been outdone by
[56:14] man before uh we like to think that we
[56:17] we can outdo it you know that part of
[56:18] the space program is their thought was
[56:20] hey let's get to Mars so in case
[56:22] something bad happens on Earth well they
[56:24] tried that program before and Genesis if
[56:27] you'll remember and and that's when the
[56:29] language got
[56:30] confounded the awesome thing was God
[56:33] confounded the language then but when he
[56:35] reintroduced himself in the in the in
[56:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost guess what
[56:40] he did everybody could speak and
[56:43] understand the same language amen we can
[56:46] all do that through the word of God
[56:48] today amen I I hope that's been
[56:50] encouraging to you I just want to
[56:51] encourage you today you've got a
[56:53] representation you've got an X Factor
[56:55] Beyond uh beyond anything that right now
[56:58] you could think or imagine because
[57:00] that's what the word teaches us right
[57:02] that's beyond anything we can think or
[57:03] imagine and I don't know about you all
[57:05] but I can imagine some pretty impressive
[57:06] things kids I'll bet you guys can
[57:08] imagine better stuff than
[57:10] me right that's kind of what kids do
[57:13] right they have fantastic
[57:15] imaginations you know one of the last
[57:18] things I want to leave you with just
[57:20] just as a
[57:21] thought when you are looking at
[57:25] different things so let's say that
[57:26] you're out walking on a beach has
[57:29] anybody walked on a beach put your hands
[57:32] up this is audience participation time
[57:35] okay ever walked in sand maybe not on a
[57:37] beach okay so everybody's at least
[57:39] walked in sand okay so how many of you
[57:42] have ever looked at the sand and said
[57:44] you know what I see in the sand I see a
[57:48] silicon chip that can power a cell
[57:53] phone that can power your refrigerator
[57:56] now your car I see computers I see all
[58:01] these different things have you ever
[58:04] looked at metal and went wow that that's
[58:06] a plane right there that's that's a
[58:09] that's a that's a spaceship I see it in
[58:11] my mind right there's all kinds of
[58:14] things you know that that God one day
[58:17] looked at dust and saw
[58:19] you
[58:20] right I mean how many of us look at dust
[58:23] and go yeah there there's no Emmy right
[58:26] right there
[58:28] just right put yourself there God looks
[58:30] at those things right we we we can look
[58:33] at these different things but we don't
[58:35] typically we don't do that but yet
[58:38] somebody does and that's what God does
[58:43] right you can walk on a beach and
[58:44] there's all that sand or whatever and I
[58:46] don't see well let's put it this way
[58:48] dinosaurs right they say dinosaurs made
[58:50] all the the oil reserves that we have
[58:52] how many of you have ever looked at a
[58:53] can of oil and went hey there's a toy
[58:57] right hey there's buttons for my shirt
[59:00] there's pretty much every Chinese thing
[59:01] that's ever been made right there cuz
[59:04] all the plastic
[59:06] right that's what it is so all those
[59:09] things are there they're they're just
[59:12] sitting all the time but we don't think
[59:16] about that because there's not in us
[59:19] maybe the representation that the person
[59:20] had that I don't know how they came up
[59:22] with if I take sand I can make glass and
[59:24] then eventually they came up with if I
[59:26] take sand I can do something to it and
[59:28] make it wayf for thin and create these
[59:30] things and make a lot of Oodles of
[59:32] money right I'm just walking on the
[59:34] beach thinking you know sand gets in
[59:37] some irritating places I I I love the
[59:39] water but Sand's not so great but but
[59:43] there's a representation there and
[59:45] there's something to draw and so Jesus
[59:47] Christ is that way you know maybe we
[59:50] don't see that dust becoming something
[59:53] but yet he does
[59:56] maybe we don't see the the sand of time
[59:58] becoming something in our lives but he
[1:00:02] does you know those Rocky places that
[1:00:04] that we find just tough to get over and
[1:00:07] tough he seen something that is makeable
[1:00:10] there he sees something that he can work
[1:00:12] on there something that be drawn out
[1:00:15] just like man is able to see all those
[1:00:17] things Thomas Edison could see a light
[1:00:19] bulb you know we enjoy him all the time
[1:00:21] I do
[1:00:22] anyways but you know here's a guy trying
[1:00:25] a thousand different kinds of elements
[1:00:27] to figure out how to get power so that
[1:00:30] we could see by it everybody else is
[1:00:33] like Mister you're there's something
[1:00:35] wrong with your head cuz who's going to
[1:00:37] want to try a thousand times to come up
[1:00:40] with something about three times in I'm
[1:00:42] I'm out maybe four it might last till
[1:00:45] four or five but people we can see in
[1:00:50] the natural if somebody is willing to
[1:00:51] put in that kind of effort to achieve
[1:00:53] something that's in their mind imagine
[1:00:56] the effort that God is willing and able
[1:01:00] and will put into you take it personally
[1:01:05] now what God is able and willing to put
[1:01:08] into you amen because you've got
[1:01:11] representation and he sees the end from
[1:01:13] the beginning Saints scars nothing don't
[1:01:18] matter God sees the end from the
[1:01:19] beginning amen why don't we just bow our
