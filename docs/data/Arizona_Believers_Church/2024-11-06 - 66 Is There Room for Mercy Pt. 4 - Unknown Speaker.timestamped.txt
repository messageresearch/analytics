[0:00] uh Daniel 7:1 in the first year Abel
[0:03] shazar king of Babylon Daniel had a
[0:05] dream and visions of his head upon his
[0:08] bed then he wrote the dream and told the
[0:10] sum of the matters Daniel spake and said
[0:13] I saw in my vision by night and behold
[0:15] the Four Winds of the heaven strove upon
[0:18] the great sea and four great beasts came
[0:20] up from the sea diverse one from another
[0:23] so this is his vision of of the four
[0:26] Great beasts the first was like a lion
[0:28] and had an eagle's wings had eel's wings
[0:30] and I beheld till the wings thereof were
[0:32] plucked and it was lifted up from the
[0:34] earth and made stand upon the feet as a
[0:37] man and man's heart was given to it
[0:40] behold another Beast a second like to a
[0:42] bear and it raised up itself on one side
[0:44] and it had three ribs in the mouth of it
[0:46] between the teeth of it and they said
[0:48] thus unto it arise devour much flesh
[0:51] after this I beheld and L another like a
[0:54] leopard which had upon the back of its
[0:56] four wings of a foul the Beast had also
[0:59] four heads and Dominion was given to it
[1:02] so there's a representation of the four
[1:05] Beast he says after this I saw in the
[1:06] night visions and behold a fourth Beast
[1:09] Dreadful and terrible and strong
[1:10] exceedingly and had great iron teeth it
[1:12] devoured and it break in pieces and
[1:14] stamped the residue at the feet of it
[1:16] and it was diverse from all the Beast
[1:18] that were from before it and it had 10
[1:20] horns I considered the horns and behold
[1:22] there came up among them another little
[1:25] horn before whom there were three of the
[1:28] first horns plucked up by the roots and
[1:30] behold in this horn were eyes like the
[1:31] eyes of man and mouth speaking great
[1:34] things so there's uh a lot of
[1:36] symbols a whole lot of symbols and and
[1:39] when you see artistic renderings of it
[1:40] it's a very unique uh representation of
[1:43] these things he's seeing now he says I
[1:45] beheld till the Thrones were cast down
[1:47] and the Ancients of days the Ancient of
[1:50] Days did sit whose garment was white as
[1:52] snow and the hair of his head like the
[1:55] pure wool his throne was like the fiery
[1:57] flame and his wheels as burning fire a
[2:00] fiery stream issued and came forth from
[2:02] before him and thousands thousands
[2:03] ministered unto him and 10,000 times
[2:06] 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was
[2:08] set and the books were open I beheld
[2:11] then because of the voice of the great
[2:12] words which the horn spake I beheld even
[2:14] till the Beast was slain and his body
[2:16] destroyed and given to the Burning Flame
[2:19] as concerning the rest of the Beast they
[2:21] had their Dominion taken away yet their
[2:23] lives were prolonged for a season and
[2:25] time so you can see that there's events
[2:27] that are transpiring not just a single
[2:29] instance but there's a lot of things
[2:31] transpiring and again he says I saw in
[2:33] the night visions and behold one like
[2:35] the son of man came with the clouds of
[2:37] heaven and came to the Ancients of days
[2:40] Ancient of Days and they brought him
[2:42] near before him and there was given him
[2:45] dominion and glory and a kingdom that
[2:47] all people Nations and languages should
[2:49] serve him his Dominion is an everlasting
[2:51] Dominion which shall not pass away and
[2:53] his kingdom that which shall not be
[2:55] destroyed I Daniel was grieved in my
[2:57] spirit in the midst of my body and the
[2:59] visions of of my head troubled me I came
[3:01] near unto one of them that stood by and
[3:03] asked him the truth of all this so he
[3:05] told me and made me know the
[3:08] interpretation of the things amen God
[3:11] bless you you can take your seats
[3:13] tonight I know there's a lot there in
[3:15] this scripture reading in the Book of
[3:18] Daniel and these visions that he had
[3:19] there's a lot of teaching in the message
[3:21] of the hour on these things a lot of lot
[3:24] of uh images that I want to use tonight
[3:27] as we speak on the house of the Lord and
[3:29] is there room for Mercy using this
[3:32] question as their room for Mercy H to
[3:35] you know explore that in a time of
[3:37] judgment which I'm trying to show you by
[3:40] the word of God that there's this aspect
[3:42] of judgment that uh Shadows or or you
[3:46] know is kind of hovering over us in this
[3:48] time that we're living in now and in
[3:51] this time of judgment can there still be
[3:53] mercy and uh if there is Mercy how and
[3:56] what does it look like and what is where
[3:58] is this Mercy to be found today because
[4:01] there's an image that we could look at
[4:02] in scripture to see that certainly there
[4:04] does come a time where all that is left
[4:06] is judgment and a sentence is going to
[4:08] be pronounced and the question would be
[4:10] does that mean all flesh is condemned
[4:12] and there's no chance and there's no way
[4:14] and maybe we could say there is a time
[4:15] when there will be no flesh uh none
[4:18] saved left on the face of the Earth and
[4:20] those that would receive eternal life
[4:22] will have to be granted that at White
[4:23] Throne judgment and so we see these
[4:26] times in Scripture that definitely speak
[4:28] of a terrible time uh for those that
[4:31] don't believe and I'm using the phrase
[4:34] room or the term room in this question
[4:37] this phrase of is there room for mercy
[4:39] and not just is there Mercy in this age
[4:43] but is there Mercy in our hearts and in
[4:44] our homes not just is there Mercy
[4:46] available for The Sinner but are we
[4:49] merciful is there is there room for
[4:50] Mercy Even in our attitudes I'm just
[4:54] going to jump in where we were on Sunday
[4:56] and say that the age of the son of man
[4:58] being revealed
[5:00] as we see in Luke chapter 17 as it was
[5:02] in the days of Noah as it was in the
[5:04] days of lot that when the son of man is
[5:06] revealed we see that there is a change
[5:08] from the Throne of Mercy to a throne of
[5:12] judgment and in Revelations 5:5 now this
[5:15] is if you've listened to Sunday mornings
[5:17] if you were here we see that we were
[5:19] looking at um some very specific
[5:22] instances and so now we want to continue
[5:24] on this just to see what brother Brandon
[5:26] was looking at when he dealt with this
[5:28] subject of Mercy and it says in
[5:30] Revelations 5:5 and one of the elders
[5:33] saith unto me weep not because John was
[5:35] weeping because there was a sealed book
[5:37] that no man was able to look upon or
[5:39] loose the seals thereof and as he's
[5:41] weeping one says don't cry Behold The
[5:44] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[5:46] David hath prevailed to open the book
[5:49] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof it
[5:53] is this event that brother brandham
[5:55] looks at uh to characterize as a change
[5:58] of change from Mercy to judgment this
[6:01] moment when the lion of the tribe of
[6:03] Judah the root of David which is Christ
[6:06] prevailed or comes to this moment where
[6:08] he goes to the father where the book is
[6:10] resting the sealed book is and he opens
[6:13] those seals and it's this very scene uh
[6:16] that brother brandham says is a change
[6:18] from Mercy to judgment so the opening
[6:22] this is a judgment scene because in the
[6:23] opening of the book there's a lot in
[6:25] this in the open of the book there's a
[6:27] sentence to be made there's conclusions
[6:29] there's finality there's judgment even
[6:31] as John weeping we could say in many
[6:33] ways was tied to the fact that that book
[6:35] contained his absolute Vindication and
[6:38] justification that there was some
[6:40] pronouncement that would be made in that
[6:41] book that would seal up and Grant
[6:43] forever and convey uh his inheritance so
[6:46] it's a very important scene that we see
[6:49] here in Revelations 5 and as it
[6:52] describes the line of the tribe Judah
[6:53] the root of David and this coming to
[6:55] take the book if we look in Daniel
[6:57] chapter 7 we're going to see a similar
[7:00] instance in scripture because in
[7:02] Revelations 5 the son Christ goes to him
[7:04] who sits on the throne and he takes the
[7:06] book and he opens the seals and that's
[7:09] the Christ coming to the father coming
[7:11] to God on the throne and it says I saw
[7:13] in the night visions and behold one like
[7:16] the son of man came with the clouds of
[7:18] heaven and came to the Ancient of Days
[7:21] and they brought him near before him so
[7:23] here is the son of man which is Christ
[7:26] coming to the father on his throne
[7:28] because it says he came to to the
[7:30] Ancient of Days one like the son of man
[7:32] came with the clouds and came to the
[7:34] Ancient of Days so here we see an image
[7:36] of Christ coming to the father on his
[7:39] throne and in verse n it tells us who
[7:42] the Ancient of Days is or describes him
[7:44] in a particular way and it says I behold
[7:46] I beheld till the Thrones were cast down
[7:49] and the Ancient of Days did sit whose
[7:51] garment was white as snow and the hair
[7:54] of his head like the pure wool his
[7:56] throne was like the fiery flame and his
[7:58] wheels as burning fire
[8:00] the fiery stream issued and came forth
[8:02] from before him thousand thousands
[8:04] ministered unto him and 10,000 times
[8:06] 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was
[8:09] set and the books were open as we see
[8:12] one whose garment is white as snow his
[8:14] hair is as pure wool there's this fiery
[8:16] flame and these wheels of fire this
[8:18] fiery stream issuing forth is to convey
[8:21] one with wisdom the Ancient of Days and
[8:23] here is a judgment Throne this is a time
[8:26] of judgment and it's a picture that he
[8:30] is looking at and that's described in
[8:31] these several verses we're looking at
[8:33] even to verse 13 and verses 9 and 10
[8:35] it's a picture which is conveying this a
[8:38] lot of meaning and a lot of events over
[8:40] a time period because as we read later
[8:43] he says that as I'm beholding this this
[8:45] happened to this these beast and this
[8:46] happened to that beast and so there's a
[8:48] lot of things that are transpiring that
[8:50] this image is conveying and in verse 14
[8:53] this one which is like the son of man
[8:55] that comes to the Ancient of Days the
[8:57] Ancient of Days has a garment white as
[8:59] snow as his head is like pure wool the
[9:00] throne is like a flaming fire judgment
[9:02] is set now the son of man comes at with
[9:06] the clouds of heaven and came to the
[9:08] Ancient of Days in verse 14 and there
[9:10] was given him this is the son of the one
[9:13] like the son of man given him dominion
[9:16] and glory and Kingdom that all people
[9:18] Nations and languages should serve him
[9:20] his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion
[9:23] which shall not pass away in his kingdom
[9:25] that which shall not be
[9:27] destroyed here we see a time in which
[9:30] the father is committing now the
[9:33] Judgment of this Throne the power this
[9:36] fierceness this tempu isness about this
[9:38] Throne the father's committing judgment
[9:40] to the son of man in a special time I
[9:43] say special just a unique specific time
[9:46] period where this this one like of the
[9:48] son of man comes to the Ancient of Days
[9:51] and the Ancient of Days is now conveying
[9:53] in giving dominion and glory and a
[9:54] kingdom and everlasting Dominion to the
[9:56] son of man and there's this uh this we
[10:01] could even say this as we read later
[10:03] that even the son of man is likened to
[10:05] the Ancient of Days or refers to Ancient
[10:07] of Days and it's not the father but it's
[10:09] now all invested in the son so in
[10:12] Revelations 1:
[10:14] 13-6 we see another phrase that's very
[10:17] similar to this as far as one like the
[10:19] son of man coming in the Clouds of
[10:21] heaven and came to the Ancient of Days
[10:24] and so here we see the son coming to the
[10:26] father on the throne and the Ancient of
[10:28] Days has a garment wi as snow AE like
[10:30] pure wool and fiery Flames around him
[10:33] and he gives Dominion to the sun now
[10:35] John sees this in verse 13 and in the
[10:37] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[10:39] unto the son of man and notice how he's
[10:41] dressed clothed with the Garment down to
[10:43] the foot and G about the PS with the
[10:45] golden girdle his head and his hairs
[10:48] were white like wool as white as snow
[10:51] and his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[10:53] his feet like undefined brass as if they
[10:55] burned in a furnace and his voice is the
[10:57] sound of many Waters and he had in his
[10:59] right hand Seven Stars and out of his
[11:01] mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and
[11:03] his countenance was as the sun shineth
[11:05] in his strength each one of these
[11:08] phrases to describe the son of man from
[11:11] the clothing of His Garment down to his
[11:14] feet and G about in the PS with a golden
[11:16] girdle these are all symbols to convey
[11:18] meaning and to give us uh some sense of
[11:22] the son of man at this time what he's
[11:24] doing and as it says in John 5:22 for
[11:28] the son the father judgeth no man but
[11:31] hath committed all judgment unto the son
[11:34] we see now that as the son of man is one
[11:37] like un the son of man in Daniel which
[11:38] is Christ he goes to the father who is
[11:41] the Ancient of Days and who has this
[11:43] image and this disposition of a judge
[11:47] and the father gives dominion and glory
[11:49] and a kingdom to Christ now we see him
[11:52] in Revelations one one the son of man
[11:56] and now he is in this image because the
[11:58] father has committed all judgment unto
[12:01] the son and brother brandham goes
[12:04] through this when he preaches the
[12:05] Revelation series and it's spelled out
[12:07] very well in the church age book I
[12:09] believe it's chapter 2 in the patmas
[12:11] vision you'll find these things
[12:12] explicitly laid out and as I quote here
[12:14] for the next few moments I'll be quoting
[12:16] from those paragraphs but the white hair
[12:19] signifies that he's judge of all the
[12:21] Earth and he's been crowned with wisdom
[12:24] that the white hair is a crowning it's a
[12:26] it's a demonstration or an uh it exist
[12:29] ibits and presents that it's the crown
[12:31] of wisdom on one who has discernment and
[12:34] and judgment so he has he signifies that
[12:36] he's judge of all the Earth he's been
[12:38] crowned with wisdom brother bam said
[12:39] they saw the judge with his judgment
[12:41] girdle over his shoulders standing pure
[12:44] and holy full of wisdom fully qualified
[12:46] to judge the world in righteousness so
[12:48] that's what this hair white as wool
[12:50] represents and then these eyes as were
[12:53] flames of fire this is the eyes of the
[12:56] judge who repays those who reject him so
[12:58] when it expresses this flaming fire
[13:01] there is a judgment for those who reject
[13:03] him and he says there he stands as judge
[13:06] with flaming eyes to meet out judgment
[13:08] the day of Mercy is over now this is
[13:11] Brother Bram describing this in
[13:12] Revelations chapter
[13:13] 1 so immediately we start thinking whoa
[13:16] where's our chronology here but there's
[13:18] something to be expressed that is this
[13:20] one who is in the midst of the seven
[13:22] golden candlesticks which is Christ in
[13:24] the midst of his church through seven
[13:25] Church ages looking out over his church
[13:27] and caring for him there's this this
[13:29] image when John is caught up in the day
[13:31] of the Lord uh in the spirit of the
[13:33] Lord's day that he's seeing things that
[13:34] will be and this image convey something
[13:38] and so then there's almost this dropping
[13:39] back to hear about the church ages in
[13:41] Chapter 2 and chapter 3 to almost come
[13:44] back to four and five which is going to
[13:46] be given us a full understanding of why
[13:48] he stands here now as this one with eyes
[13:51] of fire and this white hair with this
[13:54] judgment that is going forth he had feed
[13:56] of brass which signifies divine Judgment
[14:00] of sin and I think maybe Lord willing
[14:02] will pick up on this next Wednesday how
[14:04] that Brazen serpent uh and there was
[14:06] judgment for unbelief and how this
[14:08] lifting up of this brass serpent uh
[14:10] symbolized Christ himself being offered
[14:12] for sin and so brass can even represent
[14:15] sin judged and that there's something in
[14:18] this judgment for sin that if we could
[14:19] be identified with it then our sins are
[14:22] vanquished then it has as the voice his
[14:25] voice was the sound of many Waters it's
[14:27] the sound of many Witness es of the
[14:30] Christ it is the gospel it is the
[14:32] testimony of Christ and these voices
[14:34] will rise up in judgment Against The
[14:36] Sinner who did not heed this voice of
[14:39] warning so there's when we see think of
[14:41] the voice of many Waters it's Messengers
[14:43] represented it's preachers of the Gospel
[14:44] it's a testimony of Christ and now his
[14:46] voice is now rep all these voices are
[14:49] represented there as a testimony that
[14:51] the gospel was preached and had been
[14:53] rejected and so it's a voice of judgment
[14:56] these voices will be there to condemn
[14:58] those goes in judgment then Seven Stars
[15:00] in his hand we know Revelations 1:20
[15:02] tells us the Seven Stars are the Angels
[15:04] of the seven churches and as brother bam
[15:07] writes about it these angels in his hand
[15:10] though they're Messengers to the church
[15:12] they represent examples of God's
[15:14] goodness or God's mercy and care to the
[15:17] body of Christ that how God was treating
[15:20] them in that age and how he used them
[15:22] it's it depicts every believer so all
[15:25] the candlesticks represents the me the
[15:27] messenger who is tapped into the Holy
[15:29] Spirit but brother says every believer
[15:31] is dramatically depicted there because
[15:33] we all must be tapped into that Holy
[15:35] Spirit and then the two-edged sword it's
[15:38] the word that judges the hearts it's the
[15:40] word that judges a man's works it's a
[15:41] word that judges a man's motives so it's
[15:44] not just external things but this
[15:46] two-edged sword it's that word of God
[15:48] Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is
[15:50] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[15:52] two-edge sword doing what piercing even
[15:55] to the dividedness under Soul and Spirit
[15:58] and the joints and arrow and is a
[15:59] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[16:01] the heart so this is what the word does
[16:03] is it doesn't just judge outwardly it
[16:05] judge in judges inwardly it's going to
[16:08] judge your works it's going to judge
[16:09] your motives it's going to judge your
[16:10] thoughts and the way the how a man's
[16:12] heart was set so this as a word which is
[16:15] a two-edged sword then as there was a
[16:17] streams of fire that are issuing forth
[16:20] before him and these Wills of burning
[16:22] fire we see these things now this fire
[16:24] before him his eyes is flame of fire
[16:27] feet is brass a voice of many water
[16:28] Waters and uh and out of his mouth went
[16:31] a sharp twitch sword there's a lot of
[16:33] connections with the word that
[16:35] judges and then he says his fa
[16:38] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[16:41] his
[16:41] strength this is connected with his
[16:44] coming to take his bride away in a
[16:45] Rapture this is connected with a a
[16:48] specific time when he's revealed himself
[16:49] and manifested himself his countenance
[16:52] was as the son shineth in his strength
[16:54] Matthew chap 17: 1 and 2 and after 6
[16:57] days Jesus Take taketh Peter James and
[17:00] John his brother and bringeth them up
[17:01] into a high mountain apart and was
[17:03] transfigured before them and his face
[17:06] did shine as the sun and his reignment
[17:09] was white as the light so here is this
[17:12] depiction of Christ at his
[17:14] Transfiguration where he is uh there
[17:16] it's an expression of the kingdom of God
[17:19] coming in power as there's going to be
[17:21] given dominion and glory and power and
[17:22] everlasting Dominion to the son of man
[17:25] that Christ at his Transfiguration
[17:27] wherein there was Moses that represent
[17:29] the sleeping Saints Elijah that
[17:30] represents the living Saints and there's
[17:33] this glorified Christ gathered together
[17:35] to this glorified Christ it's this image
[17:37] of him where his face shines as the sun
[17:40] in his reignment white as the
[17:43] light it's this look of the Ancient of
[17:46] Days whose garment was white as snow his
[17:48] hair like pure wool his throne like a
[17:51] flaming fire and fire issuing forth
[17:53] before
[17:54] him and now as we see these symbolisms
[17:59] and his face is as it were the
[18:01] Sun and we see this at his
[18:03] Transfiguration in Revelations 10: 1
[18:08] to3
[18:10] and I I do appreciate uh your
[18:13] attentiveness I love it that you're um
[18:16] you have an appetite for the word in
[18:18] teaching it makes one I enjoy a gift of
[18:21] teaching brother Jason dears has that uh
[18:23] Ministry of a Teaching Ministry and I
[18:26] just imagine if you're uh if if you're
[18:29] accustomed to other ways of speaking
[18:31] teaching maybe sometimes would get
[18:32] uncomfortable or dry but I just think
[18:34] it's so beautiful when the Holy Spirit
[18:36] could come and place things not me the
[18:38] Holy Spirit take things and place these
[18:40] things so thank you for being patient as
[18:42] I think these things are necessary to
[18:44] teach in Revelations 10: 1 2 and 3
[18:47] notice he says I saw another Mighty
[18:49] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[18:51] the cloud and the rainbow was upon his
[18:54] head and his face was as it were the Sun
[18:57] and his feet as pillars of Fire some of
[18:59] the same depictions as feet like fine
[19:01] brass and his hair like white wool white
[19:03] as snow and these things are describing
[19:06] a particular image and here we see the
[19:09] same face as it were the sun his feet is
[19:11] pillars of fire he's clothed with the
[19:13] cloud now these are tremendous images
[19:15] for us as Believers because Revelations
[19:17] chapter 10 is a message scripture
[19:20] brother brandom taught us that the
[19:21] seventh angels on Earth at the time of
[19:23] this coming and we all should be like
[19:25] whoa wait what right we should all kind
[19:28] of say all right I want to understand
[19:29] this I I want to have an understanding
[19:31] of these things and he says and he had
[19:33] in his hand a little book open now if we
[19:35] see the son of man coming to the father
[19:38] on the throne who has a book and this
[19:40] book is now open he opens this book and
[19:43] now we see Christ this Mighty angel with
[19:46] a book open and he had in his hand a
[19:48] little book and he opened and he set his
[19:49] right foot upon the sea and his left
[19:51] foot upon the on the earth and he cried
[19:53] with a loud voice as when a lion Roth
[19:57] and when he had cried seven Thunders
[19:59] uttered their voices when the lion roars
[20:01] who can but respond when this lion
[20:04] prophesies and and and he utters forth
[20:06] then these these seven Thunders utter
[20:07] their voices it's the same one here
[20:10] Christ in Revelations 1 it's the same
[20:12] one in Revelations 5 the line of the
[20:14] tribe of Judah and Daniel one Daniel 7
[20:17] these are all they have the same
[20:19] characteristics now if we were to say
[20:21] wait a minute wait a minute these are
[20:22] different times okay we won't argue that
[20:24] but you see the same characteristics of
[20:26] the same
[20:27] one I should tell us
[20:29] something brother brandham says this
[20:32] about this scene where we see this one
[20:34] like the son of man he said his service
[20:35] has been rendered Revelations 1 this is
[20:38] his conclusion the priesthood is over
[20:41] the days of the prophecy are finished he
[20:43] stands gerded as the
[20:47] judge Revelations 1 describes him in
[20:51] terms that should tell us it's
[20:53] judgment and so here in Revelations 10
[20:56] when he Roars as a lion it's because he
[20:58] is the the lion of the tribe of Judah he
[21:00] is the root of David and these and now
[21:04] as he's roaring as a lion he's standing
[21:06] there girded as a judge his white wool
[21:09] it speaks of supreme authority and judge
[21:11] all these things are are painting this
[21:13] picture the symbolic picture of
[21:15] something about his character at this
[21:18] time and these representations I believe
[21:20] are very important to reveal his purpose
[21:23] at that moment what he is his office at
[21:26] that moment and his
[21:29] character the Bible says that the line
[21:31] of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed and
[21:33] in this prevailing now this line of the
[21:35] tribe of Judah is going to cry out and
[21:37] Roars as a lion he has a purpose he has
[21:40] an office he has a character at this
[21:42] moment and this Lion of the tribe of
[21:44] Judah we can see in Genesis CH 49 veres
[21:48] 8 9 and 10 it says Judah now as this uh
[21:51] inheritance and blessing is being passed
[21:54] we've seen recently how that Reuben has
[21:55] been disinherited and this part of the
[21:57] Kingdom part of the inheritance is given
[21:59] to Judah Judah Thou Art he whom thy
[22:01] Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be
[22:04] in the neck of thine enemies thy
[22:06] father's children shall bow down before
[22:09] thee there's this expression now of
[22:13] dominion it's being expressed in Judah
[22:15] it says Judah is a lion's welp so here's
[22:17] the lion of the tribe of Judah and he's
[22:19] a lion's welp which kind of suggests
[22:22] this youthfulness but then it says from
[22:23] the prey my son Thou Art gone up so it's
[22:27] alluding to a Young Lion growing up into
[22:30] full strength growing up in full power
[22:33] there's this emblem of
[22:34] royalty emblem of a king from the prey
[22:38] my son Thou Art gone up he stooped down
[22:41] he couched as a lion and as an old lion
[22:43] from a lion's welp to an old lion who
[22:46] shall Rouse him up this lion who after
[22:49] he has conquered and after he has
[22:50] accomplished what he what he must he can
[22:52] now sit down he can now
[22:54] rest it says the scepter shall not
[22:57] depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from
[22:59] between his feet until Shiloh come and
[23:01] unto him shall the Gathering of the
[23:03] people be scepter signifies dominion and
[23:06] power and authority so here this royal
[23:09] king who's viewed the lion of the tribe
[23:12] of Judah speaks of the Messiah these
[23:13] prophecies it's kingly power kingly
[23:16] government we know that Christ is the
[23:18] lion of the tribe of Judah having
[23:20] conquered even sin and death he ascends
[23:23] up on high and sits down at the right
[23:25] hand of the Father in heaven and it's
[23:27] King Jesus which is Christ that goes now
[23:30] to the father to take the book of
[23:31] redemption and when he does it's the
[23:33] lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[23:35] prevailed to take the book and so the
[23:38] symbolism is pointing to a change that's
[23:41] taking place and when brother Brandon
[23:43] was looking at these events when he
[23:45] preaches Serv is this the time when he's
[23:46] preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ
[23:48] and even when he comes to the open of
[23:50] seals it's when he's looking at these
[23:51] things what does he saying is this the
[23:53] end and is Mercy
[23:56] over why because there's a a certain
[23:59] characterization of Christ in this
[24:00] moment and in this time which speaks of
[24:03] judgment the lion it's not uh a judgment
[24:07] of sin but now it's the Judgment of
[24:10] Sinners it's not paying the price and
[24:12] God's Wrath being satisfied in Christ
[24:14] but now it looks as if those who've
[24:16] rejected him are now going to be
[24:18] permanently
[24:19] judged so listen to these statements I
[24:21] know you're extremely familiar with them
[24:24] uh you're doing such a good job of just
[24:25] pulling me so quick I I'm realizing I
[24:29] uh might sell youself sell you guys
[24:30] short tonight and not preach very long
[24:33] or to some I might be doing you a huge
[24:34] favor I don't know but in the breach
[24:37] between the seven Church ages and the
[24:38] Seven Seals listen to what brother
[24:40] brandham says now I want to read this so
[24:42] that you can hear how brother bam
[24:44] describes it what he's looking at and my
[24:47] desire isn't to say well he says this
[24:49] yeah but I'm not wanting to put any
[24:51] interpretation of it other than just to
[24:53] say this is what he said and let's just
[24:56] accept it that there's something in what
[24:58] he's seeing that he's conveying to us
[25:00] that God can give us understanding of
[25:02] amen he says he leaves the throne uh to
[25:05] be an intercessor as a lamb he's saying
[25:06] that he's leaving this place of being an
[25:08] intercessor he leaves the throne to be a
[25:09] lion king to bring the world to judgment
[25:12] who has rejected his message so it's
[25:15] once there's a rejection there's nothing
[25:17] left but judgment so he says he's not a
[25:21] mediator this is interesting now um I
[25:25] was studying as a part of this in
[25:27] intercession and Med mediator and propit
[25:30] those things that relate to this Mercy
[25:32] or this office of him being a mediator
[25:34] being an intercessor and this place that
[25:35] he has during this particular time where
[25:37] he's interceding and he's mediating but
[25:39] now he's saying that's over so if you
[25:42] want to pray about those things and look
[25:43] into those things and read those
[25:45] different scriptures there's a lot there
[25:46] to consider so now he's not a mediator
[25:49] so here came the lamb now now and I'm
[25:51] skipping some things just wanting to
[25:53] describe this view he has of this lamb
[25:55] coming to him on the this Lion King
[25:57] coming to take the book so here came the
[25:59] lamb now his intercessory days were over
[26:01] the mediatorial days they say ah there
[26:04] was a time when he was a lamb and he was
[26:05] a mediator and he was an intercessor but
[26:07] he's saying these things are over he
[26:09] describes it this way in the breach he
[26:11] says the Elder called him and said a
[26:13] lion because he had been a lamb an
[26:15] intercessor a bloody lamb but now he's
[26:17] coming forth as a lion his days of
[26:20] intercession are over yes the there's
[26:22] this repetition gets in our minds that
[26:25] brother brandham isn't just stumbling
[26:26] over his words he's seeing an event
[26:28] scripture and he sees some change of
[26:31] office from this time where he's
[26:32] mediating interceding to now there's a
[26:35] lion and it's not that he's mediating or
[26:37] interceding but now he's doing something
[26:39] different he says and again just a
[26:42] little bit later and the lamb come forth
[26:43] now from being a mediator between God
[26:45] and man you know the scriptural
[26:47] references to that he becomes a lion
[26:49] when he becomes a lion he takes the
[26:51] books takes the book that's his rights
[26:54] he was taking his rats it was his time
[26:57] to take the book and is are his rights
[26:58] and he's claiming all uh that belong to
[27:01] him brother B says why is he taking the
[27:02] book why is he opening seals he wants to
[27:04] gather his
[27:05] subjects so the open of the book is
[27:08] gathering the third poll is absolutely
[27:10] for the lost and for the bride so
[27:13] there's things combined in this moment
[27:15] that are it's the most glorious
[27:17] beautiful day there's ever been because
[27:19] the word is open and it's drawing the
[27:21] bride to Christ but what about everyone
[27:24] else who's not drawn it's a terrible day
[27:26] A Dark Day so in the fourth seal some of
[27:29] the same instances and I'm just doing
[27:31] this chronologically he says while I
[27:33] believe with all my heart the seat's
[27:34] still open I believe he's still on the
[27:37] throne of God but soon he's going to
[27:40] rise now and come forth to claim what he
[27:42] has redeemed now the breach it's kind of
[27:45] anticipatory he's looking forward to the
[27:48] events that would be and he's looking at
[27:50] scripture he's looking at the symbolism
[27:52] he's drawing these conclusions of he's
[27:54] using the symbols to set the scene now
[27:57] as he's preached the fourth seal he says
[27:59] I believe that the throne he's still on
[28:01] the throne of God and that but he's
[28:02] going to rise and claim what he's
[28:04] redeemed he's doing the work of kinsman
[28:07] while Ruth is
[28:08] waiting but soon we know that Ruth after
[28:10] he had promised her I will not rest
[28:12] until or ex actually Naomi this says he
[28:14] will not restle he's performed what he's
[28:15] promised and as she is there conversing
[28:18] with Naomi Ruth is Boaz goes before the
[28:21] Elders of the city and he does this
[28:23] claiming of Ruth he wants Ruth and he he
[28:26] does this act of a Kinsman
[28:28] and he says but soon you know after boas
[28:30] had done the Kinsman work then he come
[28:32] and claimed his possessions that's
[28:34] exactly what the Bible said he done this
[28:37] is Christ now what he does in
[28:38] Revelations 5 he come forth and took the
[28:40] book then intercession is over he's off
[28:42] the throne there's no more Blood On The
[28:45] Mercy Seat then what is it judgment
[28:49] seat so where he had been once he moves
[28:53] from that what he's vacated it's it's
[28:56] not what it was before so I do think
[28:58] it's important to look at in the sense
[29:00] that he was in he was doing something
[29:03] and when it says the blood is now off of
[29:05] that it's that something's changed
[29:07] something's moved we have to use
[29:09] language and time and space to convey
[29:11] ideas because we exist in time and space
[29:14] and we use language to communicate now
[29:16] if we could all just be God we would see
[29:17] it for exactly what it is and we
[29:19] wouldn't even need to communicate it
[29:20] we'd just be
[29:23] like and church service would be like
[29:29] we would just all know perfectly but
[29:31] since we have to describe it there's
[29:32] something in there that we want the
[29:33] thoughts of God to be quickened to see
[29:34] it how he sees it he says so what is it
[29:37] now it's judgment
[29:39] seat and then in the fifth seal says
[29:41] this the very next evening I'm sure that
[29:43] you're the same he's praying so catch
[29:44] this I'm sure you're the very same Lord
[29:46] Jesus that made the atonement for us
[29:48] many years ago I think that's an
[29:49] important element you're the same that
[29:52] when it said the lion of the tribe of
[29:54] Judah hath prevailed brother Bram saying
[29:56] well he was a lamb and now he's a lion
[29:58] and it's this he's he's drawing us
[29:59] through this process where it's not like
[30:01] well I your your lawyer quit so now you
[30:05] have a new public defender and bad luck
[30:08] he's the judge and there's this weird
[30:10] rule where the one who should be
[30:12] representing you is now the one that's
[30:13] condemning you and sentence in you and
[30:14] it's not a different person in that way
[30:17] said I'm sure you're the very same Lord
[30:19] Jesus that made the atonement for us
[30:20] many years ago and by seeing those seals
[30:22] revealed and the great things that's
[30:23] taken place right here in the last few
[30:25] years I believe with all my heart that
[30:28] the door of Mercy is beginning to
[30:32] close just one night later if we go back
[30:36] to the 17th when he's preaching he says
[30:38] well soon this is going to happen and
[30:40] then he comes on the 21st he says soon
[30:42] he's going to rise I believe he's still
[30:44] on the throne but soon this is going to
[30:45] happen but soon but now he's saying I
[30:48] believe it is closing it's beginning to
[30:51] close and you're ready to take your
[30:52] journey now to redeem your
[30:55] people very next night on the in the six
[30:58] the hour is soon
[30:59] arriving and maybe yet this very
[31:03] night so he's not looking at in the same
[31:06] way that we might look in the scripture
[31:08] and read something that's symbolic and
[31:09] be like this is going to be a time when
[31:11] the son of man is judging and this is
[31:14] what it will be one day and this is the
[31:16] symbolisms but God is actually
[31:18] interpreting his word by bringing it to
[31:20] pass and brother bam sees things happen
[31:22] he says this is what will happen and now
[31:24] he's saying I believe it's already
[31:26] beginning to happen and now he says they
[31:28] arriving that there's an hour arriving I
[31:31] know I haven't finished the sentence but
[31:32] he says it may be this very night that
[31:34] God will completely turn from the
[31:36] Gentiles
[31:37] altogether now do you understand better
[31:41] okay I apologize that's maybe assuming
[31:42] that you didn't understand it as good as
[31:44] you do now before but on Sunday when we
[31:46] went through souls in prison now we make
[31:48] the connection that this is what brother
[31:50] Bam's thinking about when he preaches
[31:51] souls in prison now like when this
[31:53] happened I thought for sure we'd be gone
[31:57] but since we're still here maybe you've
[31:59] turned from the Gentiles altogether and
[32:02] the part of the third pull is a
[32:04] testimony and a witness to those who are
[32:06] going to be judged and can't be saved
[32:07] and that's why we're still here you pick
[32:09] up on that and this is why because he
[32:11] says I think it could happen tonight
[32:13] that you're not going to save anymore
[32:15] you're no longer going to deal with the
[32:16] Gentiles but you'll leave but later he
[32:18] says but maybe you've left the Gentile
[32:20] bride here to be a condemnation to all
[32:22] those who rejected you he said so they
[32:25] shall tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem
[32:27] until the Gentiles dispensation be
[32:28] finished the times are over and then let
[32:30] him that's filthy stay filthy let him
[32:32] that's righteous be righteous there's no
[32:34] more blood on the altar the sacrifice
[32:36] has been removed and there's nothing but
[32:38] smoke and lightning and judgment in
[32:40] there and that's just exactly what's
[32:42] poured out here
[32:43] tonight now you could look at this and
[32:45] say that this is what's poured out in
[32:47] the symbols of the sick seal that he's
[32:49] preaching but then you could also see
[32:51] where brother Bam's talking about the
[32:53] events under the six seal and he's
[32:55] talking about current events that are
[32:56] transpiring as as if to see that there's
[32:58] already been some temporary
[33:01] manifestation of those things under the
[33:03] Sixth Seal am already taking place in
[33:07] transpiring he said
[33:10] the that's exactly what's poured out
[33:12] tonight he said the our soon arriving
[33:14] that these things may happen he says it
[33:16] may be
[33:17] tonight the lamb has left his
[33:19] mediatorial work the mediatorial work
[33:21] has been finished from over on the
[33:23] throne and the sacrifice says we've
[33:24] typed him perfectly the kinsman redeemer
[33:26] the bloody lamb that come forth the lamb
[33:28] that had been slain a bloody one been
[33:30] killed bruised come forth and took the
[33:32] book out of his hands the days are
[33:34] finished now he's coming to claim what
[33:36] he has
[33:37] redeemed uh I I now to you as you read
[33:40] that as you hear that you could take
[33:41] that in the same way that John observes
[33:43] it in symbol in symbol
[33:45] form and that he comes to take the book
[33:48] and that there's going to be a day when
[33:49] he does and as you read this here you
[33:52] could take it to mean that brother
[33:53] brandham is saying that one day he will
[33:55] and when he does mediation is over time
[33:57] is finished he's come to
[34:02] claim
[34:04] and I would say that in these things you
[34:09] want God to reveal it to you you don't
[34:11] want to make any
[34:13] assumptions we don't want to just take
[34:15] something run run through the
[34:17] concordance or match words up and
[34:19] meanings and definitions and then just
[34:20] say I it every every place where it says
[34:23] that day we just say when brother man
[34:24] said that day is this day and then
[34:26] everywhere we find in the the scripture
[34:28] where it says that day we're like that
[34:29] was today and you're like well no I
[34:30] think that day was saying that day and
[34:33] and we can't just do that uh absolutely
[34:36] so there is a there's a risk at that
[34:38] even as a minister as you start to look
[34:40] at things that you could just start
[34:41] pulling every instance where you see
[34:42] clouds in the sun of man and say it all
[34:44] pertains to one but there's different
[34:46] times and dispensations of the same
[34:48] one and as he says this about these
[34:52] things I want you to consider them and
[34:54] think that if there's going to be a time
[34:56] when there's no more Blood On The Altar
[35:00] and the hour has arrived of this
[35:02] happening and as he sees the consequence
[35:05] of this happening and you see that
[35:07] several months later in November this
[35:09] year he's saying we're still here and
[35:13] his languages telling us that these
[35:15] things have
[35:16] happened but were not gone yeah so could
[35:20] it be that judgment is already pouring
[35:23] forth and people can't get saved right
[35:27] right because these events had happen
[35:29] and there's no more
[35:31] Mercy now he says in Christ is the
[35:33] mystery of God revealed which I would
[35:35] argue as a brother that this is the
[35:37] silence that is lifting off of that
[35:39] seventh seal and this is brother bradam
[35:41] just feeling that Liberty to say this is
[35:43] what's transpiring right now under the
[35:45] opening of this word he says now you see
[35:48] the seals I know there's so much I'm
[35:49] skipping over he says when he was in his
[35:51] mediatorial work back there redeeming
[35:54] but someday he comes forth to get his
[35:56] book this book that he's redeeming
[35:57] redeemed and all that's in this book
[35:59] would be him for that's the believer the
[36:02] words in the book and the word is
[36:06] him and you want to get your they them
[36:08] into
[36:09] Scruples she is
[36:16] him and brother brandom says this and
[36:18] Christ is the mystery God revealed
[36:20] continue he says now so there he says
[36:22] that when this moment happens he comes
[36:24] he takes the book he was redeeming back
[36:26] there he was doing the mediator work
[36:27] there but when he comes forward to take
[36:29] the book all that is in the book is him
[36:32] and and it's going to be this Union
[36:33] there's going to be this headship this
[36:34] preeminence in the most moment in this
[36:36] time he says now to the life in the body
[36:38] is ofended the Life coming to the body
[36:40] this Union taking place it's a
[36:42] Vindication that the Rapture is at hand
[36:45] when you see the headship and the body
[36:47] becoming one in the fullness of the
[36:49] measure of his manifestation it shows
[36:51] that the body is about ready to receive
[36:53] to the headship and he has begin to give
[36:55] life to his body the one that he has
[36:58] redeemed the mediatorial work is over
[37:02] he's bringing his life to the body in
[37:04] the Vindication for the Rapture
[37:06] amen quite a statement to say the
[37:10] mediatorial work is over when you look
[37:12] at it in that this is about four months
[37:14] after he has made these statements and
[37:16] the breach and the fourth seal the fifth
[37:17] Seal The Sixth Seal I'm just picking
[37:19] different places to use this and now
[37:21] four months later he's saying the
[37:23] mediator work is done he's bringing life
[37:24] to the body in Vindication of the
[37:26] Rapture and then you find four months
[37:28] later he's saying could it be could it
[37:31] be that the door is shut why is he
[37:34] saying that because of these things that
[37:36] he sees taking place in scripture
[37:38] because of these things that transpire
[37:40] under the word of opening of the word
[37:43] when the Seven Seals were opened and
[37:45] they are and all seven seals are open to
[37:49] them that can receive it something
[37:52] happens with mercy and
[37:54] judgment and the question is is there no
[37:57] more
[37:59] intercession is the mediat toil work
[38:01] over completely is there no more Mercy
[38:05] is there no more salvation and maybe
[38:08] some of you know people that are very
[38:10] fervent Believers in the message of the
[38:11] hour very fervent Believers in that God
[38:14] had Vindicated brother brandham to be a
[38:16] prophet he's the prophet of Malachi 4
[38:18] and that these very events have
[38:19] transpired and they hold very deeply in
[38:22] their hearts that in 1963 after brother
[38:24] Bon preached the seals nobody can be
[38:26] saved
[38:28] other words they've condemned even their
[38:29] own children in some cases themselves
[38:32] and they've kind of adopted this
[38:34] Theology of some nominal Christianity
[38:36] that says well you can't be the 144,000
[38:39] but maybe you can be there can you can
[38:41] get in another way and it's it's a
[38:44] perversion of of already perverted
[38:47] Doctrine and yet they believe the door
[38:49] has been shut and when they say when we
[38:52] say they believe the door has been shut
[38:54] they're not just inventing this but
[38:56] they're using these very things that
[38:58] brother brand said so I say God help us
[39:01] to understand who Christ is at this
[39:04] critical moment in scripture yes amen
[39:07] even to say that if in your heart you
[39:09] don't believe that he has taken the book
[39:11] in your heart you do not believe that
[39:13] the book is opened and he has come down
[39:14] fulfilling Revelations 10:1 if you
[39:16] believe there's yet other things to be
[39:18] fulfilled I do believe brother Brandon
[39:20] has connected these things to his
[39:22] ministry connected them to events that
[39:25] are transpiring while he was here on
[39:27] Earth and he was trying to convey to us
[39:29] something about it so that if you don't
[39:30] quite see these things have happened
[39:32] maybe you could still yet see who he is
[39:35] at this moment in
[39:39] scripture in Revelations 55 Behold The
[39:42] Lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[39:45] prevailed to take the book The Lion of
[39:49] the tribe of Judah one who is the son of
[39:52] man hair white as wool and his garments
[39:55] like white and the feet of brass all
[39:57] these images of
[39:59] judgment and so we take to heart this
[40:02] scene that as the lion of the tribe of
[40:04] Judah hath prevailed it says in verse
[40:05] six and I beheld so John is now looking
[40:09] he's told the king the judge the right
[40:12] righteous one the supreme authority to
[40:14] whom all judgment has now been committed
[40:16] to the Sun the day of Mercy is over all
[40:18] this judgment and in the midst of the
[40:20] throne and of the four beast and in the
[40:22] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[40:25] had been slain having seven horns and
[40:27] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[40:29] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[40:32] he
[40:34] came and took the book out of the right
[40:37] hand of him that sat upon the throne the
[40:40] significance of this symbolism in this
[40:42] event must not be
[40:44] understated the sublime act in scripture
[40:48] because John is told that the judge has
[40:51] prevailed to take the book and John
[40:53] looked to see the judge he looked to sup
[40:56] see the supreme authority he looked
[40:58] maybe to see him as he's described in
[41:00] Revelations 1 he looked to see him as a
[41:02] Daniel Psalm in Daniel 7 he looked to
[41:04] see him in this Vis of an angry judge
[41:08] but what he sees is a bloody
[41:12] lamb this bloody lamb is the one that's
[41:14] seen in Acts 17:56 and said behold I see
[41:18] the heavens opened and the son of man
[41:20] standing on the right hand of God where
[41:23] had Christ been where did he Ascend up
[41:25] he ascended up to the right hand of the
[41:27] Majesty on high as a bloody lamb as the
[41:29] one who laid down his life to be an
[41:31] intercessor to be a mediator Christ had
[41:34] ascended up to be what The Mercy Seat
[41:37] Paul even says he's been set forth to be
[41:39] a perpetuation which is the literally
[41:42] the word is The Mercy
[41:44] Seat and so now I want you to catch this
[41:47] image John says it's here don't don't
[41:49] cry
[41:50] John and and even who is
[41:53] Worthy is this pronouncement this this
[41:56] this calling p in Forth of the worthy
[41:58] one a summoning of the one who's
[42:00] ascended up to the right hand of the
[42:02] Majesty on high and the one who who has
[42:04] the rights the one who laid down his
[42:06] life this lamb who purchased Redemption
[42:09] is the same one who has the rights to
[42:10] claim
[42:12] it and now it says be weep not John
[42:15] Don't Cry Anymore the lion the judge the
[42:17] supreme authority the wigged one has
[42:19] prevailed to take the
[42:21] book and as he looks to see a
[42:24] king the son of man who had been at the
[42:26] right hand of the father this bloody
[42:27] lamb has now not changed his garments
[42:30] has now not necessarily changed his
[42:32] vises and put on a crown and cleaned
[42:35] himself up and looks all Royal but John
[42:37] looks and he sees a bloody lamb
[42:39] approaching the throne what is it that
[42:41] he sees he actually sees The Mercy Seat
[42:44] moving please catch this party he
[42:47] actually sees The Mercy Seat rising up
[42:50] here he was Christ The Mercy Seat as
[42:53] long as he was here The Mercy Seat was
[42:55] here he could intercede he can
[42:58] mediate he he had an office here but now
[43:01] when he gets up he's not so much
[43:04] vacating The Mercy Seat as much as
[43:06] Mercy's
[43:08] moving and now as The Mercy Seat Rises
[43:10] up he moves to the father and he takes
[43:13] the book amen and the lion of the tribe
[43:17] of Judah is still seen as the bleeding
[43:20] lamb so what is he he still The Mercy
[43:24] Seat the righteous judge the Supreme
[43:27] Authority is there now taking the book
[43:30] but what was he he was still has the
[43:33] character of a
[43:35] lamb
[43:37] sir and brother Bron makes this
[43:39] statement in the ark and we could find
[43:40] many instances where he says something
[43:42] very similar to this this one just
[43:44] struck me in a very special way last
[43:46] week he says and today men are stricken
[43:48] blind because they are rejecting God
[43:52] mercy and I didn't take time to listen
[43:55] to it but it struck me this way you
[43:56] could say today men are strick and blind
[43:58] because they're rejecting God
[44:00] Mercy but God
[44:03] Mercy I want you to think about this God
[44:06] is rich in Mercy amen amen the Ancient
[44:09] of Days Go in the scripture and
[44:12] find some of the essential attributes of
[44:14] God and you'll find that Mercy is so
[44:16] frequently attributed to God and God
[44:19] never changes his ways or changes his
[44:21] nature they reject God who is Mercy is
[44:24] what I'll put it that way that only
[44:26] leaves judgment
[44:27] left but God in his love and mercy has
[44:30] so appropriated a way that before Divine
[44:33] judgment ever strikes there is a way God
[44:37] makes a way of Escape for all those who
[44:39] desire to follow that way that's the
[44:42] mercies of him making a way of Escape so
[44:46] even when judgment is imminent even if a
[44:48] door begins to close God is still
[44:51] pointing out a
[44:53] way even if the time of judgment is
[44:55] coming God is still saying hey before
[44:57] it's completely over I want you to know
[44:59] there is a way before it's completely
[45:02] finished you can't say I didn't tell you
[45:06] amen and here is God's way his love and
[45:09] his mercy God who is
[45:10] Mercy will not send judgment before he
[45:14] has extended Mercy
[45:17] amen take some time over the next few
[45:20] weeks if we don't have time to get to it
[45:21] ourselves to mention this but notice how
[45:24] that after the seals are open notice the
[45:26] theme of judgment right in the sermons
[45:29] that brother Brandon preaches he could
[45:31] have never preached the indictment right
[45:34] and after he preaches the indictment he
[45:35] preaches the
[45:36] trial what is he showing us warning than
[45:40] judgment it goes to the whole process
[45:43] and it lays it all out this is the time
[45:46] that we're in we're in the time of an
[45:47] indictment and we're in the time of a
[45:49] trial we're in a time of a sentencing to
[45:51] go forth and now your mind is the
[45:54] jury you've got to make your decision
[45:57] not you want to reject the Ark in this
[45:59] hour you want to reject God's provided
[46:02] way and listen to this as he says and
[46:04] hear ye
[46:05] him and I want you to think about Christ
[46:08] this lamb this one God wanted to bless
[46:11] his children and he couldn't do it under
[46:14] the law neither could he under judgment
[46:17] and
[46:18] Justice now if we were to look at it as
[46:21] the law being judgment and the law being
[46:22] justice but even judgment and Justice is
[46:25] being these attributes of his eternal
[46:26] throne says God couldn't bless his
[46:28] children under the law he cannot bless
[46:30] us under Justice or judgment because if
[46:32] we get what we
[46:34] deserve he says but the only way he
[46:36] could do it was under the love of his
[46:38] son Christ Jesus and he brings us right
[46:41] to the adoption right to the
[46:43] Transfiguration this is my beloved Son
[46:45] in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him he
[46:47] says what is it all law is finished yes
[46:51] amen all the judgments are finished
[46:57] this special dispensation this time this
[46:59] hymn shining in the bright of his glory
[47:01] his face is it were the sun here's the
[47:03] Sun and he looks to be the lawgiver he
[47:06] looks to be the judge but in him all law
[47:08] is finished in him all judgment is
[47:10] finished this is my beloved Son hear you
[47:12] him all other things are done this is
[47:16] him amen so I want you to think that in
[47:20] him all things are
[47:22] finished and we can say at this moment
[47:24] when this happens when he begins to rise
[47:27] from this box he begins to rise from
[47:29] this place and Mercy's over as it was
[47:32] exhibited here and he takes his place
[47:34] before the father to take the book it's
[47:36] Christ in whom all judgment is
[47:40] finished yes sir in Christ who is the
[47:43] end of all these
[47:44] things and so what is John told in
[47:47] Revelations chap
[47:48] 10:8 this time of judgment his feet as
[47:52] pillars of fire his face as it were the
[47:54] sun this wigged Authority The Voice
[47:56] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[47:58] again and said go and take the little
[48:01] book which is open in the hand of the
[48:02] Angel which standeth upon the sea and
[48:04] upon the
[48:05] Earth go to
[48:07] him who is the
[48:10] judge for he is the bloody lamb in whom
[48:13] judgment is
[48:15] finished go to him who has the book
[48:18] because he is the bloody lamb wherein
[48:20] there is Mercy amen yes some may differ
[48:24] and disagree with how that I'm
[48:27] expressing it tonight that perhaps the
[48:29] day of Mercy is over in their own hearts
[48:32] and their own minds that there is no
[48:34] mercy so may express it this way that
[48:37] none of these events have actually
[48:39] happened there only been the symbols
[48:41] have been explained to us and described
[48:43] to us and one day it will actually
[48:45] happen in literal form and at that time
[48:47] these things will be absolutely
[48:52] true but I want it to express to you
[48:54] this way
[48:56] that where Christ is revealing
[49:00] himself he reveal he reveals himself in
[49:03] this time in scripture as the righteous
[49:05] judge and therefore you have to be in
[49:09] him yes amen because he's not here he's
[49:13] not here saying H
[49:15] well you know he's not here standing
[49:18] between but now he's gone to the father
[49:20] to get the sentence he gone to the
[49:22] father to get the get the judgment and
[49:25] so the only place you can find
[49:27] anymore is in him that's the only place
[49:32] there is
[49:33] Mercy let's stand and bow our heads
[49:37] Brothers you could come to your
[49:38] instruments our gracious heavenly father
[49:41] as we close this
[49:42] service having looked at these
[49:44] scriptures tonight and these statements
[49:46] that you've inspired your Prophet to
[49:49] share I believe that it would be natural
[49:53] as sincere Christians
[49:56] to wrestle with these things but not to
[49:59] twist them and rest them as Peter said
[50:02] people did of Paul's words but to try to
[50:05] place them and figure these things
[50:08] out and I pray father that you would
[50:10] give us an understanding that these
[50:12] things that were written in scripture
[50:14] were expressed
[50:16] symbolically and that Lord even brother
[50:18] brandom as a
[50:19] prophet would speak and prophesy and
[50:22] describe things that were still yet in
[50:24] symbolic
[50:25] form for things that are yet to be
[50:29] fulfilled and that you one day will
[50:31] fulfill your word and interpret it by
[50:33] bringing it to
[50:35] pass and then it will be understood that
[50:37] this is what was meant when he said
[50:41] this but father I pray but for those
[50:44] things which you have been bringing to
[50:46] pass or that have been brought to pass
[50:49] open our eyes that we may see you for
[50:51] who you
[50:53] are and Lord wouldn't it be wonderful
[50:57] for those that are lost and those that
[50:59] are groping in sin and living in air and
[51:04] not lining up with your word it would be
[51:06] wonderful for them if we were living in
[51:08] a day when there was just partial light
[51:10] and partial
[51:12] truth so there stood the lamb before the
[51:15] Throne of the father as a
[51:17] buffer making
[51:20] intercession being a
[51:25] mediator Lord
[51:28] it that role of your son is a unique
[51:31] office
[51:32] because when he died on the cross he
[51:34] purchased our Salvation once was Final
[51:38] and he entered in before heaven and
[51:39] presented himself as that Bloody
[51:40] sacrifice the
[51:43] atonement The Mercy
[51:47] Seat and that's what purchases our
[51:51] Salvation it's upon that basis Lord that
[51:53] we believe and our sins are forgiven
[51:57] but yet in your grace and as expressed
[51:59] in these sacrifices and these
[52:01] ministrations in the Old Testament he
[52:04] there yet stands there as a mediator as
[52:06] an
[52:08] intercessor but then the day comes when
[52:10] that one who is the bloody
[52:14] lamb fulfills scripture going to take
[52:17] possession the scene
[52:20] changes and Lord we could say could it
[52:22] be in that
[52:24] moment is the atonement no longer
[52:27] effective is there no more
[52:32] salvation is there no more
[52:34] excuse if there's no mercy what is there
[52:38] no mercy for
[52:40] anymore but Lord I see that you're still
[52:44] healing therefore the atonement is still
[52:46] in
[52:47] effect I see that you're still granting
[52:50] the fruit of the spirit and you're
[52:51] moving in ways that only you
[52:55] can you're Pro in yourself to be the
[52:57] same yesterday today and forever
[52:58] therefore I believe Lord that you have
[53:00] not taken your spirit off the Earth that
[53:03] the day of Grace is not completely over
[53:05] if the doors begin to close and your
[53:07] spirit is beginning to lift off the face
[53:09] of the Earth we could say that it has
[53:10] not completely shut yet amen so there
[53:14] must be some access to Mercy in this
[53:18] hour to your
[53:21] grace and Lord I pray that we would be
[53:24] as your children
[53:27] we would be full of mercy and
[53:30] merciful Lord that our
[53:35] response to the time that we're living
[53:38] in would be to live a life by Mercy and
[53:43] [Music]
[53:45] Truth doing good to all
[53:50] men and exhibiting a great
[53:54] grace in a time of trouble
[53:58] Lord may that be where we are today
[54:00] right now even in the shadow of recent
[54:03] events Lord may we commit ourselves to
[54:06] be lives lived by Mercy and
[54:11] truth that we could exhibit a great
[54:14] grace in a time of
[54:17] trouble Lord I pray that it would be you
[54:20] that opens eyes to see you in your word
[54:23] in your promised word for the hour that
[54:24] we're living in now and see you for who
[54:26] you
[54:27] [Music]
[54:29] are that you would drive away a fear and
[54:31] doubt Lord that we could believe all the
[54:34] more for our loved ones who are on the
[54:37] fringes Lord if there be any that have
[54:39] rejected you with their mouth and by
[54:41] their actions Lord we say God
[54:43] forbid Lord keep the door open for just
[54:46] another moment that there would be those
[54:48] who seem to have spit on this message
[54:50] that they would wake up and see
[54:52] themselves for what they are and come to
[54:54] the father asking for forgiveness and
[54:56] been restored
[54:58] amen Lord I do not cry out for your
[55:01] judgments I cry out for your mercy oh
[55:03] God and may our hearts understand better
[55:06] where we live
[55:08] today and may we be merciful oh father
[55:11] so have mercy on us oh God have mercy we
[55:15] love you we ask all this in the name of
[55:16] the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise
[55:20] the Lord
