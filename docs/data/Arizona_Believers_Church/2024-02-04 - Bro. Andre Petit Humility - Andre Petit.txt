other too often since that time but uh um while I was pastoring the church I invite him uh to preach for the Youth meetings and um yeah so I have been uh pastor ining the church for 17 years and uh it will be too long I just told a little bit to brother Aon but I failed to resign and it just happened two months before the earthquake they had in 2010 and it was a major earthquake and so two months before I resign as and I told the church from now on I want to go on the mission field by faith you know we were a small church we could not afford to have uh to minister paid andhow but you see it's like I just Dive by faith and um well the lord always provided and uh I was printing the message in French in Haiti but it became so difficult with all third world country and uh uh this strive you were burning tires and you know I saw so many things happen happening there and I have to stop but my brother Barry um couple years ago he told me about China to print a message in China and so um a brother helped me and we were able to print 10,000 uh s Church age book in French and so even this week he told me he said whenever you have need for Bible and uh crol or French he said let me know so uh well when we are in the will of God uh he take care of everything we don't have to worry and you know I have been in Haiti more than 7 times so times and I used to say I am a white Haitian so you know in Haiti you know the Haitian people they dance they worship and you know when I'm with them and there is no Canadian or American with me I let go a little bit but but when there is another American or Canadian I froze a little bit you see brother Bram said the Canadian starchy I don't know but I'm Haitian I'm a Canadian Haitian so yeah I enjoy so much to be amongst them but it become so dangerous was two months ago we had a land project it's long story I cannot go in that and um you know and we it's 900 ft long more than 300 and we have already mango trees avocados banana trees uh lemon and all kind of stuff even we had tilapia fish but now the te invaded the country I had the last trip I did this three years ago and now um two months ago close I want to create a foundation you know we invested a lot of time and money and we have artisian well we have a generator we have everything everything to have a wonderful project and all the benefit I want to create a foundation all the benefit will go to buy Bible and to uh sponsor Ministry and on and on but now we are invaded by Thief so uh my um the famous Thief that kidnapped uh 17 American couple years ago I think one or two years ago they they are my neighbors if you complain about bad neighbors think about me so um and uh two months ago the uh two guyss the um thieves they kill each other right five minute walking from its its outskirt of P of Prince and from there there there was a I have the video I will not show that there is 50 people dead P dead Corps and uh that's the story with Hai so uh anyhow um so uh you know the message I will think most of you and brother Brenham said in the fifth seal he said the very thing that church is watering that is the seed the seed of the word it's the very word that become alive and carry us to our unseen bridegroom so it's so important to feed on the word yes amen so important um there was I read the story in Arizona year years ago there was uh there were two uh two men they were gold prospector and they were searching for gold and so it's many years ago and they they were they built a little Shack you know in little cabins and they were uh wandering in desert and trying to find gold and U one of them has relative and so they were close to each other and they were buddies and and uh so it's happened that one day one of them died and his friend um uh told the family he said I bury him he died and if you want to come and have what he had in his uh Little Shack he said you are welcome to come and so they came and they went in the Little Shack and there were there was old furniture uh oil lamp with the kerosene we say and nothing of valuable and so they took whatever they want and so they were leaving and U so in their car and so he he approached them he said do you mind he said did you take everything you want yeah yeah yeah he said do you mind if I go and I um I take the rest of what there is in the house oh he said no problems just go and so he went and he pushed the table and there is a wood board he lifted up and there was gold in that he gather gold since 53 years and he had enough gold to build a palace and so he looked there was only one window he looked through the window and he was thinking hm If Only They knew him better that money will be their theirs right and I was thinking when I read that story in colossian chapter 2 it's it's written in Christ in whom are hide all the Treasure of wisdom and knowledge and now I address to you if you know him better better it will belongs to you everything you know when we know him better we we belong there is no word to say what we belongs to know him better um there is a little um there is a fact very fascinating about beasts uh the Queens lays eggs in the lay labors and the labors put them in a special alveolus and feed them three days with Royal jelly after those three days they feed them with regular honey and they become labor Beast you see three days like justification sanctification but they need couple others Queens so they select some regular eggs and feed them the same thing with Royal jelly But after those three days they continue on and feed them with this royal jelly till they became fully complete but with the special food their DNN change and they became become Queens you see just they were could be a regular uh labor beast but because they eat something special their DNA change and they become Queens if you eat the Queen's food yesen hey what are you you become the word you eat the word you become the word you are transformed my wife she find a caterpillar you know I was raised on the farms so you see I use a lot of stories whatever so and she knows that and my wife find a catapillar a big one and she um she put in a uh jar with grass and a little branch and uh so the catapiller was eating and after a day or two we look at the in this jar so the caterpillar disappear and she built a c cocon you know you have to understand what I mean not what I say cocon yeah sometime uh instead saying the massage I say the massage so I think the massage is a good massage too so um there is a sister she said she tried to practice me she brother Andre it's not massage it's massage message whatever and so and the cuong um the caterpillar uh once in a while was making a little move so I was oh it's still alive you know not often but some and one day outside of this cuck came a beautiful but butly I was thinking hey it's exactly the type our types we were something else and we decided to hide in Christ from this world you know we we change so we are not anymore in this world though we are living in this world we disappear and one of those day we will be a beautiful caterpillar and we'll take our wings to the Lord amen um for the kids you know I have a story for the kids how many kids here would like to have a story oh just one or two okay so we are all kids so um there was a little boy who was maybe 10 and he likes his grandpa like Manu H Manu you like your grandpa yeah he said yeah agree so he's right and so um his grandpa brought him to his Chalet close to a river and so uh just for a couple days and every morning the the papa the grandpa was reading his Bible and his little uh grandson uh likes to do the same and he has his little Bible and he was reading and one day he said Grandpa what is the need for me to read the Bible I understand about nothing and I forget about what I'm I I read and he said the grandpa has a lot of wisdom he said now he said um uh I want you to pick this basket it was a charcoal basket he said you take the basket and you go to the river right in front of the Chalet he said bring me water so the little lad of course he has a great respect for his grandpa and he took the basket and he ran to the water and when he came there was just a little bit of dropping water and he said Grandpa he said I cannot bring water he said you have to go faster so he went and he came back the same result and uh so finally he said said Grandpa he said I think it will be better if I use a bucket no he said no so go and another time so he went of course it was the same result now and the grandpa put the the basket on the table he said do you see a differ in the in the in the the basket so he look he said yeah he said now the basket is clean and he told him he said you see that's the same way with reading the word the word washed you the word washed you so you will remember that story H yeah I hope uh okay now we we are going toward our subject you know uh I like to relax myself before you know that's first time uh I'm preaching here um so when we approach God we have to have in our mind that he is the Creator and he is the owner of our house I attended the funeral in haii and um the pastor was saying he said now he said if you rent the house and the owner come and he said I want back my house you have to give me back the keys you give the keys because it doesn't belongs to you but when we we approach god with humility and said Lord You Are My Creator I don't belong to myself you could belong to yourself but it's better if you belongs to God and you realize it amen so today I want to speak on the title of my sermon is humility humility and humility hide the power of God we'll see that so if you don't mind to uh stand up and we're going to read I don't know if they have time to to place the scripture one Peter uh no I think I didn't give that scripture one Peter chapter 5 and verse five and six I'm going to drink a little bit likewise e younger yourself onto the Elder yeah all of you be subject one to another and be clot with humility for God resist the proud and give grace to the humble humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt You In Due Time In Due Time amen let us pray Heavenly Father father we approach your word this morning and we invite you to come and to change the water into wine for our lives we pray that uh we pray that you will be with us and anoy uh those um lips of clay and that it will be for your glory in Jesus name we pray amen you may sit I start with a quote of humble th s he said you know people want power and really that's very good and really don't know what power is see they don't really know what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worthy thinking and humble yourself before God and then you have got more power than the man that's from all over the building and makes a big lot of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself you see the worst enemy is not the devil it's to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ you see to humble yourself before him that's really power uh you all heard about Napoleon so Napoleon overcome the world it was a mighty uh con concurent I don't know the word but the thing is that he could not conquer himself he died drunk you see was Asia to to conquer the whole world but not himself so I like to uh give illustration once again for kids will be your turn um we all our worst enemy is our flesh you see the Bible say our flesh will not submit to the spirit and the spirit there is a conflict a constant conflict and that's what make us sometime a measurable life yeah but uh Sometimes some people they would like to be perfect in their flesh and uh and they work like works but you know we are saved by grace and even brother Brenham said he said I confess my sins every day more than one a day you know it's it's it's our battle this flesh you know but we are so thankful that the Lord Jesus was In the Flesh and he was tempted in in every matters but you see uh to be tempted is not sin right you have to know the difference so there was a little boy that he would like to have a dog and one day his dad find a little dog you see a puppy I don't know how you call that a little dog andhow was a a mix of between the wolf and and a dog so his D was thinking it will not matter if it's a dog you know like four legs and a tail that's okay and so uh but the little boy like it so much that he feed him in his own dish and he was sleeping with this little uh dog and you know and he teach him uh things to obey and this dog became a big dog it was a big a big a a big one and so one day um they forget to close the gates of the chicken yard and so this dog wolf or wolf dog when he saw that it just jumped and killed 40 chicken so when his dad saw that he was not very happy and he was thinking he said Son he said you will have to get away you get out of this this dog wolf dog he will never be a domestic dog no no no papa he because I I never teach him so is that b other chicken and U so the little boy started to um uh to teach him you know and so um he was thinking King he said okay so he teach him and to he was very obedient and so one day he went he opened the the the door of that place the gate and so his a big fellow came with him and as soon as he said the chicken he said no s and he sat down and he look at his master he said lay down and he did and so he waited and after he went back and the next day did the same thing sit down lay down be quiet and he left and he did that couple days and every time he was leaving one or two minutes outside of the place and so he was checking the dog and the dog lay on the ground and when he was calling him back come he was coming back and after so many days he told his daddy dad he said come to see that so his daddy came and he did the same thing come sit down lay down and he left so his dad was looking at that he said nothing happened so his dad was wow it's amazing so finally I ask you the question you don't have to answer but uh do you think that his nature changed that's good but the thing is the relation he had with his master was greater than the flesh desire you see that's the same thing with us you see our relation with our Master is greater than the flesh desire amen so one of the biggest gift of brother brenham's life was the capacity to heal completely himself to God's ways to be humble it's not to be sh that's good to have complex no to be humble is to have a modest opinion of your own person to be humble is not looking to for praise to popular or to be first but it's more looking for the less nuttiest places to be humble it's not lift yourself up in the eyes of others but more to look up to others you see we saw that in in brother brenham's life you know he was always saying oh you are you are the one I'm nothing you see a humble person is the the one that forget about himself and that rather put his attention on God and others yeah I remember years ago I was working in architecture's office and one morning we're speaking about humility and there was my next buddies and he started to say well he said I think I'm a humble he said if I um if I look at my life he said uh yeah he said um I'm quite humble man so I turn around and said hey I said that's the first time I ever heard a man bragging to be humble you see to be humble consists of evaluating ourself in our sinful nature in the light of the Holiness of God amen amen and and uh you know the Publican and the Pharisees and we're going to read it um it's Luke 18 were perfect and he spake this Parable unto certain which trust in themselves that they were righteous and despise others two men went up into the temple to pray the one the Pharisees and the other Publican the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I'm not as other men exort oners onjust Alit tourist or even at as this Publican I fast twice in a week I gave title of all that I possess and the Publican standing a far off would not lift up so much as his eyes onto heaven but smold upon his breath saying God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalt himself shall be Obe and he that humble himself shall be ex exalted so that's a scripture and the thing is that in every man here and woman there is a Pharisees and a publican yes yeah you see the Pharisees attitude dress in his own justice of well spread words despising the poor Publican standing closed of the altar walk out Condon rejected of God but remember the old woman um okay rejected of God but remember uh the story of brother Branham he went to a restaurant and there were police and men that play uh toomic machine that was forbidden and there was a old woman she looked like a prostitute and so brother Brenham was looking at them so he was like a Pharisees sure yeah even if he was a prophet you know and every man there is a Pharisees and a Publican and so you remember the story and so the Lord has to help him to [Music] to to showed him the truth the reality okay so Jesus said a man made a great supper send his servant to invite all and they all make excuse oh I brought um a piece of ground I must see it and others say I brought five yolk of oxen I go to prove them I just married I cannot go and the master onry go to the street and and and invite Lambs um people pour lambs and you know any kind of people and you see it's strange like we know that uh uh um brother Bram said the last pool will be for the unsafe people completely but a gift of love you know it's will be something that we don't know exactly how what will be but you see um I was reading a book of a man of God a century ago and the U there was a trump and he was smelling bad and was so dirty and he he came in the chur church and and he was a drunker and all kind of the worst sin and the church they threw him out and this man was a man of God so he he took him in and he start to to pray and fast and pray for him for days and finally So This Man became converted and became a wonderful man of God and he was married with with a woman he was not leaving with her but she was so um so dirty and they they they have to wash five six time in the water tub you know to to clean her and she was vulgar and full of bad Spirit but because they have a love and they they were able to uh to bring her to the lights you see and uh because this man has not a Pharisees attitude you know if you have this Pharisees attitude you will not go towards people you will not towards uh poor people on the street begging for money or drugs you say no we are message believer you see so you have a Pharisees and a Publican inside of you so my friend Oscar make it God bless you Oscar I met him a couple years ago I was in the desert and was doing some jogging and I saw he was painting a house outside of uh uh what's the name surprise and so I was doing some jogging came in the front of the house where I was singing he was in the front of the house and he said I have a message U from God for you I said really yeah stranger I said said I do have also a message of God for you anyhow so we cannot go through the the whole story but anyhow so I gave him um the supernatural books of brother Brenham the seal seven church and he believe that brother Brenham is a prophet of God any he's here this morning and he want to take his water baptism one day so uh that's a the the best ever decision you do in your life amen amen so now how is born humility humility is born when you are contemp the Holiness of God in comparison to your sinful human nature you see the vision of Isaiah chapter 6 The King's usza uh was a great influence to Isaiah the prophet but Isaiah has a need of a a greater revelation of how God is and I think we all need that too to to acknowledge how God is and he saw in Heavenly scene he saw the Lord sitting on Throne his train filled the temple and there were Holy Angel sarapin with wings flying and they were crying holy holy holy is the Lord and the post of the door move and he said wo to me I am a man of unclean lips dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for my eyes has seen the king and you know the story and an angel fly and came with the live call from The Altar and he laid it upon his mouth he said th sins is taken away and we all know that's a type of the sacrifice of Jesus and when you touch us it's clean Us Clean us so humility set us see our state of deprivation and the certain condemnation that we Merit our as Sinners humility should be the first characteristic of a Christian Life without humility there is no Christ amen that's right you see we saw that the publicans attitude brought God In Action we're going to see order when Daniel took saot and Ashes fasting and humiliating in confession of his sin this brought the angel Gabrielle on the scene when the Centurion had the sick servant asked Jesus for the healing of his servant he told him that he wasn't worthy that Jesus came under his roof but rather he would speak the word that brought God In Action you see humility and Faith when the Sho phenician woman asked Jesus to chase the demon out of her daughter and he answered her that it wasn't good to take the little children bread to throw it onto the little dogs that brought God In Action when Abraham pleaded with God to spare Sodom if he would find 50 just he humbled himself when he said here I dare speak to the Lord me who is nothing but Potter in hashes and God kept listening to his re request up to 10 that brought God In Action God God is attracted by humility right Isaiah chapter 62 verse two but to this man will I look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and tremble at my word Matthew chapter 53 said bless all the poor in spirit who have a humble Spirit who acknowledge their spiritual poverty for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven on the opposite God hate Pride right Proverbs 6 verse 16 and 17 these six things do the Lord hate yeah seven are in Abomination unto him a proud look is the first thing mentioned first Mansion proverb 18 8 sorry verse 13 pride and arrogancy do I hate so when the the King Herod uh showed before the people in Royal uh appearance and sat upon his throne and his spoke and he brag himself and the people standing there shout and the and and they say voice of God and not of man you see he was bragging himself so an angel right away Smite him because he gave not glory to God God and he was eaten of worms and died right on the spot Proverbs 16 verse5 everyone that is proud in his heart is an Abomination to the Lord that's a big word Abomination he shall not be unpunished you remember the story of Uzziah when he was strong the king of Israel and U his art was lifted up to his destruction uh he transgressed the law of and he sinned against the Lord and He took he he took the um he brought the burn incense in in the temple and and he burned it and the priest aaria there were 18 other uh uh sacrification and they tried to hand him no don't do that don't do that he did it anyhow and so right away um he was Smite and leprosy when in his head you see the scripture now even brother Brenham spoke about Ministry you know he said uh uh what we have to watch a Ministry and it's good for everyone um proud woman and money so in the book of the Prophet Daniel when the king neb I don't know how to pronounce that lifted his heart and became arogant he was cast down of his throne and became fool as an animal for seven years so that he will recognize that the Supreme God has dominion over men and that he gave it to whom he wants to after that God established him again when he recognize and we have all to recognize that God has Supremacy over us however his son Bazar even though he knew these things those things the prophet told him you didn't humble your hearts you lift yourself against the Lord you didn't glorify The God Who has your breath and all your ways in his hand and you took the vessel of his house feasted with concubines it was the Feast of Bazar and a hand appear on the wall and wrote many many take present numbered weight and divided and the same night Darius the Midian took over his kingdom why humility because God is the Creator and because he still move in his creation he still moving your lives amen you became a Christian you were baptized but don't give up and do say okay now I'm okay no you have to understand that he move he want to move on your life amen amen why God so hate Pride because Pride doesn't recognize the supremacy of God and you know we can say it's what's good for those people but what's about you yes she is responsible for the third of of the Angel Falls first of all satan Lucifer who was a protector shubin with the deploy Wings fell you heart lift him itself because of your beauty and you consider your will as the will of God you see we have the same proud Spirit today even amongst denomination they have a certain proud project or they want to do that they want to do that you see in this but they consider their will as the will of God that's a big mistake yes right that's the reason why we have to pray the prophet said don't pray before don't decide anything before praying right to make sure that you will be in the will of God and see and you said in your heart I will rise to Heaven I will lift my throne above the star of God I will be equal to the god most high but you were cast down into hers so here he is in Eden inviting Eve to eat of his tree you will be like God knowing good and evil his word carried hell's poison right destroying humility and the need to depend in on God Rebellion Pride these are El's and fluence trying to bring each of us down the first Adam took us in the arm of the tempter with the same pride of Independence and Rebellion you see if you are independent it's Pride the second Adam came to bring his power to live a life of humility of submission and dependence the greatest character of Christ if I ask you what was the greatest characteristic of Christ you have maybe something in mind was his humility Philippian 2 verse 5-9 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God brought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humble himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also had highly exalt him and give him a name which is above every name you see Christ is God humility dwelling in human nature Jesus was entirely submitted to the father in humility and this in his submission was total the son does nothing of his own he is not it is not me that do the works but the father in me I do nothing of my own my teaching is not from me I do not search for my own Glory I didn't come of my own but him who sent me the word that I tell you I don't say them by my own I always do what is pleasing to the father you see when I sometime you hear people oh we have to be more power we have to be more healing we have to to have more uh gift and whatever hey start to be humble and it will come to you yes brother Bram said never search for gifts or Supernatural if you humble yourself amen you see Jesus he said I do nothing by my own are you over Jesus you see he said he didn't have his own will but he wanted God's be the all in all he has forsaken his will completely so that God will be all in in him it teach us where through humility take its rise and find his stren in the knowledge that is God work all in all yes and that our place is to yield to him in perfect resignation and dependence Amen in full consent to be and to do nothing of ourself amen Jesus gave a teaching he said take my yoke upon you and learn of me we want to learn of him right learn of me for I am meek and lonely in heart and ye F shall find rest unto your souls yes amen we want to learn that Lord humility is the secret of divine rest yes wow you see and our example is the humility of Christ humility is the mark of divinity the more you humble the closer to God you are you see you you become just a big nothing you don't have to defend yourself you don't have to prove nothing you just stay humble and you give glory to God you see I was in Haiti a couple years ago and after the Matthew hurricane that stroke the south of the island everything was destroyed it looked like atomic bomb you know it was so terrible and there was um I rent to the little pickup truck and because there were so many tees we were four five uh five brothers together so I loaded this little pickup truck with rice oil and nled salt and money so I brought some money and so and there were teas on the road sometime they were attacking people to get whatsoever they were bringing to help and so we prayed and so we uh we arrive in the South and uh to get to a place called ciron um um other places that I didn't called we have to cross a river so uh we arrive in the front of the river but the river has no Bridge so we saw a car half in the water and people pushing the cars try to but we're thinking where to go suddenly two guys start running ahead of us and they were running hey we we just followed them it was just this I and when we arrive in the South we give oil and whatsoever we have help with some people and one placees they showed me he said here it was the church I said where was the church you know the wind vanished you could not see anything that's where the church was it was terrible and so after couple hours we went back because we need a place to stay to sleep and uh we came to that River but now the the level of the river was this high oh I said wow and we saw uh it was already dark and we saw two guys the other side they they tried to cross the river and one disappeared in the water there was current and so the other one took him disappear again they were fighting we were we were looking they were drowned but finally I don't know but they were able to make it so they cross and uh so we look at the scene and the brother they said what are we going to do I said I know what to do so they look at me I said get out of this pickup truck they did we went behind on the side the river was here and I said this very easy when you don't know what to do you pray yeah sometime people you know they they scratch their head and this search for solution but they forget to pray so I said I guess because I had the I am the one who get the inspiration well I guess I should pray so I start to pray I said Heavenly Father Here we are and we don't know what to do and I don't want to know what to do but please lead us in the name of the Lord Jesus yeah and when I look at them at them I said you know what I feel good there is a song in h they saying I feel good good good I don't I didn't and start dancing [Music] but you know I should show you some video in Hai you would say hey they know how to worship and you know I said uh well I said I feel really relaxed but I don't have any problems you see I give you an example suppose a man has a little girl and she's coming from school and she come to her dad she said Papa that's French English too she say papa I have so much problem at school a little girl pushed to me and she pull my hair my hair not my ha my hair it's better why she can do the b in and and uh if the father say hey you know what you don't know what kind of day I had I had problems over my head so you have your problem I have my problem keep your problem I keep my problems no it doesn't work that way because the problem of your kids is your problems so now I teach that I baptize a young man from Venezuela and Dominican Republic he live there now I baptize him and I teach him since three four years we are in touch and I BL Spanish so much Spanish amig I I learned a lot of Spanish but I teach him I said dingon you don't have problems and I explained why because you are the son of your father and you have a right to say papa yeah you have a problem yeah your son is sick your son has no money that's not my problem you are my dad you are my father you promised to take care of me so you get rid of your problem and you start praising your father you said you have unlimited power I will be submit to you so father that's your problems yes you see that's exactly the scripture in other word so where I was now yeah okay uh Jesus gave a lesson to his disciple who asked who is the greatest in the Kingdom om so he plays a little child whosoever therefore shall humble himself at this little child the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven when Jesus Took the last supper with his disciple they were discussing to know who was the greater amongst them after three years of teaching they were slow and he gave them an example by washing their feet and he said if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them you see washing the feet it's not like we we know there is three ordinance uh foot washing communion and baptism okay I agree yes but if you go behind that and you see they were discussing who is the greatest one and Jesus humbled himself and he gave them a lesson he said be a servant of all and you know to wash the feet was the lowest job you can do he give an example he say happy will you be when you will do it you say happy you will be when you will do it to toward your brothers and sisters amen okay uh one more time happiness depend on humility he said receive my instruction for I am meek and lowly humble in heart and you shall find rest unto your soul humility and rest there is a big Link in that because where you when you are humble could you imagine a life where you have nothing to prove to defend yourself uh to compare with others and you know even the prophets was saying he said if you don't agree with me take it as in your and that does that knows no better you see when you you humble yourself nothing to prove and and even brother brah said a Christian will guil will plad guilt if even is not that because that's humility a new Joy will be found if you give your life as a servant and slave of God by being servant to one and another that's what Christianity is you just you don't just come to church on Sunday and say God bless you if you know there is somebody that is a need you see happy will you be if you put put in it into practice amen and Jesus said there is more joy to give than to receive now there is a scripture to find if really you possess humility in John chap 4 verse 20 said if a man say I love God and hate his brother he is a liar for he that lovees not his brother whom he s seen he had seen how can he love God whom he had not seen you see it's the same thing with humility it's easy to think that we humble ourself before God but our attitude of humility before men's is the only proof that your humility before God is genuine Paul to the Roman there is many scripture but I just take a he he said our chapter Roman chapter 12: 10 be kindly affection one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another Roman 1216 mind not high thing but con then send to Men of flow estate be not wise in your own conceit Paul to the galatian chapter 5 verse 26 let us not be deservers of vain Glory provoking one another anding one another amen Paul to the Ephesian he said with all loness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love humility and faith in John 5:44 Jesus said how can ye believe which receive honor one of another and seek not the honor that come from God Only You See say how could you have faith how could you believe when you want to receive honor or be acknowledged you see it's like a man system you see honor to be praised they want to honor you know like denomination or you know it could be among us you know how could you believe when you receive honor of each other and not um but seek not the honor that come from God only that's the reason Jesus said when you give give um hide what you give when you pray close the door that nobody will see you you know it was always the same way faith is the confession our inability and do be known and do and to abandon ourself and wait of God's works you know I like it because it's simple yes amen you know you can apply it right now today humility is simply the state of the soul that prepare us to live by faith the Apostle Paul and the revelation of the power of God he received he was a great man every eyes were suspended at his lips when he was preaching oh aul Apollos was great man Peter oh he was with Jesus but Paul oh oh as such a revelation Paul was human and all this honor affected him probably he was probably struggling with Fame with proud and he was searching humility and in the second Corinthians 12:7 he said unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the Revelation there was given to me a torn In the Flesh the messenger of Satan to buff above me lest I should be exalted above meure Paul prayed three times that it might depart from him you see uh it could be a kind of infirmity maybe his eyes or he was ugly we don't know exactly sorry I don't know because on the scripture right and the Lord told him my grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in weakness in humility most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my infirmity that the power of Christ May rest upon me and after Paul took pleasure in infirmity reproach uh in necessity in persecution and distress for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong amen amen yeah I'm I'm approaching the end um okay a quote from the message you see uh perfect strength by Perfect weakness he said I hope you that get down um deep to us both here in the tape world too that you realize that you have got to become nothing not to know it all not to Great somebody but a nobody so when they ask you your name you say your first name and last name is nobody so you become nobody you got to come dust yes you've got to get to a place that you know that you are nothing and don't never arise above it for as soon as you rise above it you arise above God you've got to keep yourself in the dust and on the road of the Damascus you've got to keep yourself off you your high horse and that's for everywhere here and in the tape World another quote on humble thel you see sometime well that's good to preach from the seal and the Seven Church age book that's wonderful but you know he preached humbl thyself after the seal wasn't 63 he said you show me a church that is is humble really humble not arrogancy a church just a sweet Humble Church I show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it that's right that's the thing it takes humility humble yourself before God letting God just work through US amen above everything love God and love one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless us and it's hard telling what he will do hey amen amen um there was a a beautiful Village in Australian mountains where a old man was hired many years ago by a young town counil to clear away the debris from the water pools up in the m cises that fed the lovely spring flowing through their town with faithful silence regularity Patrol the hills remove the leaves branches and other matter that could spoil the water The Village became a popular attraction for the vacationers the musician can could come the musician could come graceful swans floated along the crystal clear water various business took place the view from restaurant was beyond description year passed and one day the town Cil meet for administration meetings they reviewed
