TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'd appreciate your help this evening as we Minister and continue on the subject of our future home and it's always such a wonderful privilege to be able to minister to you and I know you'll do a tremendous job in just getting behind me and kind of pushing me through this got a lot on my heart I like to share but a lot of it's review and maybe I overthink it a little bit uh in doing that that it might weary some but just if you could just stick with me here at the outset I want to cover a few things from Sunday morning and just go a step further in the um the subject of our future home again remember that we're looking at Redemption as a subject in this uh that's such a pervasive powerful subject throughout the entire scripture uh God's plan in the beginning was a Plan of Redemption and what's remarkable about that plan is he knew that through a process in Plan of Redemption he could display every single one of his attributes and so that's the reason why God has this process of redemption this Plan of Redemption in the scripture so that he can make himself known and he knowing all things uh in his great wisdom saw that through Redemption he could declare himself and so as we review some from Sunday going to pick up we're kind of right in the middle of the service on Sunday morning we mentioned how the in the sermon the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride that brother B outlines God's Plan of Redemption for the bride and the world and he kind of runs them in parallel and he's he's showing how that what God does to the individual or what he's done for the bride to redeem us he is also going to do to the Earth and what we're wanting to express in that and I think kind of where we ended on Sunday and I want this to be very pronounced in your thoughts tonight is that when we look to the new Heaven and new earth in the end we see it's perfect absolutely perfect through God's process of redemption here it is in all its glory and Splendor and beauty and majesty and brother brandom is saying that's what God's going to do to the Earth and what he's saying is and that's what God has already done for you and so in that it's kind of a paradigm sh to go wait what huh oh and instead of us kind of putting things off way down the future in terms of what God's going to do we realize man there's something embodied in me and I'm manifesting something now as his bride that is the first revelation and the first Peak at what his future home is going to be like Revelations 21: 1-3 John says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth and the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away there was no more sea so that process of the earth passing away uh brings forth a a new Heaven and new earth and there's no more sea and this is a renewed Earth this is a renovated Earth it's trans a transformed world the world was in a condition it goes through birth pains and it it's delivered as a changed Earth it's born a new and so our future home will be a redeemed world so when the Bible says new Heaven and new earth it's this is a redeemed heaven and a redeemed Earth as we read in second Peter chapter 3 it's saying that the it's telling us how this is going to happen this is what brother Brown kind of highlight in future home how that Peter tell John tells us it's new Peter tells us how he gets there and he's pointing to it's this fire baptism that changes it from one state to another and it's not all dissolved and completely disappears and God creates a new one but something through that transforming power renders it new renders it redeemed is how I think is a great way of looking at it so Peter is telling us how God achieves the new Heaven and a new Earth through that fiery baptism that dissolving of atmospheres and elements and everything that's made up of mankind sister Elizabeth and I were fellowshipping on it this week and is even there was just something and we're talking about I said even all those satellites and all those web telescopes have been launched out into the atmospheres something's got to catch up with it and dissolve it something's got to something's got to burn it all up and I even thought of what you sent me brother Lucas how the all the God just has to shift one planet and all a sudden things can start happening moving around and taking care of a lot of things out there uh to achieve this renovation and this renewal of the earth so now with the new Heaven and new earth and the first heaven and first Earth passed away that is to change from one state to another he says in in verse two and I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride for a husband I I feel that you could preach endlessly on Revelations 21 all these things that are being represented now New Jerusalem is represented as a then when he sees the bride she's represented the New Jerusalem so all these types and shadows and all these descriptions and everything you could preach on endlessly but this New Jerusalem is going to come down out of Heaven A as it's described as coming down out of Heaven I know that causes us to think in certain directions and projections but the Earth is going to break up and it's going to open up and things going to be changed and dissolved and it's going to be the New Jerusalem that comes and settles upon the Earth it's that new uh the new city and he says and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold because this is the holy city settling On A Renewed Earth the Tabernacle of God is with men brother R talks about how now God is resident his residence now is permanently on Earth God is resonant with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people God himself shall be with them and be their God now if that sounds like a language he used of Israel if it sounds like a language he used of the Gentiles that's all true but now there's a permanence to it now there's not a natural uh the typing the spiritual now everything's just kind of Blends together and God is now permanently dwelling upon the face of the Earth in his Bri in his son and through his bride that this is the representation of God for all eternity there's no more dispensations there's no more coming of this there's no more changing of that there's no more sin there's no more sorrow there's no more Interruption there's no more Cycles the Tabernacle of God is not in a seventh Dimension he's way up there real high and we kind of pray to a god who's in heaven no now it is resonant with man where man is is where God is and it's all been fused together and this is that Eternal eighth day that we are Longing To Go to and so the Earth that we're living on now is going to be changed God will come and dwell in his son in his bride and manifest himself for eternity on this Earth that's our future home and I'm wanting that to have some impact some punch we think about it in the sermon things that are to be and I think this sermon here captures so much of this and uh my wife has been listening to the sermon birth pains it captured so captures so much of this and I do not think that heaven is a place that my mothers used to tell my mother used to tell me about I believe that the church has grown from that to think it used to be 100 years or two I think the oldtimers used to think that everyone that died went up to heaven had a heart and sat there on the clouds and played a heart well I wasn't raised in that time I do receiv receiving do remember seeing cartoons that when the cat or dog would die they'd Sprout Wings they'd play a harp and they they kind of float around in the cloud and so that that perhaps was a thought at one time having been raised in the message and having by God's grace believing parents I wasn't taught that kind of heaven but here brother brandom says that there was this time when that's just kind of what you thought heaven was were kind of spooky I think is how brother B talked about it how weird it would be he says now they knew that there was a place called heaven but if that be so all the musicians have it on us and the musician said all the heart players would have it on us we've even got one says but isn't that a kind of place it isn't that kind of place it isn't playing Harps at all and no offense to The Harp players he says I don't I believe don't believe the Bible teaches that but that was a conception I think this just has so much weight to it it was kind of drawing me off sides a little bit and I wanted to work out of Revelations 5 for a while he says but that was a conception that they had before the fullness of the word come into existence or the open of the Seven Seals so the open of the Seven Seals is the full word coming to an existence so now that full word being born in manifestation of the open of seals tells us it's a different dispensation that has been it's the fullness of the word says at the open of the seals that's promised to us in this age that we then understand so we had prior conceptions but now that the full word is made manifest it changes our prior conceptions and now that the seals are open we understand that heaven is not a place with clouds and harps he said I believe that heaven is a real place just the same as this is a real place for God started us in our spiritual growth in this place C catching kind of those building blocks and I believe that heaven is a place just as real as this where we don't set up there for eternity and just sit there on a cloud we don't just strum our heart for all the all from here ever for for all from here ever but we're going to a real place where we're going to do things I love the ambiguity of that we're going to go to a real place we're going to do things and he says where we're going to live and then gets a little bit more specific and I know some of us might cringe having left work in a hurry to get here he says we're going to work we're going to enjoy we're going to live we're going to life to real life to real eternal life we're going to a heaven of paradise now this is something when he says this that we're going to a place we're going to do things we're going to live we're going to work we're going to enjoy we're going to live we're going to have life eternal I believe what he's trying to get us to conceptualize is life here is a shadow of life is what life is going to be like over there that there are certain elements of this life that we don't like and there drudgery and there's things that are perverted and man wasn't meant to live that way but yet in the way that we're living now there's some shadow of the Eternal God when he made man in the very beginning he made him to till the soil he made man to have dominion over the Earth and name the animals and till the ground and rearrange things and have dominion So Adam had a job to do in the beginning he was working in the Garden of Eden but yet it wasn't a toil it wasn't a strain it's the curse of Genesis 3:19 that brought the strain and the toil on Adam and so we're going to a real place and he says much like this place and I realize that this concept of heaven and Eternity can be a real stubborn idea in our heads where it's just this this division of well we're living here and I don't want to go to hell I want to go to heaven and we've broken up into these three places you're living here now you're either going to go to hell you're going to go to heaven I know I keep repeating this but I want us to know that where we're living now though we may depart for a season we're coming back for a millennium and though we may depart for a season it's going to be completely renovated and we're coming right back to this earth we're going to live and reain here forever and he says just like Adam and Eve worked and lived and eat and enjoyed in the Garden of Eden before sin came in we're on our road right back there again right right back that's Redemption what was represented in Creation in the beginning all these great seeds that were swn in Genesis what Adam and and the woman were portraying it was just a quick glimpse of what could be but God said knew that if they remained here in this Perfection forever I would always remain a mystery so they have to fall and there has to be a Plan of Redemption so that you can know fully who I am but I'm not going to abandon the image that I expressed in Genesis 1:2 I'll bring that back up again in redemption in its perfect picture remember it began with the garden it ends with the city and that city is representative of the full seeds of everything that was in that Garden manifest in its Perfection says we're going to come right back the first Adam through sin took us out the second Adam through righteousness brings us back in again justifies us and brings us back in so there's Redemption through Jesus Christ now brother bradam and brother John this is where I'm skipping a little bit to not this next quote from future home but after the Romans 8 the next scripture he says or the next quote God already took up his abode potentially as it said that the Tabernacle of God is with men God will be resonant with men time time is completely done away with so all that we exist in is a dimension of Eternity and God is dwelling there now with his redeemed creatures his redeemed creation and even those who participated in it uh at the Judgment of white throne and God is uh that's going to be his dwelling place then but he says God already took up his AB Bo potentially says the kingdom of God is in the earth now in the hearts of his Saints says it's his attributes that he began in the beginning so the kingdom the the future home is now already in his Saints God already took his AB Bo potentially in the earth now in his children in his bride it's his his bride is his attributes from the beginning now his attributes are redeemed what what is he waiting what's the hold up what's what is he waiting for to redeem the Earth so you are already your soul is already a redeemed attribute of God and the very thing that kind of the next stage in this he's looking at is the Redemption of the earth to set his attributes on it so why hasn't God just come and fully dwelt in the Earth all over the face of the Earth why hasn't the coming of the Lord happened like everybody thinks it's going to happen with a 900 foot Jesus and airplanes crashing and angels with their backos and picks and shovels opening up graves because that's not the way God does it he won't step foot on the earth is in that Corporal body of Jesus Christ that physical body he had in the days of his first coming until the Millennium and that's his third coming and that's the one most people are looking for and that's why they miss his revealing in this hour so he says that his attributes will be redeemed why is he waiting what's the hold up of him taking his full Abode to redeem the Earth to set his attributes on it to fill exactly his predestinated plan so there has to be a process wherein God renovates the Earth so that he can set his full attributes on it to fulfill his predestinated plan so brother B this is a statement I think is so critical says now compare what we see with our own eyes what God has done to redeem his world compare what we've seen with our own eyes and what God does to redeem his world he's done the same plan to redeem his people now what what are those eyes we're talking about look at what he's done for you look what he's done for you look compare what we see with their own eyes I I'm using it that way if it doesn't strike you that way I'm using it that way look what he's done for you the plan he does to redeem his people he's going to do to redeem his world to me this is a crucial point that we got to catch this parallel what he does to redeem the person the individual his bride is what he does to redeem the world look at what he's done for you Romans chapter 8: 19-22 we read this before he says for the earnest expectation of the creature think of creation Heaven and Earth all that has created as waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature Heaven and Earth cre all the creation animal life all animal kingdoms and plant life were made subject to vanity not of their own accord not willingly but by reason of him who have subjected the same in hope God having allowed the bondage in hope that what because the creature itself shall also be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God I I think that's a heavy phrase that's a that's real uh you might only be able to deadlift that spiritually it's so heavy he says he shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God he says for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now what are they growing in travailing for what are they in birth pains for what are they what are they what are are they longing for to be released from their bondage he says to be delivered from the bondage of corruption and so when Peter writes that the Heaven and Earth are going to be fire shall dissolve the the Heaven and the Earth that dissolving is loosed in the New Testament it's loosed in the Greek so the Earth is going to be loosed fire is going to loose it from the bands that bind it fire is going to destroy the man-made ideas of the spirits and everything that's contaminated it's going to be loosed from the bondage of corruption going to be delivered from the bondage of corruption the fire baptism that's going to come upon the Heaven and the Earth is going to dissolve everything that holds it into bondage and when it's loosed from that it's going to be set completely free and it's groaning for that it's travailing for that now as we think about this that what the God is going to do to the Earth and loose it from bondage the Earth is going to be delivered from bondage it says the bondage of corruption into Liberty now the plan what we see with our own eyes God has done to redeem his world he's done the same plan to redeem his people so if the Earth is going to by fire baptism be loosed from the bondage of corruption be loosed from H all slavery and all corruption then we likewise have been loosed amen we've been delivered now Galatians chap 5 verse1 Paul writes this he says Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty where with Christ hath made us free amen remember the language he hath made us Kings and Priests hath passed from death into life let's Stand Fast be secure uh be be sure be certain and and and no no that the Liberty this loosening this Freedom this you're no longer under the Dominion and the power and control of certain things where with Christ hath made us free he says and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage this is this is a language that would just cause a a Hebrew to LEAP as it would as it would hearken them back to the law of redemption Leviticus 25 and he's saying as if anyone had been sold if anyone had lost their possessions if anyone had become a slave they would know there's some time period that they'd have to be the in the servitude and there'd be some time they weren't their own person but there would come a time when they would be loosed from that and so he's using a language of redemption and he said that there's a once you've been made free don't make the choice to go back and have your ear boor through and and say I'm going to be an indentured servant all my life I'm going to refuse the opportunity of Liberty I'm going to refuse the opportunity of the Jubilee I'm going to refuse the opportunity to Redemption I want to remain here A Slave he's saying if Christ has made you free then you are free he said therefore stand in this Liberty don't languish in it don't just survive but thrive in this Liberty whereas Christ has made us free you have been made free I just feel the services that brother Matthew preached just fit so perfectly with this even though I haven't even finished them I'm just about done with the first one and there's a theme of redemption and if God before us who can be against us and we ought to realize that and step into that and embrace that and know that God's not going to quit or give up and maybe we're just kind of languishing we're being lazy and God saying stand up in this Liberty because Christ hath made us free right if something has sounded and we've been delivered these prior conceptions but now the full word's been Bor into manifestation don't go back to that vomit so he said be not in Tangled again with the Yoke of bondage that that's quite a quite a statement I guess the kind of the word picture I see now is Christ has made you free the shackles are off of you and now he's want you to enjoy your Liberty and you just go back and you say I never never mind I'm going to just go ahead and put the Yoke on and you do it yourself now Leviticus 25: 8-13 I I just want to read through this because I think this will just uh stir up a lot that's in your hearts and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven time seven years this is the law of redemption if one has been bought or sold into slavery if one has been found uh to be you to have lost their their Liberty their freedom says in the space of seven Sabbath shall be unto thee 49 409 years verse n then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land just think of what this uh just how beautiful this Year of Jubilee is and ye shall Hollow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof so the trumpet calls them to an the the Feast of atonement in the 50th year and it proclaims a jubilee and and and we know that the message of the hour calls us to the genuine atonement back to Christ the word so there's this parallel there we see even in the day of Pentecost to the to the Jews on the day of Pentecost uh uh that that there is a that God established his kingdom in the flesh in in on the earth and his people through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so there's all these different types and shadows that we see now in this end time God through the the the message of the hour there's a trumpet call us back to the Feast of atonement and he says that it shall be a jubilee unto thee and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family that's Redemption if any man's lost his possession give it back to him if any man's lost his Strang from his family separated from his family give it back to him let us sink in a little bit this is the Jubilee this is the year of redemption there's going to be a proclamation in this 50th year this year of Jubilee throughout all the land and all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee and return to every man his possession he lost give him back what he lost through his own uh his own unfaithfulness through his own gambling through his own insecurities and insufficiencies however he lost it it doesn't matter give it back to him if any man lose his family return that man to his family not as a servant but back as he was and a jubilee that a jubilee shall that 50th year be unto you and you shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy Vine undressed what a type of the curse being lifted of Genesis 3:19 it the curse isn't lifted but yet he wants to represent something in this 50th year to show that this is signifying in representing man's ultimate Jubilee that the the the evidence of sin in the beginning is now in an earth that we have to dress and we have to keep and we have to fight with it not as Adam was attended to in the beginning but now wrestling and toy with it and now he says you know what don't gather don't sew don't reap uh that goth of it in itself nor gather the grapes that are undressed he says just you take that break as a sign of what this rest is freedom and liberty from this curse for it is the Jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession that's Redemption this is the law of redemption that God put in the Old Testament so that we could draw from this this is God's mind this is God's attitude this is how God feels about something that is originally possessed and then lost God hates it when we lose something right there's there's something too we I maybe I'll just speak for myself and maybe Lord I apologize if I put something in your I hate it when I lose something and you want to trip my whole week up just have me lose something CU I won't go back to whatever it is I was planning until I find it because I don't believe in Black Magic and I believe that if something is it was somewhere at one time then it's still somewhere at at another time you just got to find where that is and I'm finding the older I get the better Hider I've become and I've hid things in really really good places and I'm waiting for the revelation of where I hit it so I can find it but I hate to lose something and there's something about in the nature of God that if something was his and he loses it God says uhuh not for everybody I'm not going to lose one thing my words will not return to me void if I possess something if something was mine I'll never let it go I'll never give it up even if it runs away from me even if it turns its back on me if it's mine I'm getting it back and that's the that's what Redemption means God would not be satisfied of having you and then you being lost and just making a new you as a replacement he wants you back that's what Redemption is Redemption is not replacement Redemption is to bring back what was lost Hallelujah God wants to bring what was was lost back this speaks the scripture saying this is my heart this is my attitude this is what I'm going to do I love it God's so intent on Redemption that we could say we haven't lost a hair on our head Glory right there's certain things we just real I I haven't lost anything I haven't already gained there I hope that doesn't do have anything to do with weight but it's a it's the principle of redemption as we read in Leviticus 25 and you're all well versed in this through excellent teaching through the years and then the message of the hour just places it so beautifully this is the perfect type of redemption of the Soul this law of redemption this Jubilee we find that we've been loosed from the bondage of sin that as we've already read that Christ has loosed us he has set us free as the first Adam took us out the second Adam brings us back in and so this is be we're freed from sin and the bondage that comes with it and the punishment that's associated with it we're free you've passed already from death into life you can't come into judgment you can't be judged You' already been delivered in the Year of Jubilee someone couldn't reach past that and say no you owe me say butd he's free and the only way that we could go back to the bondage of before is if we choose to I think that tells us the power we have now is redeemed Sons and Daughters of God to put ourselves in bondage now as Paul is writing this in Galatians 5 there's just so much that you can gather from these other places around it he if I can put it this way he's admonishing the galatian church the Believers to operate the Liberty The Authority that's been granted them in Christ Jesus that say Stand Fast in Liberty why would you being made free go back to something that's bondage why would you being delivered ever want to go back to be in the state of being bound down and he's telling them now you stand fast in the Liberty where in Christ hath made us free don't tangle yourself up again don't be yolked up again don't be bowed down again in these other things and remember this has been repetition Paul believed that the kingdom of God was not in eternity in some other atmosphere in The Ether somewhere but he believed that the kingdom was going to be on earth the kingdom would be established on Earth it' be a messiah Reign on Earth Paul looked around in in Israel and he saw the dimensions of the Promised Land he saw the priesthood he saw the people he saw the flesh he saw the history he knew this is something God's going to redeem one day the Kingdom's going to be here on Earth to a Hebrew it wasn't a place he was going to listen this is this has been something that started this thought in my heart in the very beginning to a Jew a church wasn't a place they went a religion wasn't something they practiced it was who they were we call ourselves uh zoners is that what we call ourselves in Arizona zoners or maybe Texans or whatever we might be call ourselves and we have this identity these states that we belong to and we call ourselves Americans and we identify with this we identify with all sorts of things carnivores vegans you name it we have all sorts of ideas and then there's kind of this other part that kind of mix into it to say well I'm also a Christian right and Christianity is just a part of it but to a Jew there was no separation of their religion from their daily life there was no separation of their religion from their nationality from their identity so their their religion was practiced daily it was who they were so when Paul thinks about a kingdom he's not thinking of oh I'll just go to church one day like we think well I go to church on Wednesday I go to church on Sunday it's just kind of this check the box thing when it comes to religion oh one day we're going to go to heaven one day we're going to go to Heaven till Paul is like no the kingdom is heaven on Earth the kingdom is to be established on Earth so Paul he believed the kingdom was not going to be in heaven but it would be on earth therefore let it be in Earth if it's going to be on earth then let it be in Earth so Christ had made him free from the Dominion of sin the World the Flesh the devil and he's saiding don't go back and be entangled again with sin the World the Flesh the devil don't do it likewise we also having been made free from the law of sin and death having been made free by Christ let's stand in the liberty and don't be entangled again with the Yoke of bondage so he says in Galatians 4: 8-9 how be it then when you knew not God you did service unto them which by Nature are no Gods there's no power in those things there's no there's no deity there's no lordship there's no Dominion but now after the have known God and I love this or rather are known of God what does it bring us back to predestination brings us back to God's thoughts in the beginning beginning how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements wherein you desire again to be in bondage why would we ever want to go back and be in bondage to the weak and beggarly elements I know it's worthy of a lot more attention than maybe we're going to give it in these few moments but Paul is pointing to the believer's position in Christ right now where you've been made free from weak and beggarly elements you've been made free from so many things this is the Kingdom on Earth right now we've been set free that's the condition of our soul from that control tower down in our souls you've got something greater than everything else greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world it's something greater now in the sermon the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride he says this is kind of a lengthy statement here but I want to I want to read this so you can continue to see this parallel maybe I can button that up a little bit the Earth is one day going to be delivered Romans 8 tells us it's going to be delivered uh second Peter 3 the bands that hold it back going to be dissolved and we've been delivered we're no longer under the yal bondage that Liberty has been granted to us through the new birth now brother Bram describing so many different parts here he says look them hands designed this for his beloved bride designs in tenderly love for his bride he gets into this and things that are to be just think of how that God has even designed this Earth and how his hands designed this for his beloved bride designs and Tenderly love for his bride remember that the Holy Ghost descended on Jesus which Jesus was a part of the earth why the germ of God the life of God was designed in the womb of a woman which was the earth think of this type all all right and then the life of God came in so he was the beginning of the creation of God and now brother brandom several places where he talks about this but when when the Holy Ghost came down on the Jordan River and indwelled God came to dwell in his son he said Heaven and Earth embraced Heaven and Earth kissed there's that there's that type we get to see Between Heaven and Earth coming up quite a bit so here's that embracing in Christ he see there's some Affinity from the earth The Germ of God he's B he's shaped in the womb of a a virgin these things are elements that are formed he represents mankind he's the Kinsman even of Leviticus 25 he's the Kinsman and now the father comes to dwell in him he's the beginning of the creation of God it's his blood is divine says and then that blood of God that there was that by that germ when it was shed at Calvary dropped back on the earth what for to redeem the Earth talks about water that overflows it sanctifies or um justifies it type of the water baptism now even the blood this isn't typed the blood coming on the earth it it bathed it to redeem the earth now it's been just Justified it's been Sanctified and claimed now it's to receive its baptism of fire and be cleansed for Jesus and his bride notice how he's pointing to the process of what God does to the Earth he's done it for us now the process of a new birth is not to be we cannot make it Catholicism to where now we kind of break it out into stations and so you come and you visit the confessional brother Aaron has been four weeks since my last confession these are my sins and I say well what you need to do is you need to go burn a candle and visit the the repentance station and then you need to go like do this and you the the justification sanctification and baptism the Holy Ghost were never meant to be stations where we genu flect before it and we kind of we have to come through and check these boxes it's just a type to show the process whereby a person's renovated and changed the process of redemption justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost God can do like that amen and sometimes we try too hard to force Our Lives into well I believe from 2010 to 2013 and a and a half I was justified and then from 2013 and a half until 2019 I was Sanctified and thank God for Co right I got the Holy Ghost and we just try so hard to make things fit into these boxes that's where a lot of ideas come from people trying to make sense of their experience when they were in denominations they go well I must have had it this way I must had hey just accept the fact that when you came to this word you got your new birth of Malachi 4 just accept that that's when the Holy Ghost sealed you into the kingdom of God when you had that baptism of Holy Ghost experience that's the new birth I don't need to try to figure out what day it was I just want to know that it [Applause] is and sometimes it's where we get hung up trying to turn it into these little blocks and stations but he show us that there's this process the Earth Justified the Earth Sanctified he says now it's got to receive its baptism of fire to be cleansed and then I catch this paralleling even with Christ and you you are these other parts that's drawn out of the this Earth You are now maybe this can help some of us if we're struggling with the idea that well I know I'm going to be forever but it's hard for me to understand how this Earth is going to be forever and he says well you came from it it's a packaged deal think of this he says your soul he says the Earth you're are a part of the earth your body your body is a part of the earth your soul is a part of God an attribute of God displayed here on Earth in a body the soul is redeemed right this is me speaking now to those who are getting out on the podcast the soul is redeemed that Soul has been redeemed through the process of the new birth now he says the body is to be redeemed there's Redemption for our body what what would it mean if he redeemed our soul and our Spirits were crazy what good would it do us what where are you then if your soul survives and your spirit doesn't go with you there's some things to chew on at least so the Redemption is complet complete there's Redemption for the soul there's Redemption for the mind the spirit there's Redemption for the body that's complete Redemption that's perfect Redemption so he's saying that the body's to be redeemed now the soul is redeemed because it was in sin so God came down by by a process of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul and you being part of the earth it's Redeemed by it you're in the process now oh man what kind of Goosebumps and shivers Shivers up the spine is the earth going to get when your body changes I got mine coming right they know their day is coming when your body changes it's a witness to them that their change is coming amen God came down in this process he said your body it's grow it on now notice this parallel this to me is well you know just just as my habit is wait till 8:07 on a Wednesday night to talk about something like this but the Earth he says your Soul's redeemed but now he's kind of talking about your body and he says your body's part of the earth and it's Redeemed by it and he say it's talking about the process of the earth he says you're in the process now it's growing up your body was justified under Noah's baptism and your flesh when it dropped upon here and your flesh when it dropped upon there that's the blood and the Earth is to be cleansed by fire the place where you will live with the baptism of the Holy Ghost a dwelling place for Christ's bride the New Jerusalem think about what he's saying he's he's bringing all these different thoughts together but I want you to be able to kind of if you could bring that together and realize that what's going to happen to the Earth my soul has already gone through that process but the body too that's when he talks about the the three-fold process and he goes Luther Wesley Pentecost and the Rapture now you tell tell me where are we living we're not just living in Pentecost the Pentecost has been that the believer in every age we're in the bright age the age of the change the age of the Rapture the age of the Redemption of this body this is he says you're in the process now and now he kind of Skips that we know this his body has got to be changed this body has got to be changed he says the Earth is to be cleansed by fire to make a place where you'll live with the baptism of the Holy Ghost a dwelling place for Christ and his bride the New Jerusalem that's the Earth that's coming the new Heaven A New Earth and brother Bram says the world could not go right on after the Millennium without being changed to have such a place in it it'll have to be changed to have a new Heaven the to have the New Jerusalem be able to make its appearance on Earth this Earth has to change just like you had to change right just like we must be changed by his holy fire is what he says to condition and make a place for him to be contained within us that is the Holy Ghost so just as much as the Holy Ghost had to change our soul for him to find a place to dwell and to live in us the world has got to be changed to have such a place in it it'll have to be changed our soul has been changed our soul has been redeemed and this body is the next thing to be changed amen so many scriptures in types we could bring through this but God has a predestinated plan of redemption for our soul and for our body and his brother B says your Soul's a part of God and your body is a part of the earth and and so let's just leave it there your soul is a part of God and I think that's just easy we just accept that now your body is a part of the earth now that's where we kind of get might get hung up a little bit because we know how sticky this flesh has been we know all the things it's experienced the memory it has people say well you know you feel like you're Justified you never did it in the first place if we could get Zuckerberg just to delete our Facebook profile permanently or Google could just kind of scrub clean the history of our Instagram and everything else we'd feel pretty good about ourselves or better about ourselves but we know there's just kind of this record but you realize when the earth is burned up there's there's not going to be a record there's there's not going to be a a record of these things there going to be some hieroglyphics on a wall or some feti on a railroad car say oh gangster Mac yeah I remember him he was the man and recognize this from the the the Redemption I I'm going to try to do this uh uh in transition here well maybe I can stop maybe I could just cut it short but I want to get to this part at least Leviticus 25: 23 and 24 the land shall not be sold sold forever for the land is mine this is God speaking this is Moses speaking this is the high priest speaking this isn't Gangsta ma speaking this is God saying the land you may sell it you may give it up you may play Folly with it and you may sell it to somebody through the process of marriage it may come into the hands of of a of a heathen a gentile may take possession whatever it might be it might be sold but I won't let it be sold forever it might be contaminated but I won't let it be contaminated forever it might be possessed but I won't let it be possessed forever for the land is mine he says for years are strangers and Souljers with me notice the language he uses with Israel even he's saying look it's mine you're dwelling in it and in all the land of your possession you shall Grant a Redemption for the land this is part part of the law of redemption the land could be leased for a season the land could be harvested by someone else for a season someone could lose their land and their possession so it's go lost it's gone they've been running R running rough shot on it they've been tearing it up they've been letting rocks grow in it be thrown in it they've been letting weeds growing It Whatever might happen to it oh it's just chaos it's just confusion all the nonsense and Corruption they built a bar there they put the tattoo parlers there they've been running gambling onto all my lot my field is a complete chaos it's a complete mess God says it won't be sold forever no sir not forever the land is mine and you've got to Grant in your land all the land of your possession Grant a Redemption for the land in other words that land if it was yours it's got to come back to [Music] yours now this is if there's going to be Redemption then for God's people there's Redemption for the Earth as it says in those earlier verses of chapter 25 if there's Redemption for the man and the man can come back to his family if there's Redemption for possession and The Possession has to come back to the man he's saiding the land's got to come back too there's Redemption not only for your soul but there's Redemption for the Earth and if there's Redemption for the Earth there's Redemption for your body you know what I don't care how you try to get it chicken come first the chicken or the egg whatever it is if it's for the body because the Earth or the Earth because the body there's Redemption for the Earth is going to be redeemed my body's going to be redeemed or my body's going to be redeemed so the Earth has to be redeemed it doesn't matter to me all I knows it's going to be redeemed because of the law of redemption now you can back into this God created the Earth for a purpose to get a bride out of it so she's always connected with the Earth our bodies he says here came from the earth God was laying out his material when he created all that you ever would make up your body was there in the earth so certainly there's a Redemption of that Earth and therefore there's a Redemption for your body or there's a Redemption for your body therefore there's a Redemption for the Earth why it is again that part of that Eternal attribute of God Psalms 241 and2 says the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein for he hath founded it upon the Seas and established it upon the floods the land shall not be sold forever if you can think about it maybe we'll pick up this on this at a later time musicians if you'd come this is the reason why I got to express this you are Eternal and the Earth is eternal and that's part of redemption because there's Redemption because there was Redemption for the soul in Leviticus 25 there's Redemption for the land what good would it be for me to be a free man and have no land what good would it be for me to have possessions and have no place to build them and plant them and put them so they they they came together in the process of redemption it was this law that spoke of redemption and because you're redeemed the Earth is going to be redeemed now if we get into it or not I I've been putting this off for 24 parts now but because you're redeemed the Earth is redeemed that's why hell can't be Eternal because hell is and the Lake of Fire is created to deal with all the contamination to deal with the sin to deal with all the unbelief brother says Satan sin and sinners have gone forever it all it's all done blended into eternity and all that was perverted that great Archangel that sat there one day Satan that did all of this evil will be destroyed yes all that's going to be destroyed it's going to be gone so it it doesn't even need to be Eternal it won't be Eternal but because we're Eternal that which was created for us will be Eternal this world this original Garden of Eden this Earth was created for us therefore we're coming back to it and it'll be Eternal God having Redemption for us has an eternal Dwelling Place For Us God having a Plan of Redemption there's Eternal properties to those that are redeemed but there is no Redemption for the devil there is no Redemption for his angels so God created these lower Dimensions these lower Realms even the Trinity below he created for Satan he created realms for them to exist in what's going to happen he's going to burn them all up it's going to collapse them all down we say well we have these Dimensions above well what's going to happen to those there's a place where some are waiting right well they're not going to be waiting anymore they're going to be with us and then there's one where there's a a a where God is when brother describes that seven Dimension what's going to happen it's all going to collapse down and then all these nether regions these where these imps dwell these demons and all these fifth dimensions of science are burned up eradicated gone completely changed and then even the devil hell and All His angels and all those who are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life are cast in the Lake of Fire And he says this is the second death brother says hell was created for the devil and his angels it was created for that to destroy it he says it several different places he says you pass now he says in Matthew 25 that it was prepared this Everlasting fire is prepared for the devil and his angels hell's created for because of iniquity wasn't intended for Adam's race it was God think of this God created a place to cast everything else that wouldn't be Eternal into to destroy it not willing that any would perish but he's got a place where reserved so that eventually that's entirely gone and all that's left is the eternity death and Hell the devil then that were deceived or cash in Lake of Fire the Beast and the false prophet all the dead delivered up those that are judged according to the works whoever is not found written in the Book of Life cast in Lake of Fire why it was made to to finish up completely eradicate so that we can have our eternal life brother says now we find that this Earth will hold the kings of the earth and again in Matthew 5:5 Jesus said the meek shall inherit the earth it isn't we're going to have another Earth it's just going to the same Earth or it's go just going to be the same Earth I'm closing on this statement I'm trying to get the planet of of redemption to you if I don't get nothing else that's the beautiful part of the future home some people pick aart future home and I say some people I'm referring to the critics who try to draw it out well he got it from this scholar and he got it from this book and he got it from that book and he said well he's taking all these these truths these Loose Ends he's bringing these things out and what you find out is the very ones that they say he got it from they got it from somebody else and you just kind of run the run it all back guess what it's all coming from the same book yes it's written in this pling as day the great beautiful revelation of it he's trying to get across is the Plan of Redemption he says if I don't get anything else to you if I if you don't get anything else see the Plan of Redemption now how much would it encourage you if you knew that you were right now under the headship of redemption I mean this every single one of you how much would it mean to you right now to know that you are under the promise of redemption but I lost this and I lost that and this is destroyed and this is out of cater and this isn't working well and this is a wreck and this but you're under the law of redemption well it's been 40 something years it's been this but you're under the law of redemption and it's not a law that manmade that can be broken listen the speaker of this house cannot be removed the laws of this Kingdom cannot be changed Heaven and Earth shall change but my word but my law shall not change you are under the power of redemption God says I will redeem I just say give into it I say just yield to it and say God let this Redemption bear itself on me this Plan of Redemption well I believe one day you're going to do it to the earth I believe it was kind of an emphasis that brother Matthew Watkins had had that we don't doubt the word really what we doubt is ourselves and I don't doubt the word will one day create a perfect eth day I don't doubt that there's going to be a new Heaven A New Earth I don't doubt that the New Jerusalem is going to descend out upon it and I've got a lot of faith to believe those things that will be and I'm ignoring the full potential of what the future is now right now I can walk in the liberty of Christ right now I can have heaven on Earth right now I can be living under his Rock under his shelter until all the poison gas is passed right now his power of transformation is changing Me Cell by cell by cell right now the new body is already being formed inside of me how can I be so confident how can I be so sure there's going to be a new Earth one day there's going to be a new body one day oh I'm under his Plan of Redemption let's bow our heads I know it may seem that every service we can bring it to a climax of decision and uh introspection and we challenge ourselves in great ways and maybe it might seem that there's always you might sense maybe some pull like a you got to come to the altar it's always a come to Jesus moment uh but it's not it's not that magnitude that we're we're looking at but I hope you understand that the word that's preached is is eternal and it's supernatural what's happening is Supernatural to bring you to a place right now in his presence of recognition and to say Lord I've heard from you here's my answer here's my answer Lord Redemption he says if I can't get anything else to you get the Plan of Redemption I I want to mean something to you and I want you to by faith believe that God's redeeming things redeeming relationships redeeming Health Lord if there's going to be a Redemption of those things one day I want to see the types of redemption now healing Divine Healing is a type of the body change then I I want to see healing signs and wonders and miracles all these things these are just foreshadows of what the glory of God is going to be in the in the Divine Eighth Day Lord I Want It Now now no sickness no perversion no doubt no death there's things that torment us emotionally we can't seem to get away from there's certain fears that we have that always kind of cycle around myself personally I've been battling with something uh physically in pain for months now persistent constant can't get away from it to the point where I feel like it's going to drive me crazy but there's one thing I won't let go of is the fact that he made me a promise and I will be free and if I've got to fight with it every day of my life I know one day I'm going to be able to look at a body say it's changed I'm free and I won't stop believing in the power of God to deliver no matter how many funerals we have I won't stop believing in the power of God to deliver from sickness to deliver from cancer to deliver from disease no matter how many sleepless nights we may have I'm not going to stop believing in a God that can Comfort our hearts no matter how many limbs we have to cut off I'm not going to Stop Believing in a God that heals from diabetes I believe in a God that can restore limbs restore marriages restore mind restore health because he's a redeemer and I I want to bring it to these these climaxes these points of decision do you realize how we've made this and I've asked you to Bow your heads I want you to think as these words sound out in your hearts maybe you're turning over things in your own lives we we've made so much about the external so much about the external decisions and we're not weighing the gravity of things in our hearts how God's going to make this connection with us I think we need to restore that connection trying to connect I just It just strikes me to say it that way that we think that maybe something magical is going to take place if we just make the right decision externally and what we're needing to do is really connect with something in our hearts to realize this is God this is what I ought to do got to make the connection there sometimes we're wanting to do something external for the connection happen we got to make that connection in our hearts with this desire for Redemption so I ask you tonight have you heard your Jubilee you desire to be set free I believe you have we've there I believe there's been Deliverance there's been setting free but if you want to stand tonight and say this land will not be sold forever stand in testimony that it will not be sold
