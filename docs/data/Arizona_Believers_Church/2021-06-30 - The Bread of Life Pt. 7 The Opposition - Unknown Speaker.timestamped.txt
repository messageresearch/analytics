[0:00] ruth chapter one i'm gonna just read
[0:02] verse six
[0:03] ruth chapter one verse six i'd like to
[0:06] make a few comments
[0:07] at the outset about this particular
[0:09] verse
[0:10] and then get through um
[0:14] verses three to 14 today though there's
[0:17] um
[0:18] maybe some time and attention that could
[0:20] be spent more on these verses
[0:22] but i feel like we could cover some
[0:24] ground with just how deliberate we've
[0:26] been through the first
[0:27] uh three verses or two verses of this
[0:30] book
[0:31] but let's just look at verse six here in
[0:33] our text ruth chapter one verse six
[0:35] then she this is speaking of naomi arose
[0:38] with her daughters-in-law
[0:39] that she might return from the country
[0:41] of moab for she had heard in
[0:44] the country of moab how that the lord
[0:46] had visited his people
[0:48] in giving them bread this is what
[0:50] motivates her
[0:51] out of this land of moab this message
[0:54] that says god has visited her people
[0:57] and is giving them bread god bless you
[0:59] you could be seated this evening
[1:02] i'd like you to take notice in our
[1:05] for our title we've been we begin in
[1:08] this
[1:09] thought on being hungry and our burden
[1:11] was just looking at how that god has
[1:13] provided the bride
[1:14] a a feast in this time it's a spiritual
[1:17] feast
[1:18] that is what we are feeding on that's
[1:20] given us strength to rise above the
[1:22] laodicean condition
[1:24] ultimately it's those things that we're
[1:25] feeding on that's going to give us power
[1:27] to see
[1:27] the translation of our bodies and these
[1:30] things are connected with the open of
[1:32] the word it's connected with the third
[1:34] pull and these different things and it
[1:36] transitioned from
[1:37] being fed and hungry to this con this
[1:40] thought of which we're introduced to is
[1:42] the living bread of life as brother
[1:43] branham calls it in the rapture
[1:45] looking at the subject of the bread of
[1:47] life and
[1:49] started examining how ruth came out of
[1:51] moab
[1:52] into bethlehem and the scripture says
[1:55] and when they were come to bethlehem
[1:57] they naomi and ruth came at the harvest
[2:00] time so we're just looking at
[2:01] this thought of come to bethlehem and in
[2:04] looking at that we just started
[2:06] and went back and started with root chap
[2:08] ruth chapter one and started in verse
[2:10] one
[2:10] and for a few services we were examining
[2:13] very closely in verses one and verses
[2:14] two
[2:15] uh some of the particulars of
[2:16] elimelech's family and the meanings of
[2:18] their name and some of the foreshadowing
[2:20] some of the symbolism and representation
[2:23] and then the last three services
[2:24] looking at moab and the moabite
[2:27] condition of those different things
[2:29] and i could have called that the
[2:30] condition and and i just may be
[2:33] pondering this in hindsight we could
[2:34] have been looking at specifically maybe
[2:36] as a subtitle
[2:37] the condition and as we uh move into
[2:40] this
[2:41] part here may take just a couple of
[2:43] services as
[2:44] of in looking at the opposition so that
[2:47] we're looking at the bread of life that
[2:48] is made available to the bride
[2:50] that she's to feed on so we are come to
[2:53] bethlehem and there's
[2:54] these different beautiful things that
[2:55] are transpiring for us as the bride
[2:57] and there's a condition that this living
[2:59] bread of life is calling us out of
[3:01] and what i want us to begin to identify
[3:03] is now there's an opposition
[3:05] and we've already looked at it in some
[3:07] ways in looking at how there's a
[3:08] collision with moab before israel got to
[3:10] the promised land
[3:11] and how we have this collision with moab
[3:13] before we come into the millennium
[3:14] so we've been identifying it a little
[3:16] bit already but i'm wanting you to think
[3:18] about this
[3:19] in terms of the opposition there's
[3:21] something that's withstanding you
[3:22] there's an attitude there's a condition
[3:24] there's all sorts of ways that we could
[3:26] express it that's trying to oppose you
[3:29] and keep you from enjoying your
[3:30] spiritual feast so does that make sense
[3:33] to you this evening is maybe just a
[3:34] little bit of a recap
[3:36] and to where we are right now so just
[3:38] want to maybe just use a few
[3:39] terminologies here before we get
[3:41] uh go take a step further we're looking
[3:43] at moab
[3:44] brother branham has identified moab as
[3:46] the formal church
[3:48] it's a lukewarm condition we've
[3:50] identified it as a denominational spirit
[3:52] that does not necessarily follow the ink
[3:54] or place with headquarters with the dot
[3:56] org but it's a spirit
[3:58] a denominational spirit it is uh it is a
[4:00] spirit that can be on an
[4:02] individual that takes comfort in knowing
[4:04] that there's a strict
[4:06] structure or organization uh it is
[4:08] something that can be very fundamental
[4:10] but yet
[4:11] it's not yet in the real channel of the
[4:13] word of god it might have technical
[4:15] truth but yet it's not really
[4:17] in the spirit or the revelation of it
[4:19] there's a lot of different ways that
[4:21] that spirit and condition of moab is
[4:22] identified
[4:24] and we looked at how that there was a
[4:25] system that was set up by impersonation
[4:28] through balaam through balak in moab
[4:30] that bound the people and it was that
[4:32] structure in that system
[4:35] and the whole way that they were
[4:36] operating that rose up to try to keep
[4:38] israel
[4:39] from coming into the promised land so
[4:42] how that's relevant to us is moab is the
[4:45] condition
[4:46] that ruth comes out of we could look at
[4:48] it it was israel's coming out and they
[4:49] meet moab
[4:50] and how elimelech and naomi went into
[4:53] moab and there's a lot of different ways
[4:55] that that's instructive to us and
[4:57] great truths that can be typed in this
[4:59] story but where we see the strongest
[5:01] representation
[5:03] and the most direct message to us as we
[5:05] begin to like wait a minute
[5:06] ruth was a moabite and she has to be
[5:09] brought out of moab
[5:11] in order to be married to boaz then we
[5:13] can immediately begin to
[5:14] identify more particularly with her and
[5:17] say so then
[5:18] what that moabite condition and the
[5:20] things that she would have believed and
[5:21] been bound by
[5:23] and thought was so wonderful it's that
[5:25] circumstance or condition that ruth
[5:27] comes out of
[5:28] therefore it's relevant to our hidden
[5:30] mystery
[5:31] it's relevant to the hidden mystery that
[5:33] we can find in the book of ruth that
[5:35] when you catch it it'll bring you close
[5:36] to god
[5:38] and i think it's worth it for us to take
[5:40] time to examine these things
[5:41] in detail and i want to point this out
[5:44] in verse 6
[5:45] at the beginning at the outset that
[5:48] by the time you get to verse 6 there's a
[5:50] lot of things happen ten years have been
[5:51] covered rather quickly
[5:53] through the first five verses and
[5:56] elimelech and naomi and their two sons
[5:58] having been in moab
[5:59] left bethlehem judah and gone into moab
[6:01] because of a famine
[6:03] in israel and in particular bethlehem
[6:05] judah her husband having died her two
[6:07] sons died it says she arose the onomia
[6:09] is now arising
[6:10] with her daughter-in-laws so there seem
[6:13] to be animated and active with her
[6:15] that she naomi might return she's going
[6:18] to leave
[6:18] the country of moab and this is what
[6:21] spurs her on she's there she's living
[6:23] her life she's trying to get by she's
[6:24] dealing with her grief and her pain
[6:26] but she hears something for she had
[6:28] heard in the country of moab
[6:30] so a message got to her where she was
[6:34] the message got to naomi and her
[6:36] daughter-in-law's there in the country
[6:37] of moab
[6:38] and this was the message that the lord
[6:40] had visited his people
[6:42] this is a visitation of the lord if we
[6:44] looked at the
[6:45] the circumstances of how elimelech
[6:48] left israel because of a famine god
[6:50] withdrew his blessings from israel
[6:52] because of their disobedience
[6:54] but now god had returned god's presence
[6:56] is back amongst them
[6:58] vindicated with signs and wonders
[6:59] vindicated with his presence among his
[7:01] people
[7:02] and so the lord had visited his people
[7:04] and now in particular
[7:06] in giving them bread and this is why
[7:09] naomi then is quickened to go back
[7:13] whatever her justifications and reasons
[7:15] a decade earlier had been regardless of
[7:17] whatever suffering she had endured
[7:18] and whatever connection she might have
[7:20] felt to moab there was a message that
[7:22] caught her attention
[7:23] that uprooted her out of moab and set
[7:26] her sights on
[7:26] israel to go back to where she knew she
[7:28] belonged
[7:30] now that's a remarkable way to express
[7:33] it for naomi
[7:35] but this is what begins ruth's
[7:36] transformation
[7:39] this is the message that god had visited
[7:41] his people and giving them bread
[7:43] this begins ruth's exodus out of moab
[7:48] now when this message comes and it
[7:50] begins to animate
[7:51] the family and that naomi's inspired and
[7:54] ruth is going to begin to go out and
[7:55] even we'll see the orpha
[7:57] as well when this happens this i want
[7:59] you to look at it not so much as naomi
[8:01] but this is ruth's story it's called the
[8:03] book of roof
[8:04] it's not the the book of elimelech and
[8:06] his failures
[8:07] but it's the book of ruth and so she is
[8:10] going to be
[8:11] she's the central figure and so god
[8:13] sends a message and i want you to ponder
[8:15] this because i'd like to
[8:16] i'm i kind of have this vision in mind
[8:18] of coming to this point and i want to be
[8:20] very very impactful
[8:22] when we get to it later on that here's
[8:24] ruth
[8:25] having no idea really what's happening
[8:29] she she doesn't hear this message like
[8:31] oh god the lord has visited his people
[8:33] and given him bread
[8:34] you know that sounds a lot like the
[8:35] messiah or it sounds like this and it
[8:37] sounds like that and you know that moab
[8:39] represents this and we're the product of
[8:40] incest and this and that
[8:42] and she starts using all these types and
[8:44] says i've been waiting for this
[8:44] invitation all my life
[8:46] don't you know that israel's promise to
[8:47] messiah this is a great type of the
[8:48] messiah coming
[8:49] there's probably a kinsmen redeemer
[8:51] there that i can show in type about the
[8:53] bride
[8:53] she has no idea what's going on she
[8:56] there's just something that begins to
[8:57] transpire and happen
[8:59] and as the story unfolds i believe that
[9:01] we could see ourselves even where we are
[9:03] today
[9:04] and begin to realize that when we heard
[9:06] the message of the hour
[9:09] to quote a lot of message preachers come
[9:10] on somebody think about it how that when
[9:13] we were in
[9:14] when we heard the message we were just
[9:15] like this is awesome
[9:17] but just think how much more awesomer it
[9:19] became
[9:21] right although this is good we're going
[9:22] to go to israel and get some bread
[9:24] change of scenery this is nice or this
[9:26] is much better than the denomination i
[9:27] was in or this is much better than the
[9:29] sinful condition i was in
[9:30] but as this message began to unfold you
[9:32] found out wait a minute this is just not
[9:34] another denomination
[9:35] this just isn't another way to worship
[9:37] christ this isn't pentecost plus or
[9:39] something with more truth
[9:40] this is it and it's a it's a progression
[9:45] and unfolding that transpires for us
[9:47] and so his roof is coming out of moab
[9:49] this is her exodus
[9:51] this is the beginning of her
[9:52] transformation now let's look at verse
[9:55] three and i want to begin to read
[9:57] in in injecting some statements from
[9:59] brother branham in here
[10:01] to amplify these these verses so it says
[10:04] analimolex so
[10:06] i well let's i can just read these very
[10:08] quickly now came to pass in the days
[10:09] when the judges ruled that there was a
[10:11] famine in the land this is verse one
[10:13] and a certain man of bethlehem judah
[10:14] went to sojourn in the country of moab
[10:16] he and his wife and his two sons and the
[10:19] name of the man was elimelech in the
[10:20] name of his wife naomi
[10:22] in the name of his two sons mohan and
[10:24] kilian efferties of bethlehem judah
[10:27] and we looked at those in a few services
[10:29] and then we focused on this statement
[10:31] through three services or so and they
[10:33] came into the country of moab
[10:35] and continued there so those are the
[10:37] prior uh
[10:38] six services or so or five services that
[10:41] we spent on this now verse three
[10:43] and the limit naomi's husband died
[10:46] and she naomi was left and her two sons
[10:50] now this is the the first instance that
[10:53] we have of describing
[10:54] their life in moab and it's very
[10:57] dramatic that it
[10:58] we come to this because the book of ruth
[11:00] opens with
[11:01] a famine and then immediately a funeral
[11:04] it's a famine that it opens with and it
[11:06] opens with the funeral
[11:07] now remember that's how it opens but
[11:08] remember how it ends
[11:10] with a wedding and a conception and a
[11:11] birth so it begins with the funeral
[11:13] a famine and a funeral it says elimelech
[11:15] dies and so naomi's there with her two
[11:18] sons and this death we need to catch how
[11:19] that it's an untimely death
[11:22] that this was not a death of old age and
[11:24] this is not him dying of natural causes
[11:26] but he left israel this is not just some
[11:29] wild assumption
[11:30] and you can go into some of the
[11:31] historians the caudis or even josephus
[11:34] and they amplify this
[11:35] in a way to emphasize that this the text
[11:38] is telling us
[11:40] that elimelech left because he need he
[11:42] wanted to secure his life he wanted to
[11:44] have
[11:44] better provision he wanted to make a
[11:46] better uh status for himself and for his
[11:48] wife and his two sons
[11:50] and so eliminate leaves israel which we
[11:52] could say
[11:53] even david would refer to it as the land
[11:55] of the living
[11:56] not just the realm of mortals but israel
[11:58] that's the land of the living that's
[11:59] where life is that's where the promise
[12:01] is
[12:01] he lives it leaves israel to save his
[12:04] life only to perish probably very soon
[12:06] after getting there
[12:08] and then so there's my honey we're this
[12:09] we're just coming here for a little
[12:10] while and this will be good and our
[12:12] boys will find some nourishment maybe i
[12:14] could get a job for a while
[12:15] we could save up some money when the
[12:17] time's right we can go back and redeem
[12:18] our property
[12:19] there and buy it back at the time of the
[12:21] jubilee or different things maybe they
[12:23] thought there was a way that it could be
[12:24] restored to him
[12:25] but he gets there and very soon probably
[12:27] very soon
[12:28] he dies and we can say this is
[12:31] probably very soon because the way that
[12:32] the scripture is written
[12:34] um josephus says they were probably only
[12:37] there
[12:37] 10 years total the way that it's written
[12:39] suggests that the boys were married and
[12:41] that they'd only been there 10 years
[12:43] before they died but as
[12:46] this happens very suddenly elimelech
[12:49] could have
[12:50] never probably never imagined what
[12:52] awaited him when he got there
[12:55] he would have never thought that yeah
[12:56] we're going to make this big move i'm
[12:57] going to get there i'm going to pass
[12:58] away he could have never
[12:59] thought and i want you to ponder this
[13:01] what awaited his family
[13:03] because this wasn't in his mind
[13:05] elimelech is not going there to totally
[13:06] repudiate and reject the law
[13:08] to reject god to reject um uh the the
[13:12] moses and to reject the things that he
[13:13] had been given reject the coming of the
[13:15] messiah
[13:16] he was going there kind of as a way to
[13:18] save himself and
[13:20] and i imagine and this is just me uh
[13:22] thinking this that he would have taught
[13:24] his sons now we're just here for a
[13:25] season
[13:26] but when it's time for you to marry
[13:27] we'll go back and find daughters of
[13:29] bethlehem judah
[13:30] and that's who you'll marry you'll marry
[13:32] daughters of israel and he would have
[13:34] taught him the things
[13:35] look while we're here you need to be
[13:36] careful we need to watch out for this
[13:37] and watch out for that
[13:38] but he should have had a little bit more
[13:40] wisdom before he went
[13:42] because he didn't he didn't have the
[13:44] foresight of the vision to think well
[13:46] what would happen if he passed away
[13:48] he could have never imagined that his
[13:49] sons would have married uh
[13:51] moabites and that they would have had an
[13:53] untimely death themselves
[13:55] brother branham i identifies this
[13:58] in the sermon why little bethlehem
[14:03] and i hope that you can pick up on uh
[14:06] the way that he begins to
[14:09] zero in on some of these things it's
[14:10] just beautiful we find out that years
[14:12] later after naomi had left
[14:14] the country and gone over to sojourn
[14:16] with the moabites
[14:17] and then he's gonna he's gonna use naomi
[14:21] kind of as a central figure not
[14:22] necessarily a limoulek
[14:23] but it becomes naomi once he's gone and
[14:26] we can say that she certainly represents
[14:27] elimelech's decision and family he says
[14:30] and when they had evilly mistreated her
[14:33] i was to where he says it's the moabites
[14:36] and she had gotten out of fellowship
[14:38] with the rest of the believers
[14:40] we know as a limelight that made the
[14:41] decision to move with his wife but now
[14:42] we see that naomi is
[14:44] out of fellowship with the rest of the
[14:45] believers she's being evilly mistreated
[14:47] by
[14:47] these these people that she's associated
[14:49] with and she associated herself
[14:51] in a backslidden condition so there's
[14:54] this representation in the type
[14:56] of moab represents a backslidden
[14:58] condition naomi finds herself in that
[15:01] in another land among another people
[15:04] he says and otherwise now he's maybe
[15:07] gonna
[15:09] look at it this way and this is the part
[15:10] i really want you to catch on because
[15:12] it's going to become
[15:12] critical to looking at these other
[15:14] verses she had left the true believing
[15:17] church
[15:17] to go out into the world for a little
[15:19] while
[15:20] now notice the the the parameters for
[15:23] this because it
[15:24] i think it becomes a very clear warning
[15:25] to us to be careful
[15:28] of what gets our attention what moves
[15:29] upon us or what kind of
[15:31] establishes the structure that we want
[15:32] to exist within she went
[15:34] left the true believing church to go out
[15:36] into the world for a little while we're
[15:38] just gonna go for a little bit
[15:40] to join some social church
[15:43] this is one of the biggest dangers to us
[15:45] you say oh well not in the message maybe
[15:47] even more so in the message
[15:49] that we get so comfortable in the fact
[15:51] that the fundamentals there and the
[15:52] doctrine's there and this is mainstream
[15:54] message and it's not in this in this uh
[15:56] fringe movement here and not in this
[15:58] kingdom over here or not
[15:59] with this false doctrine over there we
[16:01] get kind of comfortable in the
[16:02] fundamentals of quote unquote mainstream
[16:04] message
[16:05] but we can get into a social
[16:08] the social mechanics and the social
[16:11] dynamics of mainstream message and he
[16:12] says to join some
[16:14] social church who just who believed in
[16:16] just anything would be all right
[16:18] there's some sort of comfort that
[16:20] they're taking in their fundamentals
[16:22] in there she lost her husband now he's
[16:24] making he's identifying this
[16:26] that it's in that uh in this process and
[16:30] this unfolding
[16:31] that she lost her husband and it don't
[16:32] have to be every time in physical death
[16:35] so it tells us that it's not so much
[16:37] well if you get out of this and you
[16:39] become more social and you lose your
[16:40] connection with the things of god and
[16:42] you're not in that channel of a true
[16:44] believing
[16:45] uh individual in the right kind of
[16:47] atmosphere that you're going to
[16:48] physically die but he says you might
[16:50] lose him in a spiritual death
[16:53] or lose your wife and what a spiritual
[16:55] death so spiritual death would be the
[16:58] worst consequence
[16:59] and this is what he's warning us about
[17:02] so he says better stay on good
[17:04] grounds think about that better stay on
[17:07] good grounds and this is a very this is
[17:08] foreshadowing
[17:09] because he's saying that elimelech and
[17:11] naomi made their mistake when they left
[17:13] good ground and got on background
[17:15] and it was in that bad ground that
[17:17] elimelech dies naomi's now in a person
[17:19] you know out of fellowship with the rest
[17:21] of the believers associate herself in a
[17:23] backslidden condition
[17:24] and he's saying the death of elimelech
[17:26] is a type of spiritual death
[17:28] and he says you better stay on good
[17:30] grounds
[17:31] now this foreshadows something that
[17:33] begins to happen and transpire in the
[17:35] book of ruth
[17:36] because what begins to get really
[17:38] pronounced
[17:39] when ruth comes back into bethlehem and
[17:42] she happens in what a field
[17:44] and she finds yourself in the good
[17:46] ground
[17:47] that that that elimelech had left and so
[17:50] the ground the place where you settled
[17:52] where you're feeding where you're
[17:53] existing
[17:54] is important to spiritual vitality
[17:57] spiritual life and spiritual strength
[18:00] we cannot fool ourselves into thinking
[18:03] that we can be strengthened in the inner
[18:04] man and strengthen spiritually
[18:06] if we just are out there on bad ground
[18:09] and
[18:09] since it's wednesday night let's pat
[18:11] ourselves on the back we can't fool
[18:12] ourselves into thinking that we can stay
[18:14] out of church and grow in christ
[18:16] bill graham said it's impossible he said
[18:19] you can't be a christian and stay at
[18:20] home
[18:21] anybody familiar with that should i
[18:23] start bringing my laptop up here so we
[18:25] can just
[18:26] pull it up real quick i that says he
[18:28] said you can't do it
[18:32] oh i'm gonna step forward here a little
[18:33] bit i just kind of got
[18:35] something just really struck me in my
[18:36] mind that i've been pondering
[18:39] so he says you had better stay where you
[18:41] know you were covered by the blood
[18:45] you better stay where you know the word
[18:47] is preached you better stay where you
[18:48] know the presence of god is you better
[18:50] stay where you
[18:50] know you are walking in the light and
[18:53] the blood of jesus christ is cleansing
[18:55] us
[18:55] from unrighteousness in that isn't that
[18:58] the kind of assurance that we want
[19:00] especially in a time like this in an age
[19:02] like this you better you had better stay
[19:04] where you know you're covered by the
[19:06] blood
[19:06] and this is let this impact you tonight
[19:08] let it really really
[19:10] uh challenge you as an individual but
[19:12] more importantly challenge us
[19:14] as a church challenge us as a church as
[19:16] we're as god is forming an identity and
[19:18] shaping us
[19:19] as a body of believers and giving us a
[19:21] vision as a family
[19:22] of what we're going to stand for what
[19:24] we're going to look like even what we're
[19:25] going to present to those that we come
[19:27] in contact with
[19:28] in witness to are we just wanting to
[19:30] have a particular structure
[19:31] that engages people in a social way or
[19:34] do we want to have an
[19:35] atmosphere where people know they're
[19:37] covered by the blood
[19:40] he says regardless of what the rest of
[19:42] them looks like
[19:43] how big they are how fine of spires they
[19:46] have on their churches
[19:47] or how big the bells ring
[19:51] this is hitness right where it counts
[19:52] when we have become the instagram
[19:54] generation and we become
[19:56] those who are enamored with social media
[19:59] and we're constantly checking the news
[20:00] and the
[20:01] and the tweets and all these different
[20:02] things and we need to be informed we
[20:04] want to know what everyone is saying and
[20:05] we have all these
[20:06] filters and ideals and ideas and all
[20:08] these things are trying to be
[20:10] positioned and presented in such a way
[20:12] to where it's dramatic
[20:14] and it's awesome and it's so huge and
[20:16] it's so great
[20:17] and we have to realize that we have this
[20:19] part of us in ourselves
[20:20] that even in sincerity we want to be
[20:23] able we want to be a part of something
[20:24] big
[20:25] we want to be a part of something great
[20:26] we don't want to have any shame when we
[20:28] invite people to church
[20:29] we don't want to be stigmatized as being
[20:32] backwards or even backwoods
[20:33] and especially in this day and age i
[20:35] don't want to be old-fashioned and i
[20:36] don't want to be identified with this
[20:38] and i don't want to be identified with
[20:39] that
[20:39] and sometimes we feel like if the spire
[20:41] can be big enough and everything can be
[20:43] large enough
[20:44] and the bell can ring beautifully and it
[20:46] really really looks big then i can
[20:48] somehow hide within that but don't be
[20:50] fooled
[20:51] it's not how big it is it's whether or
[20:53] not the blood is there
[20:56] he says that again you better stay where
[20:58] the blood covers the sins of the people
[21:02] he says you might lose one another
[21:06] and he says and above all you might lose
[21:08] the lord jesus and be barred out
[21:11] so it's being barred out being cut out
[21:14] it starts to come into view there
[21:17] so these things when he says you better
[21:18] stay where you know you're covered by
[21:20] the blood these things
[21:22] cause us to examine ourselves and ought
[21:25] to cause us to examine ourselves even as
[21:26] a church
[21:29] so continuing now verse four
[21:33] as she is left with her two sons so this
[21:36] verses and they this is the two sons
[21:39] hollande and killian they took them
[21:41] wives of the women of moab i was going
[21:43] to take
[21:44] some time just identifying the scripture
[21:46] some of the prophecies concerning
[21:47] the women of moab the consequences for
[21:49] mary and them but i realize i feel like
[21:51] the point was
[21:52] has already been driven home on those
[21:53] things already so they married these
[21:56] women and the name of the one was orpah
[21:58] that was killian's wife and the name of
[22:00] the other ruth that was
[22:02] uh muhan's wife and they dwelled there
[22:05] about
[22:06] 10 years this is where we kind of get
[22:09] the duration
[22:10] of how long it would have been as i said
[22:13] before limelight could have never
[22:14] imagined
[22:15] what awaited him when he got there and
[22:17] then also what awaited his family
[22:20] we had never considered that he would
[22:21] have died and then that his
[22:24] sons would marry strange wives
[22:28] brother banham points this out kind of
[22:31] these characteristics things to look at
[22:33] as oprah
[22:34] orpah and ruth are introduced
[22:37] he says in the message redeemer
[22:39] redemption while they were over there
[22:40] the two sons grew up and married two
[22:43] girls
[22:44] one of them named orpah
[22:48] and one of them named ruth this is
[22:51] this is really this is exciting stuff
[22:54] and the two beautiful pictures of the
[22:56] churches
[22:57] or a beautiful picture of two churches
[22:59] because you're going to separate these
[23:00] things out
[23:01] and naomi and maybe three we could say
[23:05] three different churches but one just
[23:07] relating to the gentiles naomi a perfect
[23:09] picture of the orthodox church brother
[23:11] graham identifies the jewish orthodox
[23:12] church
[23:13] or she represents the jews naomi a
[23:15] perfect picture of
[23:16] the jews orthodox church he says orpah
[23:19] catch this
[23:20] a picture of the lukewarm gentile church
[23:24] now she's a picture of the lukewarm
[23:25] gentile church
[23:27] where do we identify that in the
[23:29] scripture
[23:30] revelations chapter 3 verse 17 this is
[23:33] laodicea
[23:35] so now we are actually beginning to see
[23:36] that there's a lot contained in
[23:39] in the book of ruth there's a lot more
[23:41] to it than well ruth kind of represents
[23:43] this gentile woman that mary's boat has
[23:45] and therefore we have the gentile bride
[23:46] and we have christ represented in this
[23:48] love story so much more to it in that
[23:51] orpa now
[23:52] represents the lukewarm gentile church
[23:55] the culmination of seven church ages in
[23:58] that it
[23:58] is represented in the laodicean
[24:01] condition
[24:02] so orp is a picture of the lukewarm
[24:04] gentile church and ruth
[24:06] a picture of a bride so
[24:09] moab which orpah was a moabitus she is
[24:12] she's the product of moab she's the
[24:14] culmination of
[24:15] a moab condition being raised as a
[24:17] mobile even marrying a bachelor
[24:20] a husband who dies and an orphan now
[24:22] she's a representation of laodicea the
[24:24] lukewarm gentile church
[24:26] that's a product of moa but here's ruth
[24:28] now
[24:29] she has a picture of a bride he says
[24:31] such a beautiful way
[24:33] as god has laid all of his word by
[24:35] inspiration
[24:36] could you say amen to that it's just
[24:38] beautiful how god has laid these things
[24:40] out by inspiration
[24:41] that in one verse we can see naomi who
[24:43] represents the jews
[24:45] we see orpah who represents laodicea of
[24:47] the lukewarm gentile church
[24:48] but then ruth is going to represent the
[24:50] bride who is called out of not only moab
[24:53] but really
[24:54] called out of an orpah condition
[24:57] she's called out of a lukewarm condition
[25:00] so there might have been
[25:01] some camaraderie that they had and some
[25:03] symmetry in their own lives and well
[25:05] we married brothers and they both died
[25:07] and and there might have been something
[25:09] that they identified and had in common
[25:11] and maybe we could say that ruth at one
[25:12] time
[25:12] was very closely in sync with orpah but
[25:15] things are going to change
[25:17] i'm inspired tonight i i i just feel
[25:21] so so free in my spirit and verse five
[25:25] and mohan and killian died also both of
[25:28] them
[25:28] so these are the women that they married
[25:30] muhammad married ruth achillian marries
[25:32] orpah
[25:33] and the both of them die now this is
[25:36] we're just in verse five we've had some
[25:38] verses that are kind of setting things
[25:39] up and then we get into the real action
[25:41] and well now that we're in mobile
[25:42] limelight dies and
[25:43] well okay now we finally have these two
[25:45] boys getting married this is the chance
[25:46] for naomi to get back under her feet
[25:48] again
[25:48] and what happens these two guys die so
[25:51] now we have three widows
[25:53] we have three funerals three widows
[25:57] and says and the women woman was left of
[26:00] her two sons
[26:01] and her husband meaning they had died
[26:03] and they passed away verse six
[26:05] then she arose in this time of sorrow
[26:08] and sadness and death and this
[26:10] widowed condition the death of her first
[26:12] husband the death of ruth and
[26:13] orpah's first husband says she arose
[26:17] with her daughter-in-laws that she might
[26:18] return from the country of moab
[26:20] for she had heard remember the message
[26:22] came heard
[26:24] in the country of moab how that the lord
[26:26] had visited his people
[26:28] and giving them bread christ
[26:31] the word visiting the people
[26:34] making himself known drawing people back
[26:37] to the promised land
[26:39] bringing them to the place to be
[26:40] positionally placed into
[26:43] such a beautiful picture being
[26:44] represented now
[26:46] verse seven wherefore she went forth out
[26:48] of the place where she was
[26:50] this is just describing that she's
[26:52] making advancement now she's leaving
[26:54] where she lived in moab
[26:56] and she's reversing course that she took
[26:58] with her husband
[26:59] and she's going back and as she does
[27:02] says and her two
[27:03] daughter-in-laws her two
[27:05] daughters-in-law with her
[27:07] and they went on the way to return unto
[27:10] the land of judah
[27:12] now we could somehow conceptualize this
[27:14] in our minds and as we showed it on the
[27:16] map before how
[27:17] they reversed the exodus and they went
[27:19] back to where they had left from went
[27:20] back to the
[27:21] place of the collision went right back
[27:22] to the place where israel had fallen
[27:24] in the feast of bel peor here they're
[27:26] back in mob but now the message comes
[27:28] and naomi's leaving and it's not just
[27:30] naomi by herself
[27:32] but she has orpah and she has ruth with
[27:34] her and they
[27:35] went on the way they're in a journey now
[27:37] they're leaving
[27:38] so there's some distance that's been
[27:40] traveled
[27:41] and i don't think that it necessarily
[27:43] matters just how far they went or how
[27:45] long it was but we need to understand
[27:47] that ruth and orpah start out and
[27:49] they're on their way to return
[27:52] unto the land of judah judah so they're
[27:53] making progress to it it's getting
[27:55] closer
[27:57] and let's not just think that there was
[27:58] a conversation that was had they're kind
[28:00] of texting each other in the family
[28:01] whatsapp
[28:03] and saying well hey i think i'm going to
[28:04] go back to judah and and they're both
[28:06] saying hey that sounds like a good idea
[28:07] maybe i'll join you
[28:08] this is not happening in some sort of
[28:10] stasis where they're all
[28:11] you know quiet sitting down talking
[28:13] about this over cheesesteak no they're
[28:15] moving
[28:17] they're advancing they're going forward
[28:19] and they're making progress towards this
[28:21] return
[28:21] so there's been some decision made by
[28:23] all three of them that yes let's go
[28:25] let's do this together
[28:27] and brother branham describes it this
[28:28] way and i think it was in
[28:30] um the why little bethlehem or
[28:34] i think that's the sermon it was in she
[28:35] returned back he makes a statement she
[28:37] returned back because there was no
[28:38] revival spirit in the city at the time
[28:42] so this is some awakening some
[28:44] discernment to recognize there's no
[28:45] revival here this is dead this is going
[28:47] nowhere
[28:48] this is the wilderness experience we
[28:50] just go in circles there's a place that
[28:52] i could be
[28:52] be fed there's a place where god has
[28:55] visited his people there's a revival
[28:56] taking place
[28:57] this place is stagnant this is sterile
[28:59] this is death this is dying
[29:00] so she returned because she recognized
[29:03] there was no revival where she was
[29:05] and so she was moved by a message to get
[29:08] into a place where there was revival
[29:11] this is where we can start to see the
[29:13] types
[29:14] uh begin to emerge as brother adam said
[29:17] orpah represents the lukewarm gentile
[29:19] church
[29:20] and ruth represents the bride here we
[29:22] can begin to wreck these
[29:23] types begin to emerge because orpah
[29:26] representing the lukewarm gentile church
[29:28] she's not
[29:29] personified she doesn't personify the
[29:31] unbeliever so much
[29:32] right the one that just rejects the word
[29:35] and won't believe it
[29:36] but she more personifies or represents
[29:38] the make-believer
[29:40] the one that says amen and the one that
[29:42] pretends to believe the one that
[29:43] impersonates
[29:44] and the one that seems to kind of be in
[29:46] activity in motion
[29:47] with the rest of the believers that's
[29:49] who she represents she is the type of
[29:51] the lukewarm christian
[29:53] she professes she she she begins she
[29:56] starts out she has a
[29:58] she has some sort of profession and this
[30:00] is the part i want you to recognize it
[30:02] says and they went out on the way
[30:04] to return unto the land of judah she
[30:07] begins
[30:08] and starts out in the journey back
[30:12] think about that how malachi chapter 4
[30:14] verse 5
[30:16] that the the spirit of elijah is going
[30:18] to come in an anointed prophet which we
[30:19] know to be william branham
[30:21] and he has a message to turn the hearts
[30:23] of the children back to the
[30:24] the fathers and we see that as a faith
[30:27] or revelation
[30:28] of those apostolic disciples and the
[30:31] apostles at the beginning of the church
[30:33] and so that's what the ministry of
[30:35] malachi 4 5 does is it turns our hearts
[30:37] back
[30:38] to a revelation of christ and so there's
[30:40] people that believe
[30:42] in elijah they believe in the elijah
[30:44] this day and they've
[30:45] left denominations they've left this and
[30:47] they've left that and they seem to have
[30:49] made some progress
[30:50] but if their hearts are never turned
[30:52] they've never benefited from
[30:54] the the purpose of his ministry if you
[30:57] don't have your heart turned to
[30:58] recognize
[30:59] jesus christ present today i'm talking
[31:01] about 2021
[31:02] 1963 i'm talking about today then have
[31:06] you returned
[31:08] are are you can you say i am a roof i am
[31:12] coming to this
[31:13] i'm on good ground i'm in the place that
[31:15] i ought to be i'm in this channel
[31:16] and so this is identifying how that you
[31:19] can start
[31:20] out even as orpah and they're walking
[31:22] you wouldn't be able to tell which was
[31:23] which
[31:25] you see three women you might know naomi
[31:26] maybe she looked a little bit older
[31:28] maybe we knew well that's the
[31:29] mother-in-law and there's the two
[31:30] daughters but which one's going to make
[31:31] it
[31:32] they both look the same they both have
[31:36] very similar testimonies and they're
[31:37] coming from the same the same condition
[31:40] and so now remember this about moab
[31:44] orpah and ruth are moabites
[31:48] and moab was the son of lot by his own
[31:51] daughter
[31:52] and this is where we already looked at
[31:54] it before that beautiful symmetry
[31:56] where we saw a man and his daughters and
[31:58] we saw even the death of a spouse
[32:00] and we saw these things and we just
[32:02] looked at them very quickly and we
[32:03] didn't get into a detail
[32:04] let's look at genesis chapter 19.
[32:13] to see how light that this type of lot
[32:20] and we can see more of the
[32:23] condition that's represented
[32:28] in moab and the character the condition
[32:30] and the character
[32:31] and if i could maybe put us back in the
[32:33] frame of mind of the opposition
[32:34] this is the condition and the character
[32:36] that ruth's called out of but since
[32:38] she's called out of it it becomes the
[32:39] condition and the character of what
[32:41] opposes her
[32:44] since she's since she's leaving it
[32:48] there's always this see when something
[32:50] begins to leave
[32:51] that the the character and the condition
[32:54] wants to kind of grab a hold of it
[32:56] and pull it back put it or just
[32:59] subjugate it put it down push it down
[33:02] and so it's very important to identify
[33:03] these i believe genesis chapter 19 we'll
[33:05] read verses 15 to
[33:08] 17 and then i want to skip to verse 26.
[33:10] and when the morning arose let me back
[33:12] up
[33:12] so this is when the two angels go into
[33:14] sodom
[33:15] and they're and they're going to try to
[33:16] get lot and his family out his wife and
[33:19] his two daughters and when the morning
[33:20] arose then the angels hasten lot saying
[33:22] arise think of this symmetry that how
[33:25] we've already just read that
[33:28] naomi arose in moab
[33:31] to leave and go now this is the message
[33:34] of this
[33:35] these angels to arise take thy wife and
[33:38] thy two daughters which are here
[33:40] let's thou be consumed in the iniquity
[33:42] of the city brother iran talk about how
[33:44] there is no revival spirit
[33:45] in the city we can see this symmetry now
[33:48] in genesis 19 and while he lingered the
[33:51] men laid a hold
[33:53] upon his hand and upon the hand of his
[33:55] wife and upon the hand of his two
[33:56] daughters
[33:57] yeah do we really need to leave he's
[33:59] kind of lingering a little bit but now
[34:00] these angels they lay hold
[34:01] and and the lord being merciful unto him
[34:05] and they brought him
[34:07] forth and set him without the city
[34:11] i actually just even it's striking me a
[34:13] little bit more different right now
[34:15] how that all all naomi had to hear was
[34:17] that there was a message
[34:18] and she's going but here the angel i'm
[34:20] the drag lot out of sodom
[34:22] hey this place is going to burn well
[34:24] it's fire's so bad
[34:27] and and now for the out of the love of
[34:29] abraham and for the types to
[34:31] to fit perfectly the angels have to lay
[34:33] their hands upon them and drag them out
[34:36] of sodom
[34:37] not a really good testimony it's like
[34:40] well so why are you here yeah yeah my
[34:42] husband drags me here
[34:44] hey i'm just here because of this guy
[34:49] it's not a very good testimony they say
[34:51] oh okay well hello brother lautner
[34:53] sister
[34:54] sister nita need a lot
[35:02] and verse 17 and it came to pass
[35:06] when they had brought them forth abroad
[35:08] then he said this is the message to him
[35:10] escape for thy life look not behind thee
[35:14] neither stay thou in all the plain
[35:16] escape to the mountains lest thou be
[35:18] consumed
[35:20] as a paradox here because they were told
[35:23] to not stay in the plane but escape to
[35:24] the mountain lot gets so far and says i
[35:26] don't think i can make it to the
[35:27] mountain
[35:27] here and so or i believe it was and
[35:30] there's an exception made but notice it
[35:32] says escape for the life
[35:33] look not behind thee they had to be
[35:36] dragged out of sodom
[35:39] rescued from a sinking ship taken out of
[35:42] a place that's judged
[35:43] where there's no spirit removing it's
[35:45] it's a it's in shambles it's a terrible
[35:47] condition there's great perverseness
[35:49] ways that we could look at sodom and
[35:51] gomorrah which is what laodicea
[35:53] it's absolutely legal to see in
[35:55] condition they're being kind of dragged
[35:57] out can they make it can they exceed we
[35:58] find out that they never do really
[36:00] but then it says look not behind me now
[36:02] let's skip to verse 26
[36:04] but his wife looked back from behind him
[36:08] and she became a pillar of salt
[36:11] so here is a man and his wife and two
[36:14] daughters
[36:14] that are leaving sodom and as they leave
[36:18] one of the spouses dies and the man is
[36:21] left
[36:21] with his two daughters and why don't we
[36:23] see that whenever elimelech and naomi
[36:26] went
[36:26] into moab with the two sons one of the
[36:29] spouses dies
[36:30] and naomi's left with her two sons
[36:34] and it shows this almost mirror image
[36:38] and this is the beginning and i think
[36:39] this is important this is the beginning
[36:41] of moab
[36:42] because it's one of these daughters that
[36:43] brings forth moab
[36:45] and sets the character in the condition
[36:47] that one day in the future
[36:49] orpah and ruth are going to be leaving
[36:53] and so we catch we go back into the
[36:55] scripture and say wait a minute
[36:56] look at genesis 19. look at this
[36:59] this is the genesis of mob this is the
[37:02] character of moab
[37:03] and the character of moab is to have to
[37:06] be dragged
[37:07] out of sodom and be told whatever you do
[37:10] don't go back whatever you do don't go
[37:12] back
[37:12] but there was something in the nature of
[37:14] lot's wife that looked back
[37:17] there was something even the nature of
[37:19] lot and i didn't put it in here i'm
[37:20] saying who didn't continue all the way
[37:22] to the mountains but stopped in the
[37:24] plains
[37:25] there was something in that character so
[37:27] this tells us that the moab condition is
[37:29] to only go so far
[37:30] be right up next to the borderline of
[37:32] the promised land the conditional mob is
[37:34] to stay right there and because they
[37:35] don't enter in because they're not
[37:37] ordained to it
[37:37] they stand there as a barrier in a block
[37:40] for the the true believer
[37:41] to come and do a collision with and so
[37:43] that believer's got to go through moab
[37:45] to get to the promised land
[37:46] but their character and their condition
[37:48] gets real clingy
[37:51] and is going to be the opposition so now
[37:53] you see ruth this helps us understand it
[37:55] even better
[37:55] ruth is there seemingly lukewarm gentile
[37:59] unbeliever moabitus she's going to leave
[38:02] orpa's going to leave with her but the
[38:04] character of moab is to go back
[38:08] the character that was birthed into that
[38:10] family we see it in the very beginning
[38:14] they have to be dragged out but they
[38:16] only go so far they end up going right
[38:18] back
[38:22] i feel like we could stop right there
[38:25] don't
[38:25] don't say man too loud or too much
[38:28] affirmation in that moment can make give
[38:29] me a little bit of a conflict
[38:31] that's right brother aaron you certainly
[38:32] can
[38:39] i say we could and we've heard from god
[38:42] you know a 40-minute sermon said
[38:44] absolutely we've heard from god that's
[38:46] plain that's direct
[38:48] and you begin to take it as it was in
[38:50] the days of lot
[38:52] as it was in the days of lot as it was
[38:54] in the condition of moab
[38:56] as it was in the beginning in genesis in
[38:58] the birth of a moabitess condition of
[39:00] the man
[39:01] moab and all that that represents so
[39:03] shall it be in the day when the son of
[39:05] man is revealed
[39:06] so shall it be when the living bread of
[39:08] life comes forth
[39:09] to call out a bride there's gonna be
[39:11] this opposition
[39:14] you find that brother brandon begins to
[39:15] identify
[39:17] certain characteristics and maybe we'll
[39:18] we'll hold off a little bit to amplify
[39:20] it later
[39:21] certain characteristics in the days of
[39:22] lot that's represented in lot's wife
[39:26] and this is exactly what is is being
[39:28] portrayed
[39:29] in the book of ruth verse eight naomi
[39:32] said under two daughters-in-law
[39:33] now they've started out together they're
[39:36] in this journey they're getting so far
[39:38] but now
[39:39] this is very interesting because now
[39:42] naomi
[39:43] is going to turn to them and instead of
[39:46] saying
[39:46] just wait till you see the heels of home
[39:49] just wait till you see how beautiful our
[39:51] ranch was and how green the hills were
[39:53] and right now
[39:54] how golden it's going to be and oh it's
[39:56] so hot and muggy here in moab but man
[39:58] once you get over there the elevations
[40:01] just change just a little bit
[40:02] it's going to be gorgeous going to be
[40:03] beautiful a little bit closer to the
[40:05] the mediterranean and she's not trying
[40:07] to sell them on where they're going
[40:10] now listen it's a dry heat it gets a
[40:11] little hot but it's a dry heat no
[40:13] there's no salesmanship here
[40:15] the only senator two daughter-in-laws go
[40:17] return each to her mother's house
[40:20] as they're leaving she says hey you know
[40:21] what you guys should probably stay here
[40:24] you probably you probably shouldn't go
[40:26] and then i want you to kind of catch
[40:28] naomi's language here the lord deal
[40:30] kindly with you as you have dealt with
[40:32] the dead and with me
[40:34] the lord grant you that you may find
[40:36] rest each of you in the
[40:38] household of her husband wanting them to
[40:40] find a husband again
[40:42] in relationship and and children and
[40:44] protection and provision
[40:46] then she kissed them and they lifted up
[40:48] their voice and wept
[40:50] and she told him go ahead and go back
[40:53] now i've been pondering this for weeks
[40:55] now
[40:56] and i think it just it just merits just
[40:58] the statement notice the nature of naomi
[41:01] that she knows she's got to go back
[41:03] because she's heard a message
[41:06] and she begins to recognize that maybe
[41:08] ruth and orpah would have reason or
[41:10] cause to remain
[41:11] in moab and instead of her putting
[41:14] pressure on them and twisting their
[41:16] arms and dangling them over hell and
[41:19] calling them serpent seed if you don't
[41:20] go
[41:21] she says hey if it's in your heart why
[41:24] don't you stay
[41:25] maybe you could find a husband here in
[41:27] moab and maybe you can settle down and
[41:29] maybe you can be comfort and
[41:30] maybe you can find rest notice that and
[41:33] naomi there's no judgment in her
[41:35] attitude towards orpah and her attitude
[41:37] towards ruth
[41:38] there's no condemnation in her words but
[41:40] she actually can express
[41:41] kindness and encouragement and we know
[41:44] where the story goes it's not like all
[41:45] of a sudden i'm gonna go tada orp it
[41:47] turned around you're like what
[41:49] we know that's what's coming so i want
[41:51] you to realize that
[41:52] naomi doesn't bash her oh i i knew you
[41:56] i knew you couldn't follow and naomi's
[41:59] the one that comes up with
[42:00] she's out left us she went out promised
[42:02] me because she was never part of us
[42:05] isn't that what we always say when
[42:06] someone leaves the church well they left
[42:08] but they never were part of us
[42:10] yeah that's why you called them brother
[42:12] that's why you always hung out with him
[42:14] that's why you compliment
[42:16] them that's why you said so glad you're
[42:17] here and god brought you here and that's
[42:19] why you had all sorts of affinity and
[42:20] connections but all of a sudden
[42:22] when they leave it's like well they
[42:23] never really were part of this
[42:25] and then the ministry of truth takes
[42:27] over and you have to do revisionist
[42:28] history right
[42:30] you have to go back and change
[42:31] everything so everybody could do double
[42:33] think that's
[42:34] that's right they never were part of us
[42:35] though they were part of us they never
[42:36] were part of us
[42:38] but nobody doesn't fall for that
[42:42] let's never have that attitude as a
[42:43] church if god sends somebody amongst us
[42:45] and they fellowship with us for a while
[42:47] if they get offended we should repent
[42:50] we should say i'm sorry if it's the word
[42:51] that offends them we don't we can't
[42:52] apologize for the word but we can always
[42:54] humble ourselves
[42:55] and if god would call someone to another
[42:58] place to go to church if god would call
[42:59] someone to a greater ministry god would
[43:01] call them to do something else
[43:03] we ought to give them our blessing say
[43:05] god bless you
[43:06] and let them know hey if it doesn't work
[43:08] out you can always come back
[43:12] don't shut doors and that's what naomi
[43:14] was able to do with orpah
[43:15] she had such an attitude in this
[43:16] situation it wasn't judgment it wasn't
[43:18] condemnation
[43:19] but it was just if it's in your heart
[43:21] you can go back
[43:24] god help us god help us
[43:28] out in verse 10 and they said unto her
[43:30] now this is kind of the
[43:31] the response now from these two
[43:32] daughters surely we'll return with thee
[43:34] unto thy people
[43:35] oh she kind of did a little check hey
[43:37] let's just check ourselves right here
[43:38] before we go any further do you really
[43:40] want to go this is
[43:41] i i want you to know that you have
[43:42] husbands and you have a chance here in
[43:44] moab and
[43:45] there there's ways that you can prosper
[43:47] and thrive where you are now
[43:49] are you sure you want to come with me
[43:51] and so they said yeah
[43:52] we want to go then naomi takes it a step
[43:54] further and naomi said
[43:56] turn again my daughters why will you go
[43:59] with me
[44:00] are there yet any more sons in my womb
[44:02] that they may be your husbands now she
[44:04] started to really look at it from a
[44:05] logical perspective like why are you
[44:08] staying close to my side do you think
[44:09] you're gonna be able to marry another
[44:10] one of my sons and redeem their
[44:12] names of the ones that are dead turn
[44:14] again my daughters go your way
[44:16] for i am too old to have a husband i
[44:18] can't get married and have children
[44:20] and if i should say i have hope if i
[44:21] should have a husband also tonight
[44:24] and should also bear sons nine months
[44:26] later have twin boys
[44:28] would you wait for them till they're
[44:29] grown
[44:31] would you wait 16 17 20 years until
[44:34] they're grown
[44:35] and then marry
[44:39] would you stay for them from having
[44:41] husbands would you keep yourselves
[44:44] for these next two decades and you
[44:46] yourselves not getting married name my
[44:48] daughters
[44:49] saying think about it think about this
[44:51] logically for grieve with me much for
[44:53] your sakes that the handle lord
[44:55] is gone out against me
[44:58] now this is this is very interesting
[45:01] dynamics and i i haven't felt
[45:04] to amplify it
[45:09] any further than this what's obvious and
[45:11] on the surface is this is just naomi
[45:13] kind of
[45:14] giving them a little bit of pushback
[45:17] just saying are you sure you want to do
[45:18] this
[45:20] now what does this become uh to naom
[45:23] to ruth and orpah a test you've left
[45:28] and you say you've been challenged well
[45:29] no we want to do this and you're going
[45:31] to continue but now she kind of gets a
[45:33] little bit more forceful
[45:34] and it's almost as if naomi is trying to
[45:36] discourage them
[45:38] to bring up thoughts in their mind and
[45:40] cause them to rationalize and think
[45:42] about these different things wow are you
[45:43] sure you want to do this
[45:44] and we can see that this template exists
[45:46] in the scripture that when everyone was
[45:48] showing up well man this jesus of
[45:49] nazareth this guy can feed us for days
[45:51] this is where we want to be this is
[45:52] awesome
[45:53] he gets to speak in a little bit of way
[45:54] that's kind of controversial people like
[45:56] what kind of chill out jesus this is
[45:58] this is too weird this is getting this
[46:00] that escalated quickly
[46:01] you know one day we're eating bread now
[46:03] you want us to eat your flesh woohoo
[46:04] come on now
[46:05] let's slow it down a little bit tap the
[46:07] brakes and she's like oh that bothers
[46:09] you
[46:10] and he aggravates a little bit more and
[46:12] it becomes something that kind of
[46:13] creates a little bit of a stigma a
[46:15] little bit of activation what do you do
[46:16] it caused many to walk away
[46:18] and brother branham actually teaches us
[46:20] that sometimes things are sta
[46:22] said in such a way to stumble the people
[46:25] to cause them to go away to stumble to
[46:28] go out and wonder and ponder things
[46:30] yes god does that where he'll actually
[46:32] allow things to be said and done
[46:34] to challenge you to see if that's enough
[46:36] to shake you
[46:39] he allows things to happen he actually
[46:42] uses a statement and i realize i'm
[46:44] paraphrasing a little bit
[46:45] where he says that jesus says go ye
[46:47] therefore in all the world and baptize
[46:49] the name of the father and of the son
[46:50] and of the holy ghost
[46:51] and that was the word but it became a
[46:53] ladder that they used to walk right out
[46:55] of the word
[46:57] why would he say it in such a way that
[46:58] would cause people to walk out of the
[47:00] word
[47:01] just the way that god does things and so
[47:04] we hear
[47:05] we see naomi kind of just turning and
[47:08] pushing a little bit are you sure you
[47:09] want to do this and these things happen
[47:11] in our lives
[47:13] things come up you sure you want to do
[47:15] this you sure this is what's right you
[47:16] sure this is
[47:17] what you should be doing a little bit of
[47:18] a little bit of discouragement
[47:21] a little bit of challenging and testing
[47:23] and then now
[47:24] they as they said before they lifted up
[47:26] their voice and wept and it's almost
[47:28] going to say the same thing
[47:29] and they lifted up their voice and wept
[47:31] again so both times they both
[47:33] think of this uh the how synchronized
[47:35] they are they both are
[47:36] lifting up their voice together they're
[47:38] both weeping but now all of a sudden
[47:39] there's a change
[47:43] and orpah kissed her mother-in-law
[47:46] in other words it was the goodbye kiss
[47:49] just as judas kissed christ to betray
[47:52] him
[47:52] now orpah kisses her mother-in-law and
[47:55] what does this represent
[47:56] she's saying goodbye but now the
[47:59] description but ruth
[48:00] clave to her they both
[48:04] by by what they heard the testing the
[48:06] challenge now they're walking together
[48:08] two sister-in-laws they're walking
[48:09] together they're walking together
[48:10] they stop you sure you want to do this
[48:12] yes they both they lift up their voices
[48:14] together they're both weeping together
[48:16] they're in harmony they're synchronized
[48:17] then they're challenged again and it
[48:19] seems as if in the very moment their
[48:20] voices are lifted
[48:21] together they're both weeping together
[48:23] and they both go
[48:24] to naomi they're going to cling to her
[48:26] they're going to come to her
[48:27] but this is where there's so much how
[48:29] you can amplify this if no
[48:31] naomi represents israel she could even
[48:34] be represented as the law
[48:36] and the prophets the old testament and
[48:38] the first coming of christ and how this
[48:40] is all
[48:41] embodied in these prophecies that are
[48:43] fulfilled and its orphan comes up and is
[48:45] she going to
[48:46] grab it or say no naomi we believe you
[48:49] we hold to you we will follow you
[48:51] but she gives her the kiss
[48:54] and she's going to turn and walk away
[48:56] but ruth grabs a hold of her
[49:00] and there's your type
[49:03] that's who you are you're the roof that
[49:05] cleaves
[49:07] but also here's your opposition
[49:10] here's your challenger you've already
[49:13] begun to make it
[49:15] this is good stuff you've already begun
[49:18] to make it out of moab
[49:21] but now where's your challenge where's
[49:23] your opposition it's in the one kissing
[49:28] naomi
[49:30] brother brahm says in redeemer
[49:31] redemption
[49:34] he says now she said the homeland's got
[49:36] food
[49:40] i must go back and she kissed her donde
[49:43] laws and told them goodbye so the kiss
[49:45] represents goodbye and so orpah a
[49:49] type of the church nominally or he says
[49:52] normally
[49:53] the church formal was willing to kiss
[49:56] her mother-in-law goodbye
[49:59] craving the things of the world and that
[50:01] former life
[50:02] turned back to her idols so here's orpah
[50:06] this laodicean condition this lukewarm
[50:08] condition this formalism
[50:10] everything that moab represented is now
[50:12] still embodied in this orpah
[50:14] and he says why did she turn back
[50:16] because her mother-in-law discouraged
[50:18] her a little by saying to both of them
[50:20] saying now i'm too old to have children
[50:22] and if i would be married again and have
[50:23] children would you wait for them
[50:24] no go back to your mother's
[50:28] in comfort well that's the way
[50:31] with the lukewarm church member just the
[50:35] first little thing comes along
[50:36] they're discouraged and willing to turn
[50:39] back oh
[50:40] what a pity
[50:45] that's this condition of orpah type of
[50:48] the
[50:48] nominal church the formal church she can
[50:51] come to a place where she kisses naomi
[50:54] goodbye because it's naomi that's going
[50:56] to lead her
[50:57] it's naomi that knows the way but ruth
[51:01] cleaves to her orpah gives her the
[51:03] goodbye kiss and brother brahm is
[51:04] pointing out
[51:05] how this represents the lukewarm church
[51:07] member we're just a little bit of
[51:09] opposition a little bit of fear a little
[51:11] bit of
[51:11] pressure you know you could lose and
[51:13] you're going to lose things and may not
[51:14] be as rosy on the other side and
[51:17] oh you sure you want to do this and she
[51:18] turns back
[51:20] he says what a pity he visits this again
[51:23] and why little bethlehem
[51:26] he says in orpah one of her to her son's
[51:28] wives when she comes to look upon what
[51:30] she had to sacrifice
[51:31] so now it's in what you leave it's what
[51:33] you sacrifice being a type of the
[51:36] modern church you listening
[51:39] type of the modern church if i have to
[51:41] go over there
[51:42] i'll have to get away from my dances
[51:45] i'll have to get away from my big time
[51:47] and my social gatherings notice the
[51:50] metrics by which she measures
[51:52] the choice i'm being called i'm being
[51:54] pulled
[51:55] i'm being moved i'm willing to go out
[51:57] but as she gets closer and gets further
[51:59] away
[51:59] she's informed and apprised of what she
[52:02] has to lose he says the sacrifice
[52:04] and what does she think about social
[52:06] aspects
[52:07] the very things that brother branham
[52:09] identified in the beginning of how the
[52:10] bigger church spires and the
[52:12] and the bells ringing and how big they
[52:14] are and what they look like
[52:16] he's identifying it's just the social
[52:18] aspects
[52:20] that begin to work on the orpah and
[52:22] she's afraid to lose something socially
[52:27] not loving what she stands to gain
[52:30] spiritually
[52:32] and wouldn't this wouldn't the spiritual
[52:34] gain be worth losing everything in the
[52:36] world
[52:37] i if i lose all my friends i lose all my
[52:39] best friends i lose social opportunities
[52:41] i lose social status
[52:42] i lose position i lose my job i lose
[52:44] respect from everybody but yet i fall
[52:46] i'm following
[52:47] in god's will that's what matters
[52:52] because it'll happen to you in your life
[52:53] when you do what god wants you to do
[52:56] there's people that you thought would
[52:57] always be there standing by your
[53:00] side who won't even bother to return a
[53:02] phone call
[53:03] the people that you thought would be
[53:04] there your whole life sometimes
[53:06] disappear and you'll never even know
[53:08] because they won't bother to tell you
[53:11] why at the end of the day they may have
[53:13] disagreed with what you did but all you
[53:15] need to do is do what god asks you to do
[53:21] he says the social gatherings then she
[53:22] just wept and kissed her mother-in-law
[53:25] and returned back
[53:28] now again we're pondering this that's
[53:30] not you
[53:32] right is there an orpha here tonight
[53:35] oh but not only is there a roof here but
[53:38] there's you're all roofs
[53:41] so then what does orpah represent
[53:45] how how is her example
[53:48] what is it that what is the scripture
[53:52] bringing up what is part of this mystery
[53:54] that when we see it it draws us closer
[53:55] to god in this example of orpah
[53:59] it's the same spirit that collided with
[54:01] israel and the exodus
[54:05] now it's not just israel
[54:08] as a type of the church in her exodus
[54:11] now it's a gentile
[54:14] who's now giving this perfect
[54:16] brotherhood called it a perfect picture
[54:18] of the bride
[54:19] now she's coming out and she has a twin
[54:22] as it was or a sister a sister-in-law
[54:25] one that's starting out with her in the
[54:26] same place in the same state as
[54:28] here she is she's come out and now she
[54:30] personifies the spirit
[54:32] that collided with israel in their
[54:34] exodus and this is where you see the
[54:36] opposition
[54:39] brother braham says it in kinsmen
[54:40] redeemer
[54:43] and orpah a type of the lukewarm church
[54:46] that once started
[54:48] a type of the church that won't go all
[54:50] the way
[54:52] she said that sounds pretty good so she
[54:55] kissed her mother-in-law
[54:56] and return back that's a type of the
[54:59] lukewarm believer
[55:01] who will believe jesus to be christ and
[55:03] then turn around and go back into the
[55:05] things that she come out of
[55:08] so much that could be said on all the
[55:09] different levels that that may pertain
[55:11] to an individual
[55:12] to the man that'll stake the way with
[55:14] the lord's despised few
[55:16] and then turn around and go back like a
[55:18] dog to his vomit and a hog to his wallow
[55:21] as the bible says
[55:23] so yeah it's a despised few you begin
[55:25] you start out you seem to be on the
[55:26] right track
[55:27] but something begins to work just as
[55:29] lot's wife
[55:30] looked back for a moment and turned to a
[55:32] pillar of salt
[55:33] now it happens again in orpah she starts
[55:37] out and she turns back
[55:40] he says many times we return back to the
[55:42] gods of our beginning
[55:44] that make a good sermon title the gods
[55:46] of our beginning
[55:48] maybe we get we got eyes of lust after
[55:51] the wrong thing
[55:53] we turned back to lusting again maybe we
[55:55] got idols of drinking idols of smoking
[55:58] not meats idols of lying idols of
[56:00] stealing
[56:01] all kinds of idols
[56:04] it could be a cult of personality it
[56:06] could be a certain way things are done
[56:07] it could be a
[56:08] pet doctor and he says and then profess
[56:10] and be baptized
[56:12] and then turn again what a sad thing
[56:16] he said in redeemer redemption what a
[56:17] pity
[56:20] you remember it never spoke her name no
[56:23] more
[56:24] i'm gonna i want to read i think one
[56:27] more statement tonight
[56:28] after this one but i want this to kind
[56:31] of be
[56:31] the our connector to the next sermon
[56:34] notice
[56:35] it never spoke her name no more she was
[56:38] excommunicated because of her decision
[56:41] so there's an ex communication but it's
[56:44] not you
[56:46] it's orpah the lukewarm church the
[56:49] lukewarm believer as each believer
[56:51] represents the church every american
[56:52] represents america
[56:54] every german represents germany every
[56:56] christian represents christ
[56:57] here she turned her back to go back into
[57:00] the things she came out of
[57:02] so now she's represents the lukewarm
[57:04] believer she represents the formal
[57:05] church the gentile church the laodicean
[57:07] church age
[57:08] how that meant and he says even
[57:09] preachers sometimes will take the way of
[57:11] the lord
[57:12] and when you speak to them about the
[57:13] baptism holy spirit nonsense
[57:15] turn away from it that's orpah
[57:19] what's orpah orpah is the one who
[57:22] rejects the truth
[57:25] no matter how much they've received
[57:27] before when the word
[57:29] unfolds further she shows her colors
[57:31] when she rejects the unfolding of the
[57:33] word
[57:34] she could come all the way up to
[57:36] something and be in every single one of
[57:38] the paces
[57:39] but then denies jesus christ is the same
[57:41] in every detail
[57:42] except the physical body that's the seed
[57:45] of orpah
[57:47] when you can believe malachi 4 5 god
[57:49] sent a prophet
[57:50] the church order and the books and tapes
[57:52] and all these and believe all these
[57:54] things and then come all the way
[57:55] up to the third pool in the open of the
[57:57] word but deny that
[57:58] and he says that's orpah
[58:02] that that's the spirit he uses it and
[58:04] maybe in a very innocent way for us to
[58:06] say
[58:06] we believe the baptism of the holy
[58:08] spirit but think about any truth in
[58:09] god's word
[58:10] when you say that's nonsense and turn
[58:12] away from a further
[58:13] unfolding of the word of god that's
[58:16] orpah
[58:20] and something about
[58:24] orpah
[58:28] if they could just turn away and mind
[58:29] their own business
[58:33] maybe there would be no fight
[58:37] maybe there would be no opposition but
[58:39] that's just not the moabite way
[58:43] and brother brown uses this phrase it's
[58:44] later in this statement i was just
[58:46] reading from here in kinsman redeemer
[58:47] you can go back and look it up he says
[58:48] orpah
[58:50] lukewarm excommunicated
[58:54] he says she orpah was excommunicated
[58:57] because of her decision
[58:58] now i want to just for a moment and i'm
[59:01] going to read a statement from what was
[59:02] the holy ghost given for it hopefully
[59:03] ending on a high note
[59:05] i want just to put this in here and this
[59:07] is what i'm hoping to pick up on next
[59:09] wednesday night
[59:10] orpah is the one that's excommunicated
[59:14] we feel as ruth what do we feel many
[59:16] times that we're excommunicated we feel
[59:19] picked on and laughed at and
[59:21] you know people kind of look down on us
[59:22] and make fun of us and
[59:24] we feel the ones that are outcast but
[59:26] orpa's the one that's lukewarm
[59:28] orpa's the one that's excommunicated
[59:32] it's the shock now that as a result
[59:36] of the presence of the sun that
[59:39] begins to pull away from the seed
[59:43] so it's not it's not that the shucks in
[59:45] there and kind of pushes you out and
[59:47] you're just there on the ground going oh
[59:48] no what happened no the life
[59:50] enters into you and because that's where
[59:53] the life is the shuck just begins to
[59:55] wither away
[59:57] and as they with their way they're
[59:58] saying i hate you
[1:00:00] hey because you've got the life and
[1:00:02] there i'm melting
[1:00:05] and you've got the life and they just
[1:00:06] begin to wither away and so what do they
[1:00:07] begin to tell you i'm really the seed
[1:00:10] i'm really the bride you're not because
[1:00:14] i guess even in one sense as you begin
[1:00:15] to
[1:00:16] as the grain begins to bow down they
[1:00:17] might feel like they hold a little bit
[1:00:18] of higher position on the stock
[1:00:22] hey because they pull back and you're
[1:00:25] hanging out and they feel like well i'm
[1:00:26] still above you
[1:00:29] think about it i want you to ponder it i
[1:00:31] want you to think about these feelings
[1:00:33] we have sometimes
[1:00:34] the isolation the persecution the
[1:00:36] rejection the bride feels
[1:00:38] is not you being rejected as much as
[1:00:41] it's the word
[1:00:42] separating out orpah and you feel
[1:00:45] that separation could you imagine the
[1:00:47] emptiness that ruth might have felt she
[1:00:49] might have thought oh
[1:00:50] the providence of god that i would be
[1:00:52] able to leave with
[1:00:54] with uh with arpa who was there with me
[1:00:56] i was there for her when her husband
[1:00:58] died she was there with me
[1:01:00] when my husband died and this
[1:01:01] camaraderie we had and this closeness
[1:01:03] that we had and
[1:01:04] just the way that we confided into one
[1:01:05] another we fought battles together we're
[1:01:07] persevering together
[1:01:08] but now we're going further in this word
[1:01:10] and we're taking the next step
[1:01:12] and oh this is fearful oh i can't
[1:01:14] believe this or i can't believe we're
[1:01:15] doing this together
[1:01:16] and then all of a sudden as you cleave
[1:01:19] and you've already made up your mind and
[1:01:20] you
[1:01:21] you have it in your heart you're going
[1:01:22] to say oh naomi i'll go
[1:01:24] anywhere you go your god will be my god
[1:01:27] your people be my people this word is
[1:01:29] the truth every single bit of it
[1:01:31] i believe i believe that all seals are
[1:01:34] opened
[1:01:35] and are ready for me to receive i
[1:01:38] believe it and as you're there cleaving
[1:01:40] to naomi and you feel that orpah's right
[1:01:42] there with you to think oh god in this
[1:01:45] there's three of us together we're going
[1:01:46] to be going back all of a sudden you
[1:01:48] notice something begins to change
[1:01:50] and it's orphan that kisses and begins
[1:01:52] to walk away
[1:01:53] and you don't think that ruth begins to
[1:01:55] feel some sort of
[1:01:56] maybe she begins to internalize am i
[1:01:58] doing something wrong well i'm related
[1:02:00] to her that's family am i
[1:02:01] i mean what now i have to choose i mean
[1:02:04] i only
[1:02:05] this is my mother-in-law and and this is
[1:02:07] one of my blood from my own
[1:02:09] nation and my own people and she begins
[1:02:11] to experience these
[1:02:12] wrestlings and these trials within
[1:02:14] herself what ruth is feeling is not
[1:02:16] because she's rejected
[1:02:18] but because orpah's excommunicated
[1:02:24] it's the lukewarm make-believer orpah
[1:02:26] lukewarm excommunicated the one that
[1:02:28] says nonsense and turns away from it
[1:02:31] that's the one that's rejected not the
[1:02:33] believer
[1:02:37] musicians if you could please come let
[1:02:40] me just remind you these are the
[1:02:42] circumstances
[1:02:44] of ruth's exodus
[1:02:48] this is how roof had to leave
[1:02:51] and if she types the bride
[1:02:55] then it's a type of our challenge today
[1:02:56] what ruth had to go through
[1:02:58] and you're sitting there going where in
[1:03:00] the world are you getting this brand
[1:03:02] my goodness this is just we just read it
[1:03:04] right here and all it says is that or
[1:03:06] kister where in the world are you
[1:03:08] getting this the prophets taught us
[1:03:11] he taught us what moab represented
[1:03:14] he teaches us what orpah represents it's
[1:03:17] the
[1:03:17] lukewarm gentile church
[1:03:21] and he's taught us all these things so i
[1:03:23] just look right into the message and say
[1:03:25] all right if that's who orpah is then
[1:03:28] you start looking at that church
[1:03:30] in its modern terms and how it fits with
[1:03:32] the bride you find
[1:03:34] she's the one that hates the believer
[1:03:37] that's where the persecution comes from
[1:03:40] i know
[1:03:40] i know i get it we're all afraid of
[1:03:42] antifa
[1:03:44] right we're going to come burn our
[1:03:45] message bibles they're going to take
[1:03:46] away our scofield
[1:03:49] we're all afraid of what they're going
[1:03:50] to do to shut down message churches but
[1:03:52] you ever realize that the real stigma
[1:03:55] and the real pressure you feel when you
[1:03:58] walk in truth
[1:04:00] it's not an unbeliever
[1:04:02] [Music]
[1:04:04] it's it's not it's not the it's not the
[1:04:07] liberals it's not the democrats
[1:04:10] it's not the evangelicals but really if
[1:04:12] they found out what you believed they'd
[1:04:13] probably ridicule you a little bit
[1:04:15] but it always hits real close to home
[1:04:20] sometimes it's the closest people to you
[1:04:26] brother branham says and what was the
[1:04:27] holy ghost given for in the days of ruth
[1:04:29] and the laws of redemption
[1:04:31] when naomi left the country because of
[1:04:33] trials hard times
[1:04:36] she went into the moabite land
[1:04:41] which were just lukewarm nominal
[1:04:42] christians because the moabites came
[1:04:45] from the daughter of lot
[1:04:47] and they were so-called believers and
[1:04:49] mixed up
[1:04:50] now remember ruth was one of them
[1:04:54] was that one of us at one time he says
[1:04:57] and her husband died and her sons died
[1:05:00] and on the road home naomi
[1:05:02] on a road home one of her
[1:05:03] daughter-in-law's orpah she said that
[1:05:05] she would return
[1:05:06] back to her country to her gods and to
[1:05:08] her church
[1:05:09] and to her people
[1:05:13] naomi tried to get ruth to go back
[1:05:17] but she said your people are my people
[1:05:20] your god is my god
[1:05:22] where you die there i'll die where
[1:05:25] you're buried there i'll be buried
[1:05:27] and i'll not turn back
[1:05:31] this is used as a wedding vow
[1:05:35] this is used to describe the heart of a
[1:05:37] of
[1:05:38] a bride on the day of her wedding and
[1:05:41] her attitude towards her groom
[1:05:42] as she formalizes this this union and
[1:05:45] this marriage
[1:05:46] it's often used to say that i as your
[1:05:48] wife is your wife to be as your fiance
[1:05:50] as the bride here on my wedding day your
[1:05:52] god will be my god your people will be
[1:05:54] my people wherever you go to church i'll
[1:05:56] go to church where you work i'll support
[1:05:58] you
[1:05:58] and there's this complete abandonment to
[1:06:00] the vision of the man
[1:06:01] these words were not spoken of a woman
[1:06:04] who's going to be joined to a husband
[1:06:06] who has the hope of a new beginning and
[1:06:08] seed coming forth and redemption in
[1:06:10] marriage and redemption and childbirth
[1:06:12] this is coming for a woman that is
[1:06:14] widowed promising another widow that
[1:06:16] shall go back to a land that was just
[1:06:18] famished with the hope that maybe
[1:06:20] there's something there
[1:06:22] do you realize what kind of vow and
[1:06:24] pronouncement this was
[1:06:25] this is not one that has a bunch of
[1:06:27] contingencies this is not one that did
[1:06:29] the research
[1:06:30] and read everything that was in the mls
[1:06:32] list and said this is a good deal this
[1:06:34] is gold there's a lot of good pictures
[1:06:35] there's a lot of amenities didn't read
[1:06:37] all the reviews on yelp and say yeah
[1:06:39] this will take care of what we're
[1:06:40] looking for
[1:06:41] no she went with the vision in her heart
[1:06:45] with the feeling that this is what's
[1:06:46] right this is what i must do
[1:06:49] and even in the face of bigger things
[1:06:51] and better things and more glorious
[1:06:53] things and
[1:06:54] more what would seem to be more powerful
[1:06:56] things and then her confidant and her
[1:06:59] friend leaving
[1:07:03] she says i your people whoever they are
[1:07:06] will be my people
[1:07:07] your god is my god but i said that's
[1:07:11] when a person's caught
[1:07:13] a vision don't make any difference what
[1:07:18] her people said
[1:07:20] didn't matter what her family said
[1:07:21] didn't matter what her friend said
[1:07:23] didn't matter what everyone was saying
[1:07:24] notice brother branham is the one that
[1:07:25] identifies the opposition
[1:07:27] coming from the moabite the opposition
[1:07:30] coming from the example of orpah the
[1:07:32] opposition coming from those
[1:07:33] that are the closest to ruth you're
[1:07:34] going over there and becoming a holy
[1:07:36] roller or something
[1:07:39] that didn't make any difference to ruth
[1:07:42] there was a purpose of god to be
[1:07:44] fulfilled
[1:07:46] and just as sure as you're hungering
[1:07:48] tonight for the holy spirit
[1:07:50] it's something in you pulling you
[1:07:53] that a purpose of god in your life has
[1:07:56] got to be fulfilled
[1:07:58] just like it was with ruth
[1:08:01] oh can you identify brother loyal can
[1:08:03] you identify brother joel can you
[1:08:05] identify with the believers
[1:08:08] that this is something in my heart
[1:08:11] doesn't make any
[1:08:12] difference to me the purpose of god for
[1:08:14] my life must be fulfilled
[1:08:17] and i'm hungry for something tonight
[1:08:19] it's something that's pulling me
[1:08:21] what is it it's the purpose of god for
[1:08:23] me
[1:08:24] i won't i won't talk bad about orpah i
[1:08:27] won't want to orphan down
[1:08:28] i'll give her a blessing i'll tell her
[1:08:30] to go i'll tell her to thrive i'll tell
[1:08:32] her to rest
[1:08:33] i'll tell her to go find her husband
[1:08:35] where she believes she belongs
[1:08:37] but as for me i must fulfill the purpose
[1:08:40] of god
[1:08:40] in my life i can only walk in the vision
[1:08:44] that god has for me
[1:08:47] just as it was in ruth i have to walk
[1:08:50] this way
[1:08:52] can you personally identify with it
[1:08:54] tonight i'm talking to each one of you
[1:08:56] as individuals boy and girl and man and
[1:08:58] woman married or single
[1:09:00] whatever your circumstance may be
[1:09:02] tonight i believe that god has called
[1:09:04] you
[1:09:04] in the type of roof and you're having to
[1:09:07] walk this path
[1:09:08] maybe most of us tonight can stand in
[1:09:11] the presence of our boaz
[1:09:13] in the presence of our redeemer knowing
[1:09:15] that we are now the impregnated bride of
[1:09:17] jesus christ
[1:09:18] and just look back and see what he has
[1:09:21] done
[1:09:22] and what we've gone through and how we
[1:09:24] left moab we we
[1:09:25] were opposed by our sister-in-law but
[1:09:28] here we are today and we can say thank
[1:09:30] you god
[1:09:31] there's a great purpose in my life
[1:09:34] we can rejoice and thank god for it
[1:09:38] but oh i think it would be wonderful if
[1:09:41] we could catch the attention of a ruth
[1:09:42] in her journey
[1:09:45] and help her on the way because there's
[1:09:48] good ground coming
[1:09:50] there's better things in store let's

[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:49] on a wednesday night sir
[1:11:55] an hour 15 minutes
[1:11:56] [Music]
[1:11:58] but it feels like eternity lord
[1:12:02] feels so free and unbound
[1:12:06] it feels supernatural
[1:12:10] without the perspective of seconds and
[1:12:13] minutes it just feels
[1:12:16] present that's what eternity is it's
[1:12:19] just present
[1:12:22] i pray lord that if there be any lifting
[1:12:24] or reviving now in our spirits may
[1:12:26] we take advantage of this opportunity to
[1:12:28] come boldly before your throne of grace
[1:12:31] to ask to receive from you what we have
[1:12:34] need of
[1:12:36] if we identify with ruth in this story
[1:12:39] and we identify in particular with ruth
[1:12:43] not orpha not naomi not muhammad or
[1:12:46] killian or elimelech
[1:12:48] but we identify with ruth if that's our
[1:12:50] faith lord
[1:12:52] then no matter where we are if we're in
[1:12:54] moabite
[1:12:56] if we're if we if we have a dead husband
[1:13:00] if we're just hearing about a message
[1:13:02] and a land lord
[1:13:04] we know how the story ends
[1:13:07] we know what we're coming to may that
[1:13:10] give us courage lord
[1:13:12] may that give us faith to believe all
[1:13:14] things are possible
[1:13:16] what i pray for the people tonight
[1:13:18] who've been disciplined
[1:13:19] beyond discipline lord they've been
[1:13:21] faithful they've been attentive
[1:13:23] they've pulled upon this i pray that you
[1:13:26] bless them and strengthen them
[1:13:28] give them courage lord
[1:13:32] and be their portion answer their
[1:13:35] prayers father i pray
