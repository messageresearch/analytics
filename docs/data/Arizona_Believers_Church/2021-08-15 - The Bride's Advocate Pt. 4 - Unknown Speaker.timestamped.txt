[0:02] so in acts chapter 7 we'll start with
[0:04] verse 44 we'll
[0:06] read the verse 49
[0:08] we've been ministering on a subject of
[0:10] the bride's advocate
[0:13] and we've it's been a few services that
[0:15] we've spent on this subject and we felt
[0:17] very impressed um to take at least one
[0:21] more service in this
[0:22] area
[0:23] and
[0:24] maybe putting just another coat of paint
[0:27] over the subject and even over the what
[0:29] we administered last weekend
[0:32] and really what's been burning in my
[0:33] heart is to emphasize really the
[0:35] fullness of what we have in the advocate
[0:38] just really to understand the fullness
[0:39] of it
[0:40] and in a lot of ways the fullness of the
[0:42] atonement because john in first john
[0:44] chapter 2 verse 1 he says we have an
[0:46] advocate with the father and then he
[0:49] says it's jesus christ the righteous and
[0:51] then he connects him with the
[0:51] perpetuation which is the same word in
[0:54] the old new testament from mercy
[0:57] and so really we can kind of see those
[0:59] two roles working together uh we don't
[1:01] have a divided christ where he's
[1:03] pleading for our sins on one hand and
[1:05] then trying to encourage us on the other
[1:07] the very one that purchased your
[1:09] salvation purchased
[1:11] paid redemptions claims he's the very
[1:13] one that advocates for you he's the one
[1:15] that's on the inside of you
[1:17] and so let's just look at verse 44.
[1:19] we'll read the verse 49 here in acts
[1:21] chapter 7.
[1:23] our fathers had the tabernacle of
[1:25] witness in the wilderness as he had
[1:28] appointed speaking unto moses that he
[1:30] should make it according to the fashion
[1:32] that he had seen
[1:34] which also our fathers that came after
[1:36] brought in with jesus into the
[1:39] possession of the gentiles whom god
[1:42] drave out before the face of our fathers
[1:44] unto the days of david
[1:46] who found favor before god and desired
[1:48] to find a tabernacle for the god of
[1:50] jacob but solomon built him a house so
[1:53] just kind of if you notice kind of the
[1:54] tracking here the tabernacle of witness
[1:57] in the wilderness and then now david
[1:59] desired to build a house solomon builds
[2:02] that house it's the temple and then this
[2:04] great question which is posed in isaiah
[2:06] as well how be it the most high dwelleth
[2:08] not in temples made with hands as saith
[2:11] the prophet
[2:12] heaven is my throne and earth is my
[2:15] footstool
[2:16] what house will you build me
[2:18] say if the lord or what is the place of
[2:22] my rest what house will you build me and
[2:24] what is
[2:25] the place of my rest god bless you you
[2:28] can be seated
[2:30] this
[2:31] uh this morning and
[2:33] i feel like maybe i'm a little bit more
[2:35] of a box up here can't really hear
[2:36] myself very much but as long as i can
[2:38] hear your amens i think i'll be okay
[2:40] um
[2:41] and uh we just give you the liberty to
[2:43] do that as as you are believers with the
[2:46] holy spirit then what you do is you you
[2:48] amen what you know to be the truth not
[2:50] just what the preacher tells you to amen
[2:51] you amen what you know to be the truth
[2:54] i want to share several things in the
[2:56] outset about
[2:57] the advocate that's kind of summary kind
[2:59] of picking up some of the things that
[3:00] we've ministered on
[3:02] and we found that in the message what is
[3:04] the holy ghost that brother branham
[3:05] takes that that word advocate and he
[3:08] really takes it and just amplifies it by
[3:10] connecting it with the comforter in in
[3:13] uh when jesus is speaking i'll give you
[3:15] the father will send you the comforter
[3:16] it's the very same word so it's the same
[3:18] ministry it's the same it's the same
[3:20] office and brother branham just goes
[3:22] through all these different things that
[3:24] the comforter is that the advocate is
[3:26] also he's a guide and he goes through
[3:28] each one of those things
[3:30] and what we're looking at is how that
[3:31] our atonement
[3:33] our advocate is our atonement uh the
[3:35] same one that advocates for us is
[3:37] connected with the perpetuation so he is
[3:39] a mediator he is a comforter he is a
[3:41] teacher he is a guide he is a supporter
[3:43] these are all the things that the holy
[3:45] spirit is to the believer
[3:47] and we find in the scripture and brother
[3:49] brahma is just very very deliberate in
[3:51] the way that he phrases these things how
[3:53] that our atonement
[3:55] as our atonement christ becomes our
[3:56] mediator and so he fulfills this role as
[3:59] one that was mediating for us when we
[4:01] were in our sins he's the intercessor
[4:03] and it's by his blood as the scripture
[4:05] tells us in the new testament it's by
[4:07] his blood that we are reconciled to god
[4:10] and so this is the ministry that christ
[4:12] had to reconcile us back to god and in
[4:15] using that language of reconciliation
[4:18] the writer is
[4:19] intentionally connecting jesus with what
[4:22] the old testament sacrifices were
[4:24] symbolizing what they were foreshadowing
[4:26] and what they were pointing to because
[4:28] they were all done to show a type
[4:30] and so we understand what we were
[4:33] emphasizing last time is we understand
[4:35] the role that christ plays as a
[4:37] sacrifice for the salvation of the elect
[4:41] and that role that he plays in that
[4:42] position but what we want him to
[4:44] recognize more fully and understand more
[4:46] deeply is how that our advocate is a
[4:48] mediator within our hearts
[4:51] that it's he's just not a bloody lamb up
[4:53] there somewhere in some other dimension
[4:55] that wow if we only knew where that was
[4:56] if we could only get there and we're
[4:57] just kind of imagining a literal bloody
[5:00] person that stands before the father and
[5:03] every time we make a mistake he's trying
[5:04] to say well just forgive them they don't
[5:06] know what they're doing
[5:08] he is a mediator even within our hearts
[5:11] and so he's interceding to support us
[5:13] emotionally
[5:14] he's intervening to support us a
[5:16] mentally and spiritually he's there to
[5:18] give us strength and to encourage us and
[5:20] to lift us up
[5:21] and so we understand the one role that
[5:23] he plays but there's this other other
[5:26] part that comes with the atonement
[5:27] there's other parts that come with him
[5:29] being an advocate and in hebrews chapter
[5:31] 7 where we read from verse 44 just prior
[5:34] to that it's in verse 22
[5:36] he says that jesus was made a surety of
[5:39] a better testament
[5:40] so he's made a guarantee of it he's the
[5:42] guarantor he's the surety of a better
[5:46] testament so we can see we understand
[5:49] scripturally we understand how we can
[5:50] see the bloody lamb before the father
[5:52] for the forgiveness of our sins but when
[5:55] paul begins to take that picture and
[5:57] expand it and cause the jews to look at
[6:00] what they had under the law and what
[6:02] they had under the first covenant and
[6:03] get them to consider what they now have
[6:06] under the new covenant he in the book of
[6:08] hebrews places christ not just as a high
[6:11] priest before the father but he actually
[6:13] places him as a high priest in our
[6:15] hearts
[6:16] that if he was if he's at the right hand
[6:18] of the majesty interceding on our behalf
[6:21] we are raised by the baptismal he goes
[6:24] into heavenly places in christ jesus so
[6:26] the believer is setting there as well so
[6:29] the intercession isn't he's a third
[6:31] party who's gone in and we're kind of
[6:33] wringing our hands oh i hope this works
[6:35] out in my favor i hope he comes out with
[6:37] good news we're right there with it
[6:39] it's something that we benefit from
[6:41] present tense immediately having this
[6:44] one who's in our hearts
[6:46] and so christ dwell in our hearts is the
[6:48] security of a better testament he is the
[6:51] pledge he is the mediator of god's
[6:53] promises
[6:54] we can draw from that we can get support
[6:56] from that
[6:57] and as we were closing on last time this
[6:59] place
[7:00] of mediation is not behind a curtain
[7:03] it's not behind a veil of skin animal
[7:06] skins as it was in the old in the old
[7:08] covenant but now with the blood upon our
[7:11] souls this place of mediation is coming
[7:13] from within us
[7:16] as brother branham said in the
[7:17] revelations chapter 4 part 2 this is in
[7:20] the sermon 24 elders
[7:22] he says now the first throne was in
[7:23] heaven and this is where i want to kind
[7:25] of go back and see these images in
[7:26] scripture now the first throne was in
[7:29] heaven judgment see the second throne
[7:31] was in christ the third throne is in man
[7:35] so there was one in heaven then we see
[7:37] this throne in christ and he says this
[7:39] third throne is in man
[7:42] then he says the the very very next
[7:44] weekend as he continues on revelations
[7:46] chapter four he's preaching part three
[7:48] he calls this subtitled the throne of
[7:50] mercy and these are the sermons he
[7:52] preached uh that we draw that he draw
[7:54] called the revelation of jesus christ
[7:55] series that became a lot of the
[7:58] substance of the church age book
[8:00] and he says the mercy seats in the heart
[8:03] now this is one way of looking at this
[8:05] the mercy seat is in the heart the seat
[8:08] where the shining forth of his glory in
[8:11] all of his children the shekinah glory
[8:13] in the human heart
[8:15] now i really just want to amplify that i
[8:17] don't really want to leave that image
[8:19] brother adam is saying that there is if
[8:21] we see this role and because there's a
[8:24] way that we begin to think immediately
[8:26] that there's a literal seat and as long
[8:28] as there's some christ as a bloody lamb
[8:31] is sitting in that literal seat uh then
[8:33] that's when there's mercy so then all of
[8:35] a sudden we can have this paradox where
[8:37] rain begins to lock up a little bit
[8:38] because wait wait a minute the mercy
[8:40] seats in my heart and then if he's in my
[8:42] heart then and then or i have a mercy
[8:44] seat and as long as he's there then
[8:46] everyone can be saved
[8:48] and then also think oh wow you know i'm
[8:50] walking around and christ everyone who
[8:52] walks stands before me when i'm at the
[8:53] grocery store do you realize you're
[8:55] standing before the mercy seat i could
[8:57] condemn you right now
[8:58] that's not the way that we carry that
[9:00] image
[9:01] and a lot of times it's just from a
[9:02] misunderstanding of what these things
[9:04] represented or maybe carrying a type a
[9:06] little bit too far but this is very real
[9:09] this is what brother branham says he
[9:11] says the mercy seat is in the heart of
[9:13] man and he relates it to the shekinah
[9:15] glory in the human heart i just think of
[9:18] that phrase there's a kind of glory in a
[9:21] human heart now if you were to go back
[9:23] to when they began to build this
[9:24] tabernacle of witnesses the scripture
[9:26] says our fathers had the tabernacle of
[9:28] witness in the wilderness and let's say
[9:30] that we went back there and we're
[9:31] talking to these fathers that paul's
[9:33] talking about and you said hey the
[9:35] shekinah glory is in my heart they
[9:37] always say you're completely mad
[9:40] you're offering strange fire buddy
[9:41] because that would be it would be
[9:43] completely against everything that they
[9:45] could conceive or imagine but brother
[9:48] brown's place in the kind of glory now
[9:50] within the human heart he's saying
[9:52] that's where the mercy seat is the mercy
[9:54] seats in the heart of man
[9:55] now he says this just several paragraphs
[9:58] later in the same sermon we're living in
[10:00] another age glory oh i love this age
[10:03] it's not the age of literal sacrifices
[10:05] could you imagine if we were still
[10:07] living in that former age there's
[10:09] certain feasts that required travel to
[10:11] jerusalem and if we were real believers
[10:14] we would have to go to jerusalem
[10:17] and what a quandary some of us would be
[10:18] in right now we have we'd if we had to
[10:20] go to jerusalem we're real believers
[10:22] right so we're going to go whether
[10:23] whatever the word says to do we're going
[10:25] to do it so we're going to have to go to
[10:26] jerusalem and you find out you need a
[10:27] vaccine to go to jerusalem and then
[10:29] you're in a quandary then right well to
[10:32] obey god i got to go to jerusalem but
[10:33] man now i got to get a vaccine i got to
[10:35] wear a mask and you realize you know if
[10:37] we had to be in jerusalem if we were
[10:39] under the old covenant we would have to
[10:41] travel to jerusalem because there was
[10:43] only some things that could be done in a
[10:45] particular location so when brother
[10:47] brahma says oh we're living in another
[10:48] age he says i love this age listen
[10:50] there's a lot of reasons why we can love
[10:51] it
[10:52] but this most beautiful part he says god
[10:54] has a mercy seat today
[11:31] okay
[11:44] there's no ark of the covenant there
[11:46] there's no shekinah glory behind that
[11:48] old covenant behind that that curtain
[11:50] behind that veil but now on the day of
[11:53] pentecost that shekinah glory returns
[11:56] comes back upon the people and is
[11:58] dwelling in human hearts
[12:00] so then for us the comfort that's when
[12:01] the comforter was given the comforter is
[12:04] our advocate so the comforter advocate
[12:06] dwells within our soul
[12:09] this advocacy now it's not adversarial
[12:12] we don't have him so that he can reason
[12:14] with things and and plead with others
[12:16] and
[12:16] and plead on our behalf with others but
[12:18] this is an advocacy within ourselves for
[12:21] our strength
[12:22] and christ lays this out when he speaks
[12:24] to the disciples he's saying because
[12:26] this persecution is coming because this
[12:28] difficulty is coming i'm going to give
[12:30] you a comforter because you believe in
[12:32] me because you love me and want to keep
[12:34] my commandments i'm going to give you a
[12:36] power and a life on the inside of you
[12:39] that will cause you to walk in my
[12:40] commandments that will cause you to do
[12:42] the things that i teach you to do he'll
[12:44] bring all these things to remembrance
[12:46] he'll he'll build these things up within
[12:48] your heart so the advocate is there for
[12:50] your perfection
[12:52] the advocate is there for your strength
[12:55] in john chapter 14 he says that he the
[12:57] spirit of truth which is the comforter
[12:59] will abide with you and dwell in you
[13:01] forever it says it'll teach us all
[13:03] things it'll bring all things to our
[13:05] remembrance just kind of re reminding us
[13:07] of these things this morning
[13:09] he says in john chapter 15 that the
[13:11] comforter which is the spirit of truth
[13:13] testifies of jesus christ where within
[13:16] us
[13:17] within our hearts it testifies of jesus
[13:19] christ and because the holy ghost
[13:21] witnesses to our spirit and testifies of
[13:24] jesus christ that makes us witnesses of
[13:27] what we've heard
[13:29] and so that he has to be on the inside
[13:31] the holy spirit the spirit of truth is
[13:32] witnessing to you of jesus christ and
[13:34] then that makes you a true witness
[13:38] in john chapter 16 he says that the
[13:40] comforter which is the spirit of truth
[13:41] which is the advocate which is the holy
[13:43] ghost guides us into all truth
[13:46] it reveals things that have not yet
[13:48] happened things to come it glorifies
[13:50] jesus christ it receives jesus christ it
[13:54] reveals jesus christ this is who the
[13:56] advocate is the advocate on the side is
[13:59] what tells you when the letter is being
[14:00] preached
[14:01] you can receive that truth it's what
[14:03] reveals to you where christ is hidden
[14:06] this is all the things that this
[14:08] advocate does
[14:09] romans chapter 8 it tells us that he
[14:11] helps us in our infirmities and our
[14:13] weaknesses making intercession for us
[14:16] but where is this place of intercession
[14:19] where is this ministry of mediation
[14:21] where is this transpiring not in another
[14:23] dimension but even within our hearts
[14:27] as brother bam says god is on his heart
[14:30] in the heart of man is the throne of god
[14:34] we think of mediation we think of
[14:36] intercession we think of the third party
[14:37] that goes before the judge we think of
[14:39] somebody who's advocating for someone in
[14:41] court and we think of an attorney we
[14:43] think of a representative we think of
[14:45] this ah
[14:46] this forensic process where something is
[14:48] being investigated and being examined
[14:50] and we have one that would come and meet
[14:52] in a formal tribunal to defend or to
[14:55] represent as a way of of exonerating
[14:57] somebody but god is on the throne of a
[15:00] man's heart he says you get it man god
[15:03] made his throne in the heart of man
[15:06] now we're familiar with this teaching
[15:08] right we're familiar that brother
[15:10] branham takes these things and he places
[15:12] these things throughout his ministry and
[15:14] his teaching that god there is a throne
[15:16] there's a representation of the throne
[15:18] of god within the heart of man
[15:21] and so the throne of god is also
[15:23] represented in man's heart now
[15:26] the mercy seat as he was the scripture
[15:29] says he was a perpetuation
[15:31] a lot of the scriptures we've read in
[15:32] hebrews and even this image of the
[15:34] throne we talk about the throne this is
[15:36] what uh this holy of holies represented
[15:40] in the old testament
[15:41] and so the mercy seat in the old
[15:43] testament was a place of atonement
[15:47] and this is i know review for all of us
[15:49] here
[15:50] it was sprinkled
[15:52] seven times on the day of atonement by
[15:54] the high priest
[15:56] and when he went in there and sprinkled
[15:57] the mercy seat with the blood of the
[15:59] sacrifice seven times
[16:01] on the day of atonement it symbolized it
[16:03] was a symbol of israel being reconciled
[16:06] to god
[16:07] it was a symbol of it if it had
[16:09] literally done it then then there
[16:11] wouldn't have been this promise of one
[16:13] to come
[16:14] and so it was representing the one
[16:16] sacrifice that came and was given once
[16:18] and for all
[16:20] so it was a symbol of reconciliation
[16:23] now where this mercy seat was located in
[16:25] the holy of holies
[16:27] is within the tabernacle as we read it
[16:29] they the our fathers had the tabernacle
[16:32] of witness in the wilderness and the
[16:34] tabernacle in the wilderness was
[16:36] patterned after god's throne in heaven
[16:39] is that is that not what we're taught
[16:40] we'll look at this in the scripture so
[16:42] brother adam said the first throne was
[16:44] in heaven so that's the first throne and
[16:47] then the very tabernacle in the
[16:49] wilderness that moses sets up is
[16:51] patterned after the throne of god
[16:54] now what i'm gonna what i'm gonna do now
[16:56] for several moments
[16:58] is look at this tabernacle that was in
[17:00] heaven and how it was represented in the
[17:02] old testament under the first covenant
[17:05] and so this first throne in heaven then
[17:07] is symbolized and represented in the old
[17:10] testament in the tabernacle but remember
[17:13] what we where we just left is brother
[17:15] branham said the throne of god is in the
[17:17] heart of man
[17:18] so the third throne is in the heart of
[17:20] man so you have the first throne in
[17:22] heaven just using this
[17:24] uh nomenclature the way that he lined it
[17:26] out you have first throne in heaven
[17:27] second throne in christ third thrown in
[17:29] the heart of man so now we're gonna look
[17:31] at the type of this which is the
[17:32] tabernacle in the wilderness but don't
[17:34] lose sight of where the throne of god is
[17:35] today in man
[17:38] and so in revelations chapter 11 verse
[17:40] 19
[17:41] it says and the temple of god was opened
[17:44] in heaven now this is we're just looking
[17:46] at this for image sake we're just
[17:47] looking at this for what john takes uh
[17:50] has witness of and the temple of god was
[17:53] opened in heaven and there was seen in
[17:55] his temple god's temple the ark of his
[17:58] testament now this is a very
[18:00] extraordinary uh scene for to a jew to
[18:03] an israelite where the
[18:05] the the ark of the covenant had been
[18:07] lost and some say that jeremiah hid it
[18:09] and and some say that was placed here
[18:11] buried there and they have these
[18:12] different um theologies as to where the
[18:14] ark of the covenant would be but now it
[18:17] appears in heaven and they see the ark
[18:19] of his testament in god's temple in the
[18:22] temple of god it says and there were
[18:23] lightnings and voices and thunderings
[18:25] and an earthquake and great hell
[18:28] and there's certainly a lot there in
[18:30] that scripture that could be expounded
[18:32] upon especially within context and what
[18:34] it represents but see this image that
[18:36] john sees now the temple of god is
[18:39] opened up so he could see the temple of
[18:41] god and when he sees the temple he sees
[18:43] in the temple the ark of his testament
[18:47] that's the ark of the covenant that's
[18:49] the very ark of the covenant that was
[18:51] placed within the holy of holies that
[18:52] was in the tabernacle in the wilderness
[18:56] and paul writes in hebrews chapter eight
[18:58] verse five i think it's important maybe
[18:59] to notice that chapter
[19:01] hebrews chapter eight verse five talk
[19:03] about the elements of that tabernacle
[19:05] talking about the elements even of the
[19:06] temple who serve unto the example and
[19:09] shadow of heavenly things
[19:11] so the things in the tabernacle of
[19:13] witness were a shadow of heavenly things
[19:16] as moses was admonished of god when he
[19:19] was about to make the tabernacle for see
[19:21] saith he that thou make all things
[19:24] according to the pattern showed to thee
[19:26] in the mount and this is repeated over
[19:29] and over again make it after what i
[19:31] showed you in the mount make it after
[19:32] what i showed you in the mount and
[19:34] what's beautiful is in revelation we see
[19:37] that what moses was shown in the mount
[19:40] was a heavenly image
[19:41] he's shown what was in heaven and then
[19:43] paul even
[19:45] shares this with us in hebrews so that
[19:46] we know what moses saw in the mount was
[19:49] an image that god showed them in heaven
[19:52] then hebrews chapter 9 verse 23 it was
[19:55] therefore necessary that the pattern of
[19:57] things in heaven should be purified with
[20:00] these but the heavenly things themselves
[20:02] with better sacrifices than these so the
[20:05] elements of the tabernacle in the
[20:06] wilderness the tabernacle of witness
[20:09] that moses established and set up he saw
[20:12] an image in heaven now he's going to
[20:14] replicate that on earth through this
[20:16] symbol of the tabernacle and in order to
[20:18] use certain things in the tabernacle
[20:20] they had to be sanctified
[20:22] and and
[20:23] consecrated by sacrifice so he's saying
[20:26] if the pattern of things in heaven had
[20:28] to be purified he says the heavenly
[20:30] things themselves are purified or made
[20:32] holy with a better sacrifice
[20:35] so again the images moses saw what was
[20:37] in heaven the same thing that john sees
[20:39] the temple of god with the ark of his
[20:41] covenant the ark of his testament in it
[20:44] now brother branham takes it and so we
[20:45] just see all these witnesses lining up
[20:47] in revelations chapter 4 part 2 the
[20:50] sermon 24 elders as we've already quoted
[20:52] from it
[20:53] he said that was god's throne in heaven
[20:57] moses patterned it on earth
[20:59] now notice the language the brother
[21:00] random is using that there was god's
[21:03] throne in heaven moses saw that throne
[21:05] and built the tabernacle now brother man
[21:07] said god's throne is in heaven moses
[21:09] patterned on earth was god's throne
[21:11] because his judgment seat was
[21:13] represented here on earth in the holy of
[21:16] holies
[21:18] so this is where the judgment seat comes
[21:20] this is where the throne comes it comes
[21:23] into that place the holy of holies all
[21:26] israel come to that one place to find
[21:28] mercy because god only met under the
[21:31] shed blood
[21:32] so that was the only place that israel
[21:34] could find that god that god was there
[21:37] in that his presence was there in behind
[21:39] that curtain he was there in the in
[21:41] behind even the skins that failed uh the
[21:44] holy place and these different things
[21:46] these different courts of the temple
[21:48] they would see that god is identifying
[21:50] himself there and that's where they
[21:51] would know that they had found mercy
[21:55] with all these sacrifices they'd come to
[21:56] one place they all looked to one place
[21:58] for that you just couldn't run off and
[22:00] go sacrifice somewhere and find this
[22:03] there was only one place that it was and
[22:04] brother said god's throne is represented
[22:08] in this tabernacle of witness in the
[22:11] holy of holies
[22:13] he says the very next week now
[22:14] revelations chapter 4 part 3
[22:17] he says moses was taken up into heaven
[22:20] moses taken from the earth up into
[22:22] heaven and saw the altar of god it says
[22:26] and when he descended from the presence
[22:27] of god god god told moses make
[22:30] everything on earth as patterned after
[22:33] heaven
[22:34] now then when he did he made the ark of
[22:37] the covenant
[22:39] there's this is a the ark of the
[22:41] testament that john saw in revelations
[22:43] 19. he says to make the ark and the
[22:45] covenant he put two cherubim to guard
[22:47] the ark the throne guards the two cherub
[22:51] cherubims
[22:52] now they guard the mercy seat when god
[22:55] is in a shekinah glory
[22:57] so where is god at on the mercy seat
[23:00] that's where the shekinah glory is on
[23:02] the mercy seat and then there's this
[23:03] cherubim that guard the mercy seat he
[23:06] says where was the shekinah glory at the
[23:09] mercy seat they guard that shekinah
[23:12] glory
[23:12] now if you can if you're if you're just
[23:14] kind of tracking
[23:16] the these uh
[23:17] these principles we've already
[23:19] identified that the shekinah glory comes
[23:22] to dwell within a man's heart
[23:24] and he's taking these very same elements
[23:26] in the very same series of sermons in
[23:28] the very same sunday that he's saying
[23:30] that the mercy seat is in the heart of
[23:31] man he's describing an image in heaven
[23:34] and how it's represented on earth and he
[23:36] says where was the kind of glory at the
[23:38] mercy seat and then there was these
[23:40] elements that guarded that were set as a
[23:42] guard over the mercy seat and he
[23:44] identifies the spirit of a lion an ox a
[23:47] man and an eagle and these four beasts
[23:49] that guard the throne of god and how you
[23:51] have the four apostles even in the four
[23:53] gospels that are all guard the throne
[23:56] and and even in those things there's a
[23:58] representation in heaven and then
[24:00] there's a representation on earth
[24:02] and there's this identification this
[24:04] manifestation even on earth even in the
[24:07] scripture the four gospels matthew mark
[24:09] luke and john guard what the book of
[24:11] acts and and brother brahms laying all
[24:13] those things out and identifying them
[24:15] them to us
[24:17] i think it's very very very beautiful
[24:20] and i and two i realized we're the
[24:22] visitors today it seems a little bit
[24:24] awesome welcoming uh the mesa church
[24:26] here and i realized that we're the
[24:28] visitors
[24:29] and and i think a lot of ones who are
[24:31] visiting have probably never heard me
[24:32] preach before
[24:33] and you might leave wondering if you
[24:35] even did hear me preach this morning i
[24:37] get really excited and i go too fast so
[24:38] now you know how to pray for me that i
[24:40] slow down
[24:42] too bad they can't modulate it right
[24:44] brother mitch just put on a auto tune
[24:46] where it just slows me down and i'm
[24:47] talking as fast as i want but what you
[24:48] hear is me it's lower
[24:50] that would be really weird for me to
[24:52] finish and sit down and get to hear
[24:53] myself finish
[24:58] so if with this image in mind this
[25:00] picture in mind
[25:02] we know that the tabernacle in the old
[25:04] testament was a pre-figure of christ
[25:07] so it's a pre-figure of christ it's
[25:09] symbols it's foreshadowing it's it's not
[25:11] the complete substance
[25:13] because if it was paul could never say
[25:14] that the christ was better
[25:16] when the new covenant is better so god
[25:18] is laying all these things out
[25:20] foreshadowing building these types and
[25:22] these shadows in there because it's
[25:23] looking forward to the time that the
[25:25] seed of abraham would come because even
[25:27] in that the promise given to abraham
[25:29] that sarah will have a son and he says
[25:31] in your seed your seed is going to do
[25:33] this and it's going to be given to the
[25:34] seed paul says he wasn't even talking
[25:37] about isaac
[25:39] he wasn't even talking about him but he
[25:41] was talking about christ who was the
[25:42] seed that was to come and so you have
[25:44] the natural siege you have the natural
[25:46] law you have the natural covenant but
[25:48] the greater covenant the greater seed
[25:50] was christ all those natural things the
[25:52] tabernacle of witness in the wilderness
[25:54] was foreshadowing christ and we see very
[25:56] plainly all these different things that
[25:58] are represented in christ foreshadowed
[26:00] in the arrangement of the things and the
[26:02] offerings and the sacrifices and even
[26:04] the physical temple
[26:06] and so the tabernacle was a pre-figure
[26:08] of christ and in the image
[26:11] of god's throne in heaven
[26:13] so first throne in heaven
[26:15] and then the second throne in christ
[26:17] this tabernacle in the old testament
[26:19] this first covenant was a representation
[26:21] of what was already in heaven and then a
[26:24] foreshadowing and a prefigure of the
[26:26] throne that would be in christ
[26:28] and we could take time to read in the
[26:29] scripture how the ark of the covenant is
[26:31] placed in the holy of holies
[26:33] behind a veil of blue and and purple and
[26:36] crimson and white and gold it's behind
[26:38] that curtain
[26:39] and even in the curtains represented the
[26:41] cherubim
[26:42] the ark of the testament the ark of the
[26:44] covenant
[26:46] consisted of wood the shedham wood which
[26:48] was represents humanity
[26:50] and then that wood of the ark is
[26:52] actually overlaid in gold which would
[26:54] represent deity so it already has this
[26:56] symbolism it's already representing
[26:58] something it already has this pre-figure
[27:00] that you would have humanity and then
[27:02] enclosed and enveloped in deity i i
[27:05] identify with that
[27:07] even look at what we're counseled to do
[27:09] in this end time to buy me gold tried in
[27:11] the fire this which is this character of
[27:13] christ this deity you find that we are
[27:16] that we're to be called ourselves and
[27:18] dress ourselves in this linen we're to
[27:19] be washed to have our garments washed
[27:21] even with this crimson blood you see all
[27:23] these same elements that can be
[27:24] configured
[27:26] represent even in our experience as a
[27:28] believer
[27:30] then the mercy seat which was a lid or a
[27:32] covering that was made out of solid gold
[27:36] pure solid gold and actually the
[27:38] cherubim that were part of that were
[27:40] fashioned out of solid gold too and made
[27:42] part of that sea they were considered
[27:44] one with that seed
[27:47] now when you think ark of the covenant i
[27:49] think maybe sometimes we think about
[27:52] a boat
[27:54] and brother in the scripture god
[27:56] actually identifies
[27:58] the covenant and the promise with the
[28:00] ark so you even see this foreshadowing
[28:03] that build an ark which was a we'd call
[28:05] a boat but more like a box a big huge
[28:07] floating box but it's a boat but this
[28:10] arc the word arc means chest a chest or
[28:13] a container
[28:14] that's what it represented was a chest
[28:16] or a container
[28:17] paul talks about how it held the golden
[28:19] pot of manna this heavenly manna
[28:22] and always stayed fresh aaron's rod was
[28:24] in there that which bud
[28:27] and the tables of the covenant the law
[28:29] it says that when moses was finished
[28:30] writing the testimony god told him you
[28:32] take this testimony and you i want you
[28:34] to put it inside the box inside the
[28:37] chest inside the container
[28:39] and to israel and i know this is uh
[28:42] really uh i'm benefiting from how well
[28:45] you've been taught and how well you know
[28:47] the message in the bible when we think
[28:49] of the ark of the covenant we
[28:50] immediately begin to think of what it
[28:52] represented to israel especially in
[28:53] battle
[28:54] and how it before even in the exodus and
[28:56] how precious and important that place
[28:58] that this ark of the covenant was i mean
[29:00] it was considered the chief token and
[29:02] the biggest symbol of god's presence
[29:05] so it's that when this chest this
[29:06] container would show up on the
[29:08] battlefield israel would begin to cry
[29:10] and the enemies would know
[29:12] great
[29:13] we're vanquished and a lot of the
[29:15] espionage and a lot of the way that the
[29:18] enemies of israel conspired against
[29:19] israel was not to try to figure out how
[29:21] to outflank them and try to figure out
[29:23] how to do this or improve on their
[29:24] weaponry was just get the ark of the
[29:26] covenant
[29:27] if we could just get the ark of the
[29:28] covenant and this ark of the covenant
[29:30] was so
[29:31] remarkable that it would curse the
[29:32] enemies in their
[29:33] possession and bless israel those who
[29:36] had it in possession but if you of a man
[29:38] touched it he would die
[29:40] so it was had such an incredible
[29:43] such a token of god's presence and it
[29:46] represented god's divine glory
[29:50] and not just as a symbol but because god
[29:52] used the language of the that he would
[29:55] dwell there
[29:57] and over and over again in the old
[29:58] testament it speaks of him dwelling
[30:00] there that god would dwell in this place
[30:03] and god would be his dwelling place so
[30:05] that phrase that's used of this mercy
[30:07] seat
[30:08] and this ark of the covenant is a
[30:10] dwelling place of god
[30:12] and exodus chapter 25 verses 21 and 22
[30:16] and that's exodus 25
[30:18] verses 21 and 22 and thou shalt put the
[30:22] mercy seat upon the ark this is this
[30:25] covering this lid of solid gold and in
[30:28] the ark thou shall put the testimony
[30:30] that i shall give thee this is god
[30:32] speaking to moses you're going to take
[30:34] this testimony of the of my mind and of
[30:37] my law you're going to finish it it's
[30:39] going to be done you're going to put it
[30:40] inside of the ark and there
[30:44] i will meet with thee
[30:46] think of how beautiful this is there
[30:49] i'll meet with him
[30:51] i and i will commune with thee from
[30:54] above the mercy seat community means to
[30:56] speak
[30:57] i will declare things to you i will
[30:59] converse with you means to command to
[31:01] promise even to warn this is the place
[31:03] where i'll warn you this is the place
[31:05] that i will speak this is the place that
[31:07] i'll declare things this is the place
[31:08] that i'll converse with you this is the
[31:10] place that i'll give commandments this
[31:11] is the place that i'll make my promises
[31:13] if i'm gonna say something i'll do it in
[31:15] this place if you're gonna receive
[31:17] something i'm going to do it in this
[31:18] place if you're going to be able to be
[31:20] sure of it it's going to come in this
[31:21] place
[31:23] he says from between the two cherubim
[31:26] which are upon the ark of the testimony
[31:28] of all things which i shall give thee in
[31:31] commandment unto the children of israel
[31:34] this is the place that i'll meet you
[31:36] this is the place that i'll commune with
[31:38] you i'll be there above this lid between
[31:41] between the two cherubim
[31:43] so it's in this place it represents
[31:46] god's dwelling place
[31:48] in psalm chapter 80 verse 1. give ear o
[31:51] shepherd of israel thou that leadeth
[31:54] joseph like a flock
[31:55] thou that dwelleth between the cherubim
[31:59] shine forth
[32:01] this is the language that's used
[32:03] of this location above the mercy seat
[32:06] between the chairman which had their
[32:08] wings tip tips touching and their faces
[32:10] down it created this place this dwelling
[32:13] place this spot
[32:15] in god the shepherd of israel is
[32:17] described and defined as he who dwells
[32:19] between the cherubim
[32:21] this is if you said this to a jew they
[32:24] know exactly who you're talking about
[32:26] who's god what god do you serve the one
[32:28] that dwells between the two cherubim
[32:29] they would know exactly there's only one
[32:31] god
[32:32] god of abraham the god of isaac the god
[32:33] of jacob the one true god the shepherd
[32:35] of israel
[32:36] so this is
[32:38] the temple the tabernacle that moses
[32:40] built which was in the image of the
[32:42] throne of god in heaven
[32:45] as he mentioned already the the old
[32:47] testament tabernacle foreshadowed jesus
[32:50] christ
[32:51] because that tabernacle was where god
[32:54] dwelled
[32:55] among his people
[32:56] that this is god this is a
[32:58] representation god i will dwell there
[33:00] that's where i'll put my name and that's
[33:01] where my presence will be and so this
[33:03] was symbolized as this is where god is
[33:06] so when you and maybe this is a i just
[33:09] kind of think about it in my mind i
[33:10] begin to think about
[33:12] that attitude that israel had towards
[33:15] jerusalem and towards the temple
[33:18] towards this tabernacle that could be
[33:19] moved and placed upon a cart there was
[33:22] only one
[33:24] and it was tied to a physical location
[33:27] and so we have to be careful even as
[33:29] believers as christians to not get so
[33:32] tied into that ideology and that
[33:34] viewpoint of a jew do we have this in
[33:36] our mind well it's got to be in one
[33:38] particular place and it can only be in
[33:39] one particular geographical location
[33:42] we've felt god's presence all over the
[33:43] place haven't we
[33:44] we've experienced them in many different
[33:46] places in our hearts and in our lives we
[33:48] look back and say god met me in this
[33:50] revival and god did this tremendous work
[33:52] here and god moved in this service and
[33:54] god did this there and we've come
[33:56] together and all of us may begin to
[33:57] witness and testify that we came to know
[34:00] him in the baptism of the holy ghost in
[34:02] many different places because the place
[34:04] to meet him is not in one place in
[34:07] jerusalem
[34:09] but to a jew that was where god dwelt
[34:12] but then in jesus christ notice what
[34:14] john says and the language he uses is
[34:16] very important
[34:18] in john chapter 1 verse 14 and the word
[34:20] was made flesh
[34:22] and
[34:23] dwelt among us
[34:25] now why did he use that phrase
[34:27] why to use that the word was made flesh
[34:30] and dwelt among us because they believed
[34:32] the word which was god came and dwelt
[34:34] between the two cherubim
[34:36] and so there was this kind of glory that
[34:38] maybe
[34:39] they couldn't touch it they couldn't
[34:41] handle it they couldn't see it they
[34:42] would only know by by a a cloud because
[34:45] he would appear in a cloud above the
[34:46] mercy they would actually see this
[34:48] pillar of fire and they would know well
[34:49] he's in there don't anyone approach
[34:51] don't anyone come near he's in there
[34:53] because he would give a symbol of his
[34:54] presence on earth
[34:56] come on somebody
[34:58] praise the lord as we give a symbol of
[35:00] that of his presence on earth and so now
[35:03] as as john is describing christ being
[35:06] the messiah he's using a language that
[35:08] would actually take straight from what
[35:10] they viewed the the ark of the covenant
[35:12] and the holy of holies and say now the
[35:14] word
[35:15] was made flesh
[35:17] he's behind skin again but not the skin
[35:19] of an animal behind the skin of jesus
[35:22] christ he says the word was made flesh
[35:25] and dwelt among us
[35:27] as god over and over again said i will
[35:29] dwell between the two cherubim and i
[35:31] will dwell in that holy o holies and
[35:33] there i'll dwell and there i'll meet you
[35:35] and i'll dwell in this house and and
[35:37] this is the place where i'll dwell now
[35:39] john say now god dwelt behind the flesh
[35:42] of his son christ
[35:44] so that language is important
[35:46] he says and we beheld his glory
[35:49] the glory is of the only begotten of the
[35:50] father full of grace and truth
[35:53] these are images of the judaic
[35:57] belief system
[35:58] these are images of their theology these
[36:00] are images of what they held to and what
[36:02] they aspired to that you have the
[36:04] shekinah glory that would dwell behind
[36:06] skins behind a curtain in the holy of
[36:09] holies
[36:10] and that's where the shekinah glory
[36:12] would be and then john says that word is
[36:15] made flesh
[36:17] and it dwelt among us
[36:19] and we beheld his glory
[36:22] that's a glory that only
[36:24] only moses could see
[36:27] but now it's in christ
[36:29] this was god's second throne
[36:32] this is our perpetuation
[36:35] he is the one that became our atonement
[36:38] see these elements that were represented
[36:39] in all these all these different
[36:41] elements
[36:42] as symbolized and recognized in the
[36:45] temple
[36:46] they were all speaking of christ
[36:49] isn't it remarkable when you begin to
[36:50] think about it that you have all these
[36:52] different things even to where they
[36:53] would have what was called the scapegoat
[36:56] and all these different elements and so
[36:58] we don't have christ and then who who
[37:00] wants to be the scapegoat can we find
[37:01] some twins here we'll kill the one put
[37:04] your blood on the other and send you out
[37:05] into the valley
[37:07] and you could be the scape go these
[37:08] things are all fulfilled in christ
[37:10] so all these different things you don't
[37:11] have to start kind of chopping it up
[37:13] trying to figure out well one does this
[37:14] and one does that and one does this
[37:16] and we even it's maybe it's easy for us
[37:18] to accept these things because we read
[37:19] them in the scripture but you had an
[37:21] elijah that's a minister it's going to
[37:23] come in the spirit of elijah according
[37:24] to malachi 4 then you have the son of
[37:27] man that's going to reveal the son of
[37:28] man in luke 17 and you have a seventh
[37:30] angel messenger in revelations chapter
[37:32] 10 and you even have a seventh angel to
[37:34] the lay of jesse in church in
[37:36] revelations 3.
[37:37] do we have four different ministries all
[37:39] in one
[37:41] right all filled in one and so you can
[37:42] see that there can be several scriptures
[37:44] that are fulfilled in one ministry you
[37:46] have several different types that are
[37:47] all fulfilled in christ and he became
[37:49] our perpetuation he became our atonement
[37:54] he is the sacrifice that would be upon
[37:56] the mercy see he is the the one that
[37:58] tabernacled the shekinah glory that
[38:00] would be above the mercy seat all these
[38:02] things are fulfilled in this beautiful
[38:04] image
[38:05] so paul writes in hebrews chapter 8
[38:07] verse 6 as we read that the shadow of
[38:08] heavenly things is what moses saw in
[38:10] verse 5. but now hath he obtained a more
[38:13] excellent ministry
[38:14] by how much also he is jesus christ is
[38:17] the mediator of a better covenant which
[38:20] was established upon better promises
[38:23] it's just better saints
[38:25] the word of god is just better it's not
[38:27] a it's not a slight for us to believe
[38:29] that god would do something in his word
[38:32] and fulfill prophecy in bringing things
[38:35] our way that we should have every right
[38:37] as a believer to say it's better
[38:40] it's a better promise in the day that
[38:41] we're living in it's a better
[38:42] manifestation of god's glory it's a
[38:44] better outpouring of the spirit it's a
[38:46] better promise that's fulfilled in this
[38:48] hour
[38:49] a mediator of a better covenant which
[38:51] was established upon better promises
[38:54] so the better covenant the better
[38:55] testament is the
[38:57] new covenant
[38:59] covenant even speaks of an agreement
[39:01] between between two it's the promises
[39:03] jesus said i will send the promise of
[39:05] the father the promise of the father
[39:07] what was that the comforter
[39:09] pro that the father will send you he is
[39:11] the advocate so the better covenant is
[39:14] the new covenant
[39:16] the new testament he says this is the
[39:18] blood of the new covenant
[39:21] in my blood this is symbolism of it he's
[39:23] bringing a new covenant
[39:26] continuing the hebrews chapter 8 verse
[39:28] 10 for this is the covenant
[39:30] been reading this through every i think
[39:32] almost every service that we've had on
[39:33] this subject these four services on the
[39:35] the advocate
[39:37] for this is the covenant that i will
[39:39] make with the house of israel after
[39:41] those days saith the lord
[39:44] this is the new covenant
[39:46] under the old covenant god speaks to
[39:47] moses in exodus 25 says when you're done
[39:49] writing my words when you're done
[39:51] writing my testament take this physical
[39:53] testament place it in a physical chest
[39:55] in a physical box and let that word be
[39:58] there that law as a testimony in that
[40:00] box and what does he say in one place
[40:02] put it there as a witness and a
[40:04] testimony against israel
[40:08] it's the mirror image it's the opposite
[40:11] put the word in there because when they
[40:13] fall i want to remind them what they
[40:15] fell from
[40:16] so now
[40:17] paul is saying but this is a new
[40:19] covenant
[40:20] quoting from jeremiah i will put my laws
[40:23] in their mind
[40:24] and write them in their heart
[40:27] and i will be to them a god and they
[40:30] shall be to me a people
[40:33] so now where's the sanctuary
[40:36] now the heart of man is god's sanctuary
[40:40] now the place for the shekinah glory to
[40:42] dwell is in man's heart
[40:45] he called it the ark of the covenant the
[40:47] ark is what a chest
[40:49] now it's your
[40:50] chest now the ark the chest of the
[40:53] covenant this is a chest of the covenant
[40:56] that's why we as men in this hour ought
[40:59] to be men with chest we have to have a
[41:01] backbone we have to stand for truth we
[41:03] ought to we have to lift up holiness and
[41:05] admire the right things and live
[41:07] sanctified lives why because this chest
[41:10] is a chest where the almighty dwells
[41:13] it's no accident that that's the
[41:15] language that's used because we become
[41:16] the container of the kind of glory
[41:19] so through the baptism of the holy ghost
[41:21] the soul is made the habitation of god
[41:25] paul says in first corinthians chapter 3
[41:27] verses 16 to 17
[41:29] know you not that ye are the temple of
[41:32] god and that the spirit of god dwelleth
[41:34] in you
[41:36] again it's important to think what
[41:39] paul's saying in light of what all the
[41:41] jews would be thinking
[41:42] well wait a minute we have one temple
[41:44] this is the argument that paul is
[41:47] addressing in hebrews chapter in hebrews
[41:49] he says you are the temple of god
[41:51] why because the spirit of god dwelt
[41:53] within you
[41:54] under the first covenant there's where
[41:56] the spirit of god would come down and
[41:57] the spirit would fill the whole place
[41:59] and god identified himself with that
[42:00] house but now he says you are the temple
[42:03] of god and the spirit of god dwelleth in
[42:05] you if any man defile the temple of god
[42:08] him shall god destroy for the temple of
[42:10] god is holy which temple ye are
[42:14] being very definitive about it
[42:16] i am we sing the song i am a temple of
[42:19] the holy ghost
[42:21] this is not just poetry
[42:23] that this is not just well it's just
[42:25] kind of figurative because when you're
[42:26] saved you can't die and you're going to
[42:28] be in heaven one day and you're going to
[42:30] have eternal life so we just kind of use
[42:32] it as a type and we kind of use it just
[42:34] as an example no the old temple was a
[42:36] type
[42:38] a type of you ethan
[42:40] because now you are the temple of the
[42:43] holy ghost right now you are
[42:45] tabernacling you're holding something
[42:47] inside of you it is the shekinah glory
[42:50] i know these are simple things but i
[42:52] believe that we ought to be reminded and
[42:54] re-established in the simple things so
[42:56] that we don't lose track of what god has
[42:58] called us to be in this hour you are a
[43:00] temple of god that means you are the
[43:02] place that god identifies himself
[43:06] you must be a place that has been
[43:07] sanctified by the blood you must be a
[43:09] place that's been purified you must be a
[43:11] place where his shekinah glory can dwell
[43:16] so now this chest
[43:18] is where god dwells
[43:20] paul says in hebrews chapter 12 verse 24
[43:22] and to jesus
[43:23] the mediator the new covenant
[43:25] under the first covenant
[43:28] which was an image of what was in heaven
[43:29] god said i'll meet you there and i'll
[43:31] talk to you and i'll speak to you i'll
[43:32] commune with you
[43:34] but now jesus is the mediator of the new
[43:36] covenant
[43:37] and to the blood of sprinkling same
[43:39] images now that are going to be in he in
[43:41] the old covenant
[43:43] that speaketh better things than that of
[43:46] abel
[43:48] as the blood of abel would speak
[43:51] and as blood speaks now he's saying this
[43:55] covenant
[43:56] speaks better
[43:58] under the first covenant god dwelled
[43:59] between cherubim
[44:01] communed and spoke to moses commanded
[44:03] promised warned to moses
[44:06] and numbers chapter 7 verse 89 that's a
[44:08] really long chapter
[44:10] verse 89 and when moses was gone into
[44:12] the tabernacle the congregation to speak
[44:14] with him
[44:15] then he heard the voice of one speaking
[44:18] unto him we can read this way he heard
[44:21] the voice of god speaking to him from
[44:23] the mercy seat
[44:26] he actually heard a voice from that
[44:27] place that god dwelt between the two
[44:30] cherubim above this pure gold lid this
[44:33] all this this ark of the covenant and
[44:35] the mercy seat the mercy covering the
[44:38] mercy lid from there god spoke the voice
[44:41] of god spoke from off the mercy seat
[44:43] that was upon the ark of testimony from
[44:45] between the two cherubim and he spake
[44:49] unto him
[44:50] so under the old covenant the first
[44:52] covenant god spoke from between the two
[44:54] cherubim under the second covenant god
[44:56] still speaks
[44:58] because he says he's the media to the
[44:59] new covenant and the blood of sprinkling
[45:02] that speaketh better things god still
[45:04] speaks
[45:06] there's still a witnessing there's still
[45:07] a communion there's still a warning
[45:09] there's still a commanding there's still
[45:11] a promising there's still a testimony
[45:13] for where from the throne from the mercy
[45:15] seat from the shekinah glory but this
[45:18] chest this time is your chest
[45:24] hebrews chapter 10 verses 15 and 16.
[45:28] this is repeating what he wrote in
[45:29] hebrews 8 10. this is a repeat of what
[45:32] jeremiah said in jeremiah chapter 33 i
[45:34] believe it is whereof the holy ghost
[45:36] also is a witness to us
[45:40] an inside witness
[45:41] an inside teacher not somebody lording
[45:44] over you from the outside say hey you're
[45:46] doing wrong there buddy you better get
[45:48] right but a voice on the inside a voice
[45:50] from within says this is what's pleasing
[45:52] to the lord this is the way walking in
[45:54] it there's a voice that's been quickened
[45:56] and stirred up inside of us he says
[45:57] where the holy ghost also is a witness
[45:59] to us for after that he had said before
[46:02] this is the covenant
[46:06] this is the new covenant under the old
[46:09] covenant i want you to finish the word
[46:11] moses a prophet i want you to finish the
[46:13] message that i gave you and i want you
[46:15] to take it i want you to put it into the
[46:17] chest so that it will be a witness
[46:19] against israel when they sin
[46:22] but now he's saying this is the new
[46:24] covenant which the holy ghost is going
[46:26] to speak about which the holy ghost is
[46:28] going to remind you of this is the new
[46:30] covenant not that i'm going to take the
[46:32] law and put it in the physical chest but
[46:34] i'm going to finish the message of the
[46:36] god i'm going to finish his voice i'm
[46:38] going to seal it up and i'm going to put
[46:39] it in your chest
[46:41] but not as a witness against you a
[46:43] witness for you that will actually
[46:45] testify and your sins and your
[46:47] iniquities will i'll remember no more
[46:49] against you
[46:52] it's not a testimony against us it's a
[46:54] testimony for us
[46:56] i can still remember the first time i
[46:58] ever heard it oh my just even still to
[47:00] now it thrills me
[47:02] brother doug mccues told the testimony
[47:04] how a young girl came to him and was
[47:06] trying to she she was trying to tell him
[47:08] all the sins that he did and he said
[47:10] listen let me tell you
[47:11] if you stood before god himself and
[47:14] tried to tell him about the sins you're
[47:16] committing he'd say i don't know what
[47:18] you're talking about
[47:20] this is the promise of the new covenant
[47:23] your sins and your iniquities while i
[47:25] remember no more against you
[47:29] so you have a testimony for us
[47:34] so if in even in that image
[47:36] we we recognize christ in the role that
[47:38] he plays for our sins
[47:41] and how we must be identified with that
[47:43] sacrifice
[47:44] and and how it's represented as standing
[47:46] before the father making intercession
[47:48] and mediating forth so that we can come
[47:49] under his blood and be born again which
[47:52] is the baptism holy ghost we're
[47:53] quickened a new life
[47:56] and
[47:57] there's this
[47:58] representation now that continues in his
[48:00] advocacy
[48:02] and brother bannon makes this statement
[48:04] in future home both the heavens and
[48:06] earth now
[48:07] are contaminated with devils that can
[48:09] accuse us before god
[48:11] amen to that
[48:13] this whole world is contaminated
[48:16] and it accuses us before god
[48:20] now are we not in the presence of god
[48:23] and he's bold enough to accuse us
[48:25] in the presence of god
[48:27] and who's the most affected and impacted
[48:29] by the accusations
[48:31] why would we rejoice when the accuser of
[48:33] the brethren is cast down it's not
[48:35] because god can be swayed
[48:37] not because the devil can construct an
[48:39] argument where god says hmm i hadn't
[48:41] thought about that
[48:43] and he looks at you like
[48:45] brother
[48:46] john really
[48:50] i'm not we're not worried about that
[48:51] right who is it before god we even see
[48:53] god we even hear his response in just
[48:55] this type of some sort of conversation
[48:57] who is it that feels condemned our
[48:59] hearts do who is it feels discouraged
[49:01] who is it that begins to question the
[49:03] devil makes the accusation so that you
[49:05] can hear it
[49:06] remember how in the uh
[49:08] in the old testament where there would
[49:10] be people speaking are coming to
[49:12] threaten israel and threaten them upon
[49:13] the wall and they're trying to rebuild
[49:14] the wall they're trying to do something
[49:15] for god and they would come and they
[49:17] would begin to threaten they say hey say
[49:19] their language so they can hear it
[49:22] why they want the people to be weakened
[49:24] in their resolve
[49:25] it wasn't so much getting the leader to
[49:27] change his mind they wanted the rest of
[49:28] the people to weaken their resolve so
[49:30] who does satan accuse us
[49:33] and who is it that feels it and who is
[49:35] it that experiences we do so he says the
[49:37] whole atmosphere is contaminated with
[49:39] devils that accuse us before god jesus
[49:41] is there to intercede for us while the
[49:44] accuser keeps pointing a finger they did
[49:46] this they did this they did this but the
[49:49] blood still covers
[49:52] the blood still covers we can
[49:55] so what does the holy ghost say don't
[49:57] listen to him you're covered
[49:59] don't listen to him you're covered don't
[50:01] listen to him you're covered what that's
[50:02] a witness to us
[50:05] that's his advocacy for us
[50:09] wow why is it our tuner
[50:11] can just really find the devil's voice
[50:13] so easily
[50:14] it's like we know right where to find
[50:16] them oh that's a preset
[50:17] right
[50:18] that's all my favorites i know just how
[50:19] to get this bookmarked i can hear when
[50:21] devil wants to tell me something wrong i
[50:23] i can hear it
[50:24] plain as day and god's over there saying
[50:26] hey don't listen to it it's a big lie
[50:28] shut it down close the door walk away
[50:30] don't listen to him and it's just like
[50:33] right
[50:34] yeah just trying to tune it in just
[50:35] right
[50:36] i don't know if i can get it where did
[50:38] you say that url was again you know is
[50:40] it live is it is there internet working
[50:42] go reset the router i can't i can't hear
[50:43] the voice of god he's there wanting to
[50:46] commune with you
[50:47] speak to you he's wanting to encourage
[50:49] you and lift you up
[50:53] brother branham said
[50:54] well this i want to read from the
[50:56] unveiling of god that would be a good
[50:58] a sermon the unveiling of god and the
[50:59] mighty god unveiled
[51:01] be two perfect sermons to go
[51:03] and listen to and i trust that you are
[51:05] listening to this voice
[51:07] go and listen to those messages
[51:09] brother brahma is walking through the
[51:11] beautiful picture of god veiled behind
[51:13] skins
[51:14] how those veils hides people but then
[51:17] once a god god removes the veil
[51:20] and then unveils himself
[51:22] in his people
[51:24] so the intercession this i guess this is
[51:26] the what i want you to recognize the
[51:28] intercession there then is not in
[51:30] jerusalem
[51:31] nor is it in a
[51:33] a jerusalem in the sky
[51:35] but even in the new jerusalem which is
[51:37] his bride
[51:39] it's in you
[51:41] it's not just in a throne in heaven but
[51:44] it's the throne in you
[51:46] brother brahman says in the unveiling of
[51:47] god you are templing christ
[51:51] you are the temple of the holy ghost you
[51:52] are tabernacling christ you are temple
[51:54] in christ that's behind the veil of the
[51:56] skin
[51:57] the veil again in human flesh hides god
[52:00] the word from the unbeliever
[52:02] i think sometimes we do a really good
[52:04] job of that right
[52:06] but it's this veil that's going to
[52:08] stumble them
[52:10] it's the way it lives the way it
[52:11] believes the way it dresses the way it
[52:13] acts it's it's the veil that hides them
[52:15] from the unbeliever we even see that
[52:17] it's the veil of his flesh of the
[52:19] prophet that stumbles the unbeliever
[52:22] so it's your temple in christ he says
[52:24] again in the same sermon and he veils
[52:25] himself today in earthen vessels with
[52:28] the shekinah
[52:30] earth and vessels hold the shekinah the
[52:32] outside looks like a bunch of holy
[52:34] rollers old badger skins but the inside
[52:37] hides the shekinah glory
[52:39] again recognize the image that god is
[52:42] creating in your person you that's a
[52:44] three-part being body spirit and soul
[52:46] the very layout of a tabernacle down in
[52:49] the soul the holy of holies there dwells
[52:51] what the shekinah glory you become a
[52:54] tabernacle
[52:56] behind the animal's skin behind the
[52:58] human skin he says there's where the
[53:01] shekinah glory is at one time it would
[53:03] be in the tabernacle of witness in the
[53:05] tent of meeting in the old testament at
[53:08] one time it was in christ but now he's
[53:11] behind your
[53:12] flesh the inside hides the shekinah
[53:15] glory
[53:17] bill abraham's preaching a church
[53:18] dedication in kentucky in 1962
[53:22] and he's using the temple and the
[53:24] dedication of the temple and these
[53:25] different images of the tabernacle and
[53:27] when they brought the ark and he placed
[53:29] it within the the temple and the
[53:31] dedicating the temple the presence of
[53:33] god came
[53:34] and it just filled the filled the place
[53:36] but everyone said brethren takes that
[53:38] type
[53:39] of when the shekinah glory came the
[53:41] temple and he's saying that's the kind
[53:42] of glory came on the day of pentecost
[53:45] he says when they were gathered in the
[53:46] upper room they waited that time for the
[53:48] promise of the father in the new
[53:50] covenant is going to be the promise that
[53:52] jesus spoke of the promise of the father
[53:54] this is the promise that i make go and
[53:55] tarry until the promise of the father
[53:57] comes they're all there in one mind and
[53:59] one accord and all doubt is crossed out
[54:01] it says god came down again in the
[54:03] shekinah glory
[54:04] and filled all the house where they were
[54:06] setting
[54:07] what did god do like the ark dropping
[54:10] into its proper sockets for the message
[54:12] of that day
[54:13] god dropped back into his proper channel
[54:16] not under a denomination or into a
[54:18] building made with hands but into the
[54:20] heart of men
[54:22] isn't it wonderful to know that it's not
[54:24] the building
[54:26] the physical building it's the heart of
[54:28] man
[54:29] he says god came to his resting place
[54:32] where he finds rest
[54:35] not a building
[54:36] but in the hearts of his people he finds
[54:38] rest
[54:40] god's place of rest not in a building
[54:43] where does he find rest he says in the
[54:46] heart of his people
[54:48] where where where in the heart of people
[54:51] where does god find rest
[54:53] in your heart
[54:55] why is it that maybe we're restless
[54:58] because rest begets rest
[55:01] if you let him find rest in your heart
[55:03] then you'll find rest in him
[55:07] our advocate
[55:09] i'm going i'm closing here
[55:12] and uh
[55:14] to those that don't know me that means
[55:16] nothing to you and then maybe to those
[55:18] who know me
[55:19] they might feel it means nothing to them
[55:21] but it means i'm on my closing thought
[55:23] i'm like i'm getting there
[55:26] but our advocate is the comforter in our
[55:29] hearts
[55:31] so many scriptures are like to you so
[55:32] many different places even rehearse and
[55:34] bring back up these images of this
[55:37] advocate the comforter the spirit of
[55:38] truth
[55:40] and how he's the inside teacher he's for
[55:42] you on the inside
[55:44] and he's there
[55:45] on this side not not in the view that we
[55:47] hold where he stands before the father
[55:49] interceding and mediating for us but now
[55:52] that we've been born again by the
[55:53] baptism of the holy ghost now he's
[55:55] inside
[55:57] interceding
[55:58] pleading
[55:59] mediating for us
[56:01] against our mind and our imagination our
[56:03] conscience memory reason effects even
[56:04] against our sick body
[56:07] by stripes i'm healed
[56:09] no not fearing death and not worrying
[56:11] about this and i'm going to take care
[56:12] i'm going to lead you and guide you
[56:14] he's there what in the heart of his
[56:16] people where he finds rest
[56:19] behind your skin
[56:21] is the shekinah glory
[56:24] and in acts chapter 7 verses 48
[56:27] and 49 how be it the most high
[56:30] well if not in temples made with hands i
[56:33] saith the prophet
[56:35] heaven is my throne and earth is my
[56:36] footstool
[56:38] beautiful image there now of joining the
[56:40] joining together of god
[56:42] whose feet are upon the earth whose head
[56:44] is in heaven who heaven and earth
[56:46] embrace and kiss in christ who heaven
[56:48] and earth are coming together in all
[56:49] these different elements we see them
[56:50] over and over again even in the
[56:51] beginning this type of the bridegroom in
[56:53] christ he says heaven is my throne the
[56:55] earth is my footstool what house will
[56:58] you build me
[57:00] saith the lord or what is the place
[57:03] of my rest
[57:06] you are his tabernacle
[57:08] you are the place where his glory dwells
[57:12] as we read from hebrews chapter 10 this
[57:14] is the covenant that the holy ghost
[57:16] witnesses of as we've read in chapters
[57:18] eight and chapter nine and just working
[57:19] through hebrews chapter 10 it says
[57:20] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[57:22] he saith sacrifice and offerings thou
[57:24] wouldest not but a body thou has
[57:26] prepared me
[57:28] god dwelt in heaven
[57:31] then that's his first throne
[57:33] then his second throne is in christ we
[57:35] see this body thou has prepared me now
[57:38] god has a body in his son and we see
[57:40] those things we accept those things we
[57:42] recognize those things but in first
[57:43] corinthians chapter 12 verse 27 now you
[57:46] are the body of christ and members in
[57:49] particular
[57:51] this is the body that he had prepared it
[57:53] is a mystical body it is the body of
[57:56] christ it is the body of the bride
[57:59] and listen it is not defined by your dot
[58:02] com
[58:03] it is not defined by your zip code it's
[58:05] not defined by your area code it's not
[58:06] defined by a geographical location it's
[58:08] not defined by the church you're

[58:24] over that
[58:25] no man mediates on her behalf except the
[58:27] man christ jesus that is the body that
[58:30] god dwells in
[58:32] you are the body of christ you are
[58:34] members in particular of the body that
[58:37] has been prepared for god you are the
[58:39] temple of the holy ghost
[58:43] there he advocates
[58:46] there he supports
[58:47] there he lifts up
[58:49] there forever is the atonement in its
[58:51] fullness
[58:52] there forever is the advocate he'll
[58:54] never leave you nor forsake you
[58:58] i'd like to close with at least one one
[59:00] statement
[59:01] a quotation from what house will you
[59:03] build me
[59:05] spoken in tucson tabernacle november
[59:07] 1965
[59:10] and i have another one i may read i'm
[59:12] just
[59:13] just wanting to be very sensitive to
[59:14] just where we leave it
[59:16] brother branham says and i believe
[59:19] that god almighty will bless you if
[59:21] you'll just stand by this church now
[59:22] this group of people and he's telling me
[59:24] how brother perry green had started this
[59:25] church
[59:26] he says not only and this is instructive
[59:28] he says not only that but let's go out
[59:30] and see if we can't get others to come
[59:31] in
[59:33] notice those who have the advocate
[59:36] can now advocate
[59:39] let's go out and see if we can't get
[59:40] others to come in
[59:42] let's speak to others everywhere speak
[59:43] to them about our church and what it
[59:45] means we're here and brother graham's
[59:47] about even himself we're here we want
[59:48] you to come in bring in strangers and
[59:51] i'm sure it'll be good for all of us we
[59:52] have a building which we are thankful
[59:54] for we're thankful for this place
[59:56] together
[59:57] but how be it the most high dwelleth not
[59:59] in temples made with hands see for
[1:00:02] heaven is my throne and earth is my
[1:00:04] footstool and where is the place of my
[1:00:06] rest but a body thou has prepared me and
[1:00:08] he just takes these scriptures acts 7
[1:00:10] hebrews 10 brings him all the other he
[1:00:11] says and we are a body of christ
[1:00:16] all those scriptures he brings together
[1:00:17] very quickly acts 7 hebrews 10 first
[1:00:20] corinthians 12.
[1:00:22] so he says we move from one building to
[1:00:24] another
[1:00:26] like i can personally relate to this
[1:00:27] very very well so as we move from one
[1:00:29] building to another i believe and this
[1:00:31] is brother i'm speaking of himself in
[1:00:33] bringing our messages
[1:00:35] and we'll come down and have healing
[1:00:36] service this is what he was describing
[1:00:38] that he would do at tucson tabernacle
[1:00:40] he'll come in
[1:00:41] and bring he says and bring in our
[1:00:42] message that was his message now we
[1:00:44] don't bring another one
[1:00:46] right as ministers of god as ministers
[1:00:48] of this message we have under our
[1:00:49] messenger we're the final voice to the
[1:00:51] final age we have a message that is
[1:00:53] perfect that we preach
[1:00:55] so the messages that he brought
[1:00:57] when he was done finishing
[1:00:59] that it has been sealed in our hearts
[1:01:01] in our chest he says and anything the
[1:01:03] lord reveals to us to do we'll have it
[1:01:05] right here in the church
[1:01:07] and it's somebody there tucson
[1:01:08] tabernacle and i just love this image
[1:01:10] because he says let's go out and see if
[1:01:11] we can't get others to come in and bring
[1:01:13] in strangers he says i'm sure it'll be
[1:01:14] good for us until it swells out so big
[1:01:17] you'll have to take it somewhere else
[1:01:19] and somewhere else until jesus comes he
[1:01:21] says god bless you
[1:01:23] this is beautiful instruction from the
[1:01:25] prophet
[1:01:26] before he leaves the scene this is the
[1:01:28] type of enthusiasm we ought to have for
[1:01:30] the body of christ
[1:01:31] and its enthusiasm that then we begin to
[1:01:33] recognize that as a christian as a
[1:01:35] believer and as i believe god has placed
[1:01:37] me within the body of christ and god has
[1:01:39] led me to be a part of even a local body
[1:01:41] says we are a body of christ and and let
[1:01:43] me just say this the local church
[1:01:45] arizona believers church does not
[1:01:46] supersede or assume in the mesa church
[1:01:48] if there's a the mesa church and there's
[1:01:50] a body that god has brought together in
[1:01:52] that and then there's an arizona
[1:01:53] believer's church then we are one in
[1:01:55] christ
[1:01:57] that's where we that's where one that's
[1:01:58] how we have fellowship one with another
[1:02:00] as we walk in the light of god and the
[1:02:02] blood of jesus christ his son cleanses
[1:02:04] us from all sin and unrighteousness and
[1:02:05] we have fellowship one with another
[1:02:07] there's no church that's greater than
[1:02:09] the body of christ
[1:02:12] but we recognize as men of god that god
[1:02:15] places within our fellowship within the
[1:02:17] local body members of that greater body
[1:02:20] so we have a fidelity we have to have a
[1:02:21] fidelity to the word that what we preach
[1:02:24] promotes the local body in harmony with
[1:02:27] the global body the mystical body
[1:02:30] i think his language here is just so
[1:02:32] beautiful
[1:02:34] what house will you build me
[1:02:36] we are the body of christ now
[1:02:40] and i hope what i'm doing here is it'll
[1:02:42] just hold you in suspense keep like whoa
[1:02:44] ponder that think about that because
[1:02:46] because then i'm going to stop
[1:02:48] but i want you to ponder this he begins
[1:02:50] to pray dear god as we stand there on
[1:02:52] this platform
[1:02:54] which represents right over the altar
[1:02:56] here we realize that we are a dying race
[1:02:58] of people as far as this earth is
[1:03:00] concerned
[1:03:01] we look out upon the streets and see sin
[1:03:03] wrote everywhere
[1:03:06] and
[1:03:07] that
[1:03:08] can i just pause for a moment
[1:03:10] remember where the shekinah glory dwells
[1:03:13] remember who the temple of the holy
[1:03:14] ghost is
[1:03:16] remember where the mercy seat is
[1:03:18] all these images that god that we've
[1:03:20] read in the message of the hour and
[1:03:21] we've seen the scripture who you are and
[1:03:23] he says we look out into the world and
[1:03:25] he said the world is contaminated with
[1:03:27] accusers and devils that accuse us
[1:03:29] before god and you see this whole
[1:03:31] contamination all this ungodliness
[1:03:33] brother brahms praying looking out of
[1:03:34] this altar talking about this church and
[1:03:36] we are the body of christ what house
[1:03:38] will you build me and he doesn't live in
[1:03:40] a building made with hands but he lives
[1:03:42] in the hearts of his people and he makes
[1:03:43] this statement praise this prayer he
[1:03:45] says we see sin wrote everywhere and
[1:03:47] that the glory of the lord is swiftly
[1:03:49] departed
[1:03:52] imagine that
[1:03:53] the glory of the lord is lifting as it
[1:03:55] were
[1:03:57] he sees it becoming fewer and fewer and
[1:03:59] the glory of the lord is leaving we see
[1:04:01] the glory of the lord is swiftly
[1:04:02] departing and listen and we know when
[1:04:04] the glory of the lord goes up
[1:04:07] so will the church go with it
[1:04:10] why now why would that be
[1:04:12] that seems really odd when the glory
[1:04:15] leaves the church goes
[1:04:17] doesn't seem odd at all does it
[1:04:19] where is the glory
[1:04:21] it's in his church
[1:04:22] it's in your chest if the glory leaves
[1:04:25] it's got to take you with it
[1:04:27] and this image that he's pictured that
[1:04:29] he's painted it's not that we're all
[1:04:31] kind of sitting here the holy ghost is
[1:04:32] gone i guess we better get out of here
[1:04:34] no if the holy ghost leaves it's taking
[1:04:36] you with it
[1:04:38] so where's the last place of his glory
[1:04:41] if the world's gonna hear it's gotta
[1:04:43] hear it from you
[1:04:45] if somebody's gonna hear the voice he's
[1:04:47] gonna hear it from you if anyone's gonna
[1:04:49] see christ they're gonna have to see it
[1:04:50] from you
[1:04:53] the glory of the lord is swiftly
[1:04:54] departing
[1:04:56] how else do we see it departing
[1:04:59] and we see the chest of our loved ones
[1:05:00] laid in another coffin
[1:05:03] we see believer one by one taking that
[1:05:06] god harnessing death and putting bits in
[1:05:08] his mouth and dragging members of the
[1:05:10] body into the presence of god little by
[1:05:12] little his glory is swiftly departing
[1:05:14] taking one after another with him but
[1:05:15] one day when the glory leaves the church
[1:05:18] goes with it
[1:05:20] because she's the temple of god
[1:05:23] i invite the musicians to come
[1:05:32] we have an advocate
[1:05:33] with the father
[1:05:37] the glory of the lord was always
[1:05:39] identified with
[1:05:42] uh it was identified with the place
[1:05:43] where he dwelt between the two cherubim
[1:05:46] above the mercy seat
[1:05:49] in the ark of the covenant
[1:05:51] in the holy of holies
[1:05:53] in the tabernacle of witness in the
[1:05:54] wilderness
[1:05:56] which represented the first throne which
[1:05:57] was in heaven
[1:06:00] which then represented perfectly in
[1:06:01] christ which was the second throne
[1:06:04] now where is his throne
[1:06:06] it's in you
[1:06:09] where is the place of mercy
[1:06:11] there's a place of mercy in you
[1:06:14] now again don't don't twist them don't
[1:06:16] twist the image
[1:06:18] but think about what is in you the
[1:06:20] shekinah glory dwells in you
[1:06:23] it dwells within the heart of man
[1:06:27] you want to don't want to contort it and
[1:06:28] twist it and
[1:06:30] kind of get self-righteous with it to
[1:06:32] where somehow we take the throne that's
[1:06:34] within our hearts
[1:06:36] and and we we try to maybe divide it and
[1:06:39] separate it to our way you have christ
[1:06:40] who was the throne at one time and now
[1:06:42] there's a new throne no it's all working
[1:06:44] together
[1:06:46] all these elements all these parts we've
[1:06:48] got to stay very faithful to what
[1:06:49] brother branham taught
[1:06:51] but we don't ask god to give us a
[1:06:52] revelation of what he taught
[1:06:56] and when the glory of the lord leaves
[1:06:58] the bride's leaving
[1:07:02] brother branham as he's preaching
[1:07:03] revelations chapter four part three
[1:07:06] we read to you how he said that the
[1:07:07] mercy seat is in the heart of man
[1:07:11] it's where the shekinah glory is in the
[1:07:13] heart of man
[1:07:13] [Music]
[1:07:15] and he says that the throne of god is in
[1:07:18] the heart of man
[1:07:20] he says where is the shekinah glory
[1:07:22] at the mercy seat
[1:07:24] where's the mercy seat i'm just kind of
[1:07:26] re-rephrasing these things or repeating
[1:07:28] what he said the mercy seats in the
[1:07:30] heart of man
[1:07:32] this is what he says at the beginning of
[1:07:33] that
[1:07:34] that message revelations chapter four
[1:07:36] part three
[1:07:37] now is the day of mercy
[1:07:40] let's go back in the old testament here
[1:07:41] just to find just a little bit and find
[1:07:43] out what mercy is and that's when he
[1:07:45] drops back
[1:07:46] and pays this beautiful picture through
[1:07:48] several
[1:07:49] paragraphs
[1:07:51] he says go on back and see what happened
[1:07:52] to this throne
[1:07:54] this throne of course is the judgment
[1:07:56] seat
[1:07:57] and the reason today that there is mercy
[1:07:59] is because the mercy seat is sprinkled
[1:08:01] with an atonement
[1:08:03] blood
[1:08:05] and why is it that they'll even be the
[1:08:06] foolish
[1:08:08] that go through tribulation brother bam
[1:08:10] says because they reject the atonement
[1:08:13] in his fullness
[1:08:14] because they're not covered by the blood
[1:08:17] but who goes the bride
[1:08:20] who is
[1:08:21] covered by his blood the mercy seat is
[1:08:24] sprinkled with atonement blood and as
[1:08:26] long as blood is on the judgment seat
[1:08:28] then it's not a judgment seat no more
[1:08:29] it's mercy but something died to stay
[1:08:33] just a judgment
[1:08:35] the mercy seat is not a
[1:08:36] chair and as long as it's occupied by
[1:08:39] christ there's mercy
[1:08:41] the throne of god is where you find
[1:08:43] mercy
[1:08:44] and the throne of god is where they're
[1:08:45] going to find judgment
[1:08:47] still is thrown
[1:08:48] it's still the place of his presence
[1:08:50] there's just something that changes with
[1:08:52] it
[1:08:53] he says as long as blood is on the mercy
[1:08:55] seat
[1:08:56] it showed that something died to hold
[1:08:58] judgment back that's the image of the
[1:09:00] old testament and i'm just leaving you
[1:09:01] with this statement for you to ponder
[1:09:02] and to think about
[1:09:04] but when the church is raptured
[1:09:06] the mercy seat becomes a judgment seat
[1:09:11] what's holding away judgment right now
[1:09:14] the fact that we're still here
[1:09:16] only he who now let us will let until
[1:09:19] she be taken out of the way the only
[1:09:21] thing that's holding back the antichrist
[1:09:23] the only thing that's holding back
[1:09:25] complete total domination and chaos
[1:09:28] and and and darkness and death and
[1:09:31] tribulation is the fact that you're
[1:09:33] still here
[1:09:35] and we know that if we're still here
[1:09:38] there's a reason for it
[1:09:40] then we know with the advocates in our
[1:09:43] heart and with the holy ghost the spirit
[1:09:45] of truth and the comfort in my heart
[1:09:48] advocating for me i want to be his
[1:09:50] advocate
[1:09:52] i want to do what i'm supposed to do
[1:09:54] because one day when i'm gone mercy
[1:09:57] becomes judgment
[1:09:59] one day when this bride leaves the glory
[1:10:01] of the god goes with it
[1:10:03] do you see now why can you see just
[1:10:05] maybe in another emphasis not changing
[1:10:08] anything and not adding to anything but
[1:10:10] realizing the reason why it's nothing
[1:10:12] but judgment when when the bride is
[1:10:14] raptured is because there's this is the
[1:10:16] only place where the voice of god is
[1:10:19] lived out and lifted up it's the only
[1:10:22] place that you can find truth to be
[1:10:23] saved
[1:10:26] you say saved oh we can get in a huge
[1:10:27] debate about save well let's just say
[1:10:28] saved from tribulation
[1:10:31] saved from death place of waiting
[1:10:33] torment this eternal endless fall
[1:10:36] safe from white throne judgment
[1:10:40] sealed
[1:10:42] and to the day of your redemption
[1:10:45] guaranteed the first resurrection
[1:10:48] placed into the body that will never die
[1:10:50] that'll never stand before the judge but
[1:10:51] we'll actually be in the throne the
[1:10:52] throne in the mercy seat in that place
[1:10:55] dispensing justice and judgment
[1:10:57] absolutely
[1:10:59] we have an advocate let's stand

[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:41] lord have mercy
[1:12:43] just thinking about it now
[1:12:46] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[1:12:50] our gracious heavenly father several
[1:12:54] dozens of hands raised before you today
[1:12:58] each one representing something very
[1:13:01] particular
[1:13:02] very specific
[1:13:05] lord i even know that if a
[1:13:08] husband and wife are raising a hand for
[1:13:10] the same need
[1:13:12] that it impacts them differently
[1:13:16] the consequences are unique to each
[1:13:18] individual
[1:13:19] even while we stand today as the body of
[1:13:21] christ and pray for the same thing we
[1:13:23] would pray differently and we would
[1:13:25] express things from a different
[1:13:26] perspective
[1:13:29] but lord may we in one mind
[1:13:33] one heart and one accord now
[1:13:36] confess that your promises are true
[1:13:40] we believe that today is the day of the
[1:13:42] holy ghost
[1:13:43] that now is the day of salvation
[1:13:47] that there's still healing in the
[1:13:48] atonement
[1:13:49] there's still deliverance in the
[1:13:51] atonement
[1:13:52] that there is still
[1:13:54] an opportunity
[1:13:56] for loved ones to be saved from sin
[1:14:00] still an opportunity for us today to be
[1:14:03] changed from what we were to a new
[1:14:05] creature in christ jesus
[1:14:09] and we have an advocate lord
[1:14:12] even now as we begin to pray that
[1:14:15] causes things to stir within our hearts
[1:14:19] and we express things
[1:14:22] from deep within our hearts
[1:14:26] groanings lord things that we have need
[1:14:28] of desires that we have
[1:14:32] lord i pray today
[1:14:35] that you meet the needs that are
[1:14:36] represented by these hands
[1:14:38] whatever quandary people may find
[1:14:40] themselves however perplexed they may be
[1:14:43] whatever guidance they so long for
[1:14:45] whatever peace that they crave lord may
[1:14:47] you grant it
[1:14:50] may none of your children lord
[1:14:53] be without this blessed peace
[1:14:56] i pray that salvation would come to
[1:14:58] those that require those that need it

[1:15:52] on our journey as christians
[1:15:55] that the house of the lord as it relates
[1:15:57] to a church building

[1:16:02] of the house that i am i am
[1:16:05] the house that we are
