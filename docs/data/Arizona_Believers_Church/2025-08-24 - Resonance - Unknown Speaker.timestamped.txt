[0:00] Psalm 92:es 1-6. It is a good thing to
[0:03] give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing
[0:05] praises unto thy name, oh most high, to
[0:08] show forth thy loving kindness in the
[0:10] morning, and thy faithfulness every
[0:12] night, upon an instrument of 10 strings,
[0:14] and upon the sultry upon the harp with a
[0:16] solemn sound. For thou, Lord, hast made
[0:19] me glad through thy work. I will triumph
[0:21] in the works of thy hands. Oh Lord, how
[0:24] great are thy works, and thy thoughts
[0:25] are very deep. I love that. A brutish
[0:28] man knoweth not. Neither do a fool
[0:30] understand this. Amen. Very rich words.
[0:34] If we could just bow our heads in a word
[0:35] of prayer together, just praying.
[0:39] Our gracious heavenly father, as we have
[0:41] read this word, our desire is that you
[0:43] would bless it
[0:45] could uh open up our hearts to
[0:47] understand it, make it alive to us by
[0:49] revelation. We do realize that there's
[0:51] so many different faculties and things
[0:53] that stand in the way between the
[0:55] written word and the revelation of it in
[0:58] our hearts. But we trust that you today,
[1:00] Lord, can just drive away anything that
[1:02] would hinder, cast out any shadow. Just
[1:05] move freely in this service as this song
[1:07] service has just been tremendous and we
[1:09] sense your presence. We know that you're
[1:10] with us and there's a really good spirit
[1:12] and atmosphere in the church today. Just
[1:13] pray that you take control of this
[1:14] service for your glory. Bless all those
[1:16] that are here. Whatever needs they might
[1:18] have in their heart, whatever questions,
[1:19] whatever concerns, Lord, may it be
[1:21] Christ that is made re made real to
[1:23] them. I ask all this in the name of the
[1:25] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:27] &gt;&gt; You could take your seats. My title
[1:30] today is resonance. And I'll get to what
[1:32] that means maybe here just in a little
[1:34] bit or how I'm intending to use this
[1:37] resonance. As we've been on uh the
[1:39] subject or using the subject of music in
[1:41] these things, I believe that uh
[1:44] residence will be a kind of a concept
[1:46] that's easily to think about as we've
[1:48] been using these different themes on
[1:50] residence. Uh one thing just to maybe uh
[1:53] mention for those who are visiting and
[1:55] those who haven't heard some our last
[1:56] several services been looking at how
[1:58] that there's evil that exists in this
[2:00] world and that God is not known in the
[2:02] absence of evil but there is this
[2:04] paradox that it's the evil that even is
[2:06] declaring God even a lot of different
[2:08] ways that you could look at that and how
[2:11] over the last few services I hope
[2:12] there's been a little bit of a paradigm
[2:14] shift in how we view things that make us
[2:16] uncomfortable and in being willing to
[2:19] accept certain things that are limited
[2:20] ations or human weakness or mastering
[2:22] the thought of human ability. That's
[2:24] when God can reveal himself and make him
[2:26] known. Now, I'd like to start in Matthew
[2:29] 11 uh uh using this subject and this
[2:32] just one word titled resonance. It says
[2:34] in Matthew 11 13-15, for all the
[2:37] prophets and the law prophesied until
[2:40] John and if you will receive it, this is
[2:44] Elias or Elijah that was for to come. So
[2:47] here's Jesus saying that John the
[2:48] Baptist is not the literal Elijah, but
[2:51] he was in the spirit of Elijah that
[2:53] needed to come. He says, "He that hath
[2:56] ears to hear, let him hear." So it's
[2:58] very familiar phrase. I'm actually going
[3:00] to uh undertake uh take an effort to
[3:03] cover every scripture in the New
[3:05] Testament that uses this phrasing. I'm
[3:07] not going to try to break them all down.
[3:08] I think they their meaning uh may be
[3:11] evident, but I want to do it just to
[3:12] kind of overwhelm you with the breadth
[3:14] of it today here in a little bit. It
[3:16] says, "He that hath ears to hear, let
[3:18] him hear." Now, what is it that he's
[3:20] wanting them to hear? He says, "And if
[3:21] you will receive it, this is the Elijah
[3:23] that was prophesied to come." This word
[3:26] receive means to accept and not just to
[3:29] accept and some sort of mental ascent,
[3:31] but there's actually this idea of
[3:33] sustaining or bearing it. If you can
[3:35] receive this, if you can receive it, it
[3:37] means to embrace it or to make it your
[3:38] own. So, if somebody says something,
[3:40] you're like, "Well, I can accept that."
[3:42] Well, that that's more or less
[3:43] acknowledging that there might be
[3:44] something to it, but if you do receive
[3:46] it, you embrace it means to welcome in
[3:50] agreement. This is the Elijah that was
[3:52] to come. And instead of saying, well,
[3:54] that's plausible, or I could see that
[3:56] there's kind of like this response to
[3:58] say, I I I embrace that. I I'm willing
[4:01] to uphold that and sustain that. In
[4:04] Matthew 10:es 30, 39, and 40 says, he
[4:08] that findeth his life shall lose it. He
[4:10] that loseth his life for my sake shall
[4:12] find it. That human instinct to try to
[4:14] preserve our lives runs counter to this
[4:16] idea that if you're just willing to be
[4:18] empty, to be bare, to be naked, that's
[4:20] where you'll find Christ. And in Christ
[4:22] there's life. We've covered that some a
[4:24] little bit lately. But it says, "He that
[4:25] receiveth you receiveth me." He tells
[4:28] them he's going to send them out. When
[4:29] we send you out, he that receives you uh
[4:32] uh um then he that receiveth you not.
[4:35] Then you're to reject them. But here
[4:36] he's saying if they receive you, they
[4:38] receive me. and he that receiveth me
[4:40] receiveth him that sent me. You have to
[4:43] look at this in the sense of something
[4:45] being sent and as it goes out there's
[4:49] one that's there willing to receive or
[4:51] is receptive to the one that was sent.
[4:53] And it's not so much the person but even
[4:55] their message and their gospel. So this
[4:57] response to the word, this response to
[5:00] this is what I'm trying to tell you if
[5:02] you can receive it. It's to agree with
[5:05] and to sustain it.
[5:07] Can you agree? Can you agree? Can you
[5:10] accept this? Can you receive this? So
[5:13] when he says if you can receive this, he
[5:16] that hath ears to hear, let him hear. So
[5:18] this kind of maybe I think a further
[5:20] amplification of what he means by if you
[5:22] can receive this. Ears to hear. That
[5:25] phrase simply means that you have that
[5:26] faculty of understanding and knowing
[5:28] that will allow you to consider and to
[5:31] perceive and ultimately comprehend what
[5:33] I'm saying. He that hath ears to hear,
[5:36] the ability to understand, the ability
[5:38] to comprehend, the ability even to
[5:40] receive, the ability to sustain, to
[5:43] accept, let him hear. In other words, if
[5:47] you have the ability to comprehend, then
[5:50] apprehend it, comprehend it, be endowed
[5:53] with understanding. Learn, comprehend,
[5:55] understand it, grasp it, and hold it and
[5:58] sustain it. that we could see that by
[6:01] these words Jesus is not uh doing a mic
[6:05] check and say how many here can hear me
[6:06] if you can hear me raise your hand. He
[6:08] wasn't just wanting to make sure that
[6:09] the sound waves were reaching the ears.
[6:11] So it's beyond sound waves traveling
[6:13] through the outer ear and then causing
[6:15] the eardrum to vibrate and then this uh
[6:18] more vibrations are going to be in uh
[6:21] converted to electrical signals by hairs
[6:23] in your ear. Got to be careful how much
[6:24] you trim your air ear hair. Then it
[6:28] extends even further than just those
[6:29] electrical signals being sent to the
[6:31] brain through that auditory nerve and
[6:33] then interpreted. That's just the
[6:35] physical process of hearing sound.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; There is a there's uh I find it
[6:42] extremely uh fascinating how that people
[6:45] can hear certain sounds and discern
[6:47] immediately what it is. Uh even if it
[6:50] comes to birds and you look at this, oh
[6:51] that sounds just like this or whatever.
[6:53] And and no that's not it. You know it's
[6:55] that one has a gray tail. And you're
[6:57] like, "What? How do you know the one
[6:58] with the gray tail sounds that way?" But
[7:00] there's just this discernment of thought
[7:02] and that just we can all hear something,
[7:04] but do you hear? We might say sometimes,
[7:06] "I know you hear me, but are you
[7:08] listening, apprehending, accepting?"
[7:10] &gt;&gt; So when he says, "He that hath ears to
[7:12] hear, let him hear." He's saying, "He
[7:14] that has the ability to to receive, let
[7:16] him receive it." Right?
[7:18] &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 6:9, he said, "Go and tell
[7:21] this people, hear ye indeed, but
[7:24] understand not, and you see indeed, but
[7:26] perceive not." This is to the point of
[7:29] what he is saying that you hear, but you
[7:31] do not understand. I'm going to use a
[7:34] word that I'm wanting to emphasize
[7:35] throughout the service. I speak and my
[7:38] word doesn't resonate with you. It's not
[7:41] resonating with the hear. The hear isn't
[7:44] echoing in response to it. If you can
[7:47] receive it, this is the Elijah that was
[7:49] to come. If you can receive it, I am he
[7:50] that liveth forever more. And there's
[7:52] this different things in the scripture.
[7:54] You can say, "This is what the Bible
[7:55] says." And then can you receive it? In
[7:57] other words, there you're receptive to
[7:59] it.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus uses this scripture, Matthew 13:es
[8:03] 9-17.
[8:05] Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
[8:08] This is this common phrase that he uses
[8:10] over and over again. And the disciples
[8:12] came and said unto him, why speakest
[8:14] thou unto them in parables? Now we could
[8:16] say that he he's already somewhat
[8:19] addressed this or maybe even opened up
[8:21] the door for further questioning by
[8:22] saying if you have ears to hear then
[8:24] hear. If you can understand then
[8:26] understand. If you can grasp it, grasp
[8:28] it. Why do you speak in parables? And he
[8:30] answers in verse 11, because it is given
[8:32] unto you to know the mysteries of the
[8:34] kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not
[8:35] given. One has the ability to receive,
[8:37] the other one does not.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; For whosoever hath to him shall be
[8:41] given, he shall have more abundance. So
[8:42] in that ability to receive, you can
[8:44] receive more. But whosoever hath not,
[8:46] from him shall be taken away, even that
[8:48] he hath. It's quite a a consequence.
[8:52] Therefore speak I to them in parables,
[8:54] but seeing they see not, and hearing
[8:57] they hear not, neither do they
[8:59] understand. That's the concept between
[9:01] behind. He that hath an ear to hear, let
[9:03] him hear. He that has the ability to
[9:05] understand, let him receive
[9:07] understanding. And in them is fulfilled
[9:10] the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by
[9:11] hearing you shall hear and shall not
[9:13] understand and see and you shall see and
[9:15] shall not perceive. For this people's
[9:18] heart is waxed gross. I guess that's
[9:20] better than your ears waxing gross. And
[9:23] their ears are dull of hearing and their
[9:25] eyes they have closed lest at any time
[9:27] they should see with their eyes and hear
[9:29] with their ears. And again this emphasis
[9:31] and should understand with their heart.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So beyond the physical capacity to
[9:37] see and the physical ability to hear
[9:40] there's some uh interpretation process
[9:42] or this processing wherein the mind will
[9:44] grasp and he says here that they
[9:46] understand with their heart and if this
[9:49] understanding they be converted and I
[9:52] should heal them. Then he says blessed
[9:55] are your eyes for they see and your ears
[9:57] for they hear. This is a different
[9:59] capacity. This is a different ability.
[10:00] For verily I say to you that many
[10:02] prophets and righteous men have desired
[10:03] to see those things which you see and
[10:05] have not seen and to hear those things
[10:07] which you hear and have not heard them.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; I heard a brother I believe from Africa
[10:12] one time say that God has given you an e
[10:14] a r in your h e a r t in order to h e a
[10:18] r. I was like I like that. You have an
[10:21] ear and your heart to hear.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; It's in the heart. A
[10:24] &gt;&gt; and that's for that's what God has given
[10:26] you. You see they have a heart. They
[10:28] have a mind. They have a spirit. They
[10:29] have the brain. They have the auditory
[10:30] nerve. Everything's working perfectly. I
[10:32] had a hearing test and I can hear I can
[10:34] hear a dog whistle. You know there you
[10:36] have perfect ears. But this is not what
[10:38] Jesus is talking about.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Talking about a heart that is able to
[10:43] comprehend and to learn.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; And I'm wanting to use a phrase here
[10:47] because I see this in that Jesus is
[10:49] speaking the word and and how is it
[10:52] being received? I want to use this term
[10:54] resonance
[10:55] as a way of addressing this uh our lives
[10:58] and our attitude towards the word of
[11:00] God. Maybe a number of different ways
[11:01] that we could put this. And I found that
[11:04] as I began to as I've been studying on
[11:07] this and and leading up to this thought
[11:09] didn't know exactly where it would fit,
[11:11] there's a lot I realize that I I tend to
[11:14] get just get lost in it. And you realize
[11:16] that music is very mathematical. So it
[11:18] almost seems to be endless the way that
[11:19] you can look at it. There's a science of
[11:21] music. There's a science of resonance.
[11:23] There's all sorts of different elements.
[11:25] Uh if you really start getting into this
[11:27] and if you want to take an upper level
[11:29] course, just subscribe to my Patreon and
[11:32] and we'll get into it. But there is
[11:34] there's even ideas to resonance being
[11:37] tied to motive and music motive. So
[11:39] there's a lot there. I'm like, wow, this
[11:41] is amazing. I'm going to try to keep it
[11:42] very very simple that resonance is I
[11:45] might say the efficient transfer but the
[11:47] transfer and even amplification of
[11:49] energy at particular frequencies we can
[11:52] say that's resonant frequencies and so
[11:54] you you talk about some sort of physical
[11:56] system or musical instrument they
[11:58] vibrate with a greater amplitude at a
[12:01] specific or certain frequency and that's
[12:02] their resonant or natural frequency
[12:06] &gt;&gt; in Psalms 92:3 is he said hey it's good
[12:09] that we give thanks
[12:11] And that and we give praise. He says
[12:14] upon the instrument of 10 strings and
[12:16] upon the sultry and upon the harp with a
[12:18] solemn sound. So we know that in the
[12:21] context here he's saying great are thy
[12:23] works and they're wonderful. We're going
[12:25] to worship you. And he says a brutish
[12:27] man doesn't know neither does a fool
[12:28] understand this. So God's works are
[12:30] being done. And in them being done the
[12:33] fool doesn't understand. The brutish man
[12:35] doesn't understand. They don't
[12:37] comprehend it. The works are are
[12:39] vibrating. The works are radiating. The
[12:41] works are emitting. But yet the person
[12:43] who sees it can't or can't catch what it
[12:46] is as the hand of God. And I believe
[12:49] it's wonderful to see that there's this
[12:52] type or analogy or this representation
[12:54] of it in verse three where upon the
[12:56] instrument of 10 strings upon the sultry
[12:58] and upon the harp that there's one that
[13:00] would strike those strings and and strum
[13:03] those strings. And as they play, he says
[13:05] they play with the solemn sound or a
[13:08] resounding music or they resonate.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; A resonating sound. That would be a
[13:14] pleasing sound. It wouldn't be a a harsh
[13:16] sound that would make you repulse, but
[13:18] it's a pleasing sound because this
[13:20] resonance is it's really important in
[13:23] terms of producing music, making music,
[13:25] and even listening and enjoying or
[13:27] perceiving music. A lot of different
[13:30] ways that resonance shapes our our
[13:32] experience.
[13:34] But instead of getting, you know,
[13:36] further into that resonance aspect in
[13:39] music, there's this concept of in order
[13:42] for these instruments to give a a
[13:44] resonant sound or a solemn sound, the
[13:48] instrument has to be in tune.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; And I think this is uh there's a lot of
[13:54] different ways that we could demonstrate
[13:55] this that there a solemn sound implies
[13:59] that it's not just going up to a harp
[14:01] and going
[14:04] Right? And I know there's even something
[14:06] to the piano that if you start on one
[14:07] side and go all to the end, there's
[14:08] something pleasing about it. Right?
[14:09] Because that's the way that it's tuned.
[14:12] But this tuning is an intentional
[14:16] alignment
[14:18] of an instrument's resonance.
[14:20] So if an instrument has a natural
[14:23] frequency, when you tune it, uh uh
[14:26] there's this intentionality to it to
[14:28] where you want to tune its resonance.
[14:29] How is it vibrating?
[14:32] And this even applies to the alignment
[14:35] of a listener and how they align
[14:38] themselves.
[14:39] When you tune an instrument, you tighten
[14:41] a guitar string, you might open the
[14:42] trumpet's valve. There's different
[14:44] things that you can do. Even in singing,
[14:45] you can reshape your mouth. There's ways
[14:47] that you can uh take things to change
[14:49] your resonance or find that tune.
[14:52] And this is what I'm wanting to use as
[14:54] this natural principle. And in that the
[14:57] natural types, the spiritual, that there
[14:59] is a solemn sound. there's a resounding
[15:01] music. There's something vibrating
[15:04] and that something has to be tuned uh
[15:07] that that needs to be in that right tune
[15:08] in order for there to be that natural
[15:10] resonance.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Now, this may be where it might seem
[15:14] like we slow down a bit, but I'm just I
[15:16] felt impressed to actually do this um
[15:19] almost just to overwhelm you. I'm often
[15:21] accused of that is a lot. Well, I want
[15:23] to keep my streak going. In Ezekiel 3
[15:26] 27, but when I speak with thee, I will
[15:28] open my mouth and thou shalt say unto
[15:31] them, thus sayaeth the Lord. So there is
[15:33] this tuning, this opening of the mouth.
[15:36] I'm going to shape my mouth. I'm going
[15:38] to speak words. There's going to be
[15:39] something vibrations that go forth. He
[15:43] that heareth, let him hear, and he that
[15:46] forbeareth, let him forebear, for they
[15:47] are a rebellious house. One that hears,
[15:50] and one that does not hear.
[15:53] one that will hear and then when he
[15:55] hears he yields he obeys. But the
[15:57] rebellious they will rebel. So he that
[16:00] heareth my words when I speak, when I
[16:02] open up my mouth, when I form these
[16:05] words, when they begin to be declared
[16:07] from you, let him that heareth
[16:10] and we could I maybe we can even take
[16:12] this and say he that has who heareth and
[16:14] actually can uh naturally discern the
[16:19] articulation and know the language that
[16:21] it's spoken. And then I hear what you're
[16:23] saying. I just don't agree with you. But
[16:24] he's saying, "He that hears, let him
[16:26] understand. Let him receive and accept."
[16:29] &gt;&gt; So it points out that there's this
[16:31] quality or characteristic of the hearer
[16:34] allowing the word to resonate in them.
[16:37] We might be able to say, "Amen."
[16:40] &gt;&gt; That the word says something and the
[16:41] hearer says, "I accept that. I receive
[16:43] that. I amen that."
[16:46] &gt;&gt; The one for forbears maybe is rejecting
[16:48] it. Now let's just look at this. I want
[16:50] to cover many scriptures. Uh, and we're
[16:52] doing it try to do it quickly, but I
[16:53] want to do this for emphasis. Matthew
[16:55] chapter 13:43, then shall the righteous
[16:58] shine forth as the son in the kingdom of
[17:00] their father. Who hath ears to hear, let
[17:02] him hear.
[17:04] Says it in Mark 4:9, he that hath ears
[17:07] to hear, let him hear. Verse 23, if any
[17:10] man have ears to hear, let him hear.
[17:13] Chapter 7 16, if any man have ears to
[17:15] hear, let him hear. Jesus repeating this
[17:18] over and over again, the same phrase, he
[17:21] that hath ears to hear, then hear. If
[17:24] you can hear, if you have the ability,
[17:27] now you might if I I guess maybe this is
[17:29] just me starting maybe to riff on this a
[17:31] little bit, but in other words, if you
[17:33] don't have ears, just admit it,
[17:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[17:36] &gt;&gt; I mean, if you can't hear, I think I
[17:38] told the story before where my dad was
[17:39] getting working for his his dad and he
[17:42] was on an army base and or a military
[17:44] base and didn't have the right
[17:45] credentials. I think it was the Marine
[17:46] base there in San Diego. And a guard
[17:48] walked up there and started saying,
[17:49] "Hey, I need to see your uh your permit,
[17:52] your licensing. You have to have a pass
[17:53] to work on the base." And my dad said,
[17:55] "No, ablings."
[17:57] And then the the MP began to rattle off
[17:59] perfect Spanish. And so he said, "Paul
[18:02] vu fr." You know, he had been had just
[18:05] admit it, right? Just admit you don't
[18:07] know. Admit you can't understand. Admit
[18:09] you don't hear. He said, "If you claim
[18:11] to know, if you claim to hear, then
[18:13] hear. Amen. Right.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; But if you don't hear, just admit it.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; Luke 8:8. Another fell on good ground. I
[18:20] know I'm not looking into the context of
[18:22] this. And sprang up and bear fruit
[18:24] hundfold. And when he had said these
[18:26] things, he cried, "He that hath ears to
[18:28] hear, let him hear."
[18:30] He says this over and over again. It has
[18:32] weight behind it. He has meaning.
[18:35] A and it doesn't just mean, "Did you
[18:37] hear me? I I want to be sure that you're
[18:39] writing this down and and I hope the
[18:42] acoustics are good enough." No. If you
[18:44] can understand it, understand it.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; It should at the very least prick our
[18:48] hearts to say, "Oh, I do want to
[18:51] understand. I do want to hear."
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Chapter 14:35. It is neither fit for the
[18:56] land, nor yet for the dung hill, but men
[18:58] cast it out. He that hath ears to hear,
[19:00] let him hear. Jesus uses this. It's
[19:03] identified with him. It's a phrase that
[19:05] comes to uh be that he uses as the son
[19:09] of man over and over again to make his
[19:11] point. Then we find in the book of
[19:13] revelation 13:9 and if any man have an
[19:16] ear let him hear
[19:18] though those whose hearts have been
[19:20] circumcised by the spirit to hear
[19:23] the word in other to understand it to
[19:25] fall in love with it to for to provoke
[19:27] faith he that hath ears to hear let him
[19:30] hear
[19:33] in revelations chapter 2 and three we
[19:35] see that there's in the address of
[19:37] Christ to the messenger of each age and
[19:40] even to the age he Seven churches of
[19:42] Asia Asia. There is one characteristic
[19:46] attributable to each age or that is
[19:48] said, one phrase or saying that Christ
[19:50] says in every age. Revelations 2:7, he
[19:53] that hath ear to hear, let him hear what
[19:55] the spirit saith unto the churches. To
[19:57] him that overcomemeth will I give to eat
[19:59] of the tree of life which is in the
[20:00] midst of the paradise of God. Verse 11,
[20:03] he that hath an ear to hear, let him
[20:04] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[20:06] churches. He that overcomemeth shall not
[20:08] be hurt of the second death.
[20:13] Verse 17. He that hath an ear to hear,
[20:14] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[20:16] the churches. To him that overcomemeth
[20:18] will I give to eat of the hidden man,
[20:19] and will give him a white stone, and in
[20:21] the stone a new name written, which no
[20:23] man knoweth, saying, he that receiveth
[20:25] it. In verse 29, he hath an ear, let him
[20:28] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[20:29] churches. Chapter 3 6, he that hath an
[20:32] ear, let him hear what the spirit saith
[20:33] unto the churches. Verse 13, he that
[20:35] hath an ear, let him hear what the
[20:37] spirit saith unto the churches. Verse
[20:38] 22, he that hath an ear, let him hear
[20:40] what the spirit saith unto the churches.
[20:44] This is not this is not just some kind
[20:46] of passing phrase and we're just going
[20:47] to try and hang our hat on a comma, but
[20:49] we're looking at something that there's
[20:51] this over this emphasis over and over
[20:53] again of how words spoken, red letter
[20:57] words of Jesus Christ are being spoken
[20:59] and it's not in the ability to read or
[21:02] to hear from a natural intellectual
[21:05] academic standpoint, but it's like can
[21:08] you grasp this spiritually?
[21:12] How hard is your heart to where you
[21:13] can't receive it? How open are is your
[21:16] heart to receive the word? How trusting
[21:18] are you in God to reveal himself?
[21:21] &gt;&gt; How confident are you in your own
[21:23] ability
[21:24] &gt;&gt; to find truth? Or are you willing to be
[21:26] naked and let truth clothe you?
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Pride is a nasty thing.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; It's pride that drove the Leodysans to
[21:36] say, "I've got all the answers. I'm rich
[21:38] and I'm increased with good. I have a
[21:40] need of nothing. I'm self- sustaining. I
[21:42] can figure this out. And doesn't realize
[21:43] that they're absolutely naked and don't
[21:47] have anything at all.
[21:49] The Bible says, "If you have an ear to
[21:51] hear, let them hear." That's the most
[21:53] critical thing.
[21:55] I if you if you're if you're blind, if
[21:59] you're naked, if you're wretched, if
[22:00] you're lying in darkness, if you have an
[22:02] ear to hear,
[22:04] then you can hear. Buy of me gold tried
[22:07] in the fire. Then you could hear what
[22:09] right white raignment that you may be
[22:11] clothed is that you may be may see. This
[22:15] is such a important characteristic
[22:19] and I believe it demonstrates the
[22:21] necessity
[22:22] of being tuned to the word of God and
[22:25] then staying in tune.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; It's that intentional alignment has to
[22:29] do with attitude.
[22:31] And I'm I'm focusing on this concept of
[22:33] resonance. But there it takes a tuning
[22:38] to meet that optimal frequency that that
[22:41] uh efficient transfer of energy
[22:45] in 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 5. I
[22:47] apologize I didn't have this do not have
[22:50] this scripture on a slide but I'll read
[22:52] it here for you. 2 Corinthians chapter
[22:54] 10:5 casting down imaginations
[22:57] and every high thing that exaltth itself
[22:59] against the knowledge of God and
[23:00] bringing into captivity every thought to
[23:02] the obedience of Christ. This is a
[23:04] really good way of saying this is
[23:05] tuning.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; This is the process of tuning certain
[23:10] things out. Uh honing things in. And it
[23:14] says casting down imaginations. I
[23:15] believe I've referred to imagination uh
[23:18] quite frequently as of late. It's a
[23:20] subject that's merits its own
[23:23] examination. But here casting down
[23:25] imaginations, it's kind of like this
[23:27] doubtful thinking or pondering. And it's
[23:29] this imagination which is back and forth
[23:32] reasoning. That's right.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; Almost like an echo chamber.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; And I've emphasized this before, but I
[23:39] want to repeat it now that it given our
[23:42] human instincts and our human abilities.
[23:45] Imagination is one of our great
[23:47] strengths, one of our great abilities.
[23:50] And it's a our imagination that tries to
[23:52] fill the void through which grace wants
[23:54] to flow.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; That when I am weak, you are strong. Our
[23:58] imagination wants to fill in the
[24:00] weakness. Our imagination wants to
[24:01] reinterpret the weakness. Our
[24:03] imagination stares into the darkness.
[24:05] And what does it start to do? Interpret
[24:06] the darkness.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; It tries to explain evil. It tries to
[24:11] make sense of darkness. It tries to
[24:12] interpret the flaws. That's what
[24:14] imagination does. But remember,
[24:15] imagination is just a feeler.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; It's the devil's botox.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; It's a liar.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Imagination
[24:28] is what forms and manipulates images.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; There doesn't need to be a true one. You
[24:33] can just imagine it.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; AI is the manifestation of our
[24:38] imagination.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; It's not uh artificial intelligence.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; It's artificial imagination.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; It's just been synthesized.
[24:48] Think of the dreams you dream. And
[24:50] everybody's like, "Oh boy." Yeah.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; You were AI before there was AI, right?
[24:55] you were producing images and creating
[24:57] things and all sorts of weird stuff long
[24:59] before your computer could do it.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; And so it's the imagination. And listen,
[25:05] the imagination is like one of the
[25:06] greatest evils. If not, I don't mean to
[25:09] kind of try to change the whole
[25:10] narrative, but that's what he caused the
[25:12] woman to do in the beginning is to
[25:14] imagine
[25:16] &gt;&gt; something that didn't exist.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Well, you don't really know what God
[25:20] means. And what did she do? She imagined
[25:24] &gt;&gt; where where you could create space,
[25:26] create wiggle room, create darkness,
[25:28] create a void. Our imagination hates it.
[25:30] Nature abhores a vacuum. Oh, I got I
[25:32] don't understand. I got to fill that in.
[25:33] I got to make sense of it.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; You know what will do? Your imagination.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; But when you just say, "I'm going to
[25:39] cast that down."
[25:40] &gt;&gt; It leaves an emptiness and it leaves a
[25:43] void. And therefore, where there's a
[25:45] void and there's an absence, grace or
[25:47] God can step into that. But as long as
[25:50] we fill up the uncomfortable space with
[25:52] ourselves and our imagination, God will
[25:55] never step in.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Because imagination fills in the gaps
[25:59] that grace wants to fill.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; It is our great human ability that we
[26:04] have to master what the thought,
[26:07] &gt;&gt; the imagination of human ability.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; We're not just This could be said of
[26:13] everything. Anything that exists is
[26:16] comprised of certain elements,
[26:17] electrons, atoms, and then what do they
[26:19] do? They vibrate.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; It's a vibration. I'm not going to get
[26:22] into some of the witchcraft on holistic
[26:25] healing.
[26:27] You know, like I can just whack you over
[26:28] the head with a tuna salad and that the
[26:32] vibrations of that omega-3 acids or fats
[26:35] in the tuna will will cleanse your
[26:38] colon. But we're talking about all of
[26:41] us. Even as humans, we're not lifeless,
[26:44] inanimate objects.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; All nature vibrates.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; And with vibrations, it interacts with
[26:50] forces. This is true of everything.
[26:52] That's why we have sound. That's why
[26:54] there there's motion and movement with
[26:55] everything. Anything that has life,
[26:57] anything that is comprised of natural
[26:59] elements vibrates.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; And that's what instruments are in a
[27:03] musical context. They're just they're
[27:05] they're systems that essentially produce
[27:07] vibrations or frequency.
[27:10] And it's those vibrations that we
[27:12] translate to sound.
[27:15] And so the tuning when you tune
[27:16] something, it's that process of
[27:18] adjusting the pitch until it forms that
[27:20] desired arrangement, that natural
[27:23] frequency or vibration, the natural
[27:25] resonance.
[27:28] I want us to consider our own lives in
[27:29] terms of how uh you know are what how
[27:33] what how does God resonate
[27:36] with us? There's good and there's evil.
[27:38] Does good resonate with you or does
[27:40] evil?
[27:41] &gt;&gt; It's a good question. Which way are we
[27:44] tuned?
[27:45] &gt;&gt; How are we aligned? What I if there's
[27:48] things in the world and we hear things
[27:50] in the world and we feed on it
[27:53] is do we um listen to a podcast and we
[27:56] hear Nancy in Tennessee's draft board
[27:58] for the fantasy draft. Uh do we resonate
[28:01] with her number one pick? Like is that
[28:03] where we're like, you know, she's got
[28:04] some really good good thoughts on this.
[28:06] I appreciate her hot sports opinions.
[28:08] I'm going to take a tight end with my
[28:10] number one pick. That that should tell
[28:13] you something. I mean, if those things
[28:14] are easy to grasp, but then the word of
[28:16] God come,
[28:18] &gt;&gt; right? There's a certain alignment or
[28:20] tuning in your spirit where you're more
[28:22] sensitive to the vibrations of the world
[28:25] &gt;&gt; and less in tune to the spiritual things
[28:28] of God.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Galatians 5:16, this I say then, walk in
[28:33] the spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[28:35] lust of the flesh.
[28:37] I I I I want everyone to read this.
[28:39] Let's try to read it together. or those
[28:40] who brought your Bibles or your apps or
[28:42] those of you who have it intuitively by
[28:45] holistic reading. Walk in the spirit and
[28:48] you shall It's homeopathic is what I'm
[28:49] going for there. Walk in the spirit and
[28:51] you shall not fulfill the lust of the
[28:53] flesh.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Say it. Walk in the spirit and you shall
[28:57] not fulfill the lust of the flesh. I
[29:00] feel like a real church now.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; That is thus sayaith the Lord.
[29:08] Walk in the spirit. There's a a channel
[29:14] there. There there there's a pocket, an
[29:15] envelope. You're in it.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Walk in the spirit. I I found this
[29:20] frequency. I found this channel. I want
[29:22] to walk in the spirit. And as long as
[29:24] I'm in that spirit, I cannot I will not
[29:26] fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; There's something that's being
[29:30] emphasized here in terms of this
[29:32] continuity of walking in the spirit.
[29:34] Resonance is not just about frequency,
[29:36] but it's about coherence. And all the
[29:38] musicians said,
[29:39] &gt;&gt; "Amen." Didn't expect Brother Andrew
[29:42] Coffee to be the one to pick up on that,
[29:44] but I'm happy nonetheless. He is a
[29:46] doctor and stayed at a Holiday in
[29:48] Express recently.
[29:51] Resonance is not only about frequency or
[29:54] vibrations, but coherence.
[29:56] The lust of the flesh are those things
[29:58] that are in congruent with Christ.
[30:01] There are lust of the flesh which are
[30:03] antirist that aren't congruent with the
[30:06] spirit, the fruits of the spirit. Walk
[30:08] in the spirit. This particular tuning or
[30:11] subjection to the spirit and there's a
[30:13] way in which those things get canceled
[30:15] out.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Coherence in music is when different
[30:19] sounds work together without
[30:21] interference.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Don't mean to make the sound guys
[30:24] uncomfortable, but we all know what
[30:25] interference can sound like.
[30:28] When energy is coherent, nature responds
[30:31] with resonance.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; That powerful powerful amplification of
[30:36] energy. Could be energy, but we're
[30:38] talking about a powerful amplification.
[30:41] And so when there's sound waves and
[30:43] there's frequencies,
[30:45] the sound waves can overlap
[30:48] &gt;&gt; and when they overlap, they can either
[30:50] reinforce each other or they cancel each
[30:53] other out.
[30:55] I hope that you can begin to think about
[30:57] this very deeply that there can be ways
[31:00] or vibrations
[31:02] from the word of God
[31:04] and if they can overlap in such a way to
[31:07] where you're causing them to cancel out
[31:10] &gt;&gt; because it's it's not tuned
[31:13] &gt;&gt; it the timing if resonance teach taught
[31:15] me anything timing is important
[31:19] &gt;&gt; and so when they overlap correctly it's
[31:22] called constructive interference
[31:25] It's when these these waves of energy
[31:28] align in a phase. And I don't know that
[31:30] my hand motion should be interpreted as
[31:32] being accurate. Uh objects in this image
[31:36] may be larger than they appear.
[31:39] But it accumulates when they are in a
[31:41] line. When they sink in a phase, when
[31:43] they align. This energy is aligning in a
[31:45] phase. It accumulates with each cycle.
[31:48] It's getting stronger. These on an
[31:51] instrument. These periodic forces, they
[31:53] sync with the instruments natural
[31:55] resonance. It's natural vibrations or
[31:57] oscillation and it allows energy to
[31:59] build.
[32:01] And if you're if you're confused about
[32:03] this, as I studied and read this, a lot
[32:04] of different places give this example.
[32:06] Wikipedia is one of them about the
[32:07] example of being on a swing. You're
[32:10] pushing your child on a swing. So all of
[32:11] us now can begin to say, "Okay, here we
[32:12] are. This is starting to make more
[32:14] sense." And you know when you get on a
[32:16] swing, there's even a way where your own
[32:18] rhythm. You got to know just the right
[32:20] time to pull and when to push, right?
[32:22] When the legs are kicked out, let's go
[32:24] back. If you want to, you really want to
[32:26] enjoy and get a kick. Watch me do chair
[32:28] exercises and try to get my left arm to
[32:30] do differently than my left leg and
[32:32] things like that. It's like got to get
[32:33] things in sync. And so if you want to
[32:36] swing, you want to know the right moment
[32:38] to push and to pull, to kick. And so if
[32:41] you're pushing someone on a swing that
[32:43] if you at the right moment if you just
[32:45] give it you give it another push what
[32:47] begins to happen not even necessarily
[32:49] increasing uh force but just that
[32:52] consistent and it's going to it gets it
[32:55] it begins to swing with this greater
[32:56] momentum and the more force you can give
[32:58] it if you catch it in its natural rhythm
[33:00] it amplifies and amplifies where each
[33:01] welltimed push adds energy in the same
[33:04] direction as the motion
[33:09] &gt;&gt; and this is what this is how you you
[33:11] build it builds. It's one comes this way
[33:15] as the energy's coming. If another inter
[33:17] if another force or frequency interacts
[33:20] with it and it's constructive and it
[33:22] aligns, there's more energy.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; In John 10:es 24-31 says, "Then came the
[33:28] Jews round about him and said unto him,
[33:30] how long does thou make us doubt? If
[33:32] thou be the Christ, tell us plainly." I
[33:34] love this.
[33:37] There was this attitude of we just can't
[33:39] be sure.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered them,"I told you and you
[33:43] believed not."
[33:46] &gt;&gt; I told you
[33:48] &gt;&gt; the works that I do in my father's name,
[33:50] they bear witness of me. But ye believed
[33:53] not because you are not of my sheep as I
[33:55] said unto you. It's it's not a question
[33:57] of well, we just we're not sure because
[33:59] he doesn't say. He kind of hides it.
[34:01] It's ambiguous. He's saying you you
[34:02] won't believe me because you're not of
[34:04] my sheep. My sheep hear my voice and I
[34:06] know them and they follow me. Here's
[34:08] that voice. That that child's ability to
[34:12] know their parents' voice. And I give
[34:15] them unto them eternal life and they
[34:17] shall never perish. Neither shall any
[34:18] man pluck them out of my hand. I tried
[34:21] to find a musical connection there.
[34:23] There's not one. My father which gave
[34:25] them me is greater than all. And no man
[34:27] is able to pluck them out of my father's
[34:28] hand. I and my father are one. Amen.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; There's this this constructive
[34:35] overlapping, this synergy, this he's
[34:37] resonating. I am my father one. Here I
[34:39] am. I am declaring the father. I'm
[34:43] speaking of the father. Then the Jews
[34:44] took up stones again to stone him. Again
[34:47] to stone him. In other words, he had
[34:49] told them before. They just didn't
[34:50] believe it.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; There was no, if I could say, resonance
[34:54] established.
[34:56] The word was not striking a resonant
[34:58] tone in their heart. If anything, it was
[35:00] some as the word went forth and it's
[35:02] vibrating and it's coming. It was they
[35:05] it it struck them away.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; And we could even look at this in the
[35:10] sense that say, well, I'm either I'm
[35:12] either uh elect or non-elect. But I want
[35:14] to I want to look at this in the sense
[35:15] of the tuning.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; There's many that walked with them that
[35:19] then repented or that walked away. And
[35:22] then there's those who fought him then
[35:23] that relent. Like what was Paul doing
[35:25] when he was blaspheing?
[35:28] he was out of tune.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; You could have incorrect tuning.
[35:33] Something's tuned a certain way and it's
[35:34] just completely out of tune. Or it, as
[35:37] people who live in Arizona know that the
[35:39] wrong kind of atmosphere, really, really
[35:41] hot or dry, can damage and warp an
[35:43] instrument in places of high humidity.
[35:45] It can change the tuning of an
[35:46] instrument. And so the atmosphere and
[35:49] environment can significantly re uh
[35:51] reduce what's called tuning stability
[35:53] &gt;&gt; or the tune stability begins to lose its
[35:56] tune by the atmosphere. the environment.
[35:59] What do you think happens when we
[36:00] immerse ourselves in worldly things?
[36:03] &gt;&gt; You don't become unelect.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; I I can't binge watch the whole Star
[36:08] Wars tri trilogy or whatever it is. I'm
[36:11] not sure which one it is or how many
[36:13] there are, but whatever prequels,
[36:15] sequels, or midquels there are, you
[36:17] can't just binge that and become
[36:18] non-elect.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; But you can severely get out of tune.
[36:23] Yeah.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; You get out of tune and the next thing
[36:25] you know something happens or something
[36:27] is said and and you read something or
[36:29] you hear something and it's just not
[36:31] resonating with you. You're not moved by
[36:33] it.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; You're you're you're you could just sit
[36:36] there and kind of hear the greatest
[36:38] sermon that brother Aaron ever preached
[36:39] and just kind of like
[36:41] &gt;&gt; like you're you're not even in tune
[36:43] enough to know that he's doing better.
[36:47] Like is he eating his waties? What's
[36:49] going on here? Whatever you're doing,
[36:52] keep doing it, buddy. Right? You're just
[36:54] tuned out.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Got to have it. And it's influences and
[37:02] factors that de-une us.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; These that were hearing his voice, they
[37:07] were they were out of tune.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Chapter 5, the same thing happens. We'll
[37:11] just read verses 37 to 38. And the
[37:13] father himself which has sent me have
[37:14] borne witness of me. You have neither
[37:16] heard his voice at any time nor seen his
[37:18] shape. But yet there was something now
[37:21] that's declaring it. And ye have not his
[37:23] word abiding in you. For he whom he hath
[37:25] sent him ye believe not.
[37:28] Here they are walking with the Messiah.
[37:30] And they lack the ability to respond in
[37:33] the right way to Christ.
[37:36] He's ma making himself known. He's
[37:39] vibrating. These vibrations are striking
[37:41] their hearts, their eyes, their ears,
[37:43] their whole life. They're seeing signs
[37:44] and wonders and miracles. And what do
[37:45] they become? Brutish. They become
[37:48] foolish. They're not receptive. They
[37:49] they take the miracles, the signs, and
[37:51] the wonders, and everything that he
[37:52] says, and they start twisting it and
[37:53] tearing it apart. They're not tuned to
[37:55] it.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; And I want us to understand this. I was
[37:58] even going to use the scripture in Acts
[37:59] where he says, King Agria says, "Man,
[38:01] Paul, you almost persuaded me to be a
[38:03] Christian."
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Almost. What was King Fesus said,
[38:07] "You're mad, Paul, you're insane. Think
[38:09] about the stuff you're trying to say.
[38:11] You want me to believe this? You want me
[38:12] to believe that? This is silly. This
[38:14] doesn't make sense. There's nothing to
[38:15] this."
[38:16] And Paul said, 'I I wish you were just
[38:19] like me except for my bonds. And he even
[38:20] looked at agria says, 'You know deep
[38:22] down in your heart. You know I'm not
[38:24] mad.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; You know, you know I'm not mad. You know
[38:29] the things I say to you are true. And
[38:30] what did agria said? Almost persuaded.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; And I want us to recognize that our
[38:36] spirits are susceptible to the same
[38:37] dynamic
[38:39] &gt;&gt; if our hearts are not tuned to his word.
[38:43] unbelief in and even doubting or just
[38:45] manifestations of a lack of tuning to
[38:47] the word
[38:50] &gt;&gt; when you have
[38:53] uh if there's constructive interference
[38:57] and I think that's what we all try to
[38:58] run right I'm trying to run some
[39:00] constructive interference here but
[39:02] there's also destructive interference
[39:05] and what's remarkable I alluded it to it
[39:07] to it a moment ago constructive
[39:08] interference is when uh waves of even
[39:11] the same frequency align line,
[39:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:15] &gt;&gt; And and so they they align together and
[39:18] therefore it amplifies it. Clarity when
[39:21] it resonates clarity
[39:23] &gt;&gt; from a musical perspective. That's what
[39:25] gives us this pleasure and this
[39:26] enjoyment of a sound. But destructive
[39:29] interference is when two wavelengths of
[39:31] the same frequency,
[39:35] the same frequency, they overlap
[39:38] incorrectly and the amplitudes cancel.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Right?
[39:42] So you can have something traveling in
[39:44] the same frequency like this is the way
[39:46] it should be and then something else
[39:47] just gets out of tune and out of sync.
[39:50] It's of the same frequency and instead
[39:52] of it saying oh wow this is this is
[39:55] right this is right they cancel each
[39:57] other out.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Are you thinking about that?
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Very simple very simple thought.
[40:06] This is why tuning is so important.
[40:10] Galatians chapter 5 25.
[40:13] If we live in the spirit, let us also
[40:15] walk in the spirit.
[40:17] If we live in the spirit, let us also
[40:19] walk in the spirit.
[40:21] If an object resonates at a frequency,
[40:24] anything with the same natural resonance
[40:27] responds.
[40:30] I I almost felt like I was breaking new
[40:32] ground. Nobody's ever thought of that
[40:34] before. If a object with a certain
[40:36] natural frequency resonates at that
[40:38] frequency, anything of the same
[40:40] frequency is affected by it, responds.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; In other words, that frequency
[40:45] activates, it vibrates,
[40:47] &gt;&gt; starts vibrating at the same frequency.
[40:49] Guitar I'll maybe get into maybe more of
[40:51] this on Wednesday night. I think a
[40:53] guitar string plucked, a certain chord
[40:54] plucked will resonate another guitar
[40:57] that's not being played. That same
[40:59] string that's tuned that it begins to
[41:01] vibrate in response.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Not even being played. Yeah.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; What happens when the new birth comes
[41:08] into our lives? Our soul is tuned to the
[41:11] word of God.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Our soul is a and the soul is sealed by
[41:16] the new birth. That's the that's the
[41:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost. You're sealed
[41:19] by one spirit. We're all baptized into
[41:21] one body. And so the soul then has that
[41:24] sense of faith. What resonates what the
[41:26] frequency that's on and what it
[41:27] resonates with is faith. The word of
[41:29] God.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Faith and the word of God. They align in
[41:32] that phase. And that that's the that's
[41:34] the resonance. Faith is going to the
[41:35] word's going to resonate with your
[41:36] faith.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Yet we still have this body and this
[41:40] spirit that stands in between. And it's
[41:42] praying. And I say these are very simple
[41:45] concepts, but praying and reading our
[41:46] Bibles are critical to staying keeping
[41:49] our spirits in tune.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; That our soul being sealed is it's going
[41:54] to resonate with the word of God. But if
[41:57] you if you have these other things
[41:59] happening in your spirit, then that it's
[42:01] not going to get there. There's maybe
[42:03] artificial dampeners. There's things
[42:04] that are keeping the word from getting
[42:06] to your heart because your spirit needs
[42:08] tuning by prayer
[42:10] &gt;&gt; and by reading your Bible.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; I will say this, if your soul is not
[42:15] tuned, and I think maybe I can make this
[42:18] uh uh make it this part of that fulcrum
[42:20] to get to the end. I Lord willing, I'd
[42:22] like to be uh more than just physically
[42:25] short today. I would like to be able to
[42:27] be short in my sermon because I've been
[42:29] going too long lately.
[42:32] If only long sermons could make you
[42:34] taller.
[42:37] Some people would be like 80 feet tall.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; But if your soul is not tuned,
[42:45] you'll spiritually be in and out of tune
[42:48] &gt;&gt; based solely on external forces.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; If the soul is not tuned to the word,
[42:54] anything can come by tune you.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Anything.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Somebody could come by and say, "Oh, no,
[42:59] that's not right. Let me tune you to uh
[43:02] to this. Right? You're like, you're now
[43:05] now you're playing in the tune of an
[43:07] eighth messenger. Right? I'm playing in
[43:10] the tune of tapes only. I'm playing in
[43:13] the tune of this. I'm playing the tune
[43:14] of that. And then somebody else comes by
[43:15] and goes tweaks you a little bit and all
[43:17] of a sudden now you can sing a different
[43:18] tune. If your soul is not tuned by the
[43:22] birth, the o your only the only way you
[43:25] can be tuned at that moment is
[43:26] essentially artificially by external
[43:28] forces in your spirit or your mind.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says if we live in the
[43:33] spirit, let us also walk in the spirit.
[43:34] If we are made alive by the spirit, then
[43:36] the word should resonate in our lives.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; If we live in the spirit, if the spirit
[43:43] is alive in you, then the word the
[43:46] spirit is going to resonate in you. And
[43:48] what is therefore pure in the soul
[43:51] resonates outside in the life that you
[43:54] live.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; The reason why you see some people's
[43:58] lives, they read like a soundwave
[44:02] up and down and in and out is because
[44:04] the soul is not tuned.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; The question of resonance
[44:13] has to do with what we have allowed to
[44:16] tune ourselves.
[44:18] Is your soul tuned by the new birth? If
[44:20] you say amen to that and you know it,
[44:22] then how's your spirit been tuned?
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Have you been allowing the spirit on the
[44:27] inside, the inside teacher to tune your
[44:29] mind, your thoughts, casting down
[44:31] imaginations?
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Have you been allowed, are you allowing
[44:35] that further fine-tuning and cleansing
[44:38] of your mind,
[44:40] the the purification of thought?
[44:43] Has that process h happening? If not,
[44:46] what's going to begin to happen then is
[44:47] your spirit gets out of tune, there's
[44:49] going to be some destructive
[44:50] interference with the frequencies in
[44:52] your soul.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; In 1 Thessalonians 1:es 2 to9, we give
[44:59] thanks to God always for you all, making
[45:01] mention of you in our prayers,
[45:02] remembering without ceasing your work of
[45:04] faith and labor of love and patience of
[45:06] hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the
[45:08] sight of God and our father.
[45:11] That was an email. That'd be quite a
[45:13] opening, right? Knowing brethren,
[45:15] beloved, your election of God. For our
[45:18] gospel came not unto you in word only,
[45:20] but also in power was not inanimate. It
[45:23] was not lifeless. It wasn't just
[45:25] hearing, but it came with you with
[45:27] vibrations, in frequency, in the Holy
[45:29] Ghost, and in much assurance as you know
[45:30] what men or men we were among you for
[45:32] your sake. And you became followers of
[45:34] us and of the Lord. So they were
[45:36] followers of Paul. They weren't ashamed
[45:37] to say that they followed Paul and the
[45:39] Lord, having received the word in much
[45:41] affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost.
[45:42] Notice these elements wherein they had
[45:44] received the word. The word sounded it
[45:47] came forth not just in word but there
[45:49] was frequencies and vibrations and they
[45:51] were tuned to it. They could receive the
[45:53] word so that you were in samples
[45:56] examples to all that believe in
[45:57] Macedonia and Akaya. For from you
[46:00] sounded out the word of the Lord not
[46:02] only in Macedonia and Aaya but also in
[46:05] every place your faith to God were to
[46:07] spread abroad so that we need not to
[46:09] speak anything.
[46:11] That word there sounded out. That's
[46:14] resonated,
[46:16] &gt;&gt; resounding.
[46:18] The word preached echoed back out of
[46:21] them.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; From you sounded out the word of God.
[46:26] The word struck something that that
[46:28] could receive the word, was tuned to the
[46:30] word, and they echo it back. From you
[46:33] resounded, from you resonated the word.
[46:36] For they themselves show us what manner
[46:37] of entering in we had unto you, and how
[46:40] ye turn tuned to God from idols to serve
[46:43] the living and true God.
[46:45] Resonance. We talk about resonance.
[46:48] It's a vibrating response to an outside
[46:50] sourc's wavelength frequency. It's this
[46:54] response to that vibration.
[46:58] What's our response? What do we tune to?
[47:02] What do we resonate with?
[47:06] have two closing scriptures. In
[47:08] Galatians chapter 2 verse 20, this theme
[47:11] in Galatians was just really speaking to
[47:12] me. He says, "I'm crucified with Christ.
[47:15] Nevertheless, I live." There's a
[47:17] paradox.
[47:19] Then the reason
[47:21] uh the fact that he writes it this way,
[47:24] I mean, why why didn't he just say, "I
[47:26] am crucified with Christ uh and I don't
[47:29] live."
[47:30] But he says, "I live." Yet not I. It's
[47:34] not the eye that lives,
[47:36] &gt;&gt; the eye of imagination,
[47:38] &gt;&gt; the eye of self,
[47:41] &gt;&gt; but Christ liveth in me,
[47:44] &gt;&gt; and the life which I now live in the
[47:47] flesh, I live by the faith of the son of
[47:50] God, who loved me and gave himself for
[47:52] me.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that this is necessarily
[47:55] the case with us here or any of you
[47:57] here, but there's some subtle nuances
[48:00] here that may go unnoticed.
[48:03] seems evident to us. I'm crucified with
[48:06] Christ and the life that I now live, if
[48:08] I'm living at all, the life I live now
[48:11] humanly in this life is a life that is
[48:14] lived by the faith of the son of God who
[48:16] loved me, gave himself for me.
[48:20] When Paul says, "I'm crucified with
[48:23] Christ
[48:25] and having died, it's now Christ who's
[48:27] alive in my soul." If we live in the
[48:29] spirit, let us walk in the spirit. If
[48:32] you walk in the spirit, you shall not
[48:34] fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; This
[48:40] expression now
[48:43] of I'm crucified with Christ and Christ
[48:46] lives in me. Then he that is living in
[48:50] me is now the life I live
[48:56] &gt;&gt; because it's by the faith of the son of
[48:57] God.
[49:00] Let me say it this way before let me say
[49:01] let me introduce this principle before I
[49:03] go further. An instrument a stringed
[49:06] instrument in particular can be tuned to
[49:08] itself.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; In other words, you could take you could
[49:13] take a a guitar that's been sitting
[49:15] acoustic guitar that's just been sitting
[49:17] in a in a hot garage or a humid
[49:19] environment. You could pick it up and go
[49:21] like, "Oh, that's awful." Well, you
[49:23] could tune it to itself,
[49:25] &gt;&gt; right? just if you know what order those
[49:28] strings should be tuned to. And so just
[49:31] by sound, you could tune it to where now
[49:33] when you play it, it doesn't sound so
[49:35] awful.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; So you could tune something to itself,
[49:39] but it's still out of tune.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; And you wouldn't notice until another
[49:45] instrument in tune plays.
[49:51] So, let me say this and and if you take
[49:53] notes, you I I would I'd say write it
[49:55] down and at least chew on this 40 times
[49:57] like my grandma used to tell me to do
[49:59] before I swallowed.
[50:03] We should not
[50:05] Well, I guess I I guess I realize I have
[50:07] it here. So, that's I didn't realize I
[50:09] put that on there.
[50:12] Your life should not be in your faith.
[50:16] I I I know this might seem a little bit
[50:19] like you guys are getting ready to
[50:20] leave. Hold on. Just be patient.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; You cannot stake your life on your faith
[50:26] in Christ.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; I'm all in on my faith. I believe. I
[50:31] believe. I'm all in on what I see. I'm
[50:33] all in on what I receive. I'm all in on
[50:35] it. This is what I believe. That is
[50:37] nothing more than self-tuning.
[50:41] that you can be all in on your faith in
[50:44] Jesus Christ and your faith represents
[50:45] your individual standard of what Christ
[50:47] is.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; You're tuned to your own standard.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; I'm all in on my faith in Jesus Christ.
[50:53] No, don't do that. That could be a house
[50:55] of cards.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; We must not stake everything on our
[51:00] faith in Christ, but rather we must put
[51:03] all of our self and our life in Jesus
[51:06] Christ himself.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; I don't want to live by my faith in
[51:11] Christ.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; I don't want to hang my hat on my faith.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; I I don't want to stake everything on my
[51:19] faith in the word of God, in the
[51:21] message, in the Bible, in in God. I want
[51:25] my life to be hid in Christ. I want to
[51:29] be abandoned to Jesus Christ. I I want
[51:31] to be stripped and laid bare of every
[51:33] pretense, every interpretation, every
[51:35] ideology, every adultery, every idol,
[51:38] everything. Strip me bare. I can only be
[51:42] safe if I've invested all that I am in
[51:45] my life is solely in Jesus Christ
[51:47] himself
[51:48] &gt;&gt; because he alone is the tuning standard.
[52:05] James 4:es 6 to10
[52:09] says, "But he giveth more grace."
[52:13] Well, how can I get grace? I need more
[52:15] grace. Remember, your imagination is a
[52:18] damn to grace. It's going to block it.
[52:22] It's going it's going to cause when it
[52:24] sees that it's going to be a filler.
[52:29] Imagination the is going to artificially
[52:32] fill what grace wants to organically and
[52:35] genuinely and real truly fill. So he
[52:37] says he resisteth the proud but giveth
[52:40] grace unto the humble.
[52:43] Submit yourselves therefore to God.
[52:45] Resist the devil
[52:47] and he shall flee from you.
[52:50] submitting yourself to God. There's your
[52:52] I am submitting myself not to my faith.
[52:56] I'm submitting to God.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to uh walk in the spirit.
[53:04] Submit myself. I if I have the spirit,
[53:06] I'm made alive in the spirit. Then I'm
[53:08] also going to walk in the spirit because
[53:09] if I walk in the spirit, I will not
[53:11] fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[53:17] So draw nigh to God and he'll draw nigh
[53:19] to you.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; There's this tuning
[53:22] tuning of hearts seeking his face.
[53:24] Cleanse your hands you sinners. Purify
[53:26] your hearts you double minded. This is
[53:27] even this inward purity. This inward
[53:29] tuning inward sanctification. Now this
[53:32] speaks to this repentance, this void,
[53:34] this feeling that none of us want to
[53:36] feel. Be afflicted and mourn and weep.
[53:38] Can you imagine this? I'm having the
[53:40] hardest time and my life's been turned
[53:42] upside down and so this there's this is
[53:46] happening and that's happening and it's
[53:47] just so dark and it's just so dark and
[53:48] someone says just laugh just laugh a
[53:51] little just look at it and giggle.
[53:55] Paul is saying be afflicted mourn and
[53:58] weep and let your laughter be turned to
[53:59] mourning and your joy joy to heaviness.
[54:02] Stop pretending. Stop imagining.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Stop giving hiding behind the eye.
[54:10] But humble yourself repentance.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Be afflicted, mourn, weep. Experience
[54:16] the heaviness.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Humble yourselves, he says, in the sight
[54:21] of the Lord and he shall lift you up.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; I know we look at that. Resist the devil
[54:26] and he'll flee. But kind of what's
[54:27] what's in the middle of all this is he
[54:29] says, "Well, I'm crucified with Christ
[54:30] and it's Christ that now lives in me.
[54:33] And that life is Christ made alive. It's
[54:37] his faith that lives in me. It's not I
[54:40] anymore."
[54:42] &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Submit your humble
[54:43] yourself in the sight of the Lord and he
[54:46] will lift you up." That's the dynamic by
[54:48] which Satan flees
[54:51] &gt;&gt; is not because you've all of a sudden
[54:52] just had this power to boom. Right.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Right. Like Street Fighter, you just
[54:58] figured out, right, and all a sudden the
[55:01] opponent just explodes. You're like,
[55:02] "Man, that was awesome. What just
[55:03] happened?"
[55:05] &gt;&gt; But it's the submission to God.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; It's the yielding to God that as you
[55:10] yield to him and the weaker you get, the
[55:12] more he lifts you up above the unpure
[55:15] minds, above the the the double-minded.
[55:18] Draw an eye to God and he will draw nigh
[55:20] unto you. This is a weapon.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:26] draw nigh, he draws nigh. This
[55:28] resonance, humble yourselves in the
[55:30] sight of the Lord. Be tuned.
[55:34] Let me say this resonance with God is
[55:36] more powerful
[55:38] than all your individual resisting of
[55:40] evil.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; All our intellectual resistance, all our
[55:43] emotional resistance. This is the danger
[55:45] of emotionalism, intellectualism, which
[55:47] is all imaginary faith. This is the
[55:49] danger of it is that's all in that realm
[55:52] of human lifting up the human part
[55:55] &gt;&gt; instead of just re resonating saying
[55:58] amen to and submitting and yielding to
[56:01] God.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; As you tune to God's word and as you get
[56:06] to that same frequency and there's
[56:08] constructive interference, it's an
[56:09] amplification of energy.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; This is how people are able to break
[56:13] glass with their voice.
[56:15] This is why there's certain How many
[56:17] have tried before to splash as much
[56:19] water out of the pool as we can,
[56:22] &gt;&gt; right, brother John? Right. Get in there
[56:24] and just try to get as much water out as
[56:25] you want. How what's the best way to do
[56:27] it? Everybody get in sync.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Right. When you go opposite, when you're
[56:31] going opposite, it it's not going to be
[56:33] as you're not going to get as much
[56:34] momentum, as much power.
[56:38] So when you resonate with God in his
[56:40] word, that's where the true power lies
[56:43] &gt;&gt; is in resonance.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; And we could just simply say, well,
[56:48] yeah, that doesn't resonate with me.
[56:50] That's fine. That's fine. But how are
[56:52] you tuned?
[56:55] &gt;&gt; What's tuned you?
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Are you tuned to the word of God?
[56:59] musicians as you could come to your
[57:01] places on your instruments.
[57:04] A lot of different things that we could
[57:05] continue on in this moment, but
[57:10] I want to close with this. In the book,
[57:13] Pursuit of God, the pursuit of God,
[57:15] Awtoer writes some really extraordinary
[57:18] things in that. And
[57:21] at this particular portion of the book,
[57:23] I think is it maybe around page 60 or
[57:25] something maybe just depending on which
[57:28] book you're reading, he's talking about
[57:30] this inward uh inwardly beholding God.
[57:35] But that's that's what we ought to do is
[57:37] this inward beholding God. Uh and then
[57:40] he begins to talk about this this
[57:42] outward manifestation of that that when
[57:43] you inwardly behold God, it's
[57:45] inescapable that there'd be some sort of
[57:47] outward purity. And as he's talking
[57:50] about reading your Bible and praying and
[57:53] fellowship and going to church and all
[57:55] these things that we might say are
[57:56] measurables
[57:58] where we just we can pull out the little
[58:00] chart and say, "Well, who's got a star
[58:01] next to their name uh this month for
[58:04] having a skirt to the ground? Anybody?"
[58:07] Right? It's it said there's this he says
[58:09] I'm not I'm not advocating for all this
[58:11] this external you may feel that I'm
[58:13] emphasizing it too much
[58:15] but he wants to he wants to make this
[58:17] point that how how is it that we would
[58:21] all be inwardly beholding God
[58:24] and how is it that we could all be
[58:26] really seeking Christ and looking at his
[58:30] face and reading the same Bible and
[58:32] praying to the same God. He's saying,
[58:33] "How is it that we would come out of
[58:35] that from inwardly beholding God and
[58:38] then have all this clash externally
[58:41] or this individuality and one does this
[58:43] and one does that?" And he says, "Has it
[58:46] ever occurred to you that 100 pianos all
[58:50] tuned to the same fork or automatically
[58:53] tuned to each other?"
[58:55] Did somebody use this recently? Anybody
[58:58] Does this not sound really familiar?
[59:00] Maybe I dreamed it, but it might have
[59:02] been brother Ellie Ezer who used it or
[59:04] some somebody I thought recently maybe
[59:06] have used used this example of how if
[59:08] something if everything's tuned to the
[59:10] same thing, then they're all they're
[59:11] tuned to each other.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; I don't have to I don't have have to ask
[59:15] brother Marvin uh give me a give me a
[59:17] sound and and start humming and then I'm
[59:19] just going to har I'm just going to find
[59:20] his pocket and I'm going to hum with
[59:22] him. It's not we're trying to feed off
[59:24] of one another and balance and level out
[59:27] and tune to each other. But all pianos,
[59:29] a 100 pianos, I think that would have
[59:30] made a great sermon title. 100 pianos,
[59:33] all tuned to the same tuning fork, are
[59:36] automatically tuned to each other. They
[59:39] are of one accord by being tuned not to
[59:42] each other, but to another standard to
[59:45] which each one must individually bow.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; This is the gospel.
[59:53] Jesus Christ is that standard that we
[59:57] must all individually bow to.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; So 100 worshippers meeting together,
[1:00:03] each one looking away to Christ are in
[1:00:06] heart, listen please, I'm almost done,
[1:00:10] in heart near to each other than they
[1:00:13] could possibly be were they to become
[1:00:16] unity conscious and turn their eyes away
[1:00:19] from God to strive for closer
[1:00:21] fellowship.
[1:00:23] If right now we abandoned the tuning
[1:00:26] standard, if right now we said, "You
[1:00:28] know what? Let's just let our minds go
[1:00:30] blank and let's just focus on harmony
[1:00:32] and unity this. Let's just let's just be
[1:00:34] one with each other and let's let's help
[1:00:36] each other and let's h uh whatever we
[1:00:39] might want to use. I I'm not even
[1:00:41] capable of that godly good. Maybe if I
[1:00:43] had red hair and a and could put in a
[1:00:45] ponytail, I could really riff in a funny
[1:00:47] way about uh you know the way some
[1:00:50] people think. But he's saying we could
[1:00:52] not possibly
[1:00:56] be closer to each other if we actually
[1:00:58] made unity a conscious effort
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; in strove for unity
[1:01:05] than if we all individually inwardly
[1:01:08] beheld God.
[1:01:10] We're tuned
[1:01:12] in our souls.
[1:01:15] He says social religion is perfected.
[1:01:18] I take it in the way that I believe he
[1:01:20] means it. But this outward practice of
[1:01:22] being a Christian, this external
[1:01:23] manifestation of good works and the
[1:01:25] fruits of the spirit. Social religion is
[1:01:27] perfected when private religion is
[1:01:29] purified.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; The purity that we strive for is inward
[1:01:35] purity.
[1:01:37] But we don't lie to ourselves and say
[1:01:39] that what is outwardly impure
[1:01:42] doesn't accurately reflect on what what
[1:01:44] is inwardly pure. The body becomes
[1:01:47] stronger as its members get healthier,
[1:01:49] become healthier. The whole church of
[1:01:51] God gains when the members that compose
[1:01:54] it begin to seek a better and a higher
[1:01:57] life.
[1:01:59] It's beautiful stuff.
[1:02:02] a hundred pianos tuned to the same
[1:02:03] tuning fork are automatically tuned to
[1:02:06] each other. If we could just get try to
[1:02:09] get out of our minds of who who we agree
[1:02:11] with in the message. Brother Joseph
[1:02:13] Brandom, I don't know if it was when it
[1:02:15] was, but he was announcing a communion
[1:02:16] service and in it he's writing about who
[1:02:18] are you going to believe? This pastor
[1:02:20] that says this, this preacher that says
[1:02:22] this, this one that says that, this one
[1:02:23] that says I'm reading this. I'm like I'm
[1:02:25] like, man, these are all really good
[1:02:26] questions.
[1:02:28] I don't need to try to tune myself to
[1:02:30] that pastor.
[1:02:32] I don't need to tune myself. I don't
[1:02:33] need to tune myself to this
[1:02:35] interpretation. I don't need to tune
[1:02:36] myself to that. I'm not trying to tune
[1:02:39] myself to what brother Joseph Brandham's
[1:02:40] trying to say. I don't even try to tune
[1:02:42] myself to brother Brandham. If I can
[1:02:44] just get tuned in with the Christ that
[1:02:46] he's tuned with, then I will
[1:02:48] automatically be tuned in with him
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; and anybody else for that matter that's
[1:02:53] willing to be tuned by Christ. Right?
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; If I'm trying to tune my faith to your
[1:03:00] faith, this is going to be some weird
[1:03:01] symphony.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; That's going to be a bohemian rap city.
[1:03:05] But listen, if we'll be willing to tune
[1:03:07] ourselves,
[1:03:09] tune ourselves individually, tune
[1:03:11] ourselves inwardly, seek a greater,
[1:03:14] better, higher life and strive to behold
[1:03:17] Christ the word and be willing to be
[1:03:19] tuned to his word.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Then I'll be automatically tuned.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; I'll be tuned. We'll be tuned to one
[1:03:27] another.
[1:03:28] May be a process.
[1:03:30] This is this dry heat here may may make
[1:03:33] it hard at times,
[1:03:36] but God's working on us, tuning us to
[1:03:39] resonate with his word. If we could
[1:03:41] stand together today, pray together.
[1:03:45] Resonance. There's more to get into.
[1:03:47] Lord willing, I'd like to address the
[1:03:49] idea of that sympathetic resonance. And
[1:03:53] when something vibrates at a certain
[1:03:54] frequency, if you're tuned to that, you
[1:03:56] will naturally, supernaturally, if it's
[1:03:59] the word, vibrate right back in the same
[1:04:02] frequency. Our gracious heavenly father,
[1:04:04] today, as we draw this service to a
[1:04:06] close,
[1:04:08] I solemnly submit.
[1:04:11] I just relent.
[1:04:15] And I leave this with you, Lord, to deal
[1:04:17] with the people's hearts as you see fit.
[1:04:19] But may there be a
[1:04:22] a
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:04:24] a resonating Lord. I even think of the
[1:04:26] principle that if things are if there's
[1:04:28] a common joining part that pendulums
[1:04:31] even in opposite timing will eventually
[1:04:34] stabilize
[1:04:36] and be in harmony. And Lord, if my swing
[1:04:39] is not swinging with your word, then
[1:04:42] Lord, I just pray that those vibrations
[1:04:44] continue to hold and bring me in
[1:04:48] resonance with you. this constructive
[1:04:50] interference.
[1:04:51] Lord, many times we read the Bible and
[1:04:53] we are looking into the word of God and
[1:04:56] we look into our hearts and there's
[1:04:57] things that aren't in time. They're not
[1:05:00] in sync. And so those we believe them to
[1:05:03] be the word of God. And when they don't
[1:05:06] align in a phase, instead of there being
[1:05:08] faith that's triggered, they actually
[1:05:10] cancel each other out.
[1:05:12] There's no benefit.
[1:05:15] And where there's the cancelling, where
[1:05:16] there's the void,
[1:05:18] our imagination fills in the silence.
[1:05:22] Lord, may we throw off these
[1:05:24] noiseancelling headphones of the world,
[1:05:27] be tuned to your voice,
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; and not be afraid to be tuned ourselves.
[1:05:34] We're so grateful that there is a
[1:05:37] powerful dynamic of your word that you
[1:05:39] are alive
[1:05:40] and that at the end of the day I must be
[1:05:42] willing to admit and to accept that
[1:05:45] within myself not even my own faith is
[1:05:47] good but that I'm willing to stake my
[1:05:51] life on you
[1:05:53] such that my this is not a house of
[1:05:56] cards. I'm on Christ, the solid rock,
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; and not I'm not staking everything on my
[1:06:02] faith in Christ, but I'm staking
[1:06:03] everything on Christ, the true standard,
[1:06:05] the way, the truth, the life. Bless us
[1:06:08] today. May we receive encouragement from
[1:06:09] this word. May we go through our lives
[1:06:11] and find those false tuning forks.
[1:06:14] Lord, look into our habits and our
[1:06:16] patterns of how we just find our spirits
[1:06:18] and our minds sometimes being more tuned
[1:06:20] to things of the world where we resonate
[1:06:22] with worldly things as opposed to your
[1:06:24] spirit.
[1:06:25] and those things which are pure. We love
[1:06:28] you Lord. We commit ourselves to you
[1:06:29] now. Praying that you bless the
[1:06:31] remainder of this service and our days
[1:06:33] together in the name Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:06:35] Amen.
[1:06:36] Amen.
