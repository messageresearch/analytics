TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is the 14th service I believe on the the kingdom and Heaven's mystery Earth's glory and looking at part three of seven women and one bride and there's a lot that we've already spoke on through the first couple parts out of Isaiah chapter four and I'd like to continue in that so if you could take your Bibles and turn to Isaiah chapter four I'd like to read verses one and two so that we can get a little bit of context to this it says in Isaiah chapter 4 verse 1 and in that day seven women shall take a hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach and so this is one view of seven women in that day but then it says kind of changing the picture in that they shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel and the next verse is talking about he that is left in Zion and there is going to be uh this is a specific uh kind of comparison in verse 1 and verse two seven women and I'm calling this branch of the Lord and those identified with it and those that are escaped of Israel as brother Branham identifies it even says Zion that this is representative and in type we see the figure of the bribes that's the seven women in one bride brother Branham and the sermon the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride he said there is one bride not a dozen denominations but one bride and and to me this language is just so beautiful one bride that's the elected out of the earth so this is to me it has that image of what God created the Earth for and the Very purpose why he created it to get a bride out of it there was one bride that's elective out of the earth that's been predestinated to this that the ones who can recognize their place in the Kingdom that just takes the whole thought and puts it together the kingdom of Heaven's mystery Earth's Glory that there's a bride that's elected out of the earth and you're the ones that are predestinated to recognize your place in the Kingdom that's that's given to you now I I trust that some of you have been reading maybe studying the sermon the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride and there's a lot of things in it that are a lot of details and a lot of putting together of scriptures and bringing out a lot of different principles and he makes the statement uh later on in the sermon he says this is a deep Revelation from God and when he when he says that there might be some things we're thinking oh well this is the Deep revelation of God and this is the Deep revelation of God and I would say that even in articulating it even if he says this is a deep revelation of God and he just gives the scriptures of how many cubits the city would be uh just reading it and knowing the math isn't the Revelation there's something to be quick and there's something that's in it but when he refers to the Deep revelation of God I think we should kind of press in a little bit and say well Lord I want the Deep Revelation just don't want the veneer I just don't want the surface I don't even want to just conclude things as the Deep Revelation that had already been understood and charted and figured out just by reading the scripture I want the revelation of it and as it refers to this deep revelation of God he then begins to refer to the city and the dimensions of it and how the span that it would be and what it would cover even relating it to how that would Set uh in the United States and he talks talks about a pyramid-like mountain uh that's going to push up from the earth and he's talking about there's going to be a bride that's elected out of the earth and so there's something that's going to be emerging and so you see there's something coming but then there's something that is and he begins to talk about a king it makes this statement very near this part where he says a deep Revelation from God I'm kind of just putting this out there so that I know that it's been uh mentioned if we can't quite dive into it much today I want this in kind of our fabric as we go through this series it says in this pyramid with seven steps then the king's chamber so this in that seventh step it's not the king chamber but then the king's chamber he says we're in the seventh Church age before the king takes his throne he's looking at this moment in time this place where we are and then this this other chamber uh beyond that seventh step he says remember the pyramid never had a did have a Capstone on it and that that brings into our mind a lot of things about the Capstone and the the Capstone that's revealed and uh even in Christ the mystery God revealed how that headstone of that Capstone speaks of a kingdom and he brings things into one view it kind of gets our attention a deep Revelation from God he starts talking about the pyramid the city this mountain pushing up out of the earth and then he takes this pyramid and he says well there's seven steps and then there's you go into this king's chamber and he's relating this in the pyramid and the pyramids never had a Capstone so the things that he brings into view are the seven Church ages the Capstone Christ is King and his bride if you go and read this particular portion he's taking all these different elements and kind of piecing them in there and he comes to shortly after this he reads Isaiah chapter four he reads the entire chapter and you can see from those verses three to six how it it fills in and it relates to and you can see this burning and this purging and this creating of this this atmosphere for the Millennium even as it would lead into uh that perfect day where everything is destroyed and everything is purged and everything is cleansed and as he reads Isaiah chapter 4 verse 1 he said that's the end time where we're living now so this is he says marriage and divorce and what more prostitution he said there's a there's the seven women taking hold of wanting to take a hold of one man still wanting to eat their own food and dress themselves but they want the pretense of uh legitimacy they want to be able to say oh these seven these these daughters we have well they're they're from him we have a husband a true husband and so there's different Boston claims that these women make and he's saying that's the end time that we're living in now and then he when he reads in Isaiah 4 he says the daughter of Zion he says that's always the bride so there's there's a type in Zion you can see a type of the Bride enzyme there's things that very literally and specifically would apply to Israel or Zion that there's things spiritually and even literally that apply in full uh fulfillment and perfect fulfillment in the bride so he's bringing something into our view as he takes these scriptures as we said before his brother says that's the end time these seven women I'm using as kind of a type and just a way to refer to them and hopefully in the next couple Services we can get into more of the background of when the Bible says in that day what it's referring to and the image that's being represented the influence it has on the people but these seven women are the product of Satan's deception he's designed them he's manipulated them he's caused them to think a certain way and desire a certain way but the bride there's one bride and this one bride is one with Christ she is a bride and not just in anticipation of being married but a bride is called a bride in the day that she's wed even the term bridegroom it means a man who's about to be married and so there's something in that designation of Bride and bridegroom that brings us to a union not being engaged but to a union and this these seven women and this one bride as we're just using those phrases uh these are two they're animated by two different lives there they have that's two different Natures two different characters and you can see in the one the very image of a laodicean woman but the other is she is the bride of Christ and the the subject that I'm wanting to lead into and as we're as we're looking at this this contrast between these two and if you look at the contrast between two Edens in Two Cities but there there's there's in the bride there's Kingdom power and Kingdom character that's being manifested that in in the bride and you as individuals members of it you are manifesting the glory of Heaven the mystery of Christ it is ordained that it would be revealed through you and lest we think for at any moment that that means that we could sit down at a coffee table and chart out the seals together with the church ages and and show what the revelations 10 1 was and and try to figure out all the types and all the figures now it's about living the life and that nature of Christ being expressed through you that that's what it means for the kingdom to be expressed now that is a foundation if you could look at Revelations chapter 19. verses 11 and 12. and I want to use as we've we've kind of shown the contrast and how the devil impersonates and the devil's lie versus the the truth of God and how he's always a mimic he's always an impersonation and I had originally prepared to start with Revelations chapter six and come back to Isaiah 4 and kind of look at the seven women first I I wanted to kind of break that pattern a little bit and just take some time this morning in looking at the brides because by seeing the bride we can see this contrast uh to these seven women so it says in Revelations 19 verses 11 and 12 and I would I I do appreciate just how intentive you are this morning and very very focused I need that I need that help and you're doing a tremendous job already he says I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse so he taken our minds a white horse this gives us this image in this figure and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true now we have one riding on a white horse and he is called he that sat upon Him is called faithful and true and in righteousness he the judge and make war so this is kind of characterizing him in this moment and in this time now these different designations here his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself now this is if I could put it this way this is after the Rapture leading into the Millennium this is then it was a catch the timing here it's after the Rapture it's leading into the millennial Millennial Reign and as we read already it tells us of his characterization as the one who is writing it says this this is Christ the King of Kings is how he's declared the Lord of lords and these are three things I want to look at his eyes is flaming fire crowns on his head and a name written hopefully today we can look enough at the crowns on his head to see something there and then hold off some about the name but there's a deep truth that's represented in each one of these descriptions of Christ uh they're they're presented symbolically now if there is a very literal ex literal expression of Christ riding on a white horse and he's literally presented in this way and is and writing out this way as he comes to his Millennial Reign then that's wonderful then we can realize that even in the literal fulfillment their symbolism in it that we can catch and gather from it and so there's deep truths that are being represented in this description of Christ does he death judge and make war is Isis flame as fires crowns are upon his head and he had a name written and I I want you to see Christ I want you to see things about Christ and and it's wonderful to see him but I believe that his desire in revealing himself is to show you who you are it's not just all self-centered on him like look at me how great I am how awesome I am but by peering into his heart he's hoping that you learn something about yourself but your true nature and who you truly are so there's things to see about Christ but then there's things to see about us and there's several things that I'll be using in the scripture today that I want to say now that we're looking at in type and I hope that that at the Bedrock you see the truth of it and we're not just trying to pull out uh the symbols and the types and make them the truths themselves but these things that we're looking at in types speak to a truth about Christ and about his bride now if we just look at his eyes were as a flame of fire I'm just doing this very quickly just to show that the message brings out things about this in Revelations 1 14 it's describing Christ in the same way and we're taught in the message that this is Christ we know from Revelations 1 this is Christ The Living Word and this is him these eyes of the flame of fire and this this representation of him this is the Supreme judge this is him in a dispensation of judgment now we know that he's always uh he always has the power to judge and it's been committed to him but the time of judging is a specific dispensation and so here is as eyes of flame of fire is speaking to a characteristic of Christ and then it says and I may be taking this a little bit out of order but this is just to kind of help me this morning it says that he had a name written that no man knew but he himself it says that his name is called the word of God now I'm not trying to get kind of caught up on the semantics and I'm not saying that they're necessarily different just wanting you to recognize that it his name is called the word of God and it says he had a name written that no man knew but he himself I want you to think about that we know his name is called the word of God and and in the prayer verse though it says he has a name written that no man knew but he himself this phrase as I want you just to think about it a little bit as let me just just read it and in verse 13. it says and he was clawed with the vesture dipped in Blood and I because I don't think I'm going to get to get to this this morning and his name is called the word of God so we the Bible's already telling us his name is called the word of God and and I just want you to think of this this breaking it out there's a name on him that's written that no man knows but he himself and his name is called the word of God I'm not saying they're two different things but they're presented two different ways but we're told his name is called the word of God and this one uh characteristic that's given about this name is no man knew and in the New Testament it's translated to see or Saul perceive even one place cannot tell so if no man knew man was not able to perceive it he could not see it he could not know it and it's one that he knew himself but no other man could tell no other man could see or know this name and it's in that to me that I begin to recognize that the bride is represented in this image of Christ because there's a name written and it's a name that man cannot perceive cannot no cannot tell and therefore when we think about the bride she is Untouched by man she is not known or she is not made or discovered by men no man says oh this is the brighter this is and can conjure her up and brother Branham says in spoken word is the Original Seed the true bride like Mary and I'm glad that we could read this from the message because I know that it's uh it's mature language he says the true bride like Mary will have a virgin womb for the Bride of the word which is Christ when Christ the word comes to the bride she will be the same as he is I think all the the he him stuff is just Satan get tripped getting tripped up on she is him since she will be the same as he is a Virgin by the word oh God I hope it's going over brother Neville brother Neville is it going over he says I hope you understand what was he the word word the word of God and now notice where he goes upon his vesture he had a name written the word of God now he's combined verses 12 and 13. on his master he had a name written the word of God so autonomy has a name written and his name is called the word of God and he brings Revelations 19 in there when he's talking about the bride word and he judges to John 1 in the beginning was the word of the word was with God and the Word was God verse 12 in the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he says he is God and God is the word and when his bride comes she'll be the same product that he is so Christ his name is called he is called the word of God and now he says the bride which she comes she's going to be the same product she is the word of God in the sermon God of this evil age and bringing a lot of out of this sermon he's talking about how contrary denominations are to God's will to God's word and I think that's a very statement he makes just before we read this how contrary is denomination to God's word he says show me where God ever blessed the church after it was organized remember the the mark of the beast the Antichrist and the Beast it's not just only the Roman Catholic church but it's organized religion it says show me where uh God blessed a church after it was organized she went on the shelf and died with intellectual wisdom from the Devil by their leaders and refused now that's a mouthful refuse the word of God as it grew up into the perfect statue of Christ now think of where he's rejected and where he's put out now it's at the head now we're at the Capstone we're at the crowning he says how contrary and then he says separate from that unbelieving Eve you children of the evening light separate from that unbelieving Eve you children of the evening light Satan God of this age by his knowledge getting the people to eat from his mixed tree of Good and Evil notice Satan by his knowledge causing the people this evil age to eat from his tree of Good and Evil there's that mixture again there's those worldly kingdoms he says that he is building a greater Christian Civilization by his knowledge of Good and Evil a greater Christian civilization but Christ little virgin word flock bride don't care for his knowledge she keeps free from of him now let's talk about her a minute she waits for her Lord and his Millennial honeymoon right with the word groom as she is the word bride now recognize how there is a people who separate from the unbelieving eve and that they won't be mixed with it she keeps free from him and he's using this language of a virgin word flock bride and in the marriage and divorce he says and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word unadulterated not touched by any man's organization any man-made Theory she'll be purely unadulterated Bride of the word now when there's a name written that no man knew then this this name represents something that man hasn't man handled something that man couldn't get to they could pervert something off of it and they could make something look like it but God is going to preserve for himself one that is not touched by man one that cannot be manhandled one that has not been defiled and and she will be this is the bride the word I recognize that his name is called the word of God and now you are the word of God and we know the bride takes on the bridegroom's name Batman makes the statement the bride was the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ so the bride is the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ so what I'm wanting to express is how that the bride of Christ when Christ is symbolized and Christ is represented the bride is riding with him and is represented in these symbols Christ has a name written and it is said that no man knew so there's something we could say well there's a hidden Mystery to this name there's a knowledge that's not commonly known that there's something that's hidden and therefore it's connected then with revelation that if no man knows it then the only way that you could know it is if the son would reveal it to you now let's look at this name names that are written in other places in scripture and again I'm just wanting you to see how the bride is represented in this name that's written his name is called the word of God in this name that's written that no man knows and brother Branham takes these scriptures in Revelations 19 and in God of this evil age he's showing us at the end time there's this separating out of this one true bride from the rest of Satan's mixing and denominationalism and organization in Isaiah 49 verse 16 he says behold I have Graven these talking about Zion here I have Graven thee I've inscribed I've written I've Graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me remember in Revelations 21 how much the wall the foundation of the wall and the wall is mentioned over and over and over again and here and talking about the bride or Zion we can see the bride he said you're written in my hands and in the engraving in the hand it's to signify not just power and personal ownership but it's the eternal security you're Graven I'm not just holding feathers I'm not just holding a collection of names I'm I'm not I just don't have a record uh well some make it some don't but I have those that are permanent that eternally secure and he says I've they're written in the palm of my hands and then in John chapter 10 verses 27 28-29 Jesus says my sheep hear my voice so that's a designation my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me so this is a specific class of people that are only known by God and you say well it's not just know their name and know they exist and know who they are know of thee kind of the the the mystical entity but rather he knows specifically who they are that and it's a personal absolute knowledge and no man knows that he says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life that they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand so we have an image of names Graven in the palm of a hand and he says my sheep know my voice and I know them and no man can remove them he says my Father which gave them me is greater than all and he repeats it and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand now there's some Unity there there's some Union that there is a Graven in the hand and cannot be plucked out of the father's hand and I think plucking I obviously maybe it's obvious to you what it means and it means to carry off by force or to pull that and it carries this meaning that if something is plucked you you claim it for yourself when if you're gonna Harvest fruit if you pick it you pluck it off the vine and you take something you're taking ownership of it you're claiming it for yourself so he says I have these names I have these people these sheep that are given to me and no man can claim them for himself no man can pull them away even by force no attraction no draw no signs and wonders no powers no move of the Antichrist is able to claim them take ownership of them to defile them and it's in this selection and in this position in his hand that Jesus gives the disciples the comfort in Luke 10 20 notwithstanding in this Rejoice not don't Rejoice that demons are subject to you and that you can use his name to cast out devils and raise people from the dead and do many wonderful Works he says and he says that the spirits are subject unto you that's not what we rejoice in alone but rather Rejoice this is the ultimate because your names are written in heaven and we have in this image together with Christ that there's one who has a name written that no man knew but he himself and his name is called the word of God and your name is written in heaven your your names are Graven in his hands you are represented represented as being in his hand this is even in the image of Christ we see ourselves in Christ writing on the White Horse it says on his head and I'll come back to those names here later maybe in the next service he says on his head that's the image one head on his head are many crowns but only one name written and these symbols are being connected together on his head are many crowns and on his name on him only and only one name written there's only one head Christ there's only one New Jerusalem there's only one mountain so you have Christ with one head and many crowns you have one one mountain that that is this New Jerusalem and if again if I could say this in these images of Christ the bride is always there even if you don't see her she's hidden in him she's unseen she's represented with him and in Revelations chapter 5 verse 6 says and behold and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders this is the time when the seven sealed book is being opened this is the one that was found worthy to step forward and take the book stood a lamb as it had been slain so there's there's the we even see this Blood in this picture is the same as you would see it is garment being stained with blood in Revelations 19 having seven horns and seven eyes in the Bible tells us what these are representing these seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth takes the scripture and I think it's uh he's preaching the Revelation series he says what is it the Bride In Christ so he says it it's Christ and his bride is what he says what is it Christ and his bride so she's represented even in this image in Revelations 5 is this lamb that had been slain in this image having seven horns and seven eyes and brother Ram shows us how the seven horns represent seven Church ages and he says it means a kingdom so there's a kingdom that's being built up there's a kingdom that's being expressed in this image of Christ and he says that the the seven eyes the Bible says the seven spirits of God into all the Earth that these are messengers to the church this is this this is maybe not to deep rich symbolism of these scriptures but this is what these symbols are representing and we know that according to the message of God that only the elect hear the message only that truly hear the message the true church hears the message but the false church WIll oppose the message to each age even if they claim to believe it they don't humble themselves to it so as we touched on Wednesday night part of the message is to the church that rejects him judgment it's The Binding of the tares he speaks and it's judgment we have to be careful that as he speaks judgment and calls them the church and judge it comes upon them that we don't say take that to mean it's upon the bride but he's a messenger they claim to be the church so he speaks the message of binding and judgment to the church that rejects him but there's also a word only to the elect that nobody else can claim he speaks a word only to the elect now again just keep in mind this image of Christ the lamb with these seven horns and then these seven eyes and this is all represented as one this one lamb and there's a bride that's represented here this Kingdom that's represented in this lamb or with this lamb now there's a lot that we could read from the force Hill but I want to read this the Antichrist refuses the true bride Doctrine and therefore he takes his own right now and builds her up under a Creed of his own takes his own bride and makes her denomination she gives birth to other denominations as quoted in this Holy Scripture gives birth to daughters and she becomes just like her mother natural worldly denominational opposing the spiritual bride the word this is this is portrayed even in Revelations 19 as there's Christ is coming to judge and make war it's coming against those that would oppose anything that would be against and there's this there's this binding and there's this tearing down and there's this destroying that's signified in war in this judging and this Rod of iron but brother Branham takes the Antichrist and he says that he takes his own bride and through her gives birth to denominations called daughters or the mother of harlots and she's natural worldly denominational and it opposes the spiritual bride of the word I know this is just more of the same to what's already been said just using other statements now if I could take you and I know that it's not I haven't reached a conclusion I'm just bringing things into into view here so you have Christ riding on a white horse and he has on his head many crowns his eyes his flame as fire and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself this sets forth Christ right in a White Horse different symbols are represented in him and this is Christ and you're represented with him now there's a false bride and there's an antichrist Spirit who wants to achieve a bride so in Revelation chapter 6 verse 2 we're making good time I don't know if I'm going too fast but we're making really good time today he says in Revelations chapter 6 verse 2 and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and again what's brought out is there's no arrows and the crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer notice there's no name given at this point it doesn't have a name written on him there's no name given we recognize this to be the Antichrist spirit and there was a time when many believe this to be the end Jesus Christ and now I believe it's most widely accepted that this is the Antichrist and this is the position that we see in the word of God is that this would be the Antichrist Spirit riding out so it's up the spirit and brother Branham in now as you see that image of one riding on a white horse and he has a crown and he's he's riding up to conquer he has a bow so there's something in it that a lot of people read says oh this is Christ this is Christ This Is The Mighty conqueror right in a White Horse and we're going to see him again in Revelations 19. but this is The False Image and what's remarkable is how in Revelation 6 he's riding on a white horse and we don't see Christ right until Revelations 19. and I know it's not perfect in chronology but in the way that this unfolds we see here in Revelation 6 this White Horse seemingly going out first with a with a beast to meet him and it's not Christ on a white horse it's Satan portraying himself first as one riding on a white horse and in the sermon the unity of one God and the one Church he's talking about Islam and he says in Muhammad he says you ever think why the White Horse because they believe that Muhammad is going to come riding on a white horse and those that stand guard and how they keep their religion he said did you know the scripture says that Jesus shall come riding on a white horse and his Vester dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God it's the Lord Jesus shall come riding into Heavens with the armies behind him riding on a white horse can you see that perverted religion turned around and make it Muhammad on a white horse this is the perversion in religion but Jesus is coming in the heavens and Muhammad is Earthly here's a here's a religion that takes some symbolism and takes some idea and has co-opted it and taken it and it's being represented in their Theology and their belief system he says that's just perverting the truth and if you recall when Babylonian religion began in the very beginning with Nimrod his religion spread out through all the Earth so that you see the same symbols in every religion around the earth even if they couldn't be connected together in time or close in proximity because it's the Satan's perverted religion it's that mimic weed that twin and he says Muhammad is Earthly so Satan works with the earthy Earth things while God works with the heavens I love that how he said God works with the heavens Satan only has Earthly things to work with and did you ever think of the Tower of Babylon and compare it with Jacob's Ladder this one had me really I was like yes yes how that they were trying to build stair steps to around the tower that would reach into heaven only trying to pervert Jacob's Ladder which reached from Heavens to the Earth and Angels descending and ascending perverting it are you thinking what I'm thinking I'm not talking about taking over the world but I but in the fact that there's a Jacob's Ladder and we're associated with Jacob who comes much later but yet the Tower of Babel is a perversion of Jacob's Ladder so you've got to you recognize what Satan is able to see inside get over it some of you you got to recognize there's some things that Abe that Satan is able to see and mimic that are only known in the spiritual Realm things that he has some familiarity with an image in heaven the way the heavens would be laid out the way that things would be spread out the way the order and hierarchy way God expresses himself in Satan is trying to be the one to get his story out first and now the Tower of Babel is used to represent something that's Heavenly and spiritual that Jacob sees as a ladder and Angels descending up and down in Satan tries to build it in an Earthly image in the Tower of Babylon that's because Satan works with Earth things and God works in things that are unseen to bring them seen Satan has to work with the he's working tangibly then we see that Satan has a white horse he has a crown and a bride brother bam says the denominational bride here he has a white horse the one that's riding upon Him is this Antichrist spirit with the bow a crown is given to him and he went forth conquering and to conquer and this is a perversion of Truth in Revelations chapter 17 verse 5 if you could take this as a difference now because we read in Revelations 19 Christ is riding a white horse he's called faithful and true in righteousness he judges and makes War eyes a flame of fire on his head were many crowns and he had a name written now this the crowning the crown is upon his head the crowns are upon his head and it says in a name written that no man knew himself it brings those symbols very near to each other in Revelations chapter 17 verse 5 and upon her forehead was a name written I recognize where this is written it's written on her forehead and to name it in the first name is Mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth and so it's broke out mystery and I would say mystery Babylon and we combine them together but the way that it was broken out in this translation is Mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the Earth this woman is not presented in this picture as having a crown but a name written on her forehead and as we read about her we know that this woman has crowned herself in Revelations 18 she's glorified herself she said herself as a queen and in the way that she's portrayed herself in verse 7 of Revelation 17. kind of catches John in awe and he said unto me what wherefore did thou did US thou Marvel I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman and the Beast that carried her the Beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and ten horns I just recognize how closely the numbers are matching and and all these representations because we have a lamb that has seven horns and seven eyes and now we have a this woman who has a name a mystery written on her forehead and this Beast that she's riding on that's carrying her has seven heads and ten horns and another numerically they're different and expressions are different but there's these similarities that are that are coming together and she was a Marvel and if I could say she was beautiful powerful charismatic and she's crowned with a name on her forehead this is this is a nomination this is some crowning upon her name I I I I I get the feeling that we're very near whatever this means we're very near closing making really good time today so maybe you might think why didn't he do this when it was 118 a couple Sundays ago now as the Bible tells us upon her forehead was the name written is just describing as verses 7 chapter 17 chapter 18. the word tells us the truth behind the mystery tells us the truth behind the crown it's telling us the Sinister nature of the heads and the horns and these things and so as the Bible is writing it it tells us even symbolically it exposes the hidden Mystery behind this woman why are you marveling when we read it or we read it as if the cover is already being pulled off so we need to kind of back up and recognize that before this happens she presents herself according to Matthew 20 24 24 24 24 she expresses herself in a very deceiving way and the Bible's using symbolic language say we're exposing her she's being exposed her power's being uncovered what she is is being made known and it's exposing symbolically in Revelation 17 and 18. the Mystery behind this woman and the Bible shows us the true character and Power of the of what's written on her forehead here's this woman and lest we would Marvel at her beauty and how she's dressed and how she's arrayed and all the elements that make her up and pearls and gold and and Lenin and robes and purple and all the ways that she's fashioned and if that had only been the image that would be expressed why we would have a really good time trying to pull it apart but John as he sees the symbol the angel catches him marveling at her and being in awe and he's saying you need to see what's really behind all this mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the Earth the Bible is showing us the character and power behind the name the false part the wicked part and God of this evil age brother bam says she is the devil's bride wrapped in his religious sin loving knowledge of this present evil age to deceive you I mean if she just would only keep the name tag on it would make it so much easier for us right if she would just have the name tag mystery Babylon the great mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth and say well well you know there's no such thing as the bride age don't you go what's that on your oh sure buddy right you should she she's if she just would wear the name tag but she presents herself as the church he presents herself in this in a certain way where she's religious but it's sin loving knowledge of this present age to deceive you he says oh my a whole click or denomination of seducing spirits you don't have to be a denomination all you have to do is be a click you don't need to have the Appalachian nomination of the Blasphemous names and be called by a particular name just become a clique with seducing Spirits by scientific knowledge and a modern civilization this is what is raised up in this hour this is what's portrayed and allele to see in age this is what these seven women are all taken a hold of taking a Hold by and then he continues and Satan will soon same sermon Satan will soon take and I was reading these statements to catch this part I feel like I need to kind of review this for a second they have the image of Christ riding on a white horse and Benny crowns are on his head and a name written that no man knew but he himself and his name is called the word of God now Satan has his own image the bride's rep even as we continue reading Revelations 19 that there's the ones riding with him on white horses so there's there's an image of the pure of the truth faithful and true those riding out with him now Satan has his white horse and he now by deception achieves his bride and if we could catch this image God already had you ordained beforehand Satan rides out conking into conquer to make it up as he goes collecting his subject as he goes God's already ordained it beforehand uh the Satan takes the crown presumptuously with the intent to deceive and he does it he accomplishes his agenda and he's crowned even at that outset wearing a crown given a crown now as Christ has many crowns on his head I want you to recognize the source of the crown of the Antichrist brother man says Satan will soon take his intellectual bride and exalt this great one which is the Antichrist the hierarchies and set him upon a throne and the whole world will wander after him what's being portrayed is that this Fallen church this this Fallen woman is crowning the Antichrist setting him upon a throne exalting him lifting him up this is in the the symbolism this is in the the the way that it's represented symbolically and the false Christ and false prophets at the end time are going to enthrone him they're going to coronate him as the Antichrist spirit is going to be a brother that says incarnate in the people this is the crowning of that Ministry this is the exaltation of that Ministry that they are going to exalt the intellectual bride and the false World system is going to bring it to a throne and bring it to a crowning Revelations 13 1 he says I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea and that's the that catch this the CSP are we as represent his people the Antichrist is crowned he's rising up crowned by the people he's coming up out of the sea giving Power by the Sea rising out there's maybe some more symbolism we'll use in the next service I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns this is the same we see the same saying that this Beast that carried this Mystery Woman uh this woman of mystery this Babylon the great this Beast has seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns in upon his heads the name of blasphemy recognize again how the crowns are together with names and it speaks of character speaks of power the seven heads we recognize are seven mountains just reading it in the scripture whereas there is one head and one mountain now you have seven heads and they represent Seven Mountains Seven Hills this Beast rising up out of the sea we're just looking at verse one because I know as we read more there's types and symbols of the United States and there's other things it's it's trying to present itself one way but speaks another way you see the images of papal secession and those things and I'm not wanting to get caught up in all those details I think there's just a lot of a lot of information out there on it but he stands upon the sea he sees a beast rise up out of the sea seven heads ten horns the horns have crowns and the heads have names these are Blasphemous names names of blasphemy names of organization names that are given that relate to men names that relate to the things of it names that men knew names that men give names after men these are the names that are given these names that are represented in this in this Beast that this woman is riding on and I want you to recognize how that the names are coming together with the crown and upon his heads were names upon the horns or crowns on Christ's head are many crowns and a name written and it's this Antichrist I think maybe as I realize now the scriptures I have in front of me I'm wanting to see that there's a crowning of the Antichrist by the people that they're the ones that are even at nicaea it was voted upon they made the decision they gave the they gave it over to they made they officiated the marriage they brought it together and he's finding his power in the people finding this they're they're lifting them up they're exalting him they're bringing raising him to this place and in the anointed ones at the end time 's talking about Saint Martin of Tours and there's I was going back and reading in the other histories and other remarkings of the story of Saint Martin and how he cleared cut the Garment in one place and these different Supernatural stories of him that are documented throughout history and I found it remarkable how that many sources quote Martin's Story one way and brother Branham is telling the same story the same way but he in one place he he brings out a greater truth about it and this is he says I want to show you how deceiving the devil is and he's talking about Satan Martin of Tours one day he Saint Martin was setting in a study up come a mighty Angel crown on his head golden shoes on lace around his garments of gold and said Martin do you know me and and remember it wasn't Martin do you know me right it was Martin do you know me and he says he said I'm your lord and savior I'm the one that saved you worship me Martin but that Prophet knowing there's a little something strange here kept looking at him he said Martin I'm your savior Jesus Christ worship me don't you know me Martin remember I'm telling the story to recognize how deceiving Satan is and how he has these these clicks of seducing spirits and he said and Martin kept looking at him the scripture running through his mind he said Satan get away from me you got a crown on your head this is the part where brother Brown emphasizes this a little bit differently he says and the word of God says his Saints will crown him at the End of the Age there's that's the reason why I read that is to see how that there's symbolically there's this representation how that Christ isn't snatching his crown it's not Christ crowning himself necessarily but there is a the saints that are crowning him he says at the End of the Age that there's a time where it's being made up it's being built up the jewels are being made up and the elements to the crown are being made up and so it takes this process of time for the crowning to be complete and for it to take shape through seven Church ages Satan's representative Revelation 6 2 the very beginning riding out on a white horse he's already got his crown because he's going to use power to deceive to make up the jewels of his crown so he presupposes himself as king to give the authority and the inference of authority to bind people under him but Christ is willing to remain the lamb until the crown is made up and then have the people his own bride crown him and then he says wouldn't that have been Pentecostal bait really that whole that the way that it can appear the way that it could show itself he says wouldn't have that been Pentecostal babe he says watch that word brother that's where it pays that Pentecost obey is saying the thing that kind of catches the Pentecostal mindset draws them offside they would have snapped a hold of that real quick worshiped it praised it rejoiced in it those fabricated signs and those different things that get people worked up he says that would have been Pentecostal bait but watch the word there's where it pays and Christ said that there as Martin is been kind of challenged by this image of this angel and he recognizes the crown at this dispensation this time he sees the crown and brother Branham puts this in the heart of Saint Martin he kind of brings this this is the the response of Saint Martin of tourists that Crown is untimely because Christ is going to be crowned by his Saints Christ crowning has to do with him making up his jewels Christ crowding has something to do with the finishing up of his body he can't be crowned prematurely this crowning that has to take place he says what happened at the end of his age and the Saints will crown him so recognize that image and on his head were many crowns brother Branham says in the second seal he's been crowned by his Saints this is a different coronation Satan has taken his crown or his authority presumptuously he's posturing he's he's using Force he's using intimidation he's trying to show you uh he's the one that's thinking to take over the world he's the one that's wanting to ride out and Conquer but Christ's crowning is the true coronation this crowning as the name written in the forehead of This Woman This mystery of the woman this name written had a mystery and it spoke of her power and her character that's diabolic and it's from below this crowning of Christ and this name written it represents his character and his power I know we went over this in on rewards in Revelations 4 4. this is the scene that's being set before the lamb in the time that he's described called the line of the tribe of Judah the crowning of the Lamb it's that time of this crowning it's this time of this coronation and the round about The Throne we're four in 20 seats and upon the seats I saw Four and Twenty Elders sitting clothed in white Raymond and they had on their heads crowns of gold it's a Golden Crown brother Brian said the gold of God is christ-like character remember your character is the only thing you take with you these Elders have crowns of gold it's a reflection of christ-like character that's what they took with and they took their character with them this is their testimonies they sit there round about The Throne they had on their heads crowns of gold and then in verse 10 the four and 24 Elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever recognize how that Beast system has how it tries to perpetuate and live forever and ever but this is one who doesn't die and rise again or die and rise again and die and rise again he's the one that was dead rose again and lives forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne now this is this crown that represented symbolically they're casting their crowns to him to this to this one they're casting their crowd saying Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and Power for thou Hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created this taking of a crown and this acknowledgment of the four and 24 Elders as they have these crowns and I'm just using it in type of this gold this gold of God which is christ-like character a crown of gold is some crown on these men's lives and their testimonies and in this moment they recognize I can't I can't claim this as my own not to you alone is there glory honor and power that this this I have not earned of my own this I have not made of my own this is not this character is not my own character this testimony is not my own testimony but I take my crown and I'm casting it to you and I'm giving my crown and may we see that in the scriptural image in brother Brown in a couple places says he's been done crowned by his Saints that there's a crowning that we give Christ there's a crowning that takes place in Isaiah chapter 62 we'll read verses one to three and not to verse 12. he says for Zion's sake will I not hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth his brightness and the Salvation thereof is a lamp that burneth there's his intent even through the church ages and it says in the Gentiles shall see thy brightness and all Kings thy Glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name out of his mouth which proceedeth as a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name and now verse 3 Thou shalt also be a Crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord and a royal diadem in the hand of God the diadem is a crown one is a Crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord said again in a Royal diadem in the hand of God as the Bible said that I know them and no man shall pluck them out of my hand in no man is able to pluck them out of the father's hand and it says that a Crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord a royal diadem in the hand of God and this is the image that last week was just washing over me and I was going to stop by Burger King and get a crown and then I forgot to ask I forgot to ask if there was a crown that happened to me laying around the house and if you could just imagine this that there's a crowd it symbolizing a crown in his hand is very unique the crown is in his hand and the crown now the crown in the hand I want you to recognize there's going to be a change in this position where the crown in his hand is now placed upon his head and there there this is again I'm saying in type let those that are in his hand and they're going to be a crown in the hand of the Lord a royal die dim in the hand of God but there's got to come a time of The Headstone coming to the body there's got to come a capping there's got to come a crowning and the crown that is in his hand there comes a time when the crown is placed upon the head oh Hallelujah and recognize what this looks like in scripture seven women one bride and it says in Proverbs 12 4 a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband Hallelujah there comes a time where the very engagement ring that has been slipped on her finger there Comes A Time of the Union where the one that has been given the promise in the hand is going to be placed as a crown upon his head a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband oh maybe we'll get into it the next few service but she that maketh ashamed as rotten in his bones seven women one one bride a Godly wife meditate on this for the next few days a Godly wife is a crown to her husband and if a virtuous woman is a crown or a husband the bride is the crown to Christ she's the glory of Christ those that are those that are in his hand he crowns he's crowned with this The Virtuous Woman is a crown to her husband recognize what brother Branham writes in the church age book this is and I'll I'll even say this and uh let's take a deep breath many if they didn't know it was already said in the church age book would think this came from the catechism the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest now if you could ponder that a little bit we could say his his but what's on Earth her her what what's going to be expressed where's this image coming from the True Church of Jesus Christ is likened to pure gold he says there's no fault in her she's all glorious within and without this mystery Babylon could present herself without his glorious but her within she's glorious from beginning to ending she is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect here's this phrase in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God in hers the sum of the Eternal purpose of God in her in fact in her summed up the Eternal purpose of God in fact in her is summed up when vital musicians to come in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom of God the Eternal wisdom of God is summed up in her I want to make this very very practical I'm not going to do it today I want to make it I I'm leading and just been building to things very very practical and I love just how much of a broad Foundation we have so we realize these things are rooted in truths these things are based upon principles and found founded on very clear things in the bride is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom of God in Proverbs Chapter 4 verses 7 8 and 9 just catch this image as we close wisdom is the principle thing therefore get wisdom and with all that getting good understanding and I began to look at this as I see in the bride and brother Ramen future home takes the stages of the earth which you could just see through scripture and and there's there's others who'd postulated diagrammed and charted these things about the stages of the Earth and if you catch you don't need to go look at what others have done but let me just say it for you brother Branham changes drastically what men had probed at before and it completely changes and places things and he says that something really inspired him so he went and tried to find things and he found places where things were given and definitions were given and and his inspiration is leading me he's always it bringing it back to the word and there's this image that's being portrayed where he sees God doing stages to the Earth right and he says now it's the stages of the individual and what God does the individual does the Earth and he's seeing this these Reflections and then there's this stage of the future home that isn't necessarily in those threes but it's the final product he forms the wheat outside the three stages there's a final product that comes out of it and as he's looking at that this bride this bride has been portrayed Christ is bride future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride it's all being portrayed and as it goes through that process what what I began to recognize I just kind of was washing over me and this and this channel last week wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom with all that getting get understanding and I caught it from the from the perspective of God out of you you are what he's achieving you are what he's cultivating you're what he wants to get not that he wants a great beautiful kingdom he doesn't want this and he doesn't want that in all the pretense of it with what all is getting he wants to understand he wants wisdom and the Bible says exalt her and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee to honor when thou Embrace her and I saw this image of Christ raising up his bride lifting her up washing her he doesn't beat her down he doesn't bully her she he raises her up he lifts her up he washes her he's she he's exalting her and then what does she do she promotes him she lifts him up and she says oh to you be your glory honor and power oh and the image of these Elders being promoted to have a crown on their head and then what is it they do with their promotion they say sorry this is yours Oh Glory to you all power to you this attributes not my own it's yours he's like this is what I gave you this is what you gave me I don't take ownership I don't take glory and then it says she shall give to thine head an ornament of Grace Crown of Glory shall she deliver them oh oh for the joy which was set before him Christ knew he'd take the crown one day Satan offered it to him in the form of Kingdoms and he would have taken all those wives but he had In His Image one day there would be a bride that would be his crown one day the bride would deliver him the crowns [Music] she shall give thine head an ornament of Grace and a Crown of Glory shall she deliver thee this is why he's there writing with one head and many crowns is we've taken it we've given it all to him it's it's fully identified and placed in him and you're represented in this beautiful picture of Christ you're riding on a white horse then there's the impersonator impersonator of this Beast this Antichrist Spirit lifting up empowering a woman and now it gets real practical there's a kingdom power and a kingdom character of God and you can go listen to unveiling of God and God of this evil age in some of these places and where Bear Brown is going to bring these very scriptures into view and the challenge is that we've got to live like that Kingdom and recognize the spirit that's making women and making men after the things of this world could you stand together with me [Music]
