[0:00] above the things of the world and we in
[0:02] this the condition
[0:03] is moab but now we're looking at the
[0:05] opposition
[0:07] and i'm wanting to use orpah as a type
[0:10] of the opposition
[0:11] that you face in coming to the living
[0:14] bread of life
[0:15] that you face when feeding on the living
[0:16] bread of life remember that opposition
[0:18] in john chapter 6 where they came
[0:20] looking for the loaves and they wanted
[0:22] to eat
[0:22] so their natural belly could be filled
[0:24] and jesus starts preaching
[0:26] doctrine that's like well hey you know
[0:28] just feed this bread
[0:29] but jesus was actually sharing things
[0:32] that would be
[0:33] that would be the ultimate for the
[0:35] believer to accept the word the word of
[0:36] god to take him at his word
[0:38] because jesus knew i'm not always going
[0:40] to be breaking bread one day this body
[0:42] is going to be broken
[0:44] and and do you have a revelation that's
[0:45] going to cause you to stay faithful to
[0:47] this
[0:48] when those things happen so we're using
[0:50] orphan now
[0:51] as a representation of the opposition
[0:54] that we face and so this is in the in
[0:57] the book of ruth
[0:58] and i'll i'll point this out here in a
[1:00] moment i we're just taking
[1:03] from verse 14 uh and and 15 a little bit
[1:06] maybe we'll read verse 15 here in a
[1:08] second as well
[1:09] but when ruth makes her decision says
[1:11] ruth clave under naomi
[1:13] and orpas now take kissing her
[1:15] mother-in-law
[1:16] this is this is the opposition and the
[1:19] contrary example
[1:21] and the pressure that ruth would have
[1:23] been facing in the moment that she makes
[1:25] her clear-cut decision
[1:27] and it would even maybe be something
[1:28] that is following her as she goes
[1:31] further with naomi so i want you to
[1:32] think of this
[1:33] orpah represents opposition and it
[1:36] represents opposition to us
[1:38] there's something embodied in the
[1:39] example of orpah that represents the
[1:41] type of challenges that we face
[1:43] or the opposition that we face as
[1:46] believers
[1:46] who are pursuing christ with everything
[1:48] that's in us
[1:50] now i'll go back over these uh maybe
[1:53] some more statements here in a moment
[1:55] let me just say again orpah is a type of
[1:57] that lukewarm
[1:58] laodicean make believer i know that
[2:00] sounds really really aggravating and
[2:02] maybe a pretty good
[2:04] uh put down but it's not meant to be
[2:05] that way it's just to characterize
[2:07] a particular attitude a particular
[2:08] mindset kind of lukewarm neither hot nor
[2:11] cold
[2:12] a make believer in that they can profess
[2:14] and say all the right things when it
[2:16] comes to truth
[2:17] but yet they don't go all the way
[2:19] there's not a total surrender
[2:20] to the things of god so it's important
[2:23] for us to recognize
[2:24] now that if ruth represents us as the
[2:27] bride of christ
[2:29] this characterization of orpah is
[2:31] relevant to us
[2:32] can we just agree right there in relay
[2:34] and a few
[2:35] principles from before so now verse 14
[2:38] and i guess i'd like to read verse 15
[2:39] as well because i i think it helps give
[2:41] some of the context and they lifted up
[2:43] their voice and wept again
[2:45] and orpah kissed her mother-in-law but
[2:48] ruth clave unto her here's this
[2:50] difference now between ruth and orpah
[2:53] ruth cleaves to naomi we're going to see
[2:56] here in a moment
[2:57] what ruth says beginning in verse 16.
[3:00] but now
[3:00] naomi characterizes orpah's uh
[3:04] kiss behold thy sister-in-law has gone
[3:06] back unto her people
[3:07] and unto her gods return thou after thy
[3:10] sister-in-law
[3:11] so even though the scripture just says
[3:13] she kissed her mother-in-law
[3:15] there's something very clear that is
[3:16] signaled in doing this and naomi says
[3:19] she's gone back under her people and
[3:20] unto her god so there's a
[3:22] separation now from what naomi is doing
[3:25] and what ruth is going to purpose to do
[3:27] saying hey you know your god will be my
[3:29] god so we know there's this great
[3:30] contrast in that so this is some of the
[3:32] statements that brother braddah makes
[3:34] about
[3:34] orpah she's a type of the church
[3:37] normally the church formal so we can say
[3:39] maybe the nominal church
[3:41] the formal church she's a type of the
[3:43] church
[3:44] he says in another place she's a type of
[3:46] the modern
[3:47] church so think about some of these
[3:49] characterizations of orpah the formal
[3:51] church
[3:51] nominal church the modern church he says
[3:54] a type of the lukewarm church
[3:56] that once started out a type of the
[3:58] church that won't go
[3:59] all the way so this is this is express
[4:02] this is something that we could see in
[4:04] the scriptures that paul talks about and
[4:06] peter talks about
[4:07] and different ones talking about people
[4:08] who start in the faith they begin
[4:10] they they're professing they're
[4:12] believing in jesus christ they're
[4:13] claiming
[4:14] you know we really believe and we want
[4:15] to go all the way but certain things
[4:17] come up
[4:18] and they don't go all the way in so this
[4:21] is a type of the
[4:22] nominal church a modern church a
[4:24] lukewarm uh church experience and he
[4:26] says what a sad thing remember it never
[4:28] spoke her name anymore
[4:30] she was excommunicated because of her
[4:32] decision
[4:33] so orp is not mentioned again and he's
[4:36] using a unique phrase he's saying
[4:38] orpah is excommunicated because of the
[4:41] decision
[4:41] she makes in verse 14. now ruth and
[4:44] naomi don't say oh well we'll never
[4:46] mention her again
[4:47] never never never breathe her name again
[4:50] it's something that nao uh
[4:52] orpah's own decision excommunicates her
[4:55] he says the lukewarm church the lukewarm
[4:57] believer as each believer represents the
[4:59] church and he talks about the different
[5:00] representations
[5:02] and this is a statement we didn't get to
[5:04] last time he says this about orpah but
[5:05] because of popularity
[5:08] orpah will kiss the church where he says
[5:10] kiss the message
[5:13] kiss christ goodbye and go back to where
[5:17] he was hollowed out of orpah lukewarm
[5:20] excommunicated so orpah being lukewarm
[5:24] she's excommunicated she exit
[5:27] communicates herself
[5:28] from the promise of god by kissing the
[5:30] message goodbye
[5:32] kissing christ goodbye and going right
[5:34] back to the place that they were called
[5:36] out of
[5:37] and could you imagine that god calls you
[5:39] away from somewhere
[5:40] and you start out this is what god wants
[5:42] me to do and you know that god is
[5:44] calling you out of
[5:45] but then you come to this place this is
[5:47] because of popularity
[5:48] but you can put any kind of personal
[5:49] pressure in there
[5:51] any kind of temptation or weakness and
[5:54] money women popularity anything that you
[5:56] want to put in there
[5:57] it'll cause a person to kiss the message
[5:59] kiss christ goodbye
[6:00] and go right back to the place they were
[6:02] called out of and he said this is a
[6:04] lukewarm condition
[6:05] that would cause somebody to do that
[6:08] now this is at this point now i'm
[6:11] wanting to take a step further
[6:13] i think those things for those of us who
[6:14] are here together last wednesday
[6:17] those would be things that would be uh
[6:20] kind of reviewed to us
[6:21] and i want you to take some uh just
[6:25] some dramatization in your mind to think
[6:27] about the relationship
[6:29] that not only naomi would have had to
[6:30] ruth and orpah as daughter-in-laws
[6:32] but the relationship that ruth and orpah
[6:34] would have had together
[6:36] uh they marry brothers and in marion
[6:38] brothers they fight
[6:40] who's whose dad was had passed away i'm
[6:42] sure that there was some care that they
[6:43] gave to naomi
[6:45] and then in the passage of time as each
[6:47] one lost a spouse
[6:48] i i could imagine that these three
[6:50] became very close together
[6:53] i had a lot in common and as even
[6:56] naomi expresses it that you have dealt
[6:58] kindly
[6:59] with me you've dealt kindly with me in
[7:02] the passing you've dealt kindly to my
[7:04] husband or my chi
[7:05] my sons you've dealt kindly with me and
[7:08] she says i would that god would deal
[7:09] kindly with you
[7:10] as you've been kind to me so i'm wanting
[7:12] you to think about
[7:14] how close they would have been
[7:15] personally and how they they were family
[7:18] and they would have been we say family
[7:20] by marriage but then
[7:22] through the difficulties that they faced
[7:23] it would have bound them even closer
[7:25] together
[7:26] i i remember it causing me to remember
[7:28] one time for mother's day
[7:30] my sister got our mom
[7:33] her mom our mom got her a mother's day
[7:35] card that said
[7:36] you were like a mother to me and i
[7:39] thought mal isn't that profound
[7:41] that your mother is is like a mother to
[7:43] you and you say success mom
[7:46] you did it you were a mother and you're
[7:48] like a mother and so sometimes i'll say
[7:49] that about my own family
[7:51] somebody will ask me about david or
[7:53] matthew and i say well they're like a
[7:54] brother to me
[7:55] and you can read into that however you
[7:57] want but it's uh
[7:58] there were they were more than just uh
[8:01] related by marriage this would have been
[8:02] something that
[8:03] something would have bonded them
[8:04] together to the point to when the
[8:06] mother-in-law says hey i'm going back to
[8:07] israel their instinct would say we're
[8:09] going with you
[8:11] whereas some daughter-in-laws might be
[8:12] like about time
[8:15] no finally so there was a closeness
[8:18] there and i want you to
[8:19] consider that but now there comes a
[8:22] separation
[8:24] this is a part that i really want you to
[8:26] think about two different decisions are
[8:28] made ruth as her decision begins to get
[8:30] expressed and what it means to cleave
[8:32] she begins to express these things in
[8:34] verses 16 and 17
[8:36] and even to uh in verses 16 and 17 it
[8:40] kind of expresses
[8:41] ruth's prayer in cleveland and desire in
[8:43] cleveland to naomi
[8:44] and all we hear is orpah kisses her
[8:47] mother-in-law and naomi says she's gone
[8:49] back to serve her gods
[8:50] and back to her people so different
[8:52] decisions are made
[8:55] that place ruth and orpah
[8:58] in two different categories
[9:01] now although the bible is silent as to
[9:05] the the what would have happened in this
[9:07] moment in the relationships that would
[9:08] have existed
[9:09] or even the opposition that made it may
[9:11] have been expressed at this time
[9:14] i want to take the type based upon what
[9:16] orpah types
[9:18] the word the word expresses to us and
[9:20] shows us
[9:22] how orpah becomes the opposition to ruth
[9:25] now the bible is silent to it and i
[9:27] wouldn't want to
[9:28] try to read into the story till we go
[9:30] away from here saying well did you know
[9:32] that orpha said this about ruth
[9:34] the bible doesn't tell us what she said
[9:36] but we're what we recognize that orpha
[9:38] types the modern church the nominal
[9:40] church the former church the lukewarm
[9:42] church the make-believing church
[9:44] and so since that's what orpah types
[9:46] then we can look to the characteristics
[9:49] of the modern church the laodicean
[9:51] church the lukewarm church the
[9:52] make-believe in church
[9:53] and look at their characteristics to
[9:56] begin to understand
[9:57] how the orpah condition and the orpah
[10:00] attitude
[10:01] works against ruth
[10:05] that must have been really profound
[10:08] because i could just see heads exploding
[10:10] you know figuratively
[10:13] i need to write that down i need to post
[10:14] that on instagram later
[10:19] so i'm going to begin with the statement
[10:21] from the church age book
[10:23] now notice how he writes this in
[10:24] particular and i'm relying very heavily
[10:27] have a few scriptures in here but
[10:28] relying very heavily on the
[10:30] characterization of the modern church
[10:32] the lukewarm church
[10:34] as orpah types
[10:38] and then you've got to recognize the
[10:39] bride as ruth it says there's a true
[10:41] church and a false church
[10:42] so where you can say orpah and ruth the
[10:45] true church being roof
[10:46] the false church be an orpah there's a
[10:47] true vine and a false fine
[10:49] again there's our categories but of
[10:51] course that false church false vine body
[10:54] will always try to usurp the position of
[10:56] the true church and contend that she
[10:58] and not the elect are the real and
[11:00] authentic
[11:01] right i mean the false vine doesn't say
[11:04] hey
[11:04] we're the false vine yes we are we're
[11:06] just better than you
[11:08] all right that's not what they say they
[11:09] say we've got spirit yes we do we've got
[11:11] spirit how about you
[11:12] right and then like we got more spirit
[11:14] we got more spirit
[11:15] and that's what the false vines always
[11:17] get they believe that they are the true
[11:19] vine
[11:20] and they believe that they are the true
[11:21] church and and so it's not like from
[11:24] this position of where the fall is fine
[11:25] we just like to be this way
[11:27] i i think i remember someone shared a
[11:29] tweet with me one time it said something
[11:30] about this church of satan
[11:32] and um and the kind of the response was
[11:35] you know these this church of satan you
[11:37] know they lit
[11:38] you know what do you call people that
[11:39] literally believe in satan
[11:41] and i think was the church of satan that
[11:42] responded with christians
[11:45] i mean christians are the ones that
[11:47] literally believe in satan
[11:49] not necessarily the church of satan and
[11:51] so this uh with respect to
[11:53] the false vine and the false church and
[11:55] i'm church they don't they don't call
[11:57] themselves
[11:58] false fine tabernacle that that wouldn't
[12:01] that wouldn't make uh that's not where
[12:03] that that's not what the
[12:04] characterization is so
[12:06] as he's bringing this out he says the
[12:07] false vine will try to kill the true
[12:11] remember it doesn't have to be physical
[12:13] though it wasn't ages past the false
[12:15] fine
[12:15] the false will try to kill the truth so
[12:17] this is a characterization of
[12:18] the false church false vine that is how
[12:20] it was in the book of acts so you can go
[12:22] in the book of acts and find
[12:24] all the different instances where the
[12:26] disciples were persecuted
[12:28] killed right and lives threatened so he
[12:32] says it was that way in the book of acts
[12:34] that is how it is set forth in the seven
[12:36] ages
[12:37] and that is how it is declared in the
[12:38] various epistles and we can see that
[12:40] without needing to go into the bible
[12:43] could you agree tonight
[12:44] being bible readers we know in the
[12:45] epistles in the book of acts
[12:47] these are the things that the true
[12:49] church faced this is how that has been
[12:51] that is how it is now
[12:55] that is how it will be it can't change
[12:59] so this false vine and true vine and
[13:02] what seems to be a competition
[13:04] what seems to be a conflict it is a
[13:06] false vine wanting to kill the true vine
[13:09] not because they believe that as the
[13:12] false vine they're better than the true
[13:13] but it's because they believe they're
[13:14] the true vine
[13:16] and these others are the false vine now
[13:19] we we need to be honest with ourselves
[13:20] when we begin to think about uh
[13:22] christianity and the history of
[13:23] christianity
[13:24] and and the uh
[13:28] different uh words that were used for
[13:31] the campaigns of the churches throughout
[13:33] church history where they literally went
[13:35] out
[13:35] seeking to gain converts to the church
[13:38] and if they didn't believe
[13:39] they would commit genocide like this
[13:42] this is part of the history of churches
[13:44] this is part of the history of the
[13:45] catholic church this is part of the the
[13:47] inquisition
[13:48] the conquering of north america was you
[13:50] would show up at the doorstep of an
[13:52] indian civilization and say
[13:54] you need to accept christ except they
[13:55] weren't saying it in their language
[13:58] and if they didn't seem to agree with
[13:59] this christ that they were preaching
[14:01] they would kill all of them
[14:03] and why did they do that not in the name
[14:04] of the church of satan
[14:06] not in the name of the false vine not in
[14:08] the name of the antichrist they did it
[14:10] in the name of the church or in the name
[14:12] of christ in the state of christ
[14:14] and and so this is how that spirit acts
[14:16] and he says that's how it was then
[14:18] that's how it
[14:19] is now if you could just take that and
[14:22] begin to ponder that that spirit is
[14:24] alive today
[14:25] then it's very sobering to think that
[14:27] way and then he gives the example of in
[14:29] genesis chapter 4
[14:31] and the process of time abel and cain
[14:32] bring different offerings
[14:34] and how that came out in being wrath
[14:36] that god vindicated abel's offering
[14:38] killed abel he says but one cain was
[14:41] evil
[14:41] being the fa his father being of his
[14:44] father that wicked one while abel was
[14:46] righteous before the lord so here's one
[14:47] that's wicked by birth
[14:49] and here's one that is righteous by
[14:51] revelation again there were two children
[14:53] from the flesh of same
[14:55] same parents they were the twins of
[14:57] isaac and rebecca
[14:59] so now it's not just in embodied in cain
[15:01] and abel
[15:02] now think of how close this gets between
[15:04] jacob
[15:06] the the twins of isaac and rebecca one
[15:08] was the elective god
[15:10] and the other was reprobate remember
[15:13] romans 9
[15:14] according to election both worshiped god
[15:18] in every single case there was worship
[15:20] of god
[15:21] involved true vine false fine cain abel
[15:24] uh jacob esau in each
[15:28] instance there's worship that is is
[15:30] offered
[15:31] in every case the evil hated the
[15:33] righteous
[15:34] and persecuted the righteous in some
[15:37] cases the evil
[15:39] destroyed the righteous
[15:42] now this is i want you to ponder these
[15:44] characteristics now
[15:46] true church and false church you say
[15:47] well brother aaron he's not saying
[15:48] anything about modern church or lukewarm
[15:50] church well
[15:51] we'll get to where this is tied more
[15:52] closely together but i want you to
[15:54] recognize that there is a
[15:55] there is anointing of a false church
[15:57] that will try to kill the true
[15:59] in every case the evil hates the right
[16:01] just persecutes the righteous
[16:03] in some cases the evil destroyed the
[16:05] righteous he says but notice they were
[16:07] planted together
[16:08] they lived together they both made
[16:11] claims upon god and worshiped god
[16:14] with respect to the relationship between
[16:16] ruth and orpah
[16:17] and we both married brothers and they
[16:18] both have the same mother loan they both
[16:20] are starting out to go back to israel
[16:22] it's not that either one of them could
[16:23] have claimed to have been more righteous
[16:24] than the other
[16:26] but they're starting out together
[16:27] they're making claims upon god together
[16:29] they live together they plant they're
[16:30] planted together
[16:32] and now there comes a point to where we
[16:33] recognize there's a different anointing
[16:35] on the false vine
[16:36] and a different life in the true vine
[16:39] now brother branham in referring to
[16:42] and i took the scripture out in
[16:43] revelations chapter 2 i believe he says
[16:47] he's talking about the synagogue of
[16:49] satan and how they blasphemed and then
[16:50] it says it but
[16:52] this is what your opposition is and what
[16:54] you're overcoming how they'll kill you
[16:56] and they'll persecute you
[16:57] so he's looking at this um these
[16:59] dynamics of persecution and opposition
[17:02] as it says let me just read it real
[17:04] quick i know thy works in tribulation
[17:06] and poverty
[17:07] but thou art rich and i know the
[17:09] blasphemy of them which say they are
[17:11] jews and they are not
[17:12] but are the synagogue of satan fear none
[17:15] of these things which shall
[17:17] you shall suffer behold the devil shall
[17:19] cast some of you into prison that you
[17:21] may be tried
[17:22] and you shall have tribulation ten days
[17:24] but be thou faithful unto death
[17:25] and i'll give thee a crown of life so
[17:27] it's talking about tribulation
[17:28] persecution opposition
[17:30] and it says it's not that some that say
[17:32] they're jews but they're not they're of
[17:33] the
[17:33] synagogue of satan and notice how this
[17:35] is characterized i think this is very
[17:37] enlightening these of satan's synagogue
[17:40] were not blaspheming god in this
[17:42] instance though that goes without saying
[17:45] but they were blaspheming the true
[17:46] church
[17:49] isn't that interesting to think that
[17:50] well i'm not i'm not blaspheming god per
[17:53] se
[17:54] but because of who they were persecuting
[17:56] and who they were trying to kill
[17:58] they're blaspheming the true church and
[18:00] in doing so they blaspheme god and
[18:02] they're called blasphemers and of the
[18:03] synagogue of satan in doing so
[18:05] certainly as cain persecuted and killed
[18:08] abel
[18:08] because he cain was of that wicked one
[18:11] and as the dead
[18:12] formal judaic followers jesus said they
[18:14] were of their father the devil
[18:16] tried to destroy the christians in the
[18:18] first few years of the first age
[18:20] now this same group he says the false
[18:22] vine
[18:23] is even more strongly attempting to
[18:25] destroy the true believer in the second
[18:28] age so it's not just ardent zealous
[18:31] jews that are now trying to kill the
[18:32] church but now it's hybrid
[18:35] into the christian church and now they
[18:37] are intermingled in as a false and true
[18:40] vine begin to overlap and get mixing
[18:41] together
[18:42] and he says they're strongly attempting
[18:44] to destroy destroy the true believer in
[18:46] the second age
[18:47] that antichrist now catch this spirit
[18:51] i really really want you to identify
[18:53] that this is a
[18:54] spirit this is anointing that antichrist
[18:56] spirit is growing
[18:57] the group that inched its way ever so
[19:00] slowly in the church by its deeds
[19:02] nicolaitanism no longer fears exposure
[19:05] but is openly organized in a group
[19:08] remember that characterized moab
[19:10] of its own assembling and is coming
[19:12] against the true church
[19:14] in undisguised hostility
[19:17] it's not even disguised anymore like
[19:19] once you once you're comfortable with
[19:20] your group once you're comfortable with
[19:22] your
[19:22] organization once you feel that you've
[19:24] got strength in numbers in your assembly
[19:26] it doesn't have to be subtle anymore it
[19:29] doesn't have to be disguised hostility
[19:31] say now it's just open
[19:33] open undisguised hostility towards the
[19:36] true believer
[19:38] now i want you just to begin to ponder
[19:39] this because i'm intentionally holding
[19:41] something back so we kind of have this
[19:43] uh moment in the end where it kind of
[19:45] all clicks and makes sense realize
[19:46] oh okay now that makes sense
[19:50] so now that i kind of got your attention
[19:52] it took me 20 minutes but i did it
[19:54] uh 30 minutes actually now that i'm
[19:56] looking at the clock what
[19:58] if you if you notice this
[20:01] dynamic that's taking place where people
[20:03] get to the point
[20:04] where they're so comfortable in their
[20:06] organized group in their assembly
[20:07] that they can be openly hostile
[20:12] uh be hateful and mean and spiteful and
[20:15] and vindictive and oppressive so this is
[20:18] a spirit that could come upon people
[20:20] and they're not saying i renounce christ
[20:22] and the nature of christ and i don't
[20:23] believe that christ
[20:24] i don't believe in christ so therefore i
[20:26] can be mean and angry towards you
[20:28] they they will take the nature of christ
[20:31] and pervert it and say that they are
[20:33] being christ
[20:35] in this unbridled open hostility towards
[20:38] the true
[20:38] believer again let's not lose sight of
[20:42] the fact that i'm using
[20:43] this description and these terminologies
[20:46] that describe
[20:48] the modern church the lukewarm church
[20:50] the formal organized church
[20:53] which is which is more associated with
[20:55] the spirit and not any particular
[20:57] structure organization it's a spirit and
[21:00] how
[21:00] they will kill the true hate the true
[21:03] persecute the true try to destroy the
[21:06] true attempting to destroy the true
[21:08] believer
[21:08] even coming against the true church in
[21:10] undisguised hostility
[21:13] continuing in the same chapter of the
[21:15] sumerian church age this last age
[21:17] now now it's coming to the laodicean age
[21:19] this last it started with the fires of a
[21:21] pentecostal revival which was genuine
[21:24] and true
[21:26] okay never forget that that was genuine
[21:29] and that was real
[21:31] it says they organized it right back
[21:34] instead of taking the word they took
[21:35] their own ideas and did just what every
[21:37] age has done
[21:38] substituted the manual for the word
[21:41] they had a manual they had they had
[21:44] something
[21:44] written down they had their doctrine had
[21:46] their theology they had it all kind of
[21:47] tidied up and figured out and they had
[21:48] their compendium they had their
[21:50] their works they had everything together
[21:52] and that became their uh their truth and
[21:54] their authority and they
[21:55] used the manual instead of the word just
[21:58] you step
[21:58] outside the manual and see what happens
[22:00] so now as we picture this
[22:02] a real genuine move of god as god begins
[22:04] to move people kind of extract from that
[22:06] a particular ideology a certain system a
[22:08] certain order
[22:09] and they kind of sum it up in a body of
[22:11] something that they call a manual
[22:12] and now he's saying now you now that the
[22:15] manual's been
[22:16] uh put together if you step outside of
[22:19] the manual watch what happens
[22:23] you're out brother and they'll persecute
[22:25] you
[22:26] and blame it on god
[22:29] huh can i get a witness
[22:33] yes this is exactly what happens you
[22:34] step outside of their framework outside
[22:36] of their ideology outside of their
[22:38] doctrine
[22:39] outside of their manual they you're out
[22:41] brother
[22:42] and they will persecute you so this is
[22:45] their nature this is nc
[22:47] they're going to persecute and when they
[22:49] do it they're going to blame it on god
[22:52] either blame it on god or they're going
[22:54] to say you know god made me do it or
[22:55] this is god that's causing me to do it
[22:57] and how they love their organization
[23:00] this is moab again how they love their
[23:01] organization no wonder
[23:03] they are second generation pentecostals
[23:05] and since god doesn't have any
[23:06] grandchildren they're just
[23:08] children of their fathers known by their
[23:10] creeds in form of worship
[23:13] and i don't think this that the
[23:14] independents will escape this
[23:16] don't think as message believers we
[23:18] don't escape this you have got to have
[23:19] your own
[23:20] personal experience with christ does not
[23:22] have grandchildren if you are born into
[23:24] a perfect message church
[23:26] you are not by default a perfect message
[23:28] believer
[23:29] you must be born again you've got to
[23:32] have your own experience and your own
[23:33] birth
[23:34] he says and this is heavy i was actually
[23:36] not wanting to read this far or read
[23:38] this much i wanted to end with
[23:39] they blame it on god but when i read
[23:41] this i was like well we got to read this
[23:43] they can talk about what used to be but
[23:45] they can't produce it
[23:47] once they had the lightning but about
[23:49] all that is left is the thunder
[23:53] my once they used to have something they
[23:56] had lightning but now all that is left
[23:58] is
[23:58] noise thunder and this is the condition
[24:01] of what he calls second generation
[24:03] pentecostals
[24:04] second generation believers second
[24:06] generation anyone
[24:07] who has not experienced the genuine
[24:09] themselves
[24:10] and just comes along afterwards after a
[24:12] pattern's been laid down a move of god
[24:14] has happened
[24:15] and things begin to take place and all
[24:17] you do is kind of fit within the
[24:18] framework of the manual
[24:20] and you operate within the parameters
[24:21] what the manual says and everything is
[24:23] organized and everything is assembled
[24:25] together and everything everything seems
[24:26] to be functioning correctly
[24:28] he says if you step outside of that
[24:30] they'll persecute you and blame it on
[24:32] god
[24:33] and he's saying the problem is these are
[24:35] second generation
[24:37] people they're operating in the carnal
[24:40] dynamics and they may even be able to
[24:43] talk about what
[24:44] used to be and how god used to move but
[24:46] really they can't produce it and when
[24:48] they do it's just thunder
[24:50] and thunder's still a lot to scare
[24:52] people
[24:56] now brother branham is making reference
[24:59] to revelations chapter 13. he's making
[25:01] reference to a lot of different things
[25:02] in this portion but i wanted to narrow
[25:04] it down
[25:05] in the fourth seal bible is talking
[25:08] about this false church this organized
[25:09] church
[25:11] and and the modern church he said that's
[25:14] what they do
[25:15] just persecute do we just think about
[25:18] the bullet points that we're listing now
[25:20] about this church persecutes kills
[25:24] destroys undisguised hostility
[25:28] persecute and blame god he says that's
[25:30] just what they do they just persecute
[25:33] them could you imagine a church being
[25:34] called persecutor fellowship
[25:36] you know that's just what we do and
[25:38] that's like their tagline
[25:40] you know come persecute with us come be
[25:43] a part of persecute fellowship
[25:45] that's just what we do you're either
[25:47] with us or you're against us and if
[25:49] you're not with us we're going to
[25:50] persecute you and that's kind of how
[25:52] they get people
[25:53] to get on board i don't want to be
[25:54] persecuted let's go to that church
[25:57] he said that's just what they do just
[25:58] persecute just the same thing
[26:01] the churches makes just as fun of the
[26:04] true bride of christ as
[26:05] rome ever did
[26:08] think at the very time listen march 21st
[26:11] 1963 think about
[26:13] at the time when this separation is
[26:14] taking place at the time when the word
[26:16] of god is going to be coming forth in a
[26:18] way
[26:18] to really show how christ has been
[26:20] rejected and denominations have taken
[26:22] hold and
[26:23] ideologies have confused the true nature
[26:25] of christ and muddied up the scripture
[26:27] he's saying the churches today churches
[26:29] make fun of the true bride
[26:31] just as much as rome ever did how did
[26:33] rome make fun of her
[26:35] well they didn't just sit there and kind
[26:36] of wag their tongue at him and laugh at
[26:38] him
[26:38] they persecuted him to death
[26:42] so they will do they do the same thing
[26:44] they persecute the churches make just as
[26:46] fun of the true bride of christ
[26:47] as rome ever did now this is a great
[26:49] point i realize now
[26:51] just how much easier it is for me to
[26:53] make this transition
[26:55] rome persecuted the church to literal
[26:57] death
[26:59] and when i say literal i'm not using it
[27:00] figuratively though that's how we use it
[27:02] today right
[27:04] literal is figurative i literally lost
[27:06] my mind
[27:07] where'd it go you know i literally died
[27:10] when i heard that that's figurative now
[27:12] i'm using literally literally
[27:14] in that they literally took the lives of
[27:16] christians if they professed christ they
[27:18] didn't believe the way of the church if
[27:19] they
[27:20] did things that were contrary to the
[27:21] manual they would kill them
[27:24] the spirit is alive today but they won't
[27:27] kill you
[27:28] physically they'll kill you in an
[27:31] assassination of your character
[27:32] ostracization from the fellowship
[27:34] they'll
[27:35] there's things that they can do to try
[27:36] to destroy you and kill you and there's
[27:38] even a consequence
[27:40] that is a spiritual death that could
[27:42] take place within this
[27:43] as we can maybe go a little bit further
[27:45] in it but i want you to begin to
[27:46] recognize that
[27:47] as they make fun of the true bride of
[27:48] christ it's spiritual persecution
[27:51] the continuity with what we've been
[27:53] ministering on sundays and how these
[27:55] 200 million million demons that have
[27:57] been loosed
[27:58] at the river euphrates that worked in a
[28:00] political realm to persecute the jews
[28:02] during the second world war
[28:04] now works in an ecumenical religious
[28:06] realm to persecute the true church
[28:08] right so this is this is the angle
[28:12] and and this is i want you to catch it
[28:13] if it's in that way as a spirit and it's
[28:16] not a literal death i want you to begin
[28:17] to think
[28:18] more spiritually about this and catch
[28:20] this this is very very important
[28:22] if if we have preached this in such a
[28:24] way to where now
[28:26] you have gotten to the point where you
[28:27] begin to arm yourself against
[28:29] orpah and you actually have a list of
[28:31] orpas
[28:32] in your notes like oh that's definitely
[28:34] brothers so-and-so
[28:35] and you're getting a list together stop
[28:37] for a moment
[28:39] it's not a person it's a spirit
[28:43] okay i i want you to pause a little bit
[28:45] and ask yourself
[28:47] what how how how is this going to be
[28:49] expressed how is it going to be made
[28:50] manifest it isn't the person it's the
[28:52] system
[28:53] it isn't the person it's the
[28:54] organization
[28:56] so it's an anointing not a person so we
[28:59] begin to talk about orpah we should not
[29:00] think about any particular person
[29:03] we should not think about any particular
[29:04] organization we should not think about
[29:06] any particular church
[29:07] because in doing so you could be acting
[29:09] like an orpah
[29:13] and you can start criticizing and
[29:15] persecuting and running down
[29:17] who you call orpha but you're the
[29:19] popcorn the kettle black
[29:20] because you're the one with the critical
[29:22] spirit
[29:24] you know i don't like them they're
[29:25] critical and and you know what they'll
[29:27] just sit there and they'll talk about
[29:28] you and they're just critical that i
[29:30] guarantee right now they have their
[29:31] hands on their hips right now talking
[29:32] about how critical we are
[29:37] all right and not for a moment
[29:38] recognizing the irony
[29:44] so it's not the person it's the spirit
[29:50] when we when we take this that's orp we
[29:52] talk about rejecting the word not going
[29:54] further in truth it represents a way of
[29:56] thinking
[29:57] it represents a way of acting it
[29:59] represents a way of justifying carnal
[30:01] actions it represents
[30:03] a way of justifying excuses and
[30:04] justifying decisions and justifying
[30:07] the lack of morality and and giving
[30:09] reasons as the way they are and then
[30:11] an attitude that tries to make a
[30:13] distinction between why you're doing
[30:15] things and why they're doing things
[30:16] and a way to to complicate a person's
[30:20] uh thought process that cognitive
[30:21] dissonance to make themselves feel all
[30:23] right
[30:23] it's not the person it's a spirit
[30:27] and if a person is caught up in a move
[30:29] to where there's there
[30:30] it's hostile and it's persecuting it and
[30:33] it's aggressive and it's trying to tear
[30:34] something down
[30:35] even some kind of move that would try to
[30:37] defile the truth of god and tear down
[30:39] the truth of god's prophets and
[30:41] and change history and and try to
[30:43] explain away the bible and explain away
[30:45] vindication
[30:46] you have to recognize that's a spirit
[30:48] and though it may be embodied in a group
[30:50] or an assembly or even have a name
[30:52] attached to it remember it's a spirit
[30:54] it's not
[30:55] the individual it's not the person it's
[30:57] the organization
[30:59] it's the system it's an anointing
[31:07] and this is this statement here
[31:11] is going to going to help us to look at
[31:13] this a little bit differently
[31:14] brother brahman kinsman redeemer now in
[31:16] kinsman redeemer he's where he says orp
[31:18] is a type of the lukewarm church that
[31:19] started
[31:20] a type of the church they won't go all
[31:21] the way it's a sad thing she was
[31:23] excommunicated because of her decision
[31:25] lukewarm church lukewarm believer
[31:27] who kisses the message kisses christ
[31:29] goodbye orpah lukewarm excommunicated
[31:32] so notice all those very very heavy
[31:35] difficult statements about orpah in the
[31:37] message kinsmen redeemer
[31:39] and now he says you are sons and
[31:41] daughters of god
[31:42] who have received the holy ghost
[31:46] now if you're orp a bunch and
[31:49] turned away but if you went on through
[31:52] the holy spirit
[31:53] you become sons and daughters now it's
[31:55] maybe a little bit of a garbled
[31:57] statement if you're the orpa bunch and
[31:59] turned away
[32:00] now he's done something and i want you
[32:02] to catch this even though it may seem to
[32:03] be somewhat of a
[32:04] a thought that got cut off you are sons
[32:07] and daughters of god because you've
[32:08] received the holy ghost
[32:10] but orpah is characterized as having
[32:12] turned away
[32:14] he says you've went on through the holy
[32:16] spirit and become sons and daughters of
[32:18] god
[32:18] so nobody can claim that they are truly
[32:21] sons and daughters of god
[32:22] unless they've been born again so the
[32:24] distinction and the categorization now
[32:26] is not so much well you're an orphan
[32:29] you're a ruth but you have a group that
[32:30] are know that their sons and daughters
[32:33] of god
[32:34] buy a new birth experience and then
[32:36] those who've turned away from it or who
[32:38] have not yet
[32:39] gone through the baptism of the holy
[32:40] ghost
[32:42] so we can say that the difference
[32:43] between ruth and orpah is the new birth
[32:48] and don't miss this this is very very
[32:50] important i want you to catch this in
[32:51] galatians chapter 4
[32:53] verses 28 to 31 paul is bringing out
[32:57] these similar things as we've already
[32:58] seen kind of the distinction betweens
[33:00] and
[33:00] distinction among parents and children
[33:03] he says now we brethren as
[33:05] isaac was are the children of the
[33:07] promise
[33:09] paul is saying that isaac
[33:12] was a child of the promise and abraham's
[33:16] other son
[33:18] through hagar was not a child of the
[33:20] promise
[33:21] ishmael was not a child of the promise
[33:23] you have isaac who is a child
[33:24] of the promise you have another son that
[33:26] came from that father
[33:28] but he's not a child of the promise and
[33:30] he says
[33:31] but as then he that was born after the
[33:34] flesh
[33:35] persecuted him that was born after the
[33:37] spirit
[33:38] even so it is now so you have those
[33:42] who are born after the flesh we'd have
[33:45] an ishmael
[33:45] a product of a union a child of if we
[33:48] could say of the church
[33:50] a second generation this is not
[33:53] a child of the promise and he's making
[33:55] the distinction one is born after the
[33:57] flesh one is born after the spirit
[34:00] and the one who's born after the flesh
[34:02] still has
[34:03] the ability and has the capacity to
[34:06] persecute
[34:08] and who do they persecute people who are
[34:09] born after the spirit because he's
[34:11] saying just as it was then
[34:12] a child of the flesh persecuted him that
[34:14] was after the spirit
[34:15] being isaac even so it is now it says
[34:18] nevertheless what saith the scripture
[34:20] cast out the bondwoman and her son
[34:24] for the son of the bond moon shall not
[34:26] be heir with the son of the free woman
[34:28] and he can he continues says we are
[34:30] children of the promise
[34:33] so we who are elected of god and receive
[34:36] the baptism all like oh she's saying you
[34:38] are children of the promise
[34:39] you have been baptized into christ you
[34:41] have been put onto christ
[34:43] put on christ so by election you are a
[34:45] child
[34:46] of the promise if somebody is not
[34:49] born again they are living after the
[34:51] what
[34:52] the flesh and all they can do is walk in
[34:55] the flesh
[34:56] and he says it very clearly they that
[34:58] are born after the flesh
[35:00] persecute those that are born after the
[35:02] spirit
[35:04] and he picks this up and the sea does
[35:06] not air with the shock he says just like
[35:07] paul said here and he's referring to
[35:08] galatians 4.
[35:09] did not the seed of the bondwoman
[35:11] persecute the seed of the free woman
[35:13] and so does the seed of the denomination
[35:16] persecute the genuine grain
[35:19] it's always got to be that way they'll
[35:21] not be heirs together they'll not
[35:23] associate it together
[35:24] they're absolutely two different
[35:26] promises two different times two
[35:27] different peoples all together
[35:29] one is the bride the other one is a
[35:31] church no comparison at
[35:33] all with them how do you become part of
[35:37] that bride
[35:38] by election what gets you into that body
[35:43] by being baptized by one spirit
[35:47] that's what puts you into that
[35:48] fellowship that's what puts you into
[35:50] that body
[35:52] but notice the characterization now and
[35:54] i'm i'm using it
[35:56] in particular about orpah
[35:59] and the opposition that ruth is going to
[36:01] face
[36:03] is that seed always persecutes the
[36:06] genuine grain
[36:07] so it's got to be that way why because
[36:10] they're two different promises two
[36:11] different times two different peoples
[36:12] one is the bride
[36:13] the other one is the church so you have
[36:16] the bride
[36:17] ruth you have the church orpah orpah is
[36:20] the opposition
[36:22] to roof just as the church today
[36:25] is the opposition against the bride the
[36:28] opposition in the same way that moab
[36:30] called to israel to get them to
[36:32] compromise and come together
[36:33] the same way that we can begin to
[36:35] dramatize taking the example of what the
[36:37] modern church does today
[36:39] how that orpah is represented today
[36:42] as having this attitude and this
[36:44] animosity
[36:45] in this bitter hostility towards the
[36:48] elect
[36:50] where it says they persecute that's what
[36:52] they do they persecute they make
[36:54] fun of the bride
[36:57] they hate the righteous they persecute
[36:59] the righteous they destroy the righteous
[37:01] they will kill
[37:02] the true they blaspheme the true church
[37:06] they attempt to destroy the true
[37:08] believer
[37:10] and they come against the true church in
[37:12] undisguised
[37:13] hostility again the difference is
[37:16] election but i want you to catch this
[37:21] those of us who are when are all of us
[37:23] when we are born
[37:24] we are born after the flesh right
[37:27] it should have been my biggest amen all
[37:28] night when we are born
[37:30] we are born between a man and a woman
[37:33] that
[37:33] that is that is that gives us our nature
[37:36] of our parents
[37:37] and then we're raised in the nurture of
[37:39] our earthly parents and the society and
[37:40] the culture that we're raised in
[37:42] and this produces the natural being and
[37:44] in doing that
[37:45] it is not that's not what manifests
[37:47] sonship
[37:49] that's not what manifests our
[37:50] relationship to christ if you are born
[37:53] and you are ordained to life there is a
[37:56] predestinated seed
[37:57] in you even from the moment that you're
[37:59] born
[38:00] but you do not manif you do not become
[38:04] you do not come into relationship as a
[38:06] son until you're born again
[38:09] and that's that's when there's a
[38:10] division that takes place
[38:12] so whatever happens from the moment that
[38:14] you're born after the flesh to the
[38:16] moment that you're born again
[38:17] we live lives that look a lot like the
[38:19] children of disobedience
[38:21] now what paul taught us we're in times
[38:23] past we walked like in the course of
[38:24] this world
[38:25] we acted like the children disobedience
[38:27] we were like the children of wrath but
[38:29] yet we weren't ordained to that
[38:31] you couldn't tell our lives any
[38:33] differently so this is just kind of the
[38:35] attitude check this is the point
[38:37] point where we kind of check ourselves
[38:38] and realize that we
[38:40] do not want to make the mistake
[38:43] of acting like orpah
[38:46] and acting like the lukewarm laodicean
[38:49] believer
[38:50] by using the language of the laodicean
[38:54] believer
[38:55] i had some friends one time that would
[38:57] tell me that when they first came to the
[38:59] lord and began
[39:00] to serve god that they would see
[39:01] somebody in the world and they would
[39:03] actually make the comment revelations 3
[39:04] 17
[39:06] that's what they would say about people
[39:08] and and it was just it was misguided
[39:10] zeal and that their lives were
[39:11] completely
[39:12] changed and they recognize wow look how
[39:15] lukewarm the world is and look how
[39:16] sinful they are and look how they're
[39:18] acting and they're
[39:18] rich and increased with goods and and
[39:20] they're but they're blind miserable poor
[39:22] wretched
[39:23] and so they had a phrase that they used
[39:25] to talk about
[39:26] how blind and miserable and wretched
[39:28] these people on laodicea were
[39:30] not realizing that that is the dominant
[39:33] characteristic of somebody in laodicea
[39:35] to look at somebody and call them out on
[39:37] it like that
[39:39] what kind of this arrogance and this
[39:40] this air of superiority
[39:42] and they had their reckoning that
[39:44] they're humbling and they realized it
[39:49] so we have to check ourselves that the
[39:52] word the nev the word the truth
[39:54] never arms us to be the persecutor
[39:58] the truth never arms us to be hostile
[40:01] and so in the church age book brother
[40:04] branham writes this
[40:05] now we can see why there were two vines
[40:07] one true and one false
[40:09] now we can see why abraham had two sons
[40:12] one after the flesh that persecuted
[40:15] isaac
[40:16] and one after promise now we can see how
[40:19] that
[40:19] out of the same parents two boys came
[40:21] forth as twins one knowing and loving
[40:23] the things of god and the other knowing
[40:25] much of the same truth but not the same
[40:28] spirit
[40:29] hence persecuted the child that was
[40:31] elect now
[40:32] it's embodied in jacob esau
[40:36] now we see here even in the promise as
[40:38] he brings it out
[40:39] even in a more deeply one after the
[40:41] flesh one after the promise though they
[40:43] may seem to be a part of the same church
[40:44] believing the same thing
[40:46] how there can be a division amongst them
[40:47] where one is born after the spirit
[40:49] the other one after the flesh but not of
[40:50] the same spirit and
[40:52] hence persecuted the child that was
[40:54] elect
[40:56] notice this characteristic of one that
[40:58] is not born of the spirit
[41:00] they persecute the elect they are they
[41:02] are prone to they have the tendency
[41:04] they have the unbridled capacity they
[41:06] can engage in
[41:08] undisguised hostility they can actually
[41:11] persecute you and blame it on god
[41:16] and this is very profound god did not
[41:18] reprobate for the sake of reprobation
[41:20] he reprobated for the sake of the elect
[41:24] it's a very very profound statement
[41:26] reprobation was not for the sake of
[41:28] reprobation
[41:28] but it was because there was an election
[41:31] then this is a statement i know you all
[41:32] heard this before elect cannot persecute
[41:35] elect
[41:36] elect cannot harm elect we often use it
[41:40] this way bride
[41:41] cannot persecute bride we heard it that
[41:43] way too
[41:44] this is where it comes from elect cannot
[41:46] persecute elect elect cannot harm you
[41:48] like
[41:48] it is the reprobates that persecute and
[41:50] destroy
[41:51] the elect all those reprobates are
[41:54] religious they are smart they are of the
[41:56] cane line the serpents they build their
[41:57] babels they build their cities they
[41:59] build their empires
[42:00] and all the while calling on god they
[42:03] hate the true seed
[42:04] and they will do all they can even in
[42:06] the name of the lord to destroy
[42:08] god's elect ones and i i left this in
[42:12] here because i think it's
[42:14] important but they are needed what is
[42:16] the chaff to the wheat
[42:17] no chaff no wheat
[42:20] but at the end what happens to the chaff
[42:23] it's burned with fire unquenchable
[42:25] and the wheat where is it it's gathered
[42:28] in his garner
[42:29] it is where he is
[42:32] the wheat has its day coming
[42:36] just as much as the shuck does the wheat
[42:39] has its ultimate vindication she's going
[42:41] to end up in his presence
[42:42] while there's judgment that awaits the
[42:44] the rest of the wheat plant so there's a
[42:46] ultimate rest that the believer must
[42:48] have that the wheat must have
[42:49] that one day it's going to be gathered
[42:50] into his garner it is where he is but
[42:52] then there's a judgment that awaits
[42:53] those that what hate the true seed do
[42:55] all they can to destroy the elect ones
[42:58] and he characterizes them they persecute
[43:00] the child that's elect
[43:01] they that one after the flesh persecutes
[43:03] isaac and he says elect cannot persecute
[43:05] elect elect cannot harm like
[43:07] it's the reprobates that persecute and
[43:10] destroy
[43:11] the elect
[43:15] i'm just wrapping this up here i'm just
[43:17] finishing i have just one
[43:18] quick scripture to read but i'm just
[43:21] making my final point
[43:23] the difference between and orpah as we
[43:26] said before was the new birth
[43:30] not the first birth
[43:34] but the new birth because by first birth
[43:38] they're both moabites
[43:41] by first birth they they have an
[43:43] attitude they have a way of worship they
[43:45] have systems and organizations
[43:46] and the difference now as as we have
[43:49] been
[43:50] trust that we've been very deliberate in
[43:52] kind of following the same line
[43:54] of language we can begin to see this
[43:55] difference and you begin to see how
[43:56] orpah becomes the opposition to ruth
[43:59] but remember it's a spirit
[44:03] it's not the person it's a spirit it's
[44:05] the system it's an organization
[44:07] and notice in galatians chapter 1 verse
[44:08] 13 could have read also in corinthians
[44:10] where paul makes reference to it
[44:12] in another place but just one verse to
[44:13] make this point galatians chapter 1
[44:15] verse 13.
[44:16] for you have heard of my conversation in
[44:19] time
[44:19] past in the jews religion how that this
[44:22] is paul speaking
[44:23] all right this is paul do we believe
[44:25] he's a christian
[44:27] we believe he was caught up in the third
[44:28] heaven believe he's the apostle of god
[44:30] he's a prophet of god
[44:32] he's in the body of christ listen how
[44:34] that beyond measure i
[44:36] persecuted the church of god and wasted
[44:39] it
[44:41] here's paul being so bold as to say
[44:44] i beyond measure persecuted the church i
[44:47] beyond
[44:48] the measure destroyed the church i i
[44:51] went so far
[44:52] as to hunt them down and persecute them
[44:54] he even says later on in the book of
[44:55] acts i was holding the code of stephen
[44:57] while he was stoned
[44:58] he is openly declaring he even says one
[45:00] place he blaspheme he says but i did it
[45:02] ignorantly
[45:03] right so here's paul
[45:06] now if any one of us would have seen
[45:08] paul if we would have lived in that they
[45:09] would have been a lot like the other
[45:11] uh the believers that the day says well
[45:13] isn't this the same guy that
[45:14] is killing us and they're a little bit
[45:16] reluctant they had to break out of this
[45:19] mindset that it's the person and not a
[45:20] spirit and realize
[45:22] that despite his blasphemy despite his
[45:24] persecution
[45:25] despite his destroying if there's an
[45:27] election on the inside of him
[45:29] it breaks the hold of that spirit and he
[45:32] became a son of god
[45:36] and it shows us it's not the person we
[45:38] never
[45:39] hate the person we hate the sin don't
[45:42] hate the sinner
[45:43] hate the sin don't hate the individual
[45:46] hate the organization
[45:47] don't hate the person hate the system
[45:49] don't get all
[45:51] mad at a church in the name of the
[45:53] church of the people in the church
[45:54] realize there's there's attitudes and
[45:56] anointings and there's deep histories
[45:58] sometimes
[45:58] that make people the way they are and we
[46:01] should be a people like paul
[46:02] who can be empathetic when other people
[46:05] can be very angry and very bitter and
[46:06] very hostile
[46:10] the statement is elect cannot persecute
[46:12] elect elect cannot harm you like
[46:14] we say bride will not persecute bride
[46:16] bride will not
[46:17] harm bride you know why do you know why
[46:21] the elect don't persecute anyone
[46:25] you realize that when it says not
[46:28] persecute bride
[46:29] or elect cannot persecute elect it
[46:32] doesn't mean but oh man
[46:34] just wait till you see what they do to
[46:35] the non-elect
[46:39] tell me do elect persecute non-elect
[46:44] no do we sometimes
[46:48] yeah what does that tell us i'm not
[46:51] walking in my election
[46:54] elect do not persecute elect because
[46:56] they don't persecute anyone
[46:59] that's not what elect do they don't need
[47:02] to show hostility
[47:03] don't they don't need to waste they
[47:06] don't need to blaspheme the false church
[47:07] or tear it down or run it down to the
[47:09] individual's in it
[47:11] so elect do not persecute anyone
[47:15] but as individuals without the birth
[47:19] we can do it as individuals who
[47:23] walk after the flesh we can do it amen
[47:27] this is our challenge for us
[47:31] because maybe in some ways i just want
[47:32] you to ponder it maybe in some ways
[47:35] orp is our flesh
[47:39] maybe orpah isn't the neighbor next door
[47:43] maybe orpah isn't this church or that
[47:45] system or that organization maybe orp at
[47:47] the end of the day
[47:48] is just how much our carnal minds
[47:49] sometimes fight
[47:51] and resist against how god deals with
[47:54] our souls
[47:55] and the opposition is right within
[47:57] ourselves
[47:58] and we have to realize at some point
[48:00] wait a minute orpah doesn't have my best
[48:02] in mind
[48:03] or does it want me to succeed orpah
[48:06] doesn't want me to overcome orbit
[48:07] doesn't want me to grow orpah doesn't
[48:09] want
[48:09] this this truth to be made manifest in
[48:12] my flesh and you realize the opposition
[48:13] sometimes
[48:14] is so close it's not even without it's
[48:18] within
[48:21] ponder it tonight and think about this
[48:24] opposition
[48:25] and i'd want you to take away this as
[48:27] the bride
[48:29] we're not hostile towards anyone
[48:32] as the bride we don't persecute anyone
[48:34] we stand for truth
[48:37] and we live we live truth truthfully and
[48:39] we're honest with ourselves so you know
[48:40] sometimes maybe i don't
[48:42] walk in my election sometimes i don't
[48:44] have the right attitude
[48:46] and sometimes the orp is in me we want
[48:48] to overcome it
[48:50] let's stand together tonight
[48:57] you can come musicians but a little bit
[48:59] of micah
[49:09] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[49:12] if you need prayer tonight
[49:14] i believe that you can lift your hand
[49:15] before the lord and express
[49:18] what's in your heart to him by lifted
[49:20] hand
[49:23] it it may be lord i need an attitude
[49:26] adjustment
[49:29] my flesh my orpah is very robust right
[49:32] now it's very strong
[49:35] my my critical nature getting the best
[49:38] of me
[49:41] we could be honest is to say lord help
[49:42] me in my bitterness help me my hurt and
[49:44] my pain
[49:46] and he'll help you i know he'll help you
[49:50] so with hands raised tonight before i'm
[49:52] asking god to help you
[49:55] say lord i want to take the way with
[49:56] your despised few
[50:02] lord i want to do what i know a believer
[50:03] ought to do
[50:06] no matter how hard it is on my flesh no
[50:07] matter what the circumstances and
[50:09] consequences may be
[50:12] the opposition i may face
[50:15] lord i i want to go all the way with you
[50:19] i want to do what's right
[50:23] you just ask god to help you tonight
[50:26] heavenly father
[50:31] as we stand in your divine presence
[50:33] tonight with hands lifted up
[50:36] we're using honesty tonight
[50:41] not instinctively to ask that you would
[50:44] heal us of the wounds that we have
[50:45] received at the hands of orpah
[50:48] but lord first we're asking that you
[50:50] forgive us for being
[50:53] we're doing as your scripture as it
[50:54] wanted us to do to remove the beam from
[50:56] our eye
[50:58] because perhaps lord it's our being our
[51:00] orpha beam
[51:02] has caused us to see a sliver in someone
[51:03] else
[51:06] we realize lord that if we're ever going
[51:08] to be able to endure persecution and
[51:10] rejection estrangement and hurts
[51:14] at the hands of others and false
[51:17] anointing
[51:19] then you need to we need to have you
[51:21] resolve our own bitterness
[51:24] if our spirit's going to remain clean if
[51:26] we're going to have a clean conscience
[51:27] if we're going to be able to
[51:29] experience the full liberty that we
[51:30] ought to as christians
[51:32] we need to be honest with you tonight
[51:34] lord there's times when i have a
[51:36] language
[51:38] of a carnal believer i have the attitude
[51:42] of someone who's born only after the
[51:44] flesh
[51:46] the lord may we in confidence knowing
[51:48] that we're children of the promise
[51:51] be able to like be like naomi speak a
[51:53] blessing
[51:55] [Music]
[51:57] but i know it's hard i know it's
[51:59] difficult i even know lord there's times
[52:00] when the anointing requires that sin is
[52:02] called out there's times
[52:04] when we must be able to stand on
[52:05] principle and tell someone with
[52:07] plainness of speech that they're
[52:08] making a mistake or that they're an
[52:10] error lord and we can never compromise
[52:12] truth for the sake of making someone
[52:14] feel good
[52:16] but truly lord that never gives us the
[52:18] right to have the wrong spirit towards
[52:20] somebody else
[52:21] and then we never justify a nasty
[52:24] attitude by saying it's our righteous
[52:26] indignation may we never justify
[52:28] persecution and hostility
[52:30] and blame it on you so give us clean
[52:33] hearts lord
[52:35] purge us lord of these things these
[52:37] dynamics try to make us
[52:40] to belittle and run down but even in our
[52:43] particular hurts and pains that we
[52:45] experience at the hands of others
[52:47] it seems it would be so easy to just be
[52:49] able to say oh well that's just because
[52:50] they're an unbeliever that's because
[52:51] they're unregenerate and that's because
[52:52] they're reprobate
[52:57] but still be able to intercede for them
[52:59] say lord forgive them for they know not
[53:00] what they do
[53:03] lord help me if there's anything lacking
[53:04] in my approach and my attitude and my
[53:06] service lord
[53:08] help me to wash them of their own pain
[53:10] help me to wash them of their own
[53:12] blindness lord help me lord
[53:13] [Music]
[53:15] i think that's what love would do
[53:18] [Music]
[53:22] all right it's the very unique thought
[53:25] that overwhelms my heart how
[53:27] people sometimes have a hit list
[53:32] names of people that they don't care
[53:34] about or wouldn't bother them if this
[53:35] happened to them people
[53:37] maybe that they're convinced that
[53:38] they're not elect or convinced that
[53:40] they're this that or the other oh
[53:42] god we just we get rid of that thinking
[53:48] lord we love truth we stand by truth if
[53:51] one is a defile of the truth if one is
[53:52] an enemy to truth we're taught that that
[53:54] man
[53:55] who opposes truth and hates truth that
[53:57] that person is our enemy
[53:58] but the bible teaches us to love our
[54:00] enemies
[54:01] may we not forget the other part tonight
[54:04] lord
[54:06] just cleave to you as ruth did
[54:10] bless us tonight i pray it seals
[54:11] something necessary in our hearts and
[54:13] brings a healing
[54:14] i pray granted in the name of the lord
[54:17] jesus christ
[54:19] amen
