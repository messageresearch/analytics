TRANSCRIPT
========================================
revelations chapter 2 verses 1 to 6 unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things say of he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how that can't not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and that's born and has patience and for my namesake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i'll come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitans which i also hate amen you may be seated our subject is still um the question of what does wisdom look like and our uh subtitle or the the kind of the answer to that question that we're having using this evening is cultivating and if that seems a bit odd what does wisdom look like it's cultivating it's it's something that cultivates and so we want to expound upon that a little bit this evening i feel in my heart that we may move on from at least this naming convention of the of the services and just trying to wrap up this particular question of what does wisdom look like but by no means uh exhausting the subject but just feeling that this will kind of help round out how we have been looking at how things are complicated and it takes the wisdom of god to navigate the complications that exist in life and we've been using the wisdom from above and even this question of what does wisdom look like so that we could have principles that we can use scriptural principles very clear scriptural principles that we use to judge our thoughts so that when we're thinking something is this wisdom from above or is this wisdom from below and we can use this as a measuring stick as a as a microscope as it were to say well are my decisions are my actions are they are they measuring up with the characteristics of wisdom which is from above and so in asking what does wisdom look like we're really looking at what's the fruit of wisdom and in james chapter 3 he's using the thought even in the book of james he's looking at fruits and product and what comes forth as a means to determine whether or not someone has wisdom is there one that claims to be wise let him show it by his work let him show it by his fruits and we've used we've looked at how that wisdom is confident in being confident it's fully assured it is it means that you can be firmly trusting it's reliant it's bold and daring it's reliable and you can trust in it and last wednesday we were looking at the specific aspect of wisdom as being uh consistent which means to stand firm or to take a a take your position and to be at rest even and so what we were ending on is how that wisdom has stable footing that if you're going to make a decision and it's wisdom then you feel that you've got solid ground and it's a it's a stable place to launch from they say well god has given me this wisdom i know this is the right decision you know you have solid footing and you're willing to put your foot down or you're willing to to trust in it to rely upon it and take a firm stand because you know that this is a solid foundation wisdom gives you solid footing wisdom gives you a solid foundation it's it's that basis upon which you can act or think like this is what i'm resting on this is what i'm counting on this is wisdom so then i have confidence going forward and in having that you can be consistent and one thing that was emphasized last time that i want to carry over to tonight is how that wisdom from above is connected with the heart of god that when we we have the wisdom of god we're not just kind of mimicking his outward motions because anyone could look at somebody and just impersonate oh well he's doing this then i'm going to do this and while he's doing that i'm going to do that but wisdom is connected with the heart of god where we're not just merely impersonating but we we're demonstrating because we have the same nature and the same life and we do not want to be a church or a family or a believer in the individual sense that's merely just impersonating the attributes and characteristics of christianity but have the life and the nature on the inside so that we're demonstrating it and you could only do that you impersonate by education just learn and learn how someone talks learn how they act and there's certain mannerisms or something to where once you get the you get a certain characteristic in someone's voice then all of a sudden you could just start talking like bill clinton why because you just pick up on some little aspect and by education you can impersonate but when it comes to actually having the life when you have a revelation you demonstrate i do not impersonate aaron mcgeary i am aaron mcgeary therefore i just demonstrate what his nature is and what his character is and what his life is and so we want to be connected with the heart of god so that our actions aren't just shallow just mimicking and just doing the things that we see others doing but we understand his intent and so when we when we see the word of god and we see what the word requires revelation connects you with his intent so you're not just following the letter outwardly you'll be following the letter but inwardly you'll be connected with what he's wanting to accomplish you have the thought behind it the logos behind it and that's much more effective as the letter killeth and the spirit giveth life it's that that same emphasis that i want to know the heart of god not just so that i'm legalistic and i'm technically complying with what's required of me but i know what he's wanting i know what he wants to accomplish i see the wisdom behind why he asks sisters to dress a certain way why he requires brothers to be a certain way i know the wisdom behind it therefore it's more than just the rules that um that we see in them black and white and we were emphasizing how that stable relationships are upheld by uh and really held together and stand upon the consistency of wisdom and that's really what we're bound together as believers that's what binds us to truth and this is what's going to be effective in the relationships that we have to one another in the body of christ in the husband to wife and the parents to children the one thing that we could always strive for is a greater consistency in relationship again not resorting to just a rule a list of things to do and and list of what to say and what to do because if you have the list you can fulfill the list but yet they're not any any real connection in your heart to one another and you say well i'm doing everything that's on the list you told me you wanted me to do this you told me you wanted me to do that but there's really no connection in the heart and so stable relationships relationship we have to one another in in marriage to one another in the body of christ parent to child it's really upheld by the consistency of wisdom not the rigidity of rules not just the discipline to these are the rules these are this is the way things are done it's really connected with the wisdom and we quoted oswald chambers how that he said most of us are not consistent spiritually because we're more concerned about being consistent externally we want things to look right but really inwardly we're not right and we spend so much time trying to get the optics right and the way it looks and and and get everything done in the list or the rules and and be disciplined externally but yet all we really need to do is get consistent internally uh really tap into what the the heart is telling us and what the word of god says and catch in his heart and then once we can become spiritually consistent the rest really follows but when we're very good consistently externally uh we we get wore down externally and all of a sudden there's there's some friction and then there's some tearing down or some breach in in our actions and that's when we failed to uphold the consistency of the word so we're not concerned about being compliant externally but we're really this is the then looking at the wisdom of god it's making sure that we're consistent internally within our hearts and consistent spiritually because external compliance is shallow it's if we say beauty is skin deep you know that that's to meant to make the point that really what if your beauty beautiful outwardly that's only what's on the surface but what's inside what's lurking beneath that what's the heart of someone what's their character what's their personality really what kind of attitude they have are they are they nice are they sweet that's what's conveyed by that uh phrase that beauty is only skin deep and external compliance just getting everything to fit externally is very shallow and the goal of wisdom is not just to get the outside to look right but it's to form the correct character in someone's heart and it's to inspire the heart this works on the individual level as god deals with us he's not just trying to wash us out on the outside but he wants to inspire us in the heart as paul even writes it i want to invigorate you in the inner man i want to inspire the inner man i don't want to just give you a list of do's and don'ts and you guys got it all figured out when i show up and i visit you everything looks good on the outside his intent and his purpose was to inspire the inner man to invigorate him to motivate him and to quicken him because he knew if that guy can be motivated then the rest takes care of itself and that's the one you're motivating that's the one that you're teaching and instructing so as we are even following the trajectory of in the beginning god created a family and there's certain family dynamics that the word speaks to and there's ways that we ought to uh function as a father and as husband and his wife and his mother and his children it's not a matter of figuring out what all the rules are but it's a matter of forming the right kind of character in our hearts an inspiring heart and that's what wisdom does wisdom does that and it can be different in every situation the decision a parent makes the direction of family goes it can be different it won't move contrary to the word but the wisdom of it will be the same that this is what we're trying to produce this is what we're trying to accomplish and so tonight as we've already mentioned that wisdom what does wisdom look like cultivating it's cultivating it cultivates and it means to prepare to ra it raises it prepares it develops it produces so when we're saying it it call it's cultivating what does it look like it's it cultivates how we're looking at how even the word it comes from to teal or to labor to tend and if you just looked up a definition of cultivate it means to prepare or use prepare or use land uh primarily for crops or for gardening and that would be what we think about oh they cult they're cultivating they're working in a field they're preparing the land or they're using the land for crops and that would be the sowing of seed to produce fruit that is harvested and that is utilized but then we also say cultivate in the way that we might say cultivate a relationship or cultivate something so it's used to to speak of acquiring or developing equality a sentiment or a skill and this is what exactly what i mean by cultivating when we talk about what does wisdom look like wisdom cult is cultivating in that it produces the right results and that this really is repetitive i know for some of you are very very keen you're like well that's kind of what you've been telling us in the first five parts and so that's just what i want to tell you again that way if you only get one out of six you've got it all you've got it all but wisdom produces the right results so it's all about bringing forth good fruit and that was the emphasis we found in james chapter three a tree bringing forth fruit and the fruit of righteousness is received by those who sow in peace and so wisdom is demonstrated by the fruit that it bears so it's cultivating it prepares it it acquires it develops and it's it's chilling and it's laboring it raises up and these all the things that wisdom does so it ought to bring and produce the right kind of manifestation and that gives us a way to ask ourselves well we've been doing this do we see the fruits of it do we see the results of it in proverbs chapter 10 verse 16 it says the labor of the righteous tendeth to life the fruit of the wicked to sin so the wages or the reward of uprightness the wages or the reward the labor of upright correct behavior is something that's meaningful or beneficial the labor the righteous tend it to life it's beneficial it's meaningful it's it's good and that's what exactly what the scripture is saying the labor the fruit of righteous labor tends to life it manifests itself in meaningful beneficial things and but the fruit of the wicked is sin so there's a way that you examine conduct you is this righteous is the correct is this upright because that will tend to life it does not corrupt does not bring curse but it brings life it brings blessing and the question of what does wisdom look like and then we say that it's cultivating then we're at what are we cultivating if we look at our own spirits or our families our spouse or our children what is it we're how is it we're preparing them what is it we're sowing into them what is it we're watering what are our thoughts what are our thoughts our actions in our decisions what are they yielding you think in terms of seed is being sown seed is being watered and nurtured well let's look at the harvest of it let's look at the fruits of it and many can testify that i've noticed that whenever we do this this happens and when you notice well it just seems to be that when we allow this so we do this or this happens that it produces this particular result and that can be in a good way so have you ever noticed that when we as a family set out to do this that it always brings the right kind of attitude and it creates the right kind of spirit or whenever you fellowship with someone in particular it just leaves you in courage or maybe you go do a particular activity and you find that your spirit is revived and then there's other ways you could find that on the flip side there's things that kind of make us a little bit more agitated and frustrated and we get a little bit more irritable that's that's inspecting the fruits of something we can ask ourselves am i am i producing the right kind of crop with my thoughts with my decisions and with my actions and that's the question that's being answered is what does wisdom look like so we're asking what are we cultivating are we using wisdom to cultivate as a way of challenging ourselves whether or not we're getting the right kind of fruits now in second timothy chapter three and this is where we'll just or we're beyond our foundation now and and we're gonna build upon this the bible says in second timothy chapter 3 verse 16 that all scripture when it says all scripture that means all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness the time i'm going to give this scripture tonight does not do it justice in any way because it has so much depth but the bible says all scripture is given by theoph nustos which is the breath of god all scripture is the breath of god and it being the breath of god it has come from his inspiration his instinct this is an utterance of his thoughts and his mind and so it says that the word of god all scripture which is the breath of god is profitable that means it yields a benefit the word of god all scripture is profitable for that means it's beneficial it is useful and in luke chapter 11 verse 49 we don't have this scripture on this slide but jesus is quoting from the old testament he says therefore also said the wisdom of god i will send them prophets and apostles and some of them they shall slay and persecute so jesus when he's quoting scripture he says therefore also said the wisdom of god so read it this way all scripture is given by inspiration all scripture is the wisdom of god or the wisdom of god is given by his inspiration and the wisdom of god is profitable the word is the wisdom of god it is god's wisdom and the word then which is the wisdom of god yields a spiritual and moral benefit all scripture which is the wisdom of god is given by god's inspiration and is profitable it yields a benefit to the individual it is useful he says for doctrine it is profitable useful and beneficial for reproof for testing examination and for correction to to to correct conduct and to uh to get in step to get in line so the word of god the wisdom of god is profitable think about how useful it is it's profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction and then it says for instruction and this word instruction i know that we we could think well we know what instructions are and i just it pops in my mind now that i'm sure some of us have had that uh test before where we're we're taught from the very beginning read all the instructions first before you start taking the test and so and it's all it may be italicized at the beginning and you're always supposed to read the instructions before you start answering questions and so at some point in your academic career a teacher hands out a test and it looks like it's a list of instructions and one of them says you know raise your hand or stand up and stomp your feet and there's a list of 30 instructions and you get to the end and the last one says do all of them do not don't do any of these just turn your paper over and and be quiet and so there's a for the next 10 minutes people are standing up and stomping their feet and there's always that one person who knows read all of them first who reads silently reads all of them and then just turns their paper over and sits there quietly where everyone else is making frog noises and standing up and turning around and doing everything that's in the instructions why because they didn't they didn't learn read all the instructions first and what's the first thing we do when we open up a box an ikea box we throw the instructions away the first thing we do we just throw the instructions away because we know even if we follow them we're probably not going to get it right but that's not what these instructions are speaking of so don't get all anxious instructions we hate them but it's it means that which instruction this is what the word mean it means that which cultivates character so instruction is not just a list of rules but it's an approach it's something that cultivates character it's something that corrects mistakes and curbs our passions or increases one of the means to the word is it increases virtue so it's not just a list it's not just rules it's not just take side a and side b and do them this way and make sure the grooves are facing out but rather it's something that cultivates character and i will say this about ikea furniture if perfect character simply never made without suffering then the instructions certainly certainly do that make you suffer therefore promoting virtue so maybe i was right in the beginning or wrong in the beginning that's exactly what the ikea instructions do they promote virtue and increase character by teaching us patience and that there's never any leftover parts you've just done something wrong so that when it says that the word of god or wisdom is good for instruction it speaks of the whole training and education of a person to cultivate their morals and their thinking so it's more than just the word of god is good for telling people what to do which we like that like when we know what the word says well you know what the bible says right you know what brother branham says right and we love we love instructing that way that is not what the bible is saying when it says it's good for instruction it means whatever even the clear letter of the word is when it says thou shalt not then we have to it's knowing the application of it or the wisdom behind it in order to teach it receive it and live it that brings forth virtue and promotes character and right moral thinking such that if you ever really catch the wisdom behind an instruction you may find yourself in a situation where it may seem very very murky and the black and white isn't lining up just correct but you have tapped into the instruction of it and you have the kind of character that can benefit you in the murky areas that's what it means this instruction it's the whole training and the develop of a person's morals and their thinking and the word of god is good the wisdom of god is good for instruction or cultivating in hebrews chapter 12 verse 11 we find a different uh translation of the word instruction in second timothy it's good for instruction the same word is now used this way now no chastening so now the word instruction is used as chastening now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous amen nevertheless afterward if it's wisdom if the chasing has been uh it done it with a wisdom behind it and the appropriate kind of motive and objective even though it may not feel good in the moment real godly correction real chastening afterwards yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby have you ever used that phrase to uh to your children before you chasten them i'm going to exercise you a little bit uh this is it means when you're exercising everybody in other words you have received chastening that those who've received chastening from the lord it may not feel really good at the moment but since there's real love behind it and wisdom behind it and a goal behind it eventually it yields peaceable fruit of righteousness so it's the same word for instruction it cultivates a character and it molds somebody and instills in them the right kind of discipline and thought process and chastening does that very thing to us it is done not for just the uh not for the purpose alone of letting someone know they did something wrong but for imparting some kind of virtue or promoting some kind of virtue it teaches ephesians chapter 6 verse 4 and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath and now there's this uh contrast fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord provoke it means to bring out or to excite to induce to stimulate so parents don't stimulate anger in your children don't bring out anger in them and this is wonderful that the bible speaks to it that way it means it lets us know that we have the ability to cultivate and to produce frustration anger wrath a temper temper tantrum a fit we can produce that in our children and then we're getting the fruits of it and you're the seed sower and you're the seed water and now you're the harvester and you're the one that's eating the bread of your labor so the bible is apprising us of the reality that we can as parents bring out anger in our children or induce or stimulate frustration or anger in them so it says instead of provoking them to wrath bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord our actions our instructions our decisions can stimulate wrath or anger or frustration in our own children and it is when we see this fruit i want to say this in a very gracious way it may be the evidence of our own error and not just their rebellion because when you see a kid acting out you're like well he's stubborn and he's rebellious and he's got a mean streak in them and we start we start judging the child i mean you take a six-year-old he's just got an evil heart and uh you know he's just you know he's just bent on deceiving and causing problems and and that's that's what we say about a six or seven-year-old and we don't step back and say is this my creation have i sown these fruit am i making this child frustrated am i setting himself him up for failure and he's constantly failing and expressing his frustrations and his confusion and he's getting upset and we're the ones that are bringing it out of him and we're just real quick so you're hard-headed he's rebellious we he's our problem child that's what we say and be very very careful what you say about your children especially when they're listening because they will oftentimes just repeat what you've said about them yeah i'm the difficult one yeah i don't get it the first time or i'm the one that acts out or i'm the one that does this and we create kind of the persona that they feel they've got to live up to because we've sold those seeds with our words and so with this is us examining ourselves that maybe it's not that they are rebellious but that i'm sowing this into them and i'm bringing it out of them or maybe they may have that tendency and you're just pushing all the right buttons and bringing that out of them that's what the bible is speaking to is how that we can stimulate induce or stimulate or excite or bring out of children wrath but it says instead of doing that it says bring them up now in colossians chapter 3 verse 21 it says fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged now i i'd like to point this out that the bible says in each one of these places that children obey your parents and the lord as this is right so it gives instructions to to children to obey their parents but paul is not making that instruction in a vacuum in other words if we can have parents that will not provoke their children to anger but will bring them up in the right manner then we create a situation for our children to succeed and we're giving them the right opportunities to do things which are right and we're making ease we're making it easier on them to obey instead of making it harder pro fathers provoke not your children to anger unless they be discouraged i want to bring out the meaning of this word it means disheartened or broken in spirit and when one is disheartened and broken in spirit they are not motivated to act let alone act correctly and maybe we could just put in the simple way that they're not motivated to act correctly or they are not benefiting from the joy that ought to be produced in obedience they're not finding the satisfaction and the pride that a child would have when he does what mom or dad says he's when he said well you clean your room and they clean the room they're not they're not saying oh i i've made them proud i've done what they've said there's a conflict within their own spirit so it says fathers provoke not your children to anger in light of the fact that you will be giving them rules in light of the fact that you'll be guiding their hearts in light of the facts that you'll be the holy ghost to the for your children before they get it and especially in light of the fact that they must be obedient to the parents then parents be sure that what you're telling them to be obedient to does not provoke them to wrath be certain in the way that you're teaching them and instructing them and bringing them up that it tends to life and promotes blessing instead of cursing you can actually provoke to the wrong kind of emotional state of being the wrong kind of feelings of anger and frustration and depression and anxiety and then discourage them so that's that's the negative side fathers don't discourage your children but bring them up that means to nourish up to maturity but bring them up means bring out their potential you have been given a child a child of god this should be the confession of every single one of us if you have a child i don't care if they're 46 years old or if they're six months old that is a child of god you should look at all of them as being children of god it doesn't matter how long they've heard the message whether or not they've walked away from it look at your seed your progeny those that have been given to you and say this who i am beholding is the daughter of god this one whom i have been given is the son of god and never very from it just believe that that's what he has entrusted you in and that if someone else says well surely they would have believed the message by now say well i'm sorry they're still a child of god bring them up it means bring out their potential in other words as paul said whatever you do don't discourage your children he's saying never but actually instead of discouraging them encourage them this is what wisdom does wisdom does not break their spirit and make them useless and disheartened and unable to act or not motivated to act correctly or uh una you know and and actually acting incorrectly or if they do what's right they're doing everything they're obedient but they're depressed on the inside that's not wisdom bring them up in the nurture if i could use this word the cultivation of christ how he plants you plant how he waters you water how he prunes you prune in order to yield the kind of fruit that christ brings bring them up in the nurture bring them up in the cultivation of christ we want to instruct the way he has we want to water and nurture the way that he has we want to if necessary to prune or to dig around or to do the right things we want to do it so that we yield the right kind of fruit think about it for ourselves christ is our encourager christ is our supporter that's what he is he's your biggest fan you say i used to think that god was angry with me and christ loved me it's not god is your biggest supporter he he god i would say he wants you to succeed and that is certainly true he wants you to succeed but he also knows you're going to succeed so god never says anything to you that's going to be a detriment to you he's never trying to stop your progress he's never trying to turn you upside down and frustrate you he's your biggest fan he's your biggest supporter even when he's dissuading you he's doing it for your own benefit because he knows you can make it even when he is even when we're going through the most difficult things we feel that he's abandoned us he's sitting there saying son i would love to talk to you i would love to make my presence known to you but i know you've got this i want to teach you something about your fortitude i want to teach you something about your character you don't need me to hold your hand all the time you don't need me to always tell you what to do so i'm just kind of letting you on your own and you feel uncomfortable right now and you're getting out of your comfort zone but you're going to find out at the end of this that i'm with you every step of the way and that you're growing and you're maturing and i'm your biggest fan son hold on you got this that's how god is he never shames us he never makes us start second guessing my goodness you guys are pulling something out of me right now i i want to i want to say it and i want to say it with with grace god god is never wanting to question your ex get you to question your experience so that you would be be worse off for it be fearful and question your election and think well i gotta do this all over again i gotta do that all over again god would only make you aware of something lacking because he's given you the opportunity to make it firm and settle it not get you frustrated i guess i'm just a hypocrite i'm just gonna quit no no no you got it all wrong i'm just letting you know there's something deeper there's something greater there's something higher or you thought you had it you didn't get it son here's the handoff take it you didn't get it the first time and god he is he is encourager he he supports you he wants he knows you're going to succeed and even when we feel that we're being corrected he's doing it for your good never for your for your loss paul writes this in first thessalonians chapter 2 verse 11. and i i'd like to make this comment there is so much more in this vein and in this channel that are just i'm not even scratching the surface so if you want to in your own in your own prayer life or even in your own study of scripture just take this thought of god the encourager christ the encourager paul the encourager and how a father praises his children and you'll find the bible is so consistent from beginning to end with this paul second thessalonians chapter 2 verse 11 and says as you know how and i know it may seem a little bit disjointed because it's out of context but i just want to focus on his character his demeanor his behavior as you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father doth his children paul the messenger to the age says that we have exhorted we have comforted we have charged every single one of you as a father does his children we didn't have favorites we didn't leave anybody out we we didn't create a caste system where there were some that had certain benefits and privileges and access to wisdom and others didn't and felt like they were orphans but rather we have exhorted comforted and charged all of you as a father does his children we have exhorted that means to console to encourage and strengthen by consolation to encourage and strengthen by or to comfort we have encouraged you strengthened you we have comforted you and then he says and comforted but then the word is a little bit more deep it means to use words or to be alongside of speaking to use words if you could just imagine it means i put my arm around you and i've been there encouraging it you've got this and you're going to overcome and listen when you come into this situation be watching out for these certain things and you're going to be able to do this and this is what the scripture's painting this picture of of one who is alongside of speaking and using words to calm to encourage to console to comfort it means to address someone whether by way of admonition or incentive in order in other words to encourage or to console we have exhorted you we have comforted you each one speaks of encouraging encouragement being alongside speaking to you go go you can do this no you're able to do it don't doubt yourself just stay with what i promised charged it means to utter honorable testimony we have charged every one of you we have given a good report in other words we've praised you we've lifted you up we've built you up let me say it this way wisdom cultivates the belief in a person that they can do it when an instruction is given in wisdom something's going to be imparted with the instruction that lets the here know that they are they have authority to do it and power to do it that you're not asking them to do something that they are not that you're not confident that they can do think about how frustrating that is when we get an instruction or we're asked to do something like i can't do this there's no way in the world i can do this but god would not ask us to do something wisdom does not give some a requirement without ultimately instilling in the person i can do this wisdom instills greatness it gives grants courage it builds somebody up as you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged as a father does his children so paul says in philippians chapter 4 verses 12 and 13. i know how excuse me i know both how to be a based and i know how to abound everywhere and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need quite a contrast in abounding and suffering to be full and to be hungry to be a base and to abound he's bringing up these contrasts and this is what paul is referring to when he says i can do all things through christ with strengthen of me we use that phrase all the time and we're usually using it in the thought i can jump leap over a wall i can run through a troop i can leap over a wall i can tunnel through a mountain i can fly over it and we think we only think of these supernatural things i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me and that means you would know how to be happy when you're hungry and when you're full it means you you can you know how to be a base and to be abound when he says i can do all things through christ it doesn't just mean that i know how to succeed wonderfully but it shows i know how to conduct myself in adversity i know how to keep my head up through the the lack of things when i'm wanting i know that i can make it through christ which strengthens me so it speaks to the sufficiency of christ but i want you to notice that paul is saying hey whether i'm abounding or whether i'm a base whether i'm full or whether i'm hungry whether i'm suffering in a need or whether i'm abounding he's saying that i can make it i've got this i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me he strengthens me he's the strength giver he's my supporter paul is coming from a place of confidence which has been cultivated by christ paul could not have said this if he wasn't trusting christ paul could not have said this is like well i remember that one time he told me to do this and it didn't work out so paul had this absolute trust he just knew that this is gonna work out and even to where he's like hey stay on the boat this is the only way you're gonna make it he just knew he could trust him and so when paul speaks this he's coming from a place that christ has cultivated within his spirit i can do all things through christ with strengthen me this means that his heavenly father had brought paul to such a place of rest that he could believe he could do it whatever he was asked i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me this means as christ who has given us the model behavior or given us these instructions that we're ought to pursue christ is as we're to raise our children in the nurture and admonition of the lord this is the cultivation of christ where we can be producing confidence in one another strength and sureness and security and we do this by promoting the right kind of things first timothy chapter 1 verse 12 and i thank christ jesus our lord who hath enabled me too often i think we use the word enabler in the negative context where you're just enabling them you're just enabling them you're just enabling them well okay we realize that there's a dark side of enabling but paul is saying my god christ jesus our lord has it's the same word strengthened but i love the way that it's translated he has enabled me he has made me able he's loosed me he's given me liberty he's given me confidence he's he's given me this courage to believe he's asked me to do it you know by golly i can do it i've got i can handle this i can take what's coming my way and i can and i can make it through this oh thank christ jesus our lord who hath enabled me and i love this for that he have counted me faithful this is in the enabling he has enabled me counted me faithful where are we putting that in in her own works no in the fact that he's enabled me putting me oh this is so beautiful paul as a minister of the gospel says he's enabled me in that in that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry i have been called and nurtured and i have been encouraged by christ not that he just gifted me and said well let's see how you handle this bub but he has enabled him he has counted him he has put me he's the one that's over he is the one that's looked out after this this is the cultivation of christ this is what wisdom looks like this is the nature and the characteristic of christ so in revelations chapter 2 we're going to read from verses 1 to 6 don't everyone turn in your bibles at one time the sound is just deafening i don't do do people turn in their bibles anymore and no one wants to answer and people just start doing this real quick i'm not angry it's okay no you don't have to turn your bibles i put it up there for a reason revelations chapter two now follow this we're going to read to verse six unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things sayeth he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand how is he characterized he's characterized as the almighty he is the faithful there's different ways that he is referred to in the scripture under the angel the church of ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks this is christ we know in the midst of his church he is now something is being written to the angel of that church and i want you to notice how brother brown i haven't put these statements on a slide so we're just going to read through them very quickly this is christ in the midst of his church and in light of the fact that we are told as parents to to raise our children to bring them up in the cultivation of christ and that paul says that he hath enabled me and he strengthened me and i have exhorted and comforted and charged you as a father does his children this scripture gives us some essential characteristics and attributes of how that christ what he's actually doing in the midst of the church he's not in the midst of the church as an auditor hmm let's see here who's messing up who's not doing well but brother man says the only light they have this is the church is his light even the messengers how dark it is how spiritually cold yet when he comes into the midst it is light and warm and the church is empowered and through him does the works that he did so he is in the midst of the church as the empowerer he's empowering this is what the presence of christ does he empowers he is the uh we have the branches he is the vine the vine furnishes energy to the branches to be fruitful it's he is not we are not the branches and he's the vine so that we live our whole lives going right looking over our shoulders is he going to cut me off but no he furnishes energy to the branches the church is empowered he says later and not only in their midst as a complacent onlooker or as a recording angel so he's not in the midst just kind of looking down with the furrowed brow like oh what are these guys doing these these knuckleheads they need to get their act together he's not just a recording angel oh wow you're going to hear about this later he says but there he stands expressing exactly what he is the life and sustainer and giver of all good gifts to the church he's not only your life but he's a sustainer and he's a giver god is a giver a sustainer he's an empowerer he's a sustainer he's a giver of good gifts this is what he is in the midst as he walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks these are characteristics and attributes of christ whom we are modeling his behavior he's an empowerer he's a sustainer he's a giver bill graham says but with him in her midst with him in her midst with him motivating her she becomes to the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all and it thundered when he spoke but with him in the midst and with him motivating her she becomes the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all testing one two we good all right see devil you can't stop this if it's not the devil if it's just sennheiser or countryman or whatever it is what whatever equipment we're sure wait we're we're not taking sides here in this don't want to offend anybody but we go forward this is what christ is he's the empowerer he's the sustainer he's the giver with him in her midst motivating her he's a motivator we all know what it's like to not be motivated and the worst is when you have zero motivation and you don't know why that's really what depression is as you get zero motivation zero ambition and you can't figure out why you just feel broken you feel unable but christ is a motivator he empowers he sustains he gives he motivates he doesn't he doesn't break our spirits where we feel unable and we feel discouraged and man this message just seems so hard to live and my goodness how am i ever gonna make it there's just something about the word no matter how high it's preached when it's him you're like i can do it i know i know i can do it i don't know how and i don't know when but i know somehow we're gonna make it did you hear that the preacher was preaching that the mark of this age is perfection and i know i'm not perfect but somehow someway i know that christ is gonna enable me to meet the mark not walking away and say well i just must not be good enough and i must need to get baptized again or maybe i don't have the holy ghost or maybe i'm not elect maybe i'm just foolish virgin and listen there's ministries and there's relationships and there's people that'll work very very hard to make you feel broken and that they're the only ones that can fix you so that you always stay real needy at their side and you're always subject to their ministry listen the the statement that the bride is the sickest body that he knew of was right then but she's begun to be risen she's risen the vitamins have been poured into the church you you can make it you're strong enough uh this isn't a peptide you're smart enough you're good you're gonna make it no this is just the reality of it god has built you to win motivating you not discouraging you don't you hate it when you come to church and you know you're actually excited to come to church and you just drag yourself away thinking well i guess i'm just no good and just been beat up and bullied that's not christ so he says in verse 2 i know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and that's born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted what's amazing is christ the empowered the sustainer giver the motivator the life says i know your works i it's not even listen you're nothing without me okay the only reason why you even have an ounce to be able to bear those that are evil or can't bear them they even the only way that you've tried the apostles is because i'm in you doing all this to begin with so don't you for a minute begin to brag this is the motivator this is the sustainer this is the giver this is the empower saying i know your works and your labor and your patience how you can't bear them which are evil you've tried them which say they're apostles and they're not and you've found you found them to be liars and you've borne you've borne you've had patience from my name you've labored you haven't fainted this is christ giving praise to the believer this is not him saying you're nothing without me this is not him leading with their sins and his complaint but this he's building them up he's beginning by affirming his love he's showing them that he's committed he's actually this is the source of their motivation wow you've done wonderful you're doing great you've borne this you've borne that this is christ praising his own this is demonstrating to us a good example brother branham tells a story in a couple places where he says one night i was going out of the church and someone said oh brother branham i sure appreciated that sermon and i said thank you and somebody's standing at the door minister he said this is some time ago minister said well bless god i don't want nobody telling me that i wonder if he just never heard that right so he's like well i don't need it you know he's just because he doesn't ever hear it he says well bless god i don't want nobody to tell me that that's certainly not gentleness wouldn't he say yeah you know what brother random i enjoyed that too that was really good he said i want all the glory to go to god so someone says brother branham i sure appreciated that sermon this other mister well bless god i don't want nobody telling me that i want all the glory to god glory to go to god brother man says well it does and while i like it myself i really like it amen and he said i have to be truthful and he said well i don't like for people to say that about me bless god and i said there's just one difference between me and you i'm honest about it and you're not so think about that this is this is the context for what he's about to say if you take a little child brag on him a little he'll do a better job if they're not doing a good job making their bed instead of saying you call that maid they're teaching monkeys to read and you can't even make your bed i'll never forget the first time i ever heard that i was really funny and it wasn't my dad telling me that if some of you are thinking that but that doesn't motivate the kid to get out of bed the next morning and make the bed right he said why don't you just have a monkey do it because you kind of cultivated this attitude you're horrible you can't do it he says all you've got to do is take a little child brag on him a little he'll do a better job that's right and god always he likes to tell his children when he does right you like to tell them when they're doing wrong so why not tell them when they're doing right wisdom this is wisdom we're always very quick to point out when things are not done right and how things are not done well and where things are short and where things aren't good and you don't do this and you don't do that and i asked you to do this and you didn't do that and i asked you this and didn't do that and the wisdom is that you can actually get the right result not by telling them that they're doing it wrong but maybe humbling yourself to say that is so good you tried so hard try it again or tomorrow when you do it just do it this way and this is something that's you're empowering you're sustaining you're motivating with you as a motivator things can get done he likes to tell his children god always likes to tell his children when they do right he always does and if we are in the mode in the habit of telling people when they do wrong why not tell them when they're doing right brother brown says in the message jehovah jireh daddy used to make me work twice as hard as i would done because he told me i was doing a good job how did his dad motivate him to work twice as hard not by telling him he was soft not by telling him he was lazy not by telling him he was no good and he can't get it through his thick head what he told him is you're doing a good job and he'd be motivated to work twice as hard so we all like that that's what he says so we all like that we like to be told and then i do appreciate good friendly criticism when someone says now you made a mistake there you did something then i know i'll try to straighten that up i always admire criticism don't you come on now you believe the message huh you believe him to be a prophet i always admire criticism don't you next slide when it's in the right that's when we admire it when it's in the right spirit when it's in the right motive and objective when it's in the right from above we actually enjoy the criticism when someone's like hey hey there's a better way you're doing a great job but did you notice you're not quite getting it done right we appreciate that when you make a mistake you did you made a mistake there you did something then i know i'll try to straighten up i always admire criticism when it's in the right don't you yes when it's in the right see if you're doing something wrong you don't wish to be that way someone said well i would have told you but i well sure if you're my brother you should tell me i want to know it don't you like it when people say listen if i'm doing something wrong you can just come tell me what you don't think i can hear it huh you don't trust me you don't think i'm gifted you're like no absolutely i can't wait to ask your advice and brother branham means that he's saying hey if if i'm your brother you should tell me i want to know it brother ben i'm always in the right kind of spirit solicited constructive criticism he said listen tell me if i'm your brother if i do something wrong you're obligated to come tell me he even said about his trustees he says i don't want a bunch of yes men on my board i've got you there because i know that if you disagree with me you'll tell me that's why you're there they're not there to be bobble heads yes on everything that they said and everything that's done no i want to know is this right is this good how do you feel solicit from the people whether or not this is tending to righteousness tending right i always admire criticism when it's right i want to come back to what he's saying if you're my brother you'll tell me and he's saying the right kind of approach will promote the right kind of result because i would work twice as hard when my daddy said i was doing a good job is what christ does christ says i know your works you're doing a good job i know your labor your patience you can't bear them that are evil you've actually tried apostles and you discovered that they weren't apostles you've labored you've been patient you've been heavy laden for my name's sake you have labored and you have not fainted you were doing good what did he do he affirmed his pleasure in them he praised them he exhorted them he comforted them he was in the midst of them with his arm around him lifting up these virtues what is it this is wisdom how that you could take someone and brag on them a little and they'll do a better job he likes to tell his children when they've done right you'll work twice as hard because you're told you're doing a good job we like to be told we like people who who not only share criticism but people who can praise us too and then verse four nevertheless i have somewhat against thee let me just point this out he doesn't lead with this they wouldn't even be in the right frame of my mind to really get the praising and the compliments you're really doing horrible i mean you're like on the verge of becoming antichrist but great good job by the way it just there was this is the wisdom of christ the cultivation of christ to affirm his love first his commitment to lift them up and praise them and exhort them and comfort them and then once they're in this position of confidence that he's still interested he's still mindful he's still instructing this is her sometimes insecurities are bred and the way that we address situations or confront problems is the person's afraid that this is a deal breaker does this mean things have changed and and nothing's going to be the same again and things are turned upside down i need to know first that we're do we're engaged in this exercise because you still believe in me like about come in the office and be like oh no what's going on like and you want to you want to know first hey look you're doing a great job we're going to give you a raise and and we want to keep you on we want to extend your contract but going forward we need you to do this that and the other if you led with you know what um you need to do this you need to do that you need to do this you need to do that puts that person in a state of well am i out of here are they done with me are they upset with me so now he says nevertheless i have somewhat against thee this is on the backdrop of the praising of verse verses two and three because thou has left thy first love so this is some very heavy criticism remember therefore so this is his complaint you've left your first love so he doesn't just say he just drop the mic and leave and say that'll burn he follows it up with remember therefore from where you've fallen and repent and do the first works he's telling them a way back this is the wisdom of it you're doing great you've done this you've done that these things have all done well but there's just one little problem you've left your first love and then he says now all you need to do is repent remember your first works or else i'll come unto thee quickly and now he's saying hey there's a consequence for not doing it these are all parts and elements of the cultivation of christ and i will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent so there's a call to action there's a consequence if you don't follow it but it's not arising in a vacuum it's not just a dm that says hey you are messing up buddy and there's consequences for it it's look you're doing a good job this is an area you can improve if you don't improve these are the consequences and then he follows it right back up with but this thou hast another attaboy another another confirmation another affirmation that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitans which i also hate he ends it with another affirmation is this wisdom some of us thinking man i wish this is the way i was treated my whole life and this is exactly how that we ought to treat others this paradigm where it's not jealousy and we're not embittered and we're not mad and we're not trying to shame and we're not trying to uh you know we're not using the wrong kind of motivators to get the response this is how christ deals with the church knowing where it's going to end up this is how he addresses the situation through praise through accolades through encouragement through addressing the problem giving a solution the consequence if they don't and then saying you're doing good this is another thing i like reaffirming it in wisdom the rebuke come came after the affirmation therefore the rebuke of the correction builds up it doesn't tear down because they've already put them they've already put them in the frame of mind that they can trust that this is a trusting relation this is love that that there's an effort being made to provo promote the relationship there's an interest in how i'm behaving there's a desire to see the kind of correct behavior this just isn't going to shame me or make me feel bad for not meeting the mark but there's it's with this backdrop of all this affirmation that he corrects and gives a very stern rebuke and then says hey if this doesn't happen then this is the consequence for it therefore the very stern very stern rebuke promotes the right kind of virtue and doesn't just take away and make bear it actually builds up brother of adam says this as my closing my closing statement in referring specifically to these verses how beautifully the savior praises and commends his children he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior he knows that there's weakness among them but as yet he does not cry out against it isn't that just like the lord he knows there's weakness he knows things aren't doing aren't being done right he knows there's room for improvement he knows there's actually pretty terrible disobedience he knows that this first step away is the the effect of the antichrist but brother i'm saying he knows there's weakness he knows their sin he knows there's compromise but he doesn't lead with it he doesn't confront it right out coming against it and he says isn't that just like our lord in other words the nature of christ isn't to come with sleeves rolled up and and a whip and a whatever else you say i'm going to get in your face and i'm going to tell you you're doing things wrong said that's not the nature of christ isn't that just like our lord when we've left our first love he affirms our love to us to make it easier to come back to it how many times have the efforts to kind of bring us back only push us further away because we weren't sure we were being invited to what we wanted to begin with how beautifully the savior praises and commends his children taking full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behaviors before he rebukes and before he corrects him he gives him this praise isn't that just like our lord and then he says he knows how to encourage us in the right matters and discourage us in the wrong manners pay very close attention it doesn't mean on one hand he knows how to encourage us and on another hand he knows how to discourage us no there is no discouragement in christ there is only christ discouraging us from acting wrong he knows how to encourage us he does encourage us in the right matters he does discourage us from doing the wrong things is exactly what's expressed in revelations chapter 2 verses 1 to 6 is christ encouraging us to keep doing things right and then discouraging us from doing the things that we're doing wrong and through that even though there's correction there's no discouragement that proceeds from it not only does he know how but he does encourage us he does discourage us just to use the words that i place in the beginning this is cultivating he's the encourager he's the one that is alongside of us using words to bring out of us the gold that's in us to bring out of us his nature and his life i know what's on the inside of you i know it's in there i know how to get it out and then in that context he says now whatever you do don't do this that's not trying to break your heart that's strengthening your heart that's not breaking your spirit that's perfecting your spirit and then he says we could all learn notice he says we could all learn a good lesson right here in it running the church and our families i really feel that this this is so important that if you don't if you're not able to write it down i'll email it to you i want you to read this i want you to see this i want you to know that this is what it says we can email you the slide deck he knows how to encourage us in the right matters how to discourage us in the wrong matters this wisdom is how what we can use in running the church and running our families listen and he says better still we could all learn a good lesson in that god deals with each one of us in exactly this way this is how he deals with each one of us as an encourager as a motivator as a sustainer as a giver as a champion he's your champion he's in your corner he's praising you oh no no don't do that that's not gonna work that's that's instructive that's that's corrective yes it is but this is coming from a heart that loves you and wants to see you do well this is where brother says we admire criticism when it's in the right christ gives the right kind of criticism because it's promoting the right kind of virtues so we are in the we want to emphasize this to you as individual sons and daughters of god that this is a lesson that we ought to learn that god deals with us by encouraging us to do the right things and then discouraging us from the wrong things that's wisdom that brings out the right kind of fruit that's what wisdom does it's cultivating he says we could all learn a good lesson right here in how we run the church and how we run our families let me say this just as i speak from my heart you who are seeking answers you will find them you'll find them and we're here to support you and encourage you and give you the resources and the confidence to find them not just give you all the answers because you'll find him why you're his son you're his daughter you've been given a responsibility you'll find the answers that you need don't despair they'll come in time we're here as a body of christ we each one of us are here not to give everybody the answers but to help them find them we're not here to give you a list of rules of do's and don'ts that we think if you just do these you'll you'll come out right on the other side there's certain things that are very clear prescriptions in the word of god that we teach that we preach but we're all aware as we're maturing believers that there's areas in life where we seek the wisdom of god we want an answer we want to know what to do right i'm telling you you'll find it these things i'm sharing are things that you can use to find them you can utilize them all the days of your life and this is a good lesson be a motivator be an encourager be a cultivator of the right things encourage one another provoke one another unto love into good works how are we gonna do that by shaming people and making them feel that if they don't dress right that they're going to be ostracized by shaming people into worship by shaming people and do you feel that you better told the line better do what everybody else is doing no by making someone feel the love of god enough where they can just be who they are in christ and just bring out the gold you are i if i could just say this give me something i'm sitting on a literal gold mine here spiritual gold we're all go we're all gold miners it's there and i believe that god can bring it out of you and that's what wisdom does it cultivates and i believe that's what you can all be as cultivators god bless you let's stand this evening i feel the love of god with us tonight musicians please come i feel he's very near to us i believe that god has encouraged you tonight just like he does he's encouraging you he's your champion we use that phrase maybe to express that someone has conquered something but he's your champion and that he's championing you [Music] that's the nature of god that's what i want to have in my life i think that's what we should aspire to in our own lives is to be encouragers be motivated to inspire others especially in our own families if in the beginning god created the family and in the end of the beginning it's complicated and what we need is not so much a list of technical rules and standards and things that we can do but primarily and most of all what we need is wisdom wisdom that cultivates [Music] wisdom that's consistent wisdom that's confident with our heads bowed tonight i encourage each one of you just to express your love back to god thank him [Music] praise him [Music] for always being the empowerer the enabler the sustainer the giver your head's bowed think about those times in your life where you despaired and you don't know how but somehow you persevered who was that your motivator that was your love for christ motivating you enabling you picking you up encouraging you yes we realize there's times when god has chastised us and did the chastening but the chastening with wisdom was bookended by praise and affirmation such that in the end it yielded the peaceable fruit of righteousness that only his chastening can bring i'd like to confess tonight as a man that i have not always exercised wisdom in my relationships but tonight lord i want this instilled in me that i could lead with motivation lead with inspiration lead with encouragement before i discourage from something there's one thing that we can always do as parents as spouse as brother and sister we can always work on our relationships it's one thing we can always do i encourage you to do that with heads bowed we're praying our gracious heavenly father lord there's so much we can share from our hearts now so much that we could express we're overwhelmed by your presence right now lord [Music] maybe an observer would say well then why isn't there weeping and shouting and why isn't that the manifestation of certain gifts it's just not what you're motivating us to do right now for i believe if you were desiring to enable us to speak with tongues that we would be speaking with tongues if you desired to motivate us to motivate us to praise and exultation that we would be doing it but lord we have been so overwhelmed with your love we're like that iron that has been beat with the axe cut by the saw has now been enveloped by fire we just find ourselves melting into you feeling such a strong love [Music] we're getting our breath back we're getting our confidence back that zealand enthusiasm we felt when we first began to serve you it feels so much better now than it's ever felt before because now it's with wisdom now it knows there's heart trials ahead now it knows the foolishness of self-pride lord it's just it's not it's not even within reach lord it's within us and i thank you for this deposit of yourself that you've placed inside of us and the fact that you would praise us that we've done a job well when we know it's you both in us to will and to do of your good pleasure that you still praise us and lift us up and strengthen us and encourage us lord may we have eyesight to see what wisdom is and to act according to wisdom which is from above that is confident consistent cultivating that we might see it at work in our lives i say thank you lord i say thank you jesus thank you father i commit these people to you bless them i pray as we are dismissed soon go with us in this midweek service in the lateness of this hour make your presence known lord in the name of the lord jesus christ i pray amen amen praise him
