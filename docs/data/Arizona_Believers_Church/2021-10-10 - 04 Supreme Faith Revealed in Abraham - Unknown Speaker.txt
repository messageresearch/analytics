TRANSCRIPT
========================================
genesis chapter 22 verses 1 to 10 i'm very um excited about the word of the lord this morning and i'm just not sure where where to stop i know where to start but i was told the gift is stopping so we'll find out where this gift is at and its maturity but um i'm just not sure which direction to go because it's like everything's wide open and even this morning as i was just pondering whether or not i should change my notes and take away or add to and which direction to go i felt just to leave it where it was yesterday and so i expressed that now just to say that just to appreciate your attention and real focus because i'm just trying to lay a foundation on this thought of supreme faith revealed in abraham and as we mentioned wednesday night i'm kind of coming to uh then what i thought would be the end or the goal i'm bringing it forward now and dealing with it at the outset so we can look at how abraham's faith culminated and how it climaxed and how that's instructive to us specifically in the end time in this third exodus in this rapture season and then and then back up and just look at his life even beginning with things in genesis chapter 11 and walk through 12 13 14 15 17 see i know how to count and and go all the way through to genesis 22 and realize wow you know when you look at abraham's life he didn't always live on top of mount moriah he didn't always receive god veiled in flesh at his tent door every morning you look at his life and you take it and hold you realize wow i can relate to abraham's faith because i'm walking in the same pattern today and what his faith culminated in there's a promise for you to do the same thing and that's kind of our thesis statement there and we trust that we could just even though there might be some repetition i trust it'll be a blessing to you genesis 22 verse 1 and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am and again it's important to note that this temptation of abraham is not in the same way that satan tempted tempts mankind we know that god does not tempt man to sin so he says and he said take now thy son thy only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of we're just going to take a little bit of time as we read this to reinforce these things this mariah it's a place chosen by jehovah and then as he does so often with abraham he speaks to him and he has to act according to what has been disclosed but then there's still more to unfold he says you have to you have to walk in this and then i'll show you the mountain so he couldn't sit around waiting for the specific mountain to be disclosed he had to begin and initiate this process and then he would tell him of one mountain in particular that he needed to come to and it's in that mountain that we find that the temple of uh that solomon built is uh is located he says and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and claimed the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went under the place of which god had told him then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they both of them they went both of them together and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar this was a specific place disclosed by revelation where he went to build this altar builds an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood just that scene being described in such uh i'd say just clean language just so matter of fact i mean if any one of you said yeah we built an altar in the backyard today and bound our oldest son and put him on it i mean that's shocking but we read this and it just seems so you know so particularly very straightforward but that had to be such a tremendous scene and it never speaks of isaac saying anything and i i could even with conjecture think that that may have been exactly what happened as isaac said where's the lamb where's the offering and abraham said god will provide it and then isaac never opens his mouth again to object and how could we conject that because christ did the same thing as the sheep was done before his shears he he went and he allowed himself to be offered up as a sacrifice and that so that statement to me is so profound it says and abraham stretched forth his hand so now it's not just him dilly dallying with isaac upon the altar abraham stretches forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son god bless you you can be seated if i've left anybody in suspense it's in verse 11 that the lord stops them and isaac is not slain but then there's a ram in the thicket we're looking at supreme faith when we talk about supreme faith just using some principles here in the outset that we'll be reviewing and actually maybe for well i'll just say this this entire service is just laying putting another layer of paint or coat of paint upon what we've already ministered already so a lot of repetitive scriptures and themes but yet i believe it'll be deeper more colorful and so supreme faith when we look at it is rapturing faith i want you to see it as a rapturing faith or we could say perfect faith and this isn't to take any faith that has been exhibited in prior ages or any or the faith that we presently have and try to diminish it or demean it or say that it's not faith uh but we're talking about the faith that god gives us reaching its climax or meeting the mark that god has set for the age in that if there's a promise for the age god's faith brings this faith that god gives you comes to its realization and comes to the fulfillment of what has been promised and we see that perfect faith is that faith for the moment that's promised in this hour and another way that i've been pondering it is supreme faith rapture faith perfect faith it's also the supreme expression of gentile faith because the faith that we're coming to is not the perfection of a judaic faith or not the perfection of the faith and expectation of the natural seed of abraham but our faith is to be the supreme expression of the gentile faith and we see that gentile faith spoken of even in the ministry of christ who said i haven't seen a faith like this anywhere and what was it was the faith of the gentile to take god at his word and this kind of faith when we talk about rapturing faith or perfect faith um gentile faith it is a faith that is misunderstood and it's misunderstood not uh necessarily by the evil efforts of certain people or our ignorance our lack of sincerity it's just very easy to misunderstand faith which in itself is mysterious that you don't can't necessarily grasp it open it up and figure it out but it's something that god gives us and there's an element to it that always remains outside of our natural grasp and so faith can be easily misunderstood when we talk about gentile faith versus may the jewish faith and jewish traditions versus gentiles taking them out of his word there's a way that you can begin to make things compete and god's word never competes with itself and you have to take things in order and the way that god builds and structures things together and so this kind of faith can be very misunderstood and the way to this faith can seem impassable like here i am with the faith that i have now and i find myself getting frustrated i find myself doubting i find myself i can't hardly believe for a good day at work let alone a body change and it can be very discouraging to think how in the world am i going to have perfect faith to change this body when i find it really hard just to uh change my clothes or clean the house or whatever it might be that we find ourselves struggling with sometimes this is this is just being very natural with our language really this perfect faith that we speak of can seem uh too mysterious and out of reach and unable to obtain and the inspiration has been the supreme faith revealed in abraham when we cons we we accept that he's the father of faith and he's this luminary of believing god and taking god at his word and he became young again and his wife's womb was brought back to life to receive to have a son and he he met god at his tent door and he went and took his servants and slayed five kings and you read all these stories about abraham and we think oh my now that's a faith that um is never going to be achieved again but if you take a look at his life even chronologically or you just start looking at it and thinking more about what's happening and what events would have intervened during this time and not just taken these uh these glimpses into his life as being the way uh that every day he was conquering kings and every day elohim was meeting them for lunch for a lamb sandwich and look at what his life was like you can identify more with them and realize its way to rapture in faith is much more simple than maybe we think it is and his faith i want to use his faith as an example of rapturing faith and we've used this statement a number of times brother branham said and one day when god seen that his servant was determined to be an example for people of today and in this determination we know that god had set abraham to be an example of the of the children of faith and believers and and the example of the children of god so abraham is the father of faith so he is the the example person be dear followers of me as he says as a child follows his father so father the father of our faith sets an example it's god who had determined abraham to be an example not just for all the children of god but for people today so abraham was determined by god he had a determination he had a perseverance but he's also determined and set by god to be an example of the end time believer and the question that we're posing is wow how what was it about his life that speaks to us in terms of a a rapturing faith and in james chapter 2 verses 21 and 22 he's pointing to genesis chapter 22 and he says was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar now james writes a statement that if you're that is very striking and seems to contradict paul's message that we are justified by faith and not by works and this is paul addressing the judaic tradition and circumcision and righteousness by the law he's saying the works of all never made a man righteous but it was abraham's faith in god and it was his faith alone that god imputed righteousness to him so now if we now we look at james side abraham believed god and by his faith righteousness is imputed to him but now james is looking at the practical outworking of genuine faith in a believer's life and he's saying that abraham now is vindicated and justified by his works in other words his works proved that he had a faith that imputed to him righteousness it's not it's not saying i'm holy i'm holy i'm holy and everyone looks at you and says are you talking about your pants because those only holes i see right you don't see the holiness you don't see you don't see a life that exemplifies holiness so this is uh this is james saying that abraham was he not justified by works when the works of offering isaac up as a sacrifice and he says see see us thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect and he's asking the questions see don't you see that by works was faith made perfect so we take this statement and we see that by faith that faith is where a works is faith expressed and that faith was made perfect or his faith reached its supreme expression when he offered up isaac as a sacrifice so there's a daily life of faith and there's expressions of faith there's instances of faith but then there's this ultimate expression where it's like okay well that was the ultimate he believed god he followed god he obeyed and even the language of god in genesis chapter 22 says now i know that you love me you kind of look back and say uh wouldn't you think the time that he began left er till now he had been proving but it was more this perfection of love and what begins in faith ends in the capstone of perfect love and you see this in abraham's life that what began in faith and faith is tied and connected together with love it reaches its full and supreme expression and it's something that was indivisible and something that couldn't be torn down something that couldn't be argued with and there was something expressed as an ultimate in his faith when he offered up his son so when we see that this is identified in the scriptures the supreme expression of abraham's faith how is this supreme faith an example of end time rapturing faith and if you listen if you were here wednesday night or listen to wednesday night we kind of really we came to this and went over this in great detail how that abraham's faith that we're calling supreme faith is an example of a rapturing faith that the bride has at the end time and and so and again i'm not i'm not repeating myself though i'm dealing with the same the same theme abraham's faith was not bound within this natural dimension and so abraham was not uh his faith did not merely exist or was resting upon things that we existed within light time and matter so he's not he's not looking at things seen and saying oh i can believe that and oh i can see that and and and it won't even go on by natural experience because tonight we could all make this bold prediction that the sun's going to come up in the morning and it wouldn't take faith right we wouldn't it wouldn't take much uh gift of prognostication to predict that the sun's gonna rise in the morning so really difficult to say that that's faith that's just experience that tells us that and so abraham's faith was not tied to the rising of the sun and the changing of the seasons and and by anything that would exist within light time and matter it was beyond natural time the things that abraham believed in and trusted were beyond the physical flesh remember how he's referred to as abram the hebrew and this this appellation this title of the hebrew it means one from beyond or one who's crossed over now to those in the time in that day that gave them the the the title or the nickname the hebrew they might have meant it as just some descriptive this guy came from beyond there and he came from the chaldeans and he's a little bit different talks a little bit differently he lives a little bit differently and so they might have called him the hebrew as one who crossed over and they might have had their own reasons but he's given this and it's preserved in scripture to speak about the testimony of abraham that as the hebrew he's one from beyond he's one who's crossed over so he's no longer just existing within this natural realm he's no longer bound by things um that can be seen and touched and felt he's living by faith and he's looking beyond the natural he's crossed over in hebrews chapter 11 verse 10. it says for he looked for a city which have foundations when he says have foundations it means permanent and then the permanence is now qualified as eternal whose builder and maker is god abraham this scripture tells us that abraham was searching for the eternal future home now this is i'm glad it's in the bible and this just isn't me trying to come up with a retrospective on abraham but he looked for a city and whose builder and maker was god this is abraham's faith now is visionary and he's looking for the future home there's something about his faith something about the quality of the things that have been revealed to him that he's already looking for the new jerusalem before jerusalem even exists it says in romans chapter 4 verse 17 as it is written i have made the father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and call it those things which be not as though they were this could be said of god even god who calleth those things which be not as though they are that god could speak things and call things as if they exist even though they don't exist but this is also expressive of abraham's faith who could say and speak things even though they didn't exist he could speak in sp as if they already did as if they would be so but it's because he believed in god so this is uh this is the thrust and the emphasis that i'm taking again this morning abraham's actions in genesis chapter 22 him being able to take his son isaac laid the wood in order bind his son lame upon the altar and bring the knife back to kill his son and to shed the blood of his son in obedience to god's command who says abram get the up go to the land of mariah to a specific mount that i'm going to show you and offer up your son your only son whom you love almost as if god's rubbing it in and offer him to me as a sacrifice abraham's actions in genesis chapter 22 testified of his revelation of the nature of god that it's we shouldn't we shouldn't and i want to be very careful the way i express this and again this is kind of a an outflow from a progression from blind trust bad faith that when we look at what abraham's doing let's not dumb it down to think that abraham was just oh you want me to kill my son i'll kill my son because sometimes i believe that as since we're we use this title as believers and we become such ardent believers that we become gullible or we become believers without bases and we just accept things because somebody said it and because we hear it through a certain uh from a certain place and it works it begins to work against us because abraham's faith was not just oh you want me to do this i'll do this this is we're looking at genesis chapter 22 where he understood what he was doing this is in genesis chapter 12 this is genesis chapter 22. and brother branham said that we've got to move up to supreme faith and he says we've got to move up to a faith to a supreme faith and he says and to do that you have to know perfectly what you're doing so you're looking at a maturing and a growing from faith taking god at his word and you trust him and then what does he do he does exactly what he says and then he says something again and you trust him he does exactly what he says and then what you should begin to do is begin to understand the nature of god and this is what we do with our children our children are not taught to just do what mom and dad say our children are taught that what mom and dad say to do have a reason behind it and there's a wisdom associated with it that through repetition and discipline by a certain time in a certain age they begin to understand the wisdom behind the instructions they begin to understand wisdom behind the parameters wisdom behind the correction wisdom behind the the standard within the home and then they can take the character and wisdom of that and when your dad says hey son do this he's like i know exactly what you mean when you say that i know i know the thought behind it i know the motive behind it i know what you expect from it i know why you're asking me to do it and it's not just this yes sir if you say jump i say how high i'm going to do whatever you tell me and let's let's just be honest that's how some churches are run right i'm the boss you do what i say and don't and don't question but that's not how even god is it's not even how god is it's not what god desires with with his children as he wants us and i mentioned that because there's dynamics that we can grow up and whether it be households or churches or religions or certain cults where that's kind of the mindset that we're under when it comes to following god and god wants you to understand he wants you to know he wants you to know his heart and have an intimate personal relationship with him brother was sharing with me recently that even his entire walk with the lord that in some ways god was just some kind of construct that he could view the world through but over the last year or so that he's become personal to him realizes no this is an intimate relationship where this is a person and it completely transforms everything it changes the way that we relate to god's word when we take it in that personal way and so abraham's actions in genesis chapter 22 are testifying of his revelation of the character of god it speaks to his understanding of the nature of god to where it's that he he wakes up in the morning and god speaks to him and tells him to sacrifice his son or god speaks to him in the evening hey take my son and sacrifice him abraham is it's even though it's not recorded he he just he just acts as if this would have been a common occurrence like oh yeah i knew this was coming but instead of instead of just painting abraham and i know i'm really emphasizing instead of painting abraham as just a yes man who's just going to do whatever anything that god said and he was just so obedient he just did whatever he was said he's now coming from the standpoint of trusting the lord and seeing a pattern on a daily routine of following the plan of god he'd come to a place to know that there was more intended and meant in this request than just the mirror following through with the activity because it says here that he believed and he believed in whom he believed before him whom he believed abraham is the father of many nations and he believed god and this is the this is how paul writes it who quickens the dead notice he believes in a god who gives life to the dead so this is this is part of abraham's understanding of the nature and character of god when he trusts god to go take his son upon the altar he believes in a god who gives life to the dead now in this prophecy even in paul ryan's who quickeneth the dead this no doubt refers to the birth and the rescue of isaac upon the altar but it's also prophecy of the resurrection of jesus christ because jesus christ listen when god offered up christ as a sacrifice when christ even willingly offered himself up as a sacrifice do you are we not aware that christ said i have power to lay down my life and to raise it up again he says this commandment have i received from my father so his father commanded him to lay down his life but that was not the end of the commandment he was also given a commandment by the father that it would be raised back up so christ knew that this sacrifice was joined together with resurrection and so god when he told abraham to sacrifice isaac upon the altar that god was also giving him a revelation of the power over death because this had already been exemplified in the life of abraham the promise was from god himself who makes the dead alive again this is what this is what the scripture is trying to tell us that abraham's faith was based upon his faith is connected in a god who has power over the greatest to the least i know sometimes the question is asked if you could have a superpower what would it be and um i always kind of enjoy that conversation especially with children because you can uh there's certain things that they that they can come up with it's really wow that's bizarre and uh and and it's debatable could you be invisible or could you travel like a thought on these different things uh but god is the all the you know all superpower he's the all-powerful almighty god and he has and if you think of this eternity isn't this the most incredible characteristic of god is eternal isn't it the one thing about god that we can't get our heads around that it never did begin it will never have an end so this is a god that you can't quite you can't get your arms around him because he never began and he never ends and so he's a god now this is the character of god he believes in a god who is eternal who gave him eternal promises because he said i will be an everlasting god to you and he's and this is the revelation that's dawned in on abraham he's going to be my god forever well then that means this promise is forever i'm going to give this land to you and your seed forever okay abraham's revelation now is being connected beyond natural life he'd seen his brother die he's seen his father die he had seen death he'd seen the deadness of his wife's womb at wife's womb and he knew that there's not no way that even there's death to my lineage now there's no my name is going to end here in his mind at a certain point and so but now he begins to see this promise is beyond this and abraham was asked to believe in something beyond nature for him to be able to have a child with his wife it was beyond nature to this point he would have known my wife and i are unable to have children and so he had to trust in god alone he believed in a god who quickeneth the dead and called those things which be not as though they were and so his faith i know this is this is repetition and i'm repeating this his faith was directed towards a god who had power to give life and this is part of his understanding it's not this blind faith in a god and oh neat look he can raise the dead it's part of his understanding of the nature and character of god that he believed in a god who could give life he believed in a god who could who could resurrect he believed in a god who was giving him an eternal promise i will be your god forever this will be your land forever and so abraham is catching a revelation of eternity these eternal promises so this is how paul continues in romans 4 verse 19 and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead so catch now i want you to catch how abraham's faith that he believed the father of many nations the father of our faith how that his faith now keeps him from considering his own body which is dead and this is the language that paul is emphasizing about abraham's faith when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb so abraham had a faith to where he did not need to regard the deadness of his own body nor did he need to regard the deadness of sarah's womb why because he believed in a god which quickens the dead he could look at something that was hopeless lost dead gone buried and he could say well i have i believe in a god who can resurrect who can restore who can bring back who can redeem so he considers not the deadness of his own body nor the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief so if we want to attribute abraham staggering at all he does not stagger through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform abraham was fully persuaded that what god promised he was able to perform this is a man who understands the nature and character of god and he's fully persuaded that whatever promise god made he began to go through this progressive revelation where he could absolutely trust in the nature and character of god that even if my body is dead and my wife's womb is dead this body and that womb is going to bring forth a son named isaac because i have faith in a god who is able to bring that to pass and the scripture is specifically positioning his faith against death do you recognize that again remember i asked i posed the question uh to you i know you weren't asking me the question so i'm on the spot i can pose the question because i've already worked on the answer but it posed a question how is his faith an example determined to be an example for people of today abraham is an example he read those statements several statements a few wednesdays ago him being the example the example of the example he's the example of this faith in this end time faith and then we begin to identify in the scripture this is how his faith is being positioned against death and in genesis chapter 22 verse 4 as we read it in the outset then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place of far off it is on the third day that he comes to this mount moriah and where god appears to him as jehovah jireh the god who sees the one who's going to he going to provide a sacrifice the one that's going to set this example that as god i have trusted god and he's met my needs for all those who trust in him he will meet their needs it's on the third day that this happens and it's this pattern that he establishes in abraham and then we see it come up again in christ who is then the fulfillment of what isaac typified or what he was a foreshadow of and it's on the third day that christ is resurrected it's on the third day resurrection day his actions are speaking of power over death and a resurrection and in jehovah jireh brother branham says you provided a resurrection in form there for isaac who had come to the end of his road this is the language that we can identify in the word of god that when god provided this ram and he gave this this ram was caught in this thicket and then and they in the angel lord stops his hand and behold god creates this lamb this ram caught in this thicket and he has the sacrifice it's recorded as a resurrection in type to for isaac and then it says in hebrews chapter 11 verses 17 to 19. everybody doing good today uh you uh you're a smiling people i like that even even though i might be the angry preacher i'm up here just preaching about the love of god through clinched teeth and you guys are smiling and i appreciate that if i look angry i'm not um if i'm in am angry i think you you'll you'll be able to tell and it might be when i'm smiling but uh i just feel really good this morning and comfortable so i trust you you do as well because i could get too comfortable making maybe take advantage of and you're all like you're killing me notice how the scripture places it hebrews 11 17 18 and 19 by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son what a incredible structure of this that by faith he offered up isaac this is this is incredible this is a testing this is a trine but yet it's by faith he offers up isaac and the one who had received the promises what promises eternal inheritance and turtle seed eternal all these things offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called so it's the paradox of it kill your son the one through whom you're going to be blessed and all people of the earth are going to be blessed so then it's this to me is just a reciting of what ought to be recognized about abraham's faith he knew he was fully persuaded of god's promises to isaac so he was like if you're asking me to kill him you're obligated to resurrect him if this is what you're asking me to do then i'm going to see a greater miracle because i received isaac as one from the dead when my wife's womb which was dead which could never conceive did conceive and brought forth the son isaac according to your promise and if you did that and through him all the families of the earth are going to be blessed and you're wanting him to die by whatever cause and by what other whatever means even if it's by my own hand you are under obligation according to the promise according to the word which has been spoken beforehand this is not conjecture this is not imagination this is not superstition this is not rumor this is not mythology god had spoken it he had a revelation of it and so it led him to an understanding and a progressive revelation to say you made the promise then if this is what you're asking me to do then the results of this is going to be a resurrection and if we could catch that as the seed of abraham then if we just do what god has asked us to do the results of it are going to be exactly what he promised even if it doesn't seem well this isn't what it seems like what he promised and this isn't the resurrection that he i thought he or this isn't how i thought things were going to unfold just trust him may not it doesn't seem like it's unfolding in the way that you had the picture all planned out and the way you thought it was going to be but just trust them this is what abraham came to because in verse 19 it says accounting that reckoning that recognizing and believing that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure in other words i know this doesn't take a lot of study to be able to come up with this construction in other words abraham believed god could resurrect isaac this is part of his faith he believed that he had already witnessed the power of life over death considering that not considering the deadness of his own body not considering the deadness of his wife's womb he had already seen the power of life over death and i want to emphasize this because i don't want to lose sight of this this is the progressive revelation of abraham's faith to supreme faith he didn't say and again i'm not trying to be crude and i realize that it does in a way make us laugh but i don't do it to be crude it's not that abraham came you know hat was uh you know had had some gourd soup one night and started having these uh uh imaginations and these visions and hallucinations and in this hallucination he thought he met god and god was a rastafarian who told him to kill his wife he said your wife is going to have a son and the whole world's going to be blessed by her but i want you to kill her first i know might seem to be a little bit crude of me dramatizing it that way but notice that what this is the offer in genesis chapter 22 is coming after a longer period of god disclosing himself to abraham and so it's built upon this trust and the faith that abraham had when he left er in the land of the counties and he left the leaves the valley of shinar when he's leaving he had faith no doubt that he had had faith but that faith still brought him to a place where he was still with his father and with his family and god had to basically say no your faith has got to take you further than that because he had to separate from his father's house and then it came and i'm kind of getting into some other areas that we'd like to amplify later but then he finally had to separate from lot why because god's promise was i can't bless you until and so we wouldn't say off abraham wasn't a believer abraham wasn't a believer abraham wasn't a believer no this is just progressive revelation this is just him and his faith growing to where finally he separates from lot and these events are taking place and his life testifies of faith to supreme faith and his faith was a rev revelation even as it says in my redeemer lives brother bram said i've had the same kind of vision we're up yonder on a mountain when christ god met me and give me his redemptive names as jehovah jireh jehovah rapha and all these abraham this revelation of the what the nature and character of god he says of abraham seeing the death burial and resurrection these are things that abraham saw he saw these this character these characteristics and attributes of god this was a revelation of god and it's disclosing and i'm i'm zeroing in on a specific attribute because i want you to recognize this as part of abraham's supreme faith it's disclosing a specific attribute resurrection in my redeemer liveth again this is just a little bit later i've laid this is abraham speaking i laid him he talked about isaac laid him on the altar was going to take his own life knowing that i had received him as one from the dead i believe that he would raise him up again and through this great hope that beats in my heart i know he said that he could raise him up it was a foresight of the resurrection this is this is what abraham has seen he sees a revelation he has a revelation of a resurrection so his revelation that god could raise up isaac is foreshadowing that god can raise up jesus christ and would raise up jesus christ and that all the royal seed of abraham would be resurrected one day this is the revelation he has he says it was a four side of the resurrection the same thing that job had now that's that connects it with this tremendous faith of job and what did job say for i know that my redeemer liveth and he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god this is the revelation that job has this is a remarkable revelation in the context of the book of job and even in the context of scripture because it's the most clear enunciation of a resurrection or life after death or at the very least power over death because he's saying at the end of time at the end of days in the last days he at the latter day upon the earth my redeemer is going to be there in the latter day upon the earth and he says even if this body is destroyed i'll be standing there in my body and it applies to implies two things either he'll live forever to be there or if i die i'll come back up but regardless i'll be there that's the revelation that job gets and what is it that brother branham teaches us time and time and time again he says he saw the coming of the lord now when he says he saw the coming of the lord i think we ought to be very careful not to try to put it on any particular uh um the third coming or some other coming but just he saw the coming of the lord he saw the manifestation of god that would give power over death he saw this manifestation of god that was going to either cause a body which had been destroyed by his own its own worms and decayed come back to life again or god that would preserve his flesh to stand with his redeemer i know my redeemer liveth he will bring back he will restore he will raise back up this is the revelation that job had he says that abraham had the same revelation he had a foresight of the resurrection abraham's supreme faith testified of rapturing faith abraham's faith testified of resurrection faith abraham saw what job saw what did job see the resurrection what did abraham see foresight of the resurrection this is a specific manifestation of god john chapter 11 verses 25 to 26 jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life now think about it then i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live now let's pause let's just slow down for a moment and think about uh abraham who considered not the dead his dead body or the deadness of sarah's womb or the practical outcome of killing his son isaac which would be death because he had a foresight of the resurrection which means though something is dead yet it shall live and so abraham had this tremendous faith in this revelation of the resurrection but now i don't want you to think well it must have been a particular day that abraham saw and he had a vision of one day all his seed been resurrected no it was a revelation of a person who one of his essential attributes and characteristics was he's eternal life and he resurrects the dead because jesus says i am the resurrection as as we said oh i know one day in the resurrection my brother will live again he's saying well i am the resurrection it's not a future event it's a present person and when the word comes when he who is the dynamic comes then there's where the power of the rapture lies there's where the power of the resurrection lies he says i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though a won't be dead though a body be dead yet it shall live and then whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die there's the resurrection and a rapture those who are dead who are resurrected and those who are alive and remain and do not taste death he says believeth thou this and we say this i believe jesus christ is the resurrection then we can see then that abraham's revelation brought christ into view this is what he's seen and his faith is an example for us at the end time his faith holds a mystery of rapturing faith his life his example holds a mystery of rapturing faith it is something embodied in it's something exemplified by his life where god speaks to him he obeys god reveals himself to him and he walks it is a life that he lived he had a life that was lived by revelation and he walked with god he walked in this faith a life of faith the part i really want you to catch about him as it was a daily life i know i'm going very slow i i got started i was given a lot of grace to start early today and i feel like i've um just be labored too long and taken a lot of your time i apologize i want to read this scripture in mark chapter 12 verses 23 to 27. when i typed it i typed it as march chapter 12. i was like well let's go forth but it's mark chapter 12. i'm glad i caught it before i put it on a slide he says in the resurrection this is the question that they're posing to jesus mark chapter 12 verse 23 to 27 they had quite the hypothetical right a man gets married and he dies and his brother has to marry and then he dies and it's quite in the resurrection therefore when they shall rise all these brothers whose wife shall she be of them this woman who had the the fortunate blessing of being married to seven brothers for the seven had her to wife and jesus answered and said in him quite a question in the resurrection and and i think if i recall and i is the paradox of it is people who didn't believe in the resurrection are trying to trap him on in the resurrection whose wife is going to be but there's your bad faith arguments that we often receive from people it says for the seven hatter the wife jesus answering said unto him said unto them i want you to catch his answer to this hypothetical that's trying to trap jesus but this truth i almost want to stand outside of the context of the question do you not therefore air because ye know not the scriptures neither of the power of god i'm wanting to i'm wanting to emphasize that abraham's revelation of christ or revelation of god gave him an understanding of the nature and character of god and the power of god and so he says their problem now is they wrestle with this hypothetical of this woman who was married to seven brothers in the resurrection whose wife is she going to be he's saying you don't know the scriptures and you're ignorant of the power of god and he says for when they shall rise from the dead so he's affirming there will be a resurrection they never neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven and as touching the dead that they rise have you not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob now these are people who constantly said and i say constantly because it's recorded in the gospels constantly and so it's some of the same instances being repeated but they were always going we're of our father abraham we have father abraham and jesus used abraham quite often with them as far as the seed of abraham your children of abraham she's the daughter of abraham even in the parable of of of the of lazarus uh going to the going to uh being past beyond being in the bosom of abraham this is a very central figure obviously to the faith of the jews and he's saying did not even god when he spoke to moses identify himself as i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob and this is the rebuke of those who know not the scriptures nor the power of god and would not believe in the resurrection he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living ye therefore do greatly air this is the revelation that abraham had when god disclosed himself and he became the god of abraham he knew that god's position and his character and his nature required that there would be a people eternally existing in relationship to him for the also for that all of his attributes would be eternally manifested and so jesus said you air because you don't know the power of god god is not just the god of people who live this temporary existence and he has control over him and they're done and gone he gives you a way to good will and he doesn't need you anymore needs to go buy new toys no he's saying once mine always mine and he and he holds the this title of i am the god he speaks of himself i am the god of abraham and of the god of isaac and the god of jacob in other words these men must live because he's a god of the living not the god of the dead he doesn't speak of this of the dead you say i'm the god of quran i did i'm not the god of of these others who were dead he identified himself with those that are living and just to to seal this in in terms of what abraham was seeing in john chapter 8 verse 56 we read it wednesday night at the end your father abraham rejoiced to see my day his soul leapt forward in expectation to the revelation of jesus christ to his people this is something he says your father rejoiced to see my day there was this this part of this expectation to see my redeemer living this expectation to see this seed come and and it speaks of even how abraham must have had a soul travel forward in time to see this day when christ is being revealed to abraham's seed and then it says this to round it out and he saw it and was glad he beheld it to his joy this is something that it said of abraham that it's not just merely him having a vision or him hoping or him having some expectation but he rejoiced to see my day and he saw this day is something he saw and was glad what did abraham see and and this is that this is the point at which i feel like maybe i've preached long enough to where we could just end it right here and um don't get too excited and so it's at this point i feel that we can maybe just leave it with again this kind of this point that we ended on wednesday night in a lot of ways but what did abraham see and because really i gotta say all right then let's go back to genesis chapter 11 and just begin going verse by verse and identifying jesus christ in every verse in this progressive revelation of jesus christ to abraham and and how it manifested itself when there was uh circumstances related to physical problems circumstances related to political problems circumstances related to relationship problems circumstances related to strife in the family circumstances related to estrangement from extended family circumstances related to family who's backslidden goes out to the world all these different circumstances in abraham's life that he lived through that gives us hope and faith for our lives but what did abraham see he saw christ in melchizedek in genesis chapter 13 14. did he not does not the scripture afterwards verify that he has made a high priest forever after order of melchizedek and so this melchizedek this mysterious one that paul said he had more he wanted to talk about but he couldn't do it then because they weren't mature enough to take it he saw christ in melchizedek in genesis 14. he saw christ in the days of lot the days of lot jesus identified as the time in which judgment rained down upon sodom and gomorrah he saw christ in the days of lot when did he see him in genesis chapter 18 verse 1 when he appeared to him in the plains of memory again in a theophonic form just as he had been in melchizedek he saw christ in the days of lot in the plains of memory abraham saw the revelation of jesus christ abraham saw it jesus said abraham saw me he even said before abraham was i am so there is something about god manifesting himself in declaring himself jesus christ is the living word that makes god present he was before abraham and he is and he is so that he said before abraham was i am that's before the natural days of jesus of nazareth and then paul says have i not met jesus christ our lord this is after the days of jesus of nazareth so jesus christ is more than this man who walked the shores of galilee and thank god because the revelation you have today is not a personal lunch with jesus nazareth but it's a revelation of jesus christ personally to you he saw him and the bible says the royal seed of abraham will see the same thing right this is where i'm drawing on your maturity in the message of the hour the bible promises the same revelation will come to the royal seat of abraham in the day when the son of man will be revealed who did abraham see he saw the son of man who kept visiting him until abraham could come to the top of a mount moriah experience in a showdown in his faith testify of a resurrection and a rapture it was christ who walked with him through the entire process brother abraham says and be not afraid remember the last sign that was given to abraham which was the type of those who will go in the rapture think of this visitation of god then to abraham that's a type of those who will go in the rapture it's it lays right in the message this emphasis this theme about the faith of abraham a type of those who will go in the rapture and who is this melchizedek when neighbor says when abraham met him he was melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham which we are the attributes right we are his attributes he unfolds in abraham's life and in god making himself known to him in genesis 14 and genesis 18 we have to realize those are two separate events melchizedek refers to genesis 14. my lord lord in genesis 18 refers to him elohim filled in flesh and we realize it would be a a representation just the same as melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham he unfolds in these events in abraham's life these are my words now he unfolds in abraham's life what he will do in the end with every son of abraham i know i'm rearranging a little bit so he says it this way every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing but i want to watch how we have to come there's a way there's a process he said he's unfolding here what all god's attributes every son of abraham will do in the final in the final end every son of faith will absolutely do the same thing now he says every son of faith will absolutely do the same thing he's talking about will have the same experience of god making himself known to them god revealing himself to them and in genesis chapter 18 i want just to kind of cut in maybe we're a flash forward scene or something in in this sermon or in these things or flash back to genesis chapter 18. he comes these three angels come to him and he says my lord he only recognizes the one and and they ask it says they ask oh where's thy wife sarah and so they're all talking about the church the bride they're talking about the wife or whatever but only one had a message for her because then it was the lord who began to spoke and began to speak and spoke of sarah and in genesis chapter 18 verse 14 is anything too hard for the lord is this not what he we need to hear from god today when we've been traveling in this path as long as we have we've experienced our ups and downs we've experienced our disappointments when we're so familiar with our own doubts and backslidings and we see everything seemingly falling apart do we not need a visitation from god himself who can look at us and share with us with such earnesty and intimacy and say is anything too hard and i say just continue to trust me don't worry about these things that are befalling you don't worry about all the chaos around you he's saying is anything too hard in other words nothing's too hard for me abraham nothing's too hard for me sarah the promise i made to you i will keep and if god has spoken anything to you and you believed it don't let go of it for anything because even those things that he spoke to you that you felt would be so tremendous and so powerful and we'd be so beautiful and so clearly come to pass and the further away you got from it the harder it is for you to believe that it'll happen don't stop believing is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son is anything too hard for the lord at the appointed time i will return according to the time of life i will come to the the season the time of life this is the time where sarah is going to receive and she's going to conceive and so what was it going to be a resurrection of a dead woman so he says according to the time of life it means according to a time time of life would speak of a season of conception but for her it wasn't just merely a woman who came into a particular cycle where she could get pregnant but a time when the womb is resurrected i'm going to visit you at a time a season for resurrection where deadness is conquered so that my promise can be fulfilled i have to deal with death so that this promise will be full i have to resurrect so this promise can be fulfilled i actually have to take a womb which is old and make it new again in order for this promise to be fulfilled she says i will return unto thee at this time as it says in romans 9 9 for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sarah shall have a son at this time notice these promises given to abraham now what i want to take a step back and do is he says he unfolds hear what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham will do in the final every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing but i've got to show you how you've got to come there was a way things that god had to do things that god had to manifest that would be the provided way that every attribute of god every son of the faith would have to come through that channel come through god's provided way and he's showing right here in genesis 18 brought back up in romans chapter 9 i will come to you abraham's life sets the order of the rapture at a time determined i will come at a time determined i will manifest myself to you to return to return back to give life over death to take bodies that ought to die and bypass death to take bodies that were dead dead and raise them up again and this is something that you'll find as you study the word of god and this is a great portion that i removed from my notes because i just wanted to go a little bit different direction here and i so i wanted to say it now and i say this on the authority of the message before we meet the lord in the air there must be a rapture before we meet the lord in the air there must be a resurrection there must be a visitation and they're bringing forth a rapturing faith now think about we can't we can't meet the lord in these bodies right so these have got to be changed and then we're not going to be we're not going to meet the lord in the air with these bodies and then we're going to get rapture in faith because we see the lord this 900-foot jesus we're like i knew it right the visitation of the lord the revealing of jesus christ to us gives us rapturing faith for this great climactic change to meet the lord in the air abraham's life testifies of supreme faith for a rapture i'm just going to close here so i'm going to go ahead and just skip to my last my last quote that i have in there brother john the one from abraham and his seat after him abraham's life begins with election where god speaks to him personally calls him out of the multitudes of people and then i know that we like to express it in the sense that abraham walked with god but god walked with him is it i mean in reality abraham was going to be able to keep up right you ever going to walk with your kids you walk at their pace especially if they're on scooters but you you kind of have to you have to adjust your pace you see you want to go on a walk together they suggest that how can two walk together except they be agreed it's like the same we went to different schools together you're not together unless you're in the same place in the same cadence how can two walk together except they be in the same the same pace so god condescends himself down and walks with abraham but really god's there on the top of mount moriah but he meets with him in the valley of shinar and he knows i'm going to take you from this valley over all these decades and through all these miles and through all these heartaches and disappointments and warfares and battles and struggles but one day you're going to meet me on the top of mount moriah and there's going to be a capstone to this relationship you have with me and as small as abraham must have felt to experience that kind of love and how empty his i love you back must have been this there was a faithfulness in his creator that never diminished and demeaned abraham and that's why when it came to the end he trusted him without reservation and he trusted him with his only son think about it the son that he loved i'm overwhelmed with this right now the son that he loved and then what god says to abraham then i don't know why it's just striking me this way so profoundly as i thought about this yesterday it had no i thought it was just something very personal and i wouldn't share this but you know how when you tell god you love them and you're like i mean the way he loves me that for me to say i love him has just got to be like yeah okay but then god says to abraham i know that you love me was not peter so anxious when he says peter do you love me and jesus and he says i love you and says well feed my feed my sheep peter do you love me because i i love you to feed my sheep and then what did peter say the third time you know you know i love you perhaps he's haunted of his unfaithfulness and his denials and everything that he did and he's thinking how empty are these words in this moment where i want to express my love to you and they're so shallow after all that you've done for me and then for abraham to be in a position on the top of mount moriah and for god to say i know you love me and wouldn't it encourage you today to know that god knows you love him too and that he's that he he's called you in by election he's made an unconditional covenant with you not to say well if you prove your love to me and you proved to be a good enough son and you proved to do this and you proved it that and if you could just make good on all your promises then one day i'll give you the baptism of the holy ghost and one day i'm going to do this to you no he says i love you i've chosen you by election and you have to obey but i am going to never leave you nor forsake you and walk with you i'm not going to get ahead of you i'm going to walk with you and even when you turn around and run back a little bit i'm going to chase you and i'm going to walk back with you i'm going to bring you back through all your backslidings all your ups and downs all your doubts all your failures all your hagars all your ishmaels all your fightings all your disputings and i'm going to be with you until you get to the top of mount moriah and it's there you're going to know that i know you love me and that's the revelation that abraham receives maybe not so much that god knows that he loves them but abraham i know you love me he begins with election with abraham and then god walks with them and your life is built on the same principle and i'd like to sew this seed in for a future reference or to come back to it so let's not make it odd or mysterious in the chur when brother brown is preaching the seals and again i just want to lay this in there as a seed and seventh seal and question and answers on the seals he just says just live a good christian life he wasn't saying that to diminish the importance and the value of what had just transpired but he's doing it to point to how it will be manifested he's not saying all the seals are open the seals are open now look this is weird so let's just kind of put this away and just keep doing what you're doing and stay how you are and just live quiet simple lies and forget about this he's saying what's been opened up here will never become flesh until you just live it and live a good christian life and that's what we see in the life of abraham musicians if you'd come and the message abraham and his seed after him he says our bodies will have to be changed we just can't turn back to young men and women we've got to have a different kind of body so you can be caught in the air to receive the promised son that's what the church is waiting for now the true church every manifestation what he did to abraham he has done to his seed after him leaving one thing out that's the rapture of the church so abraham everything every manifestation that he did to abraham he's done to his seed after him so let's take a step back everything he did to abraham is the table of contents everything he did to abraham is the outline so you know we've all been there to certain weddings where it's kind of like where are we at on the program how many more of these do we have right because we kind of want to know where we're at what's next oh another song another song who's that what's their name where are they on here right because you want to know where you're at well abraham's life is the same way that his it was acted out in abraham's life and everything that he did to abraham he did to the seed of abraham but there's only one thing somehow someway in abraham's life there was the testimony there was the experience of and a foreshadowing of the rapture and he says every manifestation he's done to his seed after him leaving one thing out that's the rapture of the church that's why supreme faith rapturing faith perfect faith is revealed in abraham and that's where we stand today and again i want to put it in i want to put it in a graphic that gets our attention supreme faith and i want us to think rapturing faith and i want us to think capstone and i want us to think seven thunders uttering divorces and revealing the mystery of those seven seals and i want you to think of the third pull and i want you to think of all these things as i say with the lisp i want you to hear it and i want you to think about it these great things elohim fell in flesh who is this melchizedek all these great things yes yes that's what we're coming to how are you going to get there just trust him what do those things mean what are they all about just trust him just follow in the pattern of his word just do what he's asking you to do just trust him day by day by day as we stand to our feet this morning my prayer for you today is that you could then believe that if every manifestation that god had to abraham he gives to his seed after him [Music] you give us this experience that abraham my daughter my son i know that thou fearest me i know that you reverence me i know that you love me and i think that would do us good don't you think with our heads bad let's pray together gracious heavenly father and the sweetness of this time that we've had together we've emphasized a singular thought i realize it's repetition to most of the people that are here [Music] that the actions of abraham in genesis chapter 22 testified of the faith of the bride in the last days who triumphs over death and we see that you by your breath and inspiration and writing the scriptures emphasized these things about abraham's faith and hid these details in his life i say hid lord perhaps it's just easy to pass over not be reminded of lord they're there that we might be encouraged [Music] that it would give us strength to believe all things are possible [Music] even as christ said in the days of his flesh with man this is impossible but with god all things are possible it's what you said to abraham in genesis 18 is anything too hard for the lord [Music] with abram it was impossible with sarai it was impossible but with the h which represents god with you the impossible became not only possible probable imminent guaranteed and i pray today lord for the faces that i look out upon and the many that stream lord that if there's a crisis of faith we feel pulled and we feel torn and there's so many things drawing on us from different angles our rest comes in from finding your heart [Music] and i think so many things lord cloud the picture and get caught up in our view today lord may just all be pushed aside and may we feel the reassurance of your presence confirming your your care and concern with us and affirm to us today lord if you did it for abraham where you said to him on that mount moriah you said abraham i know that you fear me then lord could you today though we may not have lifted our hands back to slay our son and though we may not have already experienced this change of our bodies but having been caught up in this rapture season having been experiencing a resurrection out of dead denominationalism lord could you speak to our hearts today through these eyes of grace and passion and say i know that you love me reassure us today lord we know your love is perfect it's our love that we doubt we know your word is sure lord it's our faith that we feel this apprehension about may you affirm it today lord give us a grace father to persevere and to step forward in the the plan and the path that you have for us lord you've given me the benefit of being connected with many people in in in this church and in this area what i could even say by extension connected to thousands but lord just in these personal relationships that we're developing and lord it gives me touch points where i i know of people's decisions that they're facing and problems that they're experiencing changes that are transpiring [Music] lord there's things that i could even take personal in all that [Music] but what relieves my anxiety is you what helps me is to know my place in you that's what comforts me lord as a husband as a father to know that my relationship with you will strengthen me in my love for my wife my relationship with you will give me more clear consistent wisdom with my children so lord when i look out upon your people and i see what they're going through i want that for them i regardless of my personal hurts regardless of my uh of what i would personally want what i would want for them is for you to be present in their lives and lead them and guide them and give them the peace and assurance that they crave so i commit the people to you today and i pray your blessing upon us now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
