[0:01] my theme tonight is
[0:05] where is my place
[0:11] I'd like to start once again with the
[0:14] testimony
[0:17] it could be the second part of what we
[0:19] spoke of last time
[0:24] Cristiano I believe that for a Christian
[0:39] to a body
[0:43] what part of that body are we
[0:48] okay
[0:51] what role should we unveil says
[0:59] at least that was one of the most
[1:01] difficult questions that I asked myself
[1:02] at the beginning of my Christian walk
[1:07] if I'm a part of that body
[1:10] okay
[1:13] then what part am I
[1:16] okay
[1:21] importante I believe we'd all like to be
[1:24] an important part of the body
[1:27] but you know
[1:30] there's some parts that you don't even
[1:32] see is
[1:35] so important just like any vital organ
[1:40] esposa the other day I was talking to my
[1:42] wife
[1:48] the last
[1:50] company
[1:52] what's one of the simplest parts of the
[1:55] body
[1:57] she said the nail
[1:59] yeah I said yeah possibly
[2:04] but that nail if it's not there if we
[2:08] were to just rip it off
[2:12] possibly a deadly infection can enter in
[2:19] so that has an important role too
[2:23] to protect the rest of the entire body
[2:30] by simply allowing for deadly infection
[2:32] to not get into the body
[2:34] because it can reach your heart you can
[2:38] reach your mind
[2:39] it can reach any other vital organs
[2:44] without caring of how important it is
[2:53] and that vital organ depends upon that
[2:55] nail or any part of our skin
[2:57] does its purpose
[3:02] of not allowing any infection to enter
[3:04] in
[3:05] as he is
[3:07] that's how it is in the body of our Lord
[3:09] Jesus Christ also
[3:11] I mean yes and even going back to my
[3:14] childhood
[3:16] the
[3:17] omis Padres
[3:20] well my parents when they accepted the
[3:22] Lord Jesus Christ
[3:25] in Mexico they started in the
[3:27] Pentecostal Church in Mexico
[3:29] back in the 80s
[3:32] foreign
[3:42] and that was back in the times where
[3:44] they still believe you had to speak in
[3:46] tongues and all those things were a sign
[3:47] of the Holy Ghost
[3:50] s
[3:52] so then every time there was a service
[3:57] I remember that there were people that
[3:59] would just speak in tongues
[4:01] and I was never able to speak in tongues
[4:06] and that traumatized me
[4:09] because I I was I believe for a very
[4:12] long time
[4:15] that I could never receive the Holy
[4:17] Ghost
[4:19] because I couldn't speak in tongues
[4:23] and that took me for a long time
[4:27] to ask myself this
[4:32] is
[4:35] why can't I receive the Holy Ghost
[4:40] and then afterwards
[4:47] what is my place in the body of our Lord
[4:49] Jesus Christ
[4:52] I remember that there'd be evenings
[4:55] and I'm talking about my adolescence
[4:58] that I'd wake up in the middle of the
[5:00] night
[5:06] and I go and see because in the
[5:08] denominations they would teach that the
[5:09] Rapture would be from one moment to the
[5:10] next
[5:12] that at any moment it would happen
[5:15] and my worry was so much
[5:22] did I remember I'd wake up in the middle
[5:24] of the night to see if Mama was still in
[5:26] bed
[5:31] and it was a real trauma that I had in
[5:34] my adolescence
[5:35] but thanks to God
[5:38] that he sent a messenger
[5:44] to clear up all these things but
[5:48] the most beautiful thing is
[5:50] or at least the way that I see it
[5:53] para me for me
[6:04] it's that he chose me to believe what
[6:06] that messenger has brought us
[6:20] I would have been the same thing
[6:25] many times just to the simple things
[6:29] we don't give it the importance that's
[6:31] necessary
[6:35] just see
[6:42] each and everyone's place
[6:48] or at least this helped me out
[6:54] we've got to study
[6:57] e and entender
[7:00] understand the three stages of Grace
[7:07] when brother Aaron was preaching last
[7:09] weekend
[7:11] when we left when we exited church
[7:15] because I already knew I was going to
[7:17] preach this Wednesday
[7:19] I said brother Aaron already preached
[7:21] the theme that I was going to preach
[7:25] I believe in my heart Brethren okay
[7:34] everyone can unveil it in a different
[7:36] way
[7:38] and it could be of a help for the people
[7:44] well that's the way I see it I see it
[7:46] this way
[7:48] if we would put up a picture
[7:51] Nosotros in front of us
[7:56] and we ask every single person to
[7:59] describe that picture
[8:06] possibly the most outstanding thing in
[8:08] the picture we'd all mention is
[8:13] but you'll find that within that
[8:16] description there'll be very different
[8:17] details within that picture
[8:22] the angle in which we're looking at it
[8:28] that's why I understand
[8:31] my brother Branham says
[8:35] that doctrines should not separate us
[8:41] because each and every one of us look at
[8:44] it from a different angle
[8:49] but we should all be tolerant
[8:52] with one another
[8:55] I believe that we come
[8:58] to get to that point
[9:02] like the first Pentecostal Church
[9:14] Holy Ghost to come down
[9:18] I believe that's our intention as a
[9:21] group
[9:22] to get to that point
[9:26] because to get to that point
[9:30] we've got to take all of our ideas
[9:34] all of our beliefs
[9:37] and get to the point of the word of God
[9:45] I was even talking with our brother
[9:47] Marcos there in the back with about this
[9:49] precise thing about this church
[9:53] and I said look
[9:55] um
[10:00] and I don't remember the exact topic we
[10:02] were talking about but I said even in
[10:03] the first Pentecostal Church
[10:12] just notice how it describes that church
[10:15] the way they were so perfect it was like
[10:16] they're already in the Millennium
[10:19] it says that they had so much love
[10:24] they'd bring all of their goods foreign
[10:33] but I said but notice
[10:38] and you continue reading if you keep
[10:42] reading
[10:47] that church didn't last too long
[10:51] it says that the complaints began right
[10:53] away
[10:59] that's why we've got to be careful
[11:01] Brothers
[11:04] and I believe it's Our intention
[11:07] to get to the point
[11:11] of that description of the first church
[11:18] before the murmuring begins amongst us
[11:23] but unfortunately
[11:26] the murmuring always comes first
[11:32] but we keep on walking
[11:35] Anton says so then
[11:38] for me to be able to stand
[11:41] position
[11:44] what is my position in the body of our
[11:46] Lord Jesus Christ
[11:50] I have to understand the three stages of
[11:52] Grace
[11:53] [Applause]
[11:55] and understand what stage am I standing
[11:58] in
[12:02] because the three stages they can pass
[12:09] depending on the person
[12:12] God can do a Miracles
[12:16] and send you from justification
[12:18] unto the new birth
[12:22] but there's people that we struggle more
[12:28] there's people that stay behind in
[12:30] justification
[12:33] others that stay in sanctification
[12:38] and sometimes
[12:42] and we're going to read it right now in
[12:44] a little bit
[12:46] I Believe In My Heart
[12:49] ification that even in sanctification
[12:53] it's the most dangerous stage
[12:58] why
[13:04] is
[13:07] I like to read in the church order the
[13:10] museum 1958
[13:16] brother Branham says the following
[13:25] is
[13:32] it's simply like many many times that
[13:34] I've talked it's like picking up a cup
[13:36] out there in the chicken coop
[13:38] eration
[13:45] justification is like picking it up
[13:47] being ready to use it for a purpose in
[13:49] the heart
[13:50] sanctification sanctification we know
[13:54] okay it's the stage
[13:57] where the person accepts the Lord Jesus
[14:00] Christ as their savior he comes they get
[14:04] baptized
[14:06] but they continue to be filthy
[14:10] yeah
[14:13] and that's where we sometimes make
[14:15] mistakes with those people
[14:22] because we want to see them walking like
[14:25] people that have the Holy Ghost
[14:27] s
[14:30] that they're in a process
[14:33] of being cleansed
[14:40] and we sometimes make the mistakes
[14:45] that if we see them make a mistake
[14:49] who criticize them instead of helping
[14:51] them
[14:55] ano if the brother in justification
[15:01] we see him smoke or any other thing
[15:09] we need to help them
[15:13] he's in the process of
[15:19] sanctification then follows
[15:21] sanctification
[15:26] and I think they're the devil for me
[15:28] personally he kept me in that place for
[15:29] a long time
[15:36] brother Branham says
[15:42] I really like the example he gives here
[15:44] in this preaching
[15:47] because he Compares it to a cup or a
[15:50] glass
[15:53] crucification is
[15:56] justifications when he picks it up
[16:02] sanctification
[16:04] is when it's washed it's about so that
[16:08] cup is washed
[16:09] it's no longer dirty
[16:28] then he's cleansed by the blood of Jesus
[16:30] Christ and the word sanctify is a word
[16:33] is a compound word that means cleansed
[16:35] and set apart for service
[16:48] and that's sometimes another mistake
[16:50] that we make okay or that I have
[16:53] committed
[16:55] because we think
[16:58] that God's already taken everything away
[17:00] from us
[17:01] yes
[17:04] and we're ready to go confront the
[17:07] devils
[17:11] or many times because we think
[17:18] that we're cleansed and washed
[17:22] that's when we start to feel Superior
[17:26] to the rest of the brethren
[17:31] that's the most dangerous stage
[17:34] because that's when the devil can make
[17:36] us believe
[17:38] that we've reached the goal
[17:42] nasimiento of the new birth
[17:46] but we still haven't gotten there yet
[17:49] you're cleansed
[17:54] but
[17:55] we've got to keep on walking
[18:08] the serpent is still there
[18:11] and
[18:13] justification
[18:15] the serpent is still there
[18:17] in sanctification
[18:20] and in sanctification the serpent isn't
[18:23] there nor is the the dove there
[18:31] we're going to read in Matthew 12 43.
[18:40] foreign
[19:06] when the unclean spirit is gone out of a
[19:09] man he walketh through Dry places
[19:11] seeking rest and findeth none
[19:21] then he says I will return into my house
[19:24] from whence I came out and when he has
[19:27] come he findeth it empty swept and
[19:29] garnished
[19:31] Anton says
[19:40] primero
[19:48] then go with he and take it with him
[19:50] seven other Spirits more wicker than
[19:52] himself and they enter in and dwell
[19:54] there and the last state of the man is
[19:57] worse than the first
[20:00] that's sanctification Brothers
[20:05] you're clean
[20:07] but that vessel
[20:10] it's got to be filled
[20:13] yes
[20:15] and it can't stay empty for too long
[20:21] something's got to fill it up
[20:26] and that's where we go to the example of
[20:29] brother Branham
[20:31] when he talks about the two dogs
[20:35] depend
[20:37] upon it depends upon what that heart's
[20:40] going to be filled with
[20:42] what are we going to fill it with
[20:47] and even
[20:50] to me the devil deceived me for a long
[20:53] time
[20:54] in that stage instead of going forward
[20:57] he made me believe
[20:59] that I've reached
[21:02] the point of receiving the Holy Ghost
[21:07] because I no longer had
[21:10] any vices
[21:14] del mundo no more attraction for the
[21:17] worldly things
[21:20] but it took me to the other side
[21:24] unto the religious
[21:30] yes
[21:32] and that anointing it's very heavy
[21:37] because you spend your time judging
[21:39] everybody
[21:44] pensando thinking
[21:49] that I had already received the Holy
[21:52] Ghost
[21:56] and I remember that I'd ask myself
[22:02] then when and where am I going to know
[22:04] that I've received the Holy Ghost
[22:10] and how will I know
[22:14] well now I know how
[22:18] soon experiencia it's an experience
[22:21] Unforgettable
[22:27] is
[22:29] it's like when a child is born
[22:34] you know something happened but you
[22:36] don't even know what happened
[22:45] [Music]
[22:50] Johnny Alvarado preached it stayed
[22:52] recorded in my mind
[22:54] and he said this phrase
[22:59] he said you won't know
[23:04] he won't know if the experience you had
[23:07] on Sunday
[23:08] was of God or no or not
[23:11] until Monday comes around
[23:19] yeah
[23:20] and at that moment I didn't understand
[23:22] that but
[23:24] now I do understand it
[23:27] when
[23:27] we get to work oh
[23:31] even before when
[23:35] we've got to wake up our kids for school
[23:41] that's when you have to start to
[23:43] manifest
[23:46] that experience
[23:50] that we had on Sunday at church
[23:53] or you had in your bedroom
[23:57] or wherever it is that you received that
[24:00] new birth
[24:04] and we know
[24:09] to enter into the mystical body of our
[24:11] Lord Jesus Christ
[24:14] we need that new birth Brothers
[24:17] we can't be apart
[24:21] of the mystical body of our Lord Jesus
[24:23] Christ
[24:25] until you and I have been born again
[24:29] but you know
[24:34] even just thinking about that
[24:47] in receiving the new birth
[24:52] is
[24:56] many times the question still lingers
[24:58] well then what should I do now
[25:00] no predico I Don't Preach that's what I
[25:04] would say to myself no Kanto I don't
[25:06] sing
[25:08] I don't play music
[25:13] I'm not good with public relations
[25:20] well then what role do I play here
[25:30] I don't know if you've ever asked
[25:31] yourself that same question
[25:43] that
[25:52] Joshua gave the position to every tribe
[25:56] then the Holy Ghost comes and to every
[26:00] one of us
[26:01] he gives us our position
[26:06] and even meditating on it
[26:24] brother Branham says
[26:40] even the way we compose ourselves
[26:44] just thinking and meditating and
[26:47] speaking
[26:52] about what we have to unveilation I was
[26:56] talking with my wife
[27:00] and I was telling her did you know
[27:04] that if we read the Bible and the
[27:08] message
[27:11] there's four bodies that we pertain to
[27:16] Primera first of all
[27:19] this body that God has given us
[27:22] that we've got to take care of foreign
[27:25] because
[27:29] it's a temple of the Holy Spirit
[27:34] that's the first body
[27:37] she says well what's the second body
[27:39] Bueno well
[27:41] if you go
[27:43] and we go to the Bible
[27:46] the Bible says
[27:48] that man is the head of the woman
[27:52] so for the man
[27:54] there's a second body
[27:58] because I don't think there's a head
[27:59] without a body
[28:05] right and then the Third
[28:10] the local church
[28:19] and then the fourth is
[28:23] the mystical body of our Lord Jesus
[28:25] Christ
[28:28] and every one of them
[28:31] depends upon us
[28:35] because like we were talking
[28:39] we've got to present esta cuerpo this
[28:42] body limpio clean
[28:47] and even
[28:52] one of those bodies depends upon
[28:55] every one of the members
[29:06] foreign
[29:13] but even going back to the three stages
[29:15] of Grace
[29:20] why is it important
[29:23] to know
[29:25] what stage we're in
[29:28] because in that manner we can go forward
[29:33] the Holy Spirit
[29:37] remember that there's a very common
[29:39] phrase
[29:48] I thank God
[29:50] okay
[29:53] I might not be what I want to be
[29:56] pero United but I'm no longer what I
[29:59] used to be
[30:02] as I meditate upon that
[30:06] is
[30:07] then I asked myself another question
[30:11] thank you because I'm not what I used to
[30:13] be
[30:18] but why am I not yet what I'm supposed
[30:21] to be
[30:26] possible
[30:31] possibly I know that I am not what I'm
[30:34] supposed to be
[30:36] hace but why haven't I gotten to the
[30:39] point of being what I'm supposed to be
[30:41] if you've given us everything
[30:45] you've given us the message
[30:53] you've given us teachings
[31:02] he
[31:04] if he is importante and if you notice
[31:07] what's important
[31:12] why we should know our position
[31:17] this is
[31:19] in adoption
[31:25] to teach the Bible is usually a bit
[31:27] delicate
[31:31] you know it's more or less like walking
[31:33] on thin ice
[31:39] but we know that in reaching this point
[31:42] and at this time
[31:46] so it could be good to bring the church
[31:48] to the point of what I'm thinking
[31:54] to a complete understanding positionally
[31:57] of what we are in Christ Jesus
[32:00] sometimes
[32:02] I believe the preaching
[32:05] it's something marvelous
[32:10] and the teaching goes further than that
[32:15] is
[32:17] like it's especially for the church
[32:21] and here you wanna I wanna stay here
[32:23] just for a moment
[32:25] I believe this is where we should thank
[32:27] God
[32:29] because God's given us a man
[32:32] with my heart
[32:36] that he's a good teacher that brings
[32:38] teachings
[32:42] we're privileged
[32:45] and having a man that worries
[32:49] to bring teachings to bring us a
[32:53] teaching places
[32:56] every one of us
[33:00] but sometimes
[33:03] when things become common
[33:07] is
[33:10] we forget how valuable that which God
[33:12] has given us is
[33:21] but the teaching
[33:25] the teaching coloca alombre it locates
[33:28] the man positionalment
[33:31] is positionally in what he is
[33:39] I believe that we're on our way to that
[33:45] I believe we receive good teachers every
[33:47] time we come to church
[34:12] what we are
[34:17] Mente
[34:31] what we are
[34:35] well and I'm going to say this
[34:37] is
[34:39] and I heard it and I also believe it
[34:42] I believe the devil Devil's scared
[34:45] that someone comes and gets baptized
[34:51] the devil's not scared of someone going
[34:54] through sanctification
[35:02] I think sometimes the devil is not even
[35:04] scared when we receive the new birth
[35:07] I believe that he starts to worry cuando
[35:10] when you and I receive we receive
[35:14] departed
[35:16] that revelation
[35:19] of what we are is
[35:22] what we're going to unveil
[35:29] God reveals to us
[35:31] what our post is
[35:36] there's nothing that can hold us back
[35:40] yes
[35:41] and the devil knows this
[35:46] is
[36:00] already lost that battle
[36:10] meter
[36:15] I know that the devil plays a lot with
[36:17] our mind
[36:31] I was telling my wife
[36:35] because she would tell me
[36:38] it's difficult to understand okay
[36:41] [Music]
[36:44] because brother Branham says
[36:50] that from our composure depende it
[36:54] dependsion the blessing
[36:57] or the curse
[37:02] in
[37:05] the local body
[37:09] is
[37:11] and then you go and he gives the example
[37:14] the Josue of Joshua
[37:17] cuando Khan when can
[37:20] cerebellum
[37:22] took the the mantle of Jericho
[37:26] nombre but first by one single man
[37:30] that committed a mistake
[37:33] many people died and
[37:37] brother Brandon brings that to us he
[37:41] says many times
[37:42] that's why there's no beers
[37:46] that's why many times we don't see the
[37:48] Holy Spirit operate in our group
[37:52] because our composure
[37:55] it's not the right one is
[38:02] k
[38:04] Dios de Manifesto that God manifests
[38:10] and it's because many times
[38:14] I don't know if we just don't understand
[38:17] or we're scared of the responsibility
[38:27] because there are people that are scared
[38:29] of their responsibility
[38:31] it is a great responsibility
[38:35] well first we need to understand
[38:42] if we consider ourselves members of this
[38:45] local body
[38:52] Ramos and if we do consider ourselves
[38:59] even the things we do in the most
[39:01] private part of our homes
[39:04] they can come and jeopardize the next
[39:06] service
[39:11] that's the responsibility we all have as
[39:13] members
[39:18] of everybody
[39:35] Marcos I was telling the brother Marcos
[39:39] and I was telling them
[39:46] he was telling me how they're in the
[39:48] church that he attends
[39:51] he does all that they ask of him
[39:59] any little thing he's like a spare tire
[40:09] and I said well that's the position that
[40:12] God loves the most
[40:15] because once
[40:18] we receive a title yeah
[40:21] we don't want to do anything else that
[40:23] we think
[40:26] that doesn't pertain to the title that
[40:28] we've got
[40:32] I believe
[40:34] that the best position
[40:37] is that one obreros is a laborer
[40:43] God needs laborers
[40:49] and if we go to the definition of a
[40:51] laborer
[40:54] and labor is the one that's willing to
[40:56] do any job
[41:02] he possibly might not be the best one
[41:05] but
[41:06] he's willing to do it
[41:14] just see
[41:19] the devil tortured me for a long time
[41:25] I felt and I still feel that's what I
[41:29] was telling the brothers
[41:31] I don't consider myself a good speaker
[41:35] but since God
[41:37] revealed to me and let me understand
[41:41] yeah
[41:43] okay no es for Mis abilidades it's not
[41:46] because of my abilities
[41:51] is because of what he can do through me
[41:56] I would tell him
[41:59] if I was here 10 years ago
[42:02] brother Aaron would have asked me to
[42:04] preach
[42:05] the most probable thing would be I
[42:08] wouldn't preach
[42:10] because that whole time I just be
[42:13] comparing myself to him
[42:15] and that's true brother yes
[42:19] and that sometimes what impedes us from
[42:21] doing the job for God
[42:23] that we think
[42:26] and we can't do it the way another
[42:28] person
[42:30] we think is better for us
[42:32] but I would tell the brother
[42:35] God let me understand
[42:41] okay that is
[42:44] if he wants me to do a job
[42:49] that's because I'm the best to do that
[42:51] job at that moment
[42:53] AR without caring
[42:56] how many better there are or especially
[42:59] or Specialists there are
[43:02] at that moment at that place
[43:07] put over the ncil because I'm standing
[43:10] out of obedience to him
[43:13] he's got to back me up
[43:19] that's when one can understand
[43:23] when you understand your position
[43:29] is
[43:33] and this scripture in First Corinthians
[43:35] 12 27 helped me understand
[43:50] the scripture took away many traumas
[43:58] it made me understand my position in the
[44:00] body of our Lord Jesus Christ
[44:04] is
[44:07] one of the scriptures that has helped me
[44:09] the most in my spiritual walk
[44:12] and it raises
[44:16] First Corinthians 12 27 and 28.
[44:22] in particular
[44:25] now ye are the body of Christ and
[44:27] members in particular
[44:29] and we are what miembros members
[44:35] Del cuerpo de Cristo of the body of
[44:38] Christ
[44:39] IA
[44:45] and God had set them set some in the
[44:47] church Primera first apostolis apostles
[44:52] I said up no I'm not an apostle
[44:58] secondarily Prophets
[45:01] tampoco not that one either
[45:07] I can't see things I can't
[45:10] discerno Maestro thirdly teachers
[45:17] just to understand things much less to
[45:19] teach them
[45:25] after that Miracles and the gifts of
[45:28] healing
[45:30] forgive me Lord
[45:32] for not being able to reach this faith
[45:35] yet
[45:38] I told the Lord at that moment tampoco
[45:46] and I also haven't reached that Faith
[45:48] where you do Miracles and you heal
[45:50] no no no no internet
[45:55] I don't fall in any of these
[45:57] days
[46:02] these categories of those that I just
[46:04] read don't understand me me position
[46:07] then where's my position
[46:11] helps
[46:23] and there God gave me one of my best
[46:25] experiences
[46:26] those that help
[46:30] not soy Apostle not an apostle
[46:33] Maestro I'm not a teacher
[46:37] so it's in the body of our Lord Jesus
[46:40] Christ
[46:42] my position
[46:46] to help
[46:54] it's one of the biggest spiritual feasts
[46:57] I've had
[47:01] because I'm going to show any kind of
[47:03] anything is Supernatural but I said
[47:07] anything outstanding to be a part of the
[47:10] body of Jesus Christ
[47:12] those that help
[47:17] but
[47:21] hello
[47:23] but then afterwards
[47:26] those that help but
[47:29] you've also got to observe the attitude
[47:37] I believe that when we've got the Holy
[47:39] Ghost
[47:40] when God reveals to us
[47:44] the position in
[47:47] every body that we pertain to
[47:51] no neces
[47:53] we don't have to be something
[47:55] extraordinary
[48:01] we need to be
[48:04] we need to have the will
[48:10] to be someone that can help
[48:16] because many times
[48:18] I mean
[48:21] when I was cutting hair
[48:24] we had a client
[48:27] OS
[48:31] he told us the same
[48:34] he said notice
[48:37] always
[48:40] what helps the least
[48:43] is what bothers the most
[48:49] and that applies to any part of life
[48:56] what helps the least
[48:58] and look at Massachusetts bothers the
[49:01] most
[49:03] I said Lord
[49:08] I believe I've taken that position for a
[49:11] long time in church
[49:12] forgive me
[49:15] help me I said to be
[49:20] someone that can help investorbe and not
[49:24] bother
[49:26] because always
[49:30] to be helped
[49:33] us
[49:34] but when are we willing to help
[49:39] now remember one thing
[49:42] God's pleased more lower
[49:46] than sacrifice
[49:50] he embasses and sometimes it must
[49:53] possible it's easier
[49:55] just make a sacrifice then give
[49:57] obedience
[50:00] because obedience
[50:04] many times goes against what we want to
[50:06] do
[50:09] right and sometimes
[50:12] we've got to obey embassies without even
[50:16] understanding it
[50:19] a
[50:22] and we always want to understand it
[50:24] first
[50:26] no no obedient obedience
[50:32] give me that just see
[50:36] I also learned another thing
[50:39] once you've got the Holy Ghost
[50:43] you've got that confidence that you have
[50:45] the Holy Ghost
[50:50] I stopped being scared
[50:53] to obedience why
[51:00] has given us a filter
[51:05] well it depends upon everyone's filter
[51:10] he's given us a filter of the word of
[51:12] God
[51:17] to take anything and pass it through
[51:20] that filter
[51:21] but I believe
[51:24] that we've got a good leader
[51:44] and thank God he's not here right now
[51:50] for many times
[51:54] we want the leaders to tell us what we
[51:57] want to do
[52:03] but once
[52:08] you're in position
[52:11] in the body of Jesus Christ
[52:15] you've got the Holy Ghost
[52:19] you know
[52:21] hombre that another man with the Holy
[52:25] Ghost
[52:26] isn't going to send you to do something
[52:28] wrong
[52:30] and if he sends you to do something
[52:32] wrong
[52:33] I believe it with my heart
[52:36] and if you comment to him
[52:38] he's willing to change
[52:47] our composure
[52:49] once again
[52:51] it's very important
[52:55] not just because we give a testimony
[53:01] to the rest of the world
[53:03] to our families
[53:06] but because
[53:08] there's many brothers
[53:11] that they're blessings
[53:13] in the Church
[53:20] isos of our actions
[53:23] and our Acts
[53:27] and this is sometimes espesado I've
[53:30] expressed but it's the truth
[53:35] that's why
[53:38] what is
[53:41] our position
[53:48] what do we desire
[53:51] S
[53:52] I believe that the best thing we can
[53:54] desire
[53:57] obviously it's the new birth
[53:59] and he'll take us
[54:02] onto our position
[54:04] our vediencia to obedience
[54:07] ASE and then Corazon I believe it in my
[54:11] heart
[54:12] it's a former group
[54:15] Santo where the Holy Spirit can manifest
[54:19] in every service Brothers
[54:23] take us into a Unity
[54:28] where there's love
[54:33] because it seems like ultimate lately
[54:39] amongst the people of the message
[54:42] or the people that believe in the
[54:45] message
[54:47] every day there's more divisions
[54:51] and when when on the contrary we should
[54:54] be more united
[54:56] what do we listen to who are we
[55:00] listening to
[55:03] por que podemuses
[55:06] because sometimes we can bring a curse
[55:08] onto our group
[55:14] our composure
[55:17] that's why it's important to know
[55:21] what is
[55:26] our position
[55:28] because the rest of the body
[55:31] depends it depends upon every one of us
[55:40] this evening
