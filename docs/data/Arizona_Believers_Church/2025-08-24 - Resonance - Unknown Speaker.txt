TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Psalm 92:es 1-6. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, oh most high, to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, upon an instrument of 10 strings, and upon the sultry upon the harp with a solemn sound. For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work. I will triumph in the works of thy hands. Oh Lord, how great are thy works, and thy thoughts are very deep. I love that. A brutish man knoweth not. Neither do a fool understand this. Amen. Very rich words. If we could just bow our heads in a word of prayer together, just praying. Our gracious heavenly father, as we have read this word, our desire is that you would bless it could uh open up our hearts to understand it, make it alive to us by revelation. We do realize that there's so many different faculties and things that stand in the way between the written word and the revelation of it in our hearts. But we trust that you today, Lord, can just drive away anything that would hinder, cast out any shadow. Just move freely in this service as this song service has just been tremendous and we sense your presence. We know that you're with us and there's a really good spirit and atmosphere in the church today. Just pray that you take control of this service for your glory. Bless all those that are here. Whatever needs they might have in their heart, whatever questions, whatever concerns, Lord, may it be Christ that is made re made real to them. I ask all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; You could take your seats. My title today is resonance. And I'll get to what that means maybe here just in a little bit or how I'm intending to use this resonance. As we've been on uh the subject or using the subject of music in these things, I believe that uh residence will be a kind of a concept that's easily to think about as we've been using these different themes on residence. Uh one thing just to maybe uh mention for those who are visiting and those who haven't heard some our last several services been looking at how that there's evil that exists in this world and that God is not known in the absence of evil but there is this paradox that it's the evil that even is declaring God even a lot of different ways that you could look at that and how over the last few services I hope there's been a little bit of a paradigm shift in how we view things that make us uncomfortable and in being willing to accept certain things that are limited ations or human weakness or mastering the thought of human ability. That's when God can reveal himself and make him known. Now, I'd like to start in Matthew 11 uh uh using this subject and this just one word titled resonance. It says in Matthew 11 13-15, for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John and if you will receive it, this is Elias or Elijah that was for to come. So here's Jesus saying that John the Baptist is not the literal Elijah, but he was in the spirit of Elijah that needed to come. He says, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." So it's very familiar phrase. I'm actually going to uh undertake uh take an effort to cover every scripture in the New Testament that uses this phrasing. I'm not going to try to break them all down. I think they their meaning uh may be evident, but I want to do it just to kind of overwhelm you with the breadth of it today here in a little bit. It says, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." Now, what is it that he's wanting them to hear? He says, "And if you will receive it, this is the Elijah that was prophesied to come." This word receive means to accept and not just to accept and some sort of mental ascent, but there's actually this idea of sustaining or bearing it. If you can receive this, if you can receive it, it means to embrace it or to make it your own. So, if somebody says something, you're like, "Well, I can accept that." Well, that that's more or less acknowledging that there might be something to it, but if you do receive it, you embrace it means to welcome in agreement. This is the Elijah that was to come. And instead of saying, well, that's plausible, or I could see that there's kind of like this response to say, I I I embrace that. I I'm willing to uphold that and sustain that. In Matthew 10:es 30, 39, and 40 says, he that findeth his life shall lose it. He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. That human instinct to try to preserve our lives runs counter to this idea that if you're just willing to be empty, to be bare, to be naked, that's where you'll find Christ. And in Christ there's life. We've covered that some a little bit lately. But it says, "He that receiveth you receiveth me." He tells them he's going to send them out. When we send you out, he that receives you uh uh um then he that receiveth you not. Then you're to reject them. But here he's saying if they receive you, they receive me. and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. You have to look at this in the sense of something being sent and as it goes out there's one that's there willing to receive or is receptive to the one that was sent. And it's not so much the person but even their message and their gospel. So this response to the word, this response to this is what I'm trying to tell you if you can receive it. It's to agree with and to sustain it. Can you agree? Can you agree? Can you accept this? Can you receive this? So when he says if you can receive this, he that hath ears to hear, let him hear. So this kind of maybe I think a further amplification of what he means by if you can receive this. Ears to hear. That phrase simply means that you have that faculty of understanding and knowing that will allow you to consider and to perceive and ultimately comprehend what I'm saying. He that hath ears to hear, the ability to understand, the ability to comprehend, the ability even to receive, the ability to sustain, to accept, let him hear. In other words, if you have the ability to comprehend, then apprehend it, comprehend it, be endowed with understanding. Learn, comprehend, understand it, grasp it, and hold it and sustain it. that we could see that by these words Jesus is not uh doing a mic check and say how many here can hear me if you can hear me raise your hand. He wasn't just wanting to make sure that the sound waves were reaching the ears. So it's beyond sound waves traveling through the outer ear and then causing the eardrum to vibrate and then this uh more vibrations are going to be in uh converted to electrical signals by hairs in your ear. Got to be careful how much you trim your air ear hair. Then it extends even further than just those electrical signals being sent to the brain through that auditory nerve and then interpreted. That's just the physical process of hearing sound. &gt;&gt; There is a there's uh I find it extremely uh fascinating how that people can hear certain sounds and discern immediately what it is. Uh even if it comes to birds and you look at this, oh that sounds just like this or whatever. And and no that's not it. You know it's that one has a gray tail. And you're like, "What? How do you know the one with the gray tail sounds that way?" But there's just this discernment of thought and that just we can all hear something, but do you hear? We might say sometimes, "I know you hear me, but are you listening, apprehending, accepting?" &gt;&gt; So when he says, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." He's saying, "He that has the ability to to receive, let him receive it." Right? &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 6:9, he said, "Go and tell this people, hear ye indeed, but understand not, and you see indeed, but perceive not." This is to the point of what he is saying that you hear, but you do not understand. I'm going to use a word that I'm wanting to emphasize throughout the service. I speak and my word doesn't resonate with you. It's not resonating with the hear. The hear isn't echoing in response to it. If you can receive it, this is the Elijah that was to come. If you can receive it, I am he that liveth forever more. And there's this different things in the scripture. You can say, "This is what the Bible says." And then can you receive it? In other words, there you're receptive to it. &gt;&gt; Jesus uses this scripture, Matthew 13:es 9-17. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. This is this common phrase that he uses over and over again. And the disciples came and said unto him, why speakest thou unto them in parables? Now we could say that he he's already somewhat addressed this or maybe even opened up the door for further questioning by saying if you have ears to hear then hear. If you can understand then understand. If you can grasp it, grasp it. Why do you speak in parables? And he answers in verse 11, because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. One has the ability to receive, the other one does not. &gt;&gt; For whosoever hath to him shall be given, he shall have more abundance. So in that ability to receive, you can receive more. But whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away, even that he hath. It's quite a a consequence. Therefore speak I to them in parables, but seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. That's the concept between behind. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear. He that has the ability to understand, let him receive understanding. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and see and you shall see and shall not perceive. For this people's heart is waxed gross. I guess that's better than your ears waxing gross. And their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears. And again this emphasis and should understand with their heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So beyond the physical capacity to see and the physical ability to hear there's some uh interpretation process or this processing wherein the mind will grasp and he says here that they understand with their heart and if this understanding they be converted and I should heal them. Then he says blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear. This is a different capacity. This is a different ability. For verily I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them. &gt;&gt; I heard a brother I believe from Africa one time say that God has given you an e a r in your h e a r t in order to h e a r. I was like I like that. You have an ear and your heart to hear. &gt;&gt; It's in the heart. A &gt;&gt; and that's for that's what God has given you. You see they have a heart. They have a mind. They have a spirit. They have the brain. They have the auditory nerve. Everything's working perfectly. I had a hearing test and I can hear I can hear a dog whistle. You know there you have perfect ears. But this is not what Jesus is talking about. &gt;&gt; Talking about a heart that is able to comprehend and to learn. &gt;&gt; And I'm wanting to use a phrase here because I see this in that Jesus is speaking the word and and how is it being received? I want to use this term resonance as a way of addressing this uh our lives and our attitude towards the word of God. Maybe a number of different ways that we could put this. And I found that as I began to as I've been studying on this and and leading up to this thought didn't know exactly where it would fit, there's a lot I realize that I I tend to get just get lost in it. And you realize that music is very mathematical. So it almost seems to be endless the way that you can look at it. There's a science of music. There's a science of resonance. There's all sorts of different elements. Uh if you really start getting into this and if you want to take an upper level course, just subscribe to my Patreon and and we'll get into it. But there is there's even ideas to resonance being tied to motive and music motive. So there's a lot there. I'm like, wow, this is amazing. I'm going to try to keep it very very simple that resonance is I might say the efficient transfer but the transfer and even amplification of energy at particular frequencies we can say that's resonant frequencies and so you you talk about some sort of physical system or musical instrument they vibrate with a greater amplitude at a specific or certain frequency and that's their resonant or natural frequency &gt;&gt; in Psalms 92:3 is he said hey it's good that we give thanks And that and we give praise. He says upon the instrument of 10 strings and upon the sultry and upon the harp with a solemn sound. So we know that in the context here he's saying great are thy works and they're wonderful. We're going to worship you. And he says a brutish man doesn't know neither does a fool understand this. So God's works are being done. And in them being done the fool doesn't understand. The brutish man doesn't understand. They don't comprehend it. The works are are vibrating. The works are radiating. The works are emitting. But yet the person who sees it can't or can't catch what it is as the hand of God. And I believe it's wonderful to see that there's this type or analogy or this representation of it in verse three where upon the instrument of 10 strings upon the sultry and upon the harp that there's one that would strike those strings and and strum those strings. And as they play, he says they play with the solemn sound or a resounding music or they resonate. &gt;&gt; A resonating sound. That would be a pleasing sound. It wouldn't be a a harsh sound that would make you repulse, but it's a pleasing sound because this resonance is it's really important in terms of producing music, making music, and even listening and enjoying or perceiving music. A lot of different ways that resonance shapes our our experience. But instead of getting, you know, further into that resonance aspect in music, there's this concept of in order for these instruments to give a a resonant sound or a solemn sound, the instrument has to be in tune. &gt;&gt; And I think this is uh there's a lot of different ways that we could demonstrate this that there a solemn sound implies that it's not just going up to a harp and going Right? And I know there's even something to the piano that if you start on one side and go all to the end, there's something pleasing about it. Right? Because that's the way that it's tuned. But this tuning is an intentional alignment of an instrument's resonance. So if an instrument has a natural frequency, when you tune it, uh uh there's this intentionality to it to where you want to tune its resonance. How is it vibrating? And this even applies to the alignment of a listener and how they align themselves. When you tune an instrument, you tighten a guitar string, you might open the trumpet's valve. There's different things that you can do. Even in singing, you can reshape your mouth. There's ways that you can uh take things to change your resonance or find that tune. And this is what I'm wanting to use as this natural principle. And in that the natural types, the spiritual, that there is a solemn sound. there's a resounding music. There's something vibrating and that something has to be tuned uh that that needs to be in that right tune in order for there to be that natural resonance. &gt;&gt; Now, this may be where it might seem like we slow down a bit, but I'm just I felt impressed to actually do this um almost just to overwhelm you. I'm often accused of that is a lot. Well, I want to keep my streak going. In Ezekiel 3 27, but when I speak with thee, I will open my mouth and thou shalt say unto them, thus sayaeth the Lord. So there is this tuning, this opening of the mouth. I'm going to shape my mouth. I'm going to speak words. There's going to be something vibrations that go forth. He that heareth, let him hear, and he that forbeareth, let him forebear, for they are a rebellious house. One that hears, and one that does not hear. one that will hear and then when he hears he yields he obeys. But the rebellious they will rebel. So he that heareth my words when I speak, when I open up my mouth, when I form these words, when they begin to be declared from you, let him that heareth and we could I maybe we can even take this and say he that has who heareth and actually can uh naturally discern the articulation and know the language that it's spoken. And then I hear what you're saying. I just don't agree with you. But he's saying, "He that hears, let him understand. Let him receive and accept." &gt;&gt; So it points out that there's this quality or characteristic of the hearer allowing the word to resonate in them. We might be able to say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; That the word says something and the hearer says, "I accept that. I receive that. I amen that." &gt;&gt; The one for forbears maybe is rejecting it. Now let's just look at this. I want to cover many scriptures. Uh, and we're doing it try to do it quickly, but I want to do this for emphasis. Matthew chapter 13:43, then shall the righteous shine forth as the son in the kingdom of their father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. Says it in Mark 4:9, he that hath ears to hear, let him hear. Verse 23, if any man have ears to hear, let him hear. Chapter 7 16, if any man have ears to hear, let him hear. Jesus repeating this over and over again, the same phrase, he that hath ears to hear, then hear. If you can hear, if you have the ability, now you might if I I guess maybe this is just me starting maybe to riff on this a little bit, but in other words, if you don't have ears, just admit it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I mean, if you can't hear, I think I told the story before where my dad was getting working for his his dad and he was on an army base and or a military base and didn't have the right credentials. I think it was the Marine base there in San Diego. And a guard walked up there and started saying, "Hey, I need to see your uh your permit, your licensing. You have to have a pass to work on the base." And my dad said, "No, ablings." And then the the MP began to rattle off perfect Spanish. And so he said, "Paul vu fr." You know, he had been had just admit it, right? Just admit you don't know. Admit you can't understand. Admit you don't hear. He said, "If you claim to know, if you claim to hear, then hear. Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; But if you don't hear, just admit it. &gt;&gt; Luke 8:8. Another fell on good ground. I know I'm not looking into the context of this. And sprang up and bear fruit hundfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." He says this over and over again. It has weight behind it. He has meaning. A and it doesn't just mean, "Did you hear me? I I want to be sure that you're writing this down and and I hope the acoustics are good enough." No. If you can understand it, understand it. &gt;&gt; It should at the very least prick our hearts to say, "Oh, I do want to understand. I do want to hear." &gt;&gt; Chapter 14:35. It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dung hill, but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. Jesus uses this. It's identified with him. It's a phrase that comes to uh be that he uses as the son of man over and over again to make his point. Then we find in the book of revelation 13:9 and if any man have an ear let him hear though those whose hearts have been circumcised by the spirit to hear the word in other to understand it to fall in love with it to for to provoke faith he that hath ears to hear let him hear in revelations chapter 2 and three we see that there's in the address of Christ to the messenger of each age and even to the age he Seven churches of Asia Asia. There is one characteristic attributable to each age or that is said, one phrase or saying that Christ says in every age. Revelations 2:7, he that hath ear to hear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcomemeth will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God. Verse 11, he that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. He that overcomemeth shall not be hurt of the second death. Verse 17. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcomemeth will I give to eat of the hidden man, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, saying, he that receiveth it. In verse 29, he hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. Chapter 3 6, he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. Verse 13, he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. Verse 22, he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. This is not this is not just some kind of passing phrase and we're just going to try and hang our hat on a comma, but we're looking at something that there's this over this emphasis over and over again of how words spoken, red letter words of Jesus Christ are being spoken and it's not in the ability to read or to hear from a natural intellectual academic standpoint, but it's like can you grasp this spiritually? How hard is your heart to where you can't receive it? How open are is your heart to receive the word? How trusting are you in God to reveal himself? &gt;&gt; How confident are you in your own ability &gt;&gt; to find truth? Or are you willing to be naked and let truth clothe you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pride is a nasty thing. &gt;&gt; It's pride that drove the Leodysans to say, "I've got all the answers. I'm rich and I'm increased with good. I have a need of nothing. I'm self- sustaining. I can figure this out. And doesn't realize that they're absolutely naked and don't have anything at all. The Bible says, "If you have an ear to hear, let them hear." That's the most critical thing. I if you if you're if you're blind, if you're naked, if you're wretched, if you're lying in darkness, if you have an ear to hear, then you can hear. Buy of me gold tried in the fire. Then you could hear what right white raignment that you may be clothed is that you may be may see. This is such a important characteristic and I believe it demonstrates the necessity of being tuned to the word of God and then staying in tune. &gt;&gt; It's that intentional alignment has to do with attitude. And I'm I'm focusing on this concept of resonance. But there it takes a tuning to meet that optimal frequency that that uh efficient transfer of energy in 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 5. I apologize I didn't have this do not have this scripture on a slide but I'll read it here for you. 2 Corinthians chapter 10:5 casting down imaginations and every high thing that exaltth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. This is a really good way of saying this is tuning. &gt;&gt; This is the process of tuning certain things out. Uh honing things in. And it says casting down imaginations. I believe I've referred to imagination uh quite frequently as of late. It's a subject that's merits its own examination. But here casting down imaginations, it's kind of like this doubtful thinking or pondering. And it's this imagination which is back and forth reasoning. That's right. &gt;&gt; Almost like an echo chamber. &gt;&gt; And I've emphasized this before, but I want to repeat it now that it given our human instincts and our human abilities. Imagination is one of our great strengths, one of our great abilities. And it's a our imagination that tries to fill the void through which grace wants to flow. &gt;&gt; That when I am weak, you are strong. Our imagination wants to fill in the weakness. Our imagination wants to reinterpret the weakness. Our imagination stares into the darkness. And what does it start to do? Interpret the darkness. &gt;&gt; It tries to explain evil. It tries to make sense of darkness. It tries to interpret the flaws. That's what imagination does. But remember, imagination is just a feeler. &gt;&gt; It's the devil's botox. &gt;&gt; It's a liar. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Imagination is what forms and manipulates images. &gt;&gt; There doesn't need to be a true one. You can just imagine it. &gt;&gt; AI is the manifestation of our imagination. &gt;&gt; It's not uh artificial intelligence. &gt;&gt; It's artificial imagination. &gt;&gt; It's just been synthesized. Think of the dreams you dream. And everybody's like, "Oh boy." Yeah. &gt;&gt; You were AI before there was AI, right? you were producing images and creating things and all sorts of weird stuff long before your computer could do it. &gt;&gt; And so it's the imagination. And listen, the imagination is like one of the greatest evils. If not, I don't mean to kind of try to change the whole narrative, but that's what he caused the woman to do in the beginning is to imagine &gt;&gt; something that didn't exist. &gt;&gt; Well, you don't really know what God means. And what did she do? She imagined &gt;&gt; where where you could create space, create wiggle room, create darkness, create a void. Our imagination hates it. Nature abhores a vacuum. Oh, I got I don't understand. I got to fill that in. I got to make sense of it. &gt;&gt; You know what will do? Your imagination. &gt;&gt; But when you just say, "I'm going to cast that down." &gt;&gt; It leaves an emptiness and it leaves a void. And therefore, where there's a void and there's an absence, grace or God can step into that. But as long as we fill up the uncomfortable space with ourselves and our imagination, God will never step in. &gt;&gt; Because imagination fills in the gaps that grace wants to fill. &gt;&gt; It is our great human ability that we have to master what the thought, &gt;&gt; the imagination of human ability. &gt;&gt; We're not just This could be said of everything. Anything that exists is comprised of certain elements, electrons, atoms, and then what do they do? They vibrate. &gt;&gt; It's a vibration. I'm not going to get into some of the witchcraft on holistic healing. You know, like I can just whack you over the head with a tuna salad and that the vibrations of that omega-3 acids or fats in the tuna will will cleanse your colon. But we're talking about all of us. Even as humans, we're not lifeless, inanimate objects. &gt;&gt; All nature vibrates. &gt;&gt; And with vibrations, it interacts with forces. This is true of everything. That's why we have sound. That's why there there's motion and movement with everything. Anything that has life, anything that is comprised of natural elements vibrates. &gt;&gt; And that's what instruments are in a musical context. They're just they're they're systems that essentially produce vibrations or frequency. And it's those vibrations that we translate to sound. And so the tuning when you tune something, it's that process of adjusting the pitch until it forms that desired arrangement, that natural frequency or vibration, the natural resonance. I want us to consider our own lives in terms of how uh you know are what how what how does God resonate with us? There's good and there's evil. Does good resonate with you or does evil? &gt;&gt; It's a good question. Which way are we tuned? &gt;&gt; How are we aligned? What I if there's things in the world and we hear things in the world and we feed on it is do we um listen to a podcast and we hear Nancy in Tennessee's draft board for the fantasy draft. Uh do we resonate with her number one pick? Like is that where we're like, you know, she's got some really good good thoughts on this. I appreciate her hot sports opinions. I'm going to take a tight end with my number one pick. That that should tell you something. I mean, if those things are easy to grasp, but then the word of God come, &gt;&gt; right? There's a certain alignment or tuning in your spirit where you're more sensitive to the vibrations of the world &gt;&gt; and less in tune to the spiritual things of God. &gt;&gt; Galatians 5:16, this I say then, walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. I I I I want everyone to read this. Let's try to read it together. or those who brought your Bibles or your apps or those of you who have it intuitively by holistic reading. Walk in the spirit and you shall It's homeopathic is what I'm going for there. Walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. &gt;&gt; Say it. Walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. I feel like a real church now. &gt;&gt; That is thus sayaith the Lord. Walk in the spirit. There's a a channel there. There there there's a pocket, an envelope. You're in it. &gt;&gt; Walk in the spirit. I I found this frequency. I found this channel. I want to walk in the spirit. And as long as I'm in that spirit, I cannot I will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. &gt;&gt; There's something that's being emphasized here in terms of this continuity of walking in the spirit. Resonance is not just about frequency, but it's about coherence. And all the musicians said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." Didn't expect Brother Andrew Coffee to be the one to pick up on that, but I'm happy nonetheless. He is a doctor and stayed at a Holiday in Express recently. Resonance is not only about frequency or vibrations, but coherence. The lust of the flesh are those things that are in congruent with Christ. There are lust of the flesh which are antirist that aren't congruent with the spirit, the fruits of the spirit. Walk in the spirit. This particular tuning or subjection to the spirit and there's a way in which those things get canceled out. &gt;&gt; Coherence in music is when different sounds work together without interference. &gt;&gt; Don't mean to make the sound guys uncomfortable, but we all know what interference can sound like. When energy is coherent, nature responds with resonance. &gt;&gt; That powerful powerful amplification of energy. Could be energy, but we're talking about a powerful amplification. And so when there's sound waves and there's frequencies, the sound waves can overlap &gt;&gt; and when they overlap, they can either reinforce each other or they cancel each other out. I hope that you can begin to think about this very deeply that there can be ways or vibrations from the word of God and if they can overlap in such a way to where you're causing them to cancel out &gt;&gt; because it's it's not tuned &gt;&gt; it the timing if resonance teach taught me anything timing is important &gt;&gt; and so when they overlap correctly it's called constructive interference It's when these these waves of energy align in a phase. And I don't know that my hand motion should be interpreted as being accurate. Uh objects in this image may be larger than they appear. But it accumulates when they are in a line. When they sink in a phase, when they align. This energy is aligning in a phase. It accumulates with each cycle. It's getting stronger. These on an instrument. These periodic forces, they sync with the instruments natural resonance. It's natural vibrations or oscillation and it allows energy to build. And if you're if you're confused about this, as I studied and read this, a lot of different places give this example. Wikipedia is one of them about the example of being on a swing. You're pushing your child on a swing. So all of us now can begin to say, "Okay, here we are. This is starting to make more sense." And you know when you get on a swing, there's even a way where your own rhythm. You got to know just the right time to pull and when to push, right? When the legs are kicked out, let's go back. If you want to, you really want to enjoy and get a kick. Watch me do chair exercises and try to get my left arm to do differently than my left leg and things like that. It's like got to get things in sync. And so if you want to swing, you want to know the right moment to push and to pull, to kick. And so if you're pushing someone on a swing that if you at the right moment if you just give it you give it another push what begins to happen not even necessarily increasing uh force but just that consistent and it's going to it gets it it begins to swing with this greater momentum and the more force you can give it if you catch it in its natural rhythm it amplifies and amplifies where each welltimed push adds energy in the same direction as the motion &gt;&gt; and this is what this is how you you build it builds. It's one comes this way as the energy's coming. If another inter if another force or frequency interacts with it and it's constructive and it aligns, there's more energy. &gt;&gt; In John 10:es 24-31 says, "Then came the Jews round about him and said unto him, how long does thou make us doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly." I love this. There was this attitude of we just can't be sure. &gt;&gt; Jesus answered them,"I told you and you believed not." &gt;&gt; I told you &gt;&gt; the works that I do in my father's name, they bear witness of me. But ye believed not because you are not of my sheep as I said unto you. It's it's not a question of well, we just we're not sure because he doesn't say. He kind of hides it. It's ambiguous. He's saying you you won't believe me because you're not of my sheep. My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me. Here's that voice. That that child's ability to know their parents' voice. And I give them unto them eternal life and they shall never perish. Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. I tried to find a musical connection there. There's not one. My father which gave them me is greater than all. And no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand. I and my father are one. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's this this constructive overlapping, this synergy, this he's resonating. I am my father one. Here I am. I am declaring the father. I'm speaking of the father. Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. Again to stone him. In other words, he had told them before. They just didn't believe it. &gt;&gt; There was no, if I could say, resonance established. The word was not striking a resonant tone in their heart. If anything, it was some as the word went forth and it's vibrating and it's coming. It was they it it struck them away. &gt;&gt; And we could even look at this in the sense that say, well, I'm either I'm either uh elect or non-elect. But I want to I want to look at this in the sense of the tuning. &gt;&gt; There's many that walked with them that then repented or that walked away. And then there's those who fought him then that relent. Like what was Paul doing when he was blaspheing? he was out of tune. &gt;&gt; You could have incorrect tuning. Something's tuned a certain way and it's just completely out of tune. Or it, as people who live in Arizona know that the wrong kind of atmosphere, really, really hot or dry, can damage and warp an instrument in places of high humidity. It can change the tuning of an instrument. And so the atmosphere and environment can significantly re uh reduce what's called tuning stability &gt;&gt; or the tune stability begins to lose its tune by the atmosphere. the environment. What do you think happens when we immerse ourselves in worldly things? &gt;&gt; You don't become unelect. &gt;&gt; I I can't binge watch the whole Star Wars tri trilogy or whatever it is. I'm not sure which one it is or how many there are, but whatever prequels, sequels, or midquels there are, you can't just binge that and become non-elect. &gt;&gt; But you can severely get out of tune. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You get out of tune and the next thing you know something happens or something is said and and you read something or you hear something and it's just not resonating with you. You're not moved by it. &gt;&gt; You're you're you're you could just sit there and kind of hear the greatest sermon that brother Aaron ever preached and just kind of like &gt;&gt; like you're you're not even in tune enough to know that he's doing better. Like is he eating his waties? What's going on here? Whatever you're doing, keep doing it, buddy. Right? You're just tuned out. &gt;&gt; Got to have it. And it's influences and factors that de-une us. &gt;&gt; These that were hearing his voice, they were they were out of tune. &gt;&gt; Chapter 5, the same thing happens. We'll just read verses 37 to 38. And the father himself which has sent me have borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape. But yet there was something now that's declaring it. And ye have not his word abiding in you. For he whom he hath sent him ye believe not. Here they are walking with the Messiah. And they lack the ability to respond in the right way to Christ. He's ma making himself known. He's vibrating. These vibrations are striking their hearts, their eyes, their ears, their whole life. They're seeing signs and wonders and miracles. And what do they become? Brutish. They become foolish. They're not receptive. They they take the miracles, the signs, and the wonders, and everything that he says, and they start twisting it and tearing it apart. They're not tuned to it. &gt;&gt; And I want us to understand this. I was even going to use the scripture in Acts where he says, King Agria says, "Man, Paul, you almost persuaded me to be a Christian." &gt;&gt; Almost. What was King Fesus said, "You're mad, Paul, you're insane. Think about the stuff you're trying to say. You want me to believe this? You want me to believe that? This is silly. This doesn't make sense. There's nothing to this." And Paul said, 'I I wish you were just like me except for my bonds. And he even looked at agria says, 'You know deep down in your heart. You know I'm not mad. &gt;&gt; You know, you know I'm not mad. You know the things I say to you are true. And what did agria said? Almost persuaded. &gt;&gt; And I want us to recognize that our spirits are susceptible to the same dynamic &gt;&gt; if our hearts are not tuned to his word. unbelief in and even doubting or just manifestations of a lack of tuning to the word &gt;&gt; when you have uh if there's constructive interference and I think that's what we all try to run right I'm trying to run some constructive interference here but there's also destructive interference and what's remarkable I alluded it to it to it a moment ago constructive interference is when uh waves of even the same frequency align line, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and so they they align together and therefore it amplifies it. Clarity when it resonates clarity &gt;&gt; from a musical perspective. That's what gives us this pleasure and this enjoyment of a sound. But destructive interference is when two wavelengths of the same frequency, the same frequency, they overlap incorrectly and the amplitudes cancel. &gt;&gt; Right? So you can have something traveling in the same frequency like this is the way it should be and then something else just gets out of tune and out of sync. It's of the same frequency and instead of it saying oh wow this is this is right this is right they cancel each other out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you thinking about that? &gt;&gt; Very simple very simple thought. This is why tuning is so important. Galatians chapter 5 25. If we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spirit. If we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spirit. If an object resonates at a frequency, anything with the same natural resonance responds. I I almost felt like I was breaking new ground. Nobody's ever thought of that before. If a object with a certain natural frequency resonates at that frequency, anything of the same frequency is affected by it, responds. &gt;&gt; In other words, that frequency activates, it vibrates, &gt;&gt; starts vibrating at the same frequency. Guitar I'll maybe get into maybe more of this on Wednesday night. I think a guitar string plucked, a certain chord plucked will resonate another guitar that's not being played. That same string that's tuned that it begins to vibrate in response. &gt;&gt; Not even being played. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What happens when the new birth comes into our lives? Our soul is tuned to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Our soul is a and the soul is sealed by the new birth. That's the that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You're sealed by one spirit. We're all baptized into one body. And so the soul then has that sense of faith. What resonates what the frequency that's on and what it resonates with is faith. The word of God. &gt;&gt; Faith and the word of God. They align in that phase. And that that's the that's the resonance. Faith is going to the word's going to resonate with your faith. &gt;&gt; Yet we still have this body and this spirit that stands in between. And it's praying. And I say these are very simple concepts, but praying and reading our Bibles are critical to staying keeping our spirits in tune. &gt;&gt; That our soul being sealed is it's going to resonate with the word of God. But if you if you have these other things happening in your spirit, then that it's not going to get there. There's maybe artificial dampeners. There's things that are keeping the word from getting to your heart because your spirit needs tuning by prayer &gt;&gt; and by reading your Bible. &gt;&gt; I will say this, if your soul is not tuned, and I think maybe I can make this uh uh make it this part of that fulcrum to get to the end. I Lord willing, I'd like to be uh more than just physically short today. I would like to be able to be short in my sermon because I've been going too long lately. If only long sermons could make you taller. Some people would be like 80 feet tall. &gt;&gt; But if your soul is not tuned, you'll spiritually be in and out of tune &gt;&gt; based solely on external forces. &gt;&gt; If the soul is not tuned to the word, anything can come by tune you. &gt;&gt; Anything. &gt;&gt; Somebody could come by and say, "Oh, no, that's not right. Let me tune you to uh to this. Right? You're like, you're now now you're playing in the tune of an eighth messenger. Right? I'm playing in the tune of tapes only. I'm playing in the tune of this. I'm playing the tune of that. And then somebody else comes by and goes tweaks you a little bit and all of a sudden now you can sing a different tune. If your soul is not tuned by the birth, the o your only the only way you can be tuned at that moment is essentially artificially by external forces in your spirit or your mind. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says if we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spirit. If we are made alive by the spirit, then the word should resonate in our lives. &gt;&gt; If we live in the spirit, if the spirit is alive in you, then the word the spirit is going to resonate in you. And what is therefore pure in the soul resonates outside in the life that you live. &gt;&gt; The reason why you see some people's lives, they read like a soundwave up and down and in and out is because the soul is not tuned. &gt;&gt; The question of resonance has to do with what we have allowed to tune ourselves. Is your soul tuned by the new birth? If you say amen to that and you know it, then how's your spirit been tuned? &gt;&gt; Have you been allowing the spirit on the inside, the inside teacher to tune your mind, your thoughts, casting down imaginations? &gt;&gt; Have you been allowed, are you allowing that further fine-tuning and cleansing of your mind, the the purification of thought? Has that process h happening? If not, what's going to begin to happen then is your spirit gets out of tune, there's going to be some destructive interference with the frequencies in your soul. &gt;&gt; In 1 Thessalonians 1:es 2 to9, we give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers, remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our father. That was an email. That'd be quite a opening, right? Knowing brethren, beloved, your election of God. For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power was not inanimate. It was not lifeless. It wasn't just hearing, but it came with you with vibrations, in frequency, in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance as you know what men or men we were among you for your sake. And you became followers of us and of the Lord. So they were followers of Paul. They weren't ashamed to say that they followed Paul and the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost. Notice these elements wherein they had received the word. The word sounded it came forth not just in word but there was frequencies and vibrations and they were tuned to it. They could receive the word so that you were in samples examples to all that believe in Macedonia and Akaya. For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Aaya but also in every place your faith to God were to spread abroad so that we need not to speak anything. That word there sounded out. That's resonated, &gt;&gt; resounding. The word preached echoed back out of them. &gt;&gt; From you sounded out the word of God. The word struck something that that could receive the word, was tuned to the word, and they echo it back. From you resounded, from you resonated the word. For they themselves show us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turn tuned to God from idols to serve the living and true God. Resonance. We talk about resonance. It's a vibrating response to an outside sourc's wavelength frequency. It's this response to that vibration. What's our response? What do we tune to? What do we resonate with? have two closing scriptures. In Galatians chapter 2 verse 20, this theme in Galatians was just really speaking to me. He says, "I'm crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live." There's a paradox. Then the reason uh the fact that he writes it this way, I mean, why why didn't he just say, "I am crucified with Christ uh and I don't live." But he says, "I live." Yet not I. It's not the eye that lives, &gt;&gt; the eye of imagination, &gt;&gt; the eye of self, &gt;&gt; but Christ liveth in me, &gt;&gt; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that this is necessarily the case with us here or any of you here, but there's some subtle nuances here that may go unnoticed. seems evident to us. I'm crucified with Christ and the life that I now live, if I'm living at all, the life I live now humanly in this life is a life that is lived by the faith of the son of God who loved me, gave himself for me. When Paul says, "I'm crucified with Christ and having died, it's now Christ who's alive in my soul." If we live in the spirit, let us walk in the spirit. If you walk in the spirit, you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. &gt;&gt; This expression now of I'm crucified with Christ and Christ lives in me. Then he that is living in me is now the life I live &gt;&gt; because it's by the faith of the son of God. Let me say it this way before let me say let me introduce this principle before I go further. An instrument a stringed instrument in particular can be tuned to itself. &gt;&gt; In other words, you could take you could take a a guitar that's been sitting acoustic guitar that's just been sitting in a in a hot garage or a humid environment. You could pick it up and go like, "Oh, that's awful." Well, you could tune it to itself, &gt;&gt; right? just if you know what order those strings should be tuned to. And so just by sound, you could tune it to where now when you play it, it doesn't sound so awful. &gt;&gt; So you could tune something to itself, but it's still out of tune. &gt;&gt; And you wouldn't notice until another instrument in tune plays. So, let me say this and and if you take notes, you I I would I'd say write it down and at least chew on this 40 times like my grandma used to tell me to do before I swallowed. We should not Well, I guess I I guess I realize I have it here. So, that's I didn't realize I put that on there. Your life should not be in your faith. I I I know this might seem a little bit like you guys are getting ready to leave. Hold on. Just be patient. &gt;&gt; You cannot stake your life on your faith in Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm all in on my faith. I believe. I believe. I'm all in on what I see. I'm all in on what I receive. I'm all in on it. This is what I believe. That is nothing more than self-tuning. that you can be all in on your faith in Jesus Christ and your faith represents your individual standard of what Christ is. &gt;&gt; You're tuned to your own standard. &gt;&gt; I'm all in on my faith in Jesus Christ. No, don't do that. That could be a house of cards. &gt;&gt; We must not stake everything on our faith in Christ, but rather we must put all of our self and our life in Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to live by my faith in Christ. &gt;&gt; I don't want to hang my hat on my faith. &gt;&gt; I I don't want to stake everything on my faith in the word of God, in the message, in the Bible, in in God. I want my life to be hid in Christ. I want to be abandoned to Jesus Christ. I I want to be stripped and laid bare of every pretense, every interpretation, every ideology, every adultery, every idol, everything. Strip me bare. I can only be safe if I've invested all that I am in my life is solely in Jesus Christ himself &gt;&gt; because he alone is the tuning standard. James 4:es 6 to10 says, "But he giveth more grace." Well, how can I get grace? I need more grace. Remember, your imagination is a damn to grace. It's going to block it. It's going it's going to cause when it sees that it's going to be a filler. Imagination the is going to artificially fill what grace wants to organically and genuinely and real truly fill. So he says he resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble. Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he shall flee from you. submitting yourself to God. There's your I am submitting myself not to my faith. I'm submitting to God. &gt;&gt; I'm going to uh walk in the spirit. Submit myself. I if I have the spirit, I'm made alive in the spirit. Then I'm also going to walk in the spirit because if I walk in the spirit, I will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. So draw nigh to God and he'll draw nigh to you. &gt;&gt; There's this tuning tuning of hearts seeking his face. Cleanse your hands you sinners. Purify your hearts you double minded. This is even this inward purity. This inward tuning inward sanctification. Now this speaks to this repentance, this void, this feeling that none of us want to feel. Be afflicted and mourn and weep. Can you imagine this? I'm having the hardest time and my life's been turned upside down and so this there's this is happening and that's happening and it's just so dark and it's just so dark and someone says just laugh just laugh a little just look at it and giggle. Paul is saying be afflicted mourn and weep and let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy joy to heaviness. Stop pretending. Stop imagining. &gt;&gt; Stop giving hiding behind the eye. But humble yourself repentance. &gt;&gt; Be afflicted, mourn, weep. Experience the heaviness. &gt;&gt; Humble yourselves, he says, in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you up. &gt;&gt; I know we look at that. Resist the devil and he'll flee. But kind of what's what's in the middle of all this is he says, "Well, I'm crucified with Christ and it's Christ that now lives in me. And that life is Christ made alive. It's his faith that lives in me. It's not I anymore." &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Submit your humble yourself in the sight of the Lord and he will lift you up." That's the dynamic by which Satan flees &gt;&gt; is not because you've all of a sudden just had this power to boom. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Like Street Fighter, you just figured out, right, and all a sudden the opponent just explodes. You're like, "Man, that was awesome. What just happened?" &gt;&gt; But it's the submission to God. &gt;&gt; It's the yielding to God that as you yield to him and the weaker you get, the more he lifts you up above the unpure minds, above the the the double-minded. Draw an eye to God and he will draw nigh unto you. This is a weapon. &gt;&gt; Amen. draw nigh, he draws nigh. This resonance, humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord. Be tuned. Let me say this resonance with God is more powerful than all your individual resisting of evil. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All our intellectual resistance, all our emotional resistance. This is the danger of emotionalism, intellectualism, which is all imaginary faith. This is the danger of it is that's all in that realm of human lifting up the human part &gt;&gt; instead of just re resonating saying amen to and submitting and yielding to God. &gt;&gt; As you tune to God's word and as you get to that same frequency and there's constructive interference, it's an amplification of energy. &gt;&gt; This is how people are able to break glass with their voice. This is why there's certain How many have tried before to splash as much water out of the pool as we can, &gt;&gt; right, brother John? Right. Get in there and just try to get as much water out as you want. How what's the best way to do it? Everybody get in sync. &gt;&gt; Right. When you go opposite, when you're going opposite, it it's not going to be as you're not going to get as much momentum, as much power. So when you resonate with God in his word, that's where the true power lies &gt;&gt; is in resonance. &gt;&gt; And we could just simply say, well, yeah, that doesn't resonate with me. That's fine. That's fine. But how are you tuned? &gt;&gt; What's tuned you? &gt;&gt; Are you tuned to the word of God? musicians as you could come to your places on your instruments. A lot of different things that we could continue on in this moment, but I want to close with this. In the book, Pursuit of God, the pursuit of God, Awtoer writes some really extraordinary things in that. And at this particular portion of the book, I think is it maybe around page 60 or something maybe just depending on which book you're reading, he's talking about this inward uh inwardly beholding God. But that's that's what we ought to do is this inward beholding God. Uh and then he begins to talk about this this outward manifestation of that that when you inwardly behold God, it's inescapable that there'd be some sort of outward purity. And as he's talking about reading your Bible and praying and fellowship and going to church and all these things that we might say are measurables where we just we can pull out the little chart and say, "Well, who's got a star next to their name uh this month for having a skirt to the ground? Anybody?" Right? It's it said there's this he says I'm not I'm not advocating for all this this external you may feel that I'm emphasizing it too much but he wants to he wants to make this point that how how is it that we would all be inwardly beholding God and how is it that we could all be really seeking Christ and looking at his face and reading the same Bible and praying to the same God. He's saying, "How is it that we would come out of that from inwardly beholding God and then have all this clash externally or this individuality and one does this and one does that?" And he says, "Has it ever occurred to you that 100 pianos all tuned to the same fork or automatically tuned to each other?" Did somebody use this recently? Anybody Does this not sound really familiar? Maybe I dreamed it, but it might have been brother Ellie Ezer who used it or some somebody I thought recently maybe have used used this example of how if something if everything's tuned to the same thing, then they're all they're tuned to each other. &gt;&gt; I don't have to I don't have have to ask brother Marvin uh give me a give me a sound and and start humming and then I'm just going to har I'm just going to find his pocket and I'm going to hum with him. It's not we're trying to feed off of one another and balance and level out and tune to each other. But all pianos, a 100 pianos, I think that would have made a great sermon title. 100 pianos, all tuned to the same tuning fork, are automatically tuned to each other. They are of one accord by being tuned not to each other, but to another standard to which each one must individually bow. &gt;&gt; This is the gospel. Jesus Christ is that standard that we must all individually bow to. &gt;&gt; So 100 worshippers meeting together, each one looking away to Christ are in heart, listen please, I'm almost done, in heart near to each other than they could possibly be were they to become unity conscious and turn their eyes away from God to strive for closer fellowship. If right now we abandoned the tuning standard, if right now we said, "You know what? Let's just let our minds go blank and let's just focus on harmony and unity this. Let's just let's just be one with each other and let's let's help each other and let's h uh whatever we might want to use. I I'm not even capable of that godly good. Maybe if I had red hair and a and could put in a ponytail, I could really riff in a funny way about uh you know the way some people think. But he's saying we could not possibly be closer to each other if we actually made unity a conscious effort &gt;&gt; in strove for unity than if we all individually inwardly beheld God. We're tuned in our souls. He says social religion is perfected. I take it in the way that I believe he means it. But this outward practice of being a Christian, this external manifestation of good works and the fruits of the spirit. Social religion is perfected when private religion is purified. &gt;&gt; The purity that we strive for is inward purity. But we don't lie to ourselves and say that what is outwardly impure doesn't accurately reflect on what what is inwardly pure. The body becomes stronger as its members get healthier, become healthier. The whole church of God gains when the members that compose it begin to seek a better and a higher life. It's beautiful stuff. a hundred pianos tuned to the same tuning fork are automatically tuned to each other. If we could just get try to get out of our minds of who who we agree with in the message. Brother Joseph Brandom, I don't know if it was when it was, but he was announcing a communion service and in it he's writing about who are you going to believe? This pastor that says this, this preacher that says this, this one that says that, this one that says I'm reading this. I'm like I'm like, man, these are all really good questions. I don't need to try to tune myself to that pastor. I don't need to tune myself. I don't need to tune myself to this interpretation. I don't need to tune myself to that. I'm not trying to tune myself to what brother Joseph Brandham's trying to say. I don't even try to tune myself to brother Brandham. If I can just get tuned in with the Christ that he's tuned with, then I will automatically be tuned in with him &gt;&gt; and anybody else for that matter that's willing to be tuned by Christ. Right? &gt;&gt; If I'm trying to tune my faith to your faith, this is going to be some weird symphony. &gt;&gt; That's going to be a bohemian rap city. But listen, if we'll be willing to tune ourselves, tune ourselves individually, tune ourselves inwardly, seek a greater, better, higher life and strive to behold Christ the word and be willing to be tuned to his word. &gt;&gt; Then I'll be automatically tuned. &gt;&gt; I'll be tuned. We'll be tuned to one another. May be a process. This is this dry heat here may may make it hard at times, but God's working on us, tuning us to resonate with his word. If we could stand together today, pray together. Resonance. There's more to get into. Lord willing, I'd like to address the idea of that sympathetic resonance. And when something vibrates at a certain frequency, if you're tuned to that, you will naturally, supernaturally, if it's the word, vibrate right back in the same frequency. Our gracious heavenly father, today, as we draw this service to a close, I solemnly submit. I just relent. And I leave this with you, Lord, to deal with the people's hearts as you see fit. But may there be a a [Music] a resonating Lord. I even think of the principle that if things are if there's a common joining part that pendulums even in opposite timing will eventually stabilize and be in harmony. And Lord, if my swing is not swinging with your word, then Lord, I just pray that those vibrations continue to hold and bring me in resonance with you. this constructive interference. Lord, many times we read the Bible and we are looking into the word of God and we look into our hearts and there's things that aren't in time. They're not in sync. And so those we believe them to be the word of God. And when they don't align in a phase, instead of there being faith that's triggered, they actually cancel each other out. There's no benefit. And where there's the cancelling, where there's the void, our imagination fills in the silence. Lord, may we throw off these noiseancelling headphones of the world, be tuned to your voice, &gt;&gt; and not be afraid to be tuned ourselves. We're so grateful that there is a powerful dynamic of your word that you are alive and that at the end of the day I must be willing to admit and to accept that within myself not even my own faith is good but that I'm willing to stake my life on you such that my this is not a house of cards. I'm on Christ, the solid rock, &gt;&gt; and not I'm not staking everything on my faith in Christ, but I'm staking everything on Christ, the true standard, the way, the truth, the life. Bless us today. May we receive encouragement from this word. May we go through our lives and find those false tuning forks. Lord, look into our habits and our patterns of how we just find our spirits and our minds sometimes being more tuned to things of the world where we resonate with worldly things as opposed to your spirit. and those things which are pure. We love you Lord. We commit ourselves to you now. Praying that you bless the remainder of this service and our days together in the name Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
