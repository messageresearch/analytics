TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and uh beloved out of this scripture we just want to talk on theim and tomim tonight the and the Tom him now we know that God did not just set the priesthood but he also designed everything that goes with it as he gave Moses the pattern as to how the Tabernacle look like even the division the partition or the various courts we know that all came from Heaven because the Lord said as you have been shown do it and so the priesthood in itself was also a designed thing that God gave to the prophet Moses you know the priests have their own way of dressing and when the high priest is robed there is something that they put on their chest which is called the Yum and the Tom Hallelujah and this Tom him it was of beauty and Glory you know it was not just anything at all that God made Moses to use but he used precious stones it was just like an April and it have 12 Stones in it and uh these 12 Stones each of them represent a tribe in Israel Hallelujah so it depicts the beauty and glory of the entire nation called Israel so he used the colorless and Precious Minerals let us go quickly to Exodus chapter 28 Exodus 28 we will read from verse 15 he said and thou shall make the breastplate of judgment with Cannon work after the work of the OT thou shall make it of gold of blue and of purple and a scarlet and of fine twine linen shall thou make it four square it shall be being doubled a span shall be the length thereof and a span shall be the breath thereof and thou shall set in it settings of stones even four rows of stones the first rle shall be a sadus a topas and a cabun they shall be the first rle and the second row shall be an emerald a surfire and a diamond and the third row a ligor an agate and an amethyst Hallelujah and the fourth row a Buel and an onx and a Jasper they shall be set in gold in their enclosing and the stone shall be with the names of the children of Israel 12 according to their names like the Engravings of a Signet everyone with his name shall they be according to the 12 tribes Hallelujah you know so this Ur man atomium was designed to contain the representation of the 12 tribes of Israel and as we were told he said it is for beauty and for Glory but the main purpose of the H and the Tom the prophet said that it was judgment it Bears judgment Hallelujah for the people of Israel to guide against falsehood that was the main purpose of this and the Tom and you know that the the high priest don't go into the presence of God without it because as a high priest whatever you are going into the presence of God there must be sincerity in you yes sir there must be truth in you anything or any anything that is in you must be righteous right you know the reason why they put rope okay if you are careful they put robe before their waist they tied it and it stretched out from the from the temple right the reason is that perhaps if this high priest goes before the Lord unrighteously and the Lord give him a blow yeah and he died nobody dare go to the presence of God so you know they will use that rope to pull him to pull the the cops and go and drump him somewhere so so we realize that when we are going into the presence of God we must be full of righteousness but remember the Bible says that you and I our righteousness are as filthy as rocks there is nothing good in us hallelujah that is why God gave us Jesus Christ to represent us hallelujah so we see the righteousness of God in Jesus Christ as our righteousness that is the reason why the high priest was allowed to put this Y and theim on his chest to guide against falce because people will get up and they say I have a dream people will get up and they say I have that say of the Lord people will get up and say that the Lord told me this the Lord told me that and when they tell you and you put it by the word of God you realize that it falsehood and everybody want to be believed everybody want to bring out something new when they sleep and they dream they want to come to put it upon the people to confuse them to deceive them and God didn't want that to go on so God said that Moses build the and Tom and put it on the chest of the of the priest right wherever you hang it it if anybody get up and say well I have that here the Lord let the person go and stand before the hear him and him and let him Proclaim let him say whatever he said the L he claimed that the Lord have told him if those tones don't come in agreement to flash take that person to be false if anybody have a dream and claim that I God have given him a dream or a dream let him go and stand by the and in front of the and him let him say his dream if those stones don't come in agreement in flash it means it is false so that was the main work of the uim and the tomim Hallelujah today we thank God that we also have the Y and the Tom yes as much as the people in the days of Moses will not go scut free for falsehood right today if anybody want to go with falsehood that person also will not go scull free because you'll be exposed Hallelujah you will be exposed by the and the Tom that we have in this end time Hallelujah in our day in our day like this the and the Tom is the revealed world that you are believing that is a that is where the light of God is shining anything that comes to you anything that you hear even as I preach to you right now you have the her and the Tom to determine whether it is true or false Hallelujah you have the right to determine because you have the Heim and the Tom him today which is the revealed word the message of this hour full of light that Glitter it shines amen any place we are we shine because wherever you see when you are walking in light yes you see clearly okay when you are walking in light you can see anything clear but when you are walking in darkness it is very difficult to see or to determine whether you are going to hit an object because you are in darkness right but when you are walking in light there may be obstacles in your way but because you are in the light you see those obstacles and you go around it is that clear Hallelujah so that is what this message of the hour God have given to you and I that is the work he's doing for us it has brought light to us amen and today by God's grace we are walking in the light amen I remember in those days when we were in the denominations you know the the denomination they have good names but they don't have the light of God right were walking the way we wanted any everybody was doing whatever he wanted like last Sunday I was telling the church I said look when we were in the denominations we had our names on the books of the churches but we couldn't have Jesus Christ name in our heart Hallelujah but when the grace of God fell upon us and he met us with the message of this hour and we believe the word of God from that time we see the name of Jesus Christ in our hearts and we have our names also in him amen because he said if you believe in me you will know that day you will know that I am in you and you in me Hallelujah because I am in the father so we become one with Jesus Christ am and that is what the power of God has done for you and I am Hallelujah so this uim and the Tom guide against falsehood that is the truth anything that comes up on it and the light begin to flash it means it is the truth amen the uim and the Tom is here you and I also we are shining today Hallelujah as it was on the chest of the high priest today it is the word of God that is on our hearts amen hallelujah like the prophet Paul said amen he said we should put on us the Blessed bre of righteousness on our chest perhaps we can read it from the Bible right now Ephesians chapter 6 amen let's Ephesians chapter 6 you can read the whole chapter if you so wish but let me just um pick it from okay verse 11 okay verse 10 okay that would be good he said finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand yeah may be able to with stand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loes get about with truth amen and having on the Blessed PR of righteousness Hallelujah that is where the Y and tumim you know placed and your feet short with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith where withth ye shall be able to quench all the fairy DS of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of spirit which is the word of God hallelujah you see so when we as Believers today no matter our condition no matter our situations when we are able to put this in us oh brother we become a mighty Soldier we become Mighty Army that are ready to go to battle with Victory amen hallelujah because no Army no Army will prepare for war and think of going to lose every strategy that they take is to go and win the battle but how will you win the battle when you didn't strategically prepare Hallelujah and God in his wisdom have given a strategy to overcome the very doubt of the enemy and this is the secret of our weapon Hallelujah to guide us okay from falsehood and unrighteous unrighteousness yes amen now let's listen to what the prophet said here I'm quoting from the message demonology demonology okay he said notice then there was three ways that they had of finding out things from God the first was the prophet the second was a dream and the third was the uum andum and they neither will answer now you know what a prophet is and you know what a spiritual dream is and you know what the T was you know that the other day I asked a man what about the Y and Tom him he couldn't tell me what it was yeah because he had no idea of that Hallelujah in the in the same vein we didn't know anything about the till we came to the message of this hour Hallelujah he said see and the devil makes a counterfeit of every one of these right right that's true the wizard the false prophet and the Crystal gazes the and a hang around breast here aon's breast here and the Y and a cover over the stones and they hung it in the temple and when they wasn't sure they go before God in answer and a light will flash on that urum and the Tom whether it was God's will or not Hallelujah he said now when wouldn't answer now that was the direct answer from God if it doesn't answer meaning what the person is claiming is false Hallelujah today everything that we do when we bring it into the message of this hour we ask ourselves a question is it the message is this the message hallelu today we have so many people with so many ideas we have so many people want to make themselves prophets we have so many people want to make themselves teachers we have so many people want to make themselves Believers of the message but then what they claim when we bring it before us in the face of the message of this hour which is the and the Tom him do we see God yes right do we see Jesus Christ do we see the bride Hallelujah anything anybody claim we must have these characters we must see whether it's the message Hallelujah because look Jesus said something and I always LED he said it is impossible for the elect like you and I to be deceived Hallelujah right deception is a spirit right and Truth is a spirit Hallelujah but at any given time one conquers the other but thank God today we have the spirit of Truth to conquer the spirit of Li am hallelujah amen now let's go on a little okay it says he said God's power no he said and that you and tumim was only the crystal ball that the devil uses today because of the falsehood and the false prophet back here today the one that we have now was the witch or the fortune teller out yonder took the place of the prophet and on the devil's side you see what I mean yeah that's American English you see what I mean Hallelujah that that was your prophet he said you see what I mean yes sir Prophet we saw what you mean and when a prophet had given prophecy and they spoke and wanted to see if that prophecy was true they put it before theum and the tomim and if the voice of God throw that light on the H and Tom him then it was absolute it was the truth and if a man gives an interpretation gives a dream gives something of the Bible and something another and it don't compare with God's Bible it is false Hallelujah you know so that is why before we came to believe the message God have already placed this Y and the tomim on our heart already other than that brother there is no way sister there's no way you could believe the message that is the reason but the problem was that there was still something that need to flash on that thing if the truth you see let me let me give you the scenario or the picture when they hang the and Tom okay in the temple like this unless you speak on it right right if it's hanging it will hung either right but when you speak on it and it is truth it flashes so all along brother sister let me shock you right now all along as a child of God God have placed that Y and at tomim on your heart already he said I knew you before the foundation of the world you know it's not now that God is Planning how to save his people right no you have been saved long time ago amen that day when you got up and he said let there be light you were already in him doing that Proclamation yes amen hallelujah and how God will save you he had already planed it is not today that he is thinking about how I'm going to save Elliot which way how how how will I do it where will I pass and how can I get iiot to become and God bless you my brother hallelujah how am I going to get iiot no God have finished that business long time ago amen can somebody say Amen Here Am the day that God created the Earth he made our ways and brother sister I don't know the junction that God met you yeah and you don't know the junction that God met me when God set the Earth and put up the foundations and put all the instruments together right to make this place a living place for you and I he stood on a junction am waiting for everyone of us to come to that Junction in fact he didn't move wow Hallelujah you see that is why I agreed squarely with Isaiah when you call God the wonderful our God is so wonderful you you cannot determine how he made it but he did it anyhow he stood on that Junction he said I'm not moving an inch come on right I am waiting amen I am waiting till brother Aon will come I am waiting till brother brother nck will come I am waiting till brother Daniel will come I am waiting till brother Elliot will come I am waiting till all of us will come to that Junction at the same time so he said his only presence amen that's the meaning he is everywhere amen any time am the same time he's dealing with you he's dealing the same time with somebody else that's right so this J and the Tom has always been with us before even we were born into this Earth but it was hanging idle it was hanging idle at it was hanging idle in the temple in those days till somebody will speak on it amen so that day when it started glittering was the day that your soul and your spirit agreed and the word of God was spoken on it and then it reflected and you found out that no this is the truth that I've been longing for amen and therefore you have to leave everything that you think was right and come to face God Amen on his word amen hallelujah are understanding am amen and amen he says and if the voice of God throw the light on the he and the Tom him then it was absolute the truth and if a man gives an interpretation gives a dream give something of the Bible and or something another and it don't compare with God's Bible it is false there is the Yim and the tomim today God's word speaks and that is direct the voice of God like the and the Tom was before the Bible was written amen amen you see the point he said like the and atom was before the Bible was written right so it has always been with manen right hallelujah amen you see that is the reason why sometimes when I check the ministry of the prophet and uh certain things that he said in those days but today we can see that almost all are been fulfilled then you ask yourself how can somebody called this man a false prophet how can is it possible a man that got up one day and he said I've saw seven seven visions that is going to happen before the coming of the Lord hallelujah the end of mellan the end of Adolf Hitler communism rism and narcism swallowing up hallelujah amen the moral decay of the women and and you know all these things when we stood before the and the Tom him has it flash or not it has it has Hallelujah you know so this guide El also in the truth it does not make you go Wayward it it br you back always to the presence of God hallelujah amen he says I feel kind of religious right now and same am I feeling right now I'm happy that I am no longer in error Hallelujah if somebody come right now and tell me Daniel you you people believe that women should not be preachers I say yes sir he said where do you get it from the scriptures I said go to First Corinthians Hallelujah Paul will tell you amen Paul will tell you and because the Bible itself and him I believe God's word instead of human idea he said can you prove it I say yes I can prove it I can prove it for you because he told Timothy if a man desire the office of a bishop he desire a good thing is not it he said a man not a woman a man there is description there a man let us use the and the Tom him Hallelujah he said he must be a husband amen of one wife amen right that's the position of a bishop that's the only qualification brother sister it it must be a husband not a wife so where where would where will we put the and the Tom here on it must be a husband of one wife not a wife of one husband Hallelujah so you bring that thing before the him and see whether you are in line with God if somebody come and tell you that it doesn't matter brother sister let us baptize the people the way they want we cannot go and dump the people in the mighty Waters right let us have just a a bottle of water here and then we baptize them on your forehead in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost and that is it no no no no no no no no no Hallelujah the and the Tom will not flash Hallelujah the and the Tom will not flash we want attitude we want characters we want behaviors that will make the and the Tom to flash that is what we want Hallelujah and and people will come down and and they'll begin to challenge you when you go on evangelism sometimes they'll ask you questions he say brother what you people are making the people so much worried why why do you disturb them on which point are we disturbing the people showing them the right way of baptism come on showing them the right way to come to the Lord Jesus Christ he said yes you disturb the people so much you take them to the Sea you go and baptize them in all that say brother the Bible say that it must be by immersion amen immersion immersion said you must be drenched we shall we must put you in the water and bring you up he say yeah there's one thing also that you you you people confuse us why why do you say that it shouldn't be in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost and it must be in the name of the Lord Jesus right but the Lord Jesus said that it must be for Father Son and Holy Ghost I said brother wait a minute wait a minute Hallelujah Jesus Christ told the disciples go into the world preach the gospel please check the time for me please okay go to the world preach the gospel when they believe baptize them in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost yes that's what Jesus said but Jesus knew what he was talking about Jesus knew knew that the people that he was giving them that instructions they had the and the Tom so they are not just going to carry instructions but they going to check it with the and the Tom and so he told them that wait until you end do with power yes from above and they waited Hallelujah they waited I said they waited like how today you and I we are also waiting amen we are waiting for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ Peter and the rest were also waiting at the upper room right waiting to for the coming of the power that Jesus promised he said wait till do with power and that day when the power came down and and filled them and they started you know doing something unusual and it attracted the unbelievers around hallelujah oh brother you see sometimes these Pentecostals they need to Humble themselves so that they can be taught yes you see the Pentecostal have taken the whole experience to another way right true come on Hallelujah that's right until today even they claim that if you don't speak in tongues you don't have the Holy Ghost right true no if we bring that before the UN and Tom him it will not flash Hallelujah and and even the speaking in tongues today as they claim brother you and I will know what it is it is something that is no language but they speaking in Tong is a language are you catching it it's a language but the difference is that you speak a language that you don't know right that is why the Bible call it unknown tongue right I am speaking English it's not unknown tongue to me are you understanding what I mean yes right yes sir you speak English American English of course it's no tongue to you because you know it but as I stand here right now on one among you right now get up brother begin to speak Chinese so what is going on it will attract you espe under inspiration it will attract you say what is going on and then a Chinese will come in say what is this man a Chinese they said no he's an American when did he learn how to speak China or Chinese that was the experience that the people got when the Holy Ghost fell down the bible say that the people from all around the coast they had the apostles speak their tongue where they came from so what is the difference today that the Holy Ghost cannot do it again and this people are making us believe something else so when they were attracted they came around the apostles and the Jews were making fun of them they said don't mind these people perhap they have drank some new wine that is why they are behaving that way then the Holy Ghost pull the Apostle Peter and came and stood there and to the men and Brethren let me tell you the thought that has come into your mind yeah bring it to the and the Tom and see whether it will flash these people are not drunk as you are supposing but this was the prophecy of the Prophet Joel that it has been fulfilled that in the latter days I'll pour my spirit upon All Flesh Hallelujah and Peter oh brother I said Peter mounted the poopy that day in the morning and he started preaching the word he preached the word he preached the word and the people down there were having the Yum and the Tom already on your heart that's right so now after the Simon that Peter presented they asked men and Brethren what shall we do to be saved he said if you repent and you are baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost was that what Peter told them certainly not but remember the instruction that came for Jesus he said baptize them in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost but when the power came down am as the hear and the Tom him Peter told the people that be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the remission of your sins because the Holy Ghost came down to agree with the and the Tom him and by the Revelation that Peter got he found out that father was not a name son was not a name and the Holy Spirit was not a name but Jesus said baptize them in the name not even in the names in the name of the father in the name of the son and in the name of the Holy Ghost so Peter Peter stood before the H and the Tom and he got to know that the name of the father is Jesus Christ the name of the son is Jesus Christ and the name of the holy spirit is Jesus Christ so that is the name that you need to be baptized in and there people were filled with joy because it was glittering that day 3,000 Souls gave their life to Jesus Christ and they were baptized and that was the establishment of the church in that day brother my sister today what are we seeing there have been a lot of falsehood all over the place right but I thank God for your life yes any place that I go and I see Believers like this I am so happy because God have given us something to guide us from falsehood of this world Amen and that is what has placed us on his way if you read first Timothy quickly we are closing soon okay if you read first Timothy and chapter 4 he says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith don't forget that giv he to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seed with a hot iron forbidden to marry and commanding to abstain from Meats which God had created to be received with Thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth hallelujah amen for every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with Thanksgiving Every Creature right so who are those going around saying that you shouldn't eat meat don't eat chicken don't take sausage you have to only be on on HS no bring it to the and th him it will not flash hallelujah amen amen you get your grilled chicken with some good sauce on it and you are biting it how do you feel Hallelujah you get your some good hamburger with all those meat on it with with a s of cheese on it and when you bite it how do you feel it Hallelujah that's it's good to enjoy the Bible give us the opportunity huh to do that you see brother no don't get me wrong if your system don't you know agree with certain things you have to advise yourself okay if you eat this and it's not good for you you better ADV because we we we have different different system Hallelujah because sometimes if I if I take chicken like this I can't sleep so I don't want any doctor to advise me Hallelujah I have to advise myself I know people like h i for for instance I am very very allergic to hone oh yes so I don't I don't I don't go near hone should I make it the doctrine that H is not good that nobody should enjoy honey no it's not it's not good like way so if the thing is not good for you fine it is you but not all of us hallelujah you see but what I love here brother listen carefully he said for it is Sanctified by the word of God yes all the creatures all the meat it is s if by God Amen if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things thou shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourish up in the worst of faith and of good Doctrine where unto thou has attained amen so I thank God that tonight I'm a good Minister amen yes Hallelujah if you remember the breing in this you also be a good minister right Hallelujah we shouldn't be scared of the things that people say right but let us be in the and the Tom always to guide us because that is the absolute Hallelujah let's let's let's add this scripture also to it the same Timothy um Second Timothy chapter chapter 4 verse one I CH thee therefore before God and of the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exalt with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine you see a time will come and this is the time that we are living in they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own last shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears right and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned onto febles Hallelujah but watch thou in all things andure Affliction do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy Ministry Hallelujah my brother my sister we thank God that we are not in error right amen we thank God that we cannot be deceived because we have our spiritual and today hanging on our chest guarding against every falsehood and you see when you have it you are confident in place that you found yourself you are confident and you are happy I remember when the prophet told us about when he went beyond the kitten of time and he say he saw a lot of people there and there was an angel guiding him all you know to to to spy all the place and when he saw those people he said what that people were calling my precious brother my precious brother like this you know he says a young lady HED him said don't you remember me he said no I can't remember you he said well I am the old lady 91 year old when you baptized me so what now this old lady have 10 to be a young lady between the ages of 18 and 21 with a headful cover and the prophet said what so he went from one place to another and when the people Rejoice him like that he asked the angel are these all my people he said no these are not your people but they are your converts then he said are poor people here and he said to his amazement he said yes and the prophet said that I preach like Paul he said then all the host said that we are resting on that Hallelujah so you see that the prophet used the word of Paul as a and a Tom Hallelujah today we are using the message as a and a Tom what the difference it's the same the message have opened our eyes further into the word of God you can not go away from the message and you cannot go away from the word it is the same thing an expl further explanation of the word amen before we go I want you to let you know that the urim means light and the T also means Perfection so a light in it Perfection amen and brother sister tonight I am leaving you with this let us continue to let the and the Tom him hang Upon Our chest let it guide us against all falsehood let it guide against all lies let us maintain the truth that we have and when we have that oh brother we are more than conquerors amen nothing can intimidate us amen because we have the truth because we know the truth because we can we can differentiate lies from the truth amen that day before King King Nebuchadnezzar can we imagine he erected that image and said that every people should bow but these three Hebrew children they look to the and the Tom him and they found out that no King we cannot make you make us unbelievers we have a and Tom and anything that you say we check from it and when we check we should not bow down to your image right and so when the the symbols and the trumpets were blown all the people Bow Down and Worship the image but these three Hebrew children they stood and it was reported to the king king there have been some vagabonds here they don't want to respect your instruction he said who are those these three Hebrew children they claim they have a God that they worship and for that matter they are not going to bow down to your image he say is that so he say yes they bring them and they brought them before King Nebuchadnezzar and Nebuchadnezzar asked them do you know the consequence if you don't bow down we are going to burn you in a fairy furnace say yes King we are not careful to answer you this you can burn us but we know we have stood in the and the Tom him yes our God gave us a promise he said he will be with us all over the place that we find ourselves amen and right now we are not going to bow down to your image we know the god that we serve will save us from your hands amen but even let us tell you if he doesn't come we are not going to bow down you know what gave them that confidence it was the heum and the toming upon their hearts I tell you that if you have it it gives you confidence in everything that you do and the Book of said well soers set the oven on fire do it the first second third fourth fifth and sixth and seven can you imagine that they hited the oven seven times but that was the mistake that Nebuchadnezzar and his people did because the number seven is always God's number Hallelujah so the moment they heed the over the seven time then God himself came down into the fire Hallelujah and so when they bound these three brothers and threw them into the fire can you imagine the Flames that came out from the fire pass on the soldiers and they died but these three brothers were in a fire jumping and dancing Hallelujah it was because of the faith that they had in the Lord it was the confidence they had in the Lord brother and sister because they stood in the UN and Tom him and has given them faith and they were dancing singing preparing Hallelujah and they were amazed say what they rash and told King Nebuchadnezzar said King we have seen something we have never seen before we have always been burning people in this furnace but today something has happened King can you come and have a look of yourself and the badar came out from his throne and came to the F fers and bow down himself to look at what was going on you know why he bow down because the almighty God has come into the fire then he said Brothers how many people did we throw in the fairy fers yeah they told him King three people he said no but I see a fourth man and that fourth one look like the Son of God oh Hallelujah then he said Shadrach mes and Abednego the servant of the most high God come out from the fire yes you can bend fire if you put fire into fire what you get is more fire yes Hallelujah they were burning the fire of God was burning in them because they have the Holy Ghost in them and you want to put the holy ghost in the fire you are going to get more fire Hallelujah and so when they came out the bible say that there was not even a smell of smoke on their body their hair one did not burn they came vibrant out of the fire brother sister that is where we are now that is where we are now when God put us into his word that's right which is the holy spirit now we have become more fire we are now that nothing of this world can change our mind there is not going back we are going forward that very soon we are going to meet the Lord as Israel is waiting for their Messiah to come that very soon they are going to shout Bara bash Adonai blessed is the one that cometh in the name of the Lord we are also going to be changed soon and very soon our body is going to be changed and we are going to meet the Lord in the air and brother I said very soon it's going to happen that's right the world will not know anything about this Hallelujah then all that is going on brother look up for our Redemption is Drawing Near I don't know whether is going to happen right now I don't know whether it's going to happen tomorrow I don't know whether it's going to happen the next week or any other time but my advice is that brother sister don't let us leave the y and the Tom him right let it be hanging on our chest always let it guide us from falsehood and lies that it will glitter and reflect on our lives God bless all of us this evening let us bow down our head
