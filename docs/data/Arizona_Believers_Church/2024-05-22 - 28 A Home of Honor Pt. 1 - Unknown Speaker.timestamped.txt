[0:00] the my title tonight is going to be a
[0:02] part one at least I feel that it will be
[0:04] as I won't be able to finish um all the
[0:06] thought I have before me but it's a A
[0:08] Home of Honor A Home of Honor drawing a
[0:12] lot from where we were even on Sunday
[0:14] where his name dwells so this would be a
[0:16] part one A Home of Honor if you could
[0:18] write that down now we'll reset uh the
[0:20] title here in just a moment but
[0:21] Deuteronomy 12:1 it saying this of the
[0:26] Tabernacle which ultimately becomes the
[0:27] temple there there shall be a then there
[0:30] shall be a place which the Lord your God
[0:32] shall choose to cause his name to dwell
[0:36] there we realize that has something to
[0:37] do with his presence he should kind of
[0:39] glory and and he's saying there you
[0:42] bring all that I command you it's there
[0:44] that you'll bring burn offerings it's
[0:46] there that you'll sacrifice it's there
[0:48] that you bring your tithes and your
[0:49] heave offering and your choice vows it's
[0:51] there you'll Fellowship it's there
[0:53] you'll Rejoice it's there where I put my
[0:56] name God's one provided place of worship
[0:59] that chose in place of worship and he
[1:01] says that he will cause his name to
[1:03] dwell there in that place that he
[1:05] chooses this is the house of the Lord it
[1:08] be in the house of the Lord it carries
[1:09] his name he's willing to attach his name
[1:12] to it because to call it the Lord's
[1:15] House the one true God's house would not
[1:17] be
[1:17] misleading I think that's an important
[1:19] concept tonight that I'm really going to
[1:21] lean into is that he this is the house
[1:23] of the Lord so you should expect to find
[1:25] the Lord there and as we looked at
[1:27] different scriptures surrounding that if
[1:29] this is going to be the house of the
[1:30] Lord there must be certain prerequisites
[1:33] and certain characteristics because the
[1:35] name the place that I will cause my name
[1:37] to dwell this name is a Mark or a
[1:40] memorial of identification so it means I
[1:43] will identify myself there not that just
[1:46] there will be a name emblazoned in
[1:48] bricks or that there'll be a marquee out
[1:49] front that calls it God's house but his
[1:52] character his authority and his honor
[1:55] will be there you'll be able to learn
[1:57] about God you'll be able to fellowship
[1:59] with God it's there you'll be taught
[2:00] about God a lot of things that could
[2:02] come into this it's a place and this is
[2:04] what I draw from the name he'll cause my
[2:06] name to dwell there the name speaks of
[2:08] Honor Authority and character there'll
[2:11] be honor there there'll be Authority
[2:12] there there'll be character there and
[2:15] this should be the aspiration for all of
[2:16] us as individuals should be the
[2:18] aspiration for our homes and for our
[2:21] church that his name would dwell there
[2:24] that we would be a vessel of Honor that
[2:26] God's Authority would live through us
[2:28] that we would have the C Christlike
[2:30] character that can only come by the word
[2:32] and and through obedience and trials and
[2:35] that's for us as individuals we desire
[2:36] that in our home life and we desire that
[2:38] with our church the Bible says in
[2:41] Proverbs 22:1 a good name is rather to
[2:43] be chosen than great riches in loving
[2:46] favor rather than silver and gold this
[2:48] good name and loving favor comes by
[2:50] doing well by living a life that is
[2:53] above reproach it speaks of a man's
[2:55] reputation that even before you would
[2:57] meet him and interact with with him on a
[3:00] personal level his good name that goes
[3:03] before him his reputation that precedes
[3:05] him it it tells you something about him
[3:07] so you're going to get what you
[3:09] expect and it says in Proverbs 13:22 a
[3:12] good man leaveth an inheritance to his
[3:14] children's children and wealth of the
[3:16] sinner is laid up for the just this good
[3:20] man is able he has something of value
[3:24] that is not going to be spent by the
[3:26] Next Generation but can be enjoyed by
[3:28] the third generation and you'll find
[3:29] that this value is Faith this valuable
[3:32] thing is character it is the word of God
[3:34] it is something uh uh that can stand no
[3:36] matter how much someone would try to
[3:37] tear it down just think of all the
[3:40] opponents that have been against
[3:42] scripture and against Jesus Christ and
[3:43] all those that have attacked
[3:45] Christianity and tried to profane the
[3:47] prophets it still continues because
[3:50] that's the wealth can be uh take
[3:52] Stripped Away and certain things can be
[3:54] stripped away but it's the word of God
[3:55] that will ever remain and a good man
[3:57] leaves an inheritance to his children's
[3:59] children that's that good name a legacy
[4:02] brother Bram in the sermon time tested
[4:04] Memorials of God he said speaking of all
[4:07] the Caesar and and all these different
[4:09] War veterans and leaders of times past
[4:12] he said their memorials are gone but
[4:14] that Living Word of God Still Remains
[4:16] just the same and just as valuable he
[4:18] said that's a memorial remember a name
[4:21] is a memorial of identification it's an
[4:24] identity here it is the testimony of the
[4:27] word of God that will remain it will
[4:28] stick someone could earn a billion
[4:30] dollars in a lifetime and leave it to
[4:32] their children and their children can
[4:33] waste it to where the grandchildren
[4:35] never get to see any of it but if that
[4:36] man lived above reproach and testified
[4:39] to the word of God and had a testimony
[4:41] that something that grandchildren can
[4:43] enjoy despite the best efforts of the
[4:46] generation in between and you know that
[4:48] happen that's happened in this day that
[4:50] there's many who heard about the message
[4:52] and accepted the message and begin to
[4:53] raise children in the message a a and
[4:56] and then they they their children have
[4:57] grandchildren and that middle generation
[4:59] back back slides and goes away but
[5:01] there's grandchildren that come to the
[5:03] light and come to the word of God and
[5:04] hold to it because there's something
[5:06] that's greater than a squandered
[5:07] inheritance of money a and and high
[5:10] living and things of this world he said
[5:13] I say today brother the things that you
[5:14] do the words that you say how you treat
[5:17] your neighbor and what you do about C
[5:19] about Christ will be an everlasting
[5:22] Memorial uh if you want to kind of jot
[5:24] it down to the side just how you treat
[5:26] your neighbor keep that in mind but he's
[5:28] saying the things you say and do how you
[5:30] treat your neighbor what you do about
[5:33] Christ will be an everlasting Memorial
[5:35] he says you might have a fine home to
[5:36] leave your children you might be working
[5:38] for some livelihood to lead for your
[5:40] children but I'd rather leave them the
[5:42] word of God than anything else he said
[5:44] those houses will vanish so much of our
[5:46] efforts maybe especially as men are in
[5:49] making sure that we could secure a
[5:51] dwelling place for our wives and for our
[5:53] children and get it paid off and enjoy
[5:55] vacations and do a lot of things that
[5:58] will waste away and won't remain
[6:00] and I question what are we doing I'm
[6:02] asking what are you doing to invest in
[6:04] the word of God so that there's an
[6:06] inheritance that they can look to and
[6:07] enjoy in the word he says leave for them
[6:10] a memorial and he says your testimony so
[6:13] it's not a bank account that we want to
[6:15] leave it's not a perfect a trust that's
[6:17] set up just right and and though there's
[6:19] a lot of wisdom in Estate Planning and
[6:21] those different things but there's an
[6:22] estate that we ought to be laboring for
[6:25] there's an estate that we can be
[6:26] investing in that has nothing to do with
[6:28] worldly finances
[6:30] and I I think that kind of that I hope
[6:33] that summarizes a little bit about where
[6:34] his name
[6:36] dwells and and how that there's a there
[6:39] there's something that we can be
[6:40] pursuing it's about character where his
[6:42] character is and so A Home of Honor if
[6:45] you could turn to Luke chapter 8 A A A
[6:48] Home of
[6:50] Honor speaks I I want to address uh
[6:54] honesty and
[6:55] humility this this home of Honor what I
[6:58] kind of was led into this and all these
[7:00] different things that kind of begin to
[7:02] intersect is that if God's there you
[7:04] would expect to see his characteristics
[7:06] there that in the in the house of the
[7:09] Lord there's Mercy because he's a god of
[7:10] Mercy in in the house of the Lord there
[7:13] there there is Justice because he's a
[7:14] God of Justice and there's different
[7:16] things that you could begin to expect in
[7:18] terms of characteristics of a house
[7:20] because the one that owns it and the one
[7:22] that's there and so I begin to think of
[7:25] ourselves as vessels of honor and our
[7:27] homes being honorable homes
[7:30] and this these characteristics of
[7:31] honesty and
[7:33] humility and that's what I'm aiming for
[7:36] but I actually want to use
[7:39] hypocrisy and
[7:41] selfishness to highlight that honesty
[7:44] and humility so in Luke chapter 8:1 15
[7:48] this is part of where I'm getting this A
[7:50] Home of Honor these these descriptive
[7:52] terms this is the parable of the sewer
[7:54] the sewer Goes Forth and sews good seed
[7:57] and it falls on different types of
[7:58] ground or ground in different conditions
[8:00] on the Wayside uh in a Stony ground in
[8:04] ground that had weeds in it and other
[8:06] things that would grow up and then there
[8:08] was good ground that it finds and it
[8:10] says here in Luke 8 but that on the good
[8:12] ground are they which in an honest and
[8:14] good heart having heard the word keep it
[8:18] and bring forth fruit with patience this
[8:20] is very practical and should be
[8:23] literally happening in your life all the
[8:26] time where you the word is sown you hear
[8:29] the word of God then you keep it and
[8:31] bring forth the fruit of it so the one
[8:34] who hears receives gladly if we look at
[8:36] some of the the the whole Parable itself
[8:39] then keeps it and then patiently brings
[8:41] forth perfect fruit of the word think of
[8:45] these elements you're able to hear the
[8:46] word of God gladly receive the word of
[8:49] God do the word of God be patient in
[8:52] doing and then enjoy the perfect fruit
[8:55] of the word of God that's it's a whole
[8:57] picture there and it is is a beautiful
[9:00] description of the Christian Life That's
[9:03] one that will hear the word of God
[9:05] gladly receive it keep it not just in
[9:07] their hearts but in obedience to it so
[9:10] you're living it out and then as you
[9:11] persevere and are diligent to continue
[9:13] in good things and continue to live the
[9:15] word you're going to enjoy the fruits of
[9:17] it it's descriptive of the Christian
[9:19] Life in that the results that you
[9:21] ultimately bear match the word that was
[9:24] sown that you don't say oh I'm a
[9:26] Christian I'm a Christian and it's a
[9:27] fountain of bitterness and hostility
[9:29] lying and cheating and stealing but the
[9:31] word which is Christ has been swn into
[9:33] your hearts and so Christ is what is
[9:35] expressed out it says an honest heart
[9:39] we're talking about an individual even
[9:41] how we dealt with how we want to make
[9:42] our hearts his home but this honesty
[9:45] speaks of Excellence uh to be an honest
[9:48] heart is an excellent precious Choice
[9:52] surpassing admirable suitable so in an
[9:55] honest heart I know that we could think
[9:58] uh maybe solely from the point of a
[10:00] maybe we just think honest means it's
[10:01] going to tell us the truth and that's
[10:02] definitely part of it but it's something
[10:05] that is excellent and suitable it's
[10:06] excellent in its nature and its
[10:08] character I know we use this definition
[10:10] recently and and since it's honest it
[10:13] can be used for what it's rep represents
[10:15] itself to be it's suitable for its
[10:18] purpose it's approved and in these
[10:20] definitions and in the use of the words
[10:22] it means it's free from fraud in other
[10:25] words it's honest in that what maybe
[10:27] what you see is like oh that sure looks
[10:29] like a good Hammer I I I'm going to take
[10:32] that and use it as a hammer and you grab
[10:33] it it's just a wobbly piece of plastic
[10:35] like well this isn't going to do me any
[10:37] good in other words it's free from fraud
[10:39] it's genuine and not misleading so an
[10:42] honest T is one that's genuine there's
[10:44] no false appearances there's no deceit
[10:47] so an honest is kind of what you
[10:49] see is what you
[10:50] get and sometimes I guess it could be
[10:53] good for and for bad so an honest heart
[10:55] is genuine it's honest in that it's
[10:58] suitable for what it's represented to be
[11:01] there's no false appearances there's no
[11:03] dishonesty if you want to look at it
[11:04] that it doesn't lie it doesn't deceive
[11:06] it doesn't trick you it's genuine and
[11:08] it's in its nature and its character
[11:11] therefore it's approved and fit for use
[11:14] it's an honest heart and a good heart
[11:17] this word good means upright or
[11:19] honorable so it speaks of something
[11:21] being distinguished and of good
[11:23] character and good nature those two
[11:25] words together an honest and good heart
[11:29] this is
[11:30] Honorable this honorable honest and good
[11:34] this sincere genuine and honorable heart
[11:39] and this heart is one that is the
[11:41] opposite of hypocritical and
[11:44] selfish and and if there's if the
[11:47] antonym to that if you think about it
[11:48] think well it seems like somewhat of a
[11:50] stretch I don't I'm not ever trying to
[11:52] be really contrived when I want to make
[11:53] a sermon fit uh so hopefully it'll make
[11:57] some sense to you to where it's not like
[11:58] I'm just choosing words and and they're
[12:00] not lining up but an honest and good
[12:02] heart it's honorable and one who's
[12:04] honorable has certain characteristics
[12:06] and what they are not is they're not
[12:08] hypocritical and what they are not is
[12:11] selfish and though there's a lot of ways
[12:13] we could have built the foundation
[12:15] better I felt that I I wanted to begin
[12:17] to walk through this Parable in Luke
[12:18] chapter 16 and so it's from this that
[12:21] I'm taking this thought of an honest
[12:23] home A A A Home of Honor rather and I
[12:26] want to contrast it by this rich man
[12:29] that we read about in Luke chapter 16 I
[12:32] be I was just I was studying him
[12:33] recently just begin to think about his
[12:35] house his home life and and what it must
[12:38] have been like because the the message
[12:40] of the hour in the scripture give us a
[12:41] unique glimpse into this rich man's life
[12:45] so all to are we all together now okay
[12:48] so I'm not sure just how much we'll
[12:49] preach this how much we'll get through
[12:51] it but I want to bring some things out
[12:53] and just fellowship with you on this
[12:54] verse 19 there was a certain rich man
[12:58] which was clothed in purple and fine
[13:00] linen and fared sumptuously every day
[13:03] you'll find in some readings and in the
[13:06] uh Latin Vulgate and some places that
[13:08] the word the Latin word used for rich
[13:11] man is Dives and so actually some people
[13:14] just call them Dives and that's just
[13:15] exactly what I'll say uh to keep it
[13:17] short so that we're not just always
[13:19] saying a certain rich man but it's Dives
[13:22] is what he's referred to and he's
[13:24] clothed in purple fine linen and Fa
[13:27] sumptuously every day so if we were to
[13:29] see a painting of his life or a snapshot
[13:32] or a picture of his life we would think
[13:35] this guy got it going on he's doing
[13:38] things right this is somebody I want to
[13:40] be or when I grow up I want to be like
[13:43] him there might be a lot to be enviable
[13:46] because he dresses well he eats well and
[13:50] he's a rich
[13:52] man now as we've already touched on in
[13:55] mark 4: 19 Jesus when he's given the
[13:57] parable of the SE
[13:59] he says that some of it fell into the
[14:01] grounds where there was there was Weeds
[14:03] and there was Briars and there's other
[14:05] things growing in the ground and the
[14:06] ground seemed like uh it could support
[14:09] life and nurture that seed but with
[14:11] other things growing in there Jesus
[14:13] called them the cares of this world and
[14:15] the deceitfulness of riches and the lust
[14:17] of other things entering in he said
[14:19] choke the word and it becometh
[14:22] unfruitful and I want you to take this
[14:25] phrase the deceitfulness of riches and
[14:27] apply it to the rich man to see because
[14:30] we've already read the outcome of the
[14:32] story a and and recognize just how
[14:36] deceiving riches
[14:37] are the the riches not only do they
[14:40] corrupt but they also can cover up bad
[14:44] character because here is a rich man
[14:46] that as we read about it we're left we
[14:48] we realize that he's going to end up in
[14:50] hell and be tormented and so with all
[14:52] his gning and gaining and all his
[14:55] luxuries and his fine eating and his
[14:57] nice clothes he he G gives the
[14:59] appearance of blessing he gives the
[15:01] appearance of wisdom and having it all
[15:03] put together but yet there's something
[15:06] missing on the inside so Di's luxury was
[15:10] in no there was no indication of
[15:12] character by his fine linen and being
[15:15] clothed in purple there there's no uh
[15:18] indication or signaling no
[15:20] identification of
[15:22] morality because of his riches you could
[15:25] not conclude based upon those things
[15:28] that are mentioned a rich man who's
[15:30] dressed nicely and eats well and his
[15:32] life is luxurious you could not say God
[15:35] has blessed him the Bible says in
[15:37] proverbs 10 chap 2 verse 22 the blessing
[15:40] of the Lord it maketh rich now it it's
[15:44] not saying that riches are the blessing
[15:46] of the Lord but the blessing of God the
[15:49] favor of God to be pleasing to the Lord
[15:51] that's riches those are the things that
[15:53] make us wealthy those are the things
[15:55] that will support us in a time of need
[15:56] I've never seen the righteous forsaken
[15:58] or God seed beg for bread not because
[16:00] he's wealthy but because God blesses him
[16:03] and he says and he addeth no sorrow with
[16:05] it whereas we could say that riches and
[16:08] the Love of Money pierces us through
[16:09] with many Sorrows so there's a
[16:12] deceitfulness of riches and there's a
[16:15] not only will riches corrupt but it
[16:16] covers bad character I want you to
[16:18] remember that because I'm not saying
[16:20] this so that we could be critical of
[16:22] elong musk and Jeff Bezos and some of
[16:25] these other guys cuz we're we're still
[16:26] thinking maybe one time they'll stream
[16:28] and tithe the little bit but we're
[16:30] wanting you to be uh self-examine and
[16:32] think of yourself in the sense that how
[16:35] much do I let the riches of Leo DEA and
[16:38] the blessings and the accumulation of
[16:39] Honor in the world kind of plate me and
[16:43] satisfy me and I'm not allowed to be
[16:45] challenged by the word of God to say I
[16:47] can do better at the very least I can do
[16:50] better or maybe what we really need to
[16:52] wake up to is I'm doing wrong the fact
[16:55] that I do these things and accomplish
[16:57] these things and have these things
[16:58] should not L me to sleep into thinking
[17:00] that I'm right I'm doing wrong or I can
[17:03] do
[17:05] better I I want to point this out I
[17:08] think I'll just make reference to it I
[17:09] don't know that I have it on the slides
[17:11] but as I was studying this last week it
[17:13] says that he was rich clothed in purple
[17:16] and fine linen now you could take those
[17:18] things even this fair sumptuously you
[17:21] could take these characteristics and
[17:22] start looking at them in scripture and
[17:24] in my mind I immediately began to think
[17:25] about uh uh The Babylon in Revelation 18
[17:30] where there's this merchandise of gold
[17:31] and silver and precious stones and Pearl
[17:34] and fine linen and purple silk Scarlet
[17:37] all like wood manners of vessels of
[17:39] Ivory and vessels of the most precious
[17:40] wood brass iron and marble and this was
[17:43] this beautiful
[17:45] woman and we know that these appearances
[17:47] as the Bible says are
[17:49] deceitful because she was the cage of
[17:51] every foul spirit and unclean bird but
[17:54] yet she's dressed in fine linen and
[17:55] purple so in my mind I'm thinking wow
[17:58] they the rich man is identified with
[18:01] Babylon but then in the Book of Esther
[18:03] after Mori has stood his ground and he
[18:06] raised up Esther properly and he has
[18:09] they've weathered the storm and that
[18:10] Feast of Pim where Esther said let my
[18:14] people stand and fight for themselves
[18:16] and morai emerges victoriously it says
[18:19] that he went out of the presence of the
[18:21] king in Royal apparel blue and white
[18:24] with a great crown of gold and with a
[18:26] garment of fine linen and purple the
[18:29] whole city rejoiced and was glad and I
[18:33] thought my what mixed signals we
[18:35] have that on one hand you see the Harlot
[18:39] dressed this way but then you could see
[18:40] the same things fine linen which is the
[18:42] righteousness of the Saints and the
[18:44] purple which is indicative of royalty
[18:46] there's there's something beautiful
[18:48] about fine linen and purple but yet it
[18:51] in itself cannot signal to us exactly
[18:54] what a person's made
[18:56] of is the rich man righteous or is is he
[18:59] Wicked is he blessed or is he
[19:02] cursed would we place him as Revelations
[19:04] 18 with the mystery Babylon the great
[19:06] would we place him with Mori on
[19:08] this day of great rejoicing and feasting
[19:10] is he good or is he
[19:13] evil
[19:14] now I'm asking the question because I
[19:17] believe we have an
[19:18] answer but in by snapshot her appearance
[19:21] you can ask yourself what what what is
[19:23] he Jesus says a certain rich man I
[19:27] believe Jesus had someone in
[19:29] mind right a certain rich man if I could
[19:33] say this Dives is a character of the
[19:37] Pharisees or he represents the Pharisees
[19:40] which were a character of the law they
[19:43] didn't really have the heart of it but
[19:45] they put on The Heirs of it and if
[19:48] you're wondering how much I had to
[19:50] stretch to figure that out I just read
[19:52] verses 14 and 15 of the same chapter and
[19:55] Luke 16: 14 and 15 it says and the
[19:58] Pharisees also who were Covetous heard
[20:01] all these things and they derided him
[20:04] and he said unto them ye are they which
[20:06] justify yourselves before men but God
[20:10] knoweth your hearts for that which is
[20:12] highly esteemed among men is abomination
[20:15] in the sight of God Jesus has given them
[20:18] the parable of the unjust Steward and he
[20:19] has talked about how that you cannot
[20:21] serve two masters you cannot serve God
[20:24] in Mammon so his subject matter is about
[20:27] riches and when begins to talk about
[20:29] riches and the wealth of this world and
[20:32] he says you can't you can't serve that
[20:34] and serve God the the Pharisees who were
[20:37] covetousness who are Covetous deride him
[20:41] so this Parable that we read begin to
[20:44] read in verse 19 is commentary of this
[20:48] jealousy this self-justification and
[20:50] this hypocrisy of the Pharisees when he
[20:53] gives a parable he's responding to their
[20:56] derision he's responding to their
[20:58] jealousy and
[20:59] self-justification and when it says they
[21:01] were Covetous the word means they were
[21:05] lovers of
[21:06] money they loved money not God they
[21:09] loved money not truth you'll find
[21:12] sometimes that people like the gospel
[21:14] because the blessings that are attached
[21:16] with it and not necessarily Christ who
[21:18] is the gospel himself they don't have
[21:20] this attitude of Abandonment to say
[21:22] there is one truth and I I'd rather be
[21:25] right than and than to have the world
[21:27] and I'd rather be saved than to be lost
[21:29] and have the whole world and their
[21:30] attitude isn't regardless and no matter
[21:32] what the cost there's one true God his
[21:34] son gave his life for my sins and in him
[21:37] I want to be found they want the healing
[21:39] that comes with it they want the
[21:40] rejoicing that comes with it they want
[21:41] popularity that comes with it they want
[21:43] the social things that come with it but
[21:45] those who are sold out to God are
[21:47] willing to just have him in nothing
[21:51] else and so this these Pharisees were
[21:55] lovers of money not of God so they
[21:57] sneered
[21:59] at Christ's teaching on
[22:02] riches said you can't serve God in
[22:04] Mammon and they thought well that's
[22:06] exactly what we're doing that's exactly
[22:09] why we're doing it we love being priests
[22:11] because of the access it gives us we
[22:13] love being Pharisees because the
[22:15] opportunities we have we love being
[22:16] looked to as Masters and teachers and
[22:19] and having this great power but he says
[22:21] you cannot serve
[22:23] both and he says that you justify
[22:25] yourselves before men the
[22:27] self-justification they put on Heirs of
[22:29] righteousness before men but inwardly
[22:32] God knows their hearts and they are
[22:36] corrupt and what they esteem
[22:39] outwardly God finds yet as it as an
[22:42] Abomination because God sees the heart
[22:45] man will see the the the outside and
[22:47] like oh man
[22:50] dives what a great guy I'm going to name
[22:53] my son
[22:55] Dives and and in that see something that
[22:59] you would admire but God sees his heart
[23:01] and says this is an
[23:03] Abomination it is an Abomination that he
[23:06] lives this way that he expresses things
[23:08] this way because his life leads to
[23:11] hell and we're we're Desiring to be
[23:14] Dives and we see the example of Lazarus
[23:16] we're telling our kids whatever you do
[23:17] don't be a Lazarus be a Dives right
[23:20] there's this you want to be a rich man
[23:22] you want to do this you want to do that
[23:24] and we'll do everything to set our
[23:25] children up so that they can succeed in
[23:27] life so that they won't be Lazarus but
[23:29] really at the end of the day we've we've
[23:31] we've kind of looked at the wrong things
[23:33] and one's an Abomination and the other
[23:35] is God's
[23:37] blessing out let me reinforce that the
[23:41] parable of the rich man and the beggar
[23:44] the rich man I believe and I'm asserting
[23:48] and you don't have to just take this for
[23:49] what I'm saying I believe it's Jesus is
[23:52] using the certain rich man as a
[23:55] representation of Pharisees
[23:58] because God knows their
[24:01] hearts but they justify themselves
[24:04] outwardly but inwardly they're an
[24:05] Abomination now you'll see that Jesus
[24:08] makes this connection quite a bit in his
[24:10] teachings in Matthew chapter
[24:13] 23 vers 23 to 28 wo un you scribes and
[24:16] Pharisees
[24:18] Hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and
[24:21] Anis and cumin and have omitted the
[24:23] weightier matters of the law judgment
[24:25] mercy and
[24:27] Faith they they tithe on
[24:31] spice they're they're cutting like you
[24:34] need to tithe this and they're really
[24:36] really precise when it comes to these
[24:38] ties of mint and cumin and Anis and he
[24:41] says but on the waiter matters of the
[24:42] law and things such as Justice mercy and
[24:45] Faith he says you've omitted
[24:48] it you're you're super legalistic on
[24:50] some things and completely en licens on
[24:54] others I I think that's a mark of things
[24:57] that aren't right
[24:58] some people can be so adamant about some
[25:00] things and completely disregard the word
[25:03] and other things and and if we're not
[25:06] careful what we do is we reject the
[25:08] things that they're legalist about and
[25:10] become legalist on the things they
[25:12] reject and we're no better because Jesus
[25:15] says you ought to have done these things
[25:17] and not leave the other
[25:20] undone and so it's not that just oh
[25:22] don't worry about tithing on men and
[25:24] cuming don't be so legalistic don't be
[25:26] so precise it's like yeah do do that but
[25:28] don't leave out the bigger
[25:30] things so he says you blind guides which
[25:33] strain it a n and swallow a
[25:37] camel and then again this is I think
[25:39] that kind of ties back to the comment
[25:41] that you'll cut hairs on these things
[25:44] and strain on these things and then
[25:46] swallow a camel in the next bite why
[25:48] would you scribes Pharisees Hypocrites
[25:51] for you make clean the outside of the
[25:53] cup and of the platter but within
[25:55] they're full of extortion and excess
[25:58] this is his assessment of scribes and
[26:00] Pharisees they're Hypocrites outwardly
[26:03] things look good inwardly extortion and
[26:05] excess W un you scribes and Pharisees
[26:08] Hypocrites if you're like un Whited
[26:10] supplers which indeed appear beautiful
[26:12] outward but are within full of dead
[26:14] men's bones and of all
[26:16] uncleanness even that image of a a
[26:19] supper because it would be wrong and
[26:21] unlawful for a Jew to touch a touch a
[26:23] grave or supper they washed them white
[26:25] and they made them stand out so you knew
[26:27] to avoid them and Jesus is saying
[26:29] Pharisees do the same thing to be
[26:31] distinguished and you should avoid them
[26:34] likewise he says even so ye also
[26:37] outwardly appear righteous unto men but
[26:39] within you are full of hypocrisy and
[26:42] iniquity this is who Jesus is talking
[26:45] about or rebu rebuttal or refuting these
[26:49] that were Covetous and derided him
[26:52] because of his teaching on the unjust
[26:54] Steward in riches and how you ought to
[26:57] put God first first and serve God first
[27:00] he calls them Hypocrites the word means
[27:02] an actor a stage
[27:04] player hypocrite means a pretender the
[27:08] words in its roots speak of to feain
[27:11] something to impersonate or play the
[27:14] part this ought to have some weight for
[27:16] us to think of it that way scribes and
[27:18] Pharisees are all
[27:21] actors scribes and Pharisees read the
[27:24] script because the scribes transcribed
[27:26] the words the Pharisees studied it and
[27:27] so they knew it and what they did is
[27:29] they mimic it they impersonate it they
[27:32] have read and know that you need to
[27:33] tithe this much so they do it they have
[27:35] read and know that you need to conduct
[27:37] yourself this way so they do it they
[27:38] have all these things that seem to be
[27:40] figured out and they can put on the
[27:41] pretense of a life to where they're
[27:43] Justified before men but inwardly
[27:46] something's wrong hypocrisy is at the
[27:49] end of the day a mixed
[27:51] signal just as a certain rich man would
[27:54] have been esteemed within the community
[27:55] and thought to be blessed and thought to
[27:57] be rich and made lived his life in such
[27:59] a way to where it it suggested
[28:02] righteousness I don't have the
[28:04] statements here I was going to be
[28:05] holding this thought for Sunday morning
[28:07] but brother Brandon when he's preaching
[28:08] leadership and some other places he
[28:10] takes the story of the Rich Young Ruler
[28:13] who had kept the law perfectly in his
[28:15] Youth and then Jesus said one thing thou
[28:18] lackest and he went away sorrowful
[28:21] because he had great possessions so he
[28:23] and he says we find him later on in this
[28:26] parable of Lazarus and the rich man
[28:28] so the young the Rich Young Ruler is
[28:30] Dives and we find his Destiny later on
[28:33] what kind of leadership where did it
[28:34] lead him and led him to hell but if we
[28:36] could take those two stories together he
[28:39] keeps all those have I kept since my
[28:42] youth I know the word I know the message
[28:45] I know how it needs to be done and so
[28:48] there's a little bit of theater and a
[28:49] little bit of pretending that he can put
[28:51] on but he's it's playing the part
[28:54] because he doesn't have what he's
[28:56] purporting to have because in the end
[28:58] judged say it again it's a mixed signal
[29:01] hypocrisy we say to say one thing and do
[29:03] another but it's to say or do something
[29:04] that's inconsistent or contradictory to
[29:08] reality even in things that you do as
[29:11] God says I know your heart and you
[29:13] esteem these things outwardly but I know
[29:15] your heart it's hypocrisy you say these
[29:18] things and it sounds good but I know
[29:19] your heart it's
[29:21] Abomination Jesus therefore says in Luke
[29:24] 12:1 beware ye of the leaven of the
[29:27] Pharisees
[29:28] which is
[29:30] hypocrisy hypocrisy is the sin of
[29:33] pretending to be good or
[29:35] virtuous you're pretending to be good
[29:37] you're pretending to be honest as one
[29:40] writer put it it's the art of affecting
[29:42] qualities for the person purpose of
[29:45] pretending to an undeserved virtue it's
[29:48] an
[29:50] art of portraying certain
[29:53] qualities for the purpose of making
[29:56] people think you have a a virtue you
[29:59] haven't earned or don't
[30:03] deserve the leav of the phes is
[30:08] hypocrisy it's the hypocrisy that
[30:11] corrupts and changes things leevan
[30:14] though small in quantity eventually
[30:16] through its power and its influence and
[30:18] its design will thoroughly pervade the
[30:21] whole thing as Galatians says A little
[30:23] leaven lenth the whole
[30:25] lump hypocrisy then he says is like
[30:30] leaven you can have it and miss it
[30:34] because it's so
[30:36] small it can exist without being
[30:38] detected immediately or easily but
[30:41] eventually it pervades entirely and once
[30:44] it has its effect it puffs up with pride
[30:47] and vanity but in the end no more
[30:50] greater substance has been
[30:52] added is that not what's so with all the
[30:54] bakers that are here and those who when
[30:56] you add yeast to something in its
[30:58] quality at the time it has all the same
[31:00] components and it's just one small
[31:02] little ball but just let time pass and
[31:04] eventually the leaven causes the same
[31:06] thing to be puffed up it's no different
[31:09] in nature it's no different in character
[31:11] but now the leaven has caused it to
[31:14] appear to appear bigger you and
[31:18] different so that's that's the analogy
[31:21] that Christ is using that this Le the
[31:23] leaven of the Pharisees is hypocrisy
[31:26] hypocrisy causes them to swell up with
[31:28] pride hypocrisy causes them to boast and
[31:30] to put on erors and pretense and to look
[31:33] like they have it all together and to
[31:35] look like they're rich to look like
[31:37] they're blessed but in fact they are
[31:41] not I like to point out the emptiness of
[31:44] the leaven of hypocrisy in job 8: 13-15
[31:48] so are the paths of all that forget God
[31:50] this would be the reprobate the Heathen
[31:52] the UN the unrighteous and the
[31:54] Hypocrites hope Shall Perish whose hope
[31:57] shall be cut off and whose trust shall
[31:59] be as a spider's
[32:01] web he shall lean upon his house but it
[32:05] shall not stand he shall hold it fast
[32:07] but it shall not
[32:09] endure why it's a house of
[32:12] cards it's a house that's been made out
[32:14] of
[32:15] hay it's a house that has just been put
[32:17] together quickly built upon the sand not
[32:19] established upon a rock the Hypocrites
[32:22] hope what he trust in will perish he'll
[32:25] lean upon his house but he's built it
[32:27] through hypocrisy and it will fail him
[32:30] he'll try to hold it fast but it will
[32:31] not endure the hypocrite here is the one
[32:34] who's corrupted with the leav of
[32:37] hypocrisy or
[32:39] pretense listen pretending acting
[32:42] impersonating will fail
[32:45] you and I think that's the grace of
[32:49] God you should be happy if you're in a
[32:52] relationship uh with your spouse or with
[32:54] your children or with others to where
[32:56] you can only pretend for so long before
[32:58] Things Fall Apart and you got to get
[33:00] real and you got to get serious and
[33:02] that's the grace of God cuz pretending
[33:04] will only make you go so far because
[33:06] hypocrisy is empty it's vanity there's
[33:09] no virtue in hypocrisy there's no
[33:10] strength in hypocrisy there's no support
[33:12] in hypocrisy it has no valuable
[33:15] substance the Hypocrites hope will
[33:16] perish it's like leaning on a spider's
[33:18] web you try to trust in this house of
[33:20] cards that you build it will not stand
[33:22] you can try to hold it fast it'll wither
[33:24] away because there's nothing to it
[33:28] hypocrisy is a huge
[33:30] subject I believe that Jesus when he
[33:32] calls out this certain rich man he's
[33:34] calling out his his his
[33:37] hypocrisy because it's the Pharisees
[33:39] that were
[33:41] Hypocrites James chapter 3: 13 to
[33:46] 18 who is a wise man and endued with
[33:49] knowledge among you let him show out of
[33:51] a good conversation his works with
[33:53] meekness of wisdom so if one is wise let
[33:55] him demonstrate so by the way he lives
[33:58] and may it be the meekness of wisdom not
[34:01] somebody who's the
[34:03] wealthiest there's
[34:05] this I say this I mean I believe I'm
[34:08] stating the obvious but there's times in
[34:09] our lives where if we want advice or we
[34:12] want to know how to do something we we
[34:13] identify the person that we think is
[34:16] successful uh in worldly things or or in
[34:18] finances or whatever and that's the
[34:20] person we want to go to to get wisdom
[34:22] but that in itself isn't the wisdom that
[34:24] God's talking about that's not the
[34:26] wisdom that we should be looking four
[34:28] says but if you have bitter envy and
[34:30] strife in your hearts Glory not and lie
[34:32] not against the truth this should be
[34:34] this should be something that we always
[34:36] examine ourselves by if there's bitter
[34:38] Ian or Strife in our hearts there should
[34:40] be we should not Glory or lie against
[34:43] the truth those things are not right we
[34:46] cannot justify bitterness we cannot
[34:48] justify
[34:49] Envy this wisdom of envy and in
[34:52] bitterness descends not from above but
[34:55] is Earthly sensual devilish
[34:58] for envy and strife is there's confusion
[35:01] in every evil
[35:03] work but the wisdom that is from above
[35:05] is first pure then Peaceable gentle and
[35:09] easy to be in treated full of mercy and
[35:11] good fruits this is a Lous test for
[35:15] decisions that we make the way that
[35:17] we're viewing a situation the way that
[35:19] we're perceiving a situation whether
[35:21] we're hearing something being told to us
[35:23] or whether we're wanting to express
[35:24] things ourselves How Does It Strike your
[35:27] Palace
[35:28] is it
[35:29] bitter is it pure is it Peaceable is it
[35:32] gentle is it easy to be in treated is it
[35:33] full of mercy and good fruits does it
[35:35] tend to these things or does it delve us
[35:37] further into sensuality earthliness
[35:40] devilishness Strife
[35:42] bitterness and then he uses these
[35:44] phrases and I've gone down this path
[35:46] through these very familiar verses to
[35:48] get to this phrasing without partiality
[35:50] and without
[35:52] hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness
[35:54] is swn in peace of them that make peace
[35:57] to be be without
[35:59] partiality it's you're not
[36:01] self-righteous or
[36:04] self-serving I it's
[36:06] a it's it's not being selfish there's no
[36:09] guile or evil in uh selfish intent
[36:12] you're willing to give what's due
[36:14] because it's due and not withhold it
[36:16] without partiality wisdom which is from
[36:19] above is not
[36:22] partial it's not self-righteous it's not
[36:25] self-serving
[36:27] it it is and it says it's without
[36:29] hypocrisy it does not pretend it is not
[36:34] simulated wisdom from above doesn't say
[36:37] well I need to do this because I'll be
[36:39] perceived as right if I
[36:42] do it does it because it's
[36:45] right that we though we would avoid the
[36:48] appear the very appearance of evil we
[36:51] are no more righteous if we do things
[36:54] solely for parents sake
[36:57] but when we to the wisdom from above is
[37:00] not self-serving and it's not done for
[37:02] parents'
[37:04] sake to think of the ways that we
[37:08] sometimes present
[37:11] ourselves because we know it's
[37:14] right but yet in our hearts we don't
[37:16] really agree with it as we ought
[37:19] to we're doing it just to be sure
[37:22] everything's
[37:24] covered and there's times and maybe I'm
[37:26] speaking this personally so Lord just
[37:28] help me as it strikes me there's times
[37:30] in our in your life where whether it be
[37:32] family or even people who profess to
[37:33] believe the message they just are who
[37:36] they are and they're not going to
[37:38] pretend around
[37:39] you even if that means that they just
[37:43] say what they want to say dress how they
[37:44] want to dress live how they want to live
[37:47] and for some of us we might think well
[37:48] how dare them and that's disrespectful
[37:50] and and there's a part that can really
[37:53] grade on us but I'm just saying this out
[37:55] loud as a person but sometimes I can
[37:57] appreci appreciate the fact that I know
[37:58] where they're standing and I know where
[38:01] they're at whereas with other people
[38:02] you're like I don't know about this guy
[38:05] I mean it's like a 99% of the time
[38:07] everything's put together then all of a
[38:09] sudden something happens you're like wow
[38:10] where did that come
[38:13] from and so this this is the hypocrisy
[38:17] of the Pharisees this certain rich man
[38:20] he is not without partiality he is not
[38:22] without
[38:23] hypocrisy notice the depths of this
[38:26] hypocrisy it says in Proverbs 11:9 a
[38:29] hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his
[38:32] neighbor but through knowledge shall the
[38:35] just be
[38:36] delivered the word their hypocrite it's
[38:38] even as it's used in job kind of in the
[38:41] Hebrew language they use the term
[38:43] hypocrite but it speaks of an Infidel or
[38:45] one that rejects divine
[38:48] revelation and and so it's not just
[38:50] solely maybe somebody uh who's dishonest
[38:54] but yet the scripture
[38:55] itself shows us this principle of
[38:58] hypocrisy that it leads
[39:00] astray and it will corrupt the character
[39:03] of others because the hypocrite is going
[39:06] to use words to his neighbor gonna
[39:07] flatter gonna say things gonna entice
[39:10] gonna encourage gonna put on things to
[39:13] entice the the the the neighbor to see
[39:15] things or do things or to act in a way
[39:18] that won't ultimately benefit him and so
[39:21] the hypocrite through his words will
[39:23] corrupt the character of his neighbor
[39:25] but it says knowledge will deliver the
[39:29] just so knowledge is the anecdote the
[39:33] antidote to
[39:35] hypocrisy truth is the antidote to
[39:41] hypocrisy this honesty is what overcomes
[39:44] hypocrisy that hypocrisy even has in its
[39:47] meaning to answer for someone or to
[39:49] speak for someone and it has this idea
[39:51] that you're playing and you're putting
[39:52] on the part and I'm going to speak as if
[39:55] I'm the one that's doing it but I'm just
[39:56] acting I'm just is playing the part and
[39:59] so if you are if you're hypocrisy you're
[40:02] kind of given an answer that you think
[40:03] is right but yet when we're honest we
[40:06] give an honest answer like I that I'm
[40:08] I'm needy I'm dishonest I I make
[40:10] mistakes I need help it's the
[40:14] truth
[40:16] honesty it's one of these
[40:17] characteristics I'm wanting to identify
[40:19] in a A Home of
[40:21] honor it speaks of Splendor honesty in
[40:23] in the Hebrew is
[40:25] honor the right kind of behavior your
[40:27] good manners if one is honest they're
[40:30] honorable the Bible says in Proverbs
[40:32] 18:12 Before Destruction the heart of a
[40:35] man is
[40:37] hotti pride goeth before a fall he's
[40:40] presumptuous he's arrogant he's Vain and
[40:43] before honor is
[40:46] humility before there can be honor there
[40:49] must be meekness power under
[40:51] control to have this kind of humility
[40:54] here to a Hebrew it means you're not
[40:55] self asserting
[40:58] but you're
[41:01] respectful that's the characteristic of
[41:04] God to be
[41:07] respectful before honor is
[41:11] humility so I use this description and
[41:14] this characterization of a hypocrite and
[41:18] hypocrisy to describe the rich man the
[41:21] rich man who was clothed in purple and
[41:23] fine linen and fared sumptuously every
[41:25] day Dives had a
[41:27] reputation and he had a testimony that
[41:30] might have signaled one thing but I'm
[41:31] saying deep down inside he didn't have
[41:34] what some people would think he had he
[41:36] is the Pharisee which is a hypocrite
[41:38] whitewashed and pleasant on the outside
[41:40] but inside full of hypocrisy and
[41:42] iniquity Dives is a hypocrite but a rich
[41:44] one but yet a hypocrite and in verse 20
[41:48] now we see this direct contradiction or
[41:50] contrast a rich man dives was clothed in
[41:53] purple and fine linen fared sumptuously
[41:55] every day but then Jesus says and and
[41:57] there was a certain beggar named
[42:00] Lazarus you'll notice that the rich man
[42:02] is have is given a name later by in
[42:05] Tradition using a Latin term that is not
[42:08] a proper name but yet it's a word that
[42:09] means rich man but yet this man has a
[42:13] name the rich man has not given any name
[42:15] and I believe it's done so that you
[42:17] could just identify the spirit and not
[42:19] get hung up on the name but here this
[42:21] the certain Beggars given a name and the
[42:23] name does speak of something the name
[42:25] means God is my help
[42:27] and a certain beggar named Lazareth
[42:29] which was laid at his gate that means he
[42:31] would have had to have been carried he
[42:33] needed to be carried to be laid at the
[42:34] gate this man was rich enough to have a
[42:36] house with a gate he was laid he needed
[42:39] to be carried full of sores he's in
[42:43] other words these sores are are are not
[42:45] treated or
[42:47] bound and he would have been glad to eat
[42:49] the crumbs from Di's
[42:51] table wouldn't mind eating at a dive
[42:54] desired to be fed with the crumbs which
[42:56] fell from the rich man's table moreover
[42:58] the dogs came and licked his sores
[43:00] they're open they're festering and Jesus
[43:03] adds this and it makes the scene even
[43:04] more pitiful here's a man that cannot
[43:08] help himself so he is laid at the rich
[43:10] man's gate and he's placed here that by
[43:14] Chance the rich man would have mercy on
[43:16] him but the scripture is silent as to
[43:18] whether or not he ever was able to enjoy
[43:20] any Crumbs from uh Di's table or whether
[43:23] or not he was ever given any kind of
[43:25] consideration and it just says that that
[43:27] the dog show more pity on this man than
[43:30] the rich
[43:32] man and it is remarkable especially to a
[43:35] Jew to say that a dog behaved better
[43:38] than a
[43:39] Pharisee because a dog would be one of
[43:41] the worst things you could be called if
[43:43] you were a practicing Jew but Lazareth
[43:46] who means God is my help it means he was
[43:49] a good man I believe that Jesus in the
[43:51] short words that he uses he tells us
[43:54] where he ends up and he says things
[43:55] about Lazareth and where he ultim ions
[43:57] up that can tell us that he was living
[43:59] by God's help he trusted in the Lord and
[44:03] I know that it is a paradox and it's a
[44:05] difficult picture maybe to find uh uh to
[44:08] to rationalize with that if you were to
[44:10] draw it out of a rich man clothed and
[44:13] fine linen and purple eating the best
[44:15] that his the his region had to offer in
[44:18] a house behind the gate and then you
[44:20] drew a picture of a a poor man a feeble
[44:22] Man full of sores and dogs licking his
[44:25] sores and he's starving and he's and
[44:27] he's dying and the one at the gate trust
[44:30] in God and the one behind the G behind
[44:32] the gate trusted in
[44:34] riches one was blessed and one was
[44:38] cursed that's why that's why you
[44:40] say that hypocrisies at work or pretense
[44:44] is probably the better word that I could
[44:46] use all things are not as they
[44:50] appear every day Dives had an
[44:55] opportunity to feel lazarus's
[44:58] pain not
[45:00] literally but
[45:02] empathetically if not empathetically
[45:05] sympathetically every day as this beggar
[45:08] was carried to the gate and laid there
[45:10] and if he would be taken away at night
[45:11] or how that it would have worked every
[45:13] day the rich man had an opportunity to
[45:15] be touched by the poverty of
[45:18] Lazarus every day when he passed by and
[45:21] I believe it's the part of the image
[45:22] that Christ would want us to consider is
[45:24] he laid at the gate not in the alley not
[45:26] down the street but it was in a place to
[45:28] where this rich man would have have
[45:29] opportunity to see him time and time
[45:32] again and the rich man every day maybe
[45:35] twice a day would have been challenged
[45:37] to lower
[45:38] himself to see him as deserving of mercy
[45:42] and to give to show some mercy some
[45:45] compassion to do to give some good to
[45:49] Lazarus in Matthew chapter 23 Jesus
[45:52] speaking about the hypocritical
[45:55] Pharisees and Des cribes as we've
[45:57] already read verses 23 to 28 this is
[46:00] before that he had already been burning
[46:02] them quite a bit he says neither be you
[46:05] called Masters for one is your master
[46:06] even Christ but he that is greatest
[46:09] among you shall be your
[46:12] servant and whosoever shall exalt
[46:14] himself shall be
[46:16] abased and he that shall humble himself
[46:19] shall be
[46:20] exalted what what
[46:23] anchors what a foundation to what he
[46:25] begins to say about hip Hypocrites
[46:27] who've omitted the weigher matters of
[46:29] the law Hypocrites who make clean the
[46:30] outside but are full of extortion and
[46:32] excess Hypocrites who outwardly appear
[46:35] beautiful but inwardly they're full of
[46:36] hypocrisy and iniquity why he says you
[46:39] make yourself to be something instead of
[46:42] making your lowering yourself to be a
[46:44] servant humble yourself to be exalted
[46:47] but woe unto you scribes and Pharisees
[46:50] Hypocrites for you shut up the Kingdom
[46:52] of Heaven against men for ye neither go
[46:54] in yourselves neither suffer ye them in
[46:56] is up for them that are entering to go
[46:59] in that key of knowledge as it were that
[47:02] they said that they had they have hid
[47:05] they've hid the access to the kingdom
[47:07] woe un you scribes and Pharisees
[47:09] Hypocrites for you devour widows houses
[47:11] and for a pretense make long prayer and
[47:15] therefore you shall receive the greater
[47:18] damnation who would you scribes and
[47:20] Pharisees Hypocrites for you Compass sea
[47:22] and land to make one proelite and when
[47:25] he is made you make him twofold more the
[47:26] child of Hell than yourselves
[47:29] wow these are pretty sick Burns right
[47:33] kids I mean these are mic drop
[47:36] moments this is he's spitting hot fire I
[47:39] think is what the uh the homies
[47:43] say this he says you Compass sea and
[47:46] land to make a convert and when you've
[47:48] converted him he's twice the child of
[47:50] hell as you are in other words you're a
[47:52] child of Hell
[47:54] yourself pretense
[47:59] Pride you make the pretense of a long
[48:03] prayer the way that they present
[48:06] themselves and show
[48:08] themselves now I I have purposely left
[48:11] my notes short
[48:13] tonight so that I could have more time
[48:15] to delve into selfishness and kind of
[48:17] find something that would bridge the gap
[48:18] between this hypocrisy but I I want to
[48:21] say this now and I I I could end with
[48:23] pointing these things out Dives let his
[48:26] richual obscure the
[48:29] truth he let his success in the world
[48:34] hide him from his true
[48:36] needs one thing thou
[48:40] lackest he thought eternal life and
[48:43] comfort and safety could be found in in
[48:47] the the the possessions of this world
[48:50] but once exposed he let his wealth
[48:52] obscure his true
[48:54] need but if I could say this about Lazar
[48:57] he never let his poverty change what he
[48:58] ought to
[49:00] pursue I believe that we could take from
[49:02] Luke chapter 16 and say that Lazarus did
[49:05] not try to serve God in Mammon he served
[49:07] God
[49:09] Alone that Lazarus himself had put God
[49:13] first so he could be committed to True
[49:16] riches because Dives is rich in Optics
[49:20] but poor where it counted in
[49:24] character in verse 22 it says it came to
[49:26] pass pass that the beggar died and was
[49:28] carried by Angels into Abraham's bosom
[49:30] this is all you need to
[49:32] know when he died he was carried by
[49:35] Angels into paradise and Jesus says the
[49:38] rich man also died and was buried in
[49:39] other words there's no Paradise for this
[49:42] one verse 23 and in Hell the rich man
[49:45] dives lifts up his eyes and he's
[49:46] tormented he sees Abraham a far off this
[49:49] picture this Father Abraham is a picture
[49:51] of paradise and Lazareth is in his bosom
[49:54] he's been comforted he's at rest he's at
[49:56] PE he's in this glorious Paradise that
[49:58] every that the Jews would have been that
[50:00] some would have believed in and longed
[50:02] for and he cried the dive says Father
[50:05] Abraham have mercy on me and send
[50:07] Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his
[50:09] finger in water and cool my tongue for
[50:11] I'm tormented in this flame we'll come
[50:13] back to amplify that maybe Sunday and
[50:15] Abraham said Son remember that thou in
[50:17] thy lifetime reest thy good things and
[50:21] likewise Lazarus evil things but now
[50:24] he's comforted thou
[50:27] are
[50:28] tormented in the final analysis how many
[50:31] of us well I guess maybe you could say
[50:33] guts or gumption or faith would you be
[50:35] willing to accept lazarus's lot in life
[50:38] so that you could have his
[50:41] Destiny now I have often joke brother
[50:43] brandom turned down millions of dollars
[50:44] and I've joked that you know what I
[50:45] wouldn't mind being tempted with it you
[50:47] know just to see how I handle it but the
[50:50] reality is it's kind of just joking the
[50:52] reality is would you
[50:54] tempt yourself to be be a rich
[50:57] man and think that you could fare
[51:01] better would be would you be willing to
[51:03] do
[51:04] it I I I I know I know what the Bible
[51:07] says and if I was a Rich Young Ruler I
[51:09] wouldn't make the same mistake that he
[51:11] made when he stood before
[51:12] Christ I I I would do that I would sell
[51:15] all I have and give to the poor and I
[51:18] would follow him and and how is it that
[51:20] you find yourself rationalizing I know
[51:22] when I say riches we might think purely
[51:24] of cash in the bank and but I you to
[51:26] think about richness in the
[51:28] world a and and having things that we
[51:31] enjoy in the riches I've been reading
[51:33] different statements where brother
[51:34] brandom is constantly identifying the
[51:36] spirit and attitude of Leo DEA and we
[51:39] don't have to be Filthy Rich it's just
[51:41] Leo DEA provides us with so many things
[51:44] that are
[51:46] luxuries you know what we call luxuries
[51:49] of the 18th century you know what we
[51:50] call them today basic human
[51:52] rights that's what they've become
[51:55] people's rights L to see I have a basic
[51:58] human right to the internet highp speeed
[52:02] to a base
[52:04] income right I have a human these are
[52:08] the my basic human rights that I should
[52:09] have a house I should have an internet I
[52:11] should have a phone I should have this I
[52:13] should have that I I'm ow it and I'm do
[52:16] it just because I'm a
[52:18] human and therefore All Humans should uh
[52:21] collectively work in order that we would
[52:24] all have these basic human rights
[52:27] it's the soft living of leod
[52:32] deia Dives received good
[52:36] things Lazarus evil things but one was
[52:40] tormented in the end the other one
[52:43] comforted in Matthew chapter 6:
[52:47] 1-6 speaking of the Hypocrites the
[52:50] Pharisees which I believe I'm using
[52:53] today the rich man
[52:56] as a
[52:58] Pharisee the one that was clothed in
[53:00] purple and fine linen and fared
[53:02] sumptuously every day Jesus says take
[53:04] heed that you do not your arms before
[53:06] men to be seen of them otherwise you
[53:09] have no reward of your father which is
[53:11] in heaven let me let me back up I I I
[53:15] think maybe I'm I'm going too fast and I
[53:18] just need to I need to add some
[53:19] background to
[53:22] this we we don't see either man's home
[53:25] life do we
[53:27] Dives or
[53:29] Lazarus but it could be safe to say that
[53:31] Lazarus is
[53:34] unhoused but Dives as
[53:37] homeless that Lazarus in life received
[53:40] evil things but yet he trusted in God
[53:43] and in the end he's comforted he's in
[53:45] Paradise he makes it
[53:47] home but yet the rich man though he had
[53:49] a house and it was beautiful and he
[53:51] fared sumptuously and he lived well and
[53:52] he was comforted by things in life and
[53:54] Jesus said he received good things in
[53:56] this
[53:57] lifetime but yet he's not committed the
[54:00] true
[54:01] riches
[54:03] he we could say he has a house but he
[54:06] has no
[54:07] home and we could make certain
[54:11] conclusions based upon what he did
[54:13] outside the gate we can have we can make
[54:16] some conclusions about what was going on
[54:18] inside the
[54:20] gate because we're not able to
[54:22] necessarily look in and peek in through
[54:24] the the window and see how Dives is
[54:26] treating his
[54:27] wife how he's raising his children what
[54:30] he does in his private time and how he
[54:32] is when nobody is looking but yet we
[54:35] have an opportunity to see him every
[54:37] morning and every evening as he passes
[54:38] by Lazarus to see what he does to his
[54:41] neighbor to find out what his testimony
[54:44] really is and you can conclude based
[54:48] upon what he does outside the gate you
[54:50] can pretty be pretty safe about what
[54:53] he's doing inside the gate am I making
[54:56] sense now the way a man is outside of
[54:58] his
[54:59] home begins with the way he is in his
[55:03] home the way a man is privately is most
[55:06] likely going to be the way that he'll
[55:07] end up publicly and if he's not he is a
[55:12] hypocrite a man that yells at his wife
[55:15] and speaks softly to his friends is a
[55:19] hypocrite a man that is selfish towards
[55:21] his children and gen generous towards
[55:23] his buddies is a hypocrite
[55:27] so there are conclusions that you can
[55:29] make
[55:30] ultimately and he says don't do your
[55:32] arms before men to be seen of them
[55:34] otherwise you have no reward of your
[55:35] father which is in heaven I've wrestled
[55:37] with this and wrestled with this feeling
[55:39] like it's it's a picture that I I I feel
[55:41] like I see in my mind but I can't
[55:42] explain it I'm just trusting the Lord
[55:44] will make this make sense to you
[55:45] therefore when thou doest thine arms do
[55:47] not sound a trumpet before thee as the
[55:49] Hypocrites do in the synagogues and the
[55:51] streets that they may have Glory of men
[55:55] there's always an audience with the
[55:58] hypocrite verily I say unto you they
[56:00] have their
[56:01] reward but when thou doest alms let not
[56:03] thy left how know what thy right hand
[56:05] doeth that thine arms may be in secret
[56:07] and thy father which seeth in secret
[56:09] himself shall reward thee openly and
[56:12] when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as
[56:14] the Hypocrites are for they love to pray
[56:17] standing in the synagogues and in the
[56:19] corners of the streets that they may be
[56:21] seen of men here's your rich man verily
[56:24] I say unto you they have their reward
[56:27] now in our minds we're thinking the fine
[56:29] linen and the purple and the fair ins
[56:31] sumptuously and the big house and the
[56:33] gates and everything that they've been
[56:34] rewarded but no that's not their reward
[56:36] their reward is
[56:38] torment but thou when thou prayest enter
[56:41] into thy closet remember that secret
[56:43] chamber where Pleasant riches
[56:46] are and when thou has shut the door thy
[56:49] door pray to thy father which is in
[56:52] secret and thy father which seeth in
[56:54] secret shall reward thee open
[56:59] openly I'm I am
[57:02] addressing hypocrisy and selfishness
[57:05] focused more on the hypocrisy
[57:08] today
[57:10] and Jesus says that in public they
[57:15] pray they do their
[57:17] alms they do it as he says that they may
[57:20] have Glory of men honor of men that they
[57:23] may be seen of men
[57:27] and what is happening on the street
[57:28] corner is all for theater so they're
[57:32] Hypocrites so when no one is watching
[57:35] they don't do those
[57:37] things when nobody else will know they
[57:39] won't
[57:40] give when nobody else when when it's not
[57:43] going to be retweeted right this is this
[57:46] is the problem with all these viral
[57:47] videos of people doing something for
[57:49] homeless people it's all it's it's
[57:53] Pharisees that that's what's happening
[57:55] they think oh man these guys are really
[57:57] really nice you know I I mean his name
[58:00] is Mr Beast and I think we joked one
[58:02] time in the music room like what is that
[58:04] say right the mark of the beast and I
[58:07] can't remember what the joke was I think
[58:08] it was brother Loy that had it and if I
[58:10] remember it I'll have to owe him
[58:12] loyalties what oh it was the mark of the
[58:15] Mr Beast that's what it was but when you
[58:18] think about all these things they do
[58:20] they do it for
[58:21] clicks they do it for income now now
[58:25] some of us can be happy that the blind
[58:27] see and the deaf hear because of Mr
[58:30] Beast but remember at the end of the day
[58:32] he's not
[58:33] righteous he's doing it for the
[58:36] views he's doing it for the followers
[58:38] he's doing it to make money and as long
[58:40] as we view he'll make more
[58:42] money and so there's a there's a certain
[58:45] pretense that if you couldn't video it
[58:48] if you couldn't get some Karma or some
[58:50] clout or you couldn't go viral would
[58:53] people do it
[58:54] anyways why is it when they pay it
[58:56] forward they've already pushed record
[58:59] why is it when they're doing something
[59:00] nice they've got to have a camera
[59:05] running because it's the age of
[59:08] Pharisees it's the age of age of acting
[59:10] it's l to see the age of pretending even
[59:13] if it's doing good it's for
[59:16] show but then there's and I'm and I'm
[59:19] making the point that if the camera's
[59:21] not on if people can't
[59:22] see what are you doing
[59:27] Dives was outwardly rich but inwardly
[59:32] poor he was a
[59:34] Pharisee he was an actor a pretender of
[59:37] one that kept the law because he kept
[59:39] the law legalistically but miss missed
[59:41] the heart of it a character of the law a
[59:44] character of Judaism a character of
[59:47] their faith in other words he didn't
[59:48] actually have it he didn't have the
[59:49] character of it he had the pretense of
[59:51] it he was long on religion and short on
[59:54] love
[59:58] last night in our
[1:00:00] devotion the book that we're reading as
[1:00:02] a family devotion is quoted in
[1:00:05] English Johan V
[1:00:08] Wen V go go this a writer and a
[1:00:12] philosopher it's written in German but
[1:00:13] this is I translated several times just
[1:00:15] to find exactly the right way to say it
[1:00:17] but he said Talent develops in quiet
[1:00:20] places character in the full current of
[1:00:23] human
[1:00:24] life I know that we have a saying that
[1:00:27] character is what you are when you're
[1:00:28] all
[1:00:30] alone and and I think that we use that
[1:00:34] as a way of challenging ourselves that
[1:00:36] what are you doing with nobody's looking
[1:00:37] because that's your true
[1:00:39] self and and therefore we're not putting
[1:00:42] weight on what we do outwardly and what
[1:00:45] we do for
[1:00:47] show and this doesn't necessarily turn
[1:00:50] on turn it on its
[1:00:51] head but there's something about
[1:00:54] character growing in being expressed in
[1:00:57] the daily
[1:00:58] living and that it says Talent develops
[1:01:01] in quiet
[1:01:02] places now this is the way that I've
[1:01:04] been meditating on it ever since we read
[1:01:06] it last night I was so struck by
[1:01:08] it and and we had some discussion as a
[1:01:11] family because you can think well what's
[1:01:12] talent and what's skill in these things
[1:01:14] and and the the the book that we're
[1:01:15] reading is spoke of the talents of
[1:01:18] prayer and different things that you do
[1:01:20] in
[1:01:21] secret and today as I was praying about
[1:01:23] it I I felt that it could be said this
[1:01:25] way
[1:01:27] it's not our private suffering or even
[1:01:29] the internal monologue we have with
[1:01:31] ourselves where we're telling ourselves
[1:01:32] we're good and we're good enough and in
[1:01:35] rationalizing with everything and well I
[1:01:37] said and we're already working out an
[1:01:38] excuse well I said this because of that
[1:01:40] and we're backtracking into what we did
[1:01:43] and we want to back our way into being
[1:01:46] righteous like misspelling mortgage and
[1:01:48] then trying to come up with how that
[1:01:50] actually is something even more
[1:01:52] spiritual to make myself look good
[1:01:56] are forgetting that it was not CS Lewis
[1:01:58] but it was CS Lucas that said
[1:02:01] that and so there's different things
[1:02:03] that we could do where we try to back
[1:02:06] ourselves into being right and it's all
[1:02:08] this it's private suffering it's what
[1:02:10] was me I'm the
[1:02:11] victim but the character that we're
[1:02:13] talking about is hearing receiving doing
[1:02:16] and waiting patiently for the word to
[1:02:19] come forth hearing receiving doing and
[1:02:23] being patient for the word to be
[1:02:24] expressed and honest and good heart is
[1:02:27] what brings honor and honest and good
[1:02:30] heart is the opposite of what is
[1:02:31] hypocritical and
[1:02:33] selfish and we say well where does this
[1:02:35] start it doesn't start through pretense
[1:02:40] it doesn't start on stage it doesn't
[1:02:42] start out there I'm going to go to work
[1:02:43] tomorrow and I'm going to impress
[1:02:44] everybody with my humility I I'm going
[1:02:46] to be a better person out there in the
[1:02:47] churchard under the under the in the
[1:02:49] foyer and under the awning I I'm going
[1:02:51] to be a real Christian now it starts in
[1:02:53] your
[1:02:54] closet so that it can make a difference
[1:02:56] in your bedroom so that that can make a
[1:02:58] difference in the dining room and
[1:02:59] kitchen so that that can make a
[1:03:01] difference outside your gate you'll
[1:03:04] never treat Lazarus well
[1:03:06] correctly until you first find that
[1:03:09] secret place
[1:03:11] inwardly where Talent develops in
[1:03:14] solitude of prayer and patience and
[1:03:18] faith in sympathy and sweetness and then
[1:03:22] our character
[1:03:24] grows as we step out outside of the
[1:03:27] closet and we begin to interact now are
[1:03:30] you listening to me this this the prayer
[1:03:32] and this dedication that's when you be
[1:03:34] there's something that is being
[1:03:36] developed but your real character grows
[1:03:38] when You Face your
[1:03:39] spouse the real character begins to
[1:03:42] manifest when You Face your children the
[1:03:44] real character begins to manifest when
[1:03:45] you step outside your house into the
[1:03:48] street and you're confronted with
[1:03:49] Lazarus the beggar at your
[1:03:52] feet it must start somewhere
[1:03:57] A Home of
[1:03:58] Honor it's an honest
[1:04:00] house it's an unselfish house as much as
[1:04:04] you are able to make this practical I
[1:04:07] admonish you to do so could we stand and
[1:04:10] bow our heads
