[0:00] Isaiah 45:es 56 and 7. I am the Lord and
[0:05] there is none else. There is no God
[0:08] beside me. I girded thee, though thou
[0:10] hast not known me. That they may know
[0:14] from the rising of the sun and from the
[0:16] west that there is none beside me. I am
[0:19] the Lord and there is none else. I form
[0:23] the light and create darkness. I make
[0:25] peace and create evil. I the Lord do all
[0:30] these. Amen. You may be seated.
[0:34] I have a very unique title that um I've
[0:37] chosen for the service today and I'll
[0:40] spend a little bit of time on the outset
[0:42] explaining my choice of the word
[0:44] resolving here. But the title is
[0:46] resolving evil. We're not talking about
[0:48] you resolving to do evil. But we are
[0:51] looking at uh just even as this
[0:54] scripture already referenced, God says,
[0:55] "I create evil." And evil is something
[0:59] that's present in our lives. There's a
[1:00] lot of evil things that happen to us.
[1:03] And one of the things I've been thinking
[1:04] about a lot and we'll maybe try to give
[1:06] some context to it is some of the
[1:08] difficult situations we have found
[1:10] ourselves in in life. So it may be
[1:12] something past or things that we
[1:14] presently experience now. maybe
[1:16] consequences of decisions or something
[1:18] that's happened to us that weighs us
[1:20] down, that burdens us significantly. And
[1:22] those things can become uh uh
[1:26] debilitating. They can really uh you
[1:28] know work against us and our liberty in
[1:29] Christ and even understanding our lives.
[1:32] And so I'm using this phrase here uh
[1:35] just as a a title to help you kind of
[1:37] understand what I'm looking at is maybe
[1:39] just trying to resolve evil. What is it?
[1:41] Uh give it its place. Now I want to
[1:44] first define uh res a resolution.
[1:47] And so that's kind of what the uh
[1:50] working from resolving here. Resolution
[1:52] in music theory describes the movement
[1:54] of a chord from tension to rest. And all
[1:57] the musicians here I trust that you
[1:59] enjoy this uh particular part. But it's
[2:01] the movement of a chord from tension to
[2:04] rest from instability to stability. As
[2:07] we've been looking at music, I felt that
[2:09] this was a theme that we could use or
[2:11] principle in music we could use uh in
[2:13] this subject of resolving evil. And so
[2:16] when there's a resolution, there's a a
[2:18] note or some melodic line that flows
[2:21] from this state of anticipation to
[2:23] closure where you get the certain
[2:25] expectation and then it satisfies that
[2:27] expectation. So when that happens,
[2:29] there's this sense of release and this
[2:31] is in music theory and those that can
[2:33] play the guitar, you can be demonstrated
[2:35] on a piano. uh it occurs when the
[2:37] harmony or the melody lands on that that
[2:39] another stable chord. When that happens,
[2:41] that's considered or or pitch. That's
[2:43] the rest. And it's what's built up. You
[2:46] go, "Ah, that satisfies." I may have,
[2:48] should have, may have, should have,
[2:50] could have, maybe will have it
[2:52] demonstrated. Uh maybe I'll have Preston
[2:54] help me demonstrate this or Micah,
[2:56] somebody demonstrate so you can hear it
[2:58] audibly because it makes so much sense
[3:00] even as you hear it. But this tension or
[3:03] anticipation that's created by using
[3:05] these certain tones and we may get into
[3:08] more detail. The world might some might
[3:09] call it if you're a heavy metal fan the
[3:12] the devil's chord or the the evil
[3:14] trionee but some of that's just
[3:16] mythology. But as it is structured and
[3:18] it's used that tension or anticipation
[3:20] it's called dissonance. In music theory
[3:22] it's dissonance. And when it's resolved
[3:25] that stability and that closure rest
[3:28] it's called consonance. So there's this
[3:30] dissonance, this instability, this
[3:32] tension, uh this anticipation. But when
[3:34] it's satisfied, uh and and you feel this
[3:37] relief, that's that's called consonance.
[3:39] As brother Eleaser was ministering the
[3:41] last service about hope and there's this
[3:43] hope, this anticipation, this waiting
[3:46] and when it's satisfied, that's the rest
[3:47] for you've received it. And so this
[3:50] structure or system it gives as you
[3:52] listen to music it's one of the things
[3:53] especially in western music and songs
[3:56] that we enjoy in Christian music uh it
[3:58] gives this hearer as you're listening to
[4:00] music this feeling of completion and a
[4:03] sense of rest when it's satisfied when
[4:05] it resolves
[4:07] there's a particular piece entitled
[4:08] vexations I believe it was written in
[4:10] the late 1800s the whole piece is
[4:12] comprised solely of dissonance that
[4:14] never resolves and this is the entire
[4:16] piece I think it's they try to they
[4:17] wrestle with some of the notation about
[4:19] really how long you need to play this,
[4:20] but I think it saysund 840 times. And so
[4:24] it's something it's the sound is just
[4:25] over and over and over again and you
[4:27] keep waiting for it to finish. You know,
[4:29] when we sing a song and then we end on
[4:31] that one chord, we know that it's over.
[4:32] But if it stays on that same pitch or
[4:35] tone, we're thinking there's more to it.
[4:38] There's got to be more. There's a
[4:39] there's another verse coming. There's
[4:40] even one song we sing. I can't remember
[4:42] it offhand now, but it's like there's
[4:44] really no end to it because where the
[4:46] chorus ends, you have to immediately
[4:48] resolve back on the verse and then the
[4:50] verse has to go back into the chorus and
[4:52] then when you have chorus, it doesn't
[4:53] end. So, you got to go back to the verse
[4:55] and it just cycles over and over again.
[4:57] And so, there's you got to find that
[4:58] place to rest. You got to find that
[5:00] place where it all uh settles. And so,
[5:03] this very piece is called vexations. Why
[5:05] is it vexation? because there's
[5:07] something unsettling about those tones
[5:09] and about that sound that it doesn't
[5:12] resolve. And so dissonance or this
[5:14] instability is resolved when it moves to
[5:17] stability,
[5:18] &gt;&gt; when it moves to consonants, when you
[5:20] find that rest. And so in that in that
[5:24] you can see there's something that
[5:25] builds tension and instability, but then
[5:27] there it's resolved. When it's resolved,
[5:29] it brings rest.
[5:31] Now in Romans chapter 8 26-28
[5:36] I I want to use this scripture with that
[5:38] as kind of what my subject is using
[5:40] these musical terms and and if you have
[5:43] some familiarity with that yourself and
[5:45] you know how that feels with music. I
[5:47] want you to begin to recognize that life
[5:49] follows this pattern in Romans chapter 8
[5:51] beginning with verse 26. Likewise the
[5:54] spirit also helpeth our infirmities.
[5:56] This is a sickness. This is a weakness.
[5:58] For we know not what we should pray for
[6:00] as we ought, but the spirit itself
[6:02] maketh intercession for us with
[6:04] groanings which cannot be uttered. This
[6:06] is that grief and sorrow uh that you
[6:09] have that you can't utter, but the
[6:11] spirit's going to bring it forth. And he
[6:13] that searchth the hearts knoweth what
[6:15] the mind of the spirit. What is the mind
[6:16] of the spirit? Because he maketh
[6:18] intercession for the saints. And this
[6:20] phrase I believe is important according
[6:22] to the will of God. So there's
[6:24] intercession for infirmities, for
[6:27] weakness. There's grieving, there's
[6:28] sorrows, there's groanings that you
[6:30] can't utter that the spirit is going to
[6:32] make intercession for. And it's
[6:34] interceding according to the will of
[6:36] God. That there's these things present,
[6:39] but yet now God is the will of God is
[6:41] being is God is interceding that his
[6:44] will would still yet be accomplished, be
[6:46] resolved, be finished. And then in verse
[6:48] 20 it says, "And we know that all things
[6:51] work together for good to them that love
[6:54] God, to them who are the called
[6:56] according to his purpose."
[6:58] All things are even these infirmities,
[7:01] this groaning, this weakness, this
[7:03] sorrow, these things that we would have
[7:06] to plead God because of, these things
[7:09] that become the impetus for crying out,
[7:11] these things that become the cause of
[7:13] our groaning and our sadness. says, "All
[7:15] these things work together for good."
[7:17] And that word there means agreement,
[7:20] agreeable or or pleasant. They work for
[7:22] the good to them that love God, to them
[7:25] who are called according to his purpose.
[7:28] So in this infirmities and groanings in
[7:30] this scripture, and if you look even at
[7:33] some of the context in this chapter, the
[7:35] sufferings, the persecution, the the
[7:37] famine, the nakedness, the peril, all
[7:39] the things that we might suffer,
[7:41] uh we would see these things as being
[7:43] afflictions. It would be evil. It'd be
[7:45] wicked to endure it or it's not fun.
[7:46] Nothing you'd want to volunteer for. And
[7:49] so I want to take an honest look at
[7:50] evil. Maybe we could use the term
[7:52] dissonance a little bit. But it's this
[7:55] evil that is implied in all things
[7:59] because it doesn't give a qualification.
[8:01] As a matter of fact, again, you read it
[8:02] in the context of chapter 8, you're
[8:04] going to realize, wow, there's a lot of
[8:05] things we suffer, a lot of things we go
[8:07] through. There's a lot of uh uh things
[8:09] that we're oppressed with and a lot of
[8:10] loss we experience and dreams we have
[8:13] that are shattered and relationships uh
[8:15] that we relied upon that go away,
[8:17] there's a lot of things that are very
[8:18] very difficult. But yet all those things
[8:20] are implied in all things.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; And as much as we would like to just be
[8:26] numb to it and maybe if we could just
[8:28] run fast enough we could get away from
[8:29] it, I think maybe it's sometimes it's
[8:31] necessary instead of just trying to
[8:33] forget all about it but wrestle with the
[8:35] bad in our life. Not trying to get you
[8:38] to go back and question your salvation.
[8:40] Not trying to get you to dig up some
[8:42] things in your past to trigger you, but
[8:44] those things that are haunting that you
[8:46] can't quite figure out. Maybe sometimes
[8:48] we need to take a look at it and
[8:49] understand what God's doing.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; In James chapter 1, we start read with
[8:54] verse 16 to 18.
[8:58] the uh and I want to I want us I want to
[9:02] just move a little bit here and just
[9:04] begin to look at how perfect God is. One
[9:06] of the things that I was thinking about
[9:08] is uh when we preached on beauty and
[9:10] symmetry and perfection and all these
[9:13] things and yet you you have this idea
[9:16] all things are perfect, everything is
[9:17] good, everything's pleasant and then
[9:20] well where does the uh where does
[9:22] brokenness fit into that? Where does
[9:23] disfigurement and where does sickness
[9:25] and pain and why would Jesus still be
[9:28] scarred after the resurrection? And so
[9:30] there is still yet and and think about
[9:32] this not giving away too much here but
[9:35] this is in my heart Lord willing we're
[9:37] tracking this but there's something
[9:38] about brokenness God loves
[9:40] &gt;&gt; because it's a broken heart that
[9:42] contrite spirit he can't he can't
[9:44] refuse.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; So it's not he's not turned away by
[9:47] that. So there's uh uh these there's
[9:50] things in our lives that we can't quite
[9:51] resolve on our own. They're a paradox to
[9:54] us. And so I want to look at this
[9:56] perfection of God because I think this
[9:57] is where it begins for us as we think
[9:59] well man if there's any bad I'm in
[10:02] trouble. James chapter 1. Do not heir my
[10:05] beloved brethren. Every good gift and
[10:07] every perfect gift is from above and
[10:09] cometh down from the father of lights
[10:12] with whom is no variableness neither
[10:13] shadow of turning. And in this we can
[10:15] see that good comes from God. Every good
[10:18] gift and every perfect gift whatever
[10:20] tends to holiness or glory or consenance
[10:23] agreeableness peace that comes from God.
[10:26] Verse 17 is saying whatever is good
[10:28] comes from God. There's no darkness or
[10:31] change in him at all. And in the context
[10:35] of this very chapter in verses 13 to 15
[10:37] as he's looking through these things
[10:39] evil cannot come from God. When a man is
[10:41] sins he can't say God made me sin. When
[10:44] a man is tempted, he cannot say God uh
[10:46] uh God made me sin because God evil does
[10:49] not come from God. Neither can God be
[10:52] tempted by evil.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; But he says he's the father of lights.
[10:56] And in verse 18, this father of light of
[10:58] his own will begat he us with the word
[11:01] of truth that we should be a kind of
[11:03] first fruits of his creatures. So the
[11:06] father of light has created you by the
[11:08] word. A father in whom there is no
[11:13] darkness. A father in whom there's no
[11:15] change or variableness and one who
[11:17] there's only good gifts and every
[11:19] perfect gift is in him. So if he has
[11:21] fathered us and brought us forth by his
[11:24] word, by the word of truth. So it's not
[11:26] God with something else. It's God by the
[11:28] word produces this God word child, the
[11:32] son or daughter of God. Then it gives us
[11:34] the expectation of having the same
[11:36] quality or character.
[11:38] In 1 Peterap 1 23, Peter said, "Being
[11:41] born again, not of corruptible seed, but
[11:43] of incorruptible by the word of God,
[11:45] which liveth and abideth forever." So
[11:48] when we are born again, we are born by
[11:50] this eternal seed of God, which cannot
[11:52] be corrupted. There's no corruption in
[11:54] it. There's no darkness in it. There's
[11:55] no death in it. There's only life,
[11:57] perfect life, perfectly eternal life.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; So we have a God who is our father that
[12:04] doesn't birth or bring forth mistakes.
[12:07] doesn't birth or bring forth sin.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; And so immediately if we are a child of
[12:13] God and something we do something wrong
[12:15] or something bad happens, then there's
[12:17] this room where the devil can say,
[12:19] "Would God do that?" Right? There's only
[12:21] two forces in the world, good and evil.
[12:24] And then you you you drink uh um some
[12:26] spoiled milk and get a stomach ache and
[12:27] I've been infiltrated with evil. Right?
[12:30] Because there's only two thing two
[12:32] choices. And so it can become very
[12:34] overwhelming. In Genesis chapter 1,
[12:36] we're going to end the chapter with
[12:37] verse 31 and pick up the next chapter 2
[12:39] with verses 1, 2, and three. So, I'm
[12:41] using these together, I want to see this
[12:44] work of God. Every good and perfect gift
[12:45] comes from God. At this point, this may
[12:48] more flow as um just kind of a you just
[12:51] kind of stay with me as it will just
[12:53] move maybe with some momentum through
[12:55] the rest of this thought. And God saw
[12:57] everything that he had made and behold,
[12:59] it was very good. Here he is on the
[13:02] sixth day of creation and the evening
[13:04] and the morning were the sixth day. God
[13:06] is satisfied. This is pleasant. This is
[13:08] agreeable. Eden actually means this is
[13:10] harmonious to me. This agrees with me.
[13:12] This is my pleasure. This is pleasuring
[13:14] to me. God's garden of pleasure. Thus
[13:18] the heaven and the earth were finished
[13:20] and all the host of them. There's this
[13:21] completion, this rest. So on the seventh
[13:23] day, God ended his work which he had
[13:25] made. And he rested on the seventh day
[13:27] from all his work which he had made. And
[13:29] God blessed the seventh day and it
[13:31] sanctified it because that in it he had
[13:33] rested from all his work which God
[13:35] created and made
[13:39] at the end of chapter 1 and at the
[13:41] beginning of chapter 2 we could see this
[13:44] is a picture of beauty perfect beauty
[13:47] it's perfectly harmonious there's
[13:49] nothing disagreeable God looking at
[13:51] these things and saying oh this is good
[13:53] this is very good even see according to
[13:55] the message of the hour and even
[13:57] biblically where that after man had been
[13:59] created and man was doing a work that
[14:01] God drawing the woman out of the man.
[14:03] It's even happening within the context
[14:05] of creation. So when God looks at it,
[14:07] he's not he's not stopping and saying
[14:09] this is bad, nothing's good. He says
[14:11] this is very good. I'm resting on this
[14:14] and I think there could be there's room
[14:16] maybe for some different uh
[14:17] interpretations and I'm certainly not
[14:19] wanting to make a doctrine out of that.
[14:20] But it sure it sure looks like even
[14:22] according to things brother Brandham has
[14:24] said and according to the Bible that
[14:26] even Eve comes forth before that day of
[14:28] rest.
[14:30] And but yet we could look at this and
[14:32] say even if there was something lacking
[14:34] God would only be bringing forth another
[14:37] evolution or or another piece. It
[14:40] wouldn't be something like oh no what
[14:41] have I done? I've marred my own
[14:42] creation. He'd be bringing out of what
[14:44] already existed. So there was nothing uh
[14:47] dissonant about the garden and Satan's
[14:49] Eden. Brother Ram said there was no
[14:51] evil. It was perfect peace, perfect
[14:53] harmony, everything in perfection. And
[14:56] when God had it under his control, he
[14:58] had his world. He had it all. He had all
[15:01] in operation. He had everything coming,
[15:03] everything eating vegetations. There's
[15:05] your quote, vegetarians right there,
[15:07] eating everything, eating vegetations.
[15:09] Nothing to die, nothing to be ruined,
[15:11] nothing to be spoiled. It was just
[15:13] perfect. And over it all, he placed his
[15:15] beloved children, his son and daughter,
[15:17] a husband and wife, to control it.
[15:19] everything perfect and he said when God
[15:22] rested he placed his son and daughter
[15:24] there and he rest and it's after that
[15:25] rest that Satan comes in. So this is
[15:28] God's pleasure garden. At the end of
[15:29] chapter two, we can say this is
[15:31] creation. This is perfect. Everything's
[15:33] great in oneness. He said the first man
[15:35] and first woman in the garden even were
[15:37] in perfect harmony with God. So much
[15:40] that God could come down at any time. He
[15:43] desired and to talk lipto ear with Adam
[15:46] and Eve. Now that is perfect
[15:49] oneness. God and his creation. God
[15:52] speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve.
[15:54] And they were so perfect in harmony with
[15:56] God till they were one with God. Notice
[15:59] we could borrow maybe just a musical use
[16:02] of that term harmony. But no matter they
[16:04] were there's all these different levels
[16:06] and levels of creation and different
[16:07] needs. There's there's plants. There's
[16:09] creeping things. There's trees. There's
[16:11] fruits. There's birds. There's fish.
[16:13] There's beast of the field. And there's
[16:15] man and woman. And there's so many
[16:17] different levels. Things of the ground,
[16:19] things of the sea, water, earth, there's
[16:21] sky, there's heavens. so many different
[16:23] variations. It wasn't just
[16:25] monochromatic. Everything is beautiful
[16:27] and varied, but yet God looks at it and
[16:29] they're all in harmony.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; They they are all uh working together.
[16:34] It wasn't just one mass of everything
[16:36] looking exactly the same and everybody
[16:38] repeating the same thing, but in their
[16:40] differences and their different pitches
[16:41] and tones and textures, in all the
[16:44] different ways that God was expressing
[16:46] this beautiful masterpiece, it blended
[16:48] together in perfect harmony.
[16:51] And then as we open chapter 3, and I'm
[16:54] I'm very much self-aware as to how much
[16:56] I use these uh instances in scripture
[17:00] and and so if it's if it's a crutch for
[17:02] me, then the Lord will help me to move
[17:04] beyond it. But let's just trust that
[17:06] there's things here we can continue to
[17:08] explore and get out of this. But in
[17:10] Genesis 3:1, now the serpent was more
[17:13] subtle than any beast of the field which
[17:15] the Lord God had made. And he said unto
[17:17] the woman, "Ya hath God said, 'Ye shall
[17:19] not eat of every tree in the garden." If
[17:23] we're looking at the first two chapters
[17:24] of as a symphony, and beautiful things
[17:26] are unfolding and and every the birds
[17:28] are chirping and and and now when you
[17:31] get to chapter 3, it's that part in the
[17:34] movie where the music changes
[17:36] &gt;&gt; and you know something bad's about to
[17:38] happen
[17:40] and all of a sudden the serpent starts
[17:42] talking. And so there is something uh
[17:45] that that is interjecting here that
[17:48] interrupts it suddenly.
[17:50] It feels like this picture changes and
[17:52] you can feel tension.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; Everything's beautiful. But then one day
[17:56] a question is asked. Hath God said you
[17:58] shall not eat of every tree of the
[18:00] garden?
[18:02] &gt;&gt; And we know what begins to unfold. But
[18:04] at that very moment
[18:06] the the harmony that was there is being
[18:09] challenged. And as that's challenged,
[18:12] how that that it how it moves is to a
[18:14] place to where it's lost.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; How how does it get to this point? It's
[18:22] perfect. Everything's absolutely
[18:24] perfect, but then all of a sudden it's
[18:26] not.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; And we see the serpent that is this uh
[18:30] that instigates
[18:33] this evil that comes. But as we look at
[18:36] it in Genesis 1:es 24 and 25 and God
[18:41] said, "Let the earth bring forth a
[18:42] living creature after his kind, cattle
[18:44] and creeping thing, those things which
[18:46] crawl upon the earth, and the beast of
[18:48] the earth after his kind." And it was
[18:49] so. And God made the beast of the earth
[18:51] after his kind, and the cattle after
[18:53] their kind, and everything that creepeth
[18:55] upon the earth after his kind. And God
[18:57] saw that it was good.
[19:00] So the serpent was created on this sixth
[19:03] day. He's included in the good. God
[19:06] didn't it doesn't say and I don't
[19:08] believe it's hiding anything from us
[19:10] because that's the very thing the
[19:11] serpent was suggesting to Eve is that
[19:12] when God looked at creation on that
[19:14] sixth day and say and created these this
[19:16] cattle and everything that creeped upon
[19:17] the earth when he made the serpent a and
[19:20] he made the beast that would walk
[19:21] upright when he created these things on
[19:24] that day. He looks at this this this
[19:27] from the beast serpent, the serpent that
[19:29] stands upright to the one that would
[19:31] crawl upon and creep on the crawling on
[19:33] the ground. He looked at all of these on
[19:35] that day and he said, "It's good."
[19:38] &gt;&gt; He doesn't say, "And one of you is a
[19:39] devil." Right? Like Jesus did to his
[19:42] disciples.
[19:44] The serpent's included in the good. Yet
[19:47] now the serpent is being used to tempt
[19:50] women
[19:51] and not just tempt her but slander God.
[19:54] Right?
[19:56] &gt;&gt; And it's something perfectly harmonious.
[19:59] Now, there's slandering of God. And the
[20:02] focus of the serpent's discussion that
[20:04] day is about God's creation and the
[20:06] purpose of God's uh of creation in God's
[20:09] word. God's word. What's the purpose of
[20:10] God's word? You shall not eat of this
[20:12] and you shall eat of that. What's the
[20:14] purpose of it? What's God trying to
[20:15] accomplish? Is he hiding something from
[20:17] you? Is what are the consequences of it?
[20:21] It's not a I would say it's
[20:24] uh it's distilled into symbolic
[20:26] language, but it's focused on God's
[20:28] creation and the purpose of God's word
[20:29] and even the consequences for violating
[20:31] it.
[20:34] Everything in perfect harmony,
[20:36] stability, consonants.
[20:38] The melody is just flowing wonderfully.
[20:41] Yet within the framework of God's Eden,
[20:44] there's temptation.
[20:46] And with the temptation tension, the
[20:49] question itself is God said that you
[20:50] shall not eat of every tree of the
[20:51] garden. And the woman's like, well,
[20:54] yeah, he said that we can eat except for
[20:56] this one. He's like, yeah, but and what
[20:59] is that? That's that this uneasiness.
[21:02] Well, wait a minute. You can remember
[21:04] when somebody begin to tell you, well,
[21:06] you know that that's not right. And you
[21:07] begin to feel when you get corrected or
[21:09] somebody comes up to you and says, did
[21:10] you hear did you hear this? Did you hear
[21:11] about that? and something this happened
[21:12] and that happened and this happened and
[21:13] that happened and all a sudden you start
[21:14] to feel like un an anxious
[21:16] &gt;&gt; a little uneasy. Well, what what do you
[21:19] mean? I I I didn't know about that. I
[21:20] didn't hear about that. Maybe even if
[21:21] it's criticisms of what you believe and
[21:23] certain rumors or certain lies about
[21:25] people you love and all it's like wait
[21:27] the tension begins to build.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. And in that moment in
[21:31] God's perfect Eden,
[21:34] the tone had changed.
[21:37] And it's the question about the tree,
[21:39] partaking of the tree of knowledge of
[21:40] good and evil. And when we see that God
[21:43] created the serpent, you also find that
[21:46] God put the tree there.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 2:es 8 and 9, the Lord
[21:50] God planted a garden eastward in Eden.
[21:52] And there he put the man whom he had
[21:53] formed. And out of the ground made the
[21:55] Lord God to grow every tree that is
[21:57] pleasant to the sight and good for food.
[22:00] The tree of life also. So these are
[22:02] trees that are not good for food. These
[22:03] are trees that do not grow out of the
[22:04] ground. The scripture is very explicit
[22:06] about this. The tree of life also in the
[22:08] midst of the garden and the tree of
[22:10] knowledge of good and evil. So God has
[22:14] planted this tree or we could say God
[22:16] has created this tree and it's not a
[22:18] tree that's purely evil but it's a tree
[22:20] of knowledge of good and evil.
[22:24] This is a a very unique tree. This is a
[22:27] tree that's used in a lot of different
[22:29] ways in the message. It's used in
[22:31] different ways in scripture. There's a
[22:33] lot of rich symbolism when it comes to
[22:34] it. But this tree of knowledge of good
[22:37] and evil was put there by God. Then in
[22:39] verse 16 and 17, the Lord God commanded
[22:42] the man, saying, "Of every tree of the
[22:43] garden, thou mayest freely eat, of those
[22:45] ones which grew out of the ground and
[22:47] were good for food." But now he
[22:48] addresses this other tree so that
[22:50] there's no confusion. but of the tree of
[22:52] the knowledge of good and evil. Thou
[22:54] shalt not eat of it.
[22:56] Does not prohibit them from eating of
[22:58] the tree of life.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; But he is prohibiting them from eating
[23:02] of this tree of the knowledge of good
[23:04] and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. And
[23:06] now he gives this consequence. For in
[23:08] the day that thou eatest thereof, thou
[23:10] shalt surely die.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Is God not great enough to where he
[23:14] could have put the tree there and told
[23:16] them not to eat it, but yet not said if
[23:18] you eat it, you die? I mean, couldn't
[23:20] they just lose some clout, right?
[23:22] Couldn't they just like Sonet the
[23:24] Hedgehog just lose a bunch of rings as
[23:25] soon as it happens or something?
[23:27] Couldn't they find a softer landing for
[23:30] violating this? But God, the one that's
[23:31] in control of everything, says this day
[23:34] that you eat of this, you die.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; And the majority of the Christian world
[23:40] believes, literally believes that it was
[23:43] a fruit that would have had very little,
[23:46] very little nutritional value.
[23:49] that God just simply said don't eat to
[23:52] test them on their obedience
[23:56] &gt;&gt; and they've reduced it. Goes to tell you
[23:58] a lot how much maybe modern Christianity
[24:00] struggles with food
[24:03] &gt;&gt; because it's just like don't eat that or
[24:05] you're going to die. Well, I think a lot
[24:06] of us don't have a problem with that,
[24:08] right? If you eat it, it's going to kill
[24:09] you. Who wants to go to the puffer fish
[24:11] buffet today
[24:14] &gt;&gt; in in Chandler
[24:15] &gt;&gt; or Gilbert? It had to be in Gilbert.
[24:18] We be like, "I don't I don't know about
[24:20] that, brother Aaron. This is a very
[24:22] poisonous frog. We should eat it." I
[24:25] don't know about that, brother Aaron.
[24:27] But yet, there's this idea modern
[24:29] Christianity that it was a literal fruit
[24:31] and that God just said, you know, don't
[24:32] eat that one
[24:34] &gt;&gt; because if you eat it, I'm going to kill
[24:35] you.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; But God wasn't saying if you eat that
[24:39] apple, I'm going to kill you. But he's
[24:40] saying there's something about this tree
[24:43] that it represents or that it can do to
[24:45] you that's going to upset my program.
[24:47] It's going to change the way things are
[24:50] and the way that I've established
[24:51] things, the things that you ought to eat
[24:52] and the tree of life. And so if you eat
[24:55] of it, it will cause you to die. It will
[24:58] result in death.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; The day they ate it, God didn't slay
[25:01] them, but let the process run its course
[25:03] and eventually they died, never living
[25:05] out that day.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "In the Garden of
[25:07] Eden, there were two trees. One was
[25:09] good, one was evil. One produced life,
[25:12] the other produced death. There's some
[25:15] controversy on different levels about
[25:17] what this tree was. Brother Bam said it
[25:19] was the woman. In another place, he says
[25:21] in the church age book, he's basically
[25:22] saying it was the wicked one. We can see
[25:24] that mankind, man, women are all can be
[25:27] represented by trees. But this tree of
[25:30] life represented the righteous one.
[25:33] The tree of knowledge of good and evil
[25:36] is now associated with the wicked one.
[25:39] So right there in the garden of Eden,
[25:42] God places the man and woman in
[25:45] perfection, in perfect harmony with the
[25:47] possibility
[25:49] of being tempted.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; And in acting on that temptation, death.
[25:55] that there was this possibility yet with
[25:57] all the perfection there was this
[25:59] commandment of don't do this because the
[26:02] consequences are death and that's why
[26:05] God fortified his children behind the
[26:06] word if everything was peace and safety
[26:08] and everything was perfect why would God
[26:10] need fortification
[26:12] &gt;&gt; maybe these are philosophical questions
[26:13] just to chew on a little bit but yet God
[26:15] places them there with the nearness of
[26:18] temptation and the consequence of that
[26:20] decision would have significant
[26:22] ramifications
[26:23] now I don't think any of us would
[26:25] mistake ourselves as being in Eden. Not
[26:26] quite yet. Maybe in four months it'll
[26:28] feel a bit more like one. But yet we
[26:30] realize just how near mistakes are or
[26:33] how large consequences are to things
[26:35] that we've said or things that we've
[26:37] done and we live with those
[26:38] consequences. Some people have done
[26:39] things that have resulted accidents and
[26:42] tragedies where people close to them
[26:43] have died. And so this is the reality of
[26:46] life where there's temptation nearby and
[26:49] there's consequences
[26:51] &gt;&gt; if we partake in it.
[26:54] In Deuteronomy 30 19 in the Exodus,
[26:58] they're near Jordan in the plains of
[26:59] Moab. They've journeyed in the
[27:00] wilderness all these years. And now, as
[27:02] they get ready to leave this wilderness,
[27:06] as they are in this wilderness of death
[27:09] and wandering and and starvation,
[27:12] they're getting ready to enter back into
[27:15] this land flowing with milk and honey,
[27:18] the more fertile ground, perhaps more
[27:20] centrally located to this Garden of
[27:22] Eden. says, "I I call heaven and earth
[27:24] to record this day against you that I
[27:26] have set before you life and death,
[27:29] blessing and cursing.
[27:31] Therefore, choose life that both thou
[27:33] and thy seed may live." Israel's now
[27:37] having to choose between life and death.
[27:41] It resembles
[27:43] the exodus out of Eden. Having made the
[27:46] choice of death, they're thrust into the
[27:48] wilderness.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; Away from a land flowing with honey and
[27:52] a land flowing with milk and vegetation
[27:54] and nothing having to die. And God had
[27:57] set before them what? Life and death.
[28:00] What did they choose? They chose death.
[28:02] Here God in the Exodus again, it's kind
[28:04] of in a reverse image where now he sets
[28:06] before them life and death. You have a
[28:08] choice to make and consequences to live
[28:12] with.
[28:15] Now this evil that we see arise in
[28:19] Genesis chapter 3
[28:23] was not made by God or it doesn't have
[28:26] its genesis in Genesis 1. This evil was
[28:29] not made by God within the context of
[28:30] Genesis chapter 1 and Genesis chapter 2
[28:32] wherein God is creating on the first
[28:34] day, second day, third day, fourth day
[28:36] and then somewhere in the sixth day God
[28:37] kind of created evil and just kind of
[28:39] hid it from us. Uh but yet it began
[28:43] in heaven
[28:45] &gt;&gt; in Exodus 28:13. It says, "Thou hast
[28:48] been in Eden, the garden of God." So
[28:50] Satan is in Eden.
[28:53] He is there in Eden. He's the one that's
[28:55] using the the susceptibility of the
[28:58] serpent, this enchanter. He's using this
[29:01] one to cause
[29:03] uh to cause this tension and temptation
[29:06] in the garden to get the woman
[29:09] to choose death.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Reminds me of even how the non could not
[29:15] curse Israel, but he talked he taught
[29:19] bail how to cause Israel to bring a
[29:22] curse upon themselves.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; And so the serpent is trying to do this.
[29:26] He can't curse the woman. He can't
[29:27] indwell the woman. He can't infiltrate
[29:29] her and can't make her move. So, she's
[29:31] got to make the decision on her own
[29:32] accord. And so, Satan is in Eden, but he
[29:35] was first in heaven.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Verse 15 says, "Thou was perfect in thy
[29:39] ways from the day that thou was created
[29:43] till iniquity was found in thee."
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; God created Lucifer perfect.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Thou was perfect in thy ways. There was
[29:53] this God fashioning Lucifer and and and
[29:56] making him a as this angel, this
[29:59] right-hand man, and we've read recently
[30:02] how he made him with music and tabs and
[30:04] had this great glory. He's perfect in
[30:07] the day that he's created until
[30:10] iniquity is found.
[30:15] It's iniquity is evil. In the Hebrew,
[30:18] it's evil. It's dissonance.
[30:21] He's perfect. And now all of a sudden
[30:23] he's not perfect.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; God created him perfect. He's leading
[30:27] worship. He's the right-hand man. He's
[30:28] equal to God in every way, but he can't
[30:29] create.
[30:31] But then through rebellion, it's found.
[30:34] It's apprehended. He attains to
[30:35] dissonance.
[30:39] He hit the trionee, right? All of a
[30:42] sudden, Lucifer is over there. No, there
[30:44] he found a tone. He found a he he found
[30:47] iniquity, evil in him. It lacked the
[30:50] harmony. In Isaiah 14:12 said, "How art
[30:54] thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son
[30:56] of the morning?" How art thou cut down
[30:58] to the ground which does weaken the
[31:00] nations? Lucifer means lightbearer
[31:04] bearer. He was a a bearer of light as a
[31:06] light carrier. He he carries light. He's
[31:09] the shining one. He's the morning star,
[31:11] the son of the morning, the morning
[31:13] star. How art thou fallen from heaven,
[31:15] oh Lucifer? He had was in heaven and
[31:19] then there's iniquity that he attains to
[31:21] this evil this dissonance that he
[31:23] attains to and then once he attains to
[31:25] that it says that he has fallen from
[31:27] heaven.
[31:28] Revelations 12:es 7 to9 there's
[31:31] different applications for these things
[31:33] and their compound type. It says and
[31:34] there was war in heaven. Michael and his
[31:37] angels fought against the dragon and the
[31:38] dragon fought and his angels and he
[31:40] prevailed not neither was their place
[31:42] found anymore in heaven
[31:44] and the great dragon was cast out. That
[31:46] old serpent called the devil and Satan.
[31:48] Now we just covered all the bases
[31:50] &gt;&gt; which deceiveth the whole world. He was
[31:53] cast out into the earth and his angels
[31:55] were cast out with him.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; This is where we find Satan on earth in
[32:00] the garden.
[32:03] Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of
[32:04] God. So where did where did evil begin?
[32:08] It began in heaven.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; And it's c. So if we've ever thought of
[32:12] a place of perfection, heaven, right?
[32:14] That's a perfect place. God, this
[32:17] invisible God who dwells in a realm by
[32:18] himself, created this heaven. And this
[32:21] realm that he existed in as the logos
[32:23] with angels and all these created things
[32:25] there in there,
[32:27] Lucifer, this bright star, this
[32:29] lightbearer, attained to evil and God
[32:33] cast it down to earth.
[32:35] And that's why we find him in the garden
[32:37] of God. That's why the Bible says he had
[32:40] fallen from heaven.
[32:43] When iniquity was found in heaven, God
[32:45] addressed it and he brought peace.
[32:49] He re resolved the evil by casting it
[32:51] out.
[32:53] And there's this pattern, this
[32:55] architecture, maybe rhythm in the word
[32:58] that teaches us something about God.
[33:02] When evil was attained to in heaven, he
[33:04] cast it down to earth. Genesis 1:es 1
[33:08] and 2. In the beginning, God created the
[33:10] heaven and the earth, and the earth was
[33:12] without form and void, and darkness was
[33:14] upon the face of the deep, and the
[33:17] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[33:19] waters.
[33:21] I love looking at this scripture and
[33:22] considering this is how God chose to
[33:24] open up the Bible. We see the bride and
[33:28] the bridegroom. In the very first verse,
[33:30] God created the heaven, Christ, and the
[33:32] earth, the bride, his body. that here is
[33:34] God with his bridegroom and his bride,
[33:37] God with his family in the very first
[33:38] verse. But then as he starts to unpack
[33:41] this, he says, "The earth was without
[33:42] form and void and darkness is upon the
[33:44] face of the deep." These are words that
[33:46] imply instability, chaos, confusion.
[33:50] I
[33:51] &gt;&gt; It's something that is unresolved,
[33:53] something that uh has a an anxiousness
[33:56] to it.
[33:58] says in Jeremiah 4:23, I I beheld the
[34:01] earth and lo, it was without form and
[34:03] void and the heavens and they had no
[34:05] light. The languages it was wasted. It
[34:08] was chaotic. There was confusion.
[34:10] It was without form and void and the
[34:12] heavens had no light. So there's it's
[34:16] such a massive confusion that it's
[34:18] really not even discernible what it is.
[34:20] In the darkness, we can imagine a lot of
[34:22] things. A and who knows what the sounds
[34:25] would have been, what things, what
[34:26] shadows and what what horrible condition
[34:29] and state that was at that moment. And
[34:33] this is the chaos Satan is cast down
[34:35] into.
[34:38] And now let's look at Genesis 3 7-10
[34:43] because I want to compare this state in
[34:45] Jeremiah 1:2, excuse me, Genesis 1:2 and
[34:49] Jeremiah 4 to the state of mankind
[34:53] immediately after the fall.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; So now that they have partaken of the
[34:57] fruit, the woman with the serpent, now
[35:00] the woman brings it to Adam, and the
[35:01] eyes of them both were opened and they
[35:03] knew that they were naked.
[35:08] So this is a an awareness,
[35:11] a cognitive awakening that they hadn't
[35:14] yet had to their condition and their
[35:17] perception is different because they
[35:18] were naked and not ashamed. Now their
[35:20] shame associated with this nakedness and
[35:22] they sewed fig leaves together
[35:25] and made themselves aprons. Now I think
[35:28] can't remember uh who was ministering on
[35:31] it uh while we were away but said you
[35:33] know how doesn't we don't know maybe
[35:35] maybe it was brother Reggie. We don't
[35:36] know how long it was from the moment
[35:38] they sinned to the time that God begins
[35:40] to come. But think of this time, this
[35:43] moment where the panic sets in. And now
[35:46] it's what do we do? Could there have
[35:48] been nights of wrestling with this?
[35:52] When is God going to address this?
[35:53] Usually he comes down in the cool of the
[35:55] evening. He didn't come this time. How
[35:56] long did it take place? Over what time
[35:58] period is this state of agony unfolding?
[36:01] Let's sew fig leaves together. Let's
[36:03] cover ourselves.
[36:06] And they heard the voice of the Lord God
[36:07] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[36:09] day. And Adam and his wife hid
[36:11] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[36:13] God among the trees of the garden. And a
[36:16] lot of those places I was reading last
[36:18] week about perfect harmony. God would
[36:19] say God would come down. He's we read
[36:21] already. He talk lip to ear to them.
[36:22] This personal intimate relationship.
[36:24] Nothing's out of cater. You ever had
[36:26] those times when maybe you need to say
[36:27] something? You need to have a difficult
[36:29] conversation. It's time for a little bit
[36:31] of uh uh dialogue. And so you're going
[36:33] to come together and you're going to
[36:34] have this you need to have this
[36:35] conversation and let's just go on a walk
[36:38] eight miles later, right? You're still
[36:40] talking about innocuous things. You
[36:42] can't quite bring up because you're
[36:43] uncomfortable.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Or maybe you know this kind of those
[36:46] things like you know it's like uh can
[36:48] you please come in my office? I need to
[36:49] talk to you. I like saying that to
[36:51] people on Sunday mornings. I need you in
[36:53] my office after service. Just leave it
[36:54] at that. You know, what happened? What
[36:56] happened? What did I do? What did I do?
[36:58] That's me. As soon as someone says,
[36:59] "Aaron, can I give you a call?" I'm
[37:00] like, "Oh no. What have I done? What
[37:01] have I done?
[37:03] It's just a complex and uh there's this
[37:06] sense of the the way that they must have
[37:09] been reacting and feeling and now God is
[37:12] going to come. He's going to walk in the
[37:13] garden. And they hide themselves with so
[37:15] much fear.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; And the Lord called unto Adam said, "And
[37:19] where art thou?" And he said, "I heard
[37:21] thy voice in the garden, and I was
[37:23] afraid because I was naked, and I hid
[37:25] myself."
[37:27] the the response of Adam and the woman
[37:30] after the fall is just as chaotic and
[37:33] unstable as the beginning.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; That now in this place that they
[37:37] presently set, there's this fear that
[37:39] grips them. In this fear, there's this
[37:42] panic.
[37:44] And in the panic, there's this complete
[37:46] forgetfulness because now, now that
[37:49] they've eaten the fruit, they know all
[37:50] things. And in this state of
[37:52] enlightenment, they know they can play
[37:53] hide-and-seek with God and he won't be
[37:54] able to see them. doesn't know where
[37:55] they are. Hey,
[37:58] that that's exactly where their mind had
[38:00] gone. It's so unstable. It's so chaotic.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; And this is the condition of the earth.
[38:11] This is a condition of mankind in
[38:12] Genesis 3. And it mirrors this condition
[38:14] of the heavens and earth in Genesis
[38:16] chapter 1 verse two. But verse three,
[38:19] chapter 1 says, "And God said, let there
[38:22] be light." Now something begins to
[38:23] transform. Something begins to change.
[38:26] Let there be light and there was light.
[38:28] And God saw the light and he says that's
[38:31] good. And God divided the light from the
[38:34] darkness.
[38:36] And God called the light day and the
[38:39] darkness he called night and the evening
[38:41] and the morning were the first day. So
[38:44] you recognize what's happening here. The
[38:46] earth is chaotic and the heavens are
[38:49] dark. A and the earth is without form
[38:52] and it's it's vanity. It's vexation.
[38:54] There's nothing discernible. There's no
[38:56] shape or form that's pleasing. And then
[38:58] God brings light and he calls it day.
[39:01] And he says, "Darkness, you're still
[39:02] here. We'll call you night."
[39:06] Verse 18 and 19, he says, "And to rule
[39:08] over the day and over the night, and to
[39:11] divide the light from the darkness. And
[39:13] God saw that it was good." These are
[39:14] these lesser and greater lights. And the
[39:17] evening and the morning were the fourth
[39:19] day.
[39:21] I don't have a lot more on my heart to
[39:22] share with you this morning in terms of
[39:24] how much I I I think I want to cover it.
[39:26] So maybe closing here very soon. But if
[39:29] you could just catch this principle in
[39:30] the very beginning that God doesn't
[39:33] completely do away with darkness.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; When there was darkness, there was chaos
[39:38] and confusion. When God said, "Let there
[39:40] be light," it wasn't darkness is gone.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; All gone. Never. Never any more
[39:45] darkness. He leaves the darkness
[39:49] &gt;&gt; and he uses it.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; So he doesn't abolish it, but he uses it
[39:54] and he ordains these intervals of light
[39:56] and darkness.
[39:58] There's going to be this rhythm. There's
[40:01] going to be even if we broke it into uh
[40:03] uh three different eighthour uh sections
[40:08] in in in a day and then we put it into
[40:11] two 12-hour periods that cover that that
[40:14] whole three uh three tones that would
[40:17] cover 24 hours. God divided it all
[40:19] mathematically, musically.
[40:22] He says, "I'll still use I can still use
[40:25] that darkness."
[40:27] For he said in Isaiah 45:7, "I form the
[40:30] light and create darkness. I make peace
[40:33] and create evil. I the Lord do all these
[40:37] things."
[40:40] &gt;&gt; This darkness that exists on earth,
[40:45] God says, "Let there be light." And now
[40:47] the light imposes itself upon the
[40:49] darkness.
[40:51] But he says, "I formed the light." And
[40:53] by forming light, what are you going
[40:55] what are you going to have? darkness.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; I make peace and where there's peace,
[41:00] there has to be the opposite,
[41:02] &gt;&gt; this evil.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; There is
[41:06] uh we we like to say no justice, no
[41:07] peace, right? And if there's if there's
[41:11] if there's peace, there has to be evil
[41:13] because that peace is tranquility and
[41:15] rest from the evil.
[41:23] I form the light
[41:25] and I make peace. God uses light and
[41:28] peace. These are even characteristics of
[41:29] himself. He is consonants. He is
[41:31] stability. But then he allows darkness
[41:33] and evil. The dissonance, the
[41:35] instability.
[41:38] I form the light. I make peace.
[41:42] Darkness is created and evil is created.
[41:44] There's this what this speaks to what
[41:46] God allows to fulfill his will.
[41:51] Form it means he predestinates.
[41:54] He ordains to make. It means he fashions
[41:56] or he uses. I form the light. I create
[41:59] darkness. I make peace. I create evil.
[42:01] God is using these things.
[42:04] If you're needing just a little bit of
[42:06] something to hold on to, what does God
[42:08] what brother Ram say about death? God
[42:09] puts bits in its mouth. Amen.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; He doesn't completely do away with it.
[42:14] He just uses it.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; There'll be a time when he does, but in
[42:19] the meantime, he uses it.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; In first John chapter 1 verse5, this
[42:25] then is the message which we have heard
[42:27] of him and declare unto you that God is
[42:29] light and in him is no darkness at all.
[42:33] So this darkness is not coming from the
[42:36] nature and character of God, but it is a
[42:38] contrast to God. He forms light. So
[42:40] there's the contrast of darkness. He
[42:42] makes peace and therefore he has created
[42:44] in essence evil.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; As this contrast, this law of contrast
[42:50] to God
[42:53] &gt;&gt; and when when God in whom there is no
[42:56] darkness at all, God who is light,
[42:59] when this evil is attained to in heaven,
[43:03] he cast it out because there can't be
[43:06] evil in heaven.
[43:09] says in Revelations 12:8, "And he
[43:11] prevailed not, neither was their place
[43:12] found anymore in heaven." This is evil
[43:14] being cast out of heaven. God purged
[43:16] heaven of evil. In Genesis 3:4, when
[43:20] evil and sin arose in the garden, he
[43:23] drove out the man and placed at the east
[43:25] of Eden uh cherubams and a flaming sword
[43:28] which turned every way to keep the way
[43:30] of the tree of life. When evil entered
[43:32] Eden, God ridded even Eden of the evil.
[43:37] Continue to read your Bible to chapter
[43:39] 4. It introduces dissonance. That evil
[43:42] that produces the restlessness, the
[43:43] longing, the anxiousness, the murder,
[43:45] and everything that follows.
[43:48] So that when we look at life from that
[43:50] moment on, Job writes in Job 14:1, "Man
[43:53] that is born of a woman is or it's
[43:54] written in Job, man that is born of a
[43:56] woman is of a few days and full of
[43:58] trouble, commotion, disturbance."
[44:00] &gt;&gt; This hasn't changed.
[44:03] man is of a few days and life is hard.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; So much so to where Solomon says in
[44:10] Ecclesiastes 21:17, "Therefore, I hated
[44:12] life."
[44:14] Some of you thought it was okay to get a
[44:15] tattoo. You'd probably put that on your
[44:17] ankle.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Therefore, I hated life. Some might this
[44:21] might be your favorite scripture because
[44:23] and it's this, think of it. Solomon, who
[44:25] could afford anything, who could resolve
[44:27] any issue, right? I could buy it. I can
[44:29] wise my way out of it. Whatever it was,
[44:31] he looked at everything. I have a number
[44:33] of scriptures I'm going to read and to
[44:34] share with you. But I thought, well,
[44:35] this pretty much sums it up. Therefore,
[44:36] I hated life because the work that is
[44:38] wrought under the sun is grievious unto
[44:40] me. Everything under the sun grieves
[44:41] him.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; All right, we like this, isn't it? Isn't
[44:43] this good?
[44:45] &gt;&gt; This is really good stuff here. I feel
[44:47] you. I feel you, preacher Solomon. Love
[44:49] you, man. For all is vanity and vexation
[44:52] of spirit.
[44:54] In the end, he's saying, I look at life
[44:56] and it's it's only evil continually.
[44:58] It's dissonant.
[45:00] And he and he's seek he's seeking
[45:02] resolution, right? He's saying, "Well, I
[45:04] do all this, but what's going to be
[45:05] after me? What's it going to land on?
[45:07] How's my how's my wealth going to be
[45:09] handled? Is there any rest from the
[45:10] labor?" And he says, "No, there's not."
[45:12] &gt;&gt; There's never a point where the tension
[45:14] is resolved.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; How don't we feel that way,
[45:18] &gt;&gt; right? We feel like, man, if I could
[45:19] just lose a few pounds, I'm I'm going to
[45:21] find that that that that really my
[45:22] groove. I'm going to feel good. I'm
[45:23] going be happy. I just need to take this
[45:25] pill. And listen, they don't have enough
[45:27] catam or whatever it is they sell at
[45:29] these gas stations in bottles to make
[45:31] your life nonvexing.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; It only compounds our misery.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; He says, "I hate life because
[45:41] everything's vanity and vexation.
[45:44] It's unsettling. It's restless. The
[45:47] patterns,
[45:49] the es and flows.
[45:51] Just when we think things are good,
[45:53] right? Finally, finally, you're
[45:55] completely debt and it's all paid off.
[45:58] And you get a certified letter from the
[45:59] IRS. Hey,
[46:02] &gt;&gt; this is how life works.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Come back to God. I'm going to serve
[46:07] God. Things things are going to go
[46:08] great. Your family falls apart.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Job 30 26. When I looked for good, then
[46:15] evil came unto me.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; And when I waited for light, there came
[46:18] darkness.
[46:20] We draw the principle from Job to say
[46:22] that those things that he feared came
[46:24] upon him. His expectation brought the
[46:27] evil, but now he's looking for good.
[46:29] He's hoping for good. He's wanting good,
[46:31] but yet still evil comes. When I waited
[46:34] for light, darkness came.
[46:38] This is life.
[46:40] This is what I began to ponder over the
[46:42] last few weeks on my vacation.
[46:46] I hate life. No, this is what I
[46:48] pondered. in a 100% humidity, sleeping
[46:51] in a barn with a million dead flies
[46:53] around me and the smell of goats and
[46:55] chickens.
[46:58] Begin to think about the allegory of
[46:59] life is just like a barn. No, I begin to
[47:02] think life is just full of vexations.
[47:05] And as much as we preach Christ is here
[47:09] and healing and salvation, and as much
[47:11] as we sing these hymns that are
[47:12] victorious, and as much as we believe
[47:15] that we're free from sin, we begin to
[47:17] look at our lives, realize, hey, it's
[47:18] far from perfect.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; We preach a gospel that husbands and
[47:23] wives are to marry for life and to raise
[47:25] their children to fear God and never do
[47:27] such a thing as that, that they might
[47:28] get married and we're going to
[47:29] experience grandchildren. We're all
[47:31] going to be one big happy family at
[47:32] Thanksgiving. And then we experience
[47:34] such devastation in life where that
[47:36] dream is shattered
[47:39] &gt;&gt; and try to make sense of that
[47:44] &gt;&gt; but dissonance
[47:47] in music
[47:50] within our western tradition I can say
[47:52] very solidly and I'm just using as a
[47:54] type not as the truth but as a type of
[47:55] the truth but dissonance has its
[47:58] resolution
[48:00] when it moves to a consonance. Brother
[48:02] Mike, I'm on the right track there.
[48:04] That's kind of a little bit Maddie, tell
[48:06] him to shake vigorously. Head up and
[48:08] down. Yeah, you're good. Yeah,
[48:10] that's when it when it when it there's
[48:13] this tone that then can resolve when it
[48:15] comes back to that that major
[48:18] like ah that sounds good.
[48:22] That's
[48:24] the rest.
[48:27] But when resolution is delayed,
[48:30] it creates suspense.
[48:32] This is what a composer will do on
[48:34] purpose. This is this is what's done in
[48:36] storytelling.
[48:38] It causes drama.
[48:40] The more that it's delayed, it creates
[48:41] this greater sense of expectation. It
[48:44] builds it builds. It's building and
[48:45] you're waiting to to hit that note where
[48:47] you know it's resolved.
[48:50] It flows out into this completion and
[48:51] this rest.
[48:53] And so dissonance if we want to say evil
[48:57] it reaches it's resolved when we find
[49:00] the rest.
[49:03] It's resolved when it when it comes to
[49:05] that when the expectation is satisfied.
[49:09] And I just want to use this very
[49:10] quickly. In Genesis 3:15 God promises a
[49:14] resolution to evil. And I will put
[49:16] enmity between thee and the woman and
[49:18] between thy seed and her seed. This
[49:20] seems like a lot of dissonance. This
[49:23] seems like a lot of compounding the
[49:24] sorrows. God saying, "I'm going to
[49:25] thrust you out into a world called the
[49:27] wilderness and and it's going to be very
[49:29] difficult. It's going to be very hard.
[49:30] But with there's going to be a
[49:32] resolution and her seed, it shall bruise
[49:35] thy head and thou shalt bruise his
[49:36] heel." This is the promise of
[49:37] redemption. I said God's promising a
[49:39] resolution.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; A resolution to the evil, the tension
[49:43] that has been brought up in this fall.
[49:45] We know according to the word of God,
[49:47] the Messiah would resolve the tension.
[49:50] He would bring this long awaited
[49:52] stability and rest because as we find
[49:54] mankind leaving the garden and then
[49:57] coming to uh the destruction of the
[49:59] earth through the flood, he leaves the
[50:00] ark and he falls into the same pattern
[50:02] and the entire Old Testament is the same
[50:04] pattern of tension building and man
[50:07] falling to his to evils and iniquity.
[50:09] But there's this promise that flows
[50:11] through. There's this kind of this chord
[50:13] that's playing in the background that
[50:15] keeps signaling where this needs to go.
[50:18] And it's this note that says the Messiah
[50:20] is going to come and that's going to
[50:22] resolve the tension.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; All the high places are going to be made
[50:27] low. All the things are going to be
[50:28] straightened out. All the good is going
[50:30] to be is going to be made manifest. This
[50:32] long awaited stability and rest. It says
[50:34] in Isaiah 25:9 and it said be shall be
[50:36] said in that day, lo, this is our God.
[50:39] We have waited for him.
[50:42] This is that anticipation, this
[50:44] expectation
[50:46] because life's created it.
[50:49] Though the man and woman in the garden
[50:51] had a promise that was oncoming, there
[50:53] wasn't tension
[50:54] in that.
[50:56] It was consonant. It's perfect.
[50:58] Everything was beautiful. But now after
[51:00] the fall, there's this the notes and the
[51:03] sounds create this tension.
[51:06] You notice how a lot of Hebrew songs
[51:08] have that longing in it, that almost a
[51:11] melancholy of a, oh, come. Oh, we're
[51:15] longing. It's pining. It builds this
[51:18] expectation. We have waited for him and
[51:19] he will save us. This is the Lord. We
[51:21] have waited for him. We'll be glad and
[51:22] rejoice in his salvation.
[51:25] That's why they looked for that rest,
[51:29] that reign of the Messiah that would
[51:30] bring them rest from strife,
[51:33] perfect peace and harmony in all the
[51:36] world. The Gentiles would come to his
[51:38] light.
[51:40] In Revelations 21:4, he says, "And God
[51:43] shall wipe away all tears from their
[51:45] eyes."
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:47] And there shall be no more death,
[51:51] neither sorrow, nor crying. Neither
[51:54] shall there be any more pain.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; And that's just not the pain we
[51:57] experience when we stub our toe. That's
[51:59] the pain of divorce.
[52:02] It's the pain of death. It's the pain of
[52:03] barrenness. It's the pain of loss. It's
[52:05] the pain of things that we so loved and
[52:07] desired that were ripped away from us.
[52:08] He said, "There'll be no more death, no
[52:10] sorrow, no crying, no more pain,
[52:13] &gt;&gt; for the former things are passed away.
[52:18] the former things, death, sorrow,
[52:21] crying, pain, they're passed away.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; In Romans chapter 8, verse 28, and we
[52:27] know that all things work together for
[52:28] good to them that love God, to them who
[52:30] are the called according to his purpose.
[52:33] In other words, the former things will
[52:34] have their resolution.
[52:37] The death, the sorrow, the crying, the
[52:41] pain,
[52:43] they're all moving to a resolution.
[52:47] This is what God says. Now, we we may
[52:49] not be able to figure it out, but if
[52:50] you're feeling that, if you experience
[52:52] it, then that dissonance, it tells us
[52:55] that according to God's word, that has
[52:57] to be resolved.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; That we can't we can't go to heaven with
[53:03] something eating at us.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; We're not going to go into heaven with
[53:07] this emptiness that somehow the devil
[53:09] got the best of us and this is this is a
[53:12] reward which is secondary to what I
[53:13] could have had on earth.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; And I really mean this. I don't know how
[53:19] much I might try to express this in
[53:21] future services, but to now say that
[53:23] it's good. All things work together for
[53:26] good. This is not just a semantic shift.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Where what at one time was uh evil, but
[53:33] now we're just going to say, "Oh, well,
[53:36] that's good."
[53:38] &gt;&gt; That's what's not being implied here,
[53:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:41] It's not that what we once thought was
[53:43] evil
[53:45] is now actually good
[53:49] &gt;&gt; and now we could say tell you what got
[53:52] to love death. Isn't it awesome? Yeah.
[53:56] Baress. All right.
[53:59] That's that's not the that's not the
[54:01] attitude.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; It's a re it's the reality. These things
[54:04] are evil. These things are hard. These
[54:06] things are very difficult. They're
[54:07] lifealtering and shattering. How do we
[54:09] resolve it as a daughter of God or a son
[54:11] of God?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; How do we make sense of it? But God
[54:13] said, "I'll resolve it.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; I know it causes tension. I know it
[54:18] causes instability. I know it causes
[54:20] pain. And there's things that continue
[54:22] to unravel, but I will change. I'm not
[54:25] going to have you look at it and say,
[54:26] "Well, that was nice and that was good."
[54:28] But I promise to resolve the evil.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; God promises it to do promises to do so.
[54:35] to be there for there be a resolution to
[54:37] hurting,
[54:38] &gt;&gt; a resolution to the pain, the things we
[54:40] read here in Revelations 21, the crying,
[54:42] the sorrow, he will resolve it, the
[54:46] lacking, the emptiness.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 29 10 and 11.
[54:55] When when I say the phrase resolving
[54:57] evil,
[54:59] I can't redefine it,
[55:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:02] &gt;&gt; We we can't do that. Do you realize that
[55:05] even when we say it was the tender hand
[55:06] of Jehovah, it's not meant to change the
[55:08] fact that it was horrific,
[55:10] &gt;&gt; that it was hard,
[55:12] &gt;&gt; it was evil.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, say, "Oh,
[55:16] well, that was just the tender hand of
[55:17] Jehovah." Yeah, just pleasing, right? So
[55:20] wonderful, so harmonious. It's evil.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; It's horrible. If if we begin to
[55:26] redefine evil, we become Holocaust
[55:28] deniers.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Well, it wasn't really bad after all.
[55:31] No, it's horrific.
[55:35] And the question is, why does God allow
[55:37] these things to happen? When I believed,
[55:39] when I prayed, when I did all I could,
[55:43] Job, who was upright,
[55:46] realizes, yes, perhaps his fears brought
[55:48] it upon him. But now, when he looks for
[55:50] good, he gets evil. When he looks for
[55:51] light, he gets darkness.
[55:54] It's the tension. It's the dissonance of
[55:56] life.
[55:57] But he made a promise. In Jeremiah 29:es
[56:01] 10 and 11, it says, "For thus sayith the
[56:03] Lord, Israel is in bondage as a result
[56:05] of their own decisions. They're going to
[56:07] be in bondage to this Calaldian Empire
[56:10] after 70 years be accomplished at
[56:12] Babylon. I will visit you and perform my
[56:15] good word toward you in causing you to
[56:18] return to this place,
[56:22] this place of peace, shalom, Jerusalem,
[56:24] this place of rest.
[56:26] You you've you've been removed from it.
[56:28] you've gone off into this that the tone
[56:30] changed,
[56:31] but I'll bring you back to this place.
[56:34] Says, "For I know the thoughts that I
[56:36] think towards you, sayeth the Lord,
[56:38] &gt;&gt; thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[56:41] give you an expected end."
[56:45] &gt;&gt; So God's thoughts towards them were
[56:47] peace, but they didn't have peace where
[56:49] they were. They were slaves. They were
[56:53] in bondage. They suffered death. They
[56:54] suffered loss of possession, completely
[56:56] upheaval of their identity, being
[56:58] brainwashed and forced to become calans
[57:00] in a Babylonian empire. Kind of hard.
[57:02] It's make the best of your situation.
[57:05] This is not a good situation. And so God
[57:08] is saying, look, he acknowledges the
[57:10] bondage and the evil, but he's saying my
[57:12] thoughts are peace towards you and in
[57:16] the presence of your evil, I want you to
[57:18] know that I will bring you to an
[57:20] expected end. That means anticipated and
[57:24] hoped for in I will resolve the longing
[57:28] in your heart to be made whole.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; So he actually tells them in verse 7,
[57:33] "And seek the peace of the city whether
[57:35] I've caused you to be carried away
[57:37] captives."
[57:38] He caused them to be carried away. God
[57:41] caused them to go into bondage. So he
[57:42] says, "Pray for the peace of the city
[57:44] that you're in because the peace of that
[57:46] city will be your peace."
[57:49] Notice what he's telling them. Yeah.
[57:50] It's you're things are going to be
[57:51] difficult.
[57:53] Economics may fail. You better pray for
[57:56] the pray for the economics. Pray for
[57:57] this. Pray for that. But because those
[58:00] situations are going to affect you. But
[58:02] in me, in me, I've made you a promise. I
[58:06] will resolve
[58:12] &gt;&gt; to give you
[58:14] the end that you're anticipating
[58:16] &gt;&gt; the moment when it start when it makes
[58:18] sense.
[58:19] Not that it can make sense of the evil,
[58:22] but when it resolves,
[58:25] when you find your restmen.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; In this sermon, hearing, recognizing,
[58:30] acting on the word of God. Musicians, if
[58:31] you could come to your places, he says,
[58:34] brother Bram says, "God cannot change
[58:36] his program
[58:38] because he makes his program perfect
[58:41] because it's part of him.
[58:46] God's got a program. we just need to get
[58:47] right in it. And so we say, "Yep, if I
[58:50] could just get in that program, we just
[58:51] need to get in a groove." And once you
[58:52] get in the groove, you're like, "Wait,
[58:54] am I in a rut?"
[58:56] Hard to tell the difference sometimes.
[58:58] Can't tell if I'm in a groove or a rut.
[59:00] And it says, "Now in the Garden of Eden
[59:02] was so beautiful until it attracted Eve
[59:04] from righteousness to sin."
[59:08] And this is just the paradox of it. And
[59:10] in the same garden where there was a
[59:11] tree of life, there was also a tree of
[59:13] death.
[59:15] We would know it today as the law of
[59:17] contrast.
[59:20] That where there is good, there is evil.
[59:23] Where there is right, there's wrong.
[59:26] And we will never,
[59:28] no matter what our environment may be,
[59:30] ever be able to shake ourselves from the
[59:33] presence of either.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[59:38] never,
[59:40] no matter what environment we may be in,
[59:43] we'll never be able to shake ourselves
[59:45] from the presence of either. Think of
[59:48] all the cults that thought if they could
[59:49] just go far off in far enough off into
[59:51] the wilderness, they could create a a
[59:53] place of perfection,
[59:55] a new Jerusalem as it were, a new
[59:57] Bethlehem,
[59:59] and try to create a place where we're
[1:00:00] all going to live in harmony away from
[1:00:01] the evils of this world and what's
[1:00:04] committed behind those walls. some of
[1:00:06] the most horrific evils.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; No matter what kind of environment you
[1:00:10] may be in, you'll never be able to shake
[1:00:12] yourselves from the presence of either.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; We live with it.
[1:00:19] But if music holds a type for us,
[1:00:23] if God is in music,
[1:00:26] do you realize it's the it's the
[1:00:28] tension,
[1:00:31] it's the dissonance
[1:00:33] that brings the greatest beauty out of
[1:00:37] the peace.
[1:00:40] How well would we know God had there
[1:00:41] never been dissonance?
[1:00:44] I it may seem like maybe, you know,
[1:00:45] philosophical or backwards argument. I
[1:00:47] don't know how you might want to look at
[1:00:48] it, but how well would we know God?
[1:00:51] How would have God been known in the
[1:00:53] beginning had he not allowed it to
[1:00:55] unfold the way that it did?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; And you say, "I know your sorrow. I know
[1:00:59] your pain." He constantly affirms, "I
[1:01:01] know this isn't easy. I know this way is
[1:01:03] too hard for you." God throughout the
[1:01:04] scripture over and over again says, "I
[1:01:06] know. I know. I know." He affirms, but
[1:01:09] he never leaves us in it. And what he
[1:01:12] never does say to us is, "Well, you know
[1:01:14] what? You know that that murder or you
[1:01:16] know this loss, you know this, you know
[1:01:17] that that's actually good and that's
[1:01:20] good." But he says, "No, ultimately
[1:01:23] it'll be used as power for good."
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; He says, "All things work together for
[1:01:28] good." the work together. It's it it has
[1:01:32] a power to good. God will use it. The
[1:01:36] pain
[1:01:39] I there there's a lot that I have in my
[1:01:41] heart that I was prepared to minister
[1:01:43] from and on. I'm not necessarily trying
[1:01:45] to hold this off. If this is the this is
[1:01:47] the only sermon I speak on this,
[1:01:50] then
[1:01:52] then I I I I could be satisfied. So,
[1:01:55] I'll say this.
[1:01:58] The the the bad things that take place
[1:02:00] in our lives are always going to be bad
[1:02:03] things.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Yet, we're not just going to change the
[1:02:06] label and start calling bad good.
[1:02:10] But the resolution is to know God will
[1:02:14] bring beauty
[1:02:16] by resolving it
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; by it's finding its place
[1:02:22] by bringing it back to that place of
[1:02:24] stability
[1:02:26] that you can look back and in those
[1:02:28] anxious times and those ter terrible
[1:02:30] times and the the gut-wrenching moments
[1:02:32] and the the ups and downs and whether it
[1:02:34] be medications and consultations and
[1:02:36] therapy sessions, whatever it is we have
[1:02:38] to go through that at one point you'll
[1:02:40] be the kind that place where it's
[1:02:41] resolved. God resolved it. There's still
[1:02:44] evil, but God resolves it.
[1:02:48] And so when we look at a word and we see
[1:02:50] perfection, perfection, perfection,
[1:02:51] amidst the mark of sin, perfection,
[1:02:53] perfection, a strong marriages,
[1:02:54] beautiful families, raising
[1:02:56] grandchildren, and all these legacies we
[1:02:57] want to have, and all these things we
[1:02:59] want to attain to, I want the per
[1:03:01] there's a perfect body out there that
[1:03:02] one day you're going to step into, and
[1:03:03] this one is breaking down. and it's
[1:03:05] riddled with disease and and there's
[1:03:06] going to be oh the love of God in this
[1:03:08] last age and perfect love for one
[1:03:10] another and there's hatred and
[1:03:11] bitterness and strife and there's
[1:03:12] separation and oh the promise of God to
[1:03:14] to be fruitful and you can't have
[1:03:16] children all these things that happen in
[1:03:17] our lives and it just seems to be so
[1:03:19] chaotic and so frenzied
[1:03:22] they're they're bad
[1:03:26] can't you can't say oh you just need to
[1:03:28] suck it up and get over it they hurt
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; it's pain sorrow causes us to cry it's
[1:03:35] But when brother Brandham preaches the
[1:03:37] masterpiece and he tells the story of
[1:03:40] the carving Michelangelo this doing the
[1:03:43] statue of Moses when it was perfect. It
[1:03:47] was beautiful, wasn't it?
[1:03:50] But then when you look at it and you see
[1:03:54] you see that it actually has a flaw
[1:03:58] and you realize, "Oh, what a bummer.
[1:04:00] It's not perfect anymore.
[1:04:03] has a flaw
[1:04:05] and we just reject it, discard it.
[1:04:08] Something happened to it, got moved
[1:04:11] around, it got put here, this happened
[1:04:12] and and it's been defaced. It devalued
[1:04:15] it. And then it's one of these things
[1:04:18] where you think, well,
[1:04:21] that that that was such an a beautiful
[1:04:23] piece and now all of a sudden it's been
[1:04:26] marred.
[1:04:27] And then if we could maybe use it in
[1:04:29] this terminology, Paul Harvey gives the
[1:04:31] rest of the story and brother Brandham
[1:04:33] then gives us context for the flaw
[1:04:37] and you realize, oh wow, that's what
[1:04:40] makes it a masterpiece
[1:04:42] is the flaw
[1:04:44] that in the moment when it looked
[1:04:45] perfect and Moses was so inspired that
[1:04:47] he smoteed it and said speak or when
[1:04:49] Michael Lynch was so inspired he he
[1:04:51] smoked it and said speak and that caused
[1:04:53] a chip. Then you realize that the the
[1:04:55] context to the flaw is what makes it a
[1:04:59] masterpiece. And what we lack sometimes
[1:05:01] in our lives when we're suffering, when
[1:05:03] we've been anguished, when we've been
[1:05:04] hurt, when our lives have been torn
[1:05:05] apart, we can't see the context. There's
[1:05:07] too much crying, there's too much pain,
[1:05:09] there's too much suffering. But I
[1:05:10] promise you that if God has allowed it,
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; if God has allowed it, he can bring the
[1:05:16] context. And though we may not feel like
[1:05:18] we know what it can be, and maybe we can
[1:05:20] never begin to rationalize how it'll
[1:05:22] feel, but I promise you, God is even now
[1:05:26] resolving evil.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; And he's mindful. If I could say what
[1:05:32] God impressed upon me as I prayed and
[1:05:33] sought the mind of Lord, God is mindful
[1:05:35] of all the situations that aren't p
[1:05:37] picture perfect
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; and aren't the way that we envision them
[1:05:41] to be, not the way that we want them to
[1:05:42] be. And God knows even the things you've
[1:05:44] experienced, the things you've gone
[1:05:45] through. Brother Frank, I was thinking
[1:05:47] of you this morning. The starting, the
[1:05:50] stopping,
[1:05:51] those aren't those aren't fun things to
[1:05:54] do, but God will use every bit of it.
[1:05:58] Nothing lost. He knows how to use all
[1:05:59] the material. That's right.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; And he'll resolve it. He'll give you
[1:06:02] that rest. And then what we'll find out
[1:06:05] is all along we, man, does God know how
[1:06:08] to write a masterpiece or what?
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Ain't he good?
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Doesn't he work all things together for
[1:06:14] good?
[1:06:16] Such a wonderful God. Let's stand to our
[1:06:18] feet.
[1:06:19] Let's just be prayerful now as we bow
[1:06:21] our heads.
[1:06:25] I know that he knows what you're going
[1:06:27] through.
[1:06:30] I know that that's how he dealt with my
[1:06:31] heart. Is that the hurt
[1:06:35] and the pain that we feel? They're
[1:06:37] sometimes exasperated. The more that we
[1:06:39] begin to preach the word of God, it
[1:06:41] feels even more overwhelming because the
[1:06:44] contrasts.
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:54] I trust that God will
[1:06:57] give you strength today for this. If we
[1:06:59] bow our heads, if you need prayer today,
[1:07:00] just ask the Lord for help.
[1:07:04] If it's healing that you need, I know
[1:07:07] that he'll give you that healing.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; If it's rest that you need, I know that
[1:07:13] he'll give you that rest.
[1:07:15] [Music]
[1:07:21] In the meantime, I think there's more
[1:07:23] that I had initially prepared to speak
[1:07:26] on how he says you're there in bondage
[1:07:27] and one day I'm going to cause you to
[1:07:30] return to this place of rest because
[1:07:34] my thoughts for you are not evil.
[1:07:38] The evil creates the tension that longs
[1:07:41] to be resolved.
[1:07:43] The loss creates anxiety that's hungry
[1:07:47] to be filled, to be satisfied, to be
[1:07:49] relieved. And God's saying, "I'll give
[1:07:52] you that. I'll give it to you." And I
[1:07:56] believe God could give it to you today.
[1:07:58] No, it's not that moment in Revelations
[1:08:00] 21:14 where he wipes all tears from our
[1:08:02] eyes and everything is perfect forever
[1:08:03] more. But there may be some pain that
[1:08:05] has been so overwhelming that's been
[1:08:08] needling you to just quit, to give up,
[1:08:10] or just to accept that all has been lost
[1:08:12] that it can't be that perfect beautiful
[1:08:13] message you desired to have. Whatever it
[1:08:16] might be, you can right now God can say,
[1:08:18] "All the pain, all the tension, all the
[1:08:20] sorrow, I can resolve it."
[1:08:23] And let's let him use it because he
[1:08:24] says, "I'll work all things together for
[1:08:26] agreement, for harmony."
[1:08:28] Our gracious heavenly father, I find it
[1:08:31] very difficult to stop today because I
[1:08:33] sense
[1:08:36] the wrestling with dissonance.
[1:08:41] Lord, I sense that there are those who
[1:08:44] have been experiencing great hurt that
[1:08:46] there is and that's not discernment,
[1:08:49] Lord. That's just using common sense.
[1:08:53] And Lord, my desire is
[1:08:56] that to the fatherless you could be a
[1:08:58] father.
[1:09:00] To the widow you could be a husband.
[1:09:04] Lord, to those
[1:09:07] who had great plans and great desires,
[1:09:09] who have this emptiness
[1:09:13] and this longing.
[1:09:17] We come to you, Lord, and we cast our
[1:09:19] cares upon you.
[1:09:22] We're honest, Lord. I pine. I long. I'm
[1:09:26] anxious.
[1:09:29] Heart can't find rest.
[1:09:31] Lord, give us the assurance that it will
[1:09:34] resolve.
[1:09:38] And may we keep our trust in you, Lord.
[1:09:42] We love you. Commit ourselves to you
[1:09:44] today, Lord.
[1:09:47] Heal hurting hearts.
[1:09:52] In this moment, make your presence known
[1:09:54] to us. I pray in the name of the Lord
[1:09:55] Jesus Christ. Amen.
