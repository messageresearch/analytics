TRANSCRIPT
========================================
title this evening is Love's great mystery there's been a lot of things that I've been looking at in this subject matter on uh on the subject of perfect love that's related to The Mystery of Love or The Secret Of Love and as we referenced on Sunday in a few different places when brother Brown's talking about all the mysteries of God being finished even as we were looking at the sermon marriage and divorce and now that the seals are open the spirit of Truth directs us to the word and brother Branham pointed to Revelations chapter 10 we know that according to Revelations chapter 10 verse 7 it promises that the mystery of God should be finished and he says as it has been declared to his servants the prophet so that mystery that's finished in this hour is something that has been declared to the prophets and the Mystery of God we know has something to do with the secret of God's heart as brother Branham looks at that in Christ as the mystery of God revealed he says it's all in the last days when this great mystery that God had in his heart is being revealed so we're in the last days when something that was in in God's heart is being revealed and I believe all these Mysteries that God just doesn't have like this subsection or the spin-off over here where he's just doing some sort of a new series based upon something else that's already been and the Mysteries is kind of a one-off for people who like deep things but it's all related to his heart purpose and what he's trying to achieve and accomplish and so as we look at Revelations chapter 10 verse 1 we know that the mighty Angel which comes down is Christ is clothed with the cloud this Mighty angel with a rainbow upon his head that rainbow is signifying a covenant and when we look at Jesus Christ being the seed of Genesis 3 15 we can make that connection that he is the seed that could would have come by the original Covenant that they would have eventually brother man says brought forth that child then under the original Covenant it was envisioned that there would be a family that there would be that there would be more seeds that would come forth and Christ is that Seed of Abraham he is the one seed that is the the seed of the woman of Genesis 3 15 prophecy that is a Redemption so when this mystery is revealed we're saying on Sunday that the original Covenant is restored and under that original Covenant is full Redemption and I'll say this now kind of as a sneak peek for those of you who are here on a Wednesday night and for those that are streaming if you could just cut the stream for a moment and we'll just save that for the people who are here okay never mind they they say we just don't know when you're being serious or when you're joking I mean you mean like the whole time like from the moment the whole time I'm preaching but uh I've been studying for some time now and hoping to start very soon on a series on the kingdom and On Heaven's mystery and Earth's glory and so maybe this will serve as a link between perfect love and the kingdom because I'm just in looking at it and there's a way that when you preach the word of God that you can make it all well part of the same thing because it's all Jesus Christ it's all one con there's continuity amongst the things of God and the principles of God I'm hoping just to link these things together uh perfect love in the kingdom and as this might be the last service on perfect love as far as the series is concerned I wanted to read this statement because it's been one that I've read almost before every service and with that in mind just continue to remember that I'm wanting to link back to some of those things we talked about on Sunday on the mystery of God and that original Covenant he says today you know the love is so hard to find well the Bible said there'd come a time when there wouldn't be love for one another the father would be against mother and mother against father and children against parents and so forth and the only love would be left would be just between the elect and that's about right love is a scarce thing today so he's saying that come a time when the only love that will be will be among the elect I believe those days are upon us when it comes to genuine love or if you want to find what is real agape love you're only going to find it among the elect he says look at the divorce courts between husband and wife look at juvenile delinquency look at the home breaks and everything No Love No Love now the only time that you even know your neighbor's dead is when you read in the paper and we don't get that anymore so we don't even know our neighbors died until the moving truck is there and we we ask we start asking around he said that's about right we don't know about one another no more No Love No More he says No Love No Love he said this is this is kind of where we're at and I think there's a lot that we could say to amplify that but I make the point that love the love that's going to be found is among the elect and there's a reason for that now if you'll just look at Hosea chapter 1 with me and I if this seems a little bit disjointed then I never I never claimed to be a Mason I'm just kind of throwing the bricks out there you're going to have to put them together and get and fill it all in with some water but and Hosea chapter 1 I'll just summarize it instead of reading it but we know that we see that God asked Hosea to take a one a woman of many whoredoms and he says make her your wife and that's a striking commandment uh how it says you know to take a woman of whoredoms and and make her your wife I've had some men sometimes tell me that the reason why they did something that's against God's word they said you know they said well I did this because God told me to do it and and they're trying to make an excuse for why they did something and I say well God told the prophet to eat feces and and to marry a woman of many whoredoms and that doesn't mean you need to run out and do it or doesn't mean it makes it right and it was just sometimes just pushing back a little bit sometimes when they try to change the word of God just based upon what the Lord told them when it doesn't fit with the word but this is a striking statement to go take a woman uh who is Unfaithful who is unclean and make her a wife and her name is Gomer and as we read in Hosea 11 she Bears children and the names that are given to the children are showing judgment against Israel Mercy to Judah and with each child with the children that are born God is wanting to use them to prophesy and use them to express something of his attitude towards Israel his attitude towards Judah and ultimately uh of redemption as verse 9 says he's going to say you are not my people and I am not your God that's a striking statement that those that claim to be the children of God or the uh The Chosen Nation the chosen people and those that worship the one true God is going to say you're not my people and I am not your God but as we read verses 10 and verse 11 it speaks of redemption through the Messiah and how that there's going to be they're going to come together and not just be a people but notice how deep this prophecy is that ye are the sons of the Living God and it's remarkable that when Christ comes claiming to be the Son of God and they took such umbrage with it now you claiming to be the Son of God make yourself equal with God but the prophets have already declared that there would be a time when they would even be called the Sons of the Living God and so there's uh if I could say this just to summarize though Israel was unfaithful when God tells Hosea to go take a woman of many whoredoms he's trying to show that even though Israel committed spiritual adultery and had profaned him and Fallen away from him that God would restore and that God would make whole in doing that it's showing it's showing a prophecy to Israel that this is what God wants to do for Israel this is his long-suffering with Israel this is his patience to Israel but I want us to draw from that more than just something that would relate to Israel but recognize that Israel is a type of the church I I one series that I definitely recommend to that everyone should listen to is when brother Brandon preaches Israel in the church and now I'm kind of forgetting 5253 where it's at there in the early 50s when he ministers it but he's come on off the field as having preached around the world and preaching meetings everywhere and he's coming back and he's kind of coming back the way I read it and the way it always strikes me is he's able to give a report about the condition of the church and he starts drawing this great parallel between Israel and the church and we begin to see and we know very clearly from the message that there's things that relate to Israel in the natural that relate to the Gentile bride and the spiritual there's things that would be fulfilled to Israel but then there's also a type to be fulfilled for the church so though God is prophesying uh to Israel and he's taking Hosea to marry a woman to represent and signify something to Israel will find that there's a truth that applies to the church and when I use the phrase Love's great mystery God now I'm going to be drawing from just a few parts ago God's original heart purpose we know is to have a bride of his own choosing that's at his heart and so when God created the Earth his plan was to bring a bride from it we understand that I know I'm maybe going fast through principles tonight but it's uh I just I think that there's nothing really deep here these are things I think you can just grab a hold of and take a hold of very easily so God's original heart purpose is to have a bride of his choosing so when God created the Earth he planned to bring a bride from it that that's already there it's already in the plan he creates everything he says I'm going to bring a bride out of this now when he brings when he creates Adam that's not the Fulfillment of his heart purpose when he takes E from Adam that's not the Fulfillment of his heart purpose when he banishes them from the garden and gives them a new covenant they begin to bring forth seed that's not his heart purpose God had hid his heart purpose in the beginning and didn't let it out initially but he's foreshadowing it from the very very beginning as as we believed that in the beginning he created the Heaven and the Earth and he already foreshadowed it then a Heavenly bridegroom and an Earthly bride that that's what he wanted to do so we see in Adam though what God was wanting to create God creates Adam then brings a wife from Adam that's in it that's symbolic of his purpose then we see this spiritually in Christ we know that Christ uh Christ's body is the bride and we can take so many statements and so many scriptures to show that the bride of Christ comes out of Christ and so just as the woman was hidden in Adam the bride was hidden in Christ and so now when the bride comes forth I could just say this she was the hidden mystery of Christ and one thing that I guess it's just a phrase I like to use if Christ is the mystery of God revealed then this bride will be the mystery of Christ God finished so this as we look in Matthew Chapter 13 we'll start with verse 44 and kind of uh maybe just go through this fairly quickly Jesus giving this parable of the Kingdom of Heaven you can see how this would tie into a study on the kingdom he says again the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto treasure hidden a Feeling and this treasure hid it means it's a secret treasure treasure coming from something to be placed or fixed so this hidden treasure something very special it's something placed or fixed there so you're using a parable so we know that the parable in some ways is cryptic but yet it's given unto us to know the mysteries of the kingdom it says the Kingdom of Heaven is likened to treasure hid in the field the which when a man hath found he hideth and so that found there uh it it has it's connected with with the placing and the fixing when he had found he hideth and for the joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field now though we could use this scripture to challenge us as the hungry and as The Sinner that whenever we have seen the truth and we hear of Jesus Christ that we're willing to sell everything we have and give our hearts totally and completely to Christ and and cleave to him and it could be used in a way to challenge us that if you hear the truth abandon yourself to it and sell out for it and it's worth everything but when we read these Parables these in particular these Parables Express God's love in a mystery amen because when we read this and we know that the bride she was the treasure in God's heart and the Bible says that we would be found in him and that we're hidden in him and that we are before him and there's a lot of language that Paul uses in the in his letters to show that we were that we would be found in him that were hidden in Christ and so we could take all that together to show that you are the treasure and and that in as we read this the treasure hid in the field speaks of those who are the elect that God has hid in the earth that God has sown into the Earth and it's he that we could see in Christ gives all in order to buy the field for the treasure and it is so I say in its perfect fulfillment the bride is that treasure that's hidden in the earth and this Parable is about Redemption it's about the price being paid to redeem the treasure that's hidden the field because let's just be honest if we Christ was that treasure we couldn't sell enough to afford it there's just no way that we could pay the price for it but we are the treasure hid in the field that was hidden and for the joy which was set before him Christ endured and paid the price and sold all in order to pay the price of redemption to redeem the treasure from that field it says again the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls not just pearls but goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price many women have done virtuously but thou excellus them all there's one one pearl of great price one one body which is his own that he desires to redeem went and sold all that he had and bought it again it's reflective of the Queen of Heaven the Bride of Jesus Christ the ones for whom God has chosen before the foundation of the world and sent his son to shed his blood for she's represented in this parable now I have a I have a Target in mind tonight and with how I think with the way I'm typically natured when I approach a subject uh to this point this would maybe be part 46 with just what I've already gone through tonight so I feel like I'm doing awesome tonight by having not God gotten bogged down with just one verse so I hope but I hope that there's some things that have been kind of put in here and I'm not saying that to brag I'm saying that's the weakness pray for me uh that if we could look at it now to say that God's purpose of the Earth was to get a bride out of it we see it typed in Adam we see it uh Christ we see this also in Christ and that this Parable the parable that he's using that Christ is giving us we can see that reflective in that yes the Earth must be pregnant it must hold promise of a bride because God created it for that purpose and so he's going to get a bride out of the earth he's going to get a bride out of the church we see what God's wanting to accomplish this is his aim uh God created the Earth for purpose brother Brown says Satan defiled it uh he says that that's the heart purpose of God to have a bride of his choosing the Earth's purpose then is and you say well there's so much more reasons to it it would have never been here had God not wanted a bride he wasn't just looking for a Sandbox to play around he's not a coder or a developer and he's over here and just kind of creates this thing and let's see how this can run and let's see what happens over here he he has the intent of having a bride and so the sole purpose of the earth then and and as time unfolds this masterpiece that is unfolding Through Time it was so that God's attributes could be expressed to a bride because that that's who God wants to make himself known to because when he chooses that bride she wants to choose him she wants to fall in love with him so the purpose of the Earth in time is God is going to express his attributes for the sole purpose of those attributes drawn a bride to himself and and uh if I you know you make me need to be careful just using this type but you see in nature how that brother Ram talks about how in nature the male is the one that is beautiful and and the variations within nature uh if you see how God has made the male and he uses that beauty and he uses that nature in order to draw a mate and you'll see that many different species in many different ways where they're using their color they're using sounds and they're posturing themselves and using these characteristics and attributes in order to draw and attract someone uh to be their mate and you say well that's that we see that in nature and and in some way that's exactly showing what God was wanting to do throughout time is Express his nature in order to draw you to himself that's his desire so he's using expressed attributes in order to bring forth the bride now in Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 says behold I God will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children we see again we see now in scripture how that even the spirit of Elijah turning the heart of the fathers to the children is fulfilled it has fulfillment in John the Baptist and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse now we know that it is the ministry of Elijah that introduces the Christ which brings forth the bride and I don't believe that we need to labor on that this evening and we know that it is the Turning of the hearts is something that brother Branham uses in different ways to talk about restored to the faith uh and there's a lot the heart is an altar there's a lot that's expressed in that in that imagery but and the Turning of the faith our faith is going to go from Faith to perfect faith and without faith you can't have uh faith without having Love And so there's this turning of the heart of full affection full attention full adoration full uh full dedication to Christ because the purpose of Christ now is he wants to have preeminence in his church and so this ministry of Elijah then he comes as that Keystone he comes in there blending between two dispensations and he introduces Jesus Christ to the church and Jesus Christ then introduces or restores that Faith back why because it's the revealed word your mate and so that's why brother says he's a son of man revealing the son of man and he speaks often that by laying a foundation for one that's to come and you see that he always had the sense and he told us very plainly I'm not Christ I'm not the Messiah don't worship me and you make me out to be the Christ I I'd rather face God as a quitter than to be an antichrist so he knew his ministry was introducing something greater to come and it was it is that Mighty Angel it is Christ and so Christ then is it's through him that were that we were United it's through the revelation of Jesus Christ that you you that is uniting the bride now and I'm I'm drawing from so much that I think maybe for it's perfect for a Wednesday night crowd who's like I've heard that I've heard that I've heard that I've heard that and so everything's just kind of lining up here hopefully for you now if you'll just notice if you've turned in your Bibles to Malachi 4 and you're in verse 6. and if you're looking in your Bibles it's even more striking that the very last word of the Old Testament what is it curse perfect ending to the Old Testament curse and so as it ends with the word curse who is it that is under in suspense as it were of the curse that may come it ends with the Specter of the Earth being condemned cursed lay desolate wasted and he says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet who's going to turn the hearts of the children to the father fathers and that's a mouthful we know there's a lot that's in that and I've tried just to throw a bunch of little things out there just so we can start thinking that this is this is a very significant thing and not a small thing but I was wanting to speed up to this part that he says all that to say lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse if we could read it this way if I don't send Elijah I'm going to curse the Earth if Elijah doesn't come the Earth is cursed if Elijah doesn't come the Earth is going to be wasted it's going to be desolate and so with this thought that the Earth is going to be cursed and that somehow the Earth curse is only going to be lifted through this ministry of Elijah avoided through the Elijah Ministry turn with me to Mark chapter 11. I think maybe I know why I was nervous as it just seemed feels like such a different way of ministering for me or at least as of late and how I like to approach a subject I'm but I'm very very moved by this so in Mark chapter 11 verses 12 to 14 I'll then we'll skip to verse 20 to kind of see the follow-up it says and on the morrow when they were come from Bethany Christ he was hungry so he has a need pay attention to this and seeing a fig tree far off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything thereon so if you could imagine this now the word of God is given by inspiration and and it's profitable so God is Not and one thing that we've we've tried to instill or at least refresh to your mind over and over again is we should never just look at something in the word of God just by chance just by Feeler and God's writing a bunch of things so just bear with me I just got to get all this out and there's no fluff I remember one time my brother asked me to speak at a particular function he just needed 20 minutes and he said I just need 20 minutes at this particular juncture he said so just take a sermon get all the fluff out and give us 20 minutes and I thought huh it tells me something about how you prepare sermons because like I didn't know you could put fluff in sermons are we allowed to do that because I don't do that and so I was like well I mean I guess I'm just going to have to find a 20-minute sermon because I don't have fluff and I probably should have said and you might want to revisit this whole idea of fluffing your sermons but anyways it was when God writes something there's no fluff in it in other words we could look at it and say there's something in this he wants to succeed and there's something he's wanting to convey so the fact that Christ was hungry means something to me the fact that he was had some sort of anticipation that he would find figs so you see I'm hungry he sees a tree he sees some leaves and he comes and he says that maybe I could find he says and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves and in the most striking of the statement is for the time of figs was not yet so he saw a tree a fig tree it should bear figs he's hungry he wants figs he sees it without figs and guess what he does verse 14 and Jesus answered and said to him no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter forever and his disciples heard it and so here's he's hungry as as some of you might try to conclude based upon his reaction of the tree he was hangry and it comes up to the tree and he reaches for figs no figs let no man ever eat of you and we might think he was just just had a temper fit but God is wanting to express something to us so in verse 20 and in the morning as they passed by and so we could see kind of how these uh the chronology of this they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots now this was fast and Peter calling to remember it saith and master you know he's surprised Master you won't believe it exactly what you said come to pass Master behold the fig tree without curses is withered away and Jesus answering saith in him have faith in God now we know that the next statement is to he says have faith in God and what he says next certainly Supple you know amplifies that and says if you speak and this is how powerful faith is and this is What Faith Can Do but I believe that there there is more expressed in that instead of Jesus just giving a lesson on faith he's showing that there's something about faith in what he just did not just in the power to curse the tree but in what he's looking for and this is what his complaint about the disciples oh you have little faith and and there's something he's wanting to see there's something he's wanting to cultivate there's something he's wanting to bring out and so Jesus is hungry and if I could say it again God did this to express the truth Jesus is not just you know trying to we're not he's not just trying to connect with us oh he looks like he's impatient this isn't impatience this isn't just being petty he's wanting to convey something to us as I was studying this I found different places brother man talked about it and and the sermon I've heard but now I see he says he used his power and put a curse on a tree it began to wither he says when there was people laying everywhere needing that healing power and so I read I read that statement to you because as I was reading all these different statements brother Branham uses this to say that this shows that God is concerned and that God here he is he uses his power to curse a tree and didn't use his power to heal people and he said he's wanting to show us something and so God is wanting to show us something when he's when Christ is hungry goes to this tree to receive fruit and so if I can say Jesus is hungry he needed fruit so the tree when he goes to the tree and he wants to see fruit it had not served its purpose to feed him in Genesis chapter 1 verse 29 it says and God said behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the Earth he says and every tree in the witch is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat this to me is one of the most important scriptures in understanding the original sin God was not trying to trick the man and the woman if it grew from the ground it was good for food and he had given them every tree in the which is the fruit of the tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat so this tree was it was original purpose was to bring if we're going back to the original purpose Genesis 1 29 its purpose was to bring forth fruit that it might be meat to the eater and so God is telling Adam or this instruction to Adam I have given you these fruit-bearing trees and that you have a right to expect fruit and you ought to see that there would be fruit there and you can partake in it so now the second Adam I mean this is this is simple tonight right I mean if you want me to try to go deeper I can try harder this is just very simple and I trust that you're with me uh this Farm and so when Christ the second Adam is coming to the fig tree and he's hungry here we could say even in the semblance of Adam in the Garden of Eden he would have come to the tree expecting fruit now the second Adam is hungry he comes to the tree looking for fruit and since it's not there the curse was a consequence for not yielding what it should have yielded and so Jesus says have faith in God this is instructive in this curse that the tree having not fulfilled its purpose is cursed it ought to have given fruit to Christ as he come looking for it and in Luke chapter 18. I think I'm kind of laughing at myself at how much I put in this but in Luke chapter 18 the unjust judge is being wearied by this Widow and finally the unjust judge says just to get her to be quiet I'll Avenger and Jesus says in verse 6 hear what the unjust judge saith if the unjust will avenge the widow woman who wearys him constantly if that's what this would do how much more a righteous God and shall not God avenge his own elect his chosen which cried day and night unto him though he bear along with him though he delay though he tarry he says I tell you that he will avenge them speedily in his next statement is the means of that Vengeance it's the means of that Vindication it's the means of the rescue and the answer of the elect's prayer nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the Earth when the son of man cometh he looked he's looking for faith if I could say it to serve the purpose of this series he's looking for love and though it is said of when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on Earth and and we can look at it in the sense of the son of man's common now he's looking for Faith to find it it tells us it tells us what he's looking for and and not to suggest that he won't find it but it tells us what he's to what he's wanting to bring out what he's what the son of man is going to find Faith it's going to be discovered it's going to be brought out it's going to be what he's looking for and so if there's no faith when the son of man comes if we just look at it hypothetically if there's no faith then there is no satisfaction for Christ if there's no faith there's no fulfillment of Christ price of redemption could you imagine it comes and he pays the price and the price has been paid and it's been bought and then he he comes and the son of man is going to reveal himself and as the Revelation is going forth no faith No One Believes the price is paid but there's no belief and it even causes me to remember how that brother Branham Drew from that Supreme Court case where a pardon is not a pardon except it be received as a pardon and and and it tells me that when something is offered that the pardon as the Supreme Court looked at it there's some sort of contract that's being offered and and all this is just maybe too big for me tonight but it there has to be a meeting of the minds there has to be some agreement to the essential terms and so what what Christ offers the Redemption and this Redemption contract that there's many people who want to lay claim to it and there's many people who want to be identified with it and want to be Redeemed by him but that that Redemptive contract is to the elect and if the lack don't receive it there there it is wasted so the elect must must come to know that Covenant they must come to understand the contract that's being extended because because we are the match peace we are the other part to that [Music] you're the other part to that contract and so we there must be faith this is what he's looking for so are are you kind of finding do you feel like you're following me a little bit tonight the Earth has a purpose to get a bride out of it if the Earth doesn't bring forth a bride she's cursed because that's the purpose of the Earth and we see that that when Christ came looking for fruit of the seed that was sown in the beginning the purpose of the trees to bring forth fruit when he doesn't see it he curses it and says have faith in God and there's it's faith that the son of man is looking for that was I used I used those scriptures to show that the curse lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse it's connected with failure purpose so now you see why how important this ministry of Elijah is the Earth Waits it waits with the prophecy over it that except a bride come from it it's cursed and so where we see in one instance that Christ comes to the tree not seeing fruit he curses it and it's instructive to us in Luke chapter 13 verses 6 to 9. he spake also this parable and a certain man had a fig tree planted in his Vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none then said he under the dresser of his Vineyard behold these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none can you see the image of Christ in him coming to the Fig Tree wanting to see fruit now he's using this Parable to to express this and he says cut it down why cumbreth hit the ground that's quite a statement get rid of the tree it's a burden to the soil cut it down it's just taking up space and nutrients and it's of no use the only reason why I planted the Fig Tree is that I would get figs it's not for Shane it's not an ornament it's not for beauty it has one purpose if it doesn't bring forth that even though you could use it for shade even though it might look pretty it's just a burden to the soil so he said cut it up cut it down but now notice this is one of the parable this is the parable he's wanting to express something and he answered and said unto him Lord let it alone this year also till I shall dig about it and dung it so notice notice even this forbearance of God this part of this this Instinct of the one that dresses the vineyard who's saying wait a minute I I know that maybe it hasn't done it yet but could we just serve it a little bit more could we just give it more it says to dung it I want to give it some fertilizer I want to give it some nutrients I want to dig about it a little bit I want to prune it a little bit I want to shock it please let's not destroy it yet why why we can let's keep ministering to the Fig Tree so that it could bring forth the figs that you're looking for he says and if it bear fruit well and if not after that thou shalt cut it down so there's this Instinct and this desire that though the tree had not yet served its purpose you're saying wait hold on not yet when I was ministering last Wednesday I believe it was uh we're talking about love and hate uh brother uh Reginald been David plant sent me a text message after service uh and how that the disciples were saying oh should we call fire down from heaven should we just burn them on the spot and as a striking response that Jesus says he says you don't have any idea what Spirit you're of and that's striking because I think maybe there's if we're if we do I think sometimes we really like to lean heavy on God's judgment right we like Smite the Earth with the curse is that right tell me more right the ashes of the wicked now that would make a good series brother Aaron right there's just something that maybe we like about that you know but yeah let them have it but there's something to be said about Lord could you wait a little longer do you see that in Abraham where he says oh you're going to destroy them all and listen he he kept saying what about this what about this and God was complicit yeah we we said does God ever change his mind about his word God allows scenarios and say oh he changed his mind there he changed his mind there and what about the king who pleaded for more years but God allows these scenarios because there's something in his heart that when Moses stood in the Gap God's like that's it that's what I wanted you to say that's what I wanted you to do because this is something reflective about God to say ah this tree hasn't done it yet it's wasted it's no good get rid of it it's not it's not useful anymore I I think that's a lot about what a lot of people have tried to do in this message and the promises of it they say well Ministry hasn't worked for 50 years and church hasn't gotten us this for 50 years and they want to just shut the whole thing down and burn it up I say that's not the heart of a real Vine uh husbandman that's not the heart of God he says like that's my word that's my promise that's my dress wear it'll it'll work and so he says can I just dig it and dung it a little bit and so this I want you to just see that that that instinct the Earth was created for a purpose when something doesn't serve its purpose it stands under the judge it stands to be cursed and here a tree was going to be rooted up and tossed aside and the the the uh the the the answer from the dresser is weight and so God this is the this is the the mercy of God the Old Testament ends with curse and and then it the transition is it to the blessing of the New Testament and what is what is the the the the Old Testament ends with the mystery that Elijah is the prophet to the Gentiles and what does Matthew begin with the mystery of the Gentile women in the lineage of Christ and so there's a mystery that God has expressing in these things and if I could say this to kind of make a a leap here God sends Elijah because it because he wants his purpose fulfilled so he's going to build a Ministry vindicate a Ministry not I know again I guess I could say this because it's applicable there's a lot to be said about the justice of Elijah we recognize this and naming one of our children an English variant of Elijah that there's this sense of justice in Elijah's Ministry is one that's going to chase those false prophets down to the brook and slay them all right there's a there's a judgment side to Elijah but but you can't have the curse side without the blessing side and that and and so though the Judgment the judgments of Elijah and that Ministry of Elijah and his the the what he's going to breathe out in the Justice and judgment there is the restoration and the ministry of Elijah brings you face to face with Jesus Christ and so God sends Elijah to restore the faith in order to bring forth the fruit that he's seeking so God's not just sitting back looking at the church and he's saying oh a great look they blew it yeah way to go guys I send you the restoration of the gifts here you are you have the guests restored you've gone through sanctification justification baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts have been restored everything's looking great everything's wonderful and and they go and blow it and God's just like you know what this is that's it I'm done he's like no I I I'm gonna send I'm going to send a messenger I'm going to send I'm going to send Elijah the prophet in order in order to bring forth the fruit that I'm seeking because had he not just if you if you agree with this say amen I give you permission to say amen I know that it seems like maybe I've told you you're not supposed to so now I'm giving you explicit permission if he did not send Elijah there would have been no bride and he said well how could you say that well because he said it right if if he did not send Elijah there would have been no bride if he didn't prophesy in Elijah he would have prophesied some way to bring forth the bride but that's just the way that he did it and if he had not sent Elijah the Earth's purpose would have failed because it's exactly what he's saying in Malachi behold I send you Elijah the prophet to do something lest I smite the Earth with the curse behold I send you Elijah the prophet and in doing so the curse upon the Earth will be avoided that's the way it reads right is that the way you're reading it lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse I'll come and smite the Earth with a curse but first I'll send Elijah the prophet so I don't have to and if I could say this this is uh why this this has been at the very po the pulsating in me in preaching on perfect love this is perfect love that God would send this ministry there that that's perfect love if I could Define it this way perfect love is the ministry of doing whatever it takes to bring forth fruit perfect love is a Ministry of patience it's a Ministry of Grace it's a Ministry of long-suffering it's perfect love is the ministry of how we Define charity in First Corinthians 13. until it produces the product that that it's it's not going to give up it's not going to waste it it's making every provision it's doing everything that it can and when the Bible tells us in Revelations chapter 2 verse 4 when it says of the church I've got somewhat against thee because thou has left of thy first love they have left him but he hasn't left her there is walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and though she it goes down to the ground in martyrdom he's right there trying to build her back up again the church left him and if you think that's bad if you really want to look at the church ages you'll find there's the Gentile there's the the birth of the Christian Church which is those Gentile the the Jews that came that were birthed under the Messiah the there the baptism the Holy Ghost is coming out and then there's this transition time where now the gospels go to go to the Gentiles and when you read the church age begins because of the Antichrist working against the church and and it is very quickly now that the gospel is coming to the Gentiles it begins in that Warfare and this conflict and so you think it's bad that they left their first love and the ultimate Act of betrayal when you get to Revelations chapter 3 Christ has been kicked out of the church after he has gone through the process of restoration after he's restored the gifts they kick him out it's almost as if to say now that they got got the gifts they're like like hey isn't this awesome look at what look what we have now we have shouting we have dance we have praise and we can speak in tongues we can heal we can do all sorts of things and and they don't need him anymore and so Revelations chapter 3 verses 20 and 21 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I'll come into him and we'll sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne and the ultimate Act of betrayal the church kicks him out but guess what he's still there knocking and the Overcomer is him because he that overcometh is she and he says and if I could say this this is the Bride of co-equality that is going to raise up to sit with him in his throne it's the only place befitting such a queen and so the bride is reflective in this that though the church has seemed to felt its purpose he's saying nope I'm going to get a bride out of her I'm not gonna be left unsatisfied I'm going to get what I came for my word will not return to me void though the church May Fail I will just get a bride out of the church because my heart purpose must be satisfied this is perfect love God was powerful enough to go ahead and create a billion Earths until one finally worked out right and that's exactly how science believes that this has happened is that we are just billions upon a billion different iterations of uh genetics misfiring and firing to where we ended up like this and and science is kind of looking at this saying well this just looks like we all kind of mutated to this and I say if they kind of see that pattern then God could have just done that with the Earth just thrown a billion planets out there and just just see through all the different variations that there'd finally be one that would never make a mistake always be perfect just that woman walking through the garden and the serpent goes she goes up sorry right like that maybe that just happens that way but God is here saying no I made it for a purpose I'm not resorting to anything else but perfect love to accomplish my objective and have you ever read the Choose Your Own Adventure books anybody ever read one like that you know you cheat when you read it right you're like yeah turn to page 12 and like done you're like go back and you you choose the other page you know it's true so I'm gonna play Choose Your Own Adventure is it okay if I keep going and if you said no I was just gonna do something else gonna keep going the bride needed this Redemptive love the individual members of the Bride needed this Redemptive love and so now this is the difficult part and I don't know I'm waiting until like 8 15 maybe to get to this part because this we're gonna have to really really concentrate I believe that there is there is Redemption for the individual member and and what God does you can even see what God does to the church ages corporately and to the church ages he does to the individual that the the church ages we see stages of the new birth and we can't translate that meaning stations of the new birth as a member but we can see that in the church age God grants a birth to the individual and so the individual was a was born a sinner born in sin and needed Redemption and God's church now there's this image in the church where with she she needs Redemption they say well she's birthed she's birthed supernaturally she's born there on the day of Pentecost but there's this image that I want you to see where brother Brown begins to talk about the first husband of the world now in the sermon the invisible Union of the bride of Christ if you could I'm just I'm just I'm gonna reference something and hopefully be able to use it without going too deep on it I'm not speaking to this local assembly I'm speaking all together across the nation you must be dead to your first husband if you're United to Christ and still married to a denomination you're an adulteress you are laodicea that statement is so important that as long as you are in laodicea you are still identified with your first husband so he says if you're United to Christ and still married to a denomination and I'm I wouldn't say that he's suggesting that it's possible but he is he's at least showing that if there be some Union to Christ that that you're still in a they're still in adulteress if denominationalism is not dead he says you're you're lailed to sin now another place in that sermon he the bridegroom took away your shame so I'm not hiding anything here I can see I think you can see what I'm tracking and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world so I can see how this looks for the individual the first husband that you're married to the world the anointed bridegroom which foreign danger has washed you by the washing of the water now it's in discernment I look out upon the audience tonight and everyone here to me you look to me like someone who knows what I'm talking about in The Invisible Union he's showing who that first husband was tying tying looking at the type of the church who's unfaithful married to that old husband but now he's saying there's something happening there's a there's a washing of the water of the word now God has promised something in the last days to bring a bride out of that church and that church will be cursed that church will be condemned and he's using that image of the the bride coming into preview again layout to see us descending into chaos but there's going to be a bride that steps forth and so he's looking at the idea of a bride coming forth and he said that anointed bridegroom he washed you by the washing of the water of the word so there is this there is this not just a divorce there's a death to the first husband and so he says again in the same sermon now we know that the church could not the Pentecostal Church which is laodicea by no means by no means could carry out the last day message in its present condition could it why it can't even agree on one or two words in the Bible how are you going to do it it can't do it so you see denomination is out that's right it's going to be an elected people that's elected for it now no and so do every one of us know that the whole rank of denominational Pentecostal and all are dead that is to the born-again Christian of the message catch this your first husband is dead you know he's dead God let it die it's finished there's the grace of God there's the grace of God to let that vine die to let that husband die to say it served out its purpose but now that the bride has come forth I don't need the shuck anymore I I don't need that anymore I I got what I want and so there is this I I want you to recognize that principle of the first husband of sin the church the world and how that clung to you but now there's this ministry of Christ at the end time that says that old husband is dead and this the image that brother Brad the picture of the brother Brands painted you can see this reflected and I say albeit imperfectly in Hosea taken a wife of many whoredoms and though I say imperfectly it's because God is using types and shadows they are not they are not perfect in themselves they just are a shadow of perfection and so God wants to express the truth in hosea's actions and that's why I called it Love's great mystery the bride is at the core of the great mystery that's revealed in the end time it says the mystery of God should be finished as it has declared by his servants the prophets maybe we'll take some time showing this that mystery is a gentile bride part of that and so as we already read in Hosea chapter 1 Hosea takes Gomer a woman of many whoredoms and she becomes wife and she brings forth children and God prophesies through the names of those children and he says you'll no longer just be a people but there's going to be sons of the Living God and he talks about how great shall it'd be the land being the day of Jezreel so if you look at he Hosea chapter 2 verses 16 to 23 it says it shall come to pass it that day so Hosea has already taken Gomer she's brought forth children and now God if I I'll say it now said God is going to outline his great heart purpose and mystery of taking a bride to himself and and so if we could just read this so remember Hosea takes a woman to many whoredoms and he's wanting to portray a great truth Adam what did Adam do he redeemed his adulterous wife to portray a great truth Paul uh let's say Christ he pays the price of redemption to bring forth the bride Paul says I've espoused you as a church to Christ so now he says and it shall be at that day saith the Lord thou shall call me that thou shalt call me is she which is husband and shall call me no more bahali for I will take away the names of Balaam out of her mouth and they shall be shall no more be remembered by their name now recognize how how much we could show Elijah of Revelations the voice of Revelations 18 4 come out of her my people and as he calls us out of Babylon he takes the names of Babylon out of our mouth takes the doctrine out of our mouth the these things are taken out of our mouth and in the Turning of the heart that's not even in our heart to be in our mouth there's so so much we could see in this image of Balaam and in that day will I make a covenant for them with the Beast of the field and with the fowls of heaven and with the creeping things of the ground notice how it seems to bring in creation into view and I will break the bow and The Sword and the battle out of the Earth this is going back to peace this is going back to Harmony all the things that the fall brought up all the things the curse that has brought Wars and fightings and all these things he says and I will make them to lie down safely oh what a restoration back to a paradise and I will betray thee unto me forever this is a union that is not just invisible but indivisible yay I'll betrayal the unto me and righteousness and in judgment and in loving kindness and in mercies what a language he's using how is it that he's speaking so kindly to Israel in all of their sins and surely God would say you know what I know exactly what you're going to do because what did they did exactly they did it even to where the reason why he sends the message of Elijah and Elijah's prophesying after all I've done even in restoring the temple so Malachi says you know what his name will be great among the Gentiles and Malachi becomes the Cornerstone prophet of the Gospel turning to the Gentiles I hear this language he's using and it's all come to pass in that day I will hear saith the Lord I will hear the heavens and they shall hear the Earth this is the kingdom and the Earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and they shall hear Jezreel and that name is The God Who sows The God Who plants the seed the one who planted the seed under the original Covenant the one who who created the fowls of the air the Beast of the field the creeping things on the ground the one who planted who made the corn who made the the elements for the wine and the oil they shall hear shall hear Jezreel God's souls and notice this verse I know we've used it a hundred times in this church and I will sow her unto me and the Earth and I will have mercy upon her that had not attained mercy and I will say to them which were not my people Thou Art my people I I I've got to slow down I was so run to me in the Earth he's speaking about a sowing of seed remember how brother Bradham said all of our bodies laid in the earth upon the at the moment it was created and he said look you're there in the creation God knew only God could do this he puts all the elements there and all the genetic material and all the elements and all the nutrients and everything that's in it he knew would one day bring forth you in this body form and he laid it all out there he sowed you in the Earth even watched out over these the even the natural birth even says the natural birth is a is it Greater mystery and more mysterious than the Virgin birth and so he says I'll sow her unto me in the Earth I says and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained Mercy now as he speaks to Israel there's a fulfillment to Israel but it's more perfectly fulfilled and the Heathen people who were never promised Mercy nor given Mercy unto the Covenant to Abraham they were the uncircumcised they were the other nations they were the reprobate they were the Heathen God never showed mercy upon them but he says I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and this is the voice from heaven and I will say unto them which were not My People Israel were always his people but now he will say in a more perfect fulfillment Thou Art my people what is this this is here the heavens Thou Art my people and they shall say hear the Earth Thou Art my God hear the heavens hear the Earth the heavens say thou art my people in the earth's Thou Art my God I believe this is the Gentile bride fulfilling the purpose of the Earth this is Love's great mystery that God is going to bring a bride of his own choosing out of the earth and the heavens are going to say thou art my people that I foresaw from the very beginning as I prophesied the seed of the woman and Satan was always after that seed but I hid it in a mystery and brought forth a nation and a people in a land that would bring forth Christ I will do the same over the whole earth and all the other nations as I brought the bridegroom out of one people I will bring forth a bride out of all Nations and all people because that's my heart purpose Hallelujah Love's great mystery so as Hosea had taken Gomer and chapter one and she had brought forth these children now God begins to outline and share with us this is my Plan of Redemption Hosea married this adulterous wife Adam to portray a truth Adam redeemed his adulterous wife now Christ pays the price of redemption he's even rejected of his own but that price that's the price of redemption he pays it now paid there's another part to Redemption now that it's paid could you could you agree with me how remarkable church history is and how the New Testament so quickly begins to talk about the church's lukewarm it's become defiled by the Antichrist spirit and so Paul engages us to Christ but based upon the things that brother I'm saying based upon church history based upon the way that we come into the world because after Christ paid the price we didn't all start having children by Spoken Word but your first husband so in the sermon super sign he says what did Adam do when he come to his wife when he come to her he found her pregnant of an evil her own conception had received foul seed Jehovah before he could marry his wife did the same thing and he's saying it I believe the way he says it it's reflective certainly in the Jews you'll find that in spoken words The Original Seed in some other places brother Brown's making the same point so it's not just this one place he says in Jesus before he could get to his bride she had organized herself and become the Roman Catholic Church same thing this is his bride this is his church this is the one he's coming back he wants to come back and find Faith he wants to he wants to come back and find a virtuous woman this he's wanting to find her I paid the price I've redeemed you I've shed my blood I've made these great precious promises surely you'll you'll stay faithful you'll hold out to it to the end the church will just keep rise this trajectory but brother Brown says the cycle of Revival and death has never failed and they're getting they get lukewarm and Powerless and we see this through the whole history of the church ages he says but he will have a bride don't you worry that will be bought with his word just exactly what he told me to stay with he will have a church amen that will be bought by his word amen and so you have these women these types of chosen uh supplied failure chosen supplied failure and then brother Brandon makes the statement I think it's an invisible Union and now he finds her all messed up you'd think he'd marry such a thing as that now it's a rhetorical question that I believe is answered in one light of of course not right is that knife finds her in this mess you think he'd marry such a thing as that but I want you and I think that again I think the rhetorical answers he's saying no she he won't not in that mess hey there's a lot of people that believe the message and really what they believe is a mess age and that's what they're in but brother Branham now go listen to the sermon I think you'll see this theme come through this perfectly but now your bridegroom is here to wash you to to that old husband is dead he's wanting to this is wanting he's wanting this to be portrayed so now if you'll turn to Hosea chapter 3 he's already taken this woman of many whoredoms now he's portrayed this and now in Hosea chapter 2 he said this is what I'm going to do this is what I want to do this I'm going to sow her unto me and now notice what happens in Hosea chapter 3 verses 1 to 5. we're choosing Our Own Adventure can we go to Jose three would you like to go to a song you know 112 in the hymnal take the name of Jesus with you he says then said the Lord unto me go yet love a woman beloved of a friend yet an adulteress wait what did I get back to the beginning did Hosea stutter what happened it seems like we're back in Hosea 1 again and there's a lot a lot that read this to say that this is actually a different woman many conclude that this is actually Gomer again here he is he takes a woman to many whoredoms and he takes her and he's going to make her wife but she can't stay true so now the Lord is down to go yet and love a woman beloved of her friend yet an adulteress and as I've read the different commentaries on how people try to how the different historians try to break it down who it might be whether it's Gomer or another one I see the bride either way he says according to the love of the Lord to the children of Israel how can this be he takes Gomer a woman of many whoredoms and yet she fails and he says go again a woman beloved again really again how not according to love of Hosea not according to our love not not according to some infatuation or some codependency or some kind of feel ill love according to the love of the god the love of Lord to the children of Israel who took down their gods and the flagons of the love flagons of wine so Jose so I bought her to me for 15 pieces of silver and for a homer of barley and a half Homer of barley you know what it amounts to fifth the 30 pieces of silver and 30 pieces of silver really indicates a lot in this was the price for a Slave the price for a woman of a certain age and it was the price that Judas received for Christ no more than a Slave trivial amount is how a lot of people look at it but what what did it really signify it was the price for her the price Hosea paid for her and I said unto her Thou shalt abide for me many days Thou shalt not play the Harlot Thou shalt not be for another man so will I also be for thee I know that Israel holds a natural type but I believe the bride is the mystery of this that yet again he says I will redeem her I will pay the price for her I will do what it takes and the story of hosea's relationship with Gomer I say it probably defies logic and human understanding but it portrays God's love for his Gentile bride though it speaks in type for Israel it also speaks of the bride and notice how he says you shall wait many days Thou shalt not play the Harlot Thou shalt not before another man he shall wait many days on spouse but I will marry Thee I am only for thee I will redeem thee and he says for the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince and without a sacrifice and without an image and without an ephod and without a teraphim afterwards shall the children of Israel return I see such a beautiful image of the restoration of the temple such a beautiful image of the Restoration in the Millennium shall return and seek the Lord their God in David their King and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter days and I say before we get there the son of man comes not son of David but son of man to take the Gentile bride to himself and he says I know what you've done I know that you're Fallen but this in the end time I come yet again to redeem you and you will have no other lovers and nor will I have any other church or any other bride that's why it's called the bright age he says in the invisible unit of the Bride In Christ your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God you know what the revelation of justification is you never did it in the first place now I know that you think that means you never did it be in when you did it right but you never did it in the first place who do we want to give the first place who is it that has the preeminence you never did it in the first place you never did it in the mind of God if you ate it from his point of view as far as he's concerned in his heart he this is the power of God not to wipe it off and start all over and put a billion planets out there but he has the power to redeem you as if you never did it in the first place from his vantage point from his point of view and so in his eyes it's as if you never did it in the first place in his eyes you're spotless you're pure you're sinless you're purchased oh Hallelujah he's bought me he's bought me in on purpose I'm purpose in my heart though I may seem to play the part of this one in Hosea I see a bridegroom who's committed I see one who won't give up and it's that perfect love that's going to win in me good brother Branham in the sermon recognizing your day and its message Brothers you could please come to your instruments and and start playing a song and the sermon recognizing your day in its message brother Branham draws a parallel between Israel and the bride and he's using Hosea and and as he does it remember the title is uh recognizing your day and its message and there's so much being said about the Jews but he's wanting you to see your place your day and your message and he uses this text see if you can't identify yourself in this this is what I'd like to say at the close of this service in light of what he promised Hosea 1 Hosea you show you portrayed this for me you go take a woman who had who had had been an adulterer you take her and you make her your wife and you and you you she her her her life her children what comes from her is going to tell a story and you can see you can see Israel just portrayed in that and then he says I'm going to sow her unto me and the Earth and and he says this in in chapter two I'm going to sell her unto me in the Earth this this is what's going to come forth and then he has Hosea take take Gomer or another woman of many whoredoms and adults who's begun into slavery into bondage he says by her and I bought her and he says according to my love for Israel and it speaks of this beautiful Redemption this time uh Israel's Redemption is time in the millennium and and it continues in chapter four and there's more rebukes but then finally Hosea 6 says verse 1 come and let us return unto the Lord this this is what these actions portray this is what it ought to bring out of us it is not not what he told the woman when he bought her abide abstain don't don't go back to that anymore you can't go back to that other thing that other thing is dead you got to remain true you got to remain pure State you've got to remain I'm only for you you're only for me so he says come let us return unto the Lord for you have torn and he will heal us hath Smith and he will bind us up after two days he will revive us in the third day brother Bram says those those days one thousand years two thousand years here we are in the third day he'll raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know we follow on to know the Lord his going forth as prepared as the morning and he shall come to us as the rain as the latter and former Reign under the Earth in order to do what get what he's looking for just as the rain falls upon the Earth to bring forth the seed which was sown and that which he's looking for so in this last day it falls together to bring you forth can you see the love story can you see his commitment to you and how we're portrayed in the story and that God writes a love story that goal that goes ahead and just kind of tells the worst of it in order so that we could come to a place in this hour and know that with each day that this continues there's one reason and that's love and that's the dresser saying hold on hold on just wait she's coming just wait she's coming he's holding it back because this Earth must give up it must yield every seed and I'm so glad to know could it be that the Earth is already beginning to shake but had been at the Earth is not already beginning to recognize that the purpose for which we were created that the reason for which we are even here is to see the Glorious manifestations of the sons of God is the Sea of Bride of his choosing and she is risen Hallelujah could it be that even the Earth is beginning to recognize the Fulfillment of purpose as the bride is bathed in perfect love oh what a great mystery that's portrayed in Scripture God bless you tonight let's Stand Together
