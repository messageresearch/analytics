[0:00] if you could take your Bibles and turn
[0:01] to Hebrews chap 12 I'd like to read the
[0:04] entire chapter and I'm not
[0:06] joking I would actually like to read the
[0:09] entire chapter if I'm not able to get to
[0:12] it because we run out of time towards
[0:13] the end Maybe by reading it now I can
[0:16] just quickly reference uh many of these
[0:18] things and perhaps we could uh we could
[0:21] just kind of walk through it together
[0:23] even as we read it and as we're standing
[0:25] uh maybe make some point some things out
[0:28] but my Bible has a heading the auth
[0:29] author and finisher of our faith the one
[0:32] who has begun it and the one who will
[0:34] perfect it he says wherefore seeing we
[0:36] also are compassed about with so great a
[0:38] cloud of witnesses and these are the
[0:40] faith of the Patriarchs and uh Moses and
[0:42] all these other Faithful Servants we're
[0:44] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[0:46] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[0:49] and the sin which doth so easily beset
[0:52] us and let us run with patience the race
[0:55] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[0:58] the author and finisher of our Faith who
[1:00] for the joy that was set before him
[1:02] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:04] and is set down at the right hand of the
[1:06] Throne of God so we see Christ who
[1:08] endured who persevered being
[1:10] forward-looking and having conquered and
[1:13] having overcome he's given this place in
[1:15] position at the right hand of the Throne
[1:17] of God so it tells us for consider him
[1:19] that endured such contradiction of
[1:20] Sinners against himself lest you be
[1:22] wearied and faint in your minds I
[1:24] believe that's important to kind of
[1:26] catch this Paul is addressing whether or
[1:28] not we'd ever lose our result we
[1:30] wouldn't remain uh remain deliberate and
[1:32] perseverant you have not yet resisted
[1:34] unto blood striving against sin and have
[1:37] you forgotten the exhortation which
[1:38] speaketh unto you as unto children my
[1:40] son despise not the chastening of the
[1:43] Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[1:45] him for whom the Lord loveth he
[1:47] chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom
[1:49] he receiveth if you endure chastening
[1:51] God dealth with you as with sons for
[1:54] what son is he whom the father
[1:55] chasteneth not but if you be without
[1:57] chastisement where of all are partakers
[1:59] then are you bastards and not Sons
[2:01] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[2:03] flesh which corrected us and we gave
[2:04] them reverence shall we not much rather
[2:06] be in subjection under the father of
[2:08] spirits and live for they verily for a
[2:10] few days chastened us after their own
[2:12] pleasure but he for our profit that we
[2:15] might be partakers of his Holiness now
[2:17] no chastening for the present seeth to
[2:19] be joyous but Grievous nevertheless
[2:21] afterward it yieldeth the peaceful fruit
[2:23] of righteousness unto them which are
[2:25] exercised thereby wherefore lift up the
[2:27] hands which hang down and the feeble
[2:29] knees and make straight paths for your
[2:31] feet lest that which is lame be turned
[2:33] out of the way but let it rather be
[2:35] healed here's some uh pretty Specific
[2:39] Instructions in light of all this follow
[2:40] peace with all men and Holiness without
[2:42] which no man shall see the Lord looking
[2:45] diligent lest any man fail of the grace
[2:46] of God lest any root of bitterness
[2:48] springing up trouble you and thereby
[2:49] many be defiled lest there be any
[2:52] fornicator or profane person as Esau who
[2:55] for one morsel of meat sold his
[2:57] Birthright now this is quite a a warning
[3:00] in this passage we are sons and he
[3:02] dealth with his sons and and Christ
[3:05] overcame and he persevered don't faint
[3:06] don't faint he gives us this image of
[3:08] Esau for ye know how that afterward when
[3:11] he would have inherited the blessing he
[3:13] was rejected for he found no place of
[3:15] repentance though he sought it carefully
[3:17] with tears for you not come under the
[3:19] mount that might be touched that burned
[3:20] with fire nor un Blackness and darkness
[3:22] and Tempest the sound of a trump and the
[3:24] voice of Words which voice they had
[3:25] heard that heard entreated that the
[3:27] words should not be spoken to them
[3:29] anymore for they could not endure that
[3:31] which was commanded if so much as a
[3:32] beast touch the mountain it shall be
[3:34] stoned or thrust through with a dart and
[3:36] so terrible is the sight that Moses said
[3:38] I exceedingly fear and Quake but ye are
[3:41] come unto Mount Zion and under the city
[3:43] of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem
[3:45] and an inumerable company of angels to
[3:47] the general assembly and Church of the
[3:49] firstborn which are written in heaven to
[3:52] God the judge of all and the spirits of
[3:54] just men made perfect and to the Jesus
[3:57] the meteor of the New Covenant and to
[3:58] the blood of sprinkling that speaketh
[4:00] better things than that of Abel see that
[4:02] you refuse not him that speaketh for
[4:04] they escaped not who refused him that
[4:06] spake on Earth much more shall not we
[4:08] escape if we turn away from him that
[4:09] speaketh from Heaven whose voice then
[4:11] shook the Earth but now Heath promised
[4:13] saying yet once more I shake not earth
[4:15] only but also heaven and this word yet
[4:18] once more signify the removing of those
[4:20] things that are shaken as of those
[4:22] things that are made that those things
[4:24] which cannot be shaken May remain
[4:26] wherefore we receiveing a kingdom which
[4:28] cannot be moved let us have Grace
[4:30] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[4:32] reverence and godly fear for our God is
[4:36] a consuming fire amen you can be
[4:39] seated I appreciate your patience as we
[4:42] read uh that lengthy
[4:44] text not sure if we'll be able to finish
[4:47] tonight but this would be part 10 on
[4:48] when the youngans don't grow up and it
[4:52] just kind of I was planning on preaching
[4:54] this particular sermon and this subject
[4:56] matter on a Sunday morning just to have
[4:58] a little bit more time and all of us be
[5:00] together but I believe the Lord has just
[5:02] orchestrated it where it falls on a
[5:03] Wednesday night and so I feel maybe a
[5:05] little bit pressed for time and so we'll
[5:07] just be uh not maybe covering it in
[5:10] depth as I would have wanted to but I
[5:12] believe the point will be able to get
[5:13] across and the whole subject of when the
[5:16] young ons don't grow up is about
[5:18] maturity about growing into all that you
[5:20] can be and not failing in any potential
[5:23] it's about adoption as the last service
[5:25] we were ministering on that young trees
[5:27] May Frolic but mature trees fruit and so
[5:29] we're going from Frolic uh to fruit to
[5:32] maturity to expressing fully what we are
[5:35] enjoying all the rights and privileges
[5:36] that come with being a Son of God now in
[5:39] Galatians 4: 1 and 2 just going to jump
[5:42] right into it he says now I say that the
[5:45] heir as long as he is a child differeth
[5:48] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[5:51] of all but is under tutors and governors
[5:54] until the time appointed of the father
[5:58] uh Paul is looking at the subject of
[6:00] adoption he even uses this uh phrasing
[6:02] in the next few verses that this
[6:04] adoption which pertained to Israel which
[6:06] had it had its time of placing an
[6:08] adoption there at the end of the Old
[6:10] Testament he's presenting this to the
[6:12] Galatians and he's talking about them
[6:13] who've been Bewitched and they didn't
[6:15] finish the race and there was a lot of
[6:17] things that were working against them
[6:19] and expressing this principle he says
[6:21] the heir and this Heir is the one who WR
[6:22] by right of sunship uh is allotted an
[6:25] inheritance or a possession and so this
[6:28] Heir would be called a son but then he
[6:31] says as long as he is a child as long as
[6:33] he is one underage as the Greek would
[6:35] say it or as one who's between infancy
[6:38] in manhood as long as he is a child he
[6:41] differs nothing from a servant so
[6:43] there's a difference in the scripture
[6:45] between one a young who hasn't grown up
[6:48] yet someone that hasn't matured or a
[6:50] child and one that is a son where you
[6:52] said this is my son and this it's to
[6:55] express something Beyond just childhood
[6:58] and as long as he is underage or he's
[7:00] between infancy and maturity he is a
[7:03] servant in other words he has no more
[7:05] freedom than a servant as even the Greek
[7:07] would render it slave he has no more uh
[7:10] Liberty to make his own decisions he's
[7:12] not at his own disposal in some ways we
[7:14] could say that though he may be trusted
[7:16] to carry out certain duties there is not
[7:18] full trust committed to him so he's an
[7:21] heir and has a son and by right of
[7:23] sunship he has some inheritance or
[7:25] possession that has been allotted to him
[7:28] or that's going to be received received
[7:29] by him but as long as he hasn't grown up
[7:32] he's no different than a servant being
[7:34] no different than a servant he's under
[7:36] tutor so he's kept under teaching and in
[7:38] instruction and he's nurtured and
[7:40] corrected because as long as he is a
[7:42] child he doesn't he's not at his own
[7:44] disposal he doesn't have uh free reign
[7:47] and the Bible says though he be Lord of
[7:49] all and being Lord of all it means that
[7:52] by title he the whole estate belongs to
[7:56] him by the fact that he is the heir by
[7:58] the fact that he is the son
[8:00] uh it belongs to him but he doesn't have
[8:02] full possession yet he's not in
[8:05] possession fully of what he is a lord
[8:07] too he's Lord of all but yet he's not
[8:09] fully in possession so Paul is
[8:11] presenting a very quick complete picture
[8:15] that a child though he's an heir will
[8:18] never assume full responsibility and
[8:20] complete control over that which is
[8:23] allotted to him and granted to him until
[8:25] he's been raised up to a place and as he
[8:27] says to the Corinthians no longer a
[8:29] child but becomes a man so the heir
[8:32] differs nothing from any other servant
[8:35] and the Jesus says the servant abideth
[8:37] not in the house but the son abided in
[8:39] the house forever but this son if he's
[8:42] as long as he is a child he's under
[8:44] tutors and governors until the time
[8:46] appointed of the father wherein he would
[8:49] then be conveyed it would be granted to
[8:51] him and given to him as an inheritance
[8:54] all those things that he was Lord over
[8:57] so this is according to the law of
[8:59] inheritance or I would like to say maybe
[9:01] the right of the firstborn under the law
[9:05] if you're to study this study the
[9:07] subject of first Bor in the Old
[9:09] Testament and especially the subject of
[9:11] redemption and the Redemption of a
[9:13] possession the Redemption of an
[9:14] inheritance and we're just going to be
[9:17] scratching the surface but this is the
[9:19] law of adoption in the Old Testament how
[9:21] many have ever heard brother Bram
[9:22] referred to the law of adoption in the
[9:24] Old Testament how many have gone into it
[9:27] tried to find adoption as a word in the
[9:29] Old Testament well it's really hard to
[9:31] find I've even had ministers tell me in
[9:33] the past that there is no place in the
[9:35] Old Testament where there is a law of
[9:37] adoption but yet there some mysterious
[9:40] that brother Brandon would refer to it
[9:41] but here we're going to see in the
[9:43] scripture what brother Brandon was
[9:44] referring to he refers to the law of
[9:47] adoption in the Old Testament brother
[9:49] Bram defined adoption as a son being
[9:51] placed not your birth he said but you're
[9:54] placing and so it's the law of an heir
[9:57] or a child coming into full possession
[9:59] of receiving what had been determined to
[10:01] be his once he comes to that place of
[10:03] maturity and that's very clear in
[10:05] brother brenham's teaching now if you
[10:07] turn to Deuteronomy chapter 21 I'm going
[10:10] to be reading from verse 15 to 23 but I
[10:12] think initially we're just going to read
[10:14] to verse 17 here verses 15 16 and 17 now
[10:18] just kind of focus I gave kind of a
[10:20] setup there with Galatians 4 Paul is
[10:22] teaching this to the New Testament
[10:23] Church he's drawing from these things
[10:25] that we're now going to go over for a
[10:27] few moments here and let's not get lost
[10:31] in uh the polygamy here or the nature of
[10:34] man because it's actually C out the
[10:36] nature of man to have preferences and to
[10:37] hate one and love another and it's not
[10:39] espousing for that but it's addressing
[10:41] this Dynamic that could happen if a man
[10:43] has a mistress or has a child by another
[10:46] woman so it says if a man have two wives
[10:48] one beloved and another hated and they
[10:51] have borne him children both the Beloved
[10:53] and the hated so in the language said a
[10:56] man has had Sons but has children by two
[10:59] different women and he loves one of the
[11:01] women and he hates the other he says and
[11:03] if the firstborn son be hers that was
[11:06] hated so now do you see the setup a man
[11:09] has children by two different women he
[11:11] loves one woman and he hates the other
[11:14] but the one he hates is the one that
[11:16] delivers him his first son verse 16
[11:19] addresses this
[11:21] uh mess that a man can get himself into
[11:25] because of human nature then it shall be
[11:28] when he maketh his Sons to inherit that
[11:30] which he hath so here's the law this
[11:33] isn't necessarily establishing the law
[11:34] but it's dressing what was common and
[11:36] what would be traditional and what they
[11:38] would have done by right when he comes
[11:40] to maketh his when he comes when he
[11:42] maketh his sons to inherit that which he
[11:44] hath this is what a father would do he'd
[11:46] make his sons to inherit that he may not
[11:49] make the son of the Beloved firstborn
[11:51] before the son of the hated which is
[11:53] indeed the firstborn so you catch what
[11:56] verse 16 is saying that a man loves one
[11:58] woman and has a son but the woman he
[12:00] hates has his firstborn and that man
[12:04] cannot show favoritism to the second
[12:06] born son and give him what he should
[12:09] have given his firstborn when he makes
[12:11] his son to inherit this when this time
[12:13] when he's going to be either granting
[12:15] the blessing or conveying things he
[12:16] cannot give the Beloved Sons the an
[12:20] inheritance above the firstborn because
[12:22] he said the son of the hated is indeed
[12:24] the firstborn verse 17 said but he shall
[12:27] acknowledge the son of the hated for the
[12:29] firstborn by giving him a double portion
[12:32] of all that he hath for he is the
[12:34] beginning of his strength the right of
[12:37] the firstborn is
[12:39] his this is the law of the firstborn
[12:42] this is what the law of adoption relates
[12:44] to this is what Redemption is tied to so
[12:47] IT addresses a situation where a man
[12:49] would have a son who is indeed his
[12:50] firstborn but because of human emotion
[12:52] and and jealousies and and kind of a pre
[12:57] predisposed to certain feelings wanting
[12:59] to play favorites he would take that
[13:01] which was the right of the firstborn and
[13:03] give it to actually one who is not the
[13:06] firstborn it says he shall acknowledge
[13:08] the firstborn by giving him what is due
[13:11] and that is a double portion of all that
[13:12] he hath he says for he is the be he is
[13:15] the beginning of his strength the right
[13:17] of the firstborn is his so the firstborn
[13:21] is called scripturally the beginning of
[13:23] the father's strength in Genesis 49:3 it
[13:27] says Ruben Thou Art my firstborn
[13:29] my might and the beginning of my
[13:32] strength here we see in the in the
[13:34] beginning of the children of Israel and
[13:36] the sons of Israel uh in the lineage of
[13:39] Abraham Isaac and Jacob Ruben Thou Art
[13:41] my firstborn listen to the language that
[13:44] he uses my might and the beginning of my
[13:46] strength the Excellency of dignity and
[13:49] the Excellency of power this is the
[13:52] concept of the firstborn it is the uh
[13:57] this is these are the things that
[13:59] pertain to the firstborn this is how the
[14:01] firstborn is viewed and the and the awe
[14:04] and the honor that would be granted to
[14:05] the first born now as we don't have time
[14:08] tonight I'm sure some of you could be
[14:10] thinking in the scripture of many
[14:11] different places where the firstborn
[14:12] comes up and these things that were
[14:14] reading answer to why God condemned the
[14:17] firstborn in that last plague of death
[14:19] in The Exodus it speaks to us why the
[14:22] firstborn was to be offered up as a
[14:24] sacrifice to God and these tithes and
[14:26] these offerings that were given you
[14:28] would give the first give the firstborn
[14:30] as a matter of fact when um the
[14:32] priesthood was being established all
[14:34] Israel was to allow their firstborn son
[14:36] to serve in the temple and to serve God
[14:39] and and though there was some changing
[14:41] with that as time continued it was this
[14:43] idea that there was something special
[14:45] about a firstborn
[14:48] son and it says that the right it says
[14:51] my might the beginning of my strength
[14:52] the Excellency of dignity and the
[14:54] Excellency of power so the right of
[14:56] dignity and power and authority in the
[14:59] family belong to the firstborn now it
[15:02] doesn't mean the firstborn gets all of
[15:03] it just because he's the firstborn son
[15:05] it's in the father but all that the
[15:07] father has and his dignity and his might
[15:09] and his power and his strength is
[15:10] seemingly now going to be projected to
[15:13] and is as his strength wanes it's coming
[15:15] up in his son and all that might and
[15:17] dignity and Excellency in the family
[15:19] that was the father's will is due to and
[15:22] belongs to the firstborn as the
[15:24] firstborn son he is the perspective head
[15:27] of the family he is due certain rights
[15:29] and certain honors and he has certain
[15:31] responsibilities that others wouldn't
[15:33] have as the Bible says here and many
[15:36] affirm that that he was to get twice as
[15:38] much of an inheritance as anybody else
[15:40] in the family as it says giving him a
[15:42] double portion of all that he
[15:45] had and is he would he would have
[15:48] preeminence among the other siblings and
[15:50] the other brothers this is Ruben the
[15:51] firstborn might and beginning of
[15:53] strength Excellency of dignity
[15:55] Excellency of
[15:56] power his concept is just throughout the
[15:59] Old Testament in Psalms 89: 26 and 27
[16:02] speaking of the Messiah he shall cry
[16:04] unto me thou art my father my God and
[16:06] the rock of my salvation and I will make
[16:09] him my firstborn higher than the kings
[16:12] of the Earth this is because he is the
[16:15] firstborn he says I will make him my
[16:17] firstborn and as the firstborn he's
[16:19] going to be a king and there's other
[16:20] kings but he will be a king higher than
[16:23] all the other kings of the Earth in
[16:26] Galatians chapter 3 when he's saying you
[16:28] are all children of God by faith in
[16:30] Jesus Christ and that we are Abraham's
[16:33] seed and HS according to the promise
[16:36] he's finishing up chapter 4 and he says
[16:38] now Brethren as Isaac was uh are we are
[16:42] the children of promise but as then he
[16:45] that was born after the flesh persecuted
[16:47] him that was born after the spirit even
[16:48] so it is now nevertheless what sayith
[16:50] the scripture cast out the Bond woman in
[16:52] her son for the son of the Bond woman
[16:54] shall not be air with the son of the
[16:56] free woman so then brethren we are not
[16:58] children of the bond woman but of the
[16:59] free this is again drawing on this law
[17:02] of the firstborn for the Bible says the
[17:05] right of the firstborn is his and ishma
[17:09] who is born of the handmaid and the or
[17:10] the Bond woman saying he is not the heir
[17:13] he is not the proper son but that which
[17:15] is born of Sarah he is going to be he's
[17:18] the child of the promise and to him
[17:20] belongs the Covenant to him belongs the
[17:22] promise and in Genesis chapter 22 it's
[17:25] the Lord that says take thy son thine
[17:27] only son Isaac whom thou lovest tells
[17:30] him to do what take him up on a mountain
[17:31] that I'll show thee and to sacrifice him
[17:35] but it's Isaac the Beloved son this is
[17:38] my beloved Son it's the same image that
[17:40] God gives Jesus Christ thine only son he
[17:42] is to he is considered and deemed by God
[17:44] to be the firstborn son and in Genesis
[17:47] CH 25: 5 and 6 for those of you are
[17:51] trying to track this and keep notes
[17:52] we're just building off of Deuteronomy
[17:53] 21 that's speaking about the right of
[17:56] the firstborn and saying that in Psalms
[17:58] 89 n God says I'm going to make him my
[18:00] first born and as the firstborn is going
[18:02] to be higher than all the kings of the
[18:03] earth and now we're seeing this example
[18:06] in Abraham as Ruben the firstborn my
[18:09] might and my beginning of strength the
[18:12] Excellency of dignity and power here we
[18:14] see Abraham in verse 5 and Abraham gave
[18:17] all that he had unto Isaac so that's the
[18:21] the the conveyance to the firstborn now
[18:23] he has other sons and notice what it
[18:25] says but under the sons of the
[18:26] concubines which Abraham had Abraham
[18:29] gave gifts now what would you rather
[18:31] have all or the
[18:34] gifts and Unto the Sons of the
[18:36] concubines which Abraham had Abraham
[18:38] gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac
[18:40] his son while he yet lived Eastward unto
[18:42] the East Country again when the servant
[18:45] of Abraham goes to find a bride for
[18:47] Isaac he tells the he tells Rebecca H uh
[18:50] unto him I come and my servant unto him
[18:53] has he given all that he have my my this
[18:55] son that I'm coming to find a wife for
[18:57] the scripture shows that Isaac the
[18:59] firstborn of Abraham the Beloved of
[19:01] Abraham is receiving all that Abraham
[19:04] had this is the right of the firstborn
[19:09] doesn't mean the father can't give gifts
[19:11] to others but all that he has belongs to
[19:14] the son all that he was this is what the
[19:16] son receives now an interesting
[19:19] scripture and again we're just kind of
[19:20] scratching the surface here I uh if the
[19:22] Lord would give us Liberty sometime in
[19:24] the future to go into this in Greater
[19:26] detail I would enjoy that myself self we
[19:29] could always Fellowship on it together
[19:31] uh as Believers just outside of this
[19:33] context but some this has just given us
[19:35] a lot of um just some things to look at
[19:38] in the word of God to help us on this
[19:40] subject now notice this interesting
[19:42] scripture in Deuteronomy chapter 25
[19:44] verses 5 to1 if Brethren dwell together
[19:48] and one of them die and have no child
[19:50] the wife of the Dead shall not marry
[19:53] without unto a stranger now that seems
[19:56] strange why is she not able to Remar now
[19:59] marry without the family outside of the
[20:01] family unto a stranger a foreigner one
[20:03] who is not related and so this is
[20:07] cautioning if a if a man has a wife and
[20:09] she has no children and then he's dead
[20:12] doesn't want this woman just to go marry
[20:14] someone else but he says her husband's
[20:16] brother shall go in unto her and take
[20:18] her to him to wife and perform the duty
[20:22] of a husband's brother unto her now we
[20:24] all picking up what is being laid down
[20:27] here in Deuteronomy that a a brother is
[20:30] married to a woman and he has a younger
[20:32] brother a brother who's not married is
[20:34] what the scripture is supposing and it's
[20:36] kind of this is what they're building
[20:37] off of in the New Testament where they
[20:38] go to Jesus and say well a man had a
[20:40] wife and this one died and then that one
[20:43] you know he died and his brother married
[20:45] her then he died and brother married her
[20:46] and it's like all the brothers married
[20:48] the same girl and it's like well whose
[20:49] wife is she going to be in heaven well
[20:52] it's drawing from this example here in
[20:54] the law where when a man dies without
[20:57] having an heir it's the duty of the
[21:00] brother to perform the duty of a husband
[21:04] to the his wife his brother's wife and
[21:06] it shall be that the firstborn which she
[21:09] beareth shall succeed in the name of his
[21:11] brother which is dead that his name be
[21:14] not put out of Israel now this I want
[21:16] you as we do not have time for this but
[21:18] instead of just saying oh well that's
[21:19] kind of odd ask yourself why is it this
[21:22] way it's because the land was so
[21:25] important The Possession was so
[21:26] important that place in Palestine that
[21:29] ground that they were given their
[21:31] position their identity the future
[21:33] promises the Resurrection the Millennium
[21:35] all these things was was held these
[21:37] types in this great location even the
[21:39] origin of humanity and all these things
[21:42] that were meant there in this land of
[21:44] promise which God gave Abraham saying
[21:46] when this woman when a wife a man dies
[21:50] without children that another one in the
[21:52] family would marry her and bring and she
[21:55] bring forth a son then that son will
[21:58] succeed in the name of the one that's
[22:00] dead so that his name is not abolished
[22:02] from Israel says if the man like not to
[22:05] take his brother's wife then let his
[22:07] brother's wife go up to the gate unto
[22:09] the elders now I want you to draw upon
[22:13] your understanding of what brother
[22:15] brandham called The Law of adoption in
[22:16] the Old Testament and how that he would
[22:18] say at a time appointed of the Father
[22:20] the father would take the son in the
[22:22] gate before the elders and he would
[22:23] perform a ceremony he called it the
[22:25] ceremony of adoption he' give him a robe
[22:27] and he said this my son who is my Heir I
[22:29] now confer upon him all rights and
[22:31] privileges uh that I would have he
[22:33] stands in the stead of me he speaks I
[22:35] speak no longer and this was done in the
[22:38] presence of Elders in the gate but now
[22:40] this is something totally different in
[22:42] the same presence of Elders he says my
[22:44] husband's brother refuseth to raise up
[22:46] unto his brother a name in Israel he
[22:48] will not perform the duty of my
[22:50] husband's brother he had a duty he had
[22:52] to perform it and she's saying he
[22:55] won't then the Elders of his his City
[22:58] shall call him and speak unto him and if
[23:00] he stand to it and say I like not to
[23:02] take her sounds very
[23:06] proper then shall his brother's wife
[23:08] come unto him in the presence of the
[23:10] elders and loose his shoe from off his
[23:13] foot and spit in his face and shall
[23:17] answer and say so shall it be done unto
[23:19] the that man that will not build up his
[23:22] brother's house that's what a son is a
[23:24] builder of the family name building up
[23:26] the brother's house and his name shall
[23:28] be called in Israel the house of him
[23:30] that ha that hath his shoe
[23:33] loosed quite a statement uh trust you
[23:36] can see just even this parallel and this
[23:38] overlap with the house of the Lord here
[23:40] is a man who dies without having a son
[23:43] and it was the duty of his brother to go
[23:45] and to take his widow to wife and to
[23:48] have a son who would raise up his name
[23:50] from the dead and keep the possession in
[23:52] the family and keep his name alive in
[23:55] Israel but when that brother would
[23:56] refuse to perform the duty if it was one
[23:59] who would not build up his brother's
[24:01] house think of the rights and
[24:03] responsibilities that we have as
[24:05] children of God and our role and our
[24:07] place in the house of the Lord these are
[24:10] just a few scriptures that speak of this
[24:12] law of the
[24:13] firstborn we see that there was one a
[24:17] husband who has two wives and he has a
[24:19] firstborn by a woman that he hates even
[24:22] though he may hate her and love the son
[24:24] of this the this other wife that he
[24:26] loves he is to give the right of the
[24:28] firstborn to the proper
[24:31] firstborn he is to receive a double
[24:33] portion for he is the beginning of the
[24:34] father's strength this is the law of the
[24:37] firstborn that we see Reuben my first
[24:39] born the law of the firstborn in Psalms
[24:41] 89 I will make him my first born higher
[24:43] than the kings of the earth we see it in
[24:45] in Isaac the Beloved of Abraham whom
[24:48] Abraham gave all though he had other
[24:50] sons that he gave gifts to it was Isaac
[24:52] that all pertained
[24:54] to and then with these principles in
[24:57] Scripture Deuteronomy 25 it shows that a
[25:00] woman who did not have a son that the
[25:02] brother is to bring forth a firstborn to
[25:05] bring forth a son who had then receive
[25:06] all that that father
[25:09] had now in Romans chapter 8: 29 it says
[25:12] for whom he did Forno he also did
[25:13] predestinate to be conformed to the
[25:16] image of his son that he might be the
[25:19] firstborn among many Brethren this again
[25:22] is a reference to the law of inheritance
[25:24] the right of the firstborn Christ is the
[25:27] firstborn
[25:28] but we are to be conformed to the image
[25:30] of Christ that he might be the firstborn
[25:33] among any Brethren the use of the term
[25:35] firstborn to a Jew would make them
[25:37] immediately begin to think of Isaac and
[25:38] think of all these different rights in
[25:40] Deuteronomy 21 and Deuteronomy 25 and
[25:43] the sacrifices and the offerings and all
[25:44] these laws of the firstborn the Messiah
[25:47] who was to be his firstborn higher than
[25:49] the kings of the earth and now we are
[25:52] being brought into view of being he
[25:54] being the firstborn the true firstborn
[25:58] and let me say this as the firstborn
[26:00] there are things due to him that are not
[26:02] due to anyone else that's why we do not
[26:04] worship brother Brandon we do not
[26:06] worship other prophets but we worship
[26:08] Jesus Christ it is what's du him it is
[26:10] his right he has received all the glory
[26:12] and honor of the
[26:13] father but he's to be the firstborn
[26:16] among many brethren in Colossians 1: 12
[26:22] to20 giving thanks unto the Father which
[26:25] hath made us meat to be partakers of the
[26:28] inheritance of the Saints in light so
[26:30] there's Thanksgiving to God who's made
[26:32] us a worthy and and fit to be partakers
[26:35] to receive an inheritance together with
[26:37] the Saints in light God who hath the
[26:39] father had delivered us from the power
[26:41] of darkness and ha translated us into
[26:43] the kingdom Reign the kingdom of his
[26:45] dear son so here is an image of a father
[26:48] with a son and there's an inheritance
[26:51] and he's translated us into the kingdom
[26:53] of his dear son and made us partakers of
[26:55] the inheritance of the Saints in whom we
[26:57] have reded Redemption through his blood
[26:59] because these things are tied to
[27:00] Redemption even the Forgiveness of sins
[27:03] speaking of this firstborn Christ his
[27:05] dear son for by him were all things
[27:07] created that are in heaven and that are
[27:09] in Earth visible and invisible whether
[27:11] they be Thrones or dominions or
[27:12] principalities or Powers all things were
[27:14] created by Him and for him and he is
[27:16] before all things and by him all things
[27:18] consist and he is the head of the body
[27:20] the church he's the head he's the prent
[27:22] one he's the chief he's the king who is
[27:24] the beginning the firstborn from the
[27:26] dead and that in all things he might
[27:29] have the
[27:30] preeminence for it pleased the father
[27:32] that in him should all fullness dwell
[27:36] and having made peace through the blood
[27:37] of his cross by him to reconcile all
[27:40] things unto himself by him I say whether
[27:42] they be things in Earth or things in
[27:44] heaven Jesus Christ is the firstborn
[27:47] from the dead he was the only begotten
[27:50] son he's the first born of every
[27:52] creature it pleased the father him being
[27:55] the firstborn to give to give his son
[27:58] the kingdom it pleased the father that
[27:59] in him the firstborn all fullness would
[28:02] dwell it pleased the father that in him
[28:03] and through him all things would be
[28:05] reconciled by him we read in Hebrews
[28:08] chapter 1:2 that he has spoken by his
[28:11] son whom Heath appointed heir of All
[28:14] Things by whom also he made the worlds
[28:17] in Psalms 2: 6 to8 yet have I set my
[28:21] king upon my Holy Hill of Zion this is
[28:23] the Messiah this is Christ I will
[28:25] declare the decree the Lord hath said
[28:26] unto me thou art my son son this day
[28:29] have I begotten thee now this is
[28:31] different than saying Thou Art my son
[28:33] today you were born or today you were
[28:35] conceived but this speaks to something
[28:37] different Thou Art my son this day have
[28:38] I begotten thee it's a specific time
[28:41] when this king is placed upon the Holy
[28:44] Hill of Zion it's a coronation it's a
[28:46] climax it's a handing over all things
[28:49] ask of me and I shall give Thee the
[28:50] Heathen for thy inheritance in the
[28:52] uttermost parts of the Earth for thy
[28:53] possession to who the son the firstborn
[28:58] the one Heath appointed heir of all
[29:00] things Thou Art my son this day I'm
[29:01] going to Grant to you all things all
[29:04] power and Dominion in Heaven and Earth
[29:05] the the Heathen as an inheritance the
[29:07] uttermost parts of the Earth for thy
[29:08] possession as the
[29:11] firstborn and I know I'm just reviewing
[29:13] some scriptures we've read in the past
[29:14] and just tried to find some select ones
[29:16] because my you want I want just read all
[29:18] the things we've been reading on
[29:19] maturing and growing up and and these
[29:21] things in this context Revelations 21:7
[29:25] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[29:27] things and I will be his God and he
[29:29] shall be my son not as a birth or not at
[29:33] Birth but this again is that coronation
[29:35] this is the placing he that overcometh
[29:38] shall inherit all things and this is my
[29:40] son this day have I begotten thee I'm
[29:44] conveying the blessing I'm granting
[29:45] possession I'm giving you everything
[29:47] that was right to you do to you
[29:50] Revelations 1: 5 to6 and Jesus Christ
[29:53] who is the faithful witness and the
[29:54] first begotten of the dead and the
[29:57] prince of the kings of the earth and him
[30:00] that loved us and washed us from our
[30:01] sins in his own blood this is the
[30:03] Messiah this is the first born he's the
[30:05] first begotten the law and the rights of
[30:07] the firstborn are
[30:09] his he's the prince of the kings of he's
[30:12] higher he's better than all the kings of
[30:13] the earth and by his blood he's washed
[30:16] us from our sins and hath made us Kings
[30:18] and
[30:18] Priests unto God and his father to him
[30:21] be glory and Dominion forever and ever
[30:23] notice how we have been made Kings and
[30:25] Priests but he is the prince and the
[30:27] ruler of Kings he is the high priest and
[30:29] we are the priest he is the greatest he
[30:31] is the preeminent but he has the
[30:33] firstborn is do that the rest of us
[30:34] we've been made Kings and priest but to
[30:37] him is glory and Dominion forever and
[30:38] ever not yet in full possession but in
[30:41] Revelations 5 when the book is open we
[30:43] shall reign with
[30:45] him why because now the firstborn has
[30:47] shared his inheritance with us for Paul
[30:51] says in 1 Corinthians 3:
[30:53] 21-23 want you to see that in Christ the
[30:56] firstborn the right of the firstborn
[30:58] belong to him but then God is going to
[31:01] share with us his glory according to the
[31:04] Covenant according to the promise
[31:05] through Christ and yet we can be Kings
[31:08] and Priests yet not ourselves in full
[31:10] possession though Christ
[31:12] is he says therefore let know man glory
[31:15] in men for all things are
[31:18] yours whether Paul or Apollos or sephus
[31:21] or the world or life or death or things
[31:23] present or things to come don't let Paul
[31:26] apollis or sephus of the world or life
[31:27] life or death or things don't don't let
[31:29] any man glory in men don't let any of
[31:32] these things take anything away from you
[31:33] for all or
[31:35] yours this is what's promised to you as
[31:37] children in Jesus Christ he says you are
[31:39] Christ and Christ is God's all things
[31:43] are yours he's going to give us all
[31:44] things in Jesus Christ this is the right
[31:47] of children of God Romans 8:17 and if
[31:50] children then hirs HS of God and not
[31:54] just Heirs of God joint HS with Christ
[31:57] the first B born in in way you could
[31:59] look at it two ways being the firstborn
[32:00] he was literally the first son of the
[32:02] father but to be the firstborn there was
[32:05] also rights and privileges associated
[32:06] with it so the firstborn also carries
[32:08] this connotation of being an heir one
[32:11] who stood to receive the rights and laws
[32:13] of the firstborn and so if children then
[32:15] heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with
[32:18] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[32:22] that we may be also glorified together
[32:25] so we are Heirs of God it's a
[32:26] relationship that could never change
[32:27] we're joint HS with Christ and is
[32:30] sharing that Glory sharing that throne
[32:32] and sharing all things is dependent upon
[32:35] whether or not we go through this
[32:36] process of character development to be
[32:38] glorified together with him now I know
[32:41] it begs the question and maybe even the
[32:42] Paradox well does that mean if I not
[32:44] disciplined and I don't do this and I
[32:46] don't do that does it mean I'm not going
[32:47] to be glorified together with him all I
[32:49] could say is pointed to the scripture
[32:51] that shows that there is a process that
[32:53] God is trying to B bre bring the
[32:55] believer through and those who come out
[32:58] through that process as Overcomers those
[33:00] who at the end of this process are able
[33:03] to stand before God and present things
[33:06] that are Tried by fire and that survive
[33:08] to them is a reward given Amen in
[33:11] Galatians 4: 6 and 7 and because you are
[33:14] Sons God has sent forth the spirit of
[33:16] his son into your hearts crying ABA
[33:18] father The Book of Romans he calls it
[33:20] the spirit of adoption wherefore Thou
[33:23] Art no more a servant but a son and if a
[33:26] son then an Arab God through
[33:29] Christ you are not a servant you are not
[33:32] foreign born you are not of a different
[33:34] household you are of the household of
[33:35] God the household of faith and if a son
[33:37] then you are an
[33:39] heir And that son as long as he is a
[33:42] child he will differ nothing from a
[33:43] servant though he be Lord of all though
[33:45] all things are his and all things are
[33:47] yours though you're an heir of God and
[33:48] join heirs with Christ there's a process
[33:52] that God puts us
[33:53] through there's a process of growing up
[33:57] and is because of this right of the
[34:01] firstborn Galatians 4: 1 and 2 now I say
[34:04] that the heir as long as he is a child
[34:06] differeth nothing from a servant though
[34:08] he be Lord of all but is under tutors
[34:11] and governors until the time appointed
[34:13] of the father if we could just for just
[34:16] briefly just think about this scripture
[34:18] and try to get a picture in our mind
[34:19] what Paul is saying the first born
[34:22] according to scripture and I hope we've
[34:23] read enough just to give an idea of what
[34:25] the Bible presents in great depth and
[34:28] Detail in other places that the
[34:30] firstborn assumed the headship of the
[34:34] family when a king had a son he's called
[34:36] a prince but what does he become one day
[34:38] becomes a
[34:39] king a high priest could have a son and
[34:42] he could be a priest but one day he
[34:43] becomes the high
[34:45] priest whatever the father was the
[34:47] firstborn becomes that not every son
[34:50] could do that only the firstborn could
[34:51] do that they could not occupy that same
[34:54] position at the same time so it's one of
[34:56] the things in the right Kings and all
[34:58] these different battles and The Heirs
[35:00] and that's why uh wives would you know
[35:02] would kill other sons and there would
[35:04] always be this fighting in the in in the
[35:06] world and in the Thrones because the
[35:07] heir the son the firstborn son if he was
[35:10] the son of a king then one day though
[35:13] he's just a prince now and though he may
[35:14] have some Authority he one day is going
[35:17] to be a king so the firstborn of a king
[35:20] becomes a king the firstborn of a high
[35:21] priest becomes the high priest the
[35:23] master the head the chief the ruler the
[35:24] leader whatever it was if there was a
[35:26] leader there was an owner there was
[35:27] Master it's the firstborn who stood in
[35:29] line to take the place of the Father the
[35:32] firstborn stood to receive all power a
[35:34] double portion the he was to have the
[35:36] preeminence among the family he was the
[35:38] one that would be looked to as the ruler
[35:40] and the leader and because of that the
[35:42] Bible says he was trained he was taught
[35:45] he was instructed he was corrected why
[35:48] because he's the firstborn not just
[35:50] because he's the firstborn but because
[35:52] of the right of the
[35:54] firstborn a lot of times we think well
[35:56] the firstborn this and the firstborn
[35:58] that and and it's just because they're
[35:59] the firstborn and we go by birth order
[36:01] and we go by all these different things
[36:03] but the reality is there was things
[36:05] promised to the
[36:07] firstborn things that were his and he
[36:09] could say one day this will be mine and
[36:11] that's going to be my name I'm the
[36:12] Builder of my father's house and I'm
[36:13] going to be the one that's going to
[36:14] inherit all this Kingdom if he was a
[36:16] prince one day the throne was going to
[36:18] be his if he was a priest one day that
[36:21] right of the high priest to enter into
[36:22] the most holy place was going to be his
[36:26] and because of that they looked out over
[36:28] the
[36:30] firstborn and it begs the question well
[36:33] what happens when the young doesn't grow
[36:35] up if this is what the firstborn was
[36:38] going to
[36:39] get the prince one day is going to
[36:41] become king the priest is going to
[36:43] become high priest the the the son of
[36:44] the firstborn of the chief is going to
[36:46] be the chief the son of the leader is
[36:47] going to be the leader the the son of
[36:48] the master the firstborn is going to
[36:50] become the master well what happens if
[36:51] that firstborn son by right to take the
[36:54] throne has never grown up what if he
[36:57] doesn't know how to lead what if he
[36:58] doesn't know how to go in and out what
[36:59] if he doesn't have the wisdom that a
[37:01] king should have what if he's never
[37:02] matured and taken
[37:05] responsibility well the Bible addresses
[37:08] that now we're finally answering the
[37:11] question when the youngans don't grow up
[37:14] in Deuteronomy chapter 21 we read verse
[37:16] 17 earlier and as we were reading it
[37:17] about the the the son when he maketh his
[37:20] sons to inherit all that he hath he is
[37:23] to give a double portion of all that he
[37:24] has to the firstborn the true firstborn
[37:27] born but he shall acknowledge the son of
[37:29] the hated for the firstborn by giving
[37:31] him a double portion of all that he hath
[37:33] for he is the beginning of his strength
[37:35] the right of the firstborn is his what
[37:39] is this a reference to the law of
[37:41] adoption the law of the firstborn the
[37:44] rights of inheritance Redemption and it
[37:46] tells you that whatever this father had
[37:49] his firstborn is going to get it if it's
[37:52] in Isaac he gets all if it's in this
[37:55] scenario under the law he gets twice as
[37:57] much everyone else has there's some
[37:58] people get gifts and they can have the
[38:01] gifts but my name is now going to be
[38:04] conferred upon my first born and
[38:06] everything that I was in life he is
[38:07] going to have and he is going to have
[38:09] the preeminence and he's going to have
[38:10] the ownership and he's going to have the
[38:12] right to pass down everything I passed
[38:14] to him to his children to his
[38:17] firstborn now that's quite uh it's quite
[38:20] a law of testation that's quite a law of
[38:22] secession and a law of inheritance and
[38:25] who it gets passed to so so a father
[38:28] would give everything he has essentially
[38:30] this double portion this preeminence the
[38:32] right leadership everything the throne
[38:33] is going to go to the firstborn now that
[38:35] sounds kind of scary doesn't it if the
[38:37] first born's not up to
[38:39] Snuff so it says in verse 18 if a man
[38:42] have a stubborn and rebellious son it's
[38:45] no coincidence that these are joined
[38:46] together it basically says if a man in
[38:49] in verse
[38:50] 18 if a man have a son that won't grow
[38:54] up right if the young and won't grow up
[38:58] if a man have a stubborn and rebellious
[39:00] son which will not obey the voice of his
[39:02] father or the voice of his mother and
[39:04] that when they have chasen him will not
[39:06] hearken unto him them what is Paul
[39:08] drawing from in Hebrews 12 what is it
[39:11] that he's looking at in Galatians 3 in
[39:13] Galatians 4 these very things that the
[39:16] firstborn is to receive a double portion
[39:19] he is the beginning of strength and the
[39:20] right of the firstborn is his but just
[39:22] because he has this right if a man have
[39:25] even a firstborn son who stubborn and
[39:27] rebellious and will not obey and when
[39:30] they've corrected him they tried to
[39:31] train him he still won't listen then
[39:33] shall his father and his mother lay hold
[39:34] on him I'm going to lay a hold on you
[39:37] boy and bring them out into the Elders
[39:39] of this city and into the gates of his
[39:42] place very interesting scene we saw it
[39:44] earlier in Deuteronomy 25 wherein the
[39:47] the Widow brings the brother before the
[39:49] Elders of the city says he will not
[39:51] perform the duty of his brothers of his
[39:54] brother to bring us forth seed to bring
[39:56] forth a son and in the presence of the
[39:58] elders and this man is called the one
[40:00] whose house of the house whose shoe has
[40:02] been
[40:04] loosed and we referred to the law of
[40:06] adoption in the Old Testament brother B
[40:08] said they'll take the son before the
[40:09] Elders of the city and there they would
[40:10] perform a ceremony in the public and
[40:12] they would put a robe on them in the
[40:13] ring and said this is my son and this
[40:15] day I'm going to adopt him and he's been
[40:17] my son from birth but today I'm placing
[40:19] him now this scene we can see in the the
[40:23] the Shadow or the antitype right here in
[40:25] Deuteronomy 21 this is is the law of
[40:27] adoption but we can say the son who
[40:29] can't be adopted the son who won't be
[40:31] adopted the son who won't listen he's
[40:33] brought to the same place before the
[40:35] Elders of his city under the Gate of his
[40:38] place and they shall say unto the Elders
[40:40] of City this our son is a stubborn is
[40:43] stubborn and rebellious he will not obey
[40:46] our voice he is a glutton and a
[40:48] drunkard kind of calls those two things
[40:50] out he will not obey he's stubborn
[40:53] remember these things stubborn and
[40:55] rebellious those two things are quite
[40:58] large modifiers of one's character and
[41:00] behavior he's stubborn and rebellious he
[41:02] won't listen he's a glutton and a
[41:04] drunkard he's selfish he eats to satisfy
[41:06] his flesh he drinks to stimulate himself
[41:09] he's not worried about wisdom he's not
[41:10] worried about Justice he's not worried
[41:11] about um discipline and all the men of
[41:14] the city shall Stone him with stones
[41:17] that he die wow now why would they do
[41:24] this so that thou shalt put even away
[41:27] from among you and all Israel shall hear
[41:30] and fear this answers to verse 17 a
[41:34] son's going to be given a double portion
[41:35] the son's going to receive some
[41:37] inheritance he's going to receive
[41:38] something of this land he's going to
[41:39] receive some possession he's the builder
[41:41] of the family name and I know this is
[41:42] very staggering that they're going to
[41:44] take a stubborn and rebellious son and
[41:46] stone him and if it pertained to the men
[41:48] guess what there'd be a church full of
[41:50] women here wishing there was a preacher
[41:51] who could preach because there wouldn't
[41:54] be a son survive in this day and age
[41:56] there wouldn't have been one of us that
[41:57] wouldn't have one time been considered
[41:58] stubborn and rebellious and he took this
[42:01] son and in the presence of the elders
[42:03] they stoned him to death to put away
[42:06] evil because that's how precious the
[42:09] inheritance was how important the name
[42:12] was this is what God's wanting to
[42:13] reflect even in the cruelty and the of
[42:16] the law and this Taskmaster this our son
[42:18] is rebellious he won't listen and he
[42:20] stands to receive at the very minimum of
[42:22] gift he's the first son a double portion
[42:24] and all that he has the right of the
[42:25] firstborn is his but we will not let a
[42:27] stubborn and rebellious firstborn live
[42:29] long enough to receive it is that not
[42:31] how it
[42:32] reads it says and if a man have
[42:34] committed a sin worthy of death he he be
[42:36] put to death and thou hang him in a tree
[42:39] and he be to be put to death and thou
[42:41] hang him in a
[42:43] tree his body shall not remain all night
[42:45] upon the tree but Thou shalt in any wise
[42:47] bury him that day for he that is hanged
[42:49] is a cursed of God this is what the
[42:51] scripture refers to in the New Testament
[42:53] cursed is he who hangs on a tree isn't
[42:55] it amazing that he that is committed a
[42:56] sin Worthy of death is to be hung upon a
[42:58] tree his body is to not remain till uh
[43:01] to through the night but he's to be
[43:03] taken down and buried who who who who do
[43:06] we know that this happens to this is
[43:08] Christ the innocent one the
[43:10] firstborn who takes the punishment for
[43:13] we who are stiff necked stubborn and
[43:15] rebellious the firstborn who was a true
[43:17] son a good son the right son proved to
[43:20] be the right kind of son he La was laid
[43:22] upon him all of our sins all our
[43:25] stubborness all our Rebellion
[43:27] and upon him who hangs upon this tree is
[43:30] cursed to God that th thy land be not
[43:32] defiled which the Lord God lord thy God
[43:34] giveth thee for an inheritance why is it
[43:37] God's so concerned Why is that the law
[43:39] speaks of these things because God gave
[43:40] you this land as an inheritance and a
[43:43] stubborn and rebellious son Can Lose It
[43:45] Go in the hands of a Philistine go in
[43:47] the hand of somebody else squander and
[43:49] waste and completely defile and ruin the
[43:51] inheritance and it's exactly the image
[43:53] you see in the New Testament where God
[43:54] gave him this land and because of
[43:55] Disobedience it's conquered by other
[43:57] nations Babylonian captivity time and
[44:00] time again the rights and authority and
[44:01] inheritance that these Sons had because
[44:04] of their negligence the Bible says they
[44:06] lost it for themselves and for their
[44:09] family the law of adoption the law of
[44:12] the firstborn the right of the firstborn
[44:15] has a caveat and has a clause that says
[44:18] but if he's stubborn and rebellious he's
[44:19] not to
[44:21] inherit though he is the firstborn if he
[44:24] doesn't learn obedience by the things
[44:26] which he suffered if he isn't made
[44:28] perfect then he's not going to assume
[44:30] all that is rightfully his though he be
[44:32] the Lord of all he's under tutors and
[44:34] governors but if he stubbor in
[44:35] rebellious and doesn't listen to the
[44:36] tutors and governors then the father's
[44:38] not going to Grant to him all that he's
[44:40] desires and all that he could be given
[44:42] as a matter of fact the Bible says he's
[44:43] to be stoned to
[44:46] death in Genesis chter 49:3 Ruben Thou
[44:49] Art my
[44:51] firstborn my might and the beginning of
[44:53] my strength and the Excellency of the
[44:54] Dig of dignity and the Excellency of
[44:56] power this is the
[44:58] firstborn but verse four unstable is
[45:01] water Thou shalt not
[45:03] Excel what wait what the firstborn my
[45:06] might the beginning of my strength the
[45:08] Excellency of dignity the Excellency of
[45:10] power this is what the firstborn is to
[45:12] be this is what we see in Christ this is
[45:14] what Reuben was to be but then this
[45:16] pronouncement you're unstable as water
[45:19] you're not going to
[45:21] excel you're not going to receive this
[45:23] Excellency of dignity you're not going
[45:25] to receive all this excellen of power
[45:27] though you were my might my beginning
[45:29] strength you will not Excel because you
[45:30] are
[45:31] unstable how because thou wentest up to
[45:34] thy father's bed then defil us thou it
[45:37] he went up to my
[45:39] couch says this in Genesis 35: 22 and 23
[45:43] and it came to pass when Israel dwelt in
[45:44] that land that Reuben went and lay with
[45:46] belha his father's concubine in Israel
[45:49] heard it now the sons of Jacob were 12
[45:52] verse 23 the sons of Leah Reuben Jacob's
[45:54] firstborn and Simeon and Levi and Judah
[45:57] and isachar in
[45:59] Zebulon Reuben was the first
[46:02] born he was his might and his strength
[46:06] but because he went up to thy father's
[46:09] bed because he laid with his father's
[46:12] concubine though he is Ruben the
[46:14] firstborn he lost the right of the
[46:16] firstborn because of his character
[46:19] unstable as water he lost the right of
[46:22] the firstborn because of his behavior
[46:26] the word of unstable means Reckless he
[46:29] was negligent he was undisciplined he
[46:31] couldn't be restrained and maybe we'd
[46:33] say today uh like hurting cats thou must
[46:36] not Excel like he was just a loose and
[46:39] flow and and couldn't be constrained he
[46:41] was unstable as water so he lost the
[46:44] right of the firstborn 1 Chronicles 5: 1
[46:47] 2 and 3 it says now the sons of Reuben
[46:50] the first born of Israel for he was the
[46:53] firstborn but for as much as he defiled
[46:56] his father's bed his Birthright was
[46:58] given under the sons of Joseph the son
[47:00] of
[47:01] Israel I want to point this out very
[47:03] quickly notice over and over again Ruben
[47:06] is mentioned as the firstborn of Israel
[47:10] but he is disinherited because of
[47:13] behavior I'm just bringing this up
[47:15] because I think it's important to note
[47:16] there's some that argue that Cain is not
[47:18] mentioned as the firstborn of Adam
[47:20] because of his
[47:21] misbehavior he's not mentioned as the
[47:23] firstborn of Adam because he's not the
[47:25] firstborn of Adam
[47:27] had he been the firstborn of Adam he
[47:28] still would have been mentioned as the
[47:30] son of Adam but disinherited because of
[47:33] behavior because it's the pattern that
[47:35] God follows with Reuben so Cain is not
[47:37] mentioned as Adam's son because he was
[47:39] not Adam's son Reuben the firstborn of
[47:42] Israel is disinherited because of
[47:43] behavior but yet he's still considered
[47:45] the firstborn unless there be any
[47:47] confusion he says yes he's the firstborn
[47:49] but his
[47:51] Birthright he the right of B the first
[47:54] born was his the right of the first born
[47:57] belonged to Reuben but it was given to
[48:00] Joseph because he defiled his father's
[48:02] bed and the genealogy is not to be
[48:05] reckoned after the birthright so even
[48:06] though he's first in order that right he
[48:09] would have had as the oldest son is not
[48:11] to be reckoned to him verse two for
[48:13] Judah prevailed above his Brethren and
[48:15] of him came the chief ruler but the
[48:17] birthright was
[48:18] Joseph's it could have been all
[48:21] Ruben Prophet priest
[48:24] king possession all of it could been
[48:27] rubben but because of his Disobedience
[48:29] it's it's separated out to Joseph gets
[48:31] the birthright and The Possession to
[48:33] Judah he's going to be the king to the
[48:35] Levites he's going to be
[48:37] priest and it's separated
[48:41] out so because of Disobedience do you
[48:44] catch this because of Disobedience what
[48:46] one has a right to they could
[48:48] lose he's a son he was the firstborn of
[48:51] Israel to him belonged the Excellency of
[48:54] dignity the Excellency of power but he
[48:56] was stable as water he was
[48:59] undisciplined he had bad character and
[49:03] therefore Isaac would not Israel would
[49:05] not
[49:06] see this Birthright go to Reuben he
[49:11] would not let Reuben be the chief
[49:16] ruler in 1st Samuel chapter
[49:19] 15 verses 17 to 23 I can't remember what
[49:23] part we've been in here recently when we
[49:25] were looking looking at the example
[49:28] of
[49:30] Saul and these these different types in
[49:33] the
[49:33] scripture but Saul after he disobeyed
[49:38] Samuel remember Deuteronomy 21 that if a
[49:41] son will not obey the voice of his
[49:43] father or the voice of his mother and
[49:44] when he's chastened he will not hearken
[49:45] unto them he calls him a stubborn and
[49:47] rebellious
[49:49] son he says wherefore then thou did not
[49:53] wherefore then didst thou not obey the
[49:55] voice of the Lord but did us fly upon
[49:57] the spoil and did evil in the sight of
[49:59] the
[50:00] Lord wait why did you do this and Saul
[50:03] said unto Samuel yay I have obeyed the
[50:05] voice of the Lord and have gone the way
[50:07] which the Lord sent me and have brought
[50:08] AAG the king of amalec and have utterly
[50:10] destroyed the amalekites his own
[50:12] sentence condemns him so notice what
[50:15] kind of King he is notice what kind of
[50:18] man he has notice what kind of Integrity
[50:19] he has or lack of integrity and in these
[50:23] it was in The Big Three now remember the
[50:24] big three what we were ministering on in
[50:26] those things and here's Saul
[50:27] representing the the this this sinful
[50:30] tendency oh I've obeyed I've done the
[50:32] right
[50:33] thing this popularity but then admitting
[50:36] he hasn't killed the king of amalec he
[50:38] hasn't destroyed uh utterly destroyed
[50:41] all of them he said but the people took
[50:42] the spoil sheep and ox and the chief of
[50:44] things which should have been utterly
[50:46] destroyed to sacrifice the Lord thy God
[50:47] in gilgal it's almost as if he
[50:49] understood the the assignment but he's
[50:52] just making excuses now and Samuel said
[50:54] hath the Lord his great delight and
[50:56] burnt offer offerings and sacrifice as
[50:57] in obeying the voice of the
[51:00] Lord behold to obey is better than
[51:03] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[51:05] Rams for Rebellion is as the sin of
[51:08] Witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[51:10] iniquity and idolatry wow these are the
[51:13] marks of an unruly child this is what
[51:16] would cause a firstborn to be
[51:17] disinherited this is what would cause a
[51:19] young to be stoned and to never receive
[51:21] what was rightfully his and here a king
[51:23] in power has chosen Rebellion has chosen
[51:26] to be stubborn because thou has rejected
[51:29] the word of the Lord he hath also
[51:30] rejected thee from being
[51:34] King not from being a
[51:36] son he rejected him from being a king
[51:39] because he did not obey the voice of the
[51:41] father he did not obey the voice of the
[51:43] prophet he did not obey the instructions
[51:45] he was stubborn he was rebellious he
[51:47] consistently did this we see later that
[51:50] Saul is still promised Paradise but he
[51:53] lost the throne because of his character
[51:57] now not only did he lose the throne he
[51:59] lost it for Jonathan when it was taken
[52:01] away from Saul it was taken away from
[52:04] his first born Jonathan would have been
[52:06] King had Saul had the right kind of
[52:09] character and integrity to preserve The
[52:11] Inheritance to his children's
[52:14] children but not being of the right kind
[52:16] of character he did not lose his sunship
[52:19] but he lost his throne because of
[52:22] Disobedience and I use this to
[52:24] demonstrate that a disobedient son could
[52:26] Mar a family's inheritance it could Mar
[52:29] a right to a throne it could squander
[52:31] power it could squander and sell the
[52:34] land so the law provided a way so that
[52:36] that her inheritance could be
[52:39] preserved even so much that if a man
[52:41] sold it it could be redeemed back if one
[52:44] sold himself he could be redeemed back
[52:47] why it's the law of
[52:50] God and a stubborn and rebellious son
[52:53] was stoned under the law so that a
[52:55] stubborn and rebellious son the sin of
[52:58] Witchcraft and that which is Iniquity
[53:00] and idolatry would not be joined to the
[53:02] name of that house the house would not
[53:05] be marred by a poor testimony would not
[53:06] be marred by poor example it would not
[53:09] be uh joined up with that which was
[53:11] wicked so a stubborn and rebellious son
[53:14] was stoned under the
[53:16] law but under grace he's
[53:19] disinherited he said well what do you
[53:21] mean he loses
[53:25] something and Hebrews 12: 22 and 23 it
[53:28] says but ye are com un Mount Zion un the
[53:30] city of the Living God to the Heavenly
[53:32] Jerusalem into an inumerable company of
[53:34] angels to the general assembly in the
[53:37] Church of the firstborn who are these
[53:41] firstborn they're written in
[53:43] heaven and you've come to the god to God
[53:46] the judge of all and to the spirits of
[53:48] just men made
[53:49] perfect all children of God are
[53:52] firstborn
[53:54] children God has no grandchildren
[53:57] but this is the uniqueness of God's
[53:59] design and his plan all children are
[54:02] firstborn waiting for Paul said the
[54:05] adoption the Holy Ghost itself the
[54:07] spirit buried witness of the earnest
[54:09] given as an Earnest of the fullness of
[54:11] redemption the full inheritance so all
[54:15] as children of God are viewed
[54:17] scripturally and in this type and in
[54:19] this way to understand God's nature it
[54:21] is we are all firstborn waiting the
[54:24] fullness of the inheritance
[54:26] the Church of
[54:28] firstborns and it is our Rel our
[54:31] relationship to God can never be
[54:34] lost if you are a son he's not going to
[54:37] say one day well today you're not my son
[54:40] you see you I just thought to do 23 and
[54:42] me before they go bankrupt and I'm sorry
[54:45] buddy I know I was your father and I was
[54:48] your God and it was kind of this really
[54:49] cool thing we had going on here for a
[54:51] while but turns out you're not my son
[54:54] it'll never happen
[54:56] you are a son you are a daughter but
[55:00] there are things that you can
[55:04] lose I'd like to close with just a few
[55:07] scriptures and and if you are so
[55:10] inclined I can't remember what parts it
[55:12] was but I think it was last year we
[55:14] preach on judgment and rewards and we
[55:15] spent a lot of time on the reward aspect
[55:17] in a son in this very context but we
[55:19] didn't look at it in detail of the
[55:21] firstborn but we looked in the message
[55:23] of the hour when brother was preaching
[55:24] hear ye him and he said over and over
[55:25] again he had a right to The Inheritance
[55:27] but he didn't inherit it if his
[55:29] character was bad right and he teaches
[55:31] that time and time
[55:34] again let me use this as an image to
[55:36] close on in 2 Chronicles 21: 1 2 and 3
[55:39] and Jehosaphat slept with his fathers
[55:41] and was buried with his fathers in the
[55:43] city of
[55:45] David and jehoram his son reigned in his
[55:50] stead in place of
[55:52] him Jehoshaphat was on the throne he's
[55:55] King and when he dies now his son is
[55:58] raised up in his
[55:59] dead he's there in place of and the same
[56:03] Rank and authority and profile and
[56:05] everything of his father and he had
[56:06] Brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat Azariah
[56:09] and jahil and Zachariah and Azariah and
[56:11] Michael and shathah all these were the
[56:14] sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel they
[56:16] were all Sons but only one went to the
[56:18] throne can you think of the image now
[56:21] that God wants to share Christ wants to
[56:23] share even his throne with us that to
[56:26] sit with him in his throne as he has sat
[56:28] down in his father's Throne this image
[56:30] we see in Christ in the New Testament
[56:32] draws from all these images we saw in
[56:34] the Old Testament and their Earthly
[56:36] means to understand a very Supernatural
[56:38] principle where God who was the
[56:40] invisible and intangible wanted to
[56:42] become tangible and a king and queen
[56:44] with co-ee equalness together he wanted
[56:46] to become this family wanted to become
[56:48] this household and this is God's way of
[56:51] achieving it he had a lot of other Sons
[56:54] but verse three and their father gave
[56:57] them great gifts of silver and of gold
[57:00] and of precious things with fent cities
[57:02] in
[57:03] Judah and God can give all sorts of
[57:05] gifts just as Abraham gave gifts to the
[57:07] sons of concubines and he pours out his
[57:09] Spirit upon All Flesh and he gives gifts
[57:10] unto men and there can be all sorts of
[57:12] gifts and all sorts of Frolic but the
[57:15] kingdom gave he to Jarome because he was
[57:19] the
[57:20] firstborn it's the firstborn that gets
[57:22] the kingdom it's the firstborn that he
[57:26] doesn't get the fence cities and
[57:27] churches and silver and gold and gifts
[57:29] and all those things but he gets
[57:32] everything he gets to rain in his
[57:35] throne and in 2 John verse 8 it says
[57:37] look to yourselves that we lose not
[57:40] those things which we have wrought but
[57:42] that we receive a full
[57:45] reward I just don't want the gifts of
[57:48] silver and gold and precious things I I
[57:50] don't just want fent cities in Judah I
[57:53] want the kingdom it's the god the
[57:55] father's pleasure to give you the
[57:58] kingdom I don't want just to I don't
[58:01] want to lose those things which I have
[58:02] wrought but I want to receive a full
[58:05] reward and let me read this statement to
[58:08] back up the dozens of places where
[58:10] brother bam says it he says it may seem
[58:11] hard to beginning but God knows what
[58:13] he's doing this is in sermon spiritual
[58:14] adoption sure he knows what he's doing
[58:17] the training the teaching the correcting
[58:18] may seem hard but he knows what he's
[58:20] doing then as the Holy Spirit brings
[58:23] begins to bring
[58:25] word that if the child has not been
[58:27] obedient when it becomes of maturity the
[58:29] age of maturity in other words when it's
[58:32] old but not mature when he's old I mean
[58:35] he's old enough he should be king but at
[58:37] the time that you're old enough and been
[58:39] in this message long enough and you've
[58:40] been doing this long enough when you
[58:41] ought to be teachers you become like
[58:43] goooo Gaga
[58:45] again he says when he comes to the age
[58:47] of maturity then the child is always a
[58:50] son certainly but it loses something
[58:57] it's the law of adoption in the Old
[58:59] Testament you'll find it in the
[59:01] law of the firstborn the right of the
[59:05] firstborn is
[59:07] his you're always a son you're always a
[59:09] daughter you're a child of God you're a
[59:10] young and the spirit of God moves you
[59:12] respond to it but as you grow and those
[59:15] roots go down deep you've got to come to
[59:16] a place of fruit you've got to come to a
[59:18] place of maturity if not you'll never
[59:21] lose your salvation you'll never lose
[59:22] your relationship to God but you lose
[59:25] something
[59:26] and I don't think it's necessary to
[59:27] focus on what's lost and and the
[59:29] negative side and some say well you said
[59:31] when the youngans don't grow up whenever
[59:32] you going to answer that well I'll do it
[59:34] on a Wednesday night just one service
[59:36] because the rest is what we should be
[59:37] looking forward
[59:40] to Revelations 3:11 it says behold I
[59:42] come quickly hold that fast which thou
[59:45] Hast your right to Redemption your right
[59:47] to Excellency your right to dignity your
[59:49] right to power all that is going to be
[59:50] granted to you all things hold on to it
[59:53] that which I H that no man take
[59:56] thy
[59:58] Crown if our musicians would come to
[1:00:00] their
[1:00:03] instruments I thought I had it in here
[1:00:06] I'm realizing now I took a lot of it out
[1:00:07] but remember how
[1:00:09] that or maybe I just skipped right over
[1:00:11] it I don't know maybe it's in here
[1:00:16] somewhere but
[1:00:17] Esau was the first
[1:00:20] born and as the first born he had a
[1:00:23] Birthright and with that Birthright came
[1:00:26] blessing and one day Esau was
[1:00:30] hungry and he asked Jacob
[1:00:34] for some food Jacob saw an opportunity
[1:00:37] and said well give me the right that a
[1:00:39] firstborn has give me all your rights
[1:00:42] that you have as being the first one
[1:00:44] they're both sons essentially born at
[1:00:45] the same time right the hill Grabber
[1:00:47] came out they're born very close to one
[1:00:48] another uh in in time they're twins but
[1:00:51] the one who's born
[1:00:53] first the one that divides the one that
[1:00:55] comes forth you'll find that in the
[1:00:57] scripture in the law as it's granted
[1:00:59] this one is the one that pertained he
[1:01:01] got the double portion he was the one to
[1:01:03] be raised up in uh in Isaac's
[1:01:07] stead and so Jacob says well give me
[1:01:10] that right of the firstborn and Esau's
[1:01:12] like well what good is it to me if I die
[1:01:14] going to be yours anyways so he sells it
[1:01:15] to him and then Jacob despi or Esau
[1:01:19] despised that right that the firstborn
[1:01:21] had because he knew he'd given it to
[1:01:24] Jacob story gets even more more amazing
[1:01:27] when Isaac comes to a place where he
[1:01:29] wants to bless
[1:01:31] Esau Rebecca overhears it and says
[1:01:33] pretend to be Jacob pretend to be Esau
[1:01:35] and give him his Venice and meal and as
[1:01:38] Esau's out hunting Jacob walks in he's
[1:01:41] like Jacob is that you or Esau he's like
[1:01:43] yes it's me he's like well you don't
[1:01:44] sound like Esau let me feel you and and
[1:01:46] he gives him the blessing and as soon as
[1:01:48] the blessing's been conferred on Isaac
[1:01:51] Jacob Jacob steals Esau's
[1:01:53] blessing now he has the birth right now
[1:01:55] he has the
[1:01:56] blessing and what's the question are Who
[1:02:00] Who Are You Esau and he goes well I I'm
[1:02:02] your firstborn this is what he says I'm
[1:02:04] your firstborn I'm the one to whom the
[1:02:06] blessing pertains and Esau laments not
[1:02:09] only did he get my the right of the
[1:02:11] firstborn but now he's taking the
[1:02:12] blessing with
[1:02:15] it and this idea of the firstborn let's
[1:02:19] just read through this again quickly in
[1:02:20] Hebrews 12: 1-1 17 wherefore seeing we
[1:02:23] are compassed about with so great a
[1:02:25] cloud of witness says let us lay aside
[1:02:26] every weight in the Sin which does so
[1:02:28] easily beset us and let us run with
[1:02:30] patience the race that is set before us
[1:02:32] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:02:34] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:02:35] that was set before him endured the
[1:02:37] cross despising the shame and is set
[1:02:39] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:02:40] God for consider him that endured such
[1:02:43] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[1:02:45] lest you be wearied and faint in your
[1:02:46] minds remember Esau was faint he was
[1:02:50] weary when he showed up that day at that
[1:02:52] campsite says you have not yet resisted
[1:02:54] under blood striving against sin and
[1:02:56] have you forgotten the exhortation which
[1:02:58] speaketh unto you as unto children my
[1:03:00] son despise not the chasing of the Lord
[1:03:02] nor faint when thou are rebuked of him
[1:03:03] for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:03:05] and scourgeth every son whom he
[1:03:06] receiveth for if you endure chastening
[1:03:09] God dealth with you as with sons for
[1:03:11] what son is he whom the father
[1:03:12] chasteneth not remember in Deuteronomy
[1:03:15] when we're reading there how that the
[1:03:16] son was disobedient it says our son
[1:03:18] Deuteronomy 21 our son he may be our
[1:03:21] firstborn but he won't listen and we've
[1:03:22] chastened him and we've corrected him he
[1:03:24] still won't hearken
[1:03:26] why were they doing it because he stood
[1:03:27] to receive something but if you be
[1:03:30] without chastisement where of all are
[1:03:31] partakers then are you bastards and not
[1:03:33] Sons you don't have an inheritance
[1:03:35] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[1:03:36] flesh which corrected us and gave them
[1:03:38] reverence shall we not much better much
[1:03:40] rather be in subjection of the father's
[1:03:42] spirits and live for they verily for a
[1:03:44] few days chastened us after their own
[1:03:45] pleasure but he for our profit that we
[1:03:47] might be partakers of his Holiness
[1:03:49] there's The Inheritance this is what he
[1:03:51] grants now no chastening for the present
[1:03:53] seem to be joyous but Grievous
[1:03:54] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[1:03:56] Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[1:03:58] them which are exercised thereby
[1:04:00] wherefore lift up the hands which hang
[1:04:02] down and the feeble knees and make
[1:04:03] straight paths for your feet lest that
[1:04:05] which is lame be turned out of the way
[1:04:07] but let it rather be healed follow peace
[1:04:09] with all men and Holiness without which
[1:04:11] no man shall see the Lord let me just
[1:04:13] put it this way unless you're bearing
[1:04:15] that image nobody's going to see
[1:04:17] it it's this grace of God and this peace
[1:04:21] and Holiness which we bear which we
[1:04:23] carry which portrays and reflects the
[1:04:25] car character of God if we don't have it
[1:04:27] no man shall see the Lord looking
[1:04:29] diligently lest any man fail of the
[1:04:30] grace of God lest any root of been is
[1:04:33] springing up trouble you and thereby
[1:04:34] many be defiled lest there be any
[1:04:37] fornicate or profane person as Esau what
[1:04:41] a amazing striking admonishment in the
[1:04:44] middle of this who for one morsel of
[1:04:47] meat sold his
[1:04:50] Birthright because of some craving
[1:04:53] something in the flesh through stubborn
[1:04:54] and iniquity through one morsel of meat
[1:04:57] he's profane fornicator he's included
[1:05:00] with he sold his right of the
[1:05:05] firstborn for you know how that
[1:05:06] afterward when he would have inherited
[1:05:08] the blessing he was
[1:05:10] rejected for he found no place of
[1:05:12] repentance though he sought it carefully
[1:05:14] with
[1:05:15] tears let us not make the same mistake
[1:05:17] that Esau had did now we can't be Esau's
[1:05:21] we can't be disinherited in the sense
[1:05:23] that we don't receive salvation we can't
[1:05:25] be disinherited in the sense that we
[1:05:27] don't receive eternal life but brother
[1:05:28] bam teaches us very very clearly when
[1:05:30] the young don't grow up they do lose
[1:05:33] something and I want us to be passionate
[1:05:35] about serving God passionate about
[1:05:38] bearing Holiness and following peace
[1:05:40] with all men and looking diligently lest
[1:05:42] we fail the grace of God making sure
[1:05:44] that there's no root of bitterness
[1:05:45] springing up that would trouble us and
[1:05:46] defile others let us not be a fornicator
[1:05:49] or profane person let us not be stubborn
[1:05:51] or rebellious but let us yield to the
[1:05:53] Master's tender hand listen to the
[1:05:54] things he's trying to to teach us lean
[1:05:56] into this fall into this message with
[1:05:58] everything that's in us live this word
[1:06:01] correctly and one day God's going to
[1:06:03] give you all that is yours if we could
[1:06:06] stand together and
[1:06:08] pray the Bible tells us when the young
[1:06:11] on don't grow up they lose
[1:06:13] something I want to be sure that I don't
[1:06:15] lose my
[1:06:17] crown and I want Lord with all that's in
[1:06:19] me I don't want to lose my
[1:06:22] reward our gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[1:06:25] tonight as we close this
[1:06:28] service Lord I trust that there's in
[1:06:30] this brief look into the Old Testament
[1:06:32] to see the right of the
[1:06:36] firstborn and how that because there was
[1:06:39] the right of the firstborn there was a
[1:06:40] process to bring that son to a place to
[1:06:43] receive what is rightfully
[1:06:47] his and because the land is so precious
[1:06:50] and the name is so precious and the
[1:06:52] household so precious and all these
[1:06:54] things so important in your image and in
[1:06:56] your type as the antitype Lord you
[1:06:58] provided in the word in the law a way
[1:07:02] that a rebellious and stubborn son would
[1:07:04] not Mar The
[1:07:06] Inheritance Lord if in some way a son
[1:07:08] did and and he lost it and he squandered
[1:07:10] it Lord there was a way to redeem those
[1:07:12] things
[1:07:13] back not the gifts the gold the silver
[1:07:16] and all that could be just wasted away
[1:07:19] but the name the house the
[1:07:22] land the kingdom
[1:07:24] [Music]
[1:07:26] and Lord as we see Adam losing it and
[1:07:28] forfeiting
[1:07:29] it we are told the land will not be sold
[1:07:33] forever and you sent forth your son the
[1:07:36] firstborn to redeem it all
[1:07:39] back lord this beautiful picture and
[1:07:42] beautiful image speaks to us now as Sons
[1:07:44] and Daughters of
[1:07:46] God Paul instructs Us in Galatians he
[1:07:48] brings it up in Romans we see it
[1:07:50] throughout the New Testament this
[1:07:51] process of growing into your very image
[1:07:54] because we are firstborn
[1:07:57] and Lord I think it in my heart as I
[1:08:00] look at it I know it occupies a very
[1:08:02] small
[1:08:03] place in the word in terms of the
[1:08:06] attention given to it but Lord I believe
[1:08:08] it's good for us just to take some time
[1:08:11] to gaze upon this aspect that you said
[1:08:13] don't let another man take your
[1:08:15] crown be sure that we don't lose our
[1:08:20] reward and Paul warns the Church of the
[1:08:23] firstborn
[1:08:26] to not make the mistake that Esau
[1:08:29] did I believe Lord we can't lose our
[1:08:32] position in you as far as a son or
[1:08:33] daughter Lord there's certain things
[1:08:34] that were granted certain privileges
[1:08:36] that we'll have as your sons these gifts
[1:08:38] the possessions but Lord the kingdom and
[1:08:41] all that therein pertains to it the
[1:08:43] throne and these different rights to the
[1:08:45] firstborn Lord I I confess today that I
[1:08:48] haven't been the right kind of a
[1:08:50] son Lord I confess that I've been a
[1:08:53] glutton I've been a drunkard I confess
[1:08:55] Lord that I've been stubborn and
[1:08:57] rebellious but Lord please don't give up
[1:08:59] on me keep teaching me Lord keep
[1:09:02] instructing me Lord chastise me Lord I
[1:09:05] I'm listening father I want to grow out
[1:09:08] of my immaturities I want to rise up
[1:09:10] above my insecurities Lord I want to I
[1:09:12] want to
[1:09:14] overcome the the the needs the wants of
[1:09:16] the flesh Lord I don't want to be an
[1:09:18] Esau who just sell out in a moment
[1:09:20] because I'm
[1:09:21] thirsty God help us Lord I pray for all
[1:09:24] of us here today that we would not be a
[1:09:26] young and that doesn't grow up that we
[1:09:28] wouldn't come to what would be the age
[1:09:30] of maturity and find that we can't
[1:09:32] receive all our inheritance but Lord may
[1:09:34] we be that obedient son in the gate that
[1:09:38] the father can say this is my son today
[1:09:41] today I confer and bless all to him we
[1:09:47] commend ourselves to you tonight Lord
[1:09:49] pray your blessing upon your people Lord
[1:09:51] I Thank you for each one sister Rebecca
[1:09:53] playing the piano brother Phillip
[1:09:54] leading songs and brother Elliot on the
[1:09:57] Cahone sister Hannah singing a special

[1:10:02] and just those that take up the offering

[1:10:12] serve in this
[1:10:14] house may we just bind closer together
[1:10:16] Lord May none of us feel disconnected
[1:10:19] May none of us just feel like we're on
[1:10:20] the fringes Lord and even if we some
[1:10:22] Miss some services and they're they're
[1:10:24] streaming I mean Lord and though there's
[1:10:26] other families that are moving and other
[1:10:28] families finding their place in other
[1:10:30] assemblies Lord we just Rejoice to see
[1:10:32] that Sons and Daughters of God are
[1:10:33] finding their place but for us Lord here
[1:10:35] now may we be faithful to that which
[1:10:37] youve called us to shake us Lord that we
[1:10:40] just bind ourselves closer together let
[1:10:42] these roots go down deep may your spirit
[1:10:45] be free to move amongst us Lord we ask
[1:10:48] all these things name the Lord Jesus
[1:10:49] Christ amen
