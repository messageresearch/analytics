TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I don't think it'd be difficult to pick up on what we're wanting to minister on just by reading that it really is the the scene that I hope to end on in picturing Samson in this situation with his head upon Delilah's lap and his Seven Locks being cut off I think it's a very uh striking picture so as we continue on the subject of the house of the Lord I want to do part five on The Big Three we're taking the three Temptations of Jesus the three Temptations of ministers churches organizations and individuals and looking at them from the standpoint in first John of the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life I'd say that's the scriptural big three and how that those three correspond to money women and popularity and as we look at this we're wanting to identify Satan's uh Mo for our lives how he approaches us how he attacks us uh how that he attacks ministers how he attacks churches organizations how he approached the woman in the garden how he approached Jesus in the wilderness and it's exposing his tactics the way that he works so as we go through these and you you might be young enough to say well I don't have money problems but that could be uh it present itself in a different way you say well I'm I'm not I'm too young I don't have lust problems but Satan has ways of approaching the youngest even to the oldest in all these different categories to try to stumble us and we looked at Jude verse 11 and it says woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the ER of balam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of Kora briefly we've touched on a couple times how that the gainsaying of Kora is that popularity or the pride of life we could see that in the scripture and the way of Cain this would be that lust of the eye and uh uh women we could we'll be able to see that how that works together in the way of Cain but last two Services we looked at the heir of balum I I want to set this forth just to uh kind of bring us up to speed before we get into the lust of the eyes that's the lust of the flesh or the love of money and it's primarily uh Associated when you have the lust of the flesh it's satisfying the needs of the body the wants of the body whether it be meat or drink uh kind of those satisfying the animalistic uh desires that we may have these urges we might have in our flesh and that's uh can be rep represented in money it's represented the lust of the Flesh and brother bam said balam's problem was money and in numbers 22:32 I'm pulling this out uh just to rehearse how that balum as we read through things we see that balum doesn't appear to be uh doing what bik wanted him to do he seems to be upright he seems to prophesy the right things but yet there was telltale signs in his life that what he was motivated by and what he ultimately wanted wasn't to honor the word it they just paid lip service to it but in his heart was this greed as the Bible says they ran greedily after the heir of balum for reward and this is when the angel Lord stood and the donkey that he was riding on could see it and was trying to keep him from going and finally it speaks to him but bam had smote it three times and the angel lord said why hast thou smitten thine ass these three times behold I went out to stop you to withstand thee because thy way is perverse before me so his way it was his habit or his moral character his character was perverse and perverse means Reckless it might have seemed like he was doing good it might have seemed like he was doing the right thing but his way was perverse his moral character his attitude his motive and objective was Reckless and remember that the things on the outside don't necessar aren't necessarily indicative of one's character but it's the the character of the Soul what's on the inside that determines how one stands before God and so God looks at him says it may look like you're saying no it may look like you're being honest and upright but you never told him that I said not to curse him and you never waited for them to come and get you you just left on your own accord so your way your character is reckless before me why was it Reckless as long as he kept hanging out with bck he was going to constantly be tempted to do something that God said he should not do and that was tempt uh that was to curse Israel and in in numbers 22:34 balam said unto the angel Lord I have sinned for I knew not that thou stood Us in the way against me now therefore if it displease Thee I will get me back again it sounds like man balum what a good guy but it was not it seems as if God knew at that point that God already said your ways perverse and that what he ought have done is just humbled himself and said you know what you're right Lord I haven't been honest I'm driven by the wrong things there should have been some sort of awareness that he comes to him in the midst of all this to say you've already told me my way is perverse I know that what I'm doing displeases you let me go back I I realize I'm not being fully honest I didn't wait for the princes to come ask for me I didn't tell them that I shouldn't curse them and so what does God do God allowed it because he knew his way was still perverse he knew his heart was far from him and so balum is blind to his fault he doesn't see it he doesn't see how Reckless he has being because he's driven by the lust of the flesh he's driven by money and brother bam said when a man gets his mind on money he loses God when that becomes our meditation when that becomes our objective when that becomes what drives us when a man gets his mind on money he loses God now let's look at as we're kind of wrapping up a little bit there on the lust of the Flesh and there's a lot more that could be ministered on that aspect but I'm wanting just to be very direct on these big three and and just to get them out there but the lust to the eyes now this would be as we said before kind of that appeal to eyes and the process the mental process that goes with it eyesight is more than just the Optics uh of uh seeing something and the mechanics of seeing something but there's that visual part of it in the mind that translates the data that's being sent yeah and and causes some sort of response or some sort of perception uh we know in the Bible that when the man that was blind and could not see and the Lord touched him and he sees and he says I see every man uh as trees walking man as trees walking he's saying that he's indicating that the Optics are healed the physical part is healed the wiring is correct whatever malady was there had been healed but his mind that spiritual part of that mind part the mental part that interprets the data that the eye is giving and then provokes some sort of image or response that part had not been healed yet so that when he prays for him the second time it's not because his first prayer was ineffective God was trying to show us something in that and then he heals his mind and he basically gives him the data of someone who had lived his whole life to be able to see every man clearly someone who has their Optics healed late in life can look at someone's face and not tell if they're sad or mad or happy or glad they'll just look at them and they they don't know what a smile is they don't know what a frown is to them the Moon is so close they could touch it uh they can't they don't have depth perception they would trip over a curb they can't make distinctions and it's not because because the eye doesn't work itself physically but it's the mind so when we talk about the lust of the eyes it's not just what's seen but it's the pleasures of the imagination it's the mental processes that go with it and the lust of the eyes is this instinct to Value things that are new like the iOS 18 those of you who want it just become one of those the get on the developer beta and you can start uh impressing your friends with uh things that they don't have and so there's a way that you're drawn to the new you're drawn to things that are fun or beautiful and it's the process of the eye working together with human emotions to produce a response the lust of the eyes is associated with jealousy and vanity those empty things and those corrupting things when you behold something with the eye it's a gateway to then desire it with the heart in Luke chapter 4 when Satan took Jesus upon a high mountain took him up and showed him all the worldly kingdoms and their full glory in one moment of time that he was tempting Jesus with the lust of the eyes to see glory and Grandeur and power and then for him to begin to covet it and say I'll give this to you if you just bow to me and that was Jesus being tempted with the lust of the eyes in Genesis 3: 6 it says and when the woman saw that the tree was pleasant to the eyes it was emotionally stimulating not just visually pleasing in an optical sense like that's a really beautiful Apple but it it kind of provoked thoughts in her mind and her heart and she commits the ACT first in that that pleasantness as she sees it it's emotionally stimulating and she desires it so it's not just the act of enjoying something that's beautiful or enjoying the the side of something attractive but it's the lust of the eyes is when it provokes you to do more thinking to do more pondering and to act upon It ultimately it's why Jesus says in Matthew 5: 28 we'll read verse 29 towards the end but I say unto you that whosoever lookth on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart that's right to look at the woman it's to see with the Mind's Eye not just to see it but to see it with the Mind's Eye wherein You observe and then contemplate and so there may be some instinct to see something and when you see it uh it might catch your attention and the eye is processing things but there's a way that you can just let the thoughts linger I believe the story is told in brother bam says that uh there's these thoughts come into someone's mind and they have these horrible thoughts and and brother bam Council was well you can't keep them from Landing but you can certainly stop them from roosting and nesting and making a home there and he even tells a story how one time uh there this brother was in a prayer line and this nasty vulgar thought came into his mind and the prayer line is he's there in the prayer line praying for people with brother brandham and he goes to brother Bram and he repents and he apologizes said this horrible thought came in my mind please forgive me and he said brother that was meant for me that the devil trying to project that thought and give you thought so it's not the thinking or the seeing that's wrong but it's the subsequent contemplation of it to where you it says to lust after her in his heart yeah so it's that to desire and to covet after and and it's speaking to just how dangerous the eyesight is and what it may do to one's mind Proverbs 27:20 hell and destruction are Never full so the eyes of man are never satisfied his eyes will never have its F and when it says the eyes of men are never satisfied again it's not the Optics but it's the whole process of seeing something and then apprehending it entertaining it mulling over it imagining it having affections towards it being conscious of it in the mind the eye in the scriptures both the emotional and mental faculties I want to make this point the eye the lust of the eye is both emotional and intellectual good whatever Scarlet Letter we would put on intellectualism the same is on emotionalism the The Scarlet Letter you'd put on fundamental P fundamentalism alone to where it's only fundamentalism the same Scarlet Letter is on Charisma and fanaticism because they're both lust of the eyes one is emotional one is intellectual but they're both only in the spirit of man in his emotions or in his intellect and just as the lust of the flesh relates to the body and the S the the physical senses the lust of the eye relates to the spirit of a man and his mental faculties and those senses of his spirit that can both be intellectual and even the Bible says having itching ears because intellectualism can be stimulating and that's what some people enjoy but then for others based upon a lot of different factors can enjoy more emotionalism and body bodily exercise and it may be that you can line up certain quotes to castigate the intellectuals and you can line up a bunch of quotes to castigate the emotionalism but at the end of the day that Let them fight it out you stay right in the middle of God's word faith in God's word the word and the word only in Matthew chap 6: 21- 24 as the eye is Never Satisfied the eyes of man are never filled up that means it's a gate that's constantly Desiring and hungering and lusting it says in verse 21 to 24 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also and then he immediately says the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light there's this this your your mind your this these faculties of the spirit the light of the body is the eye this eye being a Gateway brother bandam alludes to how it's as if the physical eyesight governs all these other senses of imagination affections conscience memory and reasoning how that that sense you see things before you can smell it you'll see things before you hear it you'll see things uh before you taste it how it it becomes this governing force on all things if your eye is single the body is going to be full of light now I'm not going to break this down into great depth but I want to just point out how important this eye is but if thine eye be evil the whole body shall be full of Darkness an evil eye will ultimately corrupt it's causing you to be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness how great is that Darkness your misperception you're calling something right but when it's wrong that's the greatest Darkness if the light the understanding your reasoning your affection your imagination actually be Darkness if you're able to justify your intellectualism or Justify Your emotionalism and and you say that this is the way that it ought to be or this is the truth that's the greatest Darkness he says no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he'll hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God in Mammon so all those things that are Mammon are Mammon and you can't if you hold to one and you love that one and you give one preeminence and you make one your master then you'll hate the other one and and and you you'll just uh divide and be opposed so we must serve God not the lust of the flesh or the lust of the eyes or the pride of life we must serve God Amen as all that is in the world is Mammon Mammon is lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life Mammon is money women and popularity now as balum demonstrates money problems Samson demonstrates women problems and as balum showed how that one could be reckless in his character and he stays very near situation long enough to ultimately be influenced and then give counsel that causes Israel to stumble 23,000 something get uh uh slain uh we see and how that greed and money that Temptation was the downfall of balum women and the temptation of women be is expressed in the life of Samson of how that will influence an individual not just a man but individuals and cause them to stumble brother B Sister to Samson as he said to balam it was money he says to Samson it was Delilah the woman who woed him in her lap until he gave away the secrets of the Lord to her he says very plain a few places Samson fell because of women in the sermon the unfailing realities of the Living God he said Samson was a lot like our leaders today a ladies man chasing around from place to place after women like a lot of our leaders today like a lot of our compromisers on the word let a and lead them no doubt this quote was relevant with Trump in office but you go all the way back to Kennedy and you look at different leaders and you see the different ones who are leading and their personalities and and I know maybe we just like to point out the clintons and the kennedies and the and the different ones but we finally got our Republican who was a ladies man who multiple wives and things but Samson is a was a ladies man chasing around from place to place after women he says this is like leadership who compromise the word and let women lead them now jot it down take some notes in the margin because just as we tried to show in the word of God how that money was just not being rich or lusting to be rich but has a lot of other applications to the lust of the flesh the same will be so about women and just as uh the lust of the flesh has application in the spiritual religious realm so does women Judges chapter 16 verse1 we started in chapter 16 and this chapter starts with this statement then went Samson to Gaza and saw there a harlot and went in un her this is a pattern in Samson's life as it says that he went to Gaza and saw a harlot he goes in under so now he's going to have a relationship with this uh adulterous woman or this fornicating woman this woman of ill repute and he's demonstrating something that he always this was something he always did as we read as we'll read in this a little bit later God anoint Samson and he does great Miracles and he does Supernatural acts he's gone to Gaza he he has this in his heart he has a a character that is reckless or perverse he's laying with this Harlot but yet then God immediately will perform and manifest himself in very great ways in Samson's life but he has a weakness as you look at it becomes the bookend to almost every miracle that God manifest himself and we could tell the stories of this great power but then you could see something happens before and something happened after something happens after and though no matter what happens in the middle ultimately we realize that Samson's driven by one thing he can list a lot of outstanding Miracles he can list a lot of outstanding moves he can list a lot of things that happened that people could witness and the great exploits and manifestations and strengths that were absolutely Supernatural acts of God as the spirit of God anointed Samson's flesh that's right but yet he had a weakness good Judges chapter 14 ver1 and Samson went down to Timnath and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines judges 16:4 and it came to pass after that he loved a woman in the valley of SAR whose name was Delilah Samson's story just covers a few chapters but yet there's a few women already and in every instance his interaction with these women again I want you to really focus on how that when we say money women in popularity we think oh you just lust for money you know hit me up on cash app and Zell me something hit give me some vimmo money money money money money you want it you want the the the gas the Moola right we want some scratch those are also maybe some connection hints and there's things that you want you want to get it you want to have it and it's not always just that H there's there's problems that come with money there's things that that are perverse and Reckless and it manifest in a lot of other ways so if we can say this way it's the lust of the flesh which is is demonstrated by greed or by money and then here the lust of the eyes is going to be demonstrated in this uh gender if we can put it that way or in this type or in the woman and in every single instance where Samson deals with the woman there's deceit or some sort of Heartache when dealing with them there's some sort of trap there's some sort of setup there's some sort of difficulty he goes into Gaza and this happens he goes this and this happens and so there was something that he might have realized man every time I put myself in this situation this is happening but like balum the lesson is never learned there's no progress in Samson's life where he says man you know and we're only told of a few instances you don't know how many other times it might have happened where we could have finally been like by the time we get to chapter 16 he's like uh nah uhuh I've learned my lesson but it's there's no progress or growth because of weakness and make this very personal for us as individuals as Believers and the sermon Christ has revealed in his own word he says I was just talking to a young Minister and his wife in the room just a few moments ago and both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world the rest of human beings on Earth says I said remember Satan's got a Punch coming at you I don't care who you are he's got a right for that one punch which had you rather it be that punch maybe the nervousness that they had be blind or be arth CRI sitting in a chair or be nervous and I'll let the prophet ask that question I don't know if we want to engage in a wood you rather on this because in my mind I'm thinking how about we just don't box you know you know how about how about we don't have any punch but here he's saying what would you rather have and we might say I'd rather have this and I'd rather have that and I guess if you've got one and you know what it is just be grateful you know what it is instead of wanting somebody else's but he says he's got somewhere he can punch you so for all of us young and old every single one of us here even as we begin to develop and grow there's a punch that he can have at us that there's something that he can begin to angle and he's watching our lives he realizes just how you were raised and things that happened to you and circumstances and situations begins to say oh he's got a little bit of a complex there oh he's got this sensitivity oh this happened and so there's a way that he tries to have this punch he's got a punch he's got a right to that open space so there's maybe this vulnerability there's this weakness he says now that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time so we should never use the fact that we're vulnerable to a hook to get knocked out by a hook that there's no reason to say well you know I just I I just I can't keep my hands up I'm vulnerable to the jab there's no excuse keep it covered up watch for it it's not if you if you get knocked out you can't say well you had one punch coming said you've trained for this over and over and over again he said this is what he does he'll do two to the body then he's coming with the left hook and you've got to know to avoid it he's got a Punch coming so keep it covered at all time you got to keep your hands up you got to keep your guard up you say well my punch is my punch is this my punch is that I'm vulnerable to this keep it guarded what if if you have one that's more pronounced in your life of this big three and and you want to narrow it down I know just exactly what my problem is I know EX ly what my lust is keep it guarded amen and stay covered by the blood walk in the light as he is in the light amen now in Judges chapter 14 veres 1 to3 we'll read a little bit more about Samson's pattern as we saw that he went to Gaza and slept with a harlot and then he sees this woman in Tim math in the beginning and then he loves Delilah and we see these women in his life and just these three and again maybe he called them his big three and that's why they get memorialized in judges 14 or judges it says and Samson went down to Timnath and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines and he came up and told his father and his mother and said I have seen a woman in tinth of the daughters of the pH Philistines now therefore get her for me to wife this is we we'll see it as we keep reading but this is like almost like love at first sight he Caesar this is the lust of the eyes that's where it begins to work then his father and his mother said unto him if there is there never a woman among the daughters of thy Brethren or among all thy people that thou goest to take her wife uh goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines now let's just play a little Blues Clues here let's figure it out gold bug here we've got a mystery let's see if we can see any uh evidence is there never a woman among the Israelites what does that tell you this could have been big 33 there's something about these Philistine women is is there ever going to be a daughter among the Israelites that you'll like is there never going to be a woman that's a believer that you like he says but you'll go and take the wife of an uncircumcised Philistine now I will say this that the parents didn't know what was in his heart and the Bible says that it was in his heart to try to get back at the Philistines and that in itself isn't necessarily wrong uh and and the way that he was acting but yet just like balum we could say maybe there's something not totally right in his motive and objective and and I'm not I I accept fully what the scripture is setting forth there and I'm not trying to cause any kind of interpretation to it but he continues and he says this notice this last phrase there and Samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleaseth me well one translation WR she's pleasing to my eyes just almost it's not the same word word but it's very close to what the woman says about the tree that it was pleasant to the eyes he's saying she's fit for me it's purely a visual attraction and not just in the visual sense of it towards like that's a beautiful woman and and one could and even brother bradam and some places we remark how a woman is beautiful and she's pretty and it's not necessarily indicative of some kind of lust or some kind of uh foul thing but it's a for him it is this physical attraction this visually pleasing and yet it more than that because he says he says that she pleaseth me well he liked the way she made him feel so it's not just the eye but it's what it did to him the lust of the eyes and now he begins to feel like wow this is something I want get her for me this is the tendency of mankind to allow the eyes to guide him and therefore provoke some sort of anchoring or sort some sort of thought where in you're like man this is what this is what I want and it's a dynamic that works in our minds and even brother brandham said about the Catholic church that they figured it out these are my words now they figured out the lust of the eyes and they figured out how good Optics are and visual things are so they're capitalizing on the visual because it becomes a gateway to the spirit and anchors some value in someone's mind and because it looks a certain way they believe they want it they want to be a part of it they lust for it they like the way that it makes them feel about themselves and about whether or not they're doing the right thing it's just a tendency of man it's a bias that's been studied over and over again academically and with great scholarship how that what seeing something even in one particular instance uh they did a study where they took um three pictures one was the actual subject the other one was and then another one was that same person with their nose crooked and the third one was maybe a better looking guy and they would ask people rate these three most attractive to the Le least attractive and it was the one the two the one that looked very similar to the the ugly one with the weird nose and yet just but just since enough dis dissimilar in such a way to where the mind is shifted to the other one it says this one looks better because that one's so close but ugly uglier and disregards the one that might actually be better looking and so the conclusion the one who ran this study the conclusion is always hang out with your friend who looks a lot like you but just a little less goodlook maybe more ugly and that was the conclusion of the study I thought now what a waste of time and so that's it's just the way the mind works and the Eye Works in 1st Samuel chapter 16 I'll just tell the story it says that when Samuel looked on elab he said surely the Lord's anointing is before him and the Lord immediately rebuked Samuel 1st Samuel 166 and 7 look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature don't look on the outward things he says because I've refused him for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on the heart man sees externally and it pro provokes him internally causes him to conclude things and see things but God looks internally first even man who acts who's prompted internally it begins to act externally God looks and says now I know what's in your heart your way is perverse before me Samson is driven by the lust of the eyes and in judges 14 as you read it Samson marries this Philistine woman he throws a 7-Day Feast he invites 30 of his friends or companions as the Bible says and as you most of you know the story he tells a riddle based upon his own personal experience and he says as he tells this riddle that whoever can figure it out before the feast is over you got to solve it before the last the feast ends I I will give you 30 sheets and 30 changes of garment if you solve this riddle during the feast after 3 days they couldn't figure it out so they hatch a plan now we're looking at woman problems right it says it came to pass judges 14: 15 to 20 I'll kind of intersperse some things in here uh but we're going to be reading to verse 20 and it came to pass on the seventh day and you're thinking time's running out but this word here the seventh day is the SB Sabbath day which would have fallen maybe on that third or fourth day of the seven-day Feast it's confusing I I'm confused when I read it I was like wait a minute huh what but on the third after three days they can't figure it out and on that Sabbath day on the seventh day to the Israelites they said unto Samson's wife entice thy husband that he may declare unto us the riddle entice him to declare unto us the riddle lest we burn the thy father's house with fire have you called us to take that we have is it not so and so there's this suspicion and wondering you know why are we here and what's going on and there's these threats and intimidations and I want to make it very clear as Samson his problem was women let's let's look at how women problems manifested themselves in Samson's life he's newly married and notice how Satan attacks this is look at his Mo how he attacks and now he's working on the woman working on the wife in this instance in 1 Peter 3: 5-7 it says for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters are ye now listen here listen I know I don't have the slide there but listen as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement in other words he's telling Daughters of God you are tempted to be emotional Don't Be Afraid with any amazement it's easier for you to get worked up it's easier for you to become scared or suspicious it's easier for you to act and he says Adorn yourself and be in subjection as long as you do well and are not easily provoked as long as you do not let your emotions get the best of you yeah I wouldn't mind okay thank you was like I hope maybe at least one sister will amen so I don't feel like I'm going to be the women are all going oh yeah okay all right we're not coming back for evening service like Checkmate we don't have one it says so this is such a a beautiful scripture holy women trusted in God and yet trusting God they could Adorn themselves and be subject to their husbands why no not because they trusted that Rascal right not because they were suspicious not because they were scared but they trusted God was it that they trusted the husband they trusted God therefore they could Adorn themselves and he says so you'll be fine as long as you keep doing good and aren't provoked or afraid with any amazement and he says likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife so this is the ideal scenario to where the wife isn't trusting a reprobate or or a heathen the wife's not making herself subject to a husband who won't dwell with her according to the knowledge who won't honor her but yet she dwells with her own peculiarities and her own fears and realizing that she could be uh worked to be afraid with amazement but has a husband who will dwell with her according to knowledge and give her honor as unto the weaker vessel as being Hees of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered a lot to teach there but Peter's acknowledging that she's the Bible says the weaker vessel she's more feeble she's more weak she has less strength so notice it says the weaker vessel doesn't say the weak vessel come on weak husbands right oh now you want to lay out on me all right don't worry sisters they're going to be they're going to get the rest of it I'm glad I I'm glad I brought part six it's saying she's the weaker doesn't say you're strong you're just stronger be careful he who standeth be careful Les he think he stands on his own power and his own strength but God I'm the man of this house I'm the head I'm I'm the discerner I can figure this out I can do this no no no no you've got weaknesses too you're subject to like passions you can be tempted just like anybody else oh it's the grace of God that keeps us oh man I know what I'm doing I got I know what I'm doing he still got W and punch coming one punch and that's not a Japanese cartoon giving honors unto the weaker vessel she's more feeble you're feeble but she's more feeble you're weak but she's more weak you might be strong but she's not as strong it's the weaker vessel in 1 Timothy 2:14 it says and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression what did Satan do he worked on her first and in working on her he works on the man through her it's exactly what these men came to uh Samson's wife and said entice thy husband that he may tell us the riddle how is he go how is Samson going to tell them through the mediator through the actor of the white she was going to become the one that he would tell his secrets to them through her so the man they Satan worked on the woman to get to the man and Genesis 3:6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and what does it say and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat in this instance as we see there in the garden it's the woman who first then is influen uence and then the goal is now to bring it to the man to get to the man that he must also act and we know that Adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived and in her deceit in being in transgression she brings it to the Man and it doesn't say Adam was deceived but Adam nevertheless acted so here in Samson's life in judges 14 we see that the woman is working on him she's going after him or they're going after the woman so that she'll go after him now think about what Samson is teaching us about the lust of the eyes what is Samson teaching us about women that's not just informative to a minister that's not just instructive to a young evangelist that's not just related to to preachers but is also instructive to all of us as individuals to us as we run our families and also to a church how can a woman be a problem this is the image that brother Adam points out and I would encourage you maybe to go listen to Paradox but mostly maybe just once more and the once more sermons he preaches he's dealing specifically with Samson he says it's a picture of a demoralized he's talking about Samson in judges 16 it's a picture of a demoralized sunken generation it's a picture of a Nation that's lost its hold with God When a Man Loves money he loses God When a Man Loves women he loses God it's a picture of a church that's lost its hold on God's word cuz that's what Samson represented here Samson represents what happens when man lets go of the full word of God he said this symbol represents the very hour we're living in now the condition of the church now broken out of the word of the Lord humiliated out of its place yeah Samson as a man represents the woman the church out of its place Samson though he's a man he's influenced by the woman and he represents a moralized Nation a sunken generation a a a nation that's lost its hold on the word of God the picture of a church that's lost its hold on the word of God it symbolizes the hour we're living in where the church has kicked out Christ the word and gone after intellectualism or emotionalism humiliated out of its place in bondage I say to the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes now is the woman let's keep reading I know that we're nearing our time here I know maybe it might feel a little bit warm but it is hot outside Judges chapter 14:1 15 I think they had it there start with verse 16 and Samson's wife wept before him I'll go ahead and just read this and then go back so we can maybe save some time Samson's wife wept before him and said thou DST but hate me and lovest me not thou Hast put forth a riddle under the children of my people and Hast not told it me if you really love me I guess you don't love me you shouldn't have married me and that just I man all the language that that can be used here and he said unto her behold I have not told it to my father nor my mother and shall I tell it thee he's kind of caught by surprise I mean this is a riddle I don't want I don't want to be shelling out you know 60 60 pieces of gifts here and garments and clothing and different things I I don't want to tell the riddle and she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted and it came to pass on the seventh day I know maybe there's some types we could bring out here that he told her because she lay sore upon Him Samson had a problem with women come on somebody what does the woman do vexing him laying sore upon him working on his emotions saying well if you really loved me you wouldn't keep this secret from me right and it I mean I I I know maybe on his face it seems Petty but there's more going on here and the men of the city and and he she told the riddle and so it says that um and she told the riddle of the children of her people and the men of the city said unto him on the seven days so he gave in and he to it says that he told her because she laid s upon him and then she told the children of her people it's a key phrase she told the children of her people and the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down they waited the very very last moment what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion he and what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion boom and he said unto them this is one of those great statements if he had not plowed with my heer you had not found out my riddle let's not let's not use Samson words but if you had not plowed with my heer you had not found out my riddle and the spirit of the Lord came upon him and he went down to ashalon and slew 30 men of them and took their spoil and gave a change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle so he was going to pay but he was going to make them pay for it and his anger was kindled notice and he went unto his father's house but Samson's wife was given to His companion whom he had used as his friend if we just took this and looked at it very quickly as a whole the woman was able to manipulate the world's strongest man and the woman's manipulation of Samson and this weakness that we could try to gather from judges 14 will you ever find an Israelite girl we could say that this was a problem that he had but now the Bible tells us this story and maybe we're just surmising a little bit or conjecture there but at least in this story he sees the woman he really wants her he he gets her he marries her and this woman his wife is able to manipulate what we think is the World's Strongest Man and this becomes a great weakness weak nness and the men of the city the children of her people used his wife the woman this woman that was now joined with him he uses the phrase if you had not plowed with my heer a heer is a young female calf and so he says this in a way to indicate this is my heer this is my wife I'm joined to her but he's pointed out that she's also young she she doesn't quite fully understand the Loyalty that a wife should have to her husband she hasn't fully separated maybe from the ties that she has to her family or her people or where she's from the church she used to go to the things she's familiar with so there's a little bit of vulnerability to family influence to Regional influence as a vulnerability to the threat that was made and so in her Youth and her weakness she's not learned her her where her loyalties lie and where they're due she has not learned to honor her head not her house her household where she's from so he says had you not plowed in other words he used they used her and I read in different places where different men said there's no need to expound upon this it's evident on its face what he means but he used her they used her to dig in his heart to discover his Secrets plowed it up dug it out and and and she had to dig right she had to lay sore upon him yeah had to get past maybe his initial objections and and pray upon the vulnerability even of a young husband who wants to demonstrate his love for his wife who doesn't like to be questioned who who tells her thinking oh maybe this is something I need to learn at my age to be able to try I didn't tell my mother or father but we're one now and so whatever my secrets are your secrets and so what does he do he tells her and her infidelity her betrayal becomes a wound to Samson perhaps a motivating scar throughout his life you notice that this kind of dynamic and this marriage caused a separation between Samson and his wife caused a division it says that Samson went to be with his father in his house and this is how a woman can be a Temptation I don't mean to keep doing this I mean it's uh it's you may not like it but it's in the Bible Samson demonstrates how a woman can be a problem and we're learning from his life and and maybe not so that we would say as men a certain things or as women say a certain things but just whoever we are we could learn very next chapter in judges 15 veres 1 to2 it came to pass within a while after in the time of wheat Harvest that Samson visited his wife with a kid read this as a goat right he didn't just come with the child and say behold I have gotten you a baby he showed up with the goat during this Harvest he's wanting to bring peace he's offering some sort of reconciliation here's the dowy that was late the Samson visited his wife with the kid and he said I will go into my wife into the chamber so he's wanting to be a husband he's wanting things to be restored but the father would not suffer him to go in and the father said I verily thought that thou had us utterly hated her therefore I gave her to thy companion is not her younger sister fairer than she take her I pray thee instead of her in-law interference right this is how a woman can be a problem to a man this is how a a a woman can be a problem in churches right when sister churches interfere with other churches listen there's a lot of way we ways we could break this down but the story of Samson shows us just how messy these Dynamics can be when boundaries are not respected and when family gets involved and feelings get involved and head ship's not honored in the word doesn't have the first place amen and it shows us that maybe even to Samson it wasn't necessary that he found the woman beautiful and she was the most beautiful but he lusted for and desired her so much and maybe she wasn't necessarily pretty because and so what it does is it tells me that the lust of the eyes was a draw on his heart yeah he wanted to be with her but Samson there's prettier women and Samson there's women that are Israelites is like no but this one man I want her and maybe the dad is showing us that he knew Samson's weakness so he offers his daughter to him as the as they accused the wife of tinth the daughter of the Philistines well isn't that why we're all here Samson's going to destroy us and he's going to cause problems and we'll burn your house down if you don't help us solve this riddle and they threatened her and used the woman to get to the man now they're still thinking we need to make Samson happy especially after the fact that he stripped all the clothes off of 30 men to to fulfill half his bet and he offers his daughter like this this will get Samson right like Samson will take the prettier one and maybe it speaks to the fact that Samson's driven by something more than just what's the lust of the flesh but it's also the lust of the eyes if you continue to read these are the stories we're most familiar with that in his anger Samson uses foxes and then a Jawbone of a dead donkey to harass through the foxes and then kill Philistines a thousand with the Jawbone of an ass once again the pattern of the woman power woman power but it's always ending up again with the woman so in Judges chapter 16 veres 1-6 please do your best just to focus and and help me through this I want to finish I hate to leave the story of Samson hanging here then when Samson to Gaz and saw there a harlot and went in unto her and it was told the gazit some saying Samson has come hither and they compassed him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city and were quiet all night saying in the morning when it's day we shall kill him why is Samson in this predicament well it starts with the Harlot in verse one once again the woman is the problem in judges 15 it wasn't the kid it wasn't the goat it was the woman judges 14 it's not the riddle it's the woman and he says and Samson laid till midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the Gate of the city and the two post and went away with them bar and all and put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of a hill that is before Hein you following What's Happening Here sees the Harlot led him to commit fornication puts him in a vulnerable spot yet the spirit of the Lord comes on him he manifests the power of God and it's kind of a rebuke to the enemy but it's a woman that got him there and the power of God seems to keep bailing him out doesn't it maybe there's some uh trust that he's starting to give to where I can get away with anything good I we're the bride we're Invincible yeah we're going to write another book of Acts good so let's let's just let's just not use a Ghost Rider anymore let's not let the Holy Spirit write it bless God I can write this chapter let me do it and begins to write his story and keeps getting in trouble and God keeps bailing him out I say that to say that perhaps there's this callousness that begins develop in Samson's heart where he feels like the spirit of the Lord will always fall the spirit of the Lord will always do these things and as long as he's doing it we can tell ourselves we're okay wow right tell ourselves we're okay no matter what we emphasize no matter what we how we live how we act what we say what we do good verse four it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of Sak whose name was Delilah Delilah means feeble means to languish or to be distressed to be brought low I don't think it's a coincidence that in the example of Samson and especially in the way that brother brandham emphasizes it that Delilah takes on the very name of a weaker vessel yeah more feeble he loves a woman in the valley of C whose name was delil and the Lords of the Philistines came up unto her and said unto her entice him wait this is the same story yeah it's happening all over again did we choose our own adventure and end up back at the same spot what happened entice him and see where in his great strength lith and by what means we may prevail against him they weren't they weren't doing a study just find out why he's so strong we're we're kind of interested in seeing if we can't come up with our own Toxin and concoction and see if we can't be strong also but they wanted to take his strength away so they could Prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give the every one of us 1,00 pieces of silver I don't know if we have enough to do the math but that's a lot every one of them will give 1100 pieces of silver we know how D acts so can we guess maybe what her weakness was lust of the flesh maybe it was money now the question at this moment is has Samson learned his lesson has he woke up from the stuper of the lust of the eyes this intoxicating effect that the flesh has upon him the however he wants to say well it's my ADHD and it's my this and my restlessness and this and whatever it is that causes him to engage in it is there a point at which he begins to say I need to change I need to wake up to this weakness I need to wake up to this problem I need to start taking this one punch seriously amen but in Samson we see again how Temptation leads to death how that for BA balam it started as a deed but then it became the standard the unbelling way unb way it starts as a feeling but giving into the feelings we now got to justify what we do when we act on our feelings deed Doctrine then death good crowned in death and Samson we see the example how it starts as a deed then it becomes a lifestyle becomes a doctor and he begins to justify it immediately after getting Boxed In With This Heart Harlot he shows the great power of God and the Bible just says and it came to pass after that he loved a woman Delilah we know that there's passages in judges where many years go by and and and he's he judged for so many years and we don't know all the intervening stories but could it be that by this point we could say that Samson thought I this is me this is who I am I don't need to change but after these men worked on the woman right this is how it works entice him goes to the woman entices him puts thoughts in her mind works on her threatens her tries to encour or TI her they use threats with the first wife we're going to burn your city what was she she was provoked to that amazement she was provoked to that fear with amazement now this one and so maybe it's a pride of life or L however you'd want to say his first wife struggled with it but now with Delilah it's like we're going to pay you a lot of money and she's like okay in in verse six and Delilah said to Samson tell me I pray thee wherein thy great strength lith and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict Thee I know that you know they say that brother Bram tells the story how that they an artist depicted Eve in the beginning as an ugly woman and brother Bram says know she was the most beautiful woman in all the world said that when Adam saw her it left it struck Adam caus this Mark that still reverberates in men today that's how strong it was was and so I suspect that Delilah probably was a beautiful woman and her voice probably wasn't tell me I pray thee he's like just stop talking but I imagine she knew just how to work it and so she comes and you know where's your strength lith that I that that how can you be bound to be weak to be afflicted and in verses seven and 8 what did he say well bind me with seven green ropes and she and the Philistines show up and I don't know if Samson's like wait what what is this what is this I I I mean I you would think that he'd be like 1 2 3 four 5 six seven Philistines wait a minute that's exactly green ropes this is exactly what I told my Delilah but verse 10 because he prevails right he breaks them Delilah said to S behold thou has mocked me and told me lies whoa whoa hold on here honey you're getting on me for lying to you but I think I was pretty smart to lie because guess who was bound by seven green ropes the next day right guess who showed up the next day but no you know she's the victim right you've lied to me I tried to kill you and you lied to me you're an evil man so what does he do he goes back to his father right he leaves but complex is scars he says well you have to use unused new ropes she doesn't the Philistines show up the Bible doesn't tell if this if there's an argument if Samson's like why did you do this to me why did you do this to me and maybe he does but you know what her response is in verse 13 hither to thou has mocked me and told me lies right why did you do this why did you try to get me killed well you've lied to me I was justified in doing it because you're a liar tell me where thou mightest be bound and he said unto her if thou weaves the Seven Locks of my head with the web anybody want to guess what happens somehow someway his Seven Locks get woven with the web and the Philistines are upon him and each time these three times to Samson that should have been the big three right like hey get a clue pal but no he just plows right through the warning and goes right on to the fourth time and now we're we're we're almost done here so this is where it starts getting really really heavy and she said un them how can you say that you love me when your heart's not with me you've mocked me three times the whole picture's Chang you want to know the devil knows how to work on a man right knows how to work in this a with amazement the Tendencies the woman the weaker vessel and I and I'm saying this respectfully and not necessarily calling Out Sisters but the the way and we'll get into this later Satan's designed the woman he's her designer that's why we need the Holy Ghost and this is how the woman the Bible says it you'd be better to be homeless you'd better be living in a homeless shelter on a street corner in the corner of a house than to live in a mansion with the woman who lays sore upon you right the Bible acknowledges the way of a woman with a man and how he can press her press him she can press him he says you've mocked me three times you haven't told me were your great strength fire and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death she wore on him sore she pressed him she urged him how can you say you love me who knows what the Dynamics were but the Bible tells us a lot in just a few verses that he told her after this all his heart and said un her there not come a razor upon my head for I've been a Nazarite un the god from my mother's womb if I be shaven then my strength will go from me and I shall become weak and be like other man and when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the lord of the Philistines saying come up this once for he hath showed me all his heart then the Lords of the Philistines came up under her and brought money in their hand and then this picture she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and caused him to shave off the Seven Locks of his head this is incredible picture she invites Samson to lay in her lap and then has a man come to shave off his hair quite a picture can you paint it yourself can you see how Satan works that even if Samson is going to be an image of the church today if she if he he's a lesson to us as the bride how that if we're not careful we can be invited to fall asleep in the lap of a church yes and a minister come and cut your hair right off wow shave off the Seven Locks of his head and it says and she began to afflict him maybe she began to taunt him provoke him just to see a little bit and his strength went from him and when she realized that Samson however she was agitating him and provoking him she said the Philistines be upon the Samson he woke up out of his sleep and said I will go out as at other times before and shake myself and the Bible says but he didn't know the Lord had departed from him notice the pattern in Samson's life he saw so many miracles he saw so many signs and wonders he saw God respond time after time again he thought you know what let's just keep the show going it's never going to end and he went to act out and didn't know that the bride was gone and the spirit of the Lord had departed from the face of the Earth he went to shake himself as he had before and didn't know that the Lord had departed Samson is a lesson to us of the problem of women the temptation of women the weakness of women it's a lesson that men can learn husbands can learn it's a lesson that young girls can learn it's a lesson that sisters can learn it's a lesson that we can all learn from yeah the woman woed him wore him down and then had a man come and shave him brother bham said and just once more Lord It's a Samson that's left off the principles of God's word and substituted something else and let the organization shave him down and woo him into it you don't have to be Baptist to be an organization you don't have to be Presbyterian to be an organization organization is a spirit denominationalism is a spirit if we somehow Lo ourselves to sleep to say as long as we believe brother brandom's a prophet as long as we quote from the table as long as we say that we're message or we're bride we cannot be denominated that's just simply not true because denominationalism is a spirit whether it be intellectualism emotionalism it's a spirit that will not take the full word of God that's good and organize around just a collection of quotes organize around man-made Creeds and dogmas Sam organization shave him down and woo him into it come come be a part of this come come be a part of this let me say this I I like to pick up on this on Wednesday where I hope that it's you know both genders show up on Wednesday night a woman represents anything designed by Satan to entice you or Lead You astray anything designed by Satan to bind you that's what we learned in the lesson of Samson compromise binding Temptation brother B said the word is God this is in once more the word is God that was given to his church to defeat the world and the devils and the sickness and to cast out Devils no denomination was was give to the church the word was given to the church that's her strength to defeat the world to defeat Devils to defeat sickness to cast out Devils the word is the bride's strength the word is the bride's strength to perform Miracles the word word is the reason why we can lay hands on the sick and they recover the word is why we can cast out demons the word is why limbs can be restored the word is why the dead can be raised from the grave so it's not that we emphasize the Miracles we emphasize The Miracle Worker we emphasize the one who made the promise we emphasize the presence of Jesus Christ in his bride her Revival is him amen amen we give God the glory we recognize to whom it's from and we don't begin to lull ourselves to sleep into the lap of an organiz a to eventually let our seven lock get Shor off thinking that we can just raise up and go to the next meeting that's good and it be the same amen that's her strength but they've cut this away they've cut that away they shaved off this lock and shaved off that lock until she stands shorn today like a Catholic sister Shor off until she's accepted a bunch of man-made Creeds for her Doctrine just exactly what the prophet said she would do and here she stands today humiliated you don't think that's coming to anybody who rejects the word of God you don't think that's coming for the bams and the samsons and the Sauls you don't think it's coming for those who won't take the full word of God what is brother BR showing us a church an organization or a movement is the woman this is the weakness to man this is the weakness to home this is the weakness to churches any church any organization any movement that causes you to dishonor your vow to dishonor headship his head is cut his hair he had a vow and his head is shaved he dishonors his vow he dishonors headship Brothers if you'd come to your instruments it's no surprise where this ends up in verse 21 but the Philistines took him and put out his eyes where his problem was all along it's done in a way to show this this is me I'm emphasizing this it's done in a way to show that this was Samson's problem and in some weird way maybe they shouldn't have fix the problem maybe they should have just tied him up and always tempted him with Philistine women but they put out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with feathers of brass what a phrase and he had grind in the prison house what a sad sad picture to have your eyes plucked out the spiritual condition of Samson the physical representation of where he had been blind all along a physical representation of what he probably should have done in the beginning is to not allow himself always to be driven by the lust of the eyes to realize that women had become a problem in his life and it was maybe so systematic that when we're first introduced to him in chapter 14 his parents say will you ever find a good girl why are you always running after these women finds one that he has to have she's Pleasant to my eyes she fits for me this is the one I want he marries her and immediately in her Youth and maybe in his youth sure in her vulnerability those of her family and her and the people in her City manipulate her and cause her in her fear to get the answer from Samson and this betrayal in Samson's heart left a deep wound because now the woman he wants he's aranged from he can't marry her she's given to a friend of his in his anger he acts out and and the rest of the time we never see him marrying again we just see him visiting a harlot getting in trouble and then we see him visiting Delilah and I don't know what was going on in Samson's mind was it purely lust was he just so taken uh with her where he was just he he was infatuated he was sprung he had to have her and it's this physical connection he just can't quite I don't what we could lay it down on necessarily except that in his heart and in his mind as a man with everything that was happening he couldn't break free Samson the the brother Brandon when he preaches it you know where's your strength on preaches run for your life and he preaches once more and he's calling out to even that as he preaches it to that congregation their Life Tabernacle in shreport which was like the pentec Pinnacle of Pentecostal movement they they didn't they they were he's saying what has happened to you where is your strength gone and it seems like after the first one Samson wake up wake up Samson do you see what's happening and in the end brother Bram says look at this picture of this demoralized church that's lost its hold with God and lost its hold with the word of God now I will say I don't believe the bride will ever get there I believe the bride is secure but Satan can try to lay stumbling blocks and so in Matthew chapter 29 Jesus says if a man lookth upon a woman to lust after and his heart lust after he's committed adultery with him in his heart already it says and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not thy whole body should be cast into hell he repeats something very similar in Matthew chapter 18 If thy eye offend you you know what it means cause you to stumble if your eye places a stumbling block before you or some sort of hindrance in your way the word is root of scandalize if your eye causes you to distrust what you ought to trust deny your eye it's not asking you that you literally pluck out your eye although I've been told the story that at a family Camp many years ago fola there in in Michigan that someone at the altar took a pencil and began to gouge their eye out in a message meeting taking the scripture literally if your eye offends you then pluck out your eye Jesus once again is using maybe this dramatic expression to get our attention if your eye offends you then pluck it out because you'd be better off entering into heaven you'd be better off going to the grave and into the presence of God missing one eye than to constantly defend and keep the eye and lose your Soul if your eye is causing you to distrust what you ought to trust if your eye is causing you to be disloyal if your eye is causing you to be struck with to be fear afraid with amazement if your eye is leading you astray then deny the eye cover it up to pluck it out is to ca to dull that sense that is driving you what a what an interesting Jos between Samson who has his eye plucked out and Jesus telling us to have more control and cover over the mind of our our hearts and brother bam says this Satan tries today to every Christian to pluck out his spiritual sight that he can only follow the intellectual sense of things and not the sense of the Holy Spirit leading him there's your lust of the eyes intellectualism emotionalism it's the same disease it's the same eye problem he's trying to pluck out your spiritual sight so that you'll follow natural sight the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life and not the sense of the Holy Spirit which what sense is that faith and what is its final resting place the word not sensation not not intellectualism not emotionalism but the word of God Amen let's stand
