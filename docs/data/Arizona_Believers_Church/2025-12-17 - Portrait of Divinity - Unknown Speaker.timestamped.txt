[0:00] My title this evening is portrait of
[0:02] divinity.
[0:03] And uh this the picture I chose to use
[0:06] as our title slide here is a face of
[0:09] Christ painted by Rembrandt. The
[0:11] Rembrandt and uh this is one of several
[0:14] that are attributed to him but the only
[0:16] one that they have determined to be for
[0:18] sure from him and not just from his
[0:19] school or someone else trained by him.
[0:22] Uh but it does convey um as I've calling
[0:25] it a portrait of divinity. When you look
[0:26] at this, it just looks like a man. But
[0:28] I'm wanting to kind of bring that
[0:30] contrast to that paradox on the portrait
[0:32] of divinity. We've been looking at the
[0:35] picture of Christ, a portrait of Christ.
[0:37] We preached on a portrait of a perfect
[0:38] man. And that portrait of a perfect man
[0:41] is a portrait of humanity and tonight a
[0:44] portrait of divinity. And we've been
[0:46] looking at it from the standpoint that
[0:48] as the gospels tell the story of Jesus
[0:50] Christ, they're also painting a picture
[0:52] of God. We read in the gospels what
[0:54] Jesus Christ did and his acts and the
[0:56] things that he said and that he taught
[0:58] and we have to view that as he told his
[1:01] disciples when you've seen me you've
[1:02] seen the father and so Christ though he
[1:05] was in the form of man or in the form of
[1:08] a man uh the the painting of Christ in
[1:11] in that way the painting of Christ or
[1:13] this image of Christ we see it in
[1:14] scripture is a picture of a man we see
[1:17] that humanity in him so that portrait of
[1:20] humanity is the image of humanity as
[1:23] painted by the life of Jesus Christ. I I
[1:26] I appreciated the way that brother Ellie
[1:28] Ezer summed it up. In some ways, I felt
[1:29] like he summed it up better than I could
[1:31] have. So, I'm glad I had a chance to
[1:33] hear what he preached Sunday before I
[1:34] preached tonight because I could
[1:36] summarize what I preached the Wednesday
[1:38] night before. Maybe in a way that helped
[1:39] a lot of us who were confused. I had
[1:41] some people asking me questions, "What
[1:42] do you mean a portrait of humanity,
[1:44] walking on water, raising the dead?"
[1:46] Because we know it's God that did that.
[1:48] But we were just looking at it from a
[1:50] different angle to make you think about
[1:51] it. We should look at that as a portrait
[1:53] of humanity because Jesus came to
[1:55] manifest what as brother Eleazar put it
[1:57] what true humanity should be
[1:59] &gt;&gt; and and also what it can be
[2:02] &gt;&gt; uh through the grace of Jesus Christ.
[2:04] And so we this portion of humanity uh
[2:07] that he expressed had this supernatural
[2:09] side to it as it says in Acts chapter
[2:12] 22. Ye men of Israel hear these words
[2:15] Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God.
[2:18] So it uses this language, a man approved
[2:20] of God among you by miracles and wonders
[2:23] and signs. So he's a man that God
[2:25] vindicated himself through and proved
[2:27] through miracles, signs and wonders
[2:29] which God did by him in the midst of you
[2:32] as ye yourselves also know. So this man
[2:35] Christ Jesus was approved of God as God
[2:38] did these miracles by him and the
[2:40] miracles and the supernatural expressed
[2:43] God. But my emphasis was that God, it
[2:45] expressed God's original design for man.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; Not the hybrid man or the fallen man,
[2:51] but man as he originally was. And so as
[2:54] Jesus expressed these things, he
[2:56] expressed what God could do in man. And
[2:58] that's why the disciples did the same
[3:00] works that Christ did.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; And the question we had asked last week
[3:04] is that if miracles expressed uh what
[3:07] humanity is capable of, then what is the
[3:09] divine portrait?
[3:11] What is the portrait of divinity?
[3:14] In Philippians chapter 2 verse 5, read
[3:17] verses five and six as we uh lean into
[3:22] this with all our might. This to me I'm
[3:23] excited about the subject matter tonight
[3:25] just as we were last week but it's very
[3:27] simple very straightforward. He says let
[3:29] this mind be in you which was also in
[3:31] Christ Jesus. So let this mind be in
[3:34] you. Allow it. Let it come to
[3:35] preeminence. And it's a mind that Christ
[3:37] had. Now remember Christ uh uh think of
[3:41] everything that Christ is uh and
[3:43] everything we think about Christ and
[3:44] he's saying we need to have that mind in
[3:46] us who being in the form of God thought
[3:48] it not robbery to be equal with God.
[3:51] &gt;&gt; I love how brother Brandham interprets
[3:52] the scripture that he he looked at it as
[3:54] not something banned or barred or
[3:56] illegal or unlawful but that it was
[3:59] something that he uh was given the
[4:01] privilege to enjoy this equality. A and
[4:04] and the kind of the the double meaning
[4:05] to it is it wasn't the then something
[4:07] just easily grasped that it wasn't just
[4:10] uh being uh equal with God is not
[4:13] something you just attained to on a
[4:14] whim. It was something that he himself
[4:17] submitted to and yielded to. And we know
[4:20] that Jesus Christ reveals the mystery of
[4:22] God or the full mystery of God. Jesus
[4:24] Christ Christ is the mystery of God
[4:26] revealed and there's this uh there's a
[4:29] revelation of God and his mystery in
[4:31] Christ. And so his manifestation, what
[4:34] he did was a full expression of God. And
[4:37] I and I'm I'm drawing from many
[4:39] scriptures that we've been reading
[4:40] recently how that he was this image of
[4:43] God and the likeness of God, the
[4:44] fullness of the Godhead bodily was in
[4:46] him. And so believing that and knowing
[4:49] the scriptures and the things that Jesus
[4:51] accomplished and this prophecy
[4:53] surrounding his life, it's easy to
[4:54] highlight how Jesus Christ was different
[4:57] than man.
[4:58] &gt;&gt; And we can look at it and say, "Well, he
[5:00] knew no sin and this and that." We could
[5:02] talk about the ways that he was
[5:03] different uh and we could see the image
[5:05] of God, the likeness of God, the the the
[5:07] word, the deity in flesh. And so we we
[5:10] know he's the son of God. We know that
[5:12] uh he was uh uh he was sinless. So
[5:15] there's a lot of things and he walked on
[5:17] water and did all the things. So we see
[5:18] him as being very different. So it's
[5:20] easy to identify how he was different
[5:22] than man. In Matthew 1:18, it says, "Now
[5:25] the birth of Jesus Christ was on this
[5:27] wise." And and it's said this way
[5:29] because the birth of Jesus was this way.
[5:32] In other words, this is a departure from
[5:34] how every everybody else has come so
[5:36] far. When as his mother was Mary was a
[5:38] spouse to Joseph before they came
[5:40] together, before there was the union,
[5:42] before there was the mixing of
[5:43] themselves together, she was found with
[5:45] child of the Holy Ghost.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; If you think about Jesus, his conception
[5:51] and his resurrection are unlike any any
[5:53] man's. Yeah,
[5:55] &gt;&gt; that he was conceived uh differently
[5:57] than any man had been before. I I'm
[6:00] including this uh painting by the Korean
[6:02] Christian artist and he this is the
[6:03] enunciation uh to Mary that the child
[6:06] will be conceived of you will be of the
[6:08] Holy Ghost and and I'm just going to use
[6:10] these representations so he could think
[6:12] more humanity uh and more common than
[6:15] maybe we do sometimes. But his
[6:17] conception was different than any other
[6:19] conception
[6:21] &gt;&gt; different than Mary's. Mary wasn't
[6:22] immaculately conceived. that that's just
[6:24] a Catholic fiction. But we know that
[6:27] Christ was conceived in Mary of no part
[6:30] of Joseph or Mary. It was a a conception
[6:33] by God alone unlike any other man's. And
[6:36] his resurrection was different.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; Others had been raised from the dead.
[6:39] But Christ, God gave him power to raise
[6:42] himself back up again. This commandment
[6:44] he received from his father to never die
[6:46] again.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; And so he was born unlike or conceived
[6:51] by unlike any other man. But then in his
[6:53] birth, he was born just like you or I.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; Born of a woman and maybe born in a more
[6:59] uncommon way because now he's born out
[7:01] of a cave, out of the side of a hill.
[7:03] He's born in a manger.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; And a very common maybe even a uncommon
[7:08] poor birth, but just like any other man.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; It says in verse seven, and I and again
[7:14] I think we were able to look at well
[7:15] this virgin birth and he lived sinless
[7:17] and he rose from the grave. There's a
[7:18] lot of things about him we know are
[7:20] different than man. But it says he made
[7:21] himself of no reputation. Verse 7, and
[7:24] took upon him the form of a servant and
[7:26] was made in the likeness of men.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; So we see that Jesus Christ now
[7:31] represents he was in the form of God and
[7:34] he was equal with God. But now we see
[7:36] this equality with man. This likeness of
[7:38] men and being found in fashion as a man,
[7:40] he humbled himself and became obedient
[7:43] unto death, even the death of the cross.
[7:46] To me, it's just the language is so
[7:48] profound and so poetic that he was in
[7:51] the form of God. And being in the form
[7:53] of God, he thought it not robbery to be
[7:54] equal with God. And so, in this godly
[7:58] godly form, he made himself of no
[8:00] reputation. Took upon himself the form
[8:02] of a servant. So, kind of begin to
[8:03] notice how he how this is expressed.
[8:06] Being in the likeness of man, he he
[8:07] humbled himself, became obedient unto
[8:09] death. And so, there is things that
[8:11] Jesus Christ did that we do. Here we see
[8:15] a portrayal and I tried to enlarge the
[8:17] image so you could see it. So it might
[8:18] have lost uh some of its crispness in
[8:21] and the way that it's being enlarged
[8:22] here for you to see. But he was baptized
[8:24] in water just like you or I are baptized
[8:26] in water. Went to the water as a man to
[8:28] be baptized. We see him here in the
[8:30] wilderness being tempted of the devil a
[8:33] as a man. He's being tempted. He
[8:35] hungered. He was tired. He was worn. And
[8:36] he's being tempted. We are tempted in
[8:39] the same way that he is tempt was
[8:40] tempted. Then we see him when they say,
[8:42] "Suffer the little children to come unto
[8:44] me." A and children were were drawn to
[8:47] him. And others were drawn to him. The
[8:48] the unfortunate, the the the weak, uh
[8:51] the poor, they were drawn to him. He had
[8:53] a personality maybe that drew some to
[8:54] him. He was approachable.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; And so in each one of these things, we
[8:59] could see a portrayal of Christ. Even as
[9:00] it says, he was obedient unto death.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Even the death of the cross.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; He died. He died like a man would die.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; He was crucified and died. It says even
[9:11] the death of a cross maybe was an
[9:12] uncommon death but it was that that
[9:14] horrible death of a criminal.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; These are all things that man man uh
[9:18] could have great personalities. Man
[9:20] could be baptized. Uh man is born of a
[9:22] woman. Man could die. He could be hung
[9:24] on a cross. And so there's all these
[9:25] different ways that Christ is like man.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; And I mentioned it before. One of the
[9:31] deep mysteries of Jesus Christ is what
[9:33] he had in common with man, not what made
[9:35] him different.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like that to me is where the
[9:37] depths of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[9:39] reside. Because when Paul says he took
[9:42] upon himself a a form of a servant, he
[9:45] emphasizes humility, submission, and
[9:47] obedience and death as the mind of
[9:50] Christ to have.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; Let this mind be in you that was in
[9:54] Christ Jesus.
[9:55] this mind where though he was equal with
[9:57] God and though he was in the form of
[9:59] God, he we're challenged to take upon
[10:01] ourselves this humility, this obedience
[10:03] and even to have this submission to
[10:06] death as Christ did.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I would say that the uh loneliness
[10:11] of mind and the uh no reputation, the
[10:14] form of a servant, the humility, the
[10:17] obedience, even the obedience to death,
[10:19] these are certain characteristics that
[10:20] we might attribute to being human
[10:24] &gt;&gt; or weakness, but yet they're divine.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; In 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse one,
[10:30] and I know you're saying, "Oh, here he
[10:31] goes again. He's He's calling it
[10:33] divinity now. And I'm starting to feel a
[10:36] little different because when he walked
[10:37] on water, that was divine. But when he
[10:39] wept, that was human.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not saying it wasn't.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; I'm just wanting you to look at it a
[10:44] little bit differently because there's
[10:46] things that we look at and say, "Oh,
[10:47] that's divine. That's divine." But I
[10:49] think if we looked at as that's way
[10:51] that's what you're supposed to be in
[10:52] flesh,
[10:54] &gt;&gt; that that's the that's the the
[10:55] restoration of the uh uh that's the new
[10:57] race. That's new creatures in Christ
[10:59] Jesus. that we're not going to delay and
[11:01] put this off until until the millennium
[11:03] or in the eighth day, but we're going to
[11:04] say, "No, this is Jesus Christ proved.
[11:06] This is what humanity can do."
[11:09] &gt;&gt; And then we look at this the human part
[11:11] and because we say, "Well, that was a
[11:13] man that wept." Then we don't value it
[11:15] like we should,
[11:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Well, he was humble like a man and he
[11:18] was a servant as a man. And we're think,
[11:20] no, we want to be godlike, not
[11:22] humanlike. But I'm wanting to turn it
[11:24] around and say, "No, this is divinity."
[11:26] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 10:1. Now I Paul
[11:29] myself beseech you by the meekness and
[11:32] gentleness of Christ
[11:34] who in presence among you but being
[11:37] absent and bold toward you by the
[11:39] meekness and gentleness of Christ. He's
[11:42] beseeching them by a disposition a
[11:45] character or an image or quality of
[11:48] Christ. And he says it's meekness and
[11:49] gentleness this clemency this mildness
[11:52] fairness. Actually, the word is in and
[11:54] the and the gentleness is sweet
[11:57] reasonleness.
[11:58] And I know that's different than the the
[12:00] John Wayne Jesus we really want, but
[12:02] it's this sweet reasonleness of Christ
[12:05] &gt;&gt; that he it evokes these ideas of
[12:07] moderation and patience and sincerity
[12:09] and this equity where he wasn't
[12:11] overbearing.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; He wasn't rude and obtuse. He had this
[12:15] sweet reasonleness about him. Amen.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; And he's not saying the gentleness of of
[12:22] a man who was dimmutive in stature and
[12:24] that people picked on and he developed a
[12:26] complex. But this is a character of
[12:28] Christ.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; It's the opposite of selfishness.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; Opposite of being self-interested,
[12:35] the opposite of self-entitlement. That's
[12:37] exactly what Paul is emphasizing. Let
[12:38] this mind be in you. That though he was
[12:40] equal with God, he didn't think he was
[12:43] self-entitled to anything. He he made
[12:45] himself of no reputation. Took the form
[12:47] of a servant, humbled himself, became
[12:49] obedient unto death. There was no
[12:50] preoccupation with self.
[12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham even taught us that he
[12:55] didn't use his power. He wasn't using
[12:58] his power for himself. He wasn't even
[12:59] using power. He was using the word of
[13:01] God.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; And so these are attributes that are not
[13:06] quickly or I would say at least not
[13:07] easily associated with God. Yet Christ
[13:10] is displaying them.
[13:13] So they have to be of God.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; This portrait of divinity
[13:19] is in humility, gentleness, meekness.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; It is God hiding himself in simplicity.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; That we would with carnal eyes look at
[13:28] this and say that just looks like any
[13:30] other man. Amen.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; It is said that uh Rembrandt when he
[13:32] painted this he used a neighbor of his
[13:35] uh that was a a Jew and Rembrandt
[13:38] himself living in the Jewish community
[13:39] that they believe this is a picture used
[13:41] of a a Jewish uh individual his neighbor
[13:45] and he would HAVE LOOKED JUST LIKE A
[13:46] COMMON MAN ORDINARY MAN. But it's in
[13:48] this in what we might say is common in
[13:51] that SIMPLICITY THAT'S WHERE GOD HIDES
[13:52] HIMSELF. God hides himself in simplicity
[13:56] and we say oh the walking on water
[13:57] THAT'S GOD. WELL, GOD WAS NOT hid in
[13:59] that,
[14:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[14:00] &gt;&gt; He was hid in the meekness.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; He was hid in the gentleness. He's hid
[14:04] in the sweet reasonleness. He's hid in
[14:06] that in the patience,
[14:08] &gt;&gt; and that moderation.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; He was, as you look at this picture, he
[14:12] was a man of sorrows.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he was acquainted with
[14:15] grief. He humbled himself. He was
[14:18] abased.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; It describes a side of God that we often
[14:21] overlook.
[14:24] that Christ being a man of sorrows, if
[14:26] he expressed that when you've seen me,
[14:27] you've seen the father. If he perfectly
[14:29] expressed God, HE'S NOT SHOWING US
[14:31] SOMETHING, OH, THAT'S NOT GOD. THIS IS
[14:33] SOMEHOW GOD ALLOWING A PART OF HIMSELF
[14:35] that we would never consider before to
[14:37] be expressed perfectly.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; It's that side that maybe we recoil from
[14:42] that God's wanting us to be drawn to
[14:44] &gt;&gt; that we would see a portrait like this
[14:46] and say, "Lord, make me like that."
[14:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; I I I it's easy for me to say, "Lord, I
[14:51] want to multiply bread. I WANT TO
[14:53] MULTIPLY FISH. I WANT TO WALK ON WATER.
[14:54] I want to raise the dead. I want to
[14:56] curse Christmas trees. ALL THESE THINGS
[14:57] THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO. SAID, "NO,
[14:59] IT'S NOT IN THAT. THAT'S HUMANITY." BUT
[15:01] WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO HAVE THIS
[15:03] NATURE of Christ,
[15:05] &gt;&gt; this humility, this meekness.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; Just there's a tremendous uh atmosphere
[15:12] here tonight. Just it's the dynamics are
[15:14] just incredible. And so please just
[15:17] focus on on how I want to say this that
[15:20] we know a person by their actions. So we
[15:24] see somebody and they do something and
[15:25] we could even say well because this
[15:27] person does this if they if they cut up
[15:29] meat we say they're a butcher. If they
[15:31] paint walls we say they're a painter. So
[15:33] persons known by their actions. What we
[15:35] say and what we do uh kind of says
[15:38] something about who we are. But in order
[15:40] to really know the person, you you you
[15:43] need to the full picture requires a
[15:45] consideration of motive and objective.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; That there's more to the picture than
[15:51] just the actions. As the Bible says, he
[15:53] made known his ways unto Moses and his
[15:55] acts to the children of Israel. In other
[15:57] words, Moses had a deeper understanding
[15:58] of what God was doing. Whereas Israel
[16:00] saw what he had done.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[16:03] &gt;&gt; God did many miracles by Jesus. That's
[16:06] God's power.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; That's the divine. But he expressed
[16:10] himself in other ways.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to use some examples in the
[16:13] scripture. Hopefully, this does cause
[16:15] you to think uh spiritually and deeply.
[16:18] In Exodus 15:3, the Lord is a man of
[16:21] war. The Lord is his name. And all the
[16:23] warriors said, "Amen." Right? The Lord
[16:26] is a man of war.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; The Bible describes what a man of war
[16:30] will do in Isaiah 42:13. The Lord shall
[16:32] go forth as a mighty man. He shall stir
[16:34] up jealousy like a man of war.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He shall cry y warar he roar. He
[16:39] shall prevail against his enemies. So
[16:42] God is described as a man of war. We can
[16:46] say that God acts and does things that
[16:49] appear very warlike. We say his going
[16:51] forth is as a mighty man. So he goes
[16:52] forth and the consequences ARE HE'S LIKE
[16:54] A WARRIOR. HE STIRS UP JEALOUSY. HE
[16:56] CRIES. He roars. He prevails against his
[16:58] enemies. And we see his actions AND WE
[17:00] SAY GOD IS A MAN OF WAR.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT IS it that God is expressing
[17:05] through his warfare? In other words, not
[17:08] just waring and fighting, but what was
[17:10] his objective?
[17:12] &gt;&gt; What's his motive to that?
[17:14] &gt;&gt; When God is acting, WHAT WHAT DRIVES HIM
[17:16] TO ACT? IS HE A man of war? That means
[17:19] he's impatient and impetuous and always
[17:21] flying off the handle and and
[17:22] bloodthirsty. No.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in 1 John 4:8 and verse
[17:28] 16, "He that loveth not God," or excuse
[17:31] me, he that loveth not knoweth not God,
[17:33] for God is love. Amen.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; God is a man of war
[17:38] &gt;&gt; and God is love
[17:40] &gt;&gt; and those two are not incompatible.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, I'll say now in
[17:45] case we don't express it this way later,
[17:47] it's his love that causes them to war.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; See, some people war because they're
[17:52] impatient.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE FIGHT BECAUSE OF PRIDE.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; Some do it for all sorts of means and
[17:57] different gains. But he's a man of war.
[17:59] Why? You cannot disassociate his act OF
[18:02] WARFARE FROM THIS attribute of love.
[18:04] Amen.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; Verse 16 says, "And we have known and
[18:07] believed the love that God hath to us.
[18:08] God is love." So it's not just something
[18:10] that he accidentally said. He comes back
[18:12] and says, "God is love. And he that
[18:14] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God
[18:16] in him."
[18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; So we may know a person by their
[18:22] actions. God's actions made him known as
[18:25] a man of war. But in in him in his
[18:28] essential characteristics, God is love.
[18:32] Think of how this love is made known in
[18:34] Isaiah 38:17. Behold, for peace I had
[18:37] great bitterness, but thou, he's
[18:38] speaking of the Lord, thou hast in love
[18:41] to my soul delivered it from the pit of
[18:44] corruption, for thou hast cast all my
[18:46] sins behind thy back.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; What caused God to do that? God hates
[18:50] sin.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; He hates iniquity. The Bible says he he
[18:54] does. These are things that God detests,
[18:56] God despises, and God hates. SO THEN
[18:58] WHAT WOULD CAUSE HIM TO DELIVER US? His
[19:00] love did.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; His love FOR OUR SOULS CAUSED him to
[19:03] deliver us. It caused him TO REDEEM US,
[19:05] TO JUSTIFY US. GOD IN LOVE did that.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS IN LOVE HAVING
[19:09] PREDESTINATED us into adoption.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; So it's this attribute of love that
[19:14] caused God to act.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; John 15 12 to 14. This is my commandment
[19:19] that ye love one another
[19:21] &gt;&gt; as I have loved you.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; So this is not uh this is not a a filio
[19:26] love. This is not a love of human
[19:28] emotion. This is a love of a higher
[19:29] intelligence. This is a love with
[19:31] purpose. So love one another as Christ
[19:34] has loved. If Christ loved, it was a
[19:35] god-like love. It was a love of the
[19:37] divine. Now he's asking us as humans to
[19:40] love.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; And that love is to be a portrait not of
[19:43] humanity but of divinity.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; He says, "Greater love hath no man than
[19:47] this that a man laid down his life for
[19:49] his friends."
[19:50] &gt;&gt; What was this UH SACRIFICE THAT JESUS
[19:52] MADE? WELL, it was a greater love.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a human love. It wasn't an
[19:57] irrational love. It wasn't a love of
[19:59] jealousy. It wasn't a love, well, IF I
[20:00] CAN'T HAVE YOU, I JUST WANT TO DIE. THIS
[20:02] WAS A LOVE of intelligence.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Greater love hath no man than this, that
[20:06] he laid down his life for his friends.
[20:08] You are my friends if you do whatsoever
[20:10] I command you.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; And what did he command us to do? To
[20:13] love like he did.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; He's calling us to a self-sacrificing
[20:18] love. Not that we would have to shed our
[20:21] blood for the forgiveness of sins or for
[20:23] for redemption's sake, but we ought to
[20:25] have this kind of mind that was in
[20:27] Christ Jesus who humbled himself.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; Became obedient. This meekness and
[20:32] gentleness of Christ. This lack of
[20:34] selfishness and self-entitlement. We
[20:37] think, well, GOD OWNS A CATTLE ON A
[20:39] THOUSAND HILLS AND GOD SHOULD BE
[20:40] WORSHIPED ALONE AND GOD IS MIGHTY AND
[20:42] GOD DEMANDS JUSTICE AND GOD DEMANDS
[20:44] HOLINESS AND GOD DEMANDS CONSTANT
[20:46] WORSHIP. YEAH, THAT'S THAT'S THIS IMAGE
[20:48] OF GOD that is true and accurate. But
[20:49] there's this other side of God
[20:53] &gt;&gt; that that we have to have as well.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; In John 17,
[20:58] he said, "And for their sakes I sanctify
[21:00] myself that they also might be
[21:02] sanctified through the truth."
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; He did this in love for your soul.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; He did this for your sake.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; This is this is him as a man. He had
[21:13] certain rights,
[21:14] &gt;&gt; right? As a man, he had certain
[21:15] abilities. As a man, he could have
[21:18] enjoyed. HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN. YOU SAY,
[21:19] "WELL, HE WAS WITHOUT SIN. GOD MADE IT
[21:21] TO WHERE HE COULDN'T SIN." JESUS was
[21:22] tempted in every point manner like as we
[21:24] were on on the basis that if he wanted
[21:27] to, HE COULD HAVE CHOSE TO DO CERTAIN
[21:29] THINGS. BUT HE SANCTIFIED HIMSELF.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; For other's sake.
[21:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he had a right to
[21:34] a wife. He had a right to a home. He had
[21:36] a right to the pleasures of life like we
[21:38] have the comforts of life at least. But
[21:41] he was sanctifying himself because he
[21:42] was training 12 men that would stir the
[21:44] world with the gospel.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; There's this. You say, "Well, that was
[21:48] the man Christ Jesus. That was God."
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; This is This is a portrait of divinity.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; I sanctify myself.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Greater love hath no man than this than
[21:59] he laid down a life for his friends.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; This is the this attribute of God, this
[22:05] love of God. You say, "Well, he's a man
[22:08] of war. That's his actions." But what's
[22:09] his motive?
[22:12] What's being expressed?
[22:15] I could say Jesus displayed
[22:18] and and emphasized certain attributes
[22:21] not to be more human or more relatable,
[22:23] but actually to show he's truly divine.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; And some of the parables that he used in
[22:28] the parable of the good Samaritan,
[22:31] that story is told not so that we begin
[22:33] to relate more to humanity, but to see a
[22:35] side of God that we wouldn't consider.
[22:40] I I want you to I I'm wanting to
[22:42] challenge you a little bit. We say, "Who
[22:44] is your neighbor?" And we begin to
[22:45] think, "Oh, well, there's a Samaritan,
[22:46] there's Jews, and there's priests, and
[22:48] this is human relationships, and this is
[22:50] politics." But he's wanting you to see a
[22:52] picture of God in this.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he tells the story of a
[22:56] prodical son, it's not a story to begin
[22:59] to connect more with humanity and a dad
[23:01] and a son and a good son and a bad son
[23:03] and the son that backslides, but he's
[23:05] wanting to draw a picture and emphasize
[23:07] certain attributes so we could truly see
[23:08] a better picture of the divine.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; In Matthew 5:es 2 to2,
[23:16] this sermon, it's from the sermon on the
[23:18] mount. These things that we're beginning
[23:19] to read are the biatitudes.
[23:22] And uh a lot of us have B attitudes.
[23:24] That means it's not quite an A, right?
[23:27] But that's what we're talking about. B
[23:28] attitudes, blessedness. And maybe you're
[23:30] happy with a B, but we want A+
[23:33] attitudes, right?
[23:34] &gt;&gt; It says, "And he opened his mouth and
[23:36] taught them, saying, he says, if you
[23:38] love me, you'll keep my commandments.
[23:39] You're my friends if you do what I
[23:40] command." So here's his commandments.
[23:42] Blessed are the poor in spirit, for
[23:44] theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Think
[23:47] of this. Blessed are they that mourn,
[23:49] for they shall be comforted.
[23:51] Think of these characteristics. Poor in
[23:52] spirit mourn. Blessed are the meek, for
[23:54] they shall inherit the earth. Blessed
[23:56] are they which do hunger and thirst
[23:58] after righteousness, for they shall be
[24:00] filled. Blessed are the merciful, for
[24:02] they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the
[24:04] pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[24:06] Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
[24:08] shall be called the children of God.
[24:10] Blessed are they which are persecuted
[24:12] for righteousness sake, for theirs is
[24:14] the kingdom of heaven.
[24:17] Blessed are they which are blessed are
[24:21] ye when men shall revile you and
[24:22] persecute and shall say all manner of
[24:25] evil against you falsely for my sake.
[24:28] Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[24:30] is your reward in heaven for so
[24:33] persecuted they the prophets which were
[24:34] before you.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; As I just noted here, these biatitudes
[24:38] portray the divine heart.
[24:41] We read this, we're immediately drawn to
[24:43] poor in spirit, meek, mourning,
[24:45] persecuted. And we think of these
[24:47] people. We begin to get in our minds
[24:49] peacemakers and and and merciful. And we
[24:52] have a picture of a kind of a a human a
[24:55] stripped of power and a human that is
[24:58] humble and a human that's this and a
[24:59] human that's poor and a human IN RAGS.
[25:01] BUT HE'S ACTUALLY portraying something
[25:03] divine. As the Korean artist uh
[25:06] represented here, here's him on the
[25:07] sermon of the mount teaching these
[25:08] biatitudes. And this teaching, what he's
[25:11] teaching here, I hope that I can somehow
[25:13] convey this to you. He's teaching this
[25:16] not to make us human,
[25:19] &gt;&gt; but to cultivate divine attributes.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; These are not the virtues of human
[25:23] intelligence. That's
[25:24] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS IS OF A DIVINED MIND OF CHRIST.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; BLESSED ARE THE POOR IN SPIRIT. BLESSED
[25:30] ARE THEY THAT MOURN. BLESSED ARE THE
[25:31] MEEK. BLESSED are the merciful. Blessed
[25:33] are the PURE IN HEART. BLESSED are the
[25:34] peacemakers. Blessed are those that are
[25:36] persecuted FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS. BLESSED
[25:37] ARE THOSE THAT HUNGER AND thirst for
[25:38] righteousness. WHAT IS IT THAT GOD LONGS
[25:40] FOR? WHAT IS IT GOD WANTS?
[25:41] RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; In each one of these things, we see a
[25:45] picture of the divine.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; This is the This is uh he's emphasizing
[25:53] things that we might attribute to
[25:55] humanity and oh, a good person and a
[25:57] humble person, a meek person, but this
[25:58] is the mind of Christ.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:08] as he's teaching this sermon
[26:12] and and I I'm wanting you to think about
[26:13] these these biatitudes.
[26:17] Blessed are the poor in spirit and those
[26:18] that mourn. Some religions and even I'd
[26:20] say Christian Christian religions or
[26:22] denominations teach to perform acts of
[26:25] service and acts of humility and
[26:27] emphasize these attributes. A and they
[26:30] suppose that the blessedness of the
[26:32] being poor in spirit is to be born of
[26:33] the world. We're human. We're flesh. And
[26:36] therefore, therefore, we ought to carry
[26:38] ourselves in as human beings. This is
[26:40] the way we conduct ourselves. But Jesus
[26:42] is actually teaching the opposite.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "Blessed are the poor in
[26:46] spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
[26:47] heaven." The blessedness is not that
[26:49] they're born from the world, but they're
[26:50] born from above.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; Notice how he's connecting this divine
[26:55] side to this human, what we might think
[26:57] to BE A HUMAN EXPRESSION. HE'S NOT
[26:59] SAYING, "OH, BLESSED ARE THE POOR IN
[27:00] SPIRIT BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONES that are
[27:02] truly human." He's saying you are the
[27:03] ones that are truly divine. Yours is the
[27:05] kingdom of heaven.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; Some teach that the taking of the cross
[27:10] is the acceptance of misery a as the
[27:13] state of being human. That we have to
[27:15] take up this cross and we have to bear
[27:17] this cross. And and there's this idea
[27:19] that as humans we we have to bear this
[27:21] suffering. We have to bear this
[27:22] reproach. But Jesus is opposing the
[27:24] notion because in ACCEPTING THE CROSS,
[27:27] HE'S ACTUALLY PROTESTING HUMANITY.
[27:30] that he's NOT DOING IT TO EXPRESS HIS
[27:32] HUMANITY. HE'S DOING IT TO EXPRESS THAT
[27:35] HE'S CONQUERED THE BASENESS of humanity.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Humanity doesn't run to the cross.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; HUMANITY DOESN'T EMBRACE THE CROSS.
[27:43] THERE'S SOME THAT PREACH THE CROSS AND
[27:45] WE EMBRACE IT THEN THROUGH THIS
[27:46] DEBASEMENT. WE DEBASE IT AS THE CATHOLIC
[27:49] CHURCH WOULD HAVE YOU TO DO TO WALK ON
[27:50] YOUR KNEES UNTIL THEY'RE BLOODY TO BEAR
[27:52] THESE THINGS. AND IT'S ALL THIS OUTWARD
[27:53] EXPRESSION. BUT REMEMBER, SOMEONE COULD
[27:55] BE KNOWN BY THEIR ACTS. BUT THE FULL
[27:57] PICTURE IS ONLY UNDERSTOOD BY WHAT WAS
[27:59] BEING EXPRESSED THROUGH THOSE ACTS.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Remember that revelation comes from
[28:03] within, not without.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; This was a this was the opposition to
[28:08] humanity. Amen.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Notice how it says in Hebrews 12:es 1:3,
[28:13] "Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed
[28:15] about with so great a cloud of
[28:17] witnesses, let us lay aside every
[28:19] weight,
[28:21] &gt;&gt; and the sin which doth so easily beset
[28:23] us,
[28:24] &gt;&gt; and let us run with patience the race
[28:25] that is set before us."
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Looking unto Jesus, the author and
[28:29] finisher of our faith,
[28:32] who for the joy that was set before him,
[28:35] endured the cross. This is the cross
[28:38] isn't h well I got to go to the in-laws
[28:40] for Christmas. The cross is death.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Who for the joy that was set before him
[28:46] endured the cross, despising the shame,
[28:47] and is set down at the right hand of the
[28:49] throne of God. FOR CONSIDER HIM THAT
[28:50] ENDURED SUCH CONTRADICTION of sinners
[28:52] against himself, lest you be wearied and
[28:54] faint in your minds.
[28:56] This is a call to divinity, not
[28:58] humanity.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; We might think, well, a human can die, a
[29:01] human could take the cross, a human
[29:03] could do these things. But Jesus uh was
[29:05] was not merely submitting to pain. He
[29:08] was resisting pain.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T JUST ACCEPTING IT. SOMETIMES
[29:12] WE JUST HAVE THIS ATTITUDE. Bad things
[29:13] are going to happen. Just accept it.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; You just have to get through it. You
[29:16] just have to WEATHER IT. YOU JUST HAVE
[29:18] TO ACCEPT IT. JESUS WAS NOT ACCEPTING
[29:20] IT. He was resisting it.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; These things are called to divinity, not
[29:27] humanity.
[29:29] He didn't just merely I I wrote here
[29:31] Jesus did not me merely submit to death.
[29:34] He pursued joy.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Notice he didn't say he became obedient
[29:39] to death and he died. It said because of
[29:41] what was before him
[29:42] &gt;&gt; he endured.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; That changes everything.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; That [laughter] that that has a
[29:47] different feeling to it. We should be
[29:49] willing to bear the cross as we could
[29:51] read in verses 11 and 12. Blessed are
[29:52] you who are uh reviled against and
[29:54] persecuted and they say all manner of
[29:56] evil against YOU AND BUT REJOICE FOR
[29:58] GREAT IS YOUR REWARD in heaven.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus is saying. Jesus who
[30:02] for the joy which was set before him,
[30:03] we're willing to bear the present cross
[30:05] for the future reward and liberty that's
[30:07] coming.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; So when we are asked TO BEAR PAIN AND TO
[30:11] BEAR IT PATIENTLY AND TO SUFFER, IT'S
[30:13] NOT JUST IT'S NOT JUST SUBMITTING TO
[30:15] PAIN, BUT WE'RE AND WE'RE NOT JUST
[30:16] ACCEPTING LOSS AND SUB ACCEPTING
[30:19] HUMILIATION and pain. Humans do that.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; But it's the pursuit of joy that's
[30:23] divine.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT OF HUMANS THAT SUFFER
[30:26] PERSECUTION. THERE'S A LOT OF HUMANS
[30:28] THAT SUFFER PHYSICAL AFFLICTION AND
[30:30] SICKNESS AND LOSS. AND THAT'S WHAT
[30:32] HUMANS CAN DO. BUT IT'S ONLY THE
[30:34] CHRISTIAN WHO FOR THE JOY WHICH IS SET
[30:36] BEFORE HIM
[30:37] &gt;&gt; CAN HAVE THIS MIND LIKE CHRIST, THAT'S
[30:38] THE DIVINE MIND.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; I I think of it this way too. It it kept
[30:44] coming to me over and over again and I
[30:46] don't know if I'll minister on it on
[30:48] Sunday, BUT WHEN JESUS CHRIST DIED and
[30:51] gave up the ghost, the proclamation of
[30:53] the soldier nearby was truly this was
[30:55] the son of God.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; And what would have been the final seal
[31:00] of truly this man was not the son OF
[31:02] GOD. THROUGH THAT act of dying,
[31:05] divinity was expressed. THAT'S RIGHT.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; THE PROCLAMATION BY THIS ONE WHO WASN'T
[31:10] SOLELY BY DOCTRINE, SOLELY BY SUSPICION
[31:12] AND TRADITION AND WASN'T THE ONE WHO
[31:14] SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH, BUT HE'S A HE'S
[31:16] A MAYBE AN UNBIASED WITNESS. I know
[31:18] maybe I'm adding a lot to this and feel
[31:19] free to fill up my inbox with all your
[31:21] COMMENTS LATER, BUT HE'S SAYING SAID,
[31:23] "SURELY THIS WAS THE SON OF GOD." IN
[31:26] OTHER WORDS, GOD SHOWED HIMSELF THROUGH
[31:28] WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE FINAL SEAL of
[31:31] apostasy.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. The manner in which he died proves
[31:34] to me that he could not have been who he
[31:36] said he was.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; And yet when that image struck the eye
[31:40] of the Roman soldier said truly this was
[31:43] &gt;&gt; divine.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm hoping that you can really
[31:48] grab a hold of this to realize there's a
[31:49] lot of things that are human. Pain,
[31:51] suffering, mourning, loss, and all those
[31:52] things that humans endure and humans do.
[31:55] But we're not just merely going through
[31:56] these human things. There's another side
[31:58] of it.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; We live in a world that's waring. We say
[32:02] God is a man of war, but amid warfare,
[32:04] he says, "Blessed are the peacemakers."
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Those who have a spirit of peace.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; In other words, a spirit, a waring
[32:11] spirit doesn't make you fit for war.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO FIGHT. WE GOT A NEW BATTLE.
[32:16] AND SOMETIMES, I THINK THAT'S JUST
[32:17] EXACTLY HOW WE project it. SOMEBODY'S
[32:19] GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME. WE JUST YOU
[32:21] JUST NEED TO TAKE THE SWORD OF GOD'S
[32:22] WORD AND GO TO WHACKING THE DEVIL'S HEAD
[32:23] OFF. AND WE'RE KIND OF LIKE, YEAH, GIVE
[32:26] ME THE SWORD. WHERE'S HIS HEAD?
[32:29] And we and it's just we're beating the
[32:30] air. IT'S THIS IMAGINARY WORK UP. GOT TO
[32:32] GET EXCITED AND WE'RE GOING TO BEAT THE
[32:34] DEVIL UP, RIGHT? I THINK I'VE SAID IT
[32:35] BEFORE. WE COULD GET SO AMPED UP. WE
[32:37] wish we could just MEET HIM IN THE
[32:38] PARKING LOT.
[32:40] But what is it going to take to overcome
[32:41] him? Faith.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; And what does faith do?
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Just it's burly. Knows where it stands.
[32:49] Doesn't have to scout. Shout. Scout too.
[32:51] Doesn't have to scout either. Doesn't
[32:53] have to shout or scream or for the sake
[32:55] of brevity. Scout.
[32:58] Scout. What is it? So what? So, there's
[33:00] a way that you can hold yourself strong
[33:02] with faith.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; I know I've used this example before.
[33:07] The guy who's talking a lot of trash and
[33:09] kicks his slippers off and takes his
[33:10] shirt off and SAYS, "COME ON, COME AT
[33:11] ME. I'M A MAN." You know, take a shot.
[33:14] He's probably not going to swing.
[33:16] Probably going to run, right? Going to
[33:17] call the cops. I'm not I'm not telling
[33:19] you to take a shot. I'm just saying
[33:20] hypothetically.
[33:22] It's the guy who's like, "Hey, man.
[33:24] Sorry." Wants to move on. You know,
[33:26] doesn't want to have a problem. And And
[33:28] why is he doing that? He knows he can
[33:29] hold his own. Doesn't need a posture.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Doesn't need to talk trash. So, listen.
[33:33] There's a way then that he says,
[33:34] "Blessed are the peacemakers." Why?
[33:36] Because you're going to have to have a
[33:37] spirit of peace to war properly.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit of faith and rest. That's
[33:43] the divine. The human part is to get
[33:45] amped up and ready for war. But the
[33:47] battle readiness is peace of mind.
[33:51] Religion promises peace at the end of
[33:53] the war. Jesus promises peace before you
[33:54] fight.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; He teaches peace of mind. He promotes
[33:58] this peacefulness and promises peace
[34:00] before the fighting even begins
[34:03] &gt;&gt; because he says, "Blessed are the
[34:04] peacemakers. I'm sending you forth into
[34:06] war. I I I know it's going to be hard.
[34:08] You're going to have to battle. YOU'RE
[34:09] GOING TO BE PERSECUTED, BUT BLESSED ARE
[34:10] THE PEACEMAKERS."
[34:13] &gt;&gt; AGAIN, it shows this other side
[34:16] where it's not just all the human part
[34:18] that we emphasize, but it's divinity.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Divinity does not come by holding back
[34:25] emotion or suppressing emotion.
[34:28] But this divinity is is manifested by
[34:30] the expression of a more excellent
[34:32] emotion.
[34:35] I I found this to be fascinating as you
[34:37] you study these things out and you start
[34:39] trying to wrestle out humanity humanity
[34:41] and divinity as I've been trying to look
[34:43] at this and certain CHARACTERISTICS THAT
[34:44] WELL OH THAT LOOKS VERY CHRISTIAN or
[34:46] that looks Christlike or or that's one
[34:48] way to do it. But did you know that uh
[34:50] let's maybe even if it's just fear I
[34:52] will say it this way some emotions could
[34:54] be overcome two different ways either by
[34:58] diminishing one's interest or the
[35:00] increase of of interest. In other words
[35:03] I could be really really afraid of
[35:04] something and uh and then I become less
[35:08] afraid or I'm less interested in
[35:09] something therefore I'm not afraid of it
[35:10] anymore. Kind of with the idea of pain
[35:13] there's a way that maybe you may cease
[35:14] to feel pain you become numb. So
[35:17] therefore, there's no fear of pain.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; But then you may be willing to endure
[35:22] that pain for some other gain.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; And so you've OVERCOME PAIN OR OVERCOME
[35:28] THE FEAR of pain. You overcome fear two
[35:30] different ways. One, you can just lose
[35:32] interest. That doesn't scare me anymore.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, that that uh that's
[35:37] powerful. That's a miracle."
[35:40] But on the other hand, what if you could
[35:42] say, "It scares me to death. I'm scared,
[35:45] but I have a greater there's a greater
[35:48] feeling
[35:50] that begins TO SWELL UP INSIDE OF ME
[35:52] THAT'S greater than that.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[35:55] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES THE DEVIL TRIES TO USE IT
[35:57] WHERE WE SAY, "WELL, I I I'm afraid I'M
[35:59] GOING TO GET SICK OR I'M AFRAID I'M
[36:00] GOING TO DIE BECAUSE OF CANCER." SO,
[36:02] WELL, you know, that's human.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; THAT'S A NATURAL RESPONSE.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T TRY TO MAKE YOURSELF ANY LESS
[36:09] CHRISTIAN BECAUSE YOU FEEL THAT WAY. YOU
[36:11] GOT TO REALIZE THERE'S TWO WAYS THAT YOU
[36:12] CAN NO LONGER UH UH LET THAT govern you.
[36:15] One, you could DON'T CARE IF YOU DIE
[36:16] ANYMORE. I don't care anymore. And you
[36:18] say, "Well, that's is that really
[36:20] faith?"
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Or could there BE SOMETHING ELSE INSIDE
[36:23] OF YOU WHERE I WANT TO LIVE FOR GOD? I I
[36:27] I I'M NOT A I KNOW GOD. I HAVE A GREATER
[36:29] FAITH IN THE FACT THAT GOD'S A HEALER
[36:31] AND THERE'S SOME OTHER SENSE THAT BEGINS
[36:33] TO RISE ABOVE THAT.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; One is it's a difference of having no
[36:37] feeling versus having a greater feeling.
[36:40] I I was HAD THIS THOUGHT THIS PAST week
[36:43] and I've had this thought some other
[36:44] times and stick with me. Bear with me.
[36:46] Paul said, "Bear with me in my folly."
[36:48] Certainly, you could do the same for a
[36:49] low-level guy like me, but um
[36:54] I I can be quite the when it comes
[36:56] to getting into cold water in a swimming
[36:58] pool, right? You know, I just sense I
[37:00] don't care about swimming. But really, I
[37:03] can't stand how that can feel when you
[37:05] get into a pool and it's really, really
[37:06] cold, right? Anybody any amens here?
[37:10] And so anyways, um,
[37:14] and I there's different ways you can
[37:16] overcome that. And, uh, this isn't
[37:19] therapy session or anything. I'm not
[37:20] trying to work anything through here,
[37:21] but it's like taking a cold plunge. I
[37:25] You could ask me to jump in a swimming
[37:27] pool and uh, and I can I may not be able
[37:30] to psych myself into it. I I don't want
[37:31] to get cold. I don't want to do it. I
[37:32] don't want to do it. You know, the the
[37:35] taking a cold shower, it's like, oh, no,
[37:36] no, I don't want to. I don't want to do
[37:37] it. I don't want to. It's just this way
[37:39] that you're adverse to it. Well, some
[37:40] could do it because they overcome that
[37:42] feeling of danger [snorts] and they kind
[37:44] of embrace the pain. You say, "Well,
[37:46] that's that's pretty that's pretty good.
[37:48] That that's that's someone who's
[37:50] overcome." But this is the way that I
[37:52] thought about it. See, I hadn't even got
[37:53] to what I was thinking about recently. I
[37:55] know that as much as I don't want to
[37:57] jump into cold water, I know if I had to
[38:00] do it for my family member, I wouldn't
[38:01] hesitate. Amen.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things I DON'T WANT,
[38:06] &gt;&gt; PAINS I DON'T WANT TO FEEL, THINGS I
[38:08] DON'T WANT TO EXPERIENCE, THINGS THAT
[38:09] I'M AFRAID OF. BUT I KNOW THAT IF THERE
[38:11] WAS A GREATER feeling or greater need,
[38:15] &gt;&gt; that I could overcome that.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; And that in doing that, IT WAS A A
[38:19] GREATER A SENSE OF A GREATER LOSS.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; OH, I I could I COULD JUMP IN A POOL AND
[38:24] GET FREEZING COLD AND I DID IT. I TOOK
[38:26] THE COLD PLUNGE. I'M IN THE POLAR CLUB.
[38:28] AND PEOPLE LIKE, CONGRATULATIONS, you're
[38:29] in the polar club. BUT WHAT ABOUT
[38:31] ENDURING PAIN FOR THE SAKE OF SOMEBODY
[38:33] ELSE?
[38:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; WE COULD ALL SANCTIFY OURSELVES AND QUIT
[38:36] THIS AND QUIT THAT SO WE COULD BE BETTER
[38:38] ATHLETES AND SO WE COULD WE COULD SAY
[38:39] THAT WE'RE ON THIS STREAK. BUT WHAT
[38:41] ABOUT DOING SOMETHING FOR SOMEBODY
[38:42] ELSE'S SAKE?
[38:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; THE SAME ACT OF JUMPING INTO COLD WATER
[38:47] BECAUSE YOU WANT TO OVERCOME PAIN IS
[38:50] MAYBE IN THAT IT'S A CONSTRICTION of
[38:52] heart. It's a DEBASING YOURSELF. IT'S
[38:54] LIKE TAKING something and limiting your
[38:56] feeling. But then the other to JUMP IN
[38:57] TO SAVE SOMEBODY else is an enlargement
[38:59] of heart. Right.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; It's an expansion.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Think of the miracles of Jesus. Jesus
[39:05] didn't walk on water because he wanted
[39:06] to show off.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; He walked on water because those that he
[39:10] loved were threatened by the storm.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't do it because to him the waves
[39:14] weren't big. He didn't do it because
[39:16] they weren't life-threatening and they
[39:17] weren't something that he should be
[39:18] afraid of. He he did IT BECAUSE HE LOVED
[39:21] THOSE THAT WERE IN DANGER and it was
[39:22] love that drove them into the storm. He
[39:24] did it for their sakes.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there are many different acts
[39:27] that WE CAN PERFORM THAT HUMANS PERFORM.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; YES.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; But the portrait of divinity has a
[39:33] deeper expression.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; I'm not just restraining from doing
[39:37] this. And I I'm not just doing I'm not
[39:40] just cancelelling out fear. I'm not just
[39:42] going through pain. I'm doing it for the
[39:44] joy which is set before me.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; I I think I probably made a pretty big
[39:48] mess of that. So we might just have to
[39:49] do a whole series on this next year.
[39:52] This is our 77th sermon on art, the
[39:54] subject of arts. Next year we might just
[39:56] have to say you remember that sermon on
[39:58] a Wednesday night before Christmas part
[40:00] 80
[40:06] in the biatitudes what he's saying is
[40:08] blessed are these but this blessedness
[40:12] is because of God
[40:14] &gt;&gt; the divinity not the human side we can't
[40:16] try to portray the biatitudes through
[40:18] human intelligence
[40:19] &gt;&gt; right
[40:21] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 13:es 4-7 we'll
[40:23] skip to verse Think of this. Charity
[40:26] suffereth long and is kind.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; When we read this, we try to think of
[40:30] wow a good person. But this is divinity.
[40:34] This is divine. Charity suffereth long
[40:36] and is kind. Charity envithth not.
[40:37] Charity veneth not itself. Is not puffed
[40:39] up. Doth not behave itself unseemly.
[40:41] Seketh not her own. Is not easily
[40:42] provoked. Thinkketh no evil. These are
[40:44] godly attributes. God is love.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; So God suffers long. He's kind. He
[40:50] doesn't envy. Say, "Well, he's a jealous
[40:52] God, but he doesn't envy of this sort.
[40:54] He vaunted not himself, IS NOT PUFFED
[40:56] UP, DOESN'T BEHAVE ITSELF UNSEEMLY,
[40:58] seeketh not her own, is not easily
[40:59] provoked, thinkketh no evil, rejoiceth
[41:01] not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in truth,
[41:03] beareth all things, believeth all
[41:04] things, hopeeth all things, endureth all
[41:06] things.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; These are divine attributes.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; IT'S A PORTRAIT OF DEITY. VERSE 13, AND
[41:12] NOW ABIDETH FAITH, HOPE, CHARITY, THESE
[41:14] THREE, but the greatest of these is
[41:17] charity.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:20] That's is how I guess you could say to
[41:22] Paul when he says, "Well, though I do
[41:24] all these things and have not charity,
[41:26] I'm nothing."
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Because we could do all these acts aside
[41:29] from a a an expression of the divine,
[41:32] and it's just a human doing human
[41:34] things.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just waiting for them to do
[41:37] this. I'm just being patient. I'm just
[41:39] being kind. I'm just not going to
[41:41] believe evil. What's your motive and
[41:43] objective? What are you expressing?
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He ends chapter 12 with this
[41:49] verse. 1 Corinthians 12:31. But covet
[41:52] earnestly the best gifts and yet show I
[41:55] unto you a more excellent way.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Charity is not the perfection of
[42:00] humanity.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; This capstone is not kind of like the
[42:03] crowning of human achievement. It's not
[42:06] the perfection of human virtue, but it's
[42:08] an expression of divinity.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; This is a divine characteristic.
[42:13] Nehemiah chapter 9:17. Thou art a God
[42:16] ready to pardon, gracious and merciful,
[42:19] slow to anger and of great kindness.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; This is the DIVINE PORTRAIT.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; SUFFERETH LONG AND IS KIND, not easily
[42:27] provoked, endureth all things, beareth
[42:29] all things. GOD IS READY TO PARDON. GOD
[42:32] IS GRACIOUS and merciful, SLOW TO ANGER,
[42:34] OF GREAT KINDNESS. THIS IS DIVINITY.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE MIGHT THINK THAT WHEN WE DO
[42:40] THESE THINGS, WE'RE TRYING TO BE BETTER
[42:41] HUMANS, TRY TO BE MORE LIKE THE MAN
[42:43] CHRIST JESUS. BUT ACTUALLY, HE'S
[42:45] INVITING US TO BE MORE DIVINE THROUGH
[42:46] THESE CHARACTERISTICS THAT WE MIGHT
[42:48] THINK, "OH, WELL, THAT'S JUST HUMAN.
[42:49] THAT'S JUST A A WEAK-MINDED PERSON."
[42:52] WELL, there's just certain people that
[42:53] are called to be more human and they're
[42:55] more sensitive and they're more sweet
[42:56] and they're more kind and they're more
[42:58] forgiving and they're just a little bit
[43:00] more in touch with their humanity and
[43:01] I'm just called to be a brute WARRIOR
[43:03] AND I'M GOING TO TEAR PEOPLE UP and I'm
[43:05] GOING TO SCOLD YOU. I'M GOING TO BEAT
[43:06] YOU UP AND I'M GOING TO BE THE I'M GOING
[43:08] to do this and I'm going to do that cuz
[43:09] I'm the warrior. They say, "Well, I
[43:12] mean, where's where's Christ in this?"
[43:15] &gt;&gt; And they're playing they're doing
[43:16] cosplay of Christ who braided the whip
[43:18] in the temple,
[43:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:20] &gt;&gt; And they want to be the people that
[43:21] throw over the money tables and they
[43:22] want to braid the whip and they want to
[43:24] do all that, but there's no other
[43:26] there's no other view. You You want to
[43:27] zoom out? They don't have anything else.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; It's all they are. There's just a
[43:33] snapshot of Jesus in the temple with the
[43:34] braided rope. You say, "Well, was that
[43:37] brother brother Ram said Jesus didn't
[43:38] have the fruits of the spirit in that
[43:40] instance."
[43:41] &gt;&gt; But was that sin? Was that not godlike?
[43:44] God prophesied, "The zeal of thy house
[43:46] hath eaten me up."
[43:48] &gt;&gt; That's an expression of divinity.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; And you're thinking, "Ah, yes, good."
[43:55] But without the rest of the picture,
[43:58] &gt;&gt; it just becomes anything else. becomes
[44:01] an act without that deeper thought.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; In John chapter 8 10-11
[44:08] I this is just an example of how
[44:13] of the divine when Jesus lifted up
[44:15] himself and saw none but the woman he
[44:16] said unto heroman where are thine
[44:18] accusers hath no man condemned thee?
[44:22] This is the woman caught in adultery.
[44:24] Strange that they brought just the woman
[44:27] in order to properly accuse her. the man
[44:29] would have had to been brought himself.
[44:31] But they begin to write. He begins to
[44:33] write in the sand. And
[44:35] one by one, each man dropped his stone
[44:37] and began to walk away. And Jesus says,
[44:39] "Where where where are your accusers?"
[44:40] She says, "No man, Lord." One place she
[44:42] says, "Only you." But Jesus said unto
[44:45] her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and
[44:48] sin no more."
[44:50] &gt;&gt; When this is Jesus in not condemning the
[44:53] adulterous woman, this was not uh the
[44:56] sympathy of a mortal.
[44:58] We know for sure this is not the empathy
[45:00] of someone WHO'S BEEN CAUGHT IN SIN
[45:02] BEFORE.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHEN JESUS SAID,
[45:04] "LET HE WHO IS WITHOUT SIN CAST THE
[45:06] FIRST STONE," IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE
[45:08] WANTED TO GET TO the front of the line.
[45:10] Because he's the only ONE THAT COULD
[45:11] HAVE DONE IT.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; He's going, "Let he WHO IS WITHOUT SIN
[45:15] CAST THE FIRST STONE."
[45:18] &gt;&gt; HELLO. RIGHT. Come here, WOMAN. AND
[45:20] LINES UP HIS SHOT. BUT THE VERY ONE WHO
[45:22] HAD A RIGHT to condemn
[45:25] &gt;&gt; says, "NEITHER DO I CONDEMN THEE. THIS
[45:27] WAS NOT THE EMPATHY OF A MAN WHO SINNED.
[45:29] THIS IS NOT THE SYMPATHY OF A MORTAL.
[45:31] BUT THIS IS THE VERY HEART OF THE
[45:33] DIVINE. A God who is ready to pardon.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; This is a God who's gracious and
[45:38] merciful. When all her accusers stood
[45:40] there ready to to beat her in what?
[45:43] Divine vengeance
[45:44] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE LAW THAT GOD GAVE US.
[45:46] WE'RE GOING TO HONOR GOD BY SHEDDING HER
[45:48] BLOOD. AND YET GOD IS EXPRESSED in
[45:50] saying, "Neither do I condemn thee."
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. In John 20:es 19 to23,
[45:58] then the same day at evening be the
[45:59] first day of the week when the doors
[46:00] were shut. This is after his
[46:02] resurrection where the disciples were
[46:04] assembled for fear of the Jews came
[46:05] Jesus and stood in the midst and said
[46:06] unto them, peace be unto you.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; And when he had so said, he showed unto
[46:11] them his hands and his side.
[46:14] Now he wasn't saying, you remember those
[46:17] scars I had gone
[46:20] gone. He was showing him scars,
[46:22] &gt;&gt; that human side.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Does God scar? Does divinity scar? But
[46:26] he showed them this human side,
[46:28] &gt;&gt; these markings. Then were the disciples
[46:30] glad when they saw the Lord. Then said
[46:33] Jesus to them again, peace be unto you.
[46:35] As my father hath sent me, even so send
[46:38] I you. So now here's this commission.
[46:41] And when he had said this, he breathed
[46:43] on them and said unto them, receive ye
[46:44] the Holy Ghost and make listen to these
[46:46] words. I'm just reading this. Whosoever
[46:49] sins ye remit,
[46:51] &gt;&gt; they are remitted unto them.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; And whose sins whosoever sins you
[46:55] retain, they are retained.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Now, we we wouldn't want to twist this
[47:00] like the Catholic Church does.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; But these are the words of Christ, and
[47:04] they have some application, some
[47:06] expression. And just as Christ looked at
[47:08] the woman in adultery and said, "Neither
[47:10] do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more."
[47:12] He's saying, "Now, as the father has
[47:14] sent me, I send you. And you have power
[47:16] to remit sins."
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[47:18] &gt;&gt; That you have power through the gospel
[47:21] to call people to repentance.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; And to whosoever would retain their sins
[47:26] and not repent, they are retained.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; But yet, he's calling us to the same
[47:30] place, this portrait of divinity. We see
[47:32] God AS A GOD OF JUSTICE and a God of a
[47:35] righteousness and a God of wrath. But
[47:36] here's this other side of divinity that
[47:38] there would be an opportunity
[47:41] for salvation.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to forget to say welcome
[47:45] brother David Fritz, but he's visited so
[47:46] often that he just feels like part of
[47:48] the family. So didn't mean to not
[47:49] acknowledge you earlier, but I'm doing
[47:51] it now in a very awkward time. So maybe
[47:53] that makes you feel more called out or
[47:55] special. I don't know. Right. On the
[47:57] subject of remitting sins, it wasn't
[47:59] intentional.
[48:01] You don't feel uncomfortable, do you?
[48:02] Good. Oh, he does. Sorry. Forgive me.
[48:06] remit my sins, please.
[48:11] This attitude,
[48:14] this heart for lost souls,
[48:17] those weak or those marginalized, those
[48:20] that are hurting.
[48:22] You think about Jonah
[48:25] as some people often say the the whale
[48:28] of a baal
[48:30] that he's he's
[48:32] travels runs away from God and comes
[48:34] back finally yields to this calling to
[48:36] go to Nineveh and curse them and he's
[48:38] pretty excited about this. He's finally
[48:40] come around on it. You know what? If
[48:42] anything, they're going to be cursed.
[48:43] And he preaches judgment and then they
[48:45] repent
[48:48] &gt;&gt; and then God spares them and he's
[48:50] disappointed.
[48:53] And why should have he not been
[48:54] disappointed? Because he really liked
[48:56] that side of God that would judge the
[48:58] Nvites.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; The he he he he liked that side of God.
[49:03] So he was happy to do that part. But
[49:05] then when God when they repented then
[49:08] now he's disappointed
[49:10] &gt;&gt; because he couldn't embrace that side of
[49:12] the divine
[49:14] &gt;&gt; as easily as he could the other.
[49:21] Let this mind be in you.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; So in Philippians chapter 4:8, we we'll
[49:26] invite the musicians to come.
[49:29] In Philippians 4:8, he says, "Finally,
[49:32] brethren," here's his summarizing this
[49:33] these great thoughts in Philippians.
[49:37] Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are
[49:39] true,
[49:41] whatsoever things are honest,
[49:44] &gt;&gt; whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
[49:47] things are pure.
[49:49] When you think about this, those things
[49:50] ring of God.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; I am the way, the truth, the life. God
[49:54] is true. There's no darkness in him
[49:55] whatsoever.
[49:57] He's just. He's pure.
[50:00] And it's we're to have a blessed are
[50:03] those that are pure in spirit.
[50:06] Blessed are those that hunger and thirst
[50:07] for justness or righteousness. There's a
[50:09] lot of these this symmetry with these
[50:11] characteristics. True, honest, just,
[50:12] pure. But then it says, whatsoever
[50:14] things are lovely.
[50:17] And that word there just carries with
[50:18] it, I think a word that uh one writer
[50:20] uses winsomeness. It's this
[50:22] agreeableness
[50:24] that you have this honesty, this truth,
[50:27] this justness, this purity, but then
[50:29] lovely. Whatsoever things are of good
[50:31] report. If there be any virtue, if there
[50:33] be any praise, think on these things.
[50:35] notes, put your mind on it.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; And what I how I want to just maybe say
[50:39] this in a way that can try to collapse
[50:40] it down and summarize it. What he says,
[50:43] think on these things, he's not drawing
[50:45] your mind away from Christ to something
[50:47] else.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; He's not saying, "WELL, KEEP YOUR MIND
[50:50] STAYED ON GOD, AND IF YOU'D keep your
[50:51] mind stayed on him, he'll keep you in
[50:53] perfect peace and a and focus on the
[50:55] things of God." But if you're not able
[50:56] to do that, just think about things that
[50:57] are true and honest and just and pure
[50:59] and lovely and of good report. These are
[51:01] godlike.
[51:03] These are traits and characteristics
[51:06] that are divine.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; This is this is the portrait of divinity
[51:21] we're called to express.
[51:24] Whatsoever things are lovely, of good
[51:27] report,
[51:28] think on these things.
[51:31] These are this this is a portrait of
[51:33] God. God is lovely. Doesn't he say he'd
[51:35] be called wonderful?
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Though a man of sorrow is acquainted
[51:39] with grief and we see this side of him
[51:41] that seems so uh uh uh low. Well, that
[51:43] was the human part. It's part of the
[51:45] picture.
[51:47] Yeah. We want to aspire to the greatness
[51:49] in these great things. But God God wants
[51:51] us to be portraits of Christ a and not
[51:55] just in the great signs and wonders, but
[51:58] in the whole thing.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Many will come to him at that DAY
[52:02] AND SAY WE DID ALL THESE WONDERFUL WORKS
[52:04] and he's going to say but yet it never
[52:06] expressed me
[52:09] because morality may know be known by a
[52:11] person's acts but but the expression THE
[52:15] EXPRESSION WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING
[52:16] EXPRESSED COMES deeper
[52:18] &gt;&gt; the motive and objective
[52:21] and so God wants us to be pictures and
[52:23] portraits of Christ. We're written
[52:24] epistles and he's given us a measure of
[52:26] grace to be Christlike.
[52:29] Ephesians 4:7, "But out of every one of
[52:31] us is given grace according to the
[52:33] measure of the gift of Christ." And it's
[52:36] in that verse chapter where he says,
[52:38] "The measure of the stature of a perfect
[52:40] man."
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; So what Christ was, every Christian
[52:43] should desire to be.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; He is our example of mighty works. He's
[52:48] our example of of holiness and the
[52:49] supernatural and sinlessness, but he's
[52:51] also the example of loveliness and
[52:53] agreeableness. Amen.
[52:55] And as you look at the picture of
[52:57] Christ, we see a portrait of humanity.
[52:59] He wept. He hungered. We can see these
[53:01] different things. But the other side of
[53:02] that humanity is he walked on water. He
[53:04] multiplied bread. He multiplied fish. We
[53:07] can say, well, he was also divine. He
[53:08] did this and he did that. But then also
[53:10] part of this divine is the gentleness,
[53:12] the meekness, the humility.
[53:15] And so God has given us grace to express
[53:17] [music] this full picture of Christ.
[53:21] And in these things that I was trying to
[53:23] emphasize tonight, the obedience, the
[53:25] humility, even the death on the cross,
[53:27] surely this was the son of God. Neither
[53:29] do I condemn thee. This meekness, the
[53:30] forgiveness, this way of carrying
[53:32] himself. The language, the the action
[53:36] may seem to be of earth,
[53:39] but the accent is from heaven.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; The the actions may seem to be human,
[53:48] &gt;&gt; but the expression is truly divine.
[53:50] Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; As a song was sung in the service, his
[53:53] law is love and his gospel is peace.
[53:57] [music] That there's there's a there's a
[53:58] side to the divine that we've got to
[54:00] embrace as divine. And I present it to
[54:03] you that way so that you'll want it.
[54:06] If we say that humility is a result of
[54:09] seeing less of ourselves and that
[54:11] meekness is is is it comes through
[54:13] seeing how small we are and that and and
[54:16] to have this gentleness we have to
[54:17] really see how debased and debotched we
[54:19] are as sinful creatures then we won't
[54:21] lean into that. Then we'll try to find
[54:24] some other way to replicate that.
[54:27] Remember the cold plunge, right? That
[54:30] there's a way that I can overcome this
[54:32] fear and that's the way we'll do it. But
[54:34] that's not the way he wants us to overdo
[54:36] it. HE TO OVERCOME. HE WANTS us to
[54:38] recognize this is divine to do this.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; That I can't. Jesus faced DEATH AS A
[54:44] MAN. BUT WHAT DID HE EXPRESS? THE HEART
[54:46] OF GOD,
[54:47] &gt;&gt; THE WILL OF GOD.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; GOD couldn't die.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; It's impossible for him to die.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; But he wanted to.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; He wanted to die. If he could, he would
[54:59] have. But he sent his son as a man. So
[55:02] that when he died, it was almost this
[55:04] ultimate expression of God that even God
[55:07] himself
[55:08] &gt;&gt; could have only done through his son.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; And that was not the portrait of an
[55:13] ultimately broken man.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; But almost the perfect picture of God,
[55:20] &gt;&gt; that is that a is that a divine you
[55:22] could hunger for? just turn it around
[55:24] and realize that these difficult things
[55:26] that God asked us to do isn't because to
[55:28] make us more human and make us feel more
[55:31] low and small, but it's to make you
[55:33] hunger for the divine.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; I hope these things could be on your
[55:37] heart as you ponder the birth of Christ
[55:39] over the next week. Yes, sir.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; And this beautiful picture that's
[55:42] painted in the scripture of the perfect
[55:44] man that he's called [music] you to be.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; This duality, as brother Eleazar put it,
[55:49] thought it was beautiful. This duality
[55:50] of humanity and divinity perfectly
[55:52] expressed
[55:53] to where hopefully at the by looking at
[55:55] this, you finally just say, you know
[55:57] what, I can't really separate it.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; I don't know what to call human. I don't
[56:01] know what to call divine. I just know
[56:02] it's God.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; It's God in flesh. And that way, we can
[56:07] embrace it for ourselves. Lord, I want
[56:08] to be Christlike. Let's stand today.
[56:10] Thank you so much this evening. Thank
[56:12] you so much for your attentiveness.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together.
[56:21] Perhaps your prayer is Lord, I want to
[56:22] be more like you.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; I want to express the divine,
[56:28] Lord. Yes, we want to I I want to speak
[56:32] a world into existence. I I I want to
[56:34] lay my hands on the sick and they
[56:35] recover. I want to speak to the storm
[56:38] and it obeys me. I I I want to cast out
[56:41] devils. I I want to do many wonderful
[56:43] works uh uh in his name. These are
[56:45] things I believe that are for us in the
[56:48] atonement.
[56:50] But then what about these other parts?
[56:52] Well, I want these two.
[56:55] I want to take on I want to make myself
[56:56] of no reputation. I want to be a
[56:58] servant. I want to be humble. [music] I
[57:00] want to become obedient.
[57:02] I want to have meekness and gentleness.
[57:03] I want to be poor in spirit. I want to
[57:04] mourn. I want to be meek.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; I want to hunger and thirst for
[57:08] righteousness, not act as if I have it
[57:09] all and have need of nothing. I want to
[57:11] be merciful. I want to be pure in heart.
[57:14] I want to be persecuted for
[57:16] righteousness sake, not for my
[57:18] selfishness.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; I want to know that I'm blessed when men
[57:21] revile me and persecute me and say all
[57:22] manner against me falsely for Christ's
[57:24] sake. I want to be able to rejoice and
[57:26] be exceeding glad. Not because I'm
[57:28] enduring it and it does it matter to me.
[57:30] And sticks and stones may break my
[57:31] bones, but words will never hurt me, but
[57:32] for great is my reward in heaven.
[57:36] [music]
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, my language and my actions may be
[57:39] of earth. They may be human. Lord, let
[57:41] the accent and the expression [music] be
[57:43] from above.
[57:45] Let's pray. Gracious heavenly father,
[57:46] today as we close this service, I I know
[57:50] it's straightforward and I do know that
[57:52] there it's a very simple maybe linear
[57:55] thought, but Lord, I do understand just
[57:58] how hard it can be to grasp this
[58:02] because for so long, Lord, when we
[58:03] looked into the Bible, I can only speak
[58:05] for myself, there's a almost this quick
[58:07] categorization of the things that are
[58:09] divine, the things that are deity, the
[58:10] things that are supernatural. And then
[58:12] there's this other side and it's like,
[58:13] well, when he was a man, he did this.
[58:14] when he was God, he did that. And we
[58:15] just have this separation
[58:18] for no Lord, it was certainly a struggle
[58:20] at times for the disciples to know when
[58:22] you were truly speaking and it was God
[58:24] speaking and when it was a man. And
[58:25] maybe there's always this wrestling of
[58:26] well, what's this and what's that? But
[58:29] Lord, as the pictures painted in the
[58:30] Gospels and as Paul continued to paint
[58:33] the portrait through his letters and the
[58:34] New Testament is written,
[58:37] it's showing us a beautiful expression
[58:39] of who you are.
[58:42] And Lord, I don't want to go through it
[58:43] and just separate things out and say,
[58:45] "Well, this is what we really want. We
[58:46] want signs and wonders and miracles
[58:48] because that's the God part." We want
[58:52] that part because that's what we were
[58:54] called to be. These signs shall follow
[58:57] them that believe. But Lord, we realize
[58:59] there's another side to it that we could
[59:02] be known by all these different acts and
[59:05] that expresses something about us. But
[59:07] the full picture is only understood
[59:12] by the by what the motive and objective
[59:14] is. That's that's the real expression of
[59:17] you. To be expressions of Christ, we
[59:19] cannot just modulate something external.
[59:24] We've got to have the divine on the
[59:25] inside.
[59:27] that the one who created the hand could
[59:29] make himself of no reputation. [music]
[59:32] &gt;&gt; The one who unfolded the world from
[59:35] [snorts] his fingertips
[59:38] could be gentle and meek.
[59:41] To think, Lord, that it was the act of
[59:42] death that caused a Roman to say,
[59:45] "Truly, this was divine."
[59:50] Lord, I know my [music] words in in my
[59:53] approach and my manner and maybe the way
[59:56] I pieced it together falls woefully
[59:57] short
[59:59] of the picture that of of divinity that
[1:00:02] I believe you're wanting to convey
[1:00:04] through this structure. So, I ask,
[1:00:05] Father, reveal it in them. Show them,
[1:00:08] Lord. May May they hunger and thirst for
[1:00:10] divinity like they've never have before.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Not to be powerhouses [music]
[1:00:15] uh through mighty acts, but through
[1:00:17] humility. The way up is down.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; The only way that we can become a
[1:00:22] powerhouse is if we had that cap, that
[1:00:24] true capstone of charity.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; That's when the expression is accurate.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Lord, we have many things that
[1:00:32] we could do as Christians, but as we
[1:00:33] continue to grow, as we continue to
[1:00:35] mature, may we become more seasoned,
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; peacemakers,
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; pardoners, forgivers, [music]
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; longsufferers,
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; help us in this dark time, even this
[1:00:47] holiday season, to be true portraits of
[1:00:49] [music] Christ.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; We ask it in the name of Lord Jesus
[1:00:51] Christ. Amen.
