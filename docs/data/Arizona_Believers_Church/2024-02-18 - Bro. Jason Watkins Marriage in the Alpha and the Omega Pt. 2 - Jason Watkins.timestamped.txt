[0:00] Revelation CH
[0:02] 1 verse 1 we'll read
[0:05] 1-8 the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[0:09] God gave unto him to show unto his
[0:12] servants things which must shortly come
[0:14] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[0:18] his Angel unto his servant John now a
[0:21] couple of things I'll just say leading
[0:23] into this very first uh let me just say
[0:26] this very first dip uh out out of the
[0:29] word that we're going to take today I've
[0:30] already explained to you from Psalms 102
[0:34] so you're already with me you're already
[0:36] on board that we're building the living
[0:39] Tabernacle of the living God's presence
[0:41] well that ought to include marriage as
[0:43] we were saying last night that you know
[0:46] that Paul when he speaks to the church
[0:48] and you know husbands love your wives
[0:50] and didn't just say to do it but
[0:52] actually explained how to go about it
[0:54] that as Christ loved the church and gave
[0:56] himself for it and there's lots of men
[0:58] who have obeyed the first first part of
[1:00] that because that was the free part the
[1:02] easy part you loved her but have you
[1:04] loved her in expression like Christ
[1:07] loved how he went about doing it say
[1:10] love is a doing of course it's a doing
[1:13] love is an expression love brother
[1:16] Brandon talks about that great Fountain
[1:18] from the eternities that great Fountain
[1:20] of Love did it stay that Fountain back
[1:22] in the eternities no it's it expressed
[1:25] and that's why brother Brandon would say
[1:27] that you know in in the
[1:30] how that God has only had one goal in
[1:33] the uh Christ is the mystery of God
[1:35] revealed God has only ever had one goal
[1:38] see and so we know that he brings it in
[1:41] in you know three three phases of God
[1:44] above god with and then God in but but
[1:47] you realize that he has ever only had
[1:49] one goal and that
[1:52] goal been
[1:55] expression to express himself so he was
[1:58] never content to just be alone uh with
[2:02] his deity he wanted to express and this
[2:05] is why really the world misunderstands
[2:09] the godhead so deeply because they they
[2:11] don't understand expression and so they
[2:14] look at the godhead like a linear
[2:17] mathematical equation and they either
[2:18] come up with one or two or three and all
[2:21] three of those Concepts fall short or go
[2:24] too far the trinitarians in their
[2:27] formula Chop God into three individual
[2:29] ual persons you say well that we know
[2:32] that's wrong but then brother brandham
[2:35] talks about the Oneness and in the
[2:37] Oneness formula they see Jesus only so
[2:40] what are they missing they're missing
[2:42] the expression of God in his bride
[2:45] they're missing the church see so this
[2:48] is why brother Brandon would say that
[2:51] that every son and daughter of God he
[2:52] would teach us this very clearly and
[2:54] this is right on tape teaching that that
[2:57] every son and daughter of God born again
[2:59] by the the spirit of God you are
[3:01] actually a part of God's
[3:03] godhead that's a direct quote part of
[3:07] God's godhead look it up and so you
[3:09] realize that the whole thing uh begins
[3:12] to be understood by expression well then
[3:15] that then once you know that then you
[3:18] have to take ownership of the fact that
[3:20] wow I need to do some surrendering so he
[3:23] can do some expressing because for sure
[3:27] there's nothing good about me that's
[3:30] going to be that's going to give glory
[3:32] to him there's none of us good no not
[3:35] one sometimes I've seen young sisters
[3:37] who you know fall for some worldly boy
[3:40] and he's got beautiful eyes and he's got
[3:42] a beautiful smile and and uh and then
[3:45] she tries to he's not a Believer so she
[3:47] wants to qualify to me why she's kind of
[3:50] interested in him brother Jason he's a
[3:52] good person I said no he's
[3:55] not there's none
[3:57] good there's none good get that through
[4:00] your mind sisters brothers there's none
[4:02] good no not one we're all open
[4:06] slicers it's God rich in Mercy he's the
[4:09] only one good Jesus said why callest
[4:12] thou me good there's only one good that
[4:13] is God see and so so we realize that
[4:17] Peter said that apart from the Holy
[4:20] Ghost we're just animals we're just
[4:22] brute
[4:23] beasts see there can be filio love in
[4:27] that human relation which is just really
[4:30] uh extreme human friendship which will
[4:32] fail you when times get rough I don't
[4:35] know why I'm saying this today this okay
[4:37] it'll fail you sisters brothers you're
[4:40] looking for a spouse trust me Good Times
[4:43] uh you will get good uh good response
[4:45] but let times get rough only love will
[4:48] sustain see and so we realize that that
[4:53] and I and I'm quick to point out to
[4:54] young men and young women they might say
[4:57] they love you and they might even
[4:59] actually mean it and they're not telling
[5:01] a lie that for all they know they mean
[5:03] they love you but just understand that
[5:07] the mechanism of Love of real love which
[5:10] is agape love which is God's love that's
[5:13] the only form of true love the Bible
[5:16] doesn't say God has love the Bible says
[5:19] God in fact is love so and the Bible
[5:23] says that the love of God that love is
[5:27] poured into us by the Holy Ghost so how
[5:29] do they have the real love if they don't
[5:32] have the Holy
[5:33] Ghost see how do you you might have a
[5:36] car sitting out there but if you don't
[5:37] have an engine in it what what good is
[5:39] it going to do you you push it that
[5:41] ain't going to get you very far it'll
[5:43] cost you a lot of Of Heartache but put
[5:45] an engine in it and have everything
[5:47] running right and it'll and it'll
[5:49] service you see so so again uh I I guess
[5:53] maybe the Lord is if we're going to talk
[5:55] about marriage we better start with
[5:57] those who aren't yet
[5:58] married so that when we talk about why
[6:01] things get so wrong in marriage you
[6:02] won't make the
[6:04] mistake and you can turn around and look
[6:06] at the adults and go y'all getting
[6:08] [Laughter]
[6:11] this so so I'm just I'm just I'm just
[6:15] trying to follow the leadership of the
[6:17] holy spirit so when we come to the
[6:20] revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave
[6:24] to him and brother brandham you know and
[6:26] I'm not going to go down that trail
[6:27] today cuz it's really a a rabbit trail
[6:30] that would engulf all my time but you
[6:33] know it's hard to it's hard to
[6:36] comprehend and it's difficult to get
[6:39] your mind around the fact that Jesus in
[6:44] his Earthly
[6:46] pilgrimage when he's walking the shores
[6:48] of
[6:49] Galilee he didn't know
[6:52] everything and he said I have to
[6:54] whatever I see the father do and brother
[6:57] brandham says that plainly on table you
[6:59] know there were things he he talks about
[7:01] you know when the woman touched his him
[7:03] of His Garment he didn't know who it was
[7:05] when a certain thing happened said Jesus
[7:07] and this is right on tape he said Jesus
[7:09] didn't know what to do and he had to
[7:10] wait see and so when he's in the room to
[7:14] raise the dead child there's so much
[7:16] unbelief and brother brandom this is his
[7:19] language he was in
[7:21] trouble imagine he was in trouble
[7:24] because there's so much unbelief and he
[7:26] said he had to literally speak in Tong
[7:29] and call into the spirit world
[7:31] tithum which is being interpreted damsel
[7:34] arise and he called her spirit back in
[7:37] fact is in jah's home he had to put
[7:39] everybody out they were laughing him to
[7:41] scorn brother Brandon would say it
[7:44] sometimes in a pray and he'd say now let
[7:46] me just turn my back he said I got to I
[7:48] got to block all of that see so so
[7:51] there's things in the Ethereal that we
[7:52] don't fully understand we're not trying
[7:54] to preach on it today but they're
[7:56] real and there's the presence of the
[7:59] Lord here today and there's angels and
[8:00] they're real brother brandham said in
[8:03] one you know sometimes Services can
[8:05] become so anointed the word can be some
[8:07] come so great he said you bump into
[8:09] something and turn around and there's
[8:11] nothing there he said you bumped into an
[8:13] angel so this is no joke this is for
[8:16] Real the presence of God is here and the
[8:19] devil is also trying to V for your
[8:22] attention see so we're we're you know
[8:25] life is sometimes not as it seems that's
[8:28] almost an
[8:30] statement so it's it's you know there
[8:33] there's things where he comes and then
[8:34] they ask him brother brandham uses that
[8:36] scripture in Acts they ask Jesus will
[8:38] you now re restore the kingdom to Israel
[8:40] and he says you know that's not for you
[8:42] to know even the son doesn't know that's
[8:45] his words even the son doesn't know the
[8:48] father knows but and and so it's it's
[8:51] it's so now but when he comes back in
[8:53] the Book of Revelation after he's
[8:55] ascended on high sent back his life into
[8:57] the church now now he's got the next
[9:00] phase of expression cuz he was God was
[9:03] never intending to stay bottled up in
[9:05] one lowly Nazarene walking the shores of
[9:07] Galilee his whole idea was a kingdom
[9:10] right A kingdom of saints that's why
[9:13] brother Brandon would say he's the
[9:14] beginning of the creation of God he's a
[9:17] brand new type of human he's a prototype
[9:19] for the whole Kingdom and you're the
[9:22] continuation of that same
[9:25] creation so so then if Jesus being
[9:28] perfect had to surrender to the father
[9:30] wouldn't you if Jesus already not being
[9:34] born in sin but had to learn obedience
[9:36] by the things he suffered how about you
[9:38] and I right I want to tell you something
[9:42] friends you're guaranteed to in the
[9:44] message of the hour you're guaranteed to
[9:46] not hear these things in the average
[9:48] pull pit oh we are privileged to know
[9:51] what God has brought to us in this
[9:56] hour so so we find this that that he
[10:00] comes back now he's got this great
[10:02] Revelation that he's going to give to
[10:03] John because again he's not going to
[10:05] keep it to himself it was never the plan
[10:08] he's going to give it to John to give to
[10:10] the churches and those Messengers those
[10:12] living creatures are going to be working
[10:14] those those those seven spirits of God
[10:17] not seven gods seven spirits of the same
[10:20] God that's going to work in his
[10:22] Messengers stars in his hand who are
[10:24] going to catch a revelation and run with
[10:26] it in every age so you know that's what
[10:29] you're reading you're reading Jesus in
[10:33] in Revelation 1 he's starting to explain
[10:38] how he's going to pull off Psalms
[10:42] 102 he's eventually going to get there
[10:45] this is how it's happening and you're it
[10:48] am you're involved and so he's sending
[10:52] you a revelation it's only a revelation
[10:54] that can keep you from paying too much
[10:57] attention to the world getting you know
[11:00] mesmerized like John did when he saw the
[11:03] the great Harlot and and John says I
[11:06] marveled with great admiration and the
[11:08] angel had to almost rebuke him and you
[11:11] know slap him to his senses but how did
[11:14] he do it he said I will tell you her
[11:18] secret and the revelation of the
[11:21] Antichrist brought John to his senses
[11:23] and he knew this is not to be worshiped
[11:25] and followed this is why brother
[11:27] brandham said when those two or three
[11:29] little girls at the end of the preview
[11:30] of the Bride they started getting out of
[11:32] Step he said it's CA they were looking
[11:34] at that other
[11:35] church and they got out of Step see so
[11:40] the beauty is that the prophet was he
[11:42] said I when I come to the come to myself
[11:44] I standing in the middle of the room
[11:46] saying stay in line get back in
[11:48] line and the beauty of it is is that if
[11:51] you're at a line today you're only half
[11:53] a step to get back don't let the devil
[11:56] discourage you now military people know
[11:59] that when you're marching left left left
[12:02] right left and you get out of Step all
[12:04] you need is just a half step and that'll
[12:07] put you right back in line you know I
[12:09] wasn't in the military I've seen it I've
[12:11] seen it described and they're left left
[12:15] left right left and if they get out of
[12:17] line all they have to do is left left
[12:21] just just take that half step and you'll
[12:23] be back in line it's not too late you're
[12:25] just a half a step out today make that
[12:28] half AEP step get back in
[12:30] line see
[12:33] so so we find then that he you know he
[12:37] he's he's talking about how that Christ
[12:39] now this burgeoning Revelation and
[12:42] that's why I was saying it's it's it's
[12:44] it's hard to comprehend it's difficult
[12:46] to get your mind around the fact that
[12:49] you right now if we're going to compare
[12:53] your life right now to the life of the
[12:56] Nazarene right then right back there
[12:59] before he died before he went up before
[13:01] he sent his life back before before he
[13:03] comes to John when he's walking the
[13:05] shores of
[13:07] gallilee comparing that time in his life
[13:10] to this time in your life it's hard to
[13:13] absorb that you know more than he
[13:18] did you know secrets of the Rapture that
[13:21] he didn't yet know you already know it
[13:25] amen you understand you're blinking
[13:28] you're you're
[13:29] don't just calm down calm down
[13:34] breathe but but this these are these are
[13:37] the things brother Brandon was bringing
[13:38] out to us doesn't make us greater than
[13:41] Jesus it just puts us in step with his
[13:45] Revelation cuz he was always going to
[13:47] come to that and you couldn't come to it
[13:48] until he come to it and gave it to the
[13:50] church so you got it from
[13:52] [Music]
[13:54] him verse two who bear record of the
[13:56] word of God and of the testimony of
[13:58] Jesus Christ and of the things that he
[13:59] saw blessed is he that readeth and they
[14:01] that hear the words of this prophecy and
[14:03] keep those things which are written
[14:05] therein for the times is at hand he goes
[14:07] on down you know John to the seven
[14:10] churches which are in Asia Grace be unto
[14:12] you and peace from him which is and
[14:14] which was and which is to come and from
[14:15] the seven spirits of God which are
[14:17] before his throne and from Jesus Christ
[14:20] catch it now verse five who is the
[14:22] faithful witness and the first begotten
[14:24] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[14:26] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[14:28] watch us from our sins in his own blood
[14:31] I don't see how a trinitarian reads
[14:35] these first five verses and makes Jesus
[14:38] a second person I don't know how you can
[14:41] read these descriptions and come away
[14:44] that he's a second person or that you're
[14:48] missing out that he has an expression in
[14:50] a family see and hath made us verse 6
[14:55] and hath made us priest and uh Kings and
[14:58] priest and un to God and his father to
[15:00] him be glory and Dominion forever and
[15:02] ever behold he cometh with clouds and
[15:05] every eye shall see him and they that
[15:06] which pierced him and all the kindreds
[15:08] of the Earth shall wh because of him
[15:10] even so a man so so you're in verse six
[15:14] you're reading the game plan for 2,000
[15:18] years of church history and by the time
[15:20] you get to verse 7 you're at the end of
[15:22] the tribulation and the brid's already
[15:23] been long gone and the whole earth sees
[15:26] him and they're not happy
[15:29] to see
[15:31] him can you imagine claiming you're a
[15:34] Christian and you wouldn't be happy to
[15:36] see the Lord
[15:39] right it takes my breath away how do you
[15:43] what how does that even I mean it
[15:46] suddenly they see him and they don't
[15:49] Rejoice seeing him they whail because of
[15:53] him because that's when that's when they
[15:56] know for certain they've missed
[16:01] I and he says in verse eight I am Alpha
[16:03] and Omega the beginning and the ending
[16:07] sayeth the Lord which is and which was
[16:10] and which is to come the almighty how do
[16:13] you read those first eight verses and
[16:16] Come Away With A trinitarian or a
[16:17] Oneness thinking see so so when we when
[16:21] we look at it in that
[16:23] way you're you you you find out that
[16:27] that in that in this verse six you know
[16:30] Christ is is actually beginning to to
[16:35] show the church who she is she he's now
[16:39] living in her in verse six and hath made
[16:42] us Kings and Priests under God and so
[16:46] when we when we look at it that way you
[16:49] know I verse six is literally
[16:52] announcing that the cycle of the bride's
[16:55] Ministry has begun now it hadn't it
[16:59] didn't begin when John came back it it
[17:01] began in the upper room what when he
[17:03] comes back he's it's basically
[17:05] clarifying because brother brandham said
[17:07] that was the pattern for the whole
[17:08] church in that Upper Room experience the
[17:12] ministry of the son of man didn't end
[17:15] with Jesus it multiplied in the upper
[17:18] room and that was a Ministry of the son
[17:21] of man now don't confuse the ministry
[17:23] with the office the office of son of man
[17:24] is a prophet which they had Paul was on
[17:27] the scene but the ministry of the son of
[17:30] man kept going even after brother
[17:32] Brandon went home even after Paul went
[17:34] home the ministry of the son of man
[17:36] means the word now made
[17:39] flesh see so verse six now verse five
[17:43] the first five verses are going to very
[17:46] clearly depict who Christ is there can
[17:49] be no ambiguity no mistaking this is who
[17:52] he is this is who's talking John is
[17:55] using all you know the the Lord is
[17:57] saying now John
[17:58] I want you to write it like this when
[18:00] they read it there's going to be no
[18:02] doubt who it is talking to you when they
[18:06] read this they'll know it's me now after
[18:09] five verses and they get to verse six
[18:12] this is going to be uh an aha moment for
[18:15] the church to realize that the cycle of
[18:18] the bride's Ministry has now started
[18:23] because of a revelation of the word of
[18:26] God that's what happened in the upper
[18:27] room amen a revelation of the word of
[18:30] God when they you know they they T
[18:33] brother Bram said you know before it
[18:34] come and they had discussion well you
[18:36] know I had a feeling could that be it no
[18:37] I don't know we better wait well what
[18:39] about this well no we better wait and on
[18:41] after 10 days and here it come and then
[18:43] when they get outside and somebody
[18:46] misinterprets it by the word Peter
[18:49] quickly corrects it no no no this is not
[18:51] what you think it is this is not
[18:53] drunkenness this is not well you know
[18:55] all of those bad characteristics this is
[18:58] that which Joel
[19:00] prophesied so now that revelation of the
[19:03] word strikes thousands of them and they
[19:06] become baptized and filled with the holy
[19:08] spirit so the new birth it always comes
[19:12] by the revelation of the word not
[19:14] because you shook or shouted or jumped
[19:16] or ran or somebody even laid hands on
[19:19] you it might happen it might not it
[19:20] might this might happen you might not
[19:22] but one thing sure is it'll be a
[19:25] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[19:30] you and your life will then will then if
[19:34] you go into acts after acts 238 you you
[19:38] say how do we know they were born again
[19:40] of the spirit of God read verse 42 from
[19:43] there they continued in the apostles
[19:46] Doctrine the breaking of the bread
[19:48] prayers amen so the new birth begins to
[19:53] mold you into the image of the
[19:57] word so it's all about now announcing
[20:02] the cycle of the bride's Ministry has
[20:04] begun it's that's going to go all the
[20:06] way through Seven Ages it's going to
[20:08] bring back the last Eve who will not
[20:10] fail amen that's now that's the set time
[20:14] that we're
[20:16] in an eve who is predestinated not to
[20:20] fall then of course it'll be it as it's
[20:23] manifested in this last St then the
[20:25] kingdom of the Eternal Lord and his
[20:28] Christ that's Jesus and his bride the
[20:31] kingdom of the Lord and his Christ which
[20:33] is the restored Adam and Eve shall be
[20:35] established in the Earth forever and
[20:36] shall never be
[20:38] overthrown
[20:40] ever so we're glad for this yes so so
[20:45] now so brother brandham would say it
[20:47] like this in the church age book and uh
[20:51] the in the revelation of Jesus
[20:54] Christ he hath made us see as we read in
[20:59] in our in our and hath made us Kings and
[21:02] Priests brother Brandon picks that up he
[21:03] hath made us oh there are certain truths
[21:06] we need to emphasize this one of them he
[21:08] hath made us salvation is his doing
[21:12] salvation is of the lord it's all Grace
[21:15] he redeemed us for a purpose now that's
[21:17] where you really got to start to absorb
[21:20] he did this for a purpose it's not okay
[21:23] you're at an altar okay you're saved see
[21:25] you in
[21:27] heaven right see we are it is true we're
[21:30] going home on The Old Ship of Zion but
[21:32] he never told you to take your luggage
[21:34] go down to the docks and sit on your
[21:38] luggage he did it for a purpose we are
[21:42] Kings spiritual Kings oh we are going to
[21:45] be Kings upon the Earth with him when he
[21:47] sits on his throne that's in the
[21:48] Millennium that's where we read in
[21:49] Psalms 102 says but now we are spiritual
[21:54] Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual
[21:57] Kingdom says in Romans 5:17 for If by
[22:00] one man's offense death Reign by one
[22:01] much more they which receive abundance
[22:03] of Grace and of the gift of
[22:06] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[22:08] Jesus Christ Colossians
[22:10] 1:13 who hath delivered us from the
[22:13] power of darkness and hath translated us
[22:16] into the kingdom the reign of his dear
[22:19] son see it's the ministry of the son of
[22:22] man that's rulership that's reigning
[22:25] that's where the real Authority is where
[22:27] real power is and if you feel a little
[22:31] bit you know behind in how to make that
[22:33] work you're in good company brother
[22:35] branam struggled to understand it in
[22:38] fact is when he came to the scripture if
[22:40] you say to this mountain brother
[22:42] brandham admitted after the fact after
[22:44] he finally understood it he admitted
[22:46] openly in pull pits around the world he
[22:48] said I never would preach on that cuz I
[22:50] didn't understand it he said I the
[22:52] reason I couldn't understand is because
[22:53] I had always taught everything is in the
[22:56] atonement he says but he is saying that
[22:58] before the calvaries even and he says
[23:01] because because the problem is he's not
[23:03] saying Jesus isn't saying if I say he's
[23:05] saying if you say and brother Brenham is
[23:08] scratching his head and he said well I
[23:11] just made up my mind that if anybody
[23:13] asks me about that scripture I would
[23:15] just say well he said that before the
[23:19] atonement pretty good Baptist
[23:22] answer that's pretty good Baptist answer
[23:26] but but the Lord wasn't going to let him
[23:27] get by with that and he takes him into
[23:29] the woods you remember the squirrels and
[23:30] that happened in Kentucky and then I
[23:32] mean Indiana and a couple weeks later or
[23:34] maybe vice versa he's hunting you know
[23:36] the Reds and then the Grays and the Lord
[23:39] is just almost driving him
[23:41] insane and he he's making him let's
[23:44] let's talk about this and brother bam
[23:46] said you know I thought about that
[23:47] scripture if you say and and and there
[23:49] there Comes The Voice you know what are
[23:51] you doing I'm hunting hunting squirrel
[23:53] how many you need three say where
[23:54] they'll be and brother brandham he just
[23:56] almost if you go back back and listen to
[23:59] to brother bram's uh tale of that
[24:01] especially in one sermon escapes my mind
[24:03] right now if you can I can look it up
[24:05] for you if you want to know but but
[24:07] brother brandham just almost went crazy
[24:09] in those woods trying to get his mind
[24:11] wrapped around it and every time he
[24:13] thought he had it figured out he was
[24:15] wrong and the pressure and the
[24:19] anxiety before anxiety was a thing he
[24:22] was he was falling to pieces he's
[24:25] screaming out who are you
[24:28] what do you
[24:30] want that's what the way he describes it
[24:32] on tape he said usually I he's all
[24:34] Disturbed usually I see that light I
[24:36] don't see the light but I hear the voice
[24:38] who are you what do you want leave me
[24:42] alone but the Lord wouldn't leave him
[24:44] alone he was determined that he was
[24:47] going to get that and brother bradam
[24:48] said but I can't understand it because
[24:51] you're saying if I say and the Lord come
[24:54] down after weeks and weeks of nearly
[24:57] driving him to a breakdown the Lord just
[25:00] finally
[25:02] says you stand in these prayer lines and
[25:05] you know the very secrets of people's
[25:07] hearts you you think that's you that
[25:11] knows
[25:12] that and brother Braham thought wait a
[25:15] minute and he said you're able to tell
[25:17] the future and prophesy and things come
[25:18] to pass you think that's you doing that
[25:22] and brother brandham caught it and he
[25:24] said no Lord It's not me doing it it's
[25:29] you doing it through
[25:31] me and he said I realized at that moment
[25:35] that any son or daughter of God now
[25:37] here's the key here's the big old if
[25:39] it's only two letters but it's
[25:41] huge it any son and daughter of God if
[25:44] they're willing that they're that
[25:47] they're willing to live up in those
[25:51] atmospheres then they are the ones who
[25:53] will say to this mountain because it
[25:54] won't be you saying it it'll be him
[25:57] saying it and you're out of the way and
[25:59] he can finally get on with
[26:03] expression oh Lord give me fresh
[26:05] surrender
[26:07] today let my home let my life let my
[26:10] marriage let my family when the when we
[26:12] say we're going to apply the token that
[26:14] ought to mean
[26:16] something amen it's not a
[26:19] cliche when you apply something you
[26:21] bring it into
[26:23] contact and so if you want to apply the
[26:26] token to your children bring them into
[26:28] contact with the token amen
[26:31] see so so we find that that he he's
[26:35] saying we're Kings and Priests now right
[26:38] now we reign with Christ have dominion
[26:41] over sin the World the Flesh and the
[26:45] devil amen you know so we can show off
[26:49] no so we can look big no so so we can be
[26:53] the you know the best no showing forth
[26:57] his praise and glory showing forth
[27:02] himself not showing me showing him for
[27:06] it is Christ in US willing and doing of
[27:12] his good
[27:16] pleasure so we're in the age where the
[27:19] alpha has come the Omega has come back
[27:21] to the alpha this is the the ministry of
[27:24] the son of man that was that that
[27:26] Ministry was lost and it goes into the
[27:29] ministry of the Son of God because Jesus
[27:32] instead of being able to come back and
[27:33] get a bride and brother brandham said
[27:36] when he comes back he finds her a fallen
[27:38] woman just like Eve just like Jehovah
[27:41] found Israel Fallen they said we want a
[27:43] king and the prophet said but God is
[27:46] your king yeah we understand that just
[27:48] become a cliche to them he's our King
[27:49] but we want an actual King as if God
[27:52] wasn't an actual King and so so we find
[27:56] that that when he comes he instead of
[27:59] being able to take a bride in a Rapture
[28:02] Christ must sit down you know he must
[28:05] seal up the word in Seven Seals sit down
[28:08] in the eternities and start interceding
[28:10] for the ignorance of the people and this
[28:12] is why Luther could come along with
[28:14] partially false Doctrine Wesley could
[28:17] come along preaching trinitarianism
[28:19] which is a doctrine of demons those
[28:20] three unclean spirits like
[28:22] frogs and and we find that yet he was
[28:25] the messenger and the people who follow
[28:27] is messenger and part of the first
[28:28] resurrection because Christ is
[28:30] interceding for the ignorance just like
[28:32] Paul told the Jews there in the book of
[28:34] Acts I think chapter 13 or 16 I don't
[28:36] remember he said you know there was a
[28:39] time back there when you brought these
[28:40] animal sacrifices and God winked at your
[28:42] ignorance but now he requireth all men
[28:44] to repent the word is the fullness of
[28:47] the word is coming you got to come to
[28:49] the fullness of the word 1600 years of
[28:52] animal sacrifice we're done with that
[28:55] the ministry of the son of man is is to
[28:57] grow through a family so we find that
[29:01] we're in that age now where Christ in
[29:04] the alpha is the same in the Omega and
[29:08] and brother Brandon brother Aaron and I
[29:10] were talking about this in the back
[29:11] room where and if you want to find the
[29:14] references to this this is where brother
[29:15] Brandon when he was teaching on his
[29:16] Revelation series Revelation three
[29:18] Revelation four Revelation 5 and brother
[29:21] Bram is using an example in there of
[29:24] Christ standing in front of standing in
[29:27] front of a manora you know the seven
[29:29] golden lampstands that you see and he
[29:31] said and he's got his hands stretched
[29:33] out and this hand is hitting the first
[29:35] one and this hand is hitting the last
[29:37] one so he's in his fullness in the first
[29:40] and he's in his fullness again in the
[29:42] last he's the Alpha and the Omega the
[29:45] beginning and the ending the alpha the
[29:48] Omega brother bam says but he doesn't
[29:50] say anything about the
[29:52] middle now it's not that Christ wasn't
[29:55] in the midst of the seven lamps stands
[29:57] John saw him walking there and he saw
[30:00] him G about the pths with a golden G
[30:02] brother Ram said it's a woman it's the
[30:04] church covered and dressed in the Robes
[30:06] of of of righteousness of Christ and
[30:09] Jesus promised to never leave the church
[30:12] so certainly Jesus was in the middle
[30:15] it's just that not everything in the
[30:17] middle was now purely him brother
[30:20] brandham called it there had been an
[30:22] admixture of true and false it wasn't
[30:26] pure anymore yet yes he was there but
[30:28] now there's an ad mixture now there's
[30:30] two churches started out with one in the
[30:33] beginning in the alpha church every
[30:36] church was a message
[30:38] Church there was no such thing as a
[30:41] Christian Church that wasn't a message
[30:43] church and now we're the most minority
[30:46] in the world because of that ad mixture
[30:48] and because now he speaks to the
[30:50] churches and brother Brandon would say
[30:52] it's curious that he would say church is
[30:54] he says because we find that there's now
[30:56] a false Church impersonating the true
[30:58] church and even the true church he said
[31:02] is now losing losing those original
[31:05] feelings that she had even the True
[31:07] Churches starting he talks about that in
[31:09] the bitterness of of Smyrna and how that
[31:12] that bitterness was was was increasing
[31:14] so so you know when you begin at Ephesus
[31:18] now all right now I I I want to turn a
[31:21] corner and let's bring it home to our
[31:25] idea of marriage Wonder we good
[31:29] yes you're good I haven't lost anybody
[31:32] in the shuffle no all right praise the
[31:35] Lord if you got a question don't ask it
[31:37] till after I'm
[31:39] done so so when you
[31:43] begin at Ephesus as Ephesus
[31:47] did the Ephesus meant you know aimed at
[31:52] and
[31:53] relaxed now watch watch the the the the
[31:56] the process of this I would call it a
[31:59] dichotomy where you have the first age
[32:02] that starts out under the lion so pure
[32:05] but they begin to
[32:07] relax they begin to lose their
[32:10] fervency it they begin to
[32:13] decline and then by the time you get to
[32:16] the next age bitterness has set
[32:19] in and by the time you get to pergam
[32:21] that means marriage now they're now
[32:24] you've got an adulterous remarriage to a
[32:27] false
[32:28] husband so you see you see how that's
[32:31] working it's and and a lot of times
[32:33] that's how marriages will happen uh too
[32:36] often times you can begin as Ephesus did
[32:40] and the problem with Ephesus is that
[32:42] they started taking people into the
[32:44] church who weren't born again of the
[32:47] spirit of God as we said last night they
[32:50] just admired the fine qualities of Jesus
[32:54] and started calling themselves
[32:56] Christians he said they did that cuz
[32:58] that's what they were but it was just a
[33:00] mental thing it wasn't a real conversion
[33:03] and the and and that's how the church
[33:05] began to be diluted and and and and and
[33:08] then that that's how you end up it went
[33:10] off into apostasy and finally it's going
[33:12] to Crown a false prophet and the you
[33:14] know the seat where Satan's seat is and
[33:17] Jezebel religion and uh triple crown and
[33:20] oh my you know and and so but we're
[33:22] finding a pattern here that that when
[33:27] you go into a marriage first of all
[33:29] that's why brother Brandon would say
[33:32] pray yes be led of the spirit because
[33:37] that's the pattern at Ephesus to be a
[33:40] Christian you needed to be baptized you
[33:42] needed to repent be baptized and the
[33:44] promise was to you see and so you had
[33:47] the church birthed but even then you had
[33:50] people already hiding under the radar
[33:52] ananas and saf and different ones and
[33:55] people who walked for a while and Paul
[33:57] said later I tell you even weeping they
[33:59] have become enemies of the Cross you
[34:02] have people who started out so got so
[34:05] arrogant in their so-called Christianity
[34:08] that they were even criticizing Paul and
[34:11] resisting his teaching even John starts
[34:14] telling a story said there's this
[34:15] there's this man this pastor up here and
[34:18] he he doesn't receive my Ministry and he
[34:21] won't even allow his people to visit and
[34:24] he he tells everybody to stay away from
[34:26] me John says I'm going to go up there
[34:27] I'm going to deal with that guy so you
[34:30] already had the spirit of antichrist
[34:32] working in the churches and it was
[34:34] starting to decline even while the
[34:36] apostles were still alive you know they
[34:39] they're they're they're they're writing
[34:40] letters you know and sending it out we
[34:42] need to earnestly contend for the faith
[34:45] once delivered we're slipping we're
[34:47] seeing too much carnality what's going
[34:49] on everybody see so you had the gnostics
[34:53] moving in destroying the deity of Christ
[34:56] and it wasn't wasn't a real human and
[34:58] the reason they didn't want to believe
[34:59] he was a real human because if he was a
[35:01] real human and overcame by the word then
[35:02] that become incumbent upon them to do
[35:04] the same and they didn't want to do that
[35:07] and people don't want to do that so they
[35:08] make the new birth some kind of you know
[35:11] mental thing just a mental ascent and
[35:14] it's not to be that it's to be a living
[35:16] fiery experience
[35:19] amen and this is what marriages are to
[35:22] to be established on because Paul when
[35:25] he's saying you know husbands love your
[35:27] wives as exactly like Christ did well
[35:30] how'd you do it Paul well he gave
[35:31] himself for it you know and and and I
[35:35] remember I remember so clearly probably
[35:37] four or five years deep into my 42-year
[35:39] marriage sister Debbie and of course I
[35:42] loved her my and my love was genuine I
[35:44] loved her dearly and as we were saying
[35:46] last night I love her even more today so
[35:48] it proved it was real because it's
[35:50] grown but I remember four or five years
[35:53] into our marriage and I'm sitting there
[35:54] on a Sunday morning I'm got my my Bible
[35:57] open I'm dressed she's getting the boys
[35:59] dressed and getting as a mother would do
[36:02] uh except for my youngest son Chris you
[36:04] didn't dress him he dressed himself
[36:06] picked out his own clothes did his own
[36:07] thing and it was always perfect we never
[36:09] had a problem and um but that was Chris
[36:11] he has a little turbo you wake him up
[36:13] he's comes fully awake and he's ready to
[36:15] go that's Chris if you ever be around
[36:17] him he's my drummer if you ever see him
[36:19] on video he's he's great guy but uh
[36:22] she's back there busy getting the other
[36:24] two ready who really needed help
[36:27] oh boy they needed help and so I'm
[36:31] sitting there reading my Bible and I'm
[36:33] reading that passage husbands love your
[36:36] wives a and I thought yes amen praise
[36:39] the Lord love my wife as Christ loved
[36:42] whoa huh I didn't know that was there as
[36:46] Christ oh you're you're not just telling
[36:48] me to do it you're telling me how to go
[36:50] about
[36:51] it as Christ loved the church and gave
[36:55] himself for it
[36:58] and I I remember I just I sitting in my
[37:02] chair waiting we were going to go to
[37:03] church Sunday morning and I just had my
[37:07] Bible and I just laid my head back and I
[37:09] said Lord it started with a
[37:11] confession it started with repentance
[37:14] which is worthless if you don't make a
[37:16] change and I said Lord I've loved her
[37:19] she's my soulmate but I have never loved
[37:23] her like this there's still too much
[37:28] self-centeredness here and I made up my
[37:31] mind right then and my wife will testify
[37:33] it to this day it didn't happen
[37:35] overnight no lightning flashed I didn't
[37:37] suddenly go into a telephone booth and
[37:39] come out wearing a
[37:43] cape but I began the transition toward
[37:47] Zion I began to turn my eyes toward
[37:52] Heaven I begin to think about Christ and
[37:55] how he lived and and it and and and it
[37:58] and it wasn't perfect and it hasn't been
[38:00] Flawless but it's been steady and it's
[38:03] been sincere and I have said Lord I want
[38:07] to love her like you've loved me and
[38:10] there's one thing for sure you have
[38:13] expressed your love to me and I have no
[38:16] doubt you love me if you hadn't have I'd
[38:18] have been kicked to the curb a long time
[38:21] ago but God has loved me can you testify
[38:24] to that friends unworthy as we are the
[38:27] Lord has loved us
[38:28] anyway and and so so when when you when
[38:32] you realize then that that this was the
[38:35] process and that's why it says pray get
[38:39] a revelation from God because that's how
[38:41] the church started you see that parallel
[38:43] I'm sure you get that it was a parallel
[38:46] but what happened was is you started
[38:48] having people coming into the church who
[38:50] didn't do that you have people getting
[38:52] married who don't pray and get LED of
[38:54] the Holy Spirit see and so so this is
[38:57] why today divorce courts are filled uh
[39:00] brother Wes was telling me last night as
[39:02] a court reporter that was one of the
[39:03] things that dealt with the most was
[39:04] divorce far more than murders or robbery
[39:07] or anything like that it was always
[39:09] divorce see because it's all just a
[39:12] mental as we were saying last night just
[39:14] a mental agreement and so then what does
[39:17] that lead to then then what happens when
[39:20] when you get in a marriage like that it
[39:21] starts to
[39:23] cool and then a lot of times one or the
[39:25] other and it's really bad if both of
[39:27] them go to the second stage because the
[39:31] relationship has cooled now bitterness
[39:34] sets
[39:35] in resentment starts to build it's a
[39:38] bitterness of
[39:39] resentment and the next thing you know
[39:41] God forbid it leads to infidelity and
[39:44] you say well but we're Christians we're
[39:47] born again I did pray I believe I've got
[39:49] my eternal mate listen listen listen I'm
[39:51] telling you I have seen by
[39:54] experience thank God I haven't seen it
[39:56] often but in 35 years preaching this
[39:59] gospel on six of seven continents I've
[40:01] had my share of seeing couples who were
[40:05] I knew I knew they were Believers
[40:07] they're Believers to this day I knew
[40:10] that they they really did love one
[40:12] another and I knew that this was really
[40:15] I knew this was their Eternal mate but I
[40:17] watched the relationship cool and I
[40:20] watched bitterness grow and I watched
[40:24] unfaithfulness come from that
[40:27] Born Again people say could that happen
[40:30] say well uh you know and I know it's
[40:32] often said well brother M said my Holy
[40:34] Ghost would keep me from that so anybody
[40:36] that would do that could not possibly be
[40:38] born again well I you know I'm glad
[40:41] you've got such judgment Powers I don't
[40:42] I don't dare to to do that I let God
[40:45] decide that but I know this you say well
[40:47] he said the Holy Ghost would never my
[40:49] Holy Ghost would keep me from that well
[40:51] yeah no kidding of course he would the
[40:53] Holy Ghost is never going to go along
[40:54] with that he's never never going to
[40:56] agree to you living like that but
[40:58] neither is he going to force you see so
[41:01] of course he's not going to allow it but
[41:03] he's also not building
[41:05] robots and and there's there's penalty
[41:08] and you reap what you sow so so good so
[41:11] good seed and if you've swed Bad Seed do
[41:14] like do like Esther when there was no
[41:16] hope and the word couldn't be changed
[41:17] and Bad Seed the king had said it and
[41:19] they're all going to be killed and she
[41:21] goes to him you know change your word he
[41:23] says I'm a hazus I change not I can't
[41:26] change my word just like God she's the
[41:29] bride this is Christ he can't change his
[41:31] mind about his word he's already said
[41:33] whatsoever you sow that's what you're
[41:34] going to reap so well then what do I do
[41:36] it's all hopeless no it's not I'll make
[41:38] another law that on the day before that
[41:40] law comes into effect you can kill all
[41:43] of them who were going to kill you so so
[41:45] the the the good the new seed destroyed
[41:49] the effect of the of The Bad Seed when
[41:51] it was sown you say I've sown a lot of
[41:54] Bad Seed start sewing good seat over the
[41:57] top of
[41:58] it that works in both directions Jesus
[42:01] said by your Traditions you've caused
[42:03] the word of God to have no effect turn
[42:05] that on the devil turn that on the devil
[42:08] say y boy you got me to sow plenty of
[42:11] bad but today I'm sewing good and by the
[42:14] time that bad comes up I'll have so much
[42:16] good it'll destroy any effect you could
[42:18] have on my life amen
[42:21] amen see so so what happens then is is
[42:26] you know as they came to Christ mentally
[42:29] you know based on the bodily sensations
[42:31] of the human spirit in your flesh and
[42:34] you have an experience of something
[42:36] other than the heart connection to
[42:39] Christ and this opens you up to making
[42:41] the wrong choices for a mate which later
[42:43] ends in
[42:45] disappointment as I said can become
[42:47] bitterness can become
[42:48] infidelity now I realize today and I
[42:51] believe it with all my heart that I'm
[42:53] speaking largely to those who have the
[42:55] correct God L mate but the effects of
[43:00] disappointment can still work the same
[43:03] the effects of cooling in the
[43:04] relationship can work the same way and
[43:06] cause the same
[43:08] bitterness even if it's your Divine mate
[43:10] I've seen it
[43:12] happen sometimes you know there's all
[43:15] kinds of reasons why that can
[43:17] happen sometimes it's because maybe you
[43:21] know some some some
[43:23] active uh abuse perhaps I don't know
[43:26] maybe poor raising and misguided
[43:29] training in your childhood there's all
[43:32] kinds of reasons why people are closed
[43:34] up and can't let their expressions and
[43:36] let their love uh flow one to another
[43:39] it's a sad case maybe it was some
[43:41] misinterpreted theology from a previous
[43:44] Ministry you said under perhaps some
[43:46] maybe some trauma uh from a previous
[43:50] situation and then and then conversely
[43:53] you know maybe maybe not a an active
[43:56] abuse but maybe a passive lack a passive
[44:00] lack of intimacy and emotional neglect
[44:04] and this can also be from a collection
[44:06] of those exact same things leaving you
[44:08] with emotional wounds that that leave
[44:11] you afraid of deep
[44:13] feelings afraid of deep emotional
[44:16] relationships amen now y'all were
[44:18] shouting when we were in The Book of
[44:19] Revelation and all of that so don't go
[44:22] cold on me now see I did all that to set
[44:26] you
[44:27] up did all that to prove to you that
[44:30] you're supposed to be the image of the
[44:31] Son of God in the earth you're you're
[44:33] the continuation of his ministry and you
[44:35] said Amen to that don't take that amen
[44:39] back I'm going to tell you something
[44:41] friends it takes great
[44:43] humility great sincerity before God to
[44:46] admit to
[44:48] ourselves that whatever it is whatever
[44:51] it is that keeps us from following God's
[44:53] word and God's design it's the same as
[44:57] any other
[44:58] weakness wherein we won't let as Paul
[45:02] said we won't let the mind of Christ the
[45:06] mind that was in Christ operate in us
[45:10] see because the mind of Christ would
[45:12] heal you of that injury that trauma the
[45:16] Holy Ghost would teach you to be like
[45:19] Jesus how to release your love how to
[45:21] release your affection Jesus didn't have
[45:23] a problem with that and nobody got more
[45:25] abused than him
[45:27] nobody was done more dirty than him if
[45:30] you feel like you've been overcome and
[45:33] things have been so bad and uh you know
[45:36] just Paul said Just remember he who
[45:40] suffered such a contradiction of Sinners
[45:42] against himself lest you be faint lest
[45:45] you be wearied in your own mind and
[45:47] faint see you haven't suffered under
[45:50] blood you haven't went through what
[45:51] Christ did yet he continued to love
[45:54] continued to express it it wasn't just I
[45:56] love you no it was an expression of Love
[46:00] see so it doesn't matter you know what
[46:03] it is that's keeping you uh uh locked up
[46:06] and and afraid of deep feelings afraid
[46:08] of deep emotional relationships it's
[46:11] just the same as any flaw or error
[46:13] that's what he told to the Philippian
[46:15] church but it's also the same error
[46:17] within yourself that you won't as Paul
[46:19] said to the colossian church let the
[46:22] word dwell in you richly amen let it
[46:27] allow it permit it cuz God's not going
[46:31] to force you you understand it's he's a
[46:34] gentleman he doesn't do that you've got
[46:36] to let the mind which was in Christ be
[46:39] in you you've got to allow the word to
[46:42] dwell in you
[46:45] richly you know it's a terrible
[46:47] transgression of
[46:49] selfishness and self-centeredness that
[46:52] allows it to keep
[46:54] going and and molding our negative
[46:57] actions or the lack of our positive
[47:00] actions that build
[47:02] up don't don't don't despise it as small
[47:05] things you might say well I'm not doing
[47:07] all kinds of negative things well are
[47:08] you failing to do the positive things
[47:11] there there you're you're in
[47:12] construction you're to be building up
[47:14] the body of Christ Stone upon Stone amen
[47:17] amen word upon word line upon line see
[47:21] so so and and to me friends the thing
[47:24] that makes selfishness and
[47:27] self-centeredness and I want you to
[47:28] notice the the word the the the word
[47:31] that stands like a beacon at the
[47:33] beginning of those two words
[47:37] selfishness self
[47:41] centeredness the things that the thing
[47:43] that makes selfishness and
[47:47] self-centeredness so egregious to God is
[47:50] that he was so willing to pay such a
[47:53] ransom for you amen
[47:56] Jesus Paid listen young people GE don't
[48:00] be ashamed of the Gospel Jesus Paid a
[48:03] horrible price on your behalf he
[48:06] suffered such a contradiction of Sinners
[48:09] against himself the contradiction of
[48:12] trading the innocent for the guilty
[48:15] that's hard to
[48:17] handle Jesus who was innocent and God
[48:21] swapped him for all of us guilty Sinners
[48:25] amen amen and brother brandham said God
[48:29] condemned him as a sinner and sent him
[48:32] to hell and the whole reason he did that
[48:34] is so you would never have to go
[48:37] there don't ever lose sight of that you
[48:39] young men young women don't ever lose
[48:41] sight about the price he paid for your
[48:44] Redemption for your claim I remember one
[48:47] time I was in in
[48:50] um um I think I was in the
[48:54] Ukraine one one of those countries might
[48:57] have been Russia but I or bellarus I
[48:59] think we were in Ukraine and um we were
[49:02] at meetings there
[49:03] and brother Eugene and I and um I don't
[49:08] remember if brother Barry was there at
[49:09] that time his early days and uh brother
[49:11] Eugene and I and I think brother Lonnie
[49:13] we went up to into the town to because
[49:16] there was only one place in everywhere
[49:20] that had uh a working phone that you
[49:22] could call
[49:24] overseas and so um we went up there and
[49:27] I remember the young woman it was some I
[49:29] think it was like um an insurance office
[49:31] or maybe and she was you know she had
[49:33] her desk there as you to greet you as
[49:35] you come in she was the secretary and
[49:36] what more so she knew who we were we
[49:38] were preachers and the minister had went
[49:40] with us and explained you know in
[49:42] Russian that we were there to try to
[49:43] call
[49:45] home and uh a very attractive young
[49:47] woman and really bubbly and happy which
[49:51] was unusual to find in that area most of
[49:53] them had just come out of you know under
[49:55] from under the Iron Curtain they're very
[49:56] solemn and they didn't Express
[49:58] themselves that's one of the things we
[49:59] struggled with in in early days there in
[50:02] Russia and Ukraine is you rejoice in the
[50:05] word of God and they just set stoically
[50:07] no matter what you said you couldn't I
[50:09] mean you would move Heaven and Earth it
[50:11] wouldn't matter they just set because
[50:12] and I realized that for 40 years they
[50:14] had been trained to just sit stoic and
[50:17] not express yourself you don't act out
[50:19] in public you don't act you don't you
[50:21] don't shout at a ball game you don't
[50:23] shout in church you don't shout on the
[50:24] street you don't do anything and if you
[50:26] did and boy did they get a load of
[50:28] brother
[50:29] Eugene oh my goodness as soon as he got
[50:31] out of the van and he heard an echo we
[50:33] were all these buildings and he said
[50:35] praise the Lord and he heard an echo
[50:36] praise the Lord the Lord Lord Eugene
[50:39] said glory glory glory and they're
[50:43] like you like whoow I said hey Cowboy
[50:46] you better take a volume or something
[50:48] you're you're not going to you're going
[50:50] to be in trouble here and so um we
[50:54] walked in and
[50:55] so she was bubbly and turns out that she
[50:59] spoke just a little bit of English and
[51:01] she was kind of wanting to show off a
[51:03] little bit here's some Americans I want
[51:04] to show off my English and uh she's got
[51:07] this burbly bubbly you know almost an
[51:10] American personality already and uh she
[51:14] starts bragging about her night out on
[51:17] the town and how she was still a little
[51:19] tipsy because she had a little too much
[51:21] to drink and whoopee and she was having
[51:23] a good time and she saw that we weren't
[51:25] w't amused by that and she knew that we
[51:27] were ministers and uh and and I just you
[51:31] know I just I began to speak to her
[51:33] because I can hardly keep quiet in times
[51:35] like that and I said well you know
[51:38] Sister maybe you should uh consider you
[51:41] know what the consequences of that might
[51:43] be and my goodness you could tell
[51:45] somebody had said something like that to
[51:47] her before and she just immediately
[51:48] threw up her hand my body my body she
[51:52] didn't want to hear this my
[51:54] body and and I just looked her in the
[51:56] eye and I said who in the world told you
[52:01] that you built
[52:03] it you can keep it
[52:06] alive and if your breath left your body
[52:09] you wouldn't be
[52:11] dead who told you it was your body let
[52:14] me tell you about somebody who owns your
[52:16] body and that's the Son of God who died
[52:18] to redeem you and therefore he owns you
[52:21] you do not own yourself and you owe your
[52:23] life to him otherwise going to die
[52:27] am and and a lot of times this is the
[52:30] this is how self-centeredness works it's
[52:32] it's all about me and it's really
[52:34] supposed to be all about him and you
[52:36] know you say well I'm not doing anything
[52:38] wrong well are you actively doing things
[52:40] right you're supposed to be building
[52:43] supposed to be building up see you say
[52:45] well I I I I can't get over the wound
[52:47] Christ can get you over it the Lord can
[52:50] get you over it that's what he want he
[52:52] wants to do that that's what the word is
[52:55] for for he sent his word and healed the
[52:58] people
[53:00] see so how in the world then can we
[53:03] countenance selfishness and
[53:05] self-centeredness in our lives or in our
[53:08] marriages and claim to be
[53:12] Believers how do husbands not love their
[53:15] wives by demonstration of the Holy
[53:17] Spirit and claim to be a believer how do
[53:19] wives not reverence their husband and
[53:21] claim to be a believer very good see so
[53:24] it's like I said last night too many
[53:26] husbands have failed to leave father and
[53:28] mother and cleave only under their wife
[53:30] and too many wives have never accepted
[53:33] the word that their desire was to be to
[53:36] their husband and whatever his dreams
[53:39] and his goals she doesn't even keep her
[53:41] name she's to surrender to his
[53:44] leadership see and so so you know you
[53:48] can stack it any way you want friends
[53:50] but marriage as designed by God in the
[53:53] beginning it's just a microcosm of the
[53:56] relationship between Christ and his
[53:58] church I said it last night I've started
[54:00] to say it several times here today let
[54:02] me finally get it out when Paul is is
[54:04] talking about you know how that we are
[54:07] to conduct ourselves and uh you know how
[54:12] it's not just a thought that I'm going
[54:13] to have uh this is this is supposed to
[54:16] become a reality in our lives so so when
[54:21] we when we think about how that it's
[54:23] supposed it's just a mic rosm of the
[54:26] relationship between Christ and his
[54:28] church Paul Paul says gives you those
[54:32] instructions and he basically comes down
[54:35] from that made this point last night he
[54:36] comes down from there and he and I'm
[54:38] just going to add live a little bit and
[54:41] and paraphrase the scripture you know
[54:43] now what I was
[54:45] saying about husbands loving your wives
[54:48] and demonstration wives are reverencing
[54:50] your husband I really meant it now don't
[54:52] don't overs spiritualize what I'm about
[54:54] to say and not do that I want you to
[54:58] catch a but I'm really speaking of a
[55:00] great
[55:02] mystery that what you are is a model of
[55:05] what he and his church are but don't get
[55:07] so Heavenly minded that you forget your
[55:09] Earthly duties I really meant what I
[55:12] said husbands really do that wives
[55:15] really do that but understand and and
[55:18] understanding is half the battle because
[55:21] once you and then the other half is is
[55:23] always application once you understand
[55:25] the word of God then you become
[55:27] responsible to apply it and when you
[55:29] apply it it
[55:31] works it can restore broken marriages it
[55:34] can take away bitterness and resentment
[55:38] it can restore fervency and love between
[55:41] that couple see that's the that's that's
[55:45] the first thing you have to own if your
[55:47] marriage is in trouble is that weakness
[55:51] in your marriage signifies weakness in
[55:53] your relationship with the Holy Spirit
[55:55] spirit
[55:55] [Music]
[55:57] amen just going to let that one sink a
[56:00] minute weakness in your marriage
[56:03] signifies weakness in your relationship
[56:06] with the Holy Spirit that's right and
[56:09] that's the first thing you have to own
[56:12] if your marriage is in trouble or even
[56:14] if you sense hindrances to all that God
[56:17] has purposed in your relationship say my
[56:20] relationship is fine it's going along
[56:22] but can you really say when you get on
[56:23] your knees and you're talking to the
[56:25] Lord and nobody else is around can you
[56:27] really say Lord every purpose that you
[56:29] have designed for my home and my
[56:31] marriage and my life Lord I'm hitting on
[56:34] all cylinders if you can't say that then
[56:36] you need to start work say oh I need to
[56:38] go to I need to go to marriage
[56:39] counseling to get my marriage fixed you
[56:41] do need marriage counseling from here
[56:44] because what you need fixed is inside
[56:46] here and I'm not discrediting what
[56:49] outside sources can do to help but all
[56:51] that can do is help the mental and we're
[56:55] not we don't love Christ by mental we
[56:57] don't I don't love my wife by mental
[56:59] nobody forced me to love her I can't not
[57:01] love
[57:02] her I know it's a double negative but I
[57:05] can't not love her see it it's it's it's
[57:08] like the like the snowball that rolls
[57:10] starts rolling down the hill after a
[57:13] while you can't stop it anymore after a
[57:16] while it'll roll you right over you
[57:18] can't stop it or even stay ahead of it
[57:20] and this is this is how love is supposed
[57:22] to go forward and upward onward and
[57:24] upward it's supposed to end in Psalms
[57:27] 102 with Zion being the glory of God and
[57:32] all the world comes in to bring to
[57:35] recognize their Glory of of Christ
[57:38] recognize the glory of Christ in his
[57:41] family yes amen I want to say to you

[1:01:31] know if it was true or not I think they
[1:01:33] were telling it as a true
[1:01:35] story elderly man and woman been married
[1:01:38] many many years 60 plus years I think
[1:01:41] sitting on their rocking chairs on the
[1:01:43] front porch
[1:01:45] rocking and uh the the the lady you know
[1:01:48] in her age her hearing had gone bad and
[1:01:51] so she didn't hear so well I think it's
[1:01:52] down like 20% hearing
[1:01:55] and the husband is rocking beside her
[1:01:57] and he just starts gazing over at her
[1:01:58] and he just starts thinking about you
[1:02:00] know poor thing you know must be hard
[1:02:03] lose your hearing and my she's been such
[1:02:05] a faithful woman she raised my kids she
[1:02:09] cooked my meals and man he his heart
[1:02:11] just began to swell with love and
[1:02:15] affection he just felt such a compassion
[1:02:17] almost like back in it felt like he
[1:02:19] loved her like a teenager again my what
[1:02:22] a woman and he he turned to her and he
[1:02:25] said dear I'm so proud of you and she
[1:02:29] says what' you say and he said I I I
[1:02:32] said I'm proud of you what' you say I I
[1:02:36] I said I'm proud of you I'm tired of you
[1:02:39] [Laughter]
[1:02:45] too I have to break you up a little bit
[1:02:47] you're starting to go into vapor lock on
[1:02:49] me with all of this and
[1:02:51] so but we we were warned in the
[1:02:53] scripture
[1:02:55] we can't
[1:02:57] blame anyone you can't even blame the
[1:03:00] devil we were warned in the scripture
[1:03:02] that we were sometimes Darkness but now
[1:03:05] are you light in the Lord walk as
[1:03:07] children of light for the fruit of the
[1:03:09] spirit is in all goodness and
[1:03:11] righteousness and Truth proving what is
[1:03:14] acceptable you see it's proving it it's
[1:03:17] bringing glory to God you're proving the
[1:03:20] word you can say anything but but live a
[1:03:23] ser
[1:03:24] yes the the people will argue with your
[1:03:27] theology but they can't argue with your
[1:03:30] life
[1:03:31] see prove what is acceptable unto the
[1:03:35] Lord how you oh my but my my my
[1:03:38] situation is so bad well you warned to
[1:03:41] have no fellowship with the unfruitful
[1:03:43] works of
[1:03:45] darkness oh I I I you know I I can't I'm
[1:03:48] too wounded this this that or the other
[1:03:49] we that's the works of darkness but
[1:03:52] rather reprove them how do I reprove
[1:03:54] them I go rebuke them slap them around
[1:03:55] no you shine the light you live the
[1:03:58] light you you be like Christ who was the
[1:04:01] light and the life and and God so loved
[1:04:05] the world Jesus literally lived that
[1:04:11] sermon for it is a it is a shame even to
[1:04:15] speak of those things which are done of
[1:04:16] them in secret but all things that are
[1:04:18] reproved are made manifest by the light
[1:04:21] for whatsoever doth make manifest is
[1:04:23] light wherefore he saith awake thou that
[1:04:26] sleepest and arise from the dead and
[1:04:30] Christ shall give thee light if you're
[1:04:31] willing to do that he's willing to do
[1:04:33] that
[1:04:34] see brother brandham and and he cares do
[1:04:37] you care and he says oh and took a whole
[1:04:41] sermon does he
[1:04:43] care does he care brother brandham goes
[1:04:47] all the way back in the Old Testament
[1:04:48] and just takes a journey through the
[1:04:50] scriptures does he care look how he
[1:04:52] cared in this life and in this life and
[1:04:54] this sister and this brother and he goes
[1:04:56] on and goes to the New Testament showing
[1:04:57] and proving that he cares and he even
[1:05:00] comes into the modern day and tells a
[1:05:02] story of a young man who was treating
[1:05:03] his his wife wrong and there was a a
[1:05:06] breach and he had just they they had
[1:05:08] just left so happy and the and the man
[1:05:10] had something happen in his mind and he
[1:05:13] had a he had some kind of complex that's
[1:05:15] that raised its ugly head it hadn't been
[1:05:17] dealt with and he comes back and the man
[1:05:20] was just despondent the marriage was
[1:05:22] over and the relationship was done and
[1:05:24] they didn't even know what to do but
[1:05:25] brother Brandon begins to pray and the
[1:05:27] Lord come on the scene and healed that
[1:05:29] man and and turned it around and took
[1:05:32] that complex away and he said see Jesus
[1:05:34] cared about that young
[1:05:36] man he cared he'll care for you today
[1:05:40] brother Brenham said but you got to care
[1:05:43] first if you care then he'll care if
[1:05:47] you're here today say Lord I care enough
[1:05:49] I want a new purging I want my whole
[1:05:51] life to be like you I want I want to
[1:05:53] live I want to bring you glory if you
[1:05:55] care enough to do that if you care
[1:05:57] enough to say forgive me of all my wrong
[1:05:59] ways and my wrong thinking and let my
[1:06:02] life be taken over by you then he'll
[1:06:04] care enough to do
[1:06:09] it see that you walk circumspectly not
[1:06:12] as fools but as wise Redeeming the time
[1:06:16] because the days are evil the days are
[1:06:19] so evil friends that there there's
[1:06:21] hardly a there's hardly a place for for
[1:06:24] you to go out into the world and be
[1:06:26] anything other than the love of
[1:06:29] God the days are so evil it's the
[1:06:31] world's already got it hard enough as it
[1:06:33] is without God's family being trapped up
[1:06:36] in this kind of
[1:06:38] stuff so you know the question becom he
[1:06:41] says
[1:06:43] wherefore be you not
[1:06:47] unwise I'm coming this this could be
[1:06:50] part of my final admonition to you today
[1:06:52] before I
[1:06:53] close
[1:06:54] be therefore be ye not
[1:06:57] unwise but understanding what the will
[1:07:00] of the Lord is see so you know where are
[1:07:05] you going to hide
[1:07:07] now what what what's your what excuse
[1:07:11] will you give yourself what pass will
[1:07:14] you give yourself
[1:07:16] now after hearing this sermon just this
[1:07:20] one and all I've done is confirm to you
[1:07:23] things you already know
[1:07:25] and I can say as Paul I mean there would
[1:07:26] be some some pull pits I would go to
[1:07:29] where I feel like I got to almost
[1:07:30] rebuild the foundation and for I could
[1:07:32] even get in anywhere this don't this
[1:07:33] ain't one of them pull pits you're
[1:07:36] wellfed yeah like Paul said you have no
[1:07:38] need that I teach you anything you you
[1:07:40] yourselves already know I'm here to stir
[1:07:42] you up by way of remembrance by way of
[1:07:45] remembrance you know these things are
[1:07:46] true you've said here and raised hands
[1:07:48] and said amen along with me because we
[1:07:51] know this is true yeah I want to own it
[1:07:55] yes
[1:07:58] Hallelujah we forget sometimes that in
[1:08:02] blaming everything and everybody else we
[1:08:04] have seen the enemy and it is
[1:08:07] us tell you something friends it starts
[1:08:10] with repentance from your
[1:08:13] heart and repentance is more than just
[1:08:15] saying I'm sorry repentance from the
[1:08:19] heart is a pledge to God that you will
[1:08:23] begin
[1:08:24] today to let Christ be the Lord of all
[1:08:28] your life all your feelings all your
[1:08:32] emotions come on Saints how many are
[1:08:35] willing to take that
[1:08:37] Journey he can fix anything if he's
[1:08:39] given full sway I want to say to you
[1:08:42] today the Holy Spirit made me write this
[1:08:44] in my notes he wants to fix
[1:08:48] it I'm here to tell you he wants to fix
[1:08:51] it because he knows here's why he knows
[1:08:55] that in repairing your marriages he
[1:08:58] repairs his relationship with you see
[1:09:02] and that's what he's really been after
[1:09:05] all
[1:09:06] along my burden today is not to call you
[1:09:10] to a New Birth by the Holy Ghost but to
[1:09:13] say that the Holy Ghost is a fire that
[1:09:17] needs to be burning in our
[1:09:20] lives it needs to be a it needs to be
[1:09:24] affecting rather than being affected you
[1:09:27] remember you remember brother Brandon
[1:09:30] when he and I'm I'm I'm going to close
[1:09:33] right here
[1:09:37] um the musicians can return let me just
[1:09:39] close right here have our musicians and
[1:09:42] song leader come
[1:09:45] back brother brandham and standing in
[1:09:47] the
[1:09:48] Gap real dose of humility for the
[1:09:51] prophet begins to MIT you know his own
[1:09:55] breakdown and his own feelings and his
[1:09:57] own hurts remember that to the to the
[1:10:01] degree that he got like Jeremiah he just
[1:10:03] said I just don't even I don't even want
[1:10:05] to do what I'm doing anymore I just want
[1:10:07] to go back into the Wilderness be a
[1:10:09] Trapper and if the Lord gives me a word
[1:10:11] I'll come out of the Wilderness like
[1:10:13] Elijah and I'll give it to the people
[1:10:15] and I'll turn on my heels and go back
[1:10:17] people had done that to him he was a Man
[1:10:20] Who Loved
[1:10:21] people he was a man who cared about
[1:10:25] people and to have given his whole life
[1:10:27] that's hard to endure you've you've
[1:10:29] given so much and people have thrown it
[1:10:31] back in your face that's hard to endure
[1:10:33] those are the scars that
[1:10:35] pastors
[1:10:37] endure pastors never
[1:10:40] really have a problem if you have a
[1:10:45] problem just because you have a problem
[1:10:47] that doesn't make you a problem to the
[1:10:49] pastor people say I'm sorry I've been
[1:10:51] such a problem you haven't been a
[1:10:52] problem
[1:10:54] as long as you're not one of those who
[1:10:56] has a problem and wants to keep your
[1:10:58] problem then that's a
[1:11:02] problem and those are the things that
[1:11:05] wound so deeply when you when you spend
[1:11:08] so much of yourself and you're spend and
[1:11:10] willing to be spent and then have that
[1:11:11] thrown back in your face it's hard to
[1:11:13] endure and brother brandham had just had
[1:11:16] had had enough of it like Jeremiah I'm
[1:11:18] done I don't want to preach anymore you
[1:11:21] know and uh God took him on a
[1:11:25] journey remember he showed him that man
[1:11:28] that looked like Fletch and he showed
[1:11:30] him that burning dump along the side of
[1:11:32] the road remember that remember telling
[1:11:34] that I mean you know think of think of
[1:11:37] the think of what God showed
[1:11:40] him a smoldering dump that's a if you've
[1:11:44] ever been around a smoldering dump it's
[1:11:45] not a place you want to be it stinks the
[1:11:49] things that already stink when they're
[1:11:51] smoldering they really stink
[1:11:54] and everything is just strewn it's just
[1:11:56] wreckage CU nobody cares it's just all
[1:11:58] the refu and
[1:12:00] garbage and I'm going to tell you
[1:12:02] something friends now it's
[1:12:05] smoldering there's smoke proving there's
[1:12:07] fire but nobody wants to be around there
[1:12:10] it's not like a bonfire where you say
[1:12:13] hey hey y'all this Friday night this
[1:12:15] Saturday we're going to have a bonfire
[1:12:18] man everybody gets excited everybody's
[1:12:20] drawn to that they want to man it's a
[1:12:22] bonfire wow there's nothing negative
[1:12:24] about it it's all positive yippee let's
[1:12:27] build it
[1:12:28] bigger see because a blazing fire like
[1:12:31] that is a positive thing a smoldering
[1:12:35] fire that's just not hardly it's just
[1:12:36] burning barely enough just to smell bad
[1:12:39] nobody wants to be around
[1:12:41] that and brother brandom said if you
[1:12:43] carry out your plan this is what this is
[1:12:46] your
[1:12:47] future and brother brandom said I I
[1:12:49] stood there and I thought he said I was
[1:12:51] cold and I looked out into that dark
[1:12:53] dark Ness and he said I thought think I
[1:12:55] used to preach to
[1:12:57] thousands now here I
[1:12:59] am a smoldering
[1:13:03] dump and the image of Fletch and that's
[1:13:07] all I'm ever going to amount
[1:13:09] to but God didn't want that for his
[1:13:11] Prophet but brother brandham had to
[1:13:15] choose if you say well could he have
[1:13:18] chosen otherwise of course he could have
[1:13:20] although God knew he
[1:13:22] wouldn't Abraham could have chose not to
[1:13:24] believe but brother brandham said God
[1:13:26] knew he would accept it otherwise he
[1:13:28] never gave him the unconditional
[1:13:30] Covenant he would have made it
[1:13:31] conditional in case he ever changed his
[1:13:33] mind but he knew Abraham would believe
[1:13:35] it so brother Ram said he would have
[1:13:36] never gave him that kind of
[1:13:37] unconditional Covenant except he already
[1:13:39] knew Abraham would believe
[1:13:41] it he knew brother Brandon would make
[1:13:43] the right choice but yet brother
[1:13:44] brandham still had to make
[1:13:46] it he had to be willing to come back for
[1:13:50] healing and be restored he had to be
[1:13:52] willing to be to the bride what she
[1:13:56] needed him to be husbands wives children
[1:14:00] families churches this is a collection
[1:14:02] of families that's what a church is
[1:14:04] you're going to have to be spiritually
[1:14:06] healthy you want a spiritual church amen
[1:14:08] you want a spiritual church you got to
[1:14:10] have spiritual families amen and the
[1:14:12] only way to get spiritual families is to
[1:14:14] have heart experiences with the Holy
[1:14:16] Ghost and be up be a bonfire don't be a
[1:14:19] smoldering dump be a bonfire be
[1:14:22] something that is helpful to people and
[1:14:25] attracts people amen we are Kings over
[1:14:29] the flesh we are Kings over the world we
[1:14:32] are Kings over the devil amen do you
[1:14:34] believe that we are Kings over sin amen
[1:14:37] there's nothing that can hinder you if
[1:14:40] you're willing to let go as they say and
[1:14:43] let God Amen let's bow our
[1:14:47] heads father I thank you that I was able
[1:14:50] to
[1:14:51] conclude my thought today got all the
[1:14:53] way down to the bottom of my notes
[1:14:55] father feel unburdened
[1:14:57] now and I Lord we thank you we Rejoice
[1:15:01] Lord the the first half of the sermon
[1:15:04] was just to establish to the people who
[1:15:06] they are and the position they carry and
[1:15:08] what the responsibility is and what
[1:15:10] Christ has done for us and then and then
[1:15:12] what how does that become incumbent upon
[1:15:14] us and we rejoiced in it Lord but then
[1:15:17] we had to come down where we live
[1:15:20] and you know find these areas is where
[1:15:23] you come to our address and you deal
[1:15:25] with our hearts and you deal with our
[1:15:27] lives and Lord it becomes like this it
[1:15:30] becomes more somber it becomes more
[1:15:33] thoughtful it becomes more sincere and I
[1:15:36] think that it ought to be that way we
[1:15:39] need to think like David think on our
[1:15:43] ways brother brandom talks about your
[1:15:46] servant
[1:15:48] David when he said I thought on my ways
[1:15:50] he said David
[1:15:52] knew that he had made God an awful lot
[1:15:54] of
[1:15:55] promises but he hadn't really kept them
[1:15:58] very well and it bothered
[1:16:00] him I thought as I thought on my ways he
[1:16:04] thought about all those promises all
[1:16:06] those bold declarations all that the
[1:16:09] determination that he never put wheels
[1:16:11] to he never really had kept it never saw
[1:16:14] it through to a
[1:16:17] conclusion and it bothered him and he
[1:16:19] said I've turned my feet toward the lord
[1:16:23] I pray that it be today Lord God let us
[1:16:26] think on our ways and see where we
[1:16:28] measure up according to the word we've
[1:16:29] heard today we love and we Rejoice being
[1:16:32] a part of it but what does that
[1:16:35] mean it's got to mean something lord
[1:16:38] it's not just you're not just here to
[1:16:39] entertain us you're here to mold us and
[1:16:43] make us and if we'll care enough you'll
[1:16:47] care cuz you're the only one who can do
[1:16:50] it anyway we can't fix ourselves but we
[1:16:53] we've got to at least care and we've got
[1:16:55] to at least be honest and we've got to
[1:16:57] at least be like David and think on our
[1:17:00] ways and acknowledge our shortcomings
[1:17:02] before you raise up our hands and
[1:17:05] surrender and say Lord God have your way
[1:17:07] in my life have your way in my life Lord
[1:17:10] God show me Lord H show me yourself more
[1:17:15] clearly let me see your movements let me
[1:17:18] be fervent let me be near you let my
[1:17:20] life be filled with sincerity we're
[1:17:22] almost home
[1:17:23] it's almost over this is the only chance
[1:17:27] we'll have to lay up Treasures for that
[1:17:29] life the only opportunity we'll have to
[1:17:31] live for
[1:17:32] you the Earth
[1:17:34] Lord
[1:17:37] Humanity coming to the end of 6,000 year
[1:17:42] journey in a fallen Condition it's
[1:17:45] almost over lord mankind will never walk
[1:17:48] the earth again and that new heavens and
[1:17:51] that new Earth
[1:17:54] ungodliness will never again walk the
[1:17:56] surface of this Earth I want to be part
[1:17:59] of that
[1:18:00] Lord I I look forward to that I want to
[1:18:03] be part of that unfolding hidden Mana to
[1:18:06] where he and that word someday will
[1:18:08] become what you never dreamed
[1:18:11] possible I know that involves me I know
[1:18:13] I'm part of that there's some type of
[1:18:15] burgeoning that lays ahead for us all
[1:18:18] and I I want to be in that number I want
[1:18:22] my family to be in that number I want my
[1:18:25] spouse I want my children I want this
[1:18:28] church I want all my loved ones Lord God
[1:18:31] don't let me get in the way help me Lord
[1:18:34] God to surrender me so that you can be
[1:18:38] that bright and Shining Light I commit
[1:18:40] it into your
[1:18:42] hands in Jesus name amen amen
