[0:00] or continue on the subject of judgment
[0:02] and rewards this is part four my title
[0:05] tonight is responsibility and I know
[0:08] this is maybe not a catchy catchy title
[0:11] or something with a little Sizzle to it
[0:12] but we want to address this subject of
[0:15] responsibility under that this title and
[0:17] this subject of responsibility under
[0:20] um this overall theme of judgment and
[0:22] rewards now as just a quick review a few
[0:25] things I want to remind us of that we've
[0:27] already looked at already we begin with
[0:29] the next step and that kind of tied us
[0:32] into what we were talking about through
[0:33] the year in preview and these six things
[0:36] that we should be doing faithfully and I
[0:37] hope these things are being rehearsed in
[0:39] your hearts over and over again of
[0:40] things that you can do to be faithful
[0:42] but the last two Services were on the
[0:44] gift and condemnation and I believe it
[0:46] was a necessary Foundation to properly
[0:49] motivate the believer's efforts to
[0:51] please God bam talks about how that we
[0:54] ought to God rewards all of our efforts
[0:56] to please him and so we can't have the
[0:58] order wrong to where I'm trying to
[1:00] please him so he'll save me but rather
[1:02] having been saved I want to please them
[1:04] all that I can and God is so gracious
[1:07] that even though we labor to please him
[1:09] because of the grace that we received he
[1:11] still wants to give us more when we've
[1:13] labored for him that's what we've been
[1:15] looking at is the difference between a
[1:17] reward for laboring for him and the gift
[1:20] which is eternal life the Holy Ghost the
[1:22] new birth all those things being the
[1:23] same and a reward is something given in
[1:26] payment for labor or worthy Behavior
[1:28] this reward that is given for worthy
[1:30] Behavior or for labor is God's incentive
[1:33] that he holds out to the believer that's
[1:35] what brother bam talks about in the
[1:36] church age book but a gift on the other
[1:38] hand is something that is voluntarily
[1:40] given without payment expected in return
[1:42] a gift is not purchased it's not earned
[1:45] that's the free gift of Salvation it's
[1:48] the free gift of faith it's the free
[1:49] gift of grace these are things that we
[1:52] receive by God's gift and so there is
[1:55] that's where there's a difference of the
[1:57] Eternal rewards available to the
[1:58] believer and the gift of God's salvation
[2:00] Nation so when we talk about rewards
[2:02] judgment and rewards and the Judgment
[2:05] for a reward we don't want to confuse
[2:07] that at all with the gift that God gives
[2:09] us and even with the blessings that God
[2:11] gives us and things that God blesses and
[2:12] induce people with certain gifts and God
[2:14] pours out his spirit in meetings and
[2:16] Gifts can manifest themselves and those
[2:18] blessings are one thing but these
[2:20] rewards are something different and
[2:22] because it's such a maybe not a familiar
[2:24] subject to us I feel that just having
[2:26] that necessary foundation and maybe
[2:28] always going back and pointing to it say
[2:29] don't confuse it don't confuse it it'll
[2:32] be good to have that we use the
[2:33] scripture Romans chapter 8 verse 1 there
[2:36] is therefore now no condemnation to them
[2:39] which are in Christ Jesus who walked not
[2:42] after the flesh but after the spirit so
[2:45] there is now no condemnation that is no
[2:48] separation there's no Eternal separation
[2:51] from God there's no Specter of judgment
[2:53] the white Throne is completely erased
[2:54] from your future there is not going to
[2:56] be any future Judgment of the Bride that
[2:59] can result in punishment it says there's
[3:01] thou now no condemnation when you've
[3:03] passed from death into life and there is
[3:05] no condemnation that means you do not
[3:07] have to fear standing in the place where
[3:10] a possible outcome is
[3:12] eternal separation from God because you
[3:14] already have eternal life you can't be
[3:15] separated from them you can't be lost
[3:17] and so if there's any future judgment it
[3:20] is not to determine punishment and it
[3:22] cannot result in separation from God
[3:25] and it says now there's now no
[3:27] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[3:29] Jesus by one Spirit we're baptized into
[3:31] that body it's through that new birth
[3:33] that we're in Christ and the next
[3:35] statement who walked not after the flesh
[3:36] but after the spirit it's not a
[3:38] qualifier it's just telling you what it
[3:40] means to be in Christ you now have now
[3:42] have available to you the power of God
[3:44] to walk after and you do not have to
[3:46] walk after the Flesh and this law of sin
[3:50] and death has been vanquished to the
[3:52] cross and by you receiving eternal life
[3:54] and so we can say through the gift there
[3:56] is now no condemnation
[3:58] now if you'll take your Bibles and turn
[4:00] to Second Corinthians chapter five
[4:02] verses 9 and 10 I want to look now
[4:05] specifically at rewards and
[4:08] I'm not going to go there's not going to
[4:10] be very deep today not going to go very
[4:13] far on this subject I feel um just
[4:16] really relaxed on this subject I feel
[4:18] real pressed to get to anything in
[4:19] particular just as the Lord inspires
[4:21] even as you ask questions and share your
[4:24] heart and you kind of communicate back
[4:27] to me I feel the Lord kind of leading me
[4:28] in ways that can encourage you but in
[4:31] second Corinthians chapter 5 verses 9
[4:33] and 10 this is companion to Romans 14
[4:35] but we'll come back to it wherefore we
[4:38] labor that whether present or absent we
[4:40] may be accepted of him and so when he
[4:44] says wherefore we labor that word labor
[4:46] there it means make this your ambition
[4:49] this is our ambition this is what we're
[4:51] striving for that whether president or
[4:54] absent we may be accepted of him so he's
[4:57] saying our ambition ought to be to
[4:59] please him because to be accepted to him
[5:01] means to be pleasing to him
[5:03] and we ought to Aspire to please him and
[5:07] our ambition should be to be accepted by
[5:09] him because verse 10 and so it's
[5:11] important to I don't want to just jump
[5:13] into verse 10. he's saying labor work
[5:15] and he says whether you're present when
[5:17] at the translation or whether you were
[5:19] absent it doesn't matter just labor that
[5:21] you may be accepted and pleased pleasing
[5:24] to him and this is why verse 10 for we
[5:26] must all appear
[5:29] before the Judgment seat of Christ that
[5:32] everyone may receive the things done in
[5:34] his body according to that he had done
[5:37] whether it be good or bad
[5:40] so if I could say this though our
[5:42] Salvation is not dependent upon our
[5:44] works our future rewards depend upon
[5:46] them saying that we ought to labor to be
[5:48] accepted by him because we're going to
[5:50] stand before the Judgment seat of Christ
[5:52] he says to receive the things and so
[5:55] that's an important phrase and and I
[5:57] don't think it's uh
[5:58] maybe it's a little bit cumbersome a
[6:00] little bit bulky to receive the things
[6:02] done in his body he's basically saying
[6:04] that there's a grant of reward that's
[6:07] proportional I think I'm making it more
[6:08] clumsy a grant of a reward that's
[6:10] proportional to the things done the very
[6:12] things you do in your flesh and in your
[6:15] body your work your labor your effort
[6:16] your service all these things that you
[6:19] do there's going to be a reward that
[6:21] matches what you've done in your body
[6:24] and he says whether good or bad so Paul
[6:27] is saying that the believer and I think
[6:28] this is just the very clear it's not
[6:30] necessarily kind of a hidden reference
[6:32] here but the believer may have a greater
[6:34] reward
[6:35] according to how he labors for Christ
[6:38] he's writing to the believer he's not
[6:41] scattering this out to the unbeliever
[6:42] say Hey you know if you just if you get
[6:44] on his good side then he might kind of
[6:45] throw you a bone he's saying no to the
[6:47] believer to the elect labor for him
[6:49] because you're still going to stand
[6:51] before the bhima the Judgment seat of
[6:53] Christ that you might receive be
[6:55] rewarded for the things done the things
[6:57] you've done while in the flesh and since
[7:00] there's going to be a judgment and a
[7:02] proportional reward to the things that
[7:04] we've done in the flesh Paul is saying
[7:06] this is why he's encouraging us to have
[7:08] a higher ambition
[7:10] than just saying well thank God I'm
[7:13] saved and I know I've got the Holy Ghost
[7:15] and maybe being too church-centric
[7:17] because I I think it's really
[7:19] unfortunate and we begin to think about
[7:20] the third poll we think about the the
[7:22] open of the word we think about the
[7:23] restoration of the Bride tree we think
[7:25] about a lot of things whether we say
[7:26] Apostolic or Pentecostal it's
[7:28] unfortunate that our minds never leave
[7:30] the four walls of the church
[7:32] right a lot of what we think about in
[7:34] that context is what would take place in
[7:36] a church service and that's just a real
[7:38] teeny teeny teeny part of it because
[7:40] it's the life you live when you leave
[7:42] here uh if anything I'd say the
[7:44] Pentecostal blessing and the worship and
[7:46] the praise and the gifts that can
[7:47] manifest amith in these four walls is
[7:49] just should be a faithful blessing and
[7:51] encouragement for all the laboring we're
[7:53] doing outside of these four walls so
[7:54] let's not just narrow it down to what we
[7:56] do on a Wednesday night for a couple
[7:58] hours of what we do for a few hours on a
[7:59] Sunday morning there's so much to that
[8:02] labor and Paul is encouraging us to have
[8:04] a higher ambition in light of the fact
[8:07] that I know it might seem to be kind of
[8:08] like this we're all going to have to
[8:09] stand before the Judgment seat and it
[8:11] might seem to be a little a little bit
[8:13] of a fearful thing and I think we ought
[8:15] to have that respect for it but there's
[8:17] no chance that you can be separated from
[8:19] God at this point
[8:21] and I and I and I think that what I'm
[8:23] wanting us to do tonight is begin to
[8:25] think very deeply about this subject so
[8:27] that we can give more weight to the
[8:30] Eternal rewards that are available to us
[8:32] as Paul says in First Corinthians
[8:33] chapter 3 verse 8 if you're writing
[8:35] these down you could even go back and
[8:37] begin to read around these especially in
[8:38] this part we'll be looking at this in
[8:40] First Corinthians chapter three and the
[8:43] verses before and after in much greater
[8:44] detail it says now he that planteth and
[8:47] he that watereth are one and every man
[8:50] shall receive his own reward according
[8:53] to his own labor
[8:56] if you're thinking why didn't you just
[8:57] read that in part one and we could have
[8:58] just moved on to another series well
[9:01] it's pretty plain isn't it it seems to
[9:03] be very plain that one planet and the
[9:05] water they're part of this one one labor
[9:08] and one work but he says every man shall
[9:09] receive his own Ward according to his
[9:11] own labor so every man is going to
[9:13] answer for how he labors he's going to
[9:15] receive his own reward according to how
[9:18] he works so the believer all of us
[9:21] already securing Christ already sealed
[9:23] into the body we still have to answer
[9:25] for the works that we do in our flesh
[9:27] Paul says in Corinthians whether it be
[9:29] good or bad and I find myself having to
[9:31] constantly remind you not that there
[9:33] should be any fear of punishment but
[9:35] your works are going to be examined
[9:37] and so if if I could say this way
[9:41] to recognize this portion in God's word
[9:44] put so many other things into
[9:45] perspective there's a lot of things that
[9:47] we say well if I'm saved and I've got
[9:49] the Holy Ghost then what is what does
[9:51] all this matter and you say well maybe
[9:53] it doesn't matter in terms of this the
[9:55] seal but it matters in terms of future
[9:57] position and reward it'll matter in
[9:59] terms of how well you're blessed in this
[10:01] life and it matters in terms of what
[10:03] available opportunities God will give
[10:05] you to use the gifts that are in your
[10:07] life and this is one thing that puts
[10:09] into perspective all the many other
[10:11] things that God is trying to do in terms
[10:13] of perfecting our character in placing
[10:15] us positioning not just as sons that
[10:17] have been born but placed positionally
[10:19] in the body of Christ where we have a
[10:21] greater understanding and a greater uh a
[10:24] greater working out and manifestation of
[10:26] the holy spirit in our lives and so I
[10:28] think I believe it'll put a lot into
[10:30] perspective for us and and if that seems
[10:33] to be
[10:34] uh maybe a little presumptuous or
[10:36] talking too big about the subject I
[10:39] apologize but I do think it puts a lot
[10:41] in perspective
[10:42] in Romans chapter 14 if you could turn
[10:44] there I'm going to go ahead and read all
[10:46] of these verses together again verses 8
[10:48] to 12.
[10:50] and because I just think it's important
[10:52] to kind of follow it this flow and then
[10:54] I'm just really going to be focusing on
[10:56] how Paul
[10:57] positions verse 10 and verse 12 together
[11:01] he says for whether we live we live unto
[11:03] the Lord and whether we die we die unto
[11:04] the Lord whether we live therefore or
[11:06] die we are the Lords for to this end
[11:09] Christ both died and Rose and revived
[11:12] that he might be
[11:13] Lord both of the dead and living
[11:17] and this is uh
[11:20] this is where
[11:22] if you just focus very intently now but
[11:25] why Dost thou judge thy brother or why
[11:28] do thou said it not thy brother why
[11:31] don't we judge and condemn one another
[11:33] why is it that you're putting a
[11:34] stumbling block in front of one's way or
[11:36] you're you're arguing about this meat
[11:39] and you know despising this one because
[11:41] of this and condemning and judging
[11:42] because of that he said why does thou
[11:44] judge thy brother or why Dost thou said
[11:46] it not thy brother and this is his
[11:49] immediate statement to strike the one
[11:52] that's despising strike the one that's
[11:54] condemning the one that's judging to get
[11:56] them to kind of shake themselves and say
[11:58] don't you realize that we for we shall
[12:01] all stand before the Judgment seat of
[12:03] Christ now he's not writing to those who
[12:06] are not the Lords he's not writing to
[12:07] those who can find themselves at White
[12:09] Throne judgment and say depart from me I
[12:10] never knew you he is not writing to the
[12:13] unsaved he's writing to the believer to
[12:16] the elect for we shall all stand before
[12:18] the Judgment seat of Christ for it is
[12:19] written as I live saith the Lord every
[12:21] knee shall bow to me and every tongue
[12:23] shall confess to God so then every one
[12:26] of us shall give account of himself to
[12:29] God
[12:30] I was absolutely you could bring
[12:32] everybody into that because every man is
[12:34] going to answer books are going to be
[12:35] open and every man is going to have to
[12:36] answer for his works and so there is
[12:39] there is a time and I think maybe I'm
[12:41] getting ahead of myself a little bit
[12:42] here but there will be a time then then
[12:44] even those who are sealed and who's
[12:46] those whose names can ever be removed
[12:48] from the Lamb's Book of Life they still
[12:51] will stand before the Judgment seat of
[12:53] Christ is what Paul is plainly saying so
[12:55] he's saying why do you judge and condemn
[12:57] one another when we will have to be
[13:00] judged by him
[13:02] like forget don't forget now you may be
[13:04] the bride you may be elect and you may
[13:06] have eternal life but don't think that
[13:08] you can get away with whatever you say
[13:09] and whatever you do and there not be
[13:11] some Judgment of a man's works
[13:14] it says so everyone verse 12 so then
[13:17] every one of us shall give account of
[13:20] himself to God
[13:23] to give account of himself I believe the
[13:25] word that is used there is logos and in
[13:28] the context of judgment it simply means
[13:29] to answer or to give explanation for
[13:32] yourself
[13:33] that we are going to have to everyone
[13:35] will have to give an account give an
[13:36] explanation or answer for their
[13:37] character answer for their conduct
[13:40] they're going to have to answer for the
[13:41] words that they say and the actions and
[13:43] the Deeds that they did There's going to
[13:44] have to be some explanation given
[13:47] and so this is where the subject of
[13:49] responsibility I think just is coming
[13:51] right into view and I want to now just
[13:53] look at this very particularly all
[13:55] Christians are accountable to God
[13:57] according to their responsibility these
[14:00] are very simple words and I might and
[14:02] I'm using I want to use a diff a
[14:03] different word in relationship to it so
[14:05] let's consider these two related
[14:07] Concepts responsibility is our is our
[14:10] title tonight the subject we're looking
[14:11] at tonight but then also accountability
[14:13] and so these are two related Concepts
[14:16] responsibility is a fact or condition of
[14:19] being responsible it's a condition of
[14:21] being accountable or answerable so if
[14:25] you're responsible you are there's
[14:27] accountability if you're responsible you
[14:28] have to answer it so it's the condition
[14:30] of being responsible and this
[14:32] responsibility now it's not just
[14:35] accountability for accountability's sake
[14:37] and it's not just having to answer
[14:39] because someone asked you a question but
[14:41] it arises from some trust that's been
[14:43] put into you or put given to you I'm
[14:45] trusting you and since I've trusted you
[14:47] here please keep my keep my Blackberry
[14:50] phone safe and don't let anyone borrow
[14:51] it because I don't want someone to break
[14:53] it and so I'm trusting you with this
[14:55] then you would be responsible for the
[14:57] Blackberry and and therefore since it's
[14:59] been trusted to you that would be your
[15:00] responsibility
[15:02] and maybe our children could explain
[15:04] this better because when when we ask
[15:06] whether or not something's been done
[15:08] they can very easily articulate that it
[15:10] wasn't their responsibility
[15:12] and so they understand it on some level
[15:15] and so in this uh it arises from a duty
[15:18] that you have or or some trust and and I
[15:22] I I I can't I don't want to spend too
[15:24] much time on this subject I think maybe
[15:26] in the future if the Lord would anoint
[15:27] it there's a lot to be explored here but
[15:30] relationships create responsibilities
[15:33] and so it's by virtue of some
[15:34] relationship that's been formed a
[15:36] contractual relationship or parent to
[15:38] child or husband to wife or there's some
[15:40] there's some relationship to one another
[15:42] and therefore it it becomes a legal
[15:44] burden or a an obligation that you have
[15:46] because of the relationship
[15:49] and and parents have a duty uh to look
[15:52] after their children and even in the law
[15:54] parents can answer for the conduct of
[15:57] their children even though they didn't
[15:58] do it themselves they have a
[16:00] responsibility for their children and so
[16:02] there's a lot that can be used in terms
[16:04] of responsibility some fiduciary duty by
[16:06] virtue of relationship or contract one
[16:09] scripture I'd like to use just to make
[16:11] the point First Timothy 5 8 but if any
[16:13] provide not for his own especially for
[16:16] those of his own house he hath denied
[16:19] the faith and is worse than an infidel
[16:21] because of this relationship this man
[16:23] has specifically to his own house and
[16:26] the responsibility that he has for his
[16:27] own and for his own house if he does not
[16:30] provide then there's consequence so
[16:33] relationship establishes responsibility
[16:35] failure to fulfill the responsibility
[16:37] results in consequence
[16:40] this is uh kind of just real simple
[16:42] thought when we begin to think about how
[16:44] that we will all stand before the
[16:45] Judgment seat of Christ because every
[16:47] one of us will have to give an account
[16:49] so we're looking at responsibility first
[16:51] on this brother Brown says in a man
[16:54] running from the presence of the Lord we
[16:55] got so many things we have to do so much
[16:58] responsibility that we have to face
[16:59] everyone has got to face a certain
[17:01] responsibility
[17:04] I would encourage you if you have time
[17:05] to maybe go read the sermon or listen to
[17:07] it but the man talks a lot about
[17:09] responsibility in this a lot of good
[17:11] things to pull out about how a man has a
[17:13] responsibility and how certain
[17:14] relationships uh impose Upon Us
[17:16] obligations and responsibilities and I
[17:19] had been was just thinking about how we
[17:21] could phrase so many of the things that
[17:24] God asked us to do or expect of us as
[17:26] Christians to be responsibilities even
[17:29] in the things that are that we went
[17:30] through the six things that the year in
[17:32] preview for us and those things that we
[17:34] should be doing as Christians and as
[17:35] Believers these aren't responsibilities
[17:38] they arise because of our relationship
[17:40] to Christ and being Sons and Daughters
[17:42] of Christ or being the bride of Christ
[17:44] being his bride comes with a
[17:47] responsibility
[17:48] because of that position there comes
[17:50] with responsibility brother bam says
[17:52] this later in the same sermon
[17:53] Christianity is an everyday rugged life
[17:56] living for God in this present world
[17:58] it's a constant burning of the fire and
[18:01] love of God in the heart that sets you
[18:03] on fire and puts you out yonder with the
[18:05] people and making converts to Christ
[18:07] responsibilities
[18:09] these are all responsibilities these are
[18:12] all things that if you say if you don't
[18:14] feel like you have it let me just remind
[18:16] you it's there
[18:17] right if you don't feel like you have it
[18:19] there's a constant burning of the fire
[18:20] of the love of God down in your soul and
[18:22] it it can set us on fire put us out
[18:25] yonder amongst the people declaring
[18:27] Christ that's living for God in the
[18:28] present world he says responsibilities
[18:31] in the sermon the token he says we are
[18:33] responsible to him not to a church write
[18:36] it down
[18:38] right bold it underline it if you're
[18:40] typing it put it in all caps remember
[18:42] you are responsible to God not to a
[18:45] church
[18:46] there may be some responsibilities you
[18:49] have to a church by virtue of
[18:51] relationship you have to a church but
[18:53] you're not answering to the church for
[18:55] your rewards you're not answering to the
[18:57] church ultimately what they say he's
[18:59] saying you answer to his word and if
[19:01] it's not according to the word you owe
[19:03] no answer right so much that can be put
[19:06] in this he says but we are responsible
[19:07] to him not to a church we are
[19:09] responsible to God into his word and God
[19:11] is the word the Bible said he was we're
[19:13] responsible to that
[19:15] says in many different places that he
[19:17] will judge the World by Jesus Christ and
[19:20] Jesus Christ is the word that is the
[19:22] standard that is what we measure
[19:23] ourselves by and we are responsible to
[19:26] Christ we are responsible to the word
[19:30] and so without
[19:32] so that's that's uh responsibility now
[19:35] this other concept that we just want to
[19:37] quickly touch on without accountability
[19:40] responsibility is meaningless
[19:43] so if you are responsible for something
[19:45] and I say here you know watch out for
[19:47] this Blackberry that no one steals it or
[19:49] destroys it and and you knew that I
[19:52] wouldn't do anything or wouldn't matter
[19:54] or I would ever notice I'm never going
[19:55] to come back and ask it's like I mean I
[19:57] got a drawer full of blackberries he
[19:58] never comes back and asks there's no
[20:01] there's no consequence if something
[20:02] happens to his BlackBerry then there's
[20:04] really no responsibility if there's
[20:06] really no trust and there's no uh if
[20:09] there's no accountability rather then
[20:11] responsibility is meaningless do you
[20:13] understand what I'm saying in this if I
[20:16] gave if not me but if someone gave you a
[20:18] task and maybe this is a good way for
[20:20] parents to think about it and children
[20:21] think about it if you're given a
[20:23] responsibility and there's not going to
[20:25] be any subsequent accountability for
[20:27] what you've been asked to do then the
[20:29] duty there's no sense of Duty
[20:31] you don't feel that you have to complete
[20:33] it you don't feel that you have to do it
[20:35] because there's no real Duty that's
[20:37] being imposed upon you in no sense of
[20:39] obligation because nothing's ever going
[20:41] to be checked come on homeschoolers say
[20:43] Amen
[20:47] and so accountability is being
[20:50] answerable I I know you might say well
[20:53] if you're being really petting you say
[20:54] brother and those words sound really
[20:56] really you know close alike I get that
[20:58] but there's a little bit of a difference
[21:00] in that accountability is being
[21:02] answerable and again I'll say this is a
[21:04] very vast subject and I'm just wanting
[21:06] to touch on it in the sense of there's
[21:07] accountability as being answerable
[21:09] literally liable to be called to account
[21:14] and this is what Paul is saying that we
[21:15] all shall give an account of ourselves
[21:17] to God so we are liable we are going to
[21:20] be called to explain called to justify
[21:23] called to give a reason for what we did
[21:26] how we lived and how we handled this
[21:27] word that we've been given
[21:29] and so because accountability is the
[21:32] actual being held to account for what
[21:35] you're responsible for accountability
[21:37] encourages responsibility
[21:40] because it inspires us to the the full
[21:43] obligation of our duty that knowing that
[21:46] that I'm I'm going to be checked later
[21:48] my work is going to be checked and I'm
[21:50] going to be asked whether or not I did
[21:51] it and I'm going to be looked at they're
[21:53] going to be looking at me whether or not
[21:54] I performed my duty and there's going to
[21:55] be some examination of my work product
[21:57] and my teacher is going to look at
[21:59] whether or not I did the work or I'm
[22:00] gonna have to be tested on this however
[22:02] you would need to look at it to
[22:03] understand the idea that when you know
[22:05] that you're going to be examined or have
[22:07] to give a reason then it gives you this
[22:10] sense of I want to do it right
[22:13] I want to do perform my full obligation
[22:15] because I'm gonna have to answer
[22:17] for what I did
[22:18] so it encourages responsibility it kind
[22:20] of inspires us to do it well and do it
[22:22] right
[22:23] so accountability then as taking these
[22:25] two related Concepts accountability
[22:26] means being held responsible for our
[22:29] conduct as it relates to our duty
[22:32] so that we have a responsibility so it's
[22:34] our conduct it relates to our duty our
[22:36] position our relationship accountability
[22:37] is answering being held responsible for
[22:39] that conduct
[22:41] and so if we have a responsibility
[22:43] accountability is answering for whether
[22:45] and how we perform it I hope that that's
[22:48] principles are just put in there these
[22:50] are terms that we can use to help
[22:51] describe what we're looking at so we've
[22:53] looked at Second Corinthians chapter 5
[22:55] verse 10 for we shall all appear before
[22:57] the Judgment seat of Christ that we may
[22:59] receive the things done in this body
[23:01] whether it be good or bad and that we
[23:02] shall all stand before the Judgment seat
[23:04] of Christ so that every one of us will
[23:06] give an account of ourselves to God now
[23:09] you recognizing these these two concepts
[23:11] the Judgment seat of Christ has if I
[23:14] could even put it this way kind of soft
[23:15] language it has something to do with
[23:17] even the believer
[23:19] being examined or given an account of
[23:22] his works the way the Paul is saying it
[23:24] we'll have to stand before the Judgment
[23:26] seat of Christ and and receive that
[23:29] that's where we get the reward from
[23:30] we're going to receive in proportion to
[23:33] the our labor that we did we thought
[23:35] with what we were given the gift that we
[23:37] were given if I could put it that way
[23:38] and he says so we all will all stand
[23:40] before the Judgment seat of Christ to
[23:41] give an account of what we did with the
[23:44] gift
[23:45] now I find no better way to really
[23:48] amplify this to you than to bring it
[23:50] through the message of the hour because
[23:52] this concept would not be inspired to me
[23:55] nor would it be clear to me except
[23:56] through the message that we've received
[23:58] and in the sermon go wake Jesus he says
[24:00] just a little while and you'll find and
[24:02] I use this front part so you can see
[24:04] that brother Branham is relating this to
[24:06] the sealed so just a little while and
[24:08] you'll find Everything Has Changed and
[24:09] you're a new creature the new life comes
[24:11] in and you live from there on and I'll
[24:14] meet you again
[24:15] at the Judgment seat of Christ each one
[24:18] of you the new creatures
[24:20] I'll meet you there and I'll have to be
[24:22] responsible for what I I know it's a
[24:24] fragment he says God Will Make Me
[24:27] responsible
[24:29] so this is Brother Brown I'm expressing
[24:31] this to these new creatures and there's
[24:33] going to be a time that these converts
[24:35] that he was leading to Christ that
[24:36] there'll be a time will be gathered
[24:37] together again as new creatures in
[24:39] Christ Jesus assembled together again at
[24:41] the Judgment seat of Christ and he says
[24:42] I'll be responsible
[24:44] God Will Make Me responsible so this
[24:47] future judgment seat again and I think
[24:49] I'll get to the point where you'll
[24:50] finish the phrase for me it is not to
[24:52] determine salvation
[24:53] it is not to determine guilt or
[24:55] innocence it is not going to determine
[24:57] punishment or Mercy brother bam says
[25:00] we'll all stand will be at the Judgment
[25:01] seat of Christ where he will be
[25:04] responsible
[25:06] so we're going to be judged according to
[25:08] our responsibility whether or not we
[25:12] Faithfully just discharged our duty
[25:15] in First Corinthians chapter 4 verse 2
[25:17] it says moreover it is required in
[25:19] stewards that a man be found faithful
[25:21] now maybe I'm going uh too fast tonight
[25:24] and I'm letting the clock push me a
[25:26] little bit notice how Brad Brown says
[25:28] we'll stand before the judge and see the
[25:29] Christ and he says in that time God Will
[25:33] Make Me responsible
[25:34] so he's identifying even himself being
[25:37] responsible this is why we are using the
[25:38] phrase responsibility
[25:40] so it says moreover it is required in
[25:42] stewards that a man be found faithful a
[25:44] steward is one who is appointed to
[25:46] Governor have oversight over something
[25:48] in another stead so as I'm using this
[25:51] Blackberry example I don't know where
[25:53] that came from uh maybe just a shout out
[25:55] to brother Tim Dodd but with this uh
[25:58] idea that maybe someone gives you
[26:00] something we are stewards of the message
[26:02] of the hour you're stewards of the gift
[26:03] God gives you a gift you're a steward
[26:05] over something that comes with it we're
[26:07] appointed and have over sight in
[26:09] someone's dead think about all the
[26:11] wonderful things that brother Brahm says
[26:12] about the bride she is his body and his
[26:15] voice she's going to finish the work
[26:16] that he did not do he's entrusted us
[26:18] with certain things brother random
[26:20] preaches that the bride and if the woman
[26:22] has been entrusted with sacred virtues
[26:25] and so there is a stewardship that we
[26:27] have things that God has entrusted us
[26:31] with
[26:32] and as stewards therefore there is
[26:35] responsibility and accountability
[26:38] you find this in The Parables that Jesus
[26:40] uses you'll find a number of other
[26:42] places in the scripture that we are
[26:44] stewards and being stewards we must be
[26:46] found faithful because a steward will be
[26:48] judged according to his faithfulness
[26:51] did you discharge your duty that which
[26:54] was committed to you did you keep that
[26:55] which I committed to you did you look
[26:57] out after it did you do what you could
[26:59] have done with it did you get a hundred
[27:00] fold out of what I gave you
[27:03] so brother Branham in the church age
[27:05] book chapter five says yes I can see
[27:07] that God is going to give
[27:09] play Closer pay close attention to this
[27:12] God is going to give a special reward to
[27:14] his Messengers who have Faithfully
[27:16] discharged the responsibility he has
[27:19] placed upon them
[27:21] if they have received the revelation of
[27:23] the word of God for that age and
[27:25] Faithfully preached in their day and
[27:27] lived what they preached They will
[27:29] receive a great reward
[27:32] notice how brother Branham is placing
[27:34] this that there is a special reward to
[27:37] The Messengers who Faithfully discharge
[27:40] the responsibility he placed on them and
[27:42] there is a responsibility placed upon
[27:44] them having received the revelation of
[27:45] the word for that age therefore they
[27:47] Faithfully preach it and I love and they
[27:49] lived what they preached I I'm I'm
[27:52] holding back a little bit maybe Sunday
[27:53] mornings when we'll touch on it there is
[27:55] then this inference that one could
[27:58] receive the Revelation for their day
[27:59] Faithfully preach it but not live what
[28:02] they preach and lose something
[28:05] right there's some loss that can be had
[28:08] there I'll give you the key you can go
[28:09] look it up a Castaway
[28:12] he says they will receive a great reward
[28:16] those who have Faithfully discharged the
[28:18] responsibility placed on They will
[28:19] receive a great reward he calls it a
[28:21] special reward a special reward a great
[28:23] reward now again he's not saying that
[28:26] he'll save him
[28:27] right I should be getting louder a man's
[28:29] at this point when I make the
[28:31] distinction between salvation and these
[28:33] rewards he's not saying I'll save you
[28:35] and I'll give you the Holy Ghost he's
[28:36] saying I've got something special for
[28:38] those who have Faithfully discharged
[28:40] their responsibility
[28:44] and so this judgment seat of Christ
[28:47] is being held accountable it's where
[28:49] we're going to be held accountable or it
[28:51] refers to the the Act and the fact of
[28:54] being held accountable for our
[28:55] responsibility
[28:57] and the outcome of that is a reward or a
[29:01] special reward or great rewards
[29:05] and we are you on the same page with me
[29:07] I got you can just give me nods or you
[29:09] can give me that you can you can give me
[29:12] the the Indian yes right
[29:15] yes brother Aaron absolutely
[29:17] and so we're all on the same page good I
[29:19] like that so he says now brother I'm
[29:22] going to read just several quotes here
[29:25] and I just feel so comfortable to do
[29:27] this
[29:28] and if you could I know I know it's
[29:30] Wednesday night a little bit weary
[29:31] there's a lot of things going on uh that
[29:33] kind of dominated our attention we've
[29:35] survived all the crowds being here over
[29:38] this past week or so maybe you're at
[29:41] hole 16 of the Waste Management Open or
[29:43] whatever it's called but let's shake
[29:45] ourselves it's eight o'clock let's focus
[29:48] intently on these statements because
[29:50] there's brother Brown is pointing at
[29:52] something
[29:53] right pointing at something we want to
[29:55] get it
[29:57] he says in the sermon the patriarch
[29:58] brother sister this is my soul I've got
[30:01] to meet God I'm responsible for what I
[30:03] say to you God will hold me responsible
[30:06] for it
[30:07] the Judgment seat of Christ is being
[30:09] held accountable for your responsibility
[30:11] if God has endured a messenger with a
[30:13] revelation and he Faithfully preaches it
[30:15] and Faithfully lives that God will give
[30:16] him a great reward or a special reward
[30:17] so there's some moment at the judge's
[30:19] seat of Christ where we answer for what
[30:21] he has given us and what we've done with
[30:23] the gifts or talents uh however you well
[30:26] however you want to describe it there's
[30:27] this point in time where there's
[30:29] judgment for a reward I've got to meet
[30:32] God he says God will hold me responsible
[30:34] for it in the sermon The God Who is rich
[30:37] in Mercy every move we make and every
[30:39] sound it's playing a record that will
[30:42] meet us at the judgment
[30:44] every move move we make has got to meet
[30:46] us there and that's what brother bam
[30:48] says remember let's say member of the
[30:50] Bride sealed into the body of Christ
[30:52] I've got to answer for the words that I
[30:54] say to you as a minister I've got to do
[30:56] that because God will hold me
[30:58] responsible to it
[31:02] could we what's the word I want to use
[31:03] here
[31:04] Ponder
[31:06] the implications a little bit
[31:08] could we do that
[31:10] and really let us uh at two ways one by
[31:13] pondering the implications be struck
[31:16] with the reality that though a sealed
[31:20] Son of God you'll still have to answer
[31:22] to your heavenly father
[31:24] and wouldn't that be just a tremendous
[31:27] moderator for a lot of people who just
[31:29] like to do this sometimes right wouldn't
[31:31] that be a tremendous moderator for
[31:33] people who just want to do this a lot of
[31:34] times to realize yeah you may be secure
[31:36] as a Son of God but you'll answer for
[31:38] everything you say about somebody you'll
[31:40] answer for the way you treat people
[31:41] you'll answer for the things you say and
[31:44] do even as a child of God
[31:47] because he says I will answer for the
[31:49] words I say to as a minister I've got to
[31:51] do it because God will hold me
[31:53] responsible so let's personally think
[31:55] about the implications that we'll still
[31:57] answer for our conduct
[31:59] but then also think about well then
[32:01] where can we place this judgment
[32:04] if the bride is going to be at White
[32:06] Throne judgment judging
[32:08] then when is she going to answer to God
[32:10] and be responsible or where if we just
[32:13] want to say well brother Aaron it's just
[32:14] brother Branham saying it when is he
[32:16] going to be responsible when is Paul
[32:19] going to be responsible because he's
[32:20] saying that he is
[32:22] in the sermon Faith the brother says
[32:24] someday I'm going to have to answer for
[32:26] what I've done here on Earth and I'm
[32:28] going to have to answer for my
[32:29] stewardship this is what we call plain
[32:32] English
[32:33] this is good enough for government work
[32:35] this this is we're going to have to
[32:37] answer for my stewardship I'm going to
[32:40] have to have to answer for what I've
[32:41] done here on Earth and I'm going to have
[32:42] to answer for my stewardship not to
[32:44] determine whether or not he is saved or
[32:45] receives eternal life but it's just the
[32:47] truth it's just reality in God's word
[32:49] he's going to examine our works
[32:53] will they remain in that time of
[32:54] judgment will will there be anything
[32:56] that survives why because only one life
[32:59] so soon this one will pass and only
[33:01] What's Done For Christ will last
[33:06] you'll have to answer for your
[33:07] stewardship and the sermon the seed is
[33:09] not air with the shock and if you think
[33:11] I had to go pecking around to find these
[33:14] you all you have to do is just simple
[33:16] word searches and you can print out
[33:17] reams of paper on this subject oh God I
[33:20] would pray for help knowing the
[33:21] responsibility of what it means and what
[33:23] I must answer at the day of judgment
[33:26] for all that I say here and elsewhere
[33:28] help me to be deadly sincerely Lord with
[33:31] all that I do or say in thy word that it
[33:33] might bring forth fruit there's somebody
[33:35] who gets it
[33:37] that he still he he knows he's a prophet
[33:40] he's preaching this not in the 53 but
[33:42] he's preaching this in 65 and there's
[33:45] this all that he has for the
[33:46] responsibility and he says I'm going to
[33:49] have to give resp to answer at the day
[33:52] of judgment for what I say what I say
[33:54] elsewhere and I'll be responsible
[33:56] knowing the responsibility that I have
[33:58] he says Let Me Be deeply sincere
[34:02] and all that I do or say in thy word
[34:04] that it might bring forth fruit not only
[34:06] that it would be fruitful here but Lord
[34:07] I know I'm going to have to answer and I
[34:09] want my Works to remain in that day
[34:11] I have to answer he says in different
[34:14] places different ways but he says this
[34:16] very specifically I don't have the slide
[34:17] for it it's just a short phrase I know
[34:19] that I'll have to answer
[34:21] at the day of judgment for what money
[34:23] the people give to me
[34:26] and I do not believe even the the
[34:28] harshest skeptic and critic of this
[34:30] message could try to twist that to say
[34:31] that brother Branham was confessing that
[34:33] he would stand before Christ at the
[34:35] white Throne judgment to determine
[34:37] whether or not he would enter in but
[34:38] that is not what he's saying he said I
[34:42] will have to answer the div judgment for
[34:44] what money the people give to me
[34:48] there's a there's an account there's
[34:49] accountability because of the
[34:51] responsibilities
[34:54] and maybe that Comforts a lot of you who
[34:55] give offerings and tithes knowing that
[34:57] whoever receives it is going to have to
[34:59] answer on the day of judgment for how
[35:00] they use it
[35:03] well you didn't have to laugh that
[35:04] heartily if I was a visiting Minister
[35:07] laugh all you want
[35:11] you remember in brother Brandon when he
[35:12] tells his life story in a number of
[35:14] different places
[35:15] and I know I'm refreshing this to people
[35:17] who know it very very well and I've
[35:19] really been encouraged through the
[35:20] Supernatural series that brother-owned
[35:21] organists and wrote
[35:23] uh because it just it's rehearsed it a
[35:25] lot in our family and our children are
[35:26] very familiar with it I recommend those
[35:28] to be read as part of your devotions or
[35:30] just personal reading and and so whether
[35:32] it's been through that medium or
[35:34] listening to brother random tell his
[35:35] life story we've heard of how that God
[35:37] was calling him to go to the
[35:39] Pentecostals and he was calling him in
[35:41] his minister to go out and preach and he
[35:43] didn't do it because of his
[35:44] mother-in-law and when he refused he
[35:46] suffered he paid a great price in this
[35:48] earth right lost his wife lost his his
[35:50] daughter and paid the price for not
[35:52] going out so you understand the
[35:53] background but notice this statement he
[35:55] makes uh in regards to him not going
[35:57] when God answered him to go in the in
[35:59] the sermon life story in 1951
[36:02] he says always mind God
[36:06] this is fresh after he's told this story
[36:08] of losing his wife and his daughter
[36:10] because he disobeyed God and didn't go
[36:11] to the Pentecostals because that's what
[36:13] God wanted to do he says no matter what
[36:14] it is God says for you to do he's saying
[36:16] mind God no matter what it is
[36:19] he says and I tell you today that God in
[36:21] heaven who looks down upon me standing
[36:23] in this platform will forgive me don't
[36:27] read ahead focus on that I know I'm
[36:29] standing here in this platform he's just
[36:31] told the story of his Disobedience he
[36:32] told the story how he obeyed a
[36:34] mother-in-law instead of God and he says
[36:35] I know God will forgive me
[36:39] I know that many thousands of souls that
[36:42] I'll have to answer for it that day
[36:44] for listening to someone else instead of
[36:46] God
[36:47] that's true
[36:49] That's Heavy
[36:50] this is the honesty of brother Branham
[36:52] to not say oh wow and think about maybe
[36:54] if it's been our attitudes then this is
[36:56] this should be a rebuke to us like wow
[36:58] you know predestination and God let it
[37:01] happen because it wouldn't let it happen
[37:02] if it wasn't predestinated if I'm going
[37:04] to be there I'll be there in this kind
[37:05] of this laissez-faire attitude whatever
[37:07] will be will be and it's kind of just as
[37:09] if God's ordaining all the Affairs of
[37:11] man and he's in control and we almost
[37:13] take on the attitude of of the clay
[37:15] saying well how could you judge me when
[37:16] you made me this way
[37:18] and here's the humility of brother
[37:20] Branham to say I know I was wrong to not
[37:23] go
[37:25] and I know that he forgives me or will
[37:28] forgive me
[37:29] so he's in that forgiveness there's no
[37:31] punishment but he says I'll still answer
[37:34] for all the souls
[37:36] that I was supposed to minister to
[37:39] because I listened to somebody else and
[37:40] said of God he says that's true
[37:43] I know that many thousands of souls I'll
[37:46] have to answer for at that day
[37:50] that's tremendous
[37:53] again we're wanting to recognize his
[37:55] owning the responsibility
[37:58] and subsequently I'm wanting us to place
[38:00] ourselves in that pattern of being
[38:02] responsible
[38:04] and the when he went beyond the curtain
[38:06] of time brother man talks about being on
[38:08] the curtain of time and I'm sure that
[38:10] you're familiar with this when he enters
[38:11] in beyond the curtain of time and he's
[38:13] looking back and he sees himself laying
[38:15] in bed with his arms behind his head or
[38:18] his hands behind his head and he begins
[38:21] to experience that realm beyond the
[38:23] curtain of time there in eternity
[38:25] and and there's different conversations
[38:27] he has and when he tells the story
[38:29] in a couple places and then he recounts
[38:31] it in the church age book there's this
[38:33] man that has come up to him and these
[38:34] one lady hugs him and he's like she said
[38:36] oh when I was saved she was 80 years old
[38:38] when he got saved but she's a young lady
[38:39] now and so brother Brandon was like are
[38:41] these all branhams and uh who are they
[38:44] they're saying these are your converts
[38:46] and so then he's having this
[38:47] conversation and brother Brown's like oh
[38:49] where's the Lord and we'll pick it up
[38:51] here the man said we're resting here
[38:53] while waiting for the coming of the Lord
[38:57] I replied I want to see him
[39:00] he said you can't see him just yet but
[39:02] he is coming soon
[39:04] and recognize this and when he does
[39:06] he'll come to you first
[39:08] because this is these are converts of
[39:10] brother branham's and and these are his
[39:12] people coming are these Browns all these
[39:14] are converts These Are the souls that
[39:16] were won through your ministry he'll
[39:17] come to you first and you will be judged
[39:20] according to the gospel you have
[39:22] preached
[39:23] again as we are pondering this very
[39:25] deeply recognize the context in which
[39:27] this judgment is brought up is not
[39:29] souls in prison their souls in hell are
[39:32] those that are unredeemed in this state
[39:34] of loss in this eternal fall wondering
[39:36] when is this all going to end well one
[39:38] day we're all going to be judged she
[39:39] said no these Believers eternally secure
[39:41] in Christ who are there beyond the
[39:43] curtain of time are aware and conscious
[39:47] that there's going to be a time when cry
[39:48] will be gathered together to Christ and
[39:50] be judged
[39:52] and he says
[39:53] you will be judged according to the
[39:55] gospel you've preached and we will be
[39:56] your subjects I said do you mean I'm
[39:59] responsible for all these
[40:01] he said every one you everyone you were
[40:04] born a leader I asked will everyone be
[40:09] responsible
[40:11] what about Saint Paul he answered me he
[40:14] will be responsible for his day
[40:19] can you recognize this special time
[40:21] that brother Branham is pointing to
[40:24] as a Son of God as a prophet as a
[40:26] minister as one who handles the word of
[40:28] God and recognizes these scriptures he's
[40:30] pointing to a special time when his own
[40:32] labor and his own responsibility is
[40:34] going to be examined and he will be
[40:36] accountable to what he was responsible
[40:38] for he's pointing out this special time
[40:41] where even our labor as the bride will
[40:43] be judged for to determine a reward
[40:51] is it not can you not see that can you
[40:54] see that rather how I want to ask it can
[40:55] you see brother randomly and you say we
[40:58] might have a lot of questions well just
[40:59] when exactly is it going to be and what
[41:01] is it going to look like and what kind
[41:02] of rewards are we going to get
[41:04] that we might have a lot of questions
[41:05] that lean in those ways but I think it's
[41:08] more important first to establish in our
[41:09] hearts that it's a truth in God's
[41:11] scripture
[41:12] according to the message of the hour in
[41:13] the scripture that judgment seat of
[41:15] Christ is a time when the believer who
[41:17] is sure of his salvation relationship
[41:19] with God is given an opportunity to
[41:22] present his Works to God
[41:24] and say this is what I've done for your
[41:26] kingdom
[41:27] and they're tried
[41:29] and they're examined and there's a
[41:31] reward that's given to those Works which
[41:32] remain
[41:34] so I I close with
[41:37] this this thought
[41:40] and just just a few moments here I don't
[41:42] want you to also start a timer on that
[41:45] if there's anyone keeping the the data
[41:48] points maybe be good to do the analytics
[41:49] on it at some point
[41:51] but in First Corinthians chapter 15
[41:53] verse 58
[41:55] therefore my beloved Brethren be
[41:57] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[42:00] the work of the Lord
[42:02] for as much as ye know that your labor
[42:04] is not in vain in the Lord
[42:08] and if I could say without even
[42:10] considering the blessings he'll give you
[42:12] in this life
[42:14] without even considering I know there's
[42:15] been some questions about what in the
[42:17] world does kids eat free mean keep
[42:18] thinking about it
[42:20] because if you ever if you pick up on
[42:22] the con what I mean by that then there's
[42:24] a lot of sacrifices and a lot of efforts
[42:26] we'll make as parents knowing that our
[42:28] kids are getting the benefit from it
[42:30] and he's saying be steadfast unmovable
[42:32] always abound in the work of the Lord
[42:34] and this is without even without even
[42:37] giving it and I want to put it this way
[42:38] without even giving any consideration to
[42:40] reaping the what you sowed that's good
[42:43] in this life
[42:45] he says for as much as you know that
[42:47] your labor is not in vain in the Lord
[42:51] right could I encourage you to do
[42:53] something tonight invert always invert
[42:55] we use the subject of judgment we use
[42:57] the term responsibility we use the term
[43:00] accountability and rarely are these
[43:02] things ever used in the context of an
[43:04] awards banquet or receiving something
[43:06] fun or getting that thing that we always
[43:08] wanted it usually is carried with it
[43:10] like a sentence or a punishment or or
[43:12] being grounded or having something taken
[43:14] away from us and I think that you ought
[43:16] to invert always invert that if there's
[43:19] going to be a judgment there's going to
[43:21] be an opportunity for us to to stand
[43:23] before the Judgment seat of Christ the
[43:25] point has nothing to do with losing and
[43:28] everything to do with gaining
[43:31] that that what we gather from this oh
[43:33] I'm going to be judging my works and be
[43:35] judged and said be like oh no what am I
[43:36] going to lose and what is going to
[43:38] happen just think about all the rewards
[43:40] that God has made available to his
[43:43] Saints and all the incentives that he
[43:45] holds out to the believer encouraging
[43:47] them to labor on his behalf because God
[43:49] is Not will not forget your labor of
[43:52] love he'll always reward a believer's
[43:54] efforts to please him and Paul is saying
[43:57] be steadfast unmovable always abounding
[44:00] in the work of the Lord for as much as
[44:02] you know that your labor is not in vain
[44:04] in the Lord
[44:06] let's not encumber our minds with the
[44:09] sense of what we have to lose at a
[44:11] judgment seat of Christ but rather let's
[44:13] think about what we stand to gain at the
[44:16] Judgment seat of Christ
[44:18] there's no threat of punishment for bad
[44:19] behavior
[44:21] only the reward of the promise of a
[44:24] reward for good works
[44:26] and Paul is encouraging faithful labor
[44:28] because God will reward it
[44:31] in other words let's give more weight to
[44:33] his Rewards
[44:36] we've read in a number of places where
[44:38] brother Branham is identifying himself
[44:40] as being responsible and himself having
[44:42] to answer
[44:44] and in him being accountable
[44:46] him I'll have to be responsible God Will
[44:49] Make Me responsible
[44:51] that God will give a special reward and
[44:53] those who have Faithfully discharged
[44:55] their responsibility will receive a
[44:57] great reward I've got to meet God he
[44:59] hold me responsible we'll he'll hold me
[45:01] I got an answer for the works that I do
[45:03] I got to answer for what I've done I
[45:04] have to answer for my stewardship uh
[45:06] what a responsibility because I'm gonna
[45:08] have to answer the day of judgment I'm
[45:10] gonna have to answer for the money that
[45:11] I use always mind God because I know
[45:14] he'll forgive me but I'll still answer
[45:16] for thousands of Souls
[45:18] he was told you'll be judged according
[45:20] to the gospel You Preach am I going to
[45:22] be responsible yeah he says we're
[45:24] everyone will be responsible
[45:27] and so brother Madam has clearly
[45:29] identified in his own Ministry from the
[45:30] beginning of the end that there's this
[45:32] understanding this idea that one day his
[45:34] resp he's going to be judged and he's
[45:37] going to be held responsible for what he
[45:39] preached he's held responsible for the
[45:40] way he did and how he used things
[45:43] and so another very familiar and I I was
[45:47] so
[45:48] I just like the way the Lord brings us
[45:50] out because if you think well brother
[45:51] Aaron just you know sits at home and
[45:52] just tries to think of a creative way to
[45:54] craft a sermon now these things are just
[45:55] inspired by God
[45:57] and what was remarkable to me is how God
[45:58] takes these significant instances in
[46:00] brother Brown's Ministry and he starts
[46:02] pulling them together and you see that
[46:04] in the in the uh going beyond the
[46:07] curtain of time or in the uh in this
[46:10] this momentous decision or this decision
[46:12] he ought to have made to go to the
[46:13] Pentecostals see these these significant
[46:15] events there are these little Clues as
[46:17] to what the implications are later on in
[46:20] in eternity
[46:21] and so brother Branham and I wish I
[46:24] would have brought more of the quote
[46:25] here I I just I just take a segment out
[46:27] I don't even have the slide for you but
[46:30] you're familiar when brother Branham
[46:31] there's a prophecy he'd been given in
[46:33] French
[46:34] and and it was spoken out and given in
[46:37] French and then it was immediately
[46:38] translated
[46:39] and this is this is what the prophecy
[46:42] said
[46:43] because thou Hast chosen the Narrow Path
[46:45] the harder way
[46:48] thou Hast walked of your own choosing
[46:51] thou has picked the correct and precise
[46:53] decision and it is my way
[46:57] we're having to try to wrestle with this
[47:00] we're we're looking at this and we're
[47:01] we're instead of just being very uh
[47:04] shallow with it I'm wanting us to think
[47:06] deeply and and think about different the
[47:08] different layers that are to this and my
[47:10] it what is he actually saying here did
[47:12] Brother Benham make choose the narrow
[47:14] path to be a Christian he'd choose the
[47:16] harder way uh to be saved but it's it's
[47:18] talking about this momentous decision
[47:21] because I was chosen the Narrow Path the
[47:23] harder way now let me say this
[47:25] with I believe the anointing of God here
[47:27] for you there's there's those who need
[47:29] this and you've been sincere in your
[47:31] prayers about this very thing now you
[47:34] place yourself in the same place in the
[47:36] same place as the Son of God you may not
[47:38] be a prophet but you have your reward
[47:40] you you may not be a PR a minister but
[47:43] you have your responsibility and if God
[47:45] will Faithfully reward with the special
[47:47] reward and a great reward uh the man of
[47:49] God who discharges his duty then God has
[47:52] a special reward for any of his children
[47:54] that Faithfully discharge their Duty
[47:57] God has not created a special class of
[48:00] people but we are join heirs with Christ
[48:01] and there are rewards that are available
[48:03] to the faithful Saints so I pray that
[48:06] this and just reciting this prophecy
[48:08] this interpreted prophecy into French
[48:11] that was in French to you that you can
[48:14] let this just strike your hearts to give
[48:16] you some Liberty because thou have
[48:18] chosen the Narrow Path the harder way
[48:20] thou Hast walked of your own choosing
[48:22] thou Hast picked the correct and price
[48:25] precise decision and it is my way
[48:28] and I I say this being overwhelmed with
[48:30] inspiration you some of you sit here
[48:33] tonight have chosen the harder way and
[48:36] made choices that have so you've
[48:38] suffered as a result of it but it has
[48:40] been his way
[48:42] those picked the correct and precise
[48:44] decision and it is my way because of
[48:47] this momentous decision a huge portion
[48:50] of Heaven awakes thee
[48:52] do you recognize what God is trying to
[48:54] tell this Prophet who is aware here we
[48:56] are towards the end of his ministry he's
[48:58] fully aware he's going to have to answer
[49:00] he knows he's gonna have to answer for
[49:02] souls he knows he's got the answer for
[49:04] being disobedient to that to that call
[49:06] he has he feels the weight of it so God
[49:09] tells them don't you worry you've made
[49:11] the tough decision you've made the
[49:13] difficult decision and because you have
[49:16] a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee
[49:19] oh Hallelujah
[49:22] what is that huge portion of Heaven it's
[49:24] a reward
[49:27] and it continues what a glorious
[49:28] decision thou has made
[49:30] this in itself is that which will give
[49:33] and may come to pass
[49:35] the tremendous victory in love divine
[49:39] I hope that you can make this personal
[49:42] that there is when we choose the narrow
[49:44] path we choose the harder way
[49:46] we've walked of our of our own choosing
[49:50] and again let me just hearken back
[49:52] you're not a Christian by your desire
[49:55] you're a Christian by God's desire
[49:57] but now as a Christian
[49:59] you make you make choices and you make
[50:01] decisions
[50:03] and you choose certain ways and we pick
[50:06] when we pick the correct and precise one
[50:09] because we choose the harder way and we
[50:12] suffer loss he says there is a portion
[50:14] if I could say a portion of Heaven that
[50:16] awaits us
[50:17] and with all that the Believers in you
[50:19] individuals your families and
[50:21] individuals here and I'm mindful of the
[50:23] different ones that we could identify
[50:25] with all that you've lost all that
[50:27] you've suffered in this life all that
[50:28] you've left behind to follow Christ all
[50:30] that you've abandoned to be in his
[50:32] perfect will all the the whatever it
[50:35] might be that you've suffered to do what
[50:37] you knew is the right thing if you think
[50:39] about all that it might seem in some
[50:41] ways that it's all been in vain but this
[50:44] is what Paul is saying your labor is not
[50:46] in vain
[50:48] God is keeping record
[50:52] he keeps record of all your hard
[50:53] decisions all your sacrifices all that
[50:56] you've lost
[50:59] and all that you're suffering
[51:01] and through it all your earning Rewards
[51:04] and it's not in vain because he will
[51:06] repay it
[51:08] and I and I say this as a just a means
[51:10] of encouragement tonight I I wish that
[51:13] the the fellowship Paul was full I wish
[51:15] there was standing room only tonight so
[51:17] that everyone I say this especially to
[51:20] those who are part of this church that
[51:22] they could all hear this you may not you
[51:25] may not seem to be seeing the fruits of
[51:27] it now and there may not be a lot of
[51:30] things at your fingertips to say oh my
[51:32] I'm really getting a return on this but
[51:34] you'll get a return on it
[51:36] that there will be a payoff there's not
[51:38] one thing you've done for him not one
[51:41] choice you've made not one hard decision
[51:43] there's not one friend You've Lost In
[51:45] following Christ there's not one
[51:47] relationship that's been broken because
[51:48] you chose to do the right thing there's
[51:50] nothing you've lost here that you
[51:52] haven't already gained there
[51:55] you may not see the fruit of it now
[51:58] but it's coming
[52:00] and I think very particularly those who
[52:02] labor for the kingdom of God
[52:03] specifically for the the house of the
[52:05] Lord and the different things that are
[52:07] done behind the scenes the the sisters
[52:09] and the families here that come on
[52:11] regular intervals and you and this may
[52:14] seem very patent to some of you I don't
[52:16] know or you may not even realize that
[52:17] this place doesn't get supernaturally
[52:19] cleaned
[52:20] but those that come on regular intervals
[52:23] and they sacrifice without pay
[52:25] and they come when no one else is
[52:26] watching and they and they clean and if
[52:29] you heard the horror stories that take
[52:30] place in the bathrooms you'd have a much
[52:33] greater respect and admiration uh for
[52:36] those that come and and clean and they
[52:38] do it without any Fanfare without any
[52:40] reenumeration without any and it's a
[52:43] sacrifice and it may seem very trivial
[52:45] even in your minds as I say it right now
[52:47] but God is keeping record of every
[52:50] single effort everything we do to please
[52:52] him everything we do in our heart is
[52:54] unto the Lord in knowing from whom our
[52:56] reward comes I'm not doing it for a
[52:58] paycheck I'm not doing it for a raise
[53:00] I'm not doing it for status I am working
[53:02] from whom I know that my reward comes
[53:05] from
[53:07] you may not feel the blessing of it now
[53:09] you may not get all the attention and
[53:11] recognition now but there will be a
[53:13] payoff
[53:14] I think the ones that I think of most
[53:16] immediately when it comes to this are
[53:18] the mothers that are raising young
[53:20] children
[53:21] and they and they have them in secession
[53:23] they have child number one within the
[53:25] next few years number two with the next
[53:27] few years number three and then maybe
[53:28] there's a four and a five and they and
[53:30] for like a dozen years of their life
[53:32] they're changing diapers they're running
[53:34] out to do this they're changing clothes
[53:36] they're having to do it and the church
[53:37] services they know what they're going to
[53:39] do they're going to come to church and
[53:40] take their children out
[53:42] and sometimes they ask themselves and
[53:44] maybe the devil puts the thought in
[53:46] their mind why why even go
[53:49] well I'm trying to put it into
[53:50] perspective
[53:51] that it may not seem well I'm not
[53:54] getting anything out of the service and
[53:55] if you miss a part of brother Aaron's
[53:56] sermon the whole thing just follows it
[53:58] falls apart and I gotta run out and do
[54:00] this and I gotta run out and do that
[54:01] don't forget that it's not the reward of
[54:04] understanding what I say but it's the
[54:06] reward of being at your post to duty
[54:08] it's the reward of knowing that this is
[54:10] where God wants me to be that even if I
[54:12] don't recognize there's a blessing in it
[54:14] one day God will reward me for it
[54:18] and there's a reward that we cannot even
[54:20] quantify or measure for when we have
[54:22] been faithful to what he expects us to
[54:25] do
[54:26] in the sermon the world has fallen apart
[54:33] could we could we focus now this is my
[54:36] last statement
[54:38] I think this will just be a wonderful
[54:40] end to this this subject tonight and now
[54:42] we're happy to know
[54:44] that there's come in a time when the
[54:45] kingdoms of this world
[54:47] will become the kingdoms of our Lord and
[54:49] of his Christ
[54:51] that we shall Rule and Reign on the
[54:52] earth with him a thousand years
[54:55] now
[54:57] he says we're looking forward to that
[54:58] time
[55:01] so what time is he referring to
[55:03] the millennial reign
[55:06] when all the kingdoms become king his
[55:08] kingdoms
[55:09] I hear the men speak of their
[55:11] Temptations and how that Satan took our
[55:12] Lord up to the top of the mountain in a
[55:14] moment of time
[55:16] showed him all the governments and
[55:17] kingdoms of the world and offered them
[55:19] to him
[55:21] but he flatly
[55:23] refused them
[55:26] because he knew that someday he's
[55:28] falling heir to them
[55:31] I said we're looking forward to this
[55:32] time when all the kingdoms of the world
[55:33] become the kingdoms of Our Lord
[55:35] and we shall Rule and reign with him on
[55:36] the earth Millennial Reign and now he
[55:38] brings it back to a time where the devil
[55:39] offered it to him without sacrifice
[55:42] right
[55:43] offered it to him as a gift
[55:46] perhaps
[55:47] it was gonna give it to him without the
[55:49] sacrifice but Jesus knew one day he
[55:51] would get it if he Faithfully discharged
[55:52] his duty
[55:54] and programs using this using this
[55:56] language here I think it's very very key
[55:58] because it helps place the timing of the
[55:59] Judgment seat of Christ he says because
[56:01] he knew that someday he'd fall heir to
[56:02] them he says and we don't look at the
[56:04] things that go on so much temporarily
[56:06] now
[56:07] but we look to the end of the road
[56:09] where the rewards are given
[56:13] we are happy to know that there's come
[56:15] in a Time
[56:16] when all the kingdoms of this world are
[56:19] going to be given to Jesus Christ and we
[56:21] will rule and reign with him a thousand
[56:23] years on the earth and he's saying you
[56:25] know what let's not just look so much to
[56:26] what we lose here and what goes on here
[56:28] he says but look out to the end of the
[56:30] road when the rewards are given
[56:33] that's that time in that moment when you
[56:37] receive the reward for all that you've
[56:40] labored for
[56:42] you I think that responsibility is a
[56:43] good thing
[56:45] because it means there's rewards that
[56:46] are available
[56:48] could we stand together tonight
