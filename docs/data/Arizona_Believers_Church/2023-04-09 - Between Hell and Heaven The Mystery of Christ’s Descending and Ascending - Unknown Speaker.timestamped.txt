[0:00] moment. But in the sermon, faith and
[0:02] some of these elements are real
[0:03] important for us to grab at the
[0:04] beginning. He says, "So you got your own
[0:06] resurrection inside of you. Your
[0:09] resurrection lays inside of you in your
[0:11] spirit." Now, that should be attention
[0:13] grabbing right off the bat as we're
[0:15] honoring the resurrection on this Easter
[0:17] Sunday. Your resurrection is inside of
[0:19] you. He says it's in your spirit. So if
[0:21] we were going to have a resurrection, we
[0:23] have to possess it. And then he says,
[0:25] 'Now, you know, when Jesus died on the
[0:26] cross, his soul descended into hell and
[0:29] preached to the souls that were in
[0:30] prison. So that's going to be part of
[0:32] our subject matter today. And so I'm not
[0:34] going to not trying to hide anything
[0:35] here. And then it said that he that
[0:39] repented not in the longsuffering in the
[0:41] days of Noah. His body went into the
[0:43] grave, but before he died, he committed
[0:45] his spirit into the hands of God. So, if
[0:47] we're going to look at these elements
[0:49] and kind of have them out here at the
[0:51] outset, it says when Jesus died on the
[0:53] cross, his soul descended into hell,
[0:54] preached to souls in prison, and then it
[0:56] says that his body went to a grave and
[0:59] he committed his spirit into the hands
[1:00] of God. Now, he right before he goes
[1:04] through these steps in this order, he's
[1:06] say speaking of our own personal
[1:07] resurrection and he says our
[1:09] resurrection lays inside of us. So, we
[1:11] want to make this personal. We want to
[1:14] be thinking about this more broadly than
[1:15] just looking at something historical.
[1:18] But what does if I possess the
[1:20] resurrection, what does the resurrection
[1:21] mean for me? How is it going to manifest
[1:23] itself? And then just catch this in the
[1:25] outset. The order of the death to the
[1:27] body and the body goes to the grave. The
[1:29] soul goes to hell, but the spirit goes
[1:31] back to God. And brother Benham says
[1:33] that in a number of different places.
[1:35] And there are so many different
[1:36] supernatural events that the scripture
[1:38] records that unfold at the time of his
[1:40] death and at the very moment that he
[1:42] dies. Brother Brham is saying these
[1:44] different things happen and maybe three
[1:45] different ways things are going and so
[1:47] many different events unfold and as
[1:50] these events are unfolding it enters
[1:52] into what we would call a season of
[1:54] resurrection and appearing. Uh we know
[1:56] that even in the Bible when it talks
[1:58] about the first resurrection that is to
[1:59] come that it spans events that don't
[2:01] just take place in a moment. Uh even the
[2:04] rapture is not just something that takes
[2:05] place in a moment, but there's different
[2:06] events that start it. There's a season
[2:08] that takes place and and it's not cul
[2:11] doesn't even culminate till after the
[2:12] millennium. So there's a lot of events
[2:14] that begin to happen on this
[2:15] resurrection day that are a season of
[2:17] resurrection and appearing by Jesus
[2:19] Christ. And I would say it culminated on
[2:21] the day of Pentecost when he sent back
[2:23] the spirit and sealed those disciples,
[2:25] those in the upper room into the body of
[2:27] Christ.
[2:28] Now, in Acts chapter 1, I'm going to go
[2:30] through this quickly as I feel that
[2:32] time's already getting away from me. Uh,
[2:34] he's appeared to the disciples a number
[2:36] of times. Uh, this is maybe the 13th or
[2:39] 14th, depending on how you uh mark it
[2:41] down, uh, that he appeared to the
[2:43] disciples after his resurrection. And
[2:46] he's telling them, you shall receive
[2:47] power. In verse eight, you shall receive
[2:48] power after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[2:50] you. And so he's telling them go to
[2:52] Jerusalem, tarry there. And then when
[2:54] the day of Pentecost is fully come,
[2:56] there's going to be a moment of time
[2:57] when this dispensation is going to be
[2:59] ushered in. And so he's telling them to
[3:01] go tarry. And then as he's speaking
[3:02] these things, the Bible says, uh, he was
[3:05] taken up and a cloud received him out of
[3:08] their sight. And while they looked
[3:10] steadfastly towards heaven, as he went
[3:11] up, behold, two men stood by them in
[3:14] white apparel, which also said, "Ye men
[3:16] of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into
[3:19] heaven? This same Jesus which is taken
[3:22] up from you into heaven shall come in
[3:24] like manner as ye have seen him go into
[3:26] heaven. Now this is what would commonly
[3:29] be referred to as or is most often
[3:31] referred to as the ascension of the Lord
[3:34] Jesus Christ in this moment in this time
[3:36] where he's appearing to the disciples.
[3:38] This is the last recorded appearing of
[3:40] Christ to his disciples in bodily form.
[3:43] And as he's speaking to them, this event
[3:45] transpires to where he ascends back up
[3:47] into heaven and a cloud veils him and
[3:50] receives him out of their sight. And it
[3:52] says that the same Jesus uh who has been
[3:56] taken up into heaven, he will come in
[3:58] like manner. So they call this this this
[4:01] is his ascension.
[4:03] Now
[4:05] I I'm going to I want to be s looking at
[4:07] the subject of the ascension, but this
[4:09] is what is called the ascension, but
[4:10] it's not the only one. if I could say
[4:12] that. And so his death, his
[4:14] resurrection, it fulfilled scripture. It
[4:19] uh it was something that it it secured
[4:21] our redemption. And it's also
[4:24] foreshadowing our rapture.
[4:26] Bill says your your personal
[4:27] resurrection is inside of you. And as he
[4:30] brings up our resurrection in view, he
[4:32] uses the the death, burial, and
[4:34] resurrection of Jesus Christ a as a an
[4:37] immediate marker that you have a
[4:39] resurrection inside of you. And as when
[4:40] he died, his soul went to hell, his body
[4:42] went to the grave, and the spirit went
[4:44] to God. Now, when he ascends up into
[4:47] heaven, now we know in a few days,
[4:49] there's going to be ushering in of a of
[4:53] a new era, a new a new dispensation. And
[4:56] with that dispensation, there's going to
[4:58] be ushering in of the Gentiles, and
[4:59] great mysteries are going to be
[5:00] unfolding, and the gospel is going to be
[5:02] preached everywhere. But this,
[5:05] just keep in mind as we're referring to
[5:07] this, his death, burial, and
[5:09] resurrection was fulfilling prophecy,
[5:11] securing your redemption, but
[5:13] foreshadowing our own rapture.
[5:16] And so my title today is between hell
[5:19] and heaven
[5:21] and the mystery of Christ descending and
[5:25] ascending.
[5:27] Between hell and heaven.
[5:29] the mystery of Christ descending and
[5:32] ascending. And I trust I'll be able to
[5:35] finish this. If not, we have another
[5:37] service or two that we could spend on
[5:38] this. And I just pray that God would
[5:40] give me the grace to do it. It's a
[5:42] wonderful subject if you could focus
[5:44] between hell and heaven, the mystery of
[5:47] Christ descending and ascending. And
[5:49] what we'll do is I'd want to maybe tell
[5:50] a story or what we could do as we look
[5:52] at the scripture. will follow Christ
[5:54] from the cross uh to resurrection day
[5:57] and look at the different events that
[5:58] are unfolding from Friday to Sunday. And
[6:01] as we do it, remember I want you to see
[6:02] a type of your own personal
[6:04] resurrection. And I want us to see a
[6:05] type for today. Not just looking at it
[6:08] historically, but as a type for us, a
[6:10] type of the bride as we're looking at
[6:11] his resurrection, his death, burial, and
[6:13] resurrection to see even a pattern of
[6:15] the bride itself since we are one with
[6:17] the groom. And I'll say this, I think
[6:20] you're all familiar with the way in
[6:21] which I preach that um stay with me.
[6:24] Stick with me. Lord willing, the
[6:26] momentum will build. And if it at one
[6:28] point you just feel like I'm not getting
[6:29] anywhere, just know that after a while
[6:31] all of a sudden it's the color is going
[6:33] to start to pop um as additional layers
[6:36] get put on. So just stay focused. I
[6:38] believe God has something really special
[6:39] for us today as we look at this
[6:43] now.
[6:48] I think it still feels a little chalky
[6:50] in the air from all the uh all the dust.
[6:55] And so I apologize if I if my voice just
[6:57] doesn't work out just right. I'm I'm
[6:59] working through all the drywall. Now
[7:01] this this quote becomes my very critical
[7:04] and I hope you can just kind of grasp
[7:05] each little element of this and hold on
[7:07] to it. In the sermon the resurrection of
[7:09] Jesus, brother Ram says, "I think that
[7:11] one of the greatest scriptures that's
[7:13] more neglected than any scripture I know
[7:15] of being preached on is the ascension of
[7:19] the Lord Jesus and what he did after his
[7:22] resurrection."
[7:23] Now, catch that because he's he's
[7:25] talking about the ascension of the Lord
[7:27] Jesus, but he's not referring to Acts
[7:29] chapter 1. What is commonly called the
[7:32] ascension or the one that everyone looks
[7:33] at is when Christ has entered into
[7:35] heaven. And he says it's one of the
[7:37] greatest scriptures that's neglected
[7:39] than any scripture he knows of. And he
[7:41] says it's the ascension of the Lord
[7:43] Jesus and what he did after his
[7:45] resurrection. Now, he did not set down
[7:48] on the tomb after his resurrection
[7:51] because his work wasn't completed. It
[7:54] wasn't finished.
[7:55] We got I'm going to keep referring back
[7:57] to this and the more you hold on to it,
[7:58] the better these things will be able to
[7:59] click. So he says one of the greatest
[8:01] scripture that's neglected more than any
[8:03] other scripture he knows of is I would
[8:05] say the scriptures that tell of his
[8:06] ascension after his resurrection. And he
[8:10] says he didn't just sit down at the tomb
[8:12] and as they came everyone saw him and
[8:13] kind of participated in a homecoming
[8:15] because his work wasn't completed. It
[8:17] wasn't finished. So I want to look at
[8:19] this uh mystery ascension. This one that
[8:21] seems to be neglected. And I'm going to
[8:24] call it a mystery ascension, but not
[8:27] because it's necessarily a mystery in
[8:29] scripture, but because of the type.
[8:31] Brother Ram says it's neglected. So,
[8:33] this is the neglected ascension of
[8:35] Christ that was part of his redemptive
[8:37] work. And although we'll be able to see
[8:39] in the scripture that this isn't a
[8:41] mystery and that people recognize this,
[8:43] but it speaks of something for us,
[8:45] there's a divinely revealed truth that
[8:46] can be made known to us in looking at
[8:49] this ascension. So this is a neglected,
[8:51] if I could say even mysterious ascension
[8:54] of Christ that he says is part of his
[8:58] redemptive work.
[9:00] Now in Mark chapter 16:9
[9:03] says, "Now when Jesus was risen early
[9:05] the first day of the week," and there's
[9:07] more that uh the book of Mark goes
[9:09] through as he says at the beginning how
[9:11] that Mary uh and the mother of James and
[9:13] Saleom and Mary Magdalene uh were
[9:16] bringing spices. And so now this verse 9
[9:19] kind of gives us a more personal uh
[9:21] introduction to Mary Magdalene. And this
[9:24] is the first appearance of Christ after
[9:25] his resurrection. Says, "Now when Jesus
[9:28] was risen early the first day of the
[9:29] week, he appeared first to Mary
[9:31] Magdalene out of whom he had cast seven
[9:33] devils." I want this to be the starting
[9:35] point of our journey. We said we were
[9:37] going to follow Christ. I want to kind
[9:39] of start uh here and then maybe we'll do
[9:41] some flashbacks to the cross. But this
[9:43] is where I want to start in our journey.
[9:45] Christ appears to Mary at the at the
[9:49] after he has risen early the first day
[9:51] of the week. We could say Sunday
[9:52] morning. He appears first to Mary. And
[9:55] now again, we're wanting you to make
[9:57] this resurrection personal. If you look
[9:59] in the book of Luke in Luke chap 23 55
[10:04] and 56 and there it tells us how the
[10:05] women went uh to the supplr on the first
[10:08] day of the week and it tells us the one
[10:10] chapter is ending and comes into the
[10:12] next one. There were women that were
[10:13] going to be preparing spices. The day of
[10:15] preparation was on the Sabbath day. And
[10:17] so they're coming to the tomb early on
[10:19] Sunday morning. A and they're going to
[10:21] be bringing these spices. And as they
[10:23] come, um, the Bible says in Luke 24:10,
[10:27] it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and
[10:29] Mary the mother of James and other women
[10:31] that were with him, which told these
[10:33] things unto the disciples. So it's
[10:35] telling us the women that were present
[10:37] and those that had gone to to the
[10:40] suppler. And and I bring this up because
[10:43] as you read the places in the different
[10:44] gospels, each telling tells it from a
[10:47] different angle. Um Luke kind of gives a
[10:49] quick summary and tells like these women
[10:51] went and these things happened and maybe
[10:53] he leaves a lot to be desired in the
[10:54] chronology and the specific events and
[10:56] then another one tells a story and maybe
[10:58] you only hear about this angel and this
[11:00] one there's two angels and you hear all
[11:01] these different narratives and it's kind
[11:03] of hard to get the picture of well are
[11:05] they confusing women and how many women
[11:07] were there and who was first and who was
[11:08] last and how many ended up coming. And
[11:10] so you'll find that Matthew and Mark
[11:11] fill in other details about that
[11:13] morning, but they're all kind of giving
[11:15] this narrative of who came, when they
[11:17] came, and what was happening when they
[11:18] came. And as I've done this and read
[11:21] through this and just really labored
[11:22] intensively to try to just understand it
[11:24] in my own heart,
[11:26] uh, according to the message, as I read
[11:28] it in the message and are looking at
[11:29] these scriptures, the scripture suggests
[11:31] that Mary Magdalene must have been
[11:33] separated from the rest of the woman at
[11:34] some point, women at some point. And
[11:36] that's where we read in John 20:es 1 and
[11:39] 2. The first day of the week cometh Mary
[11:40] Magdalene early when it was yet dark
[11:42] under the sepllic and seeth the stone
[11:45] taken away from the sepllic. Now we
[11:47] could suppose that based upon these
[11:49] other scriptures she showed up with
[11:51] other women. But at this point she
[11:53] leaves. Says then she runth and cometh
[11:56] to Simon Peter and to the other disciple
[11:58] whom Jesus loved and saith unto him
[12:00] they've taken away the Lord out of the
[12:02] suppler and we know not where they have
[12:04] laid them. And so if you could just if
[12:07] you want some scriptures on this and
[12:09] other things, I'd be more than happy to
[12:10] share it with you. Uh but I just want to
[12:12] refer to it instead of just reading
[12:14] reading through each one of these
[12:16] instances. Uh based upon the scripture,
[12:18] these other women would have remained
[12:20] behind at this point. They're maybe
[12:22] pondering what's happening and
[12:23] considering what must be and uh even
[12:26] looking in and examining the scene
[12:28] because they think maybe grave robbers
[12:29] have come and taken the body. And so the
[12:32] other women remain behind. And as they
[12:33] remain behind in Mark chapter 16,
[12:35] Matthew 28, they have an encounter with
[12:37] angels and the angels say, "Go tell the
[12:40] disciples."
[12:42] And so as they are leaving themselves to
[12:44] go tell the disciples and and we have to
[12:47] look at it this way, you know, the time
[12:49] and distance that they must have
[12:50] traveled, it's not very clear in the
[12:51] scripture, but I don't think they were
[12:53] just going around the corner. And I
[12:55] don't think they had the loop 777 or
[12:57] loop 333 uh in that day to be able to
[13:00] navigate and get around uh Judea. And
[13:02] so, who knows how long this is taking,
[13:04] but these are the order of events. And
[13:07] so, in John 20:es 3-10, Peter and John
[13:11] come, they enter into the tomb, they
[13:13] look around, and the Bible tells us in
[13:15] verse 10 that they go home. And as
[13:17] they're going home, uh, no doubt they
[13:20] might have just missed the other women.
[13:21] They leave and within some time period,
[13:23] Peter and John show with Mary Magdalene.
[13:26] And while these other women are leaving,
[13:28] and as they leaded to go home, the Bible
[13:30] says in verse 11 that Mary stood without
[13:32] at the suppler weeping. And as she wept,
[13:35] she stooped down and looked into the
[13:36] sepiler and seeth two angels in white
[13:38] sitting, the one at the head and the
[13:40] other at the feet where the body of
[13:42] Jesus had lain.
[13:46] And they say unto her, why weepest thou?
[13:48] Now, let's concentrate on this. There's
[13:50] some some beautiful things in here. She
[13:52] said to him, "Because they have taken
[13:54] away my Lord and I know not where they
[13:56] have laid him." So there's probably some
[13:58] panic on their part. They wanted to do
[14:01] service to this body. They wanted to
[14:02] prepare it with spices. They they wanted
[14:04] to show that honor uh in this burial.
[14:07] And now they believe that somebody
[14:08] nefariously has taken the body. And so
[14:11] it's not from this place of did you see
[14:13] the resurrection? Where is he? Have you
[14:15] heard of him? It's a different state of
[14:16] mind at this moment. And so when she had
[14:19] thus said she turned herself back and it
[14:22] says and saw Jesus standing. So in this
[14:26] moment I I want you to picture just to
[14:28] past based upon the language here she's
[14:30] looking at him
[14:31] and the Bible tells that she sees Jesus
[14:34] but it says and she didn't know who he
[14:36] was
[14:36] and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus
[14:39] saith unto her. Now he's speaking her
[14:41] woman why weepest thou? Whom seeketh
[14:43] thou? So now having seen him and even
[14:46] him speaking says she's supposing him to
[14:49] be the gardener say to him sir if thou
[14:51] hast borne him hence if you've done
[14:53] something with the body tell me where
[14:55] thou hast laid him and I will take him
[14:57] away. Last week I spent a considerable
[15:00] amount of time thinking about this
[15:02] scripture and I thought perhaps this
[15:04] would be the subject that I would
[15:05] minister on is how Christ was
[15:07] unrecognizable at his resurrection
[15:10] and how even these to one whom uh seven
[15:13] devils were cast out of Mary Magdalene
[15:15] and whether you want to look at that in
[15:17] terms of the type of the church ages how
[15:19] Christ was standing in the midst of the
[15:20] disciples delivering women and God was
[15:23] moving and working and doing many mighty
[15:24] things in the midst of the in the
[15:26] presence of the disciples in the midst
[15:28] of the disciples. And now that he has
[15:30] gone away, when he comes back again and
[15:32] he's he's put out, but through death and
[15:34] he's crucified and he comes back again,
[15:37] he's unrecognizable.
[15:39] She doesn't even She's looking right at
[15:41] him and he hears him speak and she
[15:42] doesn't recognize who he is. And if I
[15:45] could say this, I don't often like to uh
[15:47] kind of conjecture or say I don't know
[15:49] if it is, but could it be? But he
[15:51] probably looked 18 years old. Right.
[15:55] And so as she's looking to find a Christ
[15:57] who brother Brandham said that was a man
[16:00] they said you're a man not not over 50.
[16:02] Uh a and you say or you're a man around
[16:05] 50 and you say that you were before
[16:06] Abraham was. I am. This means the life
[16:08] that Christ had lived had caused him to
[16:10] look worn down and aged and at that
[16:13] point in his life he looks he's in his
[16:15] 50s and who knows what he might have
[16:17] looked at by the time that he comes to
[16:19] the cross. And so she's looking for
[16:21] Christ that that had some sort of image
[16:25] of what he was when he left,
[16:27] what he was when he died.
[16:29] But now that he's resurrected, he's in a
[16:31] pattern of the resurrection and he's
[16:33] expressing something to us what the
[16:35] resurrection holds. And so when she
[16:37] looks, she sees an 18-year-old, and
[16:39] that's not what she's looking for. So
[16:41] she doesn't recognize him. And let that
[16:43] be a lesson to us who are looking for
[16:45] Christ in a day gone by and not
[16:47] recognizing him in his power and under
[16:49] the promised word that he's ordained in
[16:50] the time that he's revealed himself.
[16:53] So she doesn't recognize him.
[16:55] Foreshadowing and here he is perhaps in
[16:57] a young body, a young man a and his and
[17:02] his visage and everything. The way that
[17:04] he would strike the person is different
[17:07] foreshadowing even our own resurrection.
[17:12] Let me just see where let's pick up in
[17:14] verse 16. I think that's where we're at.
[17:17] So now it says, "Jesus saith unto her,
[17:19] Mary." I love this. Isn't this good
[17:21] stuff?
[17:23] He appears and he speaks and she doesn't
[17:25] recognize him, but when he calls her
[17:27] name,
[17:29] can you make application to you
[17:31] how this message when Christ is
[17:33] revealing himself and maybe he's not
[17:35] quite recognizable, but it's it's in the
[17:38] name calling. He calls your name, makes
[17:40] it personal, and says she turned
[17:41] herself,
[17:43] said unto him, "Rabbonai," which is to
[17:45] say, "Master."
[17:46] So, there's this recognition. Now, she
[17:48] knows you. You you you don't look like I
[17:51] was expecting. You you you've changed.
[17:53] You're in a different image. You're
[17:54] revealing yourself in a different way.
[17:56] Maybe she's overwhelmed. That now she
[17:58] knows. And I thought about this that
[18:00] Mary Magdalene would have known him in
[18:02] the days of his ministry when seven
[18:03] devils were cast out. But I wondered if
[18:05] that had been Mary, his mother, if she
[18:07] would have that what would have struck
[18:08] her when she sees an 18-year-old boy and
[18:10] says, "Oh, oh my Jesus, that it's you."
[18:14] She would have felt something and had
[18:15] that akinship and that familiarity. But
[18:18] it's the name that is called that gets
[18:20] her attention.
[18:22] And then verse 17, Jesus saith unto her,
[18:24] "Touch me not,
[18:29] for I'm not yet ascended to my father,
[18:31] but go to my brethren." Now notice how
[18:34] it's gone from servants to friends to
[18:36] brothers.
[18:38] Not even disciples. Now it says, "You go
[18:40] to my brothers. You go to my brethren
[18:43] and say unto them, I ascend unto my
[18:46] father and your father and to my God and
[18:49] your God."
[18:50] I think that would preach.
[18:53] I think that that that is striking. You
[18:56] go to my brothers, you go to my family,
[18:57] you go to my kin, my kinship. And he's
[18:59] not just talking about something
[19:01] different anymore because now the
[19:03] sacrifice has been made. So now kinship
[19:05] is being established. This is a kinsman
[19:07] redeemer. I ascend. Now this is
[19:09] important. I ascend into my father and
[19:11] your father and I ascend to my God, your
[19:13] God. And it says in verse 18, Mary
[19:15] Magdalene came and told the disciples
[19:16] that she had seen the Lord and that he
[19:18] had spoken these things unto her.
[19:21] So this is Mark 16
[19:24] verse 9 wherein he first appears to Mary
[19:27] Magdalene. He had resurrected from the
[19:29] grave. That body that Jesus said went to
[19:32] the that brother Ram said went to the
[19:34] grave has been raised. The tomb is
[19:37] empty. So whatever flesh that was has
[19:38] gone through this process now where it's
[19:40] resurrected
[19:41] and Christ is in this body. So he's
[19:44] resurrected from the grave and he first
[19:46] appears to Mary. Now, in question and
[19:49] answers in 1961,
[19:51] uh I I kind of cut out the dialogue that
[19:53] was going back and forth, but brother
[19:55] Bram's asked a question, and he's
[19:56] talking about theophanes and different
[19:58] bodies, and he's the the angel that is
[20:00] before the face, I think, uh uh the
[20:02] father. I think that may be the question
[20:03] and answers it's coming from. And then
[20:05] another brother begins to say, "Oh,
[20:07] well, what about this that happened in
[20:09] the book of John?" And brother said, and
[20:12] he's saying that he to Mary Magdalene
[20:14] says, "Don't touch me." But then to
[20:16] Thomas, he did. Brother Brandham says he
[20:19] hadn't ascended up yet.
[20:22] And then there's some dialogue back and
[20:24] forth and I just have that kind of
[20:26] marked there. He says he wasn't to be
[20:28] touched. Now I know this in my mind I
[20:30] know it loomed very very large and we
[20:32] read a lot into it. Uh but let's just
[20:34] say instead of trying to speculate as to
[20:36] why we just know that this is what is
[20:39] and in this moment this is what Christ
[20:41] says, touch me not. He wasn't to be
[20:44] touched until after his resurrection.
[20:47] And and he says he had come out from the
[20:49] earth. He had come out from the earth
[20:51] and was walking among men. Notice, but
[20:54] he had not yet descended
[20:57] or ascended, sorry. He had not yet
[20:59] ascended. He told Mary, he said, "Don't
[21:01] touch me." She said, "Raboni," he said,
[21:03] "don't touch me." Now this is why for I
[21:06] have not yet ascended to my father but I
[21:10] ascend to my God and to your God to my
[21:13] father and your father. So now brother
[21:16] Brandham in this one instance is taking
[21:18] this scriptural passage and he's
[21:20] highlighting the fact that he says don't
[21:22] touch me because I have not yet
[21:25] ascended.
[21:26] I need to ascend. Don't touch me now
[21:29] because I haven't ascended yet. And the
[21:32] the the phrase that's used there when he
[21:35] says touch me not,
[21:37] it it has nothing to do with uh the
[21:40] sense of touch in order to determine
[21:42] whether or not he's a ghost or a phantom
[21:44] or to see that he's real. It's not
[21:47] indicating some function on her part
[21:49] just to have the sense of touch. But the
[21:51] word means he says do not touch me. It
[21:53] says do not detain me. Uh do not
[21:57] restrain me. Do not delay me. That's
[22:00] what that's what it says. do not touch
[22:01] me. In other words, don't constrain me.
[22:02] Don't hold me back. Don't delay me by
[22:05] embracing me. But he says, instead of
[22:08] now clinging to me and holding me now,
[22:11] you've got a job to do and I've got a
[22:13] job to do.
[22:14] Go tell my brethren. Go and tell my
[22:17] brethren. And so now I want you to think
[22:19] now, why would Christ say in this moment
[22:23] at this particular time after there's
[22:26] already been some activity that they
[22:27] come the grave is empty. She's got time
[22:29] to run and go back and get Simon, Peter,
[22:32] and John. The other women remain behind.
[22:34] They see angels. Angel said, "Go tell my
[22:36] disciples." Mary Magdalene gets to Simon
[22:38] and John first. They're on their way
[22:40] back. These other women have left. And
[22:42] all these events are taking place and
[22:43] then Christ appears to Mary. Why would
[22:45] he say, "Don't hold me back, but go tell
[22:48] the other disciples you've seen me."
[22:51] And in Matthew chap 28 8-10,
[22:56] this is now after the other women
[23:00] have come come back.
[23:03] And Lord, help me just explain this.
[23:08] As Mary Magdalene has come, these other
[23:10] women are leaving. And as they're on
[23:13] their way back or away to go find
[23:15] disciples, she has this meeting with
[23:17] Christ and it's very quick.
[23:20] And then so during some time is passing
[23:24] and it says and they these other women
[23:26] departed quickly from the supplr with
[23:28] fear and great joy because now the
[23:30] angels have announced this and did run
[23:32] to bring his disciples word. And as they
[23:35] went to tell his disciples, behold Jesus
[23:38] met them saying all hell.
[23:41] And so now as he has arrested them and
[23:45] stopped them in their going back to tell
[23:47] the disciples notice what happens and
[23:49] they came and held him by the feet and
[23:52] worshiped him. So now in this chronology
[23:56] in this story as it's unfolding in one
[23:58] instance Jesus says don't stop me I have
[24:02] yet to ascend to my father. Now in just
[24:05] some period of time after that he
[24:07] appears to these other women and when he
[24:09] stops them he says all hell they hold
[24:12] him by the feet and worship him.
[24:15] Now this is not another uh writing of
[24:18] how he appeared to Mary Magdalene. This
[24:19] is a different appearing. And they came
[24:21] and held him by his feet and worshiped
[24:23] him. Then said Jesus unto them be not
[24:25] afraid. Go tell my brethren that they go
[24:28] into Galilee and there shall they see
[24:31] me.
[24:32] Now, what I want to identify and point
[24:34] out is something had happened
[24:36] from the time that he appeared and
[24:38] showed himself to Mary Magdalene and the
[24:41] time that he appears and shows himself
[24:42] to these other women.
[24:44] Because in the one instance, Brother
[24:46] Brandham says he couldn't be touched
[24:47] until he ascended to the father.
[24:50] But now he appears to these women and he
[24:53] allows these women to hold him by the
[24:55] feet. Again, let me say this. Something
[24:58] happened between meeting Mary Magdalene
[25:00] and this meeting with the other women.
[25:02] So let me use the phrase that brother
[25:03] Brandham used. His work wasn't
[25:06] completed. It wasn't finished.
[25:09] So when he comes and he reveals himself
[25:11] to Mary Magdalene and whatever reasons
[25:13] you might want to fill in the void there
[25:15] in your heart, why would he appear to
[25:17] her? And what does it represent and what
[25:18] does it signify? I'll just say this.
[25:20] There's meaning to these things.
[25:22] But instead of venturing, instead of
[25:24] going into those areas now, as he meets
[25:27] her, it's do not touch me because I need
[25:30] to ascend to my father. I I have, as we
[25:33] could put in brother Brown's word, I
[25:34] have work that's not completed. Remember
[25:36] this this neglected part of the
[25:38] scripture is his ascension after his
[25:40] resurrection. And his work's not
[25:42] completed. It's not finished. He had to
[25:45] ascend into heaven.
[25:48] This is mysterious. I would say it's in
[25:50] the scripture, but it's mysterious. At
[25:52] the very least, it's neglected.
[25:54] Amen.
[25:55] This ascension,
[25:56] good.
[25:57] But if we could just pause right here, I
[26:00] don't know if I'm piecing this together
[26:02] in a as with with kind of the use of
[26:05] flashbacks and everything, this would
[26:07] make for a good film. But now, before he
[26:11] could ascend
[26:12] or say this, before he ascended, he
[26:15] descended. Right
[26:17] before this neglected ascension, we have
[26:20] what is often missed and it's a
[26:22] neglected descension.
[26:24] I can say the mystery descending of
[26:27] Christ. Not that it's not in scripture
[26:30] and it's not laid out, but the type
[26:33] which is a mystery. So now before we get
[26:36] to this moment between meeting with Mary
[26:39] Magdalene and the meeting the other
[26:41] women, let's flash back to the cross in
[26:44] his descending.
[26:46] In Ephesians 4:es 9 and 10, it says,
[26:48] "Now he descend." Now, now that he
[26:50] ascended, what is it? But that he also
[26:53] descended first, catch the language,
[26:55] into the lower parts of the earth. He
[26:58] that descended is the same also that
[26:59] ascended up far above all heavens that
[27:02] he might fill all things.
[27:04] Now, we could use this in different ways
[27:06] and type certain things and make it
[27:08] applicable to uh since it's the f
[27:10] fulfilling completion of all things.
[27:12] There's ways that we make this relevant
[27:14] to every aspect of his ministry. But
[27:16] with respect to his descending and
[27:18] descending, he that descended to the
[27:21] lower parts of the earth also ascended
[27:23] up above all natural heavens for the
[27:26] purpose of filling all things to
[27:28] complete or fulfill.
[27:30] So this is something that he had to do
[27:32] to finish his work.
[27:34] He descends and he also says he that
[27:36] descended. He said he that ascended.
[27:38] Well that's Christ who ascended up into
[27:40] heaven. But he didn't just ascend. He
[27:42] first descended into the lower parts of
[27:45] the earth in order to finish his work.
[27:49] So before he ascended, he descended. We
[27:51] got that.
[27:52] All right. So if I have to start all
[27:53] over, that's where we'll come back to.
[27:55] He first ascended before he descended.
[27:57] And when he descended, it says he went
[27:59] into a lower dimension. He goes into the
[28:03] lower parts of the earth. And so this is
[28:05] signifying some other realm. It's not
[28:06] that he dug down to the core. It doesn't
[28:08] even refer to the physical depth of of
[28:10] the natural earth, but he's going down
[28:12] into another dimension. And this is part
[28:15] of his ministry.
[28:17] In Psalm 16:10, it says, "I will not
[28:20] leave my soul in hell." All right? The
[28:22] Bible says it. We'll come to it here in
[28:23] a moment. I will not leave it in that
[28:25] grave or what is referred to as shel,
[28:27] the underworld of sinners that are
[28:30] waiting punishment.
[28:31] He descends first into the lower parts
[28:33] of the earth. There's this place, Hades,
[28:35] the grave. There's a place of waiting
[28:36] for those who sinned. And if you think
[28:39] that's striking, Jesus descended to this
[28:43] place where sinners are awaiting
[28:44] punishment. He had to
[28:47] in Isaiah 53:6.
[28:53] All right, before I continue, are you
[28:55] comfortable this morning? Everybody
[28:56] feeling good. So good to see you all
[28:58] here. And I've got to get used to a a
[29:00] little bit more of a broader sweep,
[29:02] maybe. And I got to project my voice a
[29:04] little bit deeper. I just love to be
[29:06] able to say those in the balcony, you
[29:09] know, up there and and just acknowledge
[29:11] those in the balcony
[29:14] and we can say come down.
[29:20] Now Jesus has descended into hell.
[29:25] And you say, well, why would he have to
[29:27] do that? Isaiah 53:6, this is the
[29:29] prophecy of Christ. This is a prophecy
[29:31] of the Messiah being a lamb, a
[29:33] perpetuation. All we like sheep have
[29:35] gone astray. We have turned everyone to
[29:38] his own way and the Lord hath laid on
[29:41] him the iniquity of us all.
[29:44] So as he's hanging upon the cross, our
[29:47] sins are transferred to the innocent
[29:49] lamb. Now think of all the shadows and
[29:50] types and through the sacrifices. And so
[29:53] as he then becomes sin for our sake, he
[29:57] is then a a sin bearer and be bearing
[30:01] sin. He had to go to hell.
[30:06] There's a lot more here that we could we
[30:07] could preach on in this way, but I'm
[30:09] just wanted to take a journey. And maybe
[30:11] there's different things. Oh, I want to
[30:12] come back to that later. I want to come
[30:13] back to that later. Maybe we're just
[30:14] getting through this a little bit too
[30:15] fast. But he had to go to hell because
[30:17] of our sin. there. There's no other
[30:19] place that soul could have gone if it
[30:22] somehow our sins are on that soul. God's
[30:24] word cannot lie. He had to make that
[30:27] appearance in hell. He had to go to
[30:29] hell. Brother Brandham says in question
[30:31] and answers on the seals when Jesus
[30:32] died, excuse me, Jesus when he died, he
[30:35] went to hell because he had to go there.
[30:37] He was the sin bearer.
[30:40] And I love this. In one sense, he had to
[30:42] go there because he had sin and that's
[30:45] where the sinner goes. But I love this.
[30:47] He had our sin and went to hell to put
[30:50] it back where it belonged. He was not
[30:53] just sinful, but it says he was a sin
[30:56] bearer. And he had to take all, thank
[30:59] God, he had to take all of our sins,
[31:02] bore them on the cross, and in a great
[31:04] switch on the devil, took our sins and
[31:07] carried them back to where they would be
[31:09] forever destroyed.
[31:12] Carried our sins there to hell. He had
[31:13] to go to hell because he was a sin
[31:15] bearer. Brother Brandham. And now if
[31:18] you're saying, "My brother Aaron, you're
[31:19] just you're catching sound bites." Uh if
[31:22] you want, we can have another service
[31:24] and I'll read to you all the quotes that
[31:27] I'm pulling these things from because I
[31:28] promise you, I didn't print this out at
[31:31] sermons.net.
[31:34] I didn't use chat GPT either. Don't have
[31:37] my hands on engine number five. This is
[31:40] this is the original way.
[31:42] He says, "But now let's watch him after
[31:44] he died." We're kind of going back to
[31:47] the cross. And when he dies, brother
[31:48] Brandon said, "His soul went to hell,
[31:49] his body went to the grave, his spirit
[31:50] went to God." He says, "Watch him." When
[31:52] he died, he said he still went on
[31:55] conquering.
[31:57] Here he is in the days of his ministry
[31:59] casting out seven demons from Mary
[32:00] Magdalene. He's raising the dead. He's
[32:02] multiplying bread. He's multiplying
[32:04] fish. He He's walking on water. He's a
[32:06] mighty conqueror. He's casting out
[32:09] demons. Here he is. He he he's he's
[32:12] vanquishing foes and he hangs upon the
[32:14] cross and he dies and his death, oh what
[32:17] a sorrow. What a defeat. What a what a
[32:21] what a terrible tragedy. But beyond the
[32:23] veil of death, beyond what the eye could
[32:26] see in the moment when this man who was
[32:28] beaten and bloody and unrecognizable. A
[32:31] man at the very best looked 50 and
[32:33] completely destroyed in his body and
[32:35] ravaged laying there. Think what a
[32:37] pitiful, awful death. But God used that
[32:40] as a screen, as a veil. But because
[32:44] behind that dead body was a mighty
[32:46] conqueror who was not done conquering.
[32:50] That's right.
[32:53] He still went on conquering. He says he
[32:55] never ended at the grave.
[32:57] Why? Because according to Genesis 3:15,
[33:00] that what you saw on the cross was just
[33:02] a bruise to a hill.
[33:04] Now came the crushing of the serpent's
[33:06] head. Amen.
[33:08] And so then we see him and his
[33:09] appearance to John. You'd even count
[33:11] this as one of the appearances after
[33:13] he's ascended into heaven. You'll find
[33:15] after he ascends in Acts chapter 1, all
[33:17] of his appearances, there's a few to
[33:19] Paul where it says, "The Lord stood by
[33:21] me. The Lord spoke to me." But the ones
[33:22] where it speaks, he says, "From heaven.
[33:24] From heaven, from heaven." Because this
[33:26] is where he was making himself known
[33:27] during that dispensation.
[33:29] And then when we see him in Revelations
[33:31] 1 18 now on the cross, he's dead.
[33:35] Think of that body. what it would look
[33:36] like. Doesn't look like a conqueror at
[33:38] all. But brother Bam's telling us he
[33:39] went to he went to hell as a sin bearer.
[33:43] But not just as a sin bear, a conqueror.
[33:45] So then when John sees him, it says, "I
[33:48] am he that liveth and was dead." So now
[33:52] he's wanting us to think about his
[33:53] death. So here he is on the cross. We go
[33:55] from the cross there on the day of his
[33:57] crucifixion. He says, "But I'm alive."
[33:59] And he says, "I am alive forever more.
[34:02] Amen. And have the keys of hell and of
[34:04] death. Amen.
[34:06] Where did he get the keys?
[34:08] Where did he get them? Someone someone
[34:10] thought they had them and thought they
[34:11] were theirs, but now is the sin bearer.
[34:13] He goes to make a deposit for our sins
[34:16] and he takes our sins and exchanges them
[34:19] for the keys to death and hell.
[34:21] He had the price to get that back. So
[34:24] when he goes to the great hell, he's not
[34:26] there to stay because he's sinful. And
[34:29] the devil thinks, "I've got him just
[34:30] like I got that one. I've got this one.
[34:32] Like I got that one." He comes and takes
[34:34] our sins, lays them there in that pit,
[34:37] but now he snatches the keys of hell and
[34:39] death.
[34:41] Woo! Praise the Lord.
[34:45] Brother Brandham in question and answers
[34:47] on Hebrews chap part two, he says, "Then
[34:50] he ascended into hell and received the
[34:53] keys of death and hell from the devil."
[34:56] It's really neat to read those how he
[34:58] dramatizes how he got those keys. And
[35:01] you'll realize too when brother Bram's
[35:03] using the drama, he he's expressing it.
[35:05] Not that we would try to take everything
[35:07] perfectly literal, but he's using his
[35:08] way to represent to us the transaction
[35:12] and what took place.
[35:13] He ascends into hell and receives the
[35:15] keys of death and hell from the devil.
[35:17] This is that what I call that mis
[35:19] mystery descending.
[35:21] Here's his body on the cross. And while
[35:23] his body has even yet make to grave,
[35:25] he's still conquering
[35:27] and goes to hell.
[35:28] He's got a job to do. these sins. You
[35:31] started this, devil.
[35:32] Here it is. I paid the price. I was
[35:35] sinless. So what I carry here, I I don't
[35:38] have to answer for. I don't even have to
[35:40] have a sacrifice for myself. I'm the
[35:42] sinless sacrifice depositing the sins of
[35:44] all the world right here at your
[35:46] footstep. And why the devil dramatizing
[35:48] is caught off guard by the amount of
[35:50] sins that are filling up hell. Wait, how
[35:52] does this happen? Wait, you can't just
[35:53] leave these here. And while he's looking
[35:54] around, Jesus just takes the keys.
[35:56] Amen. That's good.
[35:58] And brother Ramon says he he slammed the
[36:01] do door on the devil. Now he's stuck
[36:02] there.
[36:05] Now notice what Peter says in 1 Peter
[36:06] chapter 3 18 to1 19. For Christ also
[36:10] hath once suffered for sins, the just
[36:13] for the unjust. Remember this phrase
[36:16] that he might bring us to God. Right.
[36:18] Right.
[36:18] So this is this is the whole point of
[36:21] this uh I say this is the whole point
[36:23] but that that's the outcome is this
[36:26] union this harmony this fellowship. And
[36:28] I'll say this uh because this is
[36:30] tracking the other some of the other
[36:32] subjects that I've been studying on to
[36:33] minister. When I said between hell and
[36:37] heaven I would guess at least one of you
[36:40] thought I was talking about your choice.
[36:44] Where do you want to end up? And maybe
[36:47] maybe I could have conditioned my family
[36:49] just so I could be absolutely certain of
[36:50] that. But maybe it's the Sunday school
[36:52] age. Maybe somebody said, "Oh, between
[36:53] hell and heaven." Yeah, that's we make
[36:55] our choice. Where are we going to end
[36:56] up? Well, that's kind of a dichotomy
[36:59] that the nominal church world in the
[37:01] Catholic Church wants to impose as your
[37:03] main view,
[37:04] right?
[37:05] But that's not the view of the word.
[37:07] Amen.
[37:09] So he says that he might bring us to
[37:12] God.
[37:14] Now, as as the offering for sins, now
[37:17] being put to death in the flesh, but
[37:20] quickened by the spirit.
[37:22] So, though the body died, there's a
[37:24] quickening by the spirit. And notice
[37:26] what he says, by which also he went and
[37:28] preached unto the spirits in prison.
[37:32] Now, there's many writers that speculate
[37:34] he's referring to how it was the spirit
[37:37] of Christ in Noah that preached to those
[37:39] who were going to be in chains of
[37:41] judgment when the flood came on the
[37:42] earth. And no doubt you read it that way
[37:45] and it's applicable that that that's
[37:47] exactly how it would read. But what you
[37:50] recognize from Ephesians chapter 4 and
[37:54] from Revelations chapter 1 and even the
[37:58] these other scriptures we're looking at,
[38:00] Christ descends. I will not leave my
[38:02] soul in hell. Christ descends to that
[38:04] pit. He descends to that place. And so
[38:06] here's this I want to say mystery part
[38:09] of it, but maybe it's just neglected and
[38:10] not obvious. He went and preached unto
[38:12] the spirits in prison.
[38:14] Right?
[38:15] These are ones that we he says are
[38:17] eternally lost.
[38:19] In question and answers on Hebrews again
[38:22] uh part two, when he arose from the
[38:24] dead, and notice where brother's placing
[38:27] this, he absolutely wasn't finished with
[38:29] the work of redemption yet.
[38:31] Absolutely wasn't finished.
[38:33] That's right. He had to clean the whole
[38:36] thing out.
[38:38] Please keep that in mind. when he rose
[38:41] from the dead, he wasn't absolutely
[38:42] finished from the from with the work of
[38:44] redemption yet. So now, as he says, when
[38:45] he rose, he wasn't finished. He says he
[38:48] had to clean the whole thing out. There
[38:50] had to be a cleansing, a purging. He
[38:53] says the price had been paid, but now
[38:55] notice what he says. But the horror of
[38:57] hell, the horror of the grave.
[39:00] So now, and I hope that you understand,
[39:02] I'm not trying to take I'm not trying to
[39:05] change what he says. Just recognize in
[39:07] one sense when he rose from the dead,
[39:09] he's not finished. He had to clean
[39:11] things out. But now he says once the
[39:13] price is paid, that's on the day of his
[39:15] crucifixion as he hangs on the cross.
[39:17] They're still the spectre of hell,
[39:19] the of the grave, death and hell
[39:22] are this imposing figure. And here when
[39:25] he died, now he comes back to when he
[39:26] died, not after his resurrection, the
[39:28] work that was to take place, but now
[39:30] when he died, he went right on. He never
[39:32] ceased working. And when he died, he
[39:35] kept on preaching.
[39:37] The mighty conqueror. When he said he
[39:39] never ended at the grave, after he died,
[39:42] he still went conquering. After he died,
[39:44] he didn't stop working. After he died,
[39:47] he still kept preaching.
[39:48] Why? Because he had to clean the whole
[39:50] thing out.
[39:51] He's filling He's fulfilling the
[39:52] substance of the shadow.
[39:55] Remember this. He's fulfilling the
[39:56] substance of the shadow that all the
[39:57] sacrifices were reflecting.
[40:00] Now to further drill this down that in
[40:02] his descending he first goes to hell in
[40:06] Psalm 16:10-11
[40:10] for thou wil not leave my soul in hell
[40:13] neither wil thou suffer thine holy one
[40:15] to see corruption
[40:17] now this becomes his ministry is
[40:19] fulfilling prophecy
[40:21] but it's also bound by prophecy so
[40:24] prophecy is telling him how far he can
[40:26] go it's telling him that he must go it's
[40:28] telling him how far he can
[40:29] So when his
[40:32] uh I will not leave my soul in hell,
[40:35] neither wil thou suffer that holy one to
[40:37] see corruption. Then his soul, the Bible
[40:39] says his soul descends to hell, but it
[40:42] has to be for a limited duration
[40:45] because before corruption can set in
[40:47] that body,
[40:48] he's got to return to it.
[40:50] And so the Bible is telling us that his,
[40:54] like I say, his ministry in hell is
[40:56] fulfilling prophecy, but bound by
[40:58] prophecy.
[40:59] So he had to descend into hell, right?
[41:02] Do you catch this? He had to descend
[41:04] into hell. It's part of his ministry,
[41:06] right?
[41:07] It's part of his work. It's part of his
[41:09] conquering. He had to go and clean
[41:11] everything out. But he couldn't stay
[41:13] there,
[41:15] says, "But I will not let him the holy
[41:17] one see corruption." So he goes to hell
[41:20] by prophecy. He goes to hell because
[41:22] we've laid all of our sins have been
[41:24] laid upon him. So there's this prophecy
[41:26] that the sinless one, the just for the
[41:28] unjust, is going to be cast down into
[41:30] hell. But Jesus knows when he goes, the
[41:33] same power that's going to put him in
[41:35] the grave. Is going to be the same power
[41:37] that's going to take him out. He knows
[41:39] that he can't stay there. So there's no
[41:41] fear as he approaches the doors of hell.
[41:43] Amen.
[41:45] Because he says, "I know I'm only here
[41:46] for a limited time.
[41:48] And he says, "Thou will show me the path
[41:50] of life." This is this is the I will not
[41:53] let my holy one see corruption, but he's
[41:55] but he'll he'll show me the path of
[41:57] life. In thy presence is fullness of
[41:59] joy. At thy right hand there are
[42:01] pleasures forever more. It's going to
[42:03] say there's a path from hell to heaven.
[42:06] There's going to be a path made, a path
[42:08] of life into the presence. It's going to
[42:11] indicate joy. There's going to be a
[42:12] place of power where there's pleasures
[42:14] forever more. He descends into hell.
[42:16] He's still preaching. He's still
[42:18] conquering. He has to work to do, but
[42:20] there's more to fulfill.
[42:22] He's got to follow the path of life. He
[42:24] has got to clean the whole thing out.
[42:26] Brother Brandham dramatizes this in the
[42:28] faith of Abraham. He says, "I can see
[42:30] when that obedient son when he died, he
[42:32] went over there and knocked on the gates
[42:33] of the souls that were in prison that
[42:35] repented not in the longsuffering of the
[42:37] days of Noah." This bringing from 1
[42:38] Peter 3. Now, that's his soul descending
[42:42] to hell. But notice how quickly he says,
[42:44] "Old Abraham and them were waiting that
[42:46] promise. Now, they're not in hell,
[42:48] right?
[42:49] They're not in a place of torment. The
[42:51] scripture tells us in the parable of
[42:52] Lazarus, he's not in a place of torment.
[42:54] The sinner's in a place of torment. The
[42:55] rich young ruler, the rich man is in a
[42:57] place of torment. So Abraham and all
[42:59] these others, they're not in hell
[43:00] getting a sermon. They're not the ones
[43:03] that see Jesus showed show up laden down
[43:05] with sins and burdened with sin. No,
[43:07] that's his soul descending to hell.
[43:09] Brother Brandham says Abraham and those
[43:11] others are waiting that promised Christ.
[43:14] And while they're waiting, he's down in
[43:16] hell
[43:17] because he had sin.
[43:19] And he's grabbing the the keys to hell
[43:21] in the grave. And brother, brother Bam
[43:23] saying, Abraham's waiting. And then he
[43:25] begins to dramatize it a little bit. And
[43:27] as he dramatizes, Jesus is having this
[43:29] conversation with Satan. And he says
[43:31] that Jesus says, "So give me them keys
[43:33] of death and hell. I'm taking over down
[43:36] here."
[43:37] Hallelujah. Slap them over to one side.
[43:40] Slam the door in his face.
[43:43] Glory.
[43:44] This is happening to hell. This is
[43:46] happening to Satan. This is happening to
[43:48] his power. This is redemption. Let's go
[43:50] to hell. Let's take the keys back. Let's
[43:53] go to the grave. Let's take the keys
[43:54] back.
[43:58] Slams the door on the devil. And that's
[44:01] my words. I'll just use that in place of
[44:03] the comma. Started back up.
[44:07] Christ descended,
[44:09] but now he's starting back up.
[44:10] Amen.
[44:12] And brother Bam said, "There's another
[44:13] group sitting over yonder waiting,
[44:16] the righteous in paradise,
[44:18] the souls in prison now, the souls in
[44:21] hell." And he descends and he preaches
[44:23] to them that are eternally lost. That's
[44:25] part of his ministry. Still preaching,
[44:27] still conquering. But when he's done,
[44:29] that's not all his ministry is.
[44:31] Amen.
[44:32] There's others that are waiting for the
[44:33] promise in paradise. He said in Luke
[44:35] 23:es 42 and 43 as he hung on the cross
[44:38] the thief uh that showed empathy the
[44:40] thief that said we deserve to be here
[44:42] and spoke to him he said remember me
[44:44] when thou comest into thy kingdom Jesus
[44:46] said as he's hanging on the cross verely
[44:48] I say unto thee today shalt thou be with
[44:51] me in paradise
[44:53] so he has spoken this already to the
[44:55] thief on the cross he says oh remember
[44:59] me and he says you'll be with me in
[45:01] paradise and if I could just dramatize a
[45:03] little bit That's Jesus saying he's got
[45:07] to go to paradise.
[45:08] And this thief that he's just pardoned
[45:10] is going to be there.
[45:12] But what is unsaid is the other thief is
[45:15] going to see him again.
[45:18] But it's not going to be in paradise.
[45:20] It's going to be in hell where he goes
[45:23] to preach to the eternally lost. And the
[45:25] thief is saying, "Hey, wait a minute.
[45:27] What are you doing here?" He says,
[45:28] "Don't worry. I'm leaving real quick.
[45:30] I just need these keys and you can visit
[45:32] these sins. I've got to go meet the
[45:34] thief.
[45:35] Amen.
[45:36] The one to my left, the one that I
[45:37] pardon. I got to go meet him.
[45:38] Amen.
[45:40] Because he had to be in paradise. He
[45:42] descended into hell, but he's raising
[45:43] back up. He must go to paradise. Brother
[45:45] Brandham, in the sermon, Israel and the
[45:46] church part two. Along came Jesus, the
[45:48] promised one. They done to him what they
[45:50] said they would, and they killed him. He
[45:53] died. His soul descended into hell.
[45:56] Preached to the souls that are in
[45:58] prison. Took the keys of death and hell
[46:00] away from the devil. returned back on
[46:03] Easter morning.
[46:07] This is when he appears to Mary. But
[46:09] notice and as he came through paradise,
[46:12] he knocked at the door.
[46:14] So, brother Bam just kind of swung back
[46:16] a little bit. He dies, soul goes to
[46:18] hell. Then he says, so we can say this
[46:20] is on Friday. He's in hell preaching and
[46:23] then on Sunday morning he returns back
[46:25] on Easter morning. But as he came back
[46:27] to Easter morning, he stopped by
[46:30] paradise first and knocked at the door.
[46:34] Why? He had to loose those that were in
[46:36] paradise. This is the change of
[46:38] dispensation. They were there in that
[46:40] place waiting for the promised son. They
[46:43] had believed on him who had come. These
[46:45] are they that believed in the seed. And
[46:48] when the seed came, it was their
[46:51] redemption.
[46:52] That's right.
[46:55] God bless you, Sister R. Is Brother
[46:56] Bruce here?
[47:00] I just noticed a family visiting today
[47:03] that as he as he comes up, he's knocking
[47:06] on this door to loose those who are
[47:08] under the promise.
[47:10] Because in this seed, all thy seed would
[47:12] be blessed.
[47:13] So, they're there waiting. Remember the
[47:15] patriarchs, they all wanted to be buried
[47:17] where the resurrection was.
[47:18] So, they knew wherever we go, we're
[47:21] waiting until that time when there's a
[47:23] resurrection. You don't bury me anywhere
[47:25] else but here. What about Joseph? Gave
[47:27] commandments concerning his bones.
[47:28] Joseph, what does it matter about your
[47:30] bones? Hey, we're different people. We
[47:32] got different promises. If you carry
[47:34] when you carry me into Egypt, don't
[47:36] leave my bones in Babylon. Don't leave
[47:38] my bones in Egypt. When you leave here,
[47:41] cuz there's a promise that you're
[47:42] leaving here, you take my bones and you
[47:45] put them in the place of the
[47:46] resurrection.
[47:48] And what happened after he knocked at
[47:49] the door? Brother Brandham dram
[47:51] dramatizes it so well that look, oh
[47:54] there's the will within the wheel. Oh
[47:56] look, there's the one. There's the one.
[47:59] That's the one we believed in. That's
[48:02] the one we've seen.
[48:04] Amen.
[48:04] Coming to make his own redemption
[48:05] claims, we could say.
[48:08] So as he stops at paradise and knocks on
[48:11] the door in Matthew 27:es
[48:13] 50 to 54, Jesus when he had cried again
[48:16] with a loud voice yielded up the ghost
[48:18] on the cross.
[48:21] And behold, the veil of the temple was
[48:22] written twain from top to the bottom and
[48:24] the earth did quake and the rocks rent.
[48:26] I know you guys remember exactly what I
[48:28] was preaching last year on this and and
[48:31] this is was it breaking the veil or
[48:33] something along those lines how here he
[48:35] is. Matthew takes us from the cross and
[48:38] then immediately from the cross into
[48:40] Jerusalem to the temple and the veil
[48:41] being rent and then there's even a fast
[48:43] forwarding. Brother Brandham takes these
[48:45] details and the way that he expresses
[48:47] it's very beautiful that even in the
[48:49] rapture when he cries with a loud voice
[48:51] there's an awakening
[48:53] to those that sleep but not necessarily
[48:56] the fullness of their bodies coming
[48:58] forth yet
[49:00] because he goes to paradise and is going
[49:03] to empty out paradise. Now it says, "And
[49:05] behold, the veil of the temple was
[49:06] written twain." Verse 52, "And the
[49:08] graves were opened, and many bodies of
[49:11] the saints which sle slept arose."
[49:14] And so now there's some there's some
[49:16] something is opened up
[49:19] and and the saints which slept arose.
[49:21] And now verse 53 tells us when this is
[49:25] coming into manifestation perfectly. We
[49:27] can say absolutely by this time and came
[49:29] out of the graves after his
[49:31] resurrection. Right?
[49:33] So graves are open, bodies which slate
[49:35] begin to be begin to arise. There's some
[49:37] awakeness, some quickening. There's
[49:38] events happening. Can we just say that?
[49:40] Let's not bind God according to time and
[49:43] distance and space and all these
[49:44] different things. But in this some way,
[49:46] this language is trying to tell us that
[49:47] something is happening from the cross to
[49:50] hell to paradise and bodies are
[49:54] awakening. Graves are opening. And then
[49:56] on resurrection morning, they came out
[49:59] of the graves after his resurrection and
[50:02] went into the holy city
[50:03] and appeared unto many.
[50:05] Cuz now that Christ is raising back up,
[50:08] he can take others with him.
[50:10] Amen. And then again in question and
[50:12] answers of Hebrews part two says then he
[50:14] ascended into hell and received the keys
[50:16] of death and hell from the devil come
[50:18] back up into paradise and brought
[50:21] Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and the
[50:23] righteous and raised he says Matthew 27
[50:26] and they came out of the graves and
[50:27] entered into the city and appeared to
[50:29] the people along the street.
[50:33] This is scripture. It's it's remarkable.
[50:35] I I I read it over and over again. I
[50:37] read it all the time. And to me, it's
[50:39] it's one of these remarkable instances
[50:41] where the Bible is saying it happened. I
[50:43] believe it happened.
[50:46] So
[50:48] now I feel like we're moving along
[50:50] pretty good here.
[50:53] I do apparently.
[50:57] Maybe it's just like we don't know what
[50:58] pretty good means, brother. And we're
[50:59] looking for perfect. If you're happy
[51:00] with pretty good, that's fine.
[51:03] So after descending into hell, he
[51:07] empties paradise.
[51:09] Then he appears to Mary.
[51:11] That's where we are in this story.
[51:14] This is Mark 16 chapter verse 9. This is
[51:17] John 20 11 to18. We'll come to those
[51:20] scriptures and read them maybe here in a
[51:21] moment. He comes to
[51:26] Well, maybe yeah, I think maybe we
[51:27] already read those. So good. We're doing
[51:29] really good on time.
[51:39] He's now appearing to Mary.
[51:42] Now let's come back to that quote from
[51:44] question and answers in 61 where he's
[51:45] having this dialogue about the body
[51:49] and he says he said in and I don't think
[51:51] I have it here. So he says he said don't
[51:54] touch me for I've yet ascended to the
[51:56] father but I send to my god and your god
[51:59] my father and your father. So now this
[52:01] is what he said. I have not yet ascended
[52:02] to the father. He says and then that
[52:04] night after he had gone up done went up
[52:07] before God and rose from the dead went
[52:11] up before God. Coming back he invited
[52:14] Thomas to touch his side. See he had
[52:17] ascended up in before God.
[52:20] Now he has descended and he's on his way
[52:23] back up to what? Fulfill all things to
[52:26] complete his work. He's not done working
[52:27] yet. He's got to finish working. And on
[52:29] his way back up, he empties out
[52:31] paradise. And after he's emptied out
[52:33] paradise at the time of his
[52:35] resurrection, because now once he begins
[52:36] to empty that out, he comes to his body
[52:38] and he's raised and he appears to Mary.
[52:41] And Mary's
[52:43] sees the Lord. He says, "I'm just
[52:45] showing you real quick. You go tell him,
[52:48] you've seen me. I want you to be an
[52:49] eyewitness of my re of my appearing. I
[52:51] want you to be an eyewitness that I'm
[52:52] here, that I'm alive, fulfilling that
[52:53] what I said I would do. But I still got
[52:55] a work to do."
[52:57] And he's assuring her. Don't worry,
[52:58] you'll see me again, but I got a work I
[53:00] need to finish. And brother Bram says
[53:03] that he had went up before God, rose
[53:05] from the dead, went up before God before
[53:07] that evening. He says he had ascended up
[53:09] before God.
[53:11] Back to our key quote in the
[53:12] resurrection. Brother B says, I think
[53:13] that one of the greatest scriptures
[53:14] that's neglected, the scripture he knows
[53:17] being preached on is the ascension of
[53:20] the Lord Jesus.
[53:23] What he did after his resurrection. Are
[53:25] we zeroed in on that? The ascension is
[53:28] neglected
[53:29] after his resurrection. So in the
[53:31] morning when he appeared to Mary, he is
[53:34] speaking about an ascension
[53:36] that is neglected.
[53:38] And he says now he did not sit down on
[53:40] the tomb after his resurrection because
[53:43] his work wasn't completed. It wasn't
[53:45] finished.
[53:46] So he's not just hanging out at the
[53:48] grave and as each one comes says
[53:51] surprise and everybody's like, "Oh my
[53:53] goodness, what are you doing?" right?
[53:56] He's crucified on April 1st or something
[53:58] and he's like, "I'm just kidding. I told
[54:00] you I could do it and you didn't believe
[54:02] me." No, he's not hanging out.
[54:05] He's a mighty conqueror.
[54:07] He's a preacher. He still has things to
[54:10] do. And brother Bam says he didn't just
[54:11] sit on the tomb. And then he says this
[54:15] to kind of get our attention. And the
[54:18] ones at the grave that morning were
[54:20] forbidden to even touch him. And he's
[54:21] referring to uh G to Mary.
[54:26] says, "But that night they were bidden
[54:29] to come fill his hands." Says he forbid
[54:32] his mother to touch him.
[54:34] And I I I would speculate that I think
[54:36] he's thinking of Mary Magdalene, but he
[54:38] says he forbid his mother to touch him
[54:39] and then quotes that same scripture to
[54:41] Mary. I have not ascended unto my
[54:42] father, my God, and yours. Now, look at
[54:45] what he says next. Focus in on this this
[54:48] maze font. And he had not yet, and I
[54:52] know it reads a little awkward, he had
[54:54] not yet, he would only ready to do his
[54:56] great high priest work at that time. So
[55:00] if you're listening to it and you write
[55:01] it down, this this is kind of how it
[55:03] sounds. He had not yet. In other words,
[55:06] he hadn't done something yet.
[55:09] He was ready. He was only ready. What he
[55:11] was immediately ready to do was his
[55:14] great high priest work at that time.
[55:17] So when brother Brandham takes us to
[55:19] that very moment where Christ appears to
[55:21] Mary and he says don't detain me. Don't
[55:24] hold me back. I have to ascend to my
[55:27] father. Brother Brennham wants us to
[55:29] think of the high priest who must
[55:32] perform his priestly duty at that
[55:35] moment.
[55:36] So he has descended to hell with sins.
[55:39] He has emptied up paradise. He is
[55:41] leading these these saints with him and
[55:43] they're appearing in Jerusalem. And in
[55:45] this quick moment as we zero in on his
[55:47] meeting with Mary, he says, "Don't
[55:49] detain me." He He leaves this in here
[55:51] for us to consider this glorious event,
[55:54] don't stop me. I'm still ascending.
[55:57] As the high priest, I must go up into
[56:00] heaven and sin before your God, my God.
[56:04] So, Brother Brandham connects Christ's
[56:06] work
[56:08] on that resurrection morning to the high
[56:10] priest on the day of atonement. Right?
[56:14] It's exactly what he's he's wanting us.
[56:16] You say, "Exactly. How do you know?"
[56:17] Well, he's he's drawn our minds to the
[56:20] high priest's work at that time, which
[56:23] is embodied in the day of atonement.
[56:26] And the high priest in Leviticus 16
[56:29] foreshadows the ministry of the Messiah.
[56:32] And you have one high priest and you
[56:34] have different sacrifices. You have all
[56:35] these moving parts. And all of this is
[56:38] fulfilled in the ministry of Jesus
[56:39] Christ. In Leviticus 16:30, it says,
[56:42] "For on that day," this is the day of
[56:44] atonement. I'm I'm not going to have
[56:45] time maybe to go into some of these
[56:47] details as much as I would like to. So,
[56:50] if we could just kind of shake ourselves
[56:51] a little bit and and we're just going to
[56:54] This is the momentum is starting to
[56:55] build and starting to build. I hope you
[56:57] can sense it. For on that day shall the
[56:59] priest make an atonement for you to
[57:02] cleanse you that you may be clean from
[57:04] all your sins before the Lord.
[57:06] This is the shadow. Christ is the
[57:08] substance. This is the foreshadowing.
[57:11] Christ is the fulfilling, the atonement
[57:13] to cleanse us, to cleanse us from our
[57:15] sins from before the Lord.
[57:17] Amen.
[57:18] And if you could just hold this in your
[57:19] hearts and and remember this as it's
[57:22] been said to keep it in your conscience
[57:24] now as we go forward, but maybe even
[57:26] then for the future. On the day of
[57:28] atonement, the high priest the the
[57:31] sacrifices and the events cleansed the
[57:33] tabernacle.
[57:34] So it was a cleansing of a place, but
[57:37] then it also cleansed the people.
[57:39] And so it was more than just oh he just
[57:41] went in and shed blood and this is all
[57:43] symbolic. All these different things
[57:46] sacrifice had to be made for himself.
[57:48] Then there had to be a sacrifice being
[57:49] made to purge and cleanse the different
[57:51] parts of the temple and the tabernacle.
[57:53] All these things are happening in the
[57:56] scapegoat and everything is
[57:57] foreshadowing our redemption
[58:00] forhadowing the ministry of Jesus
[58:02] Christ. And as as he's purging the
[58:05] tabernacle
[58:07] and he's and he's making these
[58:08] sacrifices, we know that the tabernacle
[58:10] represented heaven on earth,
[58:12] right?
[58:12] And even the tabernacle itself was aside
[58:15] was showed heaven and earth. And even
[58:18] the veil in the color blue was to
[58:20] signify how there was a veil between the
[58:22] heaven and the earth. And all these
[58:23] things were signified and wrapped up in
[58:25] that. And so the high priest on the day
[58:28] of atonement entered into this is the
[58:30] time only time he does it. He enters
[58:32] into the holy of holies
[58:33] remember through the veil
[58:35] as if passing into heaven itself
[58:39] to present the sacrifice and the blood.
[58:42] You following me now
[58:43] brother Brandon when we stop and we're
[58:45] seeing we're witnessing his conversation
[58:46] with Mary and he says Mary don't hold me
[58:49] I've yet to ascend to the father.
[58:51] Brother Brandham is saying, "Pause.
[58:54] Right here,
[58:55] right,
[58:55] he still has to perform the work of the
[58:57] high priest."
[58:59] Right here at this moment, he still has
[59:01] to do something more. He's already
[59:03] conquered hell.
[59:04] Already emptied out paradise, but
[59:06] there's still more.
[59:07] Amen.
[59:08] And so, the high priest entered into the
[59:10] Holy of Holies, which represents
[59:11] heavens, represents the mercy seat, the
[59:12] throne room. And so, it's as if he's
[59:14] entering heaven to present the sacrifice
[59:16] and the blood. What is he foreshadowing?
[59:18] Christ.
[59:19] What is it typing? Christ. Even think
[59:21] about how you they the dying goat
[59:23] signifies Christ dying.
[59:26] But remember Christ is sinless. So he
[59:28] doesn't need a sacrifice for himself.
[59:30] But then remember the scapegoat.
[59:32] That goat's going to be let loose into
[59:33] the wilderness.
[59:35] What? It's a place of death.
[59:37] What does it what does it signify?
[59:39] Christ is going to send down into the
[59:40] wilderness, the wasteland, the pit of
[59:42] despair. He's going to descend down
[59:44] there as a soul to go down there. He's
[59:46] represented in all these different types
[59:48] and shadows.
[59:50] That scapegoat descends into hell
[59:52] because of sin.
[59:54] What is it they do to the scapegoat? Put
[59:57] their hands on it signifying all sins.
[1:00:00] And it goes off into the wasteland, the
[1:00:02] desert, the wilderness. What is it
[1:00:04] right? What is it type? Christ being the
[1:00:06] sin bear
[1:00:08] going to hell.
[1:00:10] So when he meets Mary Magdalene, I know
[1:00:12] I'm not doing it justice.
[1:00:15] And so I apologize. I'm not apologizing
[1:00:17] for how long I'm preaching. Just
[1:00:18] apologizing for not doing this justice.
[1:00:20] So now when he meets Mary Magdalene,
[1:00:23] he's on his way to heaven to finish
[1:00:26] redemption.
[1:00:28] That's why don't stop me.
[1:00:30] Now's not the time.
[1:00:31] I think of Boaz and how Naomi told Ruth,
[1:00:34] "Oh, he will not rest. Don't worry. He
[1:00:38] won't rest until redemption's finished.
[1:00:40] He's not going to pause. He's not going
[1:00:42] to linger. He's not going to delay.
[1:00:43] Don't worry. He's not going to rest
[1:00:45] until redemption is finished. And he had
[1:00:48] to go before the the elders of the gate
[1:00:49] of the city and and and and finalize
[1:00:52] redemption claims. Boaz is acting out
[1:00:54] this part in time of what Christ is
[1:00:56] doing now when he tells he tells Mary,
[1:00:59] "Mary, don't worry. Hold on. I've got to
[1:01:02] finish this." Amen.
[1:01:04] Amen.
[1:01:04] And so when he meets Mary, he's on his
[1:01:06] way to heaven to finish redemption.
[1:01:07] Don't restrain me. I need to finish the
[1:01:09] work. Don't hold me back. I've got to go
[1:01:12] perform the work of the high priest.
[1:01:14] I've got to finish this, but I'll appear
[1:01:16] to you again.
[1:01:18] Notice what it says in Hebrews 9. I hope
[1:01:20] these scriptures just pop even more to
[1:01:22] you now. Hebrews 9:11-2. But Christ
[1:01:24] being come a high priest of good things
[1:01:27] to come by a greater and more perfect
[1:01:29] tabernacle not made with hands, that is
[1:01:32] to say, not of this building, neither by
[1:01:34] the blood of goats and calavs. Notice
[1:01:36] what he says, but by his own blood he
[1:01:39] entered once into the holy place, having
[1:01:42] obtained eternal redemption for us. He
[1:01:45] had to come as that high priest with the
[1:01:47] sacrifice and the blood. and and and we
[1:01:50] don't have to take it too literal, but
[1:01:52] it is his flesh.
[1:01:54] He is the sacrifice.
[1:01:57] And verse 24 says, he has entered into
[1:01:59] heaven itself.
[1:02:02] So what is the Bible telling us? By his
[1:02:04] own blood, he entered into the holy
[1:02:06] place.
[1:02:07] Having obtained eternal redemption. This
[1:02:10] is the high priest who once a year
[1:02:12] foreshadowed this. Go into the holy of
[1:02:14] holies. did it every year signifying of
[1:02:18] that one time the perfect sacrifice, the
[1:02:21] perfect high priest would enter in
[1:02:24] behind the veil
[1:02:26] once and for all.
[1:02:29] So Christ descends into heaven on the
[1:02:31] day of resurrection,
[1:02:32] John 20:1 17, and it's a triumphant
[1:02:36] entry into glory.
[1:02:39] On Easter morning, now think of this.
[1:02:41] This is where we are in this journey. On
[1:02:42] Easter morning, he ascends into heaven
[1:02:44] having obtained eternal redemption for
[1:02:47] us all.
[1:02:47] Amen.
[1:02:48] So now, just as the high priest,
[1:02:50] everything that took place outside,
[1:02:53] beyond the camp, in the camp, in the
[1:02:56] outer court, the inner court, now he has
[1:02:59] to come and there's things that take
[1:03:01] place afterwards, but he has to come. He
[1:03:03] has to appear
[1:03:04] into the holy of holies. Christ has by
[1:03:07] his own blood entered into heaven itself
[1:03:11] to obtain eternal redemption for us. So
[1:03:14] as he comes, he's coming as the mighty
[1:03:15] conqueror. He's coming to show
[1:03:19] in Psalms 24 7-10, "Lift up your heads,
[1:03:21] oh ye gates." This is the prophecy of
[1:03:23] it. Lift you up, ye everlasting doors,
[1:03:26] and the king of glory shall come in.
[1:03:29] This is this entrance of this this
[1:03:31] Messiah. Not into Jerusalem, not into a
[1:03:35] tabernacle made with hands, not into
[1:03:37] hell, not into paradise, but now into
[1:03:40] heaven.
[1:03:42] Who is this king of glory? The Lord
[1:03:44] strong and mighty. The Lord mighty in
[1:03:48] battle. Where is this battle taking
[1:03:50] place? I thought he died on the cross.
[1:03:52] No, that was a veil. Cuz behind the
[1:03:55] veil, he was still conquering. He went
[1:03:57] to hell, took the keys of death and
[1:03:59] hell. He went to paradise and loosed the
[1:04:01] believers. And now he ascends into
[1:04:03] heaven,
[1:04:05] triumphant.
[1:04:06] Yes, sir.
[1:04:08] Let the Lord strong, mighty in battle.
[1:04:10] Come in. Lift up your heads. It repeats
[1:04:13] the refrain. Why? Cuz once wasn't enough
[1:04:14] and two's not enough. Lift up your
[1:04:16] heads, oh you gates. Even lift them up,
[1:04:18] you everlasting doors, and the king of
[1:04:20] glory shall come in. There was a knock
[1:04:23] on hell's door and he came in. There was
[1:04:25] a knock on paradise's door and he came
[1:04:27] in. Now there's a knock on heaven's door
[1:04:29] and heaven will say, "Who is it? It's
[1:04:32] the king of glory."
[1:04:33] Oh, hallelujah. This is the moment we've
[1:04:36] been waiting for.
[1:04:40] Remember, brother Ram said he had to
[1:04:41] clean the whole thing out.
[1:04:44] He says, "The Lord of hosts, he is the
[1:04:46] king of glory."
[1:04:48] Now, as he ascends into heaven, he's not
[1:04:50] alone. Remember this. He's not alone.
[1:04:54] Psalm 68:18, "Thou hast descended on
[1:04:56] high.
[1:04:58] There's his ascending Christ ascending
[1:05:01] into heaven. Thou hast led captivity
[1:05:03] captive." What is this? This is the
[1:05:05] mighty conqueror.
[1:05:07] Having triumphed over sin,
[1:05:10] death,
[1:05:12] the grave, over hell. Now he's leading
[1:05:15] prisoners
[1:05:17] that are loosed from death into heaven.
[1:05:19] Amen.
[1:05:21] Thou hast ascended on high and led
[1:05:23] captivity captive. Led those who are
[1:05:25] bound. Led those who are waiting. Led
[1:05:27] those who are restricted by prophecy.
[1:05:29] Now he comes. He's not alone. He's
[1:05:31] bringing the saints with him.
[1:05:34] And listen to what Paul says in Hebrews
[1:05:35] 10 19:20. Having therefore, brethren,
[1:05:37] boldness to enter into the holiest of
[1:05:38] holies by the blood of Jesus
[1:05:40] by a new and living way which he hath
[1:05:42] consecrated for us through the veil,
[1:05:44] that is to say, his flesh.
[1:05:47] Think of what he's doing when he he has
[1:05:49] to clean everything out as he says.
[1:05:52] Think about what's transpiring in these
[1:05:54] very verses as we consider these things
[1:05:58] and how beautiful the picture is
[1:06:02] as he's ascending.
[1:06:05] It says that he's entered into the holy
[1:06:07] of ho holy of holies by his blood. And
[1:06:10] now we have boldness
[1:06:12] because it says he has consecrated a new
[1:06:14] and living way. Thou wilt show me the
[1:06:16] path of life and in thy presence there's
[1:06:19] pleasures forever more. So now he's
[1:06:21] conquer consecrating a new and living
[1:06:24] way. So on Easter morning and I'm I'm on
[1:06:27] my last page of notes
[1:06:30] and now that we have more exit points I
[1:06:31] feel that I got to keep people boxed in.
[1:06:35] Uh lock the doors.
[1:06:38] There's on this Easter morning as he's
[1:06:42] ascending,
[1:06:43] he's forever consecrating away,
[1:06:46] right?
[1:06:47] Because when Christ begins to make his
[1:06:49] appearances, he doesn't have to get any
[1:06:51] sacrifices anymore.
[1:06:53] It's forever made. It's forever
[1:06:55] consecrated.
[1:06:56] He's consecrated away. Now, I want to
[1:06:59] tie all this up. Brother Bam says in the
[1:07:00] rapture and the Old Testament saints
[1:07:03] came to the earth again, walked around
[1:07:05] on earth and entered in with him at the
[1:07:07] rapture.
[1:07:08] Excuse me, at his rapture.
[1:07:11] He said, "One resurrection's already
[1:07:13] passed."
[1:07:14] And he says, "The Old Testament saints
[1:07:16] walk in with him at his rapture."
[1:07:19] Brother Brandham's the one that brings
[1:07:20] these psalms into view. David said up
[1:07:22] there, "Lift ye up everlasting gates and
[1:07:24] be lifted up." He led captive captive,
[1:07:26] give gifts unto men. and the Old
[1:07:28] Testament saints went in with them.
[1:07:31] So when he told Mary, "Hold on a minute.
[1:07:33] I'm not done." He had preached to the
[1:07:36] souls in prison. He had emptied out
[1:07:38] paradise. And as the high priest, he was
[1:07:40] ushering in the believers of all the
[1:07:43] Jewish ages into their blessed rest in
[1:07:46] that other dimension.
[1:07:48] He had the Old Testament saints with
[1:07:49] him. They said, "Who is this king of
[1:07:51] righteousness? The Lord of glory, mighty
[1:07:53] host." Here they come in marching. Jesus
[1:07:56] led captivity captive. Psalms 24, Psalm
[1:07:59] 68. And he says, "And here he comes with
[1:08:02] the Old Testament saints."
[1:08:05] Now, could I get you just to maybe I
[1:08:07] could just leave leave you wanting a
[1:08:09] little bit. Now, this is part of his
[1:08:12] third pull ministry.
[1:08:13] Yes.
[1:08:14] This is part of the pattern that he's
[1:08:16] laying down in his own ministry. Part of
[1:08:18] his third pool ministry was leading the
[1:08:21] Old Testament bride from their place of
[1:08:23] waiting into their place of destiny.
[1:08:26] Part of his part of his role as the high
[1:08:28] priest was to go preach to souls in
[1:08:30] prison. But then he had to empty out
[1:08:32] paradise and lead the Old Testament
[1:08:34] saints into glory.
[1:08:36] That's why Joseph said, "Take my bones."
[1:08:39] And Moses takes his bones out of Egypt.
[1:08:41] And Joshua carries those bones into the
[1:08:43] promised land. What was it signifying?
[1:08:45] It was signifying Christ who would lead
[1:08:47] those Old Testament saints who had a
[1:08:49] physical resurrection in that time who
[1:08:51] was going to then lead them. He didn't
[1:08:53] leave them on this earth as ghost. He
[1:08:55] didn't leave them as spooked. He led
[1:08:56] them as a mighty conqueror into the
[1:08:59] presence of God.
[1:09:04] And in souls in prison now, we recognize
[1:09:07] this part of the third pole ministry.
[1:09:08] But I want you to think of the more to
[1:09:09] this.
[1:09:11] Brother Brandham was wanting to sing a
[1:09:13] hymn. He said, "The Bible said they sang
[1:09:14] a hymn and went out." This is really
[1:09:15] towards the very end there. He says,
[1:09:16] "Remember they did that in scripture.
[1:09:18] They did that in the scripture.
[1:09:23] It was because they had crucified the
[1:09:24] ministry of our Lord's second pool and
[1:09:27] the third pull was ready to enter.
[1:09:30] Now, we know what the third pool is and
[1:09:32] what it does. We know what he's
[1:09:34] wrestling with in this moment. And we
[1:09:36] know very distinctly where brother
[1:09:38] places a part of this third pool
[1:09:39] ministry in this sermon. A few hours
[1:09:42] after he ascended into hell and preached
[1:09:45] to the lost that had rejected mercy.
[1:09:48] So the Christ descending into hell is
[1:09:52] part of the third pull,
[1:09:54] part of his third pull, part of the
[1:09:55] pattern that is laid,
[1:09:57] but he's still conquering.
[1:09:59] He's still preaching.
[1:10:00] Brother Brandham clarifies later about
[1:10:02] his third pool ministry. It wasn't just
[1:10:05] to the eternally lost.
[1:10:07] There's more. Christ gathered the saints
[1:10:10] to a resurrection. He's gathering them
[1:10:12] and then he leads them into heaven. What
[1:10:14] is he showing? A type for us. That's
[1:10:16] right.
[1:10:17] Now, if I can say this is I want you to
[1:10:19] turn to John chapter 20. We'll come to
[1:10:21] it here in a moment. Think about what he
[1:10:22] is doing. And this as the third pool
[1:10:26] enters in, he preaches to the eternally
[1:10:28] lost. But that's not all his ministry
[1:10:30] is. He must lead those saints into
[1:10:33] glory.
[1:10:34] So, I want you to think deeply today in
[1:10:37] this resurrection.
[1:10:39] Where are we today?
[1:10:41] Where where are we in the moments of his
[1:10:44] himself making himself known to us?
[1:10:47] Where are we in the revealing of the son
[1:10:49] of man? Where are we in the process of
[1:10:52] the rapture? What scriptures have been
[1:10:54] fulfilled? What scriptures are being
[1:10:56] fulfilled? What is it right now that we
[1:10:58] could say Christ is saying, "I'm not
[1:11:00] finished yet.
[1:11:02] I I still have a job to do." Amen.
[1:11:07] And so after he meets with Mary, he
[1:11:10] finishes this ministry of leading the
[1:11:12] Old Testament saints into glory. And
[1:11:14] it's then that Christ ascends into
[1:11:16] heaven. Christ descending into hell.
[1:11:20] Christ descending into heaven.
[1:11:24] And here Mary is left between hell and
[1:11:27] heaven.
[1:11:29] And Christ now and she's forbidden to
[1:11:32] touch him as it were. that it says in
[1:11:35] John chapter 20 19 to 23. Then the same
[1:11:38] day at evening being the first day of
[1:11:40] the week.
[1:11:43] So now we know it's the same day when
[1:11:45] the doors were shut where the disciples
[1:11:47] were assembled for fear of the Jews came
[1:11:49] Jesus.
[1:11:50] So now when he comes, he's not coming in
[1:11:53] the same physical way you'd expect
[1:11:55] somebody to come.
[1:11:56] He's not bound by physics and uh uh
[1:12:00] science.
[1:12:02] It it's saying it in such a way to say
[1:12:03] that that the doors were were shut and
[1:12:05] locked and being watched like the ours
[1:12:07] are now and no one came in or out and
[1:12:11] and somehow he appears in the midst of
[1:12:13] them. He had been put out of them.
[1:12:16] He had been crucified. They had
[1:12:18] crucified the word. They' crucified
[1:12:20] Christ. They'd put him out of the
[1:12:21] church. They'd put him out of their
[1:12:22] midst. And here they are. They're
[1:12:24] assembled together uh with the promise.
[1:12:25] He said he'd never leave us nor forsake
[1:12:27] us. And now without any other physical
[1:12:29] sign or anything, not their traditional
[1:12:31] channels. Boom. He appears right there
[1:12:32] in their midst and says, "Peace be unto
[1:12:34] you."
[1:12:36] And when he had so said, he showed them
[1:12:37] his hands and his side.
[1:12:40] And I marvel over this,
[1:12:43] but if I could just say for me, it just
[1:12:46] expresses how he was willing to do
[1:12:48] whatever it would take
[1:12:50] to give them confidence in him at his
[1:12:52] appearing.
[1:12:54] That if that's if this is this so that
[1:12:56] you you look at me and maybe I don't
[1:12:58] look, think of all the instances where
[1:12:59] nobody knew who he was. So now he has to
[1:13:01] do things so that they know it's him.
[1:13:03] And so he's able to then he's able to
[1:13:06] with in this moment. So when when he
[1:13:08] shows up, it's not like this beaten,
[1:13:10] rabbid, bloody man sitting in the midst
[1:13:12] of him and they all shriek and
[1:13:14] Could it be that he was an 18-year-old
[1:13:15] man? A and and in a way to show them who
[1:13:18] he is. He shows them visible signs,
[1:13:21] gives them signs, scriptural signs that
[1:13:23] they would know that this is him in
[1:13:25] their midst.
[1:13:27] And it says, "And he showed them in his
[1:13:28] hands. They were then were the disciples
[1:13:31] glad when they saw the Lord.
[1:13:40] Then in Luke chapter 24
[1:13:44] tells this reading this way. We know
[1:13:46] those on the road to Emmas.
[1:13:50] Christ has already ascended to heaven
[1:13:52] because remember when he's with Mary
[1:13:56] don't don't detain me. I'm a high priest
[1:13:59] with a job to do. But now a little bit
[1:14:01] later on, he appears to his disciples on
[1:14:03] the road to Amaz. And guess what? They
[1:14:04] don't recognize him, right? Because he
[1:14:07] doesn't look like the way they would
[1:14:08] think he'd look. And so as he walks with
[1:14:11] them and he begins to open up the
[1:14:13] scriptures,
[1:14:15] they are going to turn in and what do
[1:14:17] they do? They detain him.
[1:14:21] Right?
[1:14:22] Now he can be stopped.
[1:14:25] Now he his work is finished. Now they
[1:14:28] constrain him and tell him to stay and
[1:14:30] he carries with them and then he's made
[1:14:32] known in the breaking of bread and
[1:14:33] whether they run to go tell the other
[1:14:34] disciples he has indeed risen. He he was
[1:14:37] made known to us in the breaking of
[1:14:38] bread. We didn't even know who I just
[1:14:39] imagine they were talking so fast.
[1:14:41] We didn't even know who he was. Here
[1:14:42] we're walking and we're complaining and
[1:14:43] we're all down in the dumps and then he
[1:14:44] starts opening up the scriptures and he
[1:14:46] starts showing us the ministry of Christ
[1:14:48] to the prophets and he expounds all
[1:14:49] these things and our hearts are burning
[1:14:51] within us and we don't even know what's
[1:14:53] happening. We're like, "Hey man, can you
[1:14:54] stick around for a little while? eat
[1:14:56] with us, commentary with us, and we
[1:14:57] didn't even know who he was. But then he
[1:14:59] took the bread himself. He became the
[1:15:01] master of the house. He broke the bread
[1:15:03] and then our eyes were open to know who
[1:15:06] this 18-year-old looking man was
[1:15:08] who knew all things. They run and they
[1:15:11] tell the other disciples, "He is alive.
[1:15:12] He is indeed risen. The report of the
[1:15:14] women is true. He is alive." And then he
[1:15:16] appears in their midst.
[1:15:19] Verse 39, he says, notice he says,
[1:15:20] "Behold my hands and my feet
[1:15:23] that it is my I myself.
[1:15:25] and see
[1:15:27] for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as
[1:15:31] you see me have.
[1:15:33] And he says, "And when he had thus
[1:15:35] spoken, he showed them his hands and his
[1:15:37] feet." And the scriptures, he's inviting
[1:15:40] them. Look, see, you know, even when he
[1:15:45] presents himself to Thomas, it doesn't
[1:15:46] even say that Thomas necessarily touched
[1:15:48] him.
[1:15:50] But now his work is finished. Amen.
[1:15:53] When he was between hell and heaven, he
[1:15:56] had to stop. But now that he's ascended
[1:16:00] and he's back now appearing, confirming
[1:16:02] the promise, he says, "Look." And now
[1:16:05] notice what he does. I'm closing here.
[1:16:06] Closing. And when he had thus spoken, he
[1:16:09] showed them his hands and his feet. And
[1:16:12] the phrase here is is
[1:16:15] just a bundle. And while they yet
[1:16:17] believed not for joy and wondered, in
[1:16:20] other words, it was too good to be true.
[1:16:22] They couldn't believe their eyes,
[1:16:24] they're filled with so much joy, they
[1:16:27] have so much enthusiasm, maybe just to
[1:16:29] use a phrase we've used recently, there
[1:16:32] might have been so much dopamine being
[1:16:33] rushed and there were so many neurons
[1:16:35] firing, so thrilled, so excited that
[1:16:37] they didn't even have time for rational
[1:16:39] thought.
[1:16:40] They they didn't have time to try to
[1:16:42] figure this out. They were just
[1:16:44] I mean, can you imagine it? It's all we
[1:16:46] can do right now, right?
[1:16:48] I mean, imagine what they're going
[1:16:50] through in that moment. Like,
[1:16:53] what is this? This is him.
[1:16:55] This is like he said it would be. What
[1:16:57] does this mean? What are the
[1:16:58] implications of this? And then as he's
[1:17:00] made himself known as scriptural signs
[1:17:03] and manifest himself, I'm here with you.
[1:17:05] I'm going to appear with you. I'm here
[1:17:06] now with you. Notice what he does. He
[1:17:09] gave them he asked, do you have anything
[1:17:11] to eat?
[1:17:13] Why? He wants to suck with them.
[1:17:18] And they gave him a piece of broiled
[1:17:19] fish and of a honeycomb. And he took it
[1:17:23] and did eat before them.
[1:17:26] He had descended and descended.
[1:17:29] Now he was appearing to them for their
[1:17:31] capstone.
[1:17:33] Now he was appearing to them to make the
[1:17:34] promise plain, to make it clear, to tell
[1:17:36] them, I'm I'm I'm this this season. It's
[1:17:39] just this particular time in this age.
[1:17:40] Think of how unique that age was. when
[1:17:42] he was there in the days of his earthly
[1:17:44] ministry in the flesh and before his
[1:17:45] crucifixion, he's preaching the kingdom
[1:17:47] of God is at hand. There's things that
[1:17:49] are being preached, things are being
[1:17:50] established, and he's saying there's
[1:17:51] going to be a Holy Ghost given. There's
[1:17:53] going to be things happen. And then when
[1:17:54] he dies and pays the price, think about
[1:17:56] all the events that are unfolding in
[1:17:58] this unique time before the Holy Spirit
[1:18:00] falls on the day of Pentecost,
[1:18:02] all the feasts that are transpiring,
[1:18:03] everything that's taking place. And
[1:18:04] brother says he came back again on the
[1:18:06] day of Pentecost.
[1:18:09] He's appearing to them to give them
[1:18:11] confidence. And what is he doing here in
[1:18:12] these scriptures? We see in these
[1:18:13] multiple appearance to the disciples
[1:18:15] before his ascension into heaven. He's
[1:18:18] feasting with them
[1:18:19] as the resurrected son of man. He's
[1:18:22] making himself known to him.
[1:18:25] Oh, what shadows and types for us?
[1:18:29] Can you just can you just feed on that
[1:18:31] yourselves?
[1:18:32] What shadows and types for us?
[1:18:34] So when I look at my title between hell
[1:18:38] and heaven,
[1:18:40] the mystery of Christ's descending and
[1:18:42] ascending,
[1:18:44] I'm talking about today.
[1:18:46] Amen.
[1:18:47] What about the mystery of his
[1:18:49] descending?
[1:18:51] What about his coming?
[1:18:52] Right?
[1:18:53] What about this third pull?
[1:18:56] What about all the speculation and the
[1:18:57] wonderings and the questions?
[1:19:00] Because then brother Brandham is telling
[1:19:01] us and teaching us and it is the rising
[1:19:03] of the sun.
[1:19:05] He's plainly telling us that there has
[1:19:07] been a resurrection.
[1:19:09] But this resurrection is not to the body
[1:19:12] of Jesus Christ in the corporal body.
[1:19:15] It's it's not just him resurrecting from
[1:19:18] a grave. It's not him coming out of
[1:19:20] hell. It's not the emptying out of
[1:19:21] paradise for the Old Testament saints.
[1:19:23] He says for a resurrection out of dark
[1:19:25] denominationalism.
[1:19:27] Can you think now in spiritual type of
[1:19:29] the bride, the gentile bride is caught
[1:19:31] up in a dead church.
[1:19:33] Brother Ram says in thirst, she's dead.
[1:19:36] And and she has death written on him.
[1:19:38] There's no life in her. Here it is. We
[1:19:40] need something to resurrect us. And he
[1:19:42] says, "What a resurrection that was.
[1:19:45] What a resurrection this is to be
[1:19:47] quickened from the dead
[1:19:50] between hell and heaven."
[1:19:53] What is it? It's Christ descending
[1:19:56] and the soon ascending of his bride.
[1:19:59] That's where we're living right now.
[1:20:01] That's what we see in the moments that
[1:20:03] we're living in right now. Oh, could we
[1:20:05] be like Mary? Could we be like the
[1:20:07] disciples? Could we be like them who've
[1:20:09] received their Messiah to know he has
[1:20:12] descended? He has ascended. And where he
[1:20:15] is now is with us.
[1:20:17] Amen.
[1:20:18] And what's next is an ascension.
[1:20:23] Amen. How is this so? I just there's so
[1:20:27] much to it. Did Brother Brennan not show
[1:20:30] us in great detail that hell is on
[1:20:33] earth?
[1:20:35] Is it not saying that now hell which was
[1:20:37] in a dimension that he visited as a boy?
[1:20:40] A dimension that Christ had descended to
[1:20:42] himself and now it's hell on earth. Hell
[1:20:45] hath enlarged herself and now it's
[1:20:47] manifested in Satan's Eden. So now hell
[1:20:50] has crept up. Right.
[1:20:52] Hell has ascended.
[1:20:55] Hallelujah. But once hell had filled up,
[1:20:59] Christ descended back into it again.
[1:21:02] And he has descended to do what? To
[1:21:05] loose us.
[1:21:07] To loose us from this hell. To loose us
[1:21:10] from Leodysia.
[1:21:12] He's still conquering today. He's still
[1:21:14] the mighty conqueror.
[1:21:19] Amen.
[1:21:19] Hallelujah.
[1:21:23] I was finished with this statement
[1:21:26] from the Easter Seal. Brother Bram was
[1:21:28] talking about the glorified Christ on
[1:21:30] Mount Transfiguration.
[1:21:33] He's talking about all the things that
[1:21:34] they try to get in our minds and get our
[1:21:37] attention. Musicians, you can ready
[1:21:39] yourself.
[1:21:42] He's talking about Christ. See him. See
[1:21:44] him. And he says, "See God's word, which
[1:21:47] is Christ."
[1:21:48] Now, this is April 10th, 1965.
[1:21:52] And he says, "See Christ, see God's
[1:21:56] word, which is Christ magnified
[1:21:59] and fulfilled the promise of this day in
[1:22:02] this great hour of resurrection."
[1:22:05] Amen.
[1:22:06] Where the the bride is raptured up
[1:22:11] spiritually. And Christ is the mystery
[1:22:13] of God revealed. He's teaching this very
[1:22:15] principle of how the the body follows
[1:22:17] the head.
[1:22:18] Amen.
[1:22:19] And he says she's already risen.
[1:22:21] Amen.
[1:22:22] Where is she risen? She's risen to this
[1:22:24] place between hell and heaven.
[1:22:27] Why? Because he's descended.
[1:22:29] And now in the preview of the bride,
[1:22:31] she's ascending up.
[1:22:32] Amen.
[1:22:32] Why? What? Leodysia is descending down.
[1:22:36] And here we are. We're ascending in this
[1:22:38] great hour of resurrection.
[1:22:41] That's where we're living now. this
[1:22:43] great hour is resurrection. He says,
[1:22:45] notice, and it gives them joy to know
[1:22:49] that we are with him.
[1:22:51] A flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[1:22:53] bones. What a joy.
[1:22:56] And that's the only thing the believer
[1:22:58] cares about.
[1:23:00] Hallelujah. That's the only thing the
[1:23:02] believer cares about. Don't give me the
[1:23:05] past. Let the dead bury it past. I don't
[1:23:07] want to look for some future pleasure on
[1:23:09] this earth. Let me enjoy the present.
[1:23:11] Christ. Amen.
[1:23:13] This is my joy. Just as he told him in
[1:23:15] Luke 24, "See my bones. See my flesh."
[1:23:18] And they were filled with joy and
[1:23:20] wonderment. And now we are bone of his
[1:23:22] bones in flesh of his flesh. I I can't
[1:23:25] see his nail scars. I can't see his
[1:23:27] thorn prince, but I see the revealing of
[1:23:30] the son of man as he's united with his
[1:23:32] bride. Behold his flesh. Behold his
[1:23:35] bones in this hour of resurrection.
[1:23:40] What a joy.
[1:23:42] What a joy
[1:23:44] that we have here between hell and
[1:23:48] heaven.
[1:23:50] The mystery of Christ descending
[1:23:53] and descending. Oh, what beautiful
[1:23:55] mystery.
[1:23:58] And if I can say this just to get you to
[1:23:59] think about these things,
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:05] it could be presented to you as a
[1:24:07] choice.
[1:24:10] Where do you want to end up? Heaven or
[1:24:12] hell?
[1:24:14] And I know the song says he didn't want
[1:24:16] heaven without us.
[1:24:18] And it says he he brought heaven down.
[1:24:21] But then it's almost like we take the
[1:24:22] next step to say, but then we're all
[1:24:24] going to go back to heaven anyways. And
[1:24:26] somehow we've been able to take this
[1:24:28] thing and just split it to where we're
[1:24:31] stuck in the middle. And we have a
[1:24:33] choice. Whatever you choose here on
[1:24:35] earth, you're either going to end up in
[1:24:36] hell forever or heaven forever. And that
[1:24:38] wasn't God's program from the beginning.
[1:24:41] He created hell to do away with
[1:24:44] everything
[1:24:46] that could ever impede the eternal union
[1:24:50] of heaven and earth. Cuz this is where
[1:24:52] he wants to dwell. Because when it's all
[1:24:55] over, where are we coming? Right back to
[1:24:57] here. So I say, let it begin now.
[1:25:01] Let me put I don't want to put off my
[1:25:03] praise. I don't want to put off my
[1:25:05] deliverance. I don't want to put off my
[1:25:07] joy. I'm not going to look for some
[1:25:10] triumph triumphant entry on streets of
[1:25:12] gold. I'm not I'm not looking to a
[1:25:14] heaven that's way out there. I recognize
[1:25:17] the revelation that this message brought
[1:25:19] to us. It's the gospel Paul preached and
[1:25:21] it is that the kingdom is heaven and
[1:25:23] earth united. And here I am as the very
[1:25:26] expression of that in this hour. And I
[1:25:28] say, Lord, what a joy it is to know that
[1:25:31] he is with us. What a joy it is to know
[1:25:33] in this hour of resurrection to see him
[1:25:35] in his promised word. And I'm not so
[1:25:37] much fixated. I feel if anything, this
[1:25:40] has even been a correction to my
[1:25:41] emphasis. I'm not so much fixated on
[1:25:44] what it'll be over there, but I'm
[1:25:46] fixated on that becoming real here. And
[1:25:49] I'm fixated on heaven imposing its will
[1:25:51] on my earth. Let your will be done on
[1:25:54] earth. Let it be thy kingdom come. Thy
[1:25:56] will be done. Let it be done in earth
[1:26:00] cuz it's going to have to happen here.
[1:26:02] That's where the desperation resides.
[1:26:06] Oh God, may it be that we could receive
[1:26:08] you in this time, in this great hour
[1:26:11] that we're living in and not miss these
[1:26:14] precious promises.
[1:26:17] Oh, hallelujah. Stand with me.
