TRANSCRIPT
========================================
If you'd like to turn with me to uh Romans 12:2, go straight into the scriptures. I have a really strange title and it's not that I wanted to um you know, I wanted to have a weird title or anything. I just couldn't think it just whenever God gave me this inspiration, that's all that was popping up is this thought of you changed. All right. &gt;&gt; And I I don't know if um you've like had a family member, especially a young one you haven't seen in maybe even two months. Then you see them again and they've to grown taller than you. &gt;&gt; They have more uh facial hair than you. And you're like, "Whoa, you grew up. You've changed. You've" And um that's kind of the thought that I have is um this thought of maybe it's not drastic. Maybe it's every day, but there's this thought of, wow, whenever a perspective or somebody sees you and they say, whoa, you've changed. &gt;&gt; Something happened. And so that's kind of the the thought that I have today. If you'd like to um go in Romans 12:2, it says, "And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is of what is that um what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God." &gt;&gt; Let us uh pray one more time. Heavenly Father, Lord, we've read your scripture. We just want to put everything in your hands, Lord. Father, you know every heart. You know every desire. You know every need. And we just ask that your word may go forth and fulfill the needs, Lord, according to your will. We give you the honor and the glory. We give you the preeminence. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. You may be seated. So, um Paul is is clearly telling the Romans um a very clear thing. He's saying, "Be not conformed, be transformed." And um if anybody ever want to look at those words, they're two different words. They're not two, you know, the same. He's saying, "Don't be fashioned like the world. Don't be molded by the the things of the world." And then he's he's saying another word to be transformed. It's almost like metamorphosis. It's to meta means uh uh to be uh I believe it means to be changed and morphe is another form. So to be changed into another form inwardly. Don't be conformed outwardly by the things of the world but to be changed inwardly because that's the greatest change. Right? Um to bring a historical context to this verse, it's not like I'm going to go completely deep into this this verse, but I just want to shed some light. Um he wrote this book of Romans around 55 to 58 AD. People kind of pinpoint it to 57 AD. And during that time he wrote this letter. Rome was arguably the the epicenter of the world for political views for the culture for um economic military. It was Rome. Rome was the spot. If you would like to think about it as the New York City or LA or even Phoenix, these great epicenters, these great places um for a lot of things, a lot of culture, a lot of things flowing in and out. Um Rome was that place, right? And so Rome was it was a mashup of cultures, mashup of different religions and and uh you had Roman gods like Jupiter and mystery cults in the east of the east and you had a Jewish community and and um you had people worshiping even Nero himself. It was Nero the emperor and you had them worshiping other emperors that passed on. They had um worshiping just other gods. And so this is kind of the scene that we see ourselves in in um with Paul and um and you see these people you you see um different ideas clash. You see philosophers and you see poets and you see all these people um you know vying for attention &gt;&gt; and a lot of the culture it kind of leaned into access. So you you had these gladiator fights and you you had excess partying and you had all these moral standards decaying and it it was just a horrible place. &gt;&gt; I'm sure we don't know any place like that today, right? &gt;&gt; Well, it's a good picture of today. &gt;&gt; And it's not there's not one epicenter of a place like that where it's a mashup of culture, a mashup of ideas and and philosophies, but it's every city that we go to now. It's it's every little town now. I I always used to think, man, you go to a little town, you kind of hide away from that. No, not with social media. Social media will get a thought, a culture, a trend right away to your doorstep as soon as you open up your phone. &gt;&gt; As soon as you open up social media, so you don't have to be in an epicenter anymore. It's everywhere. We we think about &gt;&gt; every place. you can go to the littlest village and somebody has a phone. &gt;&gt; So, um, we see that today and that's what was going on over there. And so, you have all these different types of groups and and within all these groups, you had a little tiny group that knew the truth and they were called Christians. A little handful of a bunch of people. Now, think about it. You have this great place and you have a bunch little handful of people that knew the truth. It was 57 AD. So it wasn't long be after what happened to Jesus Christ after the the resurrection and and what happened in the upper room. and and and now you have these people that that had personal experiences with Jesus Christ living in this whole mashup, this conglomerate of sin, &gt;&gt; knowing the truth, knowing the word of God. And Paul, he's telling these people, he's saying, "Don't be conformed. You know the truth. Do not be conformed to this world." He and these people, you know, Ro R Romans Rome's culture just like this one was a loud and proud culture. You were expected to join in join in to things like like the emperor worship like the all these festivals of uh big civic festivals of of honoring these pagan gods. All all this stuff was going on in this place. &gt;&gt; And it was one of those things of you have to be tolerant to this. You you have to accept these things. You have to accept the culture of the day. And now you have Christians in this place saying, "No thanks." And that could lead, if you think about it, that could lead you to being the weirdo, right? &gt;&gt; That could lead you to be the oldfashioned. That could lead you, it all left them almost as traitors. Now you have to think about it in this the context of the history it was 57 AD. In 64 AD the persecution of the Christians started where they begin to kill and murder these people. So there was already a tense vibe, a a tense uh thing going on with the Christians and these people were were pressuring by their culture, by their beliefs, by whatever they were, by their identities. Uh they pressured, they tug the believers, tempting them to blend in just to get by. Now, my inspiration for this message, it comes from, I'm sure, um, what we've all experienced in these few days, these few months, these few years of this distinct line drawn in the sand in this world. &gt;&gt; A a a distinct line of culture differences, of race differences, of political differences, of religious differences. There is a line being drawn from the whole world &gt;&gt; and and and if you as a person believes in Jesus Christ, you have already been categorized by the world. &gt;&gt; You have been categorized and there's this this pull on each side. I'm not saying one side is good. Both sides are controlled by the devil. whatever you want to say. If there's these racial issues, cultural issues, political issues, religious issues, &gt;&gt; American Christians is not what it's supposed to be. &gt;&gt; So, so, but these they've drawn a line to where it's like, oh, well, if you're this, then you this, you believe this, and you believe that. And each spot and each side is is causing people to say, "Hey, choose a side. &gt;&gt; Hey, conform. Hey, you got to tolerate. Hey, you've got to become." &gt;&gt; And there's this group of Christians, group of believers that know the truth. &gt;&gt; That that know that there is no there is no going on one side or the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there is a a a purpose that God has given each and every one of us. &gt;&gt; There is a duty that God has given a Christian knows just like Jesus when they said, "Well, what are you here to do?" You know, for the rel for the Jews and and for at that time, they weren't thinking about church. They weren't thinking about building churches and having pastors and and doing this and that. No. To the Jews, it was strictly uh uh government. &gt;&gt; They needed a king. They needed somebody to to pick sides with them so that they can overthrow the government. Hey, we've been in bondage too long. We need a king to step in so that we become the Jews and and we can establish our our kingdom again. So when Jesus came, they said, "Oh, so Pilate asked him, so you're the king of the Jews, huh?" "Oh, well, you're this and that." And he says, "You know what? My kingdom is not of this place." &gt;&gt; They wanted to establish something here. They wanted to say, "Oh, I'm this." But Jesus says, "My kingdom is not from this place." &gt;&gt; There there is no conforming. There is no changing this place. &gt;&gt; There's no changing the world. The greatest one of the greatest scriptures that everybody knows is for God so loved the world. People think, "Oh, God so loved the earth." No, he loved the world, the the the system, the order, the people that were in that order to change them, to change somebody inwardly and not change the things that are going on. So that's where my inspiration came. It actually came from was just all these things. And I I I'm not here to speak anything political or anything like that, but I'm just telling you how my inspiration came. And um it actually came from when the news happened to where all that happened with that person, you know, um getting shot and and hearing the story of the young man. And I don't care what anybody says. Oh, well, he was this and he was that and this was going on. The the one thing that inspired me I I believe that God showed me was this change from this young man not it doesn't mean what their the parents' political views were it was that they were Christians &gt;&gt; that they they believed in Christ I don't know if they were good Christians or they whatever they were but they had a certain value of the scripture &gt;&gt; and throughout his childhood he was living that life and somehow he goes out, goes to college and and adopts different views, adopts a different thought. So much so that he conforms, he's shaped, he's formed into the thoughts that has been fed to him to where he acts in this way. And people can say, "Whoa, he changed." Maybe his friends could say, "Whoa, that person changed. He wasn't like that when he was when he was here or when he was there, when we were in Bible school or whatever they were doing." I believe they were Mormon. So, whatever whatever place they were at, maybe they were like, "This is not the person that we we knew." but because a a pressure, an idea, a thought began to just knock at his door &gt;&gt; and he began to see things a little differently and and things began to happen. Now, I'm not I don't know what's going on you. There's so many conspiracies. I'm just thinking about the story. We can almost associate that story with anybody. We've got maybe family members, friends that that same things happen where where a thought begins to happen, a belief begins to happen, and their whole trajectory, their whole life begins to change because they they listen to something else. &gt;&gt; And and um now I I truly believe that there's a way that we can change as people &gt;&gt; and not not lose our belief. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I believe that's called growth, &gt;&gt; right? So, we all change, &gt;&gt; we all grow. We all we all change into somebody else. I I heard once a man saying that um a man he was talking about his marriage and that he was saying that his wife was married to five different men and all of them were him. Why? because he changed that your 20-year-old self is not your 30-year-old self. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you want to look at that person be like, "Man, that guy was a dummy. That guy didn't know what he was doing. What is it?" He changed. &gt;&gt; So, so there is a changing there's there's a growing in a person where where you're not the same person that you were. &gt;&gt; We're meant to change. I believe that's that's the greatest thing that God has given us. That's what encapsulates free will and accepting and declining and and accepting certain things. And that's that's a process of change that God gave to the human race. Right? &gt;&gt; That is an authority that God gave to the human race where we can accept things, we can um not accept things and we can change and be formed to the very things that we believe in and we hold dear to. &gt;&gt; So that's called growth. But I I I truly believe what's going on in this world is people looking into this these changes. young people looking into changes and and seeing their emotions and identifying themselves by the feelings that they have and their change. &gt;&gt; So they begin to solidify their identity by the feelings and all these things that are happening and then you begin to find a bunch of crazy ideas. &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because of the the attaching their identity to the little changes that we're going through. Wow. &gt;&gt; That's why you can see people becoming whatever they want to be. They can be she her and then turn into they them and non-binary and all these these ideas that are are fluid. They're not solid beliefs. These are things that can change from one day to the other. But if you don't categorize them the way they want you to, then you have committed unpardonable sin. Right? &gt;&gt; Even though they can change tomorrow. What is what is it changing with the cultures &gt;&gt; becoming fluid and and people don't know what they are. You can't you can't compare the '9s to today. &gt;&gt; Why? Culture, trends, technology, all these things just flow and they change and they move and all these things and you can't attach yourself, your identity to those kinds of things &gt;&gt; and say, "Oh, I am this." That's why the best thing to attach your identity is something solid, &gt;&gt; a solid belief. That's why I believe there's an identity crisis that is going on with the world, the the youth of the world. &gt;&gt; Why? There there's they don't know who they are, but they can find themselves in the word of God. &gt;&gt; They can find themselves in Christ. &gt;&gt; And you know what? It's not going to change &gt;&gt; tomorrow. It will not change. &gt;&gt; You can stand on the word. You can stand on who you are and things will not change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But um unfortunately that's the way the world is. The way they think that they can create their own identity, but they don't realize that that they're influenced by something that is going to change &gt;&gt; that is not solid. Um, I I truly believe that it's your belief that changes your identity. It's people that attaching a belief to certain things changes your moral compass, changes the way you dress, the way you act, the way you do things. is because you begin to believe in something and and maybe you somebody can hold on to Christ or hold on to a religion or hold on to whatever but then they begin to believe in something else automatically you cannot hold on to the other thing. &gt;&gt; You begin to be formed by what you believe in and and the things that we feed on that's what begins to change change us. &gt;&gt; So Paul he's he's basically telling us to stop conforming. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says, "Do not be conformed." But it it this is a ongoing resist. &gt;&gt; Stop conforming. He's telling us to not just to isolate ourselves from the world. We can't do that. We can't be um Amish people, right? We can't just because what I realized and I I I heard this from a theologian, but it it was scriptural. He says that there's three things that a person has to be careful with and that is that is your flesh. that is the world and that's the devil. A lot of people what the Amish did was let's isolate ourselves from the world. &gt;&gt; Well, that's a good thing, but they still got their flesh and the devil to work with. &gt;&gt; Right? So, and people want to um you know fight with the flesh, but they got to remember about the world and the devil. &gt;&gt; Some people say, "Oh, it's the devil's fault." Yet, it's probably their own desires. &gt;&gt; That's right. So there there's things that you have to be careful with. &gt;&gt; There's things that you you you have to uh uh check up. There's a constant resisting from these things. And so it's not telling us to isolate from the world. It's not telling us but don't blend in. &gt;&gt; Don't try to chase these things. Don't try to become like everybody else. Because once we begin to adopt the thoughts of the world, we are just a number. There's nothing special about us. Maybe we think we're special and we think we're unique, but we become one of the fish going down the river just like everybody else. &gt;&gt; Going in the flow of the trend of the day, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, u it's telling us to resist those things. It's these fleeting fashions as as one commenter says is resist these fleeting fashions that are going to come and go. They might look harmless at the moment. They might they might think that you might think you're nothing's going to happen, but in the long run it can pull you away from your faith. &gt;&gt; And one day, somebody can walk to you and say, "You've changed." Maybe you can look in the mirror and say, "Whoa, what happened here? I changed what we begin to adopt little things here and there. We begin to conform." This conforming is a shaping and shaping and shaping every single day. Conforming until we look in the mirror and we don't know what we're looking at anymore. If you'd like to turn with me to Revelations 2:18. Forgot to put on my timer. So, um I'll just Revelations 2:18 and we'll read to uh from 18 to 20. says, "And unto the angel of the church of Thyia, write these things, sayith the Son of God, who hath eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet like unto fine brass." He says,"I know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and uh and the last to be more than the first." I like that. Usually works degrade. Then then he says here, hold on, let me make sure. So in in Revelations 2:20 it says, "Nevertheless, notwithstanding, I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetist, to teach and seduce my servants, to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols." Now, that's that's a big thing there. He begins to explain who this person is and and he begins to say what she's doing and and it's a horrible thing. And and the first thing I I love how Christ is. He he's doesn't come and he's not doesn't come to us and says, "Hey, your issue this let me tell you what your issue is." No, he's he's actually um knows he's a good leader. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what you've done good first. Let me tell you all your qualities and good traits. And he he begins to tell them of their life continue progress and and that that each day it's better than yesterday. And I think that's a Christian's goal. &gt;&gt; Lord, let me be better than yesterday. &gt;&gt; There there is one one uh church where he says that you've left your first love. That's an issue. &gt;&gt; What What happened? There was a a degrading. There was something going on to where they're worse than they were when they first gave their heart to the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see somebody give their heart to the Lord and their their zeal sometimes they don't know how to aim and they don't know how to say things right and and but their zeal is there. &gt;&gt; Their love for the Lord is there &gt;&gt; and sometimes they say things that that they're not supposed to. I remember when I gave my heart to the Lord, I I was telling people, "Oh, I think you're going to go to hell." I didn't know the word enough &gt;&gt; to say, "Hey, man." Like, there's more of the word than, "Hey, you sin, you go to hell." &gt;&gt; And there's more grace in words that you can say to bring something to Christ, somebody to Christ, and then instead of making them run away, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so, uh, there's that zeal, but these people, it said that that zeal got greater and greater and greater &gt;&gt; and the works that you did yesterday, they're better today. &gt;&gt; That's a beautiful thing. &gt;&gt; Then after all those beautiful things, your their works, their charity, their love, their kindness, their patience, oh man, he made them feel good. But he says, "Notwithstanding. Nevertheless, I have a few things against you." Not that you sinned. He didn't say, "Oh, I have this against you. You sinned that one time. You lied. You stole. You did something horrendous." But he said, "You suffer." Which that word in other translations means you tolerate. You tolerated a person. That's what I have against you. &gt;&gt; You tolerated. Now, now it's like I said, the the Bible, the word, Paul is not telling us to separate ourselves from from the world completely. It says that we have to be in the world, that we have to work, we have to conversate, we have to we we have friends. But here he says you tolerate it. Bible or the word tolerate is to allow to be done without hindrance or contradiction or to put up with. Now I'm not talking about the friend that's at work or or somebody at the grocery store. Sometimes it's within us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's within our own home. &gt;&gt; Is to to put up with to allow something to fester in when you should break it off right away. &gt;&gt; Break that sin. Break those little things. Even those little conversations, those little thoughts, all those things. You've tolerated those things. &gt;&gt; And people might say, "Oh, no. That's okay. That's all right. You got to be that's what the world wants you to be. You got to tolerate." &gt;&gt; Wow. You you have to comply. You have you have to be like that in order for you to move around the world until one day you wake up and you are it. You become it. &gt;&gt; He said you've tolerated that woman Jezebel. Now the the scripture is is beautiful because um you go back to Kings and you think about Ahab. Think about not only that he tolerated a woman but he married her. &gt;&gt; He adopted her her idols. He adopted her her religion. He adopted all those things that not only uh took his life down but the whole country, &gt;&gt; the whole nation &gt;&gt; was flooded with idols. Why? Because one person accepted not only accepted but was conformed by the very thoughts of that person. &gt;&gt; Honestly, you know, this is just my perspective, my my thought. I I don't think if you you can you can correlate Ahab to this these people because Ahab wasn't a good person. He completely adopted those things. He became it. But there was a good man named Jehoshaphat. And for me reading the scriptures that was was one of the greatest kings of Judah outside of David. He was one of the greatest because he he didn't sin like everybody else. He didn't fall away from the Lord. You know what his sin was? He tolerated. &gt;&gt; He he saw the division of these two two nations and and um he knew it was an issue and and himself thinking, man, I know God wants us to be all together. I know God wants us to be all one. I know God wants us to be like this. So what he tried to do was was become friends with Ahab &gt;&gt; when God didn't want him to. &gt;&gt; God didn't want him to tolerate their sin. God says, "I've already condemned him through the mouth of Elijah." &gt;&gt; They they already had the word spoken to them. &gt;&gt; That's what the world is. &gt;&gt; That's what United States is today. &gt;&gt; Yet we want to say, "Let's save our country. Oh no, &gt;&gt; let's do this. Let's do that. Let's do all these things. &gt;&gt; Uh the word has been spoken. &gt;&gt; The word has been spoken. And that's what makes us different than uh uh American Christian. &gt;&gt; That's what makes us different because we our kingdom is not over here. I'm not going to try to do a patchwork on this world. I'm going to work on this world. &gt;&gt; I'm going to work on this world. If somebody needs saving, I'm going to speak to the soul and not to the nation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus, he came to change the world. How did he do it? To become a king. He said the first doctrine, he said, "You must be born again." &gt;&gt; That was his teaching. &gt;&gt; That's what he wanted was a change of the heart and soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here, Jehoshaphat, he wanted to change the nations. He wanted to do these things. And and and so the Bible says, and I'm not bringing up the scripture. You guys can look it up yourselves, but there's this word. It says that he had an affinity with Ahab. And that was a word that they used as a contract. And the way they would make a contract was they would get he would he got his son, Ahab got his daughter, and they married one another. And that was their contract saying, "Hey, we are partners now. And maybe we think, "Oh, that well that's fine. That's okay." But but God told us not to do that. &gt;&gt; God told us it. He says, "Evil communications corrupt good manners." &gt;&gt; Be not unequally yolked. &gt;&gt; Do not do those things. Doesn't mean you can't go on through those things. It's not because to be mean or to do all those things because there is a detriment not only to you but to things after they did all those things and and you know Micah the prophet he's spoke the word and he says you're going to die here and this is what's going to happen and those things happen and you think oh Jehoshaphat man okay he's done um Ahab died. No, he finds his son. He said, "Oh, let's be friends." Same thing. Elisha goes and they call him. And Elisha told Jehoshaphat, "Man, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even look at that person. I wouldn't even be here. But because you as a believer, you've tolerated. &gt;&gt; Now I have to stand here. Now I have to protect you. Now I have to be here." Sometimes we get ourselves in issues because we want to kind of be around the world. Kind of not be but kind of be. &gt;&gt; That's what gets us into issues. &gt;&gt; That's what gets us into problems &gt;&gt; when we find ourselves in places we're not supposed to be in. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm always in my house. Always. &gt;&gt; I'm always there. &gt;&gt; We don't h We don't have to leave our house anymore. I don't have to go to Rome anymore to the epicenter. &gt;&gt; The world is is infiltrating us. &gt;&gt; The world is is trying its best to apply pressure &gt;&gt; toward say well you know what we can somehow tolerate. We can s somehow do those things but God says don't do it. Jehosaphat he didn't stop there. I think he did it like one or two, three more times and he ended up dying and and I remember Joo telling him like, "Man, you're a good guy, but you're getting into trouble being around these people and he ended up dying with that reputation as a good man yet being too close to sin." And people think, "Oh, well, the story ends there." No, his daughter um Athaliah, she ca caused mayhem with his children. Almost killed the whole lineage of Judah except for one. It was his daughter-in-law that married his son. his son died and she killed all of the descendants except for one, trying to destroy Judah because of one little handshake, because of one little decision of let me align myself with a world. It says, I have one thing against you that you tolerate. You know, um that's I I think this is what our pastor would call a prelude, right? Toleration. Wow. &gt;&gt; When when we begin to tolerate when we allow certain things, we begin to put little bit of seeds here and there, then we know what the main symphony is going to be. &gt;&gt; We know what's going to happen if we begin these little tiny things. &gt;&gt; When we think, "Oh, everything is okay." But then one day we look in the mirror and there's a conformity going on. There is a complete change. And then you can tell yourself, "Man, you've changed. Man, something happened." &gt;&gt; If you'd like to turn with me to Psalms 1:1, this is a beautiful scripture. It says, "Blessed is the man." So, I want to know how I can be blessed today. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of the sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the scornful." Now psalmist is explaining what a man that is blessed, what he is, and he's explaining by negation. So, so he's saying he's blessed because he does not do this, &gt;&gt; right? So, he's saying he's blessed because he doesn't do this and he doesn't do that. And and you know what? That's how many scholars try to figure out who God is actually. That's how the Bible explains who God is because we can't we can't wrap our minds around who God is, &gt;&gt; right? As a human being. &gt;&gt; So, what a a human being can do is they know their environment. They know the world. They know the the ex uh the uh the world and themselves and all of that. So they can say, well, God is not finite, right? So they're explaining that he's infinite by saying, well, he's not like us. &gt;&gt; Well, he's not sinful. He's not like us. So that's how people try to explain who God is by understanding that he's not like this. And this is how the psalmist is saying. He's saying, "Blessed is the man because he is not walking with the uh walketh with the counsel of the ungodly, standeth in the way of the sinners, now siteth in the seat of the scornful." Now, there's a lot of things going on in this little tiny scripture. The scripture, it's talking about the blessed man, and he's talking about how he doesn't walk, he doesn't stand, or he doesn't sit. Not only that, but not he doesn't walk with the counsel, stand with the in the way and sit in the seat. And then you can also break it down of the ungodly, the sinner, and the seat of the scornful. But you can really break that down and see all those things. But I really want to go into walkth standeth and sitting. It's almost a degradation of a person. There's there's a point of walking with a person, standing and then sitting &gt;&gt; and and walking it suggest a movement, a passing engagement &gt;&gt; implying somebody is beginning to listen or or to entertain advice or ideas. What is that? Toleration, right? &gt;&gt; The the um begin to entertain advice, ideas, perspective of the wicked, those who reject God's ways. This is the initial stage, if you want to call it, of toleration where a person may not fully embrace a sinful mindset, but is open to hear and kind of dabble into it. Well, let me hear your perspective. Well, let me see where you're you're at. And and we begin to tolerate those things. We begin to try to understand those things even though word even though the word clearly says it's wrong. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So there's this part of walking. So when God is is correcting thiteria, he's not telling them that they sin. He's saying, "Hey, you're getting into a path that you do not want to go into." &gt;&gt; You're walking, you're tolerating these things. And this toleration is going to get to a place where well Lady Osia ended up right where it was a complete conformity. Now to stand indicates a pause a lingering suggesting a deeper level of engagement. The person is no longer passing through but actively aligning him his his life with that kind of lifestyle. His way of sinners. the way and it's these people who habitually practice sin. This represents a shift of from a a toleration to almost a uh association where the individual begins to adopt or justify sinful behaviors. There's a degradation of a person where he begins to be lured in and lured in and lured in. And here sit implies the state of comfort of permanence. Let me sit here. It's the seat of the scoffers. And if you want to go back, a pastor spoke on the scoffers, the skeptics, the people that always think evil and think wrong of those things. People that openly mock God. This stage a person has fully conformed. A person has fully adopted those sinful behaviors and embracing the mindset of the scoffer, of the sinful, of the the the skeptic, all these people. We've completely embraced those things. But the Bible says, "Blessed is the man that doesn't do those things. &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man that stays away." And and you see this with this whole scripture that this slide from toleration to conformity. And I started to think about Genesis um 3:1, how it starts talking about the the serpent and how he was the most subtle and and um he was most intelligent and all of these things and and how he goes to the woman and he begins to talk to her and and she she tolerates him there. He begins to say, 'Well, um, haven't you eaten of every tree? Haven't you done this one? And and she says, 'Yeah, you can eat of every single one, but don't eat this one. Don't touch it, lest you die. There's her walking with him, tolerating his his his little antics, and then they begin to engage in conversation. Um, Brother Brandham has a really um cool kind of um uh dramatization and conflict between God and Satan where where he says that that Satan would would shoot at his target. Well, God well well, didn't it say this? And she and she would go back and say, "But God said, well, what about this?" But God said, and he just kept walking with her, talking with her. But what about this? What about that? And what about this? And what about that? But God said, but God said, but God said. And there he kept on shooting his darts. Kept on shooting at the target. Kept on and kept on and kept on. And and there you see that sliding from toleration all the way to conformity. that whole accepting what this this serpent was saying &gt;&gt; to the point where where um where finally he says but you know the wisdom of God you know do you want to be wise like God and she said then she stops brother Brandham says don't ever stop for the devil &gt;&gt; he says that in this scripture or in this quote he says don't ever stop for the devil once you stop there you've made your mistake there. She stopped. She got comfortable with the statement. She got comfortable with the situation and she said, "Well, I do kind of want to be like that. I'm not like this and I don't know those things and I don't." And he's like there, he got her there. &gt;&gt; He says, "Don't do that. Don't stop for the devil." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Don't stop even a little bit. And there she she finds herself, her and her husband, in this this total depravity from God. Changed, &gt;&gt; man. They've changed. You can look at them. You can talk to them and say, "Man, Adam, you changed. What happened here?" In Genesis 3:10 and 11, it says he said, um, here God is looking for them. Of course, we know when he says, "Where art thou?" It's not a a thought of not knowing, but it it's deeper than that. And here Adam says, "I heard thy voice in the garden. I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself." And God, he he asks another question here, not because he doesn't know, but because he's pinpointing something here. He says, he said, "Who told thee thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree where I command thee that thou should not shouldn't uh not eat?" What? What was it? God confronted Adam and Eve. And this question underscores the role of an external influence. Who told you who who told you these things? because of that external influence, that thing that that molded you. Now you have been changed to where I'm naked. I'm I'm scared. And when he began to ask them, they began to, you know, of course, blame each other and do all those things. what they changed. They allowed somebody to come into their life and and and put in an idea to where they completely changed from one thing to another. &gt;&gt; Who told you you changed? Who told you you changed? &gt;&gt; Who told you this idea? The serpent's influence in initiated the degradation, the process of Adam and Eve and and and starting with the tolerance to the association all the way down to the sitting down and conforming shows that this these external influences will change a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we when we go out into the world, we have to understand where we stand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul, he knew what and danger these people were in in Rome. And he says, "Do not be conformed. Don't be conformed to the world." Many of us or not maybe not us but maybe many of the world they say we need a change. We need a change in administration. We need a change in this. We need a change in this thing. People can say in Arizona, "Well, we need to change this law. We need to do this. We need a change. Maybe we can say in ourselves, I need a change. We need a change. We need a change. Change from certain things. I need a change from this. I need a change from that. But what are we changing into? &gt;&gt; See, change is is the beginning of a new trajectory. &gt;&gt; So when I leave this, I adopt something else. I start, I begin a new way, a new walk, a new thing. What are we changing? Now, we know what change means, but I I just want to solidify this word. It says to make a a a diff um make something different. to make a a a radical change or something radically different to give a person a position, course or direction to change to change to replace with another to make a shift from one to another. So change isn't I'm going to leave this and then now I'm fine. No, whenever you leave it's a switch. It's an adoption of something else. Yes. &gt;&gt; Change is another life, another way. That's what change is. So when we want to change, what are we changing to? When the world says we need change, we need to change this government. Well, to what? It's going to get worse. &gt;&gt; Every change that this government, that this world, that people have made has become worse. It hasn't gotten better. every change. &gt;&gt; You can't The thought I thought about when I was thinking about this is you can't put away Christ and keep his values. &gt;&gt; If if I put Christ aside and say I need a change in my life, my life, my moral values, my thoughts, my actions, the way I dress, the way I act is all going to change. because all of my life is revolved and shaped in the word of God &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. So I I I I get away from a belief and I receive another belief. I change and conformed into that belief. &gt;&gt; I go another way. I change my trajectory. &gt;&gt; Same thing. You can't you can't receive Christ and keep the world's values. So we can't say, "Hey man, I'm saved you and I'm" We see that in the world. People that are saved, people that have accepted Christ, but nothing has changed in their lives. &gt;&gt; When you adopt the belief, you become it. &gt;&gt; You change. Peter, he says in Acts 2:38, we all know it. He says repent. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says a really good quote. He says repent means to turn around. &gt;&gt; So whenever we give our heart to the Lord, it's not that we're changing our ideas and we're kind of, you know, adding some ideas about Christ and and seeing how that fits. No, we turn around. &gt;&gt; We drop one thing and we grab another. &gt;&gt; That is change in our lives. He's right, brother. &gt;&gt; He says to turn around. So Romans 12:2, it says, "Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed, &gt;&gt; changed, not shaped outwardly like conformity is, but a transformation, a metamorphice, &gt;&gt; like a butterfly, like like something from within. There is a change. &gt;&gt; You're not the same person." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. this this word it's actually metamorphu and it appears four times in the new testament I I think the scarcity of of the word means or gives it its weight it's four times the two times is in the mount transfiguration in Matthew 17:2 and mark 9:2 where it says that he was changed this metamorphu so when the bible says says, "Be ye transformed, be changed." It is a beginning of not only your inward, but you are going to be completely changed one day. &gt;&gt; It is the beginning process. The last scripture is 2 Corinthians 3:18 where we are being transformed to the same image from glory unto glory. &gt;&gt; We are being transformed. There is a beginning of this transformation that is going on. This is not an just adding and taking away ideas. This is a transformation in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To where this transformation is going to take you to a certain destination, &gt;&gt; a glorified body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A rapture in your life. &gt;&gt; That's what's going to happen. There's going to be a rapture in your life. It's not correcting the outward man. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I long time young part of my my Christian walk, I realized that we do not just as Paul says in Ephesians 6:12, we do not wrestle with flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; We do not correct an outward person. We do not try to change the outward. We do not conform it to what we want it to be. Well, I'm sure we've all seen it. long time. I I I saw somebody say, "Well, uh this sister, you know, this is a long time, so I'm I get to say it, I guess." Um they said, "Oh, she can't, you know, before you sing in the choir, you need longer dresses." Well, the sister, she wasn't living a life. She was dressing because that's the way it was, but she still wanted her style and all these things. She wasn't living a life. So changing changing the skirt size wasn't going to do anything for her. &gt;&gt; I realized that I said, "You know what? This sister doesn't need uh different clothing. She needs a change in her heart." &gt;&gt; She needs something to happen within her. &gt;&gt; I'm sure we've all gone through it. I I man, when I was young, I tried to be a Christian many times because I grew up in it, &gt;&gt; right? I was, "Oh, man. Today's my day. &gt;&gt; Didn't work. Didn't work. Didn't work until I needed the change and I wanted the change. &gt;&gt; And when that change happened, it wasn't an outward change &gt;&gt; cuz I was still dressing the way I wanted and all those things until my life began to catch up with my conviction. &gt;&gt; That is the inward change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember well uh Jesus he says in uh Luke 22:31 it says he says and the Lord said to Simon uh Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat shake you up. Who's been shooken up before? He He desires to shake you up, to get you off your course. &gt;&gt; He's But I prayed for thee. That thy faith fail not, and when thou art converted, strengthen your brethren. So he he he's given an a distinction here. He says, you're not completely what I want you to be yet. He was walking with the Lord for three and a half years. yet you're not converted yet. You're not changed yet. How many times have was I sitting in the pew before I was changed? How many years &gt;&gt; I could be with the with the, you know, singing songs and all of that, but yet desires, the influences of the world are still around. &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm still getting pulled and I'm still getting tempted. But what God wants you to do is be converted. That word is to return to turn around. &gt;&gt; So he wants you to change from one trajectory to another. And then whenever you are changed now do what you need to do. Now live your life. Now do everything that I ask you to do. As I said, Jesus's first doctrine was you must be born again. Jesus wanted to change the world one soul, one heart at a time. &gt;&gt; And he successfully did it. He got what he needed. He has his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How? By doing traditions and all those things. No, by changing the heart &gt;&gt; into being conformed or transformed into the word. I think that's the best thing. I I think Christianity, if you guys would like to stand and the musicians come. I I I truly believe that Christianity is a transformation. &gt;&gt; Salvation is a transformation. &gt;&gt; It's not just an accepting beliefs and and see how it goes and but when you become a Christian, you are transformed. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says let um it says let let the old man go &gt;&gt; and get the new man. &gt;&gt; Doesn't say man you're going to fight with him and and sometimes the new man's going to be there then the old man. No, it says let him go. &gt;&gt; Also there's a scripture where it says die. &gt;&gt; So what is it? A dying to the old person &gt;&gt; and becoming a new creature. &gt;&gt; That is Christianity. That is change. That's what every Christian goes through. &gt;&gt; And then when the world is out there, when when all these things are against you, you can say, "I am not going to conform to the world." &gt;&gt; And there's this constant transformation by the renewing of your mind through the Holy Spirit. That's my desire. &gt;&gt; And Lord, keep me in your word. &gt;&gt; Give me a desire for your word. That should be our prayer. &gt;&gt; Our prayer is Lord, give me a desire to look into this. &gt;&gt; Give me open the door. Lord, I know when I first gave my heart to the Lord, man, the these, the thous, they're still messing me up sometimes, but it's sometimes hard to understand. Lord, give me understanding. &gt;&gt; Let me hear the messages. Let me hear our our pastor. Let me hear and give me understanding and and a thirst for your word, Lord, &gt;&gt; that I may search these things and I can be completely renewed and transformed to the very image. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, that's our desire. Father, the world is trying so hard to change these things. Father, try so hard to to manipulate things in our lives and do all these things and and and and there's a showdown coming whether it's going to be in our lifetime or not. Father, we know that Lord, we are going to meet you one way or another. &gt;&gt; Whether it's through the rapture, through the grave, Father, we will see you again. Father, let our life be solidified, set, founded in you, Father, so that whenever any wind of doctrine, any movement, any cultural change, anything that happens, Lord, we can stand on your word, Father. &gt;&gt; Help your people. Strengthen them, Father. Get them more in love in you before of you, Father. &gt;&gt; We give you the honor and the glory. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen and amen. Bless you. God bless
