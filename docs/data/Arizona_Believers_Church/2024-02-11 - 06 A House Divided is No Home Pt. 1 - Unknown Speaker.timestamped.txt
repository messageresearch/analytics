[0:00] I'm not sure just how much we have set
[0:03] before us today, how much we need to get
[0:04] to or how far we'll get, but I trust
[0:07] that what portion we do touch on will be
[0:09] a blessing to you. As brother Philip
[0:12] already mentioned, we're speaking on the
[0:14] subject of the house of the Lord. And in
[0:17] that, there's a lot of things that we've
[0:19] already addressed and looked at, a lot
[0:20] of ways that we've kind of began to put
[0:22] some material out there and uh put the
[0:25] subject before you. And I hope it's been
[0:27] something that yourselves have thought
[0:28] about and saw yourself in it and even um
[0:31] these other applications of the house of
[0:34] the Lord. But we know to call it the
[0:37] house of the Lord, it has to be the
[0:38] dwelling place of God. This is a place
[0:40] that God calls home, where he finds
[0:43] home, where he finds rest. Um I like the
[0:45] ideas of home as we think, oh, this
[0:48] feels like home or the feelings of home.
[0:50] As the poet wrote, there's no place like
[0:52] home. It's because the idea of a home,
[0:56] it's a place that you always return back
[0:57] to. It's a place that has your heart in
[0:59] some ways, if we could put it that way.
[1:01] And so that's uh we're talking about the
[1:03] house of the Lord where God dwells. And
[1:06] I'm just going to take a few minutes to
[1:07] touch on the last service we preached on
[1:10] the gates of heaven. And and then I'll
[1:13] come to our our title and subject for
[1:15] today here in just a few moments. Uh the
[1:18] gates of heaven referred to a place
[1:20] where heaven is manifested on earth. And
[1:24] if there's a gate of heaven, we think,
[1:25] well, that's an entrance. That's an
[1:27] access to heaven. And as we took it from
[1:29] the scripture in Genesis chapter 28
[1:32] verses 16 and 17, as Jacob had this
[1:35] night vision, this dream, uh, as he just
[1:38] came to this place and made a a stone,
[1:40] his pillow, and as he slept in the
[1:42] night, he saw a ladder ascend up to
[1:44] heaven, angels ascending and descending,
[1:47] and he he wakes up, it says here, and he
[1:49] said, "Surely the Lord is in this place,
[1:52] and I knew it not."
[1:54] So when he the way that he phrases it,
[1:56] it's not that he feels that the Lord
[1:58] came to where he was, but he feels like
[2:00] he came to where the Lord was. That I
[2:02] didn't know I didn't even know that
[2:04] where I made my bed tonight, this was a
[2:06] place where the Lord was. And because it
[2:10] was a place where the Lord was and not
[2:11] so much where he visited or that he
[2:14] passed by, he it says he was afraid and
[2:17] said, "How dreadful is this place? This
[2:19] is none other but the house of God and
[2:22] this is the gate of heaven. Now maybe to
[2:25] put it in a in a way that you could
[2:27] understand uh maybe even for some of the
[2:30] young people I don't know if I need to
[2:32] use uh Lego analogies or what I might be
[2:35] able to do to make it relevant. Maybe
[2:36] this is maybe there's a Minecraft
[2:38] analogy in here but there's certain
[2:40] things you look for and he and you find
[2:43] an entrance or an access something
[2:44] secret. It's always there and you find
[2:46] it to g to get in somewhere and find
[2:48] something. And this is almost as if he
[2:51] said, I was I was just traveling and I
[2:54] came to place and I slept and I slept in
[2:57] a portal to heaven.
[2:59] I just happened on a place where angels
[3:01] come down and angels go back up and this
[3:03] is an access point. And and the way he
[3:05] says it is this is the house of God.
[3:07] I've come to the very place where God
[3:09] dwells. And where he's dwelling here,
[3:12] it's a gate to heaven because there has
[3:14] to be some way that God comes from
[3:16] heaven to earth to dwell and to be here.
[3:19] And so he's now identified this place a
[3:23] as a uh identified it with God by saying
[3:25] it's the house of God where God dwelt. I
[3:28] can find God here. And he calls it
[3:31] Bethl, the house of God, which is just
[3:33] that uh combination of those Hebrew
[3:35] words, house of God. And it refers to
[3:38] this consecrated place. He he viewed it
[3:40] as sacred. As he anoints this place with
[3:43] oil, raises the pillar and anoints it.
[3:45] He says, "This is a sacred meeting place
[3:47] because this is where I can find God."
[3:50] And he says, "It's none other than the
[3:52] house of God." And the phrase, "And this
[3:54] is the gate of heaven. This is a meeting
[3:58] place where the natural can meet the
[3:59] supernatural." Where there's this idea
[4:01] of God beyond my natural senses. This is
[4:04] a place where he can be felt. This is
[4:07] where heaven and earth are kind of
[4:08] blending together and there's no
[4:10] distinction. It's a quite a remarkable
[4:12] place. And to say it's the the gate of
[4:15] heaven, it brought to mind a lot of
[4:17] things. It's an entrance to heaven. It's
[4:19] a meeting place. We know in the
[4:21] scripture a gate was used in many
[4:23] different ways as a place to meet. It
[4:25] was a place of authority, a place of
[4:27] power, a place of judging. It was a
[4:29] place of justice. It was a place where
[4:32] truth was to go forth. We saw all those
[4:34] different things in in uh the meaning of
[4:36] a gate. Now to kind of summarize it now
[4:39] and kind of come to this block where we
[4:42] can move forward.
[4:44] Uh we we used our body uh this person we
[4:47] are this three-part being that we are
[4:49] our dwelling, our house, our home, our
[4:51] apartment, whatever it might be in our
[4:53] church as all being represented in a
[4:56] gate of heaven. That's what we refer to.
[4:59] We say the gates of heaven. It's a place
[5:01] where God is made manifest, where God is
[5:04] known, where the supernatural meets the
[5:06] natural. A place where there's justice
[5:09] and truth and all those things that it
[5:11] gates to represent. We recognize that I
[5:14] should represent that, that our homes
[5:16] should represent that, and that church
[5:18] should represent that.
[5:20] And we need all three. As we talked
[5:23] about a three- room house and that that
[5:24] one particular sermon that together our
[5:27] bodies and a place to live and a place
[5:30] to go to church and to fellowship, it
[5:32] constitutes that three room house in a
[5:34] way. And we need all three. Otherwise,
[5:36] you're not complete.
[5:38] And wouldn't you agree in some just even
[5:41] natural sense that if you if you have
[5:42] your life, that's great. Then if you
[5:44] have a place that you dwell and you can
[5:46] call your own, that that's that's
[5:48] greater. And then we're not complete
[5:49] unless we have a home church. uh your
[5:52] your spirit has a home in your body.
[5:54] Your body has a home in your house and
[5:55] your dwelling. And then there's got to
[5:57] be a place that we have the spiritual
[5:59] home. We have this or the soul has a
[6:01] home where it comes and it feeds and it
[6:03] and it's together and the body of Christ
[6:05] gathers. And without any one of those,
[6:07] you're not complete. Obviously, if you
[6:08] didn't have a body, you wouldn't be. But
[6:11] we there it's important to consider how
[6:13] these things are very important in light
[6:15] of the word of God. And as we closed uh
[6:18] on that service, I think it was a
[6:19] Wednesday night, we were or maybe it was
[6:21] a Sunday, I don't even remember now.
[6:22] It's been so long, but we have a duty to
[6:26] to consecrate these gates.
[6:29] The body is a temple. Uh this temple um
[6:32] lives in a home and that home need needs
[6:36] to be consecrated. We have a duty to
[6:38] consecrate these gates as homes to God.
[6:41] as we approached it from the standpoint
[6:43] of we're living as the song says, I'm
[6:45] just living this life just to live up
[6:46] there. And there's this idea that we
[6:48] just want to get to heaven. A and I kind
[6:51] of made the kind of dark comment that if
[6:53] the goal was heaven, if that's all we
[6:55] want to do is get to heaven, there's a
[6:57] shortcut, right? We just want to die and
[7:01] get to heaven. We can't wait to get to
[7:02] heaven. And that was it. Then then it
[7:05] kind of gets dark and it could escalate
[7:07] very quickly. And I think I said, "Let's
[7:08] just pass out the punch, you know? let's
[7:10] just all drink the Kool-Aid cuz that's
[7:12] the goal in the end, right? Just to get
[7:13] to heaven. But that idea alone misses
[7:16] something and it misses the context of
[7:19] how that we're not God has made a home.
[7:22] He's gone to prepare a place for us and
[7:23] and we want to go to heaven and we want
[7:25] to get there because it's a place
[7:26] prepared for us and it has a lot more
[7:28] meaning than just leaving here and
[7:30] staying there forever. But first, in the
[7:32] meantime, that'd be just a great um
[7:34] maybe a series to preach on. In the
[7:36] meantime, in the meantime, he's made a
[7:39] home for us. Let's make a home for him
[7:41] and that we should be a home for heaven
[7:45] where heaven is welcome where God is
[7:46] manifested. This is what it means to be
[7:48] a gate of heaven. This is where uh
[7:50] heaven has made its home. Heaven is
[7:52] welcome in my heart. Heaven is welcome
[7:54] in my home. Heaven is welcome in the
[7:55] church.
[7:57] And God is manifested. The word is
[7:59] expressed and there's an opportunity for
[8:01] others to come in contact with the
[8:03] supernatural and with him. Amen.
[8:06] And now as we uh approach the the title
[8:09] today and the subject today, my title is
[8:11] a house divided is no home.
[8:15] And you begin to turn back to the text
[8:17] as we'll just read it again. I think
[8:18] it'll be good just to reset. A house
[8:21] divided is no home. And my desire is to
[8:24] be very practical about our home life,
[8:26] just our individual lives, our personal
[8:28] lives. And I I it kind of hearkens back
[8:33] maybe to a consistent theme that we've
[8:34] had from the beginning here in our
[8:37] church is that it's uh what we're what
[8:39] we do here today isn't all about what we
[8:41] do here today.
[8:43] But the success of what we do here today
[8:45] can only be measured by what you do
[8:47] tomorrow.
[8:48] In other words, no matter how great the
[8:50] song service is, no matter how many
[8:51] people would pass through a prayer line
[8:52] this morning if we had one, no matter
[8:54] how much the gifts are made in operation
[8:56] here, that would be a great service. But
[8:58] the true success of this service is
[9:00] going to be measured in the impact it
[9:02] makes in your practical lives.
[9:05] And and I I want a I want a gospel and I
[9:07] want a Christ who who's with me um six
[9:10] days of the week and not just one day of
[9:12] the week or I can say seven days of the
[9:14] week and not just getting to church to
[9:16] kind of top off. I want to go to a
[9:18] church that fills me up
[9:20] a
[9:21] and that encourages me, a place where
[9:23] we're uh we're pleased to be a
[9:25] and that also uh fuels my my daily life
[9:28] and gives me some real practical things.
[9:30] And so uh we're I'm wanting the things
[9:33] that are said here to get catch our
[9:35] attention that it's we're not just here
[9:38] in a place of entertainment. This isn't
[9:41] a recreation.
[9:43] uh there there should be some very we
[9:45] should be receiving things that we could
[9:47] take and use in our daily lives
[9:50] and it's bringing us closer to God and
[9:52] making the word more real to us in a in
[9:54] a practical way.
[9:55] Amen.
[9:56] Now in Mark 3 22- 27 let's just read
[10:00] through it again and it says and the
[10:02] scribes came down from Jerusalem and
[10:04] said he hath be elabub and by the prince
[10:07] of the devils casteth out he out devils.
[10:10] Again, as we mentioned when we read the
[10:11] text, they had to have some explanation
[10:14] as to how Jesus had authority over the
[10:17] devils. And and so they kind of looked
[10:19] at it as there was some sort of
[10:20] collusion where uh uh Jesus is a devil
[10:24] who's now casting out devils. And and it
[10:27] that might seem like a compelling
[10:28] argument. Now, if I could kind of put it
[10:30] maybe more in terms again that maybe we
[10:32] could understand. If you've ever seen a
[10:34] magician perform a trick where it seems
[10:35] like he's reading somebody's mind or he
[10:37] picked somebody out of the crowd,
[10:38] sometimes our very first instinct is
[10:40] say, "Oh, that was a plant." They're in
[10:42] on it together. And maybe it could be
[10:45] implied that Jesus was a demon. He was
[10:47] be elabub and his minions and all his
[10:50] imps and all these demons, they're in on
[10:51] it. They're in on it together just to
[10:54] deceive everybody else and to lead
[10:56] people away from the truth. And and so
[10:59] Jesus says he discerns their thoughts
[11:01] even as it says in other places where
[11:03] it's referenced says and he called them
[11:06] unto him and said unto them in parables.
[11:08] Now so this is a parable the way that
[11:11] he's phrasing it. How can Satan cast out
[11:15] Satan? It's a question and I think it's
[11:17] a rhetorical question in that he's
[11:19] wanting perhaps to imply that well he
[11:22] can't
[11:23] he can't cast out himself.
[11:27] And then in verse 24, he now begins to
[11:29] make very clear statements. And if a
[11:32] kingdom be divided against itself, that
[11:35] kingdom cannot stand.
[11:37] If it turns against itself, think of all
[11:39] the things that a king kingdom
[11:41] represents and what it ought to be
[11:42] accomplishing and and how it's
[11:44] established and how it's set up. And I
[11:45] think we've got a lot of recent things
[11:47] on that that would help us if the
[11:48] kingdom be divided against itself. Now,
[11:52] this could help you to understand when
[11:53] he says, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
[11:55] And when you think individually, you
[11:58] think, well, I don't know that Satan can
[11:59] cast out Satan because Satan is Satan.
[12:01] There's no there's nothing to be opposed
[12:03] against. But now, a kingdom, you think,
[12:06] well, that's an entity in itself. But
[12:07] now there's some way that this kingdom
[12:10] divides against itself. This entity now
[12:13] somehow separates and it's it it's
[12:16] against itself. He says it cannot stand.
[12:18] And then it brings it from that larger
[12:20] level, a kingdom. He says, if it's
[12:23] divided against itself, it cannot stand.
[12:25] And if a house be divided against
[12:26] itself, that house cannot stand.
[12:30] This this is uh we see a kingdom. If
[12:33] it's divided, it won't stand. And now a
[12:35] house that brings it more molecular. It
[12:37] brings it down to a smaller unit. If
[12:38] that's divided, it cannot stand. Now he
[12:41] revisits even his question about Satan.
[12:43] And if Satan rise up against himself and
[12:45] be divided, he cannot stand
[12:48] but hath an end.
[12:50] So you see a kingdom, a house, and an
[12:52] individual. You see the gates of hell
[12:55] right there embodied in that. But then
[12:57] we can look at it for ourselves that
[12:59] there can be a a a a a broader group, a
[13:02] a a broader collection, a local
[13:04] assembly. And if that assembly gets
[13:05] divided against itself, he says it can't
[13:07] stand. It's the same for your house. If
[13:09] your house is divided, it can't stand.
[13:11] And now even for us as an individual
[13:13] that it says Satan rise up against
[13:15] himself and be divided, he cannot stand
[13:17] but hath an end. Very, very plain things
[13:20] that are being spoken here.
[13:22] No man can enter into a strong man's
[13:25] house and spoil his goods except he will
[13:28] first bind the strong man and then he
[13:31] will spoil his house.
[13:32] Now this is kind of the teaching
[13:35] conclusion
[13:36] to the parables.
[13:39] This is the conclusion that Christ
[13:40] makes. So some of these other things are
[13:42] very definitive statements. How can
[13:43] Satan cast out Satan? Kind of the
[13:45] rhetorical question. I'm going to offer
[13:46] a question. This is the question
[13:48] proposed in that I'm going to answer in
[13:50] this memo. Then he kind of gives this
[13:52] analysis and then he comes to this
[13:53] conclusion. No man can enter into a
[13:55] strong man's house and spoil his goods
[13:59] take take them away except he'll first
[14:02] bind the strong man
[14:04] and then he will spoil his house.
[14:07] So the the goods of a house cannot be
[14:09] carried away unless first the strong man
[14:11] has been bound.
[14:13] how that what has happened and what
[14:16] Christ is answering to is this uh
[14:19] proposition that Jesus is be elabub the
[14:22] prince of devils who's casting out
[14:24] devils they would be of the same house
[14:27] so be elabub would be the strong man and
[14:30] he would be the one that would be
[14:32] casting out demons and Jesus is now
[14:34] brings it to this no I have entered into
[14:38] Satan's house
[14:40] and I have bound him Right?
[14:43] Because no man can cast I cannot be
[14:46] spoiling Satan's kingdom. I cannot be
[14:48] spoiling these demons and casting them
[14:50] out and casting them away unless I had
[14:52] first entered into Satan's realm and
[14:54] Satan's Eden and Satan's kingdom. I've
[14:57] entered into Satan's house and I've
[14:58] bound him. And that is why he could cast
[15:01] out devils or as it says uh a plunder or
[15:04] spoil the house, carry it away. There
[15:06] might be a dragon story in there somehow
[15:09] about carrying away being able to take
[15:11] the house and take spoil his house. So
[15:15] this conclusion
[15:17] teaches us a great lesson and I might
[15:19] just touch on it a little bit at the
[15:20] end. And I found myself just kind of
[15:22] pushing some things off perhaps for
[15:24] Wednesday night. And this conclusion
[15:27] teaches us a great lesson that the
[15:29] strong man has to first be bound before
[15:31] a house can be spoiled. Amen.
[15:34] But the foundation teaches us a great
[15:36] lesson. The parable teaches us a great
[15:38] lesson. There's a lot that is said here
[15:40] that we can look at and build on. In
[15:42] verse 25, let's look at it together. And
[15:44] if a house be divided against itself,
[15:47] that house cannot
[15:50] stand.
[15:51] Doesn't say it's susceptible to falling.
[15:53] It doesn't say well be a little shaky.
[15:55] No, it cannot stand.
[15:58] If it remains divided, it will fall. It
[16:01] will fail. And when it says a house
[16:03] divided against itself, we ought not to
[16:05] think of just the structure of a house.
[16:08] And maybe there's some uh engineering uh
[16:10] parable that could be used or some
[16:12] architectural examples of how that if
[16:14] the foundation is uh bifurcated and or
[16:17] something happens to the structure and
[16:19] you remove something, it begins to
[16:20] separate the whole thing will fall
[16:22] apart. That certainly would make some
[16:24] sense. A and it's kind of references
[16:26] even the word is used in that way to
[16:28] speak of just a a an inhabited edifice.
[16:31] This is a a a a structure that is
[16:33] inhabited by people, a dwelling. To use
[16:36] the term house could refer to property
[16:38] and and the wealth and the goods of it.
[16:40] And that's why it says that no man uh uh
[16:42] can carry can spo when he spoils his
[16:44] house, he takes away his goods and the
[16:46] wealth a and all the resources therein.
[16:49] So it can speak of any place where one
[16:52] dwells.
[16:54] The place where one is has his fixed
[16:56] residence and that would be the the
[16:58] address on your driver's license. It
[17:00] would be your doicile, your place of
[17:02] residency. Where where's your where do
[17:04] you live? Where where's your address?
[17:06] Where do you return? Where do you keep
[17:07] your belongings? It's one's settled
[17:10] abode. It's a doicile. And because of
[17:13] that, it's really good to kind of come
[17:14] up with the definition of being
[17:15] homeless,
[17:16] right?
[17:17] It's when you don't have a house. You
[17:18] don't have a place that's settled. It's
[17:20] fixed. It's permanent. This is where
[17:21] where I'm living. And so it can refer to
[17:25] a a place where one resides. This word
[17:27] house, I kind of catch these parallels.
[17:29] Word house can refer to a place where
[17:32] one lives, where they lay their head,
[17:33] where they keep their possessions. It's
[17:35] a fixed place of residence. But then it
[17:37] can also be used of any building
[17:38] whatsoever.
[17:40] It's used of the palace. It's used of
[17:42] the house of God. It's used of the
[17:43] tabernacle. And so it can refer to a
[17:46] place that you live. It can also refer
[17:47] to a place where you worship. And it's
[17:49] also used of the human body that demons
[17:52] can live in. And and so it has the same
[17:55] meaning to where it uh it it can be used
[17:58] in the sense of a house is a church, a
[18:00] house is a dwelling place and a house
[18:02] can be you.
[18:04] And it refers to two on a very uh broad
[18:08] scale the persons
[18:11] forming one family, a house.
[18:14] It's a household. The family of God, the
[18:16] body of Christ, the church is a house.
[18:19] It's the house of the Lord. It is the
[18:20] body of Christ. It's the family. It's a
[18:22] household. That's what the word can
[18:23] refer to. So you see again the gates of
[18:25] heaven, the church, a house and a body.
[18:28] That's you where you live, the church
[18:31] you go to. It's the family unit
[18:34] even collectively that would relate in
[18:36] each one of these instances. So it says
[18:39] a house divided cesus divided against
[18:42] itself.
[18:45] I the phrasing is intentional. a house
[18:50] divided against itself. To be divided is
[18:53] to be separated into groups. So it's not
[18:56] that just the house has been divided,
[18:58] but it's been divided into groups
[19:00] against or opposed to each other.
[19:03] It's one thing to be separated
[19:06] and and and and in the separation
[19:09] and in the the dividing uh you just kind
[19:11] of you kind of take two groups and you
[19:13] carve them out. It would be like well uh
[19:15] let's have some ice cream and all we
[19:17] have is chocolate and vanilla. So,
[19:18] you're eventually going to come up with
[19:20] two sides cuz you can't have a twist or
[19:21] you can't mix. You can't have both. And
[19:23] so, if we did that, you could be able to
[19:25] say, "All right, now everyone had
[19:27] chocolate." This might be a good youth
[19:28] meetings test. And every those who had
[19:30] chocolate over here, those who had
[19:31] vanilla over here, and that would just
[19:34] be two different groups. Maybe it's a
[19:36] division of taste and preferences. And
[19:39] that's not the division that's being
[19:41] talked about. It's divided against
[19:42] itself where you begin to make that
[19:44] distinction. Right? I'll never forget
[19:47] when I was having lunch with brother
[19:48] Lucas and they he asked for a water and
[19:52] instead of asking for a lemon, he asked
[19:54] for a lime. You want to know why?
[19:56] Because it's a superior citrus.
[20:02] And so that just one having one
[20:04] preference over the other, that's one
[20:06] thing. But if if Brother Lucas is over
[20:08] there judging the other guy who asked
[20:10] for a lemon and he's going, "Well,
[20:15] I didn't know you were so basic."
[20:18] Right? A lemon? Really? A and and even
[20:22] the arguments to begin, they cut up all
[20:24] the lemons to begin with. So those
[20:25] things have just been sitting there. But
[20:26] when you ask for a lime, it's fresh cut.
[20:29] And there might be a lot of things that
[20:30] go into it. But could you imagine that
[20:32] becoming a point of contention where now
[20:35] Lucas is looking down on the person that
[20:37] has lemon in their water and then that
[20:40] causes the lunch to the whole tenor of
[20:42] the lunch changes and then you begin to
[20:44] argue and fight and how long did we not
[20:46] talk to each other after that lunch? No,
[20:48] I'm kidding. It didn't go that way. But
[20:50] there's something about that that the
[20:52] attitude where then all those who got
[20:54] chocolate start to look down on those
[20:56] that have the vanilla and they start to
[20:58] divide against each other. They were one
[21:00] group until something could distinguish
[21:03] them from one another and create a
[21:06] division that's not just in the
[21:08] distinction but the in the opposing.
[21:11] To divide means to be separated into
[21:13] parts cut into pieces means to be
[21:15] divided into parties to split into
[21:19] factions.
[21:21] what was one at one time a cohesive
[21:24] collective one under some arrangement or
[21:28] some idea. Uh you have a youth group and
[21:32] that youth group is you call it a youth
[21:34] group but now they you found a way to
[21:36] divide them
[21:37] right
[21:38] and now it's not just a division of
[21:41] distinction and preferences but now
[21:43] there's a way you pit them against each
[21:45] other and once you do that a whole new
[21:48] ball game starts
[21:49] literally sometimes
[21:51] And it's disorder from what was
[21:54] right
[21:55] the the the kingdom, the house, the
[21:57] individual, whatever it is, it's now
[21:59] been split up. And we can we can
[22:02] experience this on an individual level.
[22:05] In James 1:8, it says, "A double-minded
[22:08] man is unstable in all his ways."
[22:11] Speaks of divided loyalties. that a man
[22:14] who's divided within himself, a man who
[22:17] may be divided against himself, and it
[22:21] doesn't mean that there's differences
[22:22] within himself, but it's a man who has
[22:25] opposition and opposing within himself
[22:28] has these divided loies. It leads to
[22:30] instability. Right.
[22:34] It
[22:34] says in Matthew 6:4, "No man can serve
[22:37] two masters. For he either will hate the
[22:40] one and love the other or also hold to
[22:42] the one and despise the other." We've
[22:43] we've addressed this quite a bit
[22:45] recently. And you cannot serve God and
[22:48] mammon.
[22:49] That's taking the man, the individual,
[22:51] and trying to divide himself between two
[22:54] first loves. Divide themselves between
[22:56] two masters. A master is an owner, a
[22:58] possessor, uh the disposer of a thing.
[23:01] It's the one who has control. And so,
[23:04] how can two people have control? They
[23:07] would be against those two would be
[23:09] against another. Say, "Oh, I serve God
[23:11] and man, and they both have absolute
[23:13] control." And God and man would be like,
[23:15] "Huh? How does that work?"
[23:17] Right? That that that doesn't work. It's
[23:19] a it's a paradox that's going to be
[23:21] resolved as false. It cannot happen. You
[23:24] cannot serve God in mammon.
[23:27] So, there's a possessor of you, a
[23:29] controller. And if one finds himself
[23:32] divided that it that's it's going to
[23:34] lead to a despising it's going to lead
[23:36] to a degradation of attitude and and
[23:39] humility
[23:41] says in Acts chapter 2 1 to2
[23:45] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[23:47] come they were all with one accord in
[23:50] one place and suddenly there came a
[23:52] sound from heaven as a rushing mighty
[23:55] wind and it filled all the house where
[23:57] they were sitting. Here we see a a unity
[24:04] where there's unity, there's power on
[24:07] the day of Pentecost when it had fully
[24:09] come. So now it is the time and season
[24:12] for the prophecy to be fulfilled.
[24:16] It says they were all with one accord.
[24:18] That means with one mind and with one
[24:21] passion.
[24:23] And when they were all with one accord
[24:25] in one place, they're not divided.
[24:28] They're not separated. They're all
[24:29] together
[24:31] in one place. It says, "Suddenly, there
[24:34] came a sound from heaven." Now, what a
[24:37] beautiful image cuz if you recall when
[24:38] they first built the temple, the
[24:40] tabernacle in the wilderness and they
[24:42] had had the the holiest of holies, the
[24:44] holy place, they had begin to arrange
[24:46] all these elements. And so you had the
[24:48] uh the inner you had the inner court
[24:51] this the the the holiest of holies the
[24:54] the mo the uh the holy place and this
[24:56] division and then you kind of had this
[24:58] broad outer court. It's just open air at
[25:00] this point but it says as soon as they
[25:02] set up the outer wall and they set in
[25:06] place that last distinction to create
[25:09] the outer court to uh to distinguish it
[25:11] from the inner court that had those two
[25:13] places in it. As soon as that happened,
[25:15] it says the power of God came, the
[25:17] presence of God came down and began to
[25:19] fill that tabernacle filled that temple.
[25:22] As soon as they set it up and erected
[25:24] it, so just as the walls of the
[25:27] tabernacle being raised, brought the
[25:29] presence of God down into the tabernacle
[25:31] in the wilderness, now it says when they
[25:33] were all with one pl in one accord in
[25:35] one place, suddenly God comes down. And
[25:39] it's showing that that um that unity
[25:41] that they had, that togetherness,
[25:43] they're not divided against themselves.
[25:44] Brother Brandham said where there's
[25:46] disunityity, the spirit of God is not
[25:47] welcome.
[25:49] And here it says that they were all with
[25:51] one accord in one place. That Greek word
[25:53] homothadon, it's a compound word of a
[25:56] word which means to rush along or to
[25:59] have passion. And then in unison,
[26:02] another word meaning in unison.
[26:05] And and it it's it has it creates quite
[26:08] a word picture because this rushing
[26:10] along in this passion. It's very
[26:12] energetic. I it it's intense. It might
[26:15] even seem to be uh uh intermittent or
[26:18] way that you can't quite distinguish a
[26:19] pattern. But yet there's some element of
[26:22] passion and ferveny and heat. Just
[26:24] imagine like a flame licking. As it
[26:28] says, even the tongues of fire fell upon
[26:29] them. And so as it's falling and and
[26:32] it's it's like lighting, you just see
[26:34] like these just random patterns and it
[26:36] just seems to be firing. But now it says
[26:37] you have this passion and this rushing
[26:39] rushing along, but it's in unison.
[26:42] It's not just concordant. It creates a
[26:45] musical image.
[26:47] Where symphony is playing and you you
[26:51] focus in on one one that's playing and
[26:53] it's just their their hair is flying
[26:55] everywhere. They're really moving along.
[26:57] And then you look at another side and
[26:59] you just see a few movements. You look
[27:01] somewhere, someone's not doing anything.
[27:02] And you just look at all the activity of
[27:04] a symphony.
[27:06] And and if you didn't know what it was,
[27:07] you'd be like, "Ah, what's going on
[27:09] here?" And there's this one's doing that
[27:10] one. And it may not seem like they're
[27:12] all together because one may be doing
[27:14] something like this, and another person
[27:16] may be doing something like this, and
[27:18] they may not even be in beat. Uh, as you
[27:20] look at it, the the one that's doing
[27:22] this isn't matching it like this. And
[27:24] and you look at all it but all these
[27:26] different things in this symphony. You
[27:28] may have different notes being played by
[27:30] many many different instruments, many
[27:33] different groups. But what happens is
[27:35] they all harmonize in pitch. They all
[27:38] harmonize in tone. They all harmonize in
[27:40] beat different sections, different
[27:44] chairs. even within a section, different
[27:46] parts, different tones, uh different
[27:49] melodies in a sense that one may be
[27:51] harmonizing, one may be playing the h
[27:53] the the melody. There's a lot of things
[27:55] that play together and when that
[27:58] symphony plays. Now, if you've ever been
[28:00] to one, you want to know what the
[28:01] difference I'm talking about is go
[28:03] early,
[28:04] right?
[28:05] And listen to them warm up.
[28:07] Same instruments, same gifts, same
[28:10] talents,
[28:11] same they're going to be playing the
[28:13] same piece later on and it's
[28:16] [Music]
[28:19] and it's all it's chaos.
[28:23] But then once they all start playing
[28:27] and they're different sections, they're
[28:29] different chairs, they diff they have
[28:31] different parts, they have different
[28:32] tones, they have all these different
[28:34] things, but yet with the many different
[28:35] notes and the many different
[28:36] instruments, they all harmonize and
[28:38] pitch and tone and beat and melody. It
[28:40] all there's no chaos.
[28:43] There's no disorder despite all the
[28:45] different notes,
[28:47] all the different roles, all the
[28:50] different instruments, all the different
[28:51] gifts,
[28:52] right?
[28:53] All the different positions, all the
[28:54] different experiences. You could have a
[28:57] first chair who's done it for years and
[29:00] a fifth chair that's this is their first
[29:02] this is their first symphony with the
[29:03] with the orchestra or whatever it might
[29:05] be. And yet they all harmonize together.
[29:11] So you could see it as an individual we
[29:13] can be divided
[29:15] as a as a unit we must be united as it
[29:18] says in Amos chapter 3:3 can two walk
[29:21] together except they be agreed I'm
[29:23] wanting you just to see in a house
[29:26] divided against itself what that what
[29:28] that might look like
[29:31] can two walk together except they be
[29:33] agreed again this is a rhetorical
[29:35] question that we should assume the
[29:37] answer and the answer is No. And if it
[29:42] seems difficult to answer no,
[29:47] we just we just accept it as scripture.
[29:49] So maybe we don't wrestle with it at
[29:50] all. But then we we ask ourselves,
[29:54] I've been on a lot of walks with people
[29:56] I didn't agree with.
[29:58] Right? And we hiked it just fine. Might
[30:02] have made it more interesting that we
[30:03] disagreed. And so we might have some
[30:06] kind of rub and we begin to think, well,
[30:08] literally, how does this work? But how
[30:10] can two make progress or journey
[30:13] together unless they have agreement?
[30:15] And the word agreed here has more
[30:18] meaning than just uh uh that in order
[30:21] for us to go on a physical walk, we have
[30:23] to agree with one another on everything.
[30:27] But it says, how can two walk together
[30:29] unless they be agreed? It means an
[30:31] appointed time and a place of meeting.
[30:34] How can this is beautiful? How can two
[30:36] really walk together until they've met?
[30:41] And so it's kind of like I say sometimes
[30:43] I say, "Oh, do you know so and so?" I
[30:44] go, "Yes, we went to different schools
[30:46] together." And and it's kind of And if
[30:49] they don't catch it, they just assume
[30:50] you meant you went to school together,
[30:52] but you say different schools. And how
[30:54] can you go to school with someone if
[30:57] you're at different schools? And they
[30:59] go, "Why did Amos just write it that
[31:00] way?" that there has to be a common
[31:03] meeting point.
[31:05] I could if I knew that you had hiked uh
[31:08] Camelback Mountain and a couple years
[31:10] ago and then I just did it yesterday and
[31:12] I and I said, "Man, isn't that awesome?
[31:13] We hiked Camelback together." And you'd
[31:15] be like, "You weren't there?" I'm like,
[31:17] "Have you hiked Camel Back?" And you're
[31:19] like, "Yeah, I've done it." It's like,
[31:22] "I've done it, too. We did it together."
[31:25] No, you can't do it together
[31:28] unless you meet. You're in the same
[31:31] place. How can two walk together unless
[31:33] they first meet?
[31:35] They're in the same place. They're going
[31:37] the same direction and they stay
[31:40] together. I mean, it's really stating
[31:42] the obvious, but it really has you
[31:44] thinking this morning to think about
[31:46] what it means to walk together, what it
[31:48] means to be together. How can two walk
[31:50] together except they be agreed?
[31:54] This is what is meant by a house
[31:56] divided. If you if you don't meet at the
[31:59] same place, you're not walking together.
[32:00] If you're not going the same direction,
[32:02] you're not walking together. It's kind
[32:04] of like that awkward walk sometimes when
[32:06] you're fellowshipping with somebody and
[32:08] they're walking to their car and you're
[32:09] walking to your car and you get to the
[32:11] point where it's like
[32:13] I'm going to my car.
[32:16] Are you going with me? No, I'm going to
[32:17] my car. See you. Right. It's over. We're
[32:21] not talking anymore. We were just
[32:22] talking to each other cuz it was
[32:24] awkward. we just were both walking the
[32:26] same place and oh hey how are you doing
[32:29] and that's the idea is that once if
[32:31] there's a point of departure it's when
[32:33] you have different goals different
[32:34] visions and I want to do this and you
[32:36] want to do that I want to take the hard
[32:37] route you want to take the easy route
[32:38] how can two walk together unless they
[32:40] have a a meeting a meeting place and now
[32:44] they can journey together in contract
[32:46] language in order for even a contract to
[32:48] be valid there has to be a meeting of
[32:50] the minds
[32:52] in other words I have certain
[32:53] expectations You have certain
[32:54] expectations and our minds meet as to
[32:57] what they are. And a contract can fail
[33:01] even though it's signed if you can prove
[33:03] that their minds never met.
[33:06] One had this idea, another had this one,
[33:08] and the contract failed to sufficiently
[33:12] lay out the agreement of between the two
[33:14] parties to where you could say they both
[33:16] agreed on what the essential terms were.
[33:19] They had a meeting in the minds of the
[33:21] timing. They had a meeting in the minds
[33:22] of payment. They had a meeting in times
[33:23] of performance. Meeting in the minds of
[33:25] performance. All those things have to
[33:27] meet.
[33:29] That's the that's the unity. And then if
[33:32] we can understand what the unity is,
[33:34] then we can begin to understand what the
[33:35] division is.
[33:37] And it says, "A house divided against
[33:39] itself, that house cannot
[33:43] stand."
[33:45] In other words, it's unable to be
[33:46] established. Stand is fixed.
[33:48] Established, made firm. It's unable to
[33:49] be established.
[33:51] It's unable to stand still.
[33:54] It's unable to be placed.
[33:56] A house that is divided can't be dressed
[33:59] properly because it's it's it it's
[34:01] moving too much. A house that is a
[34:03] divided cannot be established. It cannot
[34:05] be placed. It cannot find its purpose.
[34:07] It cannot fulfill all that it is called
[34:10] to accomplish. You may be running a
[34:14] household. You may be an individual. But
[34:16] if you're divided against yourself,
[34:17] you're not going to make the progress
[34:18] that you ought to. You're not going to
[34:20] be as successful as you could be. You
[34:21] may be managing a household, but if the
[34:23] house is divided, it's not going to be
[34:25] all that it can be. You're never going
[34:26] to meet your potential even within a
[34:28] church. If a church is divided against
[34:30] itself on any level, there's going to be
[34:32] some lack of efficiency. There's going
[34:34] to be something that's missing.
[34:36] Amen.
[34:37] So, the division prevents maturity.
[34:40] The division prevents growing. It'd be
[34:43] like having a plant here and the soil
[34:45] here and the water here. And I got I got
[34:48] it all.
[34:49] But the things have to be put together
[34:51] the right way.
[34:52] The division prevents the growth and
[34:54] development. The division prevents the
[34:56] proper use of power,
[34:57] right?
[34:58] To where things are they're together the
[35:01] way that they ought to be.
[35:03] In Matthew 12:2, it says it this way,
[35:07] just referring to the same exact reading
[35:09] in Mark 3. And Jesus knew their thoughts
[35:10] and said unto them, "Every kingdom
[35:13] divided against itself is brought to
[35:15] desolation.
[35:18] the desolation of division.
[35:22] It's brought to desolation and every
[35:24] city or house divided against itself
[35:26] shall not stand.
[35:31] When divided, it can't progress.
[35:34] When turned, I want you to think of
[35:37] that. When divided, it can't progress.
[35:40] How can two walk together except they
[35:42] meet? They have a meeting of minds and
[35:44] they go the same direction.
[35:46] They may for a moment walk together
[35:50] and we could even say that when you're
[35:52] walking some of these green belts you're
[35:54] walking there someone may be coming this
[35:56] way and you may be going that way and at
[35:57] a certain moment in time you say we walk
[35:59] together
[36:00] right but you go in different directions
[36:03] just momentary and so you can say that
[36:05] when we are divided
[36:07] uh we don't progress the same way we
[36:09] can't progress I want to make that
[36:11] statement that an individual who's
[36:12] divided is only going to be able to
[36:14] progress so far a house that's divided
[36:15] can only progress so far. A church
[36:17] that's divided can only progress so far.
[36:18] A family that's divided can only
[36:20] progress so far. There's a point at
[36:21] which you can say we will never never go
[36:23] beyond this.
[36:26] But now let me just bring it a step
[36:27] further
[36:29] when it turns against itself.
[36:32] It dies.
[36:33] Yeah.
[36:34] It's one thing to not progress. It's one
[36:36] thing to kind of just get stuck in the
[36:38] mud. It's one thing for one to be going
[36:40] this way, one to be going that way, and
[36:41] you walk by a hiker and you're like,
[36:43] "Hey, good to see you. I think I saw a a
[36:45] meme one time of the face that you make
[36:47] when you pass another hiker on a trail
[36:49] and it was kind of funny and I'm not
[36:51] going to try to duplicate it here, but
[36:53] there's this this kind of half smile
[36:55] that you give and sometimes there's just
[36:57] a knowing nodu
[36:59] of what uh uh uh when you're on these
[37:01] trails and that wouldn't be that's kind
[37:03] of the friendly hi hi hi right you're
[37:05] you're going to let people know you're
[37:06] going to give them the little right
[37:07] you're going to let them know I I
[37:08] acknowledge you don't want to make it
[37:10] awkward and so there's there's a we're
[37:13] not going to be going the same
[37:14] direction. We're going to go be going at
[37:16] different paces. But then if you
[37:18] stopped, right?
[37:21] And didn't like the way the person
[37:22] looked at you. And then now you you're
[37:24] divided. Now it becomes I'm against you,
[37:28] right? Someone's coming this way. I
[37:29] said, "Did you already make it to the
[37:30] top? Are you on the back? Are you on the
[37:32] way back?" It's like, "Yeah." It's like,
[37:33] "I don't want you to beat me. I I want
[37:35] to beat you." And you start getting into
[37:36] a big fight. That the hike's over maybe
[37:38] at that point. I hope you catch what I'm
[37:41] saying. If it turns against itself,
[37:42] that's when it falters.
[37:44] It's one thing not to go forward. It's
[37:46] another thing to be failed, to be
[37:47] brought to desolation. And that's why I
[37:49] say a house divided
[37:51] is no home.
[37:54] A house divided
[37:57] is no home.
[38:04] Let me say it this way
[38:07] because I and I'm going to skip to first
[38:09] Peter chapter 5 here if you want to turn
[38:11] there.
[38:13] I'm I'm running out of time today.
[38:17] House
[38:21] to have a place if a place that we want
[38:24] to call home. It has to be more than
[38:25] just a physical structure. It's more
[38:26] than a building.
[38:29] And a house divided against itself,
[38:31] that's a house that's fighting.
[38:34] It's a house that within the house
[38:37] itself,
[38:39] your enemies
[38:41] within the house itself, the enemies
[38:42] aren't from without. When the enemies
[38:44] are from without, then then you know how
[38:46] to defend yourself. There's strength in
[38:48] being together. And there's this idea,
[38:49] well, the enemy is out there and we're
[38:51] fortified together and and it gives you
[38:54] some kind of strength to know. But then
[38:55] when the enemy is within,
[38:57] that's that that that you don't have a
[38:59] house.
[39:01] A house divided is no home. Because the
[39:04] idea idea of a home is a place of peace
[39:06] and comfort and provision and safety and
[39:08] rest. When someone says, "I feel at
[39:10] home." Right? We could take that. We do
[39:12] joke around sometimes. You go into
[39:14] somebody's house and there's a bunch of
[39:15] fighting and arguing. You go, "I feel at
[39:17] home." Right? Because that's the way
[39:19] your house was when you were growing up.
[39:20] It's like, "Hey, if they're not yelling
[39:22] at each other, it doesn't feel like
[39:23] home." But we know what someone means
[39:25] when we say, "I feel at home. I feel
[39:27] comfortable. I feel welcome. I feel like
[39:28] I belong." That's what we that's what we
[39:30] intend when we say, "I feel like I
[39:32] belong. I don't feel resistance. I don't
[39:34] feel hated. I don't feel put out put out
[39:36] or that I'm putting somebody else out."
[39:39] I I I don't know that we should ever
[39:41] have the feeling that when we're
[39:42] literally in our house or our home that
[39:45] we feel like we're putting somebody out
[39:47] or you feel put out.
[39:51] That's a that's why home has a has a
[39:53] particular feeling, a place of
[39:55] belonging. It it should conjure up
[39:56] certain feelings. And so a house divided
[39:58] is no home,
[40:00] right?
[40:01] But a house united is a home.
[40:03] Now, I hope that I can somehow uh and I
[40:08] know I still have quite a bit here uh to
[40:11] get to, so I'm just not sure how I'm
[40:13] going to be able to bring this to a
[40:14] close. So, you just you help me. You
[40:17] help me do it. So, I'm just going to
[40:18] trust you to close.
[40:21] All right. So, we've shifted the
[40:23] responsibility.
[40:25] I appreciate Thank you for taking that
[40:26] on because it's rough. It's rough up
[40:28] here to do that. In first Peter chapter
[40:32] 5, I want to read this, but before we
[40:34] do, think of this. A house united,
[40:37] there's a house divided, it's not going
[40:39] to progress. When it's divided against
[40:40] itself is what the scriptur is referring
[40:42] to, it will be brought to desolation. It
[40:44] will fail. It'll falter. It'll die.
[40:46] And so a house that's united means that
[40:48] whatever that division was, whatever
[40:50] that disorder was, it's the opposite of
[40:52] that, we're going to invert. Therefore,
[40:54] the the united house or the house in its
[40:57] original arrangement as it ought to be
[40:59] because it's the order and the
[41:01] arrangement that's going to give it its
[41:02] strength. Its order, its arrangement
[41:05] going to be what gives it the character.
[41:06] It's going to be its order and
[41:07] arrangement that that allows it to avoid
[41:10] desolation, to stand, to progress. So if
[41:12] there's a way that you could uh split
[41:14] that division or you could split that
[41:16] uniting split that uh one unit the
[41:19] family or the house or the church and
[41:22] compete make them compete or pit them
[41:25] against each other they lose their
[41:27] strength. So there's something about
[41:29] being arranged together properly that
[41:32] gives us inoculates us and gives us
[41:34] immunity and gives us strength against
[41:37] the enemy. Amen.
[41:38] But if there's a way that you could turn
[41:40] it out, turn it inside out and get them
[41:42] against each other, you lose that uh
[41:44] ability that to not be impermanmeated.
[41:48] 1 Peter chapter 5:5, "Likewise, you
[41:50] younger, submit yourselves unto the
[41:51] elder." Now, the the the elder like
[41:54] that, right? Yeah.
[41:57] Yay. All of you be subject one to
[42:00] another.
[42:01] And everybody should say, "Yeah."
[42:04] I mean, if the old guys over there
[42:05] going, "Do you hear that, young people?"
[42:08] Then the I mean, I guess the young
[42:11] people could do the same thing and say,
[42:12] "You hear that, old man?"
[42:14] He says, "And all of you be subject one
[42:17] to another."
[42:18] And be clothed with humility.
[42:20] Amen.
[42:22] For God resisteth the proud and giveth
[42:25] grace to the humble.
[42:27] That tells you a lot.
[42:29] Tells you a lot about God's nature, what
[42:30] he values. Remember how we talked about
[42:32] we're looking at in this whole idea of
[42:34] the house of God is what God values one
[42:36] thing desired
[42:38] says that we the younger should submit
[42:40] themselves to the elder but then it says
[42:42] yay all of you be subject one to another
[42:45] to be subject it means to arrange under
[42:48] to be subordinate and that's kind of why
[42:51] the old man's like
[42:54] because it means to subject yourself to
[42:56] oneself to someone else to obey you
[42:59] submit to one's control. You're going to
[43:01] yield to one's admonishment or advice.
[43:06] And so when we look at it that way, it
[43:07] kind of comes from that there's a
[43:10] military aspect to this subjecting to
[43:13] where there's a sense of that when
[43:14] you've subjected yourself to the
[43:15] commanding officer within that context
[43:18] that that you're to obey it, that you're
[43:20] not the one that has the orders, you're
[43:21] the one that packs them out. And so when
[43:24] it says younger submit yourselves to the
[43:26] elder, we could see this idea that yes,
[43:29] that there's going to be a wisdom or
[43:31] there's going to be a relationship,
[43:32] something that dictates that that's the
[43:34] decision maker and I'm the one that's to
[43:36] be receiving the instruction and I'm the
[43:37] one to do it. So there's relationships
[43:39] that'll determine the one who is
[43:41] essentially it says subordinate or the
[43:44] one that uh you're yielding to that
[43:45] person's advice or their decision. But
[43:48] it also in a non-military way it means a
[43:51] voluntary attitude of giving in
[43:55] a voluntary attitude of cooperating
[43:59] assuming responsibility
[44:02] and carrying a burden.
[44:04] So now whereas we could divide it in the
[44:07] sense that you have the elders and you
[44:08] have the younger the younger to serve
[44:10] the elders and now we've been able to
[44:11] create a ruling class and we've been
[44:12] able to create the working class and and
[44:15] those uh the common man has to listen to
[44:17] the old older man and do what he says
[44:19] and we begin to divide the nation or the
[44:22] group between the older and the younger
[44:23] and the elders have to be respected. You
[44:26] divide it between ministry and leoty.
[44:28] The ministry get to eat first. They get
[44:29] to have the best tables. Everyone else
[44:31] has to wait. you divide it between men
[44:33] and women and you have all these the
[44:34] these divisions amongst uh offices or
[44:38] gender and all these things. Uh it it's
[44:40] now there's a way of looking at says
[44:41] there's a voluntary attitude of
[44:43] cooperating and assuming responsibility
[44:45] and carrying a burden to where it's not
[44:47] just all on one but somehow together
[44:50] we're mutually accountable. We're all
[44:52] mutually responsible. We're all working
[44:54] together.
[44:55] I may not have the same job but we're
[44:57] working to the same goal.
[44:59] Hallelujah. Amen. Ephesians chapter 5 21
[45:03] it says submitting yourselves one to
[45:04] another in the fear of God.
[45:07] If we take the idea of being subject or
[45:09] submitting to mean there's one who's on
[45:12] top and there's one that's on bottom. If
[45:13] we take the idea that there's one who is
[45:15] the the in control total control and
[45:17] there's someone who's obeying then the
[45:19] very idea that we should could be
[45:20] subject one to another doesn't make
[45:23] sense.
[45:25] And so the submission one to another as
[45:28] Peter says it all be subject one to
[45:30] another. As Paul says submitting
[45:32] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[45:33] God. This isn't some sort of imposed
[45:36] hierarchy that creates a power imbalance
[45:39] where you have those that are the rulers
[45:41] and those that have the authority and
[45:42] those that have the power and then you
[45:44] have those that are weak and those that
[45:45] have no say. It's it's not that kind of
[45:49] division,
[45:50] right?
[45:51] But it's order and it's arrangement.
[45:54] It's a way that we all fit together and
[45:56] we as as it was expressed, Brother Chris
[45:59] expressed it so beautifully on Wednesday
[46:01] night, have this idea of staying in your
[46:03] lane and what your calling is and and
[46:06] how you ought to work and how you ought
[46:07] to manifest and and he really addressed
[46:09] it from a really really unique angles
[46:11] because kind of we all have this idea of
[46:13] my post and this is what I'm supposed to
[46:14] do and then we're all afraid when
[46:16] somebody does something else. what
[46:18] that's when something's been enforced by
[46:20] legalism and hierarchy
[46:22] and it's not this idea that we're all
[46:24] kind of working together to a collective
[46:26] end. We we understand the job. We
[46:28] understand the goal. We understand the
[46:30] mission and we're all working together
[46:32] to help this mission be fulfilled. And
[46:34] it's not all about like that was my job.
[46:38] You know, I'm the one that waters the
[46:39] plants. So why would you water the
[46:42] plants? Well, I didn't see your car. I
[46:44] thought you were out of town. someone
[46:46] told me that the plants hadn't been
[46:47] watered, right?
[46:49] It'd be one of those things where it's
[46:50] like, where in the world do we get this
[46:52] idea,
[46:54] that this is the this person's job and
[46:56] this is what they do and that when the
[46:58] need is there and somebody else wants to
[47:00] step in and help out that we get
[47:01] offended and we get all been out of
[47:02] shape. That means there's something
[47:04] wrong in the way that it was being done,
[47:06] the attitude, the mission, the vision
[47:07] for it. Because the subjecting ourselves
[47:10] one to another means there's something
[47:12] that has united us in the fear of the
[47:14] Lord. There's some common thing that
[47:16] we're united to, some common vision that
[47:18] we all have to where we're arranged
[47:20] together despite our differences and
[47:23] despite our different experiences and
[47:25] callings and notes and instruments and
[47:27] and all those different things that we
[47:30] are arranged together to promote virtue,
[47:32] to promote strength, and to fulfill our
[47:34] purpose.
[47:34] Amen.
[47:36] So, it's the arrangement of it. It's the
[47:38] order of it.
[47:40] When we're subject one to another, we
[47:43] don't have to figure out whether I am
[47:49] the boss and you're the employee. I just
[47:52] have to figure out how am I arranged
[47:54] together with you.
[47:55] Right. Right.
[47:56] We don't have to figure out from top
[47:58] down
[47:58] or the bottom up. We just have to figure
[48:00] out how where we fit and understand that
[48:03] it's my the order and the arrangement
[48:05] together without creating one that's
[48:07] better than the other. Amen.
[48:10] And if we look at it that way, then no
[48:12] one ever looks down on someone else.
[48:15] Amen.
[48:16] The sermon, believe thou this, it says,
[48:18] "Your pastor here out to his home, such
[48:21] a lovely place."
[48:24] And I I I don't know. I remember at one
[48:27] time I was reading through this and
[48:28] tried to get as much information as I
[48:29] could of the pastor, but he's saying, "I
[48:31] visited the pastor in his house." And he
[48:33] says, "It's a lovely place." Now, he
[48:35] says, "Lovely? What I mean by that, the
[48:37] characteristic of it
[48:40] now, in the way that he catches himself,
[48:43] this man may have had a very, very
[48:45] simple house,
[48:46] right?
[48:47] It's possible that he might have had a
[48:48] really, really nice house and brother
[48:49] Bram didn't want to kind of let the cat
[48:51] out of the bag if other people didn't
[48:52] know where he lived. I don't know what
[48:54] the circumstances were, but it becomes a
[48:55] teaching moment for brother Brandham
[48:57] because he says for brother Bram to
[48:58] teach us something. says it wasn't a
[49:00] lovely home because it was furnished
[49:02] really well
[49:03] and it was in the nice neighborhood and
[49:04] it had all the gingerbread trappings and
[49:06] it just looked really really really
[49:07] good. But he says, "I I I don't mean it
[49:10] was good square footage and it had all
[49:12] the nice uh marble and the countertops
[49:15] and all the best faucets and all those
[49:17] things." He says, "No, it was the
[49:19] characteristic of it,
[49:22] the character of it." So the home isn't
[49:24] the house you live in. Notice he says
[49:26] it's the order of the house. Then
[49:29] What makes a house a home isn't the fact
[49:31] that it's got four walls and a roof and
[49:33] a place that you put your possessions
[49:34] and a place you sleep and the fact that
[49:36] you have uh legal title to it or
[49:38] possession or some sort of lease that
[49:39] grants you the right to use it. He says
[49:41] it's the order of it that's what makes a
[49:44] home.
[49:45] So he says and you know as they say a
[49:47] tent or a cottage why should I care?
[49:49] They're building a palace for me over
[49:51] there.
[49:53] But then he's bringing it right back
[49:54] down to earth. I've seen people lived in
[49:56] palaces and didn't have much of a home.
[49:58] Amen.
[49:59] I've seen people that lived up on the
[50:01] hilltop and and 14 karat doorork knobs
[50:05] and big huge rich families and beautiful
[50:08] weddings and yet witness the dysfunction
[50:11] and the fighting and the arguing and the
[50:13] disharmony and the disunityity and the
[50:15] division of the night before and witness
[50:16] it and then just see how quickly they
[50:18] can answer the door and prepare to be
[50:21] pretend to be united. Oh, brother
[50:23] Brandham, we were just talking about
[50:26] you. No, you're talking about that woman
[50:28] he danced with last night, right? He it
[50:30] called out, but then he goes down to the
[50:33] riverside
[50:34] in a box car down by the river and says,
[50:38] "If I ever found heaven on earth,
[50:41] it was in a box car
[50:43] down by the river."
[50:46] Who is the rich man who had heaven on
[50:49] earth? It wasn't the one who had the
[50:50] house, the best house, or the palace.
[50:52] It's the one who knew how to make
[50:55] that building a home.
[50:58] And he says, "It's the order of it." In
[51:00] the sermon, Thirsting for Life, a church
[51:01] is what's on the inside of it. Really,
[51:04] that's what makes it up. We pass down
[51:06] the streets many times and we see a
[51:08] house and sometimes we say, "Isn't that
[51:11] a lovely home?"
[51:13] I remember one time we, one of our many
[51:15] road trips, we were driving somewhere
[51:17] out in the country and wow, we came
[51:18] across a beautiful
[51:20] estate. It was just out in the middle of
[51:22] the country. It had a lot of flat land
[51:24] and then just opened up to the forest
[51:26] and it was gorgeous. It was a beautiful,
[51:28] beautiful house. And Elizabeth said, "H,
[51:30] I'd love to live there." And and so for
[51:34] me, uh, I I so I just dropped her off
[51:36] and left and she called me later. No.
[51:40] Uh, and so I just said and I just
[51:43] thought in that moment or she I'd love
[51:44] to have the house. I'd love to live
[51:46] there. And I thought I just said, "Would
[51:48] you want the two divorces that came with
[51:49] it?
[51:51] She said, "Does it have to be two?" No.
[51:53] Uh, is it, "Do you want the two divorces
[51:55] that came with it? Do you want the
[51:57] mortgage? Do you want the two jobs? Do
[51:58] you want like we have no idea
[52:00] sometimes." And sometimes we say that in
[52:02] a good way. We see somebody blessed. We
[52:04] see someone successful. You need to
[52:05] remember you don't know what it costs
[52:06] for them to get there.
[52:07] And then there's sometimes you see
[52:09] someone blessed and someone successful
[52:10] and you realize that's not a blessing.
[52:12] This is a curse. They've sold their soul
[52:15] for this. They've lost their children
[52:16] for this. They've lost their wives for
[52:18] this. They've cheated. They stole for
[52:20] this. They don't even really own that,
[52:23] right? This is fraud.
[52:25] Do you want the 10-year federal sentence
[52:28] you get for the mortgage fraud you'd
[52:29] have to commit to live there?
[52:31] Right? There's so there's this idea of,
[52:33] "Well, man, you could have something
[52:35] that seems so great. Wow, what a lovely
[52:38] home." He says, "Now, it might look like
[52:41] a lovely house, but the home is an order
[52:44] of the house."
[52:46] You see the order that is in it, the
[52:48] order of the family
[52:56] because now it's I think it brings it
[52:57] out of the realm of okay, I got my
[52:59] structure now. I need the fune to be
[53:01] right in the inside right. I need the
[53:02] chairs to be here. I need the windows
[53:04] like this. Everything needs to be just
[53:05] right. But now it's he says it's the
[53:07] family. The order of the family.
[53:09] Yes. There has to be a token applied to
[53:11] our homes. There's things that need to
[53:12] be right in the things that populate it
[53:14] and the things that go in it and the
[53:15] things we entertain. But now there's got
[53:17] to be order in the family. I'll tell you
[53:19] right now, I say this uh uh very clearly
[53:22] many times the things of the world have
[53:25] entered in and we've allowed it because
[53:28] the family is not in order.
[53:31] Something's missing in the family
[53:32] arrangement, the family order. I think
[53:34] it just got practical.
[53:36] And in that we say, "Oh, well, I just
[53:38] need to I need to apply the token. and I
[53:40] need to get back to doing this, get back
[53:41] to that. Well, you can try, but as long
[53:43] as the family's not in order, it's
[53:45] always going to interrupt and interrupt
[53:46] and get back in those destructive
[53:48] patterns. The devil's always going to
[53:49] have a stronghold. You're like, "How
[53:51] does he get in here? How is he got in
[53:52] here? We keep trying to do this. We keep
[53:53] trying to do that. We train to do. How
[53:54] does he get in here?" It's because the
[53:55] family's not in order. It's
[53:57] not just trying to get all the
[53:58] appearances right and kicking everything
[54:00] out and get everything clean. It's got
[54:02] to be the order of the family is
[54:03] running. He says, "I think that's the I
[54:05] think that's where I think the house of
[54:07] God is." So, now he brings it to church.
[54:08] He's used the house, the family, now the
[54:11] church. It isn't much so much the
[54:13] beautiful temple, which we do
[54:15] appreciate.
[54:16] This beautiful temple. It's beautiful.
[54:20] Beautiful temple. He says, which we do
[54:22] appreciate, but it's the order that's on
[54:24] the inside of it.
[54:26] You know, that's how we were able to
[54:27] turn a Hilton garden into a church twice
[54:30] a week because it didn't matter the the
[54:32] edifice, the structure, the walls. It
[54:34] didn't matter the carpet or even what
[54:36] was done at the day before that there
[54:38] was an order that we could create. There
[54:39] was an honoring the Lord. There was a
[54:41] welcoming we could give to the Holy
[54:42] Spirit. And so I want you to catch the
[54:45] parallel or the connection of the home
[54:47] and the family to the church. Cuz
[54:48] brother Brandon's saying look at the
[54:50] family. Look at the home. Look at the
[54:51] house. Look how the family needs to be
[54:53] in order. And he says that's the same
[54:54] way a church has got to be. Right?
[54:57] So now he's using the ultimate to to
[54:59] guide us in the type which is the church
[55:01] to say that it's not so much the
[55:03] building but it's the way that we're
[55:04] arranged together.
[55:10] Brother Chris was it which was it we're
[55:12] going to preach for 30 minutes and then
[55:14] preach for another 30 minutes. Yeah.
[55:16] 30 minutes per half hour.
[55:17] Per Yeah.
[55:18] Per half hour. I'll do that. I can I can
[55:21] handle that because I'm going on my my
[55:24] turd in 30 minute here.
[55:28] I just
[55:35] order.
[55:40] It's the order of it. Brother Brandham's
[55:42] sermon life story says home is not the
[55:45] house.
[55:46] It's the order of the house that makes
[55:48] the home.
[55:50] That's what makes home.
[55:53] No matter if it's a shanty, whatever it
[55:55] is, if the order is right on the inside
[55:58] and godly, it's more of a home than if
[56:00] you had a palace somewhere.
[56:03] You catch what I'm saying about a house
[56:06] divided is no home. A home is not the
[56:09] house. It's the order of the house that
[56:11] makes the home.
[56:13] That's what makes the home. If the order
[56:16] is right on the inside and godly, let me
[56:18] piggyback off what he said before. It's
[56:20] the order of the family. It's got to
[56:21] begin too and the heads of the house,
[56:23] the mother and the father, the husband
[56:24] and wife. That's why you can have a
[56:27] house. I could say this to whether
[56:29] you're just a couple or you're you're
[56:31] married and have young children or older
[56:33] children or teenagers. No matter what it
[56:35] is, there has got to be a proper order
[56:39] in the relationship of those who are the
[56:42] household.
[56:43] An empty house is not a household. An
[56:45] empty house is not a family. The family
[56:46] is a house together. And there if
[56:49] there's not the proper arrangement in
[56:51] that dynamic, no matter how beautiful
[56:53] you can make the house in its uh
[56:55] furnishings, it'll never feel like home.
[56:59] And you say, "Oh, I think we just need
[57:01] this and I think we just need that." And
[57:02] maybe sometimes, whether it be the man
[57:04] or the woman, they'll chase after a lot
[57:06] of additions and a lot of changes within
[57:08] the house and the decorating and the
[57:10] arrangement, all those things. chasing
[57:12] that feeling of settle that chasing that
[57:14] feeling uh uh that makes this home and
[57:17] the solution is not in more square
[57:19] footage. The solution is not in another
[57:21] trip to IKEA. The solution is order in
[57:24] the family.
[57:28] Because if the order is right, it can be
[57:29] a shanty.
[57:31] He said, I'd rather live in a shanty and
[57:33] be happy than to live in a palace and be
[57:36] unhappy.
[57:38] And if you don't agree, you're
[57:41] anti-scripture.
[57:43] If you don't agree, you're antichrist.
[57:45] I'll just put it that way.
[57:48] Hey, how's that for uh clickbait?
[57:52] If you don't agree with this, not me,
[57:55] right? I mean, what is the the scripture
[57:56] affirms it? I would rather live on a
[57:58] rooftop and live in a corner than a
[58:01] palace in a woman that's like a constant
[58:03] dripping and complaining and nagging.
[58:06] Right? That's Bible, you know. Well,
[58:07] that that psalm almost has lived through
[58:10] some things, right? But we just this is
[58:12] affirming. This is it's better.
[58:15] It's better to live in a shanty and be
[58:18] happy than to be in a palace and
[58:19] unhappy. Can I get a witness?
[58:25] Brother Bam says in another place, many
[58:26] of you know what it is to be away from
[58:27] home, don't you? I say it's just a
[58:30] little shack, but it doesn't take a big
[58:33] house to make a home. It's the character
[58:37] on the inside that makes a home.
[58:40] And I'm thankful for a home.
[58:45] I'm thankful for a home.
[58:49] Amen.
[58:57] It's about the arrangement.
[59:01] says in Mark 3 27, "No man can enter
[59:04] into a strong man's house and spoil his
[59:05] goods except he will first bind."
[59:09] I hope you I hope you're with me to this
[59:11] point in
[59:14] what I'm wanting you to understand about
[59:16] a house, what it represents, what a
[59:19] divided house is,
[59:20] right?
[59:21] What a divided house brings. It divided
[59:23] against itself
[59:25] and what it brings. And then that if we
[59:28] kind of invert that what a house united
[59:31] is
[59:32] that in that uniting what it brings. And
[59:34] so now you realize there's a there's a
[59:35] certain thing that the devil knows he
[59:37] can attack.
[59:38] If I can attack the unity
[59:41] the rest may take care of itself.
[59:44] So no man can enter into strong man's
[59:46] house and spoil his goods except he will
[59:48] first bind the strong man and then he
[59:52] will spoil his house. Right
[59:55] now, I'm going to I'm going to make a
[59:56] statement here. Just try to summarize
[59:58] this in a way and then I need to skip
[59:59] some things. If you can bind whatever
[1:00:02] gives the house its power,
[1:00:05] you can carry it away.
[1:00:07] Right?
[1:00:08] You could take the thing that has made
[1:00:10] the house unassalable.
[1:00:12] If you take take the thing that protects
[1:00:14] it, take the thing that has uh uh helped
[1:00:16] it. You take the very thing that keeps
[1:00:19] you from being able to carry things
[1:00:20] away. If you can attack that and you can
[1:00:23] interrupt that, then you can have access
[1:00:25] to carry the house away, to spoil it, to
[1:00:28] take its goods, to take its wealth, to
[1:00:29] take its resources, just bind the strong
[1:00:32] men.
[1:00:33] And Jesus says, "I'm able to cast out
[1:00:35] devils because I'm able to bind Satan,
[1:00:38] the greatest to the least. I'm able to
[1:00:40] bind him. I'm able to bind Beelub. I'm
[1:00:42] able to bind the prince. I'm able I've
[1:00:45] entered into Satan's Eden, and I can
[1:00:47] bind Satan in his own Eden. Therefore,
[1:00:49] I've got power over every demon out of
[1:00:51] hell in his own house
[1:00:54] because I've broken the unity, the
[1:00:55] continuity. I've killed I've slain the
[1:00:57] head. I've slain the order. I've turned
[1:00:59] it upside down.
[1:01:01] So, it's the character.
[1:01:04] There's a certain strength of the house
[1:01:05] that if you attack it, it makes it
[1:01:07] vulnerable.
[1:01:12] A house divided against itself.
[1:01:15] Brother says in the sermon oneness
[1:01:18] he says any man in his family a correct
[1:01:21] good noble obedient family that's a lot
[1:01:23] there is one with another any family any
[1:01:27] family
[1:01:29] and so you he might say well are we only
[1:01:32] talking about those in Jeffersonville
[1:01:33] but and you say well he's talking about
[1:01:34] any family
[1:01:36] of a whether it be McGiri or Jenles
[1:01:40] whatever it might be there's a family
[1:01:42] and then we know that there's also a
[1:01:44] family of God a church family things. It
[1:01:46] has to be one with another.
[1:01:48] And if there's anything in the family
[1:01:50] that moves them apart, then it's not
[1:01:52] right.
[1:01:53] The family's broken somewhere.
[1:01:56] Notice any if it moves them apart
[1:02:00] now that
[1:02:02] in that I'm just trying to look here if
[1:02:04] I've got Oh, I'm not going to be able to
[1:02:06] get there. So,
[1:02:08] if it moves them apart, he says then the
[1:02:10] family's broken somewhere. And then he
[1:02:13] talks about how a family cannot be a
[1:02:16] family unless they're one. He says that
[1:02:19] the wise pulling one way and the husband
[1:02:20] another. He says that makes an awful
[1:02:22] family. But they've got to be an
[1:02:24] agreement.
[1:02:26] There's got to be a harmony.
[1:02:29] When you can, he says, "So they they
[1:02:31] should all be one. Father with mother,
[1:02:32] mother with father, children with
[1:02:33] parent, parent with children." Notice
[1:02:35] how it's kind of not this top down idea,
[1:02:37] but all of us mutually together in one,
[1:02:39] all in agreement. And when you see that,
[1:02:41] you'll see one lovely picture. That's
[1:02:44] God's purpose.
[1:02:46] Why? Because in the beginning, he's
[1:02:48] drawing it from the parable. In the
[1:02:49] beginning, that Adam and the woman were
[1:02:50] in harmony. This was God's masterpiece
[1:02:52] family. Here they were together. Because
[1:02:54] God's nature was in him. And God's
[1:02:56] nature is not combative against itself.
[1:02:58] God cannot fight against itself. He
[1:03:01] cannot fight against his word. It's this
[1:03:03] harmony, this continuity even his
[1:03:04] different characteristics. God's word
[1:03:07] never competes with any other part of
[1:03:08] his word. No manifestation of God will
[1:03:12] contradict another manifestation of God.
[1:03:14] That's because God's the only one that
[1:03:16] can do that.
[1:03:19] It's just something about God's nature
[1:03:20] and harmony the way he is.
[1:03:24] So, Brother Brandon says, if you don't
[1:03:27] mind, I'll just come back and read some
[1:03:28] of these. I I'll read some of these
[1:03:30] again maybe on Wednesday night. He says
[1:03:33] in the sermon, spiritual amnesia, we are
[1:03:34] identified with our families in this
[1:03:36] human life by marriage. So our families
[1:03:39] identify us. Uh that's true because you
[1:03:42] you I mean my my children have their
[1:03:44] last name because of
[1:03:47] who their parents are by union by
[1:03:49] marriage. You're identified by that
[1:03:51] union by marriage. He says with our
[1:03:52] wives we marry and our family is
[1:03:55] identified by the union of our marriage.
[1:04:00] That is a mouthful.
[1:04:03] The family takes on certain
[1:04:04] characteristics.
[1:04:06] The family paints a certain picture.
[1:04:08] Rever says, "You'll see a lovely
[1:04:09] picture." He says, "That's God's
[1:04:11] purpose." There's going to be something
[1:04:12] portrayed
[1:04:14] in the way the family is arranged, the
[1:04:17] union.
[1:04:19] And by union, I believe that we could
[1:04:20] say not just so much the legal union or
[1:04:22] the spiritual union or the fact that
[1:04:24] they are married, but how it operates,
[1:04:26] how it functions, how they work
[1:04:27] together, the order, the arrangement,
[1:04:29] the union is the weaving together. And
[1:04:31] some of the things I skipped would have
[1:04:32] brought that maybe in a little bit
[1:04:34] clearer picture. So, we'll just maybe
[1:04:35] back up and cover some of that on
[1:04:36] Wednesday. Uh, there's this weaving
[1:04:39] together of two individuals,
[1:04:44] but a dividing against itself is the
[1:04:47] upsetting of that harmony,
[1:04:48] right? the upsetting of that arrangement
[1:04:50] in order
[1:04:52] to where now it's not woven together,
[1:04:56] but it's kind of it's stacked on top of
[1:04:58] each other
[1:05:00] where one is greater, better, higher, or
[1:05:04] more spiritual than the other.
[1:05:12] And can I get real just for one second?
[1:05:17] one of the single greatest indicators of
[1:05:19] marital strife,
[1:05:21] separation,
[1:05:24] trouble, and I believe it's the single
[1:05:27] greatest indicator of divorce is
[1:05:30] contempt
[1:05:32] in any relationship.
[1:05:34] And so I'll just leave on a high note.
[1:05:40] Contempt is the belief that a person is
[1:05:43] beneath you.
[1:05:46] because they use lemon in their water
[1:05:48] and not lime,
[1:05:51] right?
[1:05:53] Contempt.
[1:05:54] Contempt is when the difference now
[1:05:56] rises to a level to where you look down
[1:05:58] on them.
[1:06:01] The belief that a person is beneath you.
[1:06:04] And because they're beneath you, they're
[1:06:05] worthless. And they deserve ridicule.
[1:06:07] They deserve scorn. They deserve abuse.
[1:06:10] And that contempt is what allows us to
[1:06:11] justify humiliating somebody,
[1:06:13] embarrassing somebody, hurting somebody,
[1:06:16] talking bad about them, airing their
[1:06:18] dirty laundry. Sometimes we even do it
[1:06:20] about you'll do it about your spouse or
[1:06:21] we'll do it about our spouse. Oh, he's
[1:06:23] dead beat. Oh, she does this, she does
[1:06:24] that. Why? Contempt.
[1:06:26] And you feel justified in running them
[1:06:28] down because you look down on them.
[1:06:32] You're not arranged together anymore.
[1:06:35] The order has been upset.
[1:06:39] A house divided.
[1:06:43] A house divided is no home.
[1:06:49] We ought to strive
[1:06:51] for God's order in our home life.
[1:06:54] Musicians, if you'd come,
[1:06:57] strive for it in our house. Strive for
[1:06:59] it
[1:07:01] in our church.
[1:07:05] Stand with me as we pray.
