[0:00] I am preaching an Easter Sermon this
[0:03] morning and by taking this text it may
[0:06] not seem very easterly or Resurrection
[0:09] or however you'd want to say that but I
[0:11] do want to come back to this uh maybe
[0:14] here at the beginning just to make a
[0:16] quick point and then hopefully return to
[0:17] it at the end and I will say that I'm
[0:21] laying a lot out there today that I hope
[0:24] to even maybe come back to on Wednesday
[0:26] night and so just as we explore this
[0:29] it's not just to say something about uh
[0:32] Resurrection Sunday or Easter Sunday for
[0:34] the purpose of honoring um the time or
[0:38] the holiday or satisfying those who came
[0:40] hoping to hear an Easter Sermon but we
[0:43] have just something in our hearts that
[0:44] we can just uh look at together and gain
[0:47] so much from my title is between death
[0:51] and life I know we had the phrase
[0:53] between life and death and maybe we
[0:55] always order it in a certain way where
[0:56] we see life and death but I I want to
[0:59] say it this way que death and life and
[1:02] kind of a subtitle The Mystery of the
[1:05] Tomb and I'm just going to visit the
[1:07] story of the Resurrection today going to
[1:09] take some time reading through the
[1:10] scriptures going through great detail I
[1:13] think it's good for us sometimes just to
[1:15] read the Bible together and look at the
[1:16] scriptures and maybe look at them
[1:18] collectively there are so many different
[1:21] instances in the gospels that refer to
[1:23] the events of the crucifixion and
[1:25] resurrection and the surrounding
[1:27] happenings and if you just read one
[1:30] uh I think you can take away the story
[1:32] you can get the gist of it but as you
[1:33] read all of them together and you start
[1:35] looking at them uh you realize there's
[1:37] certain things that are repeated there's
[1:38] certain themes that seem to have some
[1:40] emphasis and sometimes just a little bit
[1:42] different angle that can catch you to
[1:44] help you understand things in a broader
[1:46] way and if for all of you I know you all
[1:49] remember exactly what I preached a year
[1:51] ago on Easter on I think it was uh
[1:53] between hell and heaven and it was the
[1:56] mystery of Christ's Ascension and we
[1:58] looked at a lot of scriptures
[1:59] surrounding the events and uh I think I
[2:02] might just start a thing where every
[2:04] Easter I have mystery in my
[2:06] title there or between we have to use
[2:08] between and mystery and uh but I'm
[2:12] looking at some of the very same things
[2:13] but just a different aspect whereas
[2:15] before we kind of looked at after he had
[2:18] resurrected uh be from that uh time
[2:21] where he went to hell and before he went
[2:22] into heaven that moment in that time
[2:24] when he began to he saw Mary a and they
[2:27] had this interchange and he realized
[2:29] something's happen happening and
[2:30] something's taking place and as we
[2:31] looked into that we saw so many
[2:33] beautiful examples of the high priest
[2:35] and the sacrifice entering into heaven
[2:37] to be presented for God to accept it so
[2:39] there's just so much that we can draw
[2:41] from the scriptures and I will say it's
[2:43] going to be very simple but focus with
[2:46] me I don't want the Simplicity to lose
[2:48] you a little bit and um and for those
[2:51] who need complexity I'll weave some of
[2:54] that in there for those who look for it
[2:57] now if you'll uh I just I want to read a
[3:00] statement in the beginning uh from the
[3:02] sermon turn on the light I'm drawing a
[3:04] lot from these principles that he
[3:05] preaches brother BR preaches in this but
[3:07] I want to walk as I before I walk
[3:08] through these scriptures and we read a
[3:10] number of different places today and we
[3:12] pick up truths things that are factual
[3:15] things that are historical things that
[3:16] are real and very true about the
[3:18] crucifixion and the resurrection I want
[3:20] to do it to identify a promise for us
[3:22] not just to uh be able to pass a quiz if
[3:25] we had a quiz afterwards and say what
[3:27] day was he crucified and what hour did
[3:28] this happen and what happen next and get
[3:30] the chronology right but to see a
[3:32] promise for us and the promises are in
[3:35] the
[3:36] details that that God expresses
[3:39] something to us we know that the Bible
[3:40] is written by the Breath of God the
[3:43] scriptures are given by inspiration and
[3:44] so these things are written for our
[3:46] learning and things were written to
[3:48] teach us things and so I believe that if
[3:50] we can see Jesus Christ in every verse
[3:53] then there's things uh that are
[3:55] instructional to us in the in the
[3:57] details about the resurrection and
[4:00] brother brandom says it this way this is
[4:02] how I want to reinforce that with this
[4:04] God never speaks a word unless he's got
[4:06] a reason for speaking that word and as
[4:08] we believe the Bible is the written word
[4:10] of God I want to attach that same
[4:12] principle to it God would not have
[4:14] preserved this word and washed out over
[4:17] it if he did not have a reason for doing
[4:20] so said he's not like you and I that we
[4:22] just and then he says or especially
[4:24] myself and if he would say especially of
[4:27] himself i' I say especially especially
[4:29] of our ourselves that speak so many
[4:31] foolish things God so God's not like
[4:34] that God speaks every word with the
[4:38] meaning I think that has so much weight
[4:40] God speaks every word with the meaning
[4:42] and something that he's trying to
[4:44] achieve and will achieve by his word we
[4:48] can speak so many foolish things and
[4:50] sometimes we can be very sincere about
[4:51] the things we want to do but we're just
[4:53] trying to do it not necessarily will we
[4:55] do it but he's got something he wants to
[4:57] achieve and he will do so he says and it
[5:00] will perform exactly what he said it
[5:03] will
[5:03] do we know that in Christ God gives us
[5:07] all things and and therefore as we look
[5:11] at these scriptures we're wanting to see
[5:13] that God is speaking something for a
[5:15] reason and that there's this pattern
[5:17] that what God speaks if he ever gives a
[5:19] promise it's going to come to pass it
[5:21] will not fail and that he has something
[5:24] he's going to try to achieve and as he
[5:27] as Christ was part of that and part of
[5:29] the prophecy I want us to discover
[5:32] something about ourselves because in
[5:33] Christ we are given all things and it
[5:36] says in First Peter chapter 2 verse 21
[5:38] this is going to be kind of an important
[5:40] part uh just to Anchor in because I'm as
[5:43] we read the things about Christ I I want
[5:46] you to be able to think well what does
[5:47] this mean to me what does this mean to
[5:48] me for me and you perhaps should always
[5:51] be asking yourself that question
[5:52] whenever you come to church what does
[5:53] this mean for
[5:54] me but he says for even here unto we
[5:58] were ye called so we are called to this
[6:02] he says because Christ also suffered for
[6:05] us leaving us an example that you should
[6:08] follow in his
[6:09] steps now he's being very precise about
[6:13] we're going to be called to trials and
[6:14] testings and sufferings and we're going
[6:15] to have to stand and make our stand and
[6:17] we're going to have to endure uh because
[6:19] we've been called to that but he says as
[6:21] Christ was called to suffer and he
[6:25] suffered for us he left us an example
[6:28] that we should follow in his steps
[6:30] and thank God those steps just aren't
[6:33] limited to suffering that those steps
[6:35] are are also include the glory that came
[6:38] by the suffering and all the promises
[6:40] that were in him we are partakers in and
[6:42] Joint hirs in so in Christ his life and
[6:47] his the way that he lived and was born
[6:49] and lived and grew there's so much that
[6:51] we draw from his example specifically
[6:54] and precisely in many cases literally
[6:56] for us and so when we look at Christ
[6:59] today it's not just merely looking at it
[7:01] historically but maybe you could look at
[7:04] it if we could say in a mirror or some
[7:06] some foreshadowing or look to it to
[7:08] identify a promise for ourselves
[7:11] especially if we're talking about a
[7:12] resurrection we're talking about
[7:14] Redemption there's things that we could
[7:15] look at for ourselves so the the subject
[7:19] is
[7:20] between the death of Christ and his life
[7:24] after death between death and life so
[7:27] we're looking at between the death of
[7:29] Christ and his life after death and we
[7:32] could say this way in between that was a
[7:35] resurrection that's that's what is there
[7:38] in in between death and life now I
[7:43] wrestled at at what point to put this
[7:45] and if it seems to be a little bit out
[7:46] of place and and unnecessary hold to it
[7:50] a little bit because there's a principle
[7:51] I'm sharing here in more uh more of an
[7:56] academic sense as a way of helping us
[7:59] understand something something
[7:59] spiritually and I want to maybe
[8:02] introduce or remind many of you of what
[8:04] of of a black box and we're not talking
[8:06] about in aviation uh brother John that
[8:08] wasn't you that had the emergency
[8:10] landing the flight out of Phoenix or
[8:12] coming to Phoenix okay saw a headline
[8:13] out about of Southwest Airlines flight
[8:15] that hadn't Tak an emergency landing I
[8:17] was like no brother John would have made
[8:18] it he would have made it all the way
[8:22] man but so this is a black box not in
[8:25] reference to Aviation but it's uh when I
[8:29] refer to a blackbox we're talking about
[8:32] a complex model that is not easily
[8:36] interpreted and so that's why so the
[8:39] phrase blackbox it's like it's you you
[8:41] can see what's on the outside but it's
[8:43] not easy to understand what's on the
[8:45] inside uh so it's some sort of complex
[8:48] model or system that you can't quite
[8:50] explain that you're you're not able to
[8:52] interpret it easily or it's not easily
[8:54] understood or maybe I could put it this
[8:55] way it's just not
[8:57] straightforward and I'm finding that
[8:59] it's starting to come up a little bit
[9:00] more with respect to AI because you know
[9:03] they've developed things and they feeded
[9:05] information and they get results and
[9:07] there's this black box with artificial
[9:09] intelligence where you don't know what's
[9:10] happening behind the curtain a a and
[9:13] that's what we there so you know things
[9:15] are going in you know things are coming
[9:16] out but there's this mystery as it were
[9:18] in terms of how does it come up with
[9:21] this and so a black box is a system
[9:24] which can be viewed solely in terms of
[9:26] its inputs and outputs without any
[9:29] knowledge of how it works internally so
[9:32] you see something go in you see
[9:33] something come out and you know it
[9:35] solely by what's going in and what's
[9:37] coming out but you don't know much about
[9:39] what's happening on in the inside and so
[9:42] it's a phrase for the scientists here
[9:44] the coders uh those in Computing and
[9:46] Engineering I think this is a phrase
[9:48] that's not
[9:50] foreign or is it okay I'm getting we
[9:53] we've resorted to sign language now and
[9:57] there you go all right
[10:01] so in engineering it would be an
[10:02] operation that acts as a part of a
[10:04] mechanism without any clear indication
[10:06] of How It's Working you know it works
[10:09] you get results but you're not sure how
[10:12] and if you just look at it that way you
[10:13] realize man my life's full of black
[10:14] boxes you know I just do this and it
[10:16] works and it it works all the time and
[10:19] uh I think like our kids you know they
[10:21] just think the refrigerator is a black
[10:22] box you know I I put an empty gallon of
[10:24] milk in it and there's a full gallon in
[10:26] the morning how does this happen but in
[10:29] other words the inner workings of the
[10:31] Box we use that phrase a black box the
[10:33] inner workings are not seen yet the
[10:35] results or the output can be observed
[10:37] you're not observing what's happening
[10:39] but you're observing what takes place
[10:40] that so the the uh concept again of a
[10:43] black box is you're making observations
[10:46] of different states maybe a stimulus or
[10:48] some sort of condition what something is
[10:50] before and what happens afterwards and
[10:53] so the results are observed I want you
[10:56] to kind of hold that in your mind the
[10:57] results are observed but the process
[11:00] that achieved the results is hidden or
[11:03] not understood or uh not easy to explain
[11:06] some of examples would be maybe the
[11:08] search engines you put in a term and you
[11:11] get the results and so you put in some
[11:13] data uh gave some sort of prompt and you
[11:16] get some results but you don't see the
[11:18] the web crawlers you don't see the
[11:20] algorithm that's working in the
[11:21] background algorithm would be a really
[11:22] good one where there's output and you
[11:25] get something but you don't know what's
[11:27] behind the scenes in the black box
[11:30] that's determining why you're getting
[11:32] the information that you're getting they
[11:34] even refer to the human brain as a black
[11:36] box and it's uh or maybe a brick for
[11:39] some people but it's uh it it they they
[11:42] can identify processes but they're not
[11:44] sure exactly why it's working the way
[11:46] that it does maybe in a more Elementary
[11:49] terms a lock is a black box where uh um
[11:51] you can see what happens the results a
[11:53] door handle they consider uh even could
[11:55] be seen as a black box and children
[11:57] sometimes that's that's what life is is
[11:59] all about is Uh something's they see
[12:02] something happens if I do this it gets
[12:03] this result but yet there's not an
[12:05] understanding of what's happening in the
[12:08] Unseen and now with that and just to be
[12:11] able to grab everybody back on the same
[12:13] page so it's we're not just getting
[12:15] academic with this Jesus in Matthew
[12:17] chapter 6 this is kind of like a black
[12:20] box as he's saying that there's people
[12:23] who are um outwardly praying and giving
[12:26] alms openly and wanting everyone to see
[12:28] what they're doing in Jesus is saying
[12:29] don't do like everyone else does but uh
[12:33] when you and then he says when giving
[12:34] alms don't do it publicly and then he
[12:36] says when it comes to praying don't pray
[12:39] openly and loudly and boisterously and
[12:42] broadcasting so that everyone can see
[12:44] you but he says when you pray enter into
[12:47] your
[12:48] closet and shut the
[12:50] door and so you the world sees you and
[12:55] now the the let's say then it doesn't
[12:57] because you're hidden in this place and
[12:59] then he says your father will reward you
[13:02] openly so there's something that happens
[13:04] in secret that produces a result that is
[13:08] going to be open and it's not
[13:11] necessarily explainable what's taking
[13:13] place in that closet what takes place
[13:15] from the time that you enter to the time
[13:18] that you're rewarded that that period of
[13:20] time isn't always easy to explain but
[13:23] you could say it
[13:26] happened all right I feel good
[13:30] now it's called a black box in this
[13:31] sense that it's uh opaque in other words
[13:34] it's light can't get through to it it's
[13:37] impervious to the Rays of light and if
[13:39] something's opaque in not a non-literal
[13:42] sense not talking about color it's not
[13:44] able to be understood it's not seen so
[13:47] the Black Box it refers to not the box
[13:50] but what can't be seen on the inside
[13:53] what's not understood so if I could say
[13:55] this the Box holds a
[13:57] mystery you see what go in you can see
[14:00] what comes out but the inner workings
[14:02] are hidden they're
[14:03] secret so this is my title if I could
[14:06] put it this way and apply it to the
[14:09] Resurrection The Mystery between death
[14:12] and
[14:14] life the between death and life The
[14:16] Mystery of the Tomb Christ is seen
[14:18] entering the tomb dead but then Christ
[14:22] is seen
[14:23] alive and so this is the mystery between
[14:27] death and life
[14:29] now let's just look at the scriptures
[14:32] scripturally the death of Jesus Christ
[14:35] is not a
[14:36] mystery in other words the Bible sets
[14:39] forth very clearly uh that he died and
[14:42] so there's a record that he dies now
[14:44] some can dispute whether or not he lived
[14:46] some could dispute uh whether or not he
[14:48] was who he uh who he was purported to be
[14:51] if he did exist but let's just look at
[14:53] the record that says he died on Ma in
[14:55] Matthew CH 27: 50 says Jesus when he had
[14:59] cried again with a loud voice yielded up
[15:01] the ghost we realize that his death was
[15:04] by crucifixion at the hands of the
[15:06] Romans at the request of the Jews and we
[15:08] could read a lot of different scriptures
[15:09] to show how Herod and pilate uh um are
[15:13] working together and at the request of
[15:15] the Jews let his blood be on our hands
[15:17] is what the Jews said but then it's by
[15:19] the Roman government that puts them to
[15:21] death under capital punishment and as
[15:24] he's hanging there upon the cross he
[15:26] cries with a loud voice it says he
[15:28] yielded up the ghost that means he
[15:31] died Matthew 15 excuse me Mark 15:37
[15:34] Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave
[15:36] up The Ghost and Luke it says and Jesus
[15:38] cried with a loud voice father into thy
[15:40] hands I commend my spirit and having
[15:43] said thus he gave up the ghost this is
[15:46] this is the moment where he dies he says
[15:49] in John chapter 19: 28 to 33 it says
[15:53] after this Jesus knowing that all things
[15:55] were now accomplished that the scripture
[15:57] might be fulfilled say I thirst now
[16:01] there was set a vessel full of vinegar
[16:03] and they filled a sponge with vinegar
[16:04] and put it upon hisp and put it to his
[16:06] mouth when Jesus therefore had received
[16:08] the vinegar he said it is finished now
[16:12] these things are happening so that
[16:13] scripture is fulfilled says and he bowed
[16:15] his head and gave up the ghost father
[16:18] into your hands I commend my spirit it's
[16:20] finished and he
[16:22] dies then it says the Jews therefore
[16:24] because it was the preparation that the
[16:26] body should not remain upon the cross on
[16:27] the Sabbath day for the Sabbath day was
[16:29] in high day besought pilate that their
[16:32] legs might be broken and that they might
[16:34] be taken away this was to ensure that
[16:36] they would die they they would expire uh
[16:38] more quickly and this you can go back to
[16:41] Deuteronomy and find where this has its
[16:43] roots in the law uh it's funny just how
[16:46] some things they can be real sticklers
[16:48] about meanwhile an innocent man is dying
[16:50] on the
[16:51] cross uh and and they besought pilot
[16:54] their legs be broken so they kind of
[16:56] haste in their death verse 32 then came
[16:58] soldiers and break the legs of the first
[17:00] and of the others which were crucified
[17:01] with them but when they came to Jesus
[17:04] and saw that he was dead already they
[17:06] break not his legs they do say that they
[17:09] thrust a a spear spear in his side and
[17:12] there's no audible groaning there's
[17:14] nothing as the the water and blood pours
[17:16] forth from him and here we can see that
[17:19] the Bible says that Jesus died now it's
[17:21] even witnessed of the soldiers they come
[17:23] to Jesus and they see that he was dead
[17:25] already therefore they don't break his
[17:27] legs that the scripture might be
[17:29] fulfilled not a bone of his was broken
[17:31] this is the record of the observed state
[17:34] of death that Christ is dead we see this
[17:37] moment in time on this on this
[17:40] crucifixion day on that Friday where
[17:42] Christ has been crucified and he is dead
[17:47] now let's skip forward a little bit and
[17:48] let's look at the scriptures that tell
[17:50] us show us Jesus's life after death and
[17:53] you'll see that his living after dying
[17:56] is not a mystery in other words there
[17:57] may be some that dispute whether or not
[17:59] he lived or whether or not he was even a
[18:01] real person but as far as the Bible's
[18:03] concerned there's its details clearly
[18:06] that he was alive after death and so
[18:09] there's a a great record about him
[18:11] living after he was dead and there are
[18:15] multiple Witnesses of him after he was
[18:17] crucified in Mark chapter 16 he's seen
[18:20] by Mary Magdalene in Matthew 28 he's
[18:22] seen of Mary Luke 24 on the road toas
[18:25] two disciples walk with him and their
[18:28] eyes are open and they knew him and then
[18:30] later in that very chapter he appears in
[18:32] the midst of his disciples he shows his
[18:34] hands and his feet he even sits and eats
[18:36] with them in John chapter 20 it recounts
[18:39] some of these other ones we've already
[18:40] mentioned but then he appears twice to
[18:42] his disciples uh first time Thomas isn't
[18:45] present the second time now Thomas is
[18:47] present and each time these are
[18:49] witnesses of him alive after
[18:53] death in John 21 he appears to the
[18:56] disciples on the sea of tiberias we see
[18:58] it in in Matthew 28 and Mark 16 and acts
[19:01] one he's before his Ascension he's
[19:03] appearing he's uh he's eating he's
[19:06] teaching he's giving them instructions
[19:09] these are all these instances and we'll
[19:11] keep uh coming back to some other places
[19:12] in the scripture because as we mentioned
[19:15] before God doesn't speak something
[19:16] unless he has a reason and there's so
[19:19] many instances of Christ uh report
[19:22] reporting in Christ after he was dead
[19:25] showing that he's clearly alive and Paul
[19:28] even WR writes it this way in 1
[19:29] Corinthians chapter
[19:31] 15: 3 to8 for I delivered unto you first
[19:35] of all that which I also received how
[19:37] that Christ died for our sins according
[19:40] to the scripture so his death again now
[19:42] being recorded in the New Testament by
[19:44] Paul and that he was buried and that he
[19:46] rose again the third day according to
[19:49] the
[19:50] scriptures a so there's his death burial
[19:53] and now he says and that and then now
[19:56] his resurrection and it's not just oh he
[19:58] resurrected but here's the record of it
[20:00] here's the
[20:01] observation and that he was seen of
[20:04] sephus which is Peter then of the 12
[20:07] after that he was seen above 500
[20:09] Brethren at once of whom the greater
[20:11] part remain of this present but some are
[20:13] fallen asleep so Paul is saying there's
[20:15] living Witnesses of this above 500 that
[20:19] he appeared to not just Peter and the
[20:21] other disciples there's over 500 that he
[20:24] appeared to uh and there's some that are
[20:27] still alive giving Witness some have
[20:29] died but some are giving witness still
[20:31] says and after that he was seen of James
[20:33] then all of the Apostles here's witness
[20:36] after witness after witness that Christ
[20:38] was there was life after death and then
[20:42] he says and last of all and this is the
[20:43] one that's real real neat to dig into
[20:46] last of all he was seen of me also as of
[20:48] one born out of due
[20:50] time these are
[20:53] witnesses of Christ being alive in other
[20:56] words this is the record of the obser
[20:58] oberved state of Life the Bible records
[21:02] this observed state of death that he was
[21:04] dead and then there it records that he
[21:08] is living so details in the scripture
[21:12] this recorded observed state after
[21:15] death well if I can say it this way it
[21:18] records him being dead and alive but
[21:21] then the Bible also records his state
[21:24] after death and before life and it tells
[21:27] us he's buried in a tomb so let's
[21:30] examine the record of him being buried
[21:33] in a
[21:35] tomb and Matthew chap 27:
[21:41] 57-60 this is the the the time of his
[21:46] crucifixion and when the evening was
[21:48] come there came a rich man of arthea
[21:50] named Joseph who also himself was
[21:53] Jesus's disciple he went to pilate and
[21:56] begged the body of Jesus I believe in
[21:58] another place it says he craved the body
[21:59] of Jesus he begged the body of Jesus
[22:02] then pilate commanded the body to be
[22:05] delivered now we're we're just wanting
[22:08] we're wanting to read the scriptures to
[22:09] find out what's happened we haven't
[22:11] gotten into the details of his scourging
[22:13] and his beatings and him being nailed to
[22:15] the
[22:16] cross and but we we've looked at him
[22:19] dying on the cross and him just quickly
[22:22] looked at scriptures how he's living
[22:23] after death but now let's just look at
[22:25] the details God doesn't speak something
[22:27] unless he's got a reason
[22:29] and it says that pilate commanded the
[22:31] body to be delivered and Joseph had
[22:33] taken the body when he had taken the
[22:36] body he wrapped it in a clean linen
[22:38] cloth and laid it in his own new tomb
[22:41] which he had heun out in the Rock and he
[22:44] rolled a great Stone to the door of the
[22:46] Seiler and departed so the the terms
[22:49] tomb and Seiler interchangeable in these
[22:52] readings that there it is like a a a
[22:55] hillside a cave as it were a great Rock
[22:58] and in this rock is heun out a place uh
[23:01] for burial and it tells us it's a new
[23:04] Tomb not an old one because there would
[23:07] be Graves where there'd be multiple
[23:08] bodies buried therein and not just one
[23:11] so it's one us to know that this is a
[23:12] new Tomb in that nobody else lays there
[23:14] there's nobody else buried there Joseph
[23:17] takes the body wraps it in clean linen
[23:19] cloth and it puts it in a a uh a cave
[23:24] heun out of a rock a room he out of a
[23:26] rock a place of burial then he rolls a
[23:28] great Stone in front of the door and
[23:31] then he departs it's told this way in
[23:34] Mark chapter 15 and pilate marveled if
[23:36] he were already dead and calling unto
[23:38] him the Centurion he asked him whether
[23:40] he had been dead whether he had been any
[23:43] while dead now this is Joseph comes to
[23:45] him and craves the body and pilate's
[23:47] like wait he's already dead and so
[23:50] here's another affirmation that Christ
[23:52] is dead he marveled that he was already
[23:54] dead he expired so quickly so he asked
[23:57] the Centurion and when he knew if of the
[24:00] Centurion in other words the Centurion
[24:02] confirms yes Jesus is dead he gave the
[24:06] body to Joseph and he and so there's
[24:09] that again a record of death and he
[24:12] bought fine linen and took him down and
[24:14] wrapped him in the linen and laid him in
[24:17] a Seer which was Hune out of a rock and
[24:21] rolled a stone under the door of the
[24:22] supper and Mary Magdalene and Mary the
[24:25] Mother Jesus uh uh beheld
[24:29] where he was
[24:31] laid so that's telling us again here's
[24:34] Witnesses Mary Magdalene Mary uh the
[24:37] mother of Jesus behold where Christ is
[24:40] laid and there's certain things we could
[24:43] say here a lot of things maybe I just
[24:45] going back over this past week and
[24:47] enjoying it but the the the idea that
[24:50] where he was laid was a place he out of
[24:52] a rock that he's wrapped in this
[24:56] linen that now Mary the two Marys are
[24:59] observing him de place so these details
[25:01] are important and I believe that God
[25:04] records these details so that we can
[25:07] understand uh the condition of Christ
[25:10] when he enters and even where he's
[25:13] entering and to remove remove any
[25:15] confusion I I I want to say that because
[25:17] the verse I'm about to read where
[25:19] there's maybe a lot of objections that
[25:21] could be offered that if you take Christ
[25:23] and you put him in a graveyard and all
[25:25] of a sudden you see a body walking out
[25:26] of the graveyard someone say Well that's
[25:28] not Jesus that's Tom right that that's
[25:31] not who you're purporting it to be it's
[25:33] somebody else cuz there was so many
[25:34] bodies there there's so many people
[25:36] laying there in John chapter 19: 41 and
[25:39] 42 it says now in the place where he was
[25:41] crucified there was a garden isin't that
[25:45] remarkable that where the place he dies
[25:47] there's a Garden nearby in the same
[25:49] tract of land to where they're
[25:51] Associated together in the same place
[25:53] there's a garden and there's a place of
[25:54] death and it brings us all the way back
[25:56] to the Garden where death entered
[25:59] and so here where he's dying nearby
[26:02] there is a garden this Garden in this
[26:04] Garden is a new Seer wherein was never
[26:08] man yet
[26:10] laid in other words no dead man has ever
[26:12] been in this place it seems to be the
[26:15] case with Christ where the Bible says he
[26:17] was separate from Sinners that God is
[26:19] wanting Christ to be distinct Jesus told
[26:22] his disciples to go find the foul of an
[26:24] ass that has never yet been ridden on by
[26:26] man and Christ was the first one to ride
[26:29] that colt into uh the city and here he
[26:33] is going to be the first one to be laid
[26:36] in a grave heun out of a
[26:39] rock therein no man has ever yet been
[26:43] laid it leaves no room
[26:46] for the speculation that it could have
[26:48] been another body that came
[26:50] out or that it wasn't Christ who
[26:53] Rose in verse 42 there laid they Jesus
[26:57] therefore because the the Jews
[26:58] preparation day for the Seiler was nigh
[27:02] at
[27:03] hand if I could say this I I I put forth
[27:07] scripturally there could be no question
[27:08] that Christ was dead when he entered the
[27:13] tomb and we read in Matthew chap 27:
[27:18] 62-66 in reading this it helps us to
[27:21] understand
[27:23] why this tomb was empty and no man had
[27:26] ever laid in it the only Bon that would
[27:28] be in the only body that would be in
[27:29] there the only supposed bones would be
[27:31] that of Christ wrapped in linen Bound by
[27:34] new linen Fresh
[27:36] Linen and it says in Matthew 27:
[27:39] 62-66 now the next day that followed the
[27:42] day of preparation that's where we left
[27:43] off in John 19 the chief priest and
[27:46] Pharisees came together un pilate saying
[27:49] sir we remember that that deceiver said
[27:53] while he was yet alive I mean he's dead
[27:55] there's still name calling that that
[27:58] deceiver while he was yet alive after 3
[28:01] days I will rise again now what stands
[28:03] out to me is the fact that they
[28:05] remembered but the disciples
[28:07] didn't amazing how much the critics the
[28:10] dece they'll remember the words of a
[28:11] deceiver better than the faithful
[28:13] followers of Christ he says we remember
[28:16] that that deceiver said while he was yet
[28:18] alive after three days I'll rise again
[28:20] command therefore that the supper be
[28:22] made sure until the third day lest his
[28:25] disciples come by night and steal him
[28:27] away and and say unto the people he has
[28:29] risen from the dead so the last Heir
[28:32] shall be worse than the first they're
[28:35] they're thinking about this they're
[28:37] realizing that Jesus had said that I
[28:39] will rise in three days and now how they
[28:41] figured that out and how they picked up
[28:43] on that and the deci and it registered
[28:45] their head and it didn't to the
[28:46] disciples is something to be remarked on
[28:48] but they're saying kind of in a
[28:50] proactive way you know it would be it's
[28:53] one thing for him to die but it would be
[28:56] worse it would be worse for him to be a
[28:58] martyr and worse than having crucified
[29:01] him if somehow they're able to spend
[29:03] this tail by stealing the body of Christ
[29:06] and being able to say oh he's risen he's
[29:10] risen so this is them them wanting to be
[29:13] proactive about this body and I I I love
[29:17] it in this way it's ensured that this
[29:20] body was not going to leave at the hands
[29:23] of men it says pilate said unto them ye
[29:26] have a watch go your way make it as sure
[29:29] as you can and trust me if these that
[29:33] thought Christ was a deceiver had
[29:35] latched onto this idea that his
[29:37] disciples would steal the body in three
[29:39] days they were going to watch it and be
[29:42] sure that the disciples did not steal
[29:44] the body so it says so they went and
[29:47] made the supper sure sealing the stone
[29:51] and setting a
[29:53] watch we've already looked at Christ
[29:55] dead on the cross we've looked at Christ
[29:57] alive afterwards so the mystery is not
[30:00] in his death the mystery is not in his
[30:02] being alive
[30:03] later and we've walked with through
[30:06] these scriptures to see that now Christ
[30:08] has been wrapped in Linen in a grave in
[30:11] which no other man lies a rock that's
[30:14] been heun out in a place for his body
[30:17] and now the tomb is
[30:19] sealed Christ's dead body wrapped in
[30:22] linen is hidden
[30:25] inside and it's not just sealed it's
[30:28] under
[30:28] watch and The Observers are there to
[30:31] guard against theft they're there to
[30:34] guard against the stone being rolled
[30:36] away and they're there to be a witness
[30:39] of what may happen because they want to
[30:42] be able to testify if there's a war if
[30:44] there's a battle if there's a struggle
[30:45] over the stone and the stone is rolling
[30:47] away and the disciples steal the body
[30:49] they they want men to be alive to be
[30:50] able to say he didn't raise again he was
[30:53] stolen we witnessed it this is what
[30:55] happened so there is an effort by the
[30:58] natural men in that day to be sure that
[31:00] the body remains
[31:02] there in this sealed
[31:06] State then on in Matthew chapter 28
[31:10] veres 1 to7 I'd like to ask the query
[31:13] you're just individually are you
[31:15] comfortable this morning is it is the
[31:16] pace okay are you I know you're not
[31:18] learning anything but it's just good to
[31:20] look at these things together like I
[31:21] said very very
[31:24] simple in Matthew chapter 28: 1-7
[31:28] in the end of the Sabbath as it began to
[31:31] Dawn toward the first day of the
[31:35] week Came Mary Magdalene and the other
[31:37] Mary to see the
[31:39] Seiler and behold there was a great
[31:43] earthquake for the angel Lord descended
[31:45] from heaven and came and rolled back the
[31:48] Stone from the door and sat upon
[31:53] it uh what happened this is this is the
[31:57] most detailed we get at this moment
[31:59] there's a great earthquake the angel
[32:01] Lord descends from heaven and comes and
[32:04] rolls the Stone from the door and sits
[32:06] on it his countenance was like lightning
[32:08] and his rainment white as snow and for
[32:11] fear of him the keepers did shake and
[32:13] became as dead
[32:15] men this is the the keepers those that
[32:18] set watch those that would have sealed
[32:20] it made it as sure as they can now they
[32:22] are shocked because they haven't fought
[32:25] with anyone externally that there was
[32:27] nothing nothing to be observed on the
[32:29] outside say I I hear them coming oh
[32:31] that's Peter if I've ever heard of Peter
[32:32] here they come they're going to wrestle
[32:34] with us for the body all of a sudden
[32:36] there's an earthquake and there's an
[32:38] angel sitting on the stone and the stone
[32:40] is rolled
[32:41] away and the angel answered and said
[32:44] unto the
[32:46] women and and now this is to this spoken
[32:49] to the women fear not ye for I know that
[32:52] you seek Jesus which was
[32:54] crucified I I I know why you've come and
[32:57] I I think we're going to be reading a
[32:58] few places where they were coming to
[33:01] anoint the body to give it the according
[33:03] to their ceremonial way of treatment of
[33:05] the dead and he says this he is not here
[33:09] for He Is
[33:11] Risen as he said come see the place
[33:15] where the Lord
[33:17] lay in other words come see for yourself
[33:21] I know you're coming to see Jesus who
[33:23] was dead but he's not here and he's not
[33:27] dead He's Alive
[33:28] come see where the Lord lay and he says
[33:30] and go quickly and tell his disciples
[33:34] that he is risen from the dead and
[33:37] behold he goeth before you into Galilee
[33:41] there shall you see him lo I have told
[33:43] you so here's the angel of Lord sent it
[33:46] upon a stone there's different readings
[33:47] that kind of take you through a little
[33:49] bit Fuller picture of different things
[33:51] that are happening but behold there's an
[33:53] earthquake Christ is dead Joseph takes
[33:56] the body wraps it in linen brings him
[33:59] into the tomb rolls the the stone over
[34:01] it Mary and Mary are witnessing this uh
[34:04] the those that thought he was a deceiver
[34:07] go tell pilate look I'm sure as we're
[34:10] standing here they're going to try to
[34:11] steal the body so let's seal the tomb
[34:13] make it ass sure as we can and set watch
[34:15] and we're waiting now and the next thing
[34:17] we hear is there's an earthquake and an
[34:19] angel Lord descends the stone is rolled
[34:21] away and he sits upon the
[34:24] stone and those coming to see Jesus
[34:28] he says' I know you've come to find the
[34:29] body of Christ but the body's not in
[34:32] here see for yourselves and it says he's
[34:34] risen from the dead he goes before you
[34:38] and you'll see him
[34:39] alive what
[34:41] happened this is as close as we
[34:45] get and as I want to use this image the
[34:48] tomb acts as a black
[34:52] bux we we only hear that there's an
[34:55] earthquake we now see that there's an
[34:57] angel that can be seen of the those that
[34:59] keep were keeping watch and the keepers
[35:01] in the garden we we see that the the the
[35:03] women that came to the tomb early can
[35:05] see him but it the tomb has hidden
[35:08] what's happened Christ went in dead now
[35:10] he's going before them alive it there's
[35:12] something that's happened in this tomb
[35:15] in Luke 24: 2 and 3 and they found the
[35:18] stone rolled away from the supper and
[35:20] they entered in and found not the body
[35:23] of the Lord Jesus so the body's not
[35:26] there IM mark chapter 16 veres 4 5 and 6
[35:30] and when they looked they saw that the
[35:32] stone was rolled away for it was very
[35:36] great and I maybe I don't have it here
[35:39] but there's one place where the women
[35:40] are surmising to themselves what are we
[35:42] going to do about the stone how are we
[35:44] going to get it open especially see as
[35:45] maybe they had heard through the
[35:46] grapevine that there were set watch
[35:48] they' sealed it and they made it sure as
[35:50] could be maybe they're thinking there's
[35:52] no way we're getting that open they've
[35:53] gummed it up and they've blocked it up
[35:55] and theyve watching over it we're not
[35:57] going to be able to get it open but the
[35:58] Bible's telling us they found the stone
[36:00] open they enter in and they don't see
[36:02] the body in Mark 16 and when they looked
[36:04] they saw the stone was rolled away for
[36:06] it was very great and entering into the
[36:08] Seer they saw a young man sitting on the
[36:10] right side clothed in a long white
[36:13] garment and they were arried that's a
[36:15] new word for us to use afed and he saith
[36:18] unto them be not afed ye seek Jesus of
[36:21] Nazareth which was crucified you seek
[36:24] Jesus which was dead he is
[36:28] risen he is not here behold the place
[36:33] where they laid
[36:35] him this is now uh um there's some
[36:38] observations taking place Christ was
[36:40] dead he entered in he was wrapped in
[36:41] linen he laid there these women can say
[36:43] we saw it he was wrapped tightly in
[36:46] these new linens he was laid there in
[36:47] this tomb the tomb the stone was rolled
[36:49] in front of the door but now the stone
[36:52] is rolled away this great Stone there's
[36:53] an angel in there he's saying don't be
[36:56] afraid Jesus which is dead is risen he's
[36:58] not here look the body is not
[37:01] here John 20: 3-7 Peter therefore went
[37:06] forth and the other disciple now they've
[37:07] gone and that Peter and John are
[37:08] returning and came to the suppiler so
[37:12] they ran both together and the other
[37:15] disciple did outrun Peter John's just
[37:17] being
[37:18] humble and came first to the supper and
[37:22] he stooping down and looking in saw the
[37:26] linen clothes lying yet went he not in
[37:29] so John could just look in and see the
[37:32] linen clothes so the very Linens that
[37:34] were wrapped around his body have come
[37:37] off and then then cometh Simon Peter
[37:40] following him and went into the Seiler
[37:43] and seeth the linen clothes lie now he's
[37:45] entering all the way in he's not
[37:48] stopping
[37:49] short he's not just peeking he wants to
[37:52] go in and he wants to examine it he
[37:54] wants to look he wants to be sure did
[37:56] you go all the way in did you search
[37:58] around is there any evidence that he may
[38:00] still be in in there is there is there
[38:02] Foul Play suspected what is it he says
[38:05] he seeth the linen clothes lie in the
[38:08] napkin that was about his head not lying
[38:10] with the linen clothes but wrapped
[38:12] together in a place by
[38:15] itself this is these are very intriguing
[38:17] details and I know you're all anxiously
[38:20] awaiting the mystery of the the linen
[38:22] cloth next year and there's between the
[38:28] lens uh the mystery of the cloth there's
[38:32] uh write that down in case I
[38:34] forget but there's these details are
[38:37] very interesting they're peculiar to
[38:39] think what what's happening now if I
[38:42] could just call back to the time in the
[38:44] resurrection of Lazarus when he's
[38:46] resurrected they rolled away the stone
[38:49] and they they they had to be taught
[38:51] loose him and let him go so though we we
[38:54] don't understand so much what took place
[38:56] but we do realize that there was some
[38:58] human means to open the stone there was
[39:00] some human means to unwrapping uh uh
[39:03] Lazarus but now this resurrection of
[39:05] Christ all this goes
[39:07] unobserved even how the stone was rolled
[39:10] away what was it the earthquake who did
[39:12] it but now the the Linens have been
[39:14] unwrapped the cloth is folded neatly
[39:16] together everything is very tidy and
[39:17] very neat placed
[39:20] together and if I could say this about
[39:22] the women if I could say this about John
[39:24] and Peter they're all looking into the
[39:27] tomb they're looking into the black
[39:29] box uh they're they're trying to figure
[39:32] out what happened but the only thing
[39:34] they could come up with is that he's not
[39:37] there I I see the linen clothes that
[39:40] were wrapped around him I see the napkin
[39:42] that was about his his head I I I see
[39:45] everything that was on him when he went
[39:46] in I saw him die on the cross I saw his
[39:49] body taken down I saw him wrapped in
[39:51] Linens I saw him laid in the Tomb I saw
[39:54] the napkin laid over him but now when I
[39:56] look I see it all neatly folded together
[39:59] that napkin lies there nothing's out of
[40:01] place nothing hurried nothing's torn
[40:03] apart but and I know he's not there
[40:07] anymore if I could say this the mystery
[40:10] is not in that he died and the Mystery
[40:14] was not in that he was living but the
[40:16] mystery laid somewhere in the
[40:19] middle in between his death and life
[40:22] after death this is what could was not
[40:26] observed this is what's not recorded if
[40:28] you think about all the details of the
[40:31] things that are recorded here in down to
[40:33] uh Joseph arthia craving the body and
[40:36] taking them down and buying new linen
[40:38] and wrapping them and then it just
[40:40] doesn't say well and they he put them in
[40:41] a grave it says there was one nearby
[40:43] there was a garden near where he was
[40:45] crucified and this was a a grave a tomb
[40:48] heun out of a rock in which no man ever
[40:50] laid and there's all these details given
[40:52] to it and then when it comes to the
[40:54] resurrection now this is where I want
[40:56] the details right I I want to know just
[40:59] exactly what's happening that can make a
[41:01] man that's dead live again I I want to
[41:03] know how this works I want to know the
[41:04] elements that relate to it I I want to
[41:07] be able to look into the box and see it
[41:09] happen and observe it happening but all
[41:11] the Bible says is there's an earthquake
[41:13] and the stone is rolled
[41:15] away we don't know what takes place in
[41:18] behind the stone uh we we don't know if
[41:22] he wrestled his way out uh and
[41:25] maneuvered his way out and and folded
[41:26] the we're we're not sure exactly what's
[41:29] taking place in the darkness but we know
[41:32] based upon what we can observe that
[41:34] Christ who is dead is
[41:37] alive there's no mystery that he was
[41:39] crucified and died and it should not be
[41:41] any mystery that he's
[41:44] alive but what happened in that black
[41:47] box what happened behind that
[41:51] stone these are things that again the
[41:55] Jews were wrestling with
[41:58] and those of the chief priests and
[41:59] Pharisees just as they were worried that
[42:01] the
[42:02] deceiver body would be stolen and they
[42:04] set watch now they had another problem
[42:06] to deal with because now the very ones
[42:09] who are to set watch and determine
[42:10] whether or not the disciples stole the
[42:13] body are now witnesses that they
[42:15] didn't they're now witnesses that the
[42:18] body was in there and then it
[42:20] wasn't well who took it nobody we sat
[42:24] watch and the next thing we know the
[42:26] stone is open and there's an angel
[42:28] sitting on the stone and there's no body
[42:30] in there and it was H out there's no
[42:33] other secret tunnel in there's no other
[42:34] way in there's no other explanations
[42:36] they couldn't say oh well there's
[42:38] another body in there we'll just allege
[42:39] that that's
[42:41] Jesus all these things have been
[42:43] controlled for as it were oh almost so
[42:46] this is what and this let me just say
[42:48] this this is always the tactic of the
[42:50] devil just
[42:51] lie the devil and even the critics are
[42:55] not afraid to lie to achieve their means
[42:58] of discrediting something that they
[42:59] don't agree
[43:01] with and in Matthew 28: 11-15 it says
[43:04] now when they were going behold some of
[43:07] the watch came into the City and showed
[43:10] unto the chief priest all things that
[43:11] were done so those that were setting
[43:14] guard those that were making sure the
[43:16] disciples didn't steal the body away in
[43:18] the night are now witnesses that
[43:21] something has happened and they go and
[43:23] they tell the chief priest guess what
[43:26] there was an earthquake break next thing
[43:28] we know the stone is rolled away and
[43:29] there's an angel sitting there and the
[43:32] body's gone and the linens are all
[43:34] wrapped together very neatly and the
[43:36] napkin which was about his head was
[43:38] laying and said did you seal it good
[43:40] enough listen we had it sealed really
[43:42] really good and there was more than just
[43:44] one man keeping watch we were not going
[43:46] to let this body be
[43:48] stallen trust me Chief priest the body
[43:52] was not stolen it's just not there
[43:55] anymore amen
[43:58] and so now they got to they got to call
[44:01] huddle and when they were assembled with
[44:03] the elders all hands on deck just made
[44:05] someone in corporate the corporate world
[44:07] get uh Buzzy and they they were
[44:11] assembled with the elders and had taken
[44:13] counil this is their conclusion they
[44:15] gave large money I want large money they
[44:19] gave large money was it a giant check
[44:22] you know like you see when they win the
[44:23] lottery here they gave large money under
[44:26] the soldier sers so these just weren't
[44:29] men guarding the tomb these were
[44:32] soldiers put the aid team on it put the
[44:35] SEALs team on it put the best just give
[44:37] guard long enough in order for them to
[44:39] not be able to take the body and they
[44:41] give large money to the soldiers
[44:45] saying say
[44:47] ye his disciples came by night and stole
[44:50] him away while we
[44:52] slept that's the only way to explain why
[44:55] these soldiers would have let this body
[44:56] get taken away is these band of bands of
[45:00] this band of men that were tasked with
[45:02] making the tomb secure and making sure
[45:04] the body didn't leave were
[45:07] asleep and they gave him large money to
[45:10] tell that story and says if this come to
[45:11] the governor's ears we will persuade him
[45:14] and secure you in other words do we all
[45:17] agree on our
[45:18] story so they took the money large as it
[45:22] was and did as they were taught in this
[45:25] saying is commonly reported among the
[45:27] Jews until this
[45:29] day they could they didn't even need the
[45:32] internet then just get the story out
[45:35] there so enough doubt tell a few lies
[45:36] and people will never know whether or
[45:38] not it was true or not just give people
[45:40] enough to work with and if they want a
[45:42] doubt they'll have something to work
[45:44] with so now this is the
[45:47] story that is told by these
[45:50] soldiers who were not overcome in a
[45:53] battle who did not let the stone get
[45:56] rolled Away by Earthly means and who did
[45:59] not allow the body to be taken by the
[46:01] disciples it's the story of those men
[46:04] that could say a dead body went in and
[46:08] there's no dead body there
[46:11] anymore Jesus Christ
[46:14] dies he enters the tomb
[46:18] dead but when you see him next outside
[46:21] of the Tomb he's
[46:24] alive this tomb this room in a cave or
[46:28] this CA this room in the side of a in a
[46:30] rock this cave in the side of a hill
[46:33] room heun out of a rock and then sealed
[46:37] this tomb hid the
[46:41] transformation if I could say this and
[46:44] this kind of just a whole another
[46:45] Channel this isn't a resurrection like
[46:47] Lazarus Lazarus would live again and
[46:49] die this wasn't a resurrection of those
[46:52] who had been dead before and they were
[46:53] brought back to life in a in a condition
[46:57] much like they were before they died but
[46:59] this is a different Resurrection this is
[47:01] a glorification this is a transformation
[47:03] even to where Christ was not
[47:07] recognizable in the state that he was in
[47:11] because could it be that he was young
[47:13] again could it be there was some
[47:15] resemblance but not so strong enough to
[47:17] the man who looked like he was 50 that
[47:19] went into the tomb but there was enough
[47:22] left to know yes look at his hands and
[47:24] look at his sides
[47:30] that stone and The
[47:33] Rock hid what took place on the
[47:37] inside a dead body beaten and bruised
[47:40] not yet broken but
[47:42] pierced aged well beyond his
[47:47] years thrown into crucified on a cross
[47:51] and thrown into a a room in the side of
[47:54] a hill in darkness and sealed and a
[47:57] watch set over it what took place the
[48:00] tomb hid the
[48:02] transformation his death was observed
[48:05] openly his death was observed publicly
[48:08] hanging on a cross and naked before the
[48:11] public to be scorned and he dies
[48:14] publicly the Centurion Witnesses when he
[48:17] gives up the ghost He says surely this
[48:18] was the son of God H those that had came
[48:21] beat their chest and walked away it
[48:24] there was many that could witness that
[48:26] day he
[48:27] dead yes amen we also know that his life
[48:31] afterwards was
[48:32] observed death life both
[48:37] observed in Acts 2:32 this Jesus hath
[48:40] God raised up whereof we are all
[48:43] Witnesses they're Witnesses of life in
[48:46] Acts chap 3: 14 and 15 but ye denied the
[48:49] Holy One and the J and desired a
[48:52] murderer to be granted unto you and
[48:54] killed the Prince of Life there's his
[48:56] death whom God hath raised from the dead
[49:00] whereof we Are Witnesses now I'm giving
[49:02] you some Clues to some
[49:05] things they killed him but he's alive
[49:08] and we're Witnesses in Acts Chap 13:
[49:13] 28-31 and though they found no cause of
[49:16] death in him yet desired they pilate
[49:18] that he should be slain this is the
[49:19] record Being recited in the book of Acts
[49:22] and when they had fulfilled all that was
[49:23] written of him they took him down from
[49:26] the tree and laid him in a Seiler this
[49:28] is an unbroken narrative this is
[49:30] perfectly recorded everyone agreeing it
[49:32] says now the dead body enters the tomb
[49:36] but God raised him from the
[49:38] dead there's that phrase God raised him
[49:41] from the dead we can we can draw that
[49:44] conclusion based upon what we
[49:46] observe and when he he was seeing many
[49:49] days of them which come up with him From
[49:51] Galilee to Jerusalem who are witnesses
[49:54] unto the people so he saying he was seen
[49:57] many
[49:59] days this life after death is witnessed
[50:03] in Acts chap 10: 40 him God raised up
[50:06] the third day and showed him openly his
[50:09] death was
[50:11] open life is now witnessed life is open
[50:15] Paul said he was seen of above 500
[50:17] people some are still alive today that
[50:18] saw him this was no hidden thing this
[50:21] just isn't The Whispers of the disciples
[50:23] this isn't some conspiracy much like it
[50:26] was for the Chief priest and the
[50:27] soldiers they had the little cabal they
[50:30] had the little secret but that nobody
[50:32] else could be witnessed to they were the
[50:34] only Witnesses of a lie and a
[50:36] fabrication but God raised Christ and
[50:40] set him before many witnesses over and
[50:43] over and over again so that there could
[50:45] be no disputing of the record of
[50:51] life these things could be observed as
[50:53] we see it in scripture crucified buried
[50:56] but now alive shown openly but what
[50:59] could not be
[51:01] observed is what happened behind the
[51:04] stone I know this is very very simple
[51:07] and I I'm I'm wanting it to be that
[51:11] way what could not be observed was what
[51:14] happened in the
[51:16] Tomb says in Acts chap 5:30 I hope you
[51:19] could just see it I'm not even using all
[51:21] the scriptures that could be used in
[51:22] these things the god of our fathers
[51:24] raised up Jesus whom ye slew and hanged
[51:28] on a
[51:31] tree I've read four Witnesses now
[51:36] five
[51:38] witnesses that
[51:41] Christ was laid in a grave buried as
[51:44] Paul calls it laid behind a
[51:47] stone
[51:49] dead in
[51:51] God raised up
[51:54] Jesus in darkness
[51:57] behind the
[52:00] stone his death is
[52:03] public his manner of death is public and
[52:05] then we could say even as teaching in
[52:07] manner of life after he resurrects is
[52:10] public it's seen it's witness but this
[52:13] thing God does something in
[52:17] secret God God does something
[52:22] hidden would would it not seem more
[52:25] dramatic and plausible
[52:27] to witness that this is the Son of God
[52:29] than to see him expire and die on the
[52:31] cross and then in the eyes of those that
[52:33] slayed him he animates back to life and
[52:35] he's transformed and all that saw him
[52:37] die would see him change again into a
[52:40] glorious
[52:42] being would that not have been more
[52:45] Supernatural it seems like that would be
[52:47] more Godlike that would be more
[52:50] indisputable but yet God does something
[52:53] in the
[52:55] dark God God does something hidden
[52:58] behind Stone in a black
[53:02] box he does something seemingly
[53:05] impossible in Acts chap 2: 22- 24 Peter
[53:09] says ye men of Israel hear these words
[53:12] Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God
[53:14] among you by Miracles and wonders and
[53:16] signs which God did by him in the midst
[53:20] of you as ye yourselves also know they
[53:24] witness the Miracles they witness the
[53:26] ministry him being delivered by the
[53:29] determinant counsel and forn knowledge
[53:31] of god wow you have taken and by Wicked
[53:35] hands have crucified and slain he lived
[53:40] he manifested miracles signs and wonders
[53:43] but according to the determinate counsel
[53:46] and for knowledge of God he has allowed
[53:48] you with Wicked hands to crucify him and
[53:51] slay him we arrive at verse 24 with the
[53:54] dead
[53:55] Christ verse 24 whom God hath raised
[54:00] up and this is maybe as close as we get
[54:03] to maybe even some imagery as to what
[54:06] takes place having loose the Pains of
[54:09] death because it was not possible that
[54:12] he should be Holden of it so here he is
[54:15] bound by the chains of death then
[54:17] wrapped literally in new linen laid be
[54:20] in a in a cave hollowed out of a stone
[54:23] and a stone rolled up against it and
[54:25] there he lays in this dark cold grave
[54:28] Bound by Linens but yet in a very real
[54:31] sense he's Bound by chains of
[54:35] death and the Pains of
[54:38] death are wrapped around him but the
[54:41] Bible says that God raised up Jesus and
[54:44] it uses this poetic phrase having loosed
[54:48] the Pains of death and know it's the
[54:51] cords of death were broken the bands of
[54:55] death were broken if I could say this
[54:58] never before had they been broken like
[55:02] this a man is born and he's ordained to
[55:05] die and a man that died seemingly
[55:07] untimely if he raised again we
[55:10] understand that that chain is still
[55:12] linked to that
[55:14] man and it could only go so far before
[55:17] death comes and stops him brother
[55:19] brandom even tells us of those who
[55:21] should have died at a certain time but
[55:23] yet they recovered they miraculously and
[55:25] that one baby that died and brother br's
[55:27] able to go back in a vision and say oh
[55:29] they should have died then and now
[55:32] they've gone now it just shows that that
[55:33] death comes and there's no way to break
[55:36] those bands but now this is what's so
[55:39] remarkable death doesn't always lose its
[55:41] grip for for mankind he just kind of
[55:44] lets them uh loose for a little bit of a
[55:46] season but now the cords of death are
[55:49] broken he has loosed the Pains of death
[55:53] and it says
[55:54] because it was
[55:56] impossible for death to hold him
[56:01] Hallelujah hell death Hell In The Grave
[56:05] had no more power over
[56:07] him no matter how much it wanted to hold
[56:10] him no matter how much it felt it had a
[56:12] right to him death was intent upon
[56:15] keeping it
[56:16] back I asked my wife if she was going to
[56:19] sing the conversation this morning as a
[56:21] special all by
[56:23] herself and because it would just it
[56:25] would
[56:26] aati I we just did it on the way to
[56:29] church and so it wasn't something we
[56:30] took seriously and we're practicing
[56:32] there at the piano SE that's very good
[56:34] sister uh there's this idea that I'm
[56:37] going to hold him nobody's ever got away
[56:39] from me before he's not going to escape
[56:42] me but now all of a sudden it's like I
[56:45] I'm the same death I was
[56:48] before I'm men are still
[56:50] dying there's those that still remain in
[56:53] the
[56:54] grave I I I I still I seemingly have
[56:57] power but over this one Hallelujah and
[57:01] some others I don't have power over
[57:05] anymore I I still seem to have strength
[57:08] I'm still death I still have power but
[57:11] my bands and my power over this one has
[57:14] been loosed and when this one has been
[57:16] loosed it did something else to those
[57:19] who are in
[57:21] Paradise
[57:25] Hallelujah
[57:26] the chain was
[57:28] broken listen to how job says this in
[57:31] Job chapter 14 oh I'm getting excited
[57:34] I'm preaching over an hour
[57:36] now Job chapter 14:
[57:39] 10-15 but man dieth and wasteth the
[57:43] way that's what man does yay man giveth
[57:47] up the ghost that's what Jesus is
[57:49] recorded over and over and over saying
[57:52] is he gave up the ghost this should
[57:54] bring us back to Job 14
[57:57] when a man gives up the ghost he dies he
[58:00] Wast away and he's no more as the waters
[58:04] fall fail from the sea and the flood
[58:06] decayeth and drith up so man lith down
[58:10] and riseth not till the heavens be no
[58:14] more they shall not wake nor be raised
[58:17] out of their
[58:19] sleep now think of that description this
[58:22] is man that enters the tomb this is
[58:26] death this is observed job is not just
[58:28] speculating saying well we're all new
[58:30] here no one's died but this is what I
[58:31] think's going to happen no they've
[58:33] witnessed it time and time again that
[58:35] when a man dies he Wast away they've
[58:39] seen the bones they've seen the dust
[58:41] they've seen the Decay it could have
[58:43] been even more descriptive of the the
[58:45] skin worms that eat away and the body
[58:48] rotting and away and it's gone and he's
[58:51] no
[58:52] more and there's something that could be
[58:55] observed in nature but when it came to
[58:58] man you could be the this flower could
[59:00] die and seemingly go back into the
[59:02] ground and the next year it comes up
[59:04] again grass could die the next year it
[59:05] comes back again leaves could fall off a
[59:06] tree the next year it comes back again
[59:08] job could observe so much cycles and
[59:10] nature he says but man's different as
[59:12] great as he is when that man is swn into
[59:14] the ground when he dies he doesn't come
[59:16] back up again from the earth you don't
[59:19] ever see this man again and then he says
[59:22] this now think about hopefully we've
[59:24] walked through this together where this
[59:26] just have some punch and we've we've
[59:28] walked enough around in this black box
[59:30] we've walked up to the tomb and if
[59:32] you're John you just peaked in if you
[59:33] Peter you went all the way in hopefully
[59:36] enough about this scene is with you to
[59:38] hear this then job in pondering what
[59:41] happens to man when he dies and he Wast
[59:43] away and he's never seen again he makes
[59:45] this prophetic declaration oh that thou
[59:48] would has hide me in the
[59:50] grave hide me don't just bury me don't
[59:54] let me just rck die and waste away when
[59:56] something's hidden it's put there to be
[59:59] retrieved later amen there's a
[1:00:02] difference when you when someone says I
[1:00:03] lost my wallet versus I hid my wallet
[1:00:06] and forgot where I hid it there there
[1:00:09] this is something where I plan to come
[1:00:11] back again I plan to return so he says
[1:00:14] oh that thou would hide me in the grave
[1:00:17] that thou wouldest Keep Me In
[1:00:21] Secret Keep Me In Secret it's not
[1:00:23] observed man cannot says keep me in
[1:00:26] secret until thy wrath be passed that
[1:00:29] thou wouldst appoint me a set time and
[1:00:32] remember me Jesus Christ went into the
[1:00:35] grave death the judgments of God brought
[1:00:38] death there had to be something
[1:00:40] accomplished by his death but once God's
[1:00:42] Wrath was satisfied death no longer had
[1:00:46] a right to the body of Christ and here
[1:00:49] is job cries out oh if you just would
[1:00:52] hide me in secret and then remember me
[1:00:55] when you're wrath has been plated in
[1:00:57] other words don't just bury me in the
[1:00:59] ground to rot and die but Place me in a
[1:01:02] grave as it were you are hiding me from
[1:01:04] Mankind and then remember me to come get
[1:01:07] me again amen
[1:01:11] hallelujah keep me in secret until thy
[1:01:13] wrath is overpassed and then he comes to
[1:01:15] verse
[1:01:16] 14 if a man dies shall he live again
[1:01:19] what a
[1:01:20] question all the days of my appointed
[1:01:23] time will I wait
[1:01:26] that time that set time that you would
[1:01:28] remember me I'm not going to be wasting
[1:01:30] I'm not going to be decaying I'm going
[1:01:32] to be
[1:01:33] waiting till my change
[1:01:36] Come Thou shalt call and I will answer
[1:01:40] thee thou will have a desire to work to
[1:01:43] the work of thine
[1:01:45] hands the thing which you have made the
[1:01:48] thing you have created though death may
[1:01:51] seem to have taken me and buried me in
[1:01:53] the earth I'm not buried to decay I'm
[1:01:56] not buried to waste away I'm just hid in
[1:02:00] secret and then you're going to call I'm
[1:02:03] going to have a appointed time where I
[1:02:05] come
[1:02:06] back and the one that man says when a
[1:02:08] man dies can he live again man waste
[1:02:10] away what's remembered of him there's no
[1:02:12] man that comes back from this he speaks
[1:02:15] that man Wast away but job said oh that
[1:02:18] you would appoint me a time where I
[1:02:20] wouldn't forever remain hidden but that
[1:02:24] I could come back again
[1:02:26] in Acts 13:
[1:02:29] 32-37 and we declare unto you glad
[1:02:31] tidings how that the promise which was
[1:02:33] made unto the fathers God hath fulfilled
[1:02:36] the same unto us their children in that
[1:02:39] he hath raised up Jesus again as it is
[1:02:41] also written in the second Psalm Thou
[1:02:43] Art my son this day have I begotten thee
[1:02:46] and as concerning that he raised him up
[1:02:48] from the dead now no more to return to
[1:02:51] corruption this is where it's different
[1:02:54] oh this man was raised but died again
[1:02:56] this man was raised he died again but
[1:02:57] this one this is different he said on
[1:03:00] this wise I will give you the sure
[1:03:01] mercies of David where of he saith also
[1:03:04] in another Psalm Thou shalt not suffer
[1:03:06] thine Holy One to see
[1:03:09] corruption job said when man dies he
[1:03:11] waste away it is sown in demand that
[1:03:14] when after a certain amount of time the
[1:03:16] body begins to Decay and to corrupt for
[1:03:19] David after he had served his own
[1:03:20] Generation by the will of God he fell
[1:03:23] asleep was laid with his fathers
[1:03:26] laid in a grave with other men Christ
[1:03:27] was separate from Sinners he's not laid
[1:03:29] in a grave with his fathers he fell
[1:03:31] asleep laid unto his fathers and saw
[1:03:33] corruption he say so these verses could
[1:03:36] not have been speaking about David but
[1:03:39] he whom God raised again think of this
[1:03:42] saw no
[1:03:45] corruption this is
[1:03:47] remarkable that God did not allow
[1:03:50] corruption to set in he watched out over
[1:03:53] the body so that the bone was not broken
[1:03:55] he watched out of it so verse after
[1:03:57] verse after verse just fulfilled and now
[1:03:59] there's a word that says I will not
[1:04:01] suffer him to see corruption and unseen
[1:04:04] to man man could play a little bit of
[1:04:06] schro dinger's cat and say there's a
[1:04:08] body inside is it corrupting is it not
[1:04:10] the only way to know is to observe it so
[1:04:12] they open up the box to see whether or
[1:04:14] not the body's decaying and it's not
[1:04:16] there
[1:04:18] anymore
[1:04:21] wo if I could say this as I try to wrap
[1:04:24] this up
[1:04:26] now that I've learned to preach more
[1:04:28] than an hour I need to figure out how
[1:04:30] not to preach an hour and a
[1:04:33] half between death and life I just want
[1:04:37] to put it this way very simply and it
[1:04:39] doesn't change the mystery it just adds
[1:04:41] more color to it between death and life
[1:04:44] was
[1:04:46] God look at these scriptures that had to
[1:04:48] be fulfilled for his death these
[1:04:50] scriptures that had to be fulfilled for
[1:04:52] Life The W the word stood there amen
[1:04:57] as a
[1:04:58] preserver so that Christ would not see
[1:05:01] corruption the word was there Christ was
[1:05:04] not just thrown into a
[1:05:06] grave and hid behind a stone job said oh
[1:05:11] that thou would hide me and keep me in
[1:05:17] secret he the word was there is a hiding
[1:05:20] place we read it already in Luke 23:46
[1:05:24] and when Jesus had cried with a loud
[1:05:25] voice he said father into thy hands I
[1:05:28] commend my spirit and having said thus
[1:05:31] he gave up the
[1:05:33] ghost he was now at this very moment
[1:05:36] realizing I'm full I have fully
[1:05:38] abandoned and given myself completely so
[1:05:41] now at this moment that I'm dying I'm
[1:05:43] not just being commit my body is not
[1:05:45] just being committed to a grave my
[1:05:46] spirit is being committed to
[1:05:49] God John 10: 17 and 18 therefore do do
[1:05:54] my father love me because I laid down my
[1:05:56] life that I might take it again no man
[1:06:00] taketh it from me but I lay it down of
[1:06:01] myself I have power to lay it down and I
[1:06:04] have power to take it again but over and
[1:06:07] over and over and over and over again we
[1:06:09] read that God raised Christ from the
[1:06:12] dead and the power he said this
[1:06:15] commandment have I received of my
[1:06:18] father if I could say this God was the
[1:06:20] inner workings of the Black
[1:06:23] Box his command his charge and his word
[1:06:27] said he will not corrupt he will be
[1:06:30] hidden for an appointed time but I will
[1:06:33] call and he'll come forth am the word
[1:06:36] will preserve him the word will keep him
[1:06:38] the word will hide him and it may be
[1:06:40] secret it may be unseen but eventually
[1:06:42] there he will come forth and it will be
[1:06:45] seen if I could say this it wasn't just
[1:06:47] a tomb and I want to go quickly and I'll
[1:06:49] just pick up some of this on Wednesday
[1:06:50] night it wasn't just a tomb it was a
[1:06:53] secret meeting place
[1:06:56] a secret meeting place hollowed out of a
[1:06:58] stone he said into thy hands I commend
[1:07:01] my spirit think about how that there
[1:07:03] Abraham desired a burial place and they
[1:07:06] all looked to this one spot this one
[1:07:08] plot and they all want to be there
[1:07:10] because it was something about the place
[1:07:12] and it wasn't so much that the bones
[1:07:14] would be there but there would be power
[1:07:16] present to raise the bones and so when
[1:07:18] Jesus says into thy hands I commend my
[1:07:21] spirit there is a grave near the Garden
[1:07:24] near the the sight of his death there
[1:07:26] was an appointed place a set time Jesus
[1:07:29] was not just being scattered into the
[1:07:31] ground he was not just being thrown into
[1:07:33] some pit there was a special place
[1:07:36] prepared a sight heun out of a stone and
[1:07:39] and work made prepared fresh and new and
[1:07:41] it was a hallowed place out of a stone
[1:07:44] where he
[1:07:46] laid in Isaiah 45:15 it says verily thou
[1:07:49] art a God that hideth
[1:07:51] thyself that means a god who's hidden
[1:07:54] who carefully hides himself and conceals
[1:07:57] themselves the Bible says thy way is in
[1:07:58] the sea other words when a ship passes
[1:08:00] through it it doesn't leave a track that
[1:08:02] you can follow later thy path in the
[1:08:04] Great Waters and thy footsteps are not
[1:08:06] known God moves and God works and and
[1:08:09] and you never see it he hideth where he
[1:08:11] works he's secret in the way that he
[1:08:13] does things for my thoughts are not your
[1:08:15] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[1:08:17] he says for as the heavens are higher
[1:08:19] than the earth so are my ways higher
[1:08:21] than yours and my thoughts than yours
[1:08:23] could I say this and I don't mean it in
[1:08:25] a crude way God is a black
[1:08:27] box there there are certain things about
[1:08:30] him that we accept and I think even just
[1:08:32] a someone who's just sane and sober
[1:08:34] would have to accept Supernatural would
[1:08:36] have to accept Divine but God is a black
[1:08:39] box something where there is no clear
[1:08:42] explanation something difficult to
[1:08:44] understand or explain something
[1:08:46] unexplainable something
[1:08:50] unsolvable Hallelujah something that
[1:08:52] cannot be
[1:08:54] interpreted that's why why we have
[1:08:56] science that's why we have so many
[1:08:57] religions it's man looking at a black
[1:09:00] box we see what goes in we see what
[1:09:02] comes out we know there's got to be
[1:09:04] something Beyond the Veil we know we got
[1:09:07] there's something that works beyond what
[1:09:08] we see but God cannot be described God
[1:09:12] cannot be contained God is that black
[1:09:15] box the secret things belong unto the
[1:09:19] Lord but then he says but those things
[1:09:21] which are revealed belong unto
[1:09:24] us
[1:09:25] the black box is
[1:09:27] unexplainable it's a mystery to himself
[1:09:30] no man knows the father but the son and
[1:09:31] to whom the son will reveal him this is
[1:09:33] the the mystery of God this is the
[1:09:35] mystery of who he is the mystery of
[1:09:37] purpose and the secret things are in the
[1:09:40] black
[1:09:41] box and they belong to him but the
[1:09:45] things which are revealed to us belong
[1:09:46] to us
[1:09:49] forever death entered the
[1:09:52] tomb but God reversed it
[1:09:56] happened in
[1:09:57] secret it happened in
[1:10:00] darkness in Acts chap 26:8 why should it
[1:10:03] be thought to thing incredible with you
[1:10:07] that God should raise the
[1:10:10] dead I ask the question
[1:10:13] now as Paul is there
[1:10:16] contending and there's this wrestling
[1:10:19] with it in this uh you know well there's
[1:10:22] no disputing they're not saying well
[1:10:24] Jesus is a myth Paul
[1:10:25] this guy never
[1:10:27] lived they observed the
[1:10:30] death this man Jesus of Nazareth was
[1:10:33] witnessed to be dead he was witnessed to
[1:10:37] be placed in a tomb he was witnessed to
[1:10:39] not have been
[1:10:42] stolen but now the grave is
[1:10:45] empty and he's
[1:10:47] seen and so Paul in a way he's offering
[1:10:51] he's offering not so much an explanation
[1:10:53] but just uh the con illusion why would
[1:10:56] it seem such a hard thing why would it
[1:10:59] be incredible that God should raise the
[1:11:02] dead remember the scripture we read in
[1:11:05] the beginning in Peter for even here
[1:11:07] unto were ye
[1:11:09] called because Christ also suffered for
[1:11:12] us leaving us an
[1:11:16] example that you should follow in his
[1:11:19] steps his steps were to a
[1:11:22] cross carried to a tomb but he came out
[1:11:25] of that
[1:11:27] tomb in John Chapter 13 Jesus Is Telling
[1:11:31] uh the the witnesses and the scribes and
[1:11:33] different ones the non- disciples you
[1:11:35] know you can't follow me you don't know
[1:11:36] where I'm going and then Peter's like
[1:11:38] where are you going and he said where I
[1:11:41] go you can't follow me now he said but
[1:11:44] you will
[1:11:45] afterwards in other words he was laying
[1:11:47] for steps and he said you can't go where
[1:11:50] I'm going
[1:11:51] now but you will be able to later and
[1:11:54] though we realized this for foreshadows
[1:11:55] many things I want us to look at it for
[1:11:57] ourselves where he was going then we
[1:11:59] couldn't go but we can
[1:12:01] now into thy hands I commend my spirit
[1:12:06] and I'm going to be taken to a laid
[1:12:08] behind a stone on a cold slab wrapped in
[1:12:12] Linens and there's going to I'm I'm
[1:12:14] going to be trusted to this sealed
[1:12:17] in no way of
[1:12:19] excape wrapped and
[1:12:22] bound but I'm trusted in a God that
[1:12:24] raises the dead and though the process
[1:12:27] may not be able to be explained and
[1:12:30] though the specifics leave us something
[1:12:32] to be desired in terms of just exactly
[1:12:34] what was it we say well it was the word
[1:12:35] it was the word of God that's the word
[1:12:37] that did it I know there's something in
[1:12:39] this it says but how and how did it work
[1:12:41] and how was it said and what did it do
[1:12:43] and where did it start we want to find
[1:12:44] the Fingerprints of the evidence we want
[1:12:46] to be able to replicate it we kind of
[1:12:48] want the copycat recipe for what was
[1:12:50] happening behind that stone but what we
[1:12:52] know is God was in there amen
[1:12:56] amen and we can
[1:12:59] follow in Matthew Chapter 6: 5 and
[1:13:03] 6 When you pray don't be as a hypocrite
[1:13:05] stand in the synagogues in the public
[1:13:07] openly praying oh look at me look at me
[1:13:10] don't do
[1:13:12] that but thou and just meditate on these
[1:13:16] words this week but thou when thou
[1:13:18] prayest you when you pray enter into thy
[1:13:22] closet that word is secret real
[1:13:26] an inner
[1:13:27] chamber if I could say this where the
[1:13:29] father is amen because he says and when
[1:13:33] thou has shut thy door the stone has
[1:13:37] been rolled in front of the door you're
[1:13:39] not even praying with the door open
[1:13:41] right because that's that's what a uber
[1:13:43] Pharisee would do right like he'd say
[1:13:46] well you know I won't do it on the
[1:13:47] street corner but you know just open the
[1:13:50] door a little bit oh
[1:13:53] God right just do it right in the door
[1:13:55] doorway but I'm in the closet no he says
[1:13:57] no shut the door hide
[1:13:59] yourself and the Father which is in
[1:14:05] secret this place that we've got to
[1:14:07] enter into it represents death to
[1:14:11] self but above all it represents trust
[1:14:15] in a God you don't see Amen in a God
[1:14:18] that at the moment you can't put your
[1:14:19] fingers on and the Father which is
[1:14:22] secret the Father which is hidden will
[1:14:25] reward thee
[1:14:27] openly on the other side of the Black
[1:14:31] Box Brothers if you could come to your
[1:14:41] instruments maybe we'll add a little bit
[1:14:43] to this on Wednesday
[1:14:46] but the glory of God entered behind the
[1:14:50] stone and brought a
[1:14:53] resurrection and Paul says that
[1:14:55] therefore in Romans 6:4 therefore we are
[1:14:57] buried with him by baptism into death
[1:15:00] that like as Christ was raised up from
[1:15:02] the dead by the glory of the
[1:15:06] father now that that's just that's just
[1:15:09] like saying the key that goes into a
[1:15:11] lock and it turns and the lock unlocks
[1:15:15] you say what's the key that did it but
[1:15:17] yet still in the Black Box what's
[1:15:21] turning what's moving what kind is
[1:15:27] it the glory of God entered in behind
[1:15:29] the stone and raised up Christ from the
[1:15:32] dead raised up by the glory of the
[1:15:34] father even so we also should walk in
[1:15:38] newness of
[1:15:39] life that we too have a place that we
[1:15:42] can
[1:15:43] go that we too can be quickened to walk
[1:15:47] in newness of
[1:15:50] Life there as the seed was swn into the
[1:15:53] grave Christ the Original Seed swn into
[1:15:56] the
[1:15:58] grave as job witnessed it as men talk
[1:16:00] about it and it said all the cycle of
[1:16:02] nature a seed goes on the ground it
[1:16:04] comes up it Withers and dies it comes
[1:16:05] back again Christ was swn into the
[1:16:08] ground and in order for him to come back
[1:16:10] again light entered into the darkness
[1:16:13] and the quickening power of God the
[1:16:14] shikina glory the Bible says the glory
[1:16:16] of the Father the light of God's
[1:16:19] presence quickened Christ back to
[1:16:22] life and God ha both raised up the Lord
[1:16:26] and will also raise up Us by his own
[1:16:30] power he says it again in 2 Corinthians
[1:16:33] knowing that he which raised up the Lord
[1:16:34] Jesus shall raise us up also by Jesus
[1:16:38] and shall present us with you Jesus
[1:16:40] Christ went into the ground as a seed
[1:16:43] and the light struck the seed and the
[1:16:45] Darkness behind the stone unable by uned
[1:16:49] by man was quickened back to
[1:16:52] life and in Romans chap 8: 1011 and if
[1:16:55] Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:16:57] because of sin but the spirit is life
[1:17:00] because of righteousness you have death
[1:17:02] and you have life but what is it in
[1:17:04] between but the spirit of him that
[1:17:06] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:17:08] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:17:11] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:17:13] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:17:16] you I'm just I don't think I'm doing
[1:17:19] anything to try to uh understand the
[1:17:21] mystery of the Tomb anymore but just to
[1:17:23] say that you're living out of Mystery
[1:17:25] you're living out of a mystery how a
[1:17:27] dead dying decaying body inside unseen
[1:17:31] by the world there's it's harnessing
[1:17:34] quickening power that though the world
[1:17:36] cannot observe totally and completely
[1:17:39] what is taking place inside of you
[1:17:41] inside of you there's a transformation
[1:17:44] happening oh brother Bram what's the
[1:17:47] what is the translation what is a
[1:17:49] translation change that's all in other
[1:17:52] words just as there was an earthquake
[1:17:53] and the ground shook and the stone
[1:17:55] rolled away and he was no longer in the
[1:17:58] Tomb inside of you right now you are a
[1:18:01] black box un unheard of to the world
[1:18:05] unrecognizable to the world
[1:18:06] uninterpreted to the world but God one

[1:18:58] day brother Bram in the sermon it is the
[1:19:00] rising of the sun he said he sent his
[1:19:01] word to his disciples he is believing
[1:19:04] fear not for I'm he that was
[1:19:07] dead and is alive again forever
[1:19:11] more and I have the keys to death and
[1:19:14] hell I've already conquered
[1:19:18] it death and then life he says Don't
[1:19:22] Fear
[1:19:23] anymore between death and life don't
[1:19:26] fear anymore for every for ordained
[1:19:29] predestinated seat of God shall come to
[1:19:31] life when that light spreads across the
[1:19:34] Earth of the Glorious gospel in every
[1:19:38] age it'll bring forth the crop that God
[1:19:40] ordained it to do he had raised from the
[1:19:44] dead oh what a wonderful thing that is I
[1:19:47] am alive brother says I am alive or
[1:19:51] quickened the word means word quickened
[1:19:55] the Greek word means that something
[1:19:56] that's made
[1:19:58] alive after death oh what a mystery Dead
[1:20:04] Alive Dead Alive what happened in
[1:20:08] between he says like the seed that goes
[1:20:11] in the earth it has to
[1:20:13] die every bit of the seed it has to rot
[1:20:16] every bit of the seed and every bit of
[1:20:17] the life that was in the seed has to
[1:20:19] come forth again he was
[1:20:22] quickened not only that and I will send
[1:20:25] the same life that quickened me the
[1:20:29] power that brought me from the grave I
[1:20:31] will send it upon you to Quicken you
[1:20:34] that where I am there that where I am
[1:20:36] there ye will be also am surely it could
[1:20:40] be said to the disciples where I'm going
[1:20:43] you cannot follow me now but now he
[1:20:45] invites you to that secret place he
[1:20:48] invites you to that chamber oh and it
[1:20:50] may seem fearful it may seem like
[1:20:52] something oh I'm just not sure what the
[1:20:54] future holds I'm not sure what's going
[1:20:56] to take place in there but it's a place
[1:20:58] of trust and I promise you he's
[1:21:02] there you may not know what happens
[1:21:04] behind that Veil you may not understand
[1:21:06] what's happening in that secret place
[1:21:09] but he's
[1:21:11] there and that's where he wants to meet
[1:21:14] you and that's what's happening in the
[1:21:16] age we're living in right
[1:21:18] now the Father which is in secret hidden
[1:21:21] unseen he wants us to meet us meet us in
[1:21:24] that
[1:21:25] place between death and
[1:21:28] life and we can understand it better by
[1:21:31] the mystery of this black box the
[1:21:35] tomb I know there's a lot there just
[1:21:38] to think
[1:21:41] about but it should mean something to us
[1:21:45] there's so many mysteries in this world
[1:21:47] so many unknowns and unseens and so many
[1:21:49] things we don't understand say father
[1:21:51] into thy hands I commend my spirit
[1:21:55] father into your hands I give my life
[1:21:58] just as Christ abandoned himself to the
[1:22:00] cross and in doing so he abandoned
[1:22:03] himself to the
[1:22:04] Grave he was not going to be
[1:22:07] forgotten because there in darkness
[1:22:10] there in that hidden place the
[1:22:14] father I know as
[1:22:17] we covered it last year in the image of
[1:22:20] Christ entered into
[1:22:23] heaven if we could just bow our heads
[1:22:26] for a
[1:22:30] [Music]
[1:22:37] moment I'm just overwhelmed with this
[1:22:45] image of God embracing his
[1:22:53] son and this
[1:22:58] Embrace so
[1:23:01] warm to
[1:23:04] [Music]
[1:23:06] omnipotence and I see a father holding
[1:23:08] his son tight to his
[1:23:11] bosom saying you did it son you did
[1:23:16] it it's over it's
[1:23:19] finished I knew you could do
[1:23:22] it I knew you would go this
[1:23:25] path I knew you could trust me I knew
[1:23:29] you would trust
[1:23:33] me and there in
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:38] secret perfect love begins to have its
[1:23:41] [Music]
[1:23:42] way there in
[1:23:48] secret
[1:23:50] hidden is a union between word to word
[1:23:54] word father to
[1:24:05] son I don't know the mystery of the
[1:24:09] Tomb with as much Authority as I can
[1:24:12] wield with quotes and
[1:24:14] Scriptures it doesn't mean all the
[1:24:15] answers are
[1:24:17] plain but what I do know is he's
[1:24:20] there God was there and that's all that
[1:24:25] mattered and with all of life's
[1:24:27] mysteries maybe there's one hurdle that
[1:24:29] someone needs to overcome and that's the
[1:24:31] fear of entering into that secret place
[1:24:33] to trust him when all hopes is lost when
[1:24:36] the Pains of love lost and whatever it
[1:24:40] might
[1:24:41] be bombarding us just to flee to him the
[1:24:45] Bible says a man will be a
[1:24:48] rock we have a hiding place that we can
[1:24:51] go
[1:24:52] to there in
[1:24:55] secret he'll do for you the
[1:24:58] unexplainable that which cannot be
[1:25:01] interpreted that which cannot be
[1:25:04] explained but you'll be able to say one
[1:25:07] day all I know is I'm
[1:25:11] changed I know I went in broken and I've
[1:25:14] come out fixed I went in sick and I've
[1:25:16] come out healed I went in scared I've
[1:25:18] come out bold and
[1:25:20] courageous would you be willing to enter
[1:25:22] in
[1:25:23] today if you could let's stand together
[1:25:25] as a
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:38] congregation let's bow our heads in a
[1:25:40] word of
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:52] prayer do you want to come run into him
[1:25:55] today you want to run into his
[1:25:59] arms you know could you imagine
[1:26:03] Jesus when he committed his Spirit into
[1:26:06] the hands of God and he was going to
[1:26:07] have this unseen reunion and they were
[1:26:10] going to meet in this way of saying it's
[1:26:14] done it's finished you did it it's
[1:26:17] over I can have Fellowship again with my
[1:26:21] creation my Redemption is now it's
[1:26:25] it's
[1:26:27] purchased God even himself realized he's
[1:26:29] on the other side of redemption
[1:26:31] now and
[1:26:33] it's could you imagine Jesus being
[1:26:36] nervous and
[1:26:38] Afraid
[1:26:40] fearful that it wasn't enough he didn't
[1:26:42] do good enough or that God was going to
[1:26:44] say yeah you know I think I'll just try
[1:26:46] another
[1:26:47] son there was
[1:26:50] rest there was rest in that
[1:26:53] tomb
[1:26:55] and that's the image that's offered to
[1:26:56] you in the secret place when thou
[1:26:58] prayest enter thou into thy closet it's
[1:27:01] a place of
[1:27:03] rest place of
[1:27:06] trust not because it's hidden so much
[1:27:09] from the world and robbers can't get to
[1:27:11] you and people can't annoy you but it's
[1:27:14] because he's
[1:27:15] there that secret
[1:27:17] mechanism in the black box that makes
[1:27:20] all things
[1:27:22] possible so I pray for you to today that
[1:27:24] you could just trust him more between
[1:27:26] death and life as mysterious as it may
[1:27:29] be trust
[1:27:32] him our gracious heavenly father today
[1:27:35] Lord this Easter Sunday as we've entered
[1:27:37] into the
[1:27:38] afternoon father we're just so
[1:27:41] grateful we're grateful for the
[1:27:45] record that there can be no disagreement
[1:27:47] that your son
[1:27:50] died surely the scripture could have
[1:27:52] been written in such a way to where our
[1:27:53] theological debates today could be over
[1:27:55] whether or not there was a certain
[1:27:57] number of lashings requisite to retire
[1:27:59] our sins and just how much he was beaten
[1:28:02] and bruised for our iniquities and just
[1:28:04] how much he was striped for our healing
[1:28:06] and there could be so much speculation
[1:28:09] as to what his life meant afterwards and
[1:28:12] whether or not he did live and where
[1:28:14] he's gone now and all sorts of things
[1:28:16] Lord but you provided so much detail in
[1:28:18] the
[1:28:19] word to where we know you sent your son
[1:28:22] and he died cruel
[1:28:25] death and then just likewise just as
[1:28:28] much as it was detailed in death it's
[1:28:31] detailed in life and he's appearing to
[1:28:34] disciples to over 500 he's eating he's
[1:28:36] walking along the sea
[1:28:38] he's he's fellowshipping he's
[1:28:41] teaching there's life no doubt about
[1:28:44] it and we have witnesses that observe
[1:28:47] that Christ has now some ways appeared
[1:28:50] gone back into another Black
[1:28:53] Box
[1:28:54] he's out of our
[1:28:57] sight and so Lord our eyes turned back
[1:29:00] to that
[1:29:02] tomb the
[1:29:04] mystery of what took place behind that
[1:29:07] stone somehow someway the word tells us
[1:29:11] as you raised up Christ from the dead
[1:29:15] you will raise us
[1:29:18] up we may not be able to explain it we
[1:29:22] may not be able to interpret it we may
[1:29:24] not even be able to conceive how but we
[1:29:27] believe that you will and that you
[1:29:31] are and we'll trust you and as a body of
[1:29:35] Believers today we say into thy hands
[1:29:39] into thy hands oh God into that secret
[1:29:42] place we come hide
[1:29:45] us hide us away oh Lord until the change
[1:29:50] comes I don't want to leave Lord until
[1:29:54] till the change
[1:29:55] comes cuz one day the stone will be
[1:29:59] rolled away and we will meet in the air
[1:30:01] and until then until then Lord keep
[1:30:05] doing what you do in
[1:30:07] secret keep doing what you do hidden and
[1:30:12] unseen that we may be rewarded
[1:30:15] openly we love you Lord we thank you for
[1:30:18] this
[1:30:19] gift we commit ourselves to you now in
[1:30:21] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:30:24] amen
