TRANSCRIPT
========================================
matthew chapter 19 i'm going to begin with verse 4 and it is a difficult subject i'll say this um you know don't premeditate where i'm going with this subject matter even once i'm an hour into it don't assume assume the point i'm trying to make just let the lord speak to your heart matthew chapter 19 and we'll we'll just start with verse three the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife that they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh therefore god hath joined together let no man put asunder and so he hasn't exactly answered their question but he's provoked them to ask another one and they said unto him why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement to put her away he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so amen what a powerful statement from the beginning it was not so daniel chapter 4 and i was going to read more than what uh what i ultimately put on that slide so i just need to kind of check where i'm at here sorry so let's just read verses 33 and 34 daniel had already prophesied and interpreted the dream and of even nebuchadnezzar being a tree and being likened unto a tree and then it says and that this madness would come upon him daniel chapter 4 verse 33 the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men and did eat grass his oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven that means he slept out in the open and his body was wet with the dew of heaven until his hairs were grown like eagle's feathers so he had not cut his hair and it began to get so long it looked animal-like and his nails like bird's claws and at the end of the days of nebuch days i nebuchadnezzar now this is his testimony lifted up mine eyes into heaven and my understanding returned unto me and i blessed the most high and i praised and honored him that liveth forever whose dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation amen you may be seated if you could remember we have a youth meeting scheduled for the end of the month january 31st on sunday afternoon you're welcome to come and be a part of that especially the young people and we're looking forward to that time of fellowship together i'm continuing on the subject of a family and the lord just really in a very very direct way kind of focused me in on some particular things that are very fundamental and foundational for the understanding of family and even who we are and i have a very uh specific burden in my heart and i trust that as we just stay to what god has placed upon uh uh me to deliver that just that burden will be released and that he'll speak very particularly to your hearts and i want to just jump in uh to the subject matter but say this at the outset there's going to be different subject matters that we might that could be triggers to us that as soon as it comes up we start thinking in our minds well it's going to go this way or it's going to go that way but let's just try to withhold any any assumptions or any presumptions about where the subject matter may be going you say oh well he's read the scripture on marriage and divorce or he's read the he's talking about this he's talking about that let's just look at it as foundational because it's very simple very foundational in some ways i've pondered that it could come off as just being so elementary that the point could be missed but i trust god will speak to your heart through this and i just want to jump right in at genesis chapter 1 verse 27 and look at this principle of god when he began to create in the beginning and we know that in the beginning god created and we're using this a family verse 27 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them now this is a very unique description of man as he has been created man here is the hebrew word adam that became the proper name um for adam he is known as adam but the word adam it means mankind so speaking god created amen but this was representative of humanity and then this statement he says he creates them in the image of god in the likeness of god and it says male and female created he them so male and female are now raised up as a designation but it's tied to and connected to the image of god so male and female are going to manifest the image and the purpose of god and the word male in the hebrew comes from the root to remember to call to mind so there's something about this designation that is important the word for female as comes from the root to pierce or to a point or to bore through and so these are these are words that are given to the to mankind to humanity which is now in one uh one spiritual supernatural being it wasn't a fleshly being that would have male and female characteristics but it was a spirit being that uh was representative of humanity and within humanity there's going to be male and female and we know how brilliant deals with this very specifically about a masculine spirit a feminine spirit the spirit of adam and the spirit of the woman and so this designation that god gives the man or humanity this distinction is not made with respect to animal life there's no place where he says god created a male deer and he created a female deer this this is not made this is a distinction that's not made or not verbalized or written or pointed out and it signifies that god has a higher purpose for the creation of man these things can be assumed about animal life but when god creates man he actually mentions the distinction and he shows this division because it's significant about humankind and so god wanted to highlight these differences because the difference between male and female would have a greater utility and a greater expression in mankind than it did in animal life and this is the statement that i was that had inspired me to go into family relationships and the family the relationships among members of a family and what those roles and responsibilities are but god just kind of backed me up to say let's start with the foundation of where we derive our roles and responsibilities and and what comes first what precedes the assumption of certain offices and certain responsibilities as men or women or brother or sister and it's he says this in the right system the laodicean church age herein is now set forth the love of god he desired in love a family of his own this is what god wanted in the beginning he wanted a family of his own he says a family of sons sons like himself so this is something that god desired god did not just want to have a sandbox that he could play in uh he didn't view the world as as his own lego set uh or or playmobil he he looked at this as something that he wanted to have fellowship with to have union with he wanted to have a family god's desire in love love was his unction to have a family of his own sons like himself a family of sons and so when it comes to mankind he designates them male and female and so this is answering to god's desire to have a family like himself or that he could dwell in and be identified in and it's likely that there was male and female within a multiple let me say that way it's likely that there were multiple couples amongst animal life that there wasn't just one male deer and one female there it's likely that god created many males and many females when he created animal life because they were created and they were to fill up and replenish the seas and spread all over the earth but when it comes to mankind he doesn't create multiple males and multiple female it's one spiritual being that we see later becomes male and female in flesh and and this is significant there's only one couple one pair in genesis chapter five verse two it says male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created so now in the day that they're created initially they're one spirit as we've been looking at in genesis chapter two god takes that one spirit and puts it in a body a fleshly body then from that body god separates from that that physical unit and that fleshly unit god separates out the the other part the female part so that you have this representation of male and female and when god does this and he and he emphasizes it again in genesis chapter 5 verse 2 as we read all of humanity now is designed to come from a single couple this is how god established it in the beginning there would be one male and one female so if all come from the one male and the one female then every human that would have been upon the face of the earth would have all been part of one family and so you would have one family you would have one head of the family they would all descend from a common ancestor and that's what makes a family all the descendants of a common ancestor so if you only had one pair you only have one family there's no other species there's no other genus it's just a family and there's no variation among the rep of the expression there's no variance in the seed and if there's no variance in the seed there's no there's no differing dna this is just all the expression of one life one seed coming from one couple and it was god's desire then in establishing it this way that it was to be the seed of god as a family that you wouldn't have adam and the woman and they have a family and then you have somebody else and they become a family and that god is somehow divided and it creates rivalry and it creates distinctions and differences amongst all the the children of god in the garden of eden he envisioned man and woman and in the way that he laid it out and the orders and the commands he gave any child that would have come forth would have all been of the same family of the same dna and in genesis chapter 7 verse 3 speaking of animal life in the days when they were to be taken upon the ark it says the fowls and also of the air by sevens the male and the female and it mentions it prior uh about the beast it creatures upon the earth but this phrasing is what i wanted to identify to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth so this is the purpose of the male and the female to keep the seed alive upon the face of all the earth god wanted them to have fowl of the air by sevens male and female so you'd have the male and female couples and he says because we need male and female in order for that seed for that specie to be maintained and preserved in all the earth so that's the role of male and female it was to to replicate to pass on i even look at that in the sense the male is to remember or to call to mind that when a when a sun would come forth you would remember call to mind the very seed the dna the progenitor the ancestor from which it descended so male and females to keep seed alive now notice what it says in malachi chapter 2 verses 14 to 16. it says yet say ye wherefore because the lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou hast dealt treacherously yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant so again this is malachi dealing with the issue of divorce and in these men's hearts and these israelites hearts the fact that divorce was made attractive to them because they could put away one and marry another if they had to put it away and then they wouldn't have anyone to look out after them then they probably would just put up with the one that they had but it's because of the promise and what they felt was the exemption that they could have another that they dealt treacherously with their wife the wife of their youth the wife of the covenant and so they would put away one and marry another now he says this now catch how malachi now in teaching on rebuking israel and their the men for these practices he says did not he make one yet had he the residue of the spirit and wherefore one or why one that he might seek a godly seed therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the white wife of his youth he wants to use the image that god established in the beginning how that god created one man and one woman and the reason why he did it as instruction rebuke correction and instruction to men to say this is what god showed in the beginning this is why god did it so don't deal treacherously with the wife of thy youth and be harsh and bitter towards her for the lord god for the lord the god of israel saith that he hateth putting away for one covert violence with his garment and you deal harshly with your wife and you and you treat her wrong and you and you cover up uh the way that you treat your wife with this garment of justification i could put her away and take another one saith the lord of hosts therefore take heed your spirit that you deal not treacherously this this is a very uh a very direct and very specific challenge to the the corrupt heart of a man who would deal harshly and deal incorrectly with his wife and he's using again don't make any assumptions like some of you may be already there i know exactly where he's going with this well if it makes you uncomfortable i apologize but i'm not exactly sure where we'll end up so how can you know so and again if i'll say this now too there's there's no harshness in my heart there's no axe to grind there's nobody here i i that i'm conscious that needs correction so if it happens god's gonna do it with tender hands god's gonna do it the way that he intends to and the way he desires too the subject matter i'm facing is often preached with teeth clenched and with an anger and a and a sarcasm somehow suggesting uh that you know that the one you know they're throwing stones and they don't and they have a right to but this is not in my heart i'm not throwing stones i'm not judging i'm not trying to make a political point i'm not trying to uh make anybody feel uncomfortable i just want us to see these principles in the scripture and so god made this is how malachi's justifying what he's saying this is the inspiration god made one man and then one woman from that man and he says though he had the residue of the spirit you can see it there in verse 15 though he had the residue of the spirit even though he had the power because he's god to make many men and even though he had the power maybe to make one man and many women he didn't do that amen god could have done it but he didn't he made one man and then one woman from that man so he made one couple and one family and then he says this is why he did it why did he only have one man and one woman he ordained one male and one female so that he could have he says a godly seed so in this he said the purpose is that there would be some a holy offspring or a representation of god who is one who has all sorts of characteristics and attributes and manners of expression and he says if you vary that you don't get god that's what paul taught about christ there's many people preaching christ but there's not another so you can't have many christ you can only have one christ and so god wants to establish in the beginning that in order to have an image and likeness of him there has to be continuity of seed there has to be this harmony with the one who gives the life and so god says i want to show that this is how you produce the original this is how you replicate godliness and righteousness you stay in your channel and you and you stay behind the word of god he says he ordained only one male and one female so that it would have a righteous representation and he would have a godly seed that's how you produce a godly seed this is how that you have sons likened to god this is what the scripture is specifically saying it was one man and one woman so that the seed would be godly you know you didn't have adam and then have many women and then he could have children by all the different women that would not produce a godly family now that could happen in animal life and that can happen is we're taught in marriage and divorce you could have one buck and many does and you can have one uh one male and many females through time that that bring forth different children that's okay in animal life that's okay amongst those living creatures but when it came to man god says you're different i'm going to establish this pattern i'm going to bring it forth so that there can be holy offspring that the image of god could be properly replicated so this is an eternal principle of god this does not change this is a divine attribute of god to be expressed in the original family structure one man one woman one family so this takes us now to where we were reading in matthew chapter 19. he's asked a question can a man put away his wife for any cause jesus doesn't say yes or no to that we know that he continues but in his initial and he deals with it in terms of what cause one could put away a woman for but he establishes this in the beginning before answering the question let's not look at the exception to the rule let's not look at how god had to establish something else to deal with the condition of man because just by way of analogy it could be a poor one but we can talk about it later that there's some that say we want to have a garden of eden diet and let's just go back to the garden of eden well i don't have a garden of eden body right so a garden of eden bought a body uh probably do well on a garden of eating diet but this post garden of eden body i would probably do better on a kosher diet because i can at least say this is a diet that god gave fallen man right i'm not doctrinally pushing any kind of way to eat does anybody know burritos is kosher and um and so there's this is something that god gave men his children a way of living that dealt with the consequences of the fall and so you find that god gives laws and he gives commands and he makes exceptions and he does things that pattern and that help and they want to bring men to the place of regeneration and new birth and redemption but once that happens all things become new and then there's certain things that you're not bound under because the remedy is there or or the the the breach that caused that has been dealt with does that mean am i making sense in that regards so when when this these commandments were given and these things are given and jesus deals with exceptions says before we get so narrowed in on the exception let's go back to god's original general rule and why there was even an exception granted because of it and it says in matthew chapter 19 verses 4 to verse 6 and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female this is almost exactly like what malachi says in chapter 2. have you not read did he not make one and he says and said once the woman comes forth in genesis 2 he attributes this to god for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh he's using this image and raises this image up before them because now they're saying well can we do this and we have a right to do this and moses allowed us to do this he says all right before we deal with that let's go back to god's original representation and how did god set it forth in the beginning and to the jews they would have accepted yes that's exactly how we are taught in the word of god as moses did right that the man that there was male and female and he says wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let no man put asunder now just by doing that this strikes them in such a way to where it's like whoa okay now how do we deal with this because now he's saying that god made one man one woman one male one female they he made them a couple and that they were to be one flesh and that this is god's joining this is god's design this is god's desire and he says what god's joined let no man put asunder because now they're realizing okay this is something that god has blessed this is something that's in the image of god and then they say then we're not allowed to break that image i'm just just maybe dramatizing their thought process i'm not teaching that this is this is absolutely you know i'm not trying to make that point to you that that's the way that it is this is how it strikes them so they're saying well then why did moses tell us we could because they're picking up what jesus is laying down that this is what god wants then he's then how come we were permitted and so this is what jesus presents adam was joined to one wife and when he was joined to one wife this is the very thing that jesus is bringing up before them he says in the beginning were they not one was there not one man and one woman and what are you showing there was no one else for adam to marry if he put her away so i i don't there was no there was no other option for adam this is the picture malachi's painting this is a picture that jesus is painting in the beginning he made there was one couple in the beginning male and female not one male and many females so that he could just put her away if adam had put her away then he couldn't do what god wanted him to do we're just just speaking about the facts and the reality of it not trying to read into it or make a point by it but adam in the beginning only had one wife so if he put her away there was no one else he could join himself to and this is because god desired one family in agreement in harmony of one flesh one spirit and so that was that was what god's desire was now the message satan's eden brother banham says and so god knew that we would be here but then he put us in flesh so he would be contacted in order he could contact he became one of us when he become jesus christ the son of god the fullness of the manifestation of god that's a beautiful picture he's just painted in a few sentences just a couple sentences just how beautifully he has painted how that god put us in flesh so he could fellowship with us and it's in the flesh that all of his attributes can be made manifest if you only were a perfect spirit god would always be thinking man i'm a healer i just wish there was some way to show them i could heal if you never had a spirit that could be broken like a broken heart he's like i'm a comforter i really wish they knew this about me but i guess they'll never know but god wanted all that he was to be expressed so this is part of his divine plan so he says therefore that was god's purpose to display his attributes in fellowship and this is really this is kind of setting kind of laying out some of the pieces of what i was indicting in the beginning of last week when i began to come to this place of a family in their and the relationships among themselves express god and express his character he desired and love a family of his own so that was god's purpose to display his attributes and fellowship then he says when i was in my father i knew nothing about it but when i became his son and was born of him i was an attribute a part of my father so now he's looking at this someone who begets and someone who genders a child and you're a part of your father and as children of god we are part of god's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have fellowship one with the other with each other and with god as a family of god upon the earth that's what we are and that was god's purpose at the beginning all born by one incorruptible seed all born by the word of god by the will of god and become a family of god upon the earth that was god's purpose at the beginning so why did he make one couple what was the reason that he might seek a godly seed or a godly family that he could have a family of god upon the earth that was god's purpose at the beginning yes sir that's what god wanted at the beginning and since that's what god wanted at the beginning he establishes and foreshadows how that is accomplished in the beginning so now we're looking at this expression that he made man male and female and so these are designations that were essential to the image of god so what god does is he takes mankind and he divides it and he makes a division and so this is a divine division if you hate math we can at least accept this divine division and so in genesis chapter 2 verses 22 to 24 and the rib which the lord god had taken from man he chose the rib for a reason or he expresses that it was the rib so that we could understand he took a building material of a for a dwelling place he took a part of man that was likened to certain things in the in the temple in the tabernacle and he made a woman he took the rib from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now born of my bones and flesh of my flesh the essence of my essence she shall be called woman the capital w because she was taken out of man now what god has done is he's brought this division he separates male and female so now each hold very specific fleshly characteristics and so god establishes a difference between not among between the sexes god establishes this and this and so we'll just use maybe our our english words that are derived from latin to describe this when we fill out an application or someone ask you what is your sex and that refers to are you male or female that's because god in the beginning divided humanity between male and female there was one male one female there wasn't another division to create a another expression in this we use the term the to denote the the sex of the individual this is something that god did so just in our latin to the noun sex it speaks of a male or female or collectively male and females and so the this comes from the latin word sexist not sexist but sexist which means a state of being either male or female so that's your choice or maybe not your choice that that's the reality just walking right in thank you that's exactly what we wanted and that comes from and it's associated with and comes from the latin secco or seques which literally this is what it means in the very language that we use division or cut in half so the very word sec comes sex comes from the root to cut in half not into turds half right so what he's done is he's a division it's half of the race or two parts binary two parts and it's related to the word sikar which means to divide or cut or sectio which is division so this is something that that sex refers to in terms of male or female it's a division of humanity he divides them into two because it's a cut in half you had one male one female there's now a half of what humanity was originally and so this is by divine design this is uh this is according to a divine desire in order to fulfill the purpose of man that's laid out in genesis 1 28 be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth so once god has brought forth an expression that is embodied in a creation of male and female he now begins to speak to those characteristics and attributes that are in there and he begins to say be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth because man could not be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth unless there had been a division between male and female and then they step into their calling genesis chapter 2 verse 24 as we continue to read verse 24 is anybody nervous everybody comfortable therefore god has taken us through this process woman man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh this is one family still it's not the way that we understand families today there's there's no way in this original plan that you would have a german irishman right it wouldn't happen you'd have a godman that's what you would have a godly seed and so in this the culmination now as we come to verse 24 he has now taken man or he's taken man which was adam the male and female and adam who was uh who becomes at this time of this division the man adam becomes the ish so the male becomes a man and i want to phrase it that way the male becomes a man and the female is expressed as woman isha so now there's a greater expression that the male and female have god calls them in the beginning god created a man and he made them male and female but now the male and female have become something else not just the sex but now it relates to a role it relates to a purpose there's a greater expression of husband and now in husband and wife the male has become a husband the woman is now expressed as the female is now expressed his wife so it's not just being male and being female but now there's an identity that comes the male becomes a man the man becomes a husband the female becomes a woman the woman becomes a wife this is all being expressed in the beginning now the animal life whatever it was there was still a division be in the in each each specie each family of animal where you'd have the male and female and so they could be uh you could have either sex of a particular living creature or beast but no beast ever carried the designation or the or stepped into the office of husband or wife so they had male and female and that's an important distinction but now because god made the difference in mankind that he would say there's male and female he wants to further develop what those roles and responsibilities would be or what the image that male holds and what the image of female holds and as we see it in its genesis or its seed form there's something that it can become he brings it out in genesis chapter two male becomes man female becomes woman and that's not so with animal life there's not a husband buck there's not a wife doe they're just they're just ordered by their sex so the male and female they had some they had some retained some attribute or characteristic you could call it genetic attribute something there in them physically that god had attributed to them that develop into certain characteristics that are suited for their calling in the beginning god made a male and female male and female be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth god has to have order in a way a division in order to bring that forth to fulfill scripture and so as we might say it in very simple terms that the male had a genetic chromosome the female had a genetic chromosome that their dna was structured a certain way to where you could tell in their base cells and in their cellular structure one's a male one's a female and the male is the xy chromosome and the female being the x chromosome and these are distinct biological differences between the male and the female and the male get comes into um becomes the man the female becomes the woman and the word each male it means it literally means to show masculinity the male becomes a man to show the worth of a man to have the the appropriate qualities of a man and so this is what this is what the this is what was in the original this is the original expression and that's why they use the phrase when you emasculate some a man what you do is you take away his ability his virility his ability to create or procreate and that strips him of what he is as a man it takes away his masculinity right and and just even scientifically as they as they look at how these very real literal factual in some ways i could say tangible differences or characteristics of a man on the molecular level the cellular level would make something what it is they say this man is an xy that y is a dominant chromosome and it carries the gene that's going to signal to the embryo as it's being formed to grow to become a male and it's that it's that very uh programming that dna that chromosome that signals that embryo to grow physical characteristics that relate to masculinity we're able to understand just exactly what's taking place this is how god has structured it and so the most significant physical differences between male and female and and i i guess i say i'm not trying to be careful i just it's easy to do this but the the main the most significant physical differences relates to the purpose of the male or the female in reproduction of seed so you could have you could have you could have men that are short you could have women that are tall and there's different characteristics that you might say not all women um have blonde hair and not all men have uh no hair that's not how it works but there's certain physical characteristics immutable to to the the to the male and to the female in those most significant and outstanding differences and really what makes them different is the role of those differences in reproduction of the seed or to have a family and so you can be so there's and let me say it this way maybe i might just need to read the statement but i want to kind of set it up so you can be male and that gives you the the ability the potential of expressing the attributes that are appropriate for of a man you're female that means you possess certain potentials that have properly developed give you the ability to be a woman to express a woman and there's certain things that are apparent and so from the from the very birth or even before they're born right nowadays they just do a blood test and they can tell you they do a blood test and they tell you before they're ever born well they're not ready to declare yet so the most the significant difference is now you still have these differences but now there's something that they need to become and notice what brother bam says in the message if god be with us you can't expect a baby to be born a man what is what does it go what is it going to be a boy or a girl and i used to have kind of maybe it was a dad joke before i actually became a dad but it just showed my great potential they said do you know if you're having a boy or a girl and i'd say oh yeah absolutely yeah is there another that we could have i was really showing that i was dad material because it's going to be a boy or a girl and i believe the rule is you can't lose you can't lose having children boy or girl you can't lose they're a gift of god you can't expect a baby to be born a man it's got to grow to it and he says from this image that we see in nature we grow into christ a full statue not somebody get converted overnight and tomorrow go preach the gospel this is the spiritual principle we grow up into manhood into the statue of christ so you're not born again in a fully placed fully uh endued empowered son of god who can just start preaching you're born a child of god and then you mature and grow into manhood an office a maturing so you could be you're born a male and then you mature to a man you're born a female you mature to a woman he says and you must be born again tonight you're a sinner and this is what he says in the morning of the before he makes this other statement so you see this is emphasis in his mind on that particular day tonight you're sinner tomorrow you're the manifested sons of god so the manifested sons of god speaks of adoption so today you're a sinner you get born again and tomorrow you're a manifested son of god wherever i'm specifically identifying that there's leaven in that understanding without qualification without proper teaching you take this idea that you're a sinner then you're converted and then you're everything an expression that a son of god ought to be he says he says this babies are not born men they're born babies and grow to men a baby is born male or female and then grows to be a man or woman so there's a spiritual application to this development but what is it that's controlling what is it that rules there's a dna blueprint within that seed that produces a male there's a dna blueprint within that within that that that combination embryo if i can say it that way that produces a female and from the very beginning that it begins to form and even through childhood and through adolescence there's in the physical development of the male there's increased testosterone that matures the body to produce the characteristics of a man and the abilities of a man it's this very specific uh uh you know a specific amount but this testosterone at the levels the greater levels that work upon the the cellular structure the dna the program that cause it to mature and grow from a male a boy or a baby into a man same for a female increased estrogen matures her into a woman and that's what they call sexual maturity that as it matures it comes to a place and what is sexual maturity the ability to have children to produce children and so this is these this is the order that god established that every single human being has operated on for thousands of years it's the language that we even use it's the ideas that were that were passed out and handed down in all cultures because this is expressed literally this is how it's happened so now brother branham in the message accepting god's provided way at the end and he makes this statement after he's in the context of him telling the story of going up beyond the curtain of time and are you familiar with that so this is a translation vision that brother branham had of of those souls just beyond that veil who are waiting uh for the climax the culprit culmination and the meeting in the air and as he described he says there couldn't be sin in that dimension the men and women so they're they're men and women he says those women were hugging me and they were women but there was no possibility of ever being sin again see the glands of our bodies will be changed there we're different we're different sex now because that's for reproducing the world and our marriage to bring children so here's brother branham he's describing something but he gives us principles that are relevant today to understand why we are the way we are now but there'll be no more need of that there'll be no more children born and i'll come to a scripture lord willing in a little bit to back that up we won't have sex glands in the new world see not at all and it's in the way that we have them now the use the utility the function those things he's saying that that's not going to be needed there so he says but yet the woman will be a woman in stature she'll look like a woman she'll act like a woman she'll be a woman so will men be men but they'll be no more male and female among them he says in that way so it helps us understand the very the very reason for male and female the very thing that god is setting forth the very uh uh way the way god made him is i'm making him that male and female because i want to have a family i desire to have a family so i've got to have these characteristics to have a family and then once he has that family once they've matured once they've cut his place and he gives us these new bodies we don't need those distinctions in that way and this is powerful and them glands won't be in so there'll be no way at all for satan to ever play another trick on them wow man i i i can't even begin to describe what this image creates when you begin to think about god and his program and his plan and how he led satan just walked right into the trap and that god had everything laid out that no matter what satan tries to do it's checkmate and he said let's start all over let's play again and satan starts a game and and and god makes a move and then satan logs into a different account plays expert level and plays god's move to see what the computer is going to do that's what some of y'all do when you play chess online right you just play the other guy's move and then the computer tells you how to respond the devil's doing everything he can to trick and to cheat and he always loses so this just this one statement alone establishes how the in the beginning god has set forth two sexes just two and then clearly defines the general roles that each hold but specifically identifies the ultimate purpose what he wanted to do have a family to bring forth and so their genetic origins determined whether they would become a man or a woman this is a very specific gender construct that god sets forth and so the very use of the word so we've been using sex to describe male sex female sex and that gave clearly defined purpose man and woman and so the word gender because god has set this forth the word gender scripturally means kinder species or character a race or stock the the gender of something would speak of the order the family the species and it comes from the root word gene so i began to think about what this what god is setting forth in having a gender gene means to give birth or to beget so the idea of gender was originally constructed in terms of reproduction that that's the purpose of the whole idea of a gender what are you able to gender you know you're a male okay if you're a male then you're a a a human because there was no homo sapien necessarily in terms of the way that they had it it was just a man in the image of god right that's what god had and so if you had a man a male in the image of god then you had to have a female in the image of the of god that would produce gender another child of god so that that's what gender relates to it relates to your role in reproduction gender's not you know i feel like a burrito let's go get a burrito right it's it's not some kind of feeling or phenomena that you experience in the beginning it's it's connected with giving birth or begetting in leviticus chapter 19 verse 19 he says ye shall keep my statutes and notice he says thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with the diverse kind thou shalt not sow thy field with mingle seed neither shall a garment mingled of linen and wool and come upon thee what does this reflect it reflects god's desire this is god's nature god says this is my law and this is expressing my original intent and design in the beginning you should not let your cattle gender that means to breed or reproduce that's what gender relates to breeding reproducing he says you shall not gender with a diverse kind do not soul filled with mingle seed that's a forbidden hybrid mixture to take different seeds and combine them and join them together don't take this animal and breed it with another animal of another kind that makes good and evil something that's proper pleasing that'll produce the proper image but then when you mix it with something else what do you get you get evil you get a different reflection and that's when you have this hybrid of knowledge of good and evil something is produced that's not like the original it's not like either of the originals and i would love to emphasize this to a greater degree but it has been a theme through all these different parts on how and if it resonates with you you feel free to say a hearty amen with each view of these scriptures the original sin becomes more and more understandable and becomes more and more clear to the point you're almost like why has there ever been a controversy and with an understanding what the original sin is just based upon this scripture what we've been trying to express to this point in this morning service the original sin shattered god's design because the woman gendered with a diverse kind it shattered god's desire he's he's to have a family a family of sons like himself and the female that was to take the role of producing another son of god has done what has gendered with a different with a different creature and that cannot produce an adam that cannot produce the mankind that adam was though it may have been in part what adam was originally but now it's a combination of other dnas so from that moment on that souls a weakness into what we call today humanity that allows for a lot of different things that were not originally contemplated in the beginning can you follow that the the injection of another dna and then the thousands of years of a nurture upon that can produce expressions that god never intended in the original it's a weakening it's a it's a it's a it's a changing of things and so again let me emphasize this gender as we would use that phrase sex would be male and female but as they come to man and woman and they're identified with masculinity and feminism in the good way femininity is that better i need to do some exercises uh before i find myself i have a lisp when i preach i get my words all mixed up there's things i've said years ago that still haunt me i lay in bed going is that still on the archives should i write the brother and say you know i kind of slipped up there and i did come out right could you just put blank spot on tape so forgive me so gender denoted the role and responsibility of each sex considering god's purpose for creation so you see how these things are connected in god's eye scripturally now if if someone wants to debate whether or not that's fair or equitable we can do that as it relates to society or or laws or governments but we're just looking at it how god sees it how god established it and and and that may create a moral paradigm for us as believers who believe the bible is infallible in the true the word of god and that may create a value system for those of us who believe this to be god's word but we we need to be careful just how arrogant and bitter and degrading we can be with truth we're just simply pointing out what what god has established and what we believe to be the ultimate i mean let's just be honest guys did god ordain you to smoke a crack to do marijuana to drop acid you did it was that in the original design so let's not get too self-righteous with our past and and things and just realize sin is sin right the the defiling of the human conscience and the morality of human nature is the design of satan has expressed itself in multitudes of ways but god is the only redeemer and and we're going back to the beginning to see a promise that god in the beginning did not intend for a body to have cancer well then i believe this body can be delivered of cancer god in the beginning did not make a man to fear so therefore i believe fear can be cast out and then i take every promise of god to say no matter what satan wants to produce in this end time i believe that we have a covenant that has restored us back to the beginning even beyond pentecost whatever sin whatever misunderstanding whatever vileness whatever existed then exists now but god just does not want to take me back to 33 a.d he wants to take me back to the beginning and so these gender roles relate to god's purpose now the modern construction the modern definition is it continues to change tries to make gender a personal sense like this is how i feel or a personal identity of being a man or a woman isn't that right this is what is kind of being debated and discussed and kind of evolving is that gender is not something that's defined listen it's an incoherent argument with a lot of contradictions but i'll try to summarize it that gender is now something that on one hand is a social construct so but then it's an internal feeling that someone has okay it's how someone feels inside and it's immutable and it's it's what they want to be but they you want to be a man but there's really no such thing as a man never mind basically i'm just kind of doing it to to make a point it's a sense of something it's something fluid can't quite put her finger on it in one sense you know there's it's a gender is not related biologically it's not it's not something programmed in you it's not it's not an immutable truth and written in stone but if that's how you feel in your heart then it is immutable and it is written in stone and so this is this is how one can feel i i i may i may genetically be a man i may uh i may by appearance be and biologically be a female i may have an x only x x chromosome but i feel like a man there's just this is what gender has become but in the beginning god established a gender order it was a perfect eden and that eden itself and all the laws that god gave it in the word that god gave it denoted the role of male and denoted the role of female the role the identity of gender and the gender of construct in the beginning was very clear there was no ambiguity and so if gender is a social construct if gender is the result of environment and culture and all these different things then god in the beginning created an environment created a culture gave a word and established a god society to have a godly seed and that determined what gender roles were and i think even the the staunchest advocate or atheist or advocate for certain rights would have to agree that biblically that's the way that god laid it out so brother branham says this and a greater than solomon is here put everything in its place and then operate in decency and in order you'll find god is the god of order and he'll bring the thing right up then saying it's about gifts operating in the church and different measures of different gifts but this is god's this is a principle of god put everything in its place then operate in decency and in order this is what god wanted in the beginning you'll find god is a god of order not a god of disorder god is a god of order one one flesh one spirit one couple one son and then and this this way of replication to where you're not trying to figure out who's who and who's what god is a god of order determination division he knows what it is because god in the beginning in the beginning god created a family and this family was to manifest his image in the initial introduction it's male and female male becomes man female becomes woman this is god's gender order this is god's original image that was in the beginning but now in the end think of where this is going because that was god's perfect eden now what do you have satan's eating so in the end satan is trying to perfect his eden god wanted to have a family a family of sons likened to himself so if that's the ambition of god satan said i will be like the most high so satan then does not want to have a family in the image of god he wants to have a family in the image of what dog i mean satan he wants to have a family in the image his own image so in isaiah 14 12 how art thou fallen from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning it likens him to being an angel that was once in heaven how about cut down to the ground so he's this angelic being that's been cast down to earth and notice his description which did us weaken the nations how did satan weaken the nations there speaks of humanity how did he weaken humanity one couple and he weakens it by taking a serpent which is of a different kind hybrid and it's by that hybriding that completely blends in with all humanity today the whole earth is populated by one blood there's nobody that's going to take a 23 and me and say get this there's not one ounce of cane in my family history may not be an ounce but i'll tell you there's a skosh of it somewhere it's got to be there because that's how the whole earth was probably that's how humanity was weakened you read the bible and you begin to read this man lived 900 years this man lived 800 years this man lived 700 years and you find that this true stock from adam had a body that was under a law that they couldn't live a whole day but as that serpent blood mixed with the blood of adam it weakened it to where finally they're dying in their hundreds and where is it today they just reduced the life expectancy to it's around 70 even the united states would it weaken blood weaken nations man man was under a law he'd have to die no man ever lived out those those thousand years but you don't see men living past 120 a week in the nations brother bennett called in the church age book the degradation of humanity by intermingling the seed so now that this has been introduced into humanity satan is wanting now by getting control over the design and entering into this getting access to flesh this is he wants to produce his image now if you could just stay with me it's not late right we're good okay the lamb's book of life god put satan up there one time as an angel so keep that in mind which he was the son of the morning and he took the good things of god and perverted them into evil there's the good and evil this is where satan has come in and so i want to point this out and i feel like i am losing time but let me just take this statement maybe another one to emphasize this brother branham identifies in the scripture places satan as an angel and him being an angel he is a being that is spiritual he is a spirit and being a spirit being the angels are not made with the sex or gender they the angels have neither now though they can manifest in a form that is masculine or male to to embody their uh their uh their authority we know and we are taught that angels are neither male nor female in in the sense of god created man and woman and created had male and female man and woman so the beca and also let's just say this way satan being a spirit being an angel there there's no use or utility to sex and gender because angels are spiritual beings there's no uh there's no uh sex and gender relate to biological origin angels are not biological it relates to biological purpose and function so angels don't have either of those characteristics he's not biological he's not physical therefore he doesn't identify with the sex or gender i was just wondering if i could just close right there because that's question and answer is part 1 1964 satan was the most beautiful angel so now i'm i i should slow down a little bit satan now is wanting to produce something in his image he's gained access to the original humanity that's now fallen and being degraded so satan has control over and notice what happens satan was the most beautiful angel he was a cherubim that overshadowed him so that was his characteristic he says look how different women are getting now to what they used to be how many remembers reading of pearl bryant now he says pearl brian and i've looked her up and she's a very homely person and it was i think a 22-year-old girl that was murdered in missouri and then brother batman in certain places refers to pearl bryan but he also refers to uh pearl white and clara beau or bao claire beau uh and and how they're the most beautiful women and he uses them as examples of beautiful women then and what they are now and i think sometimes he he kind of got some stories mixed up songs that were written in books that were written of different ones but his point is this let's not get hung up on the fact that there was some kind of conflation there with names of people and their and their stories he's trying to make a point let's see your hands from your older people see supposed to be the most beautiful woman in america i don't think there's anyone here who's going to say they remember pearl white or clara beau i thought eliza raised her hand silent film buff now they're supposed to be the most beautiful women in the world if you could maybe just put up the next slide i'll finish i'll finish reading here any little teenage snickel fritz on the street would be twice as pretty as she is now twice as she now he says so there's pearl white and clara beau he's saying that you could just find some rando on the street now right and he'd say they'd be pretty to these two and i'd say i think he's right and he's attributing this to the fact that satan has taken a hold of the woman and he's designed her and now she is the most beautiful specie she is the most beautiful sex of men and women he says you look in nature it's not like that which cardinal is the really beautiful red one male and it's virtually like that in all in all classifications though there's some variances and exceptions to that rule but it's the male that is the most beautiful the most attractive and that's why it causes a question when a man wants to be the most beautiful in the room so just using that that image there let me read this and we can we can uh take that off you think about this then it shows i want just using this slight example and i may have been better for me to use more examples and more statements satan is influencing the design the expression of the woman she's more beautiful now than she was before and i'm and brother bram attributes that to satan because satan's trying to achieve his eden but he's not just going to stop at this acceleration of beauty think about they and you've been doing it since this whole thing started the gender politics that captivate so many people and the gender controversies that become uh very prominent in election cycles and that mean a lot to very near and dear to certain people's hearts and it's remarkable in how much it dominates air time and can dominate even believers minds and hearts they get all wrapped up into it they're rolling up their sleeves and they want to march on washington we're on a list now and uh all because of the rights of 0.5 of the population we need to take a step back and remember satan's probably behind that too create a controversy and get you riled up about it i'm just gonna i took this out of my notes but i'm just gonna say it trump ran on the platform of make america great again were we not taught by brother branham that she will never be great again just throwing that out there but this is uh this was in the this was in an article called gender revolution the many ways society makes a man so there's a gender revolution this was in the 2019 january 2019 national geographic so i just didn't pull this off somebody's blog america culture is lurching toward a gender-neutral society so this is where america is headed no wonder he said she's basic she's condemned she's lost she'll never rise again she rejected god in 1956. you can go back and find in the beginning of 1956 here i took it out of my notes and i'm going to give it to you anyways he says she's blessed america is he says he says i'm american he says you know what it's good to be american he says you're proud of me and said you know what that's true because she's blessed he doesn't say that again like as america rejects god in 1956 she's lost she's condemned shall never raise again he says that's thus saith the lord but what does satan want to do create a controversy and we jump into it and we wade into it and we get all riled up and we get motivated by it we become identified by it and it's all part of satan's plan satan's the kind of guy that that pokes you and pokes the other guy and then backs up and watches the other turn i say did you punch me did you poke me and he just sits back and laughs because everybody's fighting and they forgot the real cause so the gender neutral society one that has moved so far from anatomy-based definitions of men and women that the u.s department of justice education and defense in 2016 affirmed anti-discrimination policies policies that recognize a person's self-assigned gender identity regardless of the sex ticked on a birth certificate so listen that's just the facts and this is government this is justice education and defense allowing certain people who choose to identify on paper something other than what they were admit originally presenting at birth and saying we're going to let you do that now i'm not getting all angry about that even though i don't see i i see that there's something fundamentally uh a myth there something anti-scripture but if the department of defense wants to allow someone who uh who enlists in the army to be able to say that they're neither male or female the army can do that if they want doesn't mean it's right it doesn't change truth and doesn't mean i have to hate the army the armed service or the person who enlisted because it's contrary to truth so then it says this because it's exploring this gender revolution and the impact on young men it says a boy cannot rely on the traditional roles of men and women for an idea of what it means to be a man in the name of equality gender stereotypes have been turned inside out or repudiated so what are they then called stereotypes uh you know norms or modalities or certain prisons and things well this was a constructive man and this is society and this is judeo-christian values and they try to put them in the sense they let's tear all those things down let's let people be what they want to be now this is remember satan moved his seat from paris in the invasion of the united states and moved it to hollywood so satan is satan is the one that is bri these policies are coming to existence under his watch so to speak and it was brother martin jones i appreciate him sharing this with me because i don't even know if i would have seen it had you not shared it so thank you brother martin i'll blame you for going into the after hour the house of representatives approved new rules for the 117th congress and these new rules require gender neutral terms i might have put the phrase up there um it says in the interest of so in the interest of inclusion and diversity the changes honor all gender identities by changing pronouns and familial relationships and the house rules to be gender-neutral and so it in in the implementation and doing this for the purposes of inclusion and diversity and so we're trying to be sensitive we want to be tolerant we want to be we want to be welcoming so we don't want to use gender term terms that are distinguishing we don't use gender neutral terms so that we don't offend one percent of the population less than one percent i'm so this this principle and i'm just stating the facts i i'm not trying to agitate it or aggravate this argument at all by stating that it requires the removal and bans the use of male or female pronouns in any reference to man or woman so notice just how far it goes it prohibits and i'll read legal references in federal cold code to family roles and genders such as father mother son daughter brother sister husband wife so what's just been eradicated the family's gone it's it's gender neutral person they them and so there's there's no way to designate within the family what role one would have as a father as a mother as a son a daughter a brother sister husband wife now everybody doing all right anybody doing all right are you doing good yes a kind of a slow process here i recognize that now follow me because this is this is probably where we start uh looking at this in a different light this can be very very offensive to a a conservative christian because this does not conform to ideals of a traditional family and and male and female and just the reality scientific reality biological reality our christian reality our revelation all these things and there's a lot of reasons why we could be offended at this but let me say this it's not wrong just because as a body of a a congress body they want to acknowledge that a man may feel like he's a woman that's not what makes it wrong they want to acknowledge and be inclusive and acknowledge that someone may not uh a woman may feel like or identify as a man they want to be sensitive to an individual's personal gender identity they said the best way that we can make someone feel comfortable is we'll write laws that do not refer to a husband in the criminal code we'll write laws that do not refer to mother of a child will not really refer to brother sister aunt uncle cousin all those different things all the things that identify who one is in a family in relation to another ancestor and in that bloodline going to remove labels of husband labels of wife pronouns that relate to father and mother it strips it of that identity but we want to do it because we want to be sensitive to others who don't identify according to those that construct and so i i don't know if if that means if a man identifies as a woman and wants to be called a mother if we're sorry we can't do that but essentially they're wanting to honor at least on some rudimentary level that there can be in somebody's mind a difference that they can elect and choose to be now that's not wrong just because someone feels that way like the fact that they feel that way that's why it's wrong and and it's wrong for them to cater to that and make these changes that's not why it's wrong i'll get to why it's wrong here in a moment but i want to look at what we read in daniel chapter 4 verse 33 and i'm glad we read it in the beginning because the bible says that he was driven from men this means he lost all thought of a man he's not thinking like a man anymore he's been driven from it he's lost rational thought and his mind now being driven from a man he's not identifying as a man anymore he identifies as an animal and he lives like an animal he eats grass like an oxen his hair grows out like a beast his claws grow out like a bird he's no longer identifying and behaving and acting and dressing and living and eating and sleeping as would a man he's been driven from men so he's no longer in his right mind he's thinking and feeling like an animal so he acts like an animal this is a condition that scientifically is known as insania zoanthropica it's an insane it's a mental condition where one is identifying as an animal it's a pro it's when a person thinks they're an animal so they act like an animal they feel like an animal they identify as an animal so they act like an animal maybe we're more familiar with lycanthropia right right werewolves somebody who identifies thinks and acts like they're a wolf so this is a condition that's known to man we can even look in the bible and see an instance where even according to prophecy a man would no longer act and behave like a man but he would identify with a as an animal and begin to live and eat and act and and allow himself to come into the image and look like an animal where he lost all connection with rational thought and what a man is supposed to be so it's not wrong for congress to say in the event that one might identify as a bird we are not going to require that nails need to be cut in congress grow them out as long as you want we're going to allow we're not going to require that men have short hair we're not going to require like they're not going to impose these restrictions within their congress they're going to let anybody act and live how identify however they want and we'll go ahead and adopt some inclusive language so that nobody feels out and since we won't we don't want to leave you out we'll leave everybody out and we'll all be out right so it's not so much inclusion as is everyone is excluded i don't want to be called a mother and neither should you be able to be called a mother so i won't be called anything will be they in them and we'll all be they and them in person there's no chairman anymore it's chairperson i'm trying there was one that was really really funny and i just forgot it probably could've used it right now so it's not wrong because of that reality it's wrong because it diminishes godly roles that were originally established for a man and a woman it's wrong because it flies in the face of what god originally ordained for a man of war it's wrong because it doesn't accord to scripture it's wrong because it repudiates that god has established a man a male to be a man he's established that a female become a woman he's given them the roles and identities that relate to womanhood so then think about this if you have stripped in our language now in our code in our laws we're going to a general neutral society and now the role of man the role of woman and sexes has become an abolish and now you have just a gender neutrality that's to be in our language and in our images and in our laws in the way that we establish things what image is this in it's in the image of satan that is neither male nor female it is the image of an angel that's not made to reproduce and has no gender so satan's agenda no wonder it would climax in this confusion and in this kind of representation satan wants a family like himself so he wants everyone to then leave the image of god and to clearly define roles that god established for his family and have everybody shut their mouths and change their image so that they can they can come under his image that we're all angelic-like without gender without roles in reproduction where's brother hughes when you need him matthew 22 29 30 just to emphasize this jesus answered and sent him ye do air not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god for in the resurrection they neither marry nor given in marriage but are as the angels of god in heaven in other words in the resurrection man and woman will not enter into a carnal relationship they will not have natural affections they will not procreate they will be as angels they are neither male nor female they are neither man or woman because they do not need to gender they do not need to procreate and so this is a scripture showing us that satan and other angels and angelic beings are not male or female they are not men or women they are not tasked with the roles of reproducing so satan's agenda is to make all mankind be as himself think about that and to be gender neutral have no clearly established roles that a male should enter into no clearly established roles that a female should enter to enter into however you want but that's not what the truth is that's not what the rea the subject objective reality is each can do whatever they want and then creates on the on the whole level we are all just moving within some spectrum and we can we can identify as a man we can identify as a woman very interesting and satan's design cannot produce a true man satan's design cannot produce a true woman cannot produce a true family he's tearing down the divine design that pleases god it's doing this to keep man back from the true image that god intended there's there's places in the bible you can see the importance of language when they took the hebrew children they wanted to teach them the tongue of the chaldeans why did they teach them the tongue of the cow dance so they would assimilate into the culture of the chaldeans you changed the language you changed the names you changed the identity you're stripping away the very power and purpose that god has and my point is this what happened in the 117th congress is not satanic and this is the fulfillment of prophecy no it just expresses what satan is trying to achieve spiritually it's the climax of his eden and it shows what he's trying to oppose spiritually and what all the distractions and all the side tracks and all the things that are taking place is to try to keep us from assuming the proper roles that god called us to as man and as woman and being if you want to look at in a spiritual sense and a collective body says keep us from being the bride of christ by distracting us with the wrong kind of ideals that are being lifted up in normative christianity it's not that it's being lifted up in the church of satan but even the image that's projected over pulpits and over in teachings that relay in books and different things paints the wrong picture of a man the word paints the correct picture of a man and a woman a type satan's agenda the creation of male and female when god established in the beginning was for the fulfillment of mankind's purpose they were to complement each other god's eden begins with clearly established sexes clearly established genders clearly establish roles and identities for the purpose of family amen satan's eating ends with man and woman being abolished the phrases confused or even in some cases completely rejected god's eden began one way we see satan's eating ending another way so when we look out at what's in the world today we can look what brother branham said in matthew chapter 19 verses 7 and 8. why did moses then give us the right give us a writing of divorcement to put her away he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives why did god grant men the right to divorce their wives because they left off thinking like adam they left off it was the hardness it's the harshness this is why malachi says you deal treacherously you brew you cover up your your hardness and your bitterness and your meanness with the garment and jesus is going right back to that all right back to the beginning i'm just pointing out what it was in the beginning and what jesus is saying in the beginning it was one man one woman adam didn't put her way and could choose from another well then why did god why did moses allow us to divorce you want to know why god allowed you to divorce because men aren't men anymore they said well that's really harsh brother aaron i i know a really good brother that had to divorce his wife i'm not commenting on where things are today i'm commenting on what happened thousands of years ago conditions have changed that's why brother brahm says and the bible says that god allowed it and god recognized it as righteous that's why god granted the exemption so to speak but from the beginning it was not so from the beginning in the beginning one man one woman this is what god lifted up and i just want to i'm not going to finish where i was i want to come to this i'm just going to interrupt we'll come back to these other things as i close here when brother branham preaches marriage and divorce anybody heard that before just a few um it is so it's heavy why is it heavy and it's so direct and it's so cutting and he sews little things in there throughout i'm i'm not get to the real woman's place of true sisters and he's pointed out but really brother bam is just identifying satan's created a really bad mess really really nasty mess and that's why things are mixed up and that's why things are the way they are and he comes down to it he says you know paul in the new testament said because of the divorce condition and he says it wasn't so from the beginning how paul was able to give a grace to the church it wasn't so from the beginning but moses was permitted and god recognized it righteous and paul had a right when he found his church in that condition he says now you believe this to be true and believe it to come from god and by the vindication of his cloud and his message that's brought me this far should not god upon that mountain to permit me to do the same thing to suffer you to go on the way you are and do it no more now this is specifically relating to man becoming husband woman becoming wife and how that satan has allowed those things to be confused and messed up and torn apart so as he relates to that part he's saying would not god give me the grace to suffer you to go on the way you are and he says go to your wives and live in peace for the hours late now what i want to emphasize is god has a grace in terms of the marital relationship but he and and the complications that have taken place in that but he's not going to back off being a man he's not going to back off you being a woman these things are immutable these things cannot change had god wanted to allow for man to identify as a woman and for a woman to identify as a man and have it be turned on its head and say it's okay then it would have been written in the scripture god would have given us prophets the ability to do so so when god is dealing with the conditions of the world as they exist today in satan's evening he gives the grace to liberate a man from a situation that breaks the image that god has but you can be as a man still in the image of god though you may not be able to be the husband though you may not be able to be the father you can still be a man in the image of god though you may not be able to be a wife though you may not be able to be a mother you can still be a woman in the image of god so god says don't leave those roles that you're in don't break them they still represent something very pure it's something that god can bless and something that can be righteous he says live in peace in this late hour the coming of the lord is at hand we haven't got time to break these things up don't you dare try to do it again i'm only speaking to my congregation i say amen i'm part of that one but if you're married and god bore me witness on that mountain that i could say this a supernatural revelation because of the open of the seven seals and this is the question in god's word let them go on in as they are in sin no more it wasn't so from the beginning that's right it wasn't so and it will not be at the end but under modern conditions listen god knows the modern conditions we are under he's acknowledging them he's saying i can give a grace there's a word for you under modern conditions as god's servant i won't call myself as prophet but i believe i maybe i would be sent for that i'm laying a ground for him that when he does come but if he wasn't simply so under the modern conditions listen to what he says i command you to go to your home with your wife now he's telling the men to still be men he's telling the women to still be women if you're happy with her live with the raise your children the admonition of god but god be merciful though it does not conform to the image that god had in the beginning he gives a grace why because in that office in that place a man as a man a woman as a woman god will recognize that god gives a grace for that he says if you're happy stay but god be merciful if you ever do that again you teach your children to never do a thing like that bring them up in the admonition of god and now that you are as you are men being men women being women husbands being husbands wives being wives parents being parents at the late evening hour that we're living in and press towards the mark of the high colony in christ jesus where all things will be possible what a grace but what is he saying i cannot make excuses and say that under modern conditions a man can't be a man and under modern conditions a woman can't be a woman regardless of your modern condition god has made you male or has made you female and god has established a purpose in a role even in your modern condition god has established a purpose for that and god spoke so strongly to my heart i wasn't i wanted to use this scripture last sunday and i was you're going to use it another time but under modern conditions let me say this psalm 68 5-6 some of you may want to write this down psalm 68 verses 5 and 6 just to confirm the promise of god he says i will be a father of the fatherless and that beautiful you may not have a father so i'll be your father why because i want a family and i want you to know what it feels like to be in a family and a judge of the widows it's a real unique way of saying i'll be a husband to those who don't have a husband under modern conditions don't fret don't despair don't be brokenhearted in the absence of a spouse in the absence of a father and the absence of a parent in the absence of children a father the father the judge of the widows is god in his holy habitation in verse six if you're looking at it god setteth the solitary in families he takes the one man who may not have a wife he takes the one woman that may not have a husband he takes the one person who may not have children and he sets them in a family that's what god's purpose is it will not be defeated he bringeth out those which are bound with chains but the rebellious dwell in dry land musicians if you would come under modern conditions under modern conditions god does not water down the word god does not make excuses nor does he condemn he gives grace he gives grace though the works of satan have tainted family structure broken up families created situations that could maybe never in the flesh be remedied he says i'll still be a father to you you who don't have a father i'll still be a husband to you that don't have a husband you men who aren't fulfilled in a family role i'll set you in a family you know there's something that god will redeem and nebuchadnezzar was driven from men the bible says he left off being a man didn't identify as a man anymore and for a season he lived contrary to what the qualities and the nature and the character of what a man would be but it was only for a season i think it might have been seven years and daniel chapter 4 verse 34 says at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes into heaven in my understanding returned unto me [Music] god can bring someone back to their right mind [Music] if you haven't been the husband you were supposed to be god let this mind be in me that was in the bridegroom haven't been the wife in the image of a wife if my if i've been set before the wrong image if i've my nature's become too hardened and callous if i was identifying the wrong way oh lift up my eyes into heaven and let my understanding return unto me that i may bless the most high and praise and honor him that liveth forever whose dominion is ever an everlasting dominion his kingdom is from generation to generation here's a man who is driven from the qualities of man but then his understanding returned i could use that as a a an example of how the god could take some of the worst modern conditions and make them whole but let it stand for this regardless of your marital condition regardless of your marital rights regardless of family estrangement inability to have children no prospect of marriage take all that away god still has a role for the solitary god still has a purpose for you as a woman god still has a purpose for you as a man and what you want to be is the man he wants you to be what you want to be as the woman he wants you to be to step into that to show yourself to be a man to show yourself to be a woman and individually apart from whatever the the the social constructs may be regardless of whatever my marital conditions may be regardless of whatever my my physical abilities may be whatever the modern conditions are the conditions of today i can as an individual take my place in the body of christ to be a man and you can take your place in the body of christ to be a woman in the image of god so you're not left without a call and you're not left without a purpose you're not left without family this is how to me it just seems to be such a grace that's continuing to be extended the devil has been able to use think about it the devil takes the very picture of a perfect family and uses it to beat you over the head with it and uses it to cause complexes and condemnation and takes the wrong image of a man to bring people under bondage takes the wrong image of a leader the wrong image of a pastor to abuse the sheep of god but listen god wants to take that picture out of the hand of man and take it and turn it right and then you see yourself maybe it's not so much important that you see where's this man where's that woman where's the brother where's the mother where's the sister where's the dad just see yourself and when you see yourself you see him as a father to the fathers you see him as a husband to the wife who has no husband and you see that he set you the solitary in a family [Music] let's bow our heads just remain seated for a moment [Music] [Music] says nebuchadnezzar lifted up his eyes into heaven if there be anyone streaming anyone present with heads bowed there's no camera in the congregation i would just [Music] spiritually identify with who god wants you to be and by way and to acknowledge that you need a change and that you want to align your faith and your conviction and your identity with what god made you to be and you would want to receive this understanding as nebuchadnezzar received it would you raise your hand before the lord [Music] here i am lord i've been influenced by the worldly image of a woman i've been influenced by the worldly engine of an image of a man i've even been influenced to think that that these things don't matter anymore and i and i've maybe i even given up hope for those who've come under bondage of it and right now you could even believe for someone else you'd want to raise your hand maybe for somebody else who's in a difficult situation say lord i believe i believe that you could take a man who's out there and sin and bring him back home to be who he's supposed to be take a woman bound up with identity problems and help them come to themselves so many hands are raised [Music] hey i'll say this and let's just be brutally honest [Music] any image that falls short of christ is a perverted image and i want to be christ-like that's what i want to be could we i want to say this to create a momentum if you would say that's your objective as a solitary person as male female boy girl man or woman you'd want to stand and say my objective is christ that's my ambition that's my longing i can't make excuses anymore well i don't have this and i don't have that but i have you lord and i have a colony as a solitary even more so if you have taken this solitary and just extended a tremendous grace to allow this man to be a husband lord let me be a christ-like husband if you've extended the grace to let this husband be father lord let me be a godlike father but none of those are possible if i'm not the man i ought to be same for our sisters god bless you let's pray our heavenly father we receive your grace today lord we accept it we accept that there's a grace that's ministered to us in the light of scriptures in matthew and malachi and genesis that seem to paint maybe a condemning and harsh picture of marital conditions but lord those are those are relating to a grace that you even extend to those who because of fallen conditions because of modern conditions because of a fallen flesh have seen their role of a man compromised they've seen their opportunity as a wife restricted but we realize that by a new birth we have become spiritual sons and spiritual daughters and that identity cannot be stripped away from us and that though we may have circumstances in our development that have kept us from walking into certain relationships that does not change the fact that you have made us a man or you have made us a woman does not change the fact that you watched out over the seed and allowed me to express to present as a male and lord under modern conditions with biology and the backsliding of dna there's circumstances that take place and though they may not be frequent lord there's people that are born with a variance with the very horrible choices to be made by parents and doctors and lord we pray for anyone that might be in that situation that you could align body and spirit you could give wisdom under these modern conditions when that circumstance would allow but lord we take our place as what you've made us to be and i pray lord that as we experience this divine love and a hope for those that we love and a renewal of our own purpose despite our situations lord may we have a grace for others not that we would tell everyone i'll remain as you are but that we could show them a life changed by the word we could show them a power of god jesus rebuked them in their understanding of marriage and relationships you don't even understand the power of god we believe in a god who designed it in the beginning he's the one that can take it back to the original today and i pray that you help us to have the right disposition of christ as christians lord that would not only please you but that would be a light to others we commit ourselves to you now father the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
