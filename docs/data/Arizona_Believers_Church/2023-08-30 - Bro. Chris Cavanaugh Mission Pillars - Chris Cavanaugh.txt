TRANSCRIPT
========================================
um Revelations 3 12 it says this him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name so let's just bow our heads for prayer Heavenly Father we're a privileged people this evening Lord to realize what a great God that we serve Lord as we've read your word and we see it and we realize the promises that are entailed in it father were just encouraged all the time Lord God to realize how much you cared for us father and what price that you paid Lord that price of healing was already paid for sister Sandy and brother Levi and so we just hold them up in prayer Lord as as well as the other requests whether they were spoken or unspoken realizing that father we're coming to the right place we have the right person we have the right King the right Lord father we have the right Kingdom that we're a part of and so Lord we just commit them into your hands all these requests father and also the furtherance of this service we pray that you'd bless your hearers and the speaker also I mean all things that are done be done to your glory for asking in Jesus name God bless you can be seated so just as I start this evening I want to read a quote I'm going to the water already so you know it's bad because usually I can get through a few more minutes than this but no I'm hoping it wasn't something I said that everybody's you know a ways back but you haven't even given me a chance yet you gotta got to give me a chance to say something so um I guess we'll just get into this and Expeditions of the seven churches brother random had had this written it says now he is not only giving crowns but he says that these in the bride will be made pillars so we know we're in the age and brother Aaron's been speaking on it about we're in the head age right and things that happen in the head but there's you know a whole lot of other things that go into it so it's not just the head but there's support and different things there so it says and the bride will be made pillars in the temple of God but what is the temple of God Jesus spoke of his body as being the temple it was it was the temple of God but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of God by the Holy Ghost within us now he is going to make the Overcomer a pillar in that Temple so we're Overcomers pillars in the temple okay so we'll get that I think we got that right but what is a pillar a pillar is actually a part of a foundation for it holds up the superstructure praise God and just to stop here so the superstructure is like you've got a pillar going up and then the building that's above it that's what it's supporting so everything above that is what a pillar supports so it's down on the foundation it's a part of the foundation because it comes from the foundation and comes up and supports it we'll we'll cover that a little bit more here later um praise God that puts the Overcomer right in with the apostles and Prophets and I think this is real important that we understand this is that being a pillar you're actually placed back into that ax and I think sometimes we have as Believers a problem with realizing we look back and we think of Peter and Paul and you know different ones fill up in in different ones in the Bible and the things that they accomplished but the reality is today the Holy Ghost is the same as it was two thousand some years ago and what they were doing or what they were accomplishing all those things this church so the bride of Christ today is built upon the same exact thing that was present then so those things haven't gone away in fact they're magnified in this day because everything now has been opened up to the children of God Like Everything Has Changed right because the opening of the word came in this day you got into the the head era where we're in this day now and so Everything Has Changed For That um sorry right in with the apostles and Prophets for it says in Ephesians 2 19-22 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets I just want to stretch that again Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together growth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for inhabitation of God through the spirit so we know that God is a habitation is somewhere you dwell right that's your house so if habitation doesn't make sense to you just think of your home whatever that home is that's a habitation for you that's where you dwell so Christ is going to dwell yes that verse 22 sorry yes the ver that verse 22 says that we are building together with them everything went through the door Jesus and as part of that body or Temple now when God puts a man in the temple as a pillar and makes him a part of that Foundation group what is he doing he is giving him the revelation of the word and of himself because that exact exactly what the apostles and Prophets had so we we don't want to be overwhelmed by thinking oh Peter and and Paul and Philip and you know different ones and Stephen and different ones we could mention all these ones and be like wow I can never achieve that because that's not what God's saying that that's totally something that is achievable in this day and it is a part of of the bride of Christ today is that particular thing so um what we want to focus on today uh and I'm going to try and tie two different things together uh Lord willing that's our goal anyways today uh so my the title of my sermon today is Mission pillars and we'll get to like there we go so we'll we'll come back to this so um an X Factor and we talked about this before and I know that some of you had asked me are we going back to space kind of we're kind of going back to space but not really but but we're going to talk about it and um two different kind of thoughts that I want to tie together and and one was um just the part of that the astronaut age and where we're at today and then going back to another thing where we talked on simple things and when we left off in that particular sermon we uh I had been sharing uh basically a testimony about my son and the the healing that happened and I'm sorry we can't go into that but I think most of you are here um maybe not all but most were here at that time and when we left them off that you know we've got the the Israelites circling Jericho and that's kind of where we left it at but it was the whole fact of they're just their walk right they're doing what the Lord said just walking day by day and then you know the next day comes by and the next day until the seventh day and then we know the walls come down so so we're going to try and tie those two things together so just before we try them together I just want to let you know that this evening if you go to the next one vintage youth will eat free again tonight because um I'm going to try and bring out some things that maybe won't be so much for the Vintage youth but uh we'll try and tie it all together so this evening vintage youth get to eat free that's uh part of what they get to do so um inspiration four which was the and I'll go back just a quick review if that's okay inspiration four was a group of civilians who were sent into space a billionaire paid for the tickets for three other people and those three other people end up going into uh actually orbit um three times around the earth and a part of what they did was they had said that they were going to have four different pillars that were a part of this particular thing so we know that what man is trying to do is they're trying to to find a way of Escape so just like in the tower in Genesis 11 they're like hey we got to do something so this is an awesome escape plan let's go to Mars like it's freezing it's really a long way from the sun we don't know if there's water but Let's Escape there so that's their plan so here comes inspiration four and this group of of people that have been chosen to do this and again somebody a billionaire paid for the tickets and he was on the flight with the others that were there so and the four pillars that they represented were hope generosity prosperity and Leadership and I'm not going to go too much into those because I've got a lot to get through tonight and by the way I had to try and Willow this down like to under three hours so and and then I tried to you know get it under two so we're trying uh to to keep you know whittling it down if we can just to make it a little bit smaller but anyway this inspiration for us got there and what's remarkable about this particular thing in Time Magazine did several articles on it but um the article that I read on the particular article they said what's interesting about them is for six decades everything was controlled by pretty much nation states so if you were going to go you were in a specific class of people you had to have you know high education you had to be physically an amazing specimen that you you had to do all these different tests you had to have all these different abilities and you were the cream of the crop like they they weren't taking anybody but this like there was no way so that was that way for six decades but in the seventh decade guess what happens something changes so kind of like six Church ages right and in the seventh Church age all of a sudden all these things are changing and now you've got a group of people that have blasted off into space and gotten out there somewhere and because of that we realized that brother Branham had taught that in the um in the um in the sermon countdown that we had entered the astronaut age and he said the natural so things that science is doing God's doing other things as well so we see things in the natural taking place but in the spiritual God's not outdone so you see people going into space and you think wow that's awesome God's not outdone like he's going to make sure that what whatever man is doing he's doing something better right so there's always something better and if man's got some kind of plan we understand that all the the thinking and all the ability and all the creation all the things that man could do came from a particular Source right so he's still limited by that but God's unlimited so he's not bound by the laws of physics he's not bound by you know the the laws of nature he doesn't though although he works in nature he's not bound by those things so you can do whatever he Wills to do so we have these folks that have taken this trip and I'm not going to go through their history or anything like that again but I just wanted to talk about that and so um anyway what brother Branham typed it as is he said justification will be the next tile I think so he said justification was the horse and bugging this is just a quick review again so sanctification was the automobile uh the Holy Ghost gifts being restored was an airplane and then the Holy Ghost was the the spaceship which is the introduction of the astronaut age and so the thing about each of these things is you have power so it's horsepower with the horse and buggy it's more horsepower with automobile it's more horsepower with the airplane and then it's even more horsepower with the astronaut age still horsepower so the same things running through each age and each time and each step along the way it's all coming through that pathway but it's just getting more and more and more and God does the same thing he doesn't like give you something and then say oh we'll take that away here's the next thing he just keeps adding on to the very next thing and the very next thing and in fact we're living in an age where Satan has had four different Messengers if you will so he's had four horse riders right and with each passing of time those horse riders come out well there has to be something that raises up against it in each of those ages and so if Satan gets to get everything together into a Pale Horse and so everything that he's done through history is all mixed up in a Pale Horse would God take something away when he gets to the eagle age no because he's going to combat everything that Satan has all the way through so all those promises and this will come up just as we move along but all those promises and all those things come together there so uh so for um the first thing that we'll have is what is a mission so that we understand kind of what as a mission now one of the terms that's overused a lot is I'm on a mission from God because people love to say I'm on a mission from God I don't know what God they're on a mission for but it's not the God that I know but it's it's really a term that's overused but the reality is saying it's you're on a mission from God right because we're here to complete a mission there's something that we have to do so let's just say so this is what a mission is just so everybody understands it's a special assignment given to a person or a group or there's a pre-established objective or there's an ambition or a purpose that is assumed by someone right so Ephesians 5 25 to 27 and if it's okay you don't have to turn I'll just read it off says this husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it then he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so we're reading Christ's mission he's got a mission here he's got an objective he's got something that he wants to do he's self-assigned this Mission you know it wasn't like he called brother Kristoff and said hey what do you think I should do about this you know should I did he call any of you no he self-assigned the mission right it was something that he he had a goal he had something in mind he had something that he wanted to achieve and he's going to achieve it and so that's his mission and his mission is going to be something that has absolutely accomplished now I can say I've had goals uh well I won't say weight loss goals because that that didn't work out so well but I mean sometimes you have goals right and you set goals for yourself you have ideas I tend to be a fairly optimistic person which actually isn't so great because it seems like my optimism is always ahead of what I can actually accomplish so uh and and then you get disappointed right because you're like I can accomplish this I I think I can get there I can do this thing and then you can't um but again I think optimism is a good thing in that you're always thinking that this is going to work out everything will be okay right you've got the mindset and I think a mindset is real important in accomplishing a mission so again Christ's Mission here and he's not going to mess it up he's going to present to himself a glorious Church can't miss it it's his mission right and he uses pillars to accomplish this Mission so he is the pillar and ground of the truth right we understand that the whole church was based on that pillar and ground of the truth but that is Christ he's that one so for for the the young people especially one of the the most famous pillars that that we can see is uh or the story of pillars is with Samson and Samson was between the pillars and it says and Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was uh born up of the one with his right hand and of the other with his left hand and so we understand that this is a uh what the scripture was referring to there is that there's this place that has a a God that they're worshiping and Samson has been uh unfortunately not not living great but at the end of his life he comes to a place where they don't realize that that God has restored his power back again so that's come back to him now and so they Place him between two pillars and and according to the scripture there's some 3 000 up on this thing that that when he takes these pillars out it brings the whole building down so if you can understand pillars that's the part that I'm wanting to get to is that when you have a pillar it's real important that that pillar has strength that it has the ability to stand that it has something in there so a couple things about modern day pillars uh and I learned this actually the hard way when I used to do construction is that there's two things in modern pillars that you really have to have and one of them is compression strength and one of them is shear strength so compression strength is just that pressure squeezing down and Shear strength is the sideways forces so tonight we don't have time to do both so we're just going to focus on one so we're going to focus on that that pressure that that comes that crushing pressure and most of us know concrete right we're familiar with it but if you see the pillars on the highway outside you see the concrete right that's what everybody sees but inside there's other stuff that makes that whole thing work so both of those give it extra strength but tonight I just want to for sake of time we're going to try and just focus on one particular thing so I brought a special box and by the way I uh I I try and preach like I know there's a camera there but I really don't like them so and I have some things in here that we're going to use sorry that I'm off camera but I have to unload everything quick I guess I've had I could have had brother Phillip do it but I don't think he'd want it to be off camera either so um so I was just thinking about this and and you know in thinking of what it is how do we how do we convey to people like how important it is to to be filled so brother Castillo is preaching and he's talking about you know this pulpit and how the atoms and how they're separated and right and there's that space in there excuse me and there's you know that space needs to be filled and I think he did a really wonderful job of bringing that out but I had been thinking about this for a while um and and just that you know how do you because we say it all the time like you need the Holy Ghost you you know you need to be full of the word you need to you need to have these different things that are uh part of your makeup or part of your life and and how important that particularly is and so I thought well we'll just do something with some cans so I've got ordinary cans they're these are empty the others maybe not so um so you know things that are familiar to us that we've probably seen before and I'll need some Volunteers in a few minutes so some of you that are brave that that don't mind maybe just one or two uh but I was just thinking that you know uh we we have pop or okay maybe we should do this first is it pop or is it soda wait okay pops how many pops how many soda okay so we're gonna call it soda pop because that way all right because I'm not sure how else we can do it but to do that so for tonight we're talking about soda pop now one of the things about the cans is that the can doesn't really have much input on how it's made right it doesn't have a whole lot of input on what goes into it it's the camp right so this can is labeled Cactus Cooler because Cactus like ABC grape Crush Canada Dry Dr Pepper Sprite and this one is not a pop can but I brought it for a particular reason but our soda pop can better stick with the soda pop soda just doesn't sound right right if you go backwards of distant soda pop sounds sounds about right but anyway what I was thinking about on this particular thing is when when cans are filled they have a strength that they don't have once they're empty so when when the can is empty and how many of you crushed cans like okay most of us have it's kind of fun sometimes can get a little tedious if you have a lot to crush but every now and then just you know Crush in one can or whatever's kind of a fun thing to do so but one of the things that you'll you'll see about cans is like I have different sized cans different things that are there right and I'm not sure if everybody would be able to see so we'll have to figure this out in the long run and now Lord willing because you know this when you do things live things can go wrong so I'm just telling you if something goes wrong just know that I actually did this at home and it worked just fine so but just by virtue sometimes of the can itself so in other words just by virtue of how it was made initially it doesn't have to have anything in it but you can you can can everybody see can everybody see there so if if it can have I can stand this can is completely empty there's nothing in it absolutely nothing nothing in it right yeah it's empty but by virtue of what it was made in the materials that went into it it can withstand a lot of pressure it can handle a lot of things it's certainly able to do that so um Us in in our own natural abilities some of us can handle certain things really well like it'll it'll seem like actually you're handling it so well that God must be involved in that thing and what it actually is is it's just your natural ability I know some people that are naturally bold like you don't have to like ask for boldness because they're just naturally bold like they can preach like they're natural like they got boldness from the Lord but when they were five years old they were bold and when they're 50 they're still bold I mean so it wasn't like they said God give me boldness uh I need this it just was there it was something inherent in them so uh first volunteer you want to try okay okay uh where should we have them stand you tell me right here right next to me okay so do me a favor and hang on to this because I don't want you to to slip off okay step on it and see what you can do okay so that's good it's okay go ahead and stay there for a second I'm going to step around you for just a second so he's able to withstand but if one little hurt comes if if something comes then you can't you can't withstand it it doesn't take much that was just a little tap on the metal thank you I appreciate your participation it can't withstand much it can't do much with those things so I need a another volunteer but I want somebody bigger I need somebody kind of okay do the same thing if you would if you'd just hold on to there you can bounce it's okay let me try and hit it I can try and hit it ready so do you know why it's not doing anything because this can is filled it's full of something you can go ahead thank you now I should say thank you I should say that for for brother Aaron and sister Elizabeth if they're watching I will not get any pop soda pop on the carpet that's why I'm having volunteers come out so teasing and teasing you're everything's safe trust me we're all good everything is safe so one of the things that you find out is that if if a can you know starts out fine and everything is good but through life's Journeys and life's uh you know troubles and trials and and again we're I hope you can kind of understand where I'm going with this you can have scars you can have things that happen and the cans can get damaged and that damage makes them more susceptible to failure right so and that's what's there so you have something that's damaged that's more susceptible to failure and it can be that way so if I take one of the cans and it doesn't matter so let's take a Dr Pepper because it has 23 flavors it's just what the doctor ordered right so one of the things about this particular can of Dr Pepper is that with its 23 flavors there's something else that's in there that's in every can of soda if you read the ingredients on all the cans of soda pop um one of the things that you're going to see is carbonated water now I could take those 23 flavors and pack them into a Dr Pepper and that's lovely right it's great that we have them in there but if I don't add the carbonated water to it it's a little bit much like it it doesn't it's never going to be truly the Dr Pepper that we know and love maybe some of you don't know or love Dr Pepper I don't know but it's not going to be that because it's missing the main ingredient because it's always the meaty ingredient is the carbonated water so I I know this is going to be I don't want to say Elementary or you know too too simple but I'm trying to use a simple thing to explain a complex thing because let's face it god's complex and you can't explain God but we can use simple things and I think brother Branham did it all the way through just like the horse and buggy and on you know in airplanes it's like wow that's really a simple thing but then he's talking about look at this is how I'm I'm working in you I'm going to come and justify you I'm going to come and sanctify you I'm going to give you gifts I'm going to put things into you there's going to be things that you receive and not only that my person the person of Jesus Christ is going to come and indwell you and it's going to fill you and that's something that you're going to get so here we have carbonated water so it's got water and then it's got carbonation so you know what brother Reggie was talking about with Dynamics and mechanics so you can kind of think of the water as that mechanics part of it and the carbonation is that life part of it right because that carbonation it's got that fizz it's got that life it's got that bubble it's kind of like if she took Pop Rocks has anybody had those before okay you know what it's like when you put a pop rock in your mouth right that's the life of it so that's in there and it's something that's giving it to it now I don't know about you but if I get something like a soda pop even if it's a Dr Pepper and that particular Dr Pepper has lost its Fizz I'm like this is tough right it's a little tough to drink it right now if I love it I might you know I might be able to drink it and I love it so I'll drink it but at the same time if it just had fizz right if it just had that carbonation added to it it needs that life to it and once you add that and it gets that thing going and it makes it different it makes it totally something uh special that it wasn't before not that it wasn't good but it wasn't as good as it could possibly be and that's kind of how it is so we've got this main ingredient and we need it we need the carbonation and the water just like mechanics and Dynamics okay so in Sodapop that's an important part of it it's something that you you have to take in it's something that you have to do and that's kind of how it is with the Lord so when brother Reggie was preaching about that and it's like yeah it's mechanics and Dynamics it's something special that has to be done and and that's a real important place for us to be is that we understand that you can have all kinds of gifts right a lot of us you know some people are really amazingly gifted um some people maybe feel like they don't have as many gifts but there are always things that the Lord gives you there are helps there are governments there's wisdom that's given there's you know people that can handle different situations there's ones that you can call on that you know that they're prayer warriors you know there's ones that stay home and take care of the family and that's a special gift uh if if you had me trying to deal with a bunch of screaming kids I you know what I well I did I pulled out my hair I it just it happened but you know it it changes things are are different those things kind of things happen uh but here's the Lord putting all these different things we've got helps and governments and Gifts like Apostles and Prophets and we've got different things that are put in we've got the joy of the Lord and we've got peace that passes understanding we have all these things that he's adding into there right and you can have those things naturally people can be gifted naturally in fact you don't even have to have God and preach right you can get up here preach you don't have to have God and sing like an angel there are people that do many people Elvis Presley who brother Branham talked about quite a bit was somebody that was raised in church grew up in a Pentecostal Church Assemblies of God I believe but you know could sing A Hymn and it was he could be anointed I mean you could tell it was anointed but at the same time he'd never came under subjection to the Lord he always he'd already sold his gift out to something else and that's where he was at that's where he found himself oh I should give a disclaimer uh I'm not actually marketing any pop soda at all so Sprite Canada Dry that's not the purpose so I apologize to the internet if somebody thinks that uh not trying to do that at all so we find out that with this particular example what I want to get to is that we need to be filled right and we need to be filled with both word and spirit it's not just a feeling of one or the other and a lot of times you have uh you know different factions that battle over that kind of stuff or those kind of things and um but I do know this that you know brother Brandon had talked about when when folks got the baptism as a holy ghost he said it would make a pair of overalls you know put their arm around a a was it a suit right a tuxedo sorry I put their arms around a tuxedo and call them brother and the saying it was a Calico print dress I believe in a silk you know a silk one and call him sister and with this particular thing and kind of keeping the same analogy we can think of it as this way and again brother Reggie was the one that brought this up so I'm not saying that Canadians are dry but brother Branham did generalize and he said you know you know that sometimes the Canadians they can be scholarly he called them conservative he called him a little bit starchy um things like that so that's it's amazing that they named a pop that way I I think it's just amazing but one of the things that that you'll notice is that with that Canada Dry when you get the Holy Ghost and have the word together that'll make a Canada Dry put their arms around a Cactus Cooler and call themselves brother or sister right it it'll happen it'll it'll make a a Dr Pepper put his arms around a Canada Dry and call themselves brother or sister but let's look at it so here's the Vintage youth Eat Free Part okay so I'm glad you're sitting down for this because not only that but it'll make an intellectual scholarly dry person put their arms around a Fantastical I think was what brother Reggie called it Pentecostal whatever you know Holy Ghost baby I'm not sure what all the names that they used today but you know that we've got the psychology side of things they say and again I I'm not labeling them somebody else is labeled them just like these cans were labeled by somebody else I'm just using the labels that somebody else put on right those labels are there but the the spirit of God and the word applied properly is going to make you put your arm around somebody that maybe you don't agree with and one of the things that you can think of it this way is you could actually put your arm around them and say you know what brother here's what I believe and I'll believe anything else that the Lord reveals to me instead of brother here's what I believe and that's it not listening to you I'm not talking to you I'm going to tell you exactly what I think and that's as far as I go right but instead of that we can put our arm around you know we can hug the Canada Dry in the Cactus Cooler and the grape crush and and whatever it is we can realize that that uh that is something that God wants us to do is to take our own thoughts and and in our own pride and our own ability and maybe lay it aside and try and see where this other person is at and see if they have something that you need because just like brother Reggie was talking like you know some got mechanics and some got Dynamics and the one side doesn't see the need for the other and at some point you gotta you gotta come and draw a need somewhere to somewhere else so one of the things that that we have is the great crush and I think some people in their minds they get this idea that that's all they are like they're just something to be crushed right but even a great Crush was something on the inside and it I'm not light by any stretch of the imagination but something on the inside of a great crush it doesn't matter what label that people have put on you what age they put it on you what they've said about you or anything else whatever that label is it doesn't matter so you can think of yourself and I know this it happens all the time children when they're young and people put ideas in their heads and that idea sticks with them and so they think they're a great Crush for the rest of their life but Jesus Christ can change that situation he can change that thinking simply because he can put himself on the inside and do something for you okay so Christ can do that for you okay so let's say we're a Cactus Cooler and I don't know if you can see that but it's pretty beat up right it's very beat up but the one thing is is that it's full so as long as it's full it doesn't matter that it's beat up because it's full on the inside right there's something on the inside that can can do something for it oh that wasn't good um so I just wanted to make sure I'll get that later um just leave it it wasn't soda pop just saying so um but it'll be something that that can be done I'm trying to see what I did with that other can you crush another one for me thank you what's up yeah just there that's fine thank you so one of the things that we can see about this particular can is that once it's been crushed there's not a lot that I can do personally so I want to put something in it right I want to help I want it to be capable and able to do what it has always done I want to make sure that it can so I can try and do my best to help I can try and get it back into shape I can try and move it I can try and do things and you know I can kind of maybe help it a little bit but the reality is is it takes somebody Beyond me to do this so guess where I can go a recycler right because a recycler can take this can and take it and do whatever they do and make it to where it can hold another soda pop again and that's just like Christ because what Christ can do is he's a redeemer and so if I can get people so far right like we can help and that's what we're here to do we can help them we can get them so far but the reality is it takes a redeemer to redeem them now that soda pop the the Dr Pepper can it may never be a Dr Pepper can again right it could be mixed up in 100 different cans just depending on what the recycler does it but Christ doesn't do it that way he doesn't take you in reincarnate you into somebody else he just takes that person that you are and he repairs those damages and those things and fills you the person that you are and he realizes that they're scars that you know the funny thing about a can actually is if you take it and you put little scars on the outside if you open the can up you can see them more on the inside than you can on the out and that's kind of our lives right we have stuff inside and and we can see things more sometimes well if we had spiritual eyes we could see spiritually more as to what damage is happening to the person than what actually we can see on the outside because a lot of times the outside isn't a great reflection of what's taking place on the inside but we do know this when Christ enters your life the outside begins to reflect exactly what's on the inside right and and and and becomes a really good reflection of it do you want to bring up the next quote brother that'd be good this is from the exhibition of the seven Church ages the thyatiran church age it says in um in Ephesians 3 16 that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that he being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passed all understanding sorry I've somehow flipped my notes around oh here we go then you might be filled with the fullness of God sorry now according to these verses when a man experiences the depth of God in his life it is an actual personal experience of the spirit of God indwelling him and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through the word so we realize that what is filling us it's it's a fullness of God right it's not a fullness of me it's a fullness of the Lord and so just kind of focusing on this idea of being pillars in this day and I I guess I just kind of want to bring this particular thought out being a pillar doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to not make mistakes and will Maybe cover one of those in in just a moment and it doesn't necessarily mean that you're not going to be crushed right so um those things can happen there there are things that can happen in your life but the important part is is there's a redeemer there's somebody that can can make sure that that's taken care of and they can fix those kind of things and make sure that you don't have that particular thing going on so um when when that Redeemer steps into that role he's fulfilling his mission and you as pillars in the church so let's put it this way so um people there are pillars in everything so democracy there's pillars of democracy so one of those pillars of democracy is that you get to vote so if if you don't have the ability to to actually voice what it is that is on your mind an elector representative you don't really have a democracy because then you have a dictatorship or you have some other kind of form of government but a democracy says the people get to vote and the people can vote their conscience and based on what their Conscience Says that that makes it a democracy if you take that away there's I think they say there's seven pillars to democracy if you take that particular pillar away democracy itself fails because it's no longer democracy when you say you know what you can't vote but you can do these other things I'm going to tell you what you want to do and we've seen governments do that they say I'm a democracy but uh what we're going to do is you can't go anywhere you can't like be out of your basement we're going to check on you if you're not in your basement we're going to come and do something to you because you're not there and it's like can we vote on this no no vote this is just the way it's going to be there isn't any voting happening so the the the situation has changed because of that pillar of democracy has changed that pillar has went away right and any pillars it doesn't matter so just like Samson in the two pillars if those pillars go away if something happens to the pillar then other things above it fall other things above it fail um so getting back to the the crush part of it and I think yeah so that would be um brother Branham and I use this story often for different reasons but brother Brandon uh talked about in in different sermons what happened with his daughter Sharon Rose and the one of the things that I think was really good that he brought out of that particular thing is that while crushing can happen there's something in that crushing that can actually take place where God turns it to good and so in the message here we have no continuing City he says oh my when I've seen that tender little blue baby I cross I didn't know it then but I understand now that there's never been a cross-eyed Child come in line but what I think of that there's never been one pass over the platform but what's been healed too I didn't know the crushing had to bring it forth but I never think of it till I see that so I don't want you to get the idea that I'm going to get the Holy Ghost and I'm going to have the word and nothing's going to affect me ever again that's not real because we're humans and things happen but what what is important to convey to you is that if something does happen and there is a crushing again we have a redeemer there is somebody that can take that thing whatever it was and work it around to where it's actually a benefit to others and to you because because he had that ability to put himself into that particular situation to see when these child children's eyes were crossed it not only healed it was a healing process for him right because he's getting healing every time that he sees this this little baby with crossed eyes and then he's like it reminds them of of his Sharon Rose but then when he prays in those eyes straighten then he's got that I realize my redeemer liveth I realize that he's still on the throne I realize that he's still with me I realize that he's still God I I know that he's part of me that he's got that for me and he's doing these things for me and I think that's just an important thing to to to realize is that when when things happen don't be disturbed by the fact that well I shouldn't say it that way let me rephrase it when things happen don't be overwhelmed by the fact that things have happened so when when something happens that's hurtful or crushing don't be overwhelmed by it understand that if you you get the word and and that spirit in the right place that that thing can be dealt with and not only that not only will it be dealt with but it'll be dealt with in such a way that it'll actually prove to be good for somebody down the road maybe not you in that moment and maybe not you right away but somehow it'll make you something better for somebody down the road and that's the kind of an idea of the pillars part that we're talking about tonight too is um is that are we already in an hour I can talk like in nobody's business apparently so don't worry we're almost done so we'll get there so um when when things happen there's always something you know to take place to to move upon the situation and God's able to do that uh and then the other thing I I want to convey to you is that we can seem to be pillars and and by that I I want to say just go to the next one the next slide so Galatians 2 9 and it says this and when James cephas and John who seem to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of Fellowship that we should go unto the Heathen and they unto the circumcision so Paul is recognizing that here's these men you know they were full of the Holy Ghost right day of Pentecost comes the Holy Ghost comes down they're absolutely full of the Holy Ghost uh things are happening people are added to the church thousands are added right Peter gets out there and starts talking about the Lord uh and telling them hey you can have the same thing too thousands are added to the kingdom and I think we could all agree P Peter was full of the Holy Ghost right I mean I don't know too many people that you know you walk by in your Shadow and it touches somebody and because of that not hands not anything you just it's just your Shadow just the shadow of the person walking by this is a man full of the Holy Ghost and yet Peter had a little bit of an issue right full of the Holy Ghost sealed signed delivered it's done right that's Peter but Paul is saying look at he seemed to be a pillar and he was to to people he was absolutely a pillar he was something that people were supported by he was somebody that they were looking to remember that the sheet was let down and Peter sees the sheet and it's like hey you know it was all these unclean things and it's like hey Peter take kill and eat and he's like all that lord I can't do that I've never done that and so another time it comes down another time it comes down and it's telling him hey the Gentiles are going to receive this gospel like this isn't just going to be for the Jews it's going to be also for for a people that you know with without a country without a you know a kingdom without that it's going to come to this other group of people and we realized that Peter just by birth was this big fisherman right he was kind of like a strong personality he was a great guy so we get to the Garden of Gethsemane and when they're coming to get with the Lord with with Judas what does Peter do he's not afraid he's got soldiers coming they're armed he's got all these people they're gathered he whips out a sword right he's going to do something about this and cuts off a guy's ear so that's our Peter right he's hey I'm I'm he's he's he's kind of this at this time he's kind of this right this is what he is he's strong in and of himself he's confident in of himself but right now who's he with he's with a group of people he doesn't care about right right as soldiers he don't care about the soldiers they're just Gentile heathens what difference does that make and he's protecting his Lord but not too far soon Peter is on another whole level with a different group because he gets in with the folks that are Jews that are about to crucify Christ and they start saying hey you're that guy he's like no I'm not that guy I don't what are you talking about I'm not that guy at all this is not me I'm this I'm not this definitely not this so he's saying hey I'm I'm not that person I don't know what you're thinking in fact he he curses to to let him know like you know I I'm definitely not identified with that guy but who was he dealing with he was dealing with the Jews so it's no longer the soldiers that are saying hey you're that guy it's his people and once his people start saying it then Peter's like no that's not me sorry so um next slide Galatians 2 11-14 it says but when Peter was come to Antioch I withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed for before that certain came from James he did eat with the Gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision and the other Jews dissembled likewise with him in so much that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation so in other words the kind of the deceitful thing like Peter's acting like I'm not I'm not with these people don't you know and everybody follows Peter because he was a pillar like there's a guy full of the Holy Ghost this is a guy whose Shadow is making a difference in people's lives I mean ain't laying on hands it's I'm just walking by I mean amazing right but I think brother Branham covered this really well and and you know doors in a door is that you can have parts of your heart so look at you can have the Holy Ghost and be filled and sealed but you can still have like a door of pride right or a door of jealousy or a door of anger you know you can name off whatever doors that you want so in in Peter's case he didn't have a fear of everybody he had a pride issue with just people from his group so even though the Lord had let this thing down and he'd seen it and something had happened and that he was aware that you know God has went to the Gentiles and he's hanging out with the Gentiles when the Jews came and he knew that they were going to be offended that he was with the Gentiles he just went right back to something that he'd done before he had a man full of the Holy Ghost so again I want you to understand that sometimes we can we're pillars and we can be pillars or sometimes we could seem like we're pillars and and there's something that has to be taken care of and again once that area gets filled it's not not a problem right it's not something that's going to crush you it's not going to something that's going to lead you astray or cause you to run off or to do something unusual [Applause] is this clock even working that clock's not even working deceived by time [Music] well I'm doing better than I expected so we understand from the scripture that we need to be filled and but there are areas in our life that even when we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost even when we've been reading the word even when these things are are becoming a part of us right the scripture says you know I've I've hidden your your uh I think it was David said you know your word I've hidden in my heart so that I wouldn't sin against you so those things are hidden in our heart but there might be places where we didn't hide it right we didn't fill that particular aspect of it but the Lord doesn't Lord didn't like get rid of Peter right it wasn't like okay Peter yeah you were a great example of the Holy Ghost up until this point and from now on it's over right I'm not going to do anything about that it's completely over but what he did do was was like through Paul said hey Peter this is a problem you need to fix this problem and as far as we know it was from that point on taken care of so that's where we can step in we can be Paul was then a pillar to Peter and you can go through the scripture there are people that are pillars all over the place so uh David he's a young boy right says he's ready so he's like a Rosy cheeked brother Branham said he was you know just a skinny little guy and he was just a skinny little guy but yet he goes out and kills you know the Giant and once he's killed that giant David becomes a pillar of Courage as just a young skinny ready looking kid just a youth he becomes that pillar to somebody else and and by the way with the Sprite the reason that I chose this is because you know what a Sprite is it's just supposed to be like somebody small and diminutive kind of like a you know the Elf or whatever but just somebody small so even a Sprite so even somebody Young and and that can be filled and will stand something that that somebody that isn't can't and just like David he had all those people around him all these big soldiers all the you know great adult you know fighting men are there all with armor and everything else but Christ had revealed to him you know what kind of power he had and so the spirit of the Lord had come upon him and so just as a young boy he was he was that Sprite and all the other soldiers are like this and it's like what you know even the Giants like this and he's like what are you doing here well I got something I might be a Sprite in your eyes but in God's eyes I'm way bigger than this so I I'm filled with something that you don't have and I think that's just an important thing that that we get to um one of the things I I wanted to say as well is when the spirit of the Lord comes upon you and I think sometimes people think that this is what they're supposed to do because when the spirit of the Lord comes upon you and and uh or you know you're filled with the Holy Ghost and the word is a part of your life and all those things it's not like that you're going to go out and go whoa I'm come on devil let's do this thing right that's not what we're doing we're not pulling back our our shirt and revealing our Superman or Superwoman you know s on our our chest it's that you realize that in the situation that you have a piece about this and that you're able to overcome whatever it is that that is being sent your way not because you have a particular power but because you have authority over these things that's been given to you by Jesus Christ so it's not I am I'm super I don't know how Superman does it but you know they rip their shirt open kind of thing and and say I'm I'm ready to do battle but when the battle comes you're able to withstand it when the pressure comes that pillar is able to withstand it when those things are happening the pillar is able to withstand it and so I'm whining down here so what I want to get to just at the end here is that um the reason that I I did the the initial tile the way that I did was because different people are pillars for different reasons and um in this particular picture I know maybe it looks off-center to you but there's a purpose in doing that and a lot of times we look at the big thing right so we're looking at this particular this is supposed to be the the walls of Jericho so this is the end of the wall of Jericho and you'll see just out of the window there that Scarlet thread and so Rahab uh being moved upon by the Lord um and fearing God and fearing what what God was doing in the Israelites by faith the scripture says she did what she did and placed this in her in her window so Rahab by the way is mentioned in the in the generation that Matthew says of Jesus Christ as one of those people that's in actually the the lineage or the generation of Christ and it's because that she had taken the Scarlet thread and placed it for people to see the strength of that building wasn't or let's put it this way if if there is workers that are working on this particular section of the building and they're like you know what I don't really care about the the ruler of Jericho I don't really care about the princes I don't really care let's take the best materials and put them on the this wall in this corner because that's what people are going to think right oh the guys that were building this thing must have done something special to this section like could you imagine the conversation you know in the in the in the kingdom when two guys are talking they're the workers are like hey this is like the best stone we've got let's put it over here the king he don't need it right who's going to do that nobody but that's how we scientifically want to work things around somebody's going to do something but here's Rahab and she becomes a pillar not just to her family but she becomes a pillar in the generation of Christ and she becomes a pillar to us because that we look back and see that here's a woman that was of ill Fame who had serious family issues and serious life issues and all these other things but yet she becomes a pillar for Generation after generation after generation and we can look back and the reason that I have it above that spaceship above that Scarlet thread is simply because what we're built upon isn't the spaceship what we're built upon is that Scarlet thread so in other words our foundation goes back to to that sacrifice it goes back to that place and while they had to put it on the outside the amazing thing is is that we actually now have it on the inside and then it shows on the outside so she couldn't do that if she pulled it into the window ain't gonna show outside she had to leave it outside and so brother Brandon was talking about hey put those things on display but we have it on the inside and that inside begins to show on the outside what's there what's actually a part of you and what's occurring inside of you so I want to leave you with with just this thought and I gotta find the place in my notes because I've thrown them all over the place going through this but you know we talked about different labels that that are on the cans and different things and the the thing about like I said earlier the thing about a label is that you can't you can't um well let's put it this way people tend to put on labels on people simply because of one personal experience so in other words I I respond this way to this situation therefore everyone else will respond like me so it's just kind of like you know you have the conversation before the conversation I'm going to go and see this person because I have to deal with something here and I know if I say this they're going to say this and if I say this they're going to say this and you know if I say this they're going to say this and you have the whole conversation before you get there and guess what you say the first thing and they say nothing in response that was like what you thought because everything is based on this is how I think and now they're you know because we're comparing ourselves to ourselves and that's a really tough place to be when you compare yourself to yourself you're not going to get the the same response that's kind of how it goes so so people think of those things and they they they do those things simply because we compare ourselves by ourselves and people put on labels so like the label I talked about you know how the Canada Dry is going to hug the Cactus Cooler so the the intellectual scholarly you know psychologist is is needs to hug the the the Holy Ghost Baby Fantastical Pentecostal person right guess where the labels came from it wasn't the people that are are those you know if if you're labeled intellectual you're not going around going hey I'm an intellectual thank you very much and the other ones aren't going around like whoa I am glory to God I am a holy ghost baby right they're not doing that but because of what we perceive or what we see that's what happens that that's where we get to right so if the musicians would make their way forward so we know this labels are put on right people are labored and we label pillars we label different things but I wanna I I want you to just have this kind of idea because we've used these things to just show labels and ingredients and things that are in there and you know one of the things about Dr Pepper is they've got 23 flavors and they allege that Dr Pepper doesn't share the flavors like you're not going to go on the website and Dr Pepper is going to say here's what's in a Dr Pepper but they have 23 flavors I actually have them in my notes I could list them off but we'll save time and not do that but so we don't really know right so you may not always know what's inside a person right you may not know all those 23 flavors or whatever flavors they have but this much I do know that when Christ puts a label on somebody he knows what's in there he absolutely knows what's there and it allows you to be a pillar whether it's to the community to your family to your spouse to your church whatever it is it's because he absolutely knows what's there so let's just just as we close tonight why don't you stand you've been sitting for a while Christ does this when he labels us he labels Us Faithful he labels us true he labels this lights in the midst of darkness and this isn't going to be an all-encompassing list but it's just a few that popped into my head he labels us a glorious Church he labels us forgiven he labels us Overcomers he labels us conquerors believers beloved chosen bride and any other label that you'd like to add that comes from the word of God he labels us those things because he knows inside of you is him so again the strength of the building wasn't the building it was the Scarlet thread the the strength to get into outer space wasn't the people that are sitting in the capsule it was the fuel pushing them out there right the strength our strength is not what people label us as because people are going to label you I'm sorry that's what people do it starts in school and it just keeps going on through your whole life people like to label things but thank God he labels us and and we can look in the mirror and go I don't see that Lord but it's not what you see it's what he sees because he knows what's on the inside he knows what label applies so chosen bride right forgiven faithful true lights all these things Christ knows exactly what's there for you so what that says I just like to say God bless you I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you this evening we we know that the Lord has got everything under his control and that um the power of God is a real thing and being pillars of Christ that is a real thing it's not something made up it's not something it's a real thing just like there are pillars in different walks of life and I had a lot of examples I had to cut them out just to save time but we have these different pillars and we can actually be pillars to a generation you can be pillars just to your family you can be and and the important thing is is that if that pillar is full of the right thing when the pressure comes and that that squeeze comes down and those that hardship hits you you can withstand not because of you but there's a grace of God that's over your life every day may not feel it every day may not see it every day but every day the grace of God is covering you every day he's taking care of you every day he's able to make you a pillar in the house of God he's able to it's not just he's he's both the foundation and the pillar right and everything supports off that so God bless you this evening I appreciate you being an attentive audience I I hope you it wasn't too simple for you um but I just wanted to I just thought it was it was good to to let people know you know we talk about it all the time oh you need to be filled you got to be filled but what is it what does that mean so hopefully at least you got something like you understand what it is to be filled so all right God bless you this evening what are you playing brother sorry
