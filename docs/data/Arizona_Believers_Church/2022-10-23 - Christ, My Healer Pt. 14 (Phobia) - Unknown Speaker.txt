TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and my title today is phobia and it this hopefully is a little bit of a tension grabbing and I already know that I've provoked some phobias already just by the title slide but that's my title today is phobia and in First Corinthians chapter six I want to just jump into this and I want to look at this again Paul says uh speaking of fornication and that when we fornicate there is a impact uh that it's not just something that offends the body there's more there's a deeper impact when a man does this but he says he's also sinning against his own body so those two things come together and then he gives a little what and then he says you know don't you know that your body is the temp of the Holy Ghost so your body is a temple it's a residing place that the Holy Ghost and then he says which is from God and then he makes the statement you are not your own so he's implying there's some other ownership that you are subject to something else a higher power and then he refers to the price of redemption and he says therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods now we could start here and go down a particular line of teaching that could enforce a lot of different scriptural principles a lot of things that we hold very dear as Believers but we realize that this is the basis in the scripture for avoiding certain vices or substances we avoid drugs we avoid drinking we avoid gluttony amen there's a lot of things we avoid because we realize that even though those things may uh influence and stimulate the body or be something the body processes this body is not our own but it belongs to God it has something to to really think about in terms of your person being Soul spirit and body that if that's you as a person but yet you belong to God so Body Spirit and soul still are the Lords and he says you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost so he's already taken care of that Soul part God has taken possession of that and the soul is now converted or born Anew or regenerated it's permanently sealed and so that's within the person but now he's addressing your spirit in your body and he says glorify by God with it because they are gods they belong to God and as we've been speaking on Divine Healing and this is the part that I just want to touch on in the outset and then maybe we'll get deeper into in a later service this is a Biblical directive to take care of your body and your spirit and it's something that we could point to to the scripture to say that my body is a temple of the Holy Ghost and and my spirit belongs to God therefore I ought to give some thought as to how I treat it and how I care for it and so there is a scriptural principle here that we are under a command to take care of our body and spirit now that in itself is a very large thought that can inspire a lot of different fellowship and principles and if I could say this a desire to be well is good desire to be healthy you I'm glad I got some some delayed amens I don't know if we're on a little bit of a delay here but maybe some of you were planning on binging this week on you know boasts of donuts and you're thinking oh bad timing but a desire to be healthy is a good desire it's not an inordinate affection a desire to be physically healthy a desire to be mentally well to give some thought and to take care of your person in terms of uh your overall health and happiness those things would not be and themselves a bad desire but the body is not the god the spirit is not the God so it's not that I I I'm serving this Temple I'm serving the spirit and that the body and spirit that my over uh my my main principle in life is my well-being and my wholeness and there's a lot of things we could point back to that we've ministered on to where that whole idea of Being Fit and being healthy and being at your best and maybe getting a little bit of a chisel and I've been in the bulking up phase for 47 years and um there's a lot of things that we might focus on I've never quit stomach day if that's such a thing but if there's things that we could focus on and got to be very careful being healthy and being happy is is important but it's not the God because your body and spirit belong to God and your body and spirit must be consecrated to him now I want to amplify this more and I say that because I took several scriptures and principles out of my notes just uh cut and pasted in another document to come to it another time and so there's more that we could do on that but to that point I want to say this our Pursuit is our goal is not Health our goal is not happiness that that's not our goal so that our entire lives now think very uh deeply about this our entire life is not I just want to do whatever I can to be healthy and I want to do whatever I can to be happy uh those are not our goals but they are promised to the believer so if they're promised to the believer there's a God there's a provided way for God to bring health and happiness to a health and happiness to us and so if I could say this and maybe I'm taking a little bit of a leap here because I want to move on that if if the body and spirit are the Lord's and and he has promised us health and happiness a healthy body and a sound mind then God has a way to provide that to us and his way would be by the word through faith that the same way our soul has been sealed that would be his way of doing it and that so then Faith must be at the center or a driving factor to that Pursuit so if you want to be healthy there's nothing wrong with that if you want to be healthy nothing wrong with that but there's this there's this danger line that if the if the slightest imbalance will then cause us to be driven by the wrong ambition and we're going to be kind of addressing that today just and I say the slightest imbalance that if you're wanting um to look good for a particular occasion or you're wanting to do something for a certain reason uh even in a competitive sense just the slightest imbalance caused you to be driven by the wrong ambition and you're stepping away more from God's promise that you should be healthy and God's promise that you'll be happy and you're getting more into the vanity and the pride of of taking care of this body and wanting it to look good and wanting to be you know you take care of your well-being so I think that's that's maybe enough on that that there's a there's a way that you can just get left of Sinner and where faith is no longer behind all your Pursuits so now to our title today phobia and when you'll you'll catch how this ties into where we've been speaking on lately on this subject I want to address the internal conflicts that we have as Believers when we're pursuing our well-being whether it be a cure for sickness or a remedy for some ailment or healing of some disease there's some Eternal conflicts that we might not even be conscious of so we're going to be uncovering some things today that we go through in our spirits and if I could use this by way of analogy we talked before about forgiveness and how that sin could be a cause of sickness so if you're sick and you want to be healed you have to say I'm sorry to address the sickness the underlying sin that's caused the sickness or you could have some resentment or bitterness or unforgiveness in your heart and so you may need to say I forgive in order to be healed so that's those are those are conditions of the Mind state of Minds the right mental attitude that's keeping you from receiving a promise now we said this at the very beginning that we're using the example of Divine Healing as a template for how we can approach any promise of God and so it's not just limited to our physical healing there's a lot of things that you could take into consideration today on this subject and so as as we look at this phobia we're looking at things that hinder us from being healed or cause us to be sick still and again if you're waiting for me to start on the subject of Divine Healing we're in it now this is I'm kind of seeding this for the future there's a vast number of approaches to Healing the mind and the body a lot of different disciplines a lot of different ideas a lot of different um opinions and I would say there's different scriptural principles that relate to these things but there's a lot of maybe you could all agree with this maybe if you're getting nervous relax there's a lot of different controversial beliefs when it comes to Medicine comes to the Health Care system and things and there are some very strong doctrines within uh nominal Christianity or within yeah just say within Christianity that believe it is a sin for a Christian to go to a doctor or seek medical help anybody ever heard of this before and when I say sin they they they they equate it with adultery that if it would be a sin for you to uh commit fornication if you would be a sin to commit adultery against your body and against your spouse the same against God if you go to see a doctor or seek medical help and and that's a very strong Doctrine and some of you may have family members that believe that way or it may not be that strong but you recognize there's kind of these undercurrents of this really strong conviction and opinion about doctors and about seeking medical help or getting intervention for ailments or diseases and sometimes life-threatening situations and that's maybe some Christians but then on the other side you have some Christians that practice healing rituals which are associated with the cultic religions and they're they practice them as a discipline they practice it as a belief system they adopt it as a way of approaching certain ailments and if you're like can you give us some names I won't know and I may never because I don't want to uh I want to be very careful because today I'm trying to bring a balance and not throw the you know the spears like oh today we're going to chunk Spears at those people who don't believe in doctors and then oh no no we're going to attack those people who you know believe in uh bloodletting uh but no we're not we're not throwing stones we're not trying to pick on anybody we're wanting to have a balance in the word of God and if I could bring this back to what I said in the beginning faith has to be the at the core of whatever approach we take to Healing Faith should be at the core of whatever approach we take uh to treatments and remedies and and however is it we would choose that God would address a particular situation or that we would receive our healing or be better off physically and mentally Faith should be at the core of that uh and and I think it's a caution sometimes to our attitudes whether it be to medicine or attitude towards alternative remedies there's a way that we got to keep Christ at the center of all of it and exercise our discernment and use our faith when we're pursuing our Wellness and I'll say this and this gets us to phobia far too often the culprit behind our efforts to be healed or be cured or some remedy or even our restraint in not seeking certain remedies or not going to the doctor not going to hospital is fear not faith that the reason why someone is doing something is not because they believe that it'll work or not because it's faith alone that's guiding them or they they're kind of centered they're well balanced they're operating uh with within um a sound mind and and not Afflicted and not distressed a lot of times what does it is desperation in the bad sense and they're doing it because they're they're fearful of this or they don't want to do this because they're afraid of that and what happens is there's a lot of things that we could do and it's not Faith that's motivating us to do it it's fear and there's a that that principle is very very large and if I could say this as I continue today and I appreciate your attentiveness as we go forward I really believe that there's the devil is going to be exposed by the word of God today and maybe not in a way that's new to you but it's exposing the tactics of the enemy because fear is his Factor Fear is what he uses in Matthew chapter 10 verse 28 Jesus says fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body and Hell maybe a little bit of a paradox in that we our fear and our reverence our trust is to God when it comes to uh to any fear that it's God Alone that we would reverence it's God Alone that we would be submitted to it's God Alone that we trust but when it comes to your body and it comes to your spirit they belong to God therefore if there's any trust if there's any giving into if there's any submission it ought to be God and God Alone and so if I could put this in a way that uh it maybe deserves a little bit more amplifying our fears to God when it comes to our well-being fears to God when it comes to the condition of our soul our fears to God when it comes to the condition of our spirit our fear is to God when it comes to the wholeness of our person and the physical uh healing of our bodies Our fear ought to be to God and so he says fear not them which kill the body he's focusing uh he's addressing fear and he's addressing the fear of man I'm saying you shouldn't fear man you can't you shouldn't fear what man can do you shouldn't fear what man cannot do Don't Fear the man that has power to kill the body but fear God so he's addressing by him addressing the fear of man he's focusing our faith properly on God don't fear a man that can destroy the body fear God that created the body don't fear man that you know that can do do these things and don't fear man that can say this or do this and uh there ought to be no fear in regard of man in that those respects but our fear is properly to God who is the creator of our bodies and so Jesus is in a way addressing phobia because phobia is an extreme or irrational fear of something or an extreme irrational aversion to something don't raise your hand but there may be people here who have certain phobias and phobia phobia is an anxiety disorder if it maybe wanted to get clinical with it that's defined by a persistent and excessive fear of an object or situation now in in describing that I'm sure some of you realize that you can have a phobia and then there's a fear you could be scared or something afraid or be in a moment be um kind of scared like a clown could jump out of the closet and scare you and that's not necessarily a phobia but then you could just be irrationally afraid of clowns period and when you see them you start panicking and sweating and that's what they would say is a phobia because they say it's some sort of extreme fear even an irrational fear that is excessive now I would say by definition a phobias contrary to the state of mind that a Believer has a right to any phobias contrary to the state of mind that a Believer has a right to and then in a certain context and I don't think I'm narrowing things by saying this but in a certain context that any fear is a phobia when it comes to certain things because God says you should not be afraid at all under any situation therefore to fear it at all is irrational and excessive and so there's a lot of things that are a phobia to a believer that may not clinically be a phobia to other people but God would say you have a phobia about that and you shouldn't you're constantly worried about this you're afraid this is going to happen you're afraid of that and God's saying spiritually I'm diagnosing you with phobia because it's irrational it's excessive it's persistent because he gives us a promise that we ought not to fear and when we do it tips over to where it's like this is not rational as a Believer this is not how you ought to be in John Chapter 14 verse 27 he says peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid that's troubling this agitation this uncertainty this anxiety this apprehension however you can describe it for yourself he's saying we should not fear over and over when he tells us to believe he addresses doubt and fear fear not believe only there's a there's a kind of a companion to that that we've got to get fear crossed out that we've got to get fear out of our Lives we've got to get away from being afraid so when he when my when I talk about phobia we're we're equating it with fear neither Let It Be Afraid in God's way made for us he says after through the service of this week trying to show people that there's no need of being scared the worst thing the devil can put on you is fear all right that think about it and he doesn't just say it in one place the worst thing the devil can put on you is fear if you even had a cancer I know we read this recently if you even had a Cancer and didn't fear and believed God would heal you you wouldn't be in too bad a shape God will take care of that if you are sick whatever it is if you didn't fear so fear is one of the worst things that Satan can place upon the person we say oh Cancer's got to be the worst no because if you had cancer and believe God could heal you you wouldn't be bad off because God can take care of that right so cancer is not the worst thing he can put on you death's not the worst thing he can put on you a lost job or singleness whatever you look at it he said oh this is the worst this is the worst no your Situation's not the worst your attitude towards it is the worst and your fear and apprehension of a situation or a circumstance is the worst thing that you could be put on you the worst thing the devil can put on you the worst thing Satan can put on you is fear fear of your condition fear of your symptoms fear of your circumstance fear of the possibility of something that's the worst thing that the devil could put on you in second Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 for God hath not given us the spirit of fear so this is something that addresses this uncertainty this apprehension doubt or uh anxiety however I'm hoping that the words are used in such a way to get your attention God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind it's not a spirit that causes us to fear but it's a spirit that has power it's a spirit that has love and it's a spirit of a sound mind that sound mind means self-control and if you think about that in light of what an actual phobia is someone who has a phobia is not able to control their emotions they see they see a clown and they immediately get scared and like there's no reason why I should be afraid of this it's just a picture right of a clown there's certain physical responses people can have in a phobia and it they say it's irrational it's excessive I'm not trying to diagnose today or get into the science of it or the even the medical diagnosis of it but enough for you to understand what I'm talking about he says that we ought to have a sound mind that means to be restored to one's senses it means to be sober and fear is intoxicating they say fear is a great motivator why it drives somebody to do something I had a coach a baseball coach in high school who used fear as a motivator and he figured that's the only way to get people to get things done is fear is going to be a great motivator and he scared us into doing what we were supposed to do and it can cause discipline and it could cause perseverance and cause people to do things all through fear but you have to realize that's a man-made tactic that's akin to the tactic of Satan that's not how God wants to motivate you so fear is intoxicating when someone is afraid it impairs their perception when somebody's afraid of something uh their estimation their judgment is wrong and because their judgment is wrong their action is wrong that when you're motivated by fear you'll see something maybe as bigger than it is and therefore uh you you run away from it because your judgment is off or you're afraid to do something oh I can't do it I'm afraid I can't do it therefore you will not attempt action you'll be paralyzed because of it because fear is intoxicating it impairs our senses and we have not been given a spirit of fear to intoxicate us or motivate us but we've been given a spirit that gives us power love and a sound mind to act and to do in Romans chapter 8 verse 15 for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father now we have that Spirit of adoption the spirit of adoption is the holy spirit it's the holy spirit that is placing us it's that's a very a beautiful principle in the word of God that we could look at but we have the spirit of adoption or the spirit of power and love and a sound mind but not the spirit of bondage and fear is the fruit of bondage that one you're subject to something you've yielded your spirit to something other than God this agitation this apprehension this anxiety this trepidation this uh this phobia is a fruit of a bondage or some way you've allowed your mind to become subject to some something that is not in harmony with the spirit of power love and a sound mind brother Branham says in the sermon Israel in the church and when I was reading this I was reading a biography a dissertation by a theological student on FF Bosworth and just reading through his history and the number and he went through brother branham's uh relationship with brother Bosworth and many many many pages on it it was really neat kind of see that historical perspective and then come and read this statement in 1953 and know where brother Branham had been and what he had been doing and he says this when he's coming back to Jeffersonville after bending on the on the field for quite some time he says this has been the greatest thing that I found among the Christian people throughout the entire world world has been a fear the greatest thing brother man's coming back I've been around the world what have you found amongst the Christian people the greatest things fear not Faith but fear he says they're always afraid and then he relates it to this and when a little sickness strikes they are afraid many I wonder sometime and now I'm along with you but now what I'm trying to do tonight and this week to come is to try to drive that fear Away by God's word that's the only way you can do it the only way that you can drive fear away is by God's word the the there's there's not a remedy that the world can offer you to deal with fear they're always afraid when a little sickness strikes they are afraid now um I hope I hope you kind of caught my what I meant by there's not a remedy in the world that can drive fear away if you're seeking healing you're sick and you're afraid fear is not going to get you the wellness you're Desiring faith is what you wanted I want to hold on to fear it will drive you away from God's word but if God's word can ever strike your heart it'll drive away fear now to continue to amplify phobia or fear in Proverbs chapter 10 verse 24 this is Satan's tactic it is the weakness of man to use fear as a motivator in Proverbs chapter 10 verse 24 says the fear of the wicked it shall come upon him but the desire of the righteous shall be granted and so a righteous man desires something he Longs for something he pursues something and he says the Wicked Man fears something and what the righteous man desires he receives but what the Wicked Man fears he gets what he dreads in his own mind will be what he receives this is what the scripture is saying that a wicked man when he fears something and he's afraid of something happening that's exactly what happens to him and and I don't know why I thought of this but in my experience as an attorney that whenever I had a client or an adversary who just for no reason accused me of lying I immediately knew I was being lied to right you ever met the the people who who are always trying to call you out for lying and they're really suspicious are you taking advantage of me did you lie to me are you misrepresenting this you know are you going to give me a fake 20 Bill and change to my fake hundred dollar bill right they're worried about it because oftentimes it's the it's the wickedness of the person's heart that's what they've come to expect because that's what they give out and so and I think maybe that's just a different aside but when I kept reading the scripture last week this kept coming to me but the fear of the wicked is what he receives what he thinks about what he's afraid about uh in in in in in a state of apprehension and worry to him it's what he gets fear is powerful fear may not be an Evidence and fear may not be a substance but it has this power to bring to a person what they're dreading as an example in Genesis chapter 11 verse 4 it says and they said and this is After the flood they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole Earth their motivation in building the city was not just merely to have a place of habitation nor was it just merely to have a name but it was motivated by fear the fear of what the fear of being scattered and says so let us build us a tower that may reach unto heaven so that we will not be because we are afraid of being scattered throughout the whole earth we're afraid that something's going to happen like it did to our ancestor Noah and so out of fear they built a tower and guess what happened they were afraid of being scattered throughout the whole earth so they built a tower and what did God do when they built the Tower in verse 8 it says the Lord scattered them abroad upon the face of the whole earth did he have to go and do it exactly like they thought it I mean he could have just said he scattered them abroad but they were afraid to be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the verse says he scattered them abroad upon the face of the whole Earth to the very description to the very letter they got what they were afraid of now you say well that's to the wicked that's to the wicked ambition now that's and I said that's true that's what the scripture is identifying as wicked ambition Wicked fear and those things will bring it to that Wicked person to that unrighteousness now just think of it man in general Proverbs 29 verse 25 the fear of man bringeth the snare but who so puteth his trust in the Lord shall be saved so there is again the the companion the fear of the wicked and the desire of the righteous the fear of man bringeth the fear bringeth the snare now when it says the fear of man it's not necessarily that I'm afraid of Brother Martin or I'm free to brother Philip but human fear human fear the fear of humanity the the human fear as as Jesus says I I'm trying to give you peace not as the world gives so the world tries to give a peace and there's also a worldly fear there's a worldly sorrow and here it's not that we would be afraid of man necessarily but it's the it's the human fear and it's saying this human fear it is even if it's subconscious I want you to think about what your fear is on some level when you fear something ask yourself that if the root is a is a distrust in the goodness of God or a lack of conviction that God will keep his promise because his promises are pervasive tall area of life and so where there's fear it is inhere inherent in that this human fear is a lack of trust in God that brings bondage because he says the fear of man a human fear brings a snare it brings bondage it brings distress because I'm not trusted in God to fill his promise because I'm afraid of God's judgment I'm afraid of this I'm afraid of that when you think that way and feel that way he's saying what it does is it brings you into distress it brings you into bondage because of a lack of trust it breeds a fear of consequence or outcome so fear brings a snare it brings a trap in Jairus and Divine Healing his statement here brother Brown says it's the atmosphere you got to get away from it so there's atmosphere that's being talked about if you if you look within uh maybe corporate culture maybe professional sports sometimes they make a distinction between culture and climate and that the first thing you have to change before a culture can change is the climate and and an attitude and a certain feeling and brother branham's kind of dealing with you want something to change internally you want there to be permanent change change the atmosphere you got to change the atmosphere first that's why we come to church early and pray that's why we have song Services it's a changing of the atmosphere so it can be change of character that there can be things deposited he says from that Old confusion you got to get away from that Old confusion oh I'm going to be maybe the sphere oh one day one day says you're scared that's what's the matter you're seeing is how he's saying this you're scared and he's dealing with fear he's dealing with a fearful atmosphere a climate of agitation and apprehension and then he says you'll be frying your meal of a morning for breakfast and the first thing you know you're filled with Holy Spirit but he's trying to say you've got the Holy Ghost and you're cooking breakfast he's wanting us to imagine now you that have the Holy Ghost you're there at the counter you're cooking or you have to get you're in the kitchen and you're cooking he says now in the next slide now I'm going to shock you a little bit so now he pauses and he wants to reset he says you don't mind do you all right for instance the meats of frying and all at once the grease pops out on your hand now he's dealing with fear an atmosphere he says now if you'll just shake it off and go on frying meat it wouldn't bother you now I know you didn't get that just right look first thing oh where's the onion team you know whatever the Melaleuca gel mellow gel and thieves oil whatever it is we use to placate our Burns and just to take the heat away whatever it is we reach for he's saying oh go get the cream go get the Salve go get the bomb go get the aloe vera hurry go get it very very quick he says you see you grab your hand and you start reaching for something he goes it scares you to death that's what does it it's fear this now he's wanting us to think about the power of fear and how atmosphere and we got to get away from this and he's just using a very simple example he says just watch if you're filled with the Holy Ghost and you're in your kitchen and you're cooking and in Greece you burn yourself you touch something you grab something and you burn yourself he's given us a principle that if you would just say oh no big deal I'm going to keep going on I'm not going to let this bother me he's saying that that it wouldn't even bother you but when you pause in that moment and you begin to go oh my goodness that was red hot oh I've been burnt before Oh no and you begin to panic he's saying that's what does it is your fear now I I can see why he says now I'm going to shock you a little bit and ask us if we don't mind because that's almost seems are you sure I'm pretty sure the fact that it was glowing hot is the reason why my skin is melting they say no there's more to it now how many here could testify I can testify and I know number of testimonies that based upon this statement alone people have taken that approach and avoided blistering any kind of Mark I've touched things that would have ripped my skin right off me like oh my goodness that was not good but just went on with my life and acted like no you got to get the meat cooked and never even experience any pain brother Madam backs it up again these both are made the statements made in a very similar time period so something that he was taking into consideration he says when you go to fry your meat for breakfast and a big bunch of Grease pops up on your up on your hand see it's okay to cook with grease says the first thing you it just scares you to death you grab your hand where's the uncontin and again that's just some sort of balm and Salve at the time used to treat burns just as quick as you can that's the reason it burns you that's what makes the scare is what he says I can prove that it's the scare that burns you now you say brother random says I can prove that and it may be to you to seem to be unrealistic that scientifically we could explain why something at a certain temperature is going to to cause a burn or some sort of damage to the skin and whether it be blistering or a second or third degree whatever it might be some sort of redness or that heat you know what you know what it feels like to be burned um he's saying that it's fear that's going to amplify that it's fear that's going to cause it to burn and he says I can prove it now I want to use this at this point and I was thinking that a whole an entire service would go good with it would be this would be worth a whole service but I want to introduce the principle because it's going to kind of be a part of some of our future services on this maybe at least one more but how many have heard of the placebo effect sure you've all heard of this placebo effect it's a beneficial effect produced by a placebo Placebo drug or a placebo treatment now the placebo treatment is in itself it's called the placebo and it's either a pill or some sort of treatment that itself is nothing in other words there's no active agent in it which cannot be attributed so it's a beneficial effect which cannot be attributed to the drug or the treatment so the effect is attributed to the patient's belief so a placebo effect is usually referred to in medical trials or some sort of Remedy or treatment where it's like somebody has a burn and like we're going to go ahead and we're going to put this Medicated cream on your burn and we're going to apply it with these certain intervals and it has this active ingredient it has this new breakthrough cream that's going to cause you to to not blister or cause you not to scar and they put it on some people with the active ingredient and then they put just nothing on somebody else and they tell them oh yeah this is the best there is right and it's just it's just water and they'll put it on them they'll do it even with sugar pills they'll give them a pill this has by zenzatipetine in it and it's going to cause all your freckles to go away and then this other person said this has my zipitene in it but really it's just sugar and they take a similar looking pill and what they recognized is that when they do these trials or people are treated with these things that doesn't have anything in it at all right it's just the essence of the essence of the shadow of the essence in it but yet people get results from it and then when they compare it in clinical trials sometimes the positive results will be the same with people who receive the placebo as people who use the active ingredient so this is a scientific term essentially they say wow the person got the benefit but we can't attribute the benefit to the Sugar Pill we can attribute the benefit to what we gave them because there was no active in it therefore they believed that the patient's belief that they were taking it come on somebody the benefit was in their belief and their expectation that what they were receiving would cause something wow placebo it's a medicine given more to please the patient than to benefit the patient that's what some elevators have they have placebo buttons right and thankfully it's not the floors right it's the door closed it's there to please the passenger it's not going to cause it to close you're not going to do anything to close it but you want to know that when you see that person coming down the hallway right something's happening you go to a crosswalk they have placebo buttons right push it to walk it's on a timer Bud that did nothing but it's there to please you and what do you think watch this watch this son it's going to turn you right you expect it but it's this there and so in medicine a police deal was a medicine given more to please than to benefit the patient it comes from the Latin Placebo come from Latin to please you actually find the scripture and that's where originally it has its roots and religion placebo now that is a beneficial effect produced by a patient's expectation or belief now have you ever heard of the nocebo effect it's a negative outcome because a person believes harm will come there's a placebo effect and now there's a companion to it and maybe it would be the doctors Among Us that would know this brother Andrew and other doctors would know this that there's a can be a negative outcome based upon a person's belief that harm will come and it comes from the Latin to harm so Placebo is to please it's something given to please the patient rather than to benefit them necessarily but then a nocebo effect is a negative outcome that happens because a person believes that something negative will happen this is a very rich field of study within the medical community and here's a statement for adverse reactions to Medicine nasibo implies that patients are more likely to experience an adverse effect if they expect or are worried about the adverse effect the adverse effects may be physically experienced by the patient and are often clinically diagnosable are you listening to this yeah in other words you can in a trial give appeal to somebody and say this pill is going to cure you of your crankiness and and it has this active ingredient in it called faith and it's going to cure you right maybe I shouldn't embellish it that way but you're taking this pill and it's going to make you it's going to do this to you but then the side effects are dizziness dry mouth lethargy right death like all these things that they say in the in the because of the lawyers that this pill may do to you and then they'll give people a sugar pill and wouldn't you know it they have the side effects that other people are actually taking the radiation taking the pill taking the medicine they have the same diagnosable and physical manifestations of the adverse effects and they aren't actually taking the active ingredient so what would do that you think maybe a hillbilly from Kentucky in 1953 is kind of 54 is kind of clueing us in on the power of our apprehensions the power of our fears the power of our worries do you not think the scripture nailed it thousands of years ago and it says the fear of the wicked comes upon them the fear of man bringeth the snare this dread and apprehension that a person has this negative outcome comes because they believe harm will come I do not want you to separate what I'm talking about from the treatment and remedy of a sickness or the very cause of a sickness that the thing the fear and the phobia itself is the cause or there are certain things you will not do to actually make yourself better because you're afraid it'll harm you and then when you actually do it it harms you why you were afraid it was going to harm you the nocebo effect it's the fear that actually burns them not the fire not the heat because it really wasn't there to begin with anybody ever heard of Munchausen syndrome you ever heard of it it's a factitious disorder and it's a syndrome it's named after I believe a German soldier German officer from World War one or two can't remember now should have grabbed those notes with me but it's faking an illness or inducing an illness faking or inducing a disease or illness to draw attention to get sympathy or affirmation Munchausen syndrome and I'd love to spend more time on it because I think maybe it's not a clinical problem but we've got to be careful that there's not just a little munchkin Munchausen in us right a little bit a part of us that wants to be sick that wants to be needy that wants to wants to be compromised for attention for sympathy it's fake in a disease or faking an illness to draw attention sympathy or affirmation and what they are able this is this is clinical diagnosis this is visible physical manifestations that people with Munchausen Syndrome are able to produce symptoms they aren't actually sick but because of this mental condition they're actually able by thought process and by thinking and by Focus and by agitation and by fear and because of that this this condition and there's a lot more maybe to just explain the situation and what the triggering factors are and how a person could come to be this way there's a lot of different ways they try to track the causation but they they're the literature is telling us that a person who actually doesn't have this problem can manifest symptoms often leading to years and years and thousands and tens of thousands of medical intervention and treatment because the doctors and the the tests and certain things will show well we're showing this and we're showing that and we see this we see this but they can never ever ever find the reason for it but it's all in the person's fear in Job chapter 3 verse 25 for the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me this is a righteous man this is one in whom God said was perfect and upright this is somebody that God bragged about this is somebody that stated and said you know what the only reason why he is the way he is is because you blessed him and when you look at his life story there's ways that we could try to speculate and try to figure out what was it easy afraid of he he sacrificed for his children pre-adventure they would sin maybe there was this worry and and then when the first person came to and says oh there was the wind came and it killed all your children they immediately thought oh no what's going to happen to my cattle right and and immediately like this fear what it cascaded it got that's the very things this is just job's word that which I greatly feared has come upon me that which I was afraid of has come unto me and brother bam says this in the sermon perfect faith if some of you have gone and listened to that or studied it as of late this will stand out to you in what he feared speaking of job it actually happened what brought it his fear that's what made it happen it's just what job is saying it's what Proverbs is saying I know it may sound a little bit edgy and controversial when brother Branham says if you're frying uh you're you're beyond sausage in the morning and and a little uh grease pops out avocado oil and it lands on your hand right it pops out on your hand and you go I'm not even going to worry about it you reach into the oven to grab the keto friendly Brownie and it's been at 450 and you forget to put on an oven Mitten you're like you know what I'm not even just going to worry I'm not going to worry about it and he says it's the fear that causes the burn let me think well that seems ridiculous well it's not just brother Brandon saying it it's science saying it it's Job saying it it's the it's the writer in in Proverbs saying it it is not just it is not just some weird uh idea some kind of Fringe theology what he feared actually happened to him he says his faith would have kept him from it but his fear brought it to him there's no virtue and worry there's no virtue and fear his fear brought it to him he was scared it was going to happen and it did have had a brother at one time I I still have two brothers it was a brother that ministered one time and he told a story and he said that uh he was he was driving home from work one night and he hit a deer and it never happened his whole life and so then the next the next week he's gets his car fixed and he's driving he's he's so worried that he's going to hit a deer so he hits another deer this happened three or four times where finally his dad said hey you're creating them deers hey the fear the fear was bringing it to him let there be a dare right it was a man caught in headlights at that point he's creating his own fears bringing it to the very thing we can fear and think about and worry about and I'm afraid this is going to happen I'm afraid this is going to happen if I could just be so bold as to say sometimes in our relationships the very thing we fear about the person we begin to project upon the person and project upon the person and it's actually your fear that brings up the hardness or Rebellion or the distance and actually cultivates the real problem in the marriage or actually causes the real symptom in a child it's not because it was there it was your own fear and expectation I'm so afraid they're going to be this way I'm so afraid this guy I'm so afraid listen we've got to get away from the fear because your fear can bring things to you that you don't want now he brings it to Faith and Healing if you're afraid when you come by the prayer line maybe I just haven't got the faith sufficient it'll never happen and I think I find this to be funny don't worry right okay good it says if you have if you're afraid or you're worried you're not going to get healed then it won't happen but if you know what's going to happen it'll happen see it's a substance of something job had a fear that these things would come upon him and they did if you have a fear that your disease won't leave you it won't does that not just address it this phobia does not address oh I've been asking God to heal me I've been wanting God to heal me do you have any fear at all that maybe he won't look well yeah okay stop blaming God right get the blame forgive yourself right say I'm sorry if you need to forgive others if you need to forgive yourself if you need to but let's not blame God if there's any fear that's where the rat and the wood pile is if you fear that your disease won't leave you it won't in Matthew chapter 14 verses 27 to 31 is when Jesus came walking upon the waters to them and the Bible says they're fearful they're agitated they're scared is it a ghost he speaks to him be of good cheer and his eye Be not Afraid Christ in a Troublesome time with Troublesome apparitions and whatever it might be wants to speak to you by the word to tell you to calm yourself and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and Jesus said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus this is the instinctive obedience to the command of God even in reply to his request if it's you tell me to come so he's walking upon the Water but when he saw the wind boisterous looked at the symptoms the circumstances he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me now what caused him to walk on the water trusting in the bidding to come what made him sink the fear of the waves and Jesus said unto him at which he caught him he said oh thou of little faith in verse 31 why did you doubt now if you can catch this little faith was enough to walk on water it's not powerful just a little faith is little faith was enough to walk on water but just doubt at all is enough to undermine little faith when we've taken our minds the little faith in the word of God was enough to cause him to walk on water as soon as he got his eyes off the promise and his fear upon the waves he believed what the waves were saying and not what Christ was saying Bill Abraham says in the pillar fired the biggest trouble there is in the church today is a bunch of fear people's always scared and that's of the devil don't be scared be brave you don't have nothing to be could we finish the phrase scared of you don't have anything to be afraid of there ain't nothing to be afraid about that's pretty absolute if you ask me trying to address phobia fear apprehension dread suspicion whatever it might be Peter could walk on the water as long as he had a little faith and no fear and when he looked at the waves and not the promise when he when he looked at the wind and not the promise when he didn't keep his ears and his mind and his eyes on The Voice and His Eyes On Christ then fear was enough to cause him to sink in Genesis chapter 10 chapter 3 verse 10 and he said I heard this is after the fall this is man's response this is the first place we find fear I kept being drawn to this last week so I apologize if at this point you thought we should be winding down but I I just need to touch on this to kind of be our fulcrum to come to the end this is where fear begins we'd have never heard of it seen it would have never been mentioned except for this instance this fall and Adam says I heard thy voice in the garden it was the very thing that caused Peter to have the faith to come was and he heard the voice of God saying come is it you and he knew it was him when he knew it was Christ and he had the affirmation that it was him he was bid to come and that caused him to go to him in a Troublesome scene but now is the voice of God the thing that ought to have brought him Comfort the voice of God is fearful because I heard thy voice and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself notice that sin that gave rise to anxiety sin that gave birth to fear fear is a sin is a fruit of Satan fear is the fruit of Satan and what I'm wanting you to think now about is how that it was fear that provoked Adam's action it was fear that provoked Adam's response he says I was afraid and my fear caused me to address my nakedness I I was I was afraid had he the Bible ends in chapter two they were naked and not ashamed so the nakedness itself isn't the cause but it's a sphere that oh I'm afraid I need to do something about this shortcoming I need to do something about this nakedness and it's his fear that drove him to address his condition and if you go back to verse 7 when it when they sinned it says their eyes were opened and and they were they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons that's not Faith that's motivating that this is man's own logical uh this emotional based response to the situation and in each situation it was the wrong response and each situation Adam's being driven by certain emotions of Shame and fear and the wrong kind of knowledge he's been driven to remedy his situation and I want to make this applicable to whatever it is you find yourself in if there's a need if there's a lacking if there's a want if there's a desire you have to realize that there is a wrong way to set about satisfying or addressing your situation and when fear is the motivating factor you're going to put yourself in a very dangerous position because fear is the fruit of sin and Adam when he acted out of fear I would even go so far as to say that not only did he hide uh because he was afraid because of God's voice but it's fear that was driving him to sow the Fig leaves together because he was naked and not afraid but now all of a sudden he's naked and he's scared to death that he's got to cover himself and he's got to take care of this that's man's response reaching for fig leaves reaching for resources reaching for anything that could help me in my situation I just want to take it I think I've shared this in fellowship with some of you one of the things that's just been motivating me in this idea with this subject matter of Christ my healer is how the Believers are sincere that they want to be well when they say what do you want to be healed for they don't they don't have bad answers to that and in their own sincerity they want to they want to please God they want to do what's right they want to be healed and they're caught in this fix well if I have faith do I just believe I'm going to be healed without any any treatment without any remedies is it okay to go to the doctor is it okay to get this is it okay to do that is it okay to take pills is it okay is it okay or they get caught in this fix or they get so desperate they're just reaching for everything they can and it's just a Non-Stop treadmill of this and this and this and this and it just begins to compile to where are we getting any closer to Healing if that's the state of mind that we're in and Adam through fear was willing to reach for anything that would address the situation and we have to be careful that we're not acting according to the same Instinct that's now been sewn into Humanity that where there's something wrong fear begins to try to dress it brother Branham says in time-tested faith this maybe hopefully is turning the corner a little bit for us if God delivered you from sin which is what we're looking at in Genesis chapter 3. how much more will he deliver you from from your sickness he's able to take and change your nature and make you a new person why would you fear about any sickness and if you can save your soul and change your nature and change your motives and change your ideas how much more can you change your sickness into health and put it back in its right place again where it belongs this we're addressing phobia we're addressing fear the fear of the sickness the fear of the same the fear of the life sentence because of it he says it's just so simple that we go over the top of it fear is related to sin sickness is the result of sin fear can never be the Cure fear can never help us with the remedy if the with the in light of the nocebo effect we can actually bring upon us worse things where there is no reason or cause for it other than your fear if fear is driving your approach to Healing to treatment to remedy to uh in whether it be to abstain from something or to take it how can we receive what we're looking for if there's the reason why you're not going to do something how are you going to get the results you want I remember when sister Elizabeth uh years ago when we after we began to have children the big question for me I never knew there was a controversy about it but all of a sudden it was like you're not going to vaccinate your kids right and and it's I all of a sudden it was a controversy I'm like well me I just would have never thought about it right it's like you cook steak and someone's like oh where'd you get the steaks Walmart like you buy your meat at Walmart you're like yeah am I doing something wrong right it's just some people just have ways that they think and things they do and oh I never do that I never do that and I never do that and so all of a sudden it was a controversy and I just remember it was because of the attitudes and things that were being stoked at the time I realized this is just not as simple as I don't want my kid to die you know this was a moral platform now that was going to prove whether or not we were really message believers and I had to tell them I just told Elizabeth I said Elizabeth I'll support you in whatever decision you make as their mom I said but the but the only thing I'll say is whatever you do do it in faith not fear whatever you do make sure you have faith at the end of the day and I again I told I can still vividly remember I said because if you get them vaccinated out of fear then when they have a little bit of a fever for the next couple days immediately I shouldn't have done it I knew I shouldn't have done it I knew I should have listened to that sister with a big mouth or I should I knew right immediately it's like oh my goodness what have I done and you're you're now in dangerous slippery slope territory right you're you're in a you're in a situation where you can get yourself in big trouble and I said or if you don't get in the vaccine out of fear and then the few weeks later all of a sudden they got a really really high fever and they've got a blister you can't explain all of a sudden oh no what have I done all right and sister Elizabeth the time made a decision not to get Elliot the 24 Shots that they wanted to give him at two months and she wanted to wait and so we asked her pediatrician um we're taking them to South Africa you know is that safe do you think that's okay he goes Well ma'am you are the one who's chose not to vaccinate your one-year-old so you're on your own right you know you don't know we don't know what kind of diseases are there but whatever it is at the end of the day whatever decision she made I said just be sure it's faith otherwise you'll be plagued with fear about your decision if we're driven by fear how can we how can we get a positive result positive benefit if we avoid the doctor because of fear if we pursue an alternative care because of fear think about it you mentioned this before I believe it was Sister Nicole that said it in a way that I don't ever actually remember but it is the correct way feed a cold starvey fever I for some reason wanted to shove flu in there but his feet a cold starve a fever and I don't mean to offend anybody but they're both the the it's wrong to starve a fever medically nutritionally but it was uh they they came from and I tried to run down the etymology of it find the dictionaries find where it all started it's a mid-century thing medieval saying there's actually a dictionary from 1574 that said fasting is a great remedy for a fever and it was based upon the premise that of the belief that fasting would help the body cool down when you have an elevated temperature do you feel hot well when you eat your body temperature increases and when you feed yourself it's going to cause your body your temperature to raise so this was the logic and the time same time period where they drill a hole in your head to let your blood out if you had a headache but they'd say Hey you know if you got a fever don't eat don't drink because if you do it's going to cause your temperature to rise and now nutrient naturally naturally homeopathically holistically you name it I'm pretty sure there's the prevailing understood empirically uh proven way to feed both hey if you have a cold if you have a fever hydrate give yourself nutrition if you have a fever your body's fighting something your body needs energy right to fight it so am I right doctors right okay I'm getting like a slight nod okay I yield the floor to the surgeon well legally and I want to say this that if you are if you ought to in each situation be sure you're properly hydrated and properly getting the proper nutrition and not starving yourself and fasting I want to just change a little bit in terms of not the necessary the physical approach to your sickness but as I said it before feed your faith starve your phobia if you're gonna starve anything starve the fear if you got a cold if you got a fever feed your faith if you've got a blister feed your faith if you've got a bird feed your faith whatever it is feed your faith don't feed your phobia brother Adam in a sermon greater than Solomon is here he says but you know there's something about it that if your heart begins to hunger and thirst for God you don't pay any attention to the dangers or somewhere I think it's so beautiful then he kind of pivots he's talking about the Queen of Sheba he says doctor might say you're going to die with cancer but if your heart ever strikes faith in God you know you forget what the doctor said I love this phrase your heart knows no fear as long as it is filled with faith that's how you say well brother and I don't know what to do some people ask me questions after the service is unforgiveness well what does it mean to forgive right what does it look like if I feel very confident I can say this well what do you what do we do about phobia don't feed that feed your faith feed your faith with the word of God remember what the conclusion is if you Google your symptoms at the very end of the page you have cancer and you're going to die so we don't read that we go to the word of God we go to encouraging Fellowship we think about positive things we try to motivate ourselves and go forward there's things that we need to do in that situation instead of filling the void with fearful facts fill your heart with faith and he says your heart knows no fear as long as it's fed as long as it's filled so feed your faith fill it up starve the phobia phobia can be so overwhelming that a person goes to Great Lengths to avoid the trigger right that's how how fever a fear can be so great that people will go to Great Lengths to accommodate the fear go to Great Lengths to avoid the trigger do you I I we have to confess this this is confession time for me and the children I forgot the name of it but my wife has a fear of dots right little tiny orderly dots you might have what's trichophobia trypophobia Trypophobia okay thank you had to get him in on this one and and when you see it right oh it causes a sphere she has a little bit of a phobia of it I'm not saying you're sinful I'm just saying it's a phobia so we have a little game in our family of Elizabeth you won't believe this picture right and she's like oh why do you do that to me right just confession today just making making our Spirits right and uh and you'll if she knows it's coming there's just nothing in the world you can do to get her to see it all right because she'll do whatever it takes to avoid the trigger that's just an innocent way to allude to some of the phobias you might have and how much your lives have been altered and your peace and your joy and your course because of this excessive fear of something you're no longer living in the freedom and the Liberty that a Christian ought to have because you're afraid of something and that's what a phobia can be so overwhelming that a person will change their life their life to say things do things do all sorts of things and a phobia can be so tremendous that it'll produce panic attacks now I'm wanting to use this again to tie back into the placebo effect and the nocebo effect relaying a great Foundation while we attack this sin of fear while we attack fear and phobia now a phobia can be so tremendous that not only does a person alter their life but when exposed to it or the very thought that they may be exposed they may not even be close to a clown at all but they can start thinking about it and their heart rate Rises I'm not trying to be funny just using an example that hopefully is a little bit innocent to us but hopefully the devil can be exposed today just by mere fear it's not even present even if it was that spider's not going to hurt you right that little snake doesn't he doesn't even have a bite in it it's dead it's fake right whatever it is but the person through fear can begin to have shaking nausea dry mouth elevated heartbeat sweating this is irregular heartbeat can be diagnosed and it can begin to have difficulty breathing physical symptoms upon the body because the thought and the fear of an image are just even the imagining that something's going to happen this I don't I'm not I'm not just saying this because I I read a Wikipedia entry there's things that I've lived where I've recognized my body is physically breaking down not because I'm sick not because there's a bully getting ready to punch me I'm doing it merely because my mind isn't solid anymore I've let my emotions get away from me I've let the things that have happened instead of me I become a little bit untethered from my faith I'm emitting it in my own weakness that I know what it's like and I'm what it is to realize today that that mindset has the power to grip us physiologically and not just mentally they begin to feel an experience all these physical you can say man you're sweating you're shaking you're breathing heavy even though there's no real danger or actual threat phobias producing physical symptoms anybody know a hypochondriac I don't know if he politically correct to say that anymore I don't know didn't look that up but it's just a simple definition as the person who's overly anxious about their health a person who's overly anxious about their health what's one of the things we've been targeting if your soul is right then our primary concern is that our hearts will be right and if we get that out of balance we become a hypochondriac hypochondria is an obsession with the idea of having serious but undiagnosed medical conditions think of this this is not this is not necessary to put this label on anybody here I would think that this is this is something very rare but we're familiar with the thought that if somebody is anxious and obsessed with this idea of having an undiagnosed medical condition it's a condition which a person is excessively and unduly worried about having a serious illness and what what a lot of the literature and the Academia focuses on when it comes to hypochondria yeah because you'd say well if a person thinks they have cancer and they don't have cancer well just let them it's your life right you can ruin your own party if you want to it just it doesn't stop there though that it's not innocent it's not harmless but they find that the ensuing worry the anxiety the obsession the depression will actually produce their own physical symptoms a hypochondriac you say oh well they're just afraid they're sick if there's nothing wrong but because of this Obsession because of this fear they actually will produce their the fear and the anxiety they hope it's making sense that in itself produces the physical symptoms that then the hypochondriac mistakes as being the symptoms the mistakes those symptoms as being the manifestation of what they're afraid of or worse yet another serious disease is there anybody here that can say Amen they've heard of that they know about that anybody who took the class in in graduate school somebody it's a very real condition that somebody is not actually sick but they are obsessed that they are and they can't ever find the problem and it's not like everything well they seem perfectly healthy no they don't seem perfectly healthy Their Fear and depression and anxiety have now produced their own physical symptoms that the hypochondriac is able to say I thought I knew I had this problem because look right I knew I had this problem because I have these symptoms or it's worse than I thought now it's spread over into this we're doing good on time in Luke chapter 21 verse 25 to 26 . maybe maybe we could pick this up in Greater detail later but I want to end with some um very specific things Jesus prophesying and this this passage has various applications in the time periods that he's prophesying to he says there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the Stars and upon the Earth the stress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring what is what I what an image then he makes a statement men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken the depth of the application of Christ Christ's prophecy the depth of its application to the end time is so vast it's remarkable he says men's Hearts failure them for fear it means men expiring men dying because of fear so that's what Jesus already said Jesus is saying even before we document all these things even before science has come to the place where people are dying of diseases that aren't infectious they're dying from diseases that are at the hands of their own choosing of their own minds their own mental State men's Hearts literally stopping not because of an infectious disease but from dread and anxiety and what stood out to me and I know this may be kind of a large thing just to throw on your plate and then close but he says men's Hearts failing for fear he is looking at the the the numbers of death right he's looking at the um the death rates and he's looking at people dying and he's pointing to the fact that people will be dying because the heart is literally failing because a dread and fear and anxiety and when he does it he now points to one of the greatest risk factors of disease in the end time I don't have time maybe to run through the the numbers on it but the heart disease and the other diseases that we're faced with today they're not necessarily infectious by nature but it has more to do with our our emotions and our spirit and the stress and the anxiety and I say this just my original title today I think was going to be pills and pharmaceuticals or uh phobia and pharmaceuticals I think it was the original title and I was like no I need to deal with phobia first and I'd like to get into pills and potions and protocols and those things and when you think of and this is I think this kind of feeds into some things that we have to be very very careful about but just making an observation and I make it based upon my own research and the conclusions of other practitioners modern medicine was it became very robust and it it has evolved evolved like it did mostly around its success in fighting infectious diseases this is a com a comment from a biologist uh who's an authority in this area says infectious agents were the big source of disease and mortality up until the last century we could find out what the agent was in a sick patient and attack the agent medically that's exactly what happens with the virus and certain things or infections is they recognize this is what's causing it so we can approach this with some sort of agent that's going to address it and in a lot of ways the Health Care System began and began to grow and was it was formed in a way to treat infections which then you can approach in a certain way of how they spread right and how they're infected and how a person can infect somebody else and that's where they come up with certain things that when a person is actually infectious and based upon fever and everything and based upon diagnoses and so you can have a Whole Health Care System that's set up to address infectious diseases but now non-infectious they call it non-infectious diseases non-communicable diseases they call it and they're wanting to change that verbage and I'll mention it here in a moment that's now the most dominant heart disease cancer diabetes these things are all different from the traditional infectious diseases and an infectious disease is I I've got a virus and I and I shake hands with somebody or I cough and I and they get the same virus and it's spread from person to person by infection but if I have diabetes no matter how much sweet tea and and what's the other Diet Coke sweet tea what's the line Lucas How does it go but the kydries sweet tea diabetes is that it yeah but he writes a song and forgets the lyrics a real musician actually um that that no matter what it is if I have that no matter how long I sit next to brother Lucas with my diabetes he's not going to get infected right with it unless my lifestyle influences his lifestyle right and so there's a way that science is recognizing there's one way to treat certain kinds of sicknesses and illnesses when it's viral when it's infectious but now the most dominant are diseases that are not infectious in the traditional sense heart disease prostate cancer breast cancer diabetes obesity and other chronic diseases now account for three quarters of our health care spending and now Medics and what what's happened is medicine this is where this is I'm coming to the end now this is where we're still doing with this phobia in State of Mind and Spirit Christ my healer has a lot to do with healing our spirits and our minds there's more to this ministry but I've said than Divine Healing and what he was talking about when he says that in a number of different places he's talking about the attitudes of the people that fight and split and criticize and he says we need a healing more than just a physical healing we need spiritual healing if salvation is the greatest thing there is and he has atone for that in given us that we need to be very careful that we're not placing all of our emphasis on the physical part without first addressing the mental spiritual part and now medicine is recognizing that these chronic diseases of cardiovascular disease cancer diabetes these other things prostate breast cancer all these different diseases they're realizing that they are communicable as well but in a different way and they've looked at and I know this is maybe slowing down quite a bit here at the end but the causation of these things are linked to they call them risk behaviors such as drinking nutrition inactivity smoking and lists can go on and then the question is if these activities put me at risk of heart disease if these activities are putting me at risk for cancer if these activities are putting me at risk of obesity if these activities are putting me at risk of diabetes then what's causing the risk behavior risk behaviors what causes the smoking what causes the drinking what causes the overeating you know what they predominantly point to stress fear anxiety the very things and then and then you realize the very thing that people pursue it's the pursuit that makes them interrupt their what they want you can get so fixated on pursuing Health it's your Pursuit that's making you unhealthy you can get so fixated on pursuing happiness it's your Pursuit that makes you unhappy is it making sense these very things that have become the biggest the biggest diseases of our time are caused by the behaviors of people in what's driving their behavior is fear anxiety the wrong balance the wrong Pursuits and brother Adam in the church age book writes well now it's strange but in this age of Plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there's so much more to be had with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure suddenly yeah we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation it's remarkable when you read and study this particular phenomena as it relates to human health and mental health they said that and this might seem to be a little bit of a paradox or um contrary to itself but they said for so many centuries man was just so concerned about surviving that he didn't have time to worry about anything I've got to make sure I get my crops planted got to make sure I harvest them got to make sure I'm not eaten by the saber-toothed tiger whatever it is that man was driven by these base needs and now that we get to this place we got so much time right that that our instincts are chain are our our instincts uh those mechanisms that we used to have that we could engage ourselves and be fruitful and do things that took care of and address certain needs and certain wants in our lives that we don't we're not doing that anymore because something else is doing it for us we farmed that out to India we're not doing it anymore and so now we have more time to fear more time to worry more times to satiate ourselves with things that feed our fear and not our faith he says suddenly we find mental illness such a toll to learn the nation taking such a toll mental illness has taken such a toll as to alarm the nation when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night pep pills in the morning I love the descriptive nature because it's so applicable today rushing to doctors entering institutions and trying to drown out in unknown fears by alcohol brother Bam's diagnosing what's driving the risk behaviors is fear they're taking this pill they're taking that pill they're seeking this treatment they're going to this place they're trying to find all these things they're micro dosing they're prescribing they're doing this they're doing that trying to find all sorts of ways they're trying to use whatever it is may not be a pet pill it could just be a Celsius in a can they're all trying to use certain things to get themselves going and brother Brown says and they're trying to ease anxiety trying to drown out unknown fears he says yes this age boasts of its tremendous stores of worldly Goods but the people are less happy than ever and people being less happy than ever have more more greater health problems or if I could change it this way now the predominant health problems aren't necessarily infectious diseases that you have a particular approach for but now it's a lifestyle disease I'll close with this statement in the resurrection of Jesus brother bam says if you notice if you notice it's when you're discouraged that the devil can really pour it on you I think that's good for us to remember that's when he gets you if you come to church and say well I don't know I I don't know whether I could get any better or not or I've been prayed for twice oh my you might as well go home that's all you notice that sense of it's not going to work it's not going to happen but when you can cast that aside and I just love this God don't want you to be frowning God wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy and we have heart diseases the number one killer what's killing a sadness grumpiness edginess stress anxiety says human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't get onto me about my equal you've been worried about the equals going to cause cancer right he says worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't ever be upset just walk in his love knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can harm you there is nothing can harm you there's neither Powers things present things future nothing can separate us from him we are in him and we've never come in by our own will he by choice elected us and brought us into him so it's his business to take up what to take care of what he took himself no man can pluck them from my hands father my father's hands because he's the greatest of them all it's the father who takes care of it who's got any more power than God so what kind of power have you got over you to take care of you the whole powers that created the universe it's the very one that designed the heart it's the very one that designed the body it's the very one that designed you and placed you to be here in this hour he's saying get away from the fear because he says it's the fear the worry that causes cancer it's The Temper that causes cancer they said well I need to see a study on that I I need to see a study all they have to do is put out an article that corn flakes causes rashes and you who had Corn Flakes that day will develop a rash retract it the next day and say oops we meant Fruit Loops and by your luck you switch that morning and guess what you got another rash all because of an irrational fear all because it's seated in your mind the thoughts placed there if you could just recognize how often the devil is trying to mobilize you as believers through extreme ideas by planting a seed in your mind and when it comes down to it we can never bring it back to the word of God therefore it's become a different kind of religion and spiritual adultery against the god who's promised to care for you absolutely he says the whole powers that created the universe is the one that has power over you to take care of you he's the one that made you he's the one brother who said that made the human heart to be happy so it's important that we're healthy it's important that we're happy then let's look to God to meet our needs and let's get rid of the phobia let's address the phobia in our life let's be honest with ourselves about the things that we might actually struggle with the very things that kind of underpin are permanent our our persistent condition God wants us to be healthy if we're not healthy let's be honest about our persistent condition because God's the one who can solve it could we stand together today
