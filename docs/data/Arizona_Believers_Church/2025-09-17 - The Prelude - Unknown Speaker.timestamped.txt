[0:00] Matthew 13 24
[0:03] another parable put he forth unto them
[0:05] saying the kingdom of heaven is likened
[0:07] unto a man which sowed good seed in his
[0:11] field. But while men slept his enemy
[0:13] came and swed tears among the wheat and
[0:16] went his way. But when the blade was
[0:18] sprung up and brought forth fruit, then
[0:20] appeared the tears also. So the servants
[0:22] of the householder came and said unto
[0:24] him, "Sir, did not thou sow good seed in
[0:26] thy field? For whence then hath it
[0:28] tears?" He said unto them, "An enemy
[0:30] hath done this." The servant said unto
[0:33] him, "Wilt thou then that we go and
[0:35] gather them up?" But he said, "Nay, lest
[0:37] while you gather up the tears, ye root
[0:39] up also the wheat with them. Let them
[0:41] both grow up together until the harvest.
[0:43] And in the time of the harvest, I'll say
[0:45] to the reapers, gather ye together first
[0:47] the tears, and bind them in bundles to
[0:48] burn them, but gather the wheat into my
[0:51] barn." Amen. We trust God could bless
[0:53] this to us this evening. You can be
[0:55] seated.
[0:57] I'm going to give the title to my
[0:59] sermon, the prelude.
[1:01] And that's u
[1:03] a short title, a lot of meaning behind
[1:06] it, but it's the prelude. And I'm trying
[1:08] to combine certain elements tonight.
[1:10] Trust that you'll be able to grab a hold
[1:11] of this. Like to give a definition at
[1:13] the outset of kind of what I'm looking
[1:14] at on the prelude. you probably have an
[1:16] idea of what it would mean in different
[1:18] contexts, but in a musical sense, it's
[1:20] that piece or movement uh that
[1:23] introduces a section or composition of a
[1:26] piece of music or a musical composition.
[1:29] And in this introductionally
[1:31] introductional element, it is used in
[1:34] different ways, but one of the things
[1:35] that it does is it establishes the key.
[1:37] It's going to signify and establish the
[1:40] key. If we use something just in the
[1:42] term of a prelude, it's something that's
[1:45] preliminary to an action, something
[1:46] before an event or preliminary to a
[1:48] particular work. And so it's something
[1:51] an action or event that precedes
[1:53] something else. So that prelude, it's
[1:56] that prior before and lude to play is
[1:59] even what it would be in the Latin. So
[2:00] this the prelude is what I'm looking at
[2:02] something that happens before something
[2:05] else, an action or event. and how in the
[2:07] musical context there's a lot of
[2:09] different preludes that are used and in
[2:11] being used they they establish certain
[2:14] meanings and certain feelings. In
[2:16] Matthew chapter 13 as we've read this in
[2:19] verse 24
[2:21] Jesus is going to give them another
[2:24] parable. He's used the parable as we'll
[2:26] identify in a second on the same uh the
[2:28] same principle but he says here that the
[2:31] kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man
[2:33] which sowed good seed in his field. I
[2:35] want to use this sewing of seed as a
[2:38] prelude to growth that in this
[2:40] particular situation uh we can fast
[2:43] forward and see that there's things that
[2:44] come up in the end but he begins with
[2:46] the prelude that one goes out sewing
[2:48] seed. In verse three of the same chapter
[2:51] he says behold a swer went forth to sew.
[2:54] So he's given this parable of a swer who
[2:56] goes forth to sew and he says in verse
[2:58] 18 when he interprets it ye therefore
[3:01] the parable of the swer. So you have us
[3:05] the swer that goes f first with seed and
[3:08] so we say it's this prelude the prelude
[3:10] of the swer and when he comes to verse
[3:13] 31 he's going to give another parable
[3:15] and he says the kingdom of heaven is
[3:17] like a grain of mustard seed which a man
[3:20] took and swed in his field. These are,
[3:24] you know, agricultural references and
[3:26] using these types of one wanting to have
[3:28] a crop and wanting to have grain, uh,
[3:30] here in this case, a tree and different
[3:32] ways that they can harvest and utilize
[3:34] and use all these different things. And
[3:36] he's using this concept in the natural
[3:38] of one that goes first and sews seed.
[3:41] There's going to be other things that
[3:42] happen and there's evidence of growth
[3:44] and there's a final product and then
[3:45] there's a harvesting. But we could see
[3:48] in a number of different places there's
[3:50] this consistent biblical principle and
[3:52] that Jesus draws this type on or it's
[3:55] this biblical principle of an action
[3:57] preceding another action or an event
[4:00] that comes before a result and you could
[4:02] say that this action or result that
[4:04] comes later is contingent upon or it
[4:08] comes after the prelude because the
[4:10] prelude gave forecasting or caused that
[4:13] to happen. I I this is not going to be
[4:16] deep at all. So if you're kind of
[4:17] looking at this saying, I'm going to
[4:18] wait to amen to once it gets deep,
[4:20] you're just going to miss your chance to
[4:21] amen because it's not deep at all. I
[4:23] apologize to the deep seekers tonight.
[4:25] In Matthew chapter 13 36-41,
[4:29] Jesus again giving another parable or
[4:31] giving this he's going to give the
[4:33] translation or the interpretation rather
[4:35] at the disciples request. Then Jesus
[4:37] sent the multitude away and went into
[4:38] the house. And his disciples came unto
[4:40] him, saying, "Declare unto us the
[4:42] parable of the tears of the field." And
[4:46] this is
[4:47] not a question to repeat the parable,
[4:49] but explain it to us. We want to
[4:51] understand. And Jesus answers in verse
[4:52] 37. He says, "He that sweth the good
[4:55] seed is the son of man." So, we've
[4:57] already read the parable of the wheat
[4:59] and the tears, or as they say here, the
[5:01] parable of the wheat, the tears of the
[5:02] field, that the son of man is the one
[5:05] that sowed the good seed that brought up
[5:07] good things. But he said, "The field is
[5:09] the world. The good seed are the
[5:11] children of the kingdom. The tears are
[5:12] the children of the wicked one. The
[5:15] enemy that sowed them is the devil. The
[5:16] harvest is the end of the world, and the
[5:18] reapers are the angels." This is some
[5:20] pretty heavy stuff. If you were the
[5:22] disciples, you say, "Wow, there's some
[5:25] clear events that are being set forth in
[5:27] symbol symbolically that are going that
[5:29] have given us this indication that
[5:31] there's a seed that is sown by the son
[5:33] of man that's going to produce children
[5:34] of God. But then there are tears of the
[5:38] enemy that are going to produce those
[5:39] that are subject to judgment or he says
[5:41] children of the wicked one. And that
[5:43] there's going to be a harvest in the end
[5:46] through these angels. And therefore, the
[5:48] tears are gathered and burned in the
[5:49] fire. So shall it be in the end of this
[5:52] world. The Son of man shall send forth
[5:55] his angels, and they shall gather out of
[5:57] his kingdom all things that offend, and
[5:59] them which do iniquity, and shall cast
[6:01] them into a furnace of fire. There shall
[6:03] be wailing and nashing of teeth. So
[6:06] there is this prelude of a swer going
[6:09] forth to sew good seed. And after he has
[6:12] swn his seed, it's always the enemy's
[6:14] tactic to come afterwards. God sends
[6:16] truth first. The devil comes along and
[6:18] perverts it. And so the son of man has
[6:20] swed good seed into the field that's
[6:22] going to produce a good crop. But then
[6:25] there is this enemy that comes
[6:26] afterwards. So he's not the prelude. If
[6:28] anything, he's a prelude to wickedness.
[6:30] But he's not the focal point. He's the
[6:32] one that gets into confuse and cause
[6:34] confusion and sew discord and tears that
[6:37] are going to try to choke out the wheat
[6:38] and cause uh all sorts of competition
[6:41] for nutrients. And Jesus says, "Just let
[6:42] them alone. In the end, I'm going to
[6:45] send my angels." So now there's this
[6:47] prelude for the gathering together that
[6:49] binds tears and then gathers the wheat
[6:51] and there's going to be a a rapture of
[6:54] the wheat. There's going to be a burning
[6:55] of the tears and they're going to be
[6:56] cast into the fiery this furnace of
[6:59] fire. And so then you see this prelude
[7:01] to burning and judgment.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; And this I'm wanting to use this image
[7:06] of the swer as a critical prelude. It's
[7:10] something that comes before. I'm calling
[7:11] it the prelude, and we could use that in
[7:13] certain context, but it's something
[7:15] that's important and significant. The
[7:17] prelude establishes the key. It's used
[7:21] as a a device to establish to set the
[7:24] tone and it forms an introduction to
[7:26] that musical work. It forms an
[7:28] introduction to the masterpiece. It'll
[7:30] it can be an introduction to a
[7:32] composition of a symphony. And what uh
[7:36] it's what comes before right maybe I
[7:39] should say it this way what comes before
[7:40] in the prelude gives some indication of
[7:43] what's to come.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; When the ser went forth to sew seed you
[7:47] you should expect a plant
[7:50] &gt;&gt; a crop a garden something to grow from
[7:53] the ground. They don't go forth sewing
[7:54] seed and you begin to look up for hot
[7:56] air balloons that there's some uh
[7:58] reverse effect where these things happen
[8:00] in another atmosphere. But the sewing of
[8:02] the seed indicates that there's going to
[8:04] be something to grow. So it forecast
[8:06] just even as you would broadcast seed,
[8:08] it forecasts that there's going to be a
[8:10] crop to come. So there's a foreshadowing
[8:12] in in the sewing of seed. And in a
[8:16] musical sense, if it it suggests the
[8:19] tone or even the theme in a literary
[8:21] sense, there's some priming in the
[8:23] prelude. Uh there there's something that
[8:25] gets the audience ready, the reader
[8:27] ready. There's uh there's even with uh
[8:30] musical compositions, there's these
[8:31] harmonic hints that are being given
[8:33] where you can get an idea. Oh, this is
[8:34] what this piece is going to sound like.
[8:37] Specifically, as I've been reading on
[8:39] this that it's it kind of sets the mood,
[8:41] establishes this emotional resonance. It
[8:44] it it it uh introduces the thematic DNA
[8:47] of a musical piece. It signals the tone.
[8:50] There's a lot that happens just in this
[8:52] this prelude. It's not just used to warm
[8:55] up. It's not just used in in a and kind
[8:58] of a a sense of jazz and just to be a
[9:01] bunch of noise, but there's this
[9:02] symbolic layering that's strategically
[9:05] powerful
[9:07] and it reveal it. It happens with
[9:09] respect to visual arts and the uh
[9:11] musical and even the narrative context.
[9:14] It's this when you think of that this
[9:16] symbolic layering and has power. It's
[9:19] significant. It's strategically
[9:21] powerful.
[9:25] It introduces
[9:28] a a kind of this emotional element or
[9:29] pallet to the musical piece. Shopen and
[9:32] Bach and their musical pieces, they have
[9:33] a lot of preludes. They're not warm-ups,
[9:34] but they establish these tonal centers.
[9:37] They they build this emotional tension.
[9:38] It's critical to the piece. Uh that's
[9:41] enough music class.
[9:43] But with that in mind, I want just to
[9:45] establish maybe something you can be
[9:46] familiar with as to how this prelude's
[9:49] important. I'm using this slide up here
[9:51] that says the key. We preached on the
[9:52] key. And so that was critical. Christ is
[9:55] the key. Takes the hand of faith to grab
[9:58] a hold of that key. And so there's this
[9:59] prelude. Think of this. This prelude to
[10:02] that establishes the key. The prelude to
[10:05] the masterpiece. The prelude to the
[10:06] actual work. In Galatians 6:7, it says,
[10:10] "Be not deceived. God is not mocked. For
[10:12] whatsoever a man seweth, that shall he
[10:14] also reap." Believe the reason why he
[10:16] says God is not mocked is because
[10:19] there's this immutable law of the
[10:20] harvest. Genesis chapter 1 teaches us
[10:23] that there is this law that you reap
[10:25] what you sow. God having sowed seed in
[10:28] the beginning and brought forth
[10:29] everything we know in light and life and
[10:31] creation and substance. That is a law
[10:33] that God has established. He says you
[10:35] can't mock God and think that what you
[10:38] sow you will not reap.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; So it is an immutable or unchangeable
[10:42] law of the harvest. And the sewing here
[10:45] is the it's a plant seeds. The idea of
[10:48] the the word just even speaks of that
[10:49] soil being pierced and a seed planted
[10:52] within and the seed being planted has a
[10:54] germ of life or that which is sown is
[10:57] that seed. It has a germ of life and
[10:58] there's a nature and a life within that
[11:00] seed and and and it's going to live and
[11:03] it's that process of growth that
[11:04] expresses what's been sown. So you have
[11:07] a seed it just was like a grain or a
[11:08] kernel and if you know the nature of
[11:10] that there's some meaning it establishes
[11:12] some sense of expectation or
[11:14] foreshadowing. I'm sewing wheat seed
[11:16] into the ground. Then in the the prelude
[11:19] of sewing seed, it builds this
[11:21] anticipation and expectation of a
[11:23] certain type of plant that ought to be
[11:24] growing. That's why when the the labor
[11:27] said, "Wow, I thought you sowed good
[11:29] seed and wheat, but now I'm looking out
[11:31] here and I'm seeing something
[11:32] different." Why? Because that his the
[11:34] prelude of the sewer established a
[11:36] certain expectation. this this pallet
[11:39] this this foreshadowing this this uh
[11:42] symbolic layering
[11:44] in 2 Corinthians chapter 9:6 it says but
[11:47] this I say he which sweth sparingly
[11:50] shall reap also sparingly and he which
[11:52] seweth bountifully shall reap also
[11:54] bountifully believe this connects back
[11:56] to the law that cannot be mocked God is
[11:58] not mocked whatever you sow you reap but
[12:00] now we see that what is sown it matters
[12:02] but also how much is sown
[12:05] &gt;&gt; that there is some measure of how you
[12:07] labor labor in sewing can give you some
[12:09] indication of how much you ought to be
[12:11] able to reap.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; If you just plant a few seeds, you
[12:15] wouldn't expect more than just a few
[12:16] plants.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; And so there's even the strategy in
[12:20] sewing. And I'm not going to pretend to
[12:21] be a green thumb even though I have some
[12:23] plants in my office. But there are uh
[12:26] there's idea that you're sewing seed
[12:28] even with the understanding that not all
[12:30] the seeds will yield.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; And so say I just want I just want to
[12:34] have a really good cucumber sandwich.
[12:35] So, I'm just going to put one seed in
[12:37] the ground and hope that I get it. Well,
[12:40] you're just risking the chance of not
[12:42] getting cucumbers. But you can be pretty
[12:44] sure that you're only going to get one
[12:46] plant if you plant one seed.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; And somebody's going to produce a
[12:50] Wikipedia article that shows that
[12:51] cucumbers actually produce 10 plants per
[12:53] se. But you get the point. That's where
[12:55] you miss the point. I'm not saying thus
[12:57] sayeth the Lord, cucumbers seeds only
[13:00] produce one cucumber plant. I'm just
[13:02] saying hey you know just work with me in
[13:04] this example
[13:07] of sewing how to the extent that you sew
[13:10] if the labor in sewing is going to
[13:12] determine and give you some expectation
[13:14] as to what you harvest. Notice I'm
[13:16] speaking personally to you in 1
[13:19] Corinthians 3 5-6 who then is Paul and
[13:22] who is Apollos but ministers by whom you
[13:24] believed even as the Lord gave to every
[13:26] man. last couple services and the
[13:28] subjects we were ministering on and it
[13:30] Rebecca's resolve and even the sermon
[13:32] prior to that last Wednesday on how that
[13:34] God uses this leading and there's this
[13:37] idea of following the leader that
[13:39] there's going to be one that composes
[13:41] something then there's going to be a
[13:43] conductor that works closely with the
[13:45] performers according to that composition
[13:47] we see Ezer is being one that's
[13:50] fulfilling
[13:51] uh who's fulfilling Abraham's will and
[13:54] we use this example of how people can be
[13:56] very carnal about the man and say, "Oh,
[13:58] well, I am of Paul and I'm of Apollos."
[14:00] But then Paul says, "These men are sent
[14:03] by God for you to believe."
[14:06] &gt;&gt; He says, "I have planted Apollos
[14:08] watered, but God gave the increase." So
[14:10] then neither is he that planteth
[14:12] anything, neither he that waterth, but
[14:14] God that God giveth the increase.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; Now he that planteth and he that waterth
[14:19] are one, and every man shall receive his
[14:21] own reward according to his own labor.
[14:24] So there's the principle once again in
[14:26] the Bible that where there has been a
[14:28] sewing, God will reward you according to
[14:30] your labor
[14:32] &gt;&gt; that one has planted in the church as
[14:34] Paul says, I planted, Apollos watered,
[14:36] but then it's still God in all to cause
[14:39] the increase.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; Such that he that planteth and he that
[14:42] water, though they be individuals,
[14:43] they're part of one labor and one work,
[14:45] but then each man is going to receive of
[14:47] his own labor. It speaks again to this
[14:49] principle of God using one beforehand,
[14:52] sending sending the uh Paul and Apollos,
[14:55] one to plant, one to water in order for
[14:57] there to be a harvest.
[15:00] So God uses the prelude
[15:04] as we alluded to a moment ago in Genesis
[15:06] 4 24:7
[15:09] when Eleazar was concerned. Well, what
[15:11] if the woman doesn't follow me? Abraham
[15:14] says, "Well, God, the same God that
[15:16] called me and has led me here, he shall
[15:18] send his angel before thee." So when
[15:21] Eleazar is telling the story later, he
[15:22] says about his master, he says, "He said
[15:24] to me, the Lord before whom I walk will
[15:27] send his angel with thee and prosper thy
[15:30] way." This is just not a passenger. This
[15:33] is an active participant in the
[15:34] performance wherein he's going to send
[15:36] his angel. And the angel's job is to
[15:38] bless and to prosper his way. and thou
[15:40] shalt take a wife for this my son of my
[15:43] kindred and of my father's house. It's
[15:45] going to be blessed. It's going to be
[15:47] successful.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; This pattern continues in many different
[15:50] ways.
[15:52] Want to use some of the obvious ones. In
[15:54] Exodus chapter 3, when it came time for
[15:56] the seed that was sold journeying in a
[15:58] strange land, remember Rebecca's resolve
[16:00] to follow Eleazar to meet Isaac? It it
[16:03] foreshadowed the faith that her own
[16:05] people would have one day, being in a
[16:07] strange land, having to follow a man out
[16:09] of Egypt back to a land they'd never
[16:10] seen before.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; And so her resolve to follow and feel
[16:14] led of the Lord through that vessel and
[16:16] through that man is going to take shape
[16:19] now after these these years according to
[16:20] prophecy. And this time is filled up and
[16:23] it's time for their deliverance. And God
[16:25] says in verse 8, "And I am come down to
[16:27] deliver them out of the hand of the
[16:29] Egyptians, and to bring them up out of
[16:31] the land unto a good land and a large,
[16:33] unto a land flowing with milk and honey,
[16:35] unto the place of the Canaanites and the
[16:37] Hittites and the Amorites and the
[16:38] Perizzites and the Hivites and the
[16:39] Jebusites."
[16:41] So this is God saying, "Now's the
[16:43] moment. Now's the time. I am come down."
[16:45] And if we could put it this way, God
[16:47] says, "I have come to deliver them out."
[16:51] And his purpose is in God's words. I
[16:54] will take them out and bring them in. So
[16:56] that's God's promise.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; He'll take them out and bring them in.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; If you want to read in your Bible,
[17:01] you'll find that God when he speaks to
[17:03] Moses, he tells them this in verse 10.
[17:06] Come now, therefore, and I will send
[17:08] thee into Pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[17:11] forth my people, the children of Israel,
[17:13] out of Egypt.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; So God had come down to bring them out
[17:16] and in two. But Moses is only going to
[17:18] fulfill a part of that. This is what God
[17:20] wants to do. But yet Moses is only going
[17:22] to be the one. He's going to be the one
[17:24] that God uses. He is the prelude of the
[17:27] Exodus. A prophet is the prelude. Yes,
[17:29] God came down to deliver them. But Moses
[17:31] is going to be that initial act to
[17:33] signal this is the moment. This is the
[17:35] time.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; So the prelude of the Exodus is a
[17:38] prophet Moses being led of the spirit
[17:42] &gt;&gt; to bring them out.
[17:44] In Exodus 23:20, it said this way,
[17:46] "Behold, I send an angel before thee to
[17:49] keep thee in the way and to bring thee
[17:51] into the place which I have prepared."
[17:54] It's this very specific uh function of
[17:58] an angel, the leading of the spirit, the
[17:59] leading of the Lord. And then there's
[18:00] this one who is following that leading
[18:03] and he becomes the prelude. They knew
[18:05] that it was the time of their
[18:06] deliverance when God sent the prelude.
[18:08] And based upon what he was signifying,
[18:10] he was saying, he was letting them know
[18:12] this is the time of the Exodus. This is
[18:14] the time of the deliverance.
[18:16] Deuteronomy 1:es 29-33.
[18:21] God, it's spoken this way. Then I said
[18:24] unto you, dread not neither be afraid of
[18:26] them. The Lord your God will goeth
[18:28] before you. He shall fight for you.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; So notice the prelude. God going before
[18:35] &gt;&gt; something that he's doing in
[18:37] preparation. if you wanted to drill down
[18:39] and get into more details just to use
[18:40] them as types that that the ground has
[18:42] to be prepared and there's certain
[18:43] things are made ready and there's this
[18:45] whole cycles and seasons where one is
[18:47] leading into the next. But he says, "I'm
[18:48] going to go before you and fight for you
[18:50] according to all he did for you in Egypt
[18:52] before your eyes and in the wilderness
[18:54] where thou hast seen how the Lord thy
[18:56] God bear thee as a man doth bear his son
[18:58] in all the way that you went until you
[19:00] came into this place. Yet in this thing
[19:02] you did not believe the Lord your God."
[19:05] Now, that's this rebuke for them not
[19:07] believing all that he had done in
[19:09] following his prophet who went in the
[19:10] way before you to search you out of
[19:12] place to pit your tits in in fire by
[19:16] night to show you by what you should go
[19:19] and in a cloud by day. Notice that even
[19:22] in this journey as they were journeying,
[19:25] the prelude in the journey was a cloud
[19:27] by day and a fire by night. Might sound
[19:30] better if you sung it. Cloud by day,
[19:33] fire by the night. Right? It's a
[19:35] beautiful melody. It's something that
[19:36] they were following, something that was
[19:38] leading them.
[19:40] The prelude, they knew it was time to
[19:42] move. When the pillar fire moved at
[19:44] night, they they knew to follow the
[19:46] cloud by day. There was something that
[19:48] there was a prelude. Once it started
[19:49] moving, what did it signify? Time to get
[19:51] up and go.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; And even in Christ coming,
[19:57] there was the prelude to the key.
[20:00] God sent a prelude to his masterpiece.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; He sent a prelude to Christ. And really,
[20:08] just consider this biblical truth as
[20:11] we've just used a few. We've used this
[20:13] principle of sewing seed and what it
[20:15] produces. And there is the prelude of
[20:17] the sewer. We see the prelude in our own
[20:19] lives of what we sew is what we reap. We
[20:21] see that in the Exodus, God sent the
[20:23] prelude uh signs and wonders to the
[20:25] prophet, but then sends the prophet to
[20:27] bring them out of Egypt. the prelude of
[20:29] the cloud and the fire. There's certain
[20:31] things that God does beforehand as a
[20:33] means of accomplishing his will.
[20:36] Says in Isaiah 40:es 3, 4, and 5, the
[20:39] voice of him that crith in the
[20:40] wilderness, prepare ye the way of the
[20:42] Lord. Make straight in the desert a
[20:44] highway for our God. Every valley shall
[20:47] be exalted, and every mountain and hill
[20:48] shall be made low, and the crooked shall
[20:50] be made straight, and the rough places
[20:52] plain, and the glory of the Lord shall
[20:54] be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
[20:56] together. For the mouth of the Lord hath
[20:58] spoken it. It's widely to believe be
[21:01] believed to be a prophecy associated
[21:02] with the Messiah to the Jews. And it's a
[21:06] voice as a prelude to the Messiah. Then
[21:08] there's very specific instances are
[21:10] happening. Every valley is going to be
[21:12] exalted. Every mountain and hill is
[21:13] going to be made low and crooked made
[21:14] straight and rough places and the Lord's
[21:17] going to be revealed and all flesh will
[21:18] see him. So it does create some an image
[21:21] of something in your mind you can begin
[21:23] to interpret incorrectly.
[21:25] But yet it does signify that there's
[21:27] going to be a voice crying in the
[21:30] wilderness before saying prepare which
[21:33] is the prelude to the Messiah.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; So in Matthew 3:3 it says for this is he
[21:39] that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah
[21:41] saying the voice of one crying in the
[21:43] wilderness
[21:45] prepare ye the way of the Lord make his
[21:48] path straight.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist fulfills this prophecy
[21:52] in Isaiah 40. Now, we could say, well,
[21:55] God could just send the Messiah. He
[21:58] could just send the Christ. Could have
[22:00] clearly done that. But yet, he already
[22:03] said beforehand, according to his
[22:04] composition, that he was going to send
[22:07] one before him. In Malachi 3:1, "Behold,
[22:10] I s will send my messenger, and he shall
[22:13] prepare the way before me." It's a
[22:15] repeat even in similar language to
[22:17] Isaiah 40. And I'm not reading all of
[22:20] the all the prophecies to be exhausted.
[22:22] and the Lord whom you seek shall
[22:24] suddenly come to his temple. Even the
[22:26] messenger of the covenant whom you
[22:28] delight in, behold, he shall come, saith
[22:30] the Lord of hosts. Once again, there was
[22:32] this expectation by the Jews that the
[22:34] Messiah would suddenly come to the
[22:36] temple. He'd be found there in Jerusalem
[22:37] in the temple, and all the flesh will
[22:40] see him, and the glory of God's going to
[22:41] be revealed. And I believe that this is
[22:43] one of the things that Satan was trying
[22:45] to tempt him to do according to this
[22:47] prophecy is to cast himself off the peak
[22:49] of the temple so that everyone could see
[22:51] and what? Tempt God.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; But this is a prophecy again that
[22:56] there's not just going to be a voice
[22:57] before his face, but now there's the
[22:59] prelude of a messenger and he's also
[23:03] going to prepare or go before and make
[23:06] preparation for the revealing of the
[23:07] Messiah.
[23:09] In Mark 1:es 1-4, the beginning of the
[23:12] gospel of Jesus Christ, the son of God,
[23:14] and it is written in the prophets,
[23:15] "Behold, I send my messenger before thy
[23:18] face, which shall prepare the way before
[23:20] thee." We could see uh hints of Malachi
[23:24] 3. And then it also says, "The voice of
[23:27] one crying in the wilderness, prepare
[23:28] you the way of the Lord, make his path
[23:30] straight." We see hints of Isaiah 40.
[23:32] says, "John did baptize in the
[23:34] wilderness and preach the baptism of
[23:36] repentance for the remission of sins."
[23:39] Here's your fulfilling.
[23:41] There is a fulfilling of Isaiah 40,
[23:43] there's a fulfilling of of Malachi
[23:46] 3. Matthew 3 tells us this. Mark chapter
[23:50] 1 is telling us this.
[23:53] And then in Matthew 11:10,
[23:56] speaking of John the Baptist, and I know
[23:58] I'm not breaking new ground here where
[24:00] everybody's like, "Wow, okay, this is
[24:01] awesome. We know who John the Baptist
[24:03] is.
[24:05] But it says, "For this is he of whom it
[24:06] is written." Even after his John's own
[24:08] disciples begin to inquire and to ask,
[24:10] he says, "This is uh uh he of whom it is
[24:12] written, behold, I send my messenger
[24:14] before thy face, which shall prepare thy
[24:17] way before thee."
[24:19] There had to be a prelude first.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; We could use the terminology a
[24:23] forerunner. The forerunner had to come
[24:26] first. Even in the prophecy to
[24:28] Zachchariah before the birth of John in
[24:30] that time that he was going to be born.
[24:31] It says in Lukeap 1:1 17. This is what
[24:34] the angel says. So we could take the
[24:36] angel's words. Jesus says this is the
[24:38] one sent before my face. Now the angel
[24:41] says he shall be go before him the M
[24:44] messiah the the most high. He shall go
[24:46] before him in the spirit and power of
[24:49] Elijah.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; This is John the Baptist. The angels
[24:52] telling Zechariah, you're you're going
[24:55] to bring forth a son who is going to be
[24:58] anointed uh with the spirit of Elijah to
[25:01] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[25:02] children and the disobedient to the
[25:05] wisdom of the just and to make ready a
[25:07] people prepared for the Lord.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; Now, talk about layering.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; You talk about some pretty awesome
[25:16] layering things together.
[25:18] There's fulfillments of Malachi 3 and
[25:21] Malachi 4 mentioned in this.
[25:24] These are things that are being kind of
[25:26] blended
[25:28] together because you see different
[25:30] parts. You can say, "Oh, that looks like
[25:31] Isaiah uh 40. That looks like Malachi 3.
[25:34] This looks like Malachi 4." And these
[25:36] all these elements are there. And so
[25:38] Jesus says in Matthew 11:14, the angel
[25:41] said, "This is what John's going to do."
[25:43] And Jesus substantiates it. He says, "If
[25:45] you will receive it, this is Elijah
[25:47] which was for to come."
[25:50] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist, if you're looking, if
[25:52] I tell you that I'm the son of man, if
[25:54] I'm indicating to you that I've come in
[25:55] my father's name, and that I am the
[25:57] long- awaited Messiah, I'm letting you
[26:00] know that this is the spirit of Elijah
[26:02] that was to come as a prelude to the
[26:05] man, the Messiah being seen.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; That I'm not here without my
[26:10] introduction. I'm not here without the
[26:12] foreshadowing. I'm not here without the
[26:14] the the the tone having been set
[26:16] already.
[26:18] It's already in and been indicated in
[26:22] the sheet music and now the prelude.
[26:25] So, we've established scripturally, I
[26:28] hope that we can see John fulfilling
[26:31] Malachi chapter 4. And I say fulfilling
[26:35] and that Jesus has said it, the angel
[26:37] has said it, we see him associated with
[26:39] Malachi 3 and Isaiah 40. So then in John
[26:42] 1 21 they asked him what then
[26:46] art thou Elijah. So they asked him if he
[26:49] was Elijah and what they're asking is
[26:52] not uh if he was the actual Elijah but
[26:56] have you come as the Elijah the prophet
[27:00] in that spirit and he says I am not. So
[27:04] he denies fulfilling the promise of
[27:06] Elijah. Then he says, 'Art thou that?'
[27:09] They ask, "Art thou that prophet?" I
[27:12] often read it to mean like kind of
[27:14] drilling down again. "No, I'm not
[27:16] Elijah." Well, are you that prophet? But
[27:18] there is a a language that suggests when
[27:20] he says no, that that prophet is most
[27:23] likely referring to the Christ, the
[27:25] Messiah, because he was that prophet
[27:28] that would be raised up like an unto
[27:29] Moses. So he denies being the Christ as
[27:33] well he should. But he causes a little
[27:35] bit of dissonance when he denies
[27:37] actually being a fulfillment of the
[27:39] spirit of Elijah. Are you Elijah? No,
[27:43] I'm not. Are you the Messiah then? No, I
[27:47] am not. And why would John answer with
[27:51] such clarity and the scriptures share it
[27:53] with us that he seems to not be uh
[27:55] hedging at all on this? When they ask
[27:57] him if he's a particular Elijah, an
[27:59] anointing of Elijah, he says, "No." Why
[28:01] would he say that? In Malachi 4:es 5 and
[28:05] 6, he says, "Behold, I'll send you
[28:06] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[28:08] the great and dreadful day of the Lord."
[28:11] So, here's the prelude of Elijah before
[28:13] the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
[28:15] Why doesn't God just send the great and
[28:16] dreadful day? Well, we may I ask him one
[28:19] day. But he said, "I will send it, but I
[28:21] won't send it lest I send Elijah's
[28:23] spirit first."
[28:24] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And he shall turn the
[28:26] hearts of the fathers to the children,
[28:28] and the heart of the children to their
[28:30] fathers, lest I come and smite the earth
[28:32] with the curse." So there's a a lot of
[28:35] things happening here in this verse. A
[28:38] lot of things happening in these verses,
[28:40] a lot of things happening in this
[28:41] chapter and also happening in the entire
[28:44] book.
[28:46] I will send you the spirit of Elijah.
[28:50] Jesus says if you can receive it, this
[28:52] is Elijah that must come.
[28:55] And the angel said that he would turn
[28:57] the hearts of the fathers to the
[28:58] children.
[29:00] And that so then you could see here in
[29:01] Malachi 4:6, he turns the hearts of the
[29:03] ch the fathers to the children. And
[29:06] Malachi 4:6 says, "And the heart of the
[29:07] children to their fathers." So notice
[29:10] when the angel says, "And the
[29:11] disobedient to the wisdom of the just."
[29:14] He's giving us some understanding of
[29:17] what that means. That it's it's not just
[29:20] fathers to the children, childrens to
[29:22] the father, but there's symbolic
[29:23] language that's being used to say he's
[29:25] going to turn the hearts of the children
[29:27] to their fathers. So the spirit of
[29:30] Elijah is not just to turn father's
[29:32] hearts to children. But watch the
[29:34] layering of this prophecy.
[29:37] Elijah would also turn the hearts of uh
[29:41] children's hearts. turn those children's
[29:44] hearts to the fathers
[29:46] &gt;&gt; prior to a judgment into a burning.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; He's also going to, as the angel said,
[29:52] there's this spirit of Elijah that is to
[29:54] turn the disobedient of the wisdom up to
[29:57] the wisdom of the just.
[30:01] As it says, lest I come and smite the
[30:02] earth with a curse. This is foreshadowed
[30:04] in verse one. For behold, the day cometh
[30:06] that shall burn as an oven, and all the
[30:08] proud, yay, and all that do wickedly
[30:09] shall be stubble. And the day that
[30:11] cometh shall burn them up, sayaith the
[30:13] Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them
[30:14] neither root nor branch. But unto you
[30:17] that fear my name shall the son of
[30:19] righteousness arise with healing in his
[30:21] wings, and ye shall go forth. So there's
[30:24] this the prelude of the son of
[30:25] righteousness. You're going to go forth
[30:27] and grow up as calves of the stall, and
[30:29] ye shall tread down the wicked, for they
[30:31] shall be ashes unto the souls of your
[30:32] feet in the day that I shall do this,
[30:35] sayeth the Lord of hosts.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Thus, we can see that there is a
[30:39] pointing to different manifestations of
[30:43] the Messiah.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; This is just how God oftentimes layers
[30:47] his prophecies to where he says, "I am
[30:48] come down to deliver my children out of
[30:50] Egypt." So, you get the sense that Moses
[30:52] is going to come. He's going to take
[30:53] them out and he says, "And I'm going to
[30:55] bring them in." And then Moses comes, he
[30:56] takes them out, but Moses isn't the one
[30:57] that brings them in.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; He does event. There's God brings them
[31:00] in eventually.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; There's prophecies in Isaiah that are
[31:04] separated by commas that separated them
[31:07] by hundreds of years from one side to
[31:08] the next. And here we can see that this
[31:10] time, he says, they're going to be ashes
[31:12] under your feet in the day that I do
[31:14] this.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; So he says, remember the law that I gave
[31:17] you that I will use prophets and send
[31:19] them before I do something. And he says,
[31:21] "According to that law, I will send you
[31:23] Elijah the prophet."
[31:27] &gt;&gt; And so when John is asked, "Is he is he
[31:29] Elijah?" He knew that he came fulfilling
[31:32] Isaiah 40. He knew he came fulfilling as
[31:34] Malachi 3. He knew he came fulfilling to
[31:36] turn the hearts of the fathers back to
[31:38] the children. He knew that he had the
[31:39] spirit of Elijah on him. But he also
[31:41] knew that there was more that was meant
[31:43] and intended in that scripture.
[31:46] Maybe in his mind he's thinking there
[31:49] has to be this Messiah that conquers
[31:51] everything
[31:52] &gt;&gt; and I'm not so sure anymore because I
[31:55] don't see that happening.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; And so there's this hedge and what did
[31:58] Jesus say? Go back and tell him what you
[32:00] see.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; And he begins to tell him this is what
[32:03] was promised in this ministry. The sight
[32:05] will come. The blind will be healed.
[32:07] This is what was promised. Not the
[32:08] judgment and burning yet.
[32:11] So Malachi contains different layers of
[32:13] prophecy while declaring to us
[32:15] scripturally what this spirit of Elijah
[32:17] will do. Elijah will be the prelude to
[32:20] turning of hearts and a prelude to the
[32:23] day of judgment and burning just as we
[32:26] saw in Matthew chapter 13. He's going to
[32:28] send his angels and there's going to be
[32:30] a gathering together before judgment.
[32:34] So Matthew chapter 17 10-13. I I hope
[32:37] you're really paying attention tonight
[32:39] because I don't think this is going to
[32:40] go where you think it's going to go.
[32:43] That's a good thing. You're like, we
[32:45] kind of were thinking this would end
[32:47] well, but now we're thinking this is
[32:49] you're forecasting a failure. Matthew
[32:51] chapter 17 10-13 and the discip his
[32:54] disciples asked him saying because
[32:56] they're realizing the Messiah's manifest
[32:58] himself that he's he's declared himself
[33:00] to be the Christ.
[33:03] And even as they have said, thou art the
[33:05] Christ, the son of the living God, and
[33:07] thou the my father has revealed this to
[33:09] you. So very heavy heavy things. Why
[33:12] then say the scribes that Elijah must
[33:14] first come? So this was a commonly held
[33:16] viewpoint.
[33:19] It has been interpreted that Elijah will
[33:22] come first.
[33:24] He must come and introduce the Messiah.
[33:26] as even in the the Greek classics and
[33:28] some of the uh uh the earlier works of
[33:31] philosophy after Jesus Christ and the
[33:33] debates of the rabbis with the Greeks
[33:35] and there's this even this uh
[33:37] conversation or dialogue of trophus I
[33:39] believe it is where he says unless
[33:40] Elijah comes and anoints that man he
[33:44] cannot be the Messiah.
[33:46] So there's this strong held belief that
[33:48] in order for the Messiah to be who he
[33:50] was there had to be Elijah to come
[33:52] beforehand. So then Jesus answered
[33:55] because he's saying, "Shouldn't Elijah
[33:56] come first?" He says, "Lias truly shall
[34:00] first come and restore all things."
[34:03] Now notice in the order of this, Jesus
[34:05] speaks in a future tense. He shall come,
[34:08] and he speaks specifically to the type
[34:10] of ministry, restore all things.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; He says, "But I say unto you that Elijah
[34:16] has come already."
[34:18] &gt;&gt; So he's saying that he will come
[34:21] and restore all things. So that gives
[34:23] you some indication of what he's talking
[34:24] about that spirit of Elijah will be or
[34:26] when it will be. But he says he has come
[34:28] already and they knew him not but have
[34:29] done unto him whatsoever they wanted.
[34:30] They listed likewise shall also the son
[34:33] of man suffer of them. The prelude gave
[34:36] a prelude to what he was going to
[34:38] suffer. When John the Baptist came in
[34:41] the spirit of Elijah, they rejected him
[34:43] and they they they put him to death. He
[34:45] says likewise the son of man is going to
[34:47] suffer of the same generation. So I tell
[34:49] you that the son of man is here. the
[34:51] Messiah is here and that the Elijah that
[34:54] was to come, if you can receive it, this
[34:56] Elijah has come, but he's saying that he
[35:00] shall first come and restore all things.
[35:03] He's speaking in future tense.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Now, I I would say and I and I want to
[35:09] say this with all respect,
[35:13] these things are hard things to wrestle
[35:15] with.
[35:18] I mean, it would be really nice if he
[35:19] could just give us dates,
[35:22] right? Why can't, you know, why couldn't
[35:25] God be more like Nostradamus?
[35:29] Which one of my best puns I've ever
[35:30] used, I put a hat on my head and called
[35:32] myself Nostradamus. That was kind of a
[35:34] classic hat and I thought it was a
[35:36] pretty funny joke. But there is this
[35:38] idea of man, people can be so precise.
[35:42] the spirit of Elijah is going to come in
[35:44] the year 1906 and this is what it's
[35:46] going to do and everybody could just
[35:47] wait until that time and like well I
[35:49] mean we're all vying for it at that
[35:50] point right I'm the one I'm the one I'm
[35:53] but God doesn't deal in those kind of
[35:54] specificities he says things and then
[35:56] brings it to pass
[35:58] &gt;&gt; so there's there's this language that's
[36:00] used in the scripture that would cause
[36:01] one to wrestle say well when he says he
[36:03] shall first come is he saying that this
[36:06] idea that he will come in restore all
[36:07] things speak of this coming then he says
[36:09] he has come so he says he will come but
[36:11] he's already come Is that what he means?
[36:13] Cuz that's not what it says.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; And maybe one could wrestle that out to
[36:16] some satisfaction to say if you can
[36:18] receive it. John the Baptist completely
[36:20] fulfills the preludes to the Messiah.
[36:24] But in Acts 3 19 to 21 says, "Repent ye
[36:29] therefore and be converted that your
[36:30] sins may be blotted out when the times
[36:32] of refreshing shall come from the
[36:34] presence of the Lord." And it says, "And
[36:36] he shall send Jesus Christ which before
[36:39] was preached unto you." Christ no doubt
[36:42] was preached before by the prophets and
[36:44] he came and he was manifested and
[36:46] crucified and died and and rose on the
[36:49] third day and and has ascended into
[36:51] heaven. So he says he will send him the
[36:53] same Christ that was before preached.
[36:55] And then this gives us all the clues as
[36:56] to where he's orienting us whom the
[36:58] heavens must receive.
[37:02] He has ascended into heaven. We see that
[37:04] in chapter 1. Now, there's this future
[37:05] forward-looking prophecy where it says,
[37:07] "The heavens have received him unto
[37:10] what?"
[37:12] Is anybody else reading this along with
[37:14] me here?
[37:16] In in our youth meetings, there's so
[37:18] many young people that flip in their
[37:20] Bibles and want to read. Like, I got it.
[37:22] I say so many. I could count them on my
[37:23] hand.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; There's some really really good
[37:26] students.
[37:28] And so
[37:30] when you're when you're looking at this
[37:33] and he's speaking this beautiful sermon,
[37:41] he says, "The heavens have received
[37:42] Christ until the times of restitution of
[37:46] all things." You know what that phrase
[37:47] is? The restoration of all things,
[37:50] &gt;&gt; which God hath spoken by the mouth of
[37:53] all his holy prophets since the world
[37:55] began.
[37:56] So, not only has Jesus used a language
[37:59] that puts this coming of Elijah in a
[38:01] future tense, now Peter in the in Acts
[38:03] chapter 3 is saying he shall send
[38:05] Christ. Future tense, future event.
[38:08] Jesus has ascended. The spirit has
[38:10] descended. But uh but there's going to
[38:13] be one day another revealing. Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; And he points to the prophecy in in
[38:19] Matthew 17 11 of an Elijah as the
[38:23] prelude of the restoration of all
[38:25] things. Where where does Peter get it?
[38:28] Jesus says Elijah shall come in the
[38:31] future to restore all things. So Peter's
[38:33] preaching says there's going to be a
[38:35] restoration of all things. We don't see
[38:37] the restoration of all things. He Jesus
[38:39] told us to preach the gospel and to do
[38:41] these things because the kingdom is
[38:43] going to come one day in in a greater
[38:45] manner that we were expecting now. But
[38:47] now is the time of repentance. Now he
[38:49] calls all men everywhere to repent.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; But there's going to be a restoration of
[38:56] all things.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; It's going to be another prelude turning
[38:59] the disobedient of the wisdom to the
[39:01] just because that prophecy is not to the
[39:04] Jews only. But the angel used a language
[39:06] to let us know that it also means the
[39:08] Gentiles
[39:10] &gt;&gt; because it said the disobedient are
[39:13] going to be brought in,
[39:15] &gt;&gt; going to be brought in, brought back,
[39:17] restored, the restoration of all things.
[39:22] Now, there's a lot of great truths we
[39:25] can derive from this, but I wanted to
[39:28] use these highlevel things to you. maybe
[39:31] things you already know, very important
[39:34] things
[39:35] to see that the prelude in these
[39:38] instances is not just symbolically
[39:40] powerful, but supernaturally necessary.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; It's it's not just a trope or just a
[39:47] trick or just something God kind of
[39:49] looks and says, I'll just use this to
[39:50] grease the skids a little bit. Don't
[39:52] really mean to use it. Anybody familiar
[39:54] with grease the skids as a as a cult?
[39:57] You know, I have clients that have no
[39:59] idea when I say that. They want me, they
[40:01] bog me down. They start asking, "What do
[40:02] you mean grease the skids? Are we doing
[40:04] something wrong?" And I'm a little
[40:06] nonlusted when that happens. But there
[40:08] is this idea that God, you think, "Oh,
[40:10] well, God, it just kind of helps. It's
[40:12] just a helper. It's there if you need
[40:13] it." Kind of like uh cliffnotes. You if
[40:16] you can read the book and learn it and
[40:17] study it, but if you need to, you can
[40:18] get all these supplemental materials.
[40:19] know God it it's not just something that
[40:23] is symbolically powerful and you could
[40:24] use if you want as a tool or an aid to
[40:26] understand something that comes
[40:28] afterwards but God demands it and deems
[40:30] it necessary
[40:33] &gt;&gt; as critical when God wrote his Bible
[40:36] when he formed this great composition
[40:37] which we believe this word is a
[40:40] composition it is a work that God used
[40:42] he's used this element of the prelude as
[40:45] a necessary element
[40:48] &gt;&gt; and he said if you can receive it. This
[40:50] is the Elias that was to come. So there
[40:54] is a promise of another Elijah that we
[40:56] believe with we've received according to
[40:57] Malachi 4 and according to other
[40:59] prophecies. And once again, it's not
[41:02] that it's so plain and so digestible and
[41:05] so clearly laid out. It's if you can
[41:09] receive it.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Really, there's a lot of grace in that.
[41:12] You don't have to get all worked up. If
[41:14] you can receive it, this is the Elijah.
[41:16] If you can't, then don't.
[41:19] Jesus offers a lot of grace in that.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; We ought to have a lot of grace too in
[41:24] the revelation that God gives us and the
[41:26] the grace with which we carry these
[41:27] great truths that we have because I I
[41:30] firmly believe that it is the
[41:31] mischaracterization of the Bible by
[41:34] people who adamantly believe it that
[41:35] have been the stumbling biggest
[41:37] stumbling block to the Bible.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; The same could be said of Christians.
[41:41] Gandhi said, "I love your Christ. I just
[41:43] don't like your Christians.
[41:48] And I want to say that God is not done
[41:50] with the prelude.
[41:53] And you may be the most important
[41:55] prelude today.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; You can be God's prelude in many
[42:00] powerful ways.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; So you can be a prelude for good, a
[42:05] prelude for evil.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; We are the swer in the fields of our
[42:10] flesh, our families, and our fellowship.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have that power.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Job 4:8, even as I have seen, they that
[42:19] plow iniquity and sow wickedness reap
[42:21] the same. Here's the observation once
[42:23] again. Man is his own swer.
[42:27] This is the principle of the the prelude
[42:29] and the principle of the swer together
[42:30] that what you sow as the swer gives you
[42:33] an indication. It comes before what
[42:36] you're going to harvest.
[42:38] They're read in Galatians, be not
[42:39] deceived. God is not mocked. This is his
[42:41] immutable law of reproduction.
[42:42] whatsoever man seweth that shall he also
[42:44] reap. Then it tells us more precisely
[42:47] that you are a swer to your flesh.
[42:51] For he that sweth in his flesh shall
[42:52] reap of the flesh shall of the flesh
[42:54] reap corruption. That would be bad seed,
[42:57] corrupt seed,
[42:59] &gt;&gt; inordinate seeds, the wrong kind of
[43:02] influences, the wrong kind of diet,
[43:05] &gt;&gt; the that those dissonant things that
[43:07] that tear down that are evil. But he
[43:08] that sweth to the spirit, now there's
[43:10] that actual sewing to the spirit uh
[43:13] shall of the spirit reap life
[43:14] everlasting.
[43:16] And when the Bible says, "And let us not
[43:17] be weary and welloing."
[43:20] My son Jack gave me a a nice little
[43:22] bookmark from his Sunday school class
[43:23] that refers to this reading in
[43:25] Thessalonians Thessalonians. Let us not
[43:27] be weary and welloing for in due season
[43:29] we shall reap if we faint not. Reap
[43:32] what? Good.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; We ought to sow good. Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; You have this agency and power over your
[43:39] harvest.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Someone reached out to me recently and
[43:43] they said I I expressing just how
[43:45] depressed they were and how much anxiety
[43:46] they're feeling. And I just said I
[43:48] basically shared with them some
[43:49] principles. I said, you know, make sure
[43:51] you're getting enough sleep. Uh you
[43:53] know, watch what you're eating. Uh walk,
[43:55] get some exercise in and get your sleep
[43:57] in. And pay very close attention to the
[43:59] things you're feeding on. And I don't
[44:01] mean fried foods.
[44:03] Pay close attention to the things that
[44:05] you're digesting in your spirit, the
[44:07] things that you're sewing into your
[44:08] flesh. Because there's this immutable
[44:10] law that the more that you binge certain
[44:12] things,
[44:13] &gt;&gt; the more that you feed on certain genres
[44:15] of things, the more that you find
[44:17] yourself giving in to that part of the
[44:20] flesh, there is this reciprocal
[44:22] reciprocation of those things in the
[44:24] flesh.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know why I'm so worried and I'm
[44:28] always scared and I'm always afraid and
[44:31] I don't know, man. That's tough. That's
[44:33] tough. And all a sudden you get a
[44:34] notification. Oh, my favorite crime
[44:36] podcast just dropped a new episode.
[44:40] And you're over there kind of going,
[44:41] well, not much of a detective, are you?
[44:44] Right? There is their direct impact
[44:46] because you become the swer.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Or the gatekeeper of what is sown into
[44:50] your spirit.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; So you can determine what kind of
[44:54] harvest you have.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; And therefore, I want to read this to
[44:59] you. Mark 4:14. And this is kind of
[45:01] drawing from where we were in Matthew
[45:03] chapter 13. The swer sweeth the word.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; The swer Christ
[45:10] &gt;&gt; sews good seed.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Christ gives us the example of sewing
[45:15] the word.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; I'll say this. You're you're you're
[45:18] sewing a lot of seeds every day. We're
[45:20] sewing a lot of seeds. We can't help it.
[45:22] No matter what you say, what you do, in
[45:24] some ways there's some broadcasting of a
[45:26] seed. And so they're going to crop up in
[45:28] your life somewhere. and you're like,
[45:29] "Oh, where did that come from?" And you
[45:30] may be able to just kind of trace it
[45:32] back to the moment where you swed the
[45:33] seed of that.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; And so, if we can't help just by opening
[45:37] our mouths and getting out of bed and
[45:38] turning on our computers and flipping
[45:40] open our iPhones, I said, "Flip, I'm
[45:42] prophesying a flip iPhone. Write it down
[45:44] right now
[45:46] in the fly leaves of your notes, not
[45:48] your Bible." I'm not saying it is, but
[45:51] could it be? I never claimed to be a
[45:52] prophet,
[45:54] but there there is a moment from that
[45:57] moment on a lot of bad things are being
[45:58] swn in your spirit. So you better be in
[46:00] the habit of sewing good seed.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; You better recognize that you are a swer
[46:05] for good or for evil. We can take
[46:07] responsibility for the bad things that
[46:09] we've swn and the lack of diligence and
[46:11] oversight we've given to our flesh, our
[46:13] families, and our fellowship and
[46:14] realize, hey, that's on me. I haven't
[46:16] sewn enough good seeds. And you're not
[46:18] going to be able to do it by weed
[46:19] control. You're not going to be able to
[46:21] do it by just pulling weeds out. No,
[46:23] you've got to sew good seed.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; And the sewer seth the word.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; I think in our own family, I think
[46:34] you'll find just the things you've been
[46:35] studying on some of the questions we've
[46:37] been raising speak directly to this.
[46:39] Jesus in John 14:12 said, "Verily,
[46:42] verily, I say unto you, he that
[46:43] believeth on me, the works that I do
[46:45] shall he do also, and greater works than
[46:47] thee shall he do, because I go unto my
[46:49] father."
[46:51] &gt;&gt; One of the works that he did was he swed
[46:53] good seed.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; The swer sweeth the word.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; The swer Christ sowed the word. I cannot
[47:02] in good conscience claim to be doing the
[47:05] works of Christ if I'm not sowing the
[47:07] word.
[47:09] I can have many wonderful works. I can
[47:11] do many wonderful things. I said the
[47:13] works that he he did I can do also. And
[47:15] I I'm I'm healing the sick and I'm doing
[47:17] that all according to the word. But am I
[47:19] doing this critical work of sewing the
[47:21] word?
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham takes this scripture
[47:25] and the spoken word is the original
[47:26] seed. I think it would be a great sermon
[47:27] to listen to. Just takes a a little bit
[47:29] of time on your lunch break to do it.
[47:31] But he says, "See now why I have been so
[47:33] zealous of the kind of seed that I
[47:36] planted for the body.
[47:39] Why has he been so zealous? Why has he
[47:40] been so worried? Why has he harped on
[47:42] certain things? Why has he been so uh uh
[47:44] careful over it?
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Why has he avoided certain things with
[47:49] respect to politics? Why has he been so
[47:51] concerned when he said certain things?
[47:52] Why is why has he been the way that he
[47:54] has? Why is he preaching a six-hour
[47:55] sermon on spoken words, the original
[47:57] seed? I've been zealous of the kind of
[47:59] seed that I planted for the body. The
[48:01] rain is going to fall pretty soon, the
[48:03] real rain, and it's got to have seed to
[48:05] fall in. Amen.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon was zealous over the
[48:08] seed that was being sown. Christ, those
[48:11] the swer swed the word. Therefore, we
[48:14] ought to give the same kind of
[48:16] diligence. Every single one of us in
[48:18] this room from youngest to oldest, we've
[48:20] got to give same kind of diligence to
[48:22] the sewing of the right seed.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Because the rain's going to fall.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; It's going to produce things in your
[48:30] life.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; It's going to produce a harvest. And if
[48:33] the word's never been sown in your
[48:35] heart, there's going to come a rain one
[48:36] day. Watch the watch that water of that
[48:41] of that author's soul begin to nurture
[48:44] your spirit.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; And it produces a tear.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; And produces something. Why? Because the
[48:51] word hadn't been swed.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; You hadn't put yourself in a position
[48:55] for the rain to fall and quicken a seed
[48:58] that God had sown. Amen.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; I want to close with this story in
[49:04] Genesis. Just going to give a summary
[49:05] and then we'll come to the scriptures
[49:06] here in a moment.
[49:09] And my my one of my aims, this is really
[49:11] low on the uh the bucket list, but I was
[49:14] really wanting to preach under an hour
[49:15] today.
[49:17] I didn't do it last Wednesday, even
[49:19] though I think I bragged on it.
[49:21] I could always clip out about four
[49:22] minutes in the middle. No one would
[49:24] know. And uh put it right at 59 minutes.
[49:28] self-fulfilling prophecy.
[49:32] Joseph, in the subject of Joseph, I want
[49:34] you to think about this. He was born
[49:35] into a family of 12 sons. There's a lot
[49:37] in his life that you could just begin to
[49:38] consider. But I want to challenge you
[49:39] right now about being the swer
[49:44] and that you have power to preview, to
[49:48] forecast, and foreshadow what kind of
[49:50] harvest you're going to get.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; So, you have the power of the prelude.
[49:55] You have the power to establish the
[49:58] tone.
[50:00] You have the power in that moment to to
[50:03] signify, give these harmonic hints as to
[50:05] what your vision is.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; He suffered a lot. Joseph did on the
[50:11] account of his dreams and the the favor
[50:13] of his father. Betrayed by his brother,
[50:16] he sold into slavery.
[50:18] We understand that God's providence
[50:19] brought him from that pit all the way to
[50:21] prison and into a palace.
[50:24] And there in the palace he interprets a
[50:26] dream of Pharaoh. And interpreting that
[50:28] dream he saw seven years of abundance
[50:30] followed by seven years of famine.
[50:34] And he said that we ought to store a
[50:36] fifth of the harvest during the years of
[50:38] plenty that we might have a reserve for
[50:41] the time of the fa famine. So this time,
[50:44] and I want you to think about this as as
[50:46] as one that would sow to your flesh, to
[50:48] your family, and to your fellowship.
[50:50] That one who has some sort of providence
[50:52] over your life. And so we see that
[50:55] there's this time of plenty,
[50:58] but we have to realize that there's
[51:00] going to be times of famine. And in
[51:02] those times of famine, you want to have
[51:04] had a reserve in the time of plenty
[51:07] that'll get you through the lean times,
[51:09] the difficult times, the hard times, the
[51:11] famine, and that you've stored up,
[51:14] you've sowed, you've harvested, you've
[51:16] reaped, you've laid up for yourself
[51:17] these treasures.
[51:19] And so, Joseph said, "Let's store up a
[51:21] fifth of each harvest in the years of
[51:23] plenty so that when the time of famine
[51:25] comes, we have plenty of grain."
[51:28] And Pharaoh was so impressed with his
[51:30] insight and his vision that he made him
[51:32] second in command over all of Egypt.
[51:35] The Bible says this grain was gathered
[51:37] like the sand of the sea by the time the
[51:40] famine struck.
[51:42] So now we look at this and we see Joseph
[51:44] acting in obedience to the wisdom that
[51:47] God had given him. And it's going to
[51:48] cause Egypt
[51:50] to to last and to survive.
[51:54] But not just Egypt, but Israel.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Not just not just Pharaoh's house and
[52:01] his servants and and the people of his
[52:03] kingdom and all his slaves of his
[52:05] kingdom, but there's going to be more
[52:06] that happens because now when the
[52:08] children of Israel left from their
[52:10] promised land, their homeland, they came
[52:11] into Egypt because they heard there was
[52:13] grain. There was one who had this
[52:15] providential wisdom to store up during a
[52:18] time of plenty so that he could have a
[52:20] reserve in this time of leanness. People
[52:22] say, 'Well, these there's no such thing
[52:24] as grain. There's no such thing as this.
[52:25] There's no such thing as that. There's
[52:27] something that's been stored up.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; And he said, "This is the time where we
[52:30] we're feasting on what's already been
[52:32] sewn. This may not be a planting time.
[52:34] This may not even be a harvesting time.
[52:35] This is a feeding time."
[52:38] &gt;&gt; And others aren't able to uh uh to to
[52:41] produce it and make it happen and make
[52:42] it work. There was only one that had
[52:44] that grain.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; And Joseph is a type of Christ.
[52:49] Joseph orchestrated this whole narrative
[52:51] in this great story that the people of
[52:52] even even Egypt bought grain from the
[52:56] graineries and then they ran out of
[52:58] money and they came to a point where
[53:00] they finally just pledged their all.
[53:02] They said you have nothing but our
[53:03] bodies and our lands and to Pharaoh we
[53:05] give all. And what did it foreshadow?
[53:07] How Christ will orchestrate things in
[53:09] your life to where you finally come to
[53:10] the place where my money wasn't enough.
[53:13] My time wasn't enough. Playing church
[53:15] wasn't enough. pretending, pretending,
[53:16] pretending wasn't enough. All that's
[53:18] left for me to give is my heart. All
[53:20] that's left for you to give is give for
[53:22] me to give is all that I am. And so
[53:24] Christ is our Joseph, even orchestrating
[53:26] wants and lacks and famines so that you
[53:29] will just finally humble yourself and
[53:31] stare into the famine and the emptiness
[53:32] and say, "Oh God, I need you."
[53:39] &gt;&gt; And so when famine struck, Joseph's
[53:42] family comes down into Egypt. And here
[53:44] in chapter 45:es 1-7.
[53:48] Then Joseph could not refrain himself
[53:50] before all them that stood by him. And
[53:52] he cried,
[53:55] "Cause every man to go out for me." And
[53:57] there stood no man with him, while
[53:59] Joseph made himself known unto his
[54:02] brethren.
[54:04] And he wept aloud. And the Egyptians in
[54:05] the house of Pharaoh heard.
[54:08] And Joseph said unto his brethren,
[54:09] "Listen very closely to me. I am Joseph.
[54:13] And the first thing he wants to know is,
[54:15] does my father, is he alive? Does he yet
[54:17] live? And his brethren could not answer
[54:20] him, for they were troubled at his
[54:21] presence. Wouldn't you be? Right? This
[54:24] deep, dark secret that you had been
[54:26] hiding all these years, and you just
[54:27] thought, you know, I hope the coyotes
[54:29] never dig up the bones type thing that
[54:32] you're just hoping no one ever finds
[54:33] out. And all of a sudden, this one that
[54:34] you sold into slavery is like, uh, he's
[54:36] got receipts.
[54:38] Hey,
[54:40] uh we told dad that he was dead and he
[54:43] is right. Like at that moment, it's like
[54:46] this doesn't end well.
[54:48] But then Joseph says to his brethren,
[54:50] "Come near to me, I pray you." And
[54:52] there's there's more to the story and
[54:54] his ass asurances he gives them. But he
[54:57] says, "And they came near and he said, I
[54:59] am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold
[55:01] into Egypt.
[55:04] Now therefore, be not grieved nor angry
[55:06] with yourselves that you sold me hither.
[55:09] I hope I hope anyone here could just see
[55:11] the grace of God
[55:13] &gt;&gt; in this story. The grace of God in this
[55:16] because he says, "For God did send me
[55:19] before you to preserve life."
[55:23] &gt;&gt; They thought it was their jealousy.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; They thought it was his incessant what
[55:27] they perceived to be bragging. They
[55:28] thought it was their hatred for the
[55:30] favor that their father had given them.
[55:31] They thought it was his arrogance and
[55:32] all those things that caused him to be
[55:34] thrown in the pit. But God had simply
[55:36] used those tools as a way to take Joseph
[55:39] from the pit to Piper's house to prison
[55:42] to Pharaoh
[55:44] &gt;&gt; so that he could give provision during a
[55:46] time of famine
[55:48] that would actually bring his brothers
[55:50] back. And in the moment where there's
[55:52] this great conflict, he covers his
[55:54] bases. Don't be grieved. Don't be mad at
[55:56] yourself because you sold me. You in
[55:58] fact did that. There's no way we can
[55:59] soft sell that. But God sent me before
[56:02] you for what? To preserve life.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; For these two years hath the famine been
[56:06] in the land, and yet there are five
[56:08] years, in the which there shall neither
[56:11] be earring nor harvest. And God sent me
[56:15] before you to preserve you a posterity
[56:19] in the earth, and to save your lives by
[56:22] a great deliverance. Isn't that
[56:24] beautiful? Pharaoh might have thought it
[56:26] was for him. He might have thought it
[56:28] was for his kingdom, for his people, for
[56:29] his house. Now he owns all of Egypt. God
[56:32] didn't want all of Egypt. God wanted to
[56:35] preserve the seed of Abraham.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; God had his eyes and his promise on
[56:40] them. And so, as a prelude to this
[56:43] preservation, he allows Joseph to suffer
[56:46] great rejection and hardship and pain.
[56:48] And I trust that all of us can see in
[56:50] our lives, there's a lot of things that
[56:51] we've suffered, a lot of things that
[56:53] we've gone through. But God has even
[56:55] done that to preserve life, not take it.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; And we ought to have the wisdom of
[57:00] Joseph to say, "I cannot sit idly by and
[57:03] pout upon the pile of all my brokenness
[57:05] and my scars and my diversions and all
[57:08] the ways that I went, but rise to this
[57:10] place of God's elect and chosen that he
[57:12] has sent you before your children and
[57:14] subsequent generations to what? To store
[57:17] up good seed."
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:21] The devil's trying to bully us from
[57:23] doing our job.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; And so I ask you as a challenge, maybe
[57:28] one that ought to be given to a group
[57:29] like this, what are you sowing?
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; What kind of emotional resonance
[57:36] are you hinting at in the prelude?
[57:41] What kind of DNA
[57:43] are you sewing?
[57:46] What kind of tone are you setting? I
[57:49] tell you, sometimes we should look at
[57:50] the path that our children go and say,
[57:53] "I wrote that tune for them before they
[57:56] played it."
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I told them this and I told
[58:00] them that. I encouraged this and I
[58:02] encouraged that. And when it came time
[58:04] for them to set out, they had they had
[58:07] nothing to go by.
[58:09] that had a foundation and this
[58:11] undergirling of the word
[58:14] &gt;&gt; of the playwright's composition, the
[58:18] composer.
[58:20] And this is what he wants for you. This
[58:22] is what he has for you.
[58:24] So I'm preaching this sermon even as a
[58:26] prelude to Lord willing what we might
[58:27] begin to minister on for the rest of the
[58:29] year or at least for some time in the
[58:32] coming services is what we ought to be
[58:35] doing and what we have a duty to do as
[58:39] believers
[58:40] so that there's not a famine for our
[58:42] children
[58:44] &gt;&gt; such that when they grow up to a certain
[58:46] age that they have no they have no
[58:48] reserve.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; They have no experience in the message
[58:51] or the Bible.
[58:53] No way to articulate what they've seen
[58:55] and what they've heard. No way to
[58:56] wrestle it out. No way even to pose the
[58:58] questions and be able to search things
[59:00] and find the heart of God and mind of
[59:01] God. They're never even in the practice
[59:03] of praying.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; They're not in the practice of looking
[59:06] through the scripture.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; They've only sat and just mustered
[59:11] enough energy to try not to fall asleep
[59:12] in our Sunday schools and our church
[59:14] services, even while doing all sorts of
[59:17] things.
[59:18] And the word is never swn into their
[59:21] hearts. Amen.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; And if it relates to our flesh and our
[59:26] families and our fellowship, I can take
[59:28] responsibility for what's sowed in our
[59:30] church to the extent that the right
[59:32] things aren't sowed, I can take
[59:33] responsibility for it. I'll take
[59:35] responsibility for my flesh. I'll take
[59:37] responsibility for my family. Could we
[59:39] all take responsibility as sers
[59:42] &gt;&gt; for your family?
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; And be more more diligent.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Be more diligent about what you sew. And
[59:49] and and I'll say this to some of us who
[59:51] have children that we want to see the
[59:52] word get a hold of. You swed good seed.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; God's made a promise.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; You've sewed keep sewing good seed. God
[1:00:00] made the promise.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; So you don't have to worry about the
[1:00:03] outcome.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; He told me to sew the word.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; He told me to sew the word. I've got to
[1:00:08] sew the word. I've got to sew the word.
[1:00:10] And don't panic about what's produced.
[1:00:12] Say, "Lord, I swed the word. I did my
[1:00:13] best about the tears. I did my best
[1:00:15] about the weeds. I did my best about all
[1:00:17] these other things and all these other
[1:00:18] ways and and we enjoyed these things and
[1:00:20] we did those things and maybe I did too
[1:00:22] much of this and I did too much of that.
[1:00:23] But Lord, I know I sowed the word. The
[1:00:26] rest is up to him because it's God both
[1:00:27] to do will and to do. And it's God that
[1:00:30] sws that waters and gives the increase.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; I want to be one of those that he uses.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; I challenge you tonight to be to think
[1:00:39] about the prelude and think of it this
[1:00:41] way. What am I doing now? And as I'm
[1:00:44] doing it, think of it as a prelude to
[1:00:46] what you can expect in the future.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; And therefore, make changes if you don't
[1:00:52] like the way it's looking.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Make changes
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; if you don't like the way it's looking.
[1:00:58] And God is so gracious that when we look
[1:01:00] at a field full of uh tears and weeds
[1:01:02] and our houses seem so discombobulated
[1:01:05] and upside down and no hope of
[1:01:06] redemption, that's when you call upon a
[1:01:07] God who's greater than that.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. who can come in and knows just how
[1:01:10] to dung it, just how to dig around it,
[1:01:13] and just a way to cultivate and pay
[1:01:14] attention once again to your vineyard
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; so it can bring forth much fruit.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together this evening as we
[1:01:21] pray.
[1:01:22] Musicians, come to your instruments,
[1:01:26] please.
[1:01:39] the prelude.
[1:01:42] [Music]
[1:01:44] I use those. I have a lot of reasons for
[1:01:47] doing this as God has led me to do it. I
[1:01:48] think some of them may be obvious
[1:01:51] um and and and on the nose,
[1:01:55] but I use these examples because I
[1:01:56] wanted you to recognize just how
[1:01:58] important that office is
[1:02:02] and that we are called to be sers and
[1:02:04] therefore as sers and husbandmen and co-
[1:02:07] lababorers with God, we have a
[1:02:09] responsibility
[1:02:11] and I think we ought to take it very
[1:02:12] seriously
[1:02:14] what this responsibility is.
[1:02:20] because we have power
[1:02:23] as the prelude. Let's bow our heads.
[1:02:26] Gracious heavenly father, tonight Lord,
[1:02:28] we could ask for a raise of hands, but I
[1:02:30] believe that hearts are just being
[1:02:32] lifted to you now.
[1:02:36] And Lord, as we have wrestled out these
[1:02:38] things and
[1:02:41] we can recognize these great truths in
[1:02:43] your word that we have benefited from
[1:02:48] children of Israel in the Exodus with
[1:02:50] the prelude of a prophet.
[1:02:53] Jesus Christ, the masterpiece, the son
[1:02:55] of God, the lamb of God to take away the
[1:02:57] sins of the world with the prelude of
[1:02:58] the prophet.
[1:03:00] And we see these great works that you
[1:03:01] have wrought by using these vessels and
[1:03:03] these angels and these ministries all as
[1:03:05] a prelude to great deliverance and
[1:03:07] healing and revelation.
[1:03:10] And we too Lord in this end time that we
[1:03:12] believe that there was a message and we
[1:03:14] believe with all of our hearts because
[1:03:16] we could receive it that there was an
[1:03:17] another Elijah anointing that came in
[1:03:19] this hour
[1:03:21] as a prelude to a rapture.
[1:03:26] Lord, if we could see these great
[1:03:28] principles in the scripture,
[1:03:31] then Lord, I I I wanted there to be such
[1:03:33] a heaviness to that dynamic that we
[1:03:35] could recognize that to whatever extent
[1:03:37] we play the same role, it's important.
[1:03:42] And that Lord, if I'm if I'm not sewing
[1:03:45] the word,
[1:03:48] how is it going to be sown?
[1:03:52] And Lord, if I think in in terms of
[1:03:55] well, we go to church and they hear
[1:03:57] their Sunday school teacher, they hear
[1:03:58] the youth group leader, they hear uh the
[1:04:00] pastor and the other associate
[1:04:02] ministries preach the word and the word
[1:04:04] is being sown in those services, then I
[1:04:07] if that's the extent to which it's being
[1:04:09] done, are we nurturing it?
[1:04:12] Are we watering it? Are we doing our
[1:04:15] part in the process?
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:19] Lord, I truly believe that many times we
[1:04:22] see the fruits of something and we can
[1:04:25] just follow the breadcrumbs. We can just
[1:04:27] follow the tracks and realize, wow,
[1:04:29] [Music]
[1:04:31] it had no root in itself.
[1:04:34] There was no foundation. There was no
[1:04:36] deepness of earth. Nothing had been
[1:04:38] spiritually cultivated. It was all
[1:04:39] shallow and external.
[1:04:42] Lord, there was a maybe a lot of works
[1:04:45] on the outside, but
[1:04:49] No care was given
[1:04:53] in the prelude of preparation for a
[1:04:56] birth.
[1:04:57] And Lord, to the extent that some of us
[1:04:59] have suffered as a result of this lack
[1:05:01] of preparation and even the labor of the
[1:05:03] prelude maybe not effective, the day is
[1:05:05] not over.
[1:05:07] Time is still upon us. And
[1:05:11] though there may be two years of famine
[1:05:13] and a few more yet, we believe there's
[1:05:15] provision.
[1:05:17] There's still provision.
[1:05:19] And may all of us who are here tonight
[1:05:21] not despair, neither be angry nor fret
[1:05:24] for what has been done, but just accept
[1:05:26] the provision now
[1:05:28] and be that part in this great
[1:05:30] masterpiece that you can use
[1:05:34] and become one that does the works of
[1:05:36] Christ to sew the word. Bless us
[1:05:42] tonight, I pray in the name of Lord
[1:05:43] Jesus Christ. Amen.
