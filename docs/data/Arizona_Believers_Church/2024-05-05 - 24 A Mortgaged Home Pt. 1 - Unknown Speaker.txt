TRANSCRIPT
========================================
wow just wonderful wonderful scripture reading uh this morning I trust that we can do it some service there's just back up a little bit to last Sunday just very quickly touch on our title and maybe U just maybe give the thesis statement we Ed the phrase and we were using quotations last Sunday I bu homes and the thought behind that is how Satan tricks us into giving up our homes and it's building on that concept what you're looking at now is Wednesday's title but Monday was I by homes a little bit more Sinister view of the devil approaching a door to buy a bu a home and how that the concept of a home is different than the house the physical structure and we're bringing that out of the message of the hour brother brandham says it's the character it's the order of the family that makes a home it's not just how the house and how beautiful it is but this here was what we ministered on Wednesday night gaining the world but losing your home and we are specifically looking at how that we can exchange change that concept of home the the rest and the peace and the Comfort the togetherness and the things that we can experience and enjoy in home we can exchange that for things of the world and how that Satan is transacting with us the world our own emotions however you want to use uh the adversary in this context or the protagonist but there's something an antagonist there's something happening where we're giving up things that God has promised us to given to us to enjoy we're kind of giving that up for things of the world and I want you to think in your minds about a transaction where we're exchanging value where there's consideration on both sides where you're being offered something and since you're you're gaining something this is an important concept to hold on to here in the beginning you're gaining something because you say how what would it profit if we gain the world but lose our soul so you're gaining something but think you cannot gain in this transaction without giving something else up so this is not something freely given when you transact in this economy I mean uh there's an exchange of value where you're receiving consideration you're giving consideration and we believe or I'm what I'm suggesting or at least wanting you to consider that transactions are happening on a daily basis they'd either build up your home or tear it down and the physical structure Remains the Same but yet there's something in the atmosphere and the spirit and the togetherness and the welcomeness of Christ that is lost we use the phrase peace by peace just to talk about uh maybe broking breaking out things but even rest and peace and comfort and joy we're exchanging that for other emotions and Sensations and experiences in the world and so if we're to possess our Promised Land step by step inch by inch foot by foot then I believe we can lose the Same by the way that we Retreat or the way that we exchange until uh the hole can be gone and I'll say this before we uh transition to this morning service there's things about home that are not for sale our home should not be for sale there's there's the home life is not not negotiable that when it comes to a job offer or an opportunity and things present themselves there should be a vision for home life that you say this is not on the table I'm not negotiate my quality time with my family I'm not going to negotiate um our our ability to serve the Lord and his people I'm not going to I'm not going to compromise home life in exchange for a better salary or better something else that that's something that is not negotiable and I'm not willing to trade it for anything there's going to be great transactions that can be offered say well here's $10 million if you go do this and go do that and you think man and it's only for a year after that year's over we'll have enough money to go back or do this and do that and your mind you rationalize and you convince yourself that you can handle it but yet you're giving something up in the process and what this what the statement Jesus is saying is you could gain the whole world and lose your soul and we're saying gaining the whole world and losing your home and he says what can a man give in exchange for his soul in other words there's things that you might barter that what you get if you give it up you don't get what you gave up back does that make sense is that riddled enough you give something up to get gain but you can't return the gain right and get back what you get got when you gave it to the getter you can't get it back it's going to require something else and I believe we can get it back through humility and submission to the Lord and asking for his forgiveness but recognize in that exchange whatever you give up for Val you to receive gain in this world you can't just quit the job or move back or do certain things to figure it out and get that back and and I that principle will'll come back to here in a little bit in terms of we're not so much wanting to deal with how to get that back but we're wanting to learn how to live a life to where we don't lose those things so my title today is a mortgaged home and everybody with the mortgage is like man rates these days I was just looking at you know I lost my car in an accident so thinking about trying to get a car just figuring out how much $300 can get me and uh and I was looking at interest rates on used cars I'm like what this is uh it's the mafia that's running the mortgage industry these days these prices should be illegal but uh when I use the phrase a mortgaged home I want to say we may not completely sell our home and again home refers to home life and we're not talking about literally selling a house or mortgaging your lit house but I'm wanting to use this concept to where we may not sell our homes that's not negotiable and since we've already addressed that kind of teed that up a little bit in some of our review of the last two services and that really is a review of a lot of other themes we've been using that maybe we don't sell it but what are the ways that we burden it what are the ways that we enter into some sort of negotiation where we just mortgage the home so it's burdened and it's weighed down and most of you are familiar with what a mortgage is we even will won't get into detail in terms of the law and the phrase uh the phrasing and the atmology of it necessarily but we understand it in modern terms that a mortgage is used to buy a house in this case we could say maybe a home or it's it would be used traditionally to buy a house uh and I want to build on that concept I I'm building on that knowledge that you I'm supposing you already have that whenever a mortgage is you're living in a house and you call it your own but you had to borrow money in order to possess it and to be able to have your name somewhere on the deed The Twist I want to use is when negotiating that mortgage or giving that mortgage and giving that security document what are you getting in the transaction what are the terms of that transaction and what does it mean for us as Believers now I want to uh I'm going have to cut in on where we were on Wednesday night uh and where we had to leave off but we're talking about what we make the world may call postmodern Society they're able to just to divide up where we are socially and things and politically but that leodan age and the attitude of leoda there's a lust brother BR showed us there's a Lust For worldly knowledge and once we have worldly knowledge it desires to experience that it's not just as much it's not about getting data but it's applying the data it's not just about knowing something but it's living it out and experiencing it and so the world is feeding us knowledge and the devil's preaching his sermon again and his eeden uh a knowledge of lust a lust knowledge a lust Veil and it brings us into experience and so so this Western Civilization this leot toan society that governs the entire world of those those social institutions of competition and Science and the rule of law and modern medicine and consumerism and work ethic these are all institutions that we engage in as human beings we participate in where there's some sort of transacting there's some sort of participation and it's all a part of Satan's economy in the end time in Luke chapter 17 Jesus called it planting and buying and selling and building and eating drinking and and and all these different details of just regular commonness regular daily lives things we do every day but those are the things that Jesus wanted to stand out when he talked about the day when the son of man is revealed and so if it's buying and selling planting and building eating and drinking and all those things that relate to the normal course of human events on a daily basis and he says but then at that same time the son of man is going to be revealed there ought to be that which has the preeminence in our lives and not the other Amen brother brandham says in Satan's Eden this is a great time everybody has money everybody can do this everybody can do that money is Flowing every way big cars and everything and then it really is just the uh uh the Leo de Sea and the rich and increase with goods and there's a lot of lot of things that we have even as we pointed out before even people who can be uh poverty or low income still have more today than what people had 100 years ago and so we have a lot and the uh and one of the things that we mentioned on Wednesday is how that home life has been perverted to such a large degree to where the things that used to be relate to home are watered down the things that used to bring a family together that a family fellowshipped around that a family had in common are devalued and have been overtaken by other things just the the the multiplicity of rooms and how it used to be a place you slept but now it's where you do school it's where you do your homework it's everything is done in that place the kitchen is not just a place for the family to gather around for meal time and prayer and devotions but it's used for homeschool it's used for work it's used for a lot of other things and a and every room in the house can be invaded by technology and media and movies and all sorts of things and so there's a little bit less sanctification of our dwellings uh uh our homes have been invaded by the internet and it has been uh thank you Al Gore and there's been a lot of things that have happened in our homes that have robbed us of time togetherness a and even a knowing of one another and this is a statement I came across some time ago that just uh and it was written I think by an English publication so it the the wording don't get lost in the what it what it says it says the web is another castle that the English man can live in so the web is another castle that the American the we the web is another house uh domain that a human can live in and he seeks to create virtual places that have as much effect on Pride self-esteem and identity as the bricks and mortar version where he sleeps so we have a world that we interact in and have Commerce in and we have things that we enjoy and participate in things that we are knowledgeable of things that we can have uh I mean there was a time when you learn things in print and it took some time to happen and yet they managed to get it out there for hundreds of years people knew things that were happening and you use some imagin and it was Consolidated to things that could be printed in Word of Mouth but now we could be witnessing in real time events that are happening in the Middle East and events that are happening all over North America and so we're drawn into this larger ecosystem and we're all hearing the same sound bites and we're all being told the same thing and sometimes uh groups are being told one thing and the other groups being told another and the chasm between us uh gets even larger but it points out that now there are things that we consider part of our reality in home or our existence a a virt a castle that is a virtual place that have just as much impact on our pride self-esteem and identity as the place we actually live and the people we actually are related to and interact with on a daily basis we are now the statement is we are now we read this Wednesday we are now in the process of negotiating new boundaries with our time our attentions and our domestic hierarchies and this is happening over and over and over again and I mentioned this so that it it kind of resonates with this concept of bringing our back our homes back under the token and and letting Christ have the preeminence in our daily lives is that we're TR we're negotiating new boundaries with technology with media with entertainment with games with all sorts of things with podcast and books you name it we're negotiating new boundaries with our time our attention and domestic relationships in order and so this is how home life is being impacted today home life meant something at one time now that it kind of expands to where it has these multiple dimensions and Realties and now you can just wear headsets and and augment your present reality with virtual things a and people will enjoy that more than the real thing virtual reality is not reality it's virtual it's it's it's augmented it's artificial and yet we interact in it and people will enjoy that more than the skin and bones and the actual tactile things that are real in the sermon a trumpet gives an uncertain sound brother bam says we find immorality on the Move in our homes he says in one place our markets are full of Filth and he's actually bringing it into the home and how our homes are full of Filth it was astounding to find out a great percent on the survey of the nation I believe it was in Ohio of course it amazing just how God I'm just kidding just I believe it was in Ohio well there's a lot of Ohioans here right raise your hand if you've lived in Ohio look at this look at this Glory we have a quorum let's conduct business it was a a survey in Ohio was taken of Christianity and it was alarming what a percent that did not even go to church now have some of you read and heard some of this uh the surveys how fewer people are identifying as Christian and how that it's really outstanding nowadays they're saying that the the number of people who identify with Christian the percentage that ident IFI Christianity that don't go to church is getting higher and higher and higher so Christianity in North America is becoming less and less and and then the percentage of those that actually go to church is becoming uh less and less so there's a now a kind of an Evangelical Christianity and more of a politicized Christianity where they they don't go to church anymore they they they're more interested in going to polling booths or Trump rallies and so there's a little bit there's a different church now for them there's a different Gathering Place and the brother brandham is bringing this out in 1963 how that there's a percentage of Christians that don't go to church he says about 80% of those that went to church didn't even know why they went now that's something there's 80% that go to church so if you you have Christians that go to church and of those that actually go to church he's saying there's only 20% who know why they're going now if you apply that today now that you have Christianity dwindling and the number of people that's going to church to I say there's even fewer today that know why they go to church they don't know why they go they just go to church why do you go well mother took us when she we was a kid and we just keep on going and I know in our minds we think denominations we think Baptist we think Methodist but do you realize this is so now in the message that when we've gone this many decades in the message and that we have fourth and fifth generation uh uh being raised in message churches that in the same way we can just be going to the church that Mom and Dad went to and their mom and dad went to and their mom and dad went to so this is just where we go to church and a lot of people will be born in a church be raised in a church never leave that church and never even ask themselves why am I in this church why why do we come here all the time and it doesn't it it it's not rhetorical in the sense that if you asked yourself that question you would leave but you would ask yourself that question to know why you stay to know why you're going he said now another percent of that said they just went just for o to meet their neighbors and talk a while he says why it's alarming and notice the connection he makes no wonder the home life is gone any home life that's not stable home life is gone there's an instability in home life because there's a lack of vision in those that are managing the home that are leading the home there's a lack of understanding of what spiritual things are for Christianity now has been reduced to going to church and this going to church doesn't have any meaning or real purpose and then even those who can answer the question say I'm just going for the social part and if you think that that only pertains to denominations it's an attitude in a spirit that still persists today where I'm sure that we can all especially the Neighbors in the apartment next door they just go to church for the Social Gospel they go to church for the social things not that the gospel's social but really at the end of the day what's keeping them is their social position and their social standing with other people who are listening to the same gospel that's being preached and it's not deeply impacting their souls and their lives brother brah says immorality is on the Move in our homes because of these things that are being let down and these things that being slipped and the vision and the uh and the awareness and wisdom in the home and he said home life is gone it's not stable then in the the uncertain sound he says' notice in this day the home life has become a situation that ought to be dealt with you see little boys going out and taking a rifle and shooting Papa and Mommy while they're laying in bed this these types of events are becoming more and more frequent more common and they're they're more pervasive uh there was uh I remember there was a time and I mean I want to mention even though it's been maybe like 20 over 20 years since this happened but there was a there was an uptick and a rash in school shootings uh that spun up at a particular time and at the time it was unprecedented the numbers that had taken place place and and I remember just in studying these are the things that just stood out to me this is just my own personal uh thing that stood out to me and and there was right at the same time that this started I think it was Sprite and I'm not preaching against clear sodas but they came out with a A slogan and a ad campaign called generation next and it was maybe early 2000s or something just and it coincided with the exact same thing and and at that time I came across a statement where brother bam said it used to be that young people would play a prank on You by putting your Carriage up in a tree or something like that they the pranks he says but now they'll just shoot you and he said that's the Next Generation and to me it just stood out to me here we are generation next has been announced we're in that season we're we're in that time we now uh uh you know the payback and revenge and pranks and those things it's just escalated to the point to where now uh murders are common school shootings are common a and those things are are just becoming so pervasive in a a present reality he says dishonesty amongst women and men our mothers and fathers so now we we want to think not so much where he goes in this where he begins to talk about infidelity and promiscuous relationships but just dishonesty and Parenthood uh parents to children and and our dishonesty and the way that we mislead them the hypocrisy that we broadcast to them when we say one thing and do another in lots of big cities the husband and wife pack secret keys or same keys pass keys to their apartment each one comes in eat a meal somewhere and one's got a date the other one's got a date now in our minds you think wow that that's uh we know what he's saying most of us understand what he's saying but how can we basically be doing the same thing H where we have a commitment we have hobbies we have things we do and it's just things are being fragmented and he says have no more uh have no more decency no specs at home homes in these days don't have the oldfashioned homes he says might too many doesn't have where the Bible is open dad reads a chapter and they kneel around the table and pray people go in sit down and eat just I saying people will go to the table and just start jamming or jaming and slopping around eating never ask the blessing he goes I don't mean to make this a joke I want to say it for a point I noticed one time it was out when we was living on the farm they was under they was under a hog under an apple tree and them apples was falling off and hitting them on the head and he eat apples all day long and he never did look up to see where they was coming from that's right well that don't only go on Hogs now if we're talking about daily living without ever uh without ever recognizing why you're doing it feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man Fellowship in where the son of man is being revealed if we have that kind of jun toos of two things buying selling planting building eating and drinking and these things and the revealing of the son of man there's a life that's being lived and you're never looking up to see Christ never asking yourself why do we go to church he says you don't realize where that food comes from you better look up and thank God for it because he was the one who gave it and so he says we don't have no more security of the home so we're talking about security rest a peaceful peace peble habitation a sure dwelling a quiet resting place because it's always uncertain it's always uneasy it's subject to the whims of of things that are viral it's subject to The Winds of Winds of entertainment and the whims of the world no more security he says send your children to school what do they teach them out there many times too many times they teach them that we come from apes and I guess at least then there was male and female ape right now I mean how many apes are there he says well we don't believe that no and if a man's no more than an animal or a man or a woman or or or or uh if they them are no more than an animal then eat drink and be married if that's all we are we're all existed on some Spectrum if it's whatever you want to make yourself to be and whatever you want to imagine yourself to be whatever reality whatever Castle you want to call your domain he said if that's it then just eat drink and be merry that's what makes so many juven delinquents what makes so many juvenile delinquents is when there's not a vision in the home right we always talk about television in the home you better be right you better be telling the vision you better be telling the things of God you better be telling about this revealing of the son of man there there better be things that are lifted up otherwise we have juvenile delinquents because they like I go to church why because my mom takes me would you go to church if your parents didn't take you no right and because and and that then that's when the heads begin to butt a little bit and an adolesence where it's like do I have to go do I have to go and then you say no one time and then it gets easier and easier to then you know Mom and Dad and the younger ones are going to church and the older ones are staying at home and it's just a matter of time they come every once in a while they come every once a while then eventually you don't ever see them again right and you know why it's not because they weren't seed on it's not because their parents weren't Believers it's let me just say this could it be that the parents never fully appreciated the gravity of the responsibility of training up a child in the way that he should go and when the heads begin to butt about going to church we didn't just say well there's a prophet in this hour who came and he said that we go to church and we go early and it's like well you're you're never there early well do as I say not as I do knucklehead right and then what do the kids think can I please just stay home tonight I got a lot of homework it's like I'll let you this time right and then the next time the bad the the meas instead of saying let let's talk more about this I'm not just going to church because um you know it's it's my favorite thing to do and and because I'm getting a bunch of worldly things out of it I go to church because there's a world that we're living in and I've had an experience that feeds my soul and there's a want to deep down inside my soul sometimes I'm tired sometimes I'm anxious some sometimes I've got a lot of work sometimes I don't necessarily feel on top of my game sometimes I feel like a hypocrite sometimes there's disagreement in the home and we've got to get together as a family and sit next to each other and drive 30 minutes to church or an hour we do it and Son the reason why we do it is because I've lived a life of sin I know what it is to be broken I know what it is to be hopeless and this is the place that has fulfilled every longing in my heart and begin to have honest talks with our children about what matters about why we go to church and why we've made the hard decisions we've made and you you never know if the son and or daughter in that instance might be like well you've never put it like that what are we waiting for I didn't I didn't I didn't know that cuz I've got friends at school who just go and I've got friends at school that got all sorts of programs and when the parents are in there listening to the Bible teaching they get to hang out at the coffee shop and there's all sorts of things so I I I I never knew listen I'm talking about how we've got to go beyond the surface of just looking like good message families and really getting into to the revealing of the son of man to know that we've got we we have juvenile delinquents because the the vision is delinquent right we're not telling them they're not an we're not telling them they're more than an animal you're more than a human you're more than just a some ordinary teenager passing through this world you you've got calling you've got purpose you've got gifts he said that's what makes so many crimes committed because if people are no more than an animal it makes them act like an animal I about to think somebody doesn't want me to preach today because I didn't find I couldn't see the water bottle we got to tell him he's a Son of God born for the kingdom of God and he is somebody Daddy I don't want to go to church I don't want to be a hypocrite child if you walk out that door and go into the world that's when you're the hypocrite in the family of God in the you're in Christ is the only place you're not a hypocrite because you're born for the kingdom of God Daddy I don't want to do that I want to go a different way I want to I want to do this I want to do that son I I can't at a certain point I can't fight you you're going to do what you want to do but I want you to know you're somebody you're somebody I can be proud of you're somebody that's got gold down inside of you you're somebody that's got gifts and talents you're somebody that has a call of God over your life and and we we have that Vision when we're dealing with those that we love that I'm not going to get Negative I'm not going to get costic I'm not going to get nasty but I want the love of Christ to be projected so it can be still yet a guiding force if that's the path that they want to take a protective Force I hope there's a picture that's being painted so you can understand where we're going with this change in our home life in Revelations 3:18 this is the anecdote to the leodan attitude I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire brother bam said that gold tried in the fire is the gold of God the gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of Affliction that's what we want we want Christlike character that's the gold of God and he says that thou mayest be rich in white rment that thou mayest be clothed brother Bram said there's a price to pay for those garments and it's the price of separation and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see this Leo Dean economy if we looked at it historically there's a lot of connections to the gold and to the clothing and to the isav and and there's a lot of historical connections that give this even maybe a little bit more context uh uh to understand why these words would be chosen directly to this church church age but when we think about Babylon and its Commerce and its economy and it's buying and selling and all those things it's remarkable that when we're rich and increase with Goods by our own self-estimation the spirit that exists on the age and Society at large whether you're believe in God or not it's the spirit on the age that he would then off offer some other economy or some other transaction I counsel thee to buy of me and he says gold clothing and isv this is this is his counsel brother B says the counsel of God is tur it is to the point he directs this last day Church to one hope that hope is himself amen he says come to me and by it is evident from this phrase by of me that the Le and church is not at all dealing with Jesus for the spiritual products of the kingdom of God their transactions cannot be spiritual now I want to use the the diagnosis he's having on the church age or the church nominal and their lukewarmness and their transactions in a religious nature and their Theology and their Church Ord and those things and how that he's saying that they're not dealing with Jesus for the spiritual products of the kingdom of God so they have their own religious Kingdom that they're buying and selling in and that they're supporting with their their belief in the doctrine and with their efforts and they're giving a and there's that realm where we've heard a voice of Revelations 18:4 say come out of her so we've left that economy so we've left the religious economy but now I want to apply this in some way to the more subtle economy of how that Satan is still attacking Our lives our our minds our bodies Our attention and our time where he's wanting us to interact not so much to support the Catholic church and the mark of the beast but just to busy ourselves with worldly things and how that there's can still be a lot of transactions that we're engaging in that that are separate and apart from Christ that do not benefit the kingdom of God being built in our own lives so he says their transactions cannot be spiritual so I I want you to begin to think even on an applicable way on a daily basis about spiritual transactions they may think that they are spiritual but how can they be the works in their midst are definitely not as Paul would say God in you willing and doing of his own good pleasure Philippians 21:13 thus what about all these churches schools hospitals missionary Ventures God is not in them as long as they are denominational seed and spirit and not the seed and spirit of God I'll just let that linger in case you need to take a picture there's no life in it and it it cannot bring forth it's a very important principle of the the word of God why why the things why things took place the way that they did is to to come back to Christ and out of these systems that have kept the people from Christ but the idea is that transactions that I'm want you to catch a hold of what brother Bram saying here I hope is evident Christ himself is the only hope and that Jesus has to be the one you're transacting with for the spiritual products of the kingdom of God so Christ has to be the one that you're negotiating not negotiating but you're transacting with he has to be the one that's giving he has to be the one that you're gaining from and you want to understand what you're what you're giving in that and what that entails and what things are freely given and what things we do to show a show of Love Back to him and so these Spirit the lack of spiritual transactions are result in the L de and condition or this L deing condition is evident in these the lack of spiritual transactions I would argue that this is how immortality excuse me immorality is on the Move in our homes and how home life has become a situation that must be dealt with 1 Timothy chap 6: 6 to10 I think this is where we'll we'll just be weaving in and out of this this for the remainder of our time today 1 Timothy chapter 6 we'll read verses 6 to1 and maybe work in some U some quot quotations in here and and I know I'm jumping into this but we'll back up to some of these other verses and jump forward to others but godliness with contentment is great gain remember this I want to revisit this before we're done godliness with contentment is great gain the world is going to offer you something in these transactions that are being dealt with these transactions that we're engaging in something's being offered to us so we're going to receive something consideration from the world and we're going to give up something in exchange for that and we might consider that gain great gain right large money and but this is saying godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and to certain we can carry nothing out now that's a a powerful statement we didn't come into this world with a lot of stuff and you're not going to be able to take your stuff with you right naked you came in essentially there's going to be a a nakedness that you're going to go you can't take something that was man-made something material back with you the only thing you take is your character and that's a character that Christ I believe I'm saying this for the believe that's a character that Christ has formed and what you leave is your legacy and having food and rment let us be therewith content now having something to eat and something to wear be happy and could you just imagine if we told our kids that we told everyone that told our wives that wives told the husband you know honey I could really use this it's like are you dressed are you fed right and so we could really could really have a lot of fun with this you know I really really want to do this well you got clothes on and your belly's full be happy and and it said in other words there's a certain basis of contentment there there's a certain measure of Necessities I he's not just saying food and clothing be happy saying but if the Necessities are met if the provision you need to fulfill your responsibilities and some have greater responsibilities than others uh some may live there's there's some Believers that live in economies in parts of country even in Europe where they don't need to own a car cuz they can take public transportation doesn't mean they're poor doesn't mean they can't handle it it's just they don't have to and and so there's some Believers that don't have to own certain things and engage in certain things and they their calling will never have them travel this way or go get a degree and a lot of those different uh things and so it's just a matter of being in your calling and appreciating the resources you need necessary to fulfill that calling in recognizing kind of what that is that if God's called someone to to do a particular line of work and that's something they can enjoy and that's something God can bless for them to uh to do good for their family it might require some equipment it might require some schooling it might require some training might require them to live in a particular area and and as long as God they have the provisions to meet that need the needs that come with that vision and that calling then that should be enough does that make sense that should be enough now so now this is where this Edge comes where Paul is saying in order for you to be what God wants you to be there's gain the godliness with contentment is great gain so what we want is godliness and happiness he said well how do I have that well we could get into what godliness is but then there's this contentment with that and he said now that's that's where you want to be so in me being Godlike and in me manifesting his calling in my life whatever that would look like I want to be satisfied in that calling and I want to have some understanding of what the limits are to that so that I'm not always lusting Beyond it right and that I can be much more efficient with what he gives me in that calling so that I can actually bless when it goes beyond right I can give that there's a giving that oh if this happens if I'm going Beyond this Beyond this base I don't need to hoard that or oh my goodness if I can just do this and and God calls you to be the CFO then that's that would be awesome and you're in your position you're in calling next thing you know a CEO opportunity open like I've been with this company forever and it's like this is an opportunity I've waited my whole life for this I'm going to become a CEO but it means I've got to move to New York City and you're like but man this is surely there's a church in New York City a place that big yeah there's got to be one you don't even think to look into it you don't even pray about it you just think this is a natural trajectory and you move into that with this idea that it's going to amplify all the blessings that were in your family when you're on this level and you move beyond the rainment and food you move beyond the godlikeness you move beyond the character you move beyond your calling and your position you move beyond what God wanted you to be into an area where he's like ooh bud there's a lot of diminishing returns once you go there better house better salary you know all better A lot of things but you know what you CH you're whatever you've traded in that exchange you're not going to get the same you're not getting the same return because you haven't made the same investment so Paul is really kicking the door open on something here and he said to be content Desiring no more than what one has Desiring no more than what one has but it speaks of a satisfied there's a peace of mind you're willing to accept what's yours i' like to I would like to present it this way fitting in how I'm trying to paint this picture that God has made promises to you and there's certain things that God wants you to possess and to have and we don't want to live below our Privileges and so if we find ourselves destitute we find ourselves in need and we find ourselves lacking the things that God has promised us then I believe that we should have this Pro this Faith to believe that God has promised provision to be able to provide and God has promised food and God has promised reignment and so it's not that we would just be I've made a lot of bad decisions and I'm a lot of bad debt and this has happened and that's happened and and I put my family in a hole and and and we're living on the street and I guess I just need to be happy a and somehow try to trick ourselves into thinking this is God's will for our life but if you know you're out of God's will then what you should long and desire is to be back in his will and to receive all the blessings that come with being in his will and so to be content is to be happy with what you have and what God has for you this peace of mind this satisfaction let me just do a little bit of a play on words we we are to be content so is it content or content what is it you're looking after what is it that governs godliness with contentment or worldliness with content on content with worldliness however you want to play on the words there content is just information right content is something contained it's items it's material and listen we now have this I want to present it this way God has promised you to be content a contentedness contentment and the world is promising you content the world is promising you stuff and materials and things a and it's a it's an economy it's a rat race and God's promising you to be content we should be seeking contentment not content is this not the age of content production and content consumption yes let me say that content creation you need the alliterations to to flow better content creation and content consumption all se's that's what we Liv right everyone wants to produce content create content content creators right so they can be influencers right this everyone there's a hustle economy where it's like you mean I can just Riff on recipes and kind of put it out there long enough to where the algorithm picks me up and as long as I keep doing this and I create content and people consume it that I can get cash right and in the process credibility and social Karma let's do this everyone try it and this is what I think a lot of our young people wrestle with is a Tik Tok YouTube Creator mindset where it's like we could be the new dude perfect we could be Bros awesome and and we can just all we got to do is trick shots and all we got to do is this and they like there's just going to be some easy segue into doing these things I can put together Legos and do videos of it and we're going to get rich because it's just the age content creation content consumption it's an age of content not content the insatiable appetite for goods insatiable craving for entertainment to be entertained that's why we've gone from we we now have the things that are the most uh addicting are the things that have short Cycles to them things that are most consumable the things that are the most uh uh that you repeat coming back to and you do the Doom scroll with or the things that can just be small bites over and over and over and over and over again there's a craving for pleasure because I eat money uh this avarice that's that's uh it's part of the whole picture and I believe that there is as Paul is saying that having food and reignment let us therewith be content because godliness with contentment is great gain you came into the world with nothing you're going to leave with nothing he's wanting to get us to think on a much more important relevant scale about our lives because there is a pull and a temptation to live to consume to live and consume and acquire beyond what is necessary the I think the the uh the only thing we need to prove that is our cell phones that's it we don't we don't need to dig into anything else like how new the cars are in the parking lot brother BR say they're trading them in all the time and uh some people have owned more cars in their life time than toothbrushes as a matter of fact it is a Bonafide statistic that more people own cell phones than people do toothbrushes and so there are and there's more cell phones than toothbrushes and some of you are really helping them prop up those numbers by not having a toothbrush and multiple cell phones but that's the day and age we live in where we have we're not satisfied and I know there's planned OB opalescence where there's things we buy and it's obsolete because they plan it that way update your phone and immediately it's a brick because they want you to go in and trade it in so I realize there's the the illuminatis behind all of this orchestrating things making these things happen thanks Bill Gates Right trying to get us vaccinated to kill us off and so we we could just cater to that crowd and a lot of people just like are either a lot of people just unsubscribed or maybe a lot of people finally subscribed mash it hit it turn on notifications if you want more of this but there's we take our phones and we trade them in every year no matter what why there's a pool there's a pool to have acquire and consume beyond what is necessary now if your work's going to pay for it if it's necessary to fulfill your vision and your goal then upgrade Cycles are just a fact of life why did it just get quiet all of a sudden I didn't say anything about Starbucks or Dutch Bros I didn't say anything about your rituals I'm just talking about which side are you on Android or iPhone I didn't even bring up names who's still on a Blackberry who's on the Windows phone you're living by what's necessary everyone else is caught up in the rat race a pool to consume beyond what we need I use the example of a cell phone just so you can understand the point I'm trying to make that there's a threshold of what is necessary and then there's this uh pushing beyond that I think we could be prudent with our finances and our purchasing power and the things we buy to where we we buy things that last so it's not just that you're spending oh I can't believe you spent that much money on a pair of shoes well it's going to last 10 times as long as those right so there's some things we put thought into we sacrifice we budget we buy we acquire not because it's it's a status thing but we buy it for life we want to have good things we want things to last it meets a purpose it fulfills a goal if you're a family I don't know why I'm getting into all this stuff but if you're a family that likes to hike and likes to tent and you do it a lot stop buying the cheap tents save and buy a good tent that can last your lifetime same thing for hiking and and and so it's not wrong to have good things and things that last and things that stand up if it meets your family goal and your vision and things that you do that are fulfilling is it making sense and so there's to me there's just a wisdom that the scripture gives us there a wisdom that's coming from the word of God to kind of check us when we're in the flow in the momentum of the world in not in God's path for our lives says this having food and rment let us therewith be content why but they that will be rich fall into temptation and to snare this will be rich it's a craving a longing or pursuing wealth they that will be rich they will to be rich they want to be rich it's a craving a longing to pursue wealth and riches they fall into temptation and a snare it's not even saying some it's saying those who have gain in mind alone they fall into temptation and a snare they fall into the Trap and into many foolish and hurtful lusts read this in a very literal sense that they that are inordinately uh pursuing wealth and status and politics and popularity inordinately creating content or consuming it however you want to look at it they will fall into temptation they will fall into a trap and by those Temptations and those traps many foolish and hurtful lust will be incurred by themselves and their family and it drowns men in destruction and predition this is quite a statement in light of what he's talking about godliness with contentment versus uh wanting more than just what is necessary for the love of money is the root of all evil it's not just money that's the root of all evil but it's the love of it which while some coveted after they covet it after the gain they covered after the riches they cover it after the the the the things they could get the things the stuff the content while they when they coveted it after it as they pursued hard after it they've aired from the faith and Pierce themselves through with many sorrows in our minds we might think oh so that's what happens when someone leaves the message is they get consumed with the Love of Money perhaps for some but it doesn't necessarily say they they they now subscribe to something that's anti- word he's just saying they've aired from the faith they're no longer dealing with Jesus for the to build the kingdom of God for the spiritual production of the Kingdom they've aired from the faith and in airing from the faith it pierces themselves through with many Sorrows those that have the wrong Vision the wrong goal and the wrong Pursuits sign themselves up for hurtful lust foolish lust that drown Us in destruction and that will cause us to air from the faith piercing us through with many Sorrows greed is what causes us to enter into temptation and get trapped the love of money is the root of all evil and just think of the things that spring forth from this roote the love of money is the root of all evil the love of money they well does that mean the almighty dollar does it mean the yin does it mean the Lira what which which what are we talking about Moola cash gidus scratch what is it is it cash app vinmo zel the love of money money now is a phrase that has something to do do with the ability it's power purchasing power something tradable something you can use right there's anything that can be used in the economy to start with a paperclip and end up with a house right anything can be Bartered for in exchange anything that has value even to somebody else that you can give up in exchange as something else the Love of Money speaks of an economy buying selling planting building creating consuming brother brandham says each age had its pressures saying this in thyra for example a great burden of the last age this is Leo DEA is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions it's one burden we cannot Escape it riches soft living and nervous tensions one burden one pressure we're all facing it riches soft living nervous tensions we're all subject to it we all sometimes succumb to it it's why anxiety is on the rise and nerve nervous disorders are on the rise that's why so many uh mental health issues are now more in people's vernacular and they're talking about it and they're and it's more in our conscience than it's ever been before you could probably ask uh uh um some of the oldtimers here like brother Andrew or different ones like did you you guys talk about mental health issues back in your day brother Dale was mental health always an issue all right it wasn't something so sister Darlene yeah it wasn't something was always talked about well you just need so you just need some counseling maybe it's just mental health you just chemistry imbalance it wasn't something we talked about people didn't talk about you know where they talked about it their Diaries that's where they got it out I had a very blue day today feeling very weary not sure why it just seems like a darkness is following me and those words are never spoken from the lips and Housewives and mothers and all sorts of people lived with crippling anxiety and fear and depression and all sorts of mental health issues and now it's more rampant and now it's becoming more talked about why nervous tensions soft living riches what a crazy concoction he says in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in it's a complex age the pressure which is riches soft living and nervous tensions that we're not fit for so here we are we're not fit for a complex age in these pressures coming down on us the spirit on the age produces a mindset a reaction a kind of a rhythm and influence it influences our perception we think a certain way we perceive things a certain way social norms impact our behaviors the things that are readily accepted and broadly accepted in in the world and in society they impact our behaviors it influences our lifestyles it influences our habits things go viral right and and we do we we we participate in the economy when things go viral we act out certain ways we do certain things this is the snare the snare of Satan's Eden is the vanity of these things The Emptiness of these things it's the spirit of the age to acquire to consume to build up to to store up to have to have and to have brother Bram says in the Le deed Church age now these people had plenty of gold but it was the wrong kind hopefully I'm being able to turn the corner a little bit here uh uh so you could see you can see what's being emphasized they had gold but it was the wrong kind it was the gold that brought men's lives bought men's lives and destroyed them it was the gold that warped and twisted human character for its love was the root of all evil the wrong kind of gold the wrong kind of Commerce the wrong kind of gain twist our character the wrong kind of transactions twist our character the wrong kind of bartering the wrong kind of exchange they had plenty of gain plenty of gold plenty of money but it was the wrong kind it was it the kind that Godlike Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of Affliction where there's something you're giving but there's something you're getting in return a Christlike character there's plenty of gold there's plenty of cars there's plenty of things there's plenty of stuff talk about stuff I've been recently revisiting a study I had done several years ago go just trying to update the stats and statistics on how many things we have there's more storage units in the United States of America than there are Starbucks and McDonald's combined is that all did I need to open with that to get your attention I'm going to start leading with something like that like you know kind of like the cut in a video where they they get you right up to the door oh I'm in and then they put it at minute 37 right there's so much stuff it's the wrong kind of stuff I'll say this it's not wrong to have stuff but in the absence of the right stuff that's the wrong stuff if you don't have enough of the right stuff all your stuff is the wrong stuff amen this is the stuff we're talking about and I'm not wanting to stuff it down your throats I want you to eat this stuff it's good stuff he says the city of Leia was a wealthy City brother B I'm bringing this out and he's teaching on this it minted gold coins with inscriptions on both sides gold coins characterized the age a flourishing Commerce existed because of it today the two-headed gold coin is with us we buy ourselves out we buy ourselves in we sell out to buy end to this economy a flourishing Commerce existed then Leo de was a wealthy City with their minted gold coins INRI inscriptions on both sides it characterized that age God wanted that characterization that City it's flourishing Commerce it's gold and it's it's Sterling and all those things he wanted it to stand out just as Jesus wanted the planting a and and selling the buying and building and all those things he wanted those things to stand out in the day when the son of man has been revealed today the same flourishing Commerce is with us where we're buying ourselves out and we're buying ourselves in I've run out of time today so I I am just going to go a little bit further and we'll pick up the rest of this we'll have to finish 1 Timothy maybe at another time you won't even well it just depends on how hard you pull on me but I will say this that it may be that I haven't even gotten to what I mean by a mortgage home but in Proverbs 15: 27 it says he that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house but he that hate hateth gifts shall live I love it when the scripture we point this out quite often that you know on its face this is a perfect scripture to get rid of Christmas and birthday celebrations Valentine's Day Mother's Day right are you going to get your Mom a Mother's Day gift well I mean if if she wants to live she should hate those things let's just be scripturally correct I mean do you really want a gift and so we just kind of use that like well the Bible says but that's not what it's saying unfortunately I say that as a family that has Christmas and like four birthdays all within four weeks yes just Eliza and I decided to move out further into the year he that is greedy of gained troubleth his own house but he that hateth gift shall live it speaks of being overly eager to be rich or to have stuff and inordinate affection for things comes back to what Timothy is saying food and rment be happy with it be content for what's necessary to fulfill your vision and your family be content for what is necessary to be the Christian that God's called you to be don't be greedy for gain it's an extreme desire for wealth for material gain I want great gain and Paul's saying godliness with contentment that's great gain but the world says well you can have that but you can also have this too you can have godliness and be happy and all this too greed the Bible is tell us brings ruin and destruction upon a house he that is greedy of gain troubles his house a house does not become a home when gain becomes its emphasis when we are looking to gain and that's the sole purpose why that we have a house over our heads so that we can have a place to sleep so we can have energy to hustle the next day that's not what it is to be greedy of gain troubles the house greedy Being Greedy of gain is what causes a house to not be a home but he that hateth gifts shall live gifts here speak of bribes those things that are given to pervert judgment so he that is greedy of gain troubles his house and in the same notion says he that hates gifts will live he will flourish the trouble will be far from him in other words as a husband and as a wife as a leader in a home I'd say even as a young man and individuals in your own single lives that you are given a a currency and a domain things to look after I would say this that God can provide you all the time and money you need to be what he wants you to be in this life it's just a matter of how you manage the two and so in that there's this uh Being Greedy of gain that's going to bring trouble to your life and he that hateth gifts is going to keep the trouble far from him the gifts are things that are given or things that are offered that'll pervert your daily judgment in other words greed makes us vulnerable to enticements Greed makes us vulnerable to the bait and switch greed is what makes us vulnerable to uh pyramid schemes and Ponzi schemes greed is what makes us vulnerable to really really bad Investments greed is what makes us vulnerable to making to not seeing things for the way that it is the opportunity presents itself and I'm not just talking about somebody who says give me 10 grand and I'll give you 100 Grand next week and we're like oh my goodness this doesn't come by this opportunity does not come by very often right I'm talking about just in your daily transactions and interacting where you are not dealing with Jesus for the spiritual products of the kingdom of God where your transactions are not spiritual where there's a gift there's an offer that's being offered here take this and it it seems free right but there's a price there's an exchange because it's a gift and that you're getting something but they want something in return because it's a bribe and when we have the wrong kind of character the wrong kind of mindset it makes us vulnerable to these enticements that trouble our house so Proverbs 1:10 to19 says my son if Sinners entice thee consent thou not that consent to consent not the the the sin is in the yielding to the enticement not in being enticed the sin is yielding to the Temptation not in being tempted so he says if Sinners entice thee you must be on bad ground you must be a bad person no if Sinners entice they don't consent because the sin is in the consenting if they say come with us let us lie we for blood scripturally even in the Jews that this Blood didn't mean the physical life necessarily but it meant money it meant gain let us lur privily for the innocent without cause let us swallow them up alive as the graves and whole as those that go down into the pit in other words let's take advantage let's get what we can let's let's let's scheme we shall find all precious substance notice where it's all going we shall fill our houses with spoil let's talk about a mindset and an attitude where it's get yours look out after yourself this is business I was doing business with a brother one time a number of years ago a a and and I was doing things for him and there was a lot that wasen a lot of value was being created a lot of real work was being done and and I got paid a little bit here and paid a little bit there in the meantime says don't worry business is going so well we'll just catch up later and so we just kept working and working over a couple year period I was eventually owed like two $250,000 and when I asked him brother was worth millions when I asked him could I get paid on this he goes do you have a contract I was like no I I was like you know how we've done this from the very beginning I did work you paid me we did some peacemeal stuff I delayed invoices for the purpose of the deal and he goes yeah too bad this is a brother in church right this is a brother and he's like yeah you know you should have known better as a lawyer It's Kind like silly me are you going to be at communion Sunday I'll wash your feet right it was almost like the attitude was you should have known better but listen there was somebody who didn't see the bigger picture and you know what maybe I didn't either maybe I didn't slow down enough and use some wisdom like maybe the money's a little bit maybe the bills are just too easy to to send out maybe I'm racking up too much maybe I'm doing too much work and not getting paid enough to wear I in myself being greedy for the money that could be made never slowed down enough to say is this wise to do this is it even healthy for our the dynamic and the relationship as brothers to do this and the answer is no it's not so yeah maybe I make it sound like it's his fault but at the end of the day I had my self to blame because the whole gain the whole idea is to fill our houses with all the things we acquire our house can be well fitted he says cast in thy lot Among Us let us all have one purse so he says my son walk not thou in the way with them refrain thy foot from their path for their feet run to evil and make haste to shed blood surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird now this bird idea kind of maybe a little bit of a play on it but we'll just keep going the net is spread in the sight of any bird spread in vain when it can see it when it knows and they lay weight for their own blood they lurk privil for their own lives now they're lurking for blood they want to consume they want to fill their house with spoils but whose lives are at stake so are the ways of everyone that is greedy of gain he that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house they that will be rich they that are greedy for gain fall into temptation and a snare and into foolish traps and hurtful lust that drowns them in destruction and predition they when they covet after this money this gain they air from the faith they're pierced through with many with many Sorrows Paul is using a poetic language to draw from these very things of the Proverbs and the Old Testament the ways of one that is greedy with gain everyone that is greedy of gain which taketh away the life of the owners thereof whether it be the life lives of the one they take it from are their very own because greed is tantamount to murder because you'll either murder somebody else to get it but in the process you murder yourself you murder your family I'm going to end this was going to be in the middle but I'm going to end with Homer's Odyssey not Homer Simpson Homer's Odyssey brother John just go ahead and show the picture odys is sailing home through the Straits of Messina after the Trojan War and as he's sailing home he has to pass through these Straits and these islands that are near proximity to those that would pass through in this mythology Homer is writing this mythology and this is the first mention of these I'm I'm going to I'm going to use the phrase siren song so this is where I'm coming from anybody ever heard the phrase a siren song yes so these Sirens lived on these islands waiting for passing ships to come by and they would Allure the sailors with the Beautiful music and so in the Odyssey the sirens tried to tempt odyss and his crew to come on land in order to kill them and so here's you have those now this is a beautiful way to think about this when we're talking about those that are greedy for gain and he says and it said when Sinners entice thee consent thou not right like they're saying hey let's do this let's get and let's gain and it's in contrast to the mindset with having food and reignment be content godliness with great gain uh godl contentment is great gain like that that's the mindset that's the character we're trying to lift up then there's this whole other side to it now you realize when you're transacting you're you're greedy for gain let's just say I I realize it I was the one when I was doing those deals and get my invoice kept getting higher and higher and higher and higher and I kept thinking man I'm going to get paid I was greedy for gain but the thing that I didn't realize is the person I was dealing with they're greedy for gain too right and so you're in that economy that if you want to do business with them you either need to kill them or they're going to kill you and the brother Aaron tweet out of cond context is is kill them before they kill you brother Mitch has come up with a uh a twe uh a Twitter account that takes my statements out of context he says this would go viral could we monetize it there is it it's in that whole realm in this economy and so what would happen in this uh as these ship men would pass through and the crew would hear these songs it entices them it allur them these beautiful women and they're singing no there's something drawing on their flesh and they might think oh wow this is going to satisfy this is going to please but the one singing had something to gain in it too and it was to murder those men there's a lot of Mythology behind it as to whether or not though they had they were singing for pany or as my wife would say it persone and uh that was the name of the store and we used always thought was persone until we learned Greek mythology pipany they that there was that they these Sirens now in some sort of banishment some sort of mode in these on these islands they wanted to kill and so odsis was warned ahead of time and this is the warning the sirens bewitch everybody who approaches them there's no homecoming for the man who draws near them unawares so it's talking about unawareness there's no homecoming there's no home there's no home life there's no vision if we try to make our way through this world unaware of the sirens for with their High clear song the sirens bewitch him as they sit there in the the meadow piled high with the moldering skeletons of men whose withered skin still hangs on their bones what a picture that's painted using the the the gift of words and literature to paint the picture of men's flesh whose lies has been taken still moldering there in the Meadows of these islands who have been Bewitched by the siren song and tricked into coming ashore tricked into coming on land with what do entic them only to lose Lo their lives and so one British lawyer and actually a a literary figure in England he he he summarized it this way their song though irresistibly sweet was no less sad than sweet en lapped both body and soul in a fatal lethargy the Forerunner of death and Corruption this is what's happened in the day we live in today we're passing through Straits and there's sirens on every side singing to us calling to us trying to tempt us and if we approach them unawares it's necessary to approach to get home it's necessary to live it's necessary to work it's necessary to go to school it's necessary to interact it's of necessity we can't all just sell everything we have and move into the middle of nowhere in Wyoming we can't all do that we could try maybe but it's just not going to work right of necessity we have to be doing what we're doing and I'm glad that you are because you know what I believe that there's going to be testimonies of people who arrive in this congregation who are going to say but for you who went to work but for you who went to school but for you who went to the grocery store every day I would have never known Christ I would have never come to this gospel I would have never known freedom I would have never known healing I would have never known Deliverance so it's of necessity we have to we have to pass through but let us not pass through unawares there is no homecoming if we don't go this way but there is no homecoming if we approach unaware you want to just bury yourself and avoid it you'll never make it to Heaven you'll never make it in the rapture we got to live our ways into that but if we're going to live we've got to be aware of the siren song irresistibly sweet but it laps mind and body into a lethargy laziness a stuper which is the Forerunner of death and Corruption the siren song is an enticement that's hard to resist even though it leads to harm in other words a lot of you know right now what the siren songs are in your life and the reason why you know it's a siren song is because what it does to you when you've listened to it what it's produced and what it's brought and so you know it's irresistible despite the destruction it brings and the world this this Eden this place that we live is constantly singing a siren song many urements whether it be through lust or even the desire to be rich to have possessions or experience things he that is greedy of gain troubles his own house in Proverbs 11: 28-29 Brothers if you could come to your instruments I'm going to wrap this up Proverbs 11: 28-29 he that trusteth in riches shall fall but the right shall flourish as a branch he that trusteth in riches shall fall but the righteous shall flourish as a branch he that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart the Bible says the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender this is what a mortgaged home is where we are no longer dealing with Christ for the spiritual products of the kingdom of God our transactions are no longer spiritual and because we've continued to transact there's constantly been a buying out and a buying in a selling and a gaining but there's also been a price that's been paid and even if you've been able to accumulate a lot of stuff if you trust in riches you're going to fail if you trust in it for happiness if you trust in it for the portion if you trust in it for possession you're going to fall but the righteous shall flourish I I had a whole I had I have enough to continue to preach for another hour and 20 minutes so if you'll just give me a second to find where we could land where I want to just sum this up a mortgaged home it's not about borrowing money to buy a house but it's about burdening the home because we lack wisdom it's about burdening the home because we lack wisdom maybe I'll tie these things in together Wednesday night but spiritual transactions I I'll emphasize I had several scriptures to use but spiritual transactions do not mortgage your home they set it free spiritual transactions is what we're after if I could say this I I'll repeat it Wednesday [Music] night I'm not advocating for strong robust tools to help us in the moment of temptation but John if you want to put the uh that picture back [Music] up there's certain measures of restraint that are being taken care of here [Music] odyusa in their ears they did everything they could now to try not to hear the siren song and these are measures of restraint in the moment as they approach they're aware but I'm not advocating for tying ourselves to the Mast I'm not advocating for us to stick wax in our ears that would only impair our true Duty and purpose that that's a that's a in the- moment measure to try to exercise some sort of self-restraint what I believe the scriptures teaching us is yes in the moments of Temptation there may be things we could do to plug our ears to put wax on our ears to tie ourself to a MK and there may be some measurement of resistance that we need to do in the moment of temptation but I'm act I actually believe there's a wisdom that can come from God where we don't need to have strong robust resistance mechanisms in the time of temptation but we have a wisdom that leads us far from it right yes there could be a wisdom that tells us you don't have to go through the streets of Messina there's a way to get there might be a little bit harder a little bit longer but I'll get you there you'll get home but you don't have to go by and tempt yourself to the siren song and yet I believe there's a wisdom of God that we could have in our hearts and an experience that we can lift up in our home to if that's the way that we have to go I don't need to tie myself to a mass I don't need to shove a bunch of wax in my children's ears they can have the wooing of the sirens they can have the singing of the world and they stay steady right on it's a manner of living that keeps us from being distracted from our purpose odsis and even orus orus and and Jason and the Argonauts I think he wanted to play as liar he wanted to play louder than the sirens that's wonderful if that's what we need to do in the moment but how about having the kind of character that can just let the world sing its song and I don't need to use unnecessary measures what I want to leave you with is let's have spiritual transactions the Bible says in Proverbs 23:23 buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom instruction and understanding remember what builds a house it's that last scripture brother John what you you you remember what establishes it you remember what fills it buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction and understand standing godliness should be valued godliness in a home godlikeness should be valued and treasured and pursued Christ is the most important thing God gives us this remedy for the L deing condition he gives us a remedy for the siren song he gives us something to consider and to think about when the sirens are singing and the sirens are wooing us and the sirens are calling us we're like wow this is irresistible this is attraction I I I I want to give into it and yeah I know maybe there's a price and maybe it won't work out good but I've got to try it I got to figure it out there's a there's an answer he says come to me the remedy for the L toan condition the remedy for the siren songs is gold Raymond and isab to see come to me and receive gold and clothing and wisdom Christlike character true Holiness and spiritual Revelation is what these things represent and they're worth every effort these are the things that ought to have place in our homes this be this should be the right stuff Christlike character true Holiness spirit Revelation those should be the we're dealing with Jesus for the spiritual products of the kingdom of God in these spiritual transactions they Investments not detriments these are real Investments our transactions are not all spiritual right let's not try to spiritualize getting gas tomorrow morning and getting the energy drink and the muffin on our way out of Quick Trip let's not spiritualize that but those are TR transactions on a daily basis and interactions on a daily basis and the reason why some of us succumb to the siren song is there's not enough other spiritual transactions to keep us centered and so even in what should be a home and a Haven and a safe place chaos and lust Temptation and strife and all sorts of things that Paul talks about exist because the vision isn't right pray for wisdom pray for this kind of wisdom and pray for the gold the rment and the spiritual Revelation pray for those things in your life a wealth of those spiritual things engage in those kind of transactions so that as we make our way through the Straits we're not tied to a mass wax isn't in our ears but we can just row right through the Straits together in unison knowing we're going home we got to make it home God bless you you can stand now [Music]
