TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I have part two of seven women one bride tonight to look at and go back to Isaiah chapter four a little bit uh in this and to start I'd like to read a portion of a statement that we read Sunday morning from Harvest Time and I'm taking some time tonight kind of back up a little bit to explore um how that there are two churches two Vines there's we've talked about twins quite a bit and some of the principles that we're going to go over tonight have been very helpful to me sometimes when I'm reading something that brother Branham says and I'm having a hard time figuring out how that fits with the circumstance that it appears that he's looking to and what he's addressing and you realize that because someone has professed to be something he speaks to them as if they are and so he'll speak in such a way and instead of saying well the prophet was just wrong about who he was talking to you realize there's layers to this and there's ways that the word of God works in certain situations and so it's been very very helpful to me in understanding the words of God in this last day and he says it here in the sermon Harvest Time there are two churches in the World Church natural Church spiritual and we could uh we could just use those terms to refer to the true church and the false Church a natural church and a church spiritual they are called Christians but the church natural cannot raise it cannot resurrect it cannot Rapture it's doing its raising now in the world Council of churches but the Christian Rises to meet Christ because it's a bride to go to meet him so the church spiritual is the one that raptures it's the one that resurrects and that's the church spiritual throughout the age you want to look at it in the template of the entire church ages it's only the true church that'll come up in the resurrection and so it's this natural church that would remain even through tribulation and have to come up before white Throne he says there is a difference in them nature holds these secrets to us and we can see them as we watch them and he's using nature because there's different types that can be used in terms of two different Vines and two different seeds even as brother Branham uses the type of the wheat plant and how at different stages the life's there but as it moves on what remains is a former glare or a former age that people hold to or denominate in and I say that nature holds these secrets I find that he uses the threes quite often you'll see that in a future home that's one of the critical parts to what he's speaking in future home is the three different processes that he recognizes and so as we use the title of seven women one bride I know you probably thought about some of the statements that brother Branham makes about there must come a bride and there's been in many churches and churches and that's what we're looking at there's many women seven women scripture will say but there's just one bride one true church as we've been looking at the scripture there's two women at the Harvest Time called two Edens two cities a lot of different ways that we could talk about it but one is of Satan through the power of the Beast another one is of Christ through the power of Christ and as we looked I've looked at in Revelation chapter 17 and chapter 18 we've looked at the uh the Bible calls it the great and I know that's some aggravating language but that's just exactly the way he calls it and also the mother of harlots that is a way to refer to every political system in the world every government every Kingdom everything that's set up by man is a product of of Babylon it is it is part of that great Harlot system the mother of harlots and every religious Kingdom all organized religion every denomination is all a part of that and it's in the end time those organizations and denominations and everything that man has set up literally rejects Christ even to the point where brother Branham preaches an indictment because they have crucified Christ again so there is a rejection of Christ by this system and in Revelations chapter 18 verse 7 it says how much she hath Glory she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her and so there's judgment coming to her but she's glorified herself lived deliciously for she saith in her heart I sit a queen I rule over kingdoms and and I'm the one that's ruling I said a queen and am no Widow my husband's not dead I haven't been put away I'm married he actually claims to be Christ's bride I am no Widow and shall see no sorrow death won't come to me we will persevere this Kingdom will live forever and so this is Satan's church this the one that emerges uh if I could say this way she emerges from the laodicean church age this is the church that you're going to see come out into tribulation it's the one that's represented in the mystery Babylon that survives even after the bride is gone this is the one that's coming under the complete control and the power of Satan this is Satan's bride and as she says that she has glorified herself and lived deliciously and said in her heart she's a queen and am no Widow and shall see no sorrow we see a parallel of this in Isaiah chapter 4 verse one it says in that day brother Branham says in future home that's the end time where we're living now he says marriage divorce prostitution what more I saw today that the prime minister of Canada is separating from his wife and I thought to myself this is just becoming more and more common we're political leaders where at one time it was beneficial to maintain the appearance uh and some sort of propriety and Fidelity within their marriage because it meant something to the people that would be voting for him but now the moral condition the marriage and giving into marriage you could break up your marriage you can even be married multiple times and be voted president of the United States and so there's things that just don't matter anymore to the people and right after I was thinking that an article came out and said that mentioned Trudeau separated from a wife and it said it's more common than it used to be right amongst politics and so we're living in a time of marriage divorce prostitution he says what more this is the day the prophet points us to he says in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we'll eat our own bread and wear our own apparel notice they have some systems some means of acquiring their own food and their own clothing they don't they're not saying hey can we borrow some money can you give us a loan they have their own system their own economy their own resources their own Commerce their own merchants and as you could see it described in the Book of Revelation clearly they have access to these Finer Things of life it says we'll eat our own bread and wear our own apparel but let us be called by thy name when we read the Judgment of the great Harlot we we see that she's exposed as being mystery Babylon and not the Bride of Jesus Christ we see that she's not the New Jerusalem but she wants you to think that she's the great church she wants you to think that she's spiritual she wants you to think that she's the Church of God and so he says let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach they want to have they want to claim that these daughters and all of us together were from God and we claim the same life and we are all in this together and as I was uh we could draw back to what we're ministering on Sunday that you could take a whole and and we say that the church has rejected Christ now there's a whole other angle to that where Christ has rejected them Christ has rejected This Woman This great Christ has rejected these women the daughters and we see that Christ is offered all the kingdoms of the world political and religious there in Matthew chapter four and he says I don't want them and he couldn't be deceived into taking all these kingdoms because it wasn't the kingdoms that Christ wanted right it wasn't all all the power and all the lands he created the Earth not to have kingdoms but he created it to get a bride out of it and so he rejected the kingdoms so he could pay the price to redeem the Earth so he could have one wife one bride that's all he wanted he wanted one bride and so just as the near Kinsmen I was going to take the land and he said well I'll have the land but then Boaz says well it comes with Ruth you got to redeem the moabite and he says Ah I don't want to marm my inheritance and Boaz says I'll take it I'm more than happy to take this Gentile woman to be my wife and then after he takes Ruth you realize he Nev the land's not even mentioned anymore because the land was he had to purchase the land to get the wife and you see a direct parallel with Christ and that he pays for the sins of the whole world to redeem his bride he's even cleansing and purging the Earth as we see this in the future home and so it cries to reject these women in Matthew chapter four just looking at it and type because he wanted the one bride and these women these uh this church that glorifies herself this mystery Babylon it is it's the false that follows the true this is the this is the twin that emerges after the word Revival and she's the product of deception and she only exists because there are those who are not elect who can be deceived I know that that's maybe a mouthful in saying these things but that's just these are this is the image that the scripture gives us but verse two continues in that day the same day we're living now where there's marriage and divorce and prostitution and what more in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious so this is something that the Lord has done this connects us back to Christ this root and then The Offspring of David this this branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel brother Branham and flashing red lights are the signs of his coming says oh no wonder the Bible says it'll be beautiful and he's talking about how there's the women in the last days the beauty will increase and how that there's going to be uh-oh there's this false woman a woman started it he says a woman will end it and you can certainly look at that in the false but there's also a true it's a true one that's going to end it there's a true one that's being raised up so here when we read that the branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and them that escape of Israel are going to enjoy the fruit of the Earth this is Christ's bride that emerges verse one we have these seven women we have the false glare we have the the evil twin the seven women are the false churches but then the second verse tells us of Christ's bride that one true church and as we read in Matthew chapter 24 verse 24 there's many false Christ but there's only one true Christ we see that new testament when they say wait you almost would believe that there's another Christ when Paul says there's not another there's not under the gospel there's not another Christ so there's many false christs but one true Christ there's a carnal church that is a phrase just to describe all the carnal churches all the man-made systems all the denominations and organized religion but there's one spiritual church that is his body and that is the bride now in Revelations chapter 2 let's jump to verse 20. but in the first couple verses there it's the address to thytera there's a great compliment that's going out in terms of their works and then the bookends of works and their charity service and faith and patience that's kind of the the meat of those two bookends and then comes the complaint and there's I do encourage you to go to chapter six of the church age book and read uh the portion where brother Ram deals with this he brings in a lot more history brings in a lot more details and that go back to Jezebel and Ahab and what these things represent so there's a lot more meat on this bone than what we're getting to he says notwithstanding I have a few things against thee and it stands in great contrast to what he's just said about him he says because thou suffers that woman Jezebel and we know that Jezebel his brother Brown brings it out in the church age book was a heathen queen of a a pagan nation that it marries Ahab out of a political Alliance and so there's this union now taking place between Israel which is supposed to be spiritual and religious and this Union with politics so again we see this blending of government and blending of politics and religion and truth and she calls herself a prophetess so she's claiming to speak on behalf of God and claiming to be a religious and we know that brother bam deals with Jezebel religion and there's a lot that he is referencing to the Roman Catholic Church in this chapter the church age book he says to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed into Idols These Are Spiritual sins and he says and I gave her this is a remarkable statement I gave her space to repent it for fornication and she repented not just as Cain was given an opportunity if thou doest well will that not be accepted just as the voice uh goes out to the age and there's compliments to the age is the correction to the age there's a there's a correction to the Fallen away and and the organizing and the the committing spiritual fornication the seducing and all these things that there's a warning of Jezebel religion and if they would heed it if they would just humble themselves and heed it then he gave them space to repent but he says they did not so here's the Judgment behold I'll cast her into a bed now I want you to think about the Judgment of the of mystery Babylon and especially in the later chapters in Revelations 18 and there it says and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds so without repentance tribulation and then I will kill her children with death think of how that last horse rider when it comes into full power and how it's death it's riding out he says I'll kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I'm he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts and I'll give unto every one of you according to your works the church is here represent the mother and all of our daughters represents the and the churches here that do not repent and that commit adultery and are cast into Great Tribulation this would represent the Harlot system all the daughters all the organizations all the denominations yeah brother Branham when he looks at this and he reads this statement and he deals with it in the church age book he identifies that there's two churches True Vine and false fun so there's many churches that'll be judged but if we wanted just to sum it all up there's one true church and there's a false Church a lot of names Blasphemous names right that that are attached to all these churches so one one false church but a lot of names a lot of subsets a lot of llc's organized underneath it and brother Branham writes this in the church age book now why does God call these churches his churches even though they are the false Vine now this would this would give this would be instructive in any instance where it appears as if God is taking ownership of a church that's in the wrong image he says the truth of the matter is that they are Christians but they are not Christians of the spirit they are Christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain so there's the pretense we're a Christian church and we believe in Jesus Christ and we believe the Bible and they have their their Creed and their representation and and again it's really subtle because there's a just exactly a way this organized religion and the denominational Spirit likes to present itself such a way to say well why would you take exception with uh with this and we're we're just trying to serve the Lord and don't we all love Jesus and did he die for all of our sins and in a real subtle way it wants to make you feel bad for standing on Truth wants to make you kind of be intimidated for saying no the Bible says this and the Bible says that and it's very clear in the word of God and so they claim to be Christians and God and brother but I'm saying well God will say they are but it's a name only and it's vanity because they're Christians of the Flesh and not of the spirit we see this in Galatians chapter four we see this represented in the lineage of Abraham we know that Abraham had he said an heir in his own home born my seed born in my own home of Hagar and so Ishmael to even Abraham was an heir you know even the one born of his servant he believed to be his Heir but now when he has a son by Hagar he says oh that Ishmael would live before thee even in kind of opposition to God saying no I'm going to give you a son and I still have yet to confirm the promises oh but no I have my own seed from Hagar all that Ishmael would live before thee and God says no Sarah will conceive and shall have a son so he was delineating even from Abraham's own seed and saying there's going to come one that's going to be this seed this son of promise and in Galatians Chapter 4 verses 22 and 23 it says for it is written that Abraham had two sons the one by Bond went made and that's the Ishmael of Hagar and that Union Abraham we'd say the right seed in the wrong womb produced a wild child produced a wild man and this is the son of the bond maid the other by a free woman that would be Isaac by Sarah that'd be right seed right womb that's that's where it all lines up but he who is of the Bond woman was born after the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise this is a complete different uh uh category this is by-election that there's there can be children born seemingly born uh of the same Revival of the same word of the same person but yet be of completely different ones just fleshly one's carnal one's born of the man one's born of man's ideas and one's a legalist construct and it's things that are imposed and Things by force and it's all just appearance it's all just a facade it's all outward and inward there's really no regeneration within the soul as I said there's one that's after the Flesh and we call that the shock all right this this is the shock but then the other one is the seed Isaac he's born of the free Woman by Promise by Sarah and brother Branham says this referring to these very scriptures he says nonetheless it is in God's order that the tares grow up with the wheat and that they're not to be uprooted so let them grow up Let the twins grow up let the false Church continue as you even look at it through the church ages he he lets that one continue and it always fights against the true one and it always opposes the true one I'll say this there's um brother Brandon I think it's it was in the other parts of the church age but I don't know if it's the resume of the ages or later the same church age he's talking about the elect and only elect can be born again and and even to say the elect cannot persecute elect now what's the great secret as to why elect will never persecute elect do we know the secret we might think it's because elect knows who elect is so they won't persecute them but it's because elect don't persecute anybody and because the elect don't persecute they never run the risk of persecute an elect so the elector not persecutors they're not condemners they're not they're not Brawlers and Fighters and railers and that that's not what elect do and so there's a we're going to be seeing this where God lets them grow up even though they may be the false mind chokes and the false Vine becomes a a thorn and there's a lot of enmity and animosity of this false Vine attacking the True Vine God just lets them grow up together he said that is the command of God their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet as we read this in the church ages because there Comes A Time In This Harvest Time where they're they are bound together so the spirit is speaking to this mixed group on the one hand he's praising and on the other he's rebuking he is told what is right with the True Believer now catch this because he said there's two churches a false church and a true church Christians after the spirit Christians after the flesh so he's told the right what's right with the True Believer he's complimented the true church now he warns what the false Vine must do if it's to stand Justified before the Lord that that it takes some of this address and identifies that there's a theme in which God is revealing himself and and in incrementally unfolding himself to a true church in a true church growing the life is moving on and how there's this Shadow that's cast or this twin this false Vine that is imitating as it goes and so what is true of the true church isn't true of the false and what's true of the false isn't true of the truth did that make sense I think it did but he but he warns the false Vine what it must do to stand Justified so here we see this warning them that commit adults are going to be cast into Great Tribulation and God's going to kill your children with death and there's that that image then of a True Vine and a false fine things that pertain to this one things that don't pertain to this and then if I could say this a way that God speaks to where it seems as if he's saying it to both but it's only true of the true church now continuing Galatians chapter 4 verse 28 it says now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of the promise or children of promise notice how Paul says now we are children of Promise we're not of the Bond woman we're not we don't have there's promises that were given to Ishmael going to be a prince I'm going to have Nations and great things are going to come from him he says we're not of Ishmael we are of Isaac but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman there had to be a separation there had to be a casting out because the The Inheritance couldn't be divided between the two the one could not say well I I'm older and and I need the full of hair it's a double portion and this is the law of the firstborn this is my right this is my inheritance I couldn't even be shared so he had to cast out the Bond woman because the seed the seed of the child of Promise was was only the son of the free woman and then Paul comes to the great conclusion so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but of the free therein the example of Abraham and Sarah we see two children that are set forth and God's using this to portray something to us that you can have the right seed with the wrong womb produces the wrong does not produce an heir and then and then but the right seed with the right womb produces the child of promise and the two cannot though they may claim the same father and though they may claim some of the same fleshly characteristics and and our Father Abraham and and have similar experiences saying no you're not equal you're not joint heirs whatever whatever the the son of Promise gets you don't did also it's not one for you one for me one for you one for me no you are cast out so there has to be a separation of the shock from the seed there has to be a dividing out of the false from the true and I think it's so important don't ever let the devil muddy this up and mix it up because if we're not careful we kind of come up with this hybrid a friend we kind of play the part of Dr Frankenstein and we produce our monsters that are kind of hybrid with our ideas and the message and it's something very very scary and it's just kind of mixed and mingled together and we're like well I I guess this is what it is I guess this is what's supposed to be and what you have not done is recognize the bride's position alone in Christ that that she she holds a special place and special designation and and that in that and in that relationship there's things that only apply to her that do not apply to anyone else nobody else and God says I'm going to make a difference everyone else is going to have to go through tribulation everyone else is going to stand before white throne but my bride she holds a singular place a singular position and that can be seen in Ishmael and Isaac it can be seen in True Vine and false Vine and then it has brother Branham uses this quite frequently especially in related to the the seed is not air with the shock he presents it in a single plant and that's when it gets really interesting right because you're thinking oh the wheat plant and you have tassel and you have you have shock and and you have all these different stages of one wheat plant I said well is it the whole wheat plant ordained isn't the whole wheat plant a representative of his body but then we realize in type of the wheat plant that the light it begins a seed and it's the life that travels and everything else is a carrier so at each point uh in the in the chain it's those who have the life and the life moves on and and maybe this is just a clumsy way to try to do this very quickly as it comes to me at this point that if you're in the true church you you're a part of that life as it continues on and it's always the organization that holds back in the stem it's always the organization that holds back in the tassel it's always this deception that says oh no this is it and they denominate it's always the man-made systems and organization that hold people back in the structure of the plant but the life moves on ultimately it comes back to the original again which is the seed and it's at that stage that the shock which was just a carrier in its time begins to pull away at the Harvest Time revealing the grain again so in the type of the wheat plant once we come to Laos to see it Lael to see a shock so brother Branham calls it says laodicea is shock and so as we even are reading in the and the in the scriptures of the seven women and the uh and the life that's coming up through seven Church ages once it comes up to the shock the shock becomes a mocker of the wheat the shock becomes a persecutor of the seed this is the attitude of Ishmael this is the the seed of the Bond woman that content contempt and that animosity it raises up in the shock the shuck hates hates the seed once it gets to that stage I I thought I was going to Romans chapter 9 next but so let me just refer to it we're going to read from he cares do you care because as we have Abraham having two sons by two different women then then it Narrows down even more to you have the same man the same woman but a Jacob and Esau God portraying his election so in the sermon he cares to you carry says we got two churches at hand this morning I I'm reading this to emphasize several things but I I think the quote stands on its own I hope you can absorb this he says one of them is the Church of Pentecost that was organized at Pentecost by the Holy Spirit the second is the Church of the Roman Catholic which was organized in nicaea and he says Roman but it was Rome in Turkey in iosia turkey that's organizing Spirit of Rome so he always kind of joins them together even though geographically they're not the same but that's where Rome organized he says one of them is a spiritual birth that would be the true church the other one is an intellectual membership now if I could say this you don't have to have a Blasphemous name to have an intellectual membership you can have an intellectual membership of the quote-unquote message you can have an intellectual membership in a non-denominational church a independent church because it's when it's intellectual That's The False Image so there's a spiritual birth the other one's intellectual membership from that church come all Protestants all denominations come from that organized Babylon from that mother that was the first denomination all denominations come from that one in our relation to that one Revelation 17 says so she was a and she was the mother of harlots pot can't call Kettle greasy never heard that one except here pot can't call Kettle greasy see because it's right it's just one it's organized it's gone it's in Rome and I guess he's saying that maybe the daughters can't Point their finger and say well you're you're a harlot right they can't do that as the as the other phrases pot can't call the kettle black the the truth of that I think we've explored it here's a church that what is happening is the pot is seeing its own image in the kettle seen its own Blackness its own scarred and and that's the persecutor that's the judger it's the one who doesn't have the discernment to see the truth and so here it can't claim oh well we're Protestants and we've left he said no you're of the same life you're of the same ilk he says it's Rome I don't care what it is it's gone the Bible he says we just come through those Church ages to prove that and that's one of the main things to see through the church ages one is based on spiritual discernment the other one is based on educational and intellectual conception spiritual discernment you must have that you must have spiritual discernment help me to God help me to express this to the extent that you saw a gift of discernment on display publicly to the people in the life of the Prophet through his public Ministry we should desire to have a gifted discernment privately in our individual lives to discern and recognize evil spirits and the tactics of the enemy we we don't need the public display to attract people's attention and and have everything oh my look at that great gift and be on the platform but we need to have spiritual discernment as there was a sign given to catch our attention Lord let me have in my personal life spiritual discernment because that's a mark of this Church of God not educational intellectual conception and then he makes this tremendous statement now that puts us right back in the Garden of Eden again right back the same place when we come to needing spiritual discernment and intellectual conception say here we are back with the woman being enticed a woman being tempted and the church playing the part of the Harlot again but God's bride will withstand that I hope you've been thinking about it through all this I if I could even say this I've been building off of one statement this evil age is to prove you're not like that woman you're not like Eve that this is this is just to me amplifying that very statement that there will be a bride in the end time who is not like that even though the church did it and even Christ Church does it there will be a bride at the end time who will not now a few statements later he says one of them is scientific the other one is spiritual one depends upon the scientific process hypothesizes comes up with theories and and relies upon stats and statistics and and it just needs to figure things out and have everything laid out it's a scientific Church the other one is spiritual think of this one is scientific Arrangement the other one is spiritual discernment of the word one is scientifically arranged what groups of men say intellectual Bishop and he doesn't have to be called a bishop just go by what man says man-made religion man things by force and Things by intellect and Things by uh by structure and Order of man the other one is absolutely born of the spirit of God and lives by the spirit of God and it performs and makes come to pass the words that God promised and he says oh he says have you got shows what toxin you're taking have you got educational toxin have you got the Holy Spirit toxin now pause there for a second and I want this is to me this I kind of just dropped down and just took a little bit deeper layer on this and because we see an image now in churches and we know the woman the church is a woman and brother Brandon is going one to the other one's carnal one spiritual one's Wicked one's righteous just words I'm using there it says one's born of the spirit one's born of man and he's going back and forth so you have church and now the church is represented in two different women or the concept that Christ wanted to have a church the concept that Christ would have a body now there's one that's being raised up by man and it's filthy but another one that's being raised up by Christ and it's pure and what A peculiar position the church has that the church is supposed to be Christian and uh though this all a lot of these Concepts and principles and doctrines these are all supposed to have come from the word of God and pertain to Christ but yet there's a man-made system that's taken it immongulized it and hybrid it and now it's something completely different it's a monster and brother Brandon could say about the church it's a type of all things beautiful but a type of all things found and then brother Branham takes that and says the very same thing about the woman I I think it's important to catch that because when we use the woman in type of a church we're able to kind of disassociate from an actual woman and and our sisters and our wives and our daughters and we're not necessarily thinking anymore of actual real people but when it comes to the type of the woman brother says the woman herself is brought before peculiar position before God and on one hand she is called mystery Babylon on one hand she is foul but on the other on the other she is the the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and calmly on the other she is she is the Bride of Jesus Christ that's that's that parallel once again where you could have the two and one's a one's an awful system the other one's beautiful I said oh women women women women I think what the critic has done is captured the the severity that the word of God has towards the false woman and try to just bring that through the sieve and present that as being the message say oh you you didn't read it enough this message don't confuse this message with this right-wing nonsense that exists in so-called Christianity today that the woman should be in her place and the woman the women want a strong man and the women want to and where are the real men today and these women that are calling out for real men don't know what they're asking for dressing the way they are living the way they are saying there's no real men in the world today that's what produced you right but there's nothing like this message takes a woman and shows her real virtue and her real place none of them will take a woman and bring her to the equality that she had in the beginning except this message he says all that subtleness of Satan I can paint that picture intellectually can make a man that's not born to the spirit just turn around and around catch that think of that how the intellectual process and these things will cause someone to spin around cause them to turn around but if you have the spiritual discernment born by the word that's not going to phase you or won't get you to turn around it could come against you it could attack your mind but it won't get you to turn around so there's no way intellectually to down them with them there's not a way it's a discernment by faith this is the spiritual church you can't down them intellectually it's a discernment by faith a discernment we see what the word says we believe it there's those two churches one by spiritual discernment one by education one scientifically arranged another one spiritual discernment he has a lot of ways to describe the false but really just keeps coming back to this one thing for the true spiritual discernment by the word that faith now we see this image again in Romans chapter 9 verses 6 to 13. I hope I'm doing okay on time tonight we're very real close to just wrapping up here Romans chapter 9 verses 6 to 13. and not as though the word of God hath taken none effect I think of the preview of the Bride and I think of how the word Goes Forth and then things happen and it appears as if ah This Is What It produced this is what it's come to but God's word will not return void he says for they are not all Israel which are of Israel now what a statement not all Jews are Jews not all of the circumcision are indeed of the promise so they are not all Israel which are Israel neither because they are now he just brings it even tighter neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called so he's saying well the Seed of Abraham no not the seat of him he says not all Israel right he's just bringing this down he says but in Isaac shall thy seed be called remember that Abraham has uh Ishmael Isaac and I think it's maybe seven sons or at least six Sons by Katura I know I should know these things uh and I don't know why I'm forgetting right now but I do know it was Couture that he had other Sons but not even all them nobody's gonna help me and tell me it was it seven was it six you all are intimidated right now if he doesn't know we shouldn't known but we should know these things in Isaac shall thy seed be called he goes that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God no I'd like to I realize now that we left some things out from the book of Galatians Paul even takes it even down there more narrowly to say that the seed was not even Isaac but Christ and it was not until Christ who was the seed came that the the Seed of Abraham through Isaac is redeemed right and then then the promise is made available to all he says neither were they the Seed of Abraham the children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed the parallels perfectly with Galatians 4. for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son now notice just how he brings it down to this and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children not yet born neither having done good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her so when this child was conceived it was said unto her before the ever manifested anyone anything so that we would recognize election recognize God's choosing in this it was said the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated Paul is taking the the same mom the same dad and saying that God's election separates out there's something and again we have to recognize this is a type there's something so close to this union now where there can be an Esau that seems to whom pertains the birthright to whom pertains the adoption to whom pertains all the rights and Privileges and this would be the one but yet he expresses something in his life that's counter to what God desires and yet in Jacob The Deceiver the hill grabber God wants to portray something in him and he's chosen him by election and it shows the church carnal the church spiritual God constantly showing there's two churches there's two churches and how that there's promises that can be spoken and well this is given to the Seed of Abraham this is given to the church and this is about this and this is about that and yet God is speaking to the one who claims to be it but yet those promises that pertain to it are only for the elect he writes this in the resume of the ages he says for our studies from our studies we've already learned that much of the Revelation is totally misunderstood because we have not formally known that the church spoken of and spoken to in this book does not refer to the pure Ecclesia the elect the body of Christ the bride so there's a pure one these terms these terms weren't introduced by Brother Branham the theologians wrestled with these terms the church the Ecclesia the elect and and there was a way that they just thought well that would be Christendom that would be all that would be all these churches all these individuals all these this collection he says but it speaks to the entire body of people who are called Christians whether they be true or merely nominal think of that I know this is just a principle that maybe begs some application he just says hey this is an entire body of people who are called Christians and he speaks to them as an entire body you claim to be a Christian I'll speak to you as a Christian claim to be a brother I'll speak to you as a brother you claim to be the bride of Christ I'll speak to you as the bride of Christ as all Israel is not Israel so all Christians are not Christians thus we learn that the church is made up of two Vines the true and the false the two Vines are motivated by two kinds of spirits one has the Holy Spirit while the other is endued with the spirit of antichrist both claim to know and be known of God both purport to speak for God both believe certain very basic truths and different differ on others this is where this is where there can be a message a message given and ones to the elect and then there's there's one to the false in the one message because he's going to speak to both because they both claim to be Christian I would say that if there was a pagan Church and they're openly Pagan they don't just wouldn't waste your time don't have a message for them they've already declared what side they're on but it's that false that Satan tries to bring up together with the true so he'll speak to both and there'll be PR there'll be things pertaining to the one things pertaining to the other two Vines are motivated by two kinds of spirits one has the Holy Spirit the other one endued with the spirit of the Antichrist having similar basic truths many different similarities he continues we learn in no uncertain terms that this false Vine is the vine of Satan their Gathering is of him notice there's a gathering by Satan's power they meet in the name of God and lie that they're christs organize religion organize Christianity demonology working within the framework of the Christian Church they preach they teach they baptize they worship they partake of various rights given by Christ to the church yet they are not of God I know this isn't new revelation these are things that have been taught very plainly in the message of the hour Brothers very distinct complain about his entire Ministry these are truths that we ought not to lose sight of but since they say they are God will hold them responsible and in each age he speaks of them and to them in each age he speaks of them and to them even in brother branham's Ministry he's speaking to a Pentecostal Church that'll never receive it but he's got to correct him he he's got to speak to them in a way that says hey this is where you lack this is where you failed this is what you're missing but at the same time he has a message for the elect and I believe it's important that we discern that because he says one of the problems and much much of the problems we have with the Book of Revelation is it's we've misunderstood that sometimes when he's speaking he's not speaking to the true church he's speaking to those who are still caught up in the in the false Church you recognize that do you realize how brother Brown had to preach and this is where the spiritual discernment is so important he had to be able to preach in such a way a message that would catch those who were still caught up in the organization if you had seed that was in organization seed caught up in false Doctrine you could speak to them in a wrong way where they're like oh we're good we're good we're all right but he had to speak to them in such a way to pull them out where they were and then you'll find that there's a harm there's a theme a beautiful message uh in this in the message of the bride's secret and the her secret feast and the things he was trying to break and reveal to her and so brother it's even his entire Ministry is speaking a message to the false Church to call those who can repent out of it and then once you've called you've come out of that there's a pure message that's not just come out come out come out come out come out there's a pure message to you to where you can now begin to feed on the unfailing body word of the son of man because you couldn't do that in organization there's a there's a way that he spoke in the message to where there's a message for the bride and there's a message to get the bride out of the church he had to speak in a way too to where you can't condemn the whole thing you can't burn the whole thing up you can't just chop it all up mess it up because then you could condemn people who are in there who need to come back and then he has to be careful because if he just chops and condemns the whole thing up and then the the True Image is raised up over here so well that's that's strange he just said this was all false this is all this is all bad this is why you really need the balance of the message brother Brandon brother Bram said that you shouldn't send your kids to Sunday school didn't he that's what he said and what do we do every Sunday we send them he said you should take them and a lot of people are taking quotes and chopping them in half and use them as a a club to bully people right right either to punish them into Pentecostalism or punish them into formalism and what they're not doing is taking the message together as God preached it you got to take it all together and I'd say the most important piece is to recognize the further advancement of the life and in there's everything that's been promised so there's a church after the natural church after the spiritual but if I could say this let me read in First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 50. I'll say this and we'll just see where where we where we're LED from here Paul says and he's talking about a resurrection First Corinthians 15 his promises are about the Rapture about a resurrection we shall not all sleep we shall be changed there's a many great things that he's breaking to the Corinthian Church he says now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God carnal Church can't do it there's no life in them you cannot have a Blasphemous name and be United to Christ you cannot be an organization you can't be an organized religion you can't be part of a system and fully enjoy you've got to come out of all that and be United to Christ as the Flesh and Blood the thing of Flesh the thing of man all these carnal religions all these false churches cannot inherit the kingdom of God he says neither death corruption inherit incorruption so this inheritance is by election and by relationship and he's talking about inheriting the kingdom of God the world the church which is carnal it cannot inherit the kingdom of God it is it is corrupt that is full of Darkness it is full of death and at the time of harvest at the time of the Rapture at the time the time in which there'll be a resurrection at the time that the Lord is quickening that Rapture cycle death Darkness chaos deception and this great beautiful glorious false Vine that is laodicea that's the condition of the church to come all right away up to Revelations chapter three and the things we've been reading about the church being beautiful and powerful and Rich presenting herself as a queen presenting herself as a glorious Church remember the spirit is so close they could deceive the very elective possible so let's don't just think about a Papal Authority and a Roman Catholic priest and those different images Satan wants to transform himself into messengers of light who can either tell you more about the message than the messenger knew or tell you more about the messenger and what's wrong with the messenger there's different and and even within the framework of it just trying to hold you back in a glare hold you back you manipulate control Mastermind and piece things together in such a way to present even this message to us in a way we're like okay we've got to have spiritual discernment and and let me say this it's not a church thing it's a youth thing because you can't spell Church Without You but it's a you think it's an individual thing something that individually you have got to know that you've met Christ individually you've got to know that you're feeding on the word of God and it's not because you go to a church that looks like it's got everything right and you go to a church that preaches everything right and you want to know that you yourself are feeding on the word of God that's the most important part is to have that that that that knowing because that False Image that false fine is trying to choke the life out of you but right there in laodicea right in the midst of it I want to just kind of cover this maybe very quickly he's there Christ is there stand at the door knocking Christ has been kicked out of the church but Christ is also rejecting the church system because now he wants to call the individuals out and in Revelations 4 1 it says after this I looked and behold the door was open in heaven so we're not we're not just we're not on the earth anymore this is this is an eagle anointing this isn't the age of man this is something that's different that is opening up a door is open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I'll show thee things which must be hereafter what's the hereafter after the laodicean church age has identified itself after she has been she has been identified as being not what she claims to be as she's been as there's been a message given to call the elect out of that there's there's a there's a message of Correction to it says now there's a door open saying come up hither and I'll show you the things that are to be at the end of this age behold I stand at the door and knock and now he sees the door open in heaven he's linking those things together behold I stand the door knock and this entrance is into Heavenly into a Heavenly position this entrance is into his presence and we can say as we've been reading from Revelations 18 4 come out of her my people come out of mystery Babylon the voice of Revelations 18 4 this voice in Revelations 4 1 calls the bride out of Babylon calls are out of laodicea and I know in our minds we want to think quickly to the air but brother Adam says as soon as you've heard the word you've heard from your theophany he says you're raptured up quickly to meet it and yet we seem to stay right here what was it it was a resurrection out of dark denominationalism it was a resurrection out of carnal thoughts and carnal ideas it was this Dynamo something spinning together says the hours arrived for the change calling the bride out of Babylon because there can't be a resurrection in Babylon call no bride out of Leo to see it because there's no life in laodicea the Bible says in Revelations 19 7. I can say Revelations 18 4 Revelations 4 1 is calling the bride to 19 7. let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready that's the kingdom the marriage brings king and queen back together again and brother Branham says in the Rapture he was the word in his day speaking of Christ you've seen God reflect now God has promised to send us that again in the last days I I just felt impressed to go down this channel because bringing up all this false and again I've tried to tell you I don't want to just end on the the secrets of Babylon right in the midst of all this this is what God's doing in the midst of all this False Image and all this false religion and all these things and again it might be kind of dark for you might be saying well and I know the Temptation has been a lot of times when someone's preaching against something like give us names come on give us names I want to know the URL I want to know who these guys are and there's some there's some habits sometimes where people are preaching against preachers so often you're kind of like just tell me who it is you know just give me names and and there's no point in that as soon as you start using names you could just get yourself in trouble but there's one that we want to know and his name is the word of God he was the word in his day you seen God reflect now God has promised to send us that again in the last days what a statement to bring the bride out of that ecclesiastical mess in the only way it can be done it could be done is for Christ to do it for Christ to call us out of an ecclesiastical mess for Christ to come he's preaching the Rapture what is it he says in the Rapture for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout it's the Lord himself that descends with the shout what does that shout is that stimulating cry in the parable of the wise and foolish virgins at midnight there was a cry that came and says behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him what is this shout it is the message it is the living bread of life it is Christ bringing forth the bride what is he doing calling you out of Babylon calling you out of laodice say well brother Aaron I was born in the message I've only ever gone to message churches you have got to come out of sin you've got to come out of denominational thinking you've got to come out of organized religion as the structures exist within the system of the message and you've got to come to him this is where the danger is with church order and good teaching and good preaching and Holiness that the devil could just try to lull you to sleep into surviving within those systems that are thriving in the presence of God but you've never recognized the reason why they're doing it is because they're subject to the word and you don't want to be just right up there in the middle of a Revival and say well this is great this is wonderful and be missing on the very secret to it is that they have tapped into the life oh only Christ can bring us out of an ecclesiastical mess there's a cry that announces the bridegroom's presence for what an invisible Union here on Earth First amen we talk about the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the and the Earthly bride it's where the union takes place on Earth is that cry go you out to meet him bride comes out of this message to meet him brother Brown says in the breach there's a whole difference between the church and the bride yes sir went into the wedding supper he says the seals was broke he says why in the last Church age to reveal these truths why the lamb broke the seals and revealed them to his church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom his bride so the seals were broke in the last Church age to reveal these truths in order to collect his bride for his kingdom what's the king without a throne what's what is what good would it be for Christ to be on the throne ruling and Reign Over All the kingdoms and not have a wife by his side it'd just be a mirror of the perfect of the imperfect picture in heaven when God was all along with his creation he's got to bring his bride to him now and it's the opening of the seals the seemingly controversial endlessly criticized and picked that great truth it's the opening of the seals that collect brings forth not just subjects and servants but his bride to him he wants to bring his subjects to him now the kingdom coming into view and as the bride is going out to meet him the bride is finding her place coming out of Babylon coming out of laodicea what happens to the foolish virgin in type there's things that we can continue to type though brother Branham identified very distinctly the timing of this prophecy come into pass during his ministry he says while they went to buy why because they could buy their own bread hey they can buy their own clothes they they've got a place as they can transact they got Commerce they have Kings they have merchants and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut there's going to be a time when the bride is taken the door is shut and all that are left are left for tribulation where them that commit adultery with her cast into Great Tribulation and her children are killed with death that all the churches might know Brothers if you could come to your instruments I'd like to read this final statement if we could just be very sincere when I read this I recognize that there's been a lot of themes that we continue to repeat behind this pulpit as as months turn to years there's those who have grown from a particular time in life where they're not listening and now they are and they need to hear these things it's these these young men and these young ladies growing up in this church all the difference could be just a matter of months we preach something they're just not there yet and the word wants to bring it back to their attention again and you can't just say oh well because because we preached that before they heard it no they need to hear it again some of us find ourselves in new times in life and different cycles and Seasons where we need the word rehearse to us again I'd venture to say there's I would almost say there's nothing I preach that's that's new to any of you when we preach it but it needs to be it needs to be quickened to us in the season that we're living to encourage our faith say yes Lord this is it this is what this is what I need in the hour that I'm living and as I read this statement if it's not for you and then certainly it's for someone here and brother Brown says just exactly like it was when it was flesh here on Earth let's talk about Christ in his first coming in the Son of God now it's being revealed by the son of God as he's come to call a bride out of that system the word is still calling a bride out of a system and I believe he's still doing it for us as we said and uh in in message churches the word is still calling us out of a system the soul is perfect the soul is a Believer but I think our Spirits can be make-believers and there's no doubt this flesh is a unbeliever really just how sick it gets but God's wanting to transform it all as one he did he wants to call to us to continue to purchase of make belief any unbelief and he's calling us out of systems and ways of thinking and ways of doing things and he says in fact it's the Son of God is here calling a bride out of that system he says come out of it be separated saith the Lord saith God touch not their unclean thing and God will receive you and he says are you ready to surrender your whole life to God that's what it takes to come out of the system yeah could it be that some of us we've come out and we've come out so far but some of our thinking some of our ideas are holding to the systems he says are you ready to surrender your whole life to God he says if you are stand up to your feet and say I will by God's grace accept it right now with everything that's in me maybe you could do the same if you would he said are you ready to spend your whole life to God if you are stand up to your feet and say I will by God's grace accept it right now for everything that's in me [Music] yourself I will beg God's grace now for everything that's in me for you to read it I will by God's grace accepted right now for everything that's in me God take all these all these kingdoms [Music] all these thoughts and all these ideas Lord in my heart and in my life I Surrender him now to you could it be that it's in this case he'll take any Kingdom you offer because he gets you in the transaction he gets you and all the worship that all the seven women can give can't give him what he's after all their songs all their platitudes all their Cathedrals all their worship everything they have can't give him what he's after because you're what he's after you're the only one that has the heart that wherein he finds home and I know you're mature Believers tonight you gather on a Wednesday night because you love the Lord and so I'm not chastising you as Sinners but is there more more in store for you I say yes Lord by God's grace I will accept it right now by God's grace I will accept it right now let's pray our gracious Heavenly Father [Music] we right now accept it by your grace and grace alone I accepted for everything that's in me and with everything that's in me I Surrender every Kingdom of my heart I yield to you every ambition I give to you every Throne every Crown every room every ideal every opportunity surrender it to you let you be king or if I could just put it in the way of a husband [Music] you want our hearts so that you can Unite with us in union in marriage Lord I just quickly in just a few minutes tried to project just how this message has the voice of the bridegroom in it calling us out of Babylon calling us out of systems calling us out of our own personal ideologies breaking away from our spirit every image and every Kingdom every Idol that keeps us from you Lord may we not be afraid of the hammer and the Chisel may we not be afraid of the sword because the image that's going to be left is you what's left is going to be the match piece that you're looking for Lord tonight on a Wednesday I look out and see young men young ladies striving in the peak of babylon's power living it at the peak of laodicea and deception [Music] with every kind of Filth at their fingertips I pray Lord that you pour out a power on them but you just you come and give them a baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul now Lord I say this for all that are here there is a Deliverance for your children there is a sanctification of our minds there's a power that the son of Gods we can turn our heads Lord there's a power that loses us from the chains that bind us in genetics and and things that cling and things that try to defile and solely our thinking Lord I believe right now the word of God is powerful enough to break any stronghold to chase away every demonic power to set free every daughter of God every Son of God let us walk in the Glorious radiant image of a free and clean son and daughter of God Lord I don't want a glory in the fight anymore I want a glory in the victory I don't want to just take pleasure in the fact that I'm fighting I want to commune in the glow of a victory Lord may it be that soon after this battle has been won in our own flesh these great temptations that we face that we can commune with you King Melchizedek in the presence of our enemies [Music] Lord I believe you're wanting to do it deep work in our lives Lord I realize you've given me a vision Lord short-term mid-range long-term all right I have different levels that you're tracking me by the anointing Lord I pray that you would Quicken it in the heart of the believer tonight by my prayer Lord I'm even verbalizing this this is practical Lord this will make a difference in your life we've seen it in our own family Lord we've seen in testimony in our own health and well-being the Lord the word is sufficient for the daily task and for the daily Temptation and though these things may seem to be on a level of just describing things it's exposing Satan's agenda but not just pulling back the curtain to Rob Satan of his agenda it's gifting to the bride the wisdom and the end time and the Revelation that she needs to overcome by her Union with you by eating the word of God feeding on the book to prophesy again oh God I pray you Quicken Us by your power quick at us by your word and I pray that there be revivals break out in every home that that there would be our children our teenagers would experience a deliverance from things that bind them from the anxiety from the oppression from the even the false ambition Lord and the entanglements of the of the apps that seem to pervade Lord May there be a power cleansing power and a sanctification pour out upon our homes in our lives to lose the power of Christ granted I pray Lord as we commit these things to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah
