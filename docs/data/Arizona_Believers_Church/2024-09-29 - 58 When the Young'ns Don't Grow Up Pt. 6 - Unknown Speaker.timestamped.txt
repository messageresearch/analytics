[0:00] we're using the phrase grow up for a
[0:03] very specific purpose and the title has
[0:05] been when the youngans grow up and we're
[0:07] using grow up to reference to the
[0:10] process of maturing and even the
[0:13] reference of youngans to think about
[0:15] babies in Christ and those who've been
[0:17] birthed by the word and the Holy Spirit
[0:19] has sealed them into the body of Christ
[0:21] and so the phrase grow up uh is
[0:24] intentional and I'm wanting to use it to
[0:26] not only indicate the process of
[0:28] maturing but this maturing unto ult
[0:31] fulfilling your ultimate purpose and
[0:33] maturing unto
[0:34] adoption and we've looked at the subject
[0:37] of adoption a number of times I'll just
[0:39] maybe give the warning and some may say
[0:40] this would be appropriate for every um
[0:43] service but there's going to be a lot of
[0:45] repetition I look back in the last four
[0:47] years and it was four years ago this
[0:49] month that we had our first regular
[0:51] service on a Sunday and we haven't
[0:53] stopped since then and so there's kind
[0:56] of an anniversary month of sorts though
[0:58] we don't really look too much to those
[1:00] things uh but in these four years I
[1:03] realized there's been a lot of
[1:04] repetition on a number of different
[1:05] subjects and maybe we could reduce them
[1:08] down to just a few uh but it's just the
[1:10] way the Lord has led us and also as the
[1:12] church has grown maybe there's some that
[1:15] uh the Lord addresses and we kind of so
[1:16] that we're all kind of in the same place
[1:18] and we're harmonized and we have a same
[1:20] vision and goal not only as a local body
[1:22] but as the body of Christ and I would
[1:25] acknowledge I acknowledge that the
[1:26] subject of adoption is uh easily
[1:29] misunderstood OD and not intentionally
[1:31] misunderstood but it can be easily
[1:33] misunderstood I still can remember the
[1:36] time in my life when God begin to open
[1:38] up to me the subject of adoption the
[1:40] impact that it had on me uh personally
[1:42] and individually and yet the kind of the
[1:45] extreme nature with which I responded to
[1:47] that and I can still remember brother
[1:49] Bill Ivy uh making a couple comments
[1:51] behind the pulpit uh he was there it was
[1:54] in hom Homer Louisiana he was preaching
[1:57] and at the very end of the service he
[1:58] made a couple statements about adoption
[2:00] that just oriented me a little bit
[2:02] better and made me realize wow there's a
[2:04] way that you could look at this that
[2:05] makes it something that it's not and so
[2:08] I believe that God is always uh wanting
[2:10] to bring us deeper into a greater
[2:12] understanding of even those things we
[2:14] believe we already understand and so as
[2:17] this process unfolds I trust that God
[2:19] could deal with you in your own personal
[2:21] way to understand better what he's
[2:23] wanting you to know so I'm not trying to
[2:25] force a particular agenda on this
[2:27] subject but rather uh be fa faithful to
[2:30] how brother brandham taught the subject
[2:32] so that we could understand what God
[2:34] wants us to know in this end time in
[2:37] Ephesians chapter 1 verse5 I'm taking a
[2:40] little piece from chapter 4 as it's laid
[2:42] out in our scofi Bibles but it says in
[2:43] love having predestinated us unto the
[2:47] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[2:50] himself according to the good pleasure
[2:52] of his will brother Brandon points to
[2:54] the scripture quite a bit on the subject
[2:55] of adoption and he points out that
[2:58] election looks for and all election
[3:00] looks back to fornal that God forew you
[3:02] therefore he elected you but then
[3:04] predestination looks forward to Destiny
[3:06] you might actually find that in your
[3:07] scoffield that it's written just exactly
[3:09] that way and so this and in the margin
[3:12] notes there the footnotes so this
[3:14] predestination isn't looking to where
[3:17] you even are now but the process that
[3:19] God wants to ultimately bring you to and
[3:22] that is the adoption of children by
[3:23] Jesus Christ it is according to the good
[3:25] pleasure of his will so this is God's
[3:27] perfect will this is his desire this is
[3:29] what he wants for you and the word
[3:32] adoption that is used here speaks of
[3:34] establishing something or fixing
[3:36] something and and a making of something
[3:39] so there is in some ways uh an
[3:42] application or way that we could view it
[3:44] and someone say we've been adopted as
[3:45] children into the body of Christ and to
[3:47] use that language wouldn't be wrong if
[3:50] we're using it in a familiar sense in
[3:51] terms of what happens now I'm a sinner
[3:53] now I'm in the body of Christ God has
[3:55] brought me into his family and there's a
[3:57] way that we use that brother random at
[3:59] times used that word to actually speak
[4:01] of that transition of coming out of the
[4:02] world and out of sin into the body of
[4:05] Christ and so when by one Spirit he's
[4:07] baptized all of us into the body of
[4:09] Christ we've entered into that then
[4:11] brother brandom opens up another
[4:12] dimension to it that now that we are in
[4:14] the promised land of the Holy Ghost
[4:16] there's an establishing and a fixing and
[4:18] a making a more permanent uh Dwelling
[4:20] Place in that promised land so brother M
[4:23] used the phrase the placing of children
[4:25] not the birth of children but the
[4:26] placing of children which I believe we
[4:28] could say is maturing if maturity I
[4:31] think sometimes just helps us because
[4:33] there's some words sometimes that we
[4:34] could be used brother BMA even thinks he
[4:36] says the word predestination has become
[4:38] a a a gaggy thing or a hair in a Biscuit
[4:40] or it's become a term that's uh
[4:42] uncomfortable for some people in
[4:44] Pentecost and so he might use a
[4:46] different phrase just to appease them
[4:48] brother bam called it coming of age he
[4:50] said in another place seasoned out so
[4:52] there's this process it's not this
[4:54] moment in time but it's this process as
[4:56] a matter of fact brother brandham says
[4:57] that um though I think in some ways as
[5:00] Believers we've established stations of
[5:02] justification sanctification baptism and
[5:04] the Holy Ghost and say well when I was
[5:06] 13 and2 at 12:00 in the morning I got
[5:08] Justified and then six years later I got
[5:10] Sanctified and we have these stations in
[5:12] life but in reality God can do all three
[5:14] at
[5:15] once and in a moment of confession and
[5:18] repentance and a move of the power of
[5:20] God a person could be brought into the
[5:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost brother ramam
[5:24] said there's no more tering meetings for
[5:26] the Holy Ghost because when that day of
[5:28] Pentecost was fully come the time at
[5:30] which God had appointed for the Holy
[5:31] Spirit to come it's at that moment the
[5:33] Holy Spirit was poured out in the church
[5:34] and from that moment on it's been the
[5:36] age of the Holy Ghost for every True
[5:38] Believer and so you're no longer pining
[5:40] for it and yelling for it or begging for
[5:42] it God's promised it to the believer and
[5:44] he says if you've been seeking the Holy
[5:46] Ghost for years he says and you don't
[5:47] have it you either mistaught you don't
[5:49] understand or something's wrong
[5:50] somewhere so there is a ability there's
[5:54] God can come on the scene and change a
[5:56] person's life in a moment but then the
[5:59] seasoning out and this as brother says
[6:01] coming of age is something that takes
[6:03] place to one who has been born again
[6:05] brother uses this phrase when they
[6:06] mature and show what they are we could
[6:10] see somebody worshiping the Lord and
[6:12] praising God and they could be shouting
[6:14] or speaking in tongues you may look over
[6:16] at them and notice maybe their hair is a
[6:17] different way or they're dressed a
[6:18] different way you can begin to
[6:20] immediately judge them not knowing that
[6:22] that is a child of God and you've judged
[6:24] them externally and I would say they
[6:26] haven't shown who they are yet you
[6:28] haven't seen who they are because the
[6:30] life is just now begun and I would say
[6:33] that the goal of the word we've been
[6:34] saying the goal of the baptism of the
[6:36] Holy Ghost is that we remain no we not
[6:39] remain children we see that in Ephesians
[6:41] chapter 4 we don't want to always be
[6:43] children but as Paul said I travail
[6:45] until Christ be formed in you that we
[6:47] grow into Christ's image that's the goal
[6:50] of the word birth is to bring us into
[6:52] Christ's image in Romans 8:1 17 this
[6:57] speaks to this is some review picking up
[6:59] some review and it speaks to the very
[7:01] purpose of the Holy Ghost uh and this
[7:04] process of maturity if children then HS
[7:07] as children as babes in Christ we should
[7:09] desire and seek for the milk of the word
[7:12] of God that we may grow thereby because
[7:15] as children we stand to receive an
[7:17] inheritance not just the earnest of that
[7:20] inheritance not just the earnest of the
[7:22] adoption which is the Holy Ghost but
[7:24] rather we stand as children we stand to
[7:26] receive uh more the wece to receive the
[7:29] inheritance and so if children then
[7:31] heirs Heirs of God and join heirs with
[7:33] Christ so this as children we're heirs
[7:35] and be because we are heirs God wants to
[7:38] deal with us a particular way and he
[7:40] says if so be that we suffer with him
[7:42] that we may be also glorified together
[7:45] the phrase glorified together is
[7:47] intentional Jesus in praying uh asked
[7:51] that the father would glorify him with
[7:52] the glory that he had and God speaks
[7:54] back and he says I've glorified you once
[7:56] I'll glorify you again and there was a
[7:58] glorification at is baptism there was
[8:00] another glorification to come and then
[8:02] he says I want my children to be
[8:05] glorified also that we may also be
[8:07] glorified together and to participate in
[8:10] this Glory we must suffer and this
[8:13] suffering is the process of character
[8:15] development why do we have to go through
[8:16] the process of character development
[8:18] because of our destiny because of our
[8:20] calling because of our inheritance do I
[8:22] need to go through the process of
[8:24] character development in order to be
[8:25] saved no do I need to go through the
[8:28] process of character development in
[8:29] order to be worthy of the baptism goes
[8:31] no but it's just an understanding that
[8:33] scripturally there is a process that God
[8:35] takes his children through and it's for
[8:38] the reason of you inheriting all that
[8:40] God would have for you in 2 Corinthians
[8:46] 12:14 uh I I
[8:48] feel I just feel a real intense burden
[8:51] this morning so um I apologize if my
[8:55] pacing is a little bit too quick but
[8:57] I'll say here we could just pause for a
[8:58] moment now we want to begin to just
[9:00] break this down in great
[9:02] detail so with that as a foundation
[9:04] recognize this principle in scripture 2
[9:06] Corinthians chapter 12:14 behold the
[9:09] third time I'm ready to come to you and
[9:11] will not be burdensome to you for I seek
[9:13] not yours but you and Paul is even prior
[9:16] writing about how you know he he doesn't
[9:19] want to be a burden to the church and
[9:20] them having to support his ministry and
[9:22] look out after him and so he says I
[9:24] don't want to be a burden I'm not
[9:25] looking for what you have I don't want
[9:27] your resources or your time but I I
[9:29] worried about you I I'm convinced of
[9:32] your calling and I'm concerned about you
[9:34] and he says for the children ought not
[9:36] to lay up for the parents but the
[9:37] parents for the children Paul considered
[9:40] himself to be a father in The Gospel to
[9:42] the Corinthian Church and he's saying
[9:44] you as my spiritual children you don't
[9:46] have to lay up for me you shouldn't be
[9:48] laying up for me or providing for me but
[9:51] rather as a spiritual father I want to
[9:53] provide for you and he's drawing he
[9:56] makes this statement to make his point
[9:58] and if you look on both sides of this
[9:59] later you'll find that uh Paul is using
[10:02] a natural type to reinforce what he's
[10:04] been using in a spiritual sense but he's
[10:06] identifying that parents have a duty I
[10:09] would say an obligation but maybe even
[10:11] better a burden to care for their
[10:13] children that there is a a
[10:16] responsibility that they gladly take on
[10:18] there's something unique that's birthed
[10:19] with inside a parent where they have not
[10:22] just this Duty and obligation and even a
[10:24] legal responsibility in some cases but
[10:26] there's a love that drives them to do
[10:28] this and therefore they're concerned
[10:30] about how they're brought up they want
[10:31] to rear them they want to provide for
[10:34] them they want to look out after them
[10:36] and in doing this as he says the Parents
[10:39] Ought To Lay up for the children they
[10:40] should be forward-looking and they
[10:42] should be thinking about their
[10:44] children's future not just their own
[10:47] present that when we raise children
[10:49] sometimes we're in the moment and and
[10:51] we're more worried about the way things
[10:52] look in that moment uh and we're maybe
[10:55] worried about the immediate future but
[10:57] par parenting kind of has a long range
[11:00] vision and it's forward-looking and as
[11:02] much as we would love for them to stay a
[11:04] certain age or a certain size or a
[11:06] certain way how we have to understand
[11:08] that one day we hope that they would
[11:10] move on in life and experience the same
[11:13] things that we have been able to
[11:14] experience marriage and Parenthood and
[11:17] the cycle begin again that should be a
[11:19] parents long-term longr Vision that
[11:22] they're providing not just in the moment
[11:25] what they will eat what they wear and
[11:27] while they live but resources so for
[11:29] their future and we say Paul as a father
[11:32] in The Gospel was laying up for them
[11:34] spiritual Treasures laying up for them
[11:36] not things that would just get them
[11:38] through a church service and not just
[11:39] doing things that would get them through
[11:40] the meeting whenever he came and put on
[11:42] the dog for me I'm coming let's make
[11:44] that weekend really great but he was
[11:46] wanting to lay up for them so that they
[11:48] would have resources to come he was
[11:50] storing spiritual food he was giving
[11:52] them principles and directives that they
[11:54] could live by not just through that
[11:56] moment but for the rest of their lives
[11:59] as it says in Proverbs 13:22 this is a
[12:02] scripture I know that we've used quite
[12:03] often a good man leaveth an inheritance
[12:06] to his children's children it's a direct
[12:08] reference to grandchildren there's not a
[12:10] lot of places in the Bible where maybe
[12:12] Grand uh a grandparent is mentioned in
[12:15] that phrasing uh but here it speaks to a
[12:17] good man is one that leaves or a good
[12:20] man leaves an inheritance for his
[12:22] grandchildren and this is one that is
[12:26] there's a lot of depth to this but
[12:28] there's a he takes care and how that he
[12:31] leaves and what he leaves and what he
[12:33] lays up as a parent should lay up for
[12:35] his children so if he take that image
[12:37] this good man is laying up things for
[12:39] his children but he does so in a way to
[12:42] where his grandchildren can also benefit
[12:44] from it so he T his is uh can take care
[12:48] of his inheritance in such a way to
[12:51] where it's not only preserved for his
[12:53] children but it's
[12:54] expanded and I I'm going to leave to my
[12:57] children uh uh this this hund F this
[13:00] hund and then I've preserved it I've
[13:03] taken care of it but I've done so in a
[13:04] way to where my own child can take that
[13:07] and he can make that a h hundredfold he
[13:09] can double it he can triple it and so
[13:11] that's the the image behind this is a
[13:13] good man leaves an inheritance not only
[13:14] to his son but his son's son and he's
[13:17] done so in such a way toward the
[13:18] integrity and the honesty and the
[13:20] character that he's done it in and what
[13:22] he's imparted to his own son preserves
[13:24] that inheritance for the grandson so the
[13:27] Bible says in Proverbs 2 26 train up a
[13:30] child in the way he should go and when
[13:32] he is old he will not depart from it
[13:35] mean to train up means to dedicate or
[13:38] inaugurate therefore there is this idea
[13:40] of when you train up a child you bring
[13:42] him to a place to where he is being he's
[13:46] beginning and he's introduced train up a
[13:48] child in the way bring him to the way
[13:50] that he ought to live I remember I
[13:53] believe his brother Tom Ray one time
[13:54] ministered on this subject he shared it
[13:56] with me I didn't have the privilege of
[13:58] hearing the service because you're
[13:59] sharing with me uh this this phrasing of
[14:01] train up and when it says to begin or
[14:04] inaugurate to train up a child in the
[14:06] way so you want him to begin in the way
[14:09] that he ought to be so the way that we
[14:11] deal with our Toddlers and our adolescen
[14:13] and our pre-teens and our teenagers is
[14:16] all to prepare them for that time when
[14:18] they begin in adulthood when they come
[14:20] to that place where I've been
[14:21] inaugurated in my position I've been
[14:23] inaugurated I I've come to my place
[14:25] where I can begin to now fulfill my
[14:28] destiny as a person so train him up in
[14:31] the way that he should go so that when
[14:32] he is old he has not departed as from
[14:34] what he ought to be he is able to remain
[14:36] and to develop and to flourish in his
[14:41] calling in Luke 6: 40 it says the
[14:44] disciple is not above his master but
[14:46] everyone that is perfect shall be as his
[14:50] master perfect it means to be it's to
[14:52] put into order it's the same word that
[14:53] speaks of maturity to be complete to be
[14:55] perfect it's arranged placed as one
[14:59] ought to be this is what you come to the
[15:01] completion or fulfillment if there's a
[15:04] possibility if there's a range of 1 to
[15:06] 10 if you could have if we ask somebody
[15:08] right now do you want uh 10 $100 bills
[15:11] uh or five and say well how many are
[15:12] there well there's 10 how many do you
[15:14] want they I want I want 10 I want it all
[15:16] and so if you got all of it that'd be
[15:20] perfect maybe not if you got all it'd be
[15:24] complete cuz there's no more to give you
[15:26] want it all like in Monopoly that's what
[15:28] you you want to get it all you want to
[15:29] take it all and so this is it says uh to
[15:32] be perfect as his master filled up to
[15:34] his master his master's teaching him not
[15:37] to make uh servants and to make him
[15:39] subject a and this uh and to make him
[15:41] underlings and minions but rather I want
[15:43] you to become like me that's the goal of
[15:46] the master to the one the disciple is
[15:48] not above his master but he becomes like
[15:51] his master scripture saying after he's
[15:53] been completely trained he will be like
[15:56] his teacher co-equal
[15:59] that's that's the that's the goal of
[16:00] discipleship the goal of discipleship is
[16:02] not to create uh people who do your
[16:05] bidding right and people who can do what
[16:07] you ask them to do but people who can do
[16:09] what you do completely who can come into
[16:12] that same image as the master ma in
[16:14] Matthew chapter 10: 24- 25 the disciple
[16:18] is not above his master nor the servant
[16:19] above his Lord it is enough for the
[16:22] disciple that he be as his master catch
[16:25] that and there another angle of this it
[16:28] is is enough for the disciple that he be
[16:30] as his master and the servant as his
[16:31] Lord if they have called The Master of
[16:33] the House beels above how much more
[16:34] shall they call them of his household so
[16:37] he's making the point that if they hated
[16:40] me before they hate you and be not
[16:42] surprised if the world hates you because
[16:43] you're not of this world and if they
[16:45] call me be elub then how much more are
[16:47] they going to call those in my family
[16:49] and those of the house of the Lord be
[16:50] elub but he's pointing out once again it
[16:53] is enough it is perfect for the disciple
[16:56] to be as his master not be greater than
[16:58] his master
[16:59] but it is the goal of discipleship to
[17:01] make the disciple co-equal and as or
[17:05] perfect as his master be therefore
[17:07] followers of God as deal children that
[17:09] you may be therefore perfect as your
[17:11] father which is in heaven is
[17:14] perfect so it is the goal of
[17:17] discipleship that you that the disciple
[17:20] or the servant become as the master or
[17:22] Lord and Paul writes to the Galatians in
[17:25] Galatians 4: 1 and 2 I say that The Heir
[17:29] as long as he is a child as long as he's
[17:31] a young and as long as he's immature as
[17:33] long as he has not fully grown or
[17:34] developed he differs nothing from a
[17:36] servant though he be Heir or Lord or
[17:40] have the right to inherit
[17:42] all and as long as he is a child and
[17:44] during this time of life where he's
[17:46] being seasoned out and he's growing and
[17:47] he's learning he's placed under tutors
[17:49] and governors until the time appointed
[17:52] of the father and that time is not when
[17:54] he becomes Heir but when he receives his
[17:58] inherit inheritance he's granted full
[18:00] right and title to what he stood to
[18:02] receive all along so though a disciple
[18:06] is being trained to be as his master he
[18:08] has a role that differs than the master
[18:11] until the time that he comes into the
[18:13] very image of the master and therefore
[18:15] can inherit All rights responsibilities
[18:18] and even the image of the one that is
[18:20] the master or the ruler but as long as
[18:23] you're immature as long as you're a
[18:24] child there's going to be certain rights
[18:26] and privileges withheld from that child
[18:28] not that he isn't able to and not that
[18:30] he won't but there's a certain there's a
[18:32] different a time of life a different age
[18:34] for him until the time appointed of the
[18:38] father now if you'll take your Bibles
[18:40] and turn to 1 Timothy
[18:46] 5:4 it's speaking of uh he's addressing
[18:49] various roles within the church and
[18:51] within the family and he's talking about
[18:54] the honor that ought to be given to a
[18:57] widow and
[19:00] if I I I'll say this before we begin to
[19:01] read the scripture what I'm hoping that
[19:03] we have in our Consciousness right now
[19:07] is a little bit of a review of Where
[19:09] we've been in terms of what it means
[19:11] about the young 's grow up and and all
[19:14] those things that have been implied in
[19:15] that most recently in this process of
[19:18] growing and this orientation of the
[19:20] parent to the child this responsibility
[19:23] for a parent to raise his child with the
[19:26] future in mind and part of that is as a
[19:29] parent I have a legacy or I have I have
[19:32] property I have certain things that I'm
[19:33] going to leave to my child and so I want
[19:35] to prepare him for that time when it's
[19:37] all his and and that this is what the
[19:40] Bible is speaking of as long as he's a
[19:42] child though it's all his ultimately he
[19:46] can't just use it as he wants to that's
[19:48] why that in the parable of the prodigal
[19:50] son he had to ask for his inheritance at
[19:52] that time it had to be something that
[19:54] the father would Grant and what happened
[19:55] he gives it to him and what does he do
[19:56] squanders it why he's prod he's wasteful
[19:59] he's immature he couldn't handle it and
[20:02] so there is this responsibility for
[20:05] parents it's a responsibility of a
[20:06] household to train up their child so
[20:08] that they can inherit what is rightfully
[20:10] theirs it's yours now but you leave it
[20:13] to them and they'll be able to preserve
[20:15] it for their own children hand something
[20:17] down that you gave them to their own
[20:20] children and then this to me adds just
[20:24] another dimension to it though it's
[20:25] reinforcing what we've already looked at
[20:27] but if any widow have children or NE ref
[20:29] let them learn first to show piety at
[20:32] home and to requite their parents for
[20:34] that is good and acceptable before God
[20:37] it's interesting if any have children or
[20:39] nephews and you think well what about
[20:40] the nieces but it is a reference to you
[20:44] would say maybe the that primary
[20:45] responsibility of providing and
[20:47] caregiving as far as uh financial
[20:50] support or Aid would maybe fall on the
[20:52] man and it's also just the way that the
[20:54] Bible is written and translated but the
[20:56] word nephew could have just as easily
[20:58] been translated to grandchildren so if a
[21:01] widow have children or grandchildren if
[21:04] this widow's husband had been a good man
[21:06] and he had left an inheritance for her
[21:08] and that inheritance was also for her
[21:10] children and for her children's children
[21:12] says this is God's perfect will this is
[21:14] the way that it ought to operate if any
[21:16] widow have children or nephews let them
[21:18] learn first to show piety at home so
[21:22] there is and to requite their parents
[21:24] for that is good and acceptable before
[21:27] God that phrase good and acceptable
[21:29] before God according to the good
[21:30] pleasure of his will this is something
[21:32] that pleases the Lord so taking this
[21:35] phrasing children and grandchildren have
[21:36] a scriptural duty to regard or to act
[21:39] kindly towards their parents or
[21:41] grandparents if you have a a mom or dad
[21:45] and it's saying that you ought to show
[21:46] piety to them you should be act kindly
[21:48] towards them you should reverence them
[21:50] and as it's dealing with the Widow it's
[21:52] one whose husband is is no longer with
[21:54] them they have needs they have maybe
[21:56] they lack resources or opportunity it
[21:58] says let them let them first learn to
[22:00] show let the grandchildren and the
[22:02] nephews or let the children and the
[22:04] grandchildren learn to show respect to
[22:06] show honor and give reverence at home
[22:08] over their own household over their own
[22:11] parents or grandparents and to requite
[22:14] their parents you know what that means
[22:18] reparations recompense to requite their
[22:21] parents means to compensate them or not
[22:23] to say payback because that might not
[22:25] sound right but to return the favor that
[22:27] as our ch our parents for years lay up
[22:30] for the children and they sacrifice and
[22:32] they have a long range vision and
[22:34] they're providing they're supporting
[22:35] their children through great Labor and
[22:37] through great pains and looking out
[22:38] after their children that there comes a
[22:41] time when Lord willing the child is then
[22:43] able to return the favor as Peter as
[22:47] Jesus even told Peter when you were
[22:48] young you did this and you did that he
[22:50] says but when you're old a man another
[22:51] will carry you and it's this idea that
[22:53] there comes a point when parents aren't
[22:55] able maybe to continue to parent their
[22:58] children or look out after their
[22:59] children or always being the ones doing
[23:01] the handout but the chance the the
[23:03] charents the the the parents look to the
[23:06] children and the children become
[23:08] charents right where they're they're
[23:10] caring for their parents they're looking
[23:13] out after them so this is something for
[23:15] both parents and children to
[23:17] consider that when they're young and I'm
[23:19] looking out after them and I'm clothing
[23:21] them and I'm feeding them and I'm and
[23:23] I'm raising them up and I'm paying for
[23:24] this and I'm paying for that that I I
[23:26] might want to do it in a way where I'm
[23:27] not so toxic and I'm not so wasteful and
[23:31] I'm not so lacking in character
[23:33] integrity that when I get older and I
[23:35] really need them to show piety and I I
[23:38] need to lean upon them that I have a
[23:41] relationship and they have the resources
[23:43] to show kindness to me this is something
[23:47] for parents to consider and then also
[23:49] for children to consider as Paul is
[23:51] saying that it's better that a
[23:53] widow and I want to say this correctly
[23:56] because I do believe that we have a
[23:57] responsibility as Christian Chans to
[23:58] look out after widows we have a a
[24:01] responsibility to look out for things
[24:03] and to live for others and look upon the
[24:04] needs of others but Paul is saying that
[24:08] the it's not the church's responsibility
[24:10] to do that but it's the family in the
[24:13] church it's their responsibility to look
[24:15] out after the the Widow if that is in
[24:18] fact their mom or if it's their
[24:19] grandmother there's a responsibility of
[24:21] those who are relatives in the family of
[24:23] God uh to look after that one in their
[24:25] family so that that that those needs
[24:27] don't be become a burden on the church
[24:30] does that make sense well it doesn't
[24:32] sound I hope it doesn't sound dismissive
[24:33] of the poor or needy or the Widow as far
[24:35] as a church responsibility but I would
[24:38] say the primary responsibility for a
[24:40] church is to Res resource the children
[24:42] and
[24:43] nephews to properly encourage and
[24:46] resource and instruct the family so that
[24:48] given that opportunity they can show
[24:50] that piety and they can requite to their
[24:53] families so there there is a duty for
[24:58] these
[24:58] children to regard that kindly and to
[25:01] requite their parents this is something
[25:03] for children and parents to consider and
[25:05] so parents should care for their elderly
[25:09] parent children should care for
[25:11] grandchildren should care for their
[25:12] elderly parents or grandparents looking
[25:15] out after that and having a
[25:16] responsibility to that and so parents
[25:19] need to train them up to do
[25:21] that and so growing up is necessary to
[25:25] fulfill scriptural Duty
[25:28] and this adoption that we're looking at
[25:30] this maturity is related to these
[25:33] obligations and this the it's relates to
[25:37] the inheritance and the care for it
[25:39] these obligations of inheritance and
[25:41] these obligations of care that this
[25:43] process of maturing for you as an
[25:46] individual means I stand to receive an
[25:48] inheritance so therefore I have a
[25:51] responsibility to grow up to so I can
[25:53] fit in that place I can fit into that
[25:55] inheritance I can receive all that
[25:57] Christ has for me receive a full reward
[25:59] I need to grow up because I'm an heir I
[26:01] need to grow up and suffer with him and
[26:04] to be glorified together with him and so
[26:07] my inheritance means I've got to go
[26:09] through this process and then also I
[26:12] have a duty and of care over that
[26:14] inheritance as we look at this image of
[26:16] children and grandchildren providing
[26:18] back and showing Piet to the parents but
[26:20] then also preserving for their own so
[26:22] there's a duty of care that goes with it
[26:25] and what we want to focus on and we've
[26:27] completely run out of time ready to do
[26:28] this today probably but I really want to
[26:30] focus on how Jesus follows this
[26:33] pattern Jesus is an example of God's
[26:36] desire for young on in Hebrews chapter
[26:38] 2:10 for it became him for whom were all
[26:41] things and by whom are all things in
[26:43] bringing many sons under Glory this is
[26:46] partner with Romans chapter 8 and
[26:47] bringing many sons under Glory it says
[26:50] that if we suffer him we have to to be
[26:52] glorified together with him we must
[26:54] suffer with him so it became him this is
[26:56] God's will this is God's desire desire
[26:58] this is his will to in bringing many
[27:01] sons into Glory it was God's will to
[27:03] make the captain of their salvation
[27:05] perfect through
[27:07] sufferings Jesus Christ is the captain
[27:10] of our Salvation when he was born he was
[27:13] born in the world as a babe laying in
[27:14] the mangor and that does not speak to
[27:16] the Perfection that the scripture is
[27:18] speaking of here he was made perfect
[27:21] through sufferings brother Bram says in
[27:23] in plain language the very character of
[27:25] Jesus was perfected by suffering so
[27:28] wasn't physical development it wasn't
[27:29] his looks it wasn't his limp it was his
[27:31] character that's perfected by suffering
[27:33] and according to Paul he has left his
[27:35] church a measure of suffering that they
[27:37] too by their faith in God while
[27:39] suffering for him would come to a place
[27:41] of
[27:43] perfection not a place of Salvation not
[27:45] a place in terms of your relationship to
[27:48] God but
[27:49] Perfection and it is it is a dynamic
[27:51] that exist by for one who is in
[27:54] relationship I believe that when we get
[27:56] married that we ought to have a faith
[27:58] that we're doing the right thing that we
[28:00] believe you say have a revelation of
[28:02] God's will know that this choice is
[28:04] pleasing to God and that when one uh
[28:07] professes their love for someone and
[28:08] brother jiah I'm not doing this just for
[28:10] you but maybe this is a I'm practicing
[28:12] for Friday there is this obligation that
[28:14] one would have to their spouse and it's
[28:17] not a difficult one they're in love
[28:19] right it's love it's like man I can't
[28:21] wait for this to start I can't wait for
[28:23] this to begin but you know one of the
[28:25] most outstanding characteristics of of
[28:26] real love is how it Seasons out and
[28:30] matures and sometimes when you'll notice
[28:32] with some couples when they have a real
[28:34] mature Love sometimes they giggle at the
[28:36] immature love and I go isn't isn't that
[28:39] cute all those things because sometimes
[28:42] you'll look at a love that's immature
[28:44] and it's more pining and it's more uh
[28:47] toxic than and and there's competition
[28:51] between two people than two people that
[28:52] really love one another and it's not
[28:54] always a competition to prove who loves
[28:56] the other person most and it's not not
[28:58] always questioning and always doubting
[28:59] but with love comes confidence and faith
[29:02] and the stability it's a real growing
[29:04] and maturing and so this place of
[29:07] perfection is not relationship alone but
[29:10] it's the dynamic of that relationship
[29:12] and this relationship between God and
[29:14] Christ is an example how that God
[29:17] looking at his son saw fit to make him
[29:20] perfect through
[29:22] sufferings in Hebrews chap 1: 2 and now
[29:25] I want you to see this pattern God has
[29:27] his son Jesus Christ and so as we said
[29:31] before this process of maturity has to
[29:32] do with inheritance and care it says
[29:35] hath in these last days spoken to us by
[29:37] his son God used had in past spoke by
[29:40] prophets today in this time as this
[29:42] letter is being written he has spoken to
[29:43] us by his son whom he hath appointed
[29:46] heir of All Things by whom also he made
[29:48] the world Christ was appointed heir of
[29:53] all and this inheritance catch this I
[29:56] put it this way this inheritance was
[29:57] rece received or
[29:59] granted not that he was made Heir in
[30:02] other words he stood to receive it he
[30:04] was appointed heir of all things but
[30:05] then it's granted he takes possession
[30:08] after he
[30:09] suffered after he obeyed in Psalms 1:1
[30:13] it says the Lord said unto my Lord the
[30:15] Lord said unto my Lord this is God
[30:17] speaking to the son sit thou at my right
[30:19] hand until I make thine enemies thy foot
[30:22] stool we understand that this position
[30:24] to sit sit down my right hand he's
[30:26] ascended up on high at the right hand of
[30:28] the father this takes place after his
[30:30] death burial and Resurrection this takes
[30:31] place after his suffering and we know
[30:34] according to Revelations 3:21 that he
[30:35] has overcome it's granted because he
[30:39] overcame and so the father tells the son
[30:41] sit thou at my right hand you have
[30:43] overcome sit thou at my right hand and
[30:45] he says I'll Grant to you to sit with me
[30:47] in my Throne I'm going to Grant
[30:49] something to you not the promise of it
[30:51] but you're actually going to do it in
[30:53] full reality full realization of the
[30:55] promise when you overcome amen and so
[30:58] this is something that he is destined to
[31:02] then he suffers he obeys he lives it out
[31:04] and then he receives it in Isaiah 53: 10
[31:08] to12 my there was some really beautiful
[31:10] things in Ezekiel and different places I
[31:12] was reading about and I realized I'm
[31:14] probably going to get in the Weeds on
[31:15] that so I want to stay very very focused
[31:17] so that this is
[31:20] um as sometimes it said you know that I
[31:23] covered a lot of ground and what they
[31:25] mean is I just stayed stayed in the same
[31:28] spot just drilled straight down so
[31:29] that's probably what we're doing today
[31:31] Isaiah 5310 to12 yet it pleased the Lord
[31:34] to bruise him he's the son he's the
[31:36] Messiah but yet it pleased the Lord to
[31:37] bruise him Heath put him to grief when
[31:41] thou shalt make his soul an offering for
[31:43] sin he shall see his seed he shall
[31:44] prolong his days and the pleasure of the
[31:46] Lord shall prosper in his hand now Quite
[31:48] A Prophecy of the Messiah that all the
[31:51] RAB beins missed all the teachers all
[31:53] the Masters missed Peter even rebuffed
[31:55] the idea that the Messiah Christ would
[31:57] have to suffer and die but because he'll
[32:00] make his soul an offering for sin he's
[32:02] going to see his seed those destined
[32:04] predestinated he going to prolong his
[32:06] days that it would not even end and the
[32:08] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper his
[32:09] hand he shall see of the travail of his
[32:12] soul and shall be satisfied God will be
[32:14] satisfied to see the travail of his soul
[32:16] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[32:18] servant justify many for he shall bear
[32:20] their iniquities now that to me just
[32:22] summarizes the sacrificial aspect of
[32:25] Christ's first mission Christ call the
[32:28] reason why the son came to Earth he
[32:30] comes as a babe wrapped in swallowing
[32:31] clothes born in a manger increase in
[32:34] wisdom and knowledge and stature with go
[32:36] and favor with God and man he comes to a
[32:38] place as we'll uh uh reference here in
[32:40] just a little bit where he is called to
[32:43] be he's destined to be a
[32:45] sacrifice but he's also destined to be
[32:48] the heir of all things and the law
[32:50] required Perfection for both he had to
[32:54] be a perfect sacrifice so there was a
[32:56] process he had to go through in order to
[32:58] be though he could be without blemish
[33:00] even if you looked at the hepher and the
[33:02] different SS they could be perfect but
[33:03] there had to be a way the washing and
[33:05] the ceremony that went with it it's all
[33:07] testifying what God wants to do in the
[33:08] house of the Lord what he wants to do
[33:10] for you and so this these scriptures are
[33:14] prophesying how that Christ would come
[33:16] the Messiah the one who is going to hand
[33:18] is going to be prospered he's going to
[33:20] be uh the the heir of all things he's
[33:23] going to also be a sacrifice and in
[33:26] suffering and travailing and becoming a
[33:28] sacrifice it's going to please the Lord
[33:30] and God is going to be sa satisfied so
[33:32] verse 12 says therefore will I divide
[33:36] him a portion with the
[33:38] great and he shall divide the spoil with
[33:41] the strong because Heath poured out his
[33:43] soul unto
[33:45] death this is showing us that it's in
[33:48] this process of him suffering and dying
[33:51] that God says therefore I'm going to
[33:53] Grant and to give him his inheritance
[33:56] the phrase I will divide him a portion
[33:57] with the
[33:58] speaks directly to giving the
[34:00] inheritance to the son and then he also
[34:03] divides the spoil with the strong there
[34:05] is your joint HS of go with Christ and
[34:08] that Christ is going to then share and
[34:10] divide the spoil with those who also
[34:12] overcome I have overcome I have
[34:14] prevailed and sat down in my father's
[34:16] throne and according to Isaiah 53:12 I
[34:19] will therefore divide the throne with
[34:22] you also you will be able to sit with me
[34:24] in my Throne also because I have been
[34:27] obedient because I poured out my soul
[34:29] into
[34:30] death says in Matthew 28: 161 17 and 18
[34:35] then the 11 disciples went away into
[34:36] Galilee this is after his uh death
[34:38] burial and Resurrection before his
[34:40] Ascension into a mountain where Jesus
[34:42] had appointed them and when they saw him
[34:44] they worshiped him but some doubted and
[34:46] Jesus came and spake unto them saying
[34:49] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[34:52] in Earth amen he could say this with
[34:55] this
[34:56] absolute assurance
[34:58] before he ascends up as we see it in
[35:00] Luke and in Acts chapter 1 before he
[35:02] ascends up we can see very plainly that
[35:05] Christ is saying I have conquered all
[35:09] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[35:12] earth in Revelations 11:15 and the
[35:15] seventh angel sounded and there were
[35:16] great voices in heaven saying the
[35:17] kingdoms of this world to become the
[35:19] kingdoms of our God and of his Christ
[35:21] and he shall reign forever and
[35:24] ever not just a thousand year reign it's
[35:27] not just a a moment of time but the
[35:29] kingdoms of this world are become the
[35:30] kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ
[35:32] and he shall reign forever and ever this
[35:35] is something I want to emphasize this
[35:36] this is something that Christ obtained
[35:38] through
[35:39] obedience being a son he was made
[35:42] perfect it says in bringing many sons to
[35:45] share in the spoil and being able to
[35:47] receive the inheritance of that Throne
[35:50] he was made perfect through sufferings
[35:51] his character was perfected through
[35:54] suffering therefore God wants to bring
[35:56] the strong through suffering so that
[35:58] they too can also come to the same place
[36:01] of perfection because Christ has been
[36:03] appointed heir of all things he's going
[36:04] to be granted to sit at the right hand
[36:06] and he wants to also share in that power
[36:08] with you so he's left a process so that
[36:11] you too can enjoy the spoils am of the
[36:14] son where in all power is get unto me in
[36:16] heaven and earth and the world and
[36:18] kingdoms of this world have become the
[36:20] kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ
[36:21] and he shall reign forever and ever and
[36:23] he's going to share that power with you
[36:25] am this is something he
[36:28] obtained in Hebrews 1:4 it's already
[36:31] said he has been appointed air of all
[36:33] things in verse two being made so much
[36:35] better than the
[36:36] angels as Heath by inheritance obtained
[36:39] a more excellent Name than they how did
[36:43] do it by inheritance he obtained it even
[36:46] Hebrews goes to Great Links to say that
[36:48] the testator can make all sorts of
[36:50] promises but it requires a death in
[36:52] order for it to be conveyed and Christ
[36:54] was promised many things but there was
[36:55] this Covenant that he had to fulfill in
[36:58] order for it to come to pass and be
[37:00] realized Jesus Christ as God's only
[37:03] begotten son had to grow up I know
[37:06] that's self- serving but had to grow up
[37:08] to the
[37:09] throne he had to go from a Manger Throne
[37:12] to a
[37:14] throne it was something he had to suffer
[37:17] it wasn't just given to him he didn't
[37:19] just say well bless God I'm the Son of
[37:21] God this is mine I have a right to it
[37:24] because he had the right image of God
[37:26] Satan thought it was something he could
[37:29] take right he thought he could steal it
[37:32] Jesus knew it wasn't something you could
[37:33] steal Satan thought he could take it
[37:35] maybe by right because he was
[37:40] co-equal Matthew 4: 8-9 if you recall
[37:43] there was great time spent on this
[37:44] already this year in these things I
[37:47] think I can just make reference to this
[37:48] temptation in the wilderness again the
[37:49] devil taketh him up into an exceeding
[37:51] high mountain and showeth him all the
[37:53] kingdoms of the world and the glory of
[37:55] them amen what amazing symmetry with
[37:58] Matthew chapter 28 when he takes his
[38:00] disciples into a mountain where he's
[38:01] appointed them and there on the top of
[38:02] that mountain he says all power is given
[38:05] unto me in heaven and Earth but there a
[38:08] few years before the devil had Tak him
[38:10] to an exceeding high mountain and showed
[38:12] him all the kingdoms of the world in the
[38:13] glory of them he had only shown him a
[38:15] half all the kingdoms of the world and
[38:17] all the glory of them he said unto him
[38:19] all these things will I give thee if
[38:21] that will fall down and worship me I'd
[38:24] like to put it this way Satan offered
[38:25] him a shortcut right Satan offered him a
[38:28] shortcut to by bypass God's requirement
[38:31] of
[38:33] perfection and it wasn't that Satan was
[38:35] making a bluff or an empty offer he said
[38:37] I will give it all to you cuz I got it
[38:40] just by telling a lie right I got it by
[38:43] deceit I got it by trickery I got it by
[38:46] provoking lust and and sensation and I
[38:49] can give it to you if you will just
[38:50] merely worship me the smallest task the
[38:53] smallest
[38:55] ask and what he was offering to Jesus
[38:57] Jesus was all the kingdoms of this world
[39:00] through a
[39:03] shortcut I'll give it all to you and the
[39:05] glory of them if you'll just worship me
[39:08] and he thought what he had so easily
[39:10] taken he could also Grant but Jesus in
[39:13] that moment rebukes him and stays with
[39:16] the
[39:17] word what was he doing he was
[39:20] proving to be the right kind of a son in
[39:24] Hebrews chap 5: 8 and9 though he were a
[39:26] son yet learned he obedience by the
[39:28] things which he
[39:29] suffered and being made
[39:32] perfect this it's this increase he
[39:34] learned he increased in knowledge he
[39:36] learned by practice he was being
[39:37] informed and here he is in in in Matthew
[39:40] chapter 4 coming to this place of
[39:42] Temptation and he's suffering and he's
[39:44] rejecting and being made perfect he
[39:46] became the author of Eternal salvation
[39:48] unto all them that obey
[39:52] him
[39:54] Christ was offered kingdoms of this
[39:57] world
[39:58] through Satan's plan Satan's plan is
[40:00] always a
[40:01] shortcut it's kind of that nature to
[40:03] follow the path of least resistance when
[40:07] the believer is typically going the
[40:08] opposite
[40:09] way in Philippians chapter 2: 5-1 11 so
[40:13] you could see this on this uh this scale
[40:16] let this mind be in you which was also
[40:19] in Christ who been in the form of God
[40:21] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[40:23] God there's some form there's some image
[40:26] there's some likeness
[40:28] uh that we have there's something we
[40:30] possess inherently by a birth but the
[40:32] equality to God Jesus did not regard as
[40:34] being something easily grasped he did
[40:37] not regard it as something he could just
[40:38] take when he was offered all the
[40:40] kingdoms of this world Satan had an
[40:42] image of what God could be and how that
[40:44] he can now Grant to Christ the very
[40:46] things that God had promised to give
[40:48] Christ he's trying to operate in this
[40:50] image in Christ recognizes immediately
[40:52] this isn't how a father treats a
[40:55] son I know I tell my children all the
[40:57] time do what I say and you can have
[40:58] whatever you want hasn't
[41:01] worked but I feel that way and maybe if
[41:05] I was a a better father a more perfect
[41:07] father what I'm asking them to do would
[41:09] be more instinctively right for them to
[41:11] respond to but it's kind of that
[41:12] principle that where where there's H uh
[41:15] that you want to give your children
[41:16] something and here Satan's got this lack
[41:18] of character just worship me just cater
[41:20] to my ego just make me look good kind of
[41:23] what Saul was saying hey go worship with
[41:25] me let's make a lot of pretense in the
[41:26] meeting so that everybody thinks that
[41:28] I'm still cool with you uh Samuel and
[41:31] and Satan says worship me and act that
[41:34] without any real literal consequence
[41:36] it's not going to make Satan anything
[41:37] else other than what he is Satan and he
[41:40] said and I'll give you all the kingdoms
[41:41] of this world and Jesus recognizes in
[41:44] the moment that's not the real heart of
[41:46] a father that's not that's not character
[41:48] that's that's not the way God works
[41:50] that's not the way the father operates
[41:52] am because he had to learn he had to
[41:55] grow he knew thought it not rob to be
[41:57] equal with God but yet Satan being
[41:59] co-equal except the fact that he could
[42:01] create tried to rob from God what he had
[42:05] but made himself of no reputation took
[42:07] upon him the form of a servant and made
[42:09] and was made in the likeness of men and
[42:11] being found in fashion as a man he
[42:13] humbled himself notice and became
[42:15] obedient unto death even the death of
[42:18] the
[42:19] Cross look at that at the very end of
[42:21] verse eight this is what Christ does he
[42:23] comes a as the Son of God and he becomes
[42:26] Obed obedient unto death he humbles
[42:28] himself he's in the form of a servant
[42:32] he's in the form of a son he's in the
[42:33] form of a young he's in the form in
[42:35] relationship to the father as a master
[42:38] what does he do he's now been made
[42:40] subject and he obeys he obeys he becomes
[42:43] obedient unto death even the death of
[42:44] the Cross it's Isaiah
[42:46] 53 he yielded himself to the father's
[42:49] will he yielded himself to what is
[42:51] calling was he yielded himself to be
[42:53] what God wanted him to be in that moment
[42:54] in that time even unto death and then
[42:58] what does verse 9 say wherefore
[43:00] therefore and because of that thus as a
[43:02] result or consequently God also hath
[43:05] highly exalted him and given him a name
[43:07] which is above every
[43:08] name that at the name of Jesus every
[43:11] knee should bow and of things in heaven
[43:12] and things in Earth and things under
[43:14] Earth and that every tongue should
[43:15] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[43:18] glory of God the Father this equality
[43:21] with God was not something easily
[43:23] grasped it was not something something
[43:24] stolen it was not just something he
[43:26] could just take or something he could
[43:27] demand a right to of some sort of
[43:29] entitlement but he became obedient as a
[43:32] servant not only to man but ultimately
[43:34] to God and being in that fashion in that
[43:36] form he became obedient unto death and
[43:39] God the scripture saying because he did
[43:42] that he was exalted above everything
[43:44] else and given a name above everything
[43:46] that the name of Jesus every name should
[43:48] bow until that time until Christ had
[43:51] done that the name Joshua the name
[43:52] Jehovah savior the name Jesus would not
[43:55] have invoked this type of worship but
[43:57] now that he has obeyed it is necessary
[44:00] that we give him honor and
[44:03] praise that is why there's stones and
[44:05] rocks will cry
[44:07] out and every tongue should confess that
[44:10] Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God
[44:13] the
[44:16] father now we've covered this just on a
[44:19] small scale through a number of
[44:20] statements before bringing it directly
[44:22] from Brother bram's teaching that this
[44:25] law of adoption makes a son of equal
[44:27] with the
[44:28] father here he he thought it not robbery
[44:30] to be equal with God it means that once
[44:33] a child is once a child is trained
[44:37] brought up tested proved then he can
[44:40] have all the father's
[44:42] power doesn't mean the son doesn't have
[44:45] authority sometimes there's this
[44:47] conflation of well uh if I if I'm not an
[44:50] adopted son then I I I can't do anything
[44:53] I I can't overcome I can't pray for the
[44:54] sick no there that's just a a misre in a
[44:58] police officer doesn't have power what
[44:59] does he have authority so what do you
[45:02] have power in the name of Jesus Christ
[45:04] well as one who has been commissioned as
[45:06] one who's been sent as one that has been
[45:08] told and the one who has been given the
[45:10] commission from Christ from God you've
[45:12] been commissioned so you can operate in
[45:14] the power that he has given you as a son
[45:16] and daughter of God brother bam said
[45:17] he's written he signed the check you
[45:19] just need to cash it is that not true so
[45:22] there's rights and privileges and powers
[45:24] and responsibilities that we all have as
[45:26] children
[45:28] the devil can't take those away from
[45:30] us but this Coe equality makes the son's
[45:34] name on the check just as good as his
[45:37] daddy's and Jesus Christ demonstrates
[45:39] this pattern of how babes grow to mature
[45:43] Believers and in Matthew chap 3: 13-1 17
[45:46] then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan
[45:47] under John to be baptized of him notice
[45:51] just how early in the reading of the New
[45:54] Testament we find is last time we've
[45:55] seen him is at the age of 12 after he's
[45:58] increased in wisdom and favor with God
[46:02] he's coming at this age of 30 years old
[46:05] to be baptized by John why it has to
[46:08] happen but John forbade him saying I
[46:10] have need to be baptized to thee and
[46:12] comest thou to me and Jesus answered
[46:14] suffer it to be so now for it becometh
[46:16] us to fulfill all
[46:20] righteousness I know you
[46:23] may it's not that you're wrong that you
[46:25] have need to be baptized of me because I
[46:27] I'm going to baptize with fire I'm going
[46:29] to do something that's going to
[46:30] revolutionize the relationship of
[46:32] mankind to God but before that can
[46:35] happen we have to fulfill all we have to
[46:38] fulfill all righteousness as the
[46:39] sacrificial lamb I need to be
[46:43] washed then he suffered him and Jesus
[46:45] when he was baptized went up straightway
[46:47] out of the water and lo the heavens were
[46:48] opened up open unto him and he saw the
[46:51] spirit of God descending like a dove
[46:53] enlightning upon him what was happening
[46:54] Heaven and Earth kissed
[46:57] the father comes now in a special uh
[47:00] outpouring a special Union and low of
[47:02] voice from Heaven saying this is my
[47:04] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[47:07] and how did Brother bam over and over
[47:09] and over again open up that scripture in
[47:11] whom I'm well pleased too
[47:14] dwell that there was there was this now
[47:16] this identification of the father with
[47:19] him this glorification I have glorified
[47:21] it he says and I will glorify it again
[47:23] and in this very moment of his baptism
[47:25] God identifies him self with his son as
[47:28] the Spirit came to dwell in Jesus Christ
[47:31] and that Holy Spirit comes that Dove
[47:33] lighting down upon him as a
[47:35] dove and in that moment maybe for some
[47:37] brother said that's when the word was
[47:39] made flesh and said oh then Jesus wasn't
[47:41] Jesus wasn't Divine before well whose
[47:43] son was
[47:45] he he was always a son he always the
[47:49] child of God he was always deity it
[47:50] wasn't Mary's blood it wasn't Joseph's
[47:52] blood it wasn't a mix of either of those
[47:54] Bloods it wasn't human blood it was the
[47:55] blood of God so he has a relationship to
[47:58] God as a son even before this momentous
[48:01] and even in some ways paradoxical
[48:03] occasion on the Jordan River where this
[48:05] great uh Supernatural event happens and
[48:07] there's this union now in a supernatural
[48:10] way between the Flesh of Jesus Christ
[48:13] and him as a son and him as a person and
[48:15] the Very power and logos and the word of
[48:17] God there's this unifying moment that
[48:19] takes place Jesus was always the Son of
[48:21] God he was always the seed of God he was
[48:23] always deity but it's then at that
[48:25] moment that the father come to dwell in
[48:28] him and we follow the same pattern in
[48:31] Galatians 4:6 he says and because you
[48:32] are Sons God has sent forth the spirit
[48:35] of his son into your hearts crying ABA
[48:37] father and those you were always a seed
[48:39] that's you always were a
[48:42] seed but you needed
[48:45] quickening and immediately it says in
[48:47] Matthew 4:1 then was Jesus led up of the
[48:50] spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted
[48:51] of the
[48:52] devil so now having this experience of
[48:55] being glorified by the father this is my
[48:58] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[49:00] notice this phrasing this speaking I'm
[49:03] pleased to dwell in him this is my
[49:05] beloved Son this is after the good
[49:07] pleasure of my will that I would dwell
[49:09] in him for this time for this season for
[49:11] this moment this is my good pleasure and
[49:13] immediately he's LED of the spirit Into
[49:15] the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[49:18] devil without having to go back over all
[49:20] these scriptures not only could we start
[49:22] with this point in Matthew 4 but we
[49:24] could continue throughout his entire
[49:26] Ministry and see that that he always
[49:27] stayed faithful to the father's word not
[49:30] his own will not my will be done but thy
[49:32] will be done not to his flesh but he was
[49:34] faithful to the
[49:35] kingdom and I say one of the greatest
[49:37] indicators In the Flesh of of maturing
[49:39] and growing up is obedience it's one of
[49:42] those single most outstanding
[49:43] characteristics of somebody who's grown
[49:45] up is when they obey one of the single
[49:47] the I said single And I was going to
[49:48] give two but the two most outstanding
[49:50] characteristics of one who's immature is
[49:53] stubbornness and
[49:55] Rebellion it's those trademarks that
[49:57] don't say that well he's stubborn he's
[49:59] rebellious he's not my son like we think
[50:01] that's the that's the original 23 in me
[50:04] well you know Jack's not doing what I
[50:06] asked him to do he he can't be my
[50:10] son right that ain't it which means he's
[50:13] he'd be
[50:15] stubborn Jack's like
[50:18] you you know he takes care of me every
[50:20] morning comes opens the blinds for me
[50:22] makees sure I have my drink in the
[50:23] morning carries my bag and my coat after
[50:25] every single service and I always say
[50:27] man you make me feel like a a very
[50:29] important person so he always takes it
[50:31] and says don't say you're a very
[50:32] important
[50:35] person so this isn't about Jack this is
[50:39] about
[50:42] Rowan now honestly think about it
[50:44] stubbornness Rebellion mistakes failures
[50:46] doesn't change your
[50:48] sunship but it it's indicative of one's
[50:51] character one's maturity and so it's
[50:54] greatest indicator that you see one
[50:56] growing up and maturing is obedience and
[50:59] you one of the marks not so one as one
[51:01] obeys that's a mark of them growing up
[51:03] you want to know what the mark of a one
[51:05] who is mature is
[51:07] precision when you ask it when they they
[51:10] know that they must do something they
[51:11] don't just do it halfway they don't just
[51:14] address it they just don't it's just not
[51:16] quick but they're precise words they
[51:18] know how it needs to be done so the
[51:21] other day and I don't know if I
[51:22] mentioned this before but Jack was want
[51:24] needing to do something I I and I said
[51:27] well I said yeah just use this just set
[51:30] it up that way and and I said you can
[51:32] you can do it and he said Dad how do I
[51:35] know how to do it if you never showed me
[51:37] how to do
[51:40] it yes
[51:42] son in other words and then if you show
[51:44] them how to do it then they will try to
[51:46] do it they say okay could you do this
[51:48] for me and they go and do it and then
[51:50] once they when they're mature it's when
[51:51] they do it exactly the way it's supposed
[51:53] to be done the Precision of it to know
[51:56] how to do something to know how it
[51:58] should be done to know the will to know
[52:00] the image to know the
[52:01] purpose these are the marks of
[52:04] maturity the Bible says in Romans 8:14
[52:07] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[52:08] God they are the sons of God so Jesus
[52:12] Christ now as the father comes to dwell
[52:14] the the dove the spirit of God
[52:15] descending like a dove lights upon him
[52:17] the voice says this is my beloved Son in
[52:20] whom I'm well pleased to dwell he the
[52:22] Son of God Jesus Christ receiving this
[52:25] great baptism in indwelling of the
[52:27] father because you are Sons God sends
[52:29] forth the spirit into your hearts
[52:31] immediately Jesus has led of the spirit
[52:33] Into the Wilderness to be tempted and as
[52:35] many as are the sons of God they are led
[52:38] by the spirit of God and brother
[52:40] brandham said and hear ye him which is
[52:42] his consistent adoption teaching but God
[52:44] made you a son to give you a trial we
[52:48] think okay to see how you're going to
[52:50] act with
[52:52] it character conduct Behavior
[52:57] why did God allow Jesus to be
[52:59] immediately tempted of the devil it's
[53:00] showing us this pattern brother B said
[53:03] as soon as you get the Holy Ghost you
[53:04] set yourself up as a Target to be
[53:05] tempted of the devil this is exactly
[53:07] what happens for every True Believer
[53:09] that there's going to be this time H uh
[53:12] where the Devil Comes yes a great
[53:13] experience in the Lord a great
[53:14] outpouring a great move of God but
[53:16] there's going to come a season where the
[53:17] spirit of God is going to lead you into
[53:19] the Wilderness and you're going to be
[53:20] tested you're going to be tempted you're
[53:21] going to be tried you're going to be
[53:24] given a trial cuz God wants to bring out
[53:26] who you really are he going to see how
[53:28] you're going to act with
[53:31] it in John 8: 26- 29 Jesus says this
[53:36] this is to get the character of the son
[53:37] I have many things to say and to judge
[53:38] of you but he that sent me is true and I
[53:41] speak to the world those things which
[53:42] I've heard of
[53:44] him I'm just saying what he told me to
[53:47] say that's the mark of a a maturing son
[53:51] and I'm going to be very precise that's
[53:53] the mark of maturity they understood not
[53:55] that he spake to them of of the father
[53:57] then said Jesus unto them when you have
[53:58] lifted up the son of man then shall you
[54:00] know that I am he and that I do nothing
[54:02] of myself but as my father hath taught
[54:05] me I speak these
[54:08] things he says in one place I have power
[54:10] to lay down my life I have power to
[54:12] raise it up again he says this have I
[54:13] received of my father he claimed no
[54:16] power of his own until he had been
[54:17] resurrected and had went and entered
[54:19] into heaven and presented himself as a
[54:21] the sacrifice and come back down to
[54:22] earth to reinforce the commission to the
[54:24] disciples he says now oh power in Heaven
[54:27] and Earth is given unto
[54:30] me and I do nothing of myself but my
[54:33] father taught me I speak these things
[54:34] and he that sent me is with me the
[54:36] father hath not left me alone for I do
[54:38] always those things that please
[54:41] him this is this relationship and
[54:43] dynamic that existed between the father
[54:45] and the son Jesus did only that which
[54:46] pleased God he kept his word he
[54:48] manifested his word he says in John
[54:51] chapter 5 then answered Jesus and said
[54:53] to them verily verily I say unto you the
[54:54] son can do nothing of himself
[54:57] but what he seeth the father do for what
[55:00] things soever he doeth those also doeth
[55:02] the son likewise this is harmony this is
[55:05] obedience this is maturity this is what
[55:08] pleases the father this is the template
[55:10] that brother bram's even pointing to
[55:12] that the character of Jesus was
[55:13] perfected by suffering and so God has
[55:15] left us a measure a process of character
[55:18] development that we too by our faith in
[55:20] God and suffering according to his will
[55:21] would come to the same place of
[55:23] establishment the same place of maturity
[55:25] the same place of
[55:27] Perfection you don't have to suffer to
[55:29] be bride but the bride suffers to be the
[55:32] Masterpiece she suffers to become into
[55:35] his Perfect
[55:37] Image so Jesus comes to his
[55:40] Transfiguration he
[55:42] prayed I've glorified it I'll glorify it
[55:44] again this is what the Lord
[55:46] speaks we read about it Matthew chapter
[55:49] uh 17 I want to read it in Mark chapter
[55:51] 9 it just brings it together in one
[55:54] chapter uh I may be questioning my
[55:57] reasons for doing it right now uh just
[56:00] in that the main difference I wanted to
[56:03] bring out is how in Matthew chapter 17
[56:05] he says this is my beloved Son in whom
[56:07] I'm well pleased so remember that and
[56:09] notice how that fits perfectly with mat
[56:12] Matthew 3 this is my beloved Son in whom
[56:14] I'm well pleased so it's pronounced then
[56:16] you're my son and he pronounces it again
[56:19] and watch what he says and I say unto
[56:20] them verily I say unto you that there be
[56:23] some them some of them that stand here
[56:25] which shall not taste of death till they
[56:26] have seen the kingdom of God come with
[56:28] power brother has a lot of great things
[56:30] to say about this and after six days
[56:32] Jesus taketh him him with him Peter and
[56:35] James and John and leadth them up into a
[56:36] high mountain apart by themselves and he
[56:38] was transfigured before them this this
[56:41] glorification this Transfiguration and
[56:43] his reignment became shining exceeding
[56:45] white as snow so as no Fuller on Earth
[56:48] can white them and there appeared unto
[56:50] them Elijah with Moses and they were
[56:51] talking with Jesus and Peter answered
[56:54] and said to Jesus now there's so much
[56:55] symbolism representing in these first
[56:56] few verses so many types so many Shadows
[56:58] so many connections to Revelations 10 so
[57:00] many different connections to his the
[57:02] revealer of the son of man the
[57:04] manifestation of the god in this last
[57:06] time and great symmetry with the high
[57:09] mountain all these different beautiful
[57:11] things are in there but now Peter sees
[57:13] this and and he says unto Jesus Master
[57:16] it is good for us to be here let us make
[57:18] three Tabernacles one for the and one
[57:20] for Moses and one for Elias and there
[57:22] was something though sincere but clearly
[57:24] misguided by this and so it's it seems
[57:27] to me that I think if Peter was writing
[57:30] this this wouldn't be on the record but
[57:31] others were happy to make sure Peter's
[57:34] little faux paw here it was recorded in
[57:36] the record because the god immediately
[57:38] answers to the Moses and Elijah and
[57:40] Jesus and this setting forth of these
[57:42] three as if this would be complete and
[57:43] this would be perfect he says for he
[57:45] wish not what to say for they were so
[57:48] afraid so there kind of Matthew shown a
[57:50] little bit Grace for Peter he didn't
[57:51] know what to say he got nervous right
[57:52] you know how sometimes you're just
[57:53] nervous and you say things this is what
[57:55] happened to pet
[57:57] let's build three
[57:59] churches and verse 7 and there was a
[58:01] cloud that overshadowed them and a voice
[58:04] out of the cloud saying this is my
[58:07] beloved Son but what does he say now
[58:11] hear
[58:13] him this is my beloved Son hear ye him
[58:18] says in Matthew 17 this is my beloved
[58:19] Son and whom I'm well pleased hear ye
[58:23] him Moses Elijah Christ
[58:27] and he says now in this moment let us
[58:29] build three Tabernacles let us do this
[58:30] let us do that he says no no there's
[58:32] only one at this Transfiguration at this
[58:36] foreshadowing after this preview he
[58:38] takes him to this place and he says this
[58:41] is my beloved Son in times past I spake
[58:44] by the prophets in times past I spake
[58:46] through other vessels but now my brother
[58:49] man said this is my son he speaks for
[58:52] me what he says is as good as my word
[58:57] he had he had obeyed the father in
[59:00] Everything Jesus said something he said
[59:02] I'm only saying what the father told me
[59:03] to say this happened I'm only doing what
[59:05] the father told me to do there was this
[59:06] operation this harmony that existed
[59:08] between the father and son where God
[59:10] knew whatever he revealed to him that's
[59:11] what Jesus would do whatever God told
[59:13] Jesus to do that's exactly what Jesus
[59:14] would do and now God got to the point to
[59:16] where he is
[59:19] me he's one we got this harmony we got
[59:22] this Unity there's this full submission
[59:24] hit what he says is exactly what I would
[59:26] have said what he does is exactly what I
[59:28] would have done and God commits all
[59:30] judgment power and authority to his
[59:34] son brother brandham teaches very he
[59:37] never waffles on this he never Ventures
[59:39] from this this Mount Transfiguration was
[59:41] the adoption of Jesus
[59:43] Christ after after Matthew chapter
[59:46] 3 it's not two baptisms of the Holy
[59:49] Ghost and I I'm not trying to get caught
[59:52] up in numerology it's just what
[59:54] happened brother brandham said what
[59:56] watch what God did when his son was born
[59:58] he let him go 30 years testing him
[1:00:00] trying him then he gave him three years
[1:00:01] of hard trial and then at the end of the
[1:00:04] hard trial when he was seen that his son
[1:00:05] was about the father's business brother
[1:00:07] man says Mount Transfiguration he took
[1:00:09] Peter James and John three Witnesses and
[1:00:11] went up on a top mountain and there God
[1:00:13] performed the laws of
[1:00:16] adoption this is what God did watch what
[1:00:19] God did to his son he's born he goes 30
[1:00:21] years he's tested he's tried and he
[1:00:23] gives him three years of hard trial and
[1:00:24] then at the end of that trial he says
[1:00:26] God performed the laws of
[1:00:29] adoption what was it that brought him
[1:00:31] there suffering process of of character
[1:00:33] development growth and maturity is what
[1:00:36] brought Christ to this
[1:00:40] place brother BR makes a a remarkable
[1:00:42] statement about what God witnessed on
[1:00:43] Mount
[1:00:45] Sunset said he witnessed the same thing
[1:00:47] on Mount
[1:00:48] Transfiguration but what brought brother
[1:00:49] Brown to mount
[1:00:52] Sunset we're all thinking afford and
[1:00:55] then in a hike
[1:00:58] right loss hard trial God tells him to
[1:01:02] go to the Pentecostals what he do he
[1:01:03] listens to his mother-in-law what did he
[1:01:05] do he lost a
[1:01:07] lot he God shows him a vision because
[1:01:10] he's afraid to hurt a man's feelings
[1:01:12] what did he do he didn't follow in it
[1:01:14] suffered he suffered because there was
[1:01:16] going to come a time when God was going
[1:01:17] to show him a vision and he was going to
[1:01:18] have to do it and he couldn't run from
[1:01:20] it he had to be
[1:01:22] there brother Bram said Jesus had proved
[1:01:25] to God that he had been the right kind
[1:01:26] of
[1:01:29] son brother says in another place God
[1:01:31] was doing here just exactly what he
[1:01:33] asked man to do his son had been
[1:01:35] obedient he had minded the father he
[1:01:37] hadn't been gten about in place and say
[1:01:38] you see who I am my campaign's the
[1:01:40] biggest there is in the country yes sir
[1:01:42] he'd been obedient he'd been obedient to
[1:01:44] the father he hadn't been gathering
[1:01:45] around the things of the world associate
[1:01:47] with him he'd been obedient he hits at
[1:01:49] the religious attitude and the sinful
[1:01:51] rebellious attitude the stubbornness and
[1:01:53] the Rebellion he hits it both of them he
[1:01:54] said he hadn't been out there trying to
[1:01:55] make a name for himself out there in the
[1:01:57] in the meetings the biggest name in the
[1:01:59] country and he hadn't been gting out
[1:02:01] with the world in associal with he says
[1:02:02] he had been obedient Jesus had been
[1:02:04] obedient and it's through his obedience
[1:02:06] that he had been brought to this
[1:02:08] place of
[1:02:10] perfection and God performed the laws of
[1:02:14] adoption brother brandham says a family
[1:02:17] when a son is born into it it's a son
[1:02:19] then but that son had tutors to raise it
[1:02:21] and if that son never did come to be the
[1:02:23] right kind of a son he never became heir
[1:02:26] quite a statement still a son when he
[1:02:29] says he doesn't become an heir it
[1:02:31] implies the receipt of the property The
[1:02:34] Possession to have full power and
[1:02:35] authority over it says but if he was the
[1:02:37] right son and the son that would obey
[1:02:39] his father then that son was adopted or
[1:02:42] placed positionally he became heir of
[1:02:44] what the father had and that's what God
[1:02:47] was doing on Mount Transfiguration when
[1:02:49] he took his own son after he had been
[1:02:51] proven to be the right son and had stood
[1:02:53] all Temptations He took him up on amount
[1:02:56] Transfiguration and overshadowed
[1:02:59] him it says in another place but once
[1:03:02] adopted positionally placed in the body
[1:03:03] of Christ you're an heir of all things
[1:03:05] notice that's what God did to his son
[1:03:08] God didn't ask us to do anything that he
[1:03:10] would not do he took his own son who had
[1:03:12] been
[1:03:13] obedient and a voice said this is my
[1:03:16] beloved Son hear ye him whatever he says
[1:03:19] is just as good as my word he was
[1:03:21] adopted Jesus said all powers in Heaven
[1:03:24] and Earth is given into my hands there's
[1:03:26] the adoption of God adopting his
[1:03:29] son that's why we have Matthew
[1:03:32] 28:18 it's at that time he says all
[1:03:34] power is given un me in heaven and Earth
[1:03:36] but he says during his days on Earth and
[1:03:38] during his ministry I don't judge any
[1:03:40] man right I I I I I just come to save
[1:03:45] I'm not judging I I didn't come even he
[1:03:47] he even doesn't even read he opens up
[1:03:49] and he's going to read a verse that
[1:03:51] applies to him but not at that moment he
[1:03:53] stops reading
[1:03:54] it why CU he didn't want to get he
[1:03:56] didn't want there to be any
[1:03:58] confusion I I'm not going to give any
[1:04:00] pretense here I I I I'm going to stay
[1:04:03] right faithful to my
[1:04:05] calling brother brandham said in the
[1:04:07] position of the believer in Christ said
[1:04:09] this is my beloved Son hear ye him this
[1:04:11] is on Mount Transfiguration this is the
[1:04:13] climax this is at the peak this is a
[1:04:14] high mountain depart brother says
[1:04:16] fulfilling every law that the Old
[1:04:18] Testament
[1:04:19] required the law of inheritance required
[1:04:22] this character in the
[1:04:24] Sun and and God there and and this is I
[1:04:28] I think Lord will maybe we'll get to
[1:04:29] this on Sunday where is this law of
[1:04:32] adoption in the Old Testament anybody
[1:04:34] ever tried to find
[1:04:35] it anybody ever found
[1:04:38] it but it fulfilled every law in the Old
[1:04:42] Testament maybe I'll just uh create some
[1:04:44] anticipation for Wednesday we'll find it
[1:04:47] in the Old
[1:04:48] Testament Jesus Christ expressed the
[1:04:51] plan of perfection for all of God's
[1:04:53] children
[1:04:55] closing musicians you can come to your
[1:04:57] instruments this is God's perfect will
[1:05:00] to bring you from seed to
[1:05:03] Perfection we can look at scriptures
[1:05:05] where Christ is the
[1:05:06] root we can look at scriptures say we've
[1:05:08] begun in the spirit we can see that he's
[1:05:11] the author he's the beginner he's the
[1:05:13] foundation and this placing in the body
[1:05:16] of
[1:05:18] Christ this beginning in the spirit
[1:05:20] Christ being the foundation this is so
[1:05:22] for the body of Christ this is so
[1:05:24] through the church ages this is so in
[1:05:26] the history of the collective Body of
[1:05:28] Christ and it's also so for the
[1:05:31] individual as the Holy Spirit has built
[1:05:34] up his church and brother it's growed
[1:05:36] from the toes and the feet all the way
[1:05:37] up now to the intelligence the
[1:05:39] individual has done the same thing when
[1:05:42] you were born you were not born when you
[1:05:43] were born when you were figure that one
[1:05:46] out here's a
[1:05:47] riddle when you were born again I was
[1:05:50] going to say you weren't born a fully
[1:05:51] grown mature child of God the Bible says
[1:05:54] you're a babe but said you're not born
[1:05:56] men you're born babies you grow to
[1:05:58] adulthood you grow to manhood that's the
[1:06:00] seasoning out that's the maturing that's
[1:06:01] this process of character development
[1:06:03] this is how youngans are to grow
[1:06:07] up just as we are born in the natural
[1:06:10] when you're born in the natural you were
[1:06:12] not born a fully grown fully developed
[1:06:15] far as physical emotional and
[1:06:17] intellectual it's not fully developed
[1:06:18] but all the power and potentials there
[1:06:21] and just as one by seed by Nature they
[1:06:25] have
[1:06:26] potential and it is the nurturing of
[1:06:29] that seed that makes it come in the
[1:06:30] natural that makes it come to whatever
[1:06:32] it can be we know even the natural the
[1:06:35] kind of nurture that you give the seed
[1:06:37] can change the expression brother I'm
[1:06:39] talking about the corn stock something
[1:06:40] leans up against it it grows the wrong
[1:06:42] way still a corn still grew it just
[1:06:45] didn't grow up the right way and as we
[1:06:47] see those things in nature and we see
[1:06:49] that in our own lives as humans God
[1:06:51] that's all pattern what God is going to
[1:06:53] do for us as believers
[1:06:55] wants us to
[1:06:57] grow and Paul writes to the Galatians
[1:07:00] before he gets more into detail in
[1:07:01] Galatians chapter 4 he's setting
[1:07:04] up this this principle in chapter 3: 1
[1:07:08] to4 oh foolish Galatians who have
[1:07:10] Bewitched you that you should not obey
[1:07:12] the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ
[1:07:14] had been evidently set forth crucified
[1:07:16] among you there's a foolishness there's
[1:07:17] an immaturity right this isn't this
[1:07:20] isn't what I would expect from you he
[1:07:22] says it to the Hebrews he says it to the
[1:07:23] Corinthians this only would I learn of
[1:07:26] you this is what I want you to answer
[1:07:28] received ye the Spirit by The Works of
[1:07:30] the law or by the hearing of Faith what
[1:07:32] was it by hearing the word by faith are
[1:07:35] you so foolish having begun in the
[1:07:38] spirit are you now made perfect by the
[1:07:41] flesh now there's no way we take away
[1:07:43] from this to say oh so I don't need to
[1:07:45] be made perfectly said no having begun
[1:07:48] in the spirit and having begun in the
[1:07:50] spirit is the spirit that will perfect
[1:07:52] you don't go back to bondage again don't
[1:07:55] go back to the weak and beggarly
[1:07:56] elements of the flesh don't go back to
[1:07:58] religious tradition don't go back to the
[1:07:59] world don't go back to thinking whatever
[1:08:01] you do is going to make you perfect but
[1:08:04] the holy spirit that God gave you and
[1:08:06] you receive the Spirit by the hearing of
[1:08:08] the word then it's going to be by that
[1:08:11] that you are made
[1:08:13] perfect and then he says have you
[1:08:15] suffered so many things in vain if it be
[1:08:18] yet in vain now why does he mention the
[1:08:21] vanity of their suffering what is
[1:08:22] suffering for what is suffering the
[1:08:24] process of character development the
[1:08:27] holy spirit in you is to tutor you to
[1:08:29] teach you to guide you to cause you to
[1:08:30] grow up now I'll say this to us as
[1:08:32] individuals why is it so important to me
[1:08:34] as would it be important to you as a
[1:08:36] young man so that you can you can learn
[1:08:38] Integrity you can make the right
[1:08:39] decisions you can begin to be
[1:08:40] responsible because God wants you to
[1:08:42] bring a a a a woman a spouse into this
[1:08:44] relationship and then you begin to grow
[1:08:46] together and love together then you're
[1:08:48] going to have children if the Lord will
[1:08:49] T there's a process that he wants to
[1:08:51] unfold in your life so he's in you right
[1:08:53] now through teaching and and testing and
[1:08:56] and preserving and all sorts of and it's
[1:08:58] happening for all of
[1:08:59] us as Sons and Daughters of God in what
[1:09:03] we experience and what we go through
[1:09:05] he's saying would you are you going to
[1:09:06] suffer but then not inherit right Paul
[1:09:10] said I keep under my body less when I
[1:09:12] have benefited others and preached the
[1:09:13] gospel I would be a cast away I wouldn't
[1:09:15] receive my
[1:09:17] reward our conduct will keep us from a
[1:09:22] reward and just as you couldn't work
[1:09:24] your way into Faith could work your way
[1:09:26] into salvation I know I'm going to maybe
[1:09:28] someone might throw a tomato at me but
[1:09:30] you can't work your way out of it
[1:09:33] either I just say that's just how much
[1:09:35] he loves you that's just how much he
[1:09:37] loves you that's just how much he bought
[1:09:39] you that's just it's like he paid the
[1:09:41] price and the devil thinks oh I'll just
[1:09:43] make him do this and God says wait a
[1:09:45] minute read the fine print that was
[1:09:48] included that was included right all
[1:09:52] it's all included
[1:09:54] amen and so God then is committed to
[1:09:57] this process what he began he will
[1:10:00] finish and God is building up his
[1:10:02] Dwelling Place he's building up the
[1:10:04] house of the Lord which you are and
[1:10:07] there are no
[1:10:08] shortcuts there are no deals with the
[1:10:11] devil there is no Perfection by
[1:10:14] flesh it is by his
[1:10:17] word by the proper
[1:10:19] emphasis by the proper objective we
[1:10:22] should be prayed in our lives as
[1:10:24] Believers wherever we are that I want to
[1:10:25] be more
[1:10:27] obedient and that's a mark of growing up
[1:10:29] being obedient what was it Saul said oh
[1:10:32] sacrifice wasn't that
[1:10:34] great and Sam's like well God wants
[1:10:37] obedience that's what he's looking for
[1:10:40] as children we can become as youngans
[1:10:42] right we can become enamored with the
[1:10:43] flashy the Optics and and certain things
[1:10:46] and those things are fine but God wants
[1:10:48] obedience and if this is done at the
[1:10:50] expense of obedience God's saying no
[1:10:51] that's not it sorry that's not it so
[1:10:53] sometimes he ask us to do a hard thing
[1:10:55] just to see how you're going to
[1:10:58] act no shortcuts in this no deals with
[1:11:00] the devil no perfecting by flesh brother
[1:11:03] Bram says not theology run overs and
[1:11:07] overnights but God will place in the
[1:11:09] church as God has chosen as the Holy
[1:11:11] Ghost has tuted his church and raised it
[1:11:12] up and in there God will adopt into the
[1:11:15] position his sons they're already his
[1:11:18] sons but whether they're worthy of the
[1:11:20] position that he has for
[1:11:22] them if you'll notice in perfect type
[1:11:24] God did his own son the same
[1:11:30] way God spake out this is my beloved Son
[1:11:32] hear ye him God adopted his own child
[1:11:35] into the family hear me no longer but
[1:11:38] this is my son who takes over from here
[1:11:41] on he says the adoption is near the time
[1:11:44] in parable of the church it's time for
[1:11:47] that in Parable these things were done
[1:11:50] as an example he says in Parable we can
[1:11:53] look back and see by analogy or by
[1:11:54] allegory what God's done in the church
[1:11:56] ages what's God done in the Old
[1:11:57] Testament go what God did literally in
[1:11:59] Christ and he says now we can't say
[1:12:02] specifically that God's going to do to
[1:12:04] the church exactly specifically what he
[1:12:06] did to Jesus because that's one man it's
[1:12:09] one Lord that's the son that's Jesus
[1:12:14] Christ but he saying what God did to his
[1:12:16] son it's in Parable in type it's time
[1:12:19] for the church to come to the same place
[1:12:21] the time to fulfill all righteousness
[1:12:23] the time to fulfill the time of the
[1:12:24] consummation the kind time to satisfy
[1:12:26] the purpose amen that's the time that
[1:12:29] we're living in that's why Paul when he
[1:12:30] says about adoption he says to it the
[1:12:33] Redemption of the body because they
[1:12:35] realize in this process and in this
[1:12:37] unfolding there's more to it there's
[1:12:40] more to be enjoyed there's more to
[1:12:41] partake
[1:12:42] in and so this great example of Jesus
[1:12:45] Christ what we wanted you to see today
[1:12:46] is that Jesus Christ gives the pattern
[1:12:49] of God's desire for all his
[1:12:52] children and when we say to be like
[1:12:54] Jesus and I want to live like Jesus I
[1:12:57] Want to Love Like Jesus you got to
[1:12:58] realize that it's it's a it's a
[1:13:01] mouthful but I believe that Sons and
[1:13:04] Daughters of God are led by the spirit
[1:13:06] of God and if I can say this I know I've
[1:13:08] said it here before the worst thing you
[1:13:11] could take away from a son or daughter
[1:13:13] of God is the leadership of the holy
[1:13:15] spirit for God to lead them in all Truth
[1:13:18] for God to lead them into all
[1:13:20] righteousness for God to speak to them
[1:13:22] his will and they obey but when we try
[1:13:24] to come up with the rules and
[1:13:25] regulations and how it ought to be done
[1:13:27] and this is the way that it ought to
[1:13:28] look like and this is what you ought to
[1:13:29] do and listen to me and you take that
[1:13:31] away then you make them to feel like
[1:13:34] bastards CU you've alienated from the
[1:13:37] very thing that reminds them and bears
[1:13:39] witness with them that they are children
[1:13:42] of
[1:13:43] God God help us to be more in tune to
[1:13:46] the Holy
[1:13:46] Spirit let's stand together let's pray
[1:13:49] together this morning brother Michael if
[1:13:50] you could be ready
