[0:00] second timothy chapter three
[0:03] verses one to eight
[0:07] second timothy chapter three verses one
[0:08] to eight this know also that in the last
[0:11] days perilous times shall come
[0:14] for men shall be lovers of their own
[0:16] selves covetous boasters prowl
[0:19] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[0:23] that's kind of a tough one to follow
[0:24] those other few but somehow
[0:26] being disobedient to your parents
[0:28] follows up blasphemers i think i think
[0:30] that's good for all of our kids to take
[0:32] notice of this morning
[0:34] and then unthankful unholy without
[0:36] natural affection truce breakers false
[0:39] accusers incontinent fierce despisers of
[0:42] those that are good traitors heady
[0:45] high-minded lovers of pleasures more
[0:48] than lovers of god and then this
[0:50] statement here is very remarkable having
[0:52] a form of godliness
[0:54] but denying the power thereof from such
[0:57] turn away
[0:59] for of this sort are they which creep
[1:01] into houses the ones that really hold
[1:03] all these things in their hearts and
[1:05] second the second verse to the fourth
[1:07] verse but yet they have an influence he
[1:10] says they lead captive silly women
[1:13] laden with sins led away with diverse
[1:15] lust
[1:16] ever learning and never able to come to
[1:19] the knowledge of the truth now as janice
[1:22] and jamboree's withstood moses so do
[1:24] these also resist the truth
[1:26] men of corrupt minds reprobate
[1:29] concerning the faith
[1:31] god bless you you can be seated
[1:34] i'm taking
[1:36] my thought this morning is blind trust
[1:38] bad faith and we spoke on it a little
[1:41] bit wednesday night and
[1:43] i
[1:43] just couldn't i felt so incomplete
[1:46] having preached only half my thought
[1:48] that i just
[1:50] felt that i just for my own sake i felt
[1:52] that i should probably take this service
[1:54] this morning and continue on the subject
[1:57] but then i just felt like the lord
[1:59] really came behind it and impressed
[2:00] something on my heart so i trust that
[2:02] you'll be able to follow me
[2:04] and i will make a few comments in the
[2:05] outset just to kind of touch on some of
[2:07] the things that we were expressing
[2:08] wednesday night
[2:10] but in blind trust bad faith we're kind
[2:13] of refocusing our faith so that we're
[2:15] certain
[2:16] that our faith is resting in the word
[2:18] alone that we haven't taken other things
[2:21] and kind of put it in the picture and
[2:23] it's kind of faith plus because that's
[2:24] not how it works uh we go by faith and
[2:27] we go by faith alone and so we're we're
[2:30] what we should be certain of is that
[2:31] we're trusting in the word that has been
[2:33] revealed to us
[2:34] and it's a word that's been confirmed to
[2:36] us we could be raised uh in it with
[2:39] under a particular truth and we hear
[2:41] certain things taught in it we don't
[2:42] disagree with it and we make it makes
[2:44] sense to us and we see it lived before
[2:46] so we accept it uh that it that it's
[2:49] beneficial and that has power but to to
[2:52] have faith in the word of god means
[2:54] there's some confirmation that drops
[2:56] down into your heart where you're just
[2:57] not following up in your parents
[2:59] footsteps believing what they believe
[3:01] but rather it's something that's been
[3:02] revealed personally to you
[3:04] and so in that there's this that's kind
[3:07] of what the desire is is that our faith
[3:09] could be very focused on the word of god
[3:12] but in the terminologies blind trust bad
[3:14] faith to have blind trust means you
[3:17] trust without any reason i want you to
[3:19] ponder this blind trust i'm not using
[3:22] the phrase blind faith because i think
[3:24] that kind of is a little bit confusing
[3:26] or could be a little bit misleading
[3:28] but blind trust it means you trust
[3:30] something without really having a reason
[3:32] to do it or it's believing something
[3:34] without a basis for believing or without
[3:36] an understanding really of what it is
[3:38] you believe and then bad faith would be
[3:41] the refusal to acknowledge a certain
[3:43] truth or refusal to acknowledge certain
[3:45] facts
[3:46] and in having that kind of bad faith
[3:48] where you don't want to believe
[3:49] something or you just refuse to
[3:51] acknowledge or take into consideration
[3:53] it could be a lack of honesty where
[3:54] someone is just intentionally being
[3:57] deceitful and intentionally does not
[3:58] want to acknowledge truth or there could
[4:00] be some level of the self-deception and
[4:02] because someone's been deceived and
[4:04] they're believing a lie
[4:06] they act in a way which is kind of in
[4:08] bad faith because it's not based upon
[4:10] truth
[4:11] and so the reason why i wouldn't want to
[4:13] use the phrase blind faith and i'm real
[4:15] rather calling it blind trust bad faith
[4:18] is our faith is not blind
[4:20] and our faith is not blind trust and if
[4:23] our faith is a blind trust where you
[4:26] really don't have a basis for believing
[4:27] or really any foundation for believing
[4:30] then your testimony is in bad faith
[4:33] if you're not really convinced of
[4:35] something if you're not really certain
[4:36] that it's true if it hasn't been
[4:38] disclosed to you it made known to you in
[4:40] such a way you're like i know this is
[4:41] the truth i know this is real and then
[4:44] kind of having that anchor in your soul
[4:46] and that's the that's from where you're
[4:47] testifying and i know this is true i
[4:49] know this is sure and you witness from
[4:51] that basis that that's a testimony in
[4:53] good faith but if you're not certain of
[4:55] it and you're not sure and you and you
[4:57] don't know that's uh there's some level
[4:59] and you're saying something well i know
[5:01] this is good for you and inside your
[5:02] heart going i don't really know if this
[5:04] is good that would be testifying in bad
[5:06] faith and so we want our testimony to be
[5:08] in good faith in order that we can be
[5:11] true witnesses
[5:12] we've got to be true witnesses in this
[5:14] hour and being a true witness is part of
[5:16] our calling in this last day to be
[5:18] the final voice to the final age
[5:21] if you don't have a voice there is no
[5:23] voice and so you are the final voice to
[5:25] the final age
[5:27] and there was a statement where brother
[5:29] branham
[5:30] references supreme faith and i didn't uh
[5:33] take this uh statement down
[5:36] um i didn't write down where i'd gotten
[5:37] it from uh now that i realized
[5:39] i'd like to quote more of it but he's
[5:41] referring to supreme faith
[5:43] and he says you cannot have that faith
[5:45] talk about supreme faith that would be
[5:47] the ultimate faith we could even say in
[5:49] some ways maybe it's a perfect faith you
[5:51] cannot have that faith until you know
[5:54] perfectly what you're doing
[5:56] so think about that you cannot have
[5:58] supreme faith you cannot have a perfect
[6:01] faith until you know perfectly what
[6:04] you're doing
[6:05] that kind of shifts things around a
[6:06] little bit because there's some there's
[6:08] things in the back of our minds where we
[6:10] say well you don't have to understand it
[6:12] just believe it that's true
[6:14] but that would be the beginning that god
[6:16] is the author of our faith well he's
[6:18] also the finisher or the perfecter of
[6:20] our faith so we have a genesis of our
[6:21] faith we have a faith that begins but
[6:23] then there's a faith we know that ought
[6:24] to grow into perfect faith or be loosed
[6:27] and let loose to be perfect faith and
[6:29] he's saying supreme faith to have
[6:31] supreme faith you have to know perfectly
[6:33] what you're doing so there's a knowledge
[6:35] attached with our faith that gives us
[6:37] this confidence and makes it very robust
[6:39] and makes it strong to go forward
[6:42] we made this uh we were
[6:44] this was just kind of sharing what was
[6:46] in my heart on wednesday night
[6:48] there's something so pure about the
[6:50] faith there's only one truth one lord
[6:53] one faith one baptism there's only one
[6:55] gospel there's so there's something so
[6:57] pure about that something so pure about
[6:59] the truth something so pure about the
[7:01] gospel it's not facts it's not data it's
[7:04] not science it's not just a discipline
[7:06] it's not just a way to live our lives
[7:08] and well this is a paradigm for me and
[7:10] my family and this works for us and if
[7:12] that works for you that's great there's
[7:14] something so pure and precious about
[7:16] being able to take god at his word
[7:18] there's something so wonderful about
[7:20] just being able to believe what he says
[7:22] isn't it wonderful to be able to to read
[7:25] the bible and know that no matter what
[7:27] what's written there that there's some
[7:28] truth in it there's some power behind
[7:30] him it's wonderful to know that we can
[7:32] just take god at his word and trust him
[7:34] absolutely
[7:36] and that
[7:37] that faith is so precious we should
[7:39] guard it
[7:41] oh it's this this attitude that i
[7:42] believe god whatever he says i trust him
[7:45] i i trust his word completely whatever
[7:47] god says is true whatever god does is
[7:50] just that that is an instinct and that
[7:52] is a precious gift that is so pure we
[7:54] ought to guard it with our hearts and
[7:57] that kind of faith and that kind of
[7:59] trust should never be misplaced
[8:02] this kind of instinct where you just
[8:04] trust god absolutely whatever he says i
[8:06] just believe it i trust it to have that
[8:08] kind of instinct and that kind of
[8:09] ability within our hearts we should
[8:11] never take that kind of trust and
[8:13] misplace it on anything else
[8:15] i hope you understand what i what i mean
[8:17] by that that we we have this faith that
[8:19] ought to be in truth alone and then we
[8:21] can kind of take that instinct to just
[8:23] believe everything and trust everything
[8:25] and be very trusting and very uh
[8:27] accepting and receiving we there's a
[8:29] there's a healthy suspicion that we
[8:31] ought to have for anyone else who's not
[8:32] divine right
[8:35] there's a statement i believe that i
[8:36] heard from an engineer i believe it
[8:38] might have been your dad brother loyal
[8:39] who has said he had a sticker at his uh
[8:41] in his office that said in god we trust
[8:44] everyone else bring data
[8:46] and uh i've held onto that for 18 years
[8:49] or however long it was since i first
[8:50] heard him say i was like amen to that i
[8:52] believe it
[8:53] and so that's that's how that we ought
[8:54] to be in god we trust everybody else
[8:57] better have something some proof
[8:59] and if you're gonna come contradicting
[9:01] god you're gonna come contradicting his
[9:03] word uh then then you better not just be
[9:05] saying something
[9:07] because we trust god anyone else who
[9:08] wants me to believe something's got to
[9:10] have something to back it up and if it's
[9:12] contrary to the word we reject it
[9:14] because god we trust in god
[9:16] so there's
[9:18] this is
[9:19] that's what i mean by that faith should
[9:21] never be misplaced
[9:23] because our belief and i want to expand
[9:25] upon this this morning
[9:27] our belief as christians has a basis
[9:31] our our faith as believers we have a
[9:34] reason that might seem a little bit
[9:35] contrary
[9:36] to some of the things we know in our
[9:38] hearts that you know faith doesn't
[9:39] reason but there's going to come to a
[9:41] little bit different perspective on that
[9:43] here in a minute but our belief our
[9:45] faith has a reason
[9:47] we could even say this that god has
[9:49] created in us faith to believe his word
[9:52] so the faith that we have we say god has
[9:54] created in me this faith to believe his
[9:57] word that that's the reason why i
[9:59] believe and when someone says well i
[10:00] just can't believe it
[10:02] we don't want to try to force it into
[10:04] him and say well let me put it in you
[10:05] and let me create in you of faith you
[10:07] say well then you realize the grace that
[10:09] god gave you to be able to believe his
[10:11] word because it's a supernatural
[10:13] creation where god creates in you the
[10:16] faith to believe his word
[10:19] and then this faith that he's created in
[10:20] us cannot be separated from the
[10:22] knowledge of the truth
[10:24] so there's a truth that exists there's
[10:26] one absolute there's one truth and then
[10:28] our faith is going to bring us into a
[10:30] knowledge of the truth so faith and
[10:32] truth are connected together
[10:35] could you could you say it and it makes
[10:36] sense say i have faith in a lion
[10:39] that would be double think that wouldn't
[10:41] make a lot of sense and so faith has to
[10:43] be connected with truth faith is
[10:44] connected with the revelation of god's
[10:46] word and if it's a revelation of god's
[10:48] word it's something positive
[10:50] it's a revelation of god's word it's
[10:52] something very real
[10:54] and so this is kind of where i think i
[10:56] left off on wednesday night
[10:59] is that with that kind of positive faith
[11:02] in that kind of uh that's where our
[11:04] faith should be oriented if we
[11:06] misunderstand faith if we kind of take
[11:09] faith and we don't really understand
[11:10] what it means then we can be easily
[11:12] tossed about you can say well i'm a
[11:14] believer i've got to believe then
[11:16] someone tells you one thing like well
[11:18] i'm a believer i've got to believe
[11:20] i'm a christian i need to be a christian
[11:22] and you start hearing these different
[11:23] voices and you can find yourself getting
[11:25] tossed about because you don't
[11:26] understand what your faith anchors in
[11:29] if you look in ephesians chapter 4
[11:31] verses 13 to 15.
[11:36] does it sound like i'm in a box to you
[11:39] because i kind of am i'm in a
[11:40] three-sided box here and so i need to i
[11:42] need it you might need to a-man a little
[11:44] bit louder to kind of get it past the
[11:45] fourth wall here
[11:47] where i am up on this on this on the
[11:48] platform and i do appreciate your amens
[11:51] and your encouragement this morning in
[11:53] ephesians chapter four we know in verse
[11:55] 12 it lays out what we call the
[11:57] five-fold ministry it's five different
[11:59] ministering gifts that have been given
[12:01] to some but for the benefit of all as it
[12:03] says till we all come there's verses 13
[12:06] to 15 till we all come in the unity of
[12:09] the faith
[12:11] this is something that when you read in
[12:12] the uh in the new testament they were
[12:14] calling it v faith the gospel something
[12:16] very precious something very peculiar
[12:19] and unique to the saints till we all
[12:20] come into the unity of the faith and of
[12:23] the knowledge of the son of god so the
[12:25] unity of the faith is not apart from
[12:27] knowledge so we come into the knowledge
[12:29] of the son of god unto a perfect man
[12:32] under the measure of the stature of the
[12:34] fullness of christ brother brethren
[12:35] takes that and summarizes it as the
[12:37] stature of a perfect man
[12:39] and this is kind of the outcome now of
[12:42] this working
[12:44] of unity of the faith and knowledge of
[12:45] the son of god that we henceforth be no
[12:48] more children
[12:49] tossed to and fro so think about the
[12:53] object of the preaching of the word of
[12:55] god the object of my faith becoming
[12:57] stronger and all of us to come into the
[12:59] unity of the faith to come into this
[13:01] this the knowledge of the son of god and
[13:03] unto us the stature of a perfect man
[13:05] he's saying that this is going to
[13:07] stabilize you even as faith begins and
[13:09] there's a genesis of faith in your heart
[13:11] paul is saying that god is giving gifts
[13:13] to the church to preach the word of god
[13:15] and in preaching the word of god we're
[13:17] no more children but we grow up we begin
[13:20] to mature and in our maturing faith
[13:22] we're not easily swayed one direction or
[13:24] the other
[13:25] we're not just driven like chaff in the
[13:27] wind and that we kind of hold our
[13:28] position he says carried about with
[13:31] every wind of doctrine
[13:33] the preaching of the word is destabilize
[13:35] us in the truth that every wind of
[13:37] doctrine doesn't kind of blow us left of
[13:39] center and say well i believe this this
[13:40] day and i believe this that day and we
[13:42] kind of get moved around a little bit
[13:44] and then this is to me i think this is
[13:46] uh uh going to touch on where we're
[13:49] wanting to go in galatians and jude and
[13:51] colossians here in a moment even
[13:52] corinthians where it says by the slight
[13:55] of men
[13:57] with that the sleight of men just a
[13:59] little bit of deception a little bit of
[14:01] trickery
[14:02] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[14:05] and wait to deceive
[14:07] this is the reality of our our belief is
[14:10] that we're not living in an innocent
[14:12] world we're not even we're not
[14:13] surrounded by people
[14:14] who have strong convictions and are just
[14:16] merely holding to their convictions and
[14:19] and doing what they believe is right but
[14:20] there's actually a deception in people's
[14:22] hearts to where they're going to
[14:23] intentionally try to trick you
[14:26] there's deception in the land where
[14:27] people will take facts or they'll take
[14:28] statistics or they'll take principles
[14:30] and rules they'll take scriptures
[14:32] they'll take quotations and they'll take
[14:34] a lot of different things and they'll
[14:35] kind of use sleight of hand to trick you
[14:38] to make you think you're seeing
[14:39] something they'll use a cunning
[14:40] craftiness but they're doing it to
[14:42] deceive and that exists and so paul is
[14:45] saying that the word is preached in
[14:47] sincerity that we would become
[14:49] stabilized and come into the knowledge
[14:51] of the son of god and the unity of the
[14:52] faith that those kind of tricks and that
[14:54] kind of craftiness does not cause us to
[14:56] stumble
[14:58] in this verse but speaking the truth in
[15:00] love this is the responsibility of any
[15:02] god called man to speak the truth in
[15:04] love the speaking of the truth and love
[15:06] to the believer we grow up into him
[15:08] which is christ in all things which is
[15:10] the head even christ
[15:13] notice what's going to bring us into the
[15:15] unity of the faith and the knowledge of
[15:17] the son of god it's the speaking of the
[15:19] truth so it has to be this dynamic of
[15:21] the word being preached energizing our
[15:23] faith causing it to grow stronger and
[15:25] stronger and this is going to inoculate
[15:27] us again stabilize us get our roots down
[15:29] to where we're not carried about by
[15:31] every wind of doctrine slight of men and
[15:33] cunning craftiness
[15:35] and this is why we have to really as
[15:37] brothers say supreme faith is knowing
[15:39] perfectly what you're doing
[15:40] we need to have this kind of this kind
[15:42] of supreme faith so we're not moved
[15:45] and then also having the wrong concept
[15:47] of faith if we kind of take it if we
[15:50] don't understand what it is
[15:52] it can make us susceptible to this
[15:54] deceit or the sleight of men of this
[15:56] cunning craftiness are susceptible to
[15:58] gullibility paul even talks about in in
[16:00] the in corinthians
[16:03] in second corinthians chapter 11 verses
[16:05] three and four
[16:06] he says but i fear lest by any means
[16:10] as the serpent beguiled eve through his
[16:12] subtlety
[16:13] so your mind should be corrupted from
[16:15] the simplicity that is in christ there
[16:19] is a simplicity in christ that the world
[16:22] would want to
[16:24] confuse and corrupt and defile and he
[16:27] expresses a fear which is very unique
[16:28] for the prophet to be fearing of the
[16:30] people but he says just as eve was
[16:33] beguiled through subtlety
[16:35] through trickery through deceit through
[16:37] slight he says i i fear that your minds
[16:40] also could be corrupted
[16:42] you'd fall for something
[16:44] and and this is how he amplifies it
[16:46] for if he that cometh preacheth another
[16:48] jesus whom we have not preached
[16:51] or if you receive another spirit
[16:53] which you have not received or another
[16:55] gospel which ye have not accepted you
[16:58] might well bear with them
[17:02] and if you the language that paul is
[17:03] using is he's saying you seem so
[17:05] gullible
[17:06] you're just accepting anything that
[17:08] someone comes along and says to you you
[17:09] just believe any story you believe any
[17:11] report you're just kind of believing
[17:13] things without really checking it with
[17:15] the word of god and examining the spirit
[17:17] of it he's saying that you might well
[17:18] bear with them in other words you seem
[17:20] to be gullible that you just believe
[17:22] anything anyone will tell you even if
[17:24] it's different than what you've been
[17:26] told before
[17:28] i said take the word that has been
[17:30] preached to you take that gospel that we
[17:32] have been sent take the gospel that has
[17:34] been preached and identify and recognize
[17:37] the spirit behind it and if anyone
[17:39] preaches something contrary to that
[17:41] gospel you ought not to receive it if
[17:43] something comes in another spirit
[17:45] contrary than the spirit that the
[17:46] message was given in then you shouldn't
[17:48] receive it
[17:51] john says in first john chapter 4 verse
[17:54] 1
[17:54] beloved believe not every spirit
[17:57] otherwise don't be gullible
[17:59] believe not every spirit but try the
[18:02] spirits
[18:03] whether they are of god
[18:04] because many false prophets are gone out
[18:07] into the world
[18:08] believe not every spirit but try the
[18:11] spirits test them give them a word test
[18:13] be discerning about them recognize
[18:16] whether or not these spirits are of god
[18:18] because there are false prophets that
[18:19] have gone out into the world they use
[18:21] slight they use cunning craftiness
[18:23] they're lying in wait to deceive so we
[18:25] want to be tuned in to those or to the
[18:28] voice that is speaking the truth and
[18:29] love that it stabilizes us
[18:33] it says believe not every spirit
[18:36] just as paul is saying to the
[18:37] corinthians man you guys seem pretty
[18:39] gullible
[18:40] you seem like if somebody came and told
[18:42] you a story you would just be willing to
[18:44] eat it up and accept it even if it was
[18:46] contrary to what i've already tried to
[18:47] share with you so he's saying don't be
[18:49] gullible
[18:50] the kind of faith that the the gentiles
[18:52] were being
[18:53] converted into
[18:56] he's recognizing there might be some
[18:57] level to where before you just kind of
[18:59] worship whatever was convenient you
[19:00] worship things would that would never
[19:02] speak back and you worship things that
[19:04] could never confirm themselves and now
[19:06] that you're being rooted and grounded in
[19:07] something very different a faith that
[19:09] was ascribed to the jews alone now that
[19:11] you're coming to this faith and you're
[19:13] coming to believe the word of god and
[19:15] even for a jew this great transition
[19:17] into the revealed word of god and the
[19:19] fulfillment of prophecy he said there's
[19:21] something very precious about that faith
[19:23] and don't become gullible
[19:26] don't be easily deceived
[19:29] galatians chapter 1 verses 6 to 9
[19:33] he says i marvel that ye are so soon
[19:36] removed and this is certainly implying
[19:39] that they had in fact been removed i
[19:41] marvel that you are so soon removed for
[19:43] him that called you
[19:45] into the grace of christ unto another
[19:48] gospel
[19:49] and i like just how quickly he says
[19:50] which is not another knows there is not
[19:52] another gospel the gospel being the good
[19:54] news and the gospel being the good news
[19:57] of jesus christ he's saying there can't
[19:59] be another good news if it's not the
[20:00] good news it's fake news
[20:02] right he said there's only one good news
[20:04] there's only one gospel so he says
[20:06] they're trying to call you into another
[20:08] gospel but there can't be another gospel
[20:09] there can't be another christ there
[20:11] can't be another truth
[20:12] he says but there be some that trouble
[20:15] you and would pervert the gospel of
[20:17] christ
[20:18] not outright reject it but just pervert
[20:21] it just change it just be very subtle
[20:23] just the slight of men the cunning
[20:24] craftiness so he says there'd be some
[20:26] that would pervert the gospel of christ
[20:28] and this profound statement though we or
[20:30] an angel from heaven
[20:32] preach any other gospel unto you than
[20:35] that which we have preached unto you let
[20:37] him be a curse it's a very very bold
[20:40] statement on paul's part to say that
[20:42] even if an angel from heaven preached
[20:44] something different than i preached to
[20:45] you then that angel should be cursed
[20:48] i'm glad it was written in our bible
[20:50] because i think there's still a lot of
[20:51] bible people that really couldn't even
[20:53] accept that because that's this is
[20:55] exactly what paul is saying i'm a
[20:57] messenger to you i've preached the truth
[20:59] is given to me from god even if an angel
[21:01] from heaven came down and preached
[21:02] something different then you could be
[21:04] falling for a lion
[21:07] as we said before so say i now again if
[21:09] any man preach any other gospel unto you
[21:13] then that you have received let him be
[21:15] accursed
[21:16] paul is drawing from
[21:19] a literal experience where the word of
[21:22] god had been preached to the galatians
[21:24] the word of god preached the galatians
[21:26] excites the faith inside of them and
[21:28] there's something to be established in
[21:29] their hearts he says you began you began
[21:32] in faith and you started in faith as he
[21:34] even tells them in this letter uh and
[21:36] having begun in the faith and having
[21:38] begun in the spirit now do you think
[21:39] you're made perfect by the flesh
[21:42] so the word preached to them excited a
[21:44] real genuine faith and this faith is
[21:46] anchoring in their hearts and it and
[21:47] it's it says that it's a gospel that
[21:49] they received if they truly received it
[21:51] it would not been by intellect
[21:54] but something in their heart but now
[21:56] forces come and start dealing with them
[21:58] in the mind and according to human
[22:00] rationalizing and things in their
[22:01] spirits and he said you're being removed
[22:04] from the the dynamics of the word
[22:06] preached exciting your faith into fables
[22:09] and stories and he says this in this
[22:10] other gospel that troubles you and
[22:13] perverts the gospel of jesus christ
[22:17] and this is happening in our new
[22:18] testament
[22:20] this is happening in the churches it's
[22:21] just being uh the foundation is being
[22:23] laid and it's it's being birthed
[22:26] in the book of jude verses three and
[22:28] four
[22:29] he says beloved when i gave all
[22:30] diligence to write unto you of
[22:32] the common salvation
[22:35] now think of that as he expresses that
[22:37] the common salvation this is something
[22:39] that would be unique to the elect this
[22:41] is something that would be very precious
[22:43] to the elect as he says in verse 20 but
[22:45] ye beloved built building yourselves on
[22:48] your most holy faith
[22:51] so this is the the common salvation the
[22:53] faith of god's elect he says i wrote i
[22:55] gave all diligence to write unto you
[22:57] about the common salvation
[22:58] he says it was needful for me to write
[23:01] unto you
[23:02] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[23:04] contend for the
[23:06] faith there it is again the faith the
[23:09] one truth the one absolute the faith
[23:12] which was once delivered unto the saints
[23:14] something given something received
[23:17] it says for there are certain men crept
[23:19] in unawares
[23:20] who were before of old ordained to this
[23:23] condemnation
[23:24] ungodly men
[23:26] turning the grace of our god into
[23:28] lasciviousness
[23:29] and denying the only lord god and our
[23:32] lord jesus christ
[23:35] so if notice these these principles
[23:38] there is the faith that he's saying you
[23:40] ought to contend for
[23:42] and this contending for this standing
[23:44] for this holding to it being built up in
[23:46] the most holy faith is even more
[23:48] necessary because there's certain men
[23:50] who creep in
[23:51] he says who are ordained to condemnation
[23:54] but they come in and they're trying to
[23:56] turn grace into lasciviousness
[23:59] they may even be preaching jesus christ
[24:02] but changing the gospel they're denying
[24:04] jesus christ
[24:05] trying to draw them back into jewish
[24:07] traditions trying to draw them back into
[24:09] humanism so he's saying listen you you
[24:12] that have received the truth and know
[24:14] the truth you have to remain steadfast
[24:16] in the faith and your faith has to be
[24:18] centered on the word of god because
[24:20] there's situations and circumstances and
[24:23] things that can begin to enter into the
[24:24] picture and it's all for the purpose of
[24:27] distracting you and drawing you away
[24:29] from the faith he's saying these things
[24:31] are very very subtle but they're very
[24:33] powerful
[24:35] and he wants to put them in these terms
[24:36] that doesn't kind of just pat him on the
[24:38] back and say well they believe the truth
[24:40] but not all the truth but he's saying
[24:42] they deny the only lord god
[24:44] and they deny our lord jesus christ
[24:48] colossians chapter 2 verses 6 to 8
[24:55] he says as you have therefore received
[24:57] christ jesus the lord
[24:59] so walk ye in him
[25:02] rooted and built up in him this is the
[25:05] maturity of our faith this is going from
[25:07] faith to supreme faith
[25:09] this is faith being perfected this is
[25:11] the outworking of that gene seed that is
[25:14] quickened to life by the new birth is
[25:15] you have therefore received christ jesus
[25:17] the lord so walk ye in him this is
[25:20] progress this is forward moving
[25:23] rooted and built up in him
[25:27] so rooted in him built up in him
[25:29] established in the faith
[25:32] so there's an establishment in the faith
[25:34] the faith that you've received it
[25:36] becomes established it's made firm as
[25:38] you have been taught there's the dynamic
[25:41] again the word is taught the word is
[25:42] received it is established it grows
[25:46] you receive christ jesus you walk in him
[25:49] you're rooted and built up in him you're
[25:51] established in the faith you've been
[25:52] taught the word of god you're becoming
[25:54] established in the faith abounding
[25:56] therein with thanksgiving and again here
[25:58] comes this warning
[26:00] we've read it in corinthians and in
[26:01] first john and galatians and jude
[26:04] and peter deals with it and we find it
[26:06] re all through the the new testament
[26:08] here comes a warning again beware lest
[26:10] any men spoil you
[26:12] through philosophy in vain deceit
[26:16] so these are the elements of of of
[26:18] spoiling philosophy vain deceit after
[26:22] the tradition of men
[26:23] after the rudiments of the world
[26:26] someone would
[26:27] then they're not going to present and
[26:28] say hey take this it's going to spoil
[26:30] you or take this it's going to spoil
[26:31] your faith take this it's going to spoil
[26:33] your experience
[26:35] but yet it they present it as something
[26:37] that's edifying and something beneficial
[26:39] and something that's going to strengthen
[26:40] you i said beware because there's people
[26:43] trying to spoil your faith through
[26:44] philosophy vain deceit tradition of men
[26:46] and rudiments of the world and not after
[26:49] christ
[26:50] now it would seem obvious to us that if
[26:52] it's going to spoil us then it wouldn't
[26:54] be after christ
[26:56] but it's something that comes in the
[26:58] guise of christianity it's something
[27:00] that comes kind of with the voice oh
[27:02] that seems right that's it sounds like
[27:04] the shepherd but the sheep know the
[27:06] shepherd's voice and another they'll not
[27:08] follow because they're in the word to
[27:10] know the word and if something seems
[27:12] close but it's not quite the word they
[27:14] say you're promising a lot by that but i
[27:16] know that the in the end that's going to
[27:18] spoil my faith
[27:20] and maybe it doesn't become rotten to
[27:22] the core where you're just going to walk
[27:23] away from truth and walk away from the
[27:25] message but it it takes your focus on
[27:27] something else
[27:29] philosophy
[27:30] vain deceit
[27:32] tradition of men rudiments of the world
[27:36] our faith becomes spoiled off-centered
[27:38] focused on these other things and not on
[27:40] christ
[27:42] so do you recognize a pattern
[27:46] i i feel like i'm all alone up here for
[27:48] some reason i don't know what it is like
[27:50] there's the camera i'm just gonna preach
[27:52] this car this choir mic here
[27:54] congregational mic can preach to the
[27:55] camera
[27:56] and uh if if you want to say amen i've
[27:58] got my phone here for the clock and
[28:00] maybe i'll get the text messages
[28:02] as you say amen i have it on do not
[28:04] disturb i wouldn't get them anyway
[28:07] and i guess i just feel like there's a
[28:09] lot of distance between us today i
[28:11] apologize for maybe being a little
[28:12] uncomfortable
[28:13] if it's shown in my preaching i double
[28:15] apologize
[28:17] so as paul is saying don't let your
[28:18] faith be spoiled
[28:21] this is this is this is an admonition to
[28:23] the people
[28:24] don't mix your faith with something else
[28:28] keep your faith pure
[28:30] don't mix the gospel so if we have if we
[28:33] have a faith and i i wish there was some
[28:35] way if i was an artist maybe i try to
[28:37] draw it up and use some sort of
[28:39] expressions that had i known we'd have
[28:40] an overhead tonight today i'm not going
[28:42] to preach into the night but if i knew
[28:44] it i had an overhead i would have i
[28:46] would have given you the scriptures and
[28:47] maybe i could have used a graphic to
[28:49] express this we have the gospel which is
[28:52] true and pure
[28:54] whether you believe it or not
[28:56] it's the truth right god is god even if
[28:58] you deny him you can be an agnostic it
[29:00] doesn't change the character of god you
[29:01] can be an atheist doesn't change the
[29:03] character of god you can deny him he's
[29:05] still real
[29:06] and and that reality is going to impose
[29:08] itself on you one day now how much you
[29:10] want to deny it and so there's a there
[29:13] is a god that we believe in and then
[29:14] this gospel is representative of christ
[29:17] and this is the gospel the good news of
[29:19] jesus christ
[29:20] so then we have a faith a god-given
[29:23] faith and he's created in us the ability
[29:26] to believe that gospel that gospel ought
[29:28] to remain pure
[29:30] because if our faith is projected
[29:32] towards it and we're believing in the
[29:33] gospel
[29:34] i'm sharing this as i've read through
[29:35] these scriptures this is what starts
[29:37] this picture that starts building in my
[29:38] heart i've got a faith that's to that
[29:41] gospel
[29:42] because that gospels created this faith
[29:44] i was taught i received i heard faith
[29:47] has been excited now i have this faith
[29:49] that's kind of being reciprocated back
[29:51] towards the gospel now is that faith is
[29:53] being projected towards that gospel i
[29:55] don't want to mix anything in that
[29:56] gospel
[29:57] because now i've got this absolute trust
[30:00] and assurance on this word and i'm
[30:02] believing in this word but then all of a
[30:04] sudden philosophy starts entering into
[30:06] it
[30:07] and the rudiments of the world start
[30:09] entering into it vanity starts in
[30:12] trinidad pretense politics personality
[30:14] all these other things start entering
[30:16] into the picture but then i'm trying to
[30:17] keep this faith
[30:19] absolutely centered on the gospel while
[30:21] you just have to believe it and you just
[30:22] have to accept it and it doesn't matter
[30:24] if it doesn't do this and it doesn't
[30:25] matter if it doesn't do that and part of
[30:27] you saying well i don't know the gospel
[30:29] seemed to have said this but now this
[30:31] person's saying that i can't make sense
[30:32] of it it's as these things kind of get
[30:34] convoluted and mixed into the gospel
[30:36] that our faith gets spoiled
[30:40] and so we have to be careful that we
[30:41] don't mix the gospel with other things
[30:43] so that our faith is mixing with the
[30:44] wrong thing
[30:46] because remember our advocacy is for
[30:48] christ
[30:49] our voice is for christ it's not for
[30:51] politics for politicians it's not for
[30:53] personalities it's not for ourselves
[30:55] where it's you know my the pretense of
[30:58] how i look and what others think about
[30:59] me as a born-again believer as the final
[31:02] voice to the final age i have a duty to
[31:04] advocate for christ and as being an
[31:07] advocate for christ i examine my life i
[31:09] look at the things i support i look at
[31:11] the things i say and the things i do and
[31:13] i ask myself is the way i'm living
[31:15] making me the best advocate for what i
[31:18] believe to be the only escape from
[31:20] tribulation
[31:22] does my life is it representative of one
[31:25] who's convinced that i believe in the
[31:28] only way to escape the second death
[31:34] to be certain of that escape to bypass
[31:36] tribulation in hell
[31:39] so that we have to be sure there's not
[31:41] humanism that's mixed in
[31:43] to our faith
[31:48] as paul wrote in hebrews chapter four
[31:50] verse two for unto us was the gospel
[31:51] preached as well as unto them
[31:53] but the word preached did not profit
[31:55] them
[31:57] now why why did the word preach word and
[31:59] its purity not profit them not being
[32:02] mixed with faith in them that hurt it
[32:05] there's got to be this mixture of faith
[32:07] and truth
[32:08] this is where we get the prophet this is
[32:10] where we get the benefit from it and so
[32:12] if our if the word is preached our faith
[32:15] must be mixed with the word that brings
[32:17] prophet but our faith mixed with some
[32:19] myth truth isn't going to bring you
[32:20] profit and the word preached unmixed
[32:23] with faith is not going to bring you
[32:24] benefit
[32:27] think about these principles as jesus
[32:29] said in mark chapter 7 verse 14 making
[32:32] the word of god this is what they did
[32:33] they made the word of god of none effect
[32:36] through your tradition which you have
[32:38] delivered and many such light things do
[32:40] ye
[32:41] the word of god is pure amen
[32:43] the word of god is powerful the word of
[32:45] god is perfect it is it is righteous and
[32:48] true and whole
[32:49] and in it is is life and vitality but
[32:52] yet you can make it of none
[32:54] effect you can build traditions you can
[32:57] build ideologies you can build manmade
[32:59] ideas uh and and join it and mix it with
[33:03] the truth and it makes it of none effect
[33:05] beware lest any man spoil your faith
[33:08] through philosophy vain deceit tradition
[33:10] of men or rudiments of the world and
[33:12] that's what happened the word of god was
[33:14] ineffective and did not profit them
[33:16] because they'd mix their traditions with
[33:18] it
[33:21] now if you look at second timothy
[33:22] chapter 3 i'd like to begin with verse 5
[33:25] instead of reading
[33:27] all of the
[33:28] verses
[33:34] it says
[33:35] that these who are of this sort
[33:39] the first four verses of this it says
[33:41] have been a form of godliness but
[33:43] denying the power thereof brother brown
[33:45] called the power of revelation
[33:48] they deny the power of revelation the
[33:50] power of transformation so they have a
[33:52] form of garnish there may seem to be a
[33:54] semblance or some form and it having a
[33:56] form maybe initially what the image that
[33:58] strikes your eye is oh that seems godly
[34:02] but yet inside they lack the power of
[34:05] revelation
[34:06] and this is
[34:08] this is where this hits home he says
[34:10] from such turn away
[34:12] so i need to know what to turn away from
[34:15] something that may appear to be godly
[34:17] appear to have a form of godliness but
[34:20] yet if it denies the power of revelation
[34:22] if it denies the power of transformation
[34:25] i've got to turn away from it
[34:26] then again this follows in line with
[34:29] those that preach another jesus and try
[34:31] every spirit in the slight of men and
[34:34] and beware thus they spoil you and those
[34:36] that would pervert the gospel and men
[34:38] that have crept in unawares he says for
[34:40] this order they which creep into houses
[34:43] and lead captive silly women so it calls
[34:46] them silly women they're not
[34:47] understanding they're gullible
[34:50] and they capitalize on their guilt
[34:52] because he says they're laden with sins
[34:54] so it may be really easy for us to just
[34:56] get together at lunch today and talk
[34:57] about how foolish those silly women were
[35:00] and they ought to have known better and
[35:01] can you believe it they get misled and
[35:03] they're misguided notice what these men
[35:06] capitalize on their sincerity
[35:09] they're laden with sins they desire
[35:11] deliverance they desire to be made whole
[35:13] they they desire forgiveness they desire
[35:15] sanctification they desire the
[35:17] justification they desire the baptism of
[35:20] the holy ghost so ungodly men can
[35:22] pervert the gospel and use it to mislead
[35:26] people mislead churches women mislead
[35:29] sincere people who are laden with sins
[35:31] and in their guilt well i just want to
[35:33] know i'm that i actually have the holy
[35:35] ghost well you haven't quite proved
[35:36] yourself yet i just want to know that
[35:38] i'm forgiven well if you want to be
[35:39] forgiven you have to do this and they
[35:41] capitalize on their sincerity and their
[35:44] desire to be delivered from their sins
[35:47] through and they capitalize on it using
[35:49] deceit
[35:52] very heavy statement that he's drawing
[35:54] out here
[35:55] and they're led away with diverse lust
[35:57] and then this
[35:58] ever learning
[36:00] i believe this is certainly applicable
[36:01] maybe to the silly women as they're
[36:03] being led away being told that they're
[36:05] going to find relief told they're going
[36:06] to find deliverance told they're going
[36:08] to find forgiveness and they never
[36:09] obtain it but this is certainly true of
[36:11] those that deny the power of revelation
[36:15] he says ever learning and never able to
[36:18] come to the knowledge of the truth
[36:21] i mean have you really just pondered
[36:22] that statement
[36:24] they're learning all the time
[36:27] and so there's a process of educating
[36:29] where they're learning things they're
[36:30] learning things but yet paul can say
[36:32] they're learning but they're never
[36:34] knowing truth
[36:36] they're learning oh they're always
[36:37] learning but they're never coming to the
[36:39] knowledge of the truth it'd be if i go
[36:40] back to the statement that brother
[36:42] carlin shared with me in god we trust
[36:44] everyone else bring data you may be
[36:46] learning a lot of data but you don't
[36:47] know any more about the character nature
[36:49] of god
[36:52] ever learning but never coming to the
[36:54] knowledge of the truth now as janice and
[36:56] jammers withstood moses remember how
[36:58] they were stood up
[36:59] by impersonation
[37:01] so having a form of godliness but denied
[37:03] the power of revelation
[37:04] he's saying that these withstand moses
[37:07] they can do it by impersonation so do
[37:09] these also resist
[37:12] the truth
[37:14] ever learning but never able to come
[37:15] into the knowledge of the truth and not
[37:17] only are they not learning it they're
[37:18] resisting it men of corrupt minds
[37:21] reprobate
[37:23] concerning the faith
[37:26] it's that phrase right there that it
[37:28] drew me
[37:29] to this passage
[37:31] this reprobate concerning the faith
[37:37] they are this is something they're
[37:39] lacking this is something they do not
[37:40] have
[37:42] and remember how paul
[37:43] in the second letter in chapter the
[37:46] first letter to timothy
[37:48] called it said that they holding the
[37:50] mystery of the faith in a pure
[37:51] conscience first timothy 3 9 giving the
[37:54] instructions to deacons he says holding
[37:56] the mystery of the faith in a pure
[37:58] conscience the mystery what is the
[38:00] mystery is something
[38:02] secret
[38:03] something hidden
[38:05] and so it's saying holding the mystery
[38:07] of the faith
[38:09] christ is the mystery of the faith
[38:12] that was the mystery of the judaic faith
[38:15] how did how did that how did the people
[38:17] of israel begin you say well it began
[38:19] with israel no it began with abraham
[38:20] right
[38:21] and he's the father of the faith and
[38:23] here's abraham it begins with him and he
[38:26] has promised a seed
[38:30] and who was that seed
[38:32] christ
[38:34] so that's the mystery of the faith of
[38:36] abraham it wasn't isaac it wasn't even
[38:39] jacob
[38:40] but it was christ and so christ is the
[38:43] mystery of the faith of
[38:44] abraham and this is the mystery of the
[38:47] jewish faith and now that's why you
[38:49] could say when you read in the new
[38:50] testament that there's a lot of
[38:51] expression of what was once hidden is
[38:53] now revealed what we didn't know before
[38:55] is now revealed this great plan of god
[38:57] is now revealed because they never knew
[38:59] it would be that way
[39:01] so christ is the mystery of that faith
[39:03] he was the truth that was once hidden
[39:06] that was hidden before but is now
[39:07] revealed
[39:09] and this is the part of about a mystery
[39:11] is the with the mystery there can be a
[39:13] mysterious element that still remains
[39:15] despite the revelation of it
[39:17] so it wasn't that the whole world in
[39:19] unison when christ came they all go oh
[39:22] why didn't we see it
[39:24] right it was rejected
[39:26] there's very few that followed him very
[39:28] few that were tethered to that truth and
[39:30] recognized it so there still is a
[39:32] mystery that remains despite the
[39:34] revelation
[39:36] so now
[39:38] i feel like i can
[39:41] uh press forward
[39:43] with that i want this to be the
[39:45] foundation
[39:49] and
[39:49] come back to a statement i made in the
[39:51] beginning
[39:52] as you see this
[39:54] they are never able to come to the
[39:56] knowledge of the truth
[39:57] represent concerning the faith
[40:02] the faith is not blind
[40:05] the faith of god's elect is not blind
[40:08] but the faith of god's elect is based
[40:10] upon god's revelation of himself to you
[40:13] individually
[40:14] it's not collective
[40:16] we don't gather as a church today and
[40:17] say well what can we agree to be our
[40:18] revelation today we want to be able to
[40:20] go out and tell everybody this afternoon
[40:22] what we agreed to be the revelation they
[40:23] go well i think it's this and i think
[40:25] it's that and everyone says i make a
[40:27] motion that it's this i second the
[40:28] motion and we do the we do the protocol
[40:30] we do it just right and every
[40:31] parliamentary procedure has been
[40:33] observed we now have everything on the
[40:34] table we all vote we come away say 56
[40:37] percent is voted this is the revelation
[40:39] and you got to leave going man i really
[40:40] like the first proposal
[40:42] i'm one of the ones that voted in the
[40:44] you know the
[40:45] 44
[40:46] but i guess we'll just accept
[40:48] the bodies the group's revelation that's
[40:50] not how it works
[40:52] our faith your faith is based upon the
[40:55] revelation of god to you personally
[40:58] god reveals himself to you personally
[41:00] therefore you are able to stand if every
[41:03] church disappeared this afternoon
[41:06] and you found out that every message
[41:08] pastor walked away from the truth
[41:10] and everyone who believed the message
[41:12] before you denies it and everyone who
[41:14] ever claimed to be a christian even from
[41:16] the mark driscolls to the john hagees to
[41:18] the copelands it doesn't matter who they
[41:20] are hey guess what we're wrong joshua
[41:23] harris was successful in deprogramming
[41:25] me and i'm no longer brainwashed and we
[41:27] all denied the existence of god if he's
[41:30] made himself known to you personally
[41:31] you'd be like well isn't that a shame
[41:34] because now when anybody asks what
[41:36] church i go to i can say i am the church
[41:39] right
[41:40] because if anybody walked away if he
[41:42] makes himself known to you personally
[41:43] and individually you say it doesn't
[41:45] matter if the whole world fails and
[41:47] everything else around me crumbles and
[41:49] falls apart i know what he showed me i
[41:52] know how he's revealed himself to me and
[41:54] i can never deny that any more than i
[41:56] could deny myself
[42:01] so our faith has a basis
[42:04] our faith has an anchor it has a typo
[42:06] something that it's joined to
[42:08] and then when paul says they're
[42:09] reprobate concerning the faith this is
[42:11] what made these this is what these men
[42:13] are reprobate of
[42:15] they don't have the mystery of the faith
[42:18] they can talk to talk they can ever
[42:19] learn but they never come into the
[42:20] knowledge of the truth because they've
[42:22] never entered into
[42:24] coming into the unity of the faith
[42:25] they've never been faithfully taught
[42:27] they never had the word excited in their
[42:29] heart they've never had a revelation of
[42:30] the mystery this is what these men are
[42:32] reprobate of of that anchor
[42:37] reprobate means unfit
[42:40] think about that reprobate concerning
[42:42] the faith unfit for the faith because
[42:45] they have no knowledge of the truth
[42:47] despite all their learning
[42:50] despite all their education
[42:52] despite the process that they've been
[42:53] entering into to try to
[42:55] lead silly women away
[42:57] they're never coming into the knowledge
[42:59] of the truth so they're unfit for the
[43:01] faith
[43:03] i think it's really uh it may be a
[43:04] striking way to phrase this
[43:07] that you're unfit for the faith if
[43:09] you're not coming to the knowledge of
[43:10] the truth
[43:11] you're unfit for the faith if god isn't
[43:13] disclosed has not disclosed himself to
[43:17] you and you know him
[43:21] let me use a familiar scripture for you
[43:25] hebrews chapter 11 verse 1
[43:27] because we're looking at the faith
[43:32] as as opposed to blind trust and bad
[43:35] faith
[43:37] paul writes now faith is
[43:40] the substance of things hoped for
[43:44] the evidence of things not seen
[43:48] so things hoped for and things not seen
[43:52] now i want to say i'm going to
[43:53] substantiate this as i read on
[43:56] a couple statements of brother branham
[43:59] but i want you to ponder this
[44:01] when it says the substance of things
[44:03] hoped for
[44:04] the evidence of things not seen
[44:06] those are things that are yet promised
[44:10] so it's not it's not just well i have
[44:12] faith that this is going to happen it
[44:13] said oh what it's like well i just
[44:15] thought this
[44:16] i just had this thing this thing strike
[44:18] me in my mind that when we let leave
[44:20] today we go to the parking lot all of us
[44:21] are going to have a 2022 model of the
[44:23] car we drove here today
[44:25] hey
[44:26] i got a faith to believe it
[44:28] and we kind of like whoa
[44:30] all right i really want to believe that
[44:31] with everything that's in me right who
[44:33] wouldn't want a 2022 tesla and we're
[44:35] thinking this is going to be great and
[44:37] this is what we have in our minds but
[44:38] it'd be like well that's not how this
[44:40] works
[44:42] faith is the substance of things hoped
[44:44] for the evidence of things not seen but
[44:46] these things hoped for not seen were yet
[44:48] promised or guaranteed by god
[44:52] so substance is the things put under
[44:54] it's the it's the foundation
[44:56] and when he uses the term the substance
[44:58] faith is the substance he's saying it's
[45:00] firm
[45:01] and to say it's the substance of things
[45:03] hoped for
[45:04] it it puts felt excuse me it puts faith
[45:07] in the realm to where it has actual
[45:08] existence
[45:10] that's what's so amazing
[45:12] is it's
[45:13] faith has actual existence it's a
[45:15] reality
[45:16] and i can't touch it i can't see it hear
[45:18] smell feel it and i can't even imagine
[45:21] it i can't even
[45:22] these things are so far beyond me but
[45:24] where there's faith it actually
[45:26] makes something that we hope for have
[45:29] actual existence it's the substance of
[45:31] something we're hoping for
[45:33] that god has promised or guaranteed
[45:37] to say that it's the evidence of things
[45:39] not seen it's a proof
[45:41] that which by a thing is proof so you
[45:43] have the evidence of something
[45:45] i remember one time when i was i was
[45:47] driving with brother tim pruitt we were
[45:48] going to eat all you could eat
[45:51] deep fried all everything's deep fried
[45:54] it was deep fried everything all you
[45:56] could eat deep fried frog legs and
[45:57] everything else i think it even deep
[45:58] fried the styrofoam cup you used for
[46:00] your
[46:01] coke
[46:02] and uh we were driving off and he slowed
[46:03] way down and he
[46:05] goes over these you know and he bumps
[46:07] over these tracks and he goes a train
[46:09] just went through here and they go
[46:11] really how do you know he goes it left
[46:13] its tracks right
[46:15] and i thought well that was a good one
[46:16] that was really good you could tell he's
[46:17] a dad of many years very good dad joke
[46:20] but that would be the proof or the
[46:21] evidence right tracks what's footprints
[46:24] or i can tell you've been here i've tell
[46:25] you done this my kids sometimes have
[46:27] this look on their face because they who
[46:28] was eating chips in the school room like
[46:30] how did he know well maybe it's the bag
[46:32] of lays
[46:34] and the chips everywhere right there
[46:35] would be evidence
[46:38] it'd be proof that by which something is
[46:40] proved or it's the conviction of their
[46:43] reality oh my goodness this is so
[46:45] beautiful faith is the substance of
[46:47] things hoped for the evidence of
[46:48] something i don't see but has been
[46:50] promised by god are guaranteed by god so
[46:53] my faith is the conviction of their
[46:55] reality
[46:57] something that god has promised
[46:58] something that god has said he would do
[46:59] so faith comprehends as fact what cannot
[47:02] be experienced or felt
[47:04] think about faith comprehends this fact
[47:07] something that cannot be experienced by
[47:09] physical senses
[47:11] i may not physically be able to sense it
[47:12] but faith can confirm its existence
[47:15] it comprehends it as fact
[47:18] it is this is another way of phrasing
[47:20] this i kind of borrowed from different
[47:22] translations and the meanings of the
[47:23] word faith is the substance faith is the
[47:25] confident assurance or the title deed
[47:28] that something hoped for or divinely
[47:31] guaranteed
[47:32] it's a part that i think that we ought
[47:34] not to miss and this is to me what kind
[47:36] of helps focus our faith we realize oh
[47:38] my faith is something very specific
[47:41] my faith is to the word
[47:43] it's not just this trust meter that kind
[47:46] of goes out there and it's like who am i
[47:47] going to put my faith in today my faith
[47:49] is to the word that's where it is so
[47:52] that even we say faith is the substance
[47:54] and faith is the evidence that things
[47:55] hoped for and not seen it's not those
[47:58] things hoped for not seen shouldn't be
[48:00] our own imagination
[48:01] shouldn't be what brother micah promised
[48:03] me to bring back when he went on his
[48:04] trip it shouldn't be on you to make me
[48:06] any promises that i know of i mean it
[48:08] shouldn't be in some way it should be
[48:09] what god has said he would do
[48:12] so therefore it's not just something
[48:13] hopeful but something divinely
[48:15] guaranteed so it's the confident
[48:17] assurance that something god's
[48:19] guaranteed is going to happen
[48:21] it is the certainty that we wait that we
[48:23] hope
[48:25] that it is the certainty that what we
[48:27] hope for is waiting for us even though
[48:29] we cannot see it up ahead
[48:32] that's what faith becomes i i may not
[48:35] see it up ahead but god promised it
[48:37] it'll be there
[48:39] so it's not a leap of faith people say
[48:41] leap of faith is you're just kind of
[48:43] jumping blind into something not knowing
[48:45] it's there a leap of faith in reality
[48:48] what faith is is the most confident
[48:49] thing you could do
[48:52] but yet we use it as kind of a phrase
[48:53] well i don't know where this is going
[48:54] i'm just making a leap of faith in
[48:56] reality that's like the best thing you
[48:58] could do
[48:59] is i'm making a leap of faith how can
[49:01] you do that well because
[49:03] it's right there
[49:05] i'm making this is a step of faith we
[49:06] even say i'm stepping out in faith and
[49:08] what do we do sometimes to say well i'm
[49:10] not sure how this is going to pan out
[49:13] and in some ways we're kind of watering
[49:15] down what real faith is
[49:18] faith knows that when you step where
[49:20] it's going to land because he made you a
[49:22] promise
[49:26] brother branham says for faith is the
[49:28] substance of things hoped for
[49:30] the evidence of things not not not seen
[49:33] and faith takes its final resting place
[49:36] on the word of god there's where it
[49:38] finds its resting place it's resting
[49:40] places on god's word
[49:43] so our faith is not without basis
[49:46] it rests on god's word
[49:49] a couple statements i want to read very
[49:50] quickly from anointed ones at the end
[49:52] time in the rapture he says faith is
[49:53] something that's revealed to you that is
[49:55] not yet but you believe it will be faith
[49:58] is the revelation of the will of god
[50:01] he's taking these things and joining
[50:02] them together not not necessarily using
[50:04] them in the realm of faith revelation
[50:06] vision but you say faith is something
[50:08] that's revealed to you
[50:10] it's all-encompassing supreme faith
[50:12] that's coming to be faith is a
[50:14] revelation of the will of god
[50:17] in the rapture he says revelation is
[50:18] faith
[50:21] you cannot have a revelation without it
[50:22] be in faith faith is a revelation
[50:24] because it's something that's revealed
[50:26] to you
[50:28] our faith is the product of god
[50:32] disclosing himself to you
[50:35] it's a product of god revealing himself
[50:37] to us
[50:39] so our faith i'm saying this over and
[50:41] over again because this kind of
[50:43] my my emphasis behind blind trust bad
[50:45] faith our faith is not blind
[50:50] but our faith is the process of promise
[50:53] and proof
[50:55] think about it even if we never knew
[50:57] anything about god
[50:59] and someone preaches to us
[51:01] that we can we can that we are sinners
[51:05] then the word preached awakens us to
[51:07] this idea that there's a righteous god
[51:10] and that i'm sinful and what happens you
[51:12] begin to feel guilt
[51:15] as the proof that god's word is true
[51:19] that all have sinned and fallen short of
[51:20] the glory of god so then you seek
[51:22] forgiveness of sins and you experience
[51:24] forgiveness
[51:26] because you experience some sort of
[51:27] release from it because you've asked god
[51:29] you've experienced this real god forgive
[51:31] me and we
[51:32] those of us here who've experienced
[51:34] salvation know exactly what i'm talking
[51:36] about not because somebody else talked
[51:37] about it because you've experienced it
[51:39] and you feel this genuine relief and so
[51:42] god made this promise and now i'm
[51:43] feeling forgiveness
[51:45] he said he'd forgive me and now i feel
[51:47] forgiven and then we're baptized in the
[51:49] name of jesus christ believing that
[51:51] there is a seal of god because he
[51:53] promised it and then we experience it
[51:55] and the whole thing has become the
[51:57] process of promise and proof
[52:01] promise and vindication
[52:03] promise and confirmation did i just turn
[52:05] my mic on all of a sudden that sounds
[52:07] great
[52:09] let's start all over the volume is on
[52:11] now
[52:13] just blew out all the dust that was in
[52:15] my mic
[52:18] faith our faith is the process of god
[52:20] promising something and then god proving
[52:22] it
[52:23] i say this to every single one of you
[52:25] here today
[52:27] hold god to his word
[52:29] he's made a promise that god you
[52:31] promised it prove it
[52:32] not because you're questioning him but
[52:34] because you believe him
[52:37] in romans chapter 10 i would like to
[52:39] read several verses it's verses 11 to
[52:41] 17. i'm very conscious of our time
[52:44] and so
[52:46] i should at least preach longer than it
[52:48] took me to drive here
[52:49] right
[52:51] so you're all wanting to know where i
[52:52] live
[52:53] what if i stayed in flagstaff last night
[52:57] romans chapter 10 verse 11 for the
[52:59] scripture saith whosoever believeth on
[53:02] him shall not be ashamed for there is no
[53:05] difference between the jew and the greek
[53:07] for the same lord over all is rich unto
[53:09] all that call upon him
[53:11] for whosoever shall call upon the name
[53:13] of the lord shall be saved it seems like
[53:15] in a lot of denominations their chapter
[53:17] ends there
[53:20] but it says how then shall they call on
[53:22] him and whom they have not believed
[53:26] now this is kind of working backwards
[53:28] but i want you to follow this
[53:30] salvation by calling on the lord he says
[53:33] but you can't call unless you believe
[53:35] and how shall they believe in him whom
[53:37] they have not heard
[53:39] so you can't believe in christ unless
[53:41] you've heard him
[53:44] and how shall they hear without a
[53:45] preacher
[53:47] and how shall they preach except they be
[53:48] sent quotes isaiah as it is written how
[53:50] beautiful are the feet of them that
[53:51] preach the gospel of peace
[53:53] and bring glad tidings of good things
[53:57] so if we work work this way
[54:00] the word is preached god sends a
[54:02] preacher he preaches the word you hear
[54:04] the word you hear christ you believe on
[54:06] christ you ask you call upon him and
[54:08] there's your salvation
[54:10] this is the process
[54:12] you believe because you've heard
[54:15] you don't believe because you just
[54:16] snapped something out of the air
[54:19] well i was laying on my bed this morning
[54:21] and i came to believe and understand
[54:22] that
[54:23] there's going to be a giant rocket ship
[54:25] come along and rapture us all out of the
[54:26] earth right and that's where people come
[54:28] up with these ideas
[54:30] and they come with these these
[54:32] sensations and these feelings and these
[54:34] moves and it says but you've heard you
[54:35] believe because you've heard christ
[54:38] he says but they have not all obeyed the
[54:40] gospel for isaiah saith lord who hath
[54:43] believed our report
[54:46] so there's a believing the report the
[54:47] word is preached who have believed the
[54:49] word
[54:50] and then this phrase is uh the one that
[54:53] we identify with so clearly so then
[54:55] faith cometh by hearing
[54:58] and hearing by the word of god
[55:01] there's hearing comes by the word of god
[55:03] being preached
[55:04] the word of god's not being preached
[55:05] there's no hearing it
[55:08] and so hearing comes when the word of
[55:09] god is preached so where the word of god
[55:11] is preached
[55:12] and that is brings the hearing and faith
[55:15] comes when you hear the word
[55:18] how much more of a reminder do we need
[55:21] to
[55:22] be in service hearing the word of god
[55:24] preach how much more of a reminder do we
[55:25] need of how precious it is that we have
[55:28] the voice of the prophet preserved in
[55:30] digital form reel-to-reel tape cassette
[55:32] cd what mp3 whatever it is you need it
[55:34] in that we can still hear the word
[55:36] preached
[55:39] people be able to go right back to
[55:41] what's on the in the message and say
[55:43] well someone told me that they that he
[55:45] said this you go right back and check
[55:46] and see if he said it
[55:48] because there's a lot of mythology
[55:50] sometimes that attaches itself to our
[55:52] faith
[55:52] and then we find out later oh he never
[55:54] said that that was a lyric in a song the
[55:57] person who wrote that that was that
[55:59] really i would i would have thought for
[56:01] sure brother branham said that
[56:03] no it was michael w smith i mean it's
[56:05] like oh
[56:06] silly me
[56:12] faith cometh by hearing hearing by the
[56:14] word this is part of the beautiful
[56:16] mystery of the gospel
[56:18] because he says who hath believed i
[56:20] report
[56:21] the beautiful mystery of the gospel is
[56:22] some kin
[56:24] some are able to believe the gospel
[56:27] but not
[56:28] all and it's the preaching of the gospel
[56:31] just reading through these verses it's
[56:32] the preaching of the gospel that brings
[56:34] faith
[56:35] and if we just look at it in our
[56:37] conversion just your conversion and this
[56:39] is narrowing it down because we could
[56:41] even look outside of conversion that
[56:43] many have heard it preach that god is a
[56:44] healer
[56:46] so now i'm leaving the conversion site
[56:48] and maybe just going to use this side
[56:50] you hear it preach that god by his
[56:52] stripes you're already healed you hear
[56:54] it preach that we shall lay hands on the
[56:56] sick and they shall recover in the
[56:58] preaching of the word
[56:59] instigates a faith in someone to take
[57:01] god at his word and they are healed
[57:05] so that's the word preached that's
[57:08] identifying a promise of god and then
[57:10] god comes behind it and vindicates it
[57:12] and proves it and that's an example of
[57:14] god's word being confirmed and then what
[57:17] that ought to do is make your faith
[57:19] stronger
[57:21] what that doesn't do is create a little
[57:23] box
[57:24] or a little religion
[57:27] and and i want to use my words very
[57:28] carefully because in my mind i'm just
[57:29] kind of thinking maybe just a defined
[57:31] healing a divine healing paradigm
[57:34] well well we know one thing god is he's
[57:36] a divine healer and we'll just kind of
[57:37] huddle in here well this is this is what
[57:39] i know because i was healed that right
[57:41] there the fact that god would heal you
[57:43] ought to cause you to push down other
[57:45] walls and say what else has he said
[57:48] what other promises has he made if he
[57:50] could come do that
[57:51] what else can he do and the greatest
[57:54] miracle of all being salvation of the
[57:56] soul
[57:57] those of you who can testify to this and
[57:59] witness that god made a promise to you
[58:02] the word of god is preached and you
[58:04] receive faith faith came by hearing the
[58:06] word of god and we receive the
[58:08] undeniable experience of the new birth
[58:11] which is to be baptized with the holy
[58:12] ghost that is the seal of god that is
[58:15] the confirmation of your faith
[58:18] so even think about this when paul says
[58:20] he gives us an earnest he gives us a
[58:21] guarantee it gives us a down payment we
[58:23] have faith which is most precious
[58:26] and then god says i want to confirm that
[58:27] faith with the baptism of the holy ghost
[58:30] that's what our faith is based on what
[58:32] is the new birth it's the revelation of
[58:34] jesus christ personally to you
[58:36] that is something that is confirmed
[58:39] our faith is not a myth
[58:42] we're not just grasping it's just not
[58:44] this nebulous thing i can't quite put my
[58:46] finger on it no i mean there's there's a
[58:48] basis for this
[58:51] the believer
[58:52] to the believer our faith is something
[58:54] very concrete substance faith
[58:58] brother branham says in the sermon
[58:59] expectancy faith is not mythical
[59:02] something mentally worked up
[59:04] it's an absolutely fundamental result
[59:07] that happens in a person's heart
[59:11] when faith is appropriated in one place
[59:13] he said god created in simon the faith
[59:16] so there's it's faith that's created
[59:18] fundamental result that happens in a
[59:19] person's heart when faith is
[59:20] appropriated then it is something in the
[59:23] person's heart
[59:25] listen but it can't be based on well go
[59:27] touch a tree and you'll get well
[59:30] right or pray to the post
[59:35] it's got to have a foundation
[59:38] he says now here it is i want you to get
[59:39] it how much more foundation could you
[59:41] place your faith on any level than the
[59:44] word of god
[59:47] faith has to have a foundation
[59:49] if we have faith if this message
[59:52] is turned your hearts and you have a
[59:54] faith the restored faith the faith of
[59:56] the apostles that faith should only rest
[59:59] in the word of god
[1:00:00] and that word of god ought to remain
[1:00:02] pure
[1:00:04] not mixing our faith with something else
[1:00:06] not mixing the gospel with something
[1:00:07] else but recognizing that pure dynamic
[1:00:12] and then keeping it pure so that if
[1:00:14] there's other instances in life where
[1:00:16] you're having to you're having to
[1:00:17] navigate life and you're having to make
[1:00:19] decisions you have to recognize what's
[1:00:20] true and what should i believe that you
[1:00:23] keep this pure
[1:00:25] and if anything you go back to this for
[1:00:27] guidance on everything else
[1:00:30] well i don't know what to believe
[1:00:31] anymore and where you can't quite put
[1:00:32] your finger on it there said well i know
[1:00:34] one thing sure the word is
[1:00:37] i remember one year i think was at
[1:00:38] winning youth retreat there's a big
[1:00:39] debate or argument over global warming
[1:00:42] and one of the brothers just wanted to
[1:00:44] settle it he got up that night and said
[1:00:45] the earth shall melt
[1:00:47] right with fervent haze like settles it
[1:00:50] there's going to be global warming
[1:00:53] whether however you want to deny it or
[1:00:55] accept it or how you want to politicize
[1:00:57] it it's like that settles it for a
[1:00:59] believer okay yeah i accept that
[1:01:01] let those who are tasked with the
[1:01:02] responsibility for policy debate the
[1:01:04] merits of climate change but let me just
[1:01:08] stick with what i know i can trust and
[1:01:10] believe
[1:01:12] something to place your faith it means a
[1:01:14] basis or a foundation what how much more
[1:01:16] foundation could you place your faith
[1:01:18] this is substance faith
[1:01:20] this is supreme faith it's solid we're a
[1:01:23] place where you're going to place your
[1:01:24] faith that has a foundation
[1:01:28] this is my
[1:01:30] uh
[1:01:32] i want to read a statement this is what
[1:01:33] i want to use to kind of turn the corner
[1:01:35] to close
[1:01:36] brother bram says in faith
[1:01:39] now up to this point i've been saying
[1:01:40] our faith has a reason right
[1:01:42] so brother braham says in faith there is
[1:01:44] no reason
[1:01:46] got you got your preacher
[1:01:50] he says you've got it from god
[1:01:52] and you know it's there
[1:01:55] so then it does have a reason
[1:01:57] right
[1:01:58] in faith there's no reason
[1:02:01] you've got it from god you know it's
[1:02:03] there he says another place faith has no
[1:02:05] reason what it's referring to he's
[1:02:07] saying you've got it from god you know
[1:02:09] it's there faith has no reason it's not
[1:02:11] in the head
[1:02:13] faith has no reason it has no basis in
[1:02:15] human thinking has no basis to inform
[1:02:17] judgments by the process of logic
[1:02:21] if you saw an axe head float you
[1:02:23] wouldn't believe that it floated through
[1:02:25] the basis and process of human logic
[1:02:27] you'd have to just say that's
[1:02:28] supernatural
[1:02:30] if a man is walking on water you would
[1:02:32] not believe that he walked on water by
[1:02:34] forming judges through the process of
[1:02:36] logic because that would have no basis
[1:02:37] in human thinking you'd have to accept
[1:02:39] something like that on faith
[1:02:42] so faith has no reason it means it has
[1:02:44] no basis in human thinking or it's not
[1:02:47] formed through the process of logic
[1:02:50] but that does not mean that faith is
[1:02:52] without reason
[1:02:55] which means a cause
[1:02:57] an explanation
[1:02:59] or a justification
[1:03:00] our faith has no reason and that's not
[1:03:02] the product of my human thinking but my
[1:03:04] faith has i got it from god and i know
[1:03:06] it's there so it has a cause
[1:03:09] it has an explanation it has a
[1:03:11] justification the explanation is not
[1:03:13] well this happened and that happened and
[1:03:15] made they just tied it all up in
[1:03:16] apologetics way but god gave it to me
[1:03:20] it has a justification because it's tied
[1:03:22] to the word of god
[1:03:24] so think about that on one hand faith
[1:03:26] has no reason
[1:03:28] as it's connected to a human process
[1:03:30] but our faith has a reason it's
[1:03:32] connected with a divine process
[1:03:35] and peter says it this way first peter
[1:03:37] chapter 3 verse 15 but sanctify the lord
[1:03:40] god in your hearts and be ready always
[1:03:43] to give an answer
[1:03:45] literally
[1:03:47] give a reason
[1:03:50] sanctify the lord god in your hearts and
[1:03:51] be ready always to give an answer well
[1:03:53] how do you know it's give a reason to
[1:03:55] every man that asketh you a reason
[1:03:58] they're going to ask you for a reason
[1:04:00] and your answer is the reason we have to
[1:04:01] have a reason
[1:04:03] to give every when we are asked of the
[1:04:05] reason of the hope that is in you with
[1:04:08] meekness and fear
[1:04:09] so the answers with meekness and with
[1:04:11] fear but it's a reason
[1:04:14] our faith has a reason
[1:04:17] the reason for our faith is it's the
[1:04:20] it's been the word revealed to us
[1:04:23] now
[1:04:24] i'm not i'm not putting forth that that
[1:04:26] is reasonable
[1:04:29] to carnal the carnal human being
[1:04:32] i'm not saying that oh now that we've
[1:04:33] crafted it this way and we've said well
[1:04:35] faith has no reason faith has no reason
[1:04:37] and everybody kind of just looks at us
[1:04:38] as as sheeple who are running running
[1:04:40] after something false or fake or
[1:04:42] weak-minded and we're brain washed and
[1:04:45] religion is for the weak-minded and or
[1:04:47] that you know we're this is blind trust
[1:04:49] and and trying to come up with a
[1:04:51] definition that god says oh no no no we
[1:04:53] don't have we don't have blind trust uh
[1:04:55] this is what we believe and then
[1:04:56] everyone's gonna go oh okay acceptable
[1:05:00] we'll make this one of the branches of
[1:05:01] the sciences
[1:05:03] and we'll give out degrees in this at
[1:05:04] our public university a degree in faith
[1:05:07] so it's i'm not suggesting that the
[1:05:09] world is going to accept it but for the
[1:05:11] individual it's enough
[1:05:13] that what i know in my heart to be true
[1:05:16] my faith has a reason
[1:05:19] ponder this statement
[1:05:21] true revelation is god interpreting his
[1:05:23] own word by vindicating what is promised
[1:05:27] god makes a promise
[1:05:28] he vindicates it and that's your true
[1:05:30] revelation
[1:05:32] anywhere god's made a promise and he
[1:05:34] vindicates it that's a true revelation
[1:05:35] to you
[1:05:40] i want to
[1:05:41] close with ephesians chapter 1
[1:05:45] verses 17 and 18 he says about it speaks
[1:05:48] about your eyes of understanding being
[1:05:50] enlightened
[1:05:53] the world claims knowledge and i
[1:05:56] it didn't really
[1:05:58] um
[1:05:59] this is just something i had been
[1:06:00] pawning really thinking about
[1:06:02] and hadn't really gone into
[1:06:05] much depth to outline something for you
[1:06:07] but i think we can all agree that the
[1:06:08] world claims knowledge or they will not
[1:06:12] uh
[1:06:16] they'll accept a knowledge claim
[1:06:18] based upon education
[1:06:20] or that we gain knowledge by education
[1:06:23] and education is the process of
[1:06:25] receiving systematic instruction
[1:06:28] so through some sort of orderly
[1:06:30] instruction you receive instruction
[1:06:32] that's educating the mind you receive an
[1:06:33] education
[1:06:35] and this would be the primary way that
[1:06:36] one to have an education this would be
[1:06:39] the primary way that one would learn and
[1:06:40] gain knowledge
[1:06:42] and i think that that
[1:06:44] method or system has been validated
[1:06:45] worldwide
[1:06:47] but education is also considered an
[1:06:49] enlightening experience
[1:06:51] so where you experience something and it
[1:06:53] enlightens you and i've been educated to
[1:06:55] something this this happened and so
[1:06:57] there could be a process of where
[1:06:58] something comes to mind and you're
[1:07:00] learning you're studying all sudden
[1:07:01] something comes to mind and say oh i
[1:07:03] think this is the solution and i have a
[1:07:04] solution to the problem i have this
[1:07:07] i want to try this and you can test it
[1:07:08] and say well this is this is how i came
[1:07:10] to know this truth and this is how
[1:07:12] science claims progress
[1:07:15] well we had this idea and we
[1:07:16] hypothesized about it then we tested it
[1:07:18] it's been proven to be a fact and so
[1:07:20] that's how they come with truth that's
[1:07:21] how they come up with knowledge is they
[1:07:23] suppose something through this thought
[1:07:24] process and they're kind of scatter
[1:07:25] shooting spitballing well i wonder if
[1:07:27] and once it's tested they say well this
[1:07:29] is how we arrived at knowledge
[1:07:31] this is how inventions are made or
[1:07:33] discoveries are made and they're all
[1:07:34] instigated by this enlightenment this
[1:07:36] thought process
[1:07:37] and then established by testing
[1:07:40] so this is this is the realm that the
[1:07:42] world works within they work within the
[1:07:44] realm of education
[1:07:45] and that's the basis upon which you can
[1:07:47] make a knowledge claim
[1:07:49] you ever heard of the phrase eureka
[1:07:50] moment
[1:07:52] oh there's a eureka moment it's kind of
[1:07:54] kind of like
[1:07:55] a cry of joy or excitement satisfaction
[1:07:58] when you find something or you discover
[1:08:00] something
[1:08:02] eureka like wow i mean that's a phrase
[1:08:04] that was used and initially it's
[1:08:06] attributed to archimedes who said eureka
[1:08:08] which means i found it
[1:08:11] and
[1:08:12] what he what he said it in response to
[1:08:14] was he'd come up with the process to
[1:08:17] discover whether or not the goldsmiths
[1:08:20] were making the crown for the king of
[1:08:22] syracuse out of pure gold
[1:08:26] and you want to know well how do we know
[1:08:29] how do we know whether or not they
[1:08:31] haven't mixed something else in it how
[1:08:32] do we know that all this gold we
[1:08:34] provided the goldsmith isn't being mixed
[1:08:36] with all these other elements and the
[1:08:37] crown that we put on the king's head
[1:08:39] though it looks like gold isn't real
[1:08:40] gold in archimedes he found a way to
[1:08:43] test something to know whether or not it
[1:08:44] was real gold and he said eureka
[1:08:48] and now this is what the world maybe
[1:08:50] would
[1:08:51] say that's happened thousands and dozens
[1:08:53] of times millions of times to
[1:08:54] individuals whenever all of a sudden oh
[1:08:56] i figured it out i found the answer the
[1:08:57] problem oh that makes sense even maybe
[1:09:00] sitting in class in a difficult
[1:09:01] something is being explained you're like
[1:09:03] i don't get it i don't get it also the
[1:09:04] teacher gives an example like i get it
[1:09:06] now it all makes sense
[1:09:08] that that's uh just a
[1:09:10] that's what the world experiences
[1:09:13] but the believer has something greater
[1:09:17] we we don't necessarily have a eureka
[1:09:18] moment but we have revelation
[1:09:21] and we have god's process of proof which
[1:09:23] vindicates revelation we have a promise
[1:09:26] that is made then god vindicates it and
[1:09:28] that becomes a true revelation and we
[1:09:31] have our eureka
[1:09:33] what is it it's amen
[1:09:36] and what does what does revelation do
[1:09:37] it's a it gives stimulation of
[1:09:39] satisfaction to the believer so the
[1:09:42] scientist is in his lab pouring over
[1:09:44] something trying to figure something out
[1:09:45] and he says eureka
[1:09:47] i found it but to the believer he's in
[1:09:50] the word of god he's hearing the word
[1:09:51] preach he's listening to the message of
[1:09:53] the hour and then something's quickened
[1:09:54] him and he says amen
[1:09:57] i found pure gold i found the real heart
[1:10:00] i found the real grain i found the real
[1:10:02] seed and the believer says i found it
[1:10:06] and the world makes great claims and
[1:10:08] discoveries
[1:10:09] of things that later they say well maybe
[1:10:11] it wasn't quite exactly a perfect
[1:10:13] process
[1:10:18] but our process
[1:10:20] is going to lead to pure gold
[1:10:23] and in ephesians chapter one we invite
[1:10:24] the musicians to come
[1:10:27] ephesians chapter 1 verses 17 to 18
[1:10:31] that the lord god of
[1:10:33] the god of our lord jesus christ the
[1:10:35] father of glory
[1:10:37] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[1:10:43] the spirit of revelation
[1:10:46] in the knowledge of him
[1:10:48] wisdom revelation knowledge
[1:10:52] wow
[1:10:53] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:10:56] enlightened
[1:10:58] that ye may know what is the hope of his
[1:11:01] calling
[1:11:02] and what the riches of the glory of his
[1:11:04] inheritance in the saints
[1:11:07] god has given you a process
[1:11:10] archimedes
[1:11:12] he's given you a process whereby you can
[1:11:15] know
[1:11:16] what these riches are
[1:11:18] and know what's not
[1:11:20] and nope that's not my inheritance i
[1:11:22] have a really dear friend
[1:11:24] who passes the church and he won't
[1:11:25] actually sing the song every promise in
[1:11:27] the book is mine
[1:11:29] won't do it so one time i
[1:11:31] sang it after i was done preaching
[1:11:33] because i knew it kind of bothered him a
[1:11:34] little bit
[1:11:35] because he's like no there's some
[1:11:36] promises in there that don't pertain to
[1:11:38] me and i go well i just kind of look at
[1:11:39] it as a promise it's a good thing the
[1:11:41] others are all threats
[1:11:44] and and he's saying the pro he won't
[1:11:46] sing it
[1:11:47] and so there's certain things that say
[1:11:48] well that's not mine
[1:11:50] no that doesn't pertain to me
[1:11:52] well the bible says this yeah but that
[1:11:53] pertains to that well brother ram said
[1:11:55] this but again that pertains to them
[1:11:58] but what pertains to me
[1:12:01] god's given you a process to know
[1:12:04] what are the what's the glory of the
[1:12:06] inheritance in the saints that you may
[1:12:08] know the hope of the calling of christ
[1:12:12] and this was the prayer he wants to he
[1:12:14] prays that god
[1:12:15] would give you the spirit of wisdom the
[1:12:17] spirit of revelation in the knowledge of
[1:12:18] him to come to know the knowledge of the
[1:12:20] truth the unity of the faith the eyes of
[1:12:23] our understanding being enlightened our
[1:12:25] eyes being opened up how could we ever
[1:12:27] say that faith is blind when we have
[1:12:29] eyes that are wide open
[1:12:31] when the bible characterizes us as
[1:12:33] having eyes to see and ears to hear and
[1:12:36] it's those that seem to have the best
[1:12:37] eyesight and the most knowledgeable the
[1:12:39] most intellectual are the ones of the
[1:12:41] blind leaders of the blind
[1:12:45] because we've had our eyes of
[1:12:47] understanding
[1:12:49] enlightened
[1:12:52] so that we can be ready to give an
[1:12:54] answer to give a reason
[1:12:56] for the hope that is in us
[1:13:01] maybe in some ways what i'm doing is
[1:13:05] taking a concept of faith
[1:13:07] or taking the faith
[1:13:09] i'm just trying to dust it off a little
[1:13:11] bit nothing new
[1:13:13] nothing different
[1:13:14] but just to remind us once again who we
[1:13:17] are
[1:13:18] we're believers because we believe the
[1:13:20] word
[1:13:22] we're christians because we have faith
[1:13:23] that's been excited in us by the
[1:13:25] revelation of jesus christ
[1:13:28] the eyes of our understanding being
[1:13:30] enlightened
[1:13:32] paul said in second corinthians 5 7 for
[1:13:34] we walk by faith not by sight
[1:13:37] but he never meant that faith is blind
[1:13:40] he's just saying that that faith that
[1:13:43] sense is greater
[1:13:45] than natural sight
[1:13:47] because by natural sight you can look up
[1:13:49] ahead and you not see
[1:13:52] what god told you was going to be there
[1:13:55] but faith tells you it's going to be
[1:13:57] there
[1:13:58] why because god said so
[1:14:02] just like the promise that could be
[1:14:03] given to us that there's going to be
[1:14:05] rain
[1:14:06] and maybe look on the horizon
[1:14:08] you don't see any clouds
[1:14:11] but you know it's coming
[1:14:13] and then one day you just see a cloud
[1:14:14] about the size of a hand on the horizon
[1:14:16] and you know
[1:14:18] it's on its way
[1:14:21] the faith we have is
[1:14:22] for we walk by faith not by sight this
[1:14:25] is not blind
[1:14:26] trust this is a deliberate confidence
[1:14:31] in the proven character of god
[1:14:34] let's have that kind of confidence a
[1:14:37] deliberate confidence in the proven
[1:14:40] character of god those of us who are
[1:14:42] here today we're not novices in this
[1:14:45] we've seen god prove his character time
[1:14:47] and time again
[1:14:49] and maybe we go through seasons in our
[1:14:50] lives where it's like well it used to be
[1:14:52] this way and it used to be energetic and
[1:14:54] it used to be feeling and it used to be
[1:14:55] powerful and it used this type that used
[1:14:57] to happen that used to happen that was
[1:14:59] god confirming his word
[1:15:01] god's never changed
[1:15:03] but he allows us sometimes to go through
[1:15:05] dry spaces where maybe our prayers just
[1:15:08] seem like they're not even getting
[1:15:09] through the pillow and he doesn't hear
[1:15:11] our cry and i haven't felt this in years
[1:15:13] or i i haven't had this quickening and
[1:15:15] he allows us to go through that so we
[1:15:17] can begin to search our hearts and say
[1:15:18] now wait a minute was i in it for the
[1:15:19] sensation
[1:15:21] wait a minute was i just in this because
[1:15:23] he could heal my body when i was sick
[1:15:24] what is this all about at the end of the
[1:15:27] day and you get down to me realize at
[1:15:28] the end of the day he wanted me to know
[1:15:31] him
[1:15:32] and i know i'm knowing a god in fashion
[1:15:35] with a god that's unseen to the eye i'm
[1:15:37] fellowship with a god that's unseen and
[1:15:39] unfelt to the senses therefore he gets
[1:15:41] us back to that sense the only synth
[1:15:44] that can truly bring joy satisfaction
[1:15:47] stimulation is that sense of faith to
[1:15:49] know that god is with me even if
[1:15:52] everything in the world declares
[1:15:54] otherwise i'm convinced of this absolute
[1:15:58] that's why we go through the paces we go
[1:16:00] through sometimes
[1:16:01] that's why prayers don't seem to be
[1:16:02] answered that's why things seem to be so
[1:16:04] far away that's why things sometimes
[1:16:06] don't work out the way that we wanted
[1:16:08] them to work out because god wants us to
[1:16:10] be sure
[1:16:11] that we're only mixing our faith with
[1:16:13] the word
[1:16:15] and it's not being spoiled by something
[1:16:17] else
[1:16:18] with our heads bowed today
[1:16:22] i remind you that your faith is a
[1:16:24] deliberate confidence
[1:16:30] and a god whose character you trust even
[1:16:33] if you don't always understand his ways
[1:16:39] because this faith had a genesis
[1:16:44] and as you've gone
[1:16:46] forward through the years
[1:16:50] he's proven himself time and time again
[1:16:58] that
[1:17:02] increases our faith
[1:17:08] you can take god at his word today and
[1:17:10] trust him you might have a particular
[1:17:11] need in your heart
[1:17:13] you might have a need in your mind your
[1:17:15] spirit you may have a need in your body
[1:17:17] but if you just want to
[1:17:20] make a stand for faith
[1:17:22] say i'm standing for this principle that
[1:17:24] i believe your word and i invite you to
[1:17:26] stand today
[1:17:27] just don't know just your own show of
[1:17:29] faith in your heart lord i
[1:17:31] i have a confidence in your truth the
[1:17:33] confidence in your word
[1:17:40] with our heads bowed
[1:17:42] scripture comes to mind lord i believe
[1:17:44] help thou my unbelief
[1:17:46] you say lord just loose my faith
[1:17:49] unmix it
[1:17:51] lord you have you know the process
[1:17:54] of determining whether or not
[1:17:57] my character is
[1:17:58] pure gold
[1:18:00] lord i avail myself to the process
[1:18:03] so many hands are raised heads are bowed
[1:18:06] let's pray together
[1:18:07] our gracious heavenly father
[1:18:12] presence is so precious to us
[1:18:17] lord we are
[1:18:28] we're being honest with you today if
[1:18:29] there be anything in us that
[1:18:33] we've mixed with our faith
[1:18:36] or anything that we've taken our faith
[1:18:38] and attached to
[1:18:42] lord i i know that i
[1:18:45] in preaching because a minister comes
[1:18:47] across so certain and so sure
[1:18:50] and very adamant
[1:18:53] and it can be
[1:18:54] with the heaviness and with the hardness
[1:18:56] because the force
[1:18:58] and the authority of the word
[1:19:00] but lord i would not want anyone to be
[1:19:02] condemned
[1:19:04] if there's this sense that they've taken
[1:19:07] faith which was
[1:19:08] should only be to the gospel
[1:19:12] and begin to add things to the gospel
[1:19:16] and they've made the gospel this and
[1:19:18] they've made the gospel that they've
[1:19:19] made the gospel
[1:19:21] something that it wasn't
[1:19:23] lord may there be no condemnation but
[1:19:25] rather conviction
[1:19:28] and with conviction lord may there just
[1:19:29] be a reconciliation of their faith
[1:19:33] that they would just come back to the
[1:19:35] truth
[1:19:38] we could admit i really got sidetracked
[1:19:40] by that idea i got really sidetracked by
[1:19:42] that opinion i got sidetracked by
[1:19:45] this need in my life and i got consumed
[1:19:47] with it and i started to think this is
[1:19:49] the only thing that it was about
[1:19:52] but i pray that whatever the
[1:19:53] circumstance may be as i stand before
[1:19:55] believers
[1:19:58] whose faith spans over over a half a
[1:20:02] century lord
[1:20:04] who are not novices and who are soldiers
[1:20:07] and veterans of this faith
[1:20:10] may they realize just what an important
[1:20:12] part they play
[1:20:14] in this final voice
[1:20:18] just as a
[1:20:19] there's trees lorded
[1:20:21] in certain national parks
[1:20:23] or i've thought i think of the
[1:20:25] trees at gettysburg they call them
[1:20:27] witness trees
[1:20:30] because they were there to witness the
[1:20:31] battle
[1:20:34] if the trees could talk they could
[1:20:36] describe just how much things have
[1:20:38] changed
[1:20:40] and this is different and yeah they
[1:20:42] really weren't lined up there and there
[1:20:44] really weren't no trees here and that
[1:20:46] road didn't exist and it really looks a
[1:20:48] lot different today than what it really
[1:20:50] was
[1:20:52] but they we are witnesses of truth
[1:20:56] lord as we sit here today in 2021 this
[1:20:59] world is so different
[1:21:03] than the world that this message was
[1:21:04] delivered in
[1:21:07] but the message is still the same
[1:21:10] and your truth is still the same
[1:21:13] and you're still the same god that is
[1:21:15] more than
[1:21:16] more than happy more than anxious to
[1:21:18] confirm your word to your children
[1:21:21] so i pray today
[1:21:23] [Music]
[1:21:24] it to build our faith confirm your word
[1:21:27] lord we believe it
[1:21:29] we accept it we receive it
[1:21:32] father may this process of confirmation
[1:21:35] and vindication continue
[1:21:37] that we might have supreme faith
[1:21:39] so give us a revelation to know
[1:21:41] perfectly what we're doing give us a
[1:21:42] revelation
[1:21:44] to have a perfect understanding a
[1:21:46] complete understanding lord
[1:21:49] we commit the people to you today prayed
[1:21:51] for healing deliverance strength
[1:21:54] in the name of lord jesus christ we pray
[1:21:57] amen
