[0:00] in Matthew chapter 24 I want to just
[0:02] read it again very quickly just to kind
[0:04] of reset it says for there shall arise
[0:06] false Christ and false prophets and
[0:08] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[0:11] much that if it were possible they shall
[0:13] deceive the very elect this is one of
[0:16] brother branham's key scriptures in the
[0:18] sermon the seed of discrepancy and we've
[0:21] been taking from the seated discrepancy
[0:24] some different statements and going down
[0:26] a path to continue on this subject of
[0:28] the kingdom and over the last few
[0:31] Services I can't remember just how many
[0:32] parts it was we've been looking at
[0:35] worldly kingdoms and the worldly
[0:37] kingdoms are the discrepancy that was
[0:40] sown by Satan in the beginning and that
[0:43] discrepancy one of the key things we're
[0:44] focusing in on is it's a contradiction
[0:46] to what's already been that's the
[0:48] definition that brother Branham gave the
[0:50] discrepancy it's not just something
[0:52] different as you'll study and the word
[0:54] of God as you study nature you see the
[0:55] God's the god of variety he said there's
[0:57] a God of differences and different
[0:59] seasons and in times and manifestations
[1:01] I've been studied on the tree of life
[1:03] and in the Jewish tradition some rabbis
[1:07] taught in the midrash and the different
[1:09] oral Traditions they believed that the
[1:10] tree of life is going to put forth
[1:13] thousands of different varieties of
[1:14] fruit and Eternity so God is a god of
[1:16] variety he's a god of differences but
[1:19] the seated discrepancy is actually a
[1:21] contradiction to what has been not a
[1:23] contradiction in the sense that this is
[1:25] sweet and this is sour but the
[1:26] contradiction in that maybe it tastes
[1:28] very very similar but says oh no it's
[1:30] not sour but it's sweet and so that's
[1:32] the that's what the discrepancy is and
[1:34] we know that God used Satan's ambition
[1:37] he used his pride his his pretense and
[1:40] even his political uh inclinations and
[1:43] his politics God used it against Satan
[1:46] he used that ambition and I think maybe
[1:49] the way that I've looked at it in the
[1:50] past is kind of he said it he said a
[1:52] trap using Satan's ambition he said a
[1:54] trap to manifest his attributes and in
[1:57] doing that manifest Redemption and I
[1:59] want to read read one statement and in
[2:01] doing so it's going to kind of hopefully
[2:03] capture some of the momentum that we've
[2:05] been on through these first few Services
[2:06] says in the sermon the seat of
[2:08] discrepancy now we find when God sowed
[2:10] his seed in the Garden of Eden and he
[2:13] calls it his first harvest of human
[2:14] beings he says we find out that it
[2:16] brought forth an able that would be Adam
[2:19] and the woman bringing forth a child
[2:21] that would be in the image of Adam Adam
[2:23] who was in the originally in the image
[2:24] of God he says but when Satan sowed his
[2:27] seat of discrepancy it brought forth the
[2:29] cane where did he sow it into human
[2:31] beings into the field it brought forth
[2:33] the cane one brought forth a righteous
[2:35] one one brought forth an unrighteous one
[2:38] because the eve listened to the word of
[2:41] discrepancy contrary to the word of God
[2:43] so there's a spiritual
[2:45] failure first in her mind she receives
[2:47] that lie that Satan's deforming poison
[2:50] that opened up to the literal physical
[2:52] seed of Cain coming forth and it started
[2:56] the ball of sin rolling right there and
[2:58] has rolled ever since we saw how false
[3:01] religion begins to manifest to Genesis
[3:03] chapter four we can fall it right on
[3:04] through to Babel in Babylon all the way
[3:06] to the very end where Babylon is the
[3:08] church it's a woman that's represented
[3:10] in the end and we'll come back to that
[3:12] in Greater detail but I wanted to read
[3:15] again the statement here in Matthew
[3:17] chapter 24 24 because this to me is a
[3:20] scripture that picks up
[3:23] uh the culmination of all the seeds that
[3:26] Satan had sowed in the beginnings they
[3:27] had planted in the beginning now what
[3:29] Christ is referring to in Matthew 24 24
[3:32] is kind of the time of the Harvest of
[3:34] the wheat and tares when Babylon comes
[3:36] to its power to its Perfection if we
[3:38] could use that phrase and the church is
[3:40] coming to her Perfection and the two
[3:42] Vines have grown up and there it's time
[3:44] for the Harvest the wheat and Terrors
[3:45] have come to full maturity time for the
[3:47] Harvest Jesus uses this for this to
[3:50] describe the end timer characterizes the
[3:52] culmination of Satan's planting for
[3:54] there shall arise false Christ and false
[3:56] prophets and shall show great signs and
[3:59] wonders in so much that if it were
[4:01] possible they the false Christ and false
[4:04] prophets shall deceive the very elect
[4:07] and it's a statement that we know very
[4:10] very well and there's ways that we maybe
[4:11] kind of paraphrase it to see the very
[4:13] like if it were possible but we
[4:15] recognize that there's going to be some
[4:17] manifestation and there's going to be
[4:19] some culmination or climax that by all
[4:23] appearances looks very Christian or
[4:25] christ-like looks very powerful and
[4:27] beautiful god-like if I could say that
[4:30] or presents the word of God and presents
[4:32] the things of God and the nature of God
[4:34] in such a way to where there's some part
[4:36] of us that would want to say oh wow
[4:39] that's beautiful or that's great or that
[4:41] seems sensible and that seems right or I
[4:44] could enjoy that whatever it might be
[4:46] that this flesh may be drawn to so it's
[4:48] going to be so tremendous that but for
[4:50] God the election because we know it's
[4:52] the elect who are not deceived if God
[4:54] had not just elected that you would not
[4:56] fall for the trick you would
[4:58] and so I I emphasize that just so that
[5:01] we're more depending upon him
[5:04] right depending upon the spirit depend
[5:06] on the word of God uh to not fall for
[5:08] Satan's tricks than we are to be like I
[5:10] think I've got this figured out I know
[5:11] what it looks like I know what it does
[5:12] I've just been you know fellowshipping
[5:15] on different things and studying
[5:16] different things and boy there's
[5:17] sometimes you you find a quote and you
[5:19] just grab it you're like oh man this is
[5:21] it this is the doozy this is going to
[5:23] pin it down and you stake everything on
[5:25] it this is wrong brother Braham said
[5:27] this this is wrong and then next thing
[5:28] you know the person says oh yeah but
[5:30] what about all these other quotes hey oh
[5:33] well okay well
[5:34] let me put that one up let me think
[5:36] about this and what so we're trusting in
[5:38] the Holy Spirit to give us guidance and
[5:40] Leadership to recognize these things so
[5:42] I want to take a step further in this
[5:44] the subject
[5:45] and um I I'm going to give a different
[5:48] uh title to it to Edens and in looking
[5:51] at this I'm specifically looking at two
[5:53] different Edens I'm not narrowing it
[5:55] down to only two Edens because I'll kind
[5:56] of tell you there's going to be a turd
[5:58] eating that's coming that Eternal one so
[6:01] it's not just these two Edens there's
[6:02] going to be another one but I want to
[6:04] look at two Edens God's Eden you can
[6:06] send me the original Eden and Satan's
[6:07] Eden and look at how that these are
[6:11] perfect types
[6:12] and and I love the way that brother
[6:14] Brandon puts it and I'll read from two
[6:15] places uh where he talks about it here
[6:17] in just a moment but he calls them types
[6:20] because what God did in the beginning
[6:23] we've been saying was kind of seed form
[6:25] and just the alpha
[6:28] then what Satan does is he comes next
[6:30] and so that's then we have Satan's Eden
[6:32] and this kind of the maybe the blueprint
[6:34] for where we're going but there will be
[6:36] God is always the Omega Satan can't be
[6:38] the one that has the final saying say
[6:40] God doesn't sow seed then Satan sow seed
[6:42] and then God's like oh well we're just
[6:43] going to figure this out but God had
[6:45] already sowed into the seed something to
[6:47] come and already had a plan to come and
[6:50] the Satan does his move and he makes his
[6:52] move but God is going to have the final
[6:54] say God is the Alpha and the Omega Satan
[6:56] comes into in between but it's going to
[6:58] be in the end that whatever was typed is
[7:01] going to be fully manifest
[7:03] and so here in God's power to transform
[7:06] brother Branham says here notice the
[7:09] type of the two Edens so closely type
[7:12] together to almost deceive the very
[7:15] elected Matthew 24 24 said it would be
[7:18] that way so this Eden these two in these
[7:21] two Edens if we have a Gods Eden and
[7:23] Satan's Eden he's saying uh that this
[7:25] one is so close to the first that it
[7:28] could deceive according to Matthew 24 24
[7:30] but I want us to stop for a few moments
[7:33] and consider these two Edens and one
[7:36] thing especially how the Bible tells us
[7:39] that God's word did produce that Eden
[7:42] and how God's word warns us that a other
[7:44] Eden would come so there's the two
[7:46] things that we're pondering that God's
[7:48] word produced in Eden and God's word
[7:50] told us another Eden would come then he
[7:53] visits it again just over a month later
[7:56] month and a half later in power of
[7:57] transformation he says here notice the
[8:00] second Eden typed closely to the first
[8:02] to deceive almost to take the elected so
[8:06] the second eating types
[8:08] so closely to the first and he says
[8:11] these two Edens
[8:13] how this Eden has tried to type just
[8:16] like Satan did at the beginning to even
[8:18] the real Eden the first Eden just watch
[8:20] them type together now I know that that
[8:23] statement um it maybe seems a little bit
[8:26] bulky but there's two Edens and this one
[8:29] Eden
[8:30] is has tried to type this second Eden is
[8:34] tried to type the first to reproduce the
[8:36] first uh just like Satan did at the
[8:38] beginning to the eve and the real Eden
[8:40] how he misrepresented something he says
[8:42] the first the the first Eden just watch
[8:44] them type together now he's comparing
[8:47] them together so those are the two Edens
[8:49] the original eating the beginning and
[8:51] this next one that comes now if you'll
[8:53] allow me to for just a few moments I
[8:55] want to kind of cover a lot of stuff
[8:57] that we've been ministering on uh not
[9:00] just in this series but I think even a
[9:01] lot of ways it's the last couple series
[9:02] we've been ministering on and just look
[9:04] again at God's Eden we're looking at
[9:06] Genesis chapter one Genesis chapter 2
[9:08] and look at God's Eden that's the
[9:10] original Eden that God uh brought forth
[9:12] by the spoken word
[9:14] and so God brings it forth by the spoken
[9:16] word
[9:17] and uh there's there's a lot
[9:21] um I've just been saving some things to
[9:23] maybe just take some time as a church in
[9:25] Genesis chapter 1 verse one even just
[9:28] looking at that and then even to verse
[9:30] three the things in the beginning
[9:31] because the more I'm reading in the
[9:32] message there I say that brother Branham
[9:34] has put in a lot of emphasis on those
[9:36] first three verses that when God did
[9:38] something something was broadcast
[9:41] and that it's that in such a way toward
[9:43] even uh there there's a way that you
[9:46] could look at it that's the moment at
[9:47] which God spoke everything and from that
[9:49] moment on it just manifest from that
[9:51] it's just things are coming forth from
[9:53] what our what he already said and so
[9:55] when God speaks it and brings forth the
[9:57] heavens and the Earth and God brings
[9:58] forth he plants the original Eden he
[10:00] brings everything for if you want to
[10:01] look at those 6 000 years or those six
[10:03] days it was all pregnant with the seed
[10:06] within itself to bring forth
[10:08] and Eden scripturally
[10:10] is a place of pleasure or Delight even
[10:14] in the the Hebrew word uh that is used
[10:17] even in other places even when Sarah
[10:19] says me have pleasure with my Lord the
[10:21] word she used there is conjugated from
[10:23] Eden so Eden is a place of pleasure or
[10:26] Delight or something that gives pleasure
[10:28] even the the Hebrew word for Heaven is
[10:31] gone Eden which is the Garden of Eden so
[10:34] to Hebrew when they think of Heaven they
[10:36] use the even the phrase the future
[10:38] Paradise is the Garden of Eden so that's
[10:41] what that's what Eden represents Eden
[10:44] brother bam says is the great Paradise
[10:47] of God so think of that characterization
[10:49] that Eden is a place of Happiness the
[10:51] phrase Paradise in the Persian is um the
[10:54] King's Garden
[10:55] so that something that had to do with
[10:57] something that was preeminent so when
[10:59] God creates
[11:01] um the earth and the world your heavens
[11:03] and the Earth it's a throne for God it's
[11:05] going to be his pleasure Garden but then
[11:07] he puts man as representative of him
[11:10] into that and so if I could say this
[11:13] this uh this Kingdom that God is
[11:16] bringing forth hid the kingdom like it's
[11:19] a mystery that's bound up within it and
[11:22] so brother man makes this statement and
[11:23] God's power to transform God in six
[11:25] thousand years those are the six days of
[11:27] creation had planted all these wonderful
[11:30] seeds and then notice how he says or he
[11:32] had spoke his word
[11:34] and so again there's that there's that
[11:35] clue about how uh even when he said let
[11:38] there be light there's a clue there to
[11:40] what he's done he spoke his word and so
[11:43] his word is the original seed that must
[11:45] produce
[11:47] to even think that God says a virgin
[11:49] shall conceive is spoke it's got to
[11:51] happen
[11:52] it's got to come to pass and it will
[11:54] come to pass even to the point where
[11:56] Jesus says these rocks will cry out
[11:59] if it says that there's going to be
[12:00] praise given if it says there's going to
[12:02] be this happen even if we didn't do our
[12:04] part God's part will come to pass
[12:07] because the spoken word must produce and
[12:10] we've been using Genesis 2 25 how that
[12:12] in the beginning God created the heavens
[12:14] and the Earth and then everything comes
[12:16] forth and then God frames it with the
[12:18] man and his wife were both naked and
[12:20] we're not ashamed Billy Graham calls it
[12:23] God's economy Arrangement order of
[12:25] Innocence there was no sin they knew no
[12:28] sin and even they were even though they
[12:31] were naked there was no shame in that
[12:33] nakedness and they were not ashamed and
[12:36] they were even hid from anything that
[12:38] would lack in in other words if I could
[12:40] put it this way if someone was to say
[12:43] did you know you're naked they could say
[12:44] no but why does that matter
[12:46] because there was no shame there's no
[12:48] lacking it wasn't like oh oh no you mean
[12:50] you mean and to kind of sell them short
[12:53] everything was just perfect and
[12:55] everything was just set perfectly in
[12:57] order
[12:58] now
[12:59] you all are just pulling very very
[13:00] nicely this morning it's wonderful now
[13:03] this is a key phrase that I hope can
[13:05] carry forward through the rest of this
[13:06] sermon in Satan's Eden the brother man
[13:09] says this about God having faith in all
[13:12] his word his seeds
[13:14] brought forth an Eden of Holiness love
[13:16] and eternal life
[13:17] so how did the Eden come forward God's
[13:21] faith in his own word God by faith in
[13:24] his word brought forth an Eden of uh
[13:26] Holiness love and eternal life that's
[13:28] what God's Eden produced Holiness and it
[13:30] brought an Eden of Holiness of love
[13:31] understanding Perfection and eternal
[13:34] life
[13:35] and he said that's what God's planting
[13:37] and that's what it'll be at the end so
[13:38] there's your but it's by his faith in
[13:42] the word
[13:43] God had faith in his own word so he's
[13:45] not asking you to do anything that he
[13:47] hasn't done already so he had faith in
[13:49] his own word and it produces this Eden
[13:51] and it was all God's
[13:54] right it was all of his creation and
[13:57] that's why there's there's this the
[13:59] statement that uh
[14:00] is I think it's in the Hebrew where it
[14:03] kind of more assumes this that whenever
[14:05] their reference who referenced God even
[14:07] to a Jew and they reference God it's he
[14:09] who spoke and the world came into
[14:10] existence and that's one way they always
[14:12] characterize yahweh's the one who spoke
[14:15] and brought the world into existence so
[14:16] that you would realize that I don't care
[14:18] who you worship all these gods of your
[14:20] imagination all this mythology all these
[14:22] other creations that you have that are
[14:24] man's there's one who spoke and the
[14:27] world came into existence so it was all
[14:29] under his control everything was perfect
[14:34] um God was satisfied when he looked at
[14:37] his creation he was satisfied it's good
[14:38] it's good it's good it's very good and
[14:40] so everything was in harmony there was
[14:42] peace that reigned and God set his
[14:45] headquarters over all this creation
[14:47] heavens and earth if he looked at it as
[14:48] a singular creation he said his
[14:51] headquarters in the Garden of Eden
[14:53] that's a word terminology brother Adam
[14:54] uses there was his headquarters and so
[14:56] that being the headquarters it was
[14:58] symbolic of the capital city symbolic of
[15:01] the throne it's symbolic of of that
[15:04] Chief place that it's all the kingdom
[15:07] but this is the one place uh where it's
[15:10] all my power is represented and my
[15:12] presence is represented where my
[15:13] presence will be
[15:15] and the first Eden God's original Eden
[15:17] we're just looking at that first Eden
[15:19] that Satan tries to type so well
[15:21] this first Eden began with the garden
[15:24] now this is this is for me in looking at
[15:26] this I thought it was remarkable God's
[15:28] first Eden begins as a garden but then
[15:31] in eternity it brings forth the city of
[15:33] God
[15:34] so God started very simple
[15:36] and and then as it progresses and grows
[15:39] it ends up as a city but notice how
[15:41] quickly Cain built the city
[15:43] God plants a garden and one day it'll
[15:46] grow to be a city but Satan just right
[15:47] off the bat wants something quick and
[15:49] Cain builds a city right right away and
[15:52] so as God built begins with the garden
[15:55] and he takes man and he places him in
[15:58] that Garden of Eden and he sets there
[16:00] him there to be the ruler and have
[16:03] dominion over all the Earth
[16:05] and so though God had control over this
[16:09] Eden and had control over the whole
[16:11] creation he had control over Eden and
[16:13] the garden at the East of Eden God then
[16:15] turns it all over to his son Adam and
[16:18] his wife the woman
[16:20] and he gives it to them and he says here
[16:22] all power is yours to rule and Reign
[16:24] Over Eden and now the God who had
[16:27] complete control has transferred control
[16:30] to Adam and his wife do we believe that
[16:33] I trust that you you accept that
[16:35] according to the message of the hour
[16:36] where he said be fruitful multiply
[16:38] replenish the Earth and have dominion
[16:39] over everything there is in other words
[16:41] Adam had the power to speak and control
[16:43] creation he he had even named creation
[16:46] he would have been a God on Earth ruling
[16:49] and reigning with full power and control
[16:51] if you wanted to walk on water he could
[16:53] if you wanted to stop the winds he could
[16:54] if he wanted to whatever he wanted to do
[16:56] he and his wife had full control
[16:59] and it was now
[17:02] as God creates this Eden
[17:05] there is it's a place now that God wants
[17:08] to he's wanting to be become it's in his
[17:11] nature to become again not just to have
[17:13] but to become as we say even that word
[17:15] the Hava is not to have something but
[17:18] it's God who wants to become something
[17:20] so the invisible is working himself to
[17:23] expression and the Creator expresses
[17:26] himself back in creation and so he is in
[17:29] his creation so when he creates heavens
[17:31] and earth he creates an Eden a garden in
[17:34] Eden he places man there we can say Eden
[17:36] was God's Cathedral
[17:39] it was his exalted throne and this is it
[17:42] represented there's God's temple in
[17:44] God's Tabernacle and those are key
[17:46] phrases that I think are important for
[17:48] us to understand what God was doing the
[17:50] Tabernacle the tintel uh the the temple
[17:52] this is his tent this is something he
[17:54] wants to inhabit
[17:55] and when God achieves this in Genesis
[17:58] chapter two it's a perfect picture
[18:00] of the dwelling place that Christ and
[18:03] his bride become
[18:06] brother Graham says Adam was a type of
[18:07] Christ in every figure
[18:09] he said the first Adam and Eve typed the
[18:12] second Adam and Eve so here is God
[18:14] giving forth a type and just like that
[18:17] devil he types the type
[18:19] so here God gives the type and it's just
[18:22] a prototype and Satan's trying to copy
[18:24] the Prototype he's like that's not even
[18:26] that's not even fully released yet
[18:28] it's just and he's going to market with
[18:30] the Prototype but get it after hurry
[18:32] hurry build a city right and here Satan
[18:35] comes and he's working off of God's type
[18:37] and he's typing a type and that's a
[18:39] lesson for us that sometimes types types
[18:42] right right itches our ears but we don't
[18:44] look for types we look for truth
[18:46] identified truth identify the word of
[18:49] God once you find the truth if I could
[18:50] say this the truth is enough
[18:52] but then just kind of maybe the the
[18:54] extra sauce or whatever the sizzle is
[18:57] when you start seeing it typed but you
[18:59] start with the truth but a lot of people
[19:01] start with the type they start with the
[19:03] numbers they start with the times and
[19:05] the seasons and the the current events
[19:07] and they start there and work their way
[19:09] backwards to the message of the hour
[19:11] work their way backwards to the word but
[19:13] we start with the word which is truth
[19:15] and then we see the types and here God
[19:17] starts with the word and brings
[19:19] something forth in type but what does
[19:20] the devil do he types the type
[19:22] doesn't have the truth he types the type
[19:24] and that's a real lesson for us to
[19:26] understand about these Edens So Adam was
[19:28] the type of Christ and every figure Even
[19:30] Adam and the woman were a type of Christ
[19:32] and his bride
[19:34] it says in Isaiah 66 verse 1. I'm
[19:36] looking at God's Cathedral his
[19:38] Tabernacle his tent he says thus saith
[19:41] the Lord the heaven is my throne and
[19:42] your Earth is my footstool remember how
[19:44] that's even represented in Adam who is
[19:46] Heavenly and Earthly bound to Earth
[19:49] Supernatural joining together with him
[19:50] the supernatural Spirit coming into him
[19:52] and how the heaven is the throne the
[19:55] Earth Heaven fastened to the Earth and
[19:57] that becomes God's Throne he says where
[19:59] is the house that you will build unto me
[20:00] and where is the place of my rest
[20:03] where is it going to be it can't be made
[20:05] by man
[20:06] but God's the one who makes his dwelling
[20:09] place and so he creates Heaven and Earth
[20:11] and nature and all that is therein and
[20:13] then he he wants to indwell man his
[20:16] brother man says Man was created for God
[20:17] man was to be the temple of God the
[20:20] place of God's rest the Holy Spirit was
[20:22] man the temple
[20:24] so God created man when he brought forth
[20:26] man and he brings him forth on that day
[20:28] he's saying he is going to be my
[20:31] Cathedral he's going to be my temple
[20:33] this is who's going to be my dwelling
[20:34] place and that's what God wanted he
[20:37] wanted to become one with that he wanted
[20:39] to step into that and so this is God's
[20:43] uh this is God's Temple this is God's
[20:45] place of rest this is God's house and
[20:47] remember as we just read from the church
[20:49] age book chapter three Man was created
[20:51] for God to be a temple of God brother
[20:53] man says Satan knew this
[20:55] and that's why sin came the way that it
[20:57] did this is why he was in Eden is
[21:00] because when he sees it in that sixth
[21:02] day that man comes forth and the woman
[21:03] comes forth he recognizes this is God's
[21:06] Dwelling Place
[21:07] this is what God wants to become this is
[21:10] even the the image I'm rebelling against
[21:12] in heaven this is this is that this is
[21:14] what is going to assume that placeholder
[21:16] so he comes against it and fights
[21:18] against it
[21:19] brother Brandon says in the sermon who
[21:21] is this Melchizedek he's quoting from
[21:22] John chapter one in the beginning was
[21:24] the word and the Word was with God and
[21:25] the Word was God then he skips down to
[21:27] verse 14 I believe it was and then the
[21:29] word became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[21:31] and so here is the this expression of
[21:36] the word the word made flesh and when
[21:38] the word is made flesh it dwells Among
[21:41] Us
[21:42] and we know that in the in the coming
[21:45] down of God the God above us then God
[21:48] With Us and now it's not just God With
[21:51] Us in his son becoming flesh and
[21:53] dwelling among us but now to dwell in us
[21:55] so that's how where God is going he says
[21:58] Abraham says hold that there now notice
[22:01] his first being was Spirit Supernatural
[22:04] all right the great eternal God's first
[22:07] Spirit Supernatural Eternal remember
[22:09] Adam his first Supernatural first Spirit
[22:12] second he began to form himself towards
[22:14] flesh in a theophany it's called the
[22:17] word a body so when God the great
[22:19] invisible
[22:21] Eternal one forms himself into a
[22:22] theophany uh and this Elohim gains its
[22:25] expression it's from that that he
[22:28] creates
[22:30] had he not and again maybe if I'm just
[22:33] uh there's a little bit of speculation
[22:35] on my part please forgive me but had God
[22:37] just created something Beyond himself
[22:39] and gave expression to something
[22:42] uh maybe just for lack of better terms
[22:44] it could have been awkward
[22:45] right the very first thing that would
[22:48] come forth would be
[22:50] I'm the only one I'm God
[22:53] this is it but God actually forms
[22:55] himself first and now he's going to
[22:58] begin to create from that so that
[22:59] everything else that comes is secondary
[23:01] two the one that always was and so God
[23:05] now as he brings forth and recognize
[23:07] that in the heaven of Heavens in the
[23:09] Supernatural Heavens that there was
[23:11] order there was Angels there was things
[23:12] that existed then and so now when he
[23:15] forms himself that he says he began to
[23:17] form himself towards flesh
[23:20] so the Supernatural is first then he
[23:23] begins to form himself towards flesh and
[23:26] then the and if I could say that we see
[23:28] that uh we see that typed in Adam but if
[23:31] I could just skip a lot God whose
[23:33] invisible forms himself into into the
[23:35] logos is the phrase we use of that and
[23:38] now when he does that as he has assumed
[23:41] some form that's not the final form
[23:44] that's not that's not God's ultimate to
[23:46] him he's not like oh man the logos just
[23:48] worship the logos worship the logos even
[23:51] if we look at it that way that's just
[23:52] the thought it's the fullness and the
[23:54] full of it but he wants the expression
[23:56] of it and so he forms himself he wants
[23:59] to form himself towards flesh so when
[24:03] the word became flesh in Jesus Christ
[24:05] that is what he was aiming towards
[24:09] so it says in Hebrews 10 5 wherefore
[24:10] when he cometh into the world he says
[24:12] sacrifice and offering that what it's
[24:13] not but a body hast thou prepared me
[24:16] brother Birmingham says God prepared
[24:18] himself a body in the form of the Lord
[24:20] Jesus
[24:21] so that's when God began to form himself
[24:24] towards flesh Jesus Christ then he
[24:27] becomes that flesh that God was moving
[24:29] towards
[24:31] that's what God wanted to move into
[24:33] that's what God wanted to come into and
[24:35] that's what Adam and the woman typed is
[24:38] in pre-figure and with if I could even
[24:41] say maybe the potential of it that God
[24:43] would come and dwell in and become one
[24:45] with his creation
[24:48] the Bible says in Colossians 2 9 4 in
[24:50] him Christ dwelth all the fullness of
[24:52] the godhead bodily so this is God coming
[24:56] to man Christ the man Christ Jesus not
[24:59] born of a a of sinful flesh not born of
[25:04] an act between a man and a woman but
[25:06] fully created by God the beginning of
[25:08] the creation of God all the fullness of
[25:10] God dwells in him
[25:12] so he thou becomes the dwelling place of
[25:14] the word
[25:15] the word is made flesh
[25:18] now
[25:19] I know that we this is mentioned so
[25:21] often that really the the full gravity
[25:23] of it I think sometimes escapes us
[25:26] but when you are born again you become a
[25:28] new creature in Christ Jesus your new
[25:30] creation by virtue of the birth in your
[25:34] soul your soul then becomes pure
[25:37] like Adams was before he fell
[25:40] becomes pure as if there was no sin
[25:43] because it's born again of Incorruptible
[25:45] seed and by that regeneration and by you
[25:48] having a soul now that exists uniquely
[25:51] indifferent from anyone else who doesn't
[25:53] have the birth God can come back into
[25:55] you
[25:56] and dwell in you and influence you and
[26:00] motivate you and begin to work with you
[26:02] and grow and cultivate that life that
[26:04] has been birthed down into the soul to
[26:06] the point to where Paul says in First
[26:07] Corinthians 6 19 what
[26:09] no you're not that your body is the
[26:12] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[26:13] which you have of God and ye are not
[26:15] your own so then now we not just Christ
[26:19] but now we are the temple of God
[26:22] God made man to be his Temple the
[26:25] resting place of the Holy Spirit and the
[26:27] Holy Spirit today finds rest in his
[26:30] children the Holy Spirit today finds
[26:32] rest in you isn't it interesting how
[26:34] much we cry out for rest
[26:36] Lord I need rest for my weary soul I
[26:38] need rest for my mind that's always
[26:40] racing and I don't know what it is about
[26:41] laying down horizontally that makes my
[26:43] mind just kind of fire on and begin to
[26:45] work on all cylinders and Lord I just
[26:47] need rest I just need rest I just need
[26:48] rest he's kind of like huh that's what I
[26:50] need it's what I want that's what I'm
[26:52] looking for in you maybe we could just
[26:54] invert it a little bit when we call it
[26:56] when we're mind is racing and we feel a
[26:58] little bit of discombobulated mind you
[26:59] just say Lord find Rest in Me
[27:01] Lord I welcome you come find rest find
[27:05] peace in me Lord just come come to your
[27:07] temple come to your Tabernacle because
[27:09] our body is a temple of the Holy Ghost
[27:12] now as we've been kind of able to look
[27:13] at God's Eden and what it typed and
[27:15] where God was wanting to move towards
[27:17] flesh incarnation
[27:19] we know that in Genesis chapter 3 then
[27:21] came the wicked one he's the one that
[27:23] begins to sow the tares and he caused
[27:26] man and now this is you'll be able to
[27:28] grab a hold of these principles
[27:30] especially from the breach in different
[27:31] places he caused man to lose control
[27:34] in other words God had handed something
[27:36] as it were to the man and the woman and
[27:38] said here is title here's full control
[27:42] you have uh you have full dominion and
[27:45] it had a clause in it except if you eat
[27:48] of this that day you die so there was a
[27:52] there was a provision in that title that
[27:54] was conveyed there was a restrictive
[27:56] covenant if I could say that to where
[27:58] now as Abraham called it conditional
[28:00] that now you have full writing title
[28:03] full use and enjoyment and power over
[28:05] the Earth but if you ever cross this
[28:07] line you're going to lose control or
[28:09] lose power and the title deed is we
[28:12] could use that just as a way to convey
[28:13] to describe this conveyance the title
[28:16] deed to Heaven and Earth went back to
[28:20] the original owner
[28:22] so when when Satan causes them to lose
[28:24] control now now it's chaotic because
[28:26] control has been lost but Satan does not
[28:29] get his hands on the book
[28:31] Satan by virtue of this hybriding Satan
[28:35] has not gained control in the sense that
[28:37] he has title to Heaven and Earth but now
[28:39] that the title has gone back to the
[28:41] father and it goes back into the hands
[28:43] of the original owner and as he begins
[28:45] to speak consequence and curse you could
[28:47] see that God is the glory of God is
[28:49] withdrawing and the power of God is
[28:51] being taken away to her now man is going
[28:53] to fend for himself on an earth that he
[28:56] no longer controls
[28:57] you're going to fight with the ground
[28:59] now Beast is going to be uh adversarial
[29:02] to you and there's going to be enmity
[29:04] there's going to be Wars and fightings
[29:06] because man no longer controls Heaven
[29:09] and Earth
[29:11] and his brother man uses the phrase
[29:13] cavity to describe Satan's uh poison how
[29:16] it deformed he said it created a cavity
[29:18] so the fall of pure Man created a cavity
[29:20] or if I could say this a vacuum for
[29:23] Satan to begin to build his kingdom
[29:25] now
[29:27] this if if Adam and the woman
[29:31] had God not set the things in motion
[29:35] and well if I could I'll just say this
[29:37] way there's God could certainly place
[29:40] the man and a woman in such a way to her
[29:42] no matter how much Satan tried to do
[29:44] right no how much he tried to go around
[29:46] and chirp and chatter just had no effect
[29:48] it could have been bound
[29:51] by manifested son and daughter
[29:53] completely bound
[29:55] no plate no way to work even in the
[29:57] service like no sorry move move along
[29:59] right just power to bind uh every evil
[30:02] spirit power to bind any wrong
[30:04] inclination God could have certainly
[30:06] made it made it that way but now when
[30:09] the absence of the glory of God in the
[30:11] absence of the title deed this creates
[30:14] and even with the cavity that's now
[30:15] formed in Cain in his line after him
[30:17] Satan has a channel to begin to work
[30:20] through
[30:21] and so when it says in Ezekiel thou Hast
[30:23] been 28 13 thou Hast been in Eden the
[30:26] Garden of God he had a mode of an
[30:29] objective and brother Brown uses Isaiah
[30:31] 14 Ezekiel 28 and he's using this when
[30:33] he builds God of this evil age and
[30:35] Satan's Eden he's a very very important
[30:37] scriptures to him he's wanting us to
[30:38] recognize this world we're living in and
[30:40] the things that are at the end and he
[30:42] says in Satan's Eden it's been and now
[30:44] is Satan establishing his kingdom in the
[30:46] Earth this is why he was in the Garden
[30:49] of Eden the Garden the Bible says of God
[30:52] God's Eden Satan finds himself in God's
[30:55] Eden Satan's establishing his kingdom in
[30:57] the earth that's exactly why he's doing
[30:58] it for he wants to establish his own
[31:01] kingdom
[31:03] so what Satan wants to do is he wants to
[31:04] establish his own kingdom so we have to
[31:06] kind of get that settled in there right
[31:08] quick that this is what Satan wants to
[31:10] do he wants to establish his own kingdom
[31:14] now if you could take your Bibles and
[31:16] turn to uh first second Thessalonians
[31:18] chapter 2.
[31:20] I hope that in this this is um
[31:23] we'll move along uh for you all
[31:27] these are I want to read
[31:29] in several places in the scripture
[31:31] and a couple places a little bit lengthy
[31:33] but I'm wanting you to recognize if I
[31:35] could say Ezekiel 28 13 thou has been in
[31:38] the garden of God and what the ambition
[31:39] was to do and in Isaiah Chapter 14 verse
[31:42] 12 or even in that expanded section the
[31:46] desire of Lucifer in the beginning was
[31:47] to be like God
[31:49] and and he wanted to exalt himself above
[31:52] the stars of God uh and this he wanted
[31:55] to sit on the Mount of the congregation
[31:56] the sides of the north this is Satan
[31:58] saying I want to be able to create I
[32:00] want to bring forth life this is what I
[32:03] want to be at the Capstone I want to be
[32:04] at the top and I want to have my
[32:05] downline he's the first original pyramid
[32:07] schemer and and so he is he's the one
[32:09] that's wanting to do it by false means
[32:11] and so he's wanting to do this right
[32:13] he's wanting to accomplish something so
[32:14] in second Thessalonians 2 1-8 now we
[32:17] beseech you Brethren by the coming of
[32:19] our Lord Jesus Christ these phrases man
[32:21] or there's mouthfuls and by our
[32:23] gathering together unto him and what a
[32:25] beseeching that ye be not soon shaken in
[32:29] mind so there's one thing he doesn't
[32:30] want us to be or be troubled how by
[32:34] Spirit neither by Spirit nor by word nor
[32:36] by letter as from us listen don't be
[32:39] afraid of artificial intelligence
[32:41] replicating sermons and voices and
[32:43] videos and images Paul was even afraid
[32:45] that they would uh Forge his handwriting
[32:48] and send out make letters and we made it
[32:52] right God saw through it all God
[32:55] preserved it God had a way so he said
[32:56] nor by that letter as from us
[32:59] as that the day of Christ is at hand so
[33:02] there was a something very particular
[33:03] about the day of Christ
[33:06] so now that day of Christ he says let no
[33:09] man deceive you by any means for that
[33:11] day shall not come except there come a
[33:13] fallen away first so there has to be a
[33:15] fall in a way that happens first maybe
[33:18] different ways we could look at that but
[33:20] there's first a fallen away and that man
[33:23] of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition
[33:25] so there's a fallen away and then after
[33:27] this Fallen away some at some point
[33:30] after this the man of sin is going to be
[33:33] revealed
[33:35] and this man of sin is called the Son of
[33:37] Perdition now notice how Paul describes
[33:40] the son of perdition
[33:41] who opposeth and exalteth himself above
[33:44] all that is called God seated
[33:46] discrepancy
[33:47] he opposes and contradicts and exalts
[33:51] himself above all that is called God or
[33:53] that is worshiped because God is the one
[33:56] only one who's due worship so that he
[34:00] why why does he do this so that he as
[34:02] God sitteth in the temple of God showing
[34:06] himself that he is God now that's quite
[34:10] a statement that he what he wants to do
[34:12] his ambition and what he's trying to
[34:14] achieve is to exalt himself above the
[34:17] sons of God the stars of God so that he
[34:19] is worshiped and he wants to find
[34:21] himself resident within and controlling
[34:25] and living in the temple of God
[34:29] showing himself that he is God what now
[34:32] think of that and how brother Branham
[34:33] says God reserved for himself the right
[34:37] to indwell man
[34:39] so when Cain comes forth as not purely
[34:41] human and Satan can begin to indwell
[34:44] Mankind and animate him and possess him
[34:46] he's kind of saying
[34:48] this is what God wanted
[34:50] all right this is what God wanted all
[34:52] along and if you look I said well yeah
[34:54] that that's a human being that's Homo
[34:56] Sapien and clearly this is evil and this
[34:58] is a devil possession and so there's a
[35:00] way that by possessing he's saying this
[35:03] is what God reserved I I am God
[35:06] by being to possess and animate and
[35:08] Inspire and enthuse and these things is
[35:11] that not what God is is that not what
[35:12] God does
[35:13] so he's showing himself that he is God
[35:16] wherein we know that oh when Christ came
[35:19] he's the pure Original Seed God descends
[35:23] Heaven descends the spirit descends And
[35:25] indwells that son showing this is the
[35:30] seed that I've reserved for myself
[35:32] right insane it's like
[35:34] hmm so what was going on these last four
[35:37] thousand years what was all this
[35:40] should have thought of that before you
[35:41] tried to play chess hey
[35:44] so God now Satan's trying to show
[35:46] himself as God he says remember the not
[35:49] that when I was yet with you
[35:51] I told you these things so Paul's asked
[35:53] him if he they remembered what he
[35:54] preached he says and now you know what
[35:56] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[35:58] his time so now you know why this is
[36:00] there's some things that are withholding
[36:02] and waiting and as he says he that
[36:05] letteth will let till she she the bride
[36:08] be taken out of the way so there's
[36:09] certain things that cannot come into
[36:11] their fullness till the bride is gone
[36:12] now this is the key phrase I've been
[36:14] wanting to build to In this passage for
[36:17] the mystery of iniquity death already
[36:19] work
[36:20] so there is a mystery of iniquity
[36:22] working only he who now letteth will let
[36:25] hear this verse is until she the bride
[36:27] be taken out of the way so the mystery
[36:30] of iniquities working God is withholding
[36:32] the fullness the full manifestation
[36:34] until the bride be taken out of the way
[36:37] and then shall that Wicked one be
[36:40] revealed
[36:41] now there's there's some layers to this
[36:43] because it mystery of iniquity that
[36:45] Wicked one there's the man of sin the
[36:47] Son of Perdition it almost seems in some
[36:49] ways symbolic and cryptic and this
[36:51] wicked one will be revealed whom the
[36:53] Lord shall consume with the spirit of
[36:54] his mouth and shall destroy with the
[36:56] brightness of his coming
[36:58] now if I could say this this son of
[37:01] perdition
[37:02] this man of sin this wicked
[37:05] is exposed and
[37:09] exposed under the opening of the seals
[37:12] coming all the way back to White Horse
[37:13] where I said no that's not Christ this
[37:15] is that Wicked one
[37:17] this is just as he rode out against
[37:19] humanity in the garden and he was
[37:21] building his Babylon uh through the Old
[37:24] Testament now we see that he's doing the
[37:25] same thing to the church this mystery of
[37:27] iniquity doth already work and it's
[37:29] going to be working and this man of sin
[37:31] is not going to be incarnate now maybe
[37:32] getting ahead of myself until the bride
[37:34] is taken out of the way and it's the
[37:36] open of the seals that reveals him or
[37:39] exposes him not in his manifestation to
[37:42] his own but to the elect and in doing so
[37:45] it destroys the power of Satan's
[37:47] deception over the elect
[37:50] and notice how it says the mystery of
[37:52] iniquity where was iniquity first found
[37:54] in Lucifer
[37:55] and so the mystery of iniquity it begins
[37:58] as a mystery but then it will be
[38:00] incarnate in the man of sin or the Son
[38:02] of Perdition now remember Satan is only
[38:05] impersonating so there's a mystery
[38:09] that begins first as the mystery of
[38:11] iniquity and we know in Satan's kingdom
[38:14] that it's going to be incarnate in the
[38:16] man of sin
[38:17] and what is he doing he's mimicking
[38:19] God's pattern where there's a mystery
[38:21] first and then flesh second
[38:24] this is Satan's Satan's pattern and so
[38:27] Jesus says in John 17 12 look at mystery
[38:30] of iniquity and then how it's going to
[38:32] become fully incarnate in what we call
[38:34] the Antichrist while I was at with him
[38:36] in the world I kept them in thy name
[38:39] those that thou Hast gave this to me I
[38:42] have kept in none of them is lost so he
[38:45] could say that none that he was given
[38:47] were lost but there is going to be one
[38:48] that is lost and he says he's not the
[38:51] original because they're the one he was
[38:53] given none can be plucked out of his
[38:54] hand he says but the Son of Perdition
[38:56] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[38:59] just as Adam and the woman were a
[39:02] pre-figure of Christ and his bride now
[39:05] Abel and Cain were a pre-figure of
[39:09] Christ the Incarnate God and Judas
[39:12] incarnate devil
[39:15] and if you could follow in this this the
[39:17] scope of things
[39:18] in the beginning God we have creation
[39:21] Satan deforming creation have these
[39:23] thousands of years of history that
[39:25] primarily revolve around Israel and then
[39:27] when we come to Christ
[39:28] it you have what you have produced then
[39:31] in the days of Christ is Jesus Christ
[39:34] the son of God Genesis 1 28 Genesis 3 15
[39:37] The Original Seed in flesh that God can
[39:40] dwell in
[39:42] and therefore there has to be there has
[39:45] to be a component that Satan is trying
[39:46] to achieve
[39:48] and whether Satan is being calculated or
[39:50] not and said oh the Messiah is here well
[39:51] it's time from it's time for my Judas
[39:53] it's time for my enmity it's time for my
[39:54] murder it's time for me to waiting to
[39:57] snatch them whether it's not that Satan
[39:59] had to be deliberate about that part but
[40:01] God allows Judas to be then the twin
[40:05] the twin to Christ that one that that
[40:08] mimic weed and as he comes forth as the
[40:12] Incarnate devil in Judas in Luke 22 3 we
[40:15] read that then entered Satan into Judas
[40:18] so just as God came in Heaven and Earth
[40:21] embraced and Heaven Earth kissed and
[40:23] embraced and dwelt in Christ now we see
[40:25] hell coming up because Satan brother
[40:27] says Judas was from hell and he went
[40:29] back to Hell the Son of Perdition he's a
[40:31] product of Hell he's the product of this
[40:33] evil design Satan then indwells him then
[40:35] Satan entered into Judas
[40:38] now
[40:39] and and what I'm doing today if I if I
[40:41] have if you haven't recognized already
[40:43] I'm kind of just moving along trying to
[40:45] move along in this chronologically in
[40:47] some ways and so recognize this
[40:49] scription first Timothy 3 16. if someone
[40:52] could keep track of all the times I say
[40:53] and so I'd appreciate the data on it I'm
[40:56] going to try to get rid of it and so in
[40:58] first Timothy 3 16 and without
[41:00] controversy great is the mystery of
[41:03] godliness
[41:05] now could we not agree that there's a
[41:07] lot of controversy with respect to the
[41:08] mystery of iniquity
[41:09] and so now this is the contrast
[41:12] without controversy great is the mystery
[41:16] of godliness the mystery of iniquity
[41:18] which is going to be incarnate as Paul
[41:21] is saying in second Thessalonians 2 The
[41:22] Mystery of iniquity death already worked
[41:24] but it will not be full incarnate fully
[41:26] expressed fully manifested till the
[41:27] bride be taken out of the way so now we
[41:29] have great is the mystery of godliness
[41:31] God was manifest In the Flesh justified
[41:34] in the spirit scene of angels preaching
[41:36] the Gentiles believed on in the world
[41:38] received up in the glory
[41:40] so here's the hidden truth of God
[41:42] likeness the mystery of godliness is
[41:45] that God would be manifest in flesh
[41:48] the mystery of godliness or equality was
[41:50] manifested in the man Christ Jesus the
[41:53] mystery of God likeness the mystery of
[41:57] equality the mystery of godliness is
[42:00] made flesh as there would have been this
[42:02] mystery of God from the beginning and
[42:03] they would refer to him as the one whose
[42:05] folk in the world came into existence
[42:06] the one whose name cannot be mentioned
[42:08] the one who is above all the one who's
[42:10] the greatest the one who's the
[42:11] preeminent the Lord of lords the god of
[42:13] gods the one that they would refer to
[42:14] now this mystery of godliness this thing
[42:18] that was mysterious that man sought
[42:20] after that the questions were bound up
[42:21] in him to know his creator it is
[42:23] manifested in Jesus Christ
[42:27] the mystery of godliness in Christ the
[42:30] last Adam the tree of life right the
[42:33] Tree of Life in the beginning the Tree
[42:35] of Life In Christ so we could see this
[42:38] these are just quick building blocks try
[42:39] to wrap up God's Eden you have in God's
[42:42] original Eden the tree of life now you
[42:45] have Christ who comes forth as the tree
[42:47] of life that was there in the beginning
[42:49] and then you're going to have a tree of
[42:51] life in the end in the Eternal City of
[42:53] God there's going to be a tree of life
[42:54] and so Incarnation has not stopped
[42:57] because what does brother bam teaches in
[42:58] Christ is the mystery of God revealed he
[43:00] brings forth a bride tree which will be
[43:02] the Tree of Life restored back to him
[43:05] as husband and wife in the Garden of
[43:07] Eden so in the gone Eden in the garden
[43:10] of the in heaven in the heaven of
[43:12] heavens and the Eternal City there's
[43:14] going to be a tree of life which will be
[43:16] you and Christ
[43:19] there is God's Eden
[43:25] and we're looking at Satan's Eden though
[43:27] how it types God's Eden
[43:30] and how that he comes as a wicked one
[43:32] into God's Eden and it's the mystery of
[43:35] iniquity
[43:36] and what he's moving towards and what
[43:38] he's trying to accomplish and so this
[43:40] other Eden as we're going to call it
[43:42] another Eden or Satan's Eden it's
[43:44] Satan's kingdom that he's been wanting
[43:45] to build and brother bear says it's
[43:47] built up to its Pinnacle now it calls it
[43:49] civilization
[43:51] and there was a I read it last week
[43:54] and how brother how brother Brown said
[43:56] that civilization began
[43:59] civilization is not of God and there's a
[44:01] philosopher and he would have been alive
[44:02] at the time that brother Branham was on
[44:05] Earth so I'm not sure if brother Branham
[44:06] read this it says man is civilized
[44:08] not in his not proportionally to his
[44:11] capacity to believe
[44:14] but in his willingness to doubt I was
[44:17] like thank you philosopher God bless you
[44:19] right
[44:20] it's exactly what brother Bram said
[44:23] That civilization a man is not civilized
[44:25] in proportion to his ability to believe
[44:28] but he becomes civilized proportionally
[44:32] to his willingness or his capacity to
[44:35] doubt and brothers uses the exact same
[44:37] language to say civilization is of the
[44:40] devil and it formed from doubt in
[44:42] unbelief why because man is not trusting
[44:45] in God he's trusting in himself to
[44:47] civilize and to bring forth
[44:50] civilization which is Satan's ambition
[44:52] through that self-awareness and pretense
[44:54] I'm not barbaric I'm not half human and
[44:56] half beast don't look at how civilized I
[44:58] am
[44:59] and brother says civilization is built
[45:01] up to its Pinnacle now
[45:03] so it's coming to its Capstone
[45:05] it's coming to its climax
[45:08] in the sermon God's power to transform
[45:12] is I have my I usually have my my clock
[45:14] up here so I can see what time it is and
[45:16] it it blinked off and I was thinking is
[45:18] that the Lord do I just not to regard
[45:20] time
[45:22] and so if it happens again I won't turn
[45:23] my clock back on it says in God's power
[45:26] to transform Satan's purpose from Eden
[45:29] thou has been and eat in the garden of
[45:30] God was to make his own self an Eden
[45:34] and exalt himself above so the stars of
[45:37] God would worship Him Sons would worship
[45:39] Him and this is the Striking part and he
[45:42] has absolutely carried it out now and
[45:45] when he's done this and brought it into
[45:47] the church
[45:49] is this this is identifying the false
[45:51] christs
[45:52] this is
[45:53] there is a lot that can be said about
[45:56] in terms of being an atheist and
[45:58] agnostic and how many say you know they
[46:02] kind of rationalize with their lack of
[46:04] faith and belief and and they they look
[46:06] at things as
[46:09] a uh
[46:11] well I I I'm better to to doubt uh what
[46:15] I don't know and what I haven't
[46:16] experienced and what I can't see than to
[46:18] believe in something that I can't prove
[46:20] and to believe in something that that's
[46:21] not tangible to me and that's that's the
[46:24] mindset that's the mindset of the
[46:26] agnostics and the atheist but that's not
[46:29] Satan's seat
[46:32] Satan does not want to be worshiped as
[46:34] Satan he wants to be worshiped as God
[46:37] he's not wanting to present himself as a
[46:39] a as an obvious hideous demon he wants
[46:43] to be seen as God so he's identifying
[46:46] the false Christ that deforming power
[46:48] that produced a look-alike
[46:53] now in second Corinthians chapter 11
[46:55] verses 13 14 and 15 for such are false
[46:57] Apostles deceitful workers I know I'm
[46:59] jumping right into a thought but as we
[47:01] could think back to Matthew 24 Paul is
[47:04] recognizing and identifying as John said
[47:06] the Antichrist spirit is already at work
[47:08] among you
[47:09] and where was it working and where was
[47:10] it moving in false Apostles deceitful
[47:12] workers transforming themselves into the
[47:15] Apostles of Christ
[47:17] now this is this is really strong
[47:20] language
[47:22] and it is clearly saying that demonic
[47:26] spirits
[47:27] can motivate and animate people who are
[47:30] professing to be Christians
[47:32] and even Ministers of God
[47:34] now I don't say that lightly
[47:38] and I certainly don't say it at all to
[47:40] make us all suspicious
[47:42] and say well you're a man of the cloth
[47:44] brother Aaron is it possible
[47:46] I I'm not wanting to sow suspicion
[47:49] I I like one time a minister preached
[47:52] and was preaching he preached so hard
[47:53] against preachers
[47:55] afterwards he was asked he was like he
[47:58] preached against preachers and that's
[47:59] where he says he says well brother do
[48:01] you do you not believe in Preachers I
[48:03] mean because they're very very hard
[48:04] clearly pronounced statement against
[48:05] preachers and he preached against
[48:06] preachers and the guy says well
[48:08] listening to you I believe that you
[48:09] don't believe in Preachers and the
[48:10] preacher's response is what do you think
[48:12] I am a hypocrite it's kind of like
[48:19] so false Apostles deceitful workers
[48:21] transforming themselves into the
[48:23] Apostles of Christ and no Marvel
[48:26] for Satan himself is transformed into an
[48:28] angel of Light
[48:29] right so I'm not the Angel of Darkness
[48:31] right that's not how Satan presents
[48:33] himself
[48:34] I mean whenever we do voices like that
[48:36] we know whoa that's the devil right but
[48:39] chances are he might be more like I
[48:44] know it's confusing and
[48:46] but you
[48:48] there's a lot of Cults in this world and
[48:50] you can tell by the intolerance and
[48:52] right
[48:53] and we when we get in we're flesh like
[48:55] pass nothing but the devil don't listen
[48:57] to that right you know that's that it's
[49:00] the devil doesn't present himself as
[49:02] this demon half goat half alligator with
[49:05] horns and everything
[49:07] he he comes through he transforms
[49:09] himself into an angel of Light therefore
[49:11] it is no great thing if his ministers
[49:13] also be transformed as the Ministers of
[49:16] righteousness whose end shall be
[49:17] according to their works
[49:19] so we know Satan Works through
[49:21] impersonation to deceive he does it
[49:23] through that mimic weed the the stowaway
[49:26] seed the evil twin those are the twins
[49:28] of every Revival that's the the false
[49:30] Vine and the True Vine that's that's
[49:32] just replete through the word of God and
[49:34] so there is a representation of the
[49:37] worldly kingdoms as we come to two Edens
[49:40] and we're looking at them what they type
[49:42] and if I could say this now so that
[49:43] maybe this isn't lost Satan now as God
[49:47] has his Eden we know where that ends up
[49:50] but now it's just a type so in terms of
[49:53] the type God's type sayings type in the
[49:55] type but his is just a type but where
[49:58] does his end up
[50:00] feeling the Lake of Fire right that's
[50:03] where it goes and gone no more so it
[50:05] does have an end
[50:07] now brother Brandon says this in Satan's
[50:10] Eden and that's why Satan has done this
[50:12] and he's talking about a kingdom he's
[50:14] saying Satan I believe the just a few
[50:16] paragraphs before Satan's established in
[50:18] his kingdom and Earth he wants to
[50:19] establish his kingdom I think he goes to
[50:20] Isaiah 14 and then he says that's why
[50:23] Satan has done this he wants a kingdom
[50:25] and he's worked through the ministry to
[50:27] do it and God promised he would do
[50:31] now he began by religious deceit and
[50:33] Eden and he's continued ever since
[50:37] so there's a there's the caution the
[50:40] strong caution
[50:41] and and I beseech you to start first in
[50:45] your garden
[50:48] you you you're you are your capacity to
[50:51] be deceived lies within how much
[50:54] carnality exists
[50:56] and I say to see just momentarily let
[50:59] astray
[51:00] it's going to exist first and foremost
[51:02] in how much of the weed thinking you
[51:05] have in your head
[51:07] and how much how much Terrors you've
[51:09] been consuming and how much of the world
[51:11] that that's where it exists because you
[51:13] can't find yourself drunk on the world
[51:15] and the other like well that man's not a
[51:18] man of God right not going to be able to
[51:20] do it you have to look within yourself
[51:22] first and weed out the tears separate
[51:25] everything that offends let's start with
[51:27] this ground let's get this ground clean
[51:29] let's move the beam from my own eye so
[51:31] that I could recognize the sliver like I
[51:34] have to have to start with myself first
[51:35] so before we ever point a finger at all
[51:39] that that person over there and this
[51:41] person over there and this ministry and
[51:42] this move and this Doctrine before we
[51:44] ever point a finger anywhere else say
[51:46] Lord see if there be any wicked way in
[51:48] me see if there be any pretense or Pride
[51:50] or inclination to religion Lord don't
[51:53] make me guilty of pain lip service to
[51:55] the message of the hour in my heart be
[51:57] far from you Lord don't let me worship
[52:00] as a terror I Want To Worship in spirit
[52:02] and in truth Lord that that's the theme
[52:04] for me through in perfect love is that
[52:06] Lord my whole heart is all that will
[52:09] suffice don't let there be any part of
[52:12] my heart that's hypocritical or held
[52:13] back
[52:15] so when we look at this
[52:17] I don't want to be deceived into
[52:18] religion myself
[52:20] but this Matthew chapter 24 is showing
[52:22] us that this is an Eden but I'm calling
[52:25] it an Eden that can be so close
[52:28] and eating it so close
[52:30] to what God's trying to produce what
[52:32] will well he will produce
[52:34] in second Corinthians Chapter 4 verses
[52:36] one to six
[52:37] notice how Paul
[52:39] is connecting Satan's Eden to the
[52:43] beginning
[52:44] that's our that's our that's your lesson
[52:46] that you for the next six verses is try
[52:49] to identify how Paul is connecting
[52:52] Satan's agenda and he exists is where we
[52:55] get the phrase um that the uh
[52:58] the God of this world and then we get
[53:01] God of this evil age and Satan's Eden he
[53:03] says therefore seeing we have this
[53:05] ministry as we've received Mercy we
[53:06] thank not now this is where I want you
[53:09] to begin to recognize but we have
[53:10] renounced the hidden things of
[53:12] dishonesty
[53:13] where Satan is a liar your father's a
[53:15] liar he's the father of it he lied in
[53:16] the beginning here we see the hidden
[53:18] things of dishonesty not walking in
[53:20] craftiness that brings us back to the
[53:22] image of the serpent that subtle crafty
[53:25] deceitful nor handling the word of God
[53:27] deceitfully that's exactly what the
[53:29] Beast the serpent did in the beginning
[53:30] he handled the word of God deceitfully
[53:33] but now here's the contrary the the true
[53:36] but by manifestation of the truth
[53:38] commending ourselves to Every Man's
[53:40] conscience in the sight of God so
[53:41] there's the Satan takes the truth the
[53:44] manifested truth and he handles it
[53:46] deceitly deceitfully with the hidden
[53:48] things of dishonesty walking and
[53:50] crafting his policy and we don't do that
[53:51] we take the manifestation of the truth
[53:53] he says but if our gospel be hid it is
[53:56] hid to them that are lost
[54:00] in whom the God of this world the Lost
[54:03] are in whom are the Lost
[54:06] the God of this world hath blinded the
[54:08] minds of them which believed not so if
[54:10] you believe not you are lost and it's
[54:12] the God of this world that's that that's
[54:14] quite a phrase the God of this world
[54:17] the God of this age the God of this time
[54:20] the god of these kingdoms is Satan
[54:22] offered every worldly Kingdom to Jesus
[54:24] and Jesus did not dispute his control
[54:27] now maybe we could dispute ultimate
[54:30] ownership right because there's one that
[54:32] holds title to the whole earth the
[54:34] heavens and earth and so God is holding
[54:36] title and letting the devil squat
[54:38] letting the devil do whatever he wants
[54:39] and to occupy these Realms but God holds
[54:42] title Satan just has control
[54:45] and so here is or he has access to
[54:49] control
[54:50] so he says that the God of this world
[54:52] has blinded the minds of them which
[54:53] believed not last now notice what this
[54:55] control and what the God of this world
[54:57] his ultimate objective is lest the light
[54:59] of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is
[55:02] in the who is the image of God should
[55:05] shine unto them you should be you should
[55:07] think and see an image of Genesis 1. man
[55:10] was made in the image of God let us make
[55:13] man in our image there's your type but
[55:15] now Christ is the Son of God not a type
[55:18] but he is the Fulfillment of the image
[55:22] of God and he says that lest the
[55:24] Glorious gospel of Christ who is in the
[55:25] image of God his gospel should shine
[55:28] because in the beginning let there be
[55:29] light
[55:30] he comes back to it for we preach not
[55:31] ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[55:33] ourselves your servants for Jesus sake
[55:35] and now he comes back to a creation
[55:37] narrative for God who commanded the
[55:39] light to shine out of Darkness
[55:41] in the beginning God said let there be
[55:43] light
[55:45] and then we find in um
[55:47] just missing now third or fourth day
[55:49] where he begins to create greater and
[55:50] lesser lights and separates these things
[55:52] further he said god who caused the light
[55:55] to shine of Darkness have shine into our
[55:57] hearts
[55:58] chaotic dark
[56:00] muddled confused to give the light of
[56:03] the knowledge of the glory of God in the
[56:05] face of Jesus Christ
[56:07] and it wasn't lumens that did it right
[56:09] it's not that God has like 10 billion
[56:11] Lumen light the word
[56:13] Shone into our hearts to light up the
[56:16] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[56:18] face of Jesus Christ what beautiful
[56:20] connections to in the beginning God
[56:23] created the Heaven and the Earth and God
[56:24] said let there be light and God separate
[56:26] the light from the darkness and he
[56:28] brought forth a beautiful Eden in those
[56:30] days of creation and God has shined his
[56:33] light into our hearts once again into a
[56:36] chaotic flesh in the world that's been
[56:38] marred by darkness and confusion people
[56:40] Paul is saying God has now taken his
[56:44] word and bypassed all the efforts of the
[56:48] God of this world
[56:50] brought forth the son or daughter of God
[56:53] notice how he says the hidden things of
[56:55] dishonesty the walking and craftiness
[56:57] the handling the word deceitfully and
[57:00] the lost because the God of this world
[57:02] has blinded them and covered them over
[57:05] and perverted him and you have the God
[57:07] of this world standing there this is
[57:09] where we get the truth of the God of
[57:11] this evil age is Satan this is how we
[57:14] know that this is Satan's Eden but there
[57:17] in the midst of Satan's Eden God hath
[57:20] shined his light into our hearts
[57:23] that's why he continues we have this
[57:25] treasure in Earthen vessels
[57:27] now in Satan's Eden
[57:29] and I'm just on my my last page of notes
[57:32] Here in Satan's and he says now we find
[57:34] out that every seed bringing forth of
[57:36] its kind there was no death in that Eden
[57:38] there'll be no death in the new Eden
[57:39] there was nothing else but Holiness
[57:41] Purity and eternal life
[57:43] Now by unbelief
[57:45] in all of God's word has brought the
[57:48] seed of unholiness in Satan's Eden
[57:51] remember how this is Brother bam says
[57:53] God with faith in his own word brought
[57:55] forth an Eden of holiness
[57:57] so now Satan by unbelief
[58:01] in God's word has brought a seed of
[58:03] unholiness
[58:04] notice the the opposite
[58:07] God has heavens and earth and or he has
[58:11] the heavens of Heavens he has this
[58:13] beautiful invisible realm and he creates
[58:15] something that's darkness and chaos and
[58:16] he casts Satan down to it if but
[58:18] momentarily that's what it looks like to
[58:20] express something but that's Satan's
[58:22] Satan's realm is this opposite
[58:25] he brought in Eden of unholiness he says
[58:28] we are now entering in where Satan is
[58:30] taking the throne
[58:32] here we're coming to the climax as the
[58:34] Antichrist in an Eden of this Earth and
[58:37] Eden of sin perverted religion
[58:40] this is what the Antichrist Spirit
[58:42] represents this is what's exposed uh not
[58:44] only in the church teaching of a church
[58:45] ages but exposed in the open of the
[58:47] Seven Seals he says he is taking his
[58:50] throne he says he started not upon I am
[58:53] Satan I am the great Angel no and I
[58:55] guess I could have done that in my
[58:56] devil's voice he goes no not upon that
[58:59] but upon perverting God's word
[59:03] I mean I mean God said you can't eat of
[59:06] every tree in the garden right isn't
[59:07] that what he said yeah no we can't eat
[59:09] of the tree of knowledge against evil
[59:10] because if we eat it we die oh sister
[59:14] you'll surely not die
[59:16] God knows that if you eat of that you'll
[59:20] become like him
[59:22] and you'll know good from Evil oh how
[59:25] pleasant it must Ascend how pleasing it
[59:28] was in the way that he spoke and the way
[59:30] that he brought her into it so he says
[59:32] upon perverting God's word he says and
[59:34] that's how he's brought his kingdom in
[59:35] every age
[59:37] this is this is the two Edens God's Eden
[59:39] and now Satan's Eden and now in this
[59:41] great deceitful age ready to take his
[59:43] throne by his people
[59:46] how is he going to do it through people
[59:49] he has built himself an intellectual
[59:51] educated scientific Eden
[59:53] right scientific preachers scientific
[59:55] Church scientific theology everything is
[59:58] scientific everything's based on
[1:00:00] knowledge
[1:00:01] the whole church is built upon knowledge
[1:00:04] it ain't built upon faith
[1:00:09] let me I want to quote brother Thomas
[1:00:11] soul
[1:00:12] he made a statement
[1:00:14] where he says
[1:00:16] some things must be done on faith
[1:00:20] but the most dangerous kind of faith is
[1:00:22] that which masquerades as science
[1:00:27] brother Thomas
[1:00:29] that's uh there's a lot there's a lot
[1:00:30] that he says there
[1:00:32] science it's faith
[1:00:35] masquerade into science that's what
[1:00:38] science is
[1:00:39] right
[1:00:41] it's a faith what is that Faith to doubt
[1:00:44] God's word
[1:00:45] it's religion
[1:00:47] and it takes actually in many ways it
[1:00:51] takes more faith to accept scientific
[1:00:53] theory
[1:00:55] than it would be to believe that there's
[1:00:57] just a being that's greater than all of
[1:00:59] us that created it right like it's like
[1:01:01] I think you need more faith in your
[1:01:03] religion because actually a Believer
[1:01:05] because as it says here I mean I gotta I
[1:01:07] gotta go in there's nothing like a
[1:01:09] economist to get you distracted but he
[1:01:11] says everything is based on knowledge
[1:01:13] the whole church the nominal Church the
[1:01:15] Eden is built upon knowledge it's not
[1:01:17] built upon Faith it's built upon science
[1:01:19] which is a religion masquerading as
[1:01:22] knowledge it's doubt masquerade in his
[1:01:25] knowledge it's carnality masquerading is
[1:01:28] knowledge because we know that knowledge
[1:01:30] there's a true knowledge that in Hosea
[1:01:32] it says my people are destroyed for a
[1:01:35] lack of knowledge and because they've
[1:01:37] rejected knowledge I will also reject
[1:01:39] thee so you got to be careful that it's
[1:01:41] not advocating for being ignorant it's
[1:01:43] not advocating uh for for a lack of
[1:01:47] knowledge as much as it is exposing the
[1:01:50] worldly knowledge and the knowledge of
[1:01:51] this world and the knowledge that
[1:01:53] science is to think to know is pursuing
[1:01:56] a part from faith
[1:01:58] you realize there was a time in the
[1:02:00] greatest scientist upon Earth were
[1:02:02] Christians
[1:02:03] and what they were exploring is not so
[1:02:05] much ways to prove God wrong but ways to
[1:02:08] understand God better and the things
[1:02:10] that he set in motion and laws he said
[1:02:12] motion any scientist today who rejects
[1:02:14] God but then Embraces the theory and the
[1:02:17] work and all the efforts made by
[1:02:18] scientists before them in some ways they
[1:02:20] are being intellectually dishonest
[1:02:22] because they wouldn't have what they're
[1:02:24] working with had there not been people
[1:02:25] who assumed certain absolute truths in
[1:02:28] the beginning
[1:02:29] and the more that they become untethered
[1:02:31] from absolutes their their domain and
[1:02:35] their dogma's data
[1:02:37] and they make comparisons and they
[1:02:40] extrapolate things and they try to
[1:02:42] predict things and listen let's just do
[1:02:44] it today we could ask you to do it now
[1:02:46] based upon what temperature was it today
[1:02:48] at nine o'clock in the morning
[1:02:49] I don't know maybe it's in the 90s what
[1:02:52] is it now
[1:02:53] so if we extrapolate from that in about
[1:02:55] eight more hours it's gonna be 280
[1:02:57] degrees
[1:02:59] no joke just look at the data look at
[1:03:02] the numbers look how it's trending so
[1:03:04] there's a way that Science Now their dog
[1:03:06] must become the data and they're
[1:03:08] Tethered to it it's always changing it
[1:03:10] you can manipulate data to present any
[1:03:12] any kind of wild idea you want just
[1:03:14] change one parameter like aha the study
[1:03:16] works
[1:03:17] Perfect all we did is just remove this
[1:03:19] and add this parameter and they get the
[1:03:20] p-value they want
[1:03:21] P for pretense
[1:03:23] P for false p-h-a-l-s-e prophecy right
[1:03:26] that's how they come up with it but when
[1:03:29] you have an absolute and you begin with
[1:03:30] in the beginning God created the heavens
[1:03:33] of the earth and you have absolutes then
[1:03:35] from there you could begin to work with
[1:03:37] the other things that God helps you to
[1:03:39] know and to understand I think maybe I'm
[1:03:41] kind of getting lost in that but I think
[1:03:42] it's important to point out that the
[1:03:44] knowledge is that which is pursuing away
[1:03:47] from God
[1:03:48] the program's talking about and so
[1:03:51] Satan's Eden they're in this Eden from
[1:03:54] the beginning thou has been in the
[1:03:55] garden of God Eden he has been
[1:03:57] manipulating influencing
[1:03:59] redesigning since the beginning
[1:04:03] and he occupies this place as Ephesians
[1:04:05] 2 2 says we're in time past ye walked
[1:04:07] according to the course of this world
[1:04:08] before you were born again you walked
[1:04:11] under the influence of the world
[1:04:13] you were born into the world with the
[1:04:15] nature of the world sown in you the
[1:04:16] nature of your parents the nurture of
[1:04:17] the world the nurture all that all you
[1:04:19] could be was worldly
[1:04:21] according to the prince of the power of
[1:04:24] the air
[1:04:25] this is where Satan go to Ephesians 6
[1:04:27] you see that their spiritual wickedness
[1:04:29] this is where he's operating he's the
[1:04:30] prince of the power of the air and it's
[1:04:31] that spirit that now worketh in the
[1:04:33] children of Disobedience brother Bram
[1:04:35] takes it and says that's children of
[1:04:36] rebellion and he identifies the first
[1:04:38] one is Cain
[1:04:40] the child of rebellion against the word
[1:04:42] he became the fruit of Eve's Rebellion
[1:04:45] against the word so he is a child of
[1:04:48] Disobedience he is a child of deforming
[1:04:50] power
[1:04:51] not disobedient children but children of
[1:04:53] Disobedience but we by the new birth
[1:04:56] become children of obedience
[1:04:58] and now having been born again we can
[1:05:00] only be disobedient children which
[1:05:02] sometimes we are but you're no longer
[1:05:04] children of Disobedience you know no
[1:05:05] longer children of rebellion but you've
[1:05:07] obeyed from the heart that Doctrine
[1:05:11] all right need to hurry Satan's eating
[1:05:13] he says again now he abide this fall
[1:05:17] he by this fall it has taken over he has
[1:05:21] taken over and possessed the Garden of
[1:05:23] Eden himself he took it over
[1:05:26] now just as remember how the God took
[1:05:28] six six days produces it now he has had
[1:05:31] six thousand years of deceitful rule
[1:05:33] deceiving the people God's children as
[1:05:35] he did then because they were based on
[1:05:37] free moral agency to act anyway they
[1:05:38] wish to and believing that they would
[1:05:40] act right or trust him they would act
[1:05:42] right then they've come with the wrong
[1:05:44] act and sold their birthrights as Esau
[1:05:46] did for the world
[1:05:48] and Satan won it and he took it over and
[1:05:52] he said six thousand years to build up
[1:05:54] his Eden as God had six thousand years
[1:05:57] to bring his Eden to a close
[1:06:00] Genesis 1 2 now Genesis 3 to where we
[1:06:05] are today and by deceit
[1:06:07] deceit of the word and if I maybe just
[1:06:09] want to get in just say this as we could
[1:06:11] see what God did and comes to Genesis 3
[1:06:13] Genesis 3 1.
[1:06:15] in Satan now the mystery of iniquity
[1:06:17] cast down to earth now it begins to work
[1:06:19] in this realm of in this realm of the
[1:06:21] world and Heaven and Earth he becomes
[1:06:23] the Prince of the power of the air the
[1:06:25] God of this world and as he's working
[1:06:27] brother I'm saying now here we are now
[1:06:29] we're right to where Satan's going to
[1:06:31] take his throne
[1:06:32] and we could we can Orient ourselves
[1:06:34] scripturally right in the Book of
[1:06:35] Revelations where all this is
[1:06:37] right to the moment to where Satan's
[1:06:39] being exposed his plan is being exposed
[1:06:42] it's got to be coming to its climax
[1:06:43] because now since his product is the
[1:06:45] false church we can identify certain
[1:06:47] things in the scripture that we've
[1:06:49] arrived to
[1:06:51] right it's remarkable how beautiful this
[1:06:53] fits he says and he has said six
[1:06:55] thousand years to build his Eden as God
[1:06:56] had six thousand years to bring his Eden
[1:06:58] to a close and by deceit deceit of the
[1:07:00] word or the people now established his
[1:07:03] own Eden in this earth in sin God's Eden
[1:07:06] was established in righteousness Satan's
[1:07:08] Eden is established in sin because Satan
[1:07:10] is sin God is righteousness and God's
[1:07:13] kingdom was established in righteousness
[1:07:15] and peace in life and Satan's
[1:07:17] establishment is in sin and religious
[1:07:19] sin
[1:07:20] notice he deceived his deception as he
[1:07:22] said it would he promised to do this who
[1:07:25] promised to do it Satan did
[1:07:27] Satan said I will do this
[1:07:30] I will achieve this I will achieve a
[1:07:32] congregation I will achieve a church I
[1:07:35] will achieve an Eden I will achieve my
[1:07:36] own bride
[1:07:38] and brother bam says and he's done it
[1:07:42] he's absolutely done it
[1:07:45] and so two Edens
[1:07:48] I want to continue on this subject
[1:07:50] so right now I'm just searching in my
[1:07:51] heart where I want to stop with my notes
[1:07:53] today and so I want I want to be able to
[1:07:55] set I want to set it in a good good
[1:07:57] momentum I I want it to be positive it's
[1:08:00] so positive I think people are giggling
[1:08:01] about it two Edens God's eaten in the
[1:08:04] beginning
[1:08:05] is that first one that's God's Eden all
[1:08:08] his seed is son it's an Eden of
[1:08:10] righteousness now what is what is sin
[1:08:12] righteousness perverted
[1:08:15] an Eden of life now Eden of death which
[1:08:18] is life perverted all that all these
[1:08:20] ways you begin to see Satan is
[1:08:21] impersonating Satan is mimicking Satan
[1:08:24] is bringing his kingdom so you have
[1:08:26] God's Eden in the beginning and if I
[1:08:27] could say this because that's after six
[1:08:29] thousand years now Satan's Eden at the
[1:08:32] end
[1:08:33] a lot of comparisons maybe we can make
[1:08:35] in the beginning it's then that maybe we
[1:08:36] find that it hasn't quite come to the
[1:08:39] Harvest
[1:08:40] to where the Discerning Eye can see but
[1:08:42] notice how brother Branham comes and his
[1:08:44] ministry comes at the end to be able to
[1:08:45] bind all the tears
[1:08:47] to look back in the Harvest time he
[1:08:49] preaches Harvest Time this is the time
[1:08:50] when we begin to delineate and separate
[1:08:52] Chuck pulls away Terrors are identified
[1:08:54] they're all bundled to be burned why
[1:08:56] because now where we are now is God's
[1:08:58] kingdom beginning and given enough time
[1:09:00] now it's the time of the Harvest and we
[1:09:02] can see Satan's kingdom in the end now
[1:09:04] it doesn't mean that Satan's kingdom all
[1:09:05] of a sudden is revealed literally to
[1:09:06] everyone's eyes as being that hybrid
[1:09:09] goat crocodile horns and fire breathing
[1:09:11] and those things no it presents itself
[1:09:14] as the True Vine
[1:09:17] is still Satan's eating in the end is an
[1:09:19] opposite it's a contradiction
[1:09:21] So In This Very time that we're living
[1:09:22] in now Satan is perfecting his Eden
[1:09:26] he's he's accomplishing his own image
[1:09:38] what's the temperature right now I'm
[1:09:40] just trying to take the temperature
[1:09:41] anybody know is it comfortable or is any
[1:09:43] anybody comfortable right now
[1:09:45] okay good oh god there I gotta I got a
[1:09:48] thumbs up
[1:09:49] but Luke you're the man right now I'm
[1:09:52] gonna do these last 10 minutes to you
[1:09:54] but in Revelations chapter three I can
[1:09:55] do this very quickly and I'll expound
[1:09:57] upon it more later I just feel like I
[1:09:59] can't leave right there Revelations
[1:10:00] chapter 3 verses 16 uh actually I'm
[1:10:03] gonna start with verse 14. there's an
[1:10:05] unto the angel the Church of the
[1:10:06] laodiceans right
[1:10:08] these things saith the amen the faithful
[1:10:11] and true witness now remember this
[1:10:13] phrase the beginning of the creation of
[1:10:14] God is important because now he brings
[1:10:17] us back to God's purpose in the
[1:10:18] beginning and to Christ who was the
[1:10:21] beginning of the creation of God so now
[1:10:23] in this time when this creation is going
[1:10:25] to come to its fullness I know that
[1:10:26] works that thou art neither cold nor hot
[1:10:28] I would that thou were cold or hot
[1:10:31] it doesn't begin with the compliment
[1:10:32] only age where he doesn't do it so then
[1:10:34] because Thou Art lukewarm and either
[1:10:35] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[1:10:37] mouth what is this it's the hybrid it's
[1:10:39] the pale it's the mixture
[1:10:41] nothing's distinct it's muddied over it
[1:10:43] says because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:10:46] increase increased with goods and have
[1:10:48] need of nothing this is Satan's Eden you
[1:10:50] know us not that thou wretched and
[1:10:52] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[1:10:55] I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[1:10:57] in the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[1:10:58] white Raymond that thou mayest be closed
[1:11:00] speaking to the fact that they say
[1:11:01] they're rich but they're not they're not
[1:11:03] increased with Goods they do have they
[1:11:05] do have needs they they don't know that
[1:11:07] they're wretched miserable poor blind
[1:11:08] and naked so he's he's counting them
[1:11:10] according to their true need and that
[1:11:12] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[1:11:15] and anoint that eyes with isab that thou
[1:11:17] mayest see do you notice the language
[1:11:20] that's being used in Revelations chapter
[1:11:22] three
[1:11:23] and how perfectly it parallels Genesis
[1:11:25] 3.
[1:11:26] because now in the end he's counseling
[1:11:28] them
[1:11:29] that they may by white raiment that the
[1:11:33] shame of their nakedness do not appear
[1:11:35] and their eyes be anointed that they may
[1:11:37] see and it's exactly lines up with the
[1:11:42] serpent sermon in the beginning God doth
[1:11:44] know that your eyes will be opened
[1:11:47] and you'll see
[1:11:49] and in the if you even look in Genesis
[1:11:51] chapter 2 again man and the woman were
[1:11:53] naked and unashamed but now he says that
[1:11:55] the shame of nakedness do not appear in
[1:11:57] other words now in Revelations 3 in the
[1:12:00] climax and Pinnacle of Satan's Eden the
[1:12:02] devil's bride is naked and ashamed
[1:12:06] in the climax of his Eden just as in the
[1:12:09] end of God's Eden there was nakedness
[1:12:11] without shame Satan now can only type
[1:12:15] the type
[1:12:16] and so what has he produced an Eden of
[1:12:19] nakedness and Eden of Shame
[1:12:22] why because he's he's stripping away
[1:12:24] he's trying to mimic he's trying to
[1:12:26] impersonate brother bam says in God's
[1:12:28] Eden they were naked and didn't know it
[1:12:30] and now when Satan's even be it by
[1:12:33] science and education they're naked
[1:12:34] again and don't know it what a
[1:12:37] perversion
[1:12:38] notice we're living in the climax of
[1:12:40] Satan's Eden so in this climax of
[1:12:42] Satan's Eden he's achieved a nakedness
[1:12:44] but he can't produce it without shame he
[1:12:48] can only produce it in a perverted way I
[1:12:50] I'd had it in the notes I'm glad I took
[1:12:52] it out but brother man says Eve was the
[1:12:53] most beautiful woman that ever struck
[1:12:55] the Earth Satan wanted to reproduce that
[1:12:58] but as soon as he hybrid it he can never
[1:13:00] get back to that
[1:13:02] he can never produce that kind of beauty
[1:13:04] he could never come back but he's trying
[1:13:06] as hard as he can
[1:13:09] we are living in the climax of Satan's
[1:13:12] Eden and God's Eden naked and unashamed
[1:13:14] but brother bam says notice how by
[1:13:16] science and education in his Eden it
[1:13:18] comes right back to nakedness
[1:13:20] remember in God's Eden God looked at his
[1:13:22] Eden and said it's good it's good it's
[1:13:24] good it's good it's very good
[1:13:26] but now and it's his Eden pleasure
[1:13:28] Delight
[1:13:29] the King's Garden but brother Branham
[1:13:31] says in laodicean church age and we read
[1:13:33] this together I'm sure you've noticed
[1:13:35] that the spirit had not said one kind
[1:13:39] thing about this age
[1:13:42] in other words
[1:13:43] God looks at his Eden says it's good
[1:13:45] Satan's eating it's not good
[1:13:47] there's not a good thing that can be
[1:13:49] said about it
[1:13:50] God's Eden was a place of light and
[1:13:53] happiness it's a pleasure ground but
[1:13:55] Satan's Eden reading Revelations 3 a
[1:13:57] place of Darkness misery wretched blind
[1:14:00] naked
[1:14:02] and here Satan say well their eyes
[1:14:03] aren't opened in Genesis 2 and they're
[1:14:05] naked
[1:14:07] and so he's I I've achieved my own bride
[1:14:10] who's blind and naked it's like ah no it
[1:14:13] ain't the same thing buddy you've
[1:14:15] produced a false Vine you're producing a
[1:14:18] False Image you typed the type that's
[1:14:21] just the type I've held the truth these
[1:14:23] things are just representing things this
[1:14:25] is the Garden of Eden that I produced
[1:14:27] and you begin with the city and you're
[1:14:29] ending in darkness and Chaos I'm
[1:14:31] beginning with a garden and I'm gonna
[1:14:32] end with the New Jerusalem
[1:14:34] and God is looking at this whole plan
[1:14:36] and this is brother says it's a
[1:14:37] perversion now they're wretched
[1:14:40] miserable blind and naked this is
[1:14:43] Satan's Eden
[1:14:45] but if I could end on this Brothers if
[1:14:47] you could come to your instruments now
[1:14:48] Revelations chapter 3 verse 20.
[1:14:51] in verse 21 behold I stand the door
[1:14:53] knock
[1:14:55] I'm knocking on a door in the middle of
[1:14:57] this wretchedness this nakedness this
[1:14:59] blindness that the very moment when
[1:15:01] Satan's about ready to assume his throne
[1:15:03] he goes I'd stand at the door knock If
[1:15:05] any man will hear my voice and open the
[1:15:07] door I will come into him and will sup
[1:15:10] with him and he with me
[1:15:13] Oh What a Beautiful invitation
[1:15:16] just as there was an invitation to eat
[1:15:19] in Genesis 3.
[1:15:22] now there's an invitation to a feast in
[1:15:24] Revelations 3.
[1:15:27] and then this phrase to him that
[1:15:29] overcometh
[1:15:32] it's the one age where God had no good
[1:15:35] thing to say
[1:15:37] it's an age where there's a blending
[1:15:39] over from
[1:15:41] the prior Open Door age but then brother
[1:15:43] Bram talks about the open door to Satan
[1:15:45] that Satan has
[1:15:47] but he says to him that overcometh will
[1:15:49] I grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:15:53] even as I also overcame prevailed and it
[1:15:57] sat down with my father in his throne
[1:16:01] in the middle of Satan's Eden an
[1:16:03] invitation to the kingdom
[1:16:06] right in the middle of it
[1:16:09] Satan came to the woman and knocked
[1:16:11] and opened a door to worldly kingdoms
[1:16:15] he gained access to worldly kingdoms he
[1:16:18] gained access to build his own kingdom
[1:16:20] on Earth so now God Waits after six
[1:16:22] thousand years after Satan has achieved
[1:16:24] his bride his church his Babylon there's
[1:16:28] another voice
[1:16:30] another voice calling you out of Babylon
[1:16:32] just as God did Abram out of chaldea
[1:16:37] just as he called him away from the
[1:16:38] Babylonian worship and the Babylonian
[1:16:40] temples and he called them away to a
[1:16:41] land that he would give him now God at
[1:16:43] the end of this age is knocking
[1:16:46] saying open up let's have let's have
[1:16:48] this feast in the end time let us enjoy
[1:16:50] these things that are open and it's an
[1:16:51] invitation in the middle of Satan's Eden
[1:16:54] it's an invitation back to the kingdom
[1:16:56] this is the promise as it says will sit
[1:16:58] with me in the throne it's a promise
[1:17:00] that points to a kingdom restored a
[1:17:03] kingdom revived it represents the throne
[1:17:05] represents kingly power uh the the
[1:17:07] royalty of the Kingdom
[1:17:09] he's wanting that to be in our eyes as
[1:17:11] Peter writes for so an entrance shall be
[1:17:14] ministered unto you abundantly not just
[1:17:17] ministered but abundantly fullness into
[1:17:20] the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[1:17:23] Savior Jesus Christ I thank God that in
[1:17:26] the midst of Satan's Eden
[1:17:28] the kingdom has been brought to us the
[1:17:31] Christ is knocking on the doors of our
[1:17:33] hearts and he said behold let's feast
[1:17:37] just as the woman partook of false
[1:17:39] knowledge in the beginning and by
[1:17:41] unbelief and doubt and deforming power
[1:17:43] she fell now I've come to my bride in
[1:17:47] the end and I am speaking to her come
[1:17:50] away my love open up the door let me
[1:17:53] Feast with you and once again by eating
[1:17:56] but this time in its Truth by eating you
[1:17:59] will be translated above worldly
[1:18:01] kingdoms
[1:18:03] and be ministered unto you abundantly in
[1:18:05] the Everlasting Kingdom it's triumphant
[1:18:07] Victorious
[1:18:09] overcoming
[1:18:11] oh Hallelujah
[1:18:12] [Music]
[1:18:14] I in my heart I went another
[1:18:16] uh maybe 10-15 minutes Beyond where I
[1:18:19] was wanting to stop but I just every in
[1:18:21] every single one of these Services I'm
[1:18:22] trying to purpose in my heart to never
[1:18:24] end on the worldly kingdoms
[1:18:26] to not end on Satan's Aiden but always
[1:18:27] punch it back at the end that we will
[1:18:31] there's going to be this kingdom is
[1:18:32] rising
[1:18:34] the the king is here think about the
[1:18:36] language that is being represented in
[1:18:38] the open of the word there's been this
[1:18:40] uh saying a tectonic shift the Paradigm
[1:18:43] Shift no matter how you say it it just
[1:18:44] can't describe it enough of what has
[1:18:46] opened up to us in this hour and how we
[1:18:49] have the privilege of looking back and
[1:18:50] seeing six thousand years of treachery
[1:18:53] and deceit and ruin in chaos and
[1:18:56] impersonations and religion and we have
[1:18:59] the privilege of sitting here and having
[1:19:00] our eyes open to be able to see that
[1:19:03] trail of the serpent to see how he works
[1:19:05] in religious ways and we can stand firm
[1:19:08] in the middle of the road on God's word
[1:19:09] and listen don't get caught up in
[1:19:12] debasing in running down what Satan's
[1:19:15] kingdom is serving as meat you just see
[1:19:18] it on the word that God has brought us
[1:19:22] I think we spend way too much time
[1:19:24] critiquing what other people are eating
[1:19:27] and it might just be because the spirit
[1:19:29] that's sown into so many fad diets and
[1:19:31] nutritional ideas is a lot of it's based
[1:19:34] upon what everyone else is doing and
[1:19:36] look at what they're eating and look how
[1:19:37] they look listen I believe that we can
[1:19:40] eat clean in this hour the word has been
[1:19:42] restored to us we're feeding on
[1:19:44] unfailing body word of the son of man I
[1:19:47] don't want to just deride and criticize
[1:19:48] and lambast what the world's eating
[1:19:51] they're eating on things that they only
[1:19:52] know of but oh God let me be one that
[1:19:55] shows that there is a full feast made
[1:19:58] available and may I be the very hand of
[1:20:00] God that knocks on the door of a heart
[1:20:03] of a Believer who's hungry and thirsting
[1:20:05] for this
[1:20:09] that should be your desire for your
[1:20:11] homes that's my vision for this church
[1:20:14] is that it would be a place where we
[1:20:16] could come and feast
[1:20:17] in this hour
[1:20:19] praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:20:22] could you stand with me
