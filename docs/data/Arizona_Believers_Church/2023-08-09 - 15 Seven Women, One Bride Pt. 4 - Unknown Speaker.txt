TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm excited about the subject matter we're continuing on these verses here how it describes him upon his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself I just felt the song service had such continuity with the subject matter and I love just how well you all worship uh you don't require every chair to be full to fill up this uh this house and praise and worship and are just really compliments to all you and how well you worship makes this statement as we're continuing on the seven women in one bride he makes the statement from the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride he said there is one bride so there can be I have my title seven women one bride we could say seven billion women one bride so it doesn't matter the number there's one bride not a dozen denominations but one bride that's the elected out of the earth and so that's a that's a designation that we should be thinking of as we're looking at the glory of the Earth or the Earth's Glory there's a woman that's elected out of this Earth that's been predestinated to this and there's a lot that is assumed in that statement to this and then he says the ones who can recognize their place in the Kingdom that ought to be our ambition as Believers is to recognize our place in the Kingdom even if we looked at it from the standpoint that you're already positionally placed there and it's already there and it's already full it's already bought it's already possessed uh and it's yours then if there be anything lacking it's our full Revelation and recognition of what it means to be in that position and so however you want to describe it this bride recognizing who she is recognizing her place in the Kingdom or as he says elected and predestinated it's something that she's ordained to this is the real thrust of where we are as Believers in this life is God show me who I am in your word and recognizing our place individually recognizing our place in the kingdom and so one of the principles that we're just continuing to explore in this series on the kingdom is the bride recognizing her place in the Kingdom maybe even more importantly you recognizing your place in the Kingdom that's the purpose of the entire series as I've studied this is for you individually to embrace your position in the body of Christ brace your calling and who you are in Christ right now not in the future as I kind of hinted at I want to preach a sermon called the future is here lest we put anything too far off that we can be in possession of right now let's just read Revelations 19 verses 11 and 12 again it says and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that said upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he deaf judge and make war so we're continuing on what we're ministering on Sunday I'm just going to pick right up in some of these images of the crown and the name his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself as we think about these images this is Christ riding on a white horse we know there's a false image of Satan riding on the White Horse He says many crowns are on his head many crowns one head one name and these are descriptive of Christ now as we see Christ it's it's wonderful to see him but we do not Behold Him as one who would be in Terror or fear of His Image because when we see him we see that we are a part of something that we should see ourselves as being a part of whatever it is we see so we ought not to be afraid and scared when we read about Christ if we see him as a judge we shouldn't be afraid I think the world loves to embrace Christ as the lamb but would just as soon ignore the fact that he's a lion and ignore the fact that they're going to judge the World by Jesus Christ who is the word so when we see this it's not just so much seeing Christ but we want to see the bride represented in this and the sermon proven his word brother Brown said it's also written in Revelation the 19th Chapter when we see him coming the bride and groom important to know that this coming is uh not uh to take his bride this is this coming with his bride it's this third coming or when he comes with his bride that he sets foot on Earth and a physical body brother bam said that's the coming most people are looking for is this literal coming of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ in his third coming for the Millennium and therefore because their expectation they don't fully recognize Christ revealing himself in this day so he says the bride and groom his vesture dipped in blood his name was called the word of God he is the word of God and that's he is the quickening power and I love this this is such at the core he is the holy spirit is the Dynamics that comes into the mechanics the words that make it live that's what we want the word to do we want it to live not just paying lip service to it not just kind of having our ears itched by it but we want the Dynamics to the mechanics to make it live to live we want it to count on Thursday morning not just Wednesday night we want to count on Mondays and not just Sundays and that's what we want we want the Holy Spirit to make the word of God live and if I could just back up a step when brother Brown looks at Revelations 19 and describes Christ as Vester dipped in blood his name is called the word of God he describes it not just as groom but bride and groom so when we look at these characteristics of Christ you're learning something about your mate you're learning something about your husband and this is a key that we'll pick up on Sunday as you learn about your husband you're learning something about yourself now I want to take this phrase and on his head were many crowns and then take this the name that is written but let's look at this on his head were many crowns we covered a lot of this already on Sunday but Urbana makes the statement in the second seal when he's described this way he's been crowned by his Saints and we put a lot out there on Sunday and I didn't really amplify and embellish and try to connect all the parts together I believe there's something very precious about the Lord revealing things to you and quickening things to you and sometimes I you have to resist the urge as a minister to try to explain it all and connect all the dots because when God quickens something to you that's that's the desire that's the real gold and it we were pointing out how there is in this image the bride crowning Christ that her life and her glory and her uh even her own testimony and even in the the symbolism of her Casting Crowns to him or those that are Redeemed by his power casting the crown and saying you get the glory you deserve the praise now the Bible even says exalt wisdom and lift her up and then what she'll do is she'll Crown you she'll give you a diadem and so God has been building up his bride and exalting her and encouraging her he doesn't beat her down doesn't bully her doesn't beat her up he's been encouraging her and exalting her and those words of judgment and harshness that's for the false Church but the words that build up and encourage and correct that's to his bride and as he's exalted her she's a crown to him and she crowns him and this is in the crowning of Christ he is the mighty conqueror he is Victorious he's the one that has overcome and in his crowned Victoria so the the crowning and these crowns upon his head are symbolic of victory now the word that's used in The Book of Revelation here is diadema and that's a diadem as you would even read it that way in the Old Testament it's a kingly ornament on one's head and it's you ought to just be thinking of that thing that would Crown a king in whatever way it would be fashioned whether it be gold and uh with rubies and different uh Jewels it's something that's put upon uh the head of a king and you could take other words in Scripture that referred to a crown and find that this Crown is used as a badge of victory for someone who's Victorious so it has Royal implications it has Victor and conqueror implications and when we think of a crown and as we read it here that he has one head and many crowns are on his head and he's coming with this in this kind of state to make war and he's going to judge and his vesters dipped in Blood and we we see him coming as a righteous judge this Crown is symbolic and in general it's symbolic of one's rule we could even use the term to say the crown to refer to the one in power or the The Entity that governs or it kind of represents it's even a phrase that's used to represent those that rule and so this Crown represents dignity and honor and power and oh I would even go so far as to say the crown is representative of the entire ruler government does that make sense when I say we refer to the crown and we say well the crown has come out with a statement if you have to think about King Charles or is that who it is is it King Chuck I it was easier when it was uh the queen that now that you have a king and you say well the crown and has issued an official position or the crown this or the crown that and and it's not this uh you know this this crown on a on a pillow that can talk uh it is it refers to the rule the authority the the the governing entity now a few scriptures just should get a bigger picture of the crown and this is helpful because I want to get into some of the aspects of the Kingdom as far as the king those ruling and reigning and in Ezekiel 16 12 talking about uh I would say Israel in general he says and I put a jewel on there thy forehead and earrings in thine ears and he's just talking about and even that phrase there is a little bit misunderstood uh and he's describing of what I've done for you and he says and a beautiful crown upon thy head and as you read in Ezekiel 16 and you would read around it you'd see that this is referring to when one has been raised up to a particular position that once they assume this new position conferring a crown honors them in this new office that when one has achieved that office and as the reason is it Charles is it King Charles is it Prince Charles and now he's the king sometimes you guys just look at me like I know there's a joke in there and he's trying to trick us but when he became when Prince to King that he was coronated now that he's come into this office and in this position uh he receives the crown and so when he says I I put a beautiful crown upon thy head this is the the honoring of one in a new position or a new relationship and so a crown is used and it's worn as the mark of an office the fact that there would be a crown placed upon this woman's head and I put a jewel upon you in earrings and thine ears and a beautiful crown upon the head it says I've raised you up to this position I've made you glorious I've made you powerful I've made you beautiful and the crown is emblematic of their their uh their office and their position and as it's expressed even in here it's a it's an emblem of one that we even use the phrase bride and I'm using it more in just a general sense it's the emblem of a bride who's been made the queen as the wife of the king that there's a there's something that's being conferred something being placed upon her and then in Song of Solomon and reading it there in Ezekiel 16 shows that even the woman is crowned and then in Song of Solomon verses 3 and 11 and I know I'm taking this somewhat out of context and not exploring what's around it he says go forth oh ye Daughters of Zion and behold King Solomon with the crown so now we're seeing the king and he's crowned and recognize what this Crown signifies wherewith his mother crowned him in the Day of His espousals and that word of spousal there's marriage the United this isn't an engagement or the promise to Mary but there is a crown that has been placed on him at the time of his wedding at the time of the marriage and in the day of the gladness of his heart so that's a day of rejoicing this is the crown of rejoice and this is the day of great Jubilation and an expression and exaltation this would be a joyful day something to look forward to and he has crowned the king is crowned on the day of his wedding the day of the gladness of his heart so not only is the crown associated with arriving at a new position in terms of government and power but now it's associated with the honor ascribed by marriage that here the king received a crown at the time of his espousal uh we're looking at a day of marriage a day of uniting a day of gladness and a crown is associated with that I know this is very simple so you just feel really good tonight as you're pulling that's what is when we see Christ and on his head were many crowns these crowns signify something and as we're pointing out on Sunday let's look at verse Proverbs 12 verse 4. as this Crown is used to identify a position or is worn as one who is in a particular office the the wife of the king the consort of a king wears the crown to signify her relationship in her position with the crown and the King wearing a crown on the day of his uniting in his wedding these are the images of a crown that I want you to think about when we see Christ riding on this white horse and then in Proverbs 12 4 it says a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband and I want to take this verse and make it much more practical as we go forward a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones I would say this is two different types of crowns two different crownings one is life and power the other one is death one who had the virtuous woman crowns her husband is a herself a crown to her husband but one that maketh ashamed is rottenness in his bones one is a crowning of strength the other one is a crowning of death as it's read a virtuous woman that were their virtuous speaks of strength and even bearing and bringing forth a strong woman is an insignia she's an emblem she's a symbol of her husband's rule remember the crown represents dignity honor and power that is symbolic of one's Reign it's even symbolic of a government so here a woman is a crown she is symbolic of the husband's dignity she's symbolic of his honor symbolic of his art represents his power represents his authority whereas a shameful woman crowns her husband with death and as I've been looking at this and and I like to and in Sunday morning Lord will will start with how the woman reflects the character of the man and as I was looking at this scripture and I want to take it from this very scripture a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband so she is a an emblem and represents his dignity his character his power his honor and a woman who is shameful she reflects what is in the man and and if there be some sense of argument that well she she doesn't reflect what's in him if she doesn't reflect it she corrupts it maybe we could agree on that you say wow he's got he married the wrong woman and she's a bad woman but now that woman then has the power a shameful woman has power to be rottenness in his bones so it either reflects the rottenness that's already there in his character or the wrong woman can corrupt a man's character I think that's a mouthful maybe we should just read Acts 2 38 and and go forward because that's something to really think about now in Ezekiel chapter 21 verses 25 to 27 it says in thou profane Wicked Prince of Israel I want you to see this the the this emblem of on his head were many crowns and thou profane Wicked Prince of Israel whose Day Has Come when iniquity shall have an end thus saith the Lord God remove the diadem and take off the crown I'm wanting to use these scriptures to understand better what these crowns on his head represented and how these crowns upon the head of Christ are symbolic of even your character symbolic of the bride of Christ as The Virtuous Woman as a crown to her husband and Christ is wearing many crowns that I want you to see yourself and even desire to be a crown on his head to be a crowning to him and now with this profane Wicked Prince of Israel in view as we could even associate this with the woman that makes her husband ashamed or is a shameful woman it says remove the diadem and take off the crown in Ezekiel 16 it says I put a beautiful crown on your head and out to the prince of Israel take off the crown take off the diadem this shall not be the same exalt him that is low and obeys him that is high I will overturn over turn overturn it and this isn't a record skipping this isn't this isn't the writer stuttering I will overturn overturn overturn it a three-fold overturning this absolute certainty of the overturning the undoing of what has been done I will overturn overturn overturn it and it shall be no more until he come who's right it is and I will give it him now this is the kingdom will rise again be taken away from the one that is undeserving taken away from the wicked Prince of Israel remove the diadem take off the crown overturn over turn overturn it with this absolute certainty there's going to be a taken away of the authority taken away from the glory taken away in a removal of the crown uh from them but I will give it to the one who's right it is that when he comes I will give it to him now that's Christ that's the Messiah speaking that there's going to be no matter how much it may look like in the natural that the kingdom is lost no matter how much it may look like in the natural that one has the right to the kingdom there's going to be one who seems to be very low who's going to be exalted one who does not look like a king who's going to be enthroned there's going to be a one who's right it is and I will give the crown to him I will give the diadem to him I will give all the glory and honor to him who's right it is speaking of the Kingdom and as the crown is removed remove the diadem and take off the crown the crown is removed to signify that there's no right to rule because they're unfit to rule it wouldn't be that they had no legal right or right by blood or right by lineage but there is a removal this wicked Prince of Israel this is one who should have assumed the crown you would argue by the name but it's the crown is taken away to signify he's unfit to judge I this is one who cannot represent the throne remember how the the scriptures speak of woe to the kingdom whose noble men and kings are eat and and fill their bellies in a time when they ought to be dispensing Justice and they they use the benefits of the crown they use the benefits of the resources of the kingdom and the people to fill their bellies and to lift themselves up when they ought to be committing themselves to judging the people faithfully and faithfully and looking over them as to how they could meet their needs and so there's a character that ought to come when I want ought to have the right character when they wear the crown remember King Lear how he began he got drunk on his crown he was eating uh that's that poison that Darnell in his crown and the removal of a crown is saying you're not fit to rule and you do not represent this Kingdom correctly you cannot represent the throne because the throne ought to be established in righteousness that means that the King's life is how the power of the throne is established not just what he says but what he does not in just how glorious and Powerful he may seem to be but a throne's credibility and even if I can speak this to the men who are here tonight your credibility as ahead your credibility as a leader your credibility as a father and a husband your credibility is one who would assume of office it's established in righteousness in your testimony not just gifts and callings but a life that follows it up that matches it and says this is one who has who's fit to step into that place and this is uh this is just this an incredible scripture to speak to that and brother Branham refers to it this way in the smyrnian church age he writes character as a victory not a gift character now this might be a I don't know if it's going to be a pretty big jump here but character is a victory character is not gifted oh Victory there's some there's something one fought for uh it's a reward it's not by Grace I give you and I bestow upon you apart from works and apart from effort and apart from anything I'm going to give you character wouldn't that be awesome right if we could just get it and say I now I lay my head to sleep Lord give me Victory character Lord give me character and we just wake up full of character and wisdom it's not how it comes characters of Victory not a gift and then he and that's a large statement right just a few words several words there but it holds so much meaning character is something that we arrive at through a fiery trials and the furnace of Affliction and opposition and difficulty and we're winning character if I could just encourage you that when you're suffering when you're sad when you're wrestling with emotions of melancholy or depression or anxiety and you're in the throes of it you're fighting and you're overcoming and you're you're making progress and maybe you get knocked down again I say this just to encourage you that your darkest moments and your most difficult trials they are they have a seed of character within them the one thing you could say for certainty as a son or daughter of God that when I am tried my something in me will step forward as the gold of God and it'll be the character of Christ and whatever the devil puts on you I know it's easy for me to say it when I stand behind the pulpit but I want there maybe something can be ringing within your hearts when you really go through it and just in the throes of emotions and Brokenness even if it be through weeping you'll say Satan I know the Christ's character is going to step forward through this because it's a promise that through our suffering there's a there's a victory and it's character and then he and then he takes this next step statement a man without character can't Reign because of power apart from character satanic this is a statement that has been expressed in millions of ways it's not something that's new in terms of the thought of how there's a lot to say power corrupts and and therefore you would have to have the right kind of character character when you step into power so I don't think this is a strange concept but a man without character cannot reign because power apart from character satanic and therefore the scripture in removing a crown is signifying wrong kind of rule wrong kind of character this would be one who could be moved the wrong way to accomplish the wrong kind of agendas is but Power with character is fit to rule and as a crown is associated with victory and character is a victory I'm just doing a little bit of math on a Wednesday night that the crown is associated with character as a virtuous woman as a crowned or a husband it's her character read proverbs 31 about a virtuous woman it's her character that's his crowning listen she's not a trophy wife because she in the sense that she looks good it's her character I I and that's a that's the beauty of a church is the character of the people that's the strength that we have in our lives is the character that we have characters what we take with us I tried to express that on Sunday that the the very crowns of gold that are upon the heads of the elders it's that character that christ-like character that they took with them they couldn't take any of their wealth they couldn't take any of their possessions but what they could take with them was their character and so character is a victory crowns are associated with Victory therefore this crowning of Christ this victory of Christ represents character the crown is symbolic of power and symbolic of character and in Revelations chapter 6 verse two I don't believe I have these scriptures maybe on the slide but remember how that the Antichrist Spirit goes riding out on a white horse and the Bible says they crown was given unto him there's there's not there's not an implication and and you say well it's just saying it's given and we could break down the we could get the Diagon out and we could break down the the Greek word and what I'm going to posit to you for you to study and prove whether or not I'm out on a limb here is it was given to him Victory didn't cause him to earn a crown because as he's given a crown and there's even in the Bible the crowns with no kingdoms all right so there's something superficial about this there's some pretense it's posturing that's going forward with us the crown was given him and he went forth conquering and to conquer and there's the clue he wore the crown before he conquered he put it on to have this inference of authority so that it could conquer where think of the what happens with Christ the crown and even as we might get into it later the first crowning war was the crown of thorns and he wore a crown of thorns and conquered and bought it and bought the paid the price as a mighty conqueror and here Satan puts the crown on first going out to conquer and this is satanic rule this is that present this is a presumptuous Crown this is that sense of entitlement where he feels that he has a right to it and I I say this to challenge all of us lest we ever get conceited or built up in our uh get lifted up a little bit in ourselves that we don't we don't get drunk on our own crowns and and take the Christ take the Christ out of the things we're feeding on and lift ourselves up and I believe it was brother loyal that was sharing this with me recently uh within maybe just the work culture how this the sense of entitlement once it gets shed then someone and there's this exists with a lot of people these days right because Justice and rights and I deserve this and I haven't right to that and there's a sense of that you owe it to me and you ought to give it to me and really we've got to shed this sense of entitlement in terms of uh what what God wants us to accomplish and we're not just going to be laying around getting it because this sense of entitlement carries with it this vanity of satanic rule I I I feel restrained in my words because that's that's not what I'm necessarily wanting to project is our attitude at this moment but how that Satan presumptually took this Crown put it on and then went out to conquer he didn't earn the crown he was given the crown and told to go conquer I think brother Branham when he looks at the scriptures I tried to read everywhere where these things are being mentioned he said he's playing the part of a hypocrite this is him playing the part of the hypocrite what does that mean he is telling you he wants you to see that he's got a bow in his hand and assume he's got arrows he wants you to see that he's got a crown on his head and assume he's a king there's something menacing about it Satan walks about as a roaring lion right this is the pretense this is hypocrisy this is the sense of entitlement these are the things that we need to shed and get away from because that's the that's not the right kind of character so on his head were many crowns I want you to see yourself in your life the life that you live as being a crown to Christ and it's represented in that image of this one riding on a white horse this is representative of the Bride because we ventured into this a little bit on Sunday it says and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself we looked at this from the perspective of us being associated with the name uh that our names being engraving in his hands and the image of us being in his hands and no man could pluck and claim them from theirselves claim them for themselves and so we looked at that in the sense that no man knows no man knew himself no man can claim you no man can own you and so there's that image in type of you now in Isaiah chapter 4 verse 1 . so what you see he had a name written and and notice the importance of the name so we're going to get into the name now for a few moments and in that day brother Brahm said this date in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying and I think it's good to look at that seven women as representative of climax of Satan's Eden as he's come through his six days and he's achieved his Eden his bride his woman but since he wants to be worshiped as God he does not claim to be Lucifer but he claims to be the son of God claims to be light and now these seven women's women's uh they shall take hold of one men one man saying we will eat our own breads and wear our own apparel now notice what these women's are doing I found a new stick here I these seven women will take a hold of one man they're going to lay claim to him and and this is the deal that they want to bargain I want to claim you and and if I could just dramatize it this way like we're together pretend you're with me don't worry I'll feed myself I'll clothe myself but I need to look like we're together what an offer that was made to Christ and the Temptation in the wilderness he says we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach to be called by the name in this instance then is it seven women who want to lay claim to a man but yet keep keep their independence essentially kind of covered up on the uh hidden called by thy name it signifies a relationship signifies a marriage or Union that by by me being identified with you and being called by your name I want to be identified with your household I want to be identified with your headship and what they're looking for is a pretense of legitimacy this is a woman who has lived however she wants but she wants a crown put on her head to be identified with the throne but maintain her independence maintain her dominance maintain her role maintain her disposition she doesn't want to change and have this pretensive legitimacy hiding the adultery hiding the fornication being the mother of harlots and saying oh yeah he's the daddy these are all his no they're not but they want the pretense of legitimacy these this is what's being reflected here only let us be called by thy name let me say this name must be important if they want to be called by it must be some importance to the name if they want to be called by it the name here in the Hebrew speaks of reputation or fame or Glory we we want to be identified with you it speaks of a memorial or a monument let us make a name for ourselves as it said in Genesis as they built the Tower this is I want fame I want notoriety I want to be seen a certain way this reputation this Fame this Glory let us be called by your name so we can be associated with your character so we can be associated with who you are that yet hiding hiding the adultery in second Chronicles chapter 6 verse 33 I'm just there's so much to be said about a name scripturally if you want to just uh maybe don't do it now um but just think of the songs we sing that edify the name of the Lord and speak about his name and we we should know according to the teacher the message that it's not just Jesus all right it's not just saying it's not just kind of that that structure of words and Jesus being Jehovah savior that's Joshua it's almost there is a recognition in the revelation of the name that transcends just the appellation or the nomination because remember brother Brown says they're Christians and name only there's something to the name and I recognize this in second chronicles 6 33 where Solomon is dedicating the temple and this prayer that he prays so beautiful then hear thou from the heavens even from thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that would now think about the Gentiles because this is who he's talking about that all people of the earth may know thy name and fear thee as death thy People Israel what a what a prayer under the inspiration about the Gentiles and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name God's chosen place of worship God's provided place of worship gives you a lot of Rich teaching on what it means to put your name somewhere and how his chosen place of worship is the place where he puts his name and it's not just a sign on a building it's not just what somebody calls themselves when he says that they may know that this house which I built is called by thy name it's a place that he wants to be associated with him it is then a habitation or Dwelling Place of his presence his name is there that he's there his name is there his power is there if his name is there it's characters there all the rights and privileges associated with the person and his presence if his name is there then he's got to be there the Bible says in Revelations 19 13 and his he was clothed with the Vester dipped in Blood and his name is called now brother man makes the distinction his name isn't the word of God but his name is called the word of God these seven women asking to be called by his name they want the word in name only but they don't want the word only they want to keep their bread and they want to keep their their dress these women want the word in name only not the word only and they want the name it says only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach now that's striking they want the name to take away their shame if they can have the name and be identified with the name then it removes the reproach however you want to look at it in these reproaches of the Old Testament that a woman who's unmarried there's a reproach because this is what she desires to be is to be married so to take the name signifies she's married and then and taking the name and then being married she wants to have to be Barren as a reproach and so she this is the idea behind marriage is to Bear children but her children are illegitimate so she wants to take the reproach away of fornication this is this is what she's looking for she wants to hide her sins she wants to hide her adultery she wants to hide who she really is this mystery Babylon is full of all the sins but once the pretense of somebody glorious and Powerful when she wants the name she wants the name to take away the shame and reproach because a name relates to a person's character a name signifies power we say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not just because you recite the Lord Jesus Christ but it's something behind the name that oh noma in the in the Greek for name it's to be used the name when you say it the name it's used for everything which the name covers you say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not the Linguistics and the syllables and the phonics of the Lord Jesus Christ but it's everything thought or the feeling of which is aroused in the Mind by hearing the name somebody's never heard of Jesus Christ you say the Lord Jesus Christ you say slow down a little bit what was that never heard it before why is it that demons are subject to the name it's not because of our accent it's not because of the way the Lord Jesus Christ and I held my hands a certain way and I did certain symbols no it's because they know the power behind the name and when that's evoked there's some something aroused by hearing that name and that's those things that relate to one's rank Authority interest pleasure commands Excellence as Deeds when you think of the name you want to think oh the name of the Lord Jesus Christ covers everything that Jesus Christ is and and that's the word which is eternal power which is endless when one uses a name character is attributed when you're called by a name only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach therefore if we can be called by your name then we assume the assumption is oh if they have the name they have the character are you listening right if you heard that my nickname was stretch right or long legs and you never met me before you think oh he must be tall all right that must be it must be tall I I was going to start getting a nickname from high school probably not a good idea none of them were mine but I had a knew somebody whose nickname was two I always call them two he was a cool dude he's called two because he was as dark as two o'clock in the morning and that's what everybody in stop six called him and I was like where did we get this name from too and that's how names evolve there's some characteristic associated with it and there's a character attributed to a name now what these women are doing is remarkable then I feel like you're all with me you're just right there with me and it's it's 8 10 that's what the iPad's telling me thank you Siri and I was just waiting for your welcome I don't know if this iPad is set up for that and there's a there's something remarkable about this thing because let's say this woman I'm using I'm bringing in Revelation 17 and 18 to describe these women the mother of Harlot so we're kind of that's the image I hope that we all have here on Wednesday nights you guys have taken in all these Services we've been on through this that there's these women are saying well this is the reality of who I am but if I can somehow co-opt your name and get your name then my reproach and shame will be taken away but if you think about it taking a name resolves nothing it's a false Revelation unless there's true character there it's a trap unless the characters there it's satanic unless the name matches what's on the inside it's hypocrisy it's pretense it's too much out front or there's a lot of show it's that presumption of put a crown on them write them up put them on a white horse and he's going out with a bow and going out to conquer and he was successful in doing it with even out any arrows why because they used the pretense of the church and the power of Christ and the word of God and the scripture so just taking the name resolves nothing and the sermon painted Faith face Jezebel I need to do some tongue exercises before before I preach now Jezebel that's the name that makes everybody shiver just to say Jezebel isn't that a name that's becoming like I I don't know where it is in the naming charts but I've heard people naming their kids Jezebel these days not among people that we know but it's what's wrong with Delilah what's wrong with Jezebel well brother Branham touches on it here he said that was just a common name just a name like Martha Ruth or Mary or some other name he said well my child's name Ruth and say well have you considered Jezebel it's just another common name I think there is a little bit of a pro tip here if you like a name don't tell anybody because somebody's going to try to ruin it for you oh I went to school with the Todd yeah right and they just gonna it's gonna make it okay well I guess not wasn't that a Disney dog but when they or was that the fox I can't remember but that was just a common name just like Martha Ruth or Mary or some other name but when they just hear the name Jezebel it was all because of one woman took the wrong road now I'd imagine Jezebel just because she had the name of Jezebel didn't make her what she was this this the statements I'm going to read you might feel like oh well that's contradictory a true name ought to identify one's true character so the name that he has is true the name the woman wants that's not that doesn't represent who she really is he says the name of Jezebel didn't make her what she was it wasn't her name that did that it was her attitude that's what made it right and that's what can become of a name if you even think Joshua is Jesus then think of what that name means now because the character that came behind it the attitude that embraced it and redeemed it and the name shouldn't make a shiver like the attitude that she took ought to make you shiver right and try to take on any name we want but if the character's not changed right you could take any Ricky and nickname him or change his name to Benjamin but it doesn't change his character but you mentioned Jezebel and the name should make a shiver like the attitude that she took to make you shiver but you mentioned Jezebel ooh my but mentioned some of her sin oh well that's all right knows what's happened as the name theologically or biblically people are Christians like oh Jezebel she was a wicked Queen she was a wicked woman and said well did you know what her sins were it's like come on is that really what we're worried about well then what what's wrong with the name it makes you Sherry says but you mentioned Jezebel who am I but you mentioned her sin oh well that's all right it wasn't the name that made her it was her sin that made her what she was he says and I'm reading these not to contradict but just so you think of this layer your name don't make you what you are it's your character that makes you then your character molds you and makes you what you are then it's not just the name the name doesn't make the character the character makes the name anybody you know the women want the name oh well you've got the name but the name doesn't make the character the character makes the name if I could say this the women haven't taken the name of Christianity have profaned Christianity and made it something ugly people who've taken the name of Jesus Christ have turned it into a cuss word now there's no respect for it because of the way people live the way people have used it the way people have abused people and marginalized and the people are leaving Christianity and turning their backs on Christianity in in many ways is attributed to the the characters that have been associated with it says you the name doesn't make you what you are it's your character that makes you and your character molds you and makes you what you are therefore if you put a name to it it's the character that made the name so the name represents character I hope you can see how I built that that a name that matches the character builds the name therefore when you think of Jezebel the name Jezebel is reflective of her character it's not just the name it's the character associated with it she built that name then Jesus then he's the Builder as a son he's a builder of the family name John chapter 17 verse 26. he says I have declared unto them thy name the father's name I came in my father's name it wasn't that he just had a a name written on his forehead or it was just wasn't that the father's name only is just a a certain nomination but it's his character I've declared unto them thy name and will declare it I think that prophetic element of that that the love where thou has loved me may be in them and I in them something about u19 I've declared thy name and when he declares it again there's some uniting of love him and us and he and he and us and us and him he says I've declared thy name in other words I've manifested God's character I I've expressed his attributes I've demonstrated the rights and powers that are only applicable to God and what I want to read a few statements just to drive this home when he says that they had a name written that no man knew but he himself the name has something to do with the life you live that the name is called the word of God then a life lived by the word is the word expressed that there's a character that we ought to take you want to call yourself a Believer then live the life you want to call yourself a Christian then live the life you want to say that you love everybody and you want to do this and you want to do that then do it live it because to declare a name is to manifest the attributes well the bam in the sermon the voice of God in the last day say you say what difference does the name mean why sure it means something your name characterizes your life there's that the name represents something the name is associated with one's nature and attributes remember was very curious be careful what you name your kids not because I recognize this because the name you give well then make can make them susceptible to how things are formed in their lives and what reputations they have I know sometimes this is why some of us struggle with the name way we were given and maybe we want to change the spelling and and we want to do things different because we think of our names in certain ways but yet the name you're given an opportunity you're given an opportunity just as Cain had a son named Enoch but that's not the one we think about we think of the one that's the the seventh from Adam because his character lifted the name up his character demonstrated the Purity and the life behind it and so a name is associated with one's nature and character and attributes and that's why we're careful with the name we give because the spirits that can be Associated the the power we put ourselves under is that not true and how we speak of our own children say oh well that's my stubborn one and the one over there who's really wants to be compliant is like wait I'm the stubborn one oh okay right and then you have somebody over there just as ordinary as anything well that's my weird one they're like Oh Come the weird one and they just think that's gonna become what you say about them the tough one you know that you might have a daughter that loves to get up early he's like oh she sleeps in and she's just in the room going I wonder when it's good to get out all right because she doesn't want to she's got to let reputation live up to a name to live up to just using these things to express that a name means something his name unveils a life it unveils a power I'm laying all this as a foundation to get into Kingdom character Kingdom order Kingdom Life a name then is either associated with it or it hides it the name is either identifying the character or the name is used to hide something that the name that they don't have that's in the name says the church name is associated with the nature of its character did you notice the sir Smyrna meaning bitter this is when he preaches the revelation of Jesus Christ so the church name is associated with the nature of its character and you notice each one of the church now it's the church name has nothing to do with the character it's the church name has something to do with the character of the church this is why God chose chooses this church in Smyrna this is the the attributes and characteristics associated with that are reflective of the age and he says the church name has something to do with the character of the church now let's put on our spiritual thinking caps as brother Branham is preaching in Branham Tabernacle he says I could say something here but I better not because you'd get me wrong your name does too you might not know but it does you're saying there's something that's to a name and I I speak this openly because I don't believe these things are being done in private that they're being done publicly but the BR the Branham Tabernacle has become only a memorial to brother Branham that's that's what it's become because there's something to a name and name it Branham Tabernacle God allowed brother Branham to do it it's descriptive in it and it fit he was the founder of it but watch where it leads and where it ends up and I don't believe that there's any shame or reproaching in the way that I'm saying it because I think these things are out there and they're very vocal and very public about what they're trying to lift up and who they point to and who they're following and what the sum and substance is and I there's certain things maybe that uh we could just begin to draw from that and conclude from that but the name means something and maybe I'm venturing out a little bit but he says I could say something here but I better not and what I thought of is the fact that the church name was Branham and what it becomes because there's something to a name now I know that's just everything I've been saying about a name whether Jezebel uh there's names associated with character your name is what makes you that's just a giant field right but if you could somehow pick it all together to back up there's a name written there's a name that you take on there's a name there's a name that you bear and God says and Jesus says I've declared unto them thy name and will declare it there's this prophecy a prophetic element to this I've declared it but I will declare it again again I've declared unto them thy name and if I could say this I will when he says I will declare it again and I'm just building off a vast reservoir of statements and scriptures I have declared unto thine them thy name and he says his prayers that the love that thou Hast loved me may be in them and I in them so it says I pray that they would be one as we are one he says at that day you shall know that I am in the father you and me and I and you and brother says what day this day when the Revelations made known so when he says I will declare it again if he's going to declare it and he says and I am in them then it's not necessarily just being declared unto us but be declared through us it's something that's going to be declared in us that we become the Declaration of Jesus Christ that we become the bearers of his life he has no eyes but your eyes he has no hands but your hands he has no feet but your faith he has no voice but your voice that we become the body and the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ in the last days the Bible says in Acts 15 14 that all the people may of the earth may know thy name they know that this house which I built is called by thy name this Prophecy in the Old Testament of Gentiles coming to thy light semen have declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles why did God visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name it's just right there it's right there in the scripture why is God going to visit the Gentiles why is God pouring out his Spirit upon the Gentiles why is God bringing and birthing into the body of Christ uh Gentiles to get a people for his name in other words God's going to give them a crown he's going to give them a name gonna give them power gonna give a crown to she who's right it is going to call a people out for his name that means they're Worthy of his name ones who's right it is ones who are elected out of the earth and predestinate to this the ones who could recognize the rightful position the right place in the Kingdom oh I believe so much of the word is not one is to have this false humility well I'm just not worth it and I'm just really a nobody and it just becomes seeds of compromise as it become sore spots for the devil to work in yeah that's right you're not worthy that's why you're gonna die of cancer right wait I'm sorry that's the wrong voice you're right you're not worthy I know kind of stroke that and pet that a little bit but one who's right it is brother I'm taking this scripture in Jehovah Jireh part one said this Covenant has to be confirmed with the Royal Seed of Abraham and think of the confirmation of the Covenant with the Royal seed and the signs and wonders that are given through his ministry which are the people out of the Gentiles not Jews a people out of the Gentiles for his namesake taking it for his name the church that's got his name will come back into him the church that has his name the ones whose position it is who's right it is will come back then because that's who she is her life it'll come back to that he says and why little Bethlehem he says oh my goodness I didn't realize I had this many notes I'm sorry he says the bride will be made up of gentiles the Gentile he'll take a people out for his namesakes that's his name he took a wife out of the Gentiles so he says I want to take a people for my namesake he says I want to get a bride out of the peoples of the earth I want to get a bride out of Nations spread out of the whole Earth this is what I've done in natural type to Israel I am now going to do spiritually to the people of the whole earth because I have elected them out of the earth and they're going to be called by my name in other words he's taken a wife and when he takes a wife when there's a union oh think of this how much there is to this when he takes a wife that's the day of his gladness and the uniting time when he's there eating wedding soup with his wife that's the time that the crown of gladness is there upon his head Hallelujah that's the time he says oh I'm excited this is when I'm happy this is my crown of rejoicing because this is one who can bear my name part three this is just two days after he had said this church that's got his name will come back into him he says shown here plainly the Royal seed bride will not be called by the church denominational she-goat sacrifice no but by him I'm using these statements just to summarize scripture so that we could be quick he says the man of but by him the manifested word of the RAM for he is the word and the realm not called he said not called by her name by her name but called by his name he'd take a people out of the Gentiles not for her name but for his name would bear his name oh my what are you afraid of it then for then why should we be afraid of it if the name in the instance here where if he's not how people don't want to baptize in his name they don't want to pray in his name if they're some kind of scarecrow given to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ his name is the Lord Jesus Christ his character that name covers all that he is he is the word that's what we can read over and over and organ he is the word he is the word he is the word then why should we be afraid of the word don't let the devil put any scare in you when it comes to the word of God let him not put a scare in you at all of anything that's in the word of God he says what are you afraid of it for then a gentile would bear his name the ram not her name the church not she but he he says hallelujah Hallelujah we'll invite our musicians to come as I read this lengthy statement from the God of this evil age I think this will just be a great place to stop he says now notice closely now as we study the word the God of this evil age that we're now living he repeats this phrase a few times he says it may seem strange a very strange thing in this age of Grace when God has taken a people for his namesake that his bride in this evil age that he should that should be called the age of evil and it's strange that the age when the bride is being taken out that Satan has become the god of this evil age that intake Satan's Eden and marriage and divorce and a lot of things that he's preaching that amplify some of these thoughts he said the very age that God is calling a people for his namesake by grace and out is called an evil age let me say this the bride is called out of laodicea the very age that God's calling the people out for his namesake called out of an evil age now we'll prove it by the Bible that this is the age that he was speaking of very strange thing to think that in an evil age like this that God then would be calling his bride did you notice he said to people not a church why yet it's called the church but he would call a people oh she said that I would call a people for his name I believe this is very important [Music] God has ordained local churches to feed his body but let's not turn him into fig leaves [Music] he says call to church but he would call a people now a church is a gathered of many people of all different makeups but God is calling one here he and his Al call Methodist Baptist Pentecostal he said he'd call a people what for his name a people one from the Methodist one from the Baptist one from the Lutheran one from the Catholics see but he's calling not a church group but a people for his name that receives his name engaged in his name going to a wedding to be married to him to become a part of him by predestination oh Hallelujah just as a man that chooses the right wife in life was ordained to be part of his body so the bride of Christ will be and is now from old ordained by God to be a part of that body it says oh the scriptures are so rich full of honey this is what Christ has done just as a man chooses the wife and in choosing her she's identified with him and therefore if she's shameful she's rottenness in his bones but if she's virtuous she's a crown to him because a woman reflects a man's character God's calling one in this evil age to be his wife not the church group I if the spirit will be so closely to see the elective very if possible and we're not all just refusing to ever go to Rome unless we get dirty right like it's not the Catholic church it's it even tries to impersonate the word of God at the highest levels don't say that to try to scare you [Music] I say that just to awaken us to this desire oh Lord [Music] I I need you more than ever before I need you I call it a church group it's not just in the church name it's not just in a collection of churches or a group of uh of ministers or a collection of fellowships it's got to be you as an individual that finds your satisfaction in Christ I need to read this in the sermon the unveiling of God if you could just ready yourselves in your hearts just to close the service and we'll be going to the baptism soon for the rest is every Parable in the Bible every type of the Bible is made manifest right here before us wow he said that he's to confirm the Covenant to the Gentiles think of what this message of the hour is doing the same God in the pillar of fire that wrote the Bible both in the Old Testament and New Testament is right here in manifesting it showing just exactly what it was interpreted it right back to make sure that it's the interpretation we've got the interpretation then let's see it happen I love that we've got it we've got the interpretation I believe we can say we do have today that which is perfect he says then let's see it happen see that's it let's see it made manifest manifest Jesus said if I do not the works of my father Believe Me Not see it's got to be proven listen to me now as I read this but now not proven like Jesus they put a rag around his head and hit him on the head saying if you're a prophet tell us who hit you what were they doing they dressed him up as a king and were mocking him says if you're the Son of God turn this bread up King of the Jews King of the Jews all the devil wants you to try to play the part of a queen he says see that's the devil if you're the Son of God come off that so he says not that he says I mean the Revelation that he's supposed to do that's what it is notice how there's a spirit that may want wants you to clown for the devil do this do that he says no no it's it's not those things it's going to prove it what the Revelation says you're supposed to do what the Revelation says you're supposed to do and he says but now as Revelation 10 is revealed mysteries of God are made manifest known as the seven sealed book promised now let your faith in him who is the word because in Revelation 19 when he comes he's going to be called the word of God and upon a white horse and the followers of heaven will be behind him now what a statement what a statement now I know that maybe there's a construct that's going to push Revelations 10 all the way for the open of the seventh seal push it all the way forward after the time of the change after the Rapture even maybe you try to push it all away till after uh when we're coming back in the Millennium and just try to set the picture that way but what he says next tells me that if there's any truth to that that's another thing but there's a truth to the fact that Revelations 10 is history and that the very events of this Mighty Angel descending with the book open to reveal the mysteries of God has something to do with me becoming the voice has something to do with me eating the book and taking on his life and his character and he says Revelation 10 let your faith in him who is the word because in Revelation 19 let your faith in him who is the word because he who in Revelation 19 will come riding on a white horse called the word of God let your faith in him who is the word he says break the denominational veil of Education break the denominational veil of tradition break those veils that's hiding him from you [Music] it now break the veils he's a veil breaker are you listening to me tonight he says break those veils of Pride you women your King's Daughters act like it live like it whose name is called the word of God let him break every Veil he says break every bill no matter what PhD and lld says if it's contrary to that Bible breakthrough that Veil [Music] we've crossed the Riven Veil we're on the other side now on the other side and you will see if you'll just do that break those old traditions and things that come to him you'll see him standing why don't they see him standing too many Traditions why don't we see him standing too many Traditions he says you'll see him standing the mighty conqueror the Word of Promise for this age May manifest you will see the Mighty God unveiled see him right Among Us here unveiled the Mighty God unconquered by traditions oh is he here writing now is he here now to break veils and traditions and notice he says break the veils of pride and if I could say he says you women let me say break the break the veils because we're Kings or the king's wife act like it look at the King's children live like it Hallelujah stand with me now [Music]
