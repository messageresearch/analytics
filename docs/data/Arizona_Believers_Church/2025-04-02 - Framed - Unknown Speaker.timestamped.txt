[0:00] Exodus 12 verse 7 and then we will read
[0:03] verse 13. And they shall take of the
[0:07] blood. This is that the blood of that
[0:08] lamb without blemish of the first year.
[0:11] And they shall take of the blood and
[0:13] strike it on the two side post and on
[0:16] the upper doorpost of the houses wherein
[0:19] they shall eat it. So that blood which
[0:21] has been applied to the
[0:23] doorframe, it says in verse 13, "And the
[0:27] blood shall be to you for a token upon
[0:29] the houses where ye are. And when I see
[0:32] the blood, I'll pass over you, and the
[0:34] plague shall not be upon you to destroy
[0:36] you when I smite the land of Egypt." If
[0:40] we could just bow our heads in a word of
[0:42] prayer. Heavenly Father, thank you for
[0:43] this opportunity we have this evening to
[0:46] take a hold of your word and read it and
[0:48] to be able to understand it even with
[0:50] the human language, the ability to read.
[0:53] Lord, we we're not dismissive of that,
[0:54] Lord. We just believe that's a a gift.
[0:57] But Lord, to give us the spiritual
[0:58] understanding. My Lord, that's something
[1:00] only you can do. And we pray now, Lord,
[1:02] that as we've read your word that you
[1:04] would now make it alive to us by
[1:05] revelation. Impart to us those things
[1:07] which are needful. Lord, we do not
[1:09] desire to preach anything new, but we do
[1:12] want you to search our hearts and to
[1:15] bring out greater depths and make
[1:16] yourself known to us in a more intimate
[1:18] way. So, Father, if you would do that,
[1:20] we'll be happy. We ask this in the name
[1:22] of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You
[1:25] can have your
[1:30] seats. My my title this evening is
[1:32] framed. And as you could see there, uh,
[1:36] there's a frame that's a little bit offc
[1:38] center. And so by doing that, I'm kind
[1:40] of signaling where I'm wanting to go
[1:42] with this. Uh, but keep you keep in mind
[1:44] as we've been on this series over the
[1:46] past uh, few months, we've been on the
[1:48] subject of art. I'll come back to that
[1:49] here in a moment. Uh, but my title is
[1:52] framed. And I want to read this from the
[1:54] token sermon right at the beginning so
[1:57] you can see where I'm focusing on this.
[1:59] As we read in Exodus 12 on the blood,
[2:02] which is a token, Brother Brham said, he
[2:05] expects us now to display the token over
[2:08] our faith. And this is something he says
[2:09] over and over again in the token sermons
[2:12] that he ministers that the token is to
[2:14] be displayed. What's remarkable is how
[2:16] he says it's to be displayed to Satan's
[2:19] group and the unbelievers and cults and
[2:21] so forth that don't believe in it. And
[2:24] as we've been ministering on, sin is
[2:26] unbelief. And so if you disbelieve,
[2:28] that's the sin. And so we have faith,
[2:31] genuine faith, and we're to display the
[2:33] token over our faith to the unbelievers
[2:36] and cults that don't believe in it. That
[2:38] we believing what he has said of his
[2:40] promises and that Jesus Christ has
[2:42] raised up from the dead, showing himself
[2:45] alive. And that is the badge, the token
[2:48] of identification. So brother Ben and
[2:51] God identifying himself by his
[2:52] characteristics. So he displays his
[2:55] characteristics. So he's putting his
[2:56] life on display. He said the token of
[2:59] identification because it's Christ's own
[3:01] life in you identifying the word. It
[3:05] doesn't need anything else. So when we
[3:07] have our faith and then we display the
[3:09] token over our faith, it is Christ on
[3:12] display. And it's even to the
[3:14] unbelievers and the cults, those that
[3:16] don't believe in it. It's a badge. And
[3:18] it says here in verse 7 in Exodus 12,
[3:21] this is the token. And he says, "And
[3:22] they shall take of the blood and strike
[3:26] it on the two side post and on the upper
[3:28] doorpost of the house wherein they shall
[3:30] eat it. Where the lamb is being eaten,
[3:32] where the lamb is being parttook of the
[3:34] pascal lamb, which is even a type of
[3:36] Christ as you're feeding on that
[3:38] unfailing body word of the son of man,
[3:40] the blood was to be applied and it says
[3:43] on the two side post and the upper
[3:45] doorpost of the house." And that this is
[3:47] a very precise commandment. He doesn't
[3:49] say spread it on your driveway. doesn't
[3:52] say put it wherever you want or hang it
[3:53] like Christmas lights. He says put it on
[3:56] the door frame. Put it on the exterior
[3:58] of the two side post and the upper door
[4:00] post of the house so that it will be on
[4:03] display on the outside. And so the
[4:06] blood, I want you to catch this. The
[4:08] blood is actually going to frame the
[4:11] entrance. as the blood would be applied
[4:13] to the to uh the post and over the top.
[4:16] That blood would then drip and be shed
[4:18] to even if you stepped through that
[4:20] house, you're stepping over the blood.
[4:22] If you step if you leave the house,
[4:24] you're stepping over the blood to get to
[4:26] get out of the house where the lamb is
[4:27] being parttook of. And so when he says
[4:30] that we are to display the token to the
[4:33] to display the token for us is to live
[4:35] our lives in a way that manifest the
[4:37] word of God. We don't come together to
[4:40] talk about the message. We don't come
[4:41] together to talk about the token and
[4:43] it's not a seance that we give over our
[4:45] family members but we come to apply the
[4:48] token. The token being applied is to
[4:51] those doorpost and to the lentil and
[4:53] that blood dripping it framed that door
[4:56] frame would be covered in
[4:57] blood. And so to live the life is is to
[5:01] express and to manifest is to display
[5:04] the token. Now, uh, framing. I want to
[5:07] look at framing a little bit just for
[5:09] this is where we'll get into some of the
[5:10] elements as it relates to, uh, art, but
[5:14] it's a critical part, the frame of a
[5:17] piece of art. As we've been talking
[5:18] about the painting as maybe the more the
[5:21] artwork that we've been focusing on,
[5:22] it's a critical piece to uh, finishing a
[5:25] work of art in order to display it for
[5:26] others to see. And when you want to put
[5:30] up a piece of art, um the artist is
[5:32] going to give some thought as to what
[5:33] type of frame to use and how they want
[5:35] to display it. And so this is a a
[5:38] painting of a museum. And you can see
[5:40] every piece of art in there is framed.
[5:43] Some very ornate and extravagant. You
[5:45] know, there's there's thought that's put
[5:46] into it. The the frame goes with the
[5:48] piece of art to display it in such a way
[5:51] to where it engages the viewer. And so
[5:54] it's critical to finishing the piece of
[5:57] art. And so the frame it can either
[6:00] distract from the work of art or it can
[6:03] actually enhance the work of art. And so
[6:06] the if an artist is actually in some
[6:09] years past I guess a long time ago I
[6:10] almost could get into the history of it.
[6:12] Uh they'd actually have an artist or a
[6:13] craftsman who would make the frame but
[6:16] then they entered a time when the artist
[6:18] himself would pick the frame and look at
[6:20] what would fit and what would be the
[6:21] best thing for it. Because the frame is
[6:23] something that can either detract or
[6:26] take away or devalue what's been painted
[6:29] or it can actually enhance the artwork
[6:33] itself where the framing actually draws
[6:36] the viewer's attention to the subject of
[6:39] the artist work.
[6:42] There's even examples here where the
[6:44] frame
[6:45] itself is adding dimension to the work
[6:48] of art. art. I believe this is in the
[6:49] Philadelphia Museum of Art where the
[6:51] that door frame is actually a physical
[6:53] frame and it creates a 3D image that
[6:56] there's something going on. This is an
[6:59] uh this art frame you see here. It's
[7:01] part of the artwork itself. It gives you
[7:03] this impression that this little boy is
[7:04] leaving the piece of art. Rembrandt even
[7:07] drew this young lady with an art frame
[7:09] where her hands are coming out of the
[7:10] frame. It looks as if the frame is the
[7:13] picture has come
[7:14] alive and
[7:19] I got to remember how to blank
[7:22] it. You'll have to do it for
[7:25] me. The I was reading in one place and I
[7:28] thought this was really good that says
[7:30] art is almost always associated with
[7:32] some sort of border and the border
[7:34] contains the image to divide one scene
[7:36] from another and to help focus the
[7:38] spectator's attention on the scene. And
[7:41] so an artist understands the power of
[7:44] the right frame that it can either take
[7:46] away from the work of art or it can in
[7:49] presenting it enhance it. And brother
[7:52] Brandham and God is his own interpreter
[7:53] says all we are today is the display of
[7:56] his attributes. So if we are the God's
[8:00] wanting to put us on display, there's a
[8:01] number of scriptures we could use to
[8:02] statements to use to show that that God
[8:05] is wanting to display us. And if God's
[8:07] displaying us, then framing is
[8:08] important. Amen. The context matters in
[8:11] terms of God wanting to put us on
[8:13] display. We we we can't just display
[8:15] ourselves wherever we want to be
[8:17] displayed. We cannot just present
[8:19] ourselves any way that we want to be
[8:20] presented. We spend a lot of time going
[8:22] through the scripture on modesty and the
[8:24] way that we appear and what the
[8:26] scripture requires of us in terms of the
[8:28] way that we dress. And it's part of
[8:29] God's framing us in order to be seen as
[8:33] his attributes. without a frame there's
[8:35] compositional elements uh that can feel
[8:38] or appear chaotic. This was an example
[8:40] that I saw uh and I was trying to do it
[8:42] myself with uh maybe Vincent Van Go's
[8:45] sunflowers, but I found uh leave this to
[8:47] the professionals. that this is a work
[8:50] of art where on one side without the
[8:52] frame it appears chaotic and you're not
[8:55] necessarily sure just ex maybe uh you
[8:57] you can just feel uh it's disjointed but
[9:00] put a frame around it and even the lines
[9:03] and the dimensions and the colors it it
[9:05] begins to fit together a little bit more
[9:07] uh beautifully even in photography
[9:11] framing uses natural and artificial
[9:13] elements to focus on the subject where
[9:16] if you really want to take good pictures
[9:18] on your iPhone. Isn't it amazing? You
[9:20] get a camera in your phone that can take
[9:22] professional pictures, film movies, and
[9:24] then when you use it, it's a dud. Why?
[9:27] Because there's more to it than just
[9:28] snapping, right? There. You got to know
[9:30] how to frame the subject. And in in
[9:34] doing so, there's a way that enhances
[9:36] the viewer's pleasure in looking at the
[9:38] picture you took. That's the difference
[9:39] between a photographer and somebody who
[9:41] owns a camera is somebody who knows how
[9:43] to use certain elements and the and
[9:45] certain rules to enhance uh the picture
[9:49] and a way that it makes you feel drawn
[9:51] into the subject of the picture. So
[9:54] framing is incredibly powerful even in
[9:57] how we view people even how we
[10:00] understand certain arguments how we
[10:02] judge and understand something. Framing
[10:05] is how we uh it can be used to cause a
[10:08] misunderstanding when it comes to
[10:09] certain things or the right kind of
[10:11] framing can give us understanding of
[10:13] something.
[10:16] My son Elliot's been reading a book
[10:17] called the power of context. One of the
[10:20] things that comes up a lot if you're
[10:22] looking at the uh the false attribution
[10:25] error and and and the missing something
[10:29] in context is the way it's framed.
[10:32] And you could take something I think our
[10:34] our kids are really really good at this
[10:36] in terms of framing something in a way
[10:38] to where it leads you to the conclusion,
[10:40] well of course you can stay up all night
[10:41] and eat ice cream if that's if that's
[10:43] really where things are. But there's a
[10:45] way that if you frame it correctly, the
[10:47] right kind of frame brings things into
[10:49] view. And so that's the power of
[10:51] context. You take something out of
[10:52] context and you put it in a different
[10:54] frame, it paints a different picture. So
[10:56] you want to have the right kind of frame
[10:58] to understand what God is wanting to do.
[11:01] even understand a personal situation.
[11:03] Framing is important, shapes our
[11:06] understanding of situations. It changes
[11:08] the feeling we have in certain
[11:09] interactions based upon the context.
[11:12] And brother Brandham said all this is
[11:14] just his thinking talking about this the
[11:16] thoughts of God and his attributes. But
[11:17] we're the display of his thoughts of
[11:20] what it was. We are the display of God's
[11:23] character. And so if God is going to put
[11:25] us on display, then there's some
[11:27] framing. There's a context that he gives
[11:29] it in order for us to fulfill the
[11:32] purpose he has in in framing us. Amen.
[11:36] Now, in Numbers chapter 34, and this is
[11:37] where I'm just picking up on some things
[11:39] from Sunday, and as we were looking at
[11:43] uh in I think the
[11:45] uh cosmetic Christians, that's it. I had
[11:48] to go through my uh my analog of makeup
[11:52] brands. But cosmetic Christians is uh is
[11:56] what we ministered on Sunday and that
[11:58] false front things that are
[11:59] superficially Christian. And on Numbers
[12:02] 34 12-13 and brother John if you could
[12:05] just follow me. I don't really have I
[12:07] don't know where some of these slides
[12:08] will land, but I just trust you to
[12:09] follow these. It says, "And the border
[12:11] shall go down to Jordan." He's just
[12:13] describing the promised land. and the
[12:15] border shall go down to Jordan, and the
[12:17] goings out of it shall be at the salt
[12:19] sea. That's the the Dead Sea. This shall
[12:22] be your land with the coast thereof
[12:24] roundabout. And Moses commanded the
[12:27] children of Israel, saying, "This is the
[12:29] land which ye shall inherit by lot,
[12:31] which the Lord commanded to give unto
[12:33] the nine tribes, and to half tribe, the
[12:36] half tribe." Now, you realize it's not
[12:38] 12.
[12:39] It's this nine and a half tribes are
[12:41] going to get take the land by lot that
[12:43] the Lord commanded. And this eastern
[12:46] border that's being described is the
[12:48] Jordan. You may go down to Jordan.
[12:50] That's the Jordan River. 156 mile long
[12:53] river stretching from the Sea of Galilee
[12:55] to the Dead Sea. It's mentioned nearly
[12:57] 200 times in scripture. I believe around
[12:59] 180 in the Old Testament, 15 in the New
[13:01] Testament. And it's a significant geolog
[13:04] geological uh feature. There's a lot of
[13:07] history with respect to his geography.
[13:09] But it's also a symbolic type. In Joshua
[13:12] 1:es 1, 2, and 3, it says, "Now after
[13:14] the death of Moses, the servant of the
[13:16] Lord, it came to pass that the Lord
[13:18] spake unto Joshua the son of Nun,
[13:19] Moses's minister, saying, Moses, my
[13:22] servant, is dead. Now therefore arise,
[13:25] go over this Jordan, thou and all this
[13:28] people, unto the land which I do give to
[13:30] them, even to the children of Israel,
[13:33] every place that the sole of your foot
[13:35] shall tread upon, that have I given unto
[13:37] you, as I said unto Moses. So his
[13:40] commandment is cross the Jordan. This
[13:43] message I gave to Moses, it's brought
[13:44] you to the border. Now Moses is not
[13:47] going to cross over with you, but
[13:48] everything he said in his message was
[13:51] true. And God himself quotes Moses over
[13:54] and over and over again. So Joshua
[13:56] didn't have a new message. He is
[13:57] actually quoting the mo Moses and God
[14:00] quotes Moses to understand what Joshua
[14:02] is doing in that time. So he's to cross
[14:05] Jordan to go into the land which that
[14:08] God gave him even the children of
[14:10] Israel. And every place the soul of your
[14:11] foot shall tread that will I give as I
[14:14] said unto Moses. So he's saying as Moses
[14:16] said as Moses said. Right? And so the
[14:20] promised land is on, if I could say
[14:23] scriptural phrase, this side of Jordan.
[14:26] So when you're looking at this here,
[14:28] this red line, I actually had to hand
[14:30] draw that on uh just to show it on this
[14:33] side. And maybe for some of the young
[14:35] ones, you realize that when the children
[14:37] of Israel crossed the Jordan River, they
[14:39] weren't coming uh headed east out of
[14:41] Egypt, but they had came around on the
[14:43] east side of Jordan and entered heading
[14:46] west across the Jordan to enter the
[14:49] promised land. So, this is where the
[14:51] nine and a half tribes were going to
[14:53] settle. And we know that uh Manasseh and
[14:56] and Gad, half of Manasseh and Gad and
[14:59] Reuben settle on the east side of the
[15:01] Jordan River.
[15:04] And so the Jordan River is a border of
[15:07] this land that God promised in Joshua
[15:10] chapter 18 19 and 20. And the border
[15:13] passed along to the side of Beth Bethl
[15:16] northward and the outgoings of the
[15:18] border were at the north bay of the bay
[15:20] of the sea of salt sea at the south end
[15:23] of Jordan. This was the south coast and
[15:27] Jordan was the border of it on the east
[15:29] side. This was the inheritance of the
[15:32] children of Benjamin by the coast
[15:33] thereof roundabout according to their
[15:35] families. I believe it was in blessing
[15:37] Benjamin that he was described as a
[15:39] fierce wolf. And so they were known a as
[15:42] fighters and they're positioned and
[15:44] placed here on this borderland because
[15:47] it would actually kind of forms a
[15:48] funnel. You have the Sea of Galilee, you
[15:50] have the Dead Sea. And so if there's a a
[15:51] place for the enemy to enter because you
[15:53] got the coast over here, it it's a place
[15:55] that would even funnel the attack of the
[15:57] enemy and it places Benjamin right
[15:59] there. That's right. To be on that
[16:02] border. And so when you look at this, I
[16:05] want you to think of this. It's not just
[16:06] a geographical boundary, but it has it's
[16:09] a spiritually symbolic. It's spiritually
[16:11] symbolic.
[16:13] On this side of Jordan is the promised
[16:16] land. But there's a phrase you'll find
[16:18] it's beyond Jordan. And beyond Jordan's
[16:22] to the right of that line. And there in
[16:24] that in that place beyond Jordan is the
[16:28] wilderness.
[16:29] And we could take a lot of time to just
[16:31] express to you what the wilderness was,
[16:32] but the what the wilderness represents,
[16:34] but it represented wondering,
[16:36] aimlessness, right? Fussing and arguing
[16:39] a a amongst themselves. And it
[16:41] represents death. Even brother Brandham
[16:44] says that Jordan represents death.
[16:45] Itself in certain types represents
[16:47] death. And so to go beyond Jordan or to
[16:51] be on the other side of Jordan is to be
[16:54] on the wrong side of life and death.
[16:57] It's to be outside of the promise. In
[16:58] Deuteronomy 30 18 to20, I denounce unto
[17:02] you this day that you shall surely
[17:04] perish that you shall not prolong your
[17:06] days upon the land, whether thou passeth
[17:08] over Jordan to go to possess it. That's
[17:11] the focus. I want you to think of this.
[17:13] God is always mentioned where he's
[17:14] bringing them. God does anything in the
[17:17] journey, if he does anything in the
[17:18] wilderness, it's not because he really
[17:20] loves the wilderness and wants to make
[17:21] the journey uh comfortable. It's because
[17:23] there is a there's a destination he's
[17:25] wanting to bring them to. And he says,
[17:27] "I call heaven and earth to record this
[17:29] day against you that I have set before
[17:32] you life and death. And I want you to
[17:35] visualize life and death as being
[17:37] outside the promised land in the
[17:38] promised land. Beyond Jordan or on this
[17:41] side of Jordan, I put before you life
[17:44] and death, blessing and cursing.
[17:45] Therefore, choose life, that both thou
[17:48] and thy seed may live, that thou mayest
[17:50] love the Lord thy God, and that thou
[17:51] mayest obey his voice, and that thou
[17:53] mayest cleave unto him, for he is thy
[17:56] life, and the length of thy days, that
[17:58] thou mayest dwell in the land which the
[18:01] Lord swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham,
[18:03] to Isaac, and to Jacob to give them.
[18:06] Again, that becomes the focus. That
[18:08] becomes the main point is this land
[18:09] which I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac,
[18:11] and Jacob. the land that I promised.
[18:13] That's what's called the promised land
[18:15] or the promised land. He promised to
[18:17] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to their
[18:18] fathers. He says, "I'm wanting to give
[18:20] you. I want to give you this land." So,
[18:22] you've got to choose life.
[18:24] In choosing life, they had to cross over
[18:26] into the promised land. If they don't
[18:28] choose life, they choose death. And
[18:29] Jesus said, "Your fathers did eat man in
[18:31] the wilderness." And everyone are dead
[18:34] because they never entered in the
[18:35] promised land.
[18:37] Now, if you look at Deuteronomy 12, and
[18:39] again, if you have your Bibles, if you
[18:40] could turn there, I'm only providing
[18:43] uh just some summary things in these
[18:45] verses. But beyond Jordan, when I say
[18:48] beyond Jordan, I'm talking about on the
[18:49] east side, the wrong side, the right
[18:51] side, not the left. Maybe that's
[18:53] confusing. Uh the correct side versus
[18:55] the wrong side, but beyond Jordan, there
[18:58] was a life of blessings and provision.
[19:00] But across Jordan, on the correct side
[19:03] of Jordan, was the promise. in
[19:05] Deuteronomy 12 uh 9 to12. For ye are not
[19:09] as yet come to the rest and to the
[19:11] inheritance which the Lord your God
[19:13] giveth you. So notice the promised land
[19:16] is the land of rest. The promised land
[19:18] is the inheritance.
[19:21] But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in
[19:23] the land which the Lord your God giveth
[19:25] you to inherit, and when he giveth you
[19:27] rest from all your enemies round about,
[19:29] so that you dwell in safety, then there
[19:32] shall be a place which the Lord your God
[19:34] shall choose to cause his name to dwell
[19:36] there. Notice the temporary nature of
[19:38] even the tabernacle in the wilderness.
[19:41] There was going to be a place, a temple,
[19:42] a house of the Lord. And it was there
[19:45] that God would put his name. And he says
[19:47] that when you here, you don't have the
[19:49] rest. here. This isn't your inheritance.
[19:51] Even though I may be among you, and I
[19:53] may be blessing you. Then will there be
[19:55] that place that I want to put my name
[19:58] and cause my name to dwell. Thither
[19:59] shall you bring all that I command you,
[20:01] your burnt offerings, and your
[20:02] sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave
[20:04] heave offering of your hand, and all
[20:06] your choice vows, which you vow unto the
[20:07] Lord. Regardless of what had taken place
[20:10] to this point, whether or not God was
[20:12] providing opportunity to do that in the
[20:15] journey, he was always looking forward
[20:17] to this permanent place. Amen. And you
[20:19] shall rejoice before the Lord your God,
[20:21] ye and your sons, and your daughters,
[20:22] and your men's servants, and your maid
[20:23] servants, and the Levite that is within
[20:25] your gates. For as much as he hath no
[20:26] part, nor inheritance with you, he had
[20:28] no part or inheritance in the physical
[20:30] land. But the rest of the land was for
[20:32] all of Israel. Now, we know that God was
[20:35] with them in the pillar of fire, in the
[20:37] cloud by day in the Exodus. God was
[20:40] there. He was blessing them and he was
[20:42] showing signs and wonders in the Exodus.
[20:44] But on the this side of Jordan, once
[20:47] they crossed Jordan, it wasn't just the
[20:49] blessings in the Exodus, but it was his
[20:51] permanent presence. Remember Sunday, we
[20:53] we wanted just to highlight and show
[20:55] that refusing to enter into the promised
[20:57] land is refusing his presence. It's a
[21:00] rejection of God's presence. That's
[21:02] right. So when Israel in the Exodus and
[21:05] in their journey, they come and there's
[21:07] this example in the Exodus. We're taught
[21:09] in the New Testament that there the
[21:10] Exodus is an example to us that we
[21:13] should not lust as they lusted and in
[21:15] unbelief in in not believing because of
[21:17] unbelief they were not able to enter the
[21:19] land and through their unbelief they
[21:21] perished in the wilderness. So it's an
[21:23] example to us to not fall short of the
[21:25] goal. In Joshua chapter 3
[21:29] 14-17, this is that time I want you to
[21:31] kind of see the importance of this of
[21:33] the feature of the Jordan River. But now
[21:34] it's that crossing over. Here's the
[21:37] miracle even in crossing over. And it
[21:39] came to pass when the people removed
[21:40] from their tents to pass over Jordan and
[21:43] the priest bearing the ark of the
[21:44] covenant before the people. And as they
[21:47] that bear the ark were come unto Jordan,
[21:49] and the feet of the priests that bear
[21:50] the ark were dipped in the brim of the
[21:52] water. It says the Jordan overflowth all
[21:55] his banks all the time of harvest. So
[21:57] it's that time of year. The banks of
[21:59] Jordan were flooded in that April time
[22:01] in the uh during this time of the
[22:04] harvest that the waters which came down
[22:06] from above stood and rose up upon a heap
[22:09] very far from the city of Adam, that is
[22:11] beside beside Zeratan. And those that
[22:14] came toward the sea of the plain, even
[22:16] the salt sea, failed and were cut off.
[22:18] And the people passed over right against
[22:21] Jericho. They've they've been damned up.
[22:23] They stood up. A wall that's going this
[22:26] way, a wall going that way. And now he
[22:28] has parted the Jordan River. Parts twice
[22:31] in the scripture here. It's parted. And
[22:33] they're crossing on dry land straight
[22:36] towards Jericho headed west. And the
[22:38] priests that bear the ark of the coming
[22:40] of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in
[22:42] the midst of Jordan. So it is a miracle
[22:45] that the sea stood up that the the river
[22:47] stood up but the ground is firm. That's
[22:50] right. And all the Israelites passed
[22:53] over on dry ground until all the people
[22:55] were passed clean over Jordan. There's a
[22:58] lot of things we could even emphasize in
[23:00] this story here and just how uh how
[23:03] wonderful of a story it is. But the
[23:05] Bible tells us that this Exodus begin in
[23:07] the month of
[23:08] Nissan. The the the Exodus starts if you
[23:12] look at Exodus 12:2. This month shall be
[23:14] unto you the beginning of months. It
[23:17] shall be the first month of the year for
[23:19] you. What was taking place at that time?
[23:21] They were eating the Passover lamb. They
[23:23] had witnessed the miracles. A and then
[23:26] from that moment on, God leads them out
[23:27] of Egypt. Miracle after miracle, sign
[23:29] after sign, wonder after wonder. But
[23:31] when God established the feast of the
[23:32] Passover in Exodus 12, he says, "This is
[23:34] going to be a memorial. This shall reset
[23:36] your calendar." Right? You're starting
[23:38] over. This is the first year. And I
[23:39] guess the way their calendar works, it's
[23:41] both the first month and the seventh
[23:42] month. Glory. Right. And so there
[23:45] there's such beautiful uh symbolism in
[23:47] it and types, but it's that Exodus began
[23:51] out of Egypt at this time and now
[23:53] they're finally crossing over and it's
[23:55] at the same time. It's a time that
[23:58] brother Brandham mentions about God.
[23:59] thought he said he really wasn't much of
[24:00] a military strategist to try to cross
[24:02] the Jordan River at the time when it's
[24:04] flooding. That's right. So, the banks
[24:06] are flooded. It's the hardest, most
[24:07] difficult time to cross the river. God
[24:10] does that to show his works. Amen. So
[24:12] that our trust isn't in man. He could
[24:14] have said, "Well, wait till it's just a
[24:15] trickle and you guys can just wade
[24:17] through." But he waits until it's
[24:18] flooded to demonstrate something. Right.
[24:21] In Isaiah 59 19 and 20, so shall they
[24:25] fear the name of the Lord from the west
[24:27] and his glory from the rising of the
[24:29] sun. When the enemy shall come in like a
[24:31] flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[24:33] up a standard against him. And the
[24:35] redeemer shall come to Zion and unto
[24:37] them that turn from transgression in
[24:39] Jacob, saith the Lord. The enemy comes
[24:42] in like a flood. And here at the rising
[24:45] of the sun,
[24:47] the time that the the sun is rising,
[24:50] that Christ is going to lift up a
[24:52] standard against the flood. The time
[24:54] when Jordan's banks were overflowing,
[24:56] that's when they were entering into the
[24:58] promised land. It was almost as if it
[24:59] was the time at which the Jordan stood
[25:01] the greatest against that the hardest
[25:04] time to cross the Jordan. The flood
[25:06] waters are filling up the plains. Now is
[25:08] not the time time to cross. But whenever
[25:10] the enemy comes in like a flood, death
[25:13] is creeping in. That Jordan, cold, icy
[25:15] Jordan River seems uncrrossable. The
[25:17] spirit of the Lord will lift up a
[25:19] standard against it.
[25:21] And it said the Jordan was overflowed
[25:23] all the time of the harvest. So it's
[25:25] harvest time. What is that a type for
[25:27] us? It's a type of rapturing time. Amen.
[25:29] We can use different types to to
[25:32] highlight or emphasize different truths.
[25:34] And so if you're uh you don't find the
[25:36] type and then uh find the truth, you you
[25:40] know the truth and then you could use
[25:42] the type. And so what I'm wanting to you
[25:44] to look at now is the time of crossing
[25:46] over. This rapture time, harvest time is
[25:50] rapturing time. We're not looking at it
[25:52] from the standpoint of the new birth and
[25:54] the and the baptism of Holy Ghost uh is
[25:56] the promised land and that type. And
[25:58] we're not looking at so much as the type
[25:59] of leaving uh uh the death angel in the
[26:02] Exodus. And that's the type of the
[26:03] rapture I'm wanting to use. Now, as
[26:05] brother B talked about, we're twothirds
[26:06] of the way to Jordan. That last step,
[26:09] the third pull is to come to the Jordan
[26:11] and to cross the Jordan. Not necessarily
[26:14] underh with Elijah. But as Elisha, as
[26:17] the bride, we got to come to that
[26:19] Jordan. We got to cross over into the
[26:21] full promise.
[26:23] And brother Random says this in the God
[26:25] who is rich in mercy. This harvest time,
[26:28] this rapturing time, it's that climatic
[26:29] moment of fulfilling the word in its
[26:32] season.
[26:34] It's amazing how God allowed them to
[26:36] come right to that moment in the harvest
[26:38] time. God knew in the Exodus they were
[26:39] just days away when they first started,
[26:42] but they were going to wonder for 40
[26:43] years. And now they come right back to
[26:45] it in this in this time of the harvest.
[26:48] And the God who is rich in mercy,
[26:50] redemption has two different parts. come
[26:52] out of and entering into first you have
[26:55] to come out. Some people want to bring
[26:57] the world with them but you got to come
[26:58] out of the world to enter into Christ.
[27:00] You have to come out of unbelief to
[27:02] enter into faith. There cannot be one
[27:05] thing in your way to really have genuine
[27:07] faith. You must absolutely leave
[27:09] everything that's contrary to the word
[27:11] of God behind to enter faith.
[27:14] So we leave unbelief. We leave the
[27:16] world. But we don't want to just come
[27:17] out of we don't want to just be
[27:20] non-denominational. We don't want to
[27:22] just be outside quoteunquote outside of
[27:23] organizations. There's a lot of people
[27:25] that have organized out of being
[27:27] non-denominational.
[27:29] They've organized by around being
[27:31] unorganized. Amen. And so he says, "And
[27:36] that was the book of Ephesians of the
[27:38] Old Testament. Joshua, right? Where
[27:40] Moses represented the law could not save
[27:42] no one but grace could." Here Joshua is
[27:44] the same word like Jesus Jehovah savior.
[27:47] So listen to this time. He said there
[27:49] had to come an Ephesians now as they're
[27:52] crossing the Jordan. That's the
[27:53] Ephesians out of Egypt into the
[27:55] wilderness. Now as they enter into
[27:57] that's your place in that's your that's
[27:59] the finality. That's the climax. And
[28:01] then we find out that we've come to
[28:03] another
[28:04] Ephesians another Ephesus. Now this is
[28:07] why we have an astronaut age. That's why
[28:09] we have these other things that brother
[28:11] Renham begins to identify where that in
[28:14] our intellectual denominations and so
[28:16] forth and all our educational programs
[28:18] has come to its Jordan. Remember anytime
[28:21] God calls out intellectualism, he's also
[28:23] calling out emotionalism because
[28:25] intellectual faith is emotional faith by
[28:27] a different label. That's right. And so
[28:30] the program has come to its Jordan. Then
[28:32] we must have an Ephesians again. We must
[28:35] have an exodus to come out and go into
[28:38] for the rapture. So we've entered that
[28:41] time where we are in another Ephesian
[28:43] age to go into.
[28:46] It is that rapturing time, right?
[28:50] It's a a going into. We've come to the
[28:53] into redemption has two parts. We've had
[28:56] there's an out of in brother Bam's
[28:57] ministry. There's a come out of her, but
[28:59] there's also behold I stand at the door
[29:01] and knock. And we've got to enter into.
[29:04] there's an entering into that takes
[29:05] place. He says, "For the rapture."
[29:09] Now, I know I'm putting a lot of lot of
[29:11] things out there and uh and and maybe
[29:15] you're stumbling over it and brother
[29:18] Chad's thinking, I haven't gone anywhere
[29:19] in 20 years of preaching and really
[29:21] going to be praying for you guys. Well,
[29:23] they started the church. Maybe they can
[29:24] get a pastor that can preach.
[29:26] But God is very, this is not an accident
[29:29] that they're crossing where they are.
[29:31] right? That God allowing things to
[29:34] happen. Brother Chad and I fellowship in
[29:35] the in the office and he said he
[29:37] recently preached a sermon called the
[29:38] church in trouble. And you're like,
[29:40] uhoh. And he was just talking about how
[29:42] even in heaven there was trouble.
[29:45] And so God, it didn't catch God by
[29:47] surprise.
[29:48] Maybe Satan was surprised that God knew,
[29:51] right? It's like, wait a minute. He
[29:53] knew. He knew. And so he's the one that
[29:55] was deceived, but God knows. And when
[29:58] the children of Israel left Egypt and
[30:00] they were just days away from entering
[30:02] in, he knew that because of their own
[30:04] stubbornness, they would take a long way
[30:06] in. But he said, "I'll let them go that
[30:08] way because it'll make a more perfect
[30:11] type to the believer who's going to have
[30:13] to fight through a wilderness, who's
[30:14] going to have decades of believing God's
[30:16] word and holding on to a promise." And
[30:18] so God was intentional on using Jordan
[30:21] as this entry point, but not just as an
[30:24] entry point, but also the border. That's
[30:26] right.
[30:27] This is where it's framed. I want you to
[30:29] catch this. God uses it to frame the
[30:32] promised land. That's right. In
[30:34] Hebrewsap
[30:35] 11:3, the Bible says, "Through faith, we
[30:38] understand that the worlds were framed
[30:39] by the word of God." So that things
[30:42] which were seen were not made of things
[30:43] which do appear. God framed the worlds
[30:47] that he created. We can say we know by
[30:49] faith that the creation was framed by
[30:52] the word of God. Right? God framed
[30:55] creation with his word. Think of how
[30:57] brother Bam talked about Eden's walls
[30:59] and how that God had walled the garden
[31:01] of Eden with his word and he had put a
[31:03] board around. He had framed his
[31:05] masterpiece family with the word and
[31:08] that Satan had to get bypass the frame.
[31:11] The woman had to leave be enticed
[31:13] outside of that framework and once she
[31:15] left that she could fall. And so here
[31:17] the Bible says that God framed creation
[31:20] by the word. The word framed is
[31:22] translated to make perfect or perfectly
[31:24] joined together. And to frame it means
[31:27] to complete, to put in order, to fit or
[31:30] frame for oneself.
[31:33] So in the beginning, and I told this
[31:34] story that when I first mentioned I was
[31:36] going to be using art as a subject and
[31:37] said, well, where the question was,
[31:38] well, where is that scripturally? And I
[31:40] said, in the beginning, God created.
[31:42] Amen. And brother said, like an artist,
[31:44] he was painting. He was bringing things
[31:45] out. the seven church ages when he
[31:47] preached he said when God started off
[31:49] like an artist drawn a picture of
[31:50] something he begins to fill in his parts
[31:52] you can begin to see it shape up. So
[31:54] when God created heavens and earth and
[31:57] then created the man and he brought the
[31:59] man forth and he placed him he then
[32:00] frames him with the word of God and he
[32:03] gives him a commandment and he frames it
[32:06] all by the word of God and it's as if
[32:08] he's displaying his creation for
[32:10] himself. He's framed it by the word.
[32:13] Amen. That is what God does. In the
[32:15] beginning, when the world was without
[32:16] form and void, it was chaotic. It wasn't
[32:18] framed yet. But then the spirit of God
[32:21] be to move and things begin to take
[32:22] shape. And then when God put the frame
[32:24] on it, everything made sense. If you
[32:27] just looked on earth and there's a
[32:28] beautiful animal and there's the
[32:29] beautiful this and there's a beautiful
[32:30] fruit and there's some these people look
[32:32] more upright and clean than the others.
[32:34] And you just look at it there. It's
[32:35] aimless. There's no point. But then God
[32:37] says, "Be fruitful, multiply, and
[32:39] fulfill the purpose of the earth." Amen.
[32:42] He begins to give them borders. and he
[32:43] begins to give them h things to follow.
[32:47] God's God's a God of boundaries for a
[32:50] purpose and for a reason. If you could
[32:52] just read this, I know this is a lengthy
[32:54] reading. Uh Numbers chapter 34, maybe
[32:57] we'll just read to verse
[32:58] 12, but this is God framing the promised
[33:02] land. Maybe difficult to see from this
[33:04] picture, but the green uh portion of
[33:07] this map is the portion that's described
[33:09] here, Numbers 34. The gray portion is
[33:12] that place that Gad and Reuben wanted to
[33:14] settle in. And the Lord spake unto Moses
[33:17] saying, notice God just doesn't say,
[33:19] I'll bless you and and that's it. He's
[33:22] very precise. When you come into the
[33:25] land of Canaan, this is the land that
[33:27] shall fall unto you for an inheritance.
[33:29] Notice it's their inheritance. It's what
[33:31] he gives. Even the land of Canaan with
[33:33] the coast thereof. Then your south
[33:35] quarter shall be from the wilderness of
[33:37] Zen along by the coast of Edom. And your
[33:40] south border shall be the outmost coast
[33:43] of the salt sea eastward. And your
[33:45] border shall turn from the south to the
[33:47] ascent of Acraim and pass onto Zen. And
[33:51] the going forth thereof shall be from
[33:53] the south of Kospia, and shall and shall
[33:55] go onto Hazar and pass onto Azine. And
[33:59] the border shall fetch a compass from
[34:01] Asmin under the river of Egypt, and the
[34:03] goings out of it shall be at the sea.
[34:06] How come he just didn't say, "It's all
[34:07] yours. just whatever whatever you want
[34:08] to take over, whatever you want to grab,
[34:11] whatever looks good, whatever you find.
[34:13] But he says, "And for the western
[34:14] border, you shall even have the great
[34:16] sea of a border. This shall be your west
[34:18] border, and this shall be your north
[34:20] border. From the great sea, you shall
[34:22] point out for you Mount and from
[34:24] Mount you shall point out your
[34:26] border unto the entrance of Hamoth. And
[34:28] the going forth of the border shall be
[34:30] to be to Zedad, and the border shall go
[34:33] on to Zephron, and the goings out of it
[34:35] shall be at Hazerin. This shall be your
[34:38] north border. This reads just like the
[34:40] legal description of your property.
[34:43] It almost doesn't make sense unless you
[34:45] know how to read a map. But it's being
[34:48] mapped out precisely where their land
[34:50] is.
[34:52] They couldn't just say, "Well, I'm going
[34:53] to go over here and say, "Well, that's
[34:54] outside the land. This is the land I
[34:55] give you. This is the land of Canaan.
[34:57] And you shall point out your east border
[34:59] from Hezeran to Sheph. And the co shall
[35:02] go down from Sheffam to Ria and on the
[35:04] east side of A. And the border shall
[35:06] descend, and shall reach under the side
[35:08] of the sea of Chinth eastward, and the
[35:11] border shall go down to Jordan, and all
[35:14] the goings out of it shall be at the
[35:16] salt sea. This shall be your land with
[35:19] the coast thereof roundabout.
[35:22] What was God doing? God made him a
[35:24] promise. He said he would bless him, and
[35:25] now he's framing it. That's right. He's
[35:28] putting a border around it. That's
[35:29] right. So there can be some p precision.
[35:32] That's right. so that there can be some
[35:34] confidence. Notice even when he builds
[35:36] the temple, he says if you'll face this
[35:38] temple, no matter where you are, he
[35:41] still wanted to give them a reference
[35:42] point in Canaan. He wanted to give them
[35:45] something that they could look to.
[35:46] Certainly, this is to the Jews because
[35:47] their promise is physical. But in the
[35:49] same sense that they were given a very
[35:51] precise physical promised land, the
[35:54] believer has a very precise spiritual
[35:57] promised land. Amen. This message is
[35:59] very specific. It opens up to us the
[36:02] land of the son of man. It opens up to
[36:04] us a body that we're feeding on. It's
[36:06] just you can't just eat anything. You
[36:08] say, "Well, it's here." No, you can't
[36:10] just eat anything. It's got to be the
[36:11] word of God. Yes, sir. God framed it.
[36:15] The place that he would dwell. This is,
[36:17] as we already read, their place of
[36:18] safety. This was the place of promise.
[36:20] This is where the covenant would be
[36:21] honored. In Exodus 29:es 45 and 46. and
[36:26] I will dwell among the children of
[36:28] Israel and will be their
[36:31] God. Now notice how he narrows this
[36:33] down. And they shall know that I am the
[36:34] Lord their God that brought them forth
[36:36] out of the land of Egypt that I may
[36:38] dwell among them and I am the Lord their
[36:41] God. God didn't want to dwell with them
[36:43] in Egypt. Praise God. And one thing I
[36:46] think we'll point out on Sunday, unless
[36:48] I can twist somebody's Never mind. I I
[36:50] the on Sunday I want to show that
[36:52] Pharaoh was even fine if they worshiped
[36:55] near him. But that was never God's
[36:58] design. God's design was never for them
[37:01] to be close to Egypt and just to worship
[37:03] him. Just worshiping God is not enough.
[37:06] It must be in the right thing in spirit
[37:09] and in truth. God didn't want them just
[37:12] to be free to worship and just have all
[37:14] sorts of liberty without any boundaries.
[37:16] God was very specific. I'm taking you
[37:18] out of Egypt to bring you to a place
[37:21] where I can dwell among you. Numbers
[37:24] chapter 35:34. Defile not therefore the
[37:27] land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I
[37:31] dwell. That's what he says about the
[37:33] land where he dwells. Don't defile the
[37:35] land that you will possess, the land
[37:37] that I give you for an inheritance,
[37:38] because that's where I will dwell for I,
[37:40] the Lord, dwell among the children of
[37:41] Israel. We say God inhabits the praises
[37:44] of his people. An angel of the Lord were
[37:45] encamped about them in the Exodus. But
[37:47] God was only in them in the Exodus to
[37:49] get them to the Ephesus.
[37:52] He was only in them in the out of so
[37:54] that he could be with them once they got
[37:56] into. He didn't That's beautiful. He
[37:58] didn't just leave them to get there on
[38:00] their own. God wants you to make it to
[38:02] the ultimate destination. So he'll be
[38:04] with you even in you until the end. He
[38:07] that begun the work is just and faithful
[38:09] to finish. But but too many people are
[38:10] happy being in the presence but not in
[38:14] the process.
[38:19] This is the place I want to take you.
[38:21] Deuteronomy 11
[38:23] verse31. For ye shall pass over Jordan
[38:26] to go in to possess the land which the
[38:28] Lord your God giveth you. That's what he
[38:30] wanted. He wanted him to pass over and
[38:32] to possess it and ye shall possess it
[38:35] and dwell
[38:37] therein. on the o on the right side of
[38:40] Jordan, the correct side. Amen. The west
[38:42] side crossing Jordan brought them into
[38:44] the place of the land that God wanted to
[38:46] give. That was their inheritance. That's
[38:48] right. Anywhere else, that's not their
[38:50] inheritance. You shall possess it, and
[38:53] you will dwell there. And God said, "I
[38:55] will be your God, and I will dwell with
[38:58] them."
[39:01] God was framing the land of promise in
[39:04] Numbers 34.
[39:07] When he established the borders of
[39:08] Canaan, he was wanting to give a
[39:10] boundary that people could be safe
[39:11] within. He said, "This is going to be
[39:13] the place of your rest. This is going to
[39:15] be where you can dwell safely. This is
[39:17] going to be your promise, your the place
[39:19] of promise."
[39:22] And think about in the beginning when we
[39:24] stumbled through the the art aspect of
[39:27] this that when you put a piece of art on
[39:30] display sometimes you can use a frame to
[39:32] with you can use art without a frame but
[39:35] you can see where in many instances the
[39:37] frame is part of the art
[39:41] and when God gave the children of Israel
[39:44] promised land by placing a border around
[39:47] it he could give context to his work.
[39:49] That's right. That's right. you could
[39:51] focus on. And what does God do once he
[39:53] gets I mean really when you go from
[39:54] Genesis chapter 1 to Genesis chapter 12,
[39:56] God's just wanting you to get to the
[39:57] story. He's giving you the background in
[39:59] the first several chapters, but the
[40:01] story is about Abraham. One man, one
[40:03] nation in one place, and the rest of the
[40:06] Bible revolves around Canaan, right? And
[40:09] if anything else happens, it's because
[40:11] someone from there went outside there or
[40:14] something outside of there is going to
[40:15] impact what goes on there because God
[40:18] wants everything to be put in the
[40:19] context of that promise. That's right.
[40:22] There for a reason. There in that land,
[40:25] they could dwell safely. God could dwell
[40:26] with them. There could be a display of
[40:27] his attributes there. He could draw all
[40:29] men to his glory.
[40:32] There's a reason why all the believers,
[40:34] they wanted to be buried in Hebrew. They
[40:36] wanted to don't leave my bones here in
[40:37] Egypt. That's right.
[40:39] And God when he formed this boundary,
[40:41] he's wanted to give them that proper
[40:42] framing and context to his character.
[40:47] Deuteronomy 11
[40:49] 13-17. I know I'm dancing around in a
[40:52] lot of different places here, but I'm
[40:54] glad that we have the time to go through
[40:57] this. I I thank God that I've been
[40:58] recovering and feel that I'm nearing uh
[41:01] coming out of this this battle we've had
[41:03] with this uh this pain disorder, but uh
[41:06] I wasn't sure if we'd be able to get
[41:08] this far and I'm glad that we could get
[41:09] to this. If you could just focus with me
[41:10] for a few more moments, I'll give you
[41:12] plenty of time to fellowship with
[41:13] brother Chad afterwards. In Deuteronomy
[41:16] 11 13 to1 17. And it shall come to pass,
[41:19] if you shall hearken diligently unto my
[41:21] commandments, which I command you this
[41:23] day, to love the Lord your God, and to
[41:26] serve him with all your heart and with
[41:27] all your soul, that I will give you the
[41:30] rain of your land in his due season, the
[41:32] first rain and the latter rain, that
[41:34] thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy
[41:36] wine, and thine oil, and I will send
[41:38] grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that
[41:40] thou mayest eat and be full. That's a
[41:44] very specific promise. This is Uber Eats
[41:47] before there was Door Dash and Uber
[41:50] Eats, Instacart. This is God's promise
[41:53] that look, if you just obey me, I'll
[41:56] bless you.
[41:57] There'll be rain for your crops. You'll
[41:59] gather corn. There'll be wine. You'll
[42:01] have grass for your cattle. If there's
[42:02] cattle, there's milk. If there's cattle,
[42:04] there's
[42:05] beef. Take heed to yourselves that your
[42:07] heart be not deceived. And you turn
[42:09] aside and serve other gods and worship
[42:11] them. And then the Lord's wrath be
[42:13] kindled against you. And how will it be
[42:15] kindled against him? And he shut up the
[42:17] heaven, that there be no rain, and that
[42:19] the land yield not her fruit, lest ye
[42:21] perish quickly from off the good land
[42:23] which the Lord giveth you. If you
[42:26] obeyed, God would bless the promised
[42:28] land. But disobedience would bring curse
[42:30] upon the promised land. Famine was one
[42:33] of the judgments of God that he decreed
[42:36] that he would punish Israel with when
[42:38] they sinned, when they disbelieved.
[42:41] Ezekiel 14:13, "Son of man, when the
[42:44] land sinnth against me by trespassing
[42:46] grievously, then will I stretch out my
[42:48] hand upon it." And notice how God
[42:50] changes the the blessing of the land,
[42:54] and will break the staff of the bread
[42:55] thereof, and will send famine upon it,
[42:57] and will cut off man and beast from it.
[43:00] So, the blessing is not at its fullness,
[43:03] though you would be in the land, it's
[43:04] not at its fullness through disobedience
[43:06] or unbelief. Right?
[43:09] We know the Bible says
[43:11] and uh over and over again and it's kind
[43:13] of the phrase Canaan land. It was a land
[43:17] flowing with milk and honey.
[43:21] Says the the veggie tells saddle up your
[43:23] cow and go with us now cuz we're going
[43:26] to the promised land. Right? It's a land
[43:29] flown with milk and honey. It's the way
[43:31] we think about it. Right. And so if
[43:33] there was ever a famine, if you didn't
[43:35] have grass for your cattle,
[43:38] the solution was to believe God. If you
[43:41] didn't have rain for your crops, the
[43:42] solution was to repent. Get right with
[43:44] God. The all the provision was there.
[43:47] They just had to keep their eyes on the
[43:48] promise. I'll give you rain for your
[43:50] crops. You'll gather corn. You'll have
[43:52] wine. You'll have oil. You have grass
[43:54] for your cattle. That you will eat and
[43:57] be full. You'll be satisfied if you obey
[43:59] me. That's right. But if you disobey me,
[44:01] I have a law built in to get your
[44:03] attention so that you don't perish. So
[44:05] that you're not completely removed from
[44:06] your land is you'll come back to me and
[44:08] repent.
[44:10] Leviticus chapter 26 18 to20. And if you
[44:13] will not yet for all this hearken unto
[44:16] me, then I will punish you seven times
[44:18] more for your sins. How is he going to
[44:20] punish him? I will break the pride of
[44:22] your power and I will make your heaven
[44:24] as iron and your earth as brass. You'll
[44:25] shut up the heavens. It will not rain.
[44:27] The ground will become hard. It will not
[44:29] yield its fruit, and your strength shall
[44:31] be spent in vain, no matter how much you
[44:33] labor over it. For your land shall not
[44:34] yield her increase, neither shall the
[44:36] tree of the land yield their fruits.
[44:41] Now, this is of even the promised land.
[44:44] That's right. This is in this in this
[44:47] sense of Israel now wanting to
[44:49] completely possess this land. He's
[44:51] saying that faith in the word of God,
[44:53] obedience to the word of God is what was
[44:55] required. Exactly. Right.
[44:59] And I want to close with this. I want to
[45:01] use this to bring us to our closing. How
[45:03] do you like that for a clever clever
[45:04] hedge
[45:06] there in Ruth chapter 1:es
[45:11] 1:5 when I would when I was on the road
[45:14] preaching a lot, I'd say just uh come
[45:16] into my home stretch and then I would
[45:17] always say, "You don't know how long it
[45:18] takes for me to get
[45:20] home." He said, "Now it come came to
[45:23] pass in the days when the judges rule."
[45:25] Just focus with me on this. I'll
[45:26] probably just go through it very quickly
[45:28] that there was a famine in the land. So
[45:31] here in the book of Ruth in the days of
[45:34] the judges there's famine in the land.
[45:38] Why? Book of Judges tells us this people
[45:40] did wicked. We can already read in these
[45:42] other places in the Bible in Deuteronomy
[45:44] and Leviticus that if the people sinned,
[45:46] God would bring a famine. And he was
[45:49] already so precise that if there was a
[45:50] famine in the land, what they should
[45:52] have thought of is we need to get right
[45:53] with God. The only reason why we don't
[45:55] have rain for our crops and we don't
[45:57] have wine and we don't have corn and we
[45:58] don't have grass for our cattle is
[46:00] because we're not obeying God. Because
[46:02] if we obey the Lord, he'll give us these
[46:04] things. He promised that we would eat
[46:05] and be full. So there's a famine in the
[46:08] land. It says a certain man of Bethlehem
[46:09] Judah went to sojourn in the country of
[46:12] Moab. He and his wife and his two sons.
[46:15] And the name of the man was Imc. And the
[46:17] name of his wife was Naomi. And the name
[46:18] of his two sons Mahan and Chilion
[46:21] Ephertites of Bethlehem Judah. Now, what
[46:24] strikes you in when you read
[46:26] this? When God said that there would be
[46:29] a famine, it would be because they're
[46:30] disobedient, right? And so, the solution
[46:34] isn't to leave. That's right. The
[46:36] solution is to get right with God. But
[46:39] they came into the country of Moab and
[46:41] continued there. They've left the
[46:43] promised land. They've left left the
[46:46] place where God said you can dwell in
[46:48] safety. The place where God said he
[46:50] would dwell with them. the place where
[46:52] God had made the covenant that if you
[46:53] turn to him, if you repent, if you get
[46:55] things right, I'll give you rain for
[46:57] your crops, I'll give you provision. But
[46:59] they came in the country of Moab and
[47:00] continued there. And notice what begins
[47:03] to happen. IMC, Naomi's husband died,
[47:05] and she was left and her two sons. And
[47:07] they took them wives, the women of Moab.
[47:09] The name of the one was Orpa, and the
[47:11] name of the other Ruth. And they dwelt
[47:12] there about 10 years. And Mahalan and
[47:14] Chilean died also, both of them. And the
[47:17] woman was left of her two sons and her
[47:18] husband. This was a move that God didn't
[47:21] bless. That's right. There's a lot of
[47:23] rich history in this, but there was a
[47:26] famine in the promised land because of
[47:28] sin. That's right. And IMC though he was
[47:31] a
[47:32] believer, he left with the intent to
[47:35] come back when the famine's over. We're
[47:37] just going to go into Moab for a while.
[47:39] See if we can't find work. See if we
[47:40] can't get some grace. See if we can't
[47:42] find some better weather. And they had
[47:44] this design that they'd come back. But
[47:46] having left the promised land,
[47:49] All it results in is death. That's
[47:50] right. It was the exodus in reverse, but
[47:54] this wasn't an exodus. This was
[47:55] backsliding. That's right. This was
[47:58] separation from God's presence to go
[48:00] into the wilderness. Right? I don't if
[48:02] you could tell from this, but you could
[48:03] see where they begin from Bethlehem,
[48:06] Judah, and they begin to travel. And as
[48:08] they would have traveled, they would
[48:09] have went right past the ruins of
[48:11] Jericho. Right? They have crossed right
[48:13] back over the Jordan River that God told
[48:15] them uh that to pass through, right?
[48:17] They would have gone then into passing
[48:20] past the tribe of Gad and even Reuben
[48:22] into land of Moab which was known for
[48:24] their wickedness.
[48:26] Known for their evil
[48:30] may have been subtle but it was a clear
[48:32] rejection of God's word. So well that
[48:34] how could you say that about Ruth and or
[48:36] Naomi and how could you say that about
[48:37] Limic? He didn't trust God's promise.
[48:41] He left the promised land. He left the
[48:44] field. He left the place where the
[48:45] prophet had led them. He left the place,
[48:47] the one place where he could be sure.
[48:49] Even if things didn't seem like they're
[48:51] working, this is the place where it's
[48:52] worth to keep laboring. Amen. Even if it
[48:55] doesn't seem like you're getting crops,
[48:56] this is where you want to labor. This is
[48:58] where you want to sew. This is where you
[48:59] water. This is where you want to plant
[49:01] because this is where God has led you.
[49:03] Amen. Butch leaving was a sign of a lack
[49:06] of trust. What was it? Unbelief. That's
[49:08] right.
[49:11] No matter how much he must have
[49:13] thought that this would end well. The
[49:16] Bible says, "I'll give you rain for your
[49:18] land in due season. I'll send grass in
[49:21] the fields for thy cattle so you'll have
[49:23] corn, wine, oil, and you'll eat and be
[49:27] full." But he abandoned that. He thought
[49:29] maybe in his own he could go into the
[49:31] world. He could find another job. He
[49:32] could do something. He looked for those
[49:33] carnal things.
[49:36] And it's with that that I want you to
[49:38] look again in Numbers chapter 32:es
[49:44] 1-5. Now the children of Reuben and the
[49:46] children of Gad had a very great
[49:48] multitude of cattle. That's right. And
[49:51] when they saw the land of Jazer in the
[49:53] land of Gilead, that behold the place
[49:55] was a place for cattle. That's right.
[49:59] The children of Gadon, the children of
[50:00] Reuben came and spake unto Moses and to
[50:02] Eleazar the priests and the princes of
[50:03] the congregation saying, notice how they
[50:05] kind of worked the crowd a little bit,
[50:06] right? They wanted to kind of grease the
[50:09] skids with everybody they could. They
[50:10] didn't just go to Moses, but they went
[50:11] to the priests. They went to the
[50:12] princes, the deacons, the trustees, went
[50:14] to everybody, hit them up on Instagram,
[50:17] Adaroth and Dibbon and Jeser and Nimra
[50:19] and Heshbon and Elia and Sheba and Nebo
[50:21] and Bon. Even the country which the Lord
[50:23] smoked before the congregation of
[50:24] Israel, they knew these places. They
[50:27] started naming the addresses is a land
[50:30] for cattle. We already saw that they saw
[50:32] that place was a place for cattle. And
[50:35] this is their message. This land, this
[50:37] place that even was smoked by the Lord
[50:40] is a land for cattle. And I don't know
[50:42] if you knew this, but your servants have
[50:47] cattle. Wherefore they said, this to me
[50:51] is one of the most remarkable scriptures
[50:52] in this Exodus. If we found grace in thy
[50:55] sight, let this land be given unto thy
[50:58] servants for possession, and bring us
[51:01] not over Jordan.
[51:04] They didn't say it, but you know what
[51:06] they said? The message failed.
[51:08] We tried what the prophet said, but it's
[51:10] not going to work.
[51:13] So, we need to find a place that's got
[51:15] grass enough for our cattle.
[51:18] We've got a lot of cattle, so we want to
[51:21] settle. says, "Don't make us cross
[51:24] Jordan.
[51:26] Don't take us into the land that God
[51:28] said he would give us as an
[51:29] inheritance." And you'll find, as we'll
[51:31] get into it on Sunday, that there's a
[51:33] lot of things that happen where they got
[51:35] reasons and they say, "No, we'll do this
[51:36] and no, we'll do that." And it might
[51:38] seem to be somewhat of an innocent move
[51:39] and that's fine. If that's what they
[51:41] want, the Lord will let them have it.
[51:42] And he does let them have it. But this
[51:44] was a clear rejection of the word that
[51:46] they had been given. Exactly. Right.
[51:48] What they should have done is looked at
[51:49] all their cattle and looked at the
[51:51] well-watered plains of the valley of
[51:52] Jordan and said, "You know what? God
[51:54] promised us that in the promised land we
[51:57] he would send rain so that we would by
[52:00] his own words have grass in our fields
[52:02] for cattle."
[52:04] He promised it. So if these tribes would
[52:07] have looked out at a dry valley, they
[52:09] would have said, "God, you said if we
[52:11] believe you and trust you, you would
[52:12] send rain and you would give me grass
[52:14] for my cattle. So, I don't want grass on
[52:17] the wrong side of Jordan. I'd rather
[52:19] have cattle in a desert where you
[52:21] promise me grass, but know I'm in your
[52:23] promise than to stop short of it
[52:28] just because it looks better and more
[52:30] pleasing.
[52:32] In Joshua chapter 30 13:32, this is what
[52:35] they settled for. This is what they
[52:37] asked for. These are the countries that
[52:39] Moses did distribute for inheritance in
[52:41] the plains of Moab. That's right. I'll
[52:45] pick up on this verse on Sunday. The
[52:47] plains of Moab on the other side of
[52:49] Jordan by Jericho eastward. That's
[52:52] right. Meditate on that. That's right.
[52:55] God could have just said, "These are the
[52:57] lands that we gave him." But he said,
[52:59] "Plains of Moab, other side of Jordan by
[53:03] Jericho, eastward." Right. He wants all
[53:06] of those elements to stand out. Exactly.
[53:09] And what they had asked for was an
[53:11] inheritance outside of God's framing.
[53:13] Right.
[53:15] They looked at the picture and they
[53:17] wanted to settle outside the frame.
[53:19] That's right. And what they did is they
[53:21] cut themselves off from the promise.
[53:23] That's right. Even have having seen the
[53:26] evidence.
[53:28] The spies having traveled through the
[53:30] promised land. They've seen the
[53:32] evidence. They've entered into They will
[53:34] enter into Israel, Palestine, Canaan,
[53:38] and they'll fight there.
[53:41] But in the end they want to go all the
[53:43] way back to
[53:45] Moab
[53:47] eastward. Brothers, if you could come to
[53:49] your instruments in 2 Peter chapter 2 19
[53:52] to
[53:53] 22, you can read the the verses prior to
[53:56] this. It really gives a lot more
[53:57] context. While they promised them
[53:58] liberty, they they themselves are the
[54:00] servants of corruption. For of whom a
[54:02] man is overcome of the same as he
[54:04] brought in bondage. Chew on that one.
[54:07] For if after they have escaped the
[54:08] pollutions of the world through the
[54:09] knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[54:11] Christ, they are again entangled therein
[54:13] and overcome, the latter end is worse
[54:15] with them than the
[54:21] beginning. For it had been better for
[54:23] them to not known the way of
[54:25] righteousness than after they have known
[54:27] it, to turn from the holy commandment
[54:29] delivered unto them. There was no
[54:32] commandment for the land of Moab.
[54:35] The only commandment God gave them as
[54:36] they went through was pass through, pass
[54:38] around. If you need to transact, that's
[54:40] fine. But you have no possession here.
[54:42] Right? He told them, "You don't have
[54:43] your inheritance here. Pass on. Go on.
[54:46] God will bless them. Let them have what
[54:47] they want. But this isn't for you.
[54:50] No matter how beautiful the cities are,
[54:51] no matter how beautiful Balum can
[54:53] worship and how beautiful the Bamites
[54:55] churches are, no matter how beautiful
[54:56] the Moabites are, no matter how great it
[54:59] may seem, pass through because I've got
[55:01] something greater." Amen.
[55:04] The holy commandment delivered to them
[55:06] was this is the land I'll give you and
[55:08] you'll have grass for your
[55:09] cattle. If you like to hunt, there'll be
[55:11] places to hunt. If you like to fish,
[55:13] there'll be places to fish. Don't worry,
[55:14] I've got it all under control. I'll give
[55:16] you these things if you'll just trust
[55:17] me. But Peter now looks at this
[55:21] happening even in the church. He says,
[55:22] "But it's happening to them according to
[55:24] the true pro proverb. The dog is turned
[55:26] to his own vomit again and the s that
[55:30] was washed to her wallowing in the mire.
[55:38] Isn't that a
[55:39] shame that Reuben and Gad and they
[55:42] eventually influence half the tribe of
[55:43] Manasseh to not settle within the land
[55:46] of promise and they go right
[55:49] back to a cursed
[55:51] land, a sinful
[55:56] land, back to the wilderness of
[56:02] sin. And in doing
[56:04] so, on the face of it, and even at the
[56:07] heart of it, was like, I just don't know
[56:08] if I trust
[56:09] God to keep me in the
[56:12] land. So, I need to choose a place
[56:14] that's got some contingencies. I need a
[56:16] lot of
[56:17] grass. And they were a dog returning to
[56:21] their own vomit again. Oh, they they uh
[56:24] kind of phrased it, well, we don't want
[56:26] to take other people's space. Oh, if we
[56:28] don't go over, then there's more land
[56:30] for everybody
[56:31] else. God had already made a provision
[56:33] for that.
[56:36] But as you'll see as you continue to
[56:38] read, this was a false religious
[56:41] move for the purposes of
[56:44] stumbling the
[56:48] elect. If anything, they were trying to
[56:51] frame the bride for something. Get her
[56:53] out. Draw her off sides. Get her to
[56:56] follow. Get her to commit
[56:58] unbelief. Stay in the word.
[57:02] stay within the context and the
[57:04] framework as God has given it to us
[57:06] because that's where he's promised to
[57:07] bless you. Do you know what the mantra
[57:09] is that the the God- called ministry has
[57:12] failed? Even it's been said, "We've
[57:14] tried preachers for decades. That's
[57:16] failed. Let's just push play and obey."
[57:19] But there's even a voice in the land
[57:20] that says, "We've tried only believe.
[57:22] We've tried the word only and it didn't
[57:24] bring a rapture.
[57:26] So, let's try something else." What else
[57:29] is there, saints? But the word of God,
[57:33] what else is there but to hold to God's
[57:35] word and trust him that what he said he
[57:39] would do, he would do. And there's no
[57:41] amount of backsliding back into Moab
[57:43] that's going to change your body. Stay
[57:46] in the land.
[57:48] That's where God will bless us. Let's
[57:50] stand to our feet tonight.
[57:53] Just pray a word of blessing upon you.
[57:54] We thank you for your patience and your
[57:56] attentiveness.
[58:00] It's so wonderful to see these things in
[58:03] the word of God.
[58:06] And there's a lot here for you to go
[58:08] back over and to search out. You've seen
[58:10] those scriptures. You've jotted them
[58:11] down. You see where we're drawing this
[58:14] from. Take a look into the word of God.
[58:16] See what the messenger had to say about
[58:19] these things. Our gracious heavenly
[58:22] father. Lord, we do see a theme in the
[58:24] scripture of those that fall short,
[58:26] those that come up short.
[58:29] But this story in the book of numbers
[58:30] and then again in Joshua is such a
[58:32] remarkable
[58:33] story of how the very ones who seed
[58:37] spent 400 years in
[58:39] bondage witnessed miracles and signs of
[58:42] wonders through 40 years of journeying
[58:44] in the wilderness and had finally come
[58:46] to that climactic point of their exodus.
[58:50] That point where they enter in. And at
[58:52] that very moment before they cross over,
[58:54] they saw green
[58:57] grass and they saw what was on the other
[59:00] side. And they said, "Moses, if you
[59:03] don't mind, don't make us cross over
[59:05] Jordan, but since we have cattle and
[59:07] there's grass here for our cattle, would
[59:09] you would you let us settle over
[59:12] here?" And Moses caught the spirit of
[59:14] it, Lord. He said, "This is a
[59:17] resurrection of the spirit at Kades
[59:18] Barnea.
[59:21] that's resurrected the sins of their
[59:24] fathers to
[59:25] discourage the children from crossing
[59:29] over. And Lord, your prophet navigated
[59:34] that, found a place for those that would
[59:37] refuse, those that would fall
[59:41] short, and let them have their
[59:43] inheritance on the wrong side of life.
[59:50] And Lord, I believe that you've raised
[59:52] up a bride that'll take you at your word
[59:53] and believe you for your word.
[59:56] And we may may have
[59:59] many that'll be there on that day that
[1:00:01] go by way of the grave, but there has to
[1:00:03] come a time when we've buried the last
[1:00:05] bride member. We have had our last
[1:00:08] funeral.
[1:00:10] And there will be those that are alive
[1:00:12] and remain. Amen. Lord, I I want to stay
[1:00:16] faithful to the message to say this is a
[1:00:18] rapture time. This is a rapture
[1:00:21] season. And I don't want to stay on the
[1:00:24] wrong side of
[1:00:25] Jordan. I I I want to cross over fully
[1:00:28] into the promised
[1:00:29] land. I want to defeat and drive out
[1:00:31] every enemy of unbelief in the land. And
[1:00:34] Lord, if things aren't going the way
[1:00:35] they're supposed to, I don't want to
[1:00:37] despair of the promise. I want to
[1:00:38] believe your promise. I don't want to go
[1:00:40] on a backsliden journey back to Moab,
[1:00:43] back to some other glare of another age.
[1:00:45] I want to stay faithful to believe your
[1:00:46] word. And if things aren't working the
[1:00:49] way they're supposed to, Lord, if I
[1:00:50] don't have the deliverance, if I don't
[1:00:51] have the uh the healings, if I don't
[1:00:54] have the uh the move of God in my life
[1:00:56] that I need, then the solution is coming
[1:00:57] back to your word and taking you at your
[1:00:59] word and believe in your word and you
[1:01:01] will bring the rain. Amen. Lord, there
[1:01:04] was no revival for IMC and Moab. There
[1:01:07] was no revival for Reuben and Gab. No
[1:01:09] matter how hard they tried, that was not
[1:01:11] where you said you would
[1:01:12] dwell. Lord, I want to be found faithful
[1:01:14] in your
[1:01:16] promise. Lord, I want to honor the frame
[1:01:19] that you chose for the word of
[1:01:22] God. I don't want to just misapply and
[1:01:25] take things out of context and just
[1:01:27] think that I can run around anywhere and
[1:01:29] do anything. Lord, I want to stay within
[1:01:30] the framework because it's there. You
[1:01:33] promise safety and rest and provision.
[1:01:36] Bless us tonight. And I pray as we
[1:01:38] worship, we commit ourselves to you
[1:01:40] tonight. I desire that you would give
[1:01:42] understanding to the people who've heard
[1:01:43] these words. Lord, it could be
[1:01:45] beneficial to him. I ask all this in the
[1:01:47] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
