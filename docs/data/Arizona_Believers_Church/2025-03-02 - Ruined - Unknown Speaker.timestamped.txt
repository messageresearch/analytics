[0:00] my title as you can see from this slide
[0:01] is ruined and it is drawn from this
[0:05] particular scripture and from a number
[0:07] of different scriptures that I've been
[0:08] reading over the past several weeks and
[0:11] how that there is an image of God and
[0:12] that image can be marred there is
[0:14] something that God has tried to
[0:16] accomplish that Satan is trying to
[0:18] destroy and there's a lot of different
[0:20] themes that you could pull through this
[0:22] and there's a lot of different ways that
[0:25] we could express it we have been using
[0:26] the subject of Art and there is a
[0:30] Concept in art where ruins can be
[0:32] romanticized and there can be something
[0:34] beautiful about it maybe something
[0:36] nostalgic or vintage but that's not what
[0:38] I'm referring to I'm not talking about
[0:41] something uh through the passage of time
[0:43] becoming Antiquated and desirable to see
[0:46] and and admire the beauty of the ruins
[0:49] but rather we're talking about something
[0:50] that has been destroyed it's derel it's
[0:52] been been
[0:54] abandoned and uh if we could just turn
[0:57] here to Proverbs chapter 24 and and
[1:00] start with verse 21 I'll just read our
[1:02] text again it says my son fear thou the
[1:06] Lord and the king I think that's a
[1:08] critical component and then it says and
[1:10] meddle not with them that are given to
[1:13] change and I want to look at that part
[1:15] uh here in a moment for their Calamity
[1:18] which is their distress or burden shall
[1:21] rise suddenly now it doesn't mean that
[1:24] as soon as they are as soon as they
[1:25] change or they're given to change
[1:27] immediately something happens but he's
[1:29] saying that there their burden their
[1:30] distress it's going to happen and when
[1:32] it happens it'll happen quickly and who
[1:35] knoweth the ruin of them both this ruin
[1:40] is a disaster or destruction that's
[1:42] where I'm getting my title ruined from
[1:44] something that has been uh destroyed
[1:48] something that has been torn down and
[1:51] this as it speaks of this burden and
[1:54] this ruin that would come it says meddle
[1:56] not with them that are given to change
[1:58] and that word their change times is
[2:00] interpreted as repeated or a second time
[2:03] but here the meaning is those who alter
[2:06] or those who uh disg even disguise
[2:09] themselves they have some other motive
[2:11] some other uh directive uh the scripture
[2:14] even speaks in a sense of a rebellion so
[2:16] those that are given to change they are
[2:19] altered they are disguised in First
[2:21] Kings 14:2 and jeroboam said to his wife
[2:25] arise I pray thee and disguise thyself
[2:29] that thou be not known to be the wife of
[2:32] Jobo that's that word change disguise
[2:35] yourself and uh act in a manner dress in
[2:38] a manner to where people don't know who
[2:40] you are be very
[2:42] inconspicuous and I was thinking of this
[2:44] and how would one dress in a way to
[2:47] disguise themselves to not be known to
[2:49] be job's wife and she may have laid
[2:52] aside garments that spoke of royalty she
[2:54] may have dressed in a way that presented
[2:56] herself as very poor maybe she even went
[2:58] so far as to try to address in a way
[3:00] where you couldn't tell that she was a
[3:01] woman at all but that's the word there
[3:04] go and change yourself so that you're
[3:06] not
[3:08] recognized in Genesis chapter 38 I'll
[3:11] I'll ju I'll I'll pause right here we
[3:13] have been ministering on uh Wednesday
[3:16] night we spoke on dress codes the last
[3:18] time we ministered on
[3:19] Sunday uh I can't remember what the
[3:21] title was then uh but it was we used
[3:24] Deuteronomy chapter 22 and we're showing
[3:26] the foundation as to why God says it's a
[3:29] those that wear the Garment of another
[3:32] the other gender opposite gender they
[3:35] are Abomination so I'm still continuing
[3:37] on that on that subject so we'll be
[3:39] coming to it here just in a
[3:41] moment and he so it says and it and it
[3:43] was told Tamar saying Behold thy
[3:45] father-in-law goeth up to Timnath to
[3:48] sheare his sheep and she put her uh she
[3:51] put her Widow garments off from her so
[3:54] she was dress in a way to signal to
[3:56] signify I'm a widow I'm grieving I've
[3:58] lost my husband so she's changed ing her
[4:00] apparel and covered her with a veil and
[4:03] wrapped herself and sat in an open place
[4:06] which is by the way to Timnath for she
[4:08] saw that Shayla was grown and she was
[4:11] not given unto him the wife so she was
[4:14] was married to a son of Judah and when
[4:17] he died she was she should have been
[4:20] granted according to the law she should
[4:22] have custom she should have been granted
[4:24] to marry the younger brother when he
[4:26] came of age so that the seat of her
[4:28] husband could continue
[4:30] and so she's using this game of
[4:32] deception and and you can go and read
[4:34] the whole story as to how she
[4:36] accomplished it and it says in verse 15
[4:38] when Judas saw her he thought her to be
[4:41] a harlot because she had covered her
[4:43] face whereas at one time she was wearing
[4:46] garments to say that I am a woman that
[4:48] has lost my husband I'm wearing the
[4:50] garments of a widow and I'm grieving uh
[4:53] she now wore something to Signal the
[4:56] character that she wanted to assume she
[4:59] could wear a Widow's garments and expect
[5:01] her father-in-law to say hey would you
[5:04] come and come with me and let us go be
[5:08] together she had to dress in a way that
[5:10] would signify to one who saw her that
[5:13] this is the character that I have this
[5:15] is the character I'm trying to assume to
[5:17] accomplish this objective so she changed
[5:20] the way she looked the Bible is saying
[5:23] medal not with them that are given to
[5:25] change as one would disguise themselves
[5:28] or cause themselves to here in a way
[5:30] that they really aren't it says meddle
[5:32] not with them this word meddle uh to
[5:35] meddle not means to do not share with
[5:38] them or have fellowship with those that
[5:41] rebel against God as it says my son fear
[5:44] thou the Lord and the King it's not even
[5:47] if you can catch this it's not telling
[5:49] you not to be given to change you notice
[5:52] that it's assuming that that would
[5:55] already be established in your hearts to
[5:57] not be given to change so it says don't
[6:00] even meddle with them that are given to
[6:03] change we ourselves should not be
[6:05] rebellious against Authority we should
[6:07] not be rebellious against the Lord fear
[6:09] the lord and the king and those that do
[6:11] not fear the lord and those that would
[6:13] not fear Authority he says do not have
[6:16] fellowship with them or communion with
[6:18] them do not share with them now I
[6:21] realize that in using that language it
[6:22] could suggest that you you just ignore
[6:24] them you have nothing to do with them
[6:26] but you are not to be a partner with
[6:28] those who are given to change if there
[6:31] are those who are rebellious and those
[6:33] who are disguising themselves and those
[6:35] who do not fear the lord you do not want
[6:38] to be lumped in with
[6:45] them I think I saw some years ago one of
[6:49] these uh laugh thing there there's no I
[6:52] think it was in a doctor's office or
[6:54] something there's no there's no uh
[6:56] dialogue you just see the image and
[6:58] somebody's walking down
[7:00] a narrow alley and as they're walking
[7:01] all of a sudden a bunch of protesters
[7:03] come out behind them and then the police
[7:05] come out on the other side and they're
[7:06] kind of pranking the person who's
[7:08] walking along down the alley and they
[7:09] look guilty that they're leading this
[7:12] protest and the police are about to
[7:13] arrest everybody because they're in the
[7:15] mob and if I could say this it's one
[7:18] thing to be pranked it's another thing
[7:19] for you to join the mob or to be a part
[7:22] of something that is signaling that is
[7:24] protesting that is rebelling and the
[7:26] Bible says that we ought not to have
[7:27] fellowship or to be share with those who
[7:30] are given to change James 4: 4 it says
[7:35] ye adulterers and adulteresses this is a
[7:37] very important uh phrase adulterers and
[7:40] adulteresses know ye not that the
[7:42] Friendship of the world is enity with
[7:45] God it's remarkable that he is
[7:48] addressing an adulterer and reminds them
[7:52] that friendship of the world is enity
[7:54] with God there's some relationship
[7:57] between those who would actually commit
[7:59] adulter Y in a physical sense to Those
[8:01] who commit adultery in a spiritual sense
[8:04] that it's through the Friendship of the
[8:06] world and he says to be friends with the
[8:08] world is to be opposed or against God
[8:11] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[8:13] the world is the enemy of God when it
[8:16] says meddle not with them that are given
[8:17] to change there's some sort of
[8:19] connection and fellowship and
[8:21] identification or friendship with those
[8:23] that are given to change where you would
[8:25] be identified with them by the way that
[8:28] you look and your behavior and Bible
[8:31] says meddle not with them that are given
[8:33] to change and we could say it this way
[8:35] do not have friendship or communion or
[8:39] common this commonality with the with
[8:41] the world that's right 1 Thessalonians
[8:45] 5:22 abstain from all appearance of
[8:49] evil those things that you would see Son
[8:52] of God turn your head those things that
[8:54] you would uh display yourself you you
[8:57] ought not to do it and he's addressing
[9:00] adulterers those who are Unfaithful or
[9:02] derelict those who abandon their Duty
[9:05] fear thou the Lord and the word fear
[9:08] thou the Lord and the King fear
[9:10] Authority respect God and those who
[9:12] would not fear God or be faithful they
[9:15] would be the adulterers Unfaithful
[9:17] derelict in their
[9:18] Duty it's speaking of according the
[9:22] favor and if I can say this way
[9:24] according favor with the world or
[9:26] Conformity to the world is a declaration
[9:29] of war against God uses a very strong
[9:32] word enity it's not saying that God's
[9:34] kind of like that's a little sus he's
[9:36] saying no I hate that this is you're
[9:39] standing against me you're opposing me
[9:41] so according the favor of the world or
[9:43] Conformity with the world is standing
[9:45] against and opposing
[9:48] God James chapter 1: 27 says pure
[9:51] religion and undefiled before God and
[9:54] the father is this I love just how
[9:56] simple this is to visit the fatherless
[9:58] and widows and their Affliction and to
[10:00] keep himself unspotted from the
[10:04] world as we may not make it a practice
[10:06] of visiting the fatherless and the
[10:08] widows in their distress or in their
[10:10] need and as Society maybe has grown to a
[10:14] place to where the the the necessity of
[10:17] the local church or the Saints or even
[10:19] within our religion and our extended
[10:21] communities maybe that responsibility
[10:23] doesn't fall on us but I will say that
[10:25] this is an everyday duty of religion
[10:29] pure and undefiled before God is to keep
[10:32] ourselves
[10:33] unspotted from the world unspoiled or
[10:37] unstained Not blemished by the world in
[10:42] 1 John chap 2: 1516 and 17 and be a very
[10:48] uh just plotting through scripture today
[10:50] I was told Wednesday night that I set a
[10:52] record for the number of scriptures that
[10:54] I was you used in a service and I I
[10:56] didn't know there was a they were
[10:58] keeping track so now I kind feel
[10:59] compelled to break my
[11:03] PR I love not the world neither the
[11:06] things that are in the world it's very
[11:08] clear friendship of the world is enity
[11:11] with God those that will be a friend of
[11:13] the world is an enemy of God so love not
[11:16] the world neither the things that are in
[11:18] the world now in addressing subjects
[11:21] such as uh dress code and how a woman
[11:23] would dress and how a man would dress
[11:25] and you begin to identify things that
[11:27] relate to our appearance and it may seem
[11:30] to be somewhat restrictive and I think
[11:32] the way that a lot of us sometimes have
[11:34] either experienced this or utilized it
[11:37] it's been very kind of costic or judgy
[11:40] like did you see the length of that
[11:41] person's skirt or did you does their
[11:43] hair look trimmed and we're kind of
[11:45] always judging instead of examining
[11:47] ourselves and being Guided by the Holy
[11:49] Spirit as to what's taught in a way that
[11:51] we'd please the Lord or or those that we
[11:53] are uh joined with uh we kind of look at
[11:56] other people and we have our own
[11:57] measuring stick and so so I'm walking
[11:59] through this scripture so that you could
[12:01] see that there's a way and we'll show
[12:03] some others there's a way that there's
[12:05] truth that cannot be there is a truth
[12:08] that is unassailable though we deny it
[12:11] we we reject it at our own Peril and I
[12:13] believe it's a very clear truth in
[12:15] scripture in terms of the behavior of a
[12:17] man and a woman and the way that we
[12:19] ought to appear as Christians now there
[12:21] may be again some debate in there in
[12:24] terms of what you might think is modest
[12:25] and what you might think is Holy but I
[12:27] believe the word of God set some very
[12:29] clear parameters in that but regardless
[12:31] of what we would arrive at as this is
[12:34] how a woman should dress this is how a
[12:36] man should dress and if that was truth
[12:38] there's still a way that you can hold
[12:40] that truth the wrong
[12:41] way and use it as a weapon as as opposed
[12:45] to a resource love not the world neither
[12:47] the things that are in the world if any
[12:49] man love the world the love of the
[12:50] father is not in him for all that is in
[12:54] the world the big three the lust of the
[12:56] Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the
[12:58] pride of life
[12:59] this is what encapsulates all those
[13:02] negative influences in the world all
[13:04] those tendencies All Those passions all
[13:06] those displays it's either the lust of
[13:09] the flesh the lust of the eyes or the
[13:10] pride of life it was what was in the
[13:13] beginning in the temptation of the woman
[13:15] it was what was in the garden in the
[13:16] Temptation Of Christ or in the
[13:18] wilderness and the Temptation Of Christ
[13:20] it's what we face today in Satan's Eden
[13:23] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[13:24] eyes and the pride of life and these
[13:27] things the scripture says are not of the
[13:29] father but is of the
[13:31] world and the world passeth away and the
[13:33] lust thereof but he that doeth the will
[13:35] of God abideth forever there's your
[13:39] passing away you're changing you're
[13:41] altering the the world will pass away
[13:44] the lust
[13:45] change if you study the uh parameters of
[13:49] what was beautiful and what's desirable
[13:51] you'll find that there's some sort of
[13:52] cycle over a period of time is this is
[13:54] what is attractive and this isn't and
[13:56] this is what's desirable and this isn't
[13:58] and it TRS in fashion and it tracks in
[14:00] all sorts of levels in all sorts of
[14:02] different ways it changes it's always
[14:04] variable but he that does the will of
[14:07] God will abide forever because the will
[14:09] of God never changes God has a perfect
[14:12] will God's word will never change Heaven
[14:14] and Earth will pass away but God's word
[14:16] will never
[14:18] fail and as it's asking us to love not
[14:21] the world we know that there's a
[14:24] difference between as we might say agape
[14:26] love and fio love and how that this love
[14:29] of God or Agape Love Is the Love of
[14:32] intelligence and reason that has a
[14:34] corresponding purpose so it has a higher
[14:36] intelligence that's the intelligence of
[14:38] God and it it it's attached with a
[14:42] purpose beautiful example John 3:16 for
[14:45] God so loved the world it doesn't say
[14:47] period the end and we we have this
[14:50] directive that God having loved the
[14:52] world he just loved it says God so loved
[14:55] the world that he gave so that love that
[14:58] God would have has a corresponding
[15:01] purpose because it's a love of higher
[15:03] intelligence not just like God had
[15:04] feelings uh for the world it had it was
[15:07] a love of higher intelligence and it had
[15:09] a corresponding purpose that having
[15:12] loved his own he loved him under the end
[15:14] and so he taught them and he he reached
[15:16] out to them there's things that he did
[15:18] to express that love whereas that human
[15:22] love or we might say Pho love filio Love
[15:24] Is the Love of just personal affection
[15:26] or
[15:27] liking and it has no intelligence behind
[15:30] it or no higher purpose even if it is
[15:34] required so there may be the need for in
[15:38] that situation the corresponding purpose
[15:40] but if you just have F love even though
[15:42] it might be required by that
[15:44] relationship it doesn't have
[15:46] one and I I I realize I'm losing a lot
[15:50] of time just by walking through this but
[15:52] I think it's very important to be part
[15:53] of the fabric of what we're going
[15:54] forward God
[15:57] never had fio love for the world fi love
[16:01] he didn't have that love for the sinful
[16:03] world because God hates or abominates
[16:07] the sinful world all that is in the
[16:08] world the lust of the eyes the lust of
[16:10] the Flesh and the pride of life God
[16:12] hates they are not of God so God doesn't
[16:14] love that and in that sense we're not
[16:17] asked to have the fan love for our
[16:20] enemies or to love our enemies with this
[16:22] F
[16:23] love but to love with the love of God is
[16:26] what we're asked to
[16:27] do it's not filo love as we could say it
[16:30] towards the enemy or towards the world
[16:32] but he asked us to have agape love the
[16:36] agape love that we're to have it's a
[16:38] love of the world which comprehends what
[16:40] is wrong it's a love of those who are
[16:43] sinning it's a love for things that that
[16:46] are are deformed or perverted it's a
[16:48] love which comprehends and knows it has
[16:51] the intelligence of what is wrong in
[16:53] order to sanctify it and to convert it
[16:55] or to change it amen that if something
[16:58] is in fact ruined or something has been
[17:01] in fact destroyed uh and and there might
[17:03] be some sort of abomination that we
[17:05] ought to have a love for the thing it
[17:08] that that had that understands its need
[17:12] we can say hate the hate the sin Love
[17:14] The Sinner absolutely it's very hard
[17:16] sometimes to separate the sin from The
[17:19] Sinner it's very difficult to see
[17:20] someone doing something with a
[17:22] particular attitude and not just kind of
[17:24] paint the whole person inside and out
[17:26] with that brush and say I don't like him
[17:27] at all right amen but we ought to have
[17:29] the kind of love which comprehends at
[17:32] the core what is wrong so that we would
[17:35] pray that God would change the
[17:37] situation we can love somebody who's
[17:40] deeply in error we can love somebody
[17:41] who's rebellious against the word of God
[17:44] and we would want to have the
[17:45] intelligence or the mind of God to pray
[17:47] that God would change them not just say
[17:50] ah who cares because God cares Jude 23
[17:54] says and others Sav with fear this is
[17:56] incumbent upon us that we would have in
[17:59] some situation This Love This driving
[18:02] force that would pull them out of the
[18:04] fire and why is it that we would pull
[18:06] them out of the fire we hate even the
[18:08] Garment spotted by the
[18:11] flesh that we have we have this hate
[18:14] this DET detestation this abomination of
[18:18] the Garment spotted by the flesh spoiled
[18:21] by
[18:22] carnality this is how that we ought to
[18:25] be with that kind of love this kind of
[18:26] character and disposition we pull some
[18:29] from the fire saving them as it were
[18:31] because we hate just even if the Garment
[18:33] is spotted by the
[18:35] flesh the Bible says in Malachi 3:6 let
[18:38] me so give meddle not with them that are
[18:40] given to change these things that we're
[18:42] showing here the character of an
[18:44] unchanging God I am the Lord I change
[18:48] not Hebrews chapter 10: excuse me
[18:51] Hebrews chapter 1: 10 to 12 and thou
[18:54] Lord in the beginning Hast laid the
[18:56] foundation of the earth and the heavens
[18:57] are the works of thine hands they Shall
[19:00] Perish but thou remainest they all shall
[19:03] wax old as doth a
[19:05] garment and as a vesture shalt thou fold
[19:07] them up and they shall be changed we
[19:10] could see that about the worlds and the
[19:12] foundation thereof Heaven and Earth
[19:13] shall pass away but the word will never
[19:15] pass away We Know that heaven and Earth
[19:17] is going to be completely renewed and
[19:19] restored that which has been ruined will
[19:21] be
[19:22] restored they will be changed but thou
[19:24] God is never ruined Thou Art the same
[19:26] and thy years shall not fail
[19:29] even as we look at this as vestures will
[19:31] folded up and they're changed and rment
[19:33] will W wax old Fashions change Styles
[19:36] become outdated garments themselves will
[19:39] Decay but God never
[19:42] changes right really in one sense I
[19:45] believe brother Paul was telling me a
[19:46] story and they mentioning how that for
[19:50] him he realizes their Church isn't the
[19:51] cool church and I was like Hey neither
[19:53] are we we're kind of sister churches uh
[19:55] we're not the cool church either he said
[19:57] but he told his church but cool kids go
[19:59] to hell I was like whoa all right okay
[20:02] glad not to be a cool
[20:04] kid but there's a uh there's a way that
[20:07] we could say it to the Christian God's
[20:09] never out of
[20:11] style Christ Christianity the if our
[20:14] measurement of Christ and our
[20:16] understanding of Christ to something
[20:17] that we're constantly redefining so that
[20:20] he's relevant in a modern society then
[20:23] that's not Christ cuz he's never out of
[20:26] style though the Fashions May though the
[20:29] way that we dress may change through
[20:31] different periods and we might if we
[20:32] were Christians long ago we might all we
[20:34] would obviously look very very different
[20:36] seeing that Nike hadn't been invented
[20:38] yet and certain Styles and they didn't
[20:40] have these hybrid things like you know
[20:42] 97% cotton 3% spandex right it's like
[20:45] there's different things you could wear
[20:46] now that they didn't even know existed
[20:48] at the time so yes things would be
[20:51] different but Christ would still be in
[20:54] style to a
[20:56] believer in Romans 1:
[20:59] 18 I'm going to read to verse 32 I think
[21:01] I cut this short I might pick up on it
[21:03] later for the wrath of God is revealed
[21:06] from Heaven against all ungodliness and
[21:08] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[21:10] truth in
[21:12] unrighteousness that given the truth
[21:14] seeing the truth having an opportunity
[21:16] to understand or hear the truth that our
[21:18] response to it falls short of what we
[21:21] ought to do mixing what we hear with
[21:23] faith embracing it as the truth and God
[21:26] is saying I it is AB mination to me for
[21:29] the truth to be held in unrighteousness
[21:31] my wrath is going to be revealed against
[21:34] all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
[21:38] men meddle not with them that are given
[21:40] to change I believe this scripture
[21:42] begins to describe these circumstances
[21:44] because that which may be known of God
[21:46] is Manifest in them for God hath shown
[21:49] it unto them for the invisible things of
[21:51] him from the creation of the world are
[21:52] clearly seen being understood by the
[21:55] things that are made even his eternal
[21:57] power and godhead so that they are
[21:59] without excuse because that when they
[22:02] knew God they glorified him not as God
[22:04] neither were thankful remember fear the
[22:07] lord meddle not with them that are given
[22:09] to change but became vain in their
[22:11] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[22:14] darkened professing themselves to be
[22:16] wise they became fools notice this in
[22:18] verse 23 and changed the glory of the
[22:21] uncorruptible god into an image made
[22:24] like to corruptible
[22:26] man this could be this is in the uh the
[22:30] fashion of worshiping an idol worshiping
[22:34] a man or as it says into birds and forf
[22:36] footed beast and creeping things that
[22:38] there was a deifying of those things
[22:40] which were clearly not God but created
[22:42] by God and that they looked for deity or
[22:45] the Divine or the Eternal or the
[22:46] supernatural in a man or in creation and
[22:50] not God and where this is identified the
[22:54] most is in that man begin to worship
[22:57] himself and began to see himself as wise
[23:01] and became Vain and shallow and empty in
[23:04] his imagination and through his Foolish
[23:05] Heart becoming dark and becoming he's
[23:07] lifted up in Pride to deify himself and
[23:10] to worship
[23:12] himself could be argued that even the
[23:14] worship of another man or a bird
[23:17] ultimately is self-
[23:19] serving wherefore God also gave them up
[23:21] to
[23:22] uncleanness through the lust of their
[23:24] own Hearts God AB they're abandoned to
[23:26] it they are derel about God so God
[23:30] abandons them and they begin to dishonor
[23:33] their own bodies between themselves who
[23:36] changed the truth of God into a lie and
[23:39] worshiped and served the creature more
[23:41] than the Creator who is blessed forever
[23:45] amen the wrath of God is revealed on
[23:48] these and we see in the scripture that
[23:50] Calamity shall rise suddenly to those or
[23:53] for those who alter God's
[23:56] glory those that ch change the order of
[23:59] God's program those that Mar the image
[24:01] of God when we defile I want to say it
[24:04] this way when we defile God's image
[24:07] we're
[24:08] ruined when we change the order that God
[24:11] desires us to be in it becomes this
[24:13] ruining it's this process of Decay and
[24:17] destruction we become that work of God
[24:20] that has been marred or been spoiled
[24:23] there something that God made to be
[24:25] beautiful even the Bible goes to Great
[24:27] Lengths to say that when a man had found
[24:29] a wife he had found a good thing and
[24:32] that the that marriage is Honorable
[24:34] before God and there's a beauty then in
[24:37] humanity there's a beauty in creation
[24:39] God is even saying here in Romans
[24:40] chapter 1 that creation testifies of the
[24:43] glory of
[24:44] God and there's a way then that that
[24:46] beauty becomes marred it becomes uh
[24:49] destroyed it becomes perverted and the
[24:51] the image of God is no longer available
[24:53] or is no longer seen by through our own
[24:56] works and though there is a a Divine
[25:00] spark or there's something in man
[25:03] something great in man and I've seen it
[25:05] in my heart to see that if there's any
[25:07] good in man we've got to give God the
[25:09] glory that any goodness is of God that
[25:12] it does not arise organically within man
[25:15] but we'd have to trace it back to
[25:16] something about God that still
[25:18] reverberates even in those who don't
[25:20] believe in God but they're decent and
[25:21] they're honest and they treat people
[25:23] with
[25:24] respect but when we defile the image of
[25:28] or we forsake the will of God we become
[25:31] ruined we're no longer reflecting the
[25:34] purpose of
[25:36] God in Deuteronomy chapter
[25:39] 22:5 I hope that Foundation helps us to
[25:42] go
[25:44] um to go deeper into this subject here
[25:47] in Deuteronomy chapter
[25:49] 22:5 the woman shall not wear that which
[25:53] pertaineth unto a man neither shall a
[25:56] man put on a woman's garment
[25:58] I believe the scripture is very clear we
[26:00] know that this is in the context of the
[26:03] Old Testament in a list of other various
[26:05] laws but this one is qualified by saying
[26:09] for all that do so the person who would
[26:12] wear the Garment of the opposite gender
[26:15] is abomination unto the Lord thy God
[26:18] right we used uh deceptive form as the
[26:21] title when we first addressed this and
[26:24] to dress and to act like the opposite
[26:27] gender is a form of
[26:29] deception I think this helps us
[26:31] understand why the devil's trying to
[26:32] cause so much confusion where we live
[26:35] today where there's people can identify
[26:39] as something other than what is even
[26:41] possible and that there's more there's
[26:43] this multiplicity or sliding scale of
[26:45] genders and there's gender identities
[26:47] that different people can have and what
[26:49] just several years ago was a diagnosable
[26:52] mental illness they have now changed
[26:55] through political pressure and and
[26:57] trying to be more accomodating they'
[26:58] changed it to say no these aren't uh
[27:02] these aren't uh textbook uh mental
[27:04] illnesses these are just uh this isn't
[27:07] gender dysmorph this is just people this
[27:09] is the way that we are as humans and I
[27:12] it's incredibly fascinating just kind of
[27:13] throwing this out there we can discuss
[27:15] this maybe later in a breakout session
[27:17] but as soon as they remove all those
[27:19] classifications from the DSM what's
[27:22] happened all the other mental illnesses
[27:24] are on the rise we have more mental
[27:26] illness than we've ever had before even
[27:29] as they're trying to remove de
[27:31] designations more are cropping up so how
[27:34] long is it until they finally just say
[27:35] you know being crazy isn't
[27:38] crazy you know being depressed you you
[27:40] identify as Eeyore that's
[27:43] fine and they begin to just take these
[27:45] things out and it just everyone gets
[27:47] their their
[27:48] medication but it's a there is a these
[27:52] things for someone to I I guess I need
[27:54] to back out of that that going down that
[27:56] trail that I think this is one of the
[27:58] reasons why there's so much confusion
[28:00] because if if the devil can get us
[28:02] debating uh uh these political points we
[28:06] miss the point that there is a there's
[28:08] air in not being what God made you to
[28:11] be it's Abomination it's a disgusting
[28:14] thing to God by nature and design male
[28:17] and female are different we looked at
[28:19] that in the scripture and therefore
[28:21] being different by Nature man now being
[28:24] clothed by the direction of God it is
[28:26] necessary and it's proper to honor those
[28:29] differences in the way that we
[28:31] dress the Garment itself the scripture
[28:34] saying is not the Abomination but the
[28:36] person perverting their form is
[28:39] abomination now I'd like to spend maybe
[28:42] the remainder of our morning on uh kind
[28:46] of these two points that God and there's
[28:49] other ways that we could build this but
[28:51] I want you to see this very clearly in
[28:52] scripture some of it will be reviewed
[28:54] some of it will be further stepped for a
[28:56] man to dress like a woman or a woman to
[28:58] dress like a man it violates two
[29:00] different principles in the word of God
[29:02] the principle of a role of the
[29:04] individual the gender the role of sex or
[29:07] the headship and identification so it's
[29:10] that principle of roles the principle of
[29:12] relationship to one another and it's a
[29:15] principle of modesty or if I can say
[29:17] sexual
[29:18] attraction in 1 Peter chapter 3: 1 to
[29:22] five we'll just read to verse five I may
[29:24] have had six there but it says likewise
[29:26] ye wives be in subjection to your own
[29:28] husbands now this isn't a force
[29:30] subjection this subjection that is asked
[29:32] of the wife is one in which she
[29:35] voluntarily uh uh serves together with
[29:38] and subjects herself to her husband as
[29:40] the head it's not the same type of
[29:43] subjection that children are asked to
[29:44] give their parents children having no
[29:47] autonomy or no Free Will and even some
[29:49] cases the the no capacity whatsoever to
[29:53] to accomplish their own will uh they are
[29:56] asked to submit with great
[29:58] emphasis than the woman cuz the woman
[30:01] she is a woman she's an adult but she's
[30:04] asked to submit in an arrangement and an
[30:07] order to her husband that if any obey
[30:09] not the word they also May without the
[30:12] word be won by the conversation of the
[30:14] wives you see the clear intent that by
[30:17] having a healthy relationship with your
[30:18] unbelieving husband your submission to
[30:22] him your aiding your your help your
[30:24] togetherness your continuity will win
[30:27] them right while they behold your chased
[30:30] conversation coupled with fear who's
[30:32] adorning this woman who is in subject to
[30:34] her husband so this adornment is spoken
[30:37] of in context of her relationship and
[30:40] her role and her identification to her
[30:42] husband her adorning let it not be the
[30:44] outward adorning of platting the hair
[30:45] and of wearing of gold or putting on of
[30:47] apparel that should not be her Cosmos
[30:50] that should not be her
[30:51] world if she's a married woman and she
[30:54] spends all her time dolling herself up
[30:58] wouldn't be much of a Ministry or
[31:00] continuity or friendship or fellowship
[31:03] with the husband some maybe just pure
[31:06] logic we could give here the husband
[31:10] looks at his wife and he's like where
[31:12] are you going at 9:30 in the morning I'm
[31:14] just going to fries it's like dress like
[31:20] that and I guess anymore we don't think
[31:22] twice about it pretty soon all of us are
[31:24] going to be wearing yoga pants
[31:29] let it not be the outward adorning but
[31:31] let it be the hidden man of the heart so
[31:33] now it speaks to something within the
[31:34] woman's character in that which is not
[31:36] corruptible even the ornament the
[31:38] adorning the dress the fashion of a Meek
[31:41] and quiet Spirit which is in the sight
[31:42] of God of great price that which God
[31:45] values the opposite of abomination for
[31:48] after this manner in Old Time the holy
[31:49] women also who trusted in God first
[31:52] trusted in God not their husbands right
[31:54] guys we realize maybe we're not the most
[31:56] trustworthy character but trust in
[31:59] God God bless you brother for raising
[32:01] your hand I got someone who's a partner
[32:03] with me right there we we maybe our
[32:05] lives and our testimony do not speak of
[32:07] you could trust him at all times and
[32:08] maybe we get what we ask for but
[32:10] trusting in God you can Adorn
[32:13] yourself in your fashion in your dress
[32:15] the way that you do your hair the way
[32:16] that you present yourself the way that
[32:18] what things you wear being in in the
[32:20] context of your subjection to your own
[32:24] husband what's it showing that the
[32:26] reason why God would say it's
[32:28] Abomination to me for a woman to dress
[32:31] like her husband or to dress like a man
[32:33] it's because they are to they are set in
[32:36] relationship to their husband it's part
[32:38] of their togetherness it's part of their
[32:41] Oneness in Ezekiel chapter 16 verse3 use
[32:46] uh it's God is using the example of this
[32:50] kind of woman to show Israel what
[32:51] they're being very literally in their
[32:54] relationship to God and with other
[32:56] nations how weak is thine
[32:59] heart Peter is admonishing this
[33:02] believing woman that she be strengthened
[33:04] the inner man to where it is the hidden
[33:06] man of the heart which is a Meek and
[33:08] quiet spirit that that's her world
[33:09] that's what she's projecting that is
[33:11] what is at the Forefront so God says how
[33:14] weak is thine heart sayith the Lord God
[33:15] seeing thou doest all these things and
[33:17] you can go back and read the Litany of
[33:19] things that they were doing and they're
[33:21] described as the work of an imperious
[33:23] horish
[33:25] woman quite a mouthful another way of
[33:28] saying it would be a dominating
[33:30] Unfaithful female imperious means
[33:33] domineering it's the work these things
[33:35] are the work this unfaithfulness the
[33:37] work of a domineering a woman who is out
[33:40] of her place a woman who is now acting
[33:44] through Rule and through Authority
[33:45] through force and intimidation perhaps
[33:47] manipulation acting upon her own lust or
[33:49] for her own gain this dominating spirit
[33:52] that is horish and that's a very strong
[33:54] word but it means unfaithful to in their
[33:57] relationship ER in their
[34:01] vow these things that the scripture
[34:03] speaks of to say that a woman should
[34:05] dress a certain way and a man should
[34:06] dress a certain way has to do with what
[34:08] they are by nature and the way that
[34:10] they're positioned and ordered with the
[34:13] opposite gender and their relationships
[34:16] even in the relationship to their
[34:18] children therefore I could say that
[34:20] Christians ought to dress in a manner
[34:21] that complements their nature and their
[34:24] purpose and here we're seeing that's in
[34:26] relationship to their
[34:29] spouse now I just debated on just how
[34:32] much detail to get into here and um I'll
[34:36] cue this next slide up brother John once
[34:37] we get there just not sure where this
[34:39] will
[34:40] land but if we could just say
[34:46] uh the I saw a single panel comic one
[34:49] time where a a mailman was delivering a
[34:52] letter and it says it's addressed to the
[34:53] elephant in the room and there was an
[34:55] elephant in the room and so let's just
[34:59] mention the elephant pants trousers
[35:03] slacks the with respect to Western
[35:06] Society where we liveed to Western
[35:08] civilization and what we would call
[35:09] slacks or trousers or pants I'm not um
[35:12] getting into things in the Eastern
[35:13] Society but I'm only mentioning this for
[35:16] your edification to recognize how some
[35:18] of these principles relate when it comes
[35:20] to wearing pants it has become it became
[35:23] more socially acceptable for a woman to
[35:25] wear pants once they begin to enter the
[35:27] workforce
[35:28] prior to that it was not even a
[35:31] question
[35:33] and in 2018 we'll go ahead queue it up
[35:36] right here in 2018 there was an article
[35:38] now this is on me don't worry in 2018
[35:40] there was an article I think an InStyle
[35:42] magazine I don't know some of you all
[35:43] get there get instu I don't but this was
[35:46] the headline of the magazine or this was
[35:48] one of the Articles did you know women
[35:49] could be arrested for wearing pants in
[35:51] public up until
[35:53] 1940 now of course all the witches would
[35:57] say that that's the patriarchy right and
[35:59] that's what we're trying to burn down
[36:00] that's what we're trying to destroy but
[36:02] the reality was that even some things
[36:04] were legislated and against the law for
[36:07] a woman not to wear pants even up to the
[36:10] 1940s thank you brother John that's just
[36:12] something for you to consider in the
[36:14] 1920s as I've been reading through some
[36:16] of these fashion uh these books on
[36:18] fashion and the histories of these
[36:19] things it the statement was made that
[36:22] after the first the Great War we call it
[36:24] the fir the world war first world war
[36:27] world one that after the destruction and
[36:30] Devastation of that time you had what
[36:32] was the Roaring 20s and and there was
[36:35] kind of a change in society and they
[36:36] said that himym lines Rose from the
[36:38] floor to the ankles and continue to rise
[36:41] from there on up and that you in the 20s
[36:44] you had uh if you want to kind of maybe
[36:47] you could read I think all of us
[36:49] probably had to read great G read The
[36:51] Great Gatsby if we went to public school
[36:54] and what's the image of that the flapper
[36:56] girl and they're actually trying to
[36:58] throw off a feminine look and and so uh
[37:03] the they wore uh real cylinder clothing
[37:06] and bulky boots that are untied and they
[37:08] cut their hair and they wore hats and
[37:11] there was somewhat of this boyish
[37:12] flapper look where they're rebelling
[37:15] against their
[37:17] femininity and that begins this process
[37:19] of changing the way the woman would
[37:21] dress to where it by the 1940s as that
[37:23] article detailed what was once
[37:26] scandalous became acceptable fashion for
[37:29] women at one time it was scandalous then
[37:32] as you evolve into the 60s and I know
[37:34] I'm jumping a couple decades each there
[37:36] there were these social and cultural
[37:37] factors that influenced fashion that
[37:40] paved the way for our what have become
[37:43] our modern societal Norms where now
[37:46] there's such a plurality of of
[37:48] representation and expression and what
[37:51] it what it was identified as is you had
[37:53] this particular look and role of a woman
[37:57] in the history of our nation from the
[37:58] 1700s and the 1800s and as women begin
[38:02] to enter the workforce in the early
[38:03] 1900s and as Society begin to change
[38:06] from agrarian to more uh uh City Life
[38:09] and Industrial life there was this
[38:11] throwing off of and rejecting of what
[38:13] they called These Old stuffy views and
[38:16] certainly if you saw the way that women
[38:18] dressed uh for social reasons and
[38:20] dressed with it even within the home
[38:22] you'd find that it would be really hard
[38:24] to be a good secretary in an office if
[38:26] you're wearing a dress that kind of poop
[38:27] out to here how big would the office
[38:30] need to
[38:31] be and so there was a change and apparel
[38:34] to adapt to their entering into the
[38:36] workforce and you'll find that what
[38:38] necessitated birth control was women
[38:41] working prior to that it wasn't NE the
[38:44] the glorification of it or the ne
[38:46] necessity of it or this this path for a
[38:50] woman to succeed corporately so to
[38:53] speak in order once that was open in
[38:56] order for her to be able to to go down
[38:57] that path she couldn't run the risk of
[38:59] being out for a while and that gave rise
[39:02] to birth control this is not a Christian
[39:04] proposition this is an academic
[39:07] fact and what began to rise is this
[39:10] individualism and self-expression where
[39:13] you could dress how you want act how you
[39:14] want you could pursue the things that
[39:16] you desired to pursue and it might come
[39:19] as a shock to you that on January 31st
[39:22] 2013 just 12 years ago my math may be
[39:25] off a little bit but just roughly 12
[39:27] years ago it became legal finally in
[39:29] France for women to wear
[39:31] trousers it had been illegal all that
[39:34] time and the law specifically required
[39:36] for women to get permission from the
[39:39] police to in their words dress as a
[39:45] manow I I know sometime our relationship
[39:48] with the French is always changing not
[39:49] the Canadian not keka but the you know
[39:51] the France Frenchies right a
[39:53] relationship with them's always
[39:55] changing we want can to stay Canada but
[39:59] Quebec's always wanted to be Quebec so
[40:02] Trump could have the rest of them
[40:04] right but there's there is this their
[40:07] their own laws spoke that to wear pants
[40:10] was a garment that pertained to a man
[40:12] and if you were to wear it you had to
[40:14] have specific permission or you could
[40:17] get
[40:21] arrested this all connects back to how
[40:24] our manner of dress or our garments
[40:27] reflect our our nature and ought to
[40:30] reflect our calling and our
[40:34] relationship I could s spend more time
[40:37] on that part of the role that a man has
[40:40] as the reason why a man should uh be a
[40:43] certain way even in the way that he
[40:45] dresses and the way that he acts and
[40:46] it's out of respect for his wife and the
[40:49] same is a way that a woman ought to
[40:50] dress and act and it's out of respect
[40:51] for her
[40:53] husband we'll continue in this so that
[40:55] it doesn't leave anybody out in terms of
[40:57] of what the particulars may be of your
[40:59] marital status but in 1 Timothy 2: 9 and
[41:03] 10 it says in like manner also that
[41:05] women Adorn themselves in modest apparel
[41:07] that's a very straightforward matter of
[41:10] fact statement women should dress
[41:13] modestly we could debate what is modest
[41:17] we may even debate what is inm modest
[41:20] and we might just come to the conclusion
[41:22] as some Supreme Court justices have to
[41:24] say I know it when I see it but it is a
[41:27] fact that a woman is to dress modestly
[41:31] and not just modestly but to do it with
[41:33] shamefacedness and
[41:35] sobriety I'm sure we've all found
[41:37] ourselves in situation where someone may
[41:39] have been dressed for all intented
[41:41] purposes appropriate for the occasion
[41:43] and somewhat modest but we found that
[41:45] there was no shamefacedness or
[41:48] sobriety and that goes on to describe
[41:50] certain things that were also mentioned
[41:52] in Peter as far as braided hair or gold
[41:54] or pearls or costly array
[41:58] a woman should Adorn themselves in
[42:00] modest apparel and it is it's written to
[42:02] say and not with broaded hair not with
[42:04] gold or pearls or costly arrate there's
[42:06] a lot to consider there a lot to try to
[42:08] figure out just how that would look
[42:10] today but they ought to Adorn themselves
[42:13] with good works they ought to dress in a
[42:16] way that is a good work but adorned but
[42:19] with which becometh women professing
[42:22] godliness Adorn themselves with good
[42:26] works women should Adorn themselves
[42:28] dress cover themselves with modest well
[42:31] arranged seamly it's fitting of good
[42:34] appearance for something to be modest
[42:36] it's suited to the purpose for which
[42:39] they are dressed and for their
[42:44] character this is why I think
[42:47] when brother brandom has asked certain
[42:49] questions about you know is it okay for
[42:51] the kids to wear this and is it okay for
[42:53] a woman to wear this to go to bed and
[42:54] brother br's like why are you asking all
[42:57] these
[42:58] questions I want not to consider what is
[43:02] appropriate in terms of for the purpose
[43:04] and for the occasion one would dress
[43:05] themselves
[43:06] modestly somebody who lives by
[43:09] themselves and all alone may may be able
[43:11] to conduct themselves in a way that is
[43:14] modest for being all alone in your home
[43:16] but if you have children you might want
[43:17] to give more thought as to how you would
[43:19] dress at
[43:21] home so modesty has to do with a fitting
[43:25] appearance it's suited for your purpose
[43:27] but also your
[43:28] character the very purpose of clothing
[43:31] is to surround or cover the
[43:33] body that's what God gave them clothes
[43:36] for in the very beginning man and I
[43:38] don't know if I'll have time to get to
[43:39] this man in the beginning just used a
[43:41] loin cloth and consider themselves our
[43:44] nakedness is covered God said that's not
[43:46] what clothes ought to do clothing should
[43:48] surround and cover the
[43:50] body but with that the purpose that
[43:53] dress ought to cover the body dress can
[43:56] also disclose and discover the
[43:58] body you following me stick with me here
[44:02] and everybody who majored in fashion in
[44:04] college get behind me
[44:06] now clothing will cover the body but
[44:09] clothing can also be used to discover
[44:12] the
[44:13] body garments have a particular power to
[44:16] articulate the
[44:17] flesh there's a way that things could be
[44:20] worn in ways that garments could be
[44:21] structured to where it causes Allure or
[44:24] it draws
[44:25] attention I want to be one of those come
[44:28] on somebody preachers or amen preachers
[44:30] but I need a little help right now it's
[44:31] getting late on there is a way that we
[44:35] can choose to dress that draws
[44:39] attention and I'm not just speaking in
[44:41] terms of
[44:42] color and I'm not just talking about in
[44:44] terms of such uniqueness that we could
[44:46] maybe spend some time later and that
[44:48] there was a way that people dressed just
[44:51] so that they could express how rich they
[44:53] were there was a law I believe it was in
[44:55] France that b anybody but royalty from
[44:59] wearing boots or high
[45:01] heels and so that you could just by
[45:04] looking down no this guy is big
[45:07] stuff and there was a black market for
[45:10] you know shoes with hills then but this
[45:13] was this was a dress can be conspicuous
[45:16] conspicuous spending status symbols I've
[45:19] always wanted to own a very rare Supreme
[45:23] hoodie just so that by the chance that
[45:25] anyone's you know old enough yet now to
[45:28] know what that might be might be like
[45:29] whoa Is that real is that a legit one
[45:32] like I think so paid 20 bucks for
[45:38] it things that kind of catch the
[45:42] eye and a woman's apparel the Bible is
[45:46] saying here should not appeal to the
[45:48] lust of the
[45:51] eyes it's this is this is the world as
[45:53] we already read this this world
[45:57] the world is not to be lusted
[45:59] after by you that is not the the world
[46:02] that should not become your world nor
[46:04] are the things of the world what you
[46:05] should be Desiring and you do not want
[46:07] to be lusted after by the
[46:10] world so Paul is teaching that we ought
[46:13] to give care and he's saying this to the
[46:14] women to not dress and this is the
[46:16] phrase that I found from a a fashion
[46:19] writer a form of objectification in
[46:22] service of the male
[46:25] gaze you dress in a way where you can be
[46:27] objectified in order to serve a man
[46:31] looking at
[46:33] you this is how the Fashion World to
[46:37] describe the Advent and the rise of
[46:40] pants and other things that would expose
[46:42] shoulder or mid drift or form that these
[46:45] things were done as a form of
[46:46] objectification in service of the male
[46:50] gaze that it would cause one to look and
[46:53] to desire to get their attention for 1
[46:57] Corinthians 6: 18 to2 it says flee
[47:00] fornication a lot of ways that we could
[47:02] and this these scriptures could be
[47:04] unpacked to Great length in them of
[47:06] themselves that hurtful scandalous
[47:09] behavior that is Unbecoming of a
[47:11] Christian this fornication here is an
[47:14] uncleanness of one's Spirit it speaks to
[47:16] a physical uh uh Indulgence and it can
[47:19] be a a feeling and a satisfying of one's
[47:23] lust either to satisfy lust or who also
[47:28] do it for their own
[47:30] gain someone just because someone's
[47:32] getting paid or just because someone's
[47:35] not getting paid doesn't mean they're
[47:36] not prostituting themselves that's what
[47:38] the scripture speaks of one who would do
[47:40] it to consume it to satisfy themselves
[47:43] or their own desires or they would
[47:44] actually have to do it for monetary gain
[47:47] every sin that a man doeth is without
[47:49] the body but he that committeth
[47:50] fornication sinth against his own body
[47:53] here's a specific sin that is a sin
[47:55] against yourself
[47:57] what know you not that your body is the
[47:59] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[48:02] which you have of God and you are not
[48:03] your own that's right therefore this
[48:06] body as God gave great care and was very
[48:08] detailed as to how the temple was to be
[48:11] ornamented and be adorned and he was
[48:13] very particular about each phase I
[48:14] believe God has a special thought about
[48:16] how men and women ought to dress in the
[48:18] same way that the temple was looked
[48:20] after this body which is a temple ought
[48:22] to be clothed in a way that glorifies
[48:25] God's inner heart and
[48:27] desire your body is a temple of the Holy
[48:30] Ghost for you are bought with the price
[48:32] verse 20 therefore glorify God in your
[48:35] body and in your spirit which are
[48:38] Gods there ought to be a glorification
[48:41] of God in our body it's these very
[48:44] principles that could speak to the to
[48:46] reasons why scripturally one wouldn't
[48:48] want to mark up their body with ink why
[48:51] one might not want to Mark or deform
[48:53] their body through
[48:55] piercings this isn't Clos line this
[48:57] isn't just lining up The Usual Suspects
[49:00] a and just railing against you you gaze
[49:02] with that earring in your ear well all
[49:04] right whatever that's maybe not the
[49:07] right way to address
[49:08] that is the very guy who rails the most
[49:11] against those things is the one who is
[49:13] in fact probably struggling with that
[49:15] and can't bring it back to a scriptural
[49:17] principle so they rail against the thing
[49:18] they can't overcome and the thing that
[49:20] they
[49:21] hate but there's a tremendous principle
[49:24] here for us to recognize that we are
[49:25] ought to glorify go with our
[49:28] bodies if there was something that was
[49:30] overtly uh signaling a lifestyle overtly
[49:34] signaling a a a a sexual proclivity I
[49:37] myself would want to avoid
[49:39] that uh I hope it's okay for me to say
[49:42] this but you know just being the dad
[49:43] that I was I didn't know what it meant
[49:45] uh but I was talking to a group of young
[49:47] people and I referenced you know Netflix
[49:49] and chill found out later what that
[49:51] meant I was
[49:52] like didn't mean to do that now I've
[49:54] done it again but the point is if you
[49:56] know something's wrong and you know that
[49:59] it might uh uh be taken the wrong way or
[50:02] give somebody reason to believe that
[50:04] you're into those things or you have
[50:05] that kind of Desire flee all appearance
[50:08] of evil glorify God with your body with
[50:12] the clothing you put on your body and
[50:14] don't let the dress you put on your body
[50:17] Discover
[50:18] it and disclose it in ways that don't
[50:21] glorify
[50:22] God in 1 Thessalonians 4: 1-8
[50:26] furthermore then we beseech you Brethren
[50:27] and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as
[50:29] you have received of us how you ought to
[50:31] walk and to please God so ye W would B
[50:35] abound more and more notice the the the
[50:38] the purpose of this this is agape love
[50:41] that there's a love with the
[50:42] corresponding purpose I'm not teaching
[50:44] you and exhorting you how to walk and to
[50:46] please God so that we could signal to
[50:48] everybody we're more righteous but that
[50:50] our lives would abound more and more
[50:53] that we would experience a greater
[50:54] deliverance from distress we would
[50:55] experience a greater Liberty from
[50:57] depression we would find ourselves set
[50:59] at Liberty to be able to discern
[51:01] difficulties in relationships with other
[51:02] people that we could properly raise our
[51:04] children that we would not have fear of
[51:06] debt that we would not have fear of
[51:07] Destruction and disease so that we can
[51:09] walk clean and pure in our lives Paul is
[51:12] teaching us and the word of God teaches
[51:13] us how to live so that we can not only
[51:16] please God but our Spirits be Freer and
[51:19] Freer little do some people know that
[51:22] the the rat race of fashion and kicking
[51:24] back against the clear scriptions in the
[51:27] word of God to not dress a certain way
[51:28] or act a certain way the very fact that
[51:30] they're fighting against it's the reason
[51:32] why they struggle with Suicidal Thoughts
[51:34] the reason why they struggle with eating
[51:35] disorders the reason why they struggle
[51:37] so much with being accepted is because
[51:39] they won't just accept the grace of God
[51:42] and walk with the desire to please him
[51:44] they and their Spirits would abound
[51:46] greater and greater and more and more
[51:49] for you know what Commandments we gave
[51:51] you by the Lord Jesus so these are the
[51:53] Commandments he gave that they ought to
[51:54] walk in please God so that they could
[51:57] experience a greater Liberty and
[51:59] happiness and freedom and a greater
[52:00] success for this is the will of God even
[52:03] your
[52:04] sanctification that you should abstain
[52:06] from
[52:07] fornication this is the will of God that
[52:10] you should abstain from fornication not
[52:12] only does it please God but it keeps you
[52:14] Sanctified this fornication of this word
[52:16] has its roots in pornoo and that word in
[52:19] the scripture these the things that
[52:20] relate to lust and the satisfaction of
[52:23] it I believe it has a much broader
[52:25] application as we'll see
[52:28] that every one of you should know how to
[52:29] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[52:32] honor not in the lust of concupisent
[52:35] even as the Gentiles which know not God
[52:37] that no man go beyond and defraud his
[52:40] brother in any manner so speaking about
[52:43] how that your brother the other
[52:46] person is impacted by your
[52:49] lust how that you could defraud and take
[52:52] away and injure your brother and it
[52:55] speaks specifically what a man might do
[52:57] and lusting after his neighbor's wife or
[52:59] what a man might do by uh defiling
[53:01] himself with his brother's wife because
[53:04] that the Lord is the Avenger of all such
[53:06] as we also have forewarned you and
[53:09] testified speaking to fleeing
[53:12] fornication abstain from all appearance
[53:14] of evil I know I'm lumping a lot of
[53:15] things in but there's a direct
[53:17] connection to way that we can dress to
[53:19] discover our body and what it would
[53:20] cause another person to do to these very
[53:22] things of fleeing
[53:24] fornication just as Tamar dressed in a
[53:28] way to signal to Judah that she was
[53:30] available just in a way that she
[53:32] presented herself so that she could her
[53:35] character the character she's trying to
[53:36] assume she dressed in a way to get his
[53:39] attention for
[53:40] that for God hath not called us unto
[53:44] uncleanness but unto
[53:46] Holiness he therefore that despiseth
[53:49] despiseth not man but God he that
[53:52] despises the Commandment he that
[53:54] despises the word of God that says all
[53:56] that do so or Abomination the
[53:57] Commandment that says be uh uh to Adorn
[54:00] yourself in modest apparel to com to
[54:02] flee fornication all that despise that
[54:05] are not despising
[54:07] man I trust that today that as I go
[54:10] through these things with this great
[54:11] weight and burden in my heart and with
[54:13] great resistance from the enemy that
[54:15] what I'm sharing with you is reflective
[54:17] of God's heart and if you despise it
[54:20] you're not despising me if there's
[54:22] somebody in your past who has used these
[54:24] things to control you only ultimately
[54:27] abuse you and violate these very
[54:29] things and use these things as a means
[54:32] of sub subjugating people and covering
[54:34] themselves with their own loin claws if
[54:36] it doesn't matter it's not despising the
[54:38] man though they may use this to abuse
[54:40] you but you despise God when you reject
[54:42] his Commandments and it's not just God
[54:46] but God who's given us his Holy
[54:48] Spirit what a beautiful loop back in to
[54:50] say that he is not just your God and
[54:53] your lord who's lording over you but
[54:54] he's given you a Holy Spirit by with
[54:56] which you can stay
[54:58] clean Proverbs 6:23 to 26 the Bible even
[55:02] in Psalm says how can a young man stay
[55:04] pure and clean says take heat according
[55:06] to the word of God for the Commandment
[55:08] is a lamp and the law is light and
[55:10] reproofs of instruction are the way of
[55:12] life God's word this word that we're
[55:14] reading from today I believe the message
[55:16] of the hour is a lamp it is a light and
[55:19] it is a Repro for the way of life am to
[55:22] keep thee from the evil woman
[55:26] from the flattery of the tongue of a
[55:28] strange woman and if I can say to keep
[55:30] you from being that too if you are a
[55:32] woman lust not after her beauty in thine
[55:34] heart neither let her take thy thee with
[55:36] her eyelids for by means of a horish
[55:39] woman a man is brought to a piece of
[55:42] bread and the adulteress will hunt for
[55:45] the precious Life the game is a
[55:49] foot there is this is the pressure we
[55:51] live in today this is Leo deia it's a
[55:54] woman's world it's a woman's age not a
[55:57] woman who's dressed right but a woman
[55:59] that has been stripped down and made
[56:00] bare of any sense of modesty or
[56:03] decency and the instruction is the
[56:06] Commandment is your light the word of
[56:08] God is your reprove it's for they are
[56:11] the way of life don't be drawn away from
[56:14] the by the evil woman don't let the
[56:15] flatter the tongue of a strange woman
[56:17] lust not after her beauty there's a true
[56:20] beauty that God has designed you to
[56:22] hunger for there is a thirst to be
[56:24] beautiful but there's also a perverse of
[56:26] that thirst that would cause you to
[56:28] pursue attention and even relationships
[56:30] to feel some sort of
[56:34] acceptance and to feel that you're
[56:36] valued brother BR said one word of God
[56:39] displaced spoils the whole picture it's
[56:43] all satan had to do in the beginning is
[56:45] just misplace one word in this beautiful
[56:48] uh scene this beautiful work of art
[56:50] became
[56:51] ruined in Proverbs 7: 6 to2 well let me
[56:55] stop I I I if I think if I go further I
[56:58] may just have to finish it all
[57:01] so it's 11:30 it's about the time I
[57:05] started should we take a
[57:07] vote all right you and me all right you
[57:10] help me out
[57:12] here I I will just obey the Lord and be
[57:14] very careful about our time here I know
[57:16] we're going to be coming back this
[57:17] afternoon we'll just get straight into
[57:18] communion and feet washing this this
[57:20] evening in Proverbs Chapter 7: 6-2 for
[57:23] at the wind window of thy house I looked
[57:25] through thy my casement the window of my
[57:27] house this is just the Observer I look
[57:29] through my casement that's a
[57:31] advertisement for casement windows and
[57:33] beheld among the simple ones I discerned
[57:35] among the youths a young man void of
[57:37] understanding these we could think of
[57:39] fleeing youthful lust where you're
[57:42] driven more by passion and desire and
[57:44] the satisfaction of of it other than
[57:46] rather than the wisdom that says there's
[57:48] a consequence for this I say this to all
[57:51] men there's a consequence for lust
[57:53] there's a consequence for your behavior
[57:54] there's a consequence for the images
[57:56] that you see and the things that you do
[57:58] and often times the consequences is far
[58:00] beyond yourself but the consequences to
[58:03] others you may never ever be able to
[58:09] outrun passing through the street near
[58:11] her Corner the young man and he went the
[58:13] way of her
[58:15] house right probably knew what he was
[58:18] doing just that way sometimes that we
[58:20] could Meander close enough to something
[58:23] so we could get a glimpse in the
[58:24] Twilight in the evening the black and
[58:26] dark night that's called incognito
[58:30] mode and behold there met him a woman
[58:33] with the attire of a harlot and subtle
[58:36] of heart she is loud and stubborn her
[58:40] feet abide not in her
[58:42] house why why does the scripture say
[58:44] that she has a
[58:45] place circumstances have thrust a woman
[58:48] out of her home there's a protection
[58:49] that God will give her out of her
[58:51] home as it's as it has need of God's Not
[58:55] So harsh to say well sorry sister you
[58:57] got to work you're just going to be
[58:58] abandoned and you're going to be eaten
[58:59] up by the world no he'll bless it he'll
[59:01] look out after it and you'll watch their
[59:02] testimony flourish even in the face of
[59:05] them having to work and to provide and
[59:07] take the place of a husband he's sick or
[59:10] or absentee but this is a woman who's
[59:12] loud and stubborn she's rebellious she's
[59:14] given to change her feet abide not in
[59:17] her house she's bantering about she's
[59:19] out talking she is without now in the
[59:21] streets and lith in weight at every
[59:23] corner and notice the Bible says that
[59:26] she's wearing the fit of a harlot the
[59:31] attire the dress of one who is a
[59:35] harlot whether it be in the form of the
[59:37] showy or Gody garments that would signal
[59:39] her availability or in the short and
[59:42] revealing clothing of the Romans to say
[59:44] this is H uh what the character I have
[59:47] this is what I've assumed and and and
[59:49] advertises that but in some way
[59:54] signifying this is what their character
[59:56] is the word even signifies clothing
[59:58] that's fit fitted to her body that's
[1:00:00] very neat and well-shaped in order to
[1:00:03] recommend
[1:00:05] her so modest apparel is going to be
[1:00:08] judged by these things when I say judged
[1:00:11] I'm saying this is how you ought to
[1:00:13] judge
[1:00:14] it I know I could say now to very
[1:00:17] sincere people and sincere hearted
[1:00:19] people at one of the Beauties in being
[1:00:20] able to minister the word of God to
[1:00:21] Believers is that if you preach the word
[1:00:23] of God they're going to believe it and
[1:00:25] you don't have to change it to suit the
[1:00:26] makeb believer CU if I change the word
[1:00:29] to suit the make believer he's going to
[1:00:30] make believe
[1:00:31] it and the unbeliever is going to not
[1:00:34] believe it but then I can cause a
[1:00:36] question in the believer's heart to be
[1:00:38] like well that that seems a little bit
[1:00:41] different and they're going to want to
[1:00:42] believe it with everything that's in
[1:00:44] them and so I could say right now you
[1:00:46] know what we've come up with the dress
[1:00:48] code this is what we expect and this is
[1:00:50] what we require I as the pastor of this
[1:00:52] church and sick and tired of you guys
[1:00:54] being on video and looking like a bunch
[1:00:55] of harlots and this is what we're going
[1:00:57] to start
[1:00:58] doing and you know what many of you
[1:01:02] would just do it as under the Lord out
[1:01:04] the goodness of your heart because it
[1:01:06] was told to you that's the way that it
[1:01:08] ought to
[1:01:09] be but no glory is given to the Lord and
[1:01:12] there's been no
[1:01:15] Victory so you've got to examine
[1:01:17] yourselves men and women yourselves
[1:01:19] husbands and wives together saying I
[1:01:21] don't want to be guilty of wearing
[1:01:23] things and dressing things and buying
[1:01:25] things for my children for my wife or
[1:01:26] putting things on or glorifying things
[1:01:29] that do not express
[1:01:32] modesty modesty is by definition this
[1:01:35] restraint by this sense of humility some
[1:01:38] propriety when somebody is
[1:01:42] modest uh rarely do you say of somebody
[1:01:46] who actually is very very
[1:01:49] handsome uh or you rarely do you say of
[1:01:51] somebody who's really ugly that they're
[1:01:53] modest right you say that about somebody
[1:01:55] who's really really good looking and
[1:01:56] said well they're very modest about it
[1:01:57] right they have no idea that they're so
[1:01:58] good-look if somebody was like that
[1:02:00] they're shy and
[1:02:03] ugly come on somebody right that's
[1:02:06] exactly what we would
[1:02:08] say but there's modesty this humility
[1:02:11] there's this moderate self-regard
[1:02:13] there's some people who are ugly who
[1:02:15] could really use a sense of
[1:02:17] modesty but some people think they're
[1:02:20] they're they're they're the thing and
[1:02:22] they'll dress and act in a way to be
[1:02:24] like don't I look goodness like cover
[1:02:26] yourself
[1:02:28] up there must be a moderate view of
[1:02:32] yourself you're not attention seeking
[1:02:34] you're not saying oh look at me look
[1:02:36] what I'm going to
[1:02:37] wear I and and I think this goes for men
[1:02:40] and women it goes for all of us
[1:02:43] sometimes my biggest decision on a
[1:02:44] Sunday morning is the Tie I wear because
[1:02:46] I'm like did I already wear
[1:02:49] that and I'm worried that somebody might
[1:02:51] be offended it's like he wore that twice
[1:02:53] this month and it's March second right
[1:02:57] you're afraid of that you're you think
[1:02:58] about
[1:02:59] it but maybe there needs to be this
[1:03:01] moderate self-regard there a less
[1:03:04] opinion of ourselves CS Lewis said
[1:03:06] perfect humility dispenses with
[1:03:09] modesty I thought that was wonderful and
[1:03:11] that it it sets aside personal
[1:03:14] Pride because you're taking in
[1:03:15] consideration other
[1:03:17] people this is exactly what it says in
[1:03:20] Thessalonians this exactly what the
[1:03:21] scripture is saying that I want to
[1:03:23] conduct myself in a certain regard out
[1:03:25] of respect for my brother I want to
[1:03:27] conduct myself in a certain regard out
[1:03:28] of respect for my brother's wife I want
[1:03:30] to act and behave in a manner whether it
[1:03:32] be through my conversation or a
[1:03:33] familiarity or the way that I might uh
[1:03:36] uh uh present myself in a way that is
[1:03:38] respectful I want to have this this
[1:03:41] modesty of spirit and even a perfect
[1:03:43] humility that's going Beyond pretense
[1:03:45] and I'm genuinely concerned about other
[1:03:47] people amen
[1:04:09] all right I'm gonna stop here musicians
[1:04:11] if you'd come we've got a lot more to
[1:04:13] get to later but I feel that we should
[1:04:17] just press pause
[1:04:19] here and I don't know how I'm going to
[1:04:21] get back into this on a Wednesday maybe
[1:04:23] next Sunday we could just just just spin
[1:04:26] it right back
[1:04:29] up but there is an attire there is a
[1:04:33] way that men and women can
[1:04:37] dress that displeases the
[1:04:41] Lord search the
[1:04:48] scriptures I know
[1:04:52] that when I was I was born into the
[1:04:55] message I was raised in it the things
[1:04:57] that I heard the things that I was
[1:04:59] taught maybe the things I could witness
[1:05:01] with my own
[1:05:03] eyes sometimes you look back and you see
[1:05:05] pictures and you see maybe Believers in
[1:05:07] the 60s dressed a certain way and we we
[1:05:10] we can be a Gass at the fact that their
[1:05:14] dress doesn't look like these are solid
[1:05:16] Believers this is maybe a wife of a
[1:05:17] prophet and these are real solid
[1:05:19] Believers and you think oh my goodness I
[1:05:21] would never dress like that
[1:05:23] now and in some ways it's because we
[1:05:25] came up with a
[1:05:27] rule to determine what was modest merely
[1:05:32] by the fact that skirts were
[1:05:35] long or whether or not it had a split or
[1:05:37] whether or not the the shape of the
[1:05:40] sleeves and there's a lot of ways that
[1:05:42] we kind of we we maybe it was our own
[1:05:44] desire as sheep to have some specific
[1:05:46] requirements that we knew we could meet
[1:05:48] the mark and we're pleasing the Lord and
[1:05:50] so it was really good maybe just to
[1:05:52] borrow a lot from UPC and and maybe
[1:05:54] borrow a lot from this and borrow lot
[1:05:55] from that and and we want to just give
[1:05:57] me structure give me the just tell me
[1:05:59] what to do and I'll do
[1:06:01] it and that leads itself to a lot of
[1:06:04] manipulation and abuse because if you
[1:06:05] kind of go outside that you can be
[1:06:06] ostracized you can be called a lot of
[1:06:08] different
[1:06:09] things and I believe that there's a
[1:06:11] standard in the word of God a standard
[1:06:12] in the message of the hour that relates
[1:06:14] to things that are very precise and very
[1:06:17] specific but if I could say this there's
[1:06:19] one thing you don't want to look
[1:06:21] like and that's the
[1:06:24] world and now I could be maybe more
[1:06:26] precise there's one thing that you don't
[1:06:27] want to do is to wear the
[1:06:30] attire of a woman that is not in
[1:06:33] subjection to God's
[1:06:35] word that there's a way that she can
[1:06:37] look a way that she could dress there's
[1:06:39] a way that men can look and dress to
[1:06:41] where we are given to change we're
[1:06:43] rebellious against the word of God we
[1:06:45] will dress in a way that mixes things
[1:06:48] and signals
[1:06:49] things and I found that when I inquired
[1:06:52] one time of why is sister so and so
[1:06:53] wearing this and this picture and this
[1:06:55] is just what I was told from a source or
[1:06:57] two that in that era in the 60s what was
[1:07:01] very common was for hippies to wear the
[1:07:05] really really long skirts and look a
[1:07:06] certain
[1:07:07] way and as that had become adopted and
[1:07:10] was very fashionable for a certain
[1:07:12] worldly movement there was even a desire
[1:07:15] amongst believing Christians to not be
[1:07:18] confused as a
[1:07:20] hippie and therefore the dress that they
[1:07:22] would wear that would be very modest and
[1:07:24] it would be a a a and it would be below
[1:07:26] the knee and it would cover themselves
[1:07:28] and it wouldn't look like the long
[1:07:29] flowing skirts maybe of more of a 80s or
[1:07:32] 90s look that we embraced as message
[1:07:34] Believers but it was modest it was
[1:07:36] acceptable but they were trying to avoid
[1:07:39] the world at all
[1:07:41] cost they did not want to be confused
[1:07:44] with the
[1:07:46] world and I believe today that when the
[1:07:48] world is going one way we as Believers
[1:07:50] ought to go the opposite way not because
[1:07:52] we're Android or we're inhuman or we're
[1:07:54] from Mars but because we have a
[1:07:56] citizenship that's from another kingdom
[1:07:58] and that we want to be living Our Lives
[1:08:00] now in a way that glorifies the kingdom
[1:08:02] of God and therefore we have to ask
[1:08:04] ourselves some very hard questions
[1:08:07] Brothers do these pants these lowrise
[1:08:09] skinny jeans give glory to God ask
[1:08:12] yourself the question you can come to me
[1:08:15] and try to use me like a magic eightball
[1:08:17] where's my brother here who called me
[1:08:19] that the other day just as a joke you
[1:08:20] could try to try to use it use me as
[1:08:23] that but all I could do is sit down with
[1:08:24] you and talk through it
[1:08:28] because you've got to follow God who's
[1:08:30] given you the Holy Spirit despise not
[1:08:34] man but you you're not despising man
[1:08:37] you're despising the Commandment of God
[1:08:41] who has given you the Holy Spirit to
[1:08:44] navigate these
[1:08:46] things I haven't even gotten halfway
[1:08:48] through this I don't think or maybe
[1:08:50] right around halfway through jack am I
[1:08:52] halfway through he always asked me to
[1:08:54] print out a copy of my notes for him
[1:08:56] so don't ever let anyone steal him now
[1:08:57] he he's got my notes the rest of the
[1:08:59] sermon is in his
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:04] hands God who's given you the Holy
[1:09:08] Spirit if I can say it this way that
[1:09:10] even if you've been
[1:09:11] ruined he can restore
[1:09:15] you there's times in in in just through
[1:09:19] life or great paintings become damaged
[1:09:22] and destroyed anybody ever see the meme
[1:09:25] of the Church in Italy somewhere where
[1:09:26] the face of Christ was destroyed and
[1:09:28] some local woman just took it upon
[1:09:30] herself to touch it up and paint it
[1:09:32] again and it looked like a second
[1:09:33] graders art
[1:09:35] project well that's what would happen if
[1:09:37] we saw that we had marred the image of
[1:09:39] God and we wanted just to make ourselves
[1:09:40] up we would end up looking like Adam and
[1:09:42] the woman not doing a very good job but
[1:09:45] God's the one that made you and if
[1:09:48] you've been ruined he can restore you
[1:09:52] perfectly and that's who he want working
[1:09:55] in our lives as a God who could bring us
[1:09:57] back to principles of
[1:09:59] modesty amen God bless you let's
[1:10:02] stand we're just going to say a prayer
[1:10:04] and then dismiss you I know that we have
[1:10:06] lunch and things to get to I do
[1:10:08] encourage those who are able to come
[1:10:09] back for communion and feet
[1:10:12] washing uh this afternoon at 4:00 we're
[1:10:15] just going to try to go right into uh
[1:10:17] communion then feet washing these are uh
[1:10:20] it's a serious thing that we do together
[1:10:23] and we just want to honor it today
[1:10:26] let's bow our heads in a word of
[1:10:27] prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[1:10:31] as we stopped halfway into a thought I'm
[1:10:33] asking personally for your grace to give
[1:10:35] me a rest and peace to know that we've
[1:10:38] obeyed
[1:10:39] you that your
[1:10:41] word was sufficient today to cause deep
[1:10:46] reflection to
[1:10:48] consider consider the way that we're
[1:10:50] living and the way that we're dressing
[1:10:51] and the way that we're acting Lord I
[1:10:54] just feel this Liberty being with
[1:10:56] family and our home church and just our
[1:10:59] home people being with us and dear
[1:11:01] friends brother Andre Lord and his
[1:11:03] family that we could just have this
[1:11:05] Liberty to speak plainly about these
[1:11:08] things from scripture because they are
[1:11:10] incredibly
[1:11:12] crucially critically
[1:11:15] important in this day and age where the
[1:11:17] world has gone to such bare
[1:11:20] nakedness we could lull ourselves to
[1:11:22] sleep thinking that we have covered
[1:11:24] ourselves up only to learn later that we
[1:11:26] have discovered
[1:11:28] ourselves that through dress and
[1:11:31] conduct we were not pleasing you but
[1:11:34] actually signaling to the world we're
[1:11:35] with
[1:11:36] [Music]
[1:11:38] you Lord make us
[1:11:40] Billboards make us candles Lord a city
[1:11:45] set on a
[1:11:47] hill yes may we be thousands and
[1:11:50] hundreds even here in the valley of
[1:11:52] lived voices
[1:11:55] and become zigzags of
[1:11:58] lightning in a dark L de seean age let
[1:12:02] our light shine Lord Lord I pray for all
[1:12:05] present today I realize that we address
[1:12:07] a a vast
[1:12:09] audience of varying experiences and
[1:12:13] pasts but I trust Lord that we have the
[1:12:16] same
[1:12:17] goal no matter what our past is no
[1:12:19] matter what our present is we have the
[1:12:21] same goal to arrive at that place where
[1:12:23] we please you to perhaps come to that
[1:12:26] place of perfect humility where we
[1:12:27] dispense with modesty we dispense with
[1:12:29] pretense and we begin to moderate our
[1:12:32] Behavior we begin to act in moderation
[1:12:34] because we love
[1:12:36] others and Lord as the Bible says that
[1:12:39] we would rescue others from the fire
[1:12:42] hating that
[1:12:44] garment even hating the Garment spotted
[1:12:47] by the flesh Lord we want to have this
[1:12:50] kind of love for others that we would be
[1:12:52] willing to sanctify our appearance
[1:12:57] for the good of
[1:13:02] others for the good of others
[1:13:05] Lord maybe we could risk being perceived
[1:13:07] as oldfashioned maybe we could risk
[1:13:09] being perceived as homely maybe we could
[1:13:11] be risked as Perce being perceived as
[1:13:13] out of touch with
[1:13:15] fashion if it
[1:13:18] could
[1:13:20] become a revealer of your character
[1:13:26] and not a revealer of our nakedness I
[1:13:28] ask all this in the name of the Lord
[1:13:30] Jesus
[1:13:31] Christ amen amen
