[0:00] as we continue in kind of the theme of
[0:03] the house of the Lord and drawing from
[0:04] the different types and shadows uh from
[0:07] the Tabernacle and the temple and how
[0:09] that extends to us as individuals the
[0:11] New Testament Tabernacle the New
[0:13] Testament Body of Christ or Temple of
[0:15] the Lord and how that that comes down to
[0:18] us being uh part of that as well as
[0:21] individuals as extension of our families
[0:23] and even our church my title today is
[0:25] where his name
[0:28] dwells where his name dwells I'm drawing
[0:30] it from there in verse um 11 primarily
[0:34] and I put this title slide together this
[0:37] particular slide together uh at the
[0:39] outset just to create kind of a word
[0:41] picture so that you could have this in
[0:44] your mind where the scripture is where
[0:46] his name dwells as we're drawing that
[0:48] title that's our title but then this
[0:49] caricature of modern day Christianity
[0:53] where there's a billboard in front of a
[0:54] house that says Jesus and so it's it's
[0:57] signaling something it's identifying
[0:59] something and I'd like to even though I
[1:00] may not hold this theme throughout as
[1:03] far as using these words but this
[1:04] character versus character and how that
[1:07] there's certain things that uh are just
[1:10] characters or just message theaters I
[1:12] like to use that phrase it's things that
[1:14] just try to put off pretense or heirs
[1:17] and it's no more than just a billboard
[1:18] with the name on it trying to signify
[1:20] something or sell something versus where
[1:23] his name dwells and what that would mean
[1:25] and that means character and so we're
[1:28] revisiting um some recurring
[1:30] themes and um and going back over many
[1:34] things that we're already very very
[1:35] familiar with and some subjects that
[1:37] we've already covered but I just feel
[1:39] this it's this particular subject of
[1:42] character so important to visit now if
[1:44] you look at verse 11 where we just read
[1:46] I'd like to start with this because this
[1:48] will help describe uh where his name
[1:50] dwells versus the billboard with the
[1:53] name Jesus on it it says in verse 11
[1:56] then there shall be a place which the
[1:58] Lord your God shall choose to cause his
[2:00] name to dwell there thither shall you
[2:03] bring all that I command you your burnt
[2:05] offerings and your sacrifices your
[2:07] tithes and the heave offering of your
[2:09] hand and all your choice vows which you
[2:11] vow unto the Lord this is where we get
[2:13] that phrase where his name dwells and
[2:16] the phrasing uh is very direct the place
[2:19] that God chooses to cause his name to
[2:21] dwell so it's very deliberate in the
[2:24] phrasing that the Lord your God shall
[2:26] choose a place where his name will dwell
[2:30] that dwell means to settle or to reside
[2:32] it's to become fixed in so it's where
[2:34] God would be it's where his name would
[2:36] be called upon so his name would be
[2:38] invoked he would be praised he would be
[2:40] worshiped so when he says where I will
[2:42] cause my name to dwell it's where God is
[2:45] that being where God is it's where you
[2:47] call upon the Lord being where God is
[2:49] that's where you would worship and you
[2:50] would bring your burnt offerings your
[2:52] sacrifices your tithe your heave
[2:54] offering of your hand all your vows you
[2:56] would bring before the Lord in this
[2:58] place this Tabernacle
[3:00] which became a Temple and so it is
[3:02] called by his name because it is his
[3:05] dwelling and that's use of the phrase
[3:07] his name we're kind of getting into what
[3:09] an idea of a name is but it's called by
[3:11] his name because it's his house it's
[3:13] where he dwells this is the house of the
[3:16] Lord so it would carry his name or it
[3:19] would be called by his name so his name
[3:21] is attached to it be in his house and it
[3:23] be in his house it must have certain
[3:26] prerequisites and certain
[3:27] characteristics so if you look at verse
[3:29] one one it says these are the statutes
[3:31] and judgments which you shall observe to
[3:33] do in the land which the Lord God of thy
[3:35] fathers giveth thee to possess it all
[3:38] the days that you live upon the Earth ye
[3:40] shall utterly destroy all the places
[3:43] wherein the Nations which you shall
[3:45] possess serve their gods upon the high
[3:47] mountains and upon the hills and under
[3:49] every Green Tree and you shall overthrow
[3:52] their altars and break their pillars and
[3:54] burn their Groves with fire you shall
[3:56] heue down the graven images of their
[3:58] gods and destroy the names of them out
[4:01] of that place so the name is associated
[4:04] with something there it it evokes
[4:06] something it embodies something so
[4:08] there's to be a removal destroy the name
[4:11] from that place destroy all its elements
[4:13] all its forms of worship and he says ye
[4:16] shall not do so unto the Lord your God
[4:18] now he's connecting these forms of
[4:21] worship to how they're to Worship the
[4:22] Lord but unto the place which the Lord
[4:25] your God shall choose out of all your
[4:27] tribes to put his name there even even
[4:29] unto his habitation shall you seek and
[4:32] thither shalt Thou come and thither ye
[4:35] shall bring your burnt offerings and
[4:36] your sacrifices and your tithes and
[4:38] heave offerings of your hand and your
[4:39] vows and your free will offerings and
[4:41] the firstlings of your herds and of your
[4:43] flocks and there ye shall eat before the
[4:45] Lord your God and you shall rejoice in
[4:47] all that you put your hand unto ye and
[4:50] your households wherein the Lord thy God
[4:52] hath blessed thee I'm looking at this as
[4:55] characteristics and prerequisites in
[4:57] that all other places of worship were to
[4:59] be destroyed
[5:00] anything that had a form of idolatry was
[5:02] to be removed anything that was from a
[5:06] prior way of worship or tradition alone
[5:08] was to be cast down and he says you
[5:11] shall not do so unto the Lord your God
[5:13] in other words you could not blend the
[5:15] worship of these heathens you could not
[5:17] blend the worship of these other nations
[5:20] in with the worship of their God if
[5:22] there was a Grove that was planted if
[5:24] there was an altar a and and trees that
[5:27] were used for worship and for a temple
[5:28] and for sacrifice CH he was saying you
[5:31] can't just go into this country and then
[5:33] begin to worship the one true God using
[5:36] all the instruments and locations and
[5:38] all the traditions of false worship
[5:40] thinking oh if we just invoke his name
[5:42] even though we've changed some uh we
[5:44] haven't changed much we just use the new
[5:46] name that that'll satisfy he says you
[5:48] can't do this to your lord God you
[5:51] couldn't mix other forms of worship you
[5:53] couldn't bring in other ideas as it says
[5:56] in verse 8 ye shall not do after all the
[5:58] things that we do he this day every man
[6:01] whatsoever is right in his own eyes for
[6:04] you are not yet has yet come to rest and
[6:06] to The Inheritance which the Lord your
[6:08] God giveth you the ways of Egypt and the
[6:11] ways of the Wilderness wouldn't work in
[6:13] the promised land how that God even had
[6:15] to deal with them in Egypt and how God
[6:17] had to deal with them in in the
[6:18] wilderness those ways would not work in
[6:21] the promised land and he says you can't
[6:23] do what you're doing now where every
[6:25] man's ways are right in his own eyes
[6:28] whether it be his forms of work worship
[6:29] as forms of dedication and sacrifice it
[6:32] this would this could not be carried
[6:34] over into the promised land even
[6:36] acknowledging right now in the
[6:38] wilderness things are a little bit
[6:39] different but once you cross over into
[6:41] your rest once you're into the land of
[6:43] promise you can't take what you've left
[6:46] with you and you can't try to simulate
[6:48] what was just what was there and you got
[6:51] dispossessed into your worship we take
[6:54] from this as brother bradam does in the
[6:56] sermons he preaches on this subject
[6:58] there was only one place that the shik
[7:01] glory would dwell there's only one place
[7:04] that God would make home and the Bible
[7:07] is telling us it's not just a place
[7:08] where God would be but it's also
[7:10] inviting us to come and it's a place
[7:12] where we would eat not in the holy of
[7:14] holies but in the outer Court a place of
[7:16] eating for all those that would bring
[7:17] their vows and their sacrifices a place
[7:19] of rejoicing there would be Fellowship
[7:22] there would be forgiveness there would
[7:23] be praise worship giving you could see
[7:26] by all these things that are expressed
[7:27] that it it wasn't just oh there's where
[7:29] God dwells high on a hill but it'd be
[7:31] place that others would gather to and
[7:33] they would be able to give they would be
[7:34] able to serve they'd be able to eat
[7:36] they'd be able to rejoice and worship in
[7:38] verse 12 it says and ye shall rejoice
[7:40] before the Lord your God ye and your
[7:42] sons and your daughters and your
[7:44] menservants and your maid servants and
[7:46] the levite that is within your gates for
[7:48] as much as he ha no part nor inheritance
[7:50] with you this is a place of rejoicing a
[7:53] place that the families were to gather
[7:54] together the tribes all uh shared things
[7:57] in common though they would have
[7:58] different position s in different places
[8:00] and different callings this is one place
[8:02] where they could all assimilate and
[8:04] worship God
[8:05] together now if you look at verse
[8:09] five it says but under the place which
[8:11] the Lord your God shall choose out of
[8:14] all your tribes to put his name there
[8:16] even unto his habitation it says shall
[8:18] you seek and thither shalt thou Thou
[8:20] shalt come so it's a place that you must
[8:22] seek not the Groves not the altars not
[8:24] the guards not the high places not the
[8:26] things of the past not going out to the
[8:28] Wilderness not going back to Egypt but
[8:30] this place that God shall choose out of
[8:32] your tribes to put his name there now
[8:34] there's some mystery to this by him
[8:37] alluding to the fact that I will choose
[8:38] but as to where we don't know as to
[8:40] which tribe it's not yet detailed here
[8:43] but it's a place that we should seek and
[8:45] it's the place that we would come it's
[8:47] this place this is where he would place
[8:50] his Tabernacle in other words this is
[8:52] where he would uh take up residence it
[8:55] was where he would cause his glory to
[8:56] dwell as the the root of these words
[8:58] speak of the kind the Tabernacle it's
[9:01] where his glory would dwell but he
[9:03] chooses this phrasing twice in here this
[9:07] place to put his name or to cause his
[9:10] name to dwell there this is an
[9:13] appalation as a Mark or as something as
[9:16] a memorial of identification so a name
[9:19] is a mark of identification or a
[9:21] memorial of identification so this name
[9:23] has an identity or it's to identify
[9:26] something and it is a place in the the
[9:29] root of this word uh that's used the
[9:32] Shem as it speaks it's a place that you
[9:34] would find God's honor his authority and
[9:37] his character this is what's thought of
[9:39] in the shim in the name it's a place it
[9:41] it speaks of one's honor their Authority
[9:43] and their character so when God says I'm
[9:46] going to cause my name to dwell there we
[9:49] can't just simply think of a mark this
[9:51] isn't a trademark we can't think of it
[9:53] as just a symbol but yet it speaks it
[9:56] symbolizes and identifies God and
[9:59] identifying God it identifies whatever
[10:01] his characteristics are his honor his
[10:03] authority and his
[10:05] character in the New Testament the Greek
[10:07] word anoma is a word is used of name and
[10:11] its roots are in knowledge and
[10:13] understanding so a name has the ability
[10:16] or ought to carry with it convey some
[10:20] understanding and convey some knowledge
[10:22] as there's some languages whose words
[10:24] are very descriptive and in the name
[10:26] itself it describes to you the thing or
[10:29] the person the same should be said of a
[10:31] name where that when you say it it gives
[10:34] understanding it gives
[10:35] knowledge the name is used for
[10:38] everything which the name covers so
[10:41] think of how important a name would be
[10:43] because you'd use a name and you just
[10:45] wouldn't want to you not just saying hey
[10:47] bud or hey dude it's not just so much to
[10:50] get someone's attention but if you used
[10:52] a name that name ought to carry some
[10:54] weight with it or have something behind
[10:57] it to where you knew by the name that
[11:00] this land dwells to this family or that
[11:02] we're of the this tribe or we're of this
[11:05] identification and it would it would
[11:07] carry history it would carry present
[11:09] possessions so everything the name
[11:12] covers everything that comes to mind or
[11:15] how you feel when the name is mentioned
[11:17] or when you hear the
[11:19] name it's everything that would come to
[11:21] mind in how you would feel when you say
[11:23] the
[11:24] name it's everything that would come to
[11:26] mind and how you'd feel when you hear
[11:27] the name that's what's behind the name
[11:30] the name of the Old Testament would
[11:31] speak of Honor Authority character and
[11:33] identification in the New Testament it
[11:35] would speak of
[11:37] one's position their Authority their
[11:39] possessions their interest their
[11:41] Pleasures H uh their their how excellent
[11:44] they were their all these different the
[11:45] things that they've done their
[11:47] personality this would be bundled up in
[11:49] the
[11:50] name and we know from the message that
[11:53] the name invokes a person's
[11:56] character that a name characterizes a
[11:58] person
[12:00] it characterize the nature of a person's
[12:02] life I know that this it might
[12:07] seem
[12:09] uh I I don't know if sometimes we back
[12:11] into it but there's something to a name
[12:14] and we're taught that brother Bry talks
[12:15] about be careful what you name your
[12:17] children because there's something
[12:19] there's something to a name and that's
[12:21] what I'm want you to think about not so
[12:23] much how that a name would take on
[12:25] meaning but how the name has meaning
[12:28] that would God says I'll cause my name
[12:30] to dwell there that we should be
[12:32] thinking deeper than just a
[12:34] mark thinking deeper than just um this
[12:38] the arrangement of syllables with the
[12:39] prefix or suffix and we should be
[12:41] thinking more than just phonics when we
[12:44] think of a
[12:45] name but it evokes a person's character
[12:48] and the nature of a person's life a
[12:51] person's name is their reputation that's
[12:54] right a person's name is their testimony
[12:57] that's right if I if I could say this
[12:59] way the name is the
[13:02] logos that that the the reputation and
[13:05] test are the logos that the name is
[13:08] carrying so you say you say you could
[13:10] give a name but the real understanding
[13:13] of that name is in the reputation the
[13:15] testimony the character the honor the
[13:17] authority there is a logos to the name
[13:20] there's something understood by there's
[13:21] something meant and intended by it and
[13:24] that's what God is saying he says I will
[13:25] cause my name to dwell there in 2
[13:28] Chronicles
[13:30] 6:33 this is just another scripture that
[13:34] describes this residence and habitation
[13:36] but then brings us to the name then hear
[13:39] thou from the heavens even from thy
[13:42] dwelling place and do according to all
[13:44] that the stranger cth to thee for that
[13:47] all the people of the earth may know thy
[13:49] name and fear thee notice how this is
[13:52] showing where God dwells and his name
[13:54] that may know and fear thee as do thy
[13:57] People Israel it may know that this
[13:59] house which I have built is called by
[14:02] thy name but words of Solomon has he's
[14:05] trying to identify that this place where
[14:07] you
[14:08] dwell it's a place where we will know
[14:11] your name where we'll fear thee and that
[14:14] all may fear you and know that this
[14:17] house is called by thy
[14:20] name that you're taking if it were that
[14:24] phrase alone the house of the Lord if
[14:27] it's not a specific name if we can't get
[14:29] more desri descriptive than that is to
[14:32] say this is where the one true God is
[14:35] this is where the real one it's a place
[14:36] that he identifies himself with it is a
[14:38] habitation of his presence these themes
[14:41] have been expressed multiple times this
[14:43] year already in this series but it says
[14:47] it's a place called by his
[14:49] name where his name
[14:54] dwells now fast forward in quite a bit
[14:56] in a study of this or even what I would
[14:59] consider to be an appropriate sermon on
[15:02] this part I'm going to skip into the
[15:04] middle of another part in John chapter
[15:07] 5: 43 Jesus says I am come in my
[15:11] father's name and you receive me not if
[15:14] another shall come in his own name him
[15:16] you sh will receive so one coming in his
[15:21] own authority his own honor his own
[15:23] character you would receive him a man
[15:26] that is looking only to himself and
[15:28] self-promotion comes on his own
[15:30] authority he's saying you'll receive him
[15:31] so this is quite the rebuke but he says
[15:33] I'm come in my father's name and he's
[15:37] not hiding anything about who his father
[15:38] was he's not talking about Joseph he's
[15:40] talking about God I come in my father's
[15:43] name I am from above you are from
[15:46] beneath I am from I am come in my
[15:50] father's name now we might think oh he
[15:52] is carrying then oh now we know what his
[15:55] dad's name was his name is his name was
[15:57] Jesus and that somehow we've now the the
[16:01] name of God's been revealed but that
[16:03] would be that wouldn't quite convey what
[16:06] Jesus is actually meaning because to
[16:08] them Joshua or Jehovah is savior is a
[16:11] name that would have been heard before
[16:14] and it wasn't so much a new name so no
[16:16] matter if someone carried that name and
[16:18] may have been a prophet or a teacher or
[16:21] a great person who might have
[16:22] forshadowed Christ or spoke of Christ he
[16:25] said now I am come in the fullness of my
[16:28] father father's name not just a mark and
[16:31] not just a memorial but a very clear
[16:34] identification of his honor his
[16:36] authority and his
[16:38] character that now when you hear the
[16:41] name Jesus you can ascribe the
[16:44] appropriate Excellence to it that now
[16:46] when you hear the name Jesus that there
[16:48] are certain thoughts and feelings that
[16:50] must be aroused to mind that when you
[16:52] speak the name Jesus there are certain
[16:54] things that should be focused on and be
[16:56] clear to you when you say it amen
[17:00] brother Bram said Jesus Christ is the
[17:02] only place that you'll ever find
[17:04] fellowship and worship to God so if we
[17:07] could draw from the Old Testament
[17:09] Tabernacle and Temple is the one place
[17:11] that God chose to place his name is the
[17:13] one place that he chose to dwell and it
[17:15] was that one place where sacrifices to
[17:17] be were to be offered it was the one
[17:19] place that three times a year the Jews
[17:21] would have to fall back to it was the
[17:23] one place that God was so adamant about
[17:25] that he actually carved out exceptions
[17:27] if it was impossible to make it there to
[17:30] sacrifice it was that
[17:33] important God put his name in Jesus
[17:36] Christ just as he was saying it about
[17:38] the temple and it was his name would
[17:41] dwell there now we have the name of the
[17:43] Lord Jesus Christ God put his name in
[17:45] Jesus Christ and it's of Greater
[17:47] significance this helps us understand
[17:49] better what this name means it we know
[17:51] it means more than just a
[17:53] nominator a mark in itself an appalation
[17:58] as Jesus says in John 17:26 I have
[18:01] declared unto them thy name and will
[18:03] declare it that the love where thou Hast
[18:06] loved me may be be may be in them and I
[18:09] in them I have declared unto them Thy
[18:14] Name Jesus did not go around uh Judea
[18:18] with a a great reveal as there's genda
[18:21] reveals are really popular these days
[18:22] and make great viral videos Jesus wasn't
[18:25] just uh doing a name reveal over and
[18:27] over again and say is everybody ready to
[18:29] know the name of God and then he pulls
[18:32] back the curtain everybody's
[18:33] like he's saying that I have declared
[18:36] thy name and it wasn't saiding I'm going
[18:38] to let you in on a secret I'm a
[18:40] junior and I have his name and my name
[18:43] is Jesus and his name is Jesus that that
[18:46] would have been that misses the mark
[18:49] what Jesus means he says I have declared
[18:51] unto them thy name I have made known the
[18:53] name of God in that I have represented
[18:56] to you accurately his nature amen that I
[18:59] have revealed to you perfectly his
[19:02] character that in my teaching and in my
[19:04] acting and in my speaking I am
[19:06] demonstrating to you and revealing to
[19:09] you the perfect will of God for those
[19:12] things I speak my father has spoken
[19:14] those things I do my father has shown me
[19:17] therefore when I have declared unto you
[19:19] the name of God or the name of my father
[19:22] I've declared unto them thy name I come
[19:24] in my father's name I have unfolded and
[19:27] manifested to to you
[19:32] God the Bible says in John 1:18 no man
[19:35] hath seen God at any time the only
[19:37] begotten son which is in the bosom of
[19:39] the father he hath declared
[19:42] him I think it's
[19:44] remarkable in that if we take
[19:47] into uh
[19:49] consideration the instances where God
[19:52] was made visible in the Old Testament if
[19:53] we could use that even when Moses said
[19:55] let me see let me see your glory and God
[19:57] hid him in a place and God passed by and
[20:00] Moses
[20:00] saw uh uh the backside of God and how
[20:04] Moses even coming face to face with the
[20:06] glory of God as it were on the mountain
[20:08] in a burning bush in these instances
[20:11] where a man beheld some representation
[20:15] or manifestation of God so this sentence
[20:19] uh we we should kind of unpack it maybe
[20:21] next year in homeschool you guys can
[20:22] diagram this it says no man hath seen
[20:25] God at any time no man completely takes
[20:28] in and knows God at a glimpse right yes
[20:32] exactly though we could argue that well
[20:34] Moses saw God but no man has seen God at
[20:37] any
[20:38] time our house is falling down did that
[20:41] just happen okay things are falling
[20:43] apart don't look
[20:45] now we're working on another
[20:50] balcony no man have seen God at any time
[20:52] you just don't see the backside of God
[20:54] and say you know him you don't just hear
[20:57] his name Jesus Jesus and say I got him
[21:00] no man has seen God at any time the only
[21:02] begotten son which is in the bosom of
[21:04] the father leaking him to the heart the
[21:06] nature and character of God he hath
[21:08] declared him it means he you have to
[21:11] take all of
[21:12] Christ the word even speaks is to unfold
[21:16] a as a
[21:17] narrative he was a source of
[21:19] understanding God he was a source of
[21:21] knowing god the knowledge of God not
[21:24] just in a glimpse oh I saw him walk on
[21:26] water oh I saw him multiply the Loaves
[21:28] and fish no that that wouldn't say
[21:31] enough it says something about him but
[21:34] he has declared him because Jesus Christ
[21:37] was the living manifestation of God who
[21:39] as he lived and as he spoke you knew
[21:42] more about
[21:43] God
[21:45] Amen his thoughts his actions his
[21:49] words made God
[21:52] clear that if you heard him speak you
[21:55] say that came from the heart of God you
[21:58] saw him react you'd say there's another
[22:00] part of God when you saw him show have
[22:02] compassion there's the compassion of God
[22:05] when he showed Mercy there's the mercy
[22:07] of God when he showed judgment that's
[22:08] the Judgment of God when he all these
[22:10] things that he did you say I'm am
[22:12] understanding better who God Is by The
[22:14] Living Word that makes God present Jesus
[22:19] Christ Jesus Christ is the Son of God to
[22:24] a Hebrew son the word Ben it speaks of
[22:26] the the word Ben it's the builder of the
[22:29] family name a son scripturally is the
[22:33] multiplication of the father that the
[22:35] son is to bring forth an image of the
[22:37] father he's to to uh multiply the the
[22:41] image the nature and the character of
[22:43] the
[22:44] father Ben and using as a prefix the son
[22:48] of like barjona and the places you would
[22:49] see the son of it's the when you're the
[22:52] son of Jonas or you're the son of this
[22:54] or the son of that you're the Builder of
[22:56] that name as the son so Jesus declared
[23:01] the father as the son he declared the
[23:04] father as the son it it's not that you
[23:06] need to figure out who God is and then
[23:09] once you know who God is you're going to
[23:10] back you can figure out who the son is
[23:12] the son tells us who the father
[23:15] is it's the only way to know him so as
[23:19] the son he manifested the father's glory
[23:21] and just as the Tabernacle and Temple
[23:23] were the place where God's glory would
[23:25] dwell now Jesus Christ is the perfect
[23:27] fulfillment of what the house of the
[23:29] Lord
[23:30] represented brother bam writes this in
[23:33] the church age book chapter 5 God who on
[23:35] occasions would manifest his presence by
[23:37] the cloud or a pillar of fire that
[23:39] struck fear in the hearts of men this
[23:42] God whose heart characteristics now
[23:45] focus on that phrase heart
[23:47] characteristics were made known only by
[23:49] revelation of words through the prophets
[23:52] so in the Old Testament you would only
[23:54] know characteristics of God's heart his
[23:56] will his attitude his Justice his
[23:58] judgment his Mercy as Revelation came to
[24:00] the prophet and the prophet spoke it and
[24:03] that would at the very minimum disclose
[24:05] to you God's attitude towards something
[24:07] at the time or what God would do at a
[24:09] later date and all of it becoming this
[24:11] Menagerie or this picture that is slowly
[24:14] developing over time as to who God is
[24:17] but he say now this God became Emmanuel
[24:21] God With Us declaring himself so the one
[24:25] that you would catch glimpses of in the
[24:27] prophet as they re received a revelation
[24:29] from God and spoke these words and his
[24:31] heart characteristics were known at
[24:33] these different glimpses he now becomes
[24:35] God With Us and it's God declaring
[24:37] himself the word declare is taken from
[24:40] the Greek root which we often interpret
[24:42] as exis which means to thoroughly
[24:44] explain and make clear this exy is of
[24:49] the of the declare Declaration this is
[24:51] me speaking it means I have thoroughly
[24:53] explained and made clear to you God he
[24:57] should not be confused he should not be
[24:59] muddled up he should not be
[25:01] misunderstood though you may not be able
[25:03] to explain it if it's Christ it's him
[25:05] it's God that's just who he is that is
[25:08] what the Living Word Jesus did he
[25:10] brought God to us for he was God he
[25:13] revealed to us he revealed God to us
[25:15] with such perfect clarity that John
[25:18] could say about him in 1 John 1 veres 1
[25:20] to3 now hear this that which was from
[25:23] the beginning which we have heard yes
[25:25] there's the
[25:26] logos that which is the a speech which
[25:29] we have seen with our eyes which we've
[25:30] looked upon and our hands have handled
[25:32] of the word of life for the life was
[25:34] manifested and we have seen it and bear
[25:36] witness and show unto you that eternal
[25:38] life which was with the father and was
[25:39] manifested unto us that which we have
[25:42] seen and heard declare we unto you that
[25:44] ye Also may have fellowship with us and
[25:47] truly our fellowship is with the father
[25:49] and with his son Jesus Christ brother BR
[25:52] writes to this when God was truly
[25:54] revealed he was manifested in the flesh
[25:57] amen
[25:58] Believers will see it not everyone will
[26:01] see it well Believers will see it and he
[26:03] says he that hath seen me quoting the
[26:05] scripture now hath seen the father am
[26:07] that's right I've been with you in Flesh
[26:09] and Blood I've been with you in eating
[26:10] and drinking and sleeping and tearing
[26:12] and traveling and he say show us the
[26:14] father and he says have I been so long
[26:15] with you that you don't know the father
[26:18] when you've seen me you've seen the
[26:20] father that doesn't mean when you saw a
[26:22] picture right you couldn't follow Jesus
[26:25] on Instagram and I know some of you
[26:27] thinking he wouldn't be on that platform
[26:28] he'd be on Snap or Tik
[26:31] Tok maybe he kept Vine he resurrected
[26:35] Vine and he you said you couldn't just
[26:38] get 60 second Snippets you couldn't just
[26:40] get 140 or 60 characters you couldn't be
[26:43] following him on X and feel like you
[26:45] really knew him just in these Snips and
[26:48] snaps but he's saying I
[26:51] am you've been I've been with you so
[26:53] long so he wasn't castigating him that
[26:56] Phillip like the first time you laid
[26:58] laid eyes on me you saw the father they
[27:01] said as I've been with you this is what
[27:03] you're supposed to know this is what I
[27:06] my purpose is as I've been with you you
[27:08] have been communing with and
[27:09] fellowshipping with the father
[27:13] amen Hebrews chap 1: 1
[27:20] to4 making such good time every place is
[27:24] available for lunch today it's it's
[27:26] going to be it's going to be perfect
[27:28] you're going to have your
[27:30] choice Hebrews chap 1: 1:4 God who at
[27:33] sunry times and in diverse manner spake
[27:35] in time passed unto the fathers by the
[27:38] prophets this is what brother bradam in
[27:40] some ways is summarizing or we could
[27:42] substantiate what brother Bram is saying
[27:44] by this that God's heart characteristics
[27:46] were made known as the prophet spoke the
[27:48] word that was given to them God spake by
[27:53] the prophets but verse two hath in these
[27:56] last days spoken to us by his son
[27:59] whom Heath appointed heir of All Things
[28:01] by whom also he made the worlds there's
[28:03] a mouthful who being the brightness of
[28:06] his glory and the express image of his
[28:09] person there's another mouthful and
[28:11] upholding All Things by the word of his
[28:13] power when he had by himself purged our
[28:17] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[28:20] Majesty on high there's a lot that goes
[28:24] into
[28:25] this a lot that you could meditate on
[28:28] God spoke by prophets who revealed in
[28:31] these uh instances heart characteristics
[28:34] of God but now he is spoken by his son
[28:37] who is the expressed image of God who
[28:40] upholds all things by the word of his
[28:41] power by himself purged our sins and now
[28:44] he's at the right hand of majesty on
[28:46] high it's telling us just trying to
[28:47] paint a picture of who Jesus Christ is
[28:50] being made so much better than the
[28:54] angels as he hath by inheritance
[28:57] attained a more excellent Name than they
[29:00] amen the Angels were created by God the
[29:03] Angels worshiped by God but these Angels
[29:06] were not Sons these angels though they
[29:08] may have brought messages to the
[29:10] prophets and brought messages from God
[29:12] as that should be looked at
[29:14] appropriately to verse one that God in
[29:16] sunry times and diverse maners spake to
[29:19] unto the fathers by the prophets that
[29:21] there were angels that brought messages
[29:23] and there was God was being revealed or
[29:26] his word was made known through these
[29:27] Messengers but now he's given him a more
[29:30] excellent Name than that of the
[29:32] Angels why Christ is where God put his
[29:36] name as I said already he was the
[29:38] manifestation of God this has
[29:40] implications today because you can only
[29:42] worship God in Christ
[29:46] today this name that is spoken of here
[29:48] as Heath by inheritance obtained a more
[29:50] excellent Name this name arises from
[29:53] Christ's
[29:54] nature he has a more excellent Name he
[29:57] has obtained a more excellent name
[29:59] because it not only arises from his
[30:01] relationship to God as son but arises
[30:03] from the nature that was expressed to
[30:05] through him as
[30:07] son he was declared to be God's son and
[30:10] that he and then so being declared to be
[30:12] God's son oh he's he's a b he's a
[30:14] builder of the father name father's name
[30:16] oh he's a son he's going to give a
[30:19] reputation and testimony of who God is
[30:22] but that can be bad
[30:25] sometimes there there's uh I can imagine
[30:28] just how often maybe our parents cringe
[30:31] when it's like oh you're a migiri right
[30:34] and immediately they begin to think
[30:35] about the meiri
[30:36] boys and they make make a name and a
[30:39] testimony and they think when well we we
[30:41] knew you're you're meari as the the
[30:44] white wizard who had been converted or
[30:45] the one that loved rubber duckies or
[30:47] whatever it is they might have some sort
[30:49] of image of portrayal of the of the
[30:52] father but then the boys begin to live
[30:53] their life and it gives the N the family
[30:55] name new
[30:56] meaning right
[30:58] I had to wait till I had family here to
[31:00] witness this to share this but you know
[31:02] what I mean that you can say oh well
[31:03] he's a mcari and somebody who knows
[31:05] different sides of the mcari family
[31:06] would' be like which one hey which which
[31:10] nature of mcari is it because there's a
[31:12] name that's associated with the nature
[31:15] so he was not just the Son of God but he
[31:17] accurately portrayed God yes so
[31:19] therefore he obtained a more excellent
[31:21] name because he
[31:23] manifested that he was the son of God by
[31:27] his life amen by his words by his
[31:29] teachings by his abstinence by where he
[31:32] went he was showing God's heart at the
[31:36] pull of Bethesda if he would have just
[31:38] healed everybody then we could say that
[31:40] was God's will but he didn't so he was
[31:43] showing us something about God's
[31:44] compassion when he went into the temple
[31:46] and turn turned over the tables he said
[31:48] you've made my house of den of Thieves
[31:50] he was speaking something about the Zeal
[31:52] of God the Zeal of my house hath eaten
[31:55] me up as the prophecy was he was knowing
[31:58] and declaring God's heart at every turn
[32:00] if I could say this when you read of
[32:02] Christ and you learn of Christ it's
[32:03] something safe to just take in all of it
[32:07] all of it and it exposes how deadly it
[32:11] is when one tries to change Christ
[32:14] either by adding to or taking away or
[32:15] preaching a Jesus that doesn't exist
[32:18] because Jesus Christ is the only way to
[32:20] know God it's the only place to worship
[32:22] God and Jesus Christ even as we look at
[32:25] him in the Book of John as these
[32:27] different ref says I've come in thy name
[32:29] Heath declared him and declared unto
[32:31] them thy name he was the perfect
[32:33] manifestation of God by words actions
[32:36] Deeds
[32:37] response restraint you name it he
[32:40] declared God's
[32:41] heart and the house of the Lord was to
[32:44] be the same thing in
[32:46] type the house of the Lord was to be the
[32:48] same thing as a shadow of Christ which
[32:50] was to come it was a place that was to
[32:53] reflect as the way the place where I
[32:55] will cause my name to dwell it was to
[32:57] reflect God's
[32:59] character and he was going to do it
[33:02] through his glory through his
[33:04] presence in Philippians chap 2:
[33:08] 99-1 it's speaking of Jesus Christ
[33:11] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[33:13] him and given him a name which is above
[33:16] every
[33:17] name we're talking about
[33:19] reputation talking about testimony to
[33:22] about honor Authority character not a
[33:26] name the Lord Jesus Christ as as a Mark
[33:30] or
[33:31] appalation think of it as there's more
[33:34] to it there's more to it than just a a
[33:38] nominator say oh he's given them a name
[33:39] which is above every name listen I think
[33:41] we have to be very
[33:43] careful maybe I could say it this way
[33:46] it's a Razor's
[33:47] Edge where there's some who use the name
[33:50] as a
[33:52] seance and they use it as as it's
[33:54] unlocking some key that no matter what's
[33:56] happened Jesus right and and even this
[34:00] colloquialism we might use I speak Jesus
[34:03] well what did you mean by that or we
[34:05] sing
[34:06] it and we're invoking a name we're
[34:08] forming the words and the phrase Jesus
[34:11] and and we think oh there's power in
[34:13] that name but do you realize in other
[34:14] tongues it doesn't even sound that
[34:16] way so we could think and this is just
[34:19] commentary on the American mindset we
[34:21] think so much so much about America that
[34:24] when there is an eclipse here the
[34:26] Rapture is happening
[34:29] right but when there's a when the the
[34:31] moon the sun is dark for 20 seconds in
[34:34] America this is a sign from God not
[34:37] knowing that it happens almost on a
[34:38] regular intervals year after year and
[34:41] before it happens here the next time
[34:43] it's going to happen dozens of times or
[34:44] a dozen times before it happens here
[34:46] again and I guess if we lived on a tiny
[34:48] island in the Pacific Ocean we'd be like
[34:51] the gods are coming right and we would
[34:53] think it to be a sign but we get so
[34:55] American Centric
[34:57] and if we're not careful we can get so
[34:59] English Centric on Jesus the
[35:03] name and we've deluded it to just a mark
[35:07] we've trademarked the name
[35:09] Jesus and we don't realize the power
[35:11] behind that name what it represents to
[35:14] where it's some something so precious
[35:16] that people can unrighteously partake in
[35:23] it God hath highly exalted him and given
[35:25] a name which is above every name that is
[35:27] that at the name of
[35:29] Jesus every knee should
[35:32] bow of things in heaven and things in
[35:35] Earth and things under the Earth at the
[35:37] name of Jesus now I'm not wanting you to
[35:39] get hung up on the pronunciation I'm not
[35:42] wanting you to get hung up on the hard J
[35:44] sound or the the smooth Su I'm not
[35:46] wanting you to so much think in terms of
[35:48] English and how you pronounce his name
[35:51] but at the name of Jesus at the
[35:54] testimony and reputation of Jesus just
[35:57] as those demons say in the name of Paul
[35:59] in the name of Jesus of Nazareth says
[36:01] Jesus we know Paul we know but what
[36:03] reputation do you have what kind of
[36:06] testimony do you have there's nothing
[36:08] that's symmetrical to what the name
[36:11] represents your name could be Jesus and
[36:14] you could be invoking the name of Jesus
[36:16] Christ and that doesn't create the
[36:18] Symmetry but it's the character it's the
[36:21] life it's the honor it's the authority
[36:24] it's the power at that name every knee
[36:27] should bow
[36:29] of things in Heaven and Earth and under
[36:30] the Earth that every tongue should
[36:32] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[36:35] glory of God the Father you got to get
[36:38] that right where the glory is going to
[36:40] ultimately because at the name of Jesus
[36:42] he's highly exalted him and given him a
[36:44] name and he's obtained by inheritance a
[36:46] more excellent name so what wasn't he
[36:49] given that name well he's a builder of
[36:51] the
[36:53] name Christ had never come we could
[36:55] still be living today waiting for the
[36:57] Messiah and having people today named
[36:59] Jesus and
[37:01] Joshua and false
[37:03] christs but it's Christ who now shows us
[37:06] who God
[37:16] is believe it or not I'm at a stopping
[37:20] point Proverbs Chapter 2 ver 22 verse1
[37:29] a good name is rather to be chosen than
[37:31] great
[37:33] riches God in bu in speaking of a
[37:36] tabernacle and a temple it is a place
[37:38] where I will cause my name to
[37:41] dwell if we were told with absolute
[37:45] Authority that there was only one God
[37:46] and that he dwelt somewhere then that
[37:48] would give us reverence for that place
[37:51] us believing in a one true God he said I
[37:53] will cause my name to dwell there that
[37:55] speaks something to us this is a
[37:56] precious place this this is a sacred
[37:58] place this is a a place of
[38:00] purpose and this is now speaking
[38:02] generally to a name a good name is
[38:04] rather to be chosen than great riches
[38:06] this is the followup to a a Mortage home
[38:11] and a and the home being for sale how a
[38:14] home can be sold how we can be housed we
[38:17] could be homeless and the whole idea of
[38:19] as we begin to get into some things
[38:20] about finances and money in the URS of
[38:23] Le DEA says a good name is better and
[38:27] it's rather to be chosen if you were
[38:29] given the choice of a good name or
[38:31] riches don't none of you lie at some
[38:33] point in your life you would have chose
[38:34] riches right and now having read this
[38:37] scripture you're all going to say oh no
[38:38] good name brother Aaron a good
[38:42] name and those of us who maybe don't
[38:45] like our names and we've changed them or
[38:46] whatever we'd say I know exactly what
[38:48] I'm thinking about too but a good name
[38:50] is rather be chosen than great riches
[38:52] and loving favor rather than silver and
[38:55] gold now these phrases taken together
[38:58] mean more than the time I'm going to
[38:59] give them now but this good name it
[39:00] comes by doing
[39:02] well a good name is better a good name
[39:05] is rather to be chosen you should choose
[39:06] a good name over riches and it doesn't
[39:09] mean that you start looking through H uh
[39:11] baby name books and you start looking at
[39:13] meanings and you start trying to run the
[39:15] uh uh the Hebrew and the English and all
[39:17] the different meanings to try to come up
[39:19] with a really really good name and and
[39:22] I've come up with this name and this is
[39:23] what it means that that's not what is
[39:25] meant it meant it means a reputation a
[39:28] good
[39:28] reputation when a company is sold a and
[39:32] there's and there's Assets in that
[39:33] company you can affix you can assess
[39:36] what those things are if they have
[39:38] printers if they have machines and they
[39:39] have laths they have all different sorts
[39:41] of physical tangible assets you can get
[39:43] them appraised and it has some value but
[39:45] then the company that's existed has
[39:47] what's called Goodwill and it's the
[39:50] reputation it it it means this speaks to
[39:53] the intangibles about this business and
[39:55] what it's worth not merely because it
[39:57] has property or assets but because it's
[40:00] established itself and has done business
[40:02] for so long that the name of the company
[40:05] has
[40:07] value sometimes even more than the
[40:09] assets themselves some people could have
[40:12] customer list and want to sell their
[40:14] customer and sometimes the people just
[40:15] want the customer list because they
[40:17] don't want the
[40:18] name because it's a bad name other times
[40:21] people could say keep your customers I
[40:22] just want the name because it's a good
[40:25] name good name comes by doing well it
[40:28] means a man's
[40:30] reputation if you can think of it this
[40:31] way your good name is what goes before
[40:33] you when you get
[40:35] there and this is saying character is
[40:38] better than
[40:39] riches a good name a testimony a good
[40:42] testimony is better than riches and
[40:44] loving favor rather than silver and gold
[40:46] in other words this
[40:48] respect this Integrity loving favor is
[40:52] better than silver and gold testimony
[40:54] now if you could for
[40:56] me do the this is you need to do this
[41:00] work make this
[41:02] practical and what this looks like in
[41:04] your individual lives and what you're
[41:05] trying to Aspire acquire or aspire to be
[41:08] and what you lift up in your families
[41:10] and what we Aspire and try to do as a
[41:12] church a good name is better to be
[41:14] chosen than great riches and loving
[41:16] favor than gold silver and gold
[41:18] character is better than riches why it's
[41:21] a stronger Foundation
[41:23] right but it's harder to acquire
[41:28] the scripture is saying it's easier to
[41:30] get riches than it is to get character
[41:33] it's easier to get silver and gold than
[41:34] it is loving favor but character is more
[41:38] useful than money character lasts longer
[41:41] than
[41:43] money and the loss of character is worse
[41:47] than losing
[41:48] money take this to Heart we're talking
[41:51] about character versus character ch
[41:53] right that the the loss of character is
[41:57] more harmful than the loss of money is
[42:00] job lost everything and maintained his
[42:03] integrity at the in the end he lost
[42:05] nothing the Bible says in Ecclesiastes a
[42:08] good name is better than precious
[42:16] ointment in Proverbs
[42:20] 13:22 this is a scripture worth focusing
[42:23] on a good man leaveth an inheritance to
[42:26] his children
[42:28] children and the wealth of the Sinners
[42:30] laid up for the just in other words the
[42:33] the a sinner's wealth ultimately ends up
[42:35] in the hands of a better
[42:37] man that it's always
[42:39] tenous that a wicked man generally gains
[42:43] even his income
[42:46] dishonestly uh the cheating The Cutting
[42:48] Corners the looking out after himself
[42:49] even if he's not necessarily a thief he
[42:51] doesn't have the kind of character where
[42:53] you can guarantee that he's always had
[42:55] the right motive and objective
[42:57] and so it implies that a sinner's wealth
[42:59] even though he may have worked for It
[43:01] ultimately it'll end up in the hands of
[43:03] a just man or a better
[43:05] man and this phrase a good man leaves an
[43:09] inheritance to his children's
[43:11] children the Bible tells us in Ephesians
[43:14] to be dear followers of God as or be
[43:17] followers of God as dear children so I
[43:20] say this to express this that a good man
[43:23] leaves an inheritance not to his
[43:25] children alone but to the children of
[43:27] his children it would be his
[43:29] grandchildren and it is the nature of a
[43:31] child to follow his parents so he says
[43:33] he says follow God as dear children
[43:37] children inherit I don't mean to scare
[43:39] anybody here today but children inherit
[43:41] the nature of their parents and every
[43:43] child here child here should
[43:46] go that explains
[43:49] everything they inherit the nature of
[43:52] the
[43:52] parents and without any effort they
[43:55] imitate us yes without any forethought
[43:59] beforehand they mimic and they express
[44:02] and they show
[44:03] things cuz by Nature they have by birth
[44:08] they have the nature of the
[44:09] parents and so by Nature they will
[44:12] follow in mimic their father or
[44:14] mother so Paul says follow God as dear
[44:18] children but now if we could think of it
[44:20] in a natural sense as a good man leaves
[44:22] an inheritance for his
[44:24] grandchildren the nurture of a parent
[44:28] not just the nature but the manner in
[44:29] which a parent raises that child the way
[44:32] that he interacts with him and the
[44:34] example that he gives will either
[44:35] promote the worst of our nature or point
[44:38] to something
[44:42] better and as this scripture says a good
[44:45] man leaves an inheritance to his
[44:46] children's
[44:49] children if I can say this the impact of
[44:52] a man's
[44:54] example and his habits
[44:58] influences
[45:00] children and therefore their
[45:03] children if I have given my son Preston
[45:07] my
[45:09] nature and Elliott's going right it's
[45:11] off the hook today if I've given Preston
[45:14] my nature and then he only gets my base
[45:18] nurture I probably will promote the
[45:21] worst of who I
[45:23] am and if that just runs its course when
[45:27] he has children here in a few
[45:30] years when he begins to have children
[45:33] guess what his children will be
[45:36] influenced by
[45:39] me this is what the Bible is telling
[45:42] us the habits that a child learns from
[45:45] his father are the foundation of that
[45:47] child's
[45:48] character I know you're all thinking
[45:50] when did this sermon start like when you
[45:54] said it was a good stopping point maybe
[45:55] it was actually a good stopping
[46:00] point but the habits that a child learns
[46:04] from his father anybody remember the the
[46:07] commercial from the 80s that when a
[46:08] father is standing over his child at the
[46:10] bed and and he's chat he's holding a
[46:13] like a cigar box of drug paraphernalia
[46:16] and the father's like said Son where did
[46:18] you get this and the son says to his
[46:22] daddy I learned it by watching you okay
[46:26] I learned it by watching you and the
[46:27] dad's just
[46:29] like like what could he say
[46:33] then the habits that our children
[46:37] learn become the foundations of their
[46:40] character so it says a good man leaves
[46:43] an inheritance not a curse he leaves
[46:46] something valuable a treasure a good
[46:48] man's inheritance then survives the Next
[46:51] Generation and passes to the third if I
[46:54] could phrase it this way a man of
[46:56] character
[46:58] a man who is just not a character of the
[47:00] message but a man who has character of
[47:03] the word a man wherein the name of God
[47:07] dwells and it's not just pretense a man
[47:10] of character leaves something that can
[47:12] benefit multiple Generations brother
[47:15] brandom writes in the church age book
[47:16] you'd better come before it's too late
[47:18] sayith the Lord and buy of me gold tried
[47:21] in the fire and then you will be truly
[47:23] rich brother B I'm taking this great
[47:26] urge to to the Le de seean Church Age
[47:28] come and buy of me gold tried in the
[47:30] fire white rment that you would be
[47:32] clothed and eyes have that you may see
[47:34] he saying this is God saying do it now
[47:36] before it's too late you're deluded
[47:38] you're deceived you're caught up in
[47:39] yourself you need your eyes to be opened
[47:43] then you'll be truly
[47:45] Rich truly Rich why because there is a
[47:49] good name that is better than riches
[47:50] there's loving favor that's better than
[47:52] silver and gold there's a good a good
[47:54] man leaves an inheritance an example to
[47:57] his
[48:00] grandchildren he says are we getting it
[48:03] that's his
[48:04] question listen to me naked physically
[48:07] we came into the world but naked
[48:09] spiritually we will not leave it that's
[48:12] a turn of
[48:13] events oh no we're going to take
[48:16] something with us what that something is
[48:19] is all we can take with us nothing less
[48:23] and nothing more so we better be real
[48:25] careful now to see what we take that we
[48:28] take something that'll make us right
[48:30] before
[48:31] God so then what we will take with
[48:34] us well I guess if I was trying to be
[48:38] politically correct I would write the
[48:40] blood of Jesus
[48:42] Christ
[48:45] right well let's just think about it if
[48:48] we want to be right before God we want
[48:50] to bring his
[48:52] righteousness that there are certain
[48:54] things you think oh if I want to be
[48:55] right with God this is what I need to
[48:57] bring but he takes it in this level and
[48:59] he looks at it in a little bit different
[49:01] way which to me is the product of these
[49:05] other things it's not apart from the
[49:07] blood it's not apart from his
[49:09] righteousness but it's the effect of the
[49:11] blood it's the effect of his
[49:13] righteousness it's the good habits of
[49:15] Jesus Christ it is the character of God
[49:18] that has produced this we will take our
[49:21] character that is what we will take with
[49:23] us now what kind of character will you
[49:26] take with with you wow will it be Disney
[49:29] Looney Tunes will you will it be like
[49:33] his whose character was molded by
[49:35] suffering in the fiery furnace of
[49:36] Affliction or will it and jot this
[49:39] phrase down will it be the softness of
[49:41] This characterless leod Dean people
[49:45] where the great burden of this age is
[49:46] soft living and nervous tension and
[49:49] riches the softness of this
[49:52] characterless Leo Dean people so soft
[49:56] sof and
[49:57] malleable so scalable in Spectrum on the
[50:01] spectrum that we can choose whatever we
[50:04] want to be there's nothing hard nothing
[50:07] rigid nothing sure soft characterless
[50:11] genderless L de seeing people then he
[50:14] says it is up to each one of us for in
[50:17] that day every man will bear his own
[50:20] burden I've said it this way before and
[50:22] I'll impress it upon us now as it says a
[50:25] good man leaves an inherit for his
[50:28] grandchildren if there's an inheritance
[50:30] that can be enjoyed by grandchildren
[50:31] it's also Jo enjoyed by the children
[50:34] it's not that a good man knows how to
[50:36] write his will where it skips his
[50:38] children and goes straight to the
[50:39] grandchildren if you want to know how to
[50:40] do that I can help you but that's not
[50:42] what's being implied in this
[50:44] instance saying that the children can
[50:47] enjoy it and there's always leftovers
[50:49] for the grandchildren the grandchildren
[50:51] aren't looking at this estate saying wow
[50:53] Grandpa's worth how many millions of
[50:55] dollars and when he he dies that goes to
[50:58] oh wait my Aunts Uncles and my dad uh or
[51:02] my mom am I going to get any of it when
[51:05] it's those
[51:06] things it may not survive even to go to
[51:09] the children there's gifts that lapse
[51:12] all the time because a person will write
[51:14] a will and say to my daughter I give my
[51:16] million dollars in my Bank of America my
[51:18] wacovia bank
[51:20] account cuz they watch over your money
[51:24] and it's in my watch over your bank
[51:25] account and then that bank gets assumed
[51:27] by some other bank and then it gets
[51:28] transferred to another bank and when it
[51:30] gives time to give that million dollars
[51:32] to the daughter the gift fails because
[51:34] it was so
[51:35] specific that it's no longer
[51:38] there but this is something that cannot
[51:41] fail this type of character and so if a
[51:45] man leaves
[51:47] something then we take our character and
[51:50] what you leave is your
[51:52] legacy what you leave your character has
[51:54] left an imprint your character has left
[51:57] a testimony you take your character with
[51:59] you but there's a reputation that
[52:01] remains and if we think of character as
[52:04] a victory something that can only be
[52:06] molded by suffering in a fiery furnace
[52:08] of Affliction it's something you fight
[52:09] for something you labor for something
[52:11] that you earn something that in
[52:13] conquering you receive that tells me
[52:15] something remarkable that I take my
[52:17] character with me but then what am I
[52:20] leaving because I can't leave my
[52:23] character to my sons or daughter I can't
[52:25] leave my character to my grandchildren
[52:28] because character is not a
[52:30] gift it's not received nor
[52:34] inherited but there is something I can
[52:38] leave and I'm tying all this to the
[52:40] phrase where brother B said in speaking
[52:41] the difference between a house and a
[52:43] home he said it's the character of the
[52:44] inside that makes a home Character
[52:47] Matters brother bman the time tested
[52:49] Memorials of God says a man's character
[52:51] is made known by his works whatever you
[52:54] are your Works prove what you are right
[52:56] you say well I I'm a I'm a plumber and
[53:02] your whole life you build brick
[53:04] walls right you say well I'm GNA I'm
[53:08] going to say you're a Mason just you
[53:10] know forgive me for a moment here and
[53:11] I'm just going to say you're a brick
[53:12] layer no I'm a plumber licensed
[53:14] certified got the degree name on the
[53:17] truck you know Aaron's
[53:19] plumbing and all you do is got mortar
[53:21] and bricks in your the back of the van
[53:23] right you say well I'm just going to say
[53:25] no matter what you call yourself
[53:27] sir plumber sir if you want to be called
[53:30] a plumber you're a plumber but the
[53:32] bricks tell me you're a brick
[53:33] layer CU a man is known by his
[53:36] works whatever you your your Works prove
[53:39] what you are no matter how much you
[53:41] testify whatever you say Pro or con that
[53:45] has nothing to do with it I'm this I'm
[53:48] that I I I I I what you do is what
[53:52] counts your Works tell what you are
[53:55] tells what you are
[53:58] inside every job that you do manifest
[54:01] what you
[54:02] are you businessman if you just do a
[54:05] patched up job see what I mean just a
[54:07] halfway job don't do that if you can't
[54:09] do it right just don't do it don't do it
[54:10] at all why because your work testifies
[54:14] of your
[54:15] character you may call yourself a
[54:18] plumber you may have a plumber's
[54:20] license but your your awesome brick
[54:22] walls testify that you're an awesome
[54:24] brick layer your Works testify of your
[54:28] character and it's our works it's the
[54:30] way that we live that's building our
[54:35] character our works then build the
[54:37] character of our
[54:40] house that if you could think of it this
[54:42] way if you take your character with you
[54:45] there's something to be said about what
[54:47] you take with you even when you're not
[54:49] present whether it be by death or by
[54:52] work when you leave the home you want
[54:54] something that's holding the home
[54:55] together yes that's more than just your
[54:58] iron fist or your intimidating
[55:01] presence so that the garage door opener
[55:03] immediately triggers you know a panic
[55:06] attack in the children and the mom at
[55:08] home but there is a
[55:12] character that is left in the
[55:15] home it's our testimony that influences
[55:17] how others view us and even view our
[55:22] house as I said before maybe this is
[55:25] just a Nuance we'll have to kind of
[55:27] break down a little bit more in the
[55:28] future if you take your character with
[55:30] you you can't give character to your
[55:32] children as a gift but your character
[55:35] matters because your Works build your
[55:39] character therefore the works that are
[55:42] seen
[55:44] build the works that are seen Pro or con
[55:47] Better or Worse your Works determine
[55:49] your character so I want to know what
[55:50] I'm building because if that's building
[55:52] my character my Works become my example
[55:55] my works and my Deeds my words my
[55:58] choices how I spend my time what I say
[56:00] how I react all those different things
[56:02] will show and be something I will leave
[56:05] my Works to my children I will leave a
[56:08] legacy the imprint I leave in the home
[56:10] the atmosphere I create I may take my
[56:13] character when I go but I leave the
[56:15] atmosphere I've
[56:17] created my Character
[56:19] Matters I couldn't get away from this
[56:22] scripture because it just seemed to
[56:25] speak of so much Proverbs
[56:27] 10:22 the blessing of the Lord it maketh
[56:32] Rich you want wealth come to me what
[56:35] before it's too late you'll truly be
[56:37] rich be blessed of God His
[56:41] blessings where he causes his name to
[56:43] dwell his will that's what really makes
[56:46] us rich to be rich in His blessings does
[56:49] not imply to be rich in this world we'll
[56:51] touch on this maybe later kind of this
[56:53] becomes a very good segue into what I
[56:55] was studying last week the blessing of
[56:57] the Lord makes rich and he addeth no
[56:59] sorrow with it the Bible teaches us that
[57:02] with the wealth of this world there
[57:04] comes sorrow that when man have been
[57:06] greedy for gain and the love of money is
[57:08] the root of all evil that there are
[57:09] certain things that we can acquire with
[57:11] the world and and Solomon noted that
[57:13] when we get that it's vanity and when
[57:15] you get that sorrow comes with it but
[57:17] God is saying there's an addition
[57:19] there's a
[57:20] blessing there is a benefit that there's
[57:23] no sorrow added to it
[57:26] am there's a there's a wealth and a rich
[57:29] that God gives the blessing of the Lord
[57:31] it makes rich I will not mortgage my
[57:33] home my home is not for sale there is
[57:36] things in this world I do not want but
[57:38] there's blessings from God that have no
[57:40] sorrow with it and that's what makes me
[57:43] Rich
[57:45] amen that's what makes my house a
[57:49] mansion that's what makes everything I
[57:51] own and everything I pursue a
[57:54] blessing because it's
[57:57] makes it wealth because it's a blessing
[58:00] from
[58:01] God I have two more scriptures scripture
[58:04] readings to
[58:07] read this one will just sum up where his
[58:11] name
[58:13] dwells in Colossians 3: 12-1 17 it says
[58:17] put on therefore as the elect of God
[58:20] holy and beloved vows of Mercy kindness
[58:24] humbleness of mind meekness
[58:27] longsuffering forbearing one another and
[58:30] forgiving one
[58:32] another as the elect of God put
[58:37] on as those who are the place where he
[58:41] puts his name amen as those that are the
[58:45] Bears of his presence these are the
[58:47] things then that must be made
[58:50] available if you are the his Dwelling
[58:53] Place if you are a tabernacle of the
[58:56] Holy Spirit then these are the things
[58:58] that must be there Mercy kindness
[59:00] humbleness of Mind meekness
[59:01] longsuffering forbearing one another
[59:04] forgiving one
[59:06] another these are all things that were
[59:08] available in the
[59:10] Tabernacle these are all the things that
[59:12] were in the temple and these are all the
[59:14] things that Christ
[59:16] manifested because it continues that we
[59:18] forgive If any man have a quarrel
[59:19] against any even as Christ forgave you
[59:23] so also do ye so Christ for fores
[59:26] therefore we should forgive and above
[59:27] all these things put on charity which is
[59:30] the bond of
[59:32] perfectness and let the peace of God
[59:34] rule in your hearts to the which also
[59:36] you are called in one body and be ye
[59:40] thankful let the word of Christ dwell in
[59:43] you richly in all wisdom teaching and
[59:47] admonishing one another in Psalms and
[59:49] hymns and spiritual songs singing with
[59:51] Grace and your hearts to the Lord these
[59:54] were images of the Temple these were
[59:56] images of the Tabernacle these are
[59:59] things now that he's saying if the word
[1:00:00] of Christ dwells in you richly then let
[1:00:03] it be in wisdom teaching and
[1:00:05] admonishment there's singing There's
[1:00:07] rejoicing there's
[1:00:09] feasting and I believe it's written this
[1:00:12] way so as to just tie it all up so that
[1:00:15] you don't miss the point that he's
[1:00:16] making as the elect of God put on Mercy
[1:00:20] kindness humbleness of Mind meekness
[1:00:22] longsuffering patience forgiveness
[1:00:24] wisdom teaching admonishment singing
[1:00:28] Grace so he's just like okay I could
[1:00:30] keep going on forever whatsoever you do
[1:00:34] in word or deed do all in the name of
[1:00:39] the Lord
[1:00:40] Jesus that doesn't mean when I wake up
[1:00:42] in the morning I go and I start grabbing
[1:00:44] eggs in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:45] Christ scrambled eggs in the name of the
[1:00:48] Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to add a
[1:00:49] little heavy whipping cream and it's
[1:00:51] that's not it at
[1:00:53] all it it's not just a crutch for
[1:00:57] where whatever I do in the name of the
[1:00:58] Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to do it it
[1:01:00] means in his character in his nature
[1:01:03] with his honor in mind if I can't do it
[1:01:07] in a way that will honor him I don't
[1:01:09] want to do it if I do it in a way that
[1:01:11] confuses it confuses the true nature and
[1:01:14] spirit of God I don't want to do it that
[1:01:16] even goes so far as to sometimes the
[1:01:18] hard decision we have to make is to do
[1:01:20] the thing that's the most offensive to
[1:01:22] some but the most in harmony with the
[1:01:24] character and nature of God yes yes sir
[1:01:27] do all in the name of the Lord Jesus in
[1:01:32] his
[1:01:33] character whatsoever you do in word or
[1:01:36] deed do it in his character whether it
[1:01:38] be the meekness of Christ the
[1:01:41] moderation let the word of Christ dwell
[1:01:43] in you
[1:01:44] richly let it
[1:01:46] manifest if you are where his name
[1:01:49] dwells do all in the name of the Lord
[1:01:54] Jesus is this character this is the
[1:01:56] challenge this is my clothes this is the
[1:01:58] ask as a Salesman don't you have to
[1:02:00] clothes with an ask or something I don't
[1:02:02] know how it works i''d be a horrible
[1:02:04] salesman because I can hardly return
[1:02:06] food that I'm paying for that's not
[1:02:08] cooked right let alone knock on
[1:02:10] someone's door and try to sell them
[1:02:11] something they don't want I didn't know
[1:02:13] if you maybe wanted this okay never mind
[1:02:14] I know you right if I had to do cold
[1:02:19] calling for a living we wouldn't be
[1:02:21] making a
[1:02:23] living and I admire people that do it
[1:02:26] but is this character
[1:02:29] available in your
[1:02:33] life what type of inheritance then are
[1:02:35] we building for our children and
[1:02:39] grandchildren the temple was built as
[1:02:41] the place where his name would dwell
[1:02:43] that regardless of the individuals that
[1:02:46] frequented it that fellowshipped that
[1:02:49] praised that
[1:02:50] rejoiced that ate that offered that
[1:02:53] vowed that served that no matter who who
[1:02:55] it was levite or all the other tribes
[1:02:58] that God's presence would dwell there
[1:03:00] for subsequent generation after
[1:03:02] generation after generation and the
[1:03:04] experience would always be the same
[1:03:06] because God's word had
[1:03:09] preeminence and therefore in type what
[1:03:12] are we what kind of Tabernacle will our
[1:03:16] children
[1:03:18] inherit if we want to think about your
[1:03:20] own lives well they're going to have to
[1:03:21] do something with your body and all your
[1:03:22] junk that you accumulate through
[1:03:24] throughout your life if you die and
[1:03:26] they'll have to deal with that but I'm
[1:03:27] thinking about what kind of family name
[1:03:29] are we building what kind of home will
[1:03:32] we leave them we're not worried about
[1:03:33] square footage and the right kind of zip
[1:03:34] code we're talking about the blessings
[1:03:36] of the Lord that make Rich we're talking
[1:03:39] the example of the father that forms the
[1:03:41] foundation of his son's character what
[1:03:44] type of building are we what kind of
[1:03:47] inheritance are we building not only for
[1:03:49] our children but our
[1:03:51] grandchildren as Paul is instructing us
[1:03:53] to be as the elect of God to have bows
[1:03:55] of Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind
[1:03:57] meekness longsuffering forbearing one
[1:03:58] another forgiving one another he uses
[1:04:00] the phrase even as
[1:04:02] Christ therefore I would say in all
[1:04:05] these things do all in the Name of
[1:04:06] Christ it means do it even as Christ we
[1:04:09] must be
[1:04:11] Christ we must be where his name
[1:04:16] dwells and not a t-shirt that says
[1:04:20] Jesus not the right pictures in our home
[1:04:23] alone not the right kind of bum bumper
[1:04:27] sticker I I I'm I'm not I'm not so much
[1:04:30] worried about the pretense and the
[1:04:32] Optics or the character of Christianity
[1:04:34] I want the character of it even if it's
[1:04:38] not necessarily wrapped in a physical
[1:04:40] way that people would say I want that
[1:04:43] but if the name's there if it's salty
[1:04:46] people get
[1:04:48] thirsty there's a brand of
[1:04:51] Christianity that is just
[1:04:53] stoking the hatred right of those that
[1:04:57] deny
[1:04:59] Christ because it's so in congruent with
[1:05:02] the nature of Christ
[1:05:04] right it's so muddled that it will never
[1:05:07] speak to one who's
[1:05:09] anti someone who's anti is just going to
[1:05:12] flip to another
[1:05:13] anti-side but if someone's caught up in
[1:05:15] the the caricature of
[1:05:17] Christ if they get uh whether be jaded
[1:05:21] or they become hurt or uh you know kind
[1:05:24] of confused with their movement
[1:05:27] they they'll just flip to the other
[1:05:29] side and say I I don't even believe I'm
[1:05:32] anti this I'm anti
[1:05:34] that there's got to be Christ in there
[1:05:37] somewhere that's calling to the
[1:05:41] hungry I was trying to find where I
[1:05:43] originally read this phrase I couldn't
[1:05:45] remember if it CS Lewis and I had it in
[1:05:48] some of the notes I a research I was
[1:05:50] doing at one time I think I even used it
[1:05:51] in a sermon here a few years ago and
[1:05:54] this writer remarked I I've never gotten
[1:05:56] anyone's attention by talking about the
[1:05:59] word unless of course they were looking
[1:06:01] for an
[1:06:03] argument no matter what you say Pro or
[1:06:07] con he said but when I just live the
[1:06:10] word I'm amazed how the people that need
[1:06:12] it the most pick up on it
[1:06:15] immediately when I just live it the
[1:06:18] living is the character of it a life
[1:06:21] lived by the word would be the word
[1:06:23] expressed Jesus Christ was the word of
[1:06:26] God expressed he was the very heart
[1:06:28] characteristics of God and it wasn't
[1:06:30] known merely through his words but it
[1:06:32] was the totality of
[1:06:35] life where his name
[1:06:38] dwelled there the word was
[1:06:42] living now I'm going to read I'll invite
[1:06:44] our musicians to come and I'm going to
[1:06:46] read a
[1:06:48] parable that piggy backs off of Christ
[1:06:51] teaching about wealth and a faithful
[1:06:52] Steward and those that have and have not
[1:06:55] and
[1:06:56] but in Luke chapter 16: 19 we'll just
[1:06:59] read to verse 23 there was a certain
[1:07:01] rich man I'm using this to as a p
[1:07:03] painting a picture at the end there was
[1:07:05] a certain rich man which was clothed in
[1:07:07] purple and fine linen and fared
[1:07:09] sumptuously every day there's one
[1:07:12] picture and there was a certain beggar
[1:07:14] named Lazarus which was laid at his gate
[1:07:16] full of sores and Desiring to be fed
[1:07:19] with the crumbs which fell from the rich
[1:07:21] man's table moreover the dogs came and
[1:07:23] licked his sores there's two different
[1:07:26] Instagram
[1:07:27] posts a man who is Rich dressed in
[1:07:30] purple and fine linen who fares eats
[1:07:32] well has a house with the gate he's a
[1:07:37] rich man and the other guy is at certain
[1:07:40] beggar named
[1:07:41] Lazarus and he has laid at a gate he's
[1:07:44] full of sores and just to paint the
[1:07:46] picture of the pity dogs are licking his
[1:07:49] sores and he would be happy to have the
[1:07:50] crumbs that came from the rich man's
[1:07:52] table to drastic different
[1:07:56] pictures and Jesus cuts to the
[1:07:59] end and it came to pass that the beggar
[1:08:03] died and it says the rich man also
[1:08:07] died but he says it came to pass that
[1:08:09] the beggar died and was carried by the
[1:08:12] Angels into Abraham's
[1:08:13] bosom this is a that was a symbolic of
[1:08:17] paradise the rich man also died and was
[1:08:20] simply
[1:08:23] buried though we could argue well did
[1:08:25] the Angels carry his physical body into
[1:08:27] Abraham's bosom they this is the end of
[1:08:31] that man the rich man who fared
[1:08:32] sumptuously every day all his fair
[1:08:34] living and all his wealth and all his
[1:08:36] riches he ended up in a grave just like
[1:08:41] Lazarus but it says the
[1:08:44] beggar he had something that could be
[1:08:47] taken and so that person who he was was
[1:08:50] carried into Abraham's bosom into the
[1:08:53] presence of God by angels
[1:08:57] and in verse 23 and in Hell the rich man
[1:08:59] lifted up his eyes being in
[1:09:01] torment and seeing Abraham a far off and
[1:09:05] Lazarus in his
[1:09:07] bosom in life the rich man had it
[1:09:11] made in life Lazarus not so much but
[1:09:15] which one would you rather
[1:09:17] be which one are you
[1:09:20] today and I would argue that many of us
[1:09:24] right now in this present life cannot
[1:09:26] identify with
[1:09:28] Lazarus therefore it would be more
[1:09:30] appropriate for us to identify with the
[1:09:33] rich man and so the question I ask is
[1:09:36] what are you doing with the beggar at
[1:09:37] your
[1:09:39] gate the question I ask is what kind of
[1:09:42] inheritance are you leaving what kind of
[1:09:44] life are you living brother Brandon in
[1:09:48] the sermon time tested Memorials of God
[1:09:49] he said them memorials is gone he's
[1:09:51] talking about all the great conquerors
[1:09:52] and heroes and Caesar and all the ones
[1:09:54] that have gone before
[1:09:56] My Brother David was shared with me his
[1:09:57] experience in being in Israel and
[1:09:59] walking along streets and seeing tops of
[1:10:02] houses entrance into houses that were
[1:10:04] just now barely peing above street level
[1:10:07] because things just get built built up
[1:10:08] on top all the great memorials to man
[1:10:12] how many surviv today and live today he
[1:10:15] says they're all gone but that Living
[1:10:17] Word of God Still Remains just the same
[1:10:20] and just as
[1:10:22] valuable that's a memorial remember
[1:10:25] remember a name is a Mark or a memorial
[1:10:27] of identification he said that's a
[1:10:29] memorial so I say today brother the
[1:10:32] things that you
[1:10:33] do the words that you say now I'm
[1:10:36] quoting brother Brandon and if I don't
[1:10:38] have it on the slide it's maybe just to
[1:10:39] test whether or not you trust me the the
[1:10:42] the things that you do the words that
[1:10:43] you say how you treat your
[1:10:46] neighbor and what you do about Christ
[1:10:49] will be an everlasting Memorial how you
[1:10:52] treat your neighbor
[1:10:56] how you treat your
[1:10:58] neighbor an everlasting Memorial you
[1:11:01] might have a fine home to leave your
[1:11:03] children you might be working for some
[1:11:05] livelihood to leave your children but
[1:11:08] I'd rather leave them the word of God
[1:11:10] than anything else those houses will
[1:11:13] vanish that's perfectly all right that's
[1:11:15] good I have nothing against it but don't
[1:11:17] do those minor things and leave the
[1:11:19] great things undone we work and strive
[1:11:22] to have the Investments we work and
[1:11:23] strive to have a savings that we can
[1:11:25] live on and enough maybe to leave our
[1:11:26] children and we're constantly
[1:11:28] calculating how we're going to pay for
[1:11:30] college and what we're going to leave he
[1:11:32] says it's all leave them houses and have
[1:11:34] a livelihood where you can set your
[1:11:36] grandchildren up that's all fine but I'd
[1:11:38] rather that's minor he says leave them
[1:11:41] the great things is to leave the word
[1:11:43] because the word will the house will
[1:11:45] perish and the people will perish with
[1:11:47] it but the word will raise them up in
[1:11:49] the last days and give them Eternal and
[1:11:52] Immortal Life again he says and now in
[1:11:54] order to make an estate like this WOW an
[1:11:58] estate what you leave when you die you
[1:12:01] what you own is called your estate and
[1:12:03] there's an executive of your estate or
[1:12:05] there's one that has a trust care over
[1:12:07] your estate to divvy it up and to pass
[1:12:09] it along and he's saying there is then a
[1:12:11] care an estate like this he said God's
[1:12:15] Eternal Word and if you take your
[1:12:17] character but what you built what you
[1:12:20] honored what you pointed to was the word
[1:12:22] that will impact for Generations
[1:12:25] he said I think of this old song we used
[1:12:27] to sing here years ago time is filled
[1:12:28] with swift transition not of Earth
[1:12:30] unmoved shall stand build your hopes on
[1:12:32] things Eternal hold to God's unchanging
[1:12:35] hand when our journey is completed to
[1:12:37] God we've been true fair and bright our
[1:12:39] home and Glory our un raptured Soul
[1:12:41] shall view how much better it is to look
[1:12:44] out in the face of the setting sun when
[1:12:45] your veins are cooling in your body and
[1:12:46] your children standing around the bed to
[1:12:48] know that you got a Memorial built like
[1:12:50] that honey someday daddy will meet you
[1:12:52] on the other side I'd rather have that
[1:12:55] when the doctor says Billy there's
[1:12:56] nothing more can be done for you I see
[1:12:58] my kitties and I kiss them goodbye I say
[1:13:01] but daddy's not dying he's going to a
[1:13:03] rest to a place for this Earthly
[1:13:05] Tabernacle be dissolved I have one
[1:13:07] already waiting he says what a memorial
[1:13:09] to speak out of I'd rather to do that in
[1:13:13] the face of my children than to say
[1:13:15] honey I've got a million dollars in this
[1:13:16] bank and a million over here in this one
[1:13:18] for
[1:13:19] you he said I'd rather be able to face
[1:13:22] them with if that's all you had than to
[1:13:24] say well I've got a million dollars here
[1:13:26] son I got a million dollars here
[1:13:27] daughter I'd rather leave that
[1:13:30] testimony and then he quotes with
[1:13:32] partings leave behind us footprints on
[1:13:34] the sands of time footprints that
[1:13:37] perhaps another sailing over life solag
[1:13:39] for a forlorn and Shipwrecked brother
[1:13:41] seen shall take heart
[1:13:44] again we may take our character but
[1:13:46] you're leaving
[1:13:48] footsteps footprints in the sands of
[1:13:50] time so he summarized it absolutely
[1:13:53] leave them for a memorial
[1:13:55] your testimony
[1:13:59] am leave for
[1:14:01] him a
[1:14:04] memorial your testimony that's what the
[1:14:07] Tabernacle was the Tabernacle of witness
[1:14:11] the Tabernacle of testimony that's what
[1:14:13] the whole house of the Lord was to be
[1:14:16] and that's what you are today is where
[1:14:20] his name dwells and where his name
[1:14:21] dwells we have to have character to
[1:14:24] accurately portray pray him and not just
[1:14:25] be a character we don't want just houses
[1:14:28] with clean Lawns and everything
[1:14:30] manicured and the pretense of Jesus and
[1:14:32] a billboard so to speak even as a church
[1:14:35] it's not the pretex it's the life it's
[1:14:37] the character behind the name that's
[1:14:41] what we want to have where his name
[1:14:43] dwells God bless you today we're done
[1:14:46] you can stand with us
