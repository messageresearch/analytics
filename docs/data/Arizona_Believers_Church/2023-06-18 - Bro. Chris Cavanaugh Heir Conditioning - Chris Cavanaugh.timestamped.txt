[0:00] and it says this in the word and you
[0:02] hath he quickened who were dead in
[0:04] trespasses and sins wherein time past ye
[0:06] walked according to the course of this
[0:08] world according to the prince of the
[0:11] power of the air the spirit thou now
[0:13] worketh and the children of disobedience
[0:16] so let's just bow our heads for a word
[0:17] of Prayer
[0:19] Heavenly Father were a privileged people
[0:21] this morning
[0:22] father because you're present Lord and
[0:25] you've made your presence known even
[0:27] when we're yet sinners father God you
[0:28] you cared for us you loved us you
[0:31] manifested your plan to us Lord you
[0:34] brought us in Lord and also brought us
[0:36] out and father we're just so thankful
[0:38] for it today and so we just ask your
[0:39] blessings upon the people upon the
[0:41] speaker and the hearers god that
[0:43] whatever would come forth that it would
[0:45] be according to your will and your plan
[0:46] that we would speak words of eternal
[0:48] life to your children Lord that they
[0:51] would be received as such and Lord have
[0:53] an effect on us because father if
[0:55] there's no practical application to what
[0:57] it is then it's just Hollow singing and
[1:00] Hollow shouting in its Hollow preaching
[1:03] but if there's something that we can
[1:04] apply to our lives and just draw a
[1:06] little closer to you that's what we want
[1:07] to do today so we just commit this now
[1:09] into your hands we're asking in Jesus
[1:11] name God bless you you can have your
[1:12] seats
[1:26] so if I take a lot of drinks this
[1:28] morning please forgive me
[1:30] for whatever reason I I don't know if
[1:33] it's just because I'm preaching today
[1:34] that you wake up and your mouth is as
[1:35] dry as could possibly be so I don't know
[1:37] if it's the weather or or just the fact
[1:39] that you're nervous so it could be it
[1:41] could be a little both uh I'm not really
[1:44] sure but uh we just want to take a
[1:49] subject today and just before we do I'm
[1:50] going to bring up a definition for you
[1:54] and
[1:55] this isn't a trick definition like the
[1:57] last one so anybody that was in previous
[1:59] services this is actually straight out
[2:01] of you know a dictionary and it says the
[2:04] control of temperature humidity Purity
[2:07] and motion of air in an enclosed space
[2:08] independent of outside conditions
[2:10] anybody have a guess
[2:16] is my mic too loud
[2:18] no okay
[2:22] no not a thermostat but it's close it
[2:25] does the thermostat does something
[2:29] the kids should know this because
[2:33] okay so we live in Arizona
[2:36] and it's hot outside today
[2:39] what is it
[2:40] no close
[2:44] thank you air conditioning
[2:47] so we're going to talk about air
[2:49] conditioning today but maybe not in the
[2:50] way that you think
[2:52] but living in the desert right we
[2:54] appreciate it
[2:55] uh if if anybody looks at this picture
[2:57] and says that's exactly how my dad looks
[2:59] sitting under the air conditioner uh
[3:01] this your dad did not model for this uh
[3:04] that was no dad in particular that is
[3:07] sitting there it's just to show that
[3:09] there's an effect that air conditioning
[3:12] has and so we're going to talk about air
[3:14] conditioning just as we move forward
[3:15] today
[3:17] and
[3:19] brother Branham had talked in the
[3:21] message the God of this evil age brother
[3:23] I don't have that on there but in the
[3:25] God of this evil age that there's
[3:27] something that's actually happening
[3:28] today that was he tied back to something
[3:31] back in Genesis the 15th chapter about
[3:32] the iniquity of the amorites and he said
[3:35] that that iniquity of the amorites
[3:37] wasn't Yet full and so we see that
[3:39] that's progressing forward today and how
[3:41] that iniquity is actually filling up and
[3:43] so we're going to start off and I know
[3:44] this is going to be a little bit of an
[3:46] odd way to probably start to to get to
[3:48] the subject that we're talking about
[3:50] but what I want to do is to contrast
[3:53] something because a lot of times and I
[3:55] don't know why it is in human nature is
[3:57] it okay if I move around or
[3:58] is that okay okay thank you I feel
[4:00] better when I move around because
[4:02] obviously I've got people in the in the
[4:04] nosebleed section over here so I want to
[4:06] make sure I address you too uh our
[4:08] balcony commonly I mean I don't know if
[4:11] six inches can give you a nosebleed but
[4:12] hopefully not
[4:13] but
[4:14] um I just want to kind of move around a
[4:16] little bit if that's okay and
[4:19] so sometimes when we see a negative for
[4:22] whatever reason people tend to focus on
[4:24] a negative and they tend to acknowledge
[4:26] a negative a lot quicker than
[4:28] acknowledge a positive in fact you can
[4:30] notice in people's lives you'll have a
[4:32] tendency to if you have a bad thing
[4:34] happen to you and a good thing happened
[4:36] to you and it happens in the same day
[4:38] what do we typically end up at the end
[4:40] of the day remembering
[4:42] it's the negative thing yeah right it's
[4:45] just it's part of human nature for
[4:46] whatever reason I don't like it
[4:48] personally but I'm there with you that's
[4:51] what we have a tendency to do
[4:53] so we understand that in this day we
[4:55] have something that's happening and so
[4:56] in the scripture in Isaiah the 60th
[4:58] chapter in the second verse and you can
[5:00] move if you want but it should come up
[5:02] here
[5:03] the word says this for Behold The
[5:05] Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross
[5:07] Darkness the people but the Lord shall
[5:08] arise upon thee and His glory shall be
[5:10] seen upon thee
[5:12] so we understand that this is the age
[5:14] that we're living and that there's a
[5:15] gross darkness and by gross that the
[5:17] scripture is talking about it's thick so
[5:20] it's something that's heavy it's
[5:22] something that you could say it's sticky
[5:23] it's something that's gonna it's just
[5:26] there like you it permeates things it's
[5:29] something that's so so heavy that it's
[5:31] covering the whole earth and we
[5:33] understand that we're seeing the effect
[5:35] of this particular Darkness taking place
[5:37] on on people all around us and we're
[5:41] living in that world we're living at
[5:42] this time when these things are
[5:43] happening so second Timothy 3 verses one
[5:46] to five
[5:49] the scripture says this this know also
[5:51] that in the last days perilous times
[5:53] shall come for men shall be lovers of
[5:55] their own selves Covetous boasters proud
[5:58] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[6:00] unthankful Unholy without natural
[6:03] affection truce Breakers false accusers
[6:06] incontinent Fierce despisers of those
[6:09] that are good
[6:12] Traders
[6:13] heady high-minded does this sound
[6:15] familiar maybe to some of us older folks
[6:18] maybe you young ones by God's grace you
[6:20] don't even know anything about this
[6:21] which is wonderful I think that's
[6:23] awesome I'm glad you're under an
[6:25] umbrella like that
[6:26] but heady high-minded lover is a
[6:28] pleasure more than lovers of God having
[6:30] a form of godliness and denying the
[6:32] power thereof and it says from such turn
[6:33] away and then in Revelations chapter 317
[6:36] it's a very familiar verse to us it says
[6:38] because thou sayest I'm rich I'm
[6:40] increased with Goods I have need of
[6:41] nothing and know us thou not that thou
[6:42] art wretched and miserable and poor and
[6:45] blind and naked
[6:47] so I just want to go over this just
[6:49] briefly when we're talking about air
[6:51] conditioning
[6:52] and
[6:54] right now we can see the effect of the
[6:57] The Prince and power of the air
[6:59] and what condition he's created
[7:02] and under that gross Darkness we see
[7:04] this Satan's Eden is is what we we
[7:07] commonly call it we see that that kind
[7:09] of Eden the negative Eden taking place
[7:12] and most of us are will look at that and
[7:15] realize yeah this is actually happening
[7:17] like hey this is I mean this is perilous
[7:20] times you know this is a time of where
[7:23] people have Fury and they're angry and
[7:25] they're fierce and and and and it can be
[7:28] scary for some people and if you live in
[7:31] certain cities the things are worse than
[7:33] they've ever been and certain movements
[7:35] have taken place and we won't name them
[7:37] because obviously this is going to be on
[7:38] the internet and people get offended and
[7:39] then you get canceled but uh and I you
[7:43] know I don't want to be canceled
[7:44] certainly that that would be horrible uh
[7:47] but people pay so much attention to
[7:49] those things that are out there in the
[7:50] social media and the different things
[7:51] that are taking place and we focus on
[7:53] those things and we notice those things
[7:55] and there's an interesting thing that I
[7:57] see in the church
[7:58] is that we can realize that the prince
[8:01] and power of the air so this this air
[8:03] conditioning is taking place the devil
[8:05] is doing things and we see that and we
[8:08] know for one thing absolutely this is
[8:11] the word of God actually coming to pass
[8:12] right so this is just what you're seeing
[8:15] is the word coming to pass
[8:17] so first thing take courage in that
[8:19] because the words coming to pass
[8:22] but here's here's the part that I want
[8:24] to notice people are really good about
[8:26] noticing man look at how strong the
[8:28] devil is look at the things he's doing
[8:30] look at how Satan's Eden is getting so
[8:32] perfected look at how all these things
[8:34] are taking place look at how bad
[8:35] everybody is look at this you know
[8:37] horrible thing taking place over there
[8:39] and we realize that wow you know Satan's
[8:42] actually doing what the Bible said that
[8:44] he was going to do
[8:45] and we focus on those things and
[8:48] politics becomes a big deal by the way
[8:49] politics is is something that the devil
[8:52] controls just in case you're wondering
[8:53] uh that's what brother Branham said he
[8:56] said that demon power religion and and
[8:58] that political thing would come together
[9:00] those things and we've seen that and I I
[9:03] will tell you from my own standpoint I
[9:05] love it when people say I'm not lying
[9:08] it's only politics because a politician
[9:10] can tell you whatever they want and they
[9:12] say oh it's just politics no it's a lie
[9:14] it's just a straight out lie but you've
[9:17] taken a word and said this doesn't
[9:19] really mean a lie it just means I'm I'm
[9:21] kind of steering you the way I want you
[9:23] want you to go and so because I'm trying
[9:25] to help you I'm not really lying to you
[9:27] I'm just using politics to fix it so we
[9:31] understand that these things are
[9:32] happening and you see in our own country
[9:33] and this isn't just here in America
[9:36] so if we would take this same thought
[9:39] and take it to anywhere in the world
[9:40] you're going to find the same exact
[9:41] thing as this negative factor that's
[9:44] happening we ascribe so much to it and
[9:47] we recognize it and we see it and what
[9:49] we're failing to recognize is the power
[9:50] of God and the children of God
[9:52] and understanding that God is actually
[9:55] conditioning us to something
[9:56] so while there's a prince and power of
[9:58] the air working and we understand that
[10:01] it's working we need to realize that at
[10:04] the same time God is doing exactly what
[10:06] he needs to do
[10:07] and the problem that we have for some of
[10:10] us is that we have what brother Brandon
[10:11] referred to as a sticky nature
[10:13] right and
[10:15] what he said was that you know we we
[10:18] have a cockleburn nature
[10:20] and I I don't know cockle Bars were
[10:22] pretty common back in Wisconsin I don't
[10:25] see him out here but we have goat heads
[10:26] I don't know if anybody ever stepped on
[10:27] a goat head but just don't really like
[10:29] them
[10:30] um I don't know what they have down in
[10:31] Phoenix but we have those up North so
[10:33] but you can pick anything that sticks to
[10:35] you like a jumping Trail kind of like
[10:37] that yeah like you can walk past those
[10:39] things and I don't know how they get on
[10:40] you but they do and then you know you
[10:43] got to get a comb or something and get
[10:44] them off that something happens right so
[10:46] those things kind of stick to you and we
[10:48] understand that we have that sticky
[10:49] nature
[10:51] but brother Bynum also said that look at
[10:53] when you get wheat life into you
[10:56] so now on the inside you've got wheat
[10:58] life
[10:59] so that seed that goes into the ground
[11:01] what it's going to do is it's going to
[11:02] bring forth wheat life and I could I
[11:04] could read this to you but I'm trying to
[11:05] save some time
[11:06] it's going to bring forth wheat life
[11:08] because that's the seed that's on the
[11:10] inside so what Christ planted in you is
[11:13] is a wheat life but at the same time
[11:16] that nature that's on the outside
[11:18] still got some little stickiness to them
[11:21] still got a little bit of issue to them
[11:23] still got some things going on that is a
[11:25] problem and so because of that sticky
[11:27] nature sometimes we fail to realize or
[11:30] fail to recognize that God is preparing
[11:31] us for something
[11:33] God is working all the time and as much
[11:36] as we can see in the negative what Satan
[11:38] is doing we could be able to see in the
[11:40] positive what the Lord is doing in our
[11:43] lives because there's a great effect
[11:45] that's taking place for everyone here
[11:46] Saints and there's something that's
[11:48] moving and something that's happening
[11:50] so uh first Peter
[12:02] the scripture says this first Peter 4
[12:05] we'll read 12 to 16 and then verse 19 it
[12:07] says beloved think it not strange the
[12:09] fiery trial which is to try you and so
[12:12] some strange thing happened unto you
[12:14] but rejoice in as much as your partakers
[12:16] of Christ's sufferings that when his
[12:17] glory should be revealed you may be glad
[12:19] also with exceeding Joy now I don't know
[12:21] about you but it's really hard to have
[12:23] exceeding Joy when you're kind of going
[12:25] through the test and trial
[12:26] but yet God does give you Joy at that
[12:29] time right he gives you peace at that
[12:31] time he he gives you the ability to
[12:34] smile you know through things that other
[12:37] people would be just overwhelmed by or
[12:38] overcome by yeah
[12:41] give you an example just driving on the
[12:42] freeway how many drive on the freeway
[12:45] right
[12:46] sometimes you can be overcome by the
[12:49] drivers that cut you off or the
[12:51] different things that happen on the
[12:52] freeway right and there are people that
[12:54] they can't even control their rage
[12:57] because we're in perilous times
[12:59] but yet we because there's something on
[13:02] the inside controlling you there's
[13:03] something on the inside conditioned you
[13:05] you're able to actually drive those
[13:07] freeways and come home and not like take
[13:10] it out on your family that the freeway
[13:12] was a horrible experience today and I
[13:14] really hated this and I didn't enjoy
[13:16] what I had to go through and this is
[13:17] really sad
[13:19] so now some of you younger ones someday
[13:21] you're going to be driving you'll
[13:21] understand this and I know you want to
[13:24] drive but for those of you that are
[13:25] driving now you have a you know you
[13:27] understand what I'm talking about
[13:29] I mean you can't even hardly go to a
[13:31] parking lot and get cut off by somebody
[13:32] and or actually maybe you're the one
[13:36] that cuts somebody off and they're ready
[13:37] to kill you
[13:39] like and and it happens right they have
[13:42] Road rages and it's people follow people
[13:44] home
[13:45] because we're in perilous times and we
[13:48] live in these perilous times so when we
[13:49] have these fiery trials that are
[13:51] assailing us when something is happening
[13:53] actually and something is taking place
[13:55] then we find out that though we can have
[13:57] exceeding joy and it says and if you be
[14:00] reproached for the name of Christ happy
[14:01] are you for the spirit of glory and of
[14:03] God resteth upon you on their parties
[14:06] evil spoken of but on your part he's
[14:07] glorified so people don't really like it
[14:10] when you don't act like they do
[14:13] right
[14:15] if if you don't get angry when somebody
[14:16] else does sometimes it makes them more
[14:18] angry
[14:19] because how are you under control and
[14:20] I'm like
[14:21] I got to do something something's got to
[14:24] happen here like let's let's go to it
[14:26] and they don't they're not able to
[14:29] really understand how you can have peace
[14:31] in a storm when they don't
[14:34] and they can't really understand or
[14:36] comprehend how it is that they're under
[14:38] an air condition they're they're in that
[14:39] gross Darkness phase and they're living
[14:41] in that and here you are it's all around
[14:44] you right
[14:45] but still you're under a different
[14:48] influence you got something else that's
[14:50] happening for you
[14:54] but let none of you suffer as a murderer
[14:56] or as a thief as an evil doer as a
[14:58] busybody in other men's matters now this
[15:00] is a whole different sermon but I just
[15:02] it strikes me in this particular verse
[15:04] that you have murderer thief evildoer
[15:07] and busybody
[15:10] so
[15:13] uh
[15:15] again this is a different sermon
[15:17] um
[15:18] but
[15:20] how impressive is it that busybody is
[15:23] thrown in with murderer thief and
[15:26] evildoer
[15:27] so the Lord must think something about
[15:30] that particular aspect of life to where
[15:33] we have to be involved in other people's
[15:34] you know business and let me tell you
[15:37] social media and if you have social
[15:39] media I'm not here to say yay or nay I
[15:42] don't personally have it but
[15:44] it is astounding to me how much people
[15:47] focus on social media kids take their
[15:49] own lives because of social media
[15:51] because of cyber bullying you know when
[15:53] when I was a kid and you made a mistake
[15:54] or in fact you didn't even have to make
[15:56] a mistake somebody just didn't like you
[15:58] uh and they would start saying bad
[16:00] things about you it was usually like a
[16:02] sphere of three four people
[16:04] now it's a sphere of three four million
[16:06] like it's it's that I children my my my
[16:11] hat is off to you to grow up in this
[16:12] world today
[16:14] because this is such a different
[16:16] atmosphere that's been created by this
[16:18] thing and it's a beast it's it's it's a
[16:21] devil and it's a demon thing that's out
[16:24] there because so many people focus on it
[16:26] and I'm going to tell you a secret right
[16:28] now there's a secret to social media
[16:30] it's called an off button
[16:33] because if you don't read the comments
[16:35] that people say about you and you stay
[16:36] away from those comments and don't
[16:38] listen to those things it doesn't have
[16:39] the same effect on you but you're being
[16:42] conditioned by the comments and as long
[16:43] as you keep reading the comments and
[16:45] keep focusing on those things then it
[16:47] keeps keeps you in that mindset and
[16:49] keeps you down that path and keeps you
[16:51] drawn into that particular thing but
[16:53] that social media watch out for it
[16:56] because it's something that is actually
[16:58] sent I believe to continue to destroy
[17:01] the fabric of of not just America but
[17:04] the world
[17:05] and that's what it's succeeding and
[17:07] doing
[17:08] you know even though social media do you
[17:09] know the social media Giants don't let
[17:11] their own children
[17:13] engage in their social media platforms
[17:16] because they set it up to control
[17:17] people's minds and they know it
[17:19] and so that's why so just just be wary
[17:21] of it I'm not telling you not to have it
[17:23] or two have it but anyway I just thought
[17:25] it was funny busybody murderer I don't
[17:27] know
[17:28] if you're a busy buddy you might want to
[17:31] think twice about that one
[17:33] uh
[17:34] verse 16 yet if any man suffer as a
[17:37] Christian let him not be ashamed but let
[17:38] him glorify God on this behalf wherefore
[17:40] Let Them Suffer according to the will of
[17:42] God commit the keeping of their souls to
[17:44] him in well-doing as unto a faithful
[17:47] creator
[17:48] so we understand that What's Happening
[17:51] Here is the Lord is talking about look
[17:53] at you're going to have things that
[17:55] happen in your life and you're going to
[17:57] have trials you're going to have tests
[17:58] you're going to have tribulation but
[18:00] these things are actually producing Joy
[18:02] though you don't really see it right now
[18:05] because there's an effect that's
[18:07] happening there's a conditioning that's
[18:08] happening and the end effect of this is
[18:11] joy
[18:11] the end effect of this is peace the end
[18:14] effect of this is love the end effect of
[18:16] this is eternity the end effect of this
[18:18] is something greater than what you're
[18:20] witnessing right now
[18:21] and you're actually being conditioned to
[18:24] do something because these things as
[18:27] they're taking place they're changing
[18:28] you and modifying you and and teaching
[18:31] you you know we could take Gideon and
[18:34] just talk about him for just a second
[18:35] you know here he is Lord sends an Angel
[18:38] and the angel comes to him and says get
[18:39] in you're a mighty man of Valor and
[18:41] Gideon's like what
[18:44] have you seen me like I'm hiding out I
[18:47] don't want anybody to notice me you know
[18:49] I've been in this way a long time and I
[18:51] I'm really afraid of these midianites I
[18:53] don't like them I'm not sure what to do
[18:55] I gotta kind of keep it on the down low
[18:57] nobody you know nobody noticed that
[19:00] Gideon's hiding out so the Lord comes
[19:02] and tells them look at you're a mighty
[19:04] man of Valor then what does he proceed
[19:05] to do
[19:06] he spends his whole time conditioning
[19:10] Gideon to believe you're a mighty man of
[19:12] Valor
[19:13] everything he does
[19:15] hey I'm going to have I'm going to put a
[19:17] fleece before you and there's going to
[19:18] be you know water on the ground but
[19:20] nothing in the on the the fleece and
[19:22] then I'm going to have the other way
[19:23] it's going to be the fleece is going to
[19:24] be soaking wet nothing on the ground and
[19:26] look at you're going to go into the camp
[19:28] of the midianites and they're gonna it
[19:29] was midianites I think that's right
[19:30] you're going to go into their camp and
[19:32] they're going to find out that uh you
[19:34] know you're going to hear that actually
[19:35] you're going to defeat them like they're
[19:37] afraid of you you're hiding out from
[19:39] them they're afraid of you so each thing
[19:41] that happens in Gideon's life is just
[19:43] building him up to where he can actually
[19:45] receive the fact he is a mighty man of
[19:48] Valor and that's what the Lord is doing
[19:50] as well he's building us up to receive
[19:53] the fact that we're Mighty people of
[19:55] Valor that we're actually that bride of
[19:57] Jesus Christ the things that have been
[19:58] coming over the pulpit I don't know if
[19:59] you noticed from brother Aaron
[20:01] but what is he doing
[20:03] it's building your faith to understand
[20:05] exactly what the relationship was with
[20:07] you in the Lord the Lord chose you
[20:10] he he was the one that chose you he's
[20:13] the one that's responsible for
[20:15] perfecting you he's the one that's
[20:16] taking care of these things he's the one
[20:18] that's responsible for conditioning you
[20:20] to believe those things and he takes
[20:22] that responsibility with full assurance
[20:25] that he's more than capable to do it
[20:27] it's not like he's worried about doing
[20:29] it
[20:30] you know the scripture says it's our
[20:32] adversary of the devil right it's our
[20:33] adversary you realize that while there
[20:36] is an adversarial relationship between
[20:38] the Lord and the Devil he's not really
[20:39] his adversary
[20:40] because at any moment in time what could
[20:42] the Lord do Satan
[20:45] gone
[20:46] that's not an adversary
[20:48] it's kind of like you and a bug that's
[20:50] really slow moving and not dangerous and
[20:52] you kind of take your finger and it's
[20:54] not really an adversarial relationship
[20:57] right it's an adversary to us
[21:00] but it's not an adversary to the Lord
[21:03] so if if we have an adversary we
[21:06] understand that that's okay we've got
[21:08] somebody that's overcome the adversary
[21:09] that that isn't even infected by the
[21:12] adversary
[21:13] right Christ and we just heard this
[21:16] preaching Christ went down he took
[21:18] everything with him all the sins that we
[21:19] had took it down and came right back up
[21:21] again right everything that we had
[21:23] everything that we would ever do from
[21:25] from the time you're born to the time
[21:27] you you leave this place and in whatever
[21:29] way you leave it all those things were
[21:31] taken care of in Christ
[21:32] so that adversarial relationship is
[21:35] already covered by Jesus Christ he's
[21:37] already taken care of it
[21:39] it's already there
[21:47] Romans the fifth chapter
[21:49] verses one to six
[21:56] and don't worry we're going to get to
[21:57] actually my my sermon we're not there
[21:59] yet we're just working our way
[22:01] so therefore being justified this is
[22:03] what the scripture says therefore being
[22:05] justified by faith we have peace with
[22:06] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[22:08] whom also we have access by faith into
[22:10] this grace wherein we stand and rejoice
[22:12] in Hope of the glory of God
[22:14] and not only so but we glory in
[22:16] tribulations also knowing that
[22:17] tribulation work patience patience
[22:20] experience and experience hope and hope
[22:22] maketh not ashamed because the love of
[22:24] God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
[22:26] Holy Ghost which is given unto us for
[22:28] when we are yet without Strength In Due
[22:31] Time Christ died
[22:32] for the ungodly
[22:34] so again what we're pointing to here is
[22:38] that the Lord is letting us know look it
[22:40] you got tribulations
[22:42] but these tribulations are doing
[22:44] something
[22:45] so the tribulations Works patience and
[22:48] and through that patience you get
[22:49] experience and through experience you
[22:51] get hope because you realize that this
[22:54] is building to something and the Lord is
[22:56] working something in your life
[22:58] so whether you know it or not Saints
[23:01] you're being conditioned as well
[23:03] so just like under the prince and power
[23:05] of the air
[23:06] that those children of Disobedience are
[23:09] conditioned to behave a certain way
[23:11] there's a reason that you see truce
[23:13] Breakers and liars and the politics and
[23:16] the demon power and all these different
[23:17] things they're conditioned to believe a
[23:19] certain way this same thing is taking
[23:21] place
[23:22] okay the same thing is taking place in
[23:24] your lives but just on the positive side
[23:27] of it and I'm going to try and reinforce
[23:29] this as I preach today because again we
[23:32] focus so much on negative everything is
[23:35] negative that's our life like the uh the
[23:38] experiences in life if there's a problem
[23:40] that you have with your spouse it's
[23:41] always the negative that comes out first
[23:42] right if you get into a crisis situation
[23:45] what happens you don't say hey you're
[23:48] wonderful and you know you do great
[23:50] things the first thing that you do is go
[23:52] to the negative side look at what you
[23:53] did last week look at what you did 10
[23:55] years ago look at what you did 20 years
[23:56] ago right that's where we go that's our
[23:58] human nature but yet Christ is working
[24:01] out something in us to get us somewhere
[24:03] else
[24:10] so remember this when we were out
[24:12] strength the Lord did this
[24:15] and I don't know about you but there's
[24:17] many times in my life I'm without
[24:19] strength still today
[24:23] you get into situations and it just
[24:25] doesn't seem like you have the strength
[24:27] to go through
[24:28] right
[24:30] but yet
[24:31] the Lord
[24:33] is more than able to get you through
[24:35] and
[24:36] he when we were yet without strength had
[24:38] strength for us and he manifests that
[24:40] strength when we need it he lets us know
[24:43] that that strength is there
[24:45] in second Peter 1 2-8 it says Grace and
[24:48] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[24:51] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[24:52] according as his divine power hath given
[24:54] unto us all things that pertain unto
[24:56] life and godliness through the knowledge
[24:58] of him that hath called us
[25:00] to glory and virtue whereby are given
[25:03] unto us exceeding great and precious
[25:05] promises that by these you might be
[25:06] partakers of the divine nature so here
[25:09] he has he's given us promises
[25:11] he's made sure that he's multiplying the
[25:13] knowledge to us he's giving us power
[25:16] through these things he's making sure
[25:18] that everything that pertains to life
[25:20] and godliness everything that pertains
[25:22] to what we have need of
[25:24] through him that we're able to get that
[25:27] glory and The Virtue through Christ
[25:30] because he's giving exceeding great and
[25:32] precious promises and then to buy these
[25:35] you might be partakers of the divine
[25:36] nature having escaped the corruption
[25:37] that is in the world through lust so
[25:39] he's making us divine
[25:44] okay that's pretty heavy
[25:47] because I don't know if you looked in
[25:48] the mirror but brother Chris Don't Look
[25:50] So Divine in the morning
[25:52] and maybe you're the same I don't know
[25:53] but at this what he's doing he's he's
[25:57] through these different things he's
[25:58] actually getting you to a place where
[26:01] you're taking on his nature
[26:03] his nature is manifesting in your life
[26:05] and that's why in the parking lot or on
[26:08] the highway you're able to stay calm and
[26:10] and you're able to be at peace with it
[26:12] or even if you get a little bit riled up
[26:14] afterwards you're able to because
[26:15] sometimes you do sometimes you know I
[26:18] don't know you know maybe I'm the only
[26:20] one in the room but most of us are
[26:21] humans I think
[26:23] okay there's no body snatcher aliens
[26:25] present this morning
[26:28] so you know sometimes we do you get
[26:31] angry sometimes those things happen
[26:34] I'll tell you if I remember I'll tell
[26:36] you a story in just a little bit
[26:41] um we're at verse five I think and
[26:42] besides this giving all diligence add to
[26:44] your faith virtue and to Virtue
[26:45] knowledge into knowledge Temperance and
[26:47] to Temperance patience and patience
[26:49] godliness and godliness brotherly
[26:51] kindness and the brother of the kindness
[26:53] charity for if these things be in you
[26:55] and abound they make you that you shall
[26:56] neither be Barren or unfruitful in the
[26:58] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ so
[27:00] what's the Lord doing he's saying look
[27:01] at I'm building you up I'm conditioning
[27:03] you for something I'm making you into
[27:05] something that seed that's in you is
[27:07] going to manifest into something it has
[27:09] to manifest I'm going to make sure you
[27:10] get there so I'm going to have you add
[27:12] these things I'm going to have you do
[27:14] these things I'm going to have you make
[27:15] sure that all these things happen to you
[27:20] so we're going to actually start getting
[27:21] into the message here in just a second
[27:22] for when God made Hebrews 6 13-15 it
[27:26] says for when God made promise to
[27:27] Abraham because he could swear by no
[27:29] greater he swear by himself saying
[27:31] surely
[27:33] blessing I Will Bless thee and
[27:34] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[27:36] after he had patiently endured he
[27:38] obtained the promise
[27:40] so we understand this that God well
[27:43] actually let me read just the next thing
[27:44] in the Philadelphian Church age
[27:47] um seven churches I hope that's okay
[27:48] with everyone uh brother Brandon is
[27:51] referring to Hebrews 11 17 it says by
[27:52] faith Abraham when he was tried offered
[27:54] up Isaac and he that had received the
[27:56] promise the word of God offered up his
[27:58] only begotten son there it is Abraham
[28:00] was try it after he received the Word of
[28:02] Promise
[28:03] most think that as soon as we pray in
[28:05] Jesus name over the good Promises of God
[28:06] that there could not be a trial
[28:09] sorry it's not how it works so brother
[28:12] brand makes it pretty clear right here
[28:14] but here it says that Abraham was tried
[28:16] after he received the promise that is
[28:19] exactly correct according to psalmist
[28:21] referring to to Joseph so Psalms 105 19
[28:23] until that time that his word came
[28:28] the word of the Lord Tried Him God gives
[28:30] us exceeding great and precious promises
[28:32] he has promised to fulfill them he will
[28:34] but from the time we pray until the time
[28:36] we get the answer we must learn to
[28:38] receive patience into our souls for only
[28:41] in patience do we possess life may God
[28:43] help us to learn this lesson even as we
[28:45] know the people of this sixth age
[28:47] learned patience we read the history of
[28:50] the lives of these great Christians what
[28:51] a contrast we see between their lives
[28:53] and ours for they were so patient and
[28:55] quiet and today we are but overcome and
[28:57] over impatience and haste now I can
[29:00] remember when I was a Youngster and it
[29:03] was quite a while ago as you can tell by
[29:04] my loss of hair and grayness and other
[29:07] situations that present themselves
[29:09] before you but one of the things that
[29:12] that I do know is when I was a Youngster
[29:15] and this would be after brother Branham
[29:18] had passed I was born in 63 so and
[29:21] passed in 65 so we're talking here about
[29:23] over impatience in haste and this is in
[29:25] the 60s
[29:26] so I grew up in the 70s
[29:29] and certainly you would have thought
[29:32] that people were over impatient and
[29:34] Hasty then
[29:35] but let's come fast forward to today
[29:38] and guess what the like the length of
[29:40] time for the attention span of a kid is
[29:43] nowadays
[29:44] kids what's your attention span nobody's
[29:46] gonna nobody's gonna admit this right
[29:48] now
[29:48] three seconds six seconds
[29:52] five seconds
[29:56] actually it depends on the kid
[30:03] but
[30:04] the fact of the matter is it's actually
[30:06] seconds
[30:08] they they have to change images have to
[30:10] change constantly
[30:13] things have to change the way that they
[30:15] make films and things nowadays in games
[30:17] and everything there has to be a change
[30:19] in the image constantly it has to fire
[30:20] off all the time
[30:22] and and it's because that same thing is
[30:25] just snowballed
[30:26] so look at here again is the negative
[30:28] right if the if Satan has perfected this
[30:32] to where people are so over impatient
[30:35] and Hasty and to the fact that our
[30:37] attention sounds now are down into the
[30:39] seconds rather than minutes or hours
[30:41] you know it used to be that people could
[30:43] actually sit and do nothing
[30:45] for hours
[30:46] and be perfectly happy doing that
[30:49] I know the women are thinking the guys
[30:51] do that all the time husbands
[30:53] that's what they do they just sit and do
[30:55] nothing that's that's kind of how they
[30:56] are
[30:57] but and I I do think men have a special
[30:59] ability to actually go to a nothing
[31:01] place and do nothing that that is
[31:02] certainly an ability that they have but
[31:05] the reality is is this has been
[31:06] perfected now
[31:07] I don't know how your attention and can
[31:09] get much shorter than seconds
[31:11] nanoseconds I don't know like you blink
[31:14] and then you're on to the next thing
[31:15] because that's where we're getting to
[31:17] so understand that in the same sense
[31:21] that that patience has gone from the
[31:25] children of disobedience
[31:27] understand that the patience for the
[31:28] people of God has increased the other
[31:31] direction
[31:33] so now we're actually going to start
[31:34] getting into our sermon because this is
[31:37] where I want to kind of take us so
[31:39] understand this
[31:40] um
[31:41] just before I re I want to go back and
[31:44] read that definition so if you could go
[31:45] back
[31:46] to the I think the second
[31:49] one brother John
[31:55] so
[31:57] the definition of air conditioning the
[31:59] control of temperature humidity Purity
[32:01] emotion of air in an enclosed space
[32:02] independent of outside conditions so
[32:05] like I said I know dads appreciate this
[32:07] I know we appreciate it I appreciate it
[32:09] I think you appreciate it
[32:11] but one of the things that's interesting
[32:13] about air conditioning is you know the
[32:15] effect of it is an amazing thing
[32:18] because you can right now outside it's
[32:21] probably I don't know 100 degrees are
[32:22] coming up on 100 degrees I don't know
[32:24] what it is here Philip you could
[32:25] probably tell me by looking at the
[32:26] little thing but the amazing thing is is
[32:29] right outside this building it's hot
[32:32] and in this lovely you know outfit that
[32:35] I have on and maybe your help at the
[32:37] same if you go out there and stand for a
[32:38] while and especially if you're not in
[32:39] the shade and you stand in the sun
[32:40] you're going to feel the effects of that
[32:43] right but there's a really awesome thing
[32:44] you can walk into the building you can
[32:47] take a thermostat and set a temperature
[32:49] and you can sit down in the cool
[32:52] now the whole building is surrounded
[32:54] right it's heat in fact we haven't even
[32:57] gotten miserable yet because Monsoon
[32:58] hasn't kicked in
[33:00] so I mean this has been one of the
[33:02] better I think kind of spring Summers
[33:04] that we've had in a while it's
[33:05] I mean I'm I don't know about you but
[33:07] I'm thankful for it but the reality is
[33:09] is that we we go from an air-conditioned
[33:12] car to an air-conditioned building
[33:15] whether it's a job or the store or
[33:17] whatever and then we get back out of
[33:18] that place and we go back into an
[33:20] air-conditioned car and we go somewhere
[33:21] right but are we in the environment
[33:25] yeah the environment surrounds us
[33:28] it's all around
[33:30] and that's how gross darkness is
[33:33] you're you're right now in an
[33:35] environment
[33:36] that Satan is controlling Prince and
[33:38] power of the air he's there he's in
[33:40] control of those things and it's sticky
[33:42] and it's thick now I know we have some
[33:45] that have moved from from where it's
[33:47] more humid than Arizona
[33:49] uh but I I've been to where it's sticky
[33:52] and I don't particularly like it uh
[33:54] because I I don't know about you but if
[33:56] you found that if you shower and then
[33:58] you get out of the shower you
[33:59] immediately want to take another shower
[34:00] because like you just feel like it's
[34:03] just so heavy and it's so hot and you
[34:05] know people say how do you live in
[34:06] Arizona well we have a secret right air
[34:09] conditioning
[34:12] we don't tell anybody because when I'm
[34:13] to move here but
[34:16] because they're like how can you live
[34:17] where it's 120. I don't stay out when
[34:19] it's 120 I'm in air conditioning
[34:22] like how do you live when it's you know
[34:24] 95 and 95 humidity you probably got air
[34:27] conditioning I mean kind of works the
[34:29] same in Arizona is here I know my sister
[34:31] years ago she lives in Alaska and years
[34:34] ago she uh
[34:36] um had come to my parents home and it
[34:39] was really and this is off the subject
[34:41] but she had come to my parents home and
[34:44] um one of the my my parents friends was
[34:46] there and they're asking her about
[34:48] Alaska now she lives just outside
[34:50] Anchorage in a town called Wasilla
[34:51] Anchorage is a modern city
[34:53] and the the family is the the person is
[34:56] asking her she's like so do you have
[34:58] igloos Where You Are
[35:00] you know I mean how do you guys get your
[35:02] food
[35:03] we go to the store
[35:05] I I have a pickup truck and a house
[35:08] because it's modern Alaska it's not like
[35:11] you know Eskimo Igloo Alaska although
[35:13] they have those but she lived in a you
[35:16] know Anchorage is a modern city it's got
[35:17] an airport it's got airplanes they got
[35:18] all those things even 20 years ago or 30
[35:20] years ago they had those things
[35:22] uh but it's funny how people's
[35:24] perception of things is based on what
[35:26] little knowledge that they might
[35:27] possibly have
[35:28] so for someone from the south that's
[35:31] living in humidity and all that
[35:32] stickiness and that and they're like how
[35:33] can you survive in Arizona it's like
[35:35] brother I do the same thing you do
[35:37] I get out of that stickiness and I get
[35:39] an air conditioning and I stay in it
[35:41] until I have to go out in the stickiness
[35:43] and survive
[35:44] but one of the things that I want to
[35:46] point out about natural air conditioning
[35:48] is that you can have an environment
[35:50] around you
[35:51] right that's hot it's muggy it's sticky
[35:56] and you can actually live
[35:59] outside of that environment or actually
[36:01] inside that environment because you're
[36:02] protected and encapsulated in something
[36:04] that's controlled
[36:06] because right now this building's
[36:08] temperature is controlled by that little
[36:10] thing back there
[36:11] and it's controlling that temperature
[36:13] and because it's controlling that
[36:15] temperature we don't have to suffer with
[36:17] the fact that I want like I would be
[36:18] poor and sweat right now and trying to
[36:21] preach to you and in some foreign
[36:22] countries that's the way it is like
[36:23] you're Outdoors whatever the temp is
[36:25] that's what it is but here we get to
[36:27] enjoy something right we we get to enjoy
[36:29] a presence of air conditioning around us
[36:31] and that presence keeps us and we're
[36:34] encapsulated from it and so even though
[36:36] outside there might be somebody walking
[36:38] by that's suffering because they're out
[36:40] in the Heat and maybe they're getting
[36:41] hyperthermic and maybe one of you is
[36:43] sitting under a vent today and going
[36:45] it's really chilly in here
[36:47] why because outside it's hot
[36:49] outside it could be miserable but inside
[36:52] you're protected you're encapsulated
[36:54] you're surrounded by something
[36:56] so if you could go to the tile number
[36:58] three and I don't know that you can zoom
[37:00] in but
[37:01] so the actual title in my sermon today
[37:03] air conditioning is actually air
[37:05] conditioning Heir conditioning
[37:08] not air conditioning it's Heir
[37:11] conditioning I know that I kind of
[37:13] squeeze that together I kind of did it
[37:14] on purpose
[37:15] but that's actually Heir conditioning
[37:19] because air conditioning is taking place
[37:22] right now
[37:24] the scripture teaches us this
[37:27] Galatians 3 29 just tile 17 and if you
[37:30] could be Christ then are you Abraham
[37:32] said in heirs according to the promise
[37:34] so we're heirs today
[37:36] you're in Heir according to the promise
[37:39] now I believe I'm talking to wheat today
[37:42] I believe that seed is planted in You by
[37:44] Christ I believe that's why we're
[37:45] gathered together I think all those
[37:47] things are in you
[37:48] but you got a sticky nature
[37:51] right and you got a sticky nature so you
[37:54] want to know what you need to do to fix
[37:55] that sticky nature you got to be
[37:57] air-conditioned
[37:58] ACI are conditioned you have to come
[38:01] under the influence of that air
[38:02] conditioning and that air conditioning
[38:04] is actually changing your live Saints
[38:06] today it's actually drawing you closer
[38:08] to him every day that you're here and
[38:11] you're like listen brother Chris these
[38:12] things happen I've got all these trials
[38:14] and tests that are happening I I don't
[38:16] understand what's taking place and then
[38:18] you know my co-workers on my word I'm
[38:20] with these co-workers and there's
[38:21] something else and you know this music
[38:23] every time I go to the store and they
[38:24] got all these things on the shelves and
[38:26] everything else yeah all those things
[38:28] are out there but you're encapsulated
[38:30] today
[38:31] you're actually in something better than
[38:33] this building and with better control
[38:35] than what's there
[38:37] because Jesus Christ is able to air
[38:39] condition you to such a point that that
[38:41] sticky nature doesn't have the same hold
[38:43] on you that it has on everybody else
[38:45] that gross Darkness that's around the
[38:48] world that you're under right now that
[38:49] we you know where you can see it you can
[38:51] kind of feel it's kind of there
[38:53] that doesn't have the same effect
[38:55] you know it's kind of an interesting
[38:57] thing I I know that the Super Bowl was
[38:59] here not that long ago and one of the
[39:01] things that I kept hearing on the radio
[39:03] about the Super Bowl was oh you got to
[39:05] get down where the Super Bowl experience
[39:06] is
[39:07] because in that Super Bowl experience
[39:09] there was just this something in the air
[39:12] late there's like a tension or something
[39:14] and I suppose if you go to different
[39:16] events and you get enough people in
[39:17] there you can have that kind of
[39:19] something in the air
[39:20] right there's just something there's
[39:22] there's a tension there's a there
[39:24] there's it's just like oh I gotta get
[39:26] there I gotta I gotta experience this I
[39:27] gotta throw a football to a pro football
[39:29] player I got to do something like that
[39:31] it's very exciting I got to do that
[39:32] because there's something in the air
[39:34] it's Super Bowl
[39:35] everything's super right you got to have
[39:37] everything super supersonic speed we got
[39:39] to have super whatever Superman's doing
[39:41] stuff you know everybody's super
[39:44] but that experience you got to partake
[39:47] in it because there's something in the
[39:49] air
[39:50] right but Christ while that that thing
[39:54] is in the air and it's around you and it
[39:57] surrounds you Jesus Christ makes sure
[39:59] that you're protected
[40:02] he makes sure that you're under a
[40:04] different conditioning process
[40:06] because you're not being conditioned in
[40:07] the negative to receive those negative
[40:10] promises because there are promises lord
[40:13] said hey this is what I'm going to do to
[40:14] the children of Disobedience right this
[40:16] is what's going to happen but your
[40:18] promises are positive and amen right
[40:21] those promises are positive and amen to
[40:23] everyone that believes
[40:27] so here we are heirs according to the
[40:29] promise would we agree
[40:31] there were heirs okay so we know we've
[40:33] got gross Darkness around
[40:35] right that's where we live
[40:37] but yet Saints you can live in a
[40:40] different atmosphere
[40:43] you can exit that atmosphere and come in
[40:45] where something is controlled
[40:47] something is different
[40:49] now there's an interesting thing about
[40:51] the the building that we're in and the
[40:52] air conditioning that you're under right
[40:53] now
[40:54] now some of you undoubtedly are probably
[40:56] a little cool I don't know what the
[40:57] temperature is Philip you could probably
[40:58] say but
[41:00] um
[41:01] some of you are probably
[41:02] hot because as we started out the day we
[41:05] didn't have so many bodies in here
[41:07] right and as our bodies start to heat we
[41:09] get a little bit warmer and everybody
[41:10] gets a little bit warmer but some of you
[41:12] are probably sitting under a vent
[41:14] and if you're sitting under a vent
[41:15] you're nice and cool I hope
[41:19] but for the sake of the sermon you're
[41:20] nice and cool okay because
[41:24] you have to help me out here you got to
[41:26] give a brother a little help
[41:28] but why is it that you're nice and cool
[41:32] and somebody else maybe isn't so maybe
[41:34] they're not quite as pleasant as you are
[41:37] because you made a choice when you
[41:38] walked in the door
[41:40] right you decided where you were going
[41:42] to sit
[41:44] and maybe well some of you kids maybe
[41:46] you didn't decide where you're going to
[41:48] sit somebody that brought you in here
[41:49] said you're sitting here like Dad said
[41:51] Dave this is your seat take a seat right
[41:54] sometimes sometimes things happen
[41:56] because other people make choices and it
[41:58] affects our lives
[42:00] but just as often it's our choices that
[42:02] we do and it affects the the effect of
[42:05] what's actually taking place
[42:07] so while there's air conditioning
[42:09] available
[42:10] and that that presence is there that
[42:13] encapsulation is there maybe the effect
[42:16] because of the choice that we've made
[42:18] isn't having the same effect on us that
[42:20] it's having on someone else
[42:22] so here's the secret get to the vent
[42:26] you got to get to where the air is
[42:27] moving
[42:28] right you got to get to the right thing
[42:31] and and with the Lord
[42:33] the secret is get in the spirit
[42:37] because the spirit is where the power is
[42:39] the spirit is where that control is the
[42:42] spirit is where that that changes you
[42:44] and it makes you different the spirit is
[42:46] where you really get conditioned into
[42:48] something because without that Spirit
[42:50] I'm sorry but you're going to have the
[42:52] effects of that coming in if in other
[42:54] words this if we can't control that
[42:56] thermostat if there's not a control
[42:57] there and that thing's not working right
[43:00] eventually what's outside comes inside
[43:04] right it starts to affect deeper and
[43:06] deeper in this place
[43:08] so that Spirit of the Lord actually
[43:10] moves and does something and changes and
[43:13] makes things happen you know I don't
[43:15] think it's a coincidence that that the
[43:17] scripture teaches us that Christ
[43:19] breathed on them and said receive the
[43:21] Holy Ghost and then when the Holy Ghost
[43:23] came I don't think it was a coincidence
[43:24] that the Holy Ghost came with a rushing
[43:27] Mighty Wind right now we realize that he
[43:30] deals with us in a still small voice but
[43:32] yet what was Christ doing
[43:34] yeah you've got a prince and power of
[43:36] the air called the enemy or the devil
[43:37] right
[43:39] but he's not in control
[43:41] so the Lord was just using air to say
[43:44] hey
[43:45] I've got power too
[43:47] right I've got something too
[43:49] there's something here that I have so
[43:52] when I breathe out and when I have a
[43:54] wind come it's going to have an effect
[43:56] and that effect is going to change
[43:58] people and it's going to take them right
[43:59] out of gross darkness and right into the
[44:02] promises of God because they're Heirs of
[44:04] something we're Heirs of the promise so
[44:06] the promise has been given we know that
[44:08] we have a promise of eternal life we
[44:10] know that we have a promise that that
[44:11] Christ is going to live in us we know
[44:13] that we have all these promises we have
[44:14] promises of healing right we have
[44:16] promises of virtue we have promises of
[44:18] peace and joy we have these different
[44:20] promises yet in the promises we have
[44:22] trials
[44:24] why why
[44:26] because you're you're being conditioned
[44:28] to receive something
[44:30] so
[44:31] Abraham and Sarah
[44:34] right here they're going through their
[44:36] life they've they've got something going
[44:38] on for 25 years we know from the
[44:40] scripture and we won't read it today but
[44:41] from the scripture we we know that
[44:43] they've been waiting on a promise right
[44:45] the whole time Abraham and they're
[44:48] having to endure this time
[44:51] because I don't know about you but if if
[44:54] you know somebody that's about 90 years
[44:55] old walks up to me and says I'm going to
[44:57] have a baby
[44:58] I'm like okay
[45:00] God bless you
[45:02] talk to you later gotta go got something
[45:05] to do
[45:07] but so they're having to endure
[45:11] so Saints what is it that they're having
[45:13] to endure it's it's the fact that that
[45:16] promise hasn't manifested yet or maybe
[45:18] isn't manifesting but yet the promise is
[45:20] already working
[45:22] the what's happening in their lives is
[45:24] they're already being conditioned to
[45:26] receive the promised son right that
[45:29] conditioning is always happening
[45:34] in Abraham's Grace Covenant it's not on
[45:36] the on the slides
[45:38] um
[45:39] the brother Brandon was talking about
[45:41] you know Abram had something to do
[45:43] and the Lord had something to do and so
[45:47] um brother branham's talking about the
[45:48] particular situation here and and and
[45:50] and that the fact that you know um Sarah
[45:53] becomes young again and so he's like
[45:55] well yeah prove that she became young
[45:56] it's like well look at she goes to where
[45:59] abimelech is and you know abimelech
[46:01] who's this ruler that can have the
[46:03] choice of any women in the Kingdom
[46:04] because that's kind of what the the you
[46:06] know the king got or the the ruler got
[46:09] he got that opportunity to pick anybody
[46:11] he wanted and then he's attracted to the
[46:13] grandma that shows up
[46:15] right
[46:17] yeah he's like ah
[46:18] you you beautiful young women I don't
[46:20] want you I want this old lady right
[46:22] there
[46:23] I I love her
[46:25] I'm so attracted to her I want her
[46:28] but what he was showing was that look at
[46:31] for all those years that they were
[46:32] walking they were being conditioned to
[46:35] receive something
[46:37] and all the years that you're walking
[46:39] Saints you're being conditioned to
[46:40] receive something now when Sarah got to
[46:43] the body change and and we're talking a
[46:45] little bit about that today when she got
[46:47] to the body change yeah she became a
[46:49] young woman again but that wasn't the
[46:50] end of it because remember even when she
[46:52] was a young woman so she's 20 years old
[46:54] whatever she can't have children 30
[46:56] years old she can't have children 40
[46:58] years old she can't have children
[47:00] so she gets to be an old woman still
[47:01] hasn't had a child
[47:03] but after that conditioning had taken
[47:06] place and then there's a new condition
[47:08] that takes place
[47:09] right because now the promise is being
[47:11] made manifest that new condition takes
[47:14] place and now not only has she turned
[47:16] young again
[47:17] but she's also able to bring forth life
[47:20] and that's exactly what the Lord's doing
[47:22] with us
[47:23] it's not just the fact that you're going
[47:25] to turn young again now for some of you
[47:26] that are younger you're going to get
[47:28] older
[47:30] so I don't know if that's a happy
[47:32] feeling or not when I was younger I was
[47:34] excited about being older until I got
[47:36] older and then I want to be younger
[47:38] again
[47:38] but you know that's kind of how it is
[47:41] right you when you're younger you get
[47:42] older and some of you I'm sorry if
[47:44] you're 18 to 20 years old not much
[47:45] change
[47:46] so you're just kind of maybe a little
[47:49] bit but not not too much happening so
[47:51] for the older ones and the younger ones
[47:52] maybe it's a little bit easier to get
[47:54] excited about things like that
[47:56] but there's a change that's taking place
[47:59] and that change is not just to bring you
[48:01] you know a nice young body
[48:04] for a meeting in the air it's not just
[48:06] for that that changes to actually bring
[48:08] forth life and that's what's happening
[48:10] as you're bringing forth life and that
[48:12] life it becomes such a manifestation of
[48:15] something that when you're caught away
[48:16] here's the other part of the change
[48:18] that's taking place
[48:19] the condition that you're in right now
[48:21] and I know I I preach on space I I'm
[48:24] sorry I'm not preaching on Space today
[48:25] but we're preaching on air
[48:27] which is kind of close and even in the
[48:29] definition I think it said space so
[48:31] we're kind of hitting on it
[48:34] but
[48:35] one of the other things that has to take
[48:37] place is that you're going to have a
[48:39] body change to the point that you don't
[48:41] need a spaceship
[48:45] hey you don't need an astronaut suit
[48:49] I don't know about you but that's pretty
[48:50] impressive to me
[48:52] because if you're going to meet the Lord
[48:54] in the air that body has to change in
[48:55] such a way that you can do that
[48:57] there has to be something such a great
[48:59] change in you that you can actually take
[49:02] off of this planet without a propulsion
[49:05] system without a special suit on without
[49:08] Elon Musk being a part of it or or uh
[49:12] Bezos being a part of it Jeff Bezos
[49:14] whatever you don't need those things
[49:17] because God is conditioning a body
[49:19] change in you right now and I know when
[49:21] we look in the mirror we don't see that
[49:24] but we do see what Satan's doing all the
[49:27] time
[49:28] so Saints if he's doing that imagine how
[49:31] much more God's doing what he promised
[49:33] to do God is taking care of that
[49:35] situation and he's making sure that
[49:37] you're going to get there
[49:38] so we know absolutely beyond a shadow of
[49:41] a doubt what's taking place in our lives
[49:44] you're being air-conditioned right now
[49:46] your body is changing
[49:49] don't see it
[49:51] you know I guess we that are alive and
[49:54] remain I I guess you know we we can say
[49:55] yeah that's awesome we're going to
[49:57] change young but imagine the change that
[49:58] you're going to have if you're somebody
[49:59] that's already went to the Grave
[50:02] right
[50:03] some go to the Grave some go to the Sea
[50:05] some go to the Crematory
[50:07] I mean but yet they have that change
[50:10] coming too and because before they went
[50:13] out of this life there was something
[50:15] that conditioned them to prepare them
[50:17] for that day so we know when we
[50:19] understand that they're just waiting in
[50:21] a place to be called just to meet the
[50:24] same meaning that we're going to their
[50:25] meeting too so those changes are
[50:27] actually taking place
[50:29] but again I want to stress to you in in
[50:32] this particular sermon that air
[50:35] conditioning is so important for us
[50:38] it's something that has to take place
[50:40] and so when you have a test or you have
[50:42] a trailer you have these things that you
[50:43] go through understand that the Lord is
[50:45] actually conditioning you to something
[50:48] so let me give a personal example when I
[50:52] was a young person
[50:53] and this was a long time ago kids so
[50:56] it's okay I was young at one point
[50:59] when I was a young person I I was uh um
[51:03] my brothers were kind of the like the
[51:06] Rough and Tumble boys
[51:07] and I wasn't so I was the youngest in
[51:10] the family of seven
[51:12] um and and they tended to be especially
[51:14] the the middle boys tended to be kind of
[51:16] hotheads and I wasn't and so I'm
[51:19] thinking yeah pretty good you know
[51:20] people would do things to me and I
[51:22] couldn't stay mad at anybody for more
[51:23] than five minutes
[51:24] like it just that was my nature that was
[51:26] the nature I was born with you know some
[51:28] of us are born with a nature to be bold
[51:31] So when you say oh they needed boldness
[51:32] some people are just born with the
[51:34] nature they're just in your face like
[51:36] they're just bold that's your natural
[51:38] you know that's what you're born with
[51:39] right you're just that's the way you are
[51:41] some of us are are quiet from birth I
[51:45] mean that's just the way we are right
[51:46] you say well you need to have a Meek and
[51:48] quiet Spirit whether I was born with
[51:50] that like
[51:51] you know but the reality is when you're
[51:54] going through these things I'm going to
[51:55] use my own personal example here when
[51:57] you're going through these things
[51:58] there's a reason because in my thinking
[52:00] I'm thinking you know I I'm doing pretty
[52:03] good like I don't really get upset it
[52:05] takes a lot and even if people did stuff
[52:07] mean to me or whatever you know five
[52:08] minutes later I'm over it it just that
[52:10] was just my personality I was optimistic
[52:12] that's the nature I was born with
[52:14] and then guess what happened
[52:18] life
[52:19] anybody anybody have life happen to you
[52:23] yeah well it happened to brother Chris
[52:26] life happened it kind of Hit me hard
[52:29] and one day I realized that actually
[52:31] people could do things
[52:33] to the point that I would be angry a lot
[52:35] longer than five minutes
[52:37] and I would be upset a lot longer than
[52:39] that
[52:39] but what the Lord was doing was he was
[52:42] having to show me that listen you're
[52:43] relying on your own natural ability
[52:46] and sometimes you got to not rely on
[52:48] that
[52:49] because I had that natural ability but
[52:51] the Lord had to show me listen that's
[52:53] not where it's at you've got to find
[52:55] this in me because if you're relying on
[52:57] your natural ability to be bold or to be
[52:59] meek or to be humble or whatever it is
[53:01] if you're relying on that guess what's
[53:03] coming
[53:05] some kind of trial some kind of test and
[53:08] we call it life
[53:09] because it's coming at you
[53:11] because the Lord is going to condition
[53:13] you to receive exactly what it is that
[53:15] you have need of
[53:17] he's going to make sure under his air
[53:19] conditioning Heir conditioning that that
[53:22] air conditioning is going to take you
[53:24] beyond what you think you're capable of
[53:25] doing and Beyond what you even maybe
[53:28] were born with the ability to do
[53:31] and it's going to take you into a realm
[53:33] where things change and life changes and
[53:36] you can see that not just that Satan is
[53:39] making some kind of perfect Eden but God
[53:41] is bringing us back to a perfect place
[53:43] and at the same time that we can see the
[53:45] effects of what's going on outside here
[53:47] that we can understand that the Lord is
[53:49] working and the Lord is doing these
[53:51] things in a greater way in his children
[53:55] the problem is that sticky nature
[53:57] the sticky nature confuses us
[54:00] but when you get in the encapsulated
[54:02] area of the Holy Ghost because remember
[54:05] Abraham and Sarah who they had to meet
[54:07] Melchizedek right you got to meet Christ
[54:10] if you if you haven't met Christ you've
[54:12] got to meet him and you got to have that
[54:14] personal relationship and you have to
[54:16] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:17] because that's that that air of the Holy
[54:20] Ghost the power that spirit that moves
[54:22] that's the one that actually has to be
[54:24] in control that's the one that has to
[54:26] change your natural gifts or your
[54:28] natural abilities into something that
[54:30] God can use
[54:31] and to where we're not thinking man
[54:33] naturally I'm I'm pretty good I'm a
[54:35] great guy you know I don't get mad I
[54:37] don't get angry and then you realize
[54:38] that actually yeah you do
[54:40] actually yeah you need to work on that
[54:42] actually there's something here that
[54:44] that needs to take place in your life
[54:45] and something has to change
[54:47] and there's something that takes place
[54:50] so
[54:55] so under these different things and um
[55:00] in Abraham's Grace Covenant brother
[55:01] Branham says something
[55:04] to this way he says we which are alive
[55:07] and sorry we which are alive shall be
[55:09] changed in a moment twinkling of an eye
[55:11] an old man will be young an old woman
[55:13] will be young again and will be
[55:14] conditioned to meet the promised son
[55:18] Glory Hallelujah
[55:20] that's the next thing in God's order
[55:24] now we meet him here
[55:26] but not a formal introduction like
[55:28] you're going to have coming
[55:31] right because we have to meet Christ
[55:33] here
[55:34] that's if if you are Christ the
[55:36] scripture says right then we're heirs
[55:38] so that means you've got to be his you
[55:40] have to meet him you have to invite him
[55:42] in you have to make these things happen
[55:44] you have to be a part of that atmosphere
[55:47] already
[55:49] and then when you do that then then
[55:51] Christ works on that conditioning to get
[55:54] you to the place to where you have that
[55:55] formal introduction
[55:57] right where something actually happens
[55:59] there
[56:00] in the super sign brother Branham says
[56:02] this
[56:03] he can make everything work according to
[56:05] his big time clock that's ticking away
[56:07] for he could foretell the end from the
[56:09] beginning and therefore he knew that we
[56:10] would live in this day he knew that this
[56:12] would be our day he had plans for this
[56:15] day he has had plans for every day and
[56:17] never has one of his plans ever failed
[56:19] he's always on time
[56:21] and and and in the greatest news flash
[56:24] in history he says look at uh he would
[56:26] meet them at a certain designation so
[56:27] he's talking about Christ and the
[56:29] disciples he said hey we're going to
[56:30] meet at this certain place like you know
[56:32] go to the other side and we're going to
[56:33] meet you there so there was a designated
[56:35] place so there's a designation for us
[56:37] this morning and actually kind of going
[56:39] into another sermon but there's a
[56:41] designation and it says I'll meet you in
[56:44] the morning in the air right so you've
[56:46] got a designated place to go to and
[56:48] you're going to be conditioned to get to
[56:50] that place
[56:51] and that conditioning is taking place
[56:53] all the time it's something that's
[56:55] moving and breathing and changing and
[56:57] having a different effect on different
[56:59] people and it's causing us to get there
[57:02] from where we are today
[57:05] I'm skipping through a lot of these
[57:07] things I had to take I had so many notes
[57:09] that I had or
[57:10] slides that I had to cut them down
[57:12] because I knew that I would be
[57:14] really long I'm thinking I'm doing not
[57:16] too bad on time see the only thing is
[57:18] it's kind of like this uh for a preacher
[57:21] you have to just be shorter than the
[57:22] other preacher right for people to
[57:23] appreciate you it's kind of like
[57:26] it's kind of like if if you're you know
[57:28] if you're there's a bear chasing you how
[57:30] fast do you have to be just faster than
[57:32] the slowest person that's there right
[57:34] you just as long as you're a little bit
[57:36] faster than them everything's good so
[57:38] that's what we're trying to do
[57:40] but I want to as we we're going to bring
[57:43] this to a close I I hope that you're
[57:45] understanding that while we're in this
[57:47] world there and there's negative around
[57:48] and we can acknowledge those things
[57:50] let's not forget the fact that we're
[57:53] being conditioned as well
[57:54] and that you can be encapsulated by
[57:56] something and you can be protected by
[57:58] something and you can be taken out of
[57:59] something to the point that you can
[58:02] actually see Christ moving and Christ
[58:04] changing and when we have the trials and
[58:07] tests that are happening we can
[58:08] understand that listen this is just to
[58:10] get you to a promise so you've been
[58:13] given a promise and then the promise is
[58:15] going to manifest just like with um with
[58:18] Abraham and Sarah they were given a
[58:21] promise tests and Trials happen then the
[58:23] promise manifested right and that's the
[58:26] same thing for us Saints given a promise
[58:27] a lot of promises those promises are
[58:30] coming to pass as as we sit here
[58:33] actually and and those effects are
[58:35] actually taking place but there's
[58:37] something greater right that is coming
[58:41] and everything that's happening now is
[58:43] just preparing you so that trial that
[58:45] you had to go through
[58:47] and and it wasn't pleasant and there may
[58:50] be trials coming down the road that
[58:51] aren't Pleasant there may be tests that
[58:53] are coming down the road that aren't
[58:54] Pleasant I know some of us have endured
[58:56] wounds that are are deep and and you
[58:58] know I know this I've met people in my
[59:00] personal life that that I don't know how
[59:02] they endure
[59:04] I mean it astounds me because by God's
[59:07] grace I haven't had to endure what they
[59:09] have but yet God gives them Grace
[59:13] so you know everybody goes through
[59:15] different things and people handle
[59:17] things differently in their lives
[59:19] but I just want you to remember this so
[59:21] we understand this particular thing that
[59:24] um
[59:25] that while there's a prince and power of
[59:27] the air there is a prince and power of
[59:29] the air h-e-i-r okay and that that
[59:32] particular one
[59:34] um through his spirit
[59:36] is not just the prince and power of the
[59:39] air but he's also the the Prince of
[59:41] Peace to that air he's the Mighty God to
[59:43] that air he's the counselor to that Heir
[59:45] he's he's the comforter to that Heir
[59:48] he's the king to that air all these
[59:50] things he's the Everlasting father so
[59:52] this on Father's Day he's the
[59:54] Everlasting father to his heirs he is
[59:57] all these things so there's a reason
[1:00:00] that the Lord meets Us in the air I
[1:00:03] think it's the show Satan look at you
[1:00:05] you you're thinking that you got this
[1:00:07] thing under control
[1:00:09] right you think that you like this gross
[1:00:12] Darkness you're in control of this
[1:00:13] buddy you're not in control of anything
[1:00:16] because just to show you I'm going to
[1:00:18] condition my children to the point that
[1:00:21] they're going to meet in the place that
[1:00:22] you think you control
[1:00:24] we could have met anywhere
[1:00:26] we could have met on Jupiter I mean Lord
[1:00:28] could have said hey promise we're going
[1:00:30] to meet on Jupiter but that's not what
[1:00:32] he said
[1:00:33] he said we're we're going to meet in the
[1:00:34] air where are we meeting in what Satan
[1:00:37] considers to be his domain
[1:00:39] but brother sister God
[1:00:42] is the prince and power of the air
[1:00:44] h-e-i-r he's The Prince and power of you
[1:00:48] okay and that conditioning everything
[1:00:50] that's necessary for you all the
[1:00:52] conditions that are necessary for you to
[1:00:54] meet are being met in Jesus Christ and
[1:00:56] that Holy Ghost is breathing and is
[1:00:59] powerful and is moving and if we invite
[1:01:02] him in in a greater way if we sing the
[1:01:04] songs I have a lot of scriptures written
[1:01:06] down here but I'm going to try and bring
[1:01:07] this to a close that just the things
[1:01:09] that the Lord is doing and and how he's
[1:01:11] actually working in us to make us into
[1:01:14] that image to to bring us into that
[1:01:17] place and all those different scriptures
[1:01:19] are pointing to is the fact that God is
[1:01:21] doing something in our lives and he's
[1:01:24] making something in our lives so when
[1:01:26] you go out in the world today and you go
[1:01:29] to take Dad to to lunch or if you're
[1:01:31] doing that I don't know but if you're
[1:01:33] going to take father to lunch for
[1:01:34] Father's Day hopefully one there's not a
[1:01:37] lot of crowds but hopefully too that
[1:01:39] you'll remember this that you're you're
[1:01:40] under a particular umbrella you're under
[1:01:43] a a protection you're in a protected
[1:01:46] area you're under a complete thing that
[1:01:50] is able to condition you to the point
[1:01:51] that you can be in this world and not of
[1:01:54] this world and when when you're reviled
[1:01:57] just like Christ when somebody speaks
[1:01:59] something evil against you you can
[1:02:01] respond with kindness
[1:02:02] and when you're uh you know you feel
[1:02:06] like somebody has wronged you you can
[1:02:08] actually take the lower seat and
[1:02:10] apologize to them instead you can
[1:02:12] actually do those things because the
[1:02:14] spirit of Christ rests on you and it has
[1:02:16] done something to you and it has changed
[1:02:18] you and made you into something
[1:02:20] different why don't you stand with me
[1:02:32] you know isn't it amazing that the Lord
[1:02:35] gives us comfort
[1:02:38] you know he could have been he could
[1:02:40] have been
[1:02:41] when when the Holy Ghost came
[1:02:45] the Lord could have sent it said
[1:02:47] anything you know as far as what that
[1:02:50] particular thing was going to be he
[1:02:52] could have said you know this is going
[1:02:53] to be a mighty warrior this is going to
[1:02:55] be a defeater of enemies this is going
[1:02:57] to be what everybody said I'm sending
[1:02:59] you the comforter
[1:03:01] right
[1:03:03] because just like air conditioning is a
[1:03:06] comfort on a hot day
[1:03:09] that Holy Ghost comforter is a comfort
[1:03:12] to The Heirs that are being conditioned
[1:03:14] to receive the promise of God
[1:03:17] um I'm actually in in the uh in the
[1:03:21] hopefully this is okay but I'm in the um
[1:03:24] I don't want to say mood but I I feel
[1:03:26] like singing something that that is fast
[1:03:28] and uplifting so earlier today we we
[1:03:32] sang he brought me out
[1:03:34] and I'd like to sing that again because
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:38] um
[1:03:39] he brought us out Saints and then not
[1:03:42] only did did he bring us out but he
[1:03:43] didn't just leave us there then he
[1:03:44] brought us in
[1:03:45] and he he shared something with us and
[1:03:48] he shared promises with us and he took
[1:03:49] us to a different place
[1:03:51] and he's taking us to a different place
[1:03:53] because he's shared those things with us
[1:03:54] and saints of God your heirs according
[1:03:57] to the promise
[1:03:58] amen your Heirs of Christ according to
[1:04:01] his promise
[1:04:03] according to his promise he'll fulfill
[1:04:04] it
[1:04:06] made an unconditional Covenant with
[1:04:08] Abraham
[1:04:09] Abraham I'm going to do this
[1:04:11] guess what he did with the bride of
[1:04:13] Christ same exact thing I'm gonna have a
[1:04:15] bride
[1:04:17] gonna absolutely have it
[1:04:19] do you have to worry about it no
[1:04:21] you can rest
[1:04:23] in him
[1:04:25] we can rest in him this morning I don't
[1:04:27] know if you can bring up the words that
[1:04:28] he brought me out but if it's okay we're
[1:04:29] going to sing a few
