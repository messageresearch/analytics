[0:00] after these things Jesus showed himself
[0:01] again to the disciples at the Sea of
[0:04] Tiberius that's the Sea of Galilee and
[0:06] different names are given for it in
[0:09] history and even in the scripture and on
[0:11] this wise showed him he himself so this
[0:13] is a story of the third time he appears
[0:15] to the disciples after his resurrection
[0:18] there were together Simon Peter and
[0:20] Thomas called didymus and Nathanael of
[0:23] Canaan Galilee and the sons of Zebedee
[0:26] and two other of his disciples Simon
[0:28] Peter saith unto them I go efficient
[0:31] amen I like that I don't like the next
[0:34] part though because this scripture is
[0:35] fulfilled this day this scripture is
[0:37] fulfilled just about every time I go
[0:39] fishing they send him we also go with
[0:40] thee they went forth entered into a ship
[0:43] immediately and that night they caught
[0:44] nothing
[0:46] but when the morning was now come Jesus
[0:49] stood on the shore what a beautiful
[0:51] picture when you think about Peter and
[0:53] his denial of Christ in that Twilight
[0:56] hour uh and where that was crowing
[0:59] and now in a noon morning a new Dawning
[1:01] uh here Christ is appearing to them once
[1:04] again and he's but the disciples knew
[1:06] not that it was Jesus then Jesus saith
[1:08] unto them children have you any meat
[1:10] they answered him no
[1:12] and he said to them cast the net on the
[1:14] right side of the ship and ye shall find
[1:17] they cast therefore and now they were
[1:20] not able to draw it for the multitude of
[1:22] fishes therefore that disciple whom
[1:24] Jesus loved saith unto Peter okay John
[1:27] saith unto Peter it is the Lord now when
[1:30] Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord
[1:32] he Gert his Fisher's coat unto him for
[1:34] he was naked and did cast himself into
[1:37] the sea and the other disciples came in
[1:40] a little ship for they were not far from
[1:41] land but as it were 200 cubits dragging
[1:44] the net with fishes as soon then as they
[1:47] were come to the land they saw a fire of
[1:49] coals there and fish lay there on and
[1:51] bread
[1:52] and Jesus saith unto them bring of the
[1:54] fish which you have now caught so now
[1:55] they're participating in it Simon Peter
[1:58] went up and Drew the net to the land
[1:59] full of great fishes and 153 and for all
[2:03] there were so many yet was not the net
[2:06] broken and Jesus said to them come and
[2:09] dine just remember that phrase come and
[2:11] dine and none of the disciples Durst ask
[2:13] him who art thou knowing that it was the
[2:15] Lord
[2:16] Jesus then cometh and taketh bread and
[2:18] giveth him and fish likewise this is now
[2:21] the third time that Jesus showed himself
[2:23] to his disciples after that he was risen
[2:25] from the dead
[2:27] amen you can take your seats
[2:30] I have a um
[2:33] a unique sermon today and
[2:36] but John if you don't mind maybe just
[2:38] show that I have a menu prepared for you
[2:40] today and this is kind of the title
[2:42] so the title today we'll come back to it
[2:44] is red herring a rainbow trout
[2:47] and and so I put together a little bit
[2:49] of a menu just to kind of get you
[2:50] thinking about this and I in the outset
[2:54] I wanted to say that I have a very heavy
[2:56] pastoral burden that I'd like to deliver
[2:58] and I want you to make it personal but
[3:01] don't take it personal
[3:02] does that make sense make it personal
[3:05] don't take it personal because I do not
[3:06] have any person in mind but I do desire
[3:09] that each one each person would examine
[3:11] themselves their individual Focus make
[3:13] the word revelant relevant for
[3:16] themselves speaking some European there
[3:18] uh just make it relevant for where you
[3:21] are and if it seems I don't have any
[3:24] particular situation in mind so it's not
[3:26] like I'm trying to address anything I
[3:28] just have a burden and when they're when
[3:30] the burden Comes Your Eyes well this
[3:31] must mean something for the people if it
[3:33] comes this heavy and this clear then it
[3:35] must have some relevance and so come
[3:38] with your rake today and not your
[3:40] Pitchfork bring it into yourselves make
[3:42] it personal but nothing I'm saying is
[3:44] directed to anybody in particular any
[3:46] particular situation though there's
[3:47] maybe some things I could think of not
[3:49] necessarily related here but outwardly
[3:51] that the bride is facing in different
[3:53] voices and things that are in the land
[3:55] and so I'm wanting you to
[3:58] uh uh make it personal but don't take it
[4:01] personal and bear with me as I deliver
[4:02] this pastoral burden and the title if
[4:05] you need the title now it's red herring
[4:07] a rainbow trout presented you in this
[4:09] context of a menu and if you can read it
[4:12] whole pickled and smoked net caught
[4:14] Herring is the red herring or rainbow
[4:16] trout Fire Grilled fresh lying caught
[4:19] rainbow trout so those are your two
[4:21] choices uh I guess they're served
[4:23] without sauce and sides and I couldn't
[4:25] think of any spiritual desserts or
[4:26] appetizers that I wanted to mix into the
[4:28] metaphors I'm just leaving it this red
[4:30] herring a rainbow trout today and you
[4:32] can consider that and ponder it I want
[4:34] to say brother Chris I appreciated the
[4:36] the idea of ponder points because I
[4:38] heard amongst the young people there was
[4:39] this little thing where they're trying
[4:40] to count how many times I say Ponder in
[4:42] a service I was like I can go two ways
[4:44] with this I can say it so many times I
[4:46] get sick of it or I cannot say it at all
[4:48] for a couple months I'm like what
[4:49] happened and so I don't think I've said
[4:51] it at all for two or three months but
[4:53] I'm going to go ahead and work it back
[4:54] in because the concept of a Ponder point
[4:56] I thought was wonderful the way brother
[4:57] Chris put it says when you it's a point
[4:59] that you pawn it you don't maybe fully
[5:00] get it at that moment but you consider
[5:02] you keep these things and you you wonder
[5:04] about it and you kind of turn it over
[5:06] and so I think God does that often with
[5:08] the word he wants us to think about it
[5:10] he wants us to ponder it he wants us to
[5:12] absorb it and so we'll have some Ponder
[5:15] points today maybe that's my subtitle
[5:17] pondering pondering fish there's a pun
[5:20] in there
[5:22] so John chapter 21 verse 9. I want to
[5:24] read this quote of this scripture again
[5:26] and start off this will help me kind of
[5:28] get kind of get moving a little bit and
[5:30] so as the disciples came to land
[5:33] I'm dragging these nets fish are going
[5:36] to be pulled behind them they come to
[5:37] land it says there's Jesus in the
[5:39] morning time and they saw a fire of
[5:42] coals there so Jesus had made a fire and
[5:44] on the fire already fish that had they
[5:47] had not caught but fish was already been
[5:49] cooked fish laid there on in bread and
[5:51] so Jesus is cooking fish for them and
[5:53] it's already prepared and he says to
[5:54] them come and dine come and eat I've
[5:56] prepared fish I have bread I've made you
[5:58] I've made you this meal come and eat and
[6:01] so fish would have been a staple food it
[6:03] still is a staple food in many different
[6:05] countries and regions it was a staple
[6:07] food at the time in this ancient times
[6:09] very important commodity and Industry in
[6:12] the time so there's a lot of ways that
[6:14] you see fish come up in the Old
[6:15] Testament New Testament in my research I
[6:18] found that there's no particular species
[6:19] or fish that's given a name but you see
[6:22] it mentioned quite often and the subject
[6:24] of fish and fishing occurs frequently in
[6:27] Christ's own Ministry when we see him
[6:29] calling the disciples he called them
[6:30] from their Nets as a matter of fact at
[6:32] least 7 seven of twelve disciples are
[6:34] actually fishermen and he spoke from
[6:37] fishing boats he traveled in fishing
[6:39] boats he fed the multitudes twice
[6:41] thousands of people multiplying fish and
[6:43] bread and even when attacks was due and
[6:46] he found he said go and I caught a fish
[6:48] and the tax tribute was found in a
[6:50] fish's mouth and so the fish is you know
[6:53] finds itself quite often there's some
[6:55] that have done very deep studies on the
[6:57] particular number of 153 and some say
[7:00] that's how many species of fish were
[7:02] known at the time and they use uh you
[7:05] know mathematics a lot of different
[7:06] things to bring in a lot of kind of neat
[7:09] types and shadows with respect to even
[7:10] the numbers and the fish itself but with
[7:13] with this particular instance here's
[7:15] Christ cooking fish and the very first
[7:17] one of the first at the very beginning
[7:19] of his ministry one of his miracles in
[7:21] Luke chapter five was a cast your net
[7:23] and bringing in the a huge catch for
[7:26] Peter and so it began with this miracle
[7:28] at the beginning there was a miracle of
[7:29] the fish and then here in John chapter
[7:31] 21 in his third appearance to the
[7:33] disciples after his resurrection it
[7:34] happens again and now he's cooking this
[7:37] fish upon the fire
[7:39] and have you heard of Saint Peter's fish
[7:41] it's tilapia and I think has a special
[7:44] place in the catholic's heart and
[7:47] there's a uh and for this tilapia they
[7:50] say this is probably what they would
[7:51] have caught in the Sea of Galilee at the
[7:53] time so some think the fish Peter was
[7:55] catching and even the fish that maybe
[7:56] Jesus Was preparing was this tilapia I
[8:01] don't know that there's any rainbow
[8:02] trout in the Sea of Galilee this is not
[8:05] listed as a species but there's there's
[8:06] herring in the Sea of Galilee and so my
[8:09] title is red herring a rainbow trout
[8:13] it's a choice between two fishes and one
[8:15] is maybe just the species in general the
[8:17] rainbow trout but then the red herring
[8:19] is actually cooked Herring and we'll
[8:20] touch on that here in a moment and if
[8:22] you're not thinking already a lot and
[8:24] mulling over this Ponder point of red
[8:26] herring a rainbow trout you may be
[8:28] getting hungry but lunch is coming
[8:30] I want to start with the statement from
[8:31] the sermon what is a vision and you
[8:34] remember the vision we call it the tent
[8:36] Vision the third pull vision and it was
[8:39] this uh this Vision that has these three
[8:42] different parts to it and unfolds one to
[8:44] the next the one that gets the the most
[8:46] attention is the one of the
[8:47] cathedral-like tent and that little room
[8:49] had been studied on that lately it's
[8:51] done a lot of different thoughts on that
[8:53] little room and some different things
[8:54] God's been quickening to me but I want
[8:57] to read this lengthy statement from what
[8:58] is a vision because brother Ram's
[9:00] talking about it's all about this third
[9:02] pool and he's referred and you take from
[9:05] other instances where he gives each one
[9:07] of these parts of the lacing the shoe
[9:09] the fishing and the tent
[9:11] he's just told the story about lacing
[9:13] the little baby booty he says are you
[9:15] threatening the wrong end he says and as
[9:17] I started to reach down I was gone again
[9:19] and then when I came to I was standing
[9:21] by the side of a beautiful Lake
[9:22] something like your Lake out here in the
[9:24] summertime and he's in Chicago when it's
[9:26] real pretty and green and there were
[9:28] fishermen all around the lake and they
[9:30] were fishing but they were catching
[9:32] small fishes and I looked out in the
[9:34] lake and those great beautiful rainbow
[9:37] trout out there so it's looking at these
[9:39] beautiful big rainbow trout and I said I
[9:41] know this is a vision but I can't
[9:43] understand those trout but I said you
[9:45] know I believe right down in my heart I
[9:47] can catch those so I picked up the
[9:49] string but instead of it being a string
[9:51] it was a fishing pole and just then the
[9:54] one behind me said now I'll teach you to
[9:56] fish how to catch those and he said tie
[9:59] on the lure and I snapped The Lure on he
[10:02] said now throw it way out government
[10:05] says now listen close way out into the
[10:07] deep
[10:08] he said when you do now let the lure
[10:10] sink down first
[10:12] and then said pull it slow now that's
[10:15] really Fisherman's technique he said
[10:16] then when you do now you'll feel some
[10:18] nibbles at it but don't tell nobody what
[10:20] you're doing keep it to yourself and
[10:23] said then you'll feel it nibble again
[10:24] and just pull a little bit but not too
[10:27] hard and you realize the continuity of
[10:29] some other parts of the vision it won't
[10:31] be a public show and you've tried to you
[10:33] can't teach Pentecostal babies
[10:34] Supernatural things is kind of the
[10:36] emphasis in that first stage of the the
[10:39] vision I heard a minister say one time
[10:41] and there's this real this will make you
[10:44] think he said if you could teach it if
[10:47] you can teach it to a Pentecostal baby
[10:48] it's not Supernatural and I thought
[10:52] okay that'll make you think he says you
[10:55] can't teach uh Pentecostal baby
[10:56] Supernatural things and so there's kind
[10:59] of that theme where don't tell anybody
[11:01] keep it a secret we know he's building
[11:02] on that idea of the third pull he said
[11:04] and then it'll pull it away from the
[11:06] little fish and when they scatter
[11:07] that'll attract the attention of the big
[11:09] fish and they'll grab it so there's
[11:11] something being represented in this
[11:13] attraction or this pull and he says and
[11:16] and said that's the way you'll catch it
[11:18] said then when they bite on the third
[11:20] time set your hook for the catch
[11:23] and I believe it's in another place
[11:25] where William says the third poll I
[11:26] think it's in the seventh seal he says
[11:27] the third pool will get the big fish so
[11:29] when he when he talks about this rainbow
[11:31] trout and this is how I'm using the
[11:33] rainbow trout as a symbol of something
[11:34] to refer to something I'm using it to
[11:36] refer to the third poll and what it
[11:38] means to you personally and whether you
[11:40] want to say you're the you're the
[11:42] rainbow trout that was caught by that
[11:43] third pool or has some sort of symbolism
[11:45] within the word of God itself the third
[11:48] pull is what gets those great beautiful
[11:50] rainbow trout out there brother man when
[11:52] he tells the vision he talks about how
[11:54] he jerked it too soon he looked like the
[11:56] lure came out of the water and he did
[11:58] catch something but it just skinned Over
[12:00] The Lure and he didn't really catch the
[12:01] fish again he was very discouraged
[12:03] that's when he's taken to the cathedral
[12:04] and God's trying to show him something
[12:06] very particular about the third pull but
[12:08] for me I'm wanting to look at this when
[12:10] I say rainbow trout when I when I give
[12:12] you the choice red hair and a rainbow
[12:13] trout I'm using rainbow trout as just a
[12:16] phrase to refer to the third pull and
[12:18] all it means to you and your
[12:20] relationship to it brother Adam and
[12:21] anointed ones at the end time he said
[12:23] the third pull the opener the word the
[12:25] Mysteries revealed the third pull was
[12:28] the opening of The Seven Seals to reveal
[12:30] the hidden truth that's been sealed in
[12:32] the word so the third pull is the
[12:35] opening of the word the third poll is
[12:37] the open of the Seven Seals brother
[12:38] Bradham not speaking even in future
[12:41] tense but present tense even past tense
[12:43] that the third pull is at hand it is the
[12:45] open of the word it reveals Mysteries
[12:48] that were sealed in the word so when I
[12:50] say rainbow trout think of the third
[12:51] pool think of the opening of the word
[12:54] now for red herring you say you're going
[12:56] out of order on your title it was
[12:58] necessary just establish that now with
[13:00] respect to red herring how many have
[13:02] heard of a herring
[13:04] Herring is a type of fish it's a small
[13:06] fish found in large schools it looks
[13:08] like an anchovy but a little bit larger
[13:10] and a red herring there's no species or
[13:13] type of fish called red herring but red
[13:14] herring is a dried smoke Herring that
[13:17] kind of turns reddish brown when it's
[13:18] cured through the smoking process it's
[13:20] very fishy very smelly a very pungent
[13:24] smelling I don't know why I said fishy
[13:26] like Donald Trump but it is it's a fishy
[13:28] smell and a very fishy
[13:31] people tell me
[13:33] uh but it's a pungent fish it's very
[13:36] fishy and the concept of red herring the
[13:39] phrase of red herring it is a fish that
[13:41] you eat and they can go back as far as
[13:42] 1420s to find a reference to red herring
[13:46] and Herring that had been cooked this
[13:47] particular process I had pictures to
[13:49] show I don't know how I didn't make into
[13:50] the slideshow I realized this morning I
[13:51] left all my beautiful pictures of smoked
[13:54] herring in the folder and I apologize
[13:57] for that we can we can do a slideshow
[13:59] later we could just do an afternoon
[14:00] session on fish
[14:02] but in in 1686 there was a weekly
[14:05] periodical it's called a weekly
[14:07] political register excuse me actually it
[14:10] was in 1686 in a British magazine uh and
[14:13] I think it was a gentleman's magazine
[14:15] that suggested that to train horses to
[14:18] follow hounds you could use uh a dead
[14:22] animal dead fox or dead cat or something
[14:24] like that that the hounds would Chase
[14:25] and you're going to teach the horses to
[14:27] follow the hounds and this particular
[14:30] writer said and if there's no cat
[14:31] available or dead dead Hound available
[14:33] then a red herring will suffice I think
[14:35] it was kind of used jokingly like hey
[14:36] this fish stinks it smells
[14:39] um so if you can't find a dead animal
[14:40] use a red herring the hounds will chase
[14:42] it and you can train your horses uh but
[14:45] a couple hundred years later almost in
[14:46] 1807 there was a political weekly
[14:48] political magazine that used the term
[14:51] red herring how many have heard the
[14:52] phrase red herring before
[14:54] all of you should have raised your hand
[14:55] because I've used it at least a dozen
[14:56] times already this morning
[14:58] I but so the red herring uh was used in
[15:02] this particular story and the gentleman
[15:04] writing it William Corbett I believe is
[15:05] his name he was telling the story of a
[15:07] boy who used a red herring as a decoy uh
[15:10] to distract hounds who are trying to
[15:12] chase a fox so he's a young boy who had
[15:13] a heart for foxes the hounds were
[15:15] chasing it and he used a red herring to
[15:17] kind of distract him and draw them off
[15:19] the trail these hounds are fox hounds
[15:21] they want to catch a fox and he used
[15:23] this smelly fish to kind of detour him
[15:25] and turn them away and so this writer
[15:28] used the red this story as a metaphor of
[15:30] how the present he used it to criticize
[15:33] the Press because they'd kind of
[15:34] followed some misleading information
[15:36] about Napoleon's the defeat of Napoleon
[15:39] and the Press was enamored with it and
[15:41] it was getting all this attention and it
[15:43] kind of distracted them and this
[15:45] particular writer said it distracted
[15:46] them from important domestic matters and
[15:49] this is the phrase he used it was a mere
[15:51] transitory effect of the political red
[15:53] herring for on the Saturday the scent
[15:55] became as cold as a stone so they were
[15:57] chasing after something they were drawn
[15:59] after the trail they made something very
[16:00] Sensational and they were distracted by
[16:03] something and that's how this phrase
[16:05] begins to enter into our vernacular and
[16:07] our in our language today a red herring
[16:10] was something that distracts or Drew
[16:13] someone's attention away so when I use
[16:15] the phrase red herring I'm not actually
[16:17] talking about a smoked fish but using it
[16:20] in this sense of this metaphor that a
[16:23] red herring is something that distracts
[16:25] from the correct course or from the
[16:27] proper context of something therefore a
[16:29] red herring is something that is
[16:31] misleading and but John if you I think
[16:33] that if you pop this definition up there
[16:35] something that misleads or distracts
[16:37] from a relevant or important question
[16:40] that's what a red herring is it's
[16:41] something that distracts you from what
[16:42] is relevant is something that distracts
[16:44] from what is uh what the important
[16:46] question now a red herring can be used
[16:49] in literature where someone who's
[16:51] writing something maybe it's a mystery
[16:53] novel or something that's building some
[16:54] suspense and so it could be used as a
[16:57] literary device where you're going to
[16:58] lead the reader or the audience to uh
[17:01] towards a particular conclusion so I
[17:02] know it was the butler in the pantry
[17:04] with the Candlestick I just know it it's
[17:06] all signs point to that but what the
[17:09] what the writer has done is kind of
[17:11] signal some things to kind of give you
[17:13] this scent oh I think this is what it is
[17:15] and it leads you to the wrong conclusion
[17:17] it's a literary device meant to mislead
[17:20] you or cause you to assume things or
[17:22] make the wrong conclusion but it's also
[17:24] referred to as what is called a maybe a
[17:25] logical fallacy in debate or philosophy
[17:28] and it's a red herring can be something
[17:32] that seems plausible very believable
[17:34] oftentimes it's Sensational but
[17:37] ultimately it's irrelevant and used it's
[17:39] used to divert your the attention away
[17:42] from something
[17:44] um that is uh from the relevant question
[17:48] my my children could come to me and they
[17:51] could say you know Dad when am I going
[17:54] to get a cell phone and I can say well
[17:55] when I was your age we didn't have cell
[17:57] phones and that would be a red herring
[18:00] right because I don't actually answer
[18:02] the question of when am I going to get a
[18:04] cell phone and I kind of bring up
[18:05] something that's my own personal
[18:06] experience it's kind of like wow okay
[18:08] when you when your age you didn't have a
[18:10] cell phone and you couldn't get a cell
[18:13] phone and the question wasn't relevant
[18:14] then but now what about today
[18:16] Jack wants to know can you have a cell
[18:18] phone today and we don't and I don't
[18:21] have an answer for that so I said when I
[18:22] was your age I didn't even know what a
[18:23] cell phone was
[18:24] he hasn't asked but I don't want to
[18:27] mention Elliot today so I wasn't going
[18:29] to use him as an example
[18:32] but this there's a lot of different
[18:34] examples kind of of this red herring it
[18:36] can be used in very serious debates
[18:38] debates on gun control and everyone's
[18:40] always pointing fingers oh that's a you
[18:42] know it's a logical fallacy this is a
[18:43] red herring but it can be true where
[18:45] somebody says well on the subject of gun
[18:47] control and you can change it to
[18:49] something else and say well let's talk
[18:50] about cars they kill more people than
[18:52] guns do and what happens is it distracts
[18:55] from the real issue of discussing well
[18:57] maybe there's some points that can be
[18:59] made here let's wrestle with the real
[19:00] meat that's in front of us the real
[19:01] issue that's in front of us and so a red
[19:05] herring misleads you from what is
[19:07] important it distracts from the real
[19:09] question that's at hand and it can be
[19:11] intentional often it's unintentional but
[19:15] it's uh and it's it's not necessary that
[19:17] doesn't necessarily need to be the
[19:18] intent to mislead but what it does do is
[19:20] it does mislead
[19:22] and a red herring Paints the wrong
[19:23] picture
[19:25] kind of gives a person the wrong
[19:26] impression it you end up placing the
[19:28] wrong kind of emphasis and um there's a
[19:30] relevant question there's something
[19:31] important there's something happening
[19:33] and the red herring gets everyone to
[19:35] look away and be like but what about
[19:36] this stinky fish right it's something
[19:39] that's used to mislead and distract and
[19:41] it diverts our attention away from the
[19:43] real issue by focusing on something
[19:45] maybe Sensational plausible but in the
[19:47] end it's irrelevant and it's only on the
[19:49] surface does it seem to be connected
[19:51] so when I asked the question uh or
[19:54] that's not a question when I pose red
[19:56] herring or rainbow trout what I'm asking
[19:59] and what I'm proposing and what we're
[20:01] looking at in this Choice even as it's
[20:02] presented as a menu item are you
[20:04] distracted are you focused on the main
[20:06] thing
[20:08] what is it you're eating on you're
[20:10] feeding on what is it you're focused on
[20:12] what is it you're thinking about what it
[20:13] is you're what is it that you're
[20:15] pondering
[20:16] um are you are is it a red herring or is
[20:18] it the main course is it the main thing
[20:20] is it the rainbow trout are we focused
[20:22] on the red herrings associated with the
[20:24] message and when we talk about red
[20:26] herring arguments I find most arguments
[20:28] against Christ are usually red hair in
[20:30] arguments they don't want to discuss the
[20:32] actual subject matter or what's being
[20:34] proposed doctrinally or what's being
[20:36] taught it's all red herring arguments to
[20:38] get you off arguing about things that
[20:41] seem to be related but they're really
[20:42] not they're not relevant and they're
[20:44] usually Sensational and it's all meant
[20:46] to get you off the trail to get you off
[20:49] the right path and to distract you so
[20:51] the question is am I caught up am I
[20:54] distracted by red herrings or am I
[20:57] looking at the rainbow trout
[20:59] brother random in the sermon what is the
[21:01] attraction
[21:02] on the mount he says so I've Got My Mind
[21:04] Set On this message
[21:07] that's that third pull and it's the one
[21:09] that I must be loyal and reverent to
[21:11] that was the third pool is the
[21:14] attraction it is that that great
[21:16] beautiful associate with that great
[21:17] beautiful rainbow trout that's that's
[21:19] what we're interested in that's what
[21:21] we're Desiring to feed on and to find
[21:24] and to explore and to understand better
[21:26] is the third pull and and you can't take
[21:29] you can't take that to extreme and say
[21:31] well then if the third pool began in
[21:33] 1963 then what we're interested in is
[21:35] 63-65 and is it pre-63 or post 63 listen
[21:40] what we have from 47 to 63 is the
[21:43] foundation upon which that is built
[21:45] therefore it's necessary to be built up
[21:48] in that too you can't just try to cold
[21:50] turkey walk into this 1963 and digest it
[21:53] all and get it figured out there's a
[21:55] Ministry a brother Branham to the
[21:57] laodicean church age there was a
[21:59] correction to the Pentecostal church and
[22:01] there was a tremendous amount of
[22:02] restoring that his ministry had to do to
[22:04] bring back that some of the Pentecostal
[22:06] truths that been lost and then in 1963
[22:09] you have an opening up of something that
[22:12] he says this is beyond Pentecost but you
[22:14] can't you can't get Beyond unless you
[22:16] get two
[22:18] so when he says this is something I've
[22:20] got to set my mind on that we want to be
[22:22] sure that we're walking in the correct
[22:23] Paces of the message of the hour and
[22:26] it's this third pulley says that that's
[22:28] what he must be loyal and reverent to
[22:30] and that's what we want to watch
[22:33] that's what we want to have our
[22:34] attention on is the message and and the
[22:37] the message to brother Brown I mean even
[22:39] that Vision that three-part Vision in
[22:41] this particular instance of the fishing
[22:43] I believe the one speaking to him said
[22:45] don't get your line tangled up in these
[22:47] kinds of times
[22:49] don't get your don't get a uh uh the
[22:52] bird's nest when you're casting don't
[22:54] get the backlash you don't want to get
[22:55] your line Tangled Up in times like this
[22:57] this is one you want to be sure that
[22:59] you're setting the hook when you're
[23:00] catching the fish don't get your line
[23:02] Tangled Up in times like this so be
[23:04] paying attention
[23:06] follow instruction be mindful of what
[23:08] you're doing he's saying that's what we
[23:10] want to get I'll say this as he says
[23:12] that's what he's got his mind on that's
[23:14] what he told us to watch that's what we
[23:16] want to be doing
[23:18] and so realize there's a rainbow trout
[23:20] that we're after there's a truth that
[23:21] we're after there's something that we
[23:23] need to be focused on and the devil
[23:25] would want us to start following after
[23:26] all these red herring if you wanted to
[23:29] build it a lot on in terms of the
[23:31] fission analogy and the these great fish
[23:34] that they would have caught in John
[23:35] chapter 21 it may have been very well
[23:37] may have been tilapia but they weren't
[23:40] after the schools of these little
[23:41] anchovies these little Bait fish the
[23:43] little Herring what God wanted to catch
[23:45] was these great big fish 153 fish that
[23:47] filled up these nets and you could try
[23:50] to chase Bait fish all you want and get
[23:52] the anchovies and talk about how
[23:54] important they are and how it's it
[23:56] Thrive the ecosystem thrives because of
[23:58] it and and people feed on it not saying
[24:00] there's not any benefits to the red the
[24:02] hair in itself so I hope not to offend
[24:05] anybody whose favorite fish is a herring
[24:08] but the the idea that what I'm trying to
[24:11] present to you is something that would
[24:12] draw your attention away like oh my you
[24:16] ever walk up to a body of water in the
[24:17] evening you see these little these
[24:19] little drops and blops and stuff you're
[24:21] like oh my goodness there's fish in
[24:22] there this is amazing let's go after it
[24:23] well what you're seeing is like the
[24:25] smallest little thing in the water
[24:28] either nipping at insects or insects
[24:30] following it's like try all you want
[24:31] throw in top water all sorts of lures
[24:33] you're fishing the wrong thing
[24:36] right you're distracted by the the
[24:38] things you can see in the blips upon the
[24:40] water and it's in times like this we
[24:42] want to find the Deep things and we want
[24:44] to get into the real heart of the
[24:45] message of the hour and brother Branham
[24:47] says in the sermon have not I sent thee
[24:49] he says in the seed now in this evil day
[24:51] that we live in when unbelievers and
[24:53] scientists and so forth so if it's
[24:55] unbeliever scientists and so forth
[24:57] brings in everybody else are trying to
[24:59] cut away the very value of the word
[25:03] and that's that's what the devil wants
[25:05] to do is he wants to devalue the word
[25:08] cut away at the very value of the word
[25:10] that's where it starts I I feel very
[25:12] confident in saying this that the
[25:14] slippery slope begins whenever you begin
[25:16] to devalue the word you don't just wake
[25:19] up one morning the whole cell just
[25:20] reject it all and say there's nothing to
[25:21] it something begins to chip away at the
[25:24] value of the word and it gets the point
[25:25] where you don't respect it anymore you
[25:27] don't value it anymore therefore it's
[25:29] really easy just to let it be and walk
[25:30] away from it and so you recognize that
[25:33] Satan unbelievers scientists the world
[25:35] and society today isn't necessarily
[25:38] going to try to come right out and say
[25:39] reject it all there's nothing to it but
[25:41] everything's working to ultimately
[25:44] devalue the word of God and cut away
[25:47] it's worth for you
[25:49] and so we do not want the re the message
[25:51] of the hour to be reduced uh to an
[25:55] anchovy reduced to a red herring reduced
[25:57] to something that has very little or no
[25:59] value or benefit to us we want to
[26:01] recognize it as something as prized and
[26:03] something that's very valuable
[26:05] unbelievers and scientists are trying to
[26:07] cut away the very value of the word
[26:10] in second Corinthians chapter 11 verse 3
[26:13] Paul writing this about the church at
[26:16] Corinth I Fearless by any means as the
[26:18] serpent beguiled Eve through his
[26:20] subtlety so your mind should be
[26:22] corrupted from the Simplicity that is in
[26:24] Christ I guess I'll say this that right
[26:27] now I think what I want to do is just
[26:28] build the idea of distractions or red
[26:30] herrings or things that mislead in the
[26:33] scripture
[26:34] so we could kind of place that idea of
[26:36] what Iran Herring is and how it's used
[26:37] by the devil how it's trying to cut away
[26:39] the very value of the word Paul says he
[26:42] as the serpent beguiled Eve as he
[26:44] deceived her through his subtlety that
[26:46] that phrase of subtlety is important to
[26:49] remember about his conduct he says I
[26:50] fear that as Eve was corrupted so your
[26:53] mind should be corrupted from what the
[26:55] Simplicity that is in Christ
[26:58] so what Satan had done is he had defiled
[27:00] their singleness of mind or he he was
[27:02] afraid that they would defile their
[27:04] singleness of mine that is the the woman
[27:06] was very living in a an Eden a perfect
[27:08] Eden with everything laid out for every
[27:10] seed bringing forth of its kind
[27:11] Perfection of perfection all around her
[27:14] all she had to do is obey the lord the
[27:16] devil slipped in and through it suddenly
[27:18] he complicated things
[27:20] uh and he suggested that kind of
[27:22] diversionary tactic suggested well maybe
[27:24] it's not all that it appears to be and
[27:26] maybe there's more to it and so Satan uh
[27:29] defiled her singleness of mine Paul was
[27:32] afraid that their their Simplicity and
[27:34] the singleness of Mind towards Christ
[27:35] and his word uh would be defiled just as
[27:38] the serpent diverted her attention to
[27:40] somebody else distracted Eve uh with
[27:43] with uh with a pretense with something
[27:45] well could it be and something
[27:47] misleading it's a red herring is exactly
[27:50] what it was Paul's saying I'm worried
[27:52] that you'll also be corrupted
[27:54] brother Graham says in God's power to
[27:56] transform in the same pattern he
[27:57] deceived Eve he has also deceived the
[27:59] church which there Eve was a type of the
[28:02] church notice what it did through the
[28:04] wandering the wandering for knowledge
[28:06] she slips across the line between right
[28:09] and wrong by listening to Satan's
[28:12] perversion or deformity of the original
[28:14] word of God
[28:16] this is always Satan's tactic to confuse
[28:18] the word to take one of the original and
[28:21] kind of make it unclear kind of suggest
[28:24] well maybe this this or maybe it's that
[28:26] this is always his tactic and so he
[28:29] comes in and causes it to wander after
[28:31] something well let me follow this Trail
[28:33] think about how the red herring was
[28:35] suggested to be used to cause dogs to
[28:38] chase after it's sent to train to train
[28:40] horses or this little boy is trying to
[28:42] keep the dogs from following after the
[28:43] fox he uses a the scent of a red herring
[28:46] what does it what is it expressing to us
[28:48] this idea that somebody you should be
[28:51] following something and all of a sudden
[28:53] you pick up another scent and you're
[28:55] chasing that scent trying to find it and
[28:58] just as it was written written in that
[28:59] political magazine by Saturday the scent
[29:01] is gone
[29:03] can we just be honest with one another
[29:05] let's go back well let's just maybe
[29:08] let's not but say we did but let's just
[29:10] think about it for a moment go back and
[29:12] look at your text messages over the last
[29:14] few years and find all the prophets
[29:16] doomedaying about the economy about
[29:18] America soldiers in the streets no bread
[29:21] upon the shelves and think about how so
[29:24] many people have been telling you over
[29:26] and over and over again you better
[29:27] stockpile this you better do that you
[29:29] better do this and how often it's
[29:31] completely gone and they don't even
[29:32] remember saying it anymore right like oh
[29:34] I never told you need to do that
[29:39] my phone was hacked right
[29:41] and what when we look back when we think
[29:43] about what it was in the end
[29:46] it's all a red herring
[29:48] because something changes the fear is
[29:50] gone oh it's this it's that I mean I'm
[29:52] not saying I'm not necessarily weighing
[29:54] in on it but I I if some of the
[29:56] discussions I've been a part of when
[29:57] when Russia invaded Ukraine it was like
[29:59] this is it this is the end the Great
[30:01] Mighty Russia is going to start World
[30:02] War III and it's all going to be over
[30:04] this great Juggernaut of Communism is
[30:07] exactly what we thought was going to
[30:08] happen here they come and now what's
[30:10] happening
[30:12] all right everyone's prophesying Doom
[30:14] this is the end this is the end this is
[30:15] the end and what it what was it I think
[30:17] at that point at least this point was it
[30:19] a red herring
[30:20] because what do we start trying to do
[30:22] reinterpret the message just run a
[30:24] search on communism in Russia and try to
[30:26] figure it all out and place it with
[30:27] dates and blood moons and covet and
[30:29] everything and try to figure it all out
[30:30] and instead of really just getting to
[30:32] the heart of the message that brings
[30:34] rapturing Faith we're trying to read the
[30:36] Tea Leaves of of modern events
[30:41] and it's a distraction
[30:45] and so when Eve was deceived she
[30:48] specifically says the serpent beguiled
[30:50] me
[30:51] I was deceived I was tricked and so when
[30:55] when Paul says I'm afraid that just as
[30:57] the serpent beguiled even she confessed
[30:59] to being beguiled deceived and misled
[31:00] Paul says through his subtlety he's very
[31:03] shrewd he's crafty it means Sly or
[31:06] sensible Prudence so there's a wisdom to
[31:08] what he's trying to say and the devil if
[31:10] he could just always present himself red
[31:13] with horns and a pitchfork we could be
[31:15] like wait a minute
[31:17] I know what you're about to do and it's
[31:19] not gonna work right but that's not how
[31:21] he presents himself presents himself as
[31:23] an angel of Light and he says something
[31:25] and you're kind of like
[31:26] okay all right let's think about that
[31:29] that's that's plausible that's
[31:30] Sensational that's really that's getting
[31:32] my political Gander up you know that's
[31:34] uh this is really good to listen to and
[31:36] if you find I think it's you find it in
[31:39] the Christian world today that it's
[31:41] getting so uh sensationalized to where
[31:44] they're trying to raise up an idea of
[31:45] Christianity and this this Christian
[31:48] identity that Christians are ones that
[31:50] are that are poised to overthrow the
[31:52] government and if you think I'm just
[31:54] making it up I'll play you sermons
[31:56] I play sermons of fundamental
[31:58] conservative Bible thumping and even no
[32:01] message believers who attended the
[32:02] January 6th Insurrection or whatever you
[32:04] want to call it and and there's people
[32:07] that are all caught up in this fervor
[32:08] and using the word of God to justify it
[32:10] and what is it it's a red herring
[32:13] it's a distraction
[32:16] I say well is there nothing to this is
[32:18] there nothing well no it it can be very
[32:21] very plausible but what are we told to
[32:22] look at as message believers
[32:24] and Paul says in second Corinthians
[32:26] chapter 2 verse 11 on the subject of
[32:28] forgiveness but yet this principle
[32:30] stands on its own lest Satan should get
[32:32] an advantage of us for we are not
[32:33] ignorant of his devices so Paul
[32:36] instructs the church to do something in
[32:38] light of the fact that Satan wants to
[32:40] take advantage of us through his devices
[32:43] to take advantage means to defraud you
[32:45] or Swindle you
[32:46] I'm after the I'm after the third pull
[32:48] and after the fresh kill of the word of
[32:50] God I want the message of the hour I
[32:51] want rapturing faith and what does he do
[32:53] he uses a little bit of a red herring to
[32:55] defraud you or Swim Oh I thought this
[32:57] would bring this Rapture I thought this
[32:58] would bring the satisfaction I thought
[33:00] this was going to be the answer for my
[33:01] family and he swindles us through his
[33:03] devices it's a plan or a scheme
[33:06] Satan uses tactics these logical
[33:08] fallacies he uses ad hominems and Straw
[33:11] Men and all sorts of other logical
[33:13] fallacies and arguments to get us to
[33:15] distract us from the truth of the word
[33:18] of God
[33:20] and I'd say that these red herrings when
[33:22] it comes to the message of the hour when
[33:24] it comes to our belief as a Christian
[33:26] and what we pursue and what matters and
[33:28] what has the preeminence are more common
[33:30] than we think
[33:32] just how often our faith which should be
[33:34] centered directly on the word of God
[33:36] just keeps getting misdirected just a
[33:37] little bit
[33:38] can we just all confess and I'm
[33:40] concluding myself just how we wobble a
[33:42] little bit right like this is the path
[33:44] this is the way walkie in it and what
[33:46] happens we start going uh
[33:48] but thank God there's a voice that's
[33:50] behind us that says get back in line
[33:52] thank you thank you and then and then
[33:55] you over correct a little bit and say no
[33:56] walk this one yeah thank you thank you
[33:59] and maybe we look back maybe maybe by
[34:01] God's grace it's getting tighter it's
[34:04] getting tighter it's getting tighter I
[34:06] just want to stay I want to be I'm I'm
[34:07] rising up and what is it that causes the
[34:09] bride and the preview of the Bride what
[34:11] does it cause her to get out of Step do
[34:12] you remember anybody want to tell me
[34:15] she had her eyes on the church that's
[34:17] descending Into Darkness laodicea the
[34:19] laodicean church and the laodicean
[34:21] church age is descending Into Darkness
[34:24] but the bride and her age is stepping up
[34:26] higher walking to a different music
[34:28] walking to a different beat and she's
[34:30] coming on the scene again she's rising
[34:32] up and she's marching to the the beat of
[34:34] the word of God and the when she gets
[34:37] out of step is when she takes her eyes
[34:39] off the word of God that's causing her
[34:41] to raise and begins to look at the other
[34:43] church and what it's doing
[34:45] that's when she gets out of step and so
[34:48] we do not want Satan to take advantage
[34:50] of us through his misdirections through
[34:52] his distractions through all the
[34:53] diversionary tactics and the devices
[34:55] that he uses to hang us up
[34:58] and this could go this could go a little
[35:00] bit different direction in terms of how
[35:03] ubiquitous some things are it's always
[35:04] there it's always before us we're always
[35:06] seeing it we're always hearing it and
[35:07] the channels that he uses to do it but I
[35:09] want to stay very focused on this idea
[35:11] that there's a goal there's something we
[35:14] ought to be focused on there's something
[35:15] we're trying to accomplish and how all
[35:17] these little issues that come up we need
[35:19] to ask ourselves wait a minute how
[35:21] relevant is this
[35:23] does it even matter is it connected is
[35:25] it it at the end of the day if we
[35:28] resolve this if this is even if it's
[35:30] true because sometimes we get arguing
[35:32] about something that's like oh my
[35:33] goodness gracious it's like well if it's
[35:37] true it doesn't change anything you're
[35:39] like ah okay that was a that was a a
[35:41] waste of energy
[35:45] I hope you're able to catch what I'm
[35:47] trying to say this morning
[35:48] in John chapter 21
[35:51] we've we read the story of him appearing
[35:54] to them by the sea
[35:55] foreign
[35:57] cooked them breakfast a fish
[36:00] and bread
[36:02] and
[36:04] then Jesus is going to challenge Peter
[36:06] do you love me he says yes Lord he
[36:07] challenges him those three times I find
[36:09] it very beautiful that John wrote
[36:12] of Peter's Redemption and
[36:15] Peter was given an opportunity to affirm
[36:18] his love for every time that he denied
[36:21] Christ
[36:22] three times an item three times of
[36:24] affirmation of his love and just how it
[36:26] brought out in Peter Lord you know all
[36:28] things
[36:29] in other words you know everything
[36:31] therefore you know I love you and it's
[36:34] on the feed feed my sheep feed my lambs
[36:36] and so it's a very very beautiful story
[36:39] in this and then he speaks those
[36:40] beautiful words to Peter uh how he'll be
[36:43] able to uh carry thee where you you'll
[36:46] be carried where you could not go before
[36:48] and then it says in verse 20 then Peter
[36:50] turning about see if the disciple whom
[36:52] Jesus loved following
[36:55] okay John which also leaned on his
[36:57] breast at supper and said Lord which is
[36:59] he that betrayeth he said John is just
[37:01] you know he's humble right
[37:04] um and it says and Peter seeing John
[37:07] right seeing John and it's interesting
[37:10] this is such Peter's nature
[37:12] he sees John and he knows I mean this is
[37:15] the the Beloved Disciple This is the one
[37:17] that whom Jesus loves and John reminds
[37:20] us two times in his story you know the
[37:23] one that Jesus loved uh Peter is
[37:26] concerned about this guy
[37:29] and he said to him Jesus or saith to
[37:32] Jesus Lord and what shall this man do
[37:35] what about this guy
[37:38] um you told me what's going to happen to
[37:40] me and you kind of given me told me to
[37:42] feed the sheep feed the Lambs and you
[37:43] told me that when I was young I girded
[37:46] myself and I walked where I wanted but
[37:48] when I get old and I stretch forth my
[37:49] hands and another is going to gird me
[37:51] and and carry me where I could not go
[37:53] and it's even a reference to Peter's
[37:55] death and however Peter took it in the
[37:57] moment maybe took it as all compliments
[37:58] he called him an eagle and he thought it
[38:00] was great it was wonderful but instead
[38:02] of just basking in the glow of the word
[38:04] for him and taking what Christ said to
[38:06] him I need to feed the Lamb's feed the
[38:08] sheep and I'm gonna this is what's going
[38:09] to happen all of a sudden he's like well
[38:10] what about this guy
[38:12] can I compare what about your prophecy
[38:14] for him what have you what do you got to
[38:17] say about John because I want to compare
[38:19] notes can you say are you going to say
[38:21] the same thing about him is mine going
[38:22] to be a little bit different and he
[38:23] wants to know about John and Jesus
[38:26] answers so beautifully he says in him if
[38:29] I will that he tarry till I come what is
[38:31] that to thee
[38:33] if I let him never die till I return
[38:36] if he was if he was Immortal until I
[38:39] came back and John never tastes death
[38:40] what does it matter what this guy's lot
[38:43] is what does it matter to you what his
[38:44] cone is what does it matter to you what
[38:46] I would say to you and what's going to
[38:48] be of this guy Peter's worried about
[38:49] John's uh position or about his future
[38:52] his potential how will he serve what
[38:54] will happen to him and does he love you
[38:57] too and is he supposed to feed the sheep
[38:58] or am I am I the soul sheep feeder am I
[39:01] gonna what's gonna happen to John he's
[39:02] worried about in Jesus answer I I I'm
[39:05] going to put this maybe in a an
[39:07] interesting way but maybe even in
[39:09] Jesus's answer it's a little bit of a
[39:10] red herring right
[39:11] because he's not he's not answering the
[39:13] question
[39:14] kind of uses this this extreme and so
[39:18] this is Jesus being really really
[39:19] extreme right sometimes my kids tell me
[39:21] explanations that I don't care if you're
[39:23] 500 feet tall and owned all the gold in
[39:25] the world we told you to do this and
[39:26] it's kind of like
[39:29] it's like
[39:30] but I'm not you know I'm dirt poor and
[39:33] it's like that's the whole point it
[39:34] doesn't matter right
[39:36] but Jesus uses the same technique so I
[39:38] feel so justified in the way that I
[39:39] respond sometimes he's like what is it
[39:41] what does it matter to you if John Never
[39:42] Dies
[39:45] and what does he say follow me
[39:48] what does it matter to you as someone
[39:49] else is doing follow thou me
[39:53] this guy that guy you don't know what
[39:55] his calling is you know what his job is
[39:57] you don't know what this means for that
[39:58] person just follow me
[40:00] do what you're supposed to do I know
[40:02] that we're wired as human beings to kind
[40:04] of follow the crowd and we're kind of
[40:06] like oh there's a crowd over here
[40:08] everyone's Gathering right what I don't
[40:10] want to miss out right the fomo I don't
[40:12] wanna the fear of missing I gotta be
[40:13] there what's happening and you show them
[40:14] you're standing in the line it's like
[40:16] what's going on what's going on we're
[40:17] all getting our vaccine shot never mind
[40:19] I'm out of here right
[40:21] but we're kind of drawn to it we're like
[40:23] oh wow it's that's just the way that
[40:25] we're wired we find comfort in the crowd
[40:28] we find comfort in knowing that
[40:29] everybody else chooses that's what we
[40:31] tell ourselves when we eat at McDonald's
[40:32] what can billions be wrong
[40:37] and yet we find they can be
[40:41] but it's this Jesus is saying just
[40:43] follow me
[40:45] right isn't this at the core if you
[40:47] think about it Christ is is there the
[40:51] fish has been miraculously provided
[40:53] maybe even miraculously provided on the
[40:54] coals and Jesus is feeding them Jesus
[40:56] has just restored Peter and given him
[40:58] such a commission reaffirmed his
[41:00] position and there's such a beautiful
[41:01] moment think of how personal that time
[41:03] would have been at this Seaside with
[41:05] Jesus and his disciples to me when you
[41:07] read it and you kind of put yourself in
[41:08] that position you begin to ponder it how
[41:10] many am I at now who's keeping track uh
[41:13] three I've only said it three times uh
[41:15] ponder that three times
[41:18] Shah
[41:19] four can I get a five
[41:22] the the it's such a beautiful scene
[41:27] Christ after they fished all night and
[41:29] their Peter's a little bit disappointed
[41:30] I'm just gonna go fish and they catch
[41:32] nothing it's so such a beautiful scene
[41:33] and then all of a sudden Peter's
[41:35] distracted
[41:37] what about this guy what about this
[41:39] situation what about that what's his
[41:40] what's his testimony what's his history
[41:42] and what's his future going to be he
[41:44] says just follow me
[41:46] and then verse 23 this is when it really
[41:48] gets good
[41:49] then when this saying abroad among the
[41:52] Brethren that that disciple should not
[41:53] die
[41:55] you notice how even in that they got
[41:57] distracted
[41:59] yet Jesus said not unto him he shall not
[42:01] die but if I will that he tarry till I
[42:04] come what is that to thee so John tries
[42:07] to reaffirm the whole point that Christ
[42:09] was mentioning to begin with this
[42:11] everyone latched onto the one part
[42:14] so what was Christ intentionally being
[42:16] misleading did he say something
[42:18] Sensational so that people would fixate
[42:20] on this idea and try to dissect and
[42:22] figure out why would he say this and why
[42:24] would this happen you notice they do the
[42:25] same thing with the prophet they're like
[42:26] oh well you know he said that but he
[42:28] didn't really mean that prophets make
[42:30] mistakes because you know they start
[42:32] trying to dissect it and figure it out
[42:35] they can't just say well well all right
[42:37] instead of trying to get all bogged down
[42:39] in the semantics of it what's the
[42:41] message
[42:43] what was he trying to convey to us what
[42:45] was he trying to what was he trying to
[42:47] say and instead of trying to think and
[42:48] figure out well John's never gonna die
[42:50] what he was saying is what does it
[42:51] matter if he'd never died follow thou me
[42:54] what is that to you what is it to you
[42:56] what is that to thee was the question
[42:58] and the answer is it shouldn't matter
[43:02] follow me
[43:04] so Jesus brings Peter back he brings his
[43:07] Focus back to what matters follow thou
[43:10] me
[43:12] but it's interesting the nature of
[43:13] mankind as we see it here it's kind of
[43:15] that red herring where it's not kind of
[43:17] like
[43:18] John Terry
[43:20] maybe he never dies and they start they
[43:22] get distracted by this doctrine of
[43:24] John's immortality
[43:26] but he says what is that to thee
[43:28] and if you think about it in our lives
[43:30] think about all the questions that are
[43:31] posed on a daily basis
[43:33] all the different rumors all the
[43:35] doctrines that we've had to endure I I
[43:38] thought about this quite a bit in
[43:40] preparation for these meetings in Europe
[43:41] you have several hundred Believers that
[43:43] come
[43:44] and uh there's from you know many many
[43:47] different countries from all over there
[43:49] was like 80 or 90 russian-speaking
[43:50] Believers there uh they come from Norway
[43:53] they come from Latvia Romania they're
[43:56] Hungary they're just they're just
[43:57] gathered from all over 700 Believers and
[44:00] and I started thinking about the
[44:02] difference of when we were there and we
[44:03] ministered three years ago and how they
[44:04] hadn't had that the Family Camp in a
[44:06] couple years
[44:07] and I just begin to think of how our
[44:10] situation it changes we're never
[44:13] actually in the same context that we
[44:15] were a year ago because so much changes
[44:17] have so much evolved and so many things
[44:19] and so many things add up and accumulate
[44:21] and so we've got to be on guard more
[44:23] than we ever have before this isn't just
[44:25] the simple 1984 message culture where
[44:29] it's just uh it's just as innocent as it
[44:32] used to be and maybe some of you can
[44:33] relate more in the 90s there was a time
[44:35] when it seemed to be like a bubble and
[44:37] it seemed to be so harmonious and
[44:39] everything yeah you had your different
[44:40] ideas and you could joke with people I
[44:42] remember having a friend uh who was uh
[44:45] wanting to marry a girl whose parents
[44:46] kind of knew about the message and the
[44:47] girl was a message believer and he said
[44:49] I just don't know you know the parents
[44:51] are kind of against the message hey not
[44:52] only that you're in a cult within a cult
[44:54] and so you know you had some ideas you
[44:57] know about different ideas but there
[44:58] just seemed to be it was a different
[44:59] time it's a different season we don't
[45:01] live there anymore
[45:03] we live in a different age a different
[45:04] time different questions different ideas
[45:06] different presses and challenges and
[45:08] there's so many thoughts and ideas that
[45:10] can absolutely consume us if we'll let
[45:12] it
[45:14] so many things that consume our thought
[45:16] process that try to bog us down and we
[45:18] try to figure it out and try to the
[45:20] philosophy of certain things and the
[45:21] ethics of certain things and the truth
[45:23] of certain things and there's so much
[45:25] that we can get so distracted by and my
[45:27] question is what is that to thee
[45:31] what does that matter to you in other
[45:33] words don't get distracted don't get
[45:36] knocked off the trail keep following the
[45:39] scent and the rhythm of the word of God
[45:40] follow thou me is the cry keep your eyes
[45:44] on the third pole keep your eyes on the
[45:46] word of God don't get distracted
[45:49] brother Brown says in the greatest
[45:50] battle ever fought Matthew 24 also
[45:52] Daniel 12 said there'd be a time of
[45:53] trouble such as never like on the earth
[45:55] before and we're living in that time
[45:58] when culture and education and things
[46:00] have smothered over the word of God and
[46:03] gone into reasonings and so forth
[46:05] it's what's happening it's the Waffle
[46:08] House Effect
[46:09] smothering over scattered covered and
[46:11] smothered and dithered and everything
[46:13] else and it's what it's trying to do to
[46:16] the messenger there smother it over
[46:17] cover it up
[46:19] get it into reasonings and debates and
[46:22] suppositions and and arguments about
[46:24] certain things and there's some things
[46:26] that just it's never going to end
[46:28] there's some arguments that seem to be
[46:30] uh and I respect any man of God who
[46:33] feels the need to address certain things
[46:34] that are taking place I certainly
[46:36] believe that a a pastor in his Pulpit to
[46:38] his people as long as he even his
[46:40] heart's addressing his local people uh
[46:42] they have to be faithful to what they
[46:44] feel they need to block the people away
[46:46] from but some some of the debates that
[46:48] are raging today that I'm aware of or
[46:50] I've been brought into kind of the
[46:51] personal Fellowship on it's it becomes
[46:53] this quote and that quote and this quote
[46:56] and this quote and they said do you see
[46:58] how many quotes were stacking up and
[46:59] it's like look guys they believe all
[47:02] that too
[47:03] Yeah man they believe all of that too
[47:05] they just believe it differently than
[47:07] you
[47:09] and we get caught up in things and
[47:11] there's there's not this Smoking Gun
[47:12] you're going to be able to produce to
[47:13] silence all the Skeptics and all the
[47:15] critics that's something God does in The
[47:18] Showdown
[47:20] but there's something that is our source
[47:22] of strength that's the target of these
[47:25] things cut away the very value of the
[47:27] word smother over the word and get us
[47:30] into reasonings what draws off into this
[47:33] other mindset
[47:35] in Isaiah chapter 33 verses 5 and 6. I
[47:39] think this scripture ought to be
[47:40] something that is always ready in our
[47:42] hearts when we're in a difficult moment
[47:43] the Lord is exalted for he dwelleth on
[47:45] high he hath filled Zion with judgment
[47:47] and righteousness beautiful phrase
[47:50] and in light of that and wisdom and
[47:52] knowledge shall be the stability of thy
[47:54] times and strength of salvation for the
[47:56] fear of the Lord is his treasure if I
[47:58] could just summarize that focus on the
[48:00] word
[48:01] that's what he's saying that that wisdom
[48:04] and knowledge shall be the stability of
[48:05] thy times when there's things that are
[48:07] taking place and there's so much
[48:08] instability in politics there's so much
[48:10] instability and social things there's so
[48:12] much instability in in certain things
[48:14] that we've relied upon and there's a lot
[48:16] that is unstable right now whether it be
[48:18] economies and governments and
[48:20] institutions there's a lot of
[48:21] instability all around us and there's a
[48:23] lot of things that could drag us down or
[48:25] dominate our thought process and whether
[48:27] it be instability related to physical
[48:29] health or instability related to the
[48:31] financial markets or your job I know
[48:33] there's people whose job situations are
[48:35] changing and so there's a lot of
[48:37] instability in that you're not sure what
[48:38] the future is going to look like don't
[48:40] look for stability in in a stable coin
[48:43] Market don't look for your stability in
[48:45] the in the financial markets don't look
[48:46] for your stability and anything else
[48:48] other than wisdom and knowledge because
[48:51] that's going to be the stability of your
[48:53] moment
[48:54] and the strength of your salvation the
[48:57] fear of the Lord is your wealth it is
[48:59] your treasure it is your greatest asset
[49:01] it's what's going to preserve you is the
[49:03] fear of the Lord if businesses go
[49:05] bankrupt at the greatest companies in
[49:07] the world are turned out to be nothing
[49:08] more than another Enron and all of a
[49:10] sudden we don't have Amazon Prime
[49:12] anymore we we can't go here and we can't
[49:14] go to just think what would happen if
[49:15] down east without a business
[49:18] and there's a lot of things that might
[49:20] we could really keep ourselves awake at
[49:22] night but just look back and see what
[49:24] God has done he's met every challenge
[49:26] he's he's satisfied every need
[49:30] if you've had a want and he didn't want
[49:32] to fill it he's still yet placated it
[49:34] and he gave you what you really need God
[49:36] is faithful he will take care of us and
[49:38] wisdom and knowledge will be the
[49:39] stability of our times and the strength
[49:41] of our Salvation that's our greatest
[49:43] asset in times like this in other words
[49:45] don't get your lying Tangled in times
[49:47] like this you want your line to be
[49:49] straight so you can catch the real thing
[49:52] so you can have your nets full when it's
[49:54] been dark all night and you haven't
[49:56] caught anything don't get your nets
[49:58] Tangled Up don't get your line Tangled
[49:59] Up in times like these
[50:02] wisdom and knowledge shall be the
[50:03] stability of thy times
[50:05] and brother Bram said no True Believer
[50:07] is any stronger I love this such a such
[50:10] a heartful any stronger and spiritually
[50:13] healthy and alive
[50:15] so you're not going to be any more
[50:16] healthy
[50:18] strong alive then his knowledge of and
[50:22] adherence to the pure word of God
[50:26] is so brother brother Aaron where's my
[50:29] strength your knowledge of and obedience
[50:31] too the pure word of God every word in
[50:33] that phrase is necessary to understand
[50:36] it's not it's you can't just you can't
[50:38] leave any one part out your knowledge of
[50:40] and adherence to the pure word of God
[50:46] it's got to be this knowledge of it so
[50:48] we want to know it we want to understand
[50:49] it we want to have it we want to be we
[50:50] want to be listening to it we want to be
[50:52] feeding on and then we want to be
[50:53] obeying it
[50:55] so your strength your spiritual health
[50:56] Your vitality your life your living is
[50:59] connected with your knowledge of the
[51:01] word of God and your adherence to the
[51:02] word of God
[51:03] but what does a red herring do
[51:06] Cuts you off from your health
[51:08] cut you off from your strength your
[51:09] spiritual Vitality your spiritual health
[51:12] it's that's what causes the instability
[51:15] when you're walking and you're staying
[51:17] balanced you're staying in the middle of
[51:18] the road you're walking where where the
[51:20] fire has already been you're standing in
[51:21] the promise of God and all of a sudden
[51:23] something says well we should probably
[51:24] do this we should probably do this and
[51:25] you start chasing after this and you you
[51:27] depart from what you know and you start
[51:30] moving this way and you start going
[51:32] that's what causes your instability
[51:34] and Jesus like hey what is that to you
[51:36] don't worry about that follow thou me
[51:39] I I'm a nervous traveler some of you
[51:42] probably know it and I if the if the
[51:44] flight's at noon I want to be there at
[51:46] midnight you know the noon before uh and
[51:49] there's just it's just the way that I am
[51:51] I want to get there really really early
[51:52] and I I second guess everything it's
[51:55] like I know that says right there this
[51:57] is where baggage claim is but
[52:00] there's a lot of baggage claims in
[52:01] airports right which one is ours and if
[52:03] I ever not sure I stop
[52:06] right it could be a whole crowd going
[52:07] one way my family everybody and there
[52:10] they go They're disappearing into the
[52:11] massive people I'm saying they're going
[52:12] what do we do
[52:14] which way do we go and they're falling
[52:15] the crowd right I'm like no I want to be
[52:16] sure if you don't know stop for a moment
[52:19] get your bearing straight recalibrate
[52:22] find where the word is not the crowd not
[52:24] the questions not the sensationalism get
[52:27] back to Center readjust recalibrate and
[52:29] get your focus right
[52:33] because our health our strength our
[52:35] Vitality our living is in our knowledge
[52:38] of the word and our adherence to it
[52:40] but Jesus when he gives the parable of
[52:42] the sower he said the seed is the word
[52:43] of God and it finds place in different
[52:45] ground but one of the most descriptive
[52:48] passages he uses is that seed that falls
[52:50] into the ground that has other things
[52:52] growing up and it's a stage right before
[52:54] the perfect ground and these other Vine
[52:56] grows up together with it and he says
[52:58] this and the cares Mark 4 19 and the
[53:00] cares of this world and the
[53:01] deceitfulness of riches cares of this
[53:04] world the anxiety this care the word is
[53:06] through the idea of being distracted
[53:09] you notice sometimes when you have
[53:11] something you're supposed to do but when
[53:12] you're anxious you end up doing
[53:13] everything else that you're not supposed
[53:16] to do it right I joke with my wife
[53:18] whenever we've got a deadline or we're
[53:20] going on a vacation we got something we
[53:21] got to get done I just joke with her she
[53:23] needs to go find a garage sale buy a
[53:25] find a dresser or a bookshelf and strip
[53:27] it down and repaint it and sand it and
[53:29] antique it because we got a lot we need
[53:31] to do but this is about that time when
[53:32] you got so much going on you find
[53:34] yourself completely rearranging your
[53:36] sock drawer and he's like hey you've got
[53:37] something you need to do
[53:39] like no have you ever thought about
[53:40] doing it by height you know sock length
[53:43] right and you get you get distracted
[53:45] right you get because you're anxious
[53:48] and the cares of this world and the
[53:50] deceitfulness of riches in other words
[53:51] riches promise a lot to you all right
[53:54] maybe I could get a real hearty a man
[53:55] how many of you ever taken a job because
[53:57] it offered you more money and you found
[53:59] out that was a lie
[54:01] that was so empty
[54:04] right it did not I thought that was
[54:06] going to be the fix and it's not the fix
[54:08] oh if I can just get a good job then I
[54:10] can be more faithful this if I could
[54:11] just get a better paying job I'll be
[54:13] more faithful this and you find God
[54:14] gives you exactly what you said would be
[54:16] the answer and probably what needs to
[54:18] happen is it's gut check time you need
[54:20] to suck it up and start being the
[54:21] believer you know that you're called to
[54:22] be
[54:23] stop making excuses stop wait asking God
[54:26] if you do this if you'll do that and
[54:27] start bargaining with God and you're a
[54:29] Son of God he's going to give you
[54:30] sometimes the things that you ask for
[54:32] even when he knows it's not the answer
[54:33] but he doesn't because he loves you and
[54:35] he doesn't like your anxiety and he
[54:37] wants you to be mentally well and he
[54:38] wants you to be healthy and so sometimes
[54:40] God is just kind of satisfying us but if
[54:42] as we mature we need to stop and say
[54:44] wait a minute
[54:46] no no it's not that the answer is not in
[54:48] all these other things the answer is in
[54:49] the word of God and me just stepping up
[54:51] as a Believer and saying I know this is
[54:53] right I know this is the truth I'm going
[54:55] to do it I know I need to do as a
[54:57] Believer and stop making excuses
[55:01] I'm done with my diet of red herring I
[55:03] want to start eating trout
[55:05] I guess this is safe for any pescetarian
[55:11] the cares of this world the
[55:13] deceitfulness the riches and the lust of
[55:14] other things entering in what what
[55:16] wealth is being described in this
[55:20] choke the word
[55:22] and the word becomes unfruitful
[55:25] the cares of this world to this idea of
[55:28] being distracted comes from the root to
[55:30] divide
[55:31] to cut into pieces
[55:33] and that's what happens with the red
[55:34] herring is our attention is divided now
[55:38] you got a job you got to go that's not
[55:39] supposed to do it all said in the scent
[55:42] oh wait hold on
[55:44] it's kind of like our kids at a
[55:46] restaurant right there's a screen on the
[55:48] wall it's kind of like
[55:51] you'll try to sit in the corner right
[55:53] where they can't see it and they'll find
[55:54] them
[55:56] Preston
[55:58] yeah
[55:59] you eat your food
[56:05] you got it you gotta eat your meal You
[56:06] Gotta Eat Focus but there's a destroy
[56:08] there's a commercial on right
[56:11] Febreze yeah I like this one this is a
[56:14] good commercial
[56:20] ask yourself what are the red herrings
[56:22] in your life
[56:24] are we is is there even a consciousness
[56:26] of the distractions from the word of God
[56:29] again I'll be very very very plain to
[56:32] you I'm burdened as a pastor I've got to
[56:35] deliver this am I thinking of any one
[56:37] particular person in here no but you
[56:40] better be making this personal
[56:42] because I know this is a burden I've got
[56:43] to deliver I've got to share God showed
[56:46] me things and expressed things to me I
[56:48] know this is important for us to think
[56:49] about and to ponder because the question
[56:51] is do you even know
[56:54] that you're on the sin of a red herring
[56:57] in not the rainbow trout
[57:00] the rainbow trout represents this pure
[57:02] word that we're feeding on
[57:05] there is a genuine word that we ought to
[57:07] be focused on there is a Perfection that
[57:09] we ought to be pursuing
[57:11] and it doesn't relate to the Instagram
[57:13] life it doesn't relate to the image that
[57:16] we want to portray to people where
[57:18] everything's kind of filtered and
[57:19] everything looks good whether it be even
[57:20] your your church a lot of people want to
[57:22] go to church for all the reasons why
[57:24] people are on Instagram
[57:26] right they want to be part of a circle
[57:28] they want to be impressing people they
[57:30] want to have us take a look they want to
[57:31] have a particular reputation and and
[57:33] it's there's a drive within people's
[57:35] hearts where the word is not what
[57:37] matters
[57:40] there's a Perfection that we're to
[57:42] pursue and it's not social it's not
[57:43] physical
[57:45] it's the word of God
[57:46] and we cannot not in times like this we
[57:49] cannot allow our attention to be grabbed
[57:50] by a red herring
[57:52] this is something that we got to shake
[57:53] ourselves brother I talked about it a
[57:54] couple times on the seals you'll catch
[57:56] it if you're Wide Awake wake up pinch
[57:58] yourself you know think about it
[57:59] consider the hour that we're living in a
[58:01] Shake Yourself
[58:02] he even told Life Tabernacle there in
[58:04] Shreveport run for your life
[58:08] wake up Samson what's wrong with you
[58:10] wait Shake Yourself where are you at
[58:14] gotta be careful we don't have the wrong
[58:15] Focus where we're so focused on certain
[58:17] things and into some way we could say
[58:19] the wrong emphasis
[58:22] in Matthew chapter 23 verse 23
[58:25] Jesus says well when you scribes and
[58:27] Pharisees hypocrites
[58:30] for you pay tithe of mint and innocent
[58:32] cumin these are spices
[58:34] these are herbs that they tithe on in
[58:36] other words they pay tithes on the cumin
[58:39] like
[58:40] they're going to measure it out right
[58:42] like if you're going to make somebody
[58:43] say oh no you got to take that you got
[58:45] to take that herb there
[58:46] and um you know you got to make sure you
[58:48] tithe it right you got to make sure you
[58:50] get it all figured out and they they do
[58:52] all these things whether
[58:54] it's hyper focused on this one aspect of
[58:56] tithing and have omitted the weightier
[58:58] matters of the law
[58:59] judgment mercy and faith
[59:03] they're worried about this one side but
[59:05] they're they're they're not exercising
[59:06] Justice they're not demonstrating Mercy
[59:08] they're not they're not promoting Faith
[59:10] he says and I love how Jesus says these
[59:12] ought to have done
[59:14] and not leave the other undone
[59:16] so what was it an inability to give the
[59:18] proper weight to things because he says
[59:21] the weightier matters of the law there
[59:22] was an inappropriate emphasis on one
[59:24] part and that's wrong maybe the too much
[59:27] emphasis but Jesus is saying don't make
[59:29] the opposite mistake of forgetting all
[59:31] about this and doing the other part
[59:33] they had the wrong Focus their attention
[59:35] had been divided they were so concerned
[59:36] about this they were leaving others
[59:38] undone and Jesus says Hey paying the
[59:40] tithe is not wrong but you're hyper
[59:42] focused you're legalistic you're so
[59:44] concerned about this part of it you're
[59:46] forgetting the more important parts
[59:48] what what is all this if you don't have
[59:50] Justice if you don't have mercy if you
[59:52] don't have faith
[59:53] as I was considering it pondering it uh
[59:56] yesterday judgment mercy and Faith these
[59:58] are the great balancers
[59:59] to the tithing to the to the the
[1:00:02] detailed ways that the word of God
[1:00:03] addresses our lives without without
[1:00:06] judgment mercy and faith without the
[1:00:08] right the Justice the judgment's not
[1:00:10] just being critical we might be thinking
[1:00:11] well I got that down
[1:00:12] but no we're talking about judgment is
[1:00:14] Justice having having mercy and and
[1:00:17] doing things that are right great
[1:00:20] having a heart having a care without
[1:00:23] judgment mercy and Faith whatever we're
[1:00:25] doing on the other end is out of Step
[1:00:26] it's out of balance we're getting heavy
[1:00:29] on one side and we're leaning too far
[1:00:31] this way and we've got to come back and
[1:00:32] get judgment mercy and Faith to balance
[1:00:34] us out so that we can be making the
[1:00:36] progress we need to make
[1:00:39] and brother Branham says in the message
[1:00:41] Discerning the body of the Lord because
[1:00:42] here here's these priests who are taken
[1:00:46] out you know dividing mint and being so
[1:00:48] precise and so particular this is this
[1:00:50] is exactly what brother Branham said
[1:00:52] this and this is exactly the way it's
[1:00:53] got to be and it's exactly the way it's
[1:00:55] got to be and it's kind of like okay all
[1:00:57] right let's that's good I like that he
[1:01:00] also said this well I mean
[1:01:02] I mean
[1:01:04] that's just one quote well so is this
[1:01:08] Yeah but I
[1:01:10] said that in brother so-and-so's church
[1:01:12] and he had this problem this guy had an
[1:01:13] uncle
[1:01:14] twice removed who had a daughter who
[1:01:17] adopted a kid from Indonesia who had a
[1:01:19] friend in a school that he went to when
[1:01:21] he was a foreign exchange student who
[1:01:23] told him this story and brother Ben just
[1:01:24] kind of had to go down that path to kind
[1:01:26] of balance something out you're kind of
[1:01:27] like wait what
[1:01:29] seriously
[1:01:31] I know that seems a little extreme right
[1:01:34] but it's kind of what is that to you
[1:01:37] the quote meant the quote was fine here
[1:01:39] well what about the quote here
[1:01:42] and I you don't even that the red
[1:01:44] herring would be trying to debate them
[1:01:45] both but just say hey what about just
[1:01:47] taking God at his word what about doing
[1:01:49] both what about honoring the message if
[1:01:51] you honor it here why not honor it there
[1:01:53] there's a power to it there's a lie to
[1:01:55] it there's a rationale to it there's
[1:01:56] very little there's things in the
[1:01:58] message of that or that I do not
[1:01:59] understand there's questions and
[1:02:00] probably most questions you'd ask me I'd
[1:02:02] be like wow that's a good question I
[1:02:04] have it too and I'm like well answer I'm
[1:02:05] like
[1:02:06] yeah yeah answer would be great who do
[1:02:09] we ask
[1:02:10] right
[1:02:11] and and it's just there's a lot of
[1:02:14] questions but there's some things when
[1:02:16] I've explored things and got into it
[1:02:17] very rarely do I ever when I come to the
[1:02:20] answer I realize there's a wisdom in
[1:02:21] what brother Branham taught there's
[1:02:22] wisdom in the in the encouragement
[1:02:24] there's wisdoms in the standard and it's
[1:02:27] not all racism and misogyny and
[1:02:29] chauvinism and all this there's wisdom
[1:02:31] behind it to glorify God to keep our
[1:02:34] hearts clean and there's a way that we
[1:02:36] we try to solely up the message and we
[1:02:38] chase after all these red hair and
[1:02:39] arguments God I know your word is pure I
[1:02:42] know your word is true Lord help me to
[1:02:45] understand it help me to know it and
[1:02:47] don't let me get caught up in trying to
[1:02:48] be so precise here and completely undone
[1:02:51] over here Lord if I've got to do the one
[1:02:54] and the other just help me give the
[1:02:55] proper emphasis
[1:02:57] brother Brandon says in the message
[1:02:59] Discerning the body of the Lord
[1:03:01] this phrase this first one here keep
[1:03:03] keep this in mind he says Communism has
[1:03:06] come in on us
[1:03:07] and it has in ways that maybe you don't
[1:03:09] realize
[1:03:11] because when we think Communists we
[1:03:12] think of the Cold War we think the Red
[1:03:13] Scare but communism is an ideology
[1:03:16] that has rebranded itself kind of like
[1:03:18] Avon became the Lone Star Network or
[1:03:20] something like that right it's the same
[1:03:22] idea just with a different label why
[1:03:24] because everybody's counting yeah I'm
[1:03:25] not really big on communism
[1:03:27] but this right like that's good it's
[1:03:32] like have you ever opened the box up
[1:03:33] it's the same ingredients right just
[1:03:36] rebranded so when we're going to talk
[1:03:38] about communism don't just think about
[1:03:39] Russia don't think just China it's
[1:03:41] ideology
[1:03:44] and he says Communism has come amongst
[1:03:46] us
[1:03:46] world has come in on us our churches are
[1:03:49] broken up men dividing themselves
[1:03:52] separate in themselves not seemingly to
[1:03:54] have the faith splitting the hairs over
[1:03:57] the little insignificant doctrines
[1:03:59] we should come together arm and heart
[1:04:01] and pray and fast and call until God
[1:04:03] sends back the holy ghost that we might
[1:04:05] have spiritual discernment
[1:04:07] I thought it was so beautiful
[1:04:09] how brother Branham has taken us and and
[1:04:12] and identifying all these different
[1:04:14] tricks and he says men are dividing
[1:04:15] themselves
[1:04:17] separating from one another
[1:04:19] he says seemingly not having the faith
[1:04:20] so he's referring to a particular
[1:04:21] scripture I believe
[1:04:23] he says splitting hairs over little
[1:04:25] insignificant doctrines
[1:04:27] and this is this is part of the red
[1:04:29] herring and rainbow trout I think this
[1:04:31] is where it really opened up to me is
[1:04:33] there's things we start splitting hairs
[1:04:34] over and we divide ourselves
[1:04:37] it's like that's that's that's the
[1:04:40] dividing line now
[1:04:42] this is what's going to separate
[1:04:45] and it's like but what about the what
[1:04:47] about the this truth
[1:04:49] this is the word of God this is what
[1:04:51] we're taught this little this little
[1:04:53] thing over here this is a red herring if
[1:04:55] this is what you're wanting to split
[1:04:56] split if this is the hair you're wanting
[1:04:58] to split
[1:05:00] and brother bam says Communism has come
[1:05:01] amongst us
[1:05:03] that totalitarian rule this
[1:05:05] authoritarian type of government
[1:05:08] and I read in an academic article here
[1:05:11] recently
[1:05:12] it was very very extraordinary the way
[1:05:15] that it describes these regimes it says
[1:05:17] they must create maximum insecurity in
[1:05:19] the people
[1:05:21] that they control
[1:05:23] and so how do you create maximum
[1:05:25] insecurity through disinformation
[1:05:29] that this is the whole goal to
[1:05:30] controlling people in communism is
[1:05:32] create this insecurity and so what's the
[1:05:35] word that's often associated with
[1:05:36] communistic regimes propaganda
[1:05:39] but did you know that word actually is
[1:05:41] started with the Catholic Church
[1:05:43] it's about propagating Faith propagating
[1:05:45] the doctrine it says propaganda is now
[1:05:47] the dissemination of information that's
[1:05:49] intended to promote a particular View
[1:05:52] and so now nowadays if we think about it
[1:05:54] as maybe message Believers or not as
[1:05:57] Americans we think propaganda we view it
[1:05:59] in a negative light we say oh well
[1:06:00] propaganda you know that's it's
[1:06:02] misinformation it's disinformation and
[1:06:03] it typically is but it's used in such a
[1:06:06] way to condition the mind to believe
[1:06:08] certain things are the way they are
[1:06:09] these people are bad these you can't
[1:06:11] trust these people they've done this
[1:06:13] they've done that and you're told it
[1:06:14] enough
[1:06:15] right this has been scientifically
[1:06:17] proven through a number of different uh
[1:06:19] sociology studies that the more often
[1:06:21] you hear a myth's truth the more likely
[1:06:23] you are to believe that it's actually
[1:06:24] true because you don't ever rally dig
[1:06:27] into it to try to figure it out it's
[1:06:28] just you heard it once you heard it
[1:06:29] again and you hear it enough your mind
[1:06:30] just assumes the truth of it
[1:06:35] and brother Andrew this is where I'm
[1:06:37] quoting your the esteemed senator from
[1:06:39] Virginia
[1:06:40] they had a is an intelligence committee
[1:06:43] report
[1:06:45] and the hearings that they had on
[1:06:46] Russian interference in the 2016
[1:06:48] election and I was reading through
[1:06:50] things because the phenomena is this and
[1:06:53] a lot of us don't realize it that
[1:06:55] foreign governments who are always been
[1:06:58] well versed in propaganda locally in
[1:07:01] their own regions or to cause conflicts
[1:07:03] and dissuade the control the people in
[1:07:04] other regions they now have more tools
[1:07:06] at their disposal than ever and they
[1:07:09] have access to your mind and your
[1:07:11] thought process through social media and
[1:07:13] we don't even realize just how much
[1:07:17] nonsense we're feeding on
[1:07:20] that is the that has been concocted for
[1:07:23] the purposes of propaganda whether it's
[1:07:24] being done domestically or by Foreign
[1:07:26] governments and the wealth of proof of
[1:07:30] whether or not you say well the Russians
[1:07:31] manipulated this the Russians like they
[1:07:33] have proved that they were controlling
[1:07:35] social media accounts to the thousands
[1:07:38] saying things that they knew would
[1:07:41] motivate a particular base of people and
[1:07:43] they would believe it and they would be
[1:07:45] hot on the trail right and they're gonna
[1:07:47] they're gonna do this and do that and
[1:07:49] they could pretty much control certain
[1:07:51] groups of people through propaganda
[1:07:54] and brother Mark Warner said the
[1:07:55] Russians employed thousands of paid
[1:07:57] internet trolls and botnets to push out
[1:07:59] disinformation and fake news at a high
[1:08:01] volume focusing this material onto your
[1:08:03] Twitter and Facebook feeds and flooding
[1:08:05] our social media with misinformation
[1:08:06] this fake news and disinformation was
[1:08:09] then hyped by the American Media Echo
[1:08:11] chamber and our own social media
[1:08:13] networks to reach and potentially
[1:08:15] influence millions of Americans
[1:08:18] communism is amongst us in ways that we
[1:08:20] don't realize manipulating Us in ways
[1:08:23] that brother Branham was identifying
[1:08:25] then it's causing people to separate
[1:08:26] causing people to divide it it's the red
[1:08:29] herring that divides us
[1:08:31] why because there's one thing that
[1:08:33] unites us
[1:08:34] the word the rainbow trout if you want
[1:08:36] to say you're the rainbow trout why are
[1:08:38] we all here not because we're smoke
[1:08:39] Herring right
[1:08:41] not because we're pickled fish we're
[1:08:43] here because we were caught by the third
[1:08:46] pool we're here because we're rainbow
[1:08:48] trout really that's what unites us
[1:08:51] that's what we're gathered around so
[1:08:52] then we need to be very careful about
[1:08:54] the things that begin to divide us and
[1:08:55] separate us it's okay for us to have
[1:08:57] differences of opinions it's okay for us
[1:08:59] to have different levels of Revelation I
[1:09:01] remember my wife when we recorded and
[1:09:03] she was like but but I don't have as
[1:09:04] much Revelation as you and I'm like okay
[1:09:06] cool right it's like we can be at
[1:09:09] different levels it's all right I mean I
[1:09:10] don't want to be debating the godhead
[1:09:12] with you necessarily right but he's not
[1:09:14] one like your fingers one well brother
[1:09:15] Ram sit over here it's like honey come
[1:09:17] on I just want to marry you
[1:09:21] so there's things that yeah there's
[1:09:22] going to be different levels right we're
[1:09:24] all in different areas so and there may
[1:09:25] be things that you feel very strongly
[1:09:27] about and I would say feel strong about
[1:09:30] it obey your conscience honor the Lord
[1:09:33] do what he asks you to do but if you if
[1:09:36] it comes to the division be sure that
[1:09:39] you're separating yourself under the
[1:09:40] real word of God and the truth and
[1:09:43] you're not letting hair splitting be the
[1:09:45] issue that divides us
[1:09:48] Jesus said for wheresoever the carcass
[1:09:50] is there will the Eagles be gathered
[1:09:52] together
[1:09:54] brother man picked up on this and what
[1:09:55] is the attraction and he says that's
[1:09:57] what the attraction is the predestinated
[1:09:59] seat of God who can't do nothing else
[1:10:00] but follow it means more than life to us
[1:10:03] take our lives but don't you take that
[1:10:05] so it's the message of the hour that
[1:10:07] we've got to be that means more than
[1:10:09] life to us that's that's what the
[1:10:10] attractions what is attraction God as
[1:10:12] usual fulfilling his word that's what we
[1:10:14] gather around we gather around the
[1:10:16] fulfilled word and and there's things
[1:10:18] that even I could say as a church that
[1:10:20] we are primarily gathered around we do
[1:10:22] not have some kind of pet Doctrine we
[1:10:24] don't have some particular new take on
[1:10:26] the message we honor the word that has
[1:10:28] already been given to us we stay
[1:10:30] faithful to the truth that's already
[1:10:31] been opened up and revealed there's not
[1:10:33] another kingdom we're building we I
[1:10:35] believe in this age there's a reason why
[1:10:36] brother Branham introduced the bride age
[1:10:38] because the bride in her age is married
[1:10:41] to Christ and there's not another so we
[1:10:43] don't need another God another Elohim
[1:10:45] another Prophet we don't need another
[1:10:47] interpretation we are being wed and
[1:10:49] married to our Christ let's make sure
[1:10:51] that we have that in common that's what
[1:10:53] joins us together and that there's
[1:10:55] something that makes you different
[1:10:56] that's wonderful we embrace it stay with
[1:10:59] your conviction but be very careful that
[1:11:01] you don't let a red herring separate us
[1:11:06] there's certain things you can take and
[1:11:08] you can have but don't take this
[1:11:09] revealed word
[1:11:11] hair splitting as brother man refers to
[1:11:12] it it's something that to allow very
[1:11:15] small distinctions the hair splitting
[1:11:18] small differences become the the the the
[1:11:20] large separation that's what the hair
[1:11:23] splitting implies is that well that's
[1:11:24] that's a that's a that's a different
[1:11:26] take that's split in a hair that's a
[1:11:28] really fine distinction but when it but
[1:11:30] it's used to refer to something that wow
[1:11:33] that's what divided you
[1:11:37] and brother Brandon makes reference to
[1:11:39] it I'm sorry I'm just I'm just going
[1:11:40] along today
[1:11:42] I mean I've I've preached it's a
[1:11:46] eight o'clock
[1:11:51] and brother Bradham makes this statement
[1:11:53] every okay right now you you good
[1:11:55] brother Joel I'm just gonna check with
[1:11:56] you he's good and I'll keep my eyes on
[1:11:57] you are you good Cindy okay good
[1:11:59] everybody's all right okay good if you
[1:12:01] leave crawl out so I don't see you and I
[1:12:03] want to get my feelings hurt
[1:12:06] all right brother Brandon makes that
[1:12:08] statement he says men dividing
[1:12:09] themselves he says seemingly not have
[1:12:12] separate himself seemingly not having
[1:12:13] the faith and to me he's referring to
[1:12:15] Jude 19.
[1:12:17] these be then I'm glad I didn't put it
[1:12:20] in I had this whole section there the
[1:12:22] spots of In Your Love Feast he said
[1:12:24] these be they who separate themselves
[1:12:27] sensual having not the spirit
[1:12:30] they disjoin they separate from one
[1:12:32] another they make divisions or
[1:12:33] separations what Paul excuse me what
[1:12:36] Jude is identifying is this mindset in
[1:12:38] certain people who kind of prop
[1:12:39] themselves up and they have these
[1:12:41] distinctions brother Ben says it's hair
[1:12:43] splitting who don't seem to have the
[1:12:45] faith here it says they don't have the
[1:12:47] spirit they're sensual and they come up
[1:12:49] with some sort of man-made class or some
[1:12:51] sort of idea of approaching things and
[1:12:53] they have a carnal way of distinguishing
[1:12:55] themselves right I I don't have a
[1:12:57] problem maybe bringing it up with
[1:12:59] Christmas right there are certain people
[1:13:01] that have taken the Christmas and
[1:13:02] they've used that to separate themselves
[1:13:04] out and they create the divisions people
[1:13:06] who separate celebrate Christmas and
[1:13:08] people who don't celebrate Christmas and
[1:13:10] yeah that's maybe some real literal
[1:13:12] categorizations but what they do is they
[1:13:15] say but the group that does this are the
[1:13:17] real believers
[1:13:19] and that becomes the hair splitting so
[1:13:21] what's a pretty major topic brother
[1:13:22] Aaron the Christmas tree I mean that's
[1:13:24] something you should be able to Christ
[1:13:26] died on a tree this was a mountain we
[1:13:27] should die on say all right if that's
[1:13:29] where you're doing it you just better be
[1:13:31] sure of it because to me that's one of
[1:13:33] those little red herrings where we get
[1:13:34] distracted for 60 days uh I think we
[1:13:37] started hearing Christmas music after
[1:13:38] July 4th though but there's things that
[1:13:41] that starts separating people and
[1:13:43] dividing people it's like hold on hold
[1:13:45] on that can mean a lot to somebody it
[1:13:47] can mean a whole lot to them and they
[1:13:48] have deep deep convictions about
[1:13:50] Christmas and their attitude towards it
[1:13:52] and they're very fearful and reverential
[1:13:54] about that subject God bless them I
[1:13:55] don't want to say a thing against it but
[1:13:57] let's be careful that our meat doesn't
[1:13:59] offend somebody else if that's your
[1:14:01] Revelation if that's what you're feeding
[1:14:03] let's go back to the message of the hour
[1:14:04] does the prophet draw a line in the sand
[1:14:06] and say still who will stand with me who
[1:14:09] will be shoulder to shoulder be who will
[1:14:11] stand with me in the word of God and
[1:14:13] draw their swords against Santa Claus
[1:14:16] right
[1:14:19] just be sure that you're you're on the
[1:14:21] right side of the message of the hour
[1:14:23] because Jude has referring to people
[1:14:25] through self-promotion
[1:14:27] they they represented that they had a
[1:14:29] greater sanctity
[1:14:31] that they were more spiritual they had a
[1:14:33] better wisdom they had a unique Doctrine
[1:14:35] a different kind of take on things and
[1:14:37] that made them distinct from others so
[1:14:39] that's what they did is they separated
[1:14:40] themselves oh oh you don't believe this
[1:14:43] or oh you believe that or as for us this
[1:14:46] is what we do this is our conviction and
[1:14:48] what there's they separate themselves
[1:14:50] Billy Bram says and hear ye him and are
[1:14:52] we about our father's business of the
[1:14:54] Holy Spirit get in every soul saved we
[1:14:55] can just on the word or are we arrogant
[1:14:58] this is what he's referring to about
[1:15:00] these hair Splitters arrogant and
[1:15:02] dilatory and arrogant over little
[1:15:03] religious differences and splitting
[1:15:05] hairs such nonsense no wonder faith is
[1:15:07] gone
[1:15:09] it's they're arguing over a little
[1:15:11] difference hair splitting he says that's
[1:15:12] why faith is gone is not because there's
[1:15:14] not a word that we can feed on it's
[1:15:16] because we have a diet of red herring
[1:15:19] that's why our breath stinks right that
[1:15:22] this is all we feed no wonder that's why
[1:15:25] sometimes children don't want to have
[1:15:26] anything to do with church it's like I'm
[1:15:27] tired of the diet of red herring
[1:15:30] they're not built for it they're not
[1:15:31] made for it I believe that there's a lot
[1:15:33] of situations where people make
[1:15:34] conclusions about people I'm like hold
[1:15:36] on wait a minute they've never had the
[1:15:39] right kind of diet to bring out all the
[1:15:40] gold that's in them
[1:15:41] they never had the right nurture the
[1:15:43] right kind of diet the right kind of
[1:15:44] atmosphere don't judge it yet no I don't
[1:15:47] care how many years it's been watch that
[1:15:49] seed get in the right atmosphere under
[1:15:51] the right kind of conditions of a loving
[1:15:53] Body of Christ a faithful minister to
[1:15:55] the word of God who's promoting right
[1:15:57] things boom watch them blow up an
[1:15:59] awesome Blossom and be something like
[1:16:00] hey look at this guy who knew he had it
[1:16:02] in them why don't judge them they just
[1:16:04] may have a poor diet and let us be those
[1:16:07] who can be espousing the right kind of
[1:16:10] diet that we can demonstrate that we can
[1:16:12] be Advocates that we can have possession
[1:16:15] and be a stakeholder in this message to
[1:16:17] say this is the way walking in it what
[1:16:20] is that to you follow the word of God
[1:16:26] yes
[1:16:41] anybody remember when I started
[1:16:49] I just let me
[1:16:59] just read Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 to
[1:17:01] 2. I think I'll just read this and end
[1:17:03] he says wherefore seeing we also are
[1:17:05] compassed about
[1:17:08] with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:17:10] let us lay aside every weight
[1:17:13] and these sin which doth so easily beset
[1:17:17] us
[1:17:19] the way the way that Paul is describing
[1:17:20] is just there's just things that are so
[1:17:22] easy to us
[1:17:24] they're everywhere they're around us
[1:17:25] it's the sin that surrounds us it's the
[1:17:27] weight the weight that death beset us
[1:17:28] and so there's things that are implied
[1:17:30] here that that may be harmless and
[1:17:32] otherwise useful that can hinder our
[1:17:34] growth of progress
[1:17:36] he says the weight that besets us and
[1:17:38] the sin that besets us he makes a
[1:17:39] decision himself of things that just
[1:17:42] might be distracting you that in
[1:17:43] themselves are plausible and they're
[1:17:45] Sensational and themselves may not may
[1:17:47] not necessarily be sin or evil or some
[1:17:49] kind of false Doctrine he's saying
[1:17:50] there's things that don't promote our
[1:17:52] growth they beset us they hinder us they
[1:17:54] be setting means that it's a weight it's
[1:17:56] an encumbrance a hindrance
[1:17:59] so let's lay aside every red herring
[1:18:03] lay aside anything that just so easily
[1:18:05] triggers us and
[1:18:07] it gets us off track and gets us on the
[1:18:10] wrong set and he says let us run with
[1:18:11] patience the race that is set before us
[1:18:14] and these beautiful words that I'll
[1:18:15] close on looking unto Jesus
[1:18:19] the author
[1:18:20] and finisher of our faith
[1:18:24] this is the refocusing
[1:18:27] that kind of gets us back on track
[1:18:32] how many here eat sushi
[1:18:36] sister Chris next picnic
[1:18:39] Sushi you don't have to cook anything
[1:18:40] right
[1:18:43] now here's some rainbow trout Raw enjoy
[1:18:46] it
[1:18:48] there's a lot of now I could be wrong
[1:18:49] because I'm not really a sushi eater so
[1:18:51] who's gonna hopefully can help me out
[1:18:52] here maybe get some amens but I love
[1:18:54] watching an American eat sushi right
[1:18:57] they'll take their California roll right
[1:18:58] they think that's real Sushi and they'll
[1:19:00] take their roll
[1:19:01] or their Sashimi they'll take some
[1:19:03] something Raw
[1:19:05] and they take the wasabi
[1:19:09] and the ginger and they just load it up
[1:19:11] like a burger with everything and they
[1:19:13] eat it like man that was good it's like
[1:19:15] uh you're using the ginger wrong
[1:19:18] the ginger is a palette cleanser
[1:19:21] that you take between tastings to reset
[1:19:24] your taste buds
[1:19:26] so you can enjoy the fish
[1:19:29] and Jesus this is the palate cleanser
[1:19:31] from Paul oh there's so much out there
[1:19:33] so many distractions so much things full
[1:19:37] of this and full of that we need to take
[1:19:39] we need to take Christ cleanse our
[1:19:41] pallets
[1:19:43] we need to look unto Jesus the author
[1:19:45] and finisher of our faith we need to
[1:19:47] reset things refocus we need to remove
[1:19:49] that taste of the red herring
[1:19:52] and re-center on the rainbow trout
[1:19:54] so what do you want for lunch
