[0:00] Acts chapter 9, start with verse 4 and
[0:03] then verse five. Then we'll skip over to
[0:05] chapter 26. I think this is scriptures
[0:09] that you're very familiar with as it
[0:10] relates to Saul's conversion who becomes
[0:12] the Apostle Paul. And as he falls down
[0:15] by the appearance of this light on the
[0:18] road to Damascus, he says, "He fell to
[0:19] the earth and heard a voice saying unto
[0:22] him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
[0:24] me?" And he said, "Who art thou, Lord?"
[0:27] And so he's using a a nomination that
[0:30] would declare Elohim or Jehovah. And the
[0:33] Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou
[0:35] persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick
[0:38] against the prick. So there's Paul's
[0:40] telling of it there. Then in chapter 26
[0:44] going to see a similar event. You just
[0:47] kind of summarize this part in verse 14.
[0:50] And it says, ' And when we were all
[0:52] fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
[0:54] speaking unto me and saying in the
[0:57] Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why
[0:59] persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee
[1:02] to kick against the pricks. So there's
[1:05] that common phrasing he uses here. It is
[1:08] hard for thee to kick against the goat
[1:10] against the pricks.
[1:12] Amen. You can be seated.
[1:15] I'm going to take the title tonight of
[1:17] the prophet and the playwrights. the
[1:20] prophet and the playwrights. I'll come
[1:22] to a definition of that here in a
[1:24] moment. Uh but just to kind of recap a
[1:26] few things. I think tonight we may just
[1:28] be closing up this few these three
[1:30] services on this subject of the prophet
[1:32] and the poets and the philosophers and
[1:34] now the playwrights. And we've been
[1:36] examining Paul's use of popular culture
[1:38] uh to convey the gospel to those who did
[1:41] not know God, who did not have a promise
[1:43] of God. And one thing that we could
[1:45] examine in great detail is how the
[1:47] Gentiles had their own gods. They had
[1:49] their own mythology. They had their own
[1:51] superstitious religions and they were
[1:54] fascinated with new ideas and mysteries
[1:57] and kind of the eastern religions be to
[1:59] fascinate them. And then even as the
[2:01] Jewish despora uh made it to some of
[2:03] their counties and their cities and
[2:05] their lands uh there was a lot of Jewish
[2:07] philosophy that begin to get uh mixed
[2:09] into it. There's a lot of hellistic
[2:11] Jews. And so the realm outside of Israel
[2:14] and the theology and the beliefs outside
[2:16] of the Jews uh was very different than
[2:19] what we would see in the Old Testament.
[2:22] And so as Paul was called to take this
[2:24] gospel to the Gentiles as a Bible even
[2:27] says here rise and stand on thy feet for
[2:29] I've appeared unto thee for the purpose
[2:30] to make thee a minister and witness of
[2:32] these things that you'll see that you've
[2:34] seen and from the Gentiles bringing the
[2:37] L word of the Lord to the Gentiles. We
[2:40] see that in Acts chapter 26. And so Paul
[2:42] had to find the way to even show the
[2:44] truth of their philosophies or the
[2:47] questions of their philosophies, the
[2:49] hunger, the things that they were kind
[2:50] of using to itch their ears would be
[2:52] satisfied in Jesus Christ just as it was
[2:57] to the Jews. The Jews had a very robust
[2:58] theology that looked for a messiah. And
[3:01] when Jesus came, he came preaching uh
[3:03] the kingdom of God and and the Messiah.
[3:06] And and then when Paul begins to preach
[3:08] and bring the gospel, he's talking a lot
[3:09] about uh the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[3:12] church. It's very different than what
[3:14] was preached to the Jews and is based
[3:16] upon expectation, based upon kind of
[3:18] what how their appetite or what they
[3:20] were looking to. And so the fact that
[3:23] Paul quoted the Greek classics, I was
[3:26] even sharing this with some people as
[3:27] this has been something that's just
[3:29] really been impressed upon me to dive
[3:31] into. I will say here that I have not
[3:33] discovered these things on my own. Uh
[3:35] I'm not the first person to ever begin
[3:37] to make a connection of some classic
[3:39] things in the Greek philosophy to the
[3:41] things that Paul taught. Uh I would say
[3:43] it's something that the very early
[3:45] Christian commentators and writers is
[3:46] how I came across it and they've been
[3:49] writing on about it for centuries. And
[3:50] so it's something that would be even
[3:52] ministered today in many different
[3:54] pulpits. And so this is an exclusive uh
[3:57] this isn't an Aaronism orism, whatever,
[4:00] however you'd like to say it. uh but it
[4:02] is something that I think is important
[4:03] to us because it's in our Bible. And one
[4:06] thing that has really really uh been
[4:09] impactful to me is how that him quoting
[4:11] these these different philosophers and
[4:13] poets and as he says they're prophets is
[4:15] remarkable because it combines something
[4:18] that I'm absolutely certain is true and
[4:20] that's Bible history with something that
[4:22] is uh well regarded or well researched
[4:24] and well known and that has its own area
[4:26] and that's world history. And it seems
[4:29] for me personally, it's one thing to
[4:31] believe the Bible and the things and the
[4:33] events that happened therein and it
[4:34] seems to be kind of this narrow view.
[4:37] You look in on scripture and you have
[4:39] creation story. You have Abraham and the
[4:40] children of Israel. Then you have the
[4:42] New Testament gospel and it it ends with
[4:44] the prophecies of what will be gentile
[4:46] church ages. And we feel that we kind of
[4:48] get a lens or view into that through the
[4:50] teaching on the church ages and and
[4:52] church history. But now it's not just
[4:54] history of the Jews. It's not just Bible
[4:57] history or church history, but it's
[4:58] world history. And Paul begins to quote
[5:01] from things that the world commonly
[5:02] believes in, commonly accepts and
[5:04] believes as absolute authorities. And it
[5:06] kind of creates this vin diagram in a
[5:08] way of the Bible and the truth of God's
[5:11] word and the things that were existing
[5:13] in other places. I was fellowshipping
[5:15] with my uh my neighbor, not in the
[5:18] apartment next door, but one very close
[5:19] by. His name's Larry. And we were
[5:22] fellowshipping on these things. And uh
[5:23] we were just fellowshipping. we got to
[5:25] talking and he said there was more proof
[5:28] that Paul wrote the letters he wrote
[5:29] than there was proof that Shakespeare uh
[5:32] wrote Hamlet. I was like that's a good
[5:34] one. I'm going to use it. I don't even
[5:35] know if it's true. But I'm just quoting
[5:37] brother Larry.
[5:39] And that's what he said. And so if
[5:41] there's an issue he went to seminary.
[5:43] We'll take it up with him later. But I
[5:45] thought that that was remarkable that
[5:47] there may be some things that even the
[5:49] academics are more confident that Paul
[5:50] wrote than they're even sure about even
[5:52] our modern playwrights or more modern
[5:54] playwrights such as Shakespeare. And so
[5:56] there's that particular aspect there
[5:58] where to me it's just fascinating to see
[6:00] something that is uh world history and
[6:03] then Paul is able to bring these things
[6:05] in and gather some of these things in
[6:07] not just Paul but other sources and we
[6:09] see them fitting together. And then also
[6:13] one thing that I've been trying to or
[6:15] one thing that I want to get across is
[6:17] that as we see these things, there's no
[6:20] need when we see that Paul is teaching
[6:22] using maybe these different sources.
[6:23] There's no need to refute his basis.
[6:26] Well, I don't know that he said that and
[6:27] we can't find this proof and we can't
[6:29] find this script and it only goes back
[6:31] to one person who said that. Maybe we
[6:32] can't find all the the historical
[6:34] details, but we needed to re need to
[6:36] refute it. nor do we have to accept the
[6:38] philosophy he's drawing from and say,
[6:41] "Oh, wow. Well, he's talking about this
[6:43] mysticism. We should dig into that.
[6:45] There's a lot of things that maybe the
[6:47] the Cabal or certain uh uh Jewish
[6:49] mystics uh believe." And if you begin to
[6:51] look into it, say, "Wow, that kind of
[6:53] seems real similar to this teaching and
[6:55] it has this connections to this and oh,
[6:57] I'm all in on that." No, you don't need
[6:58] to do that. Paul gave us the truth as he
[7:02] was ministering it to them and were
[7:03] witnesses of how he's trying to reach
[7:05] these other non-believers. Uh we
[7:07] recognize Paul then shows us what the
[7:09] truth is. We don't have to go hunting it
[7:10] somewhere else.
[7:12] And so the po the prophet we don't have
[7:15] to deny the basis or figure it out. Nor
[7:17] do we need to accept the some new
[7:19] philosophy. The prophet does the tying
[7:21] together for us. And and I believe we
[7:24] can see that same theme with the message
[7:25] of the hour. And so we can preach the
[7:28] gospel uh through the the lens or the
[7:30] benefit of understanding the age we're
[7:32] living in or the lens of popular culture
[7:34] not based upon our own experience but
[7:36] based upon prophetic insight a prophetic
[7:38] vision of the age as Leodysia is defined
[7:41] as being blind. They're wretched.
[7:42] They're miserable. They're naked.
[7:43] They're poor. They're wandering in
[7:45] darkness. And a prophet comes and he
[7:46] rebukes the spirit of the age. And
[7:48] there's a light that comes to the age.
[7:50] And there's a there's an understanding.
[7:52] There's this faculty of being able to
[7:54] receive light that they've got to re
[7:56] they've got to catch in order to come to
[7:59] the light of God's word. And so it's
[8:01] very important for us to realize the
[8:02] prophet was using a language and church
[8:04] history. He's using a language of
[8:06] denominations and denominationalism.
[8:08] He's speaking things in a way just as
[8:10] Paul did so the light of God's word
[8:12] could shine into the hearts of a gentile
[8:15] bride. They could come to know God as he
[8:18] wants to be known. And so that's uh
[8:20] that's that's my uh that's my opening so
[8:25] that we can see that we're uh where
[8:26] we're coming from on this. Now let's
[8:28] look at Acts chapter 17 28. Going to
[8:30] touch on a few things we've spoke on the
[8:32] last couple services. But Paul as he's
[8:34] there on Mars Hill as he's speaking to
[8:36] the sophisters,
[8:38] the educated, the seekers, those that
[8:40] came to that place to hear to ask
[8:42] questions and have their intellect
[8:44] tickled or their enlightenment uh
[8:46] broadened. He says, "For in him we live
[8:49] and move and have our being as certain
[8:52] also of your own poets have said, "For
[8:54] we are also his offspring." The prophet
[8:57] quotes the poets Aratus, Cleanth,
[9:00] Calameus, and Epimenities. He's quoting
[9:02] them from these different writings and
[9:04] some that were said one way this way and
[9:07] some that were said that way. But he's
[9:08] referring to something that would have
[9:10] been part of their uh their vocabulary,
[9:12] their their literature, their knowledge.
[9:15] For in him we live and move and have our
[9:17] being. For we are also his offspring. We
[9:20] find that those very statements are
[9:22] found uh for in him we live and move and
[9:24] have our being is found in those Greek
[9:26] classics. And we are also his offspring
[9:28] is found in these poems or these hymns
[9:30] to Zeus. In Titus 1:12, one of
[9:33] themselves even a prophet of their own,
[9:36] a prophet, a poet and a philosopher.
[9:38] Epimenity said, "The Cretians are always
[9:41] liars, evil beast, slow bellies." We
[9:44] found that written word for word uh in
[9:47] in the classics in Greek literature and
[9:49] Greek philosophy. And so the prophet
[9:51] prophet used a philosophers's paradox.
[9:55] He uses it to make a point about the
[9:56] creations for Titus's sake so that he
[9:58] would know how to find the right men who
[10:00] were qualified to understand the nature
[10:02] and the character of those that he was
[10:04] ministering to. So we could we've seen
[10:06] that he's used their their philosophers,
[10:08] their poets, and their prophets to
[10:10] declare the gospel to unbelievers. Not
[10:13] saying that any one of them were indeed
[10:15] true prophets or had the truth or knew
[10:17] Christ. Uh there's some that even would
[10:20] argue in the early church that the
[10:22] philosophers and some of these
[10:23] philosophers were Christians uh as much
[10:26] as you could be without Christ based
[10:28] upon the things that they were striving
[10:30] for and exploring. But he was bringing
[10:32] the truth of the gospel to these
[10:34] unbelievers.
[10:36] And then in Titus 1:14 after he has used
[10:39] Greek mythology
[10:41] and some henistic terminologies and
[10:43] these things to convince the gains he
[10:46] became a Greek to the Greeks he became a
[10:47] philosopher to the philosophers. He then
[10:50] warns not giving heed to Jewish fables
[10:52] and commandments of men that turn from
[10:55] the truth. So he would only use some
[10:58] light, some understanding, some
[11:00] principle to lead to the truth of
[11:02] Christ. And so he could never abandon
[11:04] the scripture. could never abandon the
[11:06] true character and nature of Christ. He
[11:08] just used those things that could lead
[11:10] them to and stay faithful to the gospel.
[11:12] And he warns them about Jewish fables.
[11:15] That's mythology.
[11:17] And so he shows a path away from
[11:19] mythology. He warns against the defiling
[11:21] of Christianity by uh uh marrying the
[11:24] two together. Some mysticism and Jew
[11:26] Judaism. He said, "No, this may be what
[11:29] you've seen and this may be what you
[11:30] believe. You worship the unknown god.
[11:32] Well, I'm going to declare and make that
[11:34] god known to you." so that you're
[11:35] without excuse.
[11:37] So now to this thought of the prophet
[11:40] and the playwrights. The playwright is
[11:42] one who writes a play or a drama. And so
[11:46] the prophet and the playwrights is my
[11:49] thought tonight. I mentioned before we'd
[11:50] be speaking on this. I had some reach
[11:52] out to me and text me and say, "I think
[11:54] I found where you're going." And so
[11:55] good.
[11:58] You know where I'm going and you can
[11:59] help me get through this. in 1
[12:00] Corinthians chapter 15. I'd like to read
[12:03] verses 30-34.
[12:06] And so we'll just touch on a couple,
[12:07] then we'll go through this. Going to
[12:08] walk through it in the same manner we
[12:10] have in the last two services. I trust
[12:12] that um there's a sufficient enough
[12:15] energy on my part and enthusiasm for the
[12:17] subject matter to where you can find uh
[12:20] and and experience yourselves that God
[12:21] can speak to you through these things
[12:23] that uh will get a benefit out of this.
[12:25] So he says and and I think this is a
[12:27] very dramatic statement by Paul in verse
[12:29] 30. And why stand we in jeopardy every
[12:31] hour? Very dramatic. He says, "I protest
[12:34] by your rejoicing, which I have in
[12:36] Christ Jesus our Lord. I die daily."
[12:39] Those are two sentences that are
[12:41] certainly a mouthful. Now verse 32, "If
[12:44] I after the manner of men, if excuse me,
[12:47] if after the manner of men I have fought
[12:49] with beast at Ephesus, what advantageth
[12:52] it me if the dead rise not? Let us eat
[12:56] and drink for tomorrow we die. Now I
[13:00] often looked at this statement as if I
[13:02] fought like men with a beast and then
[13:04] died like a beast. I think there's
[13:06] certainly that connotation there. But
[13:08] also when I begin to study the the
[13:10] language and how he's using it even in
[13:11] the context if I if after the manner of
[13:14] men he's saying to use maybe a
[13:16] proverbial phrase uh maybe something a
[13:19] popular cliche or something you might
[13:20] hear. If I as men would say fight with
[13:23] beast. So he's using a phrase to those
[13:26] at Ephesus or about those at Ephesus
[13:28] that kind of hearkens to something that
[13:30] would have identified those at uh at
[13:34] Ephesus.
[13:36] There was one philosopher in the 6th
[13:38] century BC, Heraclitus.
[13:41] I wish I could just say these names the
[13:42] way that they look like to me, but I'm
[13:44] I'm afraid I might offend a scholar
[13:45] here. But Heraclitus he said of he was
[13:49] of Ephesus and he was known to have said
[13:52] that the Ephesians had become beasts
[13:54] instead of men. So he says I fought with
[13:57] beasts at Ephesus. Oh well what kind of
[13:59] beast were these? He's talking about the
[14:00] men at Ephesus the Ephesians. And he
[14:02] fought with them and there was this
[14:04] philosopher one of their own who said
[14:05] they become beast instead of men. Plato
[14:07] even was known to call a mixed crowd a
[14:09] beast referring to kind of the
[14:11] irrational behavior of crowds. Uh it was
[14:14] Homer who called uh the goddess Artemis
[14:17] the mistress of wild beast. She was a
[14:19] goddess of hunting. She was known to
[14:20] have a bow and arrow or use arrows. And
[14:23] so by Paul's time, Ephesus had become a
[14:26] stronghold
[14:27] of Artemis. And Artemis was closely
[14:31] associated with a wide array of beasts.
[14:33] So when he says the beast at Ephesus,
[14:35] it's not just snakes or or boars or
[14:39] whatever it is we might be afraid of or
[14:41] coyotes, wolfes, whatever we might think
[14:43] it might be that we'd have to rescue.
[14:45] He's actually talking about the people,
[14:46] the citizens of Ephesus. Ephesus was a
[14:49] stronghold of that cult of Artemis. And
[14:52] so Paul shoots an arrow at them, kind of
[14:54] takes a shot at them using their own
[14:55] language, saying that uh there's I
[14:57] fought with these wild beasts at
[15:00] Ephesus. And he's quoting from and using
[15:02] the language of their philosophers.
[15:05] Then he says, "Let us eat and drink for
[15:08] tomorrow we die."
[15:11] If I just to use the phrase uh that
[15:14] maybe the of the Ephesians, if I have
[15:16] fought with wild beast, what good does
[15:18] it do me if there is no resurrection?
[15:20] Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we
[15:22] die. He quotes from the prophet Isaiah.
[15:26] I'm quoting quoting from the prophet
[15:27] Isaiah chapter 22:13 it says and behold
[15:31] joy and gladness say slaying oxen and
[15:33] killing sheep eating flesh and drinking
[15:35] wine let us eat and drink for tomorrow
[15:37] we shall die so he's quoting scripture
[15:41] but at the same time remember how we
[15:43] referred to the epicurans and the stoics
[15:45] he's using what was an epicuran maximum
[15:47] because they believed there's no life
[15:49] after death so what do you do avoid pain
[15:52] maximize pleasure and their attitude was
[15:54] they only sought not pleasure. They
[15:56] tried to avoid pain because there's
[15:58] nothing afterlife and since there is no
[16:00] resurrection, eat, drink, and be merry
[16:02] for tomorrow we die. So his phrase
[16:06] though he's quoting Isaiah the prophet
[16:08] and it and Isaiah the prophet was alive
[16:10] at the same time Heraclitus was alive
[16:12] around the very near the same time. So
[16:14] what Isaiah said has some root uh has
[16:18] some connection even to or a rebuke to
[16:20] the attitudes of the Greeks and to their
[16:23] idea that there is no afterlife. There
[16:25] is no reason. Just get as much pleasure
[16:26] as you can. Right? So he's pointing he's
[16:30] pointing out here by the use of this
[16:33] phrase that if men believe they'll die
[16:35] like beasts, they'll behave no better
[16:37] than beasts.
[16:39] They'll live to satisfy their appetites.
[16:41] And exactly what the Gentiles did. They
[16:43] lived according to their flesh to
[16:45] satisfy the flesh. They walked blindly.
[16:47] And we can see that in the book of
[16:48] Ephesians and how they walked u to
[16:51] satisfy the needs of the flesh. They had
[16:53] no promise after in the afterlife. So
[16:55] Paul is dealing with the resurrection
[16:57] and right in the middle of the
[16:58] resurrection and quoting Isaiah, he
[17:00] drops this phrase of these wild beasts.
[17:03] Let us eat, drink, for tomorrow we die.
[17:05] And then this is where verse 33, right
[17:07] in the middle of this, he says, "Be not
[17:09] deceived. Evil communications corrupt
[17:11] good manners." And we immediately
[17:12] recognize that to be scripture.
[17:16] And he says, "Awake to righteousness and
[17:18] sin not." Verse 34, "For some have not
[17:21] the knowledge of God." I speak this to
[17:22] your shame. Awake. When he says, "Awake
[17:26] to righteousness," this is a deliberate
[17:28] uh rebuke or reference to Platonic and
[17:30] Stoic philosophies where there was this
[17:33] they all they had this rhetoric about
[17:34] enlightenment that they had this uh
[17:37] their whole uh process the Stoics on the
[17:39] Portico, the porch when they begin to
[17:42] talk, it was all about emerging from
[17:44] ignorance, coming out of the shadows,
[17:45] coming out of darkness, coming into
[17:47] enlightenment to know truth. And that
[17:49] was all about the the Platonic uh belief
[17:52] system, the Stoic rhetoric was all about
[17:54] enlightenment. And he says, "Wake up.
[17:56] Awake to righteousness. For some have
[17:58] not the knowledge of God." Paul Paul
[18:01] uses a phrase to call to mind Greek
[18:04] philosophy. He's using even the
[18:06] language. You'll find he says in other
[18:07] words about the knowledge and the light
[18:09] and the face. And he's using something
[18:10] that would have caught different
[18:11] people's attention. He's using phrases
[18:13] that call to mind hell and mysticism to
[18:17] get their attention. awake to
[18:18] righteousness. Some don't know God, not
[18:21] Zeus, but God. He says, "I speak this to
[18:24] your shame."
[18:26] Now, as we'll come back to some of these
[18:29] elements here, but it taking all these
[18:32] things in together, whether it be in
[18:33] Titus or Acts 17 here in 1 Corinthians
[18:36] 15,
[18:38] Paul is using phrases at times. And in
[18:42] using these phrases, we've seen how
[18:43] they're exact. Uh now we we could always
[18:46] debate, well Paul didn't know that.
[18:48] That's just a coincidence because that's
[18:49] very common. Or that wasn't said that
[18:50] way. It was translated to this in the
[18:52] English. Well then you go back to the
[18:53] Greek and you find it was written in the
[18:55] Greek exactly that way that you'd find
[18:56] it in the Greek and it can still be
[18:58] debated uh the truth of it or the source
[19:01] of it. But if we just accepted that Paul
[19:03] was saying things that people attributed
[19:05] to uh writers and philosophers and minds
[19:08] and and and intellectuals before him.
[19:12] Then this is the response that the
[19:14] people had when they were recognized in
[19:16] that day. Now I want you to focus very
[19:17] closely here in Acts chapter 17 18
[19:22] says then certain philosophers of the
[19:23] Epicurans and of the Stoics. These are
[19:26] these big schools of philosophy. They
[19:28] had their ideology about life and the
[19:30] purpose and meaning of life. We covered
[19:31] that in the first service on the poets.
[19:33] He said they encountered him and said
[19:37] what will this babbler say? others some
[19:41] he seemth to be setter forth of strange
[19:43] gods because he preached unto them Jesus
[19:46] and the resurrection. So again, this
[19:48] resurrection becomes really odd to
[19:50] people because they're saying just live
[19:51] this way, live morally, live good, uh or
[19:54] live maximize pleasure. And all of a
[19:56] sudden, someone's saying that there's an
[19:57] afterlife. Uh you're going to be
[19:59] resurrected. And if you're going to be
[20:00] resurrected, I mean, if we knew that we
[20:03] could treat life like we did when we got
[20:05] our first Nintendo game console, that we
[20:07] could just hit reset or hit power before
[20:10] uh when we get killed or before the game
[20:12] saves again. Man, how many times will we
[20:14] do this over? Be worse than Groundhog
[20:16] Day. and then we just give me a doover.
[20:18] Give me a doover. Give me a doover. And
[20:20] when it's this idea of an afterlife,
[20:22] people start thinking, well, that
[20:23] changes things. This is different. What
[20:25] what does this mean? But think about
[20:27] this phrase. These sophists, these ones
[20:29] that wanted to argue and they had their
[20:31] debates and their genealogies and they
[20:32] had their stats and statistics and they
[20:33] had their their scrolls and they had
[20:35] their their prophets of their own. They
[20:37] call him a babbler.
[20:40] This word babbler means a seed picker.
[20:43] It's like a bird pecking around and
[20:45] gathering seeds.
[20:47] So what they called Paul was he's
[20:49] basically was a parasite.
[20:51] The word babbler would refer to one that
[20:53] would kind of lounge around the market
[20:54] and just kind of pick up whatever might
[20:55] may by chance fall from a merchants's
[20:58] table. So the belie the the Greeks, the
[21:01] intellect, the ones that he was trying
[21:02] to reach, the ones that were being
[21:04] rebuked by the prophet's message believe
[21:07] Paul had nothing original. that all he
[21:10] was doing was just plagiarizing this
[21:11] person, taking this thought from that
[21:13] person, plagiarizing for this, and he
[21:15] was just piecing together bits of others
[21:18] before him. And this is a criticism they
[21:21] had of Paul. He's got nothing original.
[21:23] He stole that from this philosopher.
[21:25] This is nothing original. This was said
[21:26] on the porch in the pico by Portico by
[21:29] this person. He's just pulling these
[21:30] different things and cobbling together.
[21:32] He's nothing more than a babbler or a
[21:35] seed picker who pecks around and he's
[21:37] just gathered these little bits
[21:38] together. He said he was a parasite.
[21:41] That's what they said about Paul.
[21:44] And so these things are that's why they
[21:47] called him a babbler because oh we
[21:48] recognize this. We recognize that. What
[21:50] what is he going to what little thing is
[21:52] he going to just spit out at us next?
[21:54] Let's go back to 1 Corinthians chapter
[21:56] 15 and look at verse 33. I kind of
[21:58] skipped over this,
[22:00] but he says after he's talking about,
[22:03] let me just use a phrase perhaps after
[22:05] the manner of men that if I have fought
[22:07] with the beast at Ephesus, what good
[22:10] does it do me if there is no
[22:11] resurrection? There is no resurrection,
[22:14] then live as the Epicurans, maximize
[22:16] pleasure, minimize pain. Let us eat and
[22:18] drink for tomorrow we die.
[22:21] That would be that's what the the the
[22:24] line he's on is about the resurrection.
[22:28] And then he says, "Be not deceived. Evil
[22:30] communications corrupt good manners."
[22:34] Now, this statement is widely believed
[22:38] to be taken from the play Theas by
[22:40] Manander.
[22:42] I as I've first came across this many
[22:44] many years ago, it just I've never found
[22:48] uh anyone who said that's an absolute
[22:49] fabrication and lie. They've even found
[22:51] the scrap or the fragment from which
[22:54] this is based. Manander was a Greek
[22:56] dramatist. He's best known for
[22:58] representing the the Athenian new
[23:00] comedy. I guess they had old and then
[23:02] they had medium and then they had new. I
[23:05] guess this would be Glutius Medius or I
[23:07] don't know which one it would be, but he
[23:09] wrote about 108 comedies. uh he's one of
[23:12] the most popular writers in the
[23:13] antiquity. He's very very famous, very
[23:15] popular. So in the middle of teaching on
[23:17] the resurrection, quoting Isaiah the
[23:19] prophet, he inserts this pros and when
[23:22] he does it, he maintains
[23:24] this amic uh meter, try meter I think it
[23:28] is, and he does it in such a way to
[23:29] where it's in the style of classic Greek
[23:31] and Latin poetry. He doesn't change it
[23:33] at all. He said just just exactly as it
[23:36] would appear in a poem like captain my
[23:39] captain or something that might be very
[23:40] familiar to us if somebody be to quote
[23:42] Bob Dylan and and they use it in a
[23:45] sermon it be they would say oh well
[23:46] that's just exactly the way it was
[23:48] written so it's a a manander maxim
[23:52] something that would have been common
[23:53] within the henistic Greek education or
[23:56] that someone would have known it would
[23:57] have been something that you're taught
[23:59] if I said right now I cannot tell a lie
[24:01] who would you think of Did I say it
[24:04] wrong? Who is it that chopped down the
[24:06] cherry tree? Maybe we don't learn those
[24:08] things anymore. Who said we must protect
[24:11] this house? Who is it that said that?
[24:15] Okay, I need to go a bit later. Uh, who
[24:17] said, "Are you not entertained?"
[24:25] So, it's just a it was a common phrase.
[24:28] But Manander, he was a student of
[24:31] Epicurius at Athens. So now you can see
[24:33] some of these things tied together.
[24:35] And so when he uses Isaiah,
[24:39] it's what one person called a well-tuned
[24:41] irony. He quotes Isaiah who in his his
[24:45] writing rebukes the attitude of the
[24:47] Epicurans. He rebukes uh this idea, well
[24:50] there's no afterlife, so let's just eat,
[24:52] drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die.
[24:54] And then he quotes one of their own
[24:55] students that evil communications
[24:58] corrupt good manners. This is the
[25:01] statement uh one of the ways that it's
[25:02] written. This is based on a scholarly uh
[25:05] written about 320 or 300 BC. This is
[25:07] from that theus and this is one of the
[25:10] translations. Loose bridled pest me
[25:13] thinks though I have suffered this that
[25:15] nonetheless I know to be glad to have
[25:17] her. Sing to me goddess. Sing of such a
[25:19] one as she audacious beautiful plausible
[25:24] with all. She does you wrongs. She locks
[25:27] her door. keeps asking you for gifts.
[25:30] She loveth none, but ever makes
[25:32] pretense. Communion with the bad
[25:34] corrupts good character.
[25:37] This just one translation and you'll
[25:39] find that when Paul says, "Evil
[25:41] communications corrupt good manners," he
[25:43] rebukes Epicurans and then quotes one of
[25:46] their own comedies, which then it wasn't
[25:50] they actually had situational comedies.
[25:52] Then they didn't call them sitcoms, but
[25:54] they used a way of telling a story that
[25:56] had certain exaggerations and use of
[25:58] certain themes. And he's using one of
[26:00] their own.
[26:02] Now, what principle is Paul making when
[26:04] he says, and I believe this is to be
[26:06] scripture, be not deceived. Evil
[26:08] communications corrupt good manners.
[26:09] What is it that he's the point he's
[26:11] making? Evil conversation, communion,
[26:13] friendship can be a bad influence on the
[26:16] lives and habits of men. Right. So
[26:18] there's a tremendous teaching and to
[26:20] learn about our private lives and and
[26:22] those that we associate with that if you
[26:25] uh if evil communion that communication
[26:27] there is evil fellowship a and affinity
[26:31] has the the will corrupt a good man.
[26:34] Yeah. And so Paul quotes this. He's not
[26:37] doing it to show off because he knows
[26:39] the classics or to show that he's uh uh
[26:42] knowledgeable in things that they like.
[26:44] But he does it to show an obvious truth.
[26:47] that if there is no resurrection, then
[26:50] live a h then then live as the
[26:52] Epicurans. And then he quotes one of
[26:54] their own, one that would be from their
[26:56] school. He does it to show an obvious
[26:58] truth that even they believed that you
[27:01] had to be careful what you read. They'd
[27:04] be careful what you fellowshipped around
[27:05] and what you hung out with. So just as
[27:07] he did with Heratus and Athens and
[27:08] Epimenities and Cree, it was to support
[27:11] the gospel.
[27:13] Bad company corrupts good character.
[27:18] That's a phrase that it's also
[27:20] translated to. And this statement, be
[27:23] not deceived. Bad company, evil
[27:24] communications corrupt good manners or
[27:26] bad company corrupts good character.
[27:29] Communion with the bad corrupts good
[27:30] character.
[27:32] It's also believed to be from
[27:35] Uripides.
[27:39] Uripides
[27:42] was also a
[27:45] ancient philosopher. I'm just looking
[27:48] here to see if I actually he was a Greek
[27:50] playwright in about 400 to 406 BC 480 to
[27:54] 406 BC profoundly influenced plays and
[27:58] drama even up to modern times. So he's
[28:00] one that maybe some of you if you
[28:01] studied theater or arts you would have
[28:03] come across. He's became a cornerstone
[28:05] of ancient uh literary education along
[28:08] with Homer and Manander. He was one of
[28:09] these main main guys and there are many
[28:13] known cases where manander quoted
[28:16] Uripides.
[28:18] So even though we see and read that
[28:22] manander in his drama theus quotes
[28:26] with the bad corrupts good character.
[28:29] It's possible that manander, you all are
[28:31] looking like a mule staring at a new
[28:33] gate.
[28:34] I don't know which philosopher said
[28:36] that, but it was my professor in law
[28:39] school who said it. I was like, I will
[28:40] say that for the rest of my life and he
[28:42] might have been talking about me. Who
[28:43] knows?
[28:45] But there's this concept or this idea
[28:47] that manander though he's credited with
[28:50] this and they could find this fragment
[28:51] that says it that he was probably
[28:52] quoting an earlier writer, an earlier
[28:55] play playright Uripides who said this.
[28:57] This is found on a fragment in one of
[29:00] his uh plays, his dramas. A companion
[29:02] who happens to be badly bred trains his
[29:05] companions to be like himself. While a
[29:08] good one makes them good. Come then
[29:11] young men and make sure you seek the
[29:12] company of honorable men.
[29:16] This is good. This is good teaching.
[29:19] So evil communications in one place
[29:21] another writer said evil communications
[29:22] says Uripides corrupts good manners.
[29:24] This is on another fragment, an ancient
[29:26] fragment. So when Paul is teaching on
[29:30] correcting the Corinthian church, uh as
[29:32] a matter of fact, I'm just going to
[29:33] spare you a lot of the details in this,
[29:36] but even Paul and how he's addressing
[29:38] the Corinthian church, he's drawing even
[29:41] from another play, the these symbolisms
[29:44] and these plays that was written by
[29:46] Manander that even in these first
[29:47] several chapters dealing with the sexual
[29:49] sin and the perversion within the
[29:51] church, he's using elements from their
[29:53] own sitcoms
[29:56] and And he's pointing certain things
[29:58] out. There's even one where in this one
[29:59] drama play, I'm not sparing you the
[30:01] details. How do you like this? You
[30:02] pulled it right out of me. Where the the
[30:04] the one who has suffered this great
[30:06] offense within his household says, "If
[30:08] not even something that I should name or
[30:09] speak of." And when Paul says it, it's
[30:11] ought not to even be named amongst the
[30:13] Gentiles.
[30:14] And to one who'd be there at Corinth,
[30:16] Manander wrote a lot of his plays were
[30:18] situated and based in Corenth. So this
[30:21] is this is just like somebody coming
[30:22] here to Arizona and talking about the
[30:24] Diamondbacks.
[30:26] or the Phoenix Suns or whatever else
[30:28] talking about Saros and and the Wild
[30:30] Wild West and Tombstone and quoting
[30:32] Wyatt Herp, we all be like, "Oh my
[30:35] goodness, who is this guy?"
[30:41] And so
[30:42] he takes us right in the middle of his
[30:44] sermon. He quotes
[30:48] Uripides.
[30:50] Now let's look at Acts 26 12-15. And
[30:54] this might seem to be a real hard left,
[30:56] but it connects together. You'll already
[30:59] see from here,
[31:01] this steals my thunder. But whereupon as
[31:04] I went to Damascus with authority and
[31:05] commission from the chief priest, Acts
[31:07] 26 12-15, at midday, O king, I saw in
[31:11] the way a light from heaven above the
[31:12] brightness of the sun, shining round
[31:14] about me, and them which journeyed with
[31:16] me. So here he is, the sun shining, this
[31:19] bright light as this brightness of the
[31:21] sun comes. And when we were fallen to
[31:23] the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto
[31:24] me and saying in the Hebrew tongue.
[31:29] So he attributes the language that is
[31:31] used by Christ to be in the Hebrew
[31:33] tongue. Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
[31:36] me? It is hard for thee to kick against
[31:38] the pricks. And I said, Who art thou
[31:41] Lord? Now Paul asked, Who are you,
[31:43] Elohim? Who are you, Jehovah? Who are
[31:44] you, Lord? He uses a language to suggest
[31:46] that this would be to a Jew, the Lord.
[31:50] He's not he's not uh he's not um
[31:53] Uripides.
[31:55] He's not a f he's not manander who had
[31:58] just appealed to some other Greek god or
[32:00] mythology. Who's the god of the sun and
[32:02] who's the god of this and who's the god
[32:03] of that? He says who art you lord and he
[32:05] says I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
[32:11] Quite a event for this prophet the the
[32:13] messenger to the first age the one who's
[32:15] going to be so key to the gospel going
[32:17] to the Gentiles. But Jesus says, "It is
[32:20] hard for thee to kick against the
[32:21] pricks." To kick against the pricks is a
[32:24] direct quotation from a play by Uripides
[32:29] the Bakkey I think is how youak. Bakus
[32:32] Bakus is who we think about the god of
[32:34] wine I think is who he is. But in this
[32:37] particular play, it's a tragedy. He
[32:39] recounts the Greek myth of the king of
[32:42] thieves who persecutes the son of Zeus,
[32:45] Deionis.
[32:47] And in this play I want you to hear this
[32:49] is the son of god
[32:52] Deionis and this is what the play says.
[32:54] This is written in the 400 BC. Behold
[32:58] God's son is coming to this land of
[33:00] thieves even I Dionus.
[33:03] So this is the story begins with him
[33:05] coming to this foreign land as the son
[33:08] of God. And it describes him as this is
[33:12] the translation God's true son in
[33:14] fullness God.
[33:17] says, "Of him, the God of heaven is he,
[33:19] a born in majesty. Ye hath yet hath he
[33:22] mirth in the joy of the earth. He's the
[33:25] joy of the earth, and he loveth
[33:27] constantly her who brings increase, the
[33:29] feeder of children, peace." Now, if I
[33:32] didn't tell you I was reading
[33:35] from
[33:37] Greek mythology or this play by
[33:39] Uripides, you might have thought that
[33:40] that was a hymn we sing during Christmas
[33:42] time.
[33:44] But in this Greek tragedy, stick with
[33:46] me. Stay awake.
[33:50] Don't fade off now because if you do
[33:51] now, you're going to leave me out on a
[33:53] limb. Stay very close to this. In the
[33:56] story, the son of God, the son of Zeus
[33:59] comes and he's half man, half God.
[34:04] He comes and he disguises himself and he
[34:06] challenges this king
[34:08] of thieves who has been and he and he
[34:12] he's persecuted by him.
[34:16] So this son of Zeus comes and is
[34:19] persecuted
[34:20] and he says to this king in his
[34:23] discourse, it's better to yield him,
[34:26] this god prayer and sacrifice than kick
[34:28] against the pricks since these is God
[34:31] and thou but mortal.
[34:34] He tells this king, "It would be better
[34:37] for you to give praise and honor and
[34:39] worship the immortal one, you as a man,
[34:42] than to kick against it." Right. In Acts
[34:45] chapter 9:es 4 and 5, we read this. And
[34:48] he fell to the earth and heard a voice
[34:49] saying unto him, "Saul, Saul, why
[34:51] persecutest thou me?" And he said, "Who
[34:53] art thou, Lord?" And the Lord said, "I
[34:57] am Jesus." I know you're very, very
[34:59] familiar with this telling. You're very
[35:01] familiar with what it means. Paul had
[35:02] been persecuting the church. And Jesus
[35:06] identifies himself with the church. He
[35:08] says, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
[35:10] It is hard for thee to kick against the
[35:13] pricks.
[35:14] If I could put it this way, in Acts,
[35:16] Jesus exposes Paul as his persecutor,
[35:19] right? You are the one, you're the
[35:21] earthly one who's persecuting who you
[35:24] now realize is the Lord, the immortal
[35:26] one, the Messiah, and he's the one
[35:28] that's kicking against the pricks. in
[35:31] Uripides play the persecuted god is
[35:33] deionis
[35:35] and his persecutors that that king
[35:37] pianthus
[35:40] and what's interesting here is that the
[35:42] very
[35:44] this is what just in studying it some
[35:46] have noted that Jesus uses the same
[35:48] plural kick against the pricks that
[35:51] uripidities needed and used to match the
[35:54] traditional meter that he was using in
[35:57] his play like the poet
[36:00] we could quote something and We could
[36:01] quote uh the Psalm of Life and we might
[36:03] just change a little bit because we're
[36:05] just using it as an example, but Jesus
[36:08] uses it in the same plural form that
[36:11] Uripides did because he had to to make
[36:14] it fit his style. And Jesus is quoted in
[36:17] the even in the Hebrew tongue is
[36:18] repeating it.
[36:22] And in the drama, it's the son of Zeus
[36:25] who's being persecuted,
[36:27] who declares to the mortal king who's
[36:29] per doing the persecuting. It's hard to
[36:31] kick against the pricks. And now Jesus
[36:35] is quoting this. This is brother Aaron,
[36:38] still the same one you knew a month ago.
[36:41] That might be your point at which this
[36:42] is when things begin to change. Goes out
[36:44] of town for a little bit, comes back
[36:45] from Amsterdam. What was he doing at a
[36:48] coffee shop in Amsterdam? Right? He said
[36:51] this is very it's getting got really
[36:52] weird now but I'm still the same brother
[36:54] Aaron just stay with me and he now Jesus
[36:59] the son of God
[37:02] is the one being persecuted
[37:04] and he quotes
[37:06] a play from 400 BC
[37:12] in that playus
[37:16] is imprisoned
[37:19] by this earthly king and he breaks free
[37:23] destroys the palace by earthquake
[37:27] and at that time of this this releasing
[37:31] this so the the maids are calling who
[37:33] are you who are you and he says don't
[37:36] fear it's me and they say our god is in
[37:39] the house ye maids adore him so now if
[37:43] somebody ever singing he's in this house
[37:44] and we don't like them we could just say
[37:46] that's just a pagan mantra from a Greek
[37:49] tragedy Our
[37:51] God is in the house. You maids adore
[37:54] him. Adore him.
[37:57] Very interesting. In Acts chapter 16
[37:59] verses 25 to 28. And at midnight Paul
[38:01] and Silas prayed and sang praises unto
[38:02] God and the prisoners heard them. Paul
[38:04] was bound in chains in a prison and
[38:07] suddenly there was a great earthquake so
[38:10] that the foundation of the prison were
[38:11] shaken. Immediately all the doors were
[38:13] open and everyone's bands were loosed.
[38:15] And the keep of the prison awake out of
[38:16] his sleep. and seeing the prison doors
[38:18] open. He drew out a sword and would have
[38:19] killed himself. Supposing the prisoners
[38:21] had been fled. But Paul cried out with a
[38:22] loud voice, "do thyself no harm, for we
[38:25] are all here."
[38:27] This very image that you see, maybe just
[38:29] purely by coincidence, very image that
[38:31] you see of this Greek tragedy. Now, life
[38:34] is unfolding in reality.
[38:37] And Paul is released from prison by a
[38:39] great earthquake. The one whom he said,
[38:41] "It pleased God to reveal himself in
[38:43] me." the one is going to be bringing the
[38:47] gospel himself be persecuted.
[38:51] And it begins with perhaps maybe to Paul
[38:55] having the Lord, the Messiah, quote to
[38:57] him a Greek tragedy.
[39:03] Now, I want to try to wrap this up in a
[39:06] way that'll make
[39:08] put us all at ease.
[39:12] If I could say it this way, there were
[39:13] many philosophers who seemed to be very
[39:15] close to the knowledge of God but yet
[39:16] were ignorant.
[39:19] There's even uh even a quote I think
[39:22] that was used in the homeschool group on
[39:24] their yearbook which was a quote a quote
[39:25] of Plato that said the end of life is to
[39:27] be like God.
[39:29] And we read that through our
[39:31] understanding but yet Plato was not a
[39:33] Christian could not have been a
[39:36] Christian.
[39:38] And so there was philosophies and there
[39:40] was desires and there was seeking and
[39:42] there was searching. It was in the heart
[39:43] of man to seek after truth and to know
[39:45] their maker and to make sense of life.
[39:47] But not all of them had the benefit of
[39:49] God revealing himself
[39:51] in using actually using prophets and
[39:54] making himself known. So until Christ,
[39:58] God had never made himself known to the
[40:00] Gentiles like he did to Israel.
[40:03] He was in nature and he could be known
[40:06] in the sense that there has to be
[40:08] something beyond ourselves. They could
[40:09] have sensed the divine. They wrote about
[40:11] it. They saw some sort of theme. They
[40:12] called it a numa, this power that
[40:14] existed within materials. And they had
[40:16] this idea of what that might have been.
[40:18] Then you had this knowledge and this
[40:20] truth. And there was all these different
[40:21] ideas that the Greeks are trying to use
[40:23] to explain the reason why they're on
[40:25] earth. Whereas the children of Abraham
[40:27] are like, I know why we're here. I know
[40:29] how this all happened. God created the
[40:32] heavens and the earth and then his son
[40:34] uh the wife the the woman sinned and
[40:36] then we've been cast out of the garden
[40:37] and this and they could trace it all the
[40:39] way back to Abraham. They had a pretty
[40:41] good idea and on the authority of the
[40:42] one true God why they were there and
[40:44] what they were living for and looking
[40:45] for. That's why the Gentiles lived in
[40:48] the vanity of their mind and their
[40:49] imaginations trying to figure it all out
[40:50] because they weren't given that
[40:52] understanding.
[40:53] Amen. But the time of the Exodus in
[40:56] Exodus 6:es 2 and 3 says, "And God spake
[40:59] unto Moses and said unto him, what was
[41:01] he?" "I am come down." He says, "I am
[41:05] the Lord.
[41:07] And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac,
[41:09] and unto Jacob by the name of God
[41:11] Almighty.
[41:12] But by my name Jehovah, was I not known
[41:15] to them." Very curious statement,
[41:18] especially if you find that that name
[41:21] was seemingly being used. But God is
[41:24] saying, he's making this point in the
[41:25] Exodus that I am the Lord, and I've made
[41:30] myself known to your fathers Abraham,
[41:32] Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty, but
[41:35] now I want to reveal myself in a way
[41:38] that they have not known.
[41:41] Genesis 15:7 to Abraham, he said to him,
[41:44] I am the Lord. That means Jehovah the
[41:47] existing one.
[41:49] That's how he had beun to reveal himself
[41:52] to Abram.
[41:54] I am the the the Lord that brought you
[41:57] out of the Caldes to give this land to
[41:59] inherit it.
[42:01] Then where does it start? Genesis 1:1.
[42:03] In the beginning, God.
[42:07] Who art thou Lord?
[42:10] In the beginning, God. Elohim. Strong
[42:13] one. L All Allah. He's bound by an oath.
[42:18] Elohim. L Allah. This is the one in the
[42:20] very beginning.
[42:23] The use of the phrase Elohim. It puts
[42:25] God in relationship to mankind. He as
[42:28] the creator. He as the sustainer.
[42:31] He might have been embodied in a
[42:32] multiplicity of Greek gods.
[42:36] polytheism and and many different ideas
[42:38] of the sun and the moon and heat and
[42:40] fire and energy and all these things
[42:42] that people try to make sense of it all.
[42:44] But now you have one who in the
[42:46] beginning created it all. He's the
[42:47] creator of mankind in the world in the
[42:49] cosmos in all the stars and he's the one
[42:52] who's the sustainer and the provider of
[42:56] it says in Genesis 2:4 that it's in the
[42:58] day that the Lord God made the earth and
[43:00] the heavens Lord Jehovah God Elohim
[43:02] Jehovah Elohim this self-existing one
[43:08] comes from that Adonai from Havah the
[43:10] God who becomes he wants to be expressed
[43:12] he wants to be made known
[43:15] let's just put it this way we would all
[43:16] been Greek Greek philosophers.
[43:18] If somehow we found ourselves with form
[43:20] and thought and God had never
[43:24] revealed himself or spoke whatsoever,
[43:28] we'd all be going, "What what does this
[43:30] mean? What does that mean?" We'd all be
[43:31] philosophers.
[43:33] We'd all be sophist. But he says, "I am
[43:36] the self-existing one. I am the Lord who
[43:38] reveals himself." Not just a God, not
[43:41] just a deity, but one that wants to
[43:44] become personal.
[43:47] The Greek spoke of their gods and wrote
[43:49] their plays as ways of explaining the
[43:53] history of the earth as a way of
[43:55] explaining the origin of their society
[43:57] and their civilization. They told these
[43:59] stories, but yet none of them have ever
[44:01] had seen these things or experienced
[44:02] these things. There was no god of
[44:05] Jupiter or of Saturn. There was no
[44:08] actual goddess. There all these
[44:09] mythological attributes that are
[44:11] attached to them. It's just their way of
[44:12] trying to say this is how we got here.
[44:14] This explains this happening. This
[44:15] explains that happening.
[44:18] Says in Genesis 17:1, "The Lord appeared
[44:21] to Abram." He said, "I am the Almighty
[44:24] God. Walk before me and be thou perfect.
[44:26] Unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he was
[44:28] the name of God Almighty. I am the
[44:30] Almighty God." It says, "The Lord
[44:32] Jehovah appeared. He made himself known,
[44:35] caused himself to be seen, to be known
[44:37] by Abram, the Almighty God, El Shadai,
[44:40] the breasted God. He identifies himself
[44:42] as the strength giver. The one who
[44:45] nourishes.
[44:47] In other words, one who's intimate.
[44:48] Come, let me nourish you.
[44:53] In Genesis 12:7, it says the Lord
[44:55] appeared unto Abram. And it says he
[44:58] built an altar unto the Lord who
[45:00] appeared unto him.
[45:03] Abram before this is an idol worshipper.
[45:06] We see that in even in the book of
[45:08] Joshua. tells us descendants.
[45:14] He was from a a family of idol
[45:16] worshippers, a descendant of Shem.
[45:20] But now when he's worshiping idols, it's
[45:22] no different than Isus,
[45:25] no different than a uh any other Greek
[45:28] goddess or Greek mythology or god of the
[45:30] eastern or Buddha or any one of them.
[45:34] But when God makes himself known, Abram
[45:36] builds an altar to worship the God who
[45:38] revealed himself.
[45:41] That's what he said. We ought not to
[45:43] think of God as likened unto silver,
[45:46] stone, and gold fashioned by man's
[45:48] devices. Because to the Greeks, they
[45:50] believed that there was this numa. There
[45:52] was this power within gold and silver.
[45:55] There was some sort of energy. Be very
[45:57] careful what kind ofqi
[46:01] you're trying to seek to heal yourself.
[46:04] Because there's a mystical I thought of
[46:06] idea that well there's this this
[46:08] universal life force and it's it's just
[46:11] as much darkness as any of these other
[46:13] mythologies. There's one true God who is
[46:16] in all. There's one God who created all
[46:18] things. There's not some other life
[46:21] force or energy that we just need to tap
[46:22] into that just makes us all one. Right?
[46:26] You hear me? Just we're all in this
[46:28] together.
[46:31] He says, 'But by my name Jehovah was I
[46:33] not known to them.' What is he saying?
[46:36] At the time of the Exodus, there's now a
[46:38] fulfillment of God's promise. I'm going
[46:39] to reveal myself in a way that you
[46:41] didn't know me before.
[46:45] Everything that you've previously heard
[46:46] and believed in
[46:49] is formed your expectation, has given
[46:51] you things to believe. But now I want to
[46:54] reveal myself and it ought to click
[46:56] everything that I made myself known
[46:57] before as the almighty God. Now I'm
[47:00] going to show you in a way that I before
[47:01] wasn't known, but it's harmonious with
[47:03] this revelation of myself. Now God in
[47:06] the manifestation of Yahweh, now in the
[47:08] name of Jehovah, by the name of Jehovah
[47:10] was I not known. Now in this
[47:12] manifestation, he's going to fulfill the
[47:14] promise and the hope that the almighty
[47:16] God had given to their fathers.
[47:19] Think of the the philosophers who
[47:21] wrestled with these questions and the
[47:22] ideas. They became the father of
[47:23] civilization. They became the father of
[47:25] these religions and these thoughts. And
[47:27] these people had all these things in
[47:28] their mind. And God was saying, I it's
[47:30] not that they had no truth at all. But
[47:32] now I want to reveal myself in a way. I
[47:35] want to become the Lord God, not some
[47:37] mythology, not the unknown God.
[47:40] Because God's power had not been fully
[47:42] manifested. He had not fully manifested
[47:45] the promise
[47:47] and the covenant to them. But now he's
[47:49] going to do it. He says, "I was known
[47:51] this way, but now I'm going to be made
[47:53] known."
[47:55] I see a similar pattern in how that Paul
[47:57] is approaching
[48:00] the Gentiles. I see a similar pattern in
[48:02] how brother Brandham approached
[48:03] Leodysia.
[48:06] He preached the same gospel Paul
[48:07] preached. No wonder they called him a
[48:10] babbler.
[48:11] No wonder they accused him of being a
[48:13] plagiarizer and having nothing original.
[48:15] He had to follow the pattern. He had to
[48:18] do it. Maybe even against his better
[48:21] judgment. Maybe against what his wishes
[48:22] were. You might say, "Well, couldn't I
[48:24] just do this and can't I just run it
[48:25] through AI and completely change it to
[48:27] where it doesn't sound like anything and
[48:28] nobody could figure it out?" No, he did
[48:30] what he was called to do.
[48:32] And to the sophist, to the philosophers,
[48:34] to the debaters, to the arguers,
[48:37] he's just a babbler,
[48:39] a parasite, a plagiarizer, just like
[48:43] Paul.
[48:47] In John 1:1 it says, "In the beginning
[48:49] was the word and the word was with God
[48:52] and the word was God."
[48:55] We all know what that word is there. In
[48:57] the beginning, God was
[49:00] the logos.
[49:02] Some say logos, but I say logos just to
[49:05] be different. Lego my ego, tomato,
[49:09] tomato, whatever it is. In the beginning
[49:11] was the word was the logos.
[49:14] The concept or idea of logos was not
[49:17] something that was familiar. It's a
[49:18] Greek word, New Testament, written in
[49:21] Greek. This was not a word that's used
[49:23] in the Old Testament. It's not a thought
[49:25] or an idea that a Jew would have used.
[49:27] And as a matter of fact, a Jewish
[49:28] philosopher tried to take this idea of
[49:31] logos and marry it with Judaism. And it
[49:33] just kind of made it even worse and kind
[49:35] of an an entrapment to Christians. But
[49:37] the logos was a concept in Greek
[49:39] philosophy traced back to the 6th
[49:41] century BC.
[49:44] Heracletus, Heraclitus, I think the one
[49:47] that we mentioned in the beginning
[49:50] lived about the same time as the prophet
[49:52] Isaiah. He is known for coming up with
[49:56] this idea of the logos or logos. And he
[49:59] believed that the logos designated that
[50:01] rational structure or ordered
[50:03] composition of the world. He's like
[50:05] there's order, there's symmetry, there's
[50:07] laws and it must be some logos, some
[50:10] thought.
[50:12] And the Greeks thought the logos caused
[50:14] the order of the world that it was
[50:16] stabilizing and directing the principles
[50:18] of the universe. To Plato, he called it
[50:20] the idea of ideas. To the Stoics, it
[50:24] would have been this impersonal reason,
[50:25] this reason, this enlightenment that
[50:27] we're all trying to attain to. And if
[50:30] you go back to I'm going to try to sum
[50:32] up centuries of Greek philosophy.
[50:37] Uh, and I'm I'm going to try to do it in
[50:39] a way that gives honor to it or at least
[50:42] is is right. And I'm just trying my best
[50:44] to say this to really sum this up. In
[50:46] the beginning was the logos. To the
[50:48] philosophers and to the Greeks and to
[50:50] the Gentiles, they saw light as truth,
[50:53] right? And their philosophies revolved
[50:56] around these terms of light and
[50:58] darkness. Darkness was ignorance, a lack
[51:00] of knowledge, barbaric.
[51:03] That to come to truth was enlightenment.
[51:04] As we mentioned before, there was this
[51:06] process of coming out of darkness into
[51:08] light. Coming out of darkness and
[51:09] ignorance and you don't know and being
[51:10] taught and being skilled and being
[51:12] trained and coming to light. It's the
[51:14] Greeks, it's the philosophers that use
[51:16] the language of what we might say in the
[51:17] message, Peruia or Peruia or Fanner,
[51:20] Epiphania. The very words that we as
[51:22] believers, if I preached in a thunders
[51:24] meeting, I'd have said be seated. Be
[51:25] seated. Be seated.
[51:28] Why? because it's a language now that we
[51:30] associate with the gospel, the Peruseia
[51:32] of Christ, the Epiphany of Christ, the
[51:33] Phanto,
[51:35] the apocalypse, the revelation. Woo! And
[51:38] Bob, the Greeks over there going, "Yes,
[51:40] yes, yes. I heard that back in the day."
[51:44] Or is it George? Yeah, he's the one that
[51:46] makes the good Greek food.
[51:49] It's the very language of the
[51:51] philosophers.
[51:53] And so there is a criticism that is
[51:55] lodged against Paul. Paul, they say
[51:57] there's many that believe he hijacked
[51:58] the gospel of Christ. Christ came
[52:00] talking about the kingdom of God a and
[52:02] and the Messiah. And then Paul comes
[52:05] just saying, "Nope, it's about the it's
[52:07] about the uh the Lord Jesus Christ as
[52:09] savior and the church." And people like
[52:13] they they can't make it fit. So they
[52:15] just believe Paul was an antichrist.
[52:17] Hijacked the gospel, stole it away from
[52:18] the Jews, turned it into henistic
[52:22] uh theology and mysticism, and that's
[52:24] all it is is Greek mythology. rebranded.
[52:32] Plato's allegory of the cave
[52:37] in the Republic. It becomes like this
[52:38] basis for them trying to understand why
[52:41] you train, why you teach, why you why we
[52:44] try to use these, why we have the these
[52:46] methods of discovering things and
[52:48] discussing things and ethics. He
[52:49] describes all of mankind as being
[52:51] prisoners chained in a cave
[52:54] who are watching these figures flash on
[52:58] the wall and they mistake these shadows
[53:01] created by man-made fire for reality.
[53:03] The shadow is the truth of the reality.
[53:05] And in the allegory of the cave, he says
[53:07] only this painful
[53:09] ascent out of the cave into the sunlight
[53:13] reveals truth. Reveals true forms. He
[53:16] uses the idea of forms.
[53:19] So to all the Greeks
[53:21] kids taught in school
[53:24] and to the and think of how vast that
[53:26] empire was and how much it was
[53:27] assimilated into Roman theology and
[53:29] belief and talking. So this whole
[53:31] civilization, western civilization holds
[53:33] at its core through its education, its
[53:35] academics, its rationale, its daily
[53:38] thinking in the vanity of their mind,
[53:39] they have this philosophy that we're all
[53:42] living in a cave and we're living in
[53:44] darkness and we're beholding just forms
[53:46] from man-made light in that what we need
[53:49] to do is escape from the darkness to the
[53:51] sun and that seeing the sun will know
[53:54] true form in reality.
[53:58] And I say, well, what Paul did is he
[54:00] just took that allegory of the cave and
[54:02] he made it Christianity
[54:04] when the allegory of the cave was
[54:06] already prophesied in Isaiah.
[54:09] At the very time Heracitus is saying uh
[54:12] uh not Hercules if that helps you
[54:14] Heraclitus or Heracles or whatever it is
[54:17] as at the very time that he's forming
[54:19] these ideas of the logos and he's
[54:22] forming these ideas as we read earlier
[54:24] about evil communication or about you
[54:26] know let eat drink let's be merry when
[54:28] actually it's uh the beast of Ephesus
[54:30] rather and as he's forming these
[54:32] thoughts and he's forming these ideas at
[54:34] the very same time can't remember which
[54:36] it is but one is dying as the other
[54:38] one's coming on the scene Isaiah says in
[54:40] Isaiah 42 6 and 7, I the Lord have
[54:43] called thee in righteousness and will
[54:44] hold thy hand and will keep thee and
[54:47] give thee for a covenant of the people
[54:49] for a light of the Gentiles. Now, why
[54:52] would he be said to be a light for the
[54:54] Gentiles if the Gentiles already had
[54:56] light? Why would they need that light if
[54:58] the Gentiles themselves had already
[54:59] figured out that we're in a cave and
[55:01] only through rigorous training and
[55:02] discipline and education can we get out
[55:04] of that cave to see true forms? He said,
[55:06] "For a light to the Gentiles, to open
[55:08] the blind eyes, to bring out of the
[55:10] prisoner, bring out the prisoners from
[55:13] the prison and them that sit in darkness
[55:15] out of the prison house. H maybe they
[55:19] stole it from Moses.
[55:22] Maybe they stole it from Isaiah. Maybe
[55:25] they're the parasites.
[55:27] Regardless of how you might want to make
[55:28] it a battle and who wins this rap
[55:30] battle, listen, the truth is the very
[55:33] thing that the Gentiles accepted as
[55:35] truth and were experienced in reality,
[55:36] God had already pro prophesied the
[55:38] mystery of God was not a messiah to the
[55:41] Jews, but a husband to the Gentiles.
[55:46] You were going to be a light of the
[55:48] Gentiles. Why? Because they're in
[55:49] darkness.
[55:51] to bring the prisoner out of the cave,
[55:54] out of the man-made shadows into the sen
[55:58] light
[56:00] in Isaiah 49:6. And he said, "Brothers,
[56:02] you could come to your instruments." He
[56:04] said, "It is light. It is it is it is a
[56:06] light thing that thou shest be my
[56:09] servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob
[56:11] and to restore the preserved of Israel.
[56:14] I will also give thee for a light to the
[56:17] Gentiles, that thou mayest be my
[56:19] salvation under the end of the earth.
[56:22] So, it wasn't just Jews that would come
[56:23] to it.
[56:25] The Gentiles would come to the light.
[56:28] It's almost as if that prophecy,
[56:32] that election, that ordination, this I I
[56:35] may be getting the weeds here. Uh,
[56:37] Brother Ellie is here. If I go too far,
[56:38] just tackle me.
[56:40] But we know God watched out over our
[56:43] lineage. He's watched out over the seed
[56:47] that to bring you here as the elect of
[56:49] God. And we're Gentiles. We're not
[56:51] traced back to to Jews, right? We're
[56:54] Gentiles. Could it be our very election
[56:58] and our genes as it passed through
[57:01] Western civilization?
[57:03] Was the very thirst and hunger in the
[57:05] minds of Plato and Socrates? We're all
[57:07] very smart, so that doesn't stumble us
[57:08] at all. if it was coming from these
[57:10] great men. But this truth and reality
[57:12] that the sunlight would shine into the
[57:15] darkened soul of a gentile. And it's
[57:17] that very thing that created the crave
[57:19] and the question in their own hearts to
[57:21] say, "Are we but brute beast gathered in
[57:23] the darkness of a cave, guessing
[57:26] speculating at this movement by man-made
[57:28] light?
[57:29] But what we need to do is escape out of
[57:31] this prison house into the sunlight."
[57:36] And so while the the mystics and the
[57:38] philosophers are studying the logos, God
[57:41] is making himself known to a prophet and
[57:44] he's telling Isaiah
[57:46] that there I will be a light. There's
[57:48] going to be a Messiah. There's going to
[57:49] be a Christ who will be a light to the
[57:50] Gentiles.
[57:52] He'll bring him out of prison. It's
[57:54] going to be a salvation to the ends of
[57:55] the earth.
[57:57] Isaiah 60:3. And the Gentiles shall come
[58:00] to thy light
[58:02] and kings to the brightness of thy
[58:04] rising.
[58:06] No matter how close the mystics and
[58:08] philosophers got, Paul couldn't stay
[58:10] away from the truth that we were all in
[58:13] that cave. We were all in that prison
[58:16] house and the so light was shining and
[58:19] Paul was saying, "I know a way out."
[58:23] And he used a language that for those
[58:25] Greeks who thought that maybe they were
[58:27] in the light. And he said, "But you
[58:29] still worship him ignorantly, saying to
[58:31] the unknown God, how is it you can claim
[58:33] the benefit of true form when I can show
[58:36] you that you are still yet in darkness?"
[58:41] [Music]
[58:42] The Bible is true.
[58:46] And no matter how much they try to pick
[58:48] at it and pick at it, I have uh I have
[58:53] downloaded and read many but I'd say
[58:56] over a hundred different scholarly
[58:57] articles on the subject of the Greek
[59:01] classics and Greek literature and the
[59:04] Bible in the New Testament. And the more
[59:07] I read it, the more giddy I get to be
[59:11] standing on the solid rock of the
[59:14] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[59:17] And it should give us a little bit more
[59:19] courage with what we believe
[59:21] for us. You've got the answer to the
[59:23] devil's question
[59:25] to the point to where we can say, "I
[59:26] have the answer. Now, what's your
[59:27] question?" Right? We have the answer.
[59:31] The answer is Jesus Christ. The same
[59:33] yesterday, today, and forever. God, help
[59:35] us to accurately
[59:37] express that answer. The world is
[59:40] riddled. They're trying to figure it
[59:42] out. And no matter what theology or idea
[59:45] that someone has, I believe that God can
[59:48] give you light
[59:51] that can shine on their darkness and say
[59:54] the very thing that you're missing is
[59:56] what you'll find in Jesus Christ. Let's
[59:59] stand together. Just pray together this
[1:00:01] evening.
[1:00:02] Heavenly Father, as we close this
[1:00:04] service, I'm so appreciative of the the
[1:00:07] perseverance upon the people's part to
[1:00:09] listen, to reserve judgment.
[1:00:12] Lord, even as some have expressed that
[1:00:14] there's certainly
[1:00:16] subject matter and things that are
[1:00:18] addressed that could cause pause or
[1:00:20] maybe be triggering for some, but
[1:00:23] they've just been patient waiting on you
[1:00:25] for you to come and
[1:00:28] give that understanding.
[1:00:32] And Lord, I pray that we could recognize
[1:00:34] that this Bible is not just some
[1:00:38] something cobbled together by man. And
[1:00:40] it's a living
[1:00:42] powerful work of your art
[1:00:46] that you saw fit to write the story of
[1:00:49] the children of Israel and the story of
[1:00:51] the creation of the earth, the story of
[1:00:53] the Christian church
[1:00:56] in such a way to where every single
[1:00:58] individual
[1:01:00] elected of God could find their identity
[1:01:03] in it
[1:01:05] and it could speak to us and we could
[1:01:07] learn from it and grow from it. I pray
[1:01:09] Lord that it would continue to become a
[1:01:11] new book to us. Lord, I pray that this
[1:01:14] exercise for these last three services
[1:01:16] has not done anything to shake anyone's
[1:01:17] faith.
[1:01:20] That it has not done anything to
[1:01:23] unreasonably open the door into
[1:01:25] mysticism or fables or mythology.
[1:01:29] But I trust that if you have been
[1:01:30] gracious
[1:01:32] and even long-suffering and protective
[1:01:36] that what will reach the hearer's ears
[1:01:38] and what will be deposit in their hearts
[1:01:40] is this strong conviction
[1:01:42] that you will
[1:01:44] watch out over your word
[1:01:48] and that you will take the situation
[1:01:51] that we're in and use a language that we
[1:01:53] can understand to show us the way.
[1:01:57] I pray that you bless your people
[1:01:58] tonight for their longsuffering,
[1:02:00] for their patience as well.
[1:02:03] May they enjoy the remainder of their
[1:02:05] week as we commit ourselves to you.
[1:02:08] Thank you for these things, Lord, that
[1:02:09] we can look into. Thank you for the the
[1:02:11] grace that's given to be able to explore
[1:02:13] these these things. Lead me, Lord, as a
[1:02:17] minister to speak those things which are
[1:02:19] beneficial.
[1:02:21] as I take interest in their lives, Lord,
[1:02:23] may we find that that thought of God,
[1:02:25] that heart of God
[1:02:28] to encourage them, to nourish them, to
[1:02:30] meet them in the challenges that they're
[1:02:31] in day by day. We love you. We ask this
[1:02:33] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:02:35] Amen.
