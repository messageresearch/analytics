[0:00] I'm going to move through some of this
[0:02] quickly and I
[0:03] just I'm just obeying the Lord this
[0:05] morning and what he would the direction
[0:08] he'd have us go uh just trusting and
[0:11] yielding unto him so just stay stick
[0:13] right with me and if you if you have
[0:15] something that you hear that the Lord
[0:16] really you believe spoke to you well
[0:18] then just amen amen the word of God and
[0:21] clap your hands raise your hands do
[0:23] something but just Identify say Lord I
[0:25] know that was directly for me and Moses
[0:28] said unto the Lord notice this here thou
[0:31] sayest thou thou sayest this is what the
[0:33] Lord said bring up this people this is
[0:36] verse 12 now is not let me know whom
[0:38] thou will send with me yet thou has said
[0:41] I Know Thee by name and thou has also
[0:43] found Grace in my sight so Moses comes
[0:46] to this place in his life and it's a
[0:49] very interesting spot that he gets to
[0:51] the prophet of God tells us at this
[0:53] point he's 80 years old I want you to
[0:55] get a picture of him as a man a beard uh
[0:59] you know hanging hanging down all the
[1:00] way to his waist he's an 80-year-old man
[1:03] and his bald head brother brandham said
[1:05] is shining his hair is around his neck
[1:07] and and he could say Lord I I'm 80 years
[1:10] old uh my back is stiff I I I got
[1:13] arthritis in my hands and I got all
[1:15] kinds of hindrances I I'm not an
[1:18] eloquent man the Lord has called him to
[1:20] something he's equipped him for a job
[1:22] you know most of the time when the Lord
[1:24] calls you to something is when you feel
[1:27] the most inadequate to do what the Lord
[1:29] has told you do most of the time the
[1:31] Lord will wait to call you until you
[1:33] realize that there's nothing in yourself
[1:36] to bring to pass what God has called you
[1:38] for and often times that's when you're
[1:40] the most equipped for the job is when
[1:42] you feel the least equipped for the
[1:45] job and so he could say Lord I'm not an
[1:47] eloquent man I I can't speak very well
[1:50] but the Bible says he comes to this
[1:53] place and the scripture uses this word
[1:55] that he's on Holy Ground I want to say
[1:58] some things to you this morning and and
[2:00] just to just to some principles I could
[2:02] just lay out to you that you know this
[2:04] place that he comes to of Holy Ground is
[2:06] not necessarily a 4x4 square of a place
[2:10] of the earth that we could go find today
[2:12] and stand and say it would be holy but
[2:15] rather I want you to look at it this way
[2:16] that this place he comes to is actually
[2:19] a condition or a a spot in his own
[2:24] life and so he takes off his shoes the
[2:27] God God tells him Moses take your shoes
[2:30] off because the place where you're at
[2:33] the spot you've came to and and the the
[2:36] spot where you're at in your life the
[2:37] current condition this every moment in
[2:40] your life little did Moses know that
[2:42] everything he had went through in his
[2:44] life as a little boy from the time he
[2:46] was born all the way through Pharaoh's
[2:48] house he's in the Nile River and a
[2:50] basket picked up and you know what
[2:52] Moses's entire life and all the events
[2:54] that unfold and you know life is all
[2:57] about a journey and your life is at this
[2:59] point where you're at today on this
[3:01] Sunday morning because you're at a
[3:02] certain spot in your journey some of us
[3:04] at different places different ages
[3:06] different groups different pressures all
[3:09] different kind of circumstances and some
[3:11] of us may be dealing with medical issues
[3:13] this morning I know I'm in a group where
[3:15] we live in bodies that are broken down
[3:17] some may be in financial hardship some
[3:19] may be in marital distress some may be
[3:21] in raising teenagers and I pray for you
[3:24] in a special way if you are and you're
[3:26] at a really tough spot in your life and
[3:28] you're wondering you know Lord but let
[3:29] me just say this the same God that was
[3:32] with you when he found you and he saved
[3:34] you and cleaned you isn't he the same
[3:36] God who's in with you in every spot and
[3:38] journey every Crossroad every pressure
[3:41] every circumstance yeah it may feel like
[3:43] it's getting harder but as it gets
[3:45] harder his grace just gets
[3:48] greater and so he comes to a crossroad
[3:51] this is a spot in his life and you know
[3:54] Junctions in life are a very important
[3:56] thing and God brings to certain certain
[3:58] Junctions and and certain spots in our
[4:00] life you could almost look at it like
[4:03] dispensational changes that happen in
[4:06] your life and and and different spots
[4:08] where you just know that the the rhythm
[4:10] of your life is a little different and
[4:11] something's changed and and that maybe
[4:13] you're at a different season of life and
[4:15] I believe that's how God grows us as by
[4:17] season it's not always a Happy Time Life
[4:20] is actually a life full of trouble and
[4:22] trials and tribulations and and
[4:24] sometimes you're up and sometimes you're
[4:26] down and I don't care so you may kid
[4:28] yourself today and say I'm always up
[4:30] well let me drink what you're drinking
[4:32] because I'll be honest I'm not always up
[4:35] sometimes I'm down sometimes I'm
[4:37] encouraged sometimes I'm discouraged
[4:39] sometimes I feel like I'm success
[4:41] sometimes I feel like a absolute failure
[4:43] to the to to God if I'd be honest this
[4:45] morning I felt God more times than I'd
[4:48] tell you this morning I wouldn't admit
[4:49] it to you how many times but I just tell
[4:51] you I felt him more times than I've
[4:53] pleased
[4:54] him if you'd be honest you'd say
[4:57] Amen but notice I want you to know
[4:59] notice that he gets him to this place
[5:01] it's a certain condition that he brings
[5:03] Moses to it's a certain spot little does
[5:06] he know that every moment in his life up
[5:08] to this point has been made and laid and
[5:11] laid out before him everything he's went
[5:13] through every trial every hardship every
[5:17] circumstance has brought him to this
[5:19] place of Holy
[5:22] Ground prophet of God says he takes off
[5:24] his shoes that's a special thing he
[5:27] takes off his shoes and a sign of
[5:29] humility
[5:30] and he and he says it's a the same place
[5:32] that the Apostle Paul comes to and
[5:35] brother bam says he falls down onto the
[5:38] ground and he kisses the ground as it
[5:41] was Moses takes off his shoe Paul falls
[5:44] to the ground the prophet says John the
[5:47] Baptist uh says I'm not even worthy to
[5:50] to loose the shoes on his
[5:52] feet so what is it speaking of what is
[5:55] this Condition it's a condition of an
[5:58] absolute recognition
[6:00] of self and that there's nothing good
[6:03] within
[6:05] me it's a place he gets him to to where
[6:08] he realizes I'm not worthy to be called
[6:11] I'm not worthy to be here I'm not worthy
[6:14] to be anointed for the job that the Lord
[6:16] has for me Paul falls on his face John
[6:19] says I'm not even worthy to to unloose
[6:22] his shoes prophet of God said what was
[6:24] this place of Holy Ground it was a place
[6:27] of humility well friends if I could just
[6:30] I'm feeling so inspired this morning
[6:33] just for myself if this is for nobody
[6:34] it's for brother Matt this morning but
[6:37] I'm just so struck by the words of God's
[6:39] Prophet when he says I want you to
[6:41] listen closely be
[6:43] conscience of your
[6:46] littleness amen be conscience of your
[6:51] littleness this is where God brings
[6:53] Moses to he's questioning I'm ating my
[6:57] back hurts I've got arthritis God waited
[6:59] till this
[7:00] moment God waited till Abraham was 99
[7:04] years old you ever follow that
[7:07] 99% it's 99% dead it's 99% over it's
[7:11] pretty much the end of all things is
[7:13] that the very God sometimes brings you
[7:15] to the very
[7:17] Brink and then he brings a
[7:20] change and he says I I'm n I'm 80 years
[7:23] old my back hurts I've got arthritis but
[7:26] the prophet says be conscience of your
[7:28] littleness of who who you are stick your
[7:30] finger in a bucket of water then pull it
[7:32] out and watch it just go back to where
[7:34] it was you'll find the hole that you put
[7:36] your and the water is now gone and and
[7:38] brother brandom says that's you you're
[7:40] nothing when you get to this place to
[7:42] where you realize you'll not be missed
[7:44] after a while they have a funeral for
[7:46] you they'll bury you uh but after a
[7:48] little while you're gone and life will
[7:50] move on and and Seasons move on they'll
[7:52] have a funeral possession but that's the
[7:54] only thing about you the prophet says
[7:56] let me just admonish you this morning
[7:58] the only thing that that will remain as
[8:00] your influence and the impact of your
[8:03] character in your life of the things you
[8:05] stood for of the things that you press
[8:07] for of your passions that's what will
[8:09] make an effect amen not your eloquence
[8:13] not your good looks not your not your
[8:16] gifts not your talents those are all
[8:17] wonderful but they'll soon be
[8:21] over be conscient so he comes to this
[8:24] place of Midian it's incredible journey
[8:27] you could type in the life of Moses as
[8:28] he comes to this place where God has
[8:31] called him and he's anointed him and now
[8:33] Moses is having this conversation Lord
[8:36] you've said you've called me and you
[8:38] said you've chosen me and you you said
[8:40] that I found Grace in your sight but
[8:42] you've not even shown me Lord who's
[8:43] going to go and I'm not an eloquent man
[8:46] and and and he's looking all inwardly
[8:48] and introspectively he's looking at his
[8:50] life but you know God brings him all the
[8:52] way through the Journey and all the way
[8:54] from Egypt and and now he brings him to
[8:57] this spot of Midian and in Midian Moses
[9:00] learns how to be a
[9:01] Shepherd he learns how to be a leader
[9:03] and brother bam says in those 40 years
[9:05] it doesn't record that God did anything
[9:07] for Moses doesn't even record that he
[9:11] spoke to
[9:12] him so it's 40 Years of Silence listen
[9:15] sometimes friends I'll just be honest
[9:16] with you we can label Silence from the
[9:19] devil but sometimes silence is from the
[9:22] Lord and let me say it this way
[9:24] sometimes in the silent moments of your
[9:26] life when it seems like God is doing
[9:28] nothing and sometimes the greatest
[9:30] workshop and the greatest Factory and
[9:32] the greatest building that God and you
[9:34] say I don't feel it I don't sense him I
[9:36] don't hear him take courage today that
[9:38] sometimes God is equipping you for the
[9:41] job that's laying ahead of you and let
[9:44] me say this friends everything you go
[9:46] for is just an equipping for what lays
[9:49] next you ought to grab a hold of that
[9:51] this morning you ought to by faith say I
[9:54] believe that Lord Jesus everything is
[9:57] led up to this point it's it's it's at a
[10:00] it's he's at a place and maybe he
[10:01] doesn't realize that that God is
[10:03] actually equipping him you know before
[10:05] God ever calls you to something he
[10:08] equips you for the
[10:09] job and brother Brandon would say it
[10:11] this way that a life before God ever
[10:13] places a life in the world he anoints
[10:16] that life he anoints it for the job he
[10:19] anointed Samson's life before he was
[10:21] even born he's anointed for a purpose
[10:24] and in fact that anointed in Samson's
[10:26] life never
[10:28] left say well he loved god well he went
[10:30] on sinning the anointing in his life
[10:32] never left because an anointing that God
[10:35] brings is the equipping whether you
[10:36] yield to that or not is up to you but
[10:39] it's an equipping for your life for the
[10:41] job oh my brother my sister I take
[10:43] courage to say Lord whether I feel like
[10:45] it or not you've equipped me for the for
[10:47] the things that are laying ahead of
[10:51] me so Moses says Lord I want you to
[10:54] catch this Lord I I believe what you've
[10:57] said about me you know it's never the
[11:00] problem for a Believer for a True
[11:04] Believer questioning the word you it's
[11:06] never the word that you
[11:10] question it's never the word it's never
[11:12] the promise you don't say I don't you
[11:14] know I just not sure not so sure about
[11:17] that I'm just not so sure I believe that
[11:19] sounds good you know it's never Moses
[11:22] wasn't questioning what God Said a
[11:24] Believer doesn't question it's never the
[11:26] problem questioning the word or what the
[11:29] word has spoke the problem comes down to
[11:32] who the word spoke
[11:34] about because we never as a Believer
[11:36] have trouble believing the word that's
[11:38] what believers do that's what brother
[11:39] brandom said Believers believe that's
[11:41] what they'll do that's what believers do
[11:43] it's never you questioning the word it's
[11:45] you questioning the
[11:48] vessel that the Lord wants to
[11:51] use and so that's where the Log Jam
[11:54] comes from Moses he says Lord I believe
[11:57] the word I believe what you've
[11:59] spoken but but are you
[12:02] sure me
[12:05] Lord
[12:06] me do you know me Lord like I know
[12:16] me are you sure Lord I believe the word
[12:19] I'm not doubting it today I'm not
[12:21] questioning it today but Lord who I'm
[12:23] doubting if I'd be honest I'm doubting
[12:26] me
[12:27] Lord
[12:29] are you sure God I I I I'm not
[12:32] questioning the word today Moses could
[12:35] say uh but I've came to a spot in my
[12:38] life that I've got to know that I know
[12:42] that I know that it's not just something
[12:44] I hear it's not just something the
[12:46] pastor preaches it's not just something
[12:48] I try to mentally accept but I've got to
[12:51] know that I know that I know that
[12:53] there's a that I have found Grace in
[12:55] your sight that you have called me by
[12:58] name that you have have chosen me it
[13:00] can't be Mom or Dad's Revelation I'm
[13:02] asking today I'm at a spot of
[13:04] desperation Lord I want to know that I
[13:07] know that I know that I found Grace in
[13:09] your sight Lord you see it's one thing
[13:12] for you to confess what the word says
[13:14] it's another thing it's one thing for
[13:15] you to confess what the word says about
[13:17] you it's another thing to believe what
[13:19] you
[13:20] confess
[13:22] hello brother bam deals with Georgie the
[13:25] sister at Georgie Carter's church and
[13:26] that one little sister who died died of
[13:28] a pend and he says sister and now
[13:30] brother brandom I believe with all my
[13:31] heart and brother he said sister I can
[13:33] tell you right now you don't believe you
[13:35] hope but you don't really believe
[13:37] there's a very big difference say
[13:39] brother Matt well how do I get that
[13:40] there's only one way to get it God has
[13:42] to reveal himself personally to
[13:45] you and so he's saying Lord I I've just
[13:48] came to this spot in my life I'm not
[13:50] questioning your word I'm not doubting
[13:53] you Lord I'm not questioning your
[13:54] promise Lord but if I'd be honest it's
[13:57] me that's that's where I'm having the
[13:59] trouble is I know what person I am I
[14:02] know who I am I know the failures that I
[14:05] have I'm well acquainted with not the
[14:07] picture I put on at church and not the
[14:09] the you know the image that I give to
[14:11] everybody else but I know myself I know
[14:13] lord inside of me I'm full of fears and
[14:16] I'm full of problems and I'm full of
[14:18] issues and I I'm full of mistakes and
[14:21] I'm full of failures can anybody be
[14:22] honest today say Lord It's not the word
[14:25] that I'm doubting it's it's me Lord It's
[14:28] Me
[14:30] today and I understand he says Lord I've
[14:34] got to find notice this here if you just
[14:36] keep your Bible open Exodus 33 he says
[14:38] Lord I I want to know that you've you've
[14:43] that I've found Grace in your
[14:45] sight you see Moses knew that finding
[14:48] Grace in his sight was more than just
[14:51] hearing it it was more than just seeing
[14:54] it it was more than just knowing as he
[14:56] said the acts but he wanted to know his
[14:59] ways he wanted to be a personal presence
[15:03] in my life notice verse four and God
[15:06] says my presence shall go with thee and
[15:10] I will give thee rest let me just preach
[15:13] here for a moment friends if you know
[15:16] the presence of God if you say Lord I
[15:18] let let me just say today there's only
[15:20] one thing that'll bring true rest from
[15:22] God there's only one thing that'll
[15:25] really bring real rest to a Believer and
[15:27] that's the presence of God you'll never
[15:30] know rest until you know the
[15:34] presence and friends I'm not talking
[15:36] about an emotion I'm not talking about a
[15:38] goosebump I'm not talking about a
[15:40] feeling those are wonderful to feel the
[15:42] presence of God in your flesh but I'm
[15:43] talking about a knowing that you know
[15:45] down inside of your soul you'll never
[15:48] know the true rest of God until you know
[15:51] the presence of God you can have this
[15:53] Bible you can have a good church you
[15:55] have a good wonderful Pastor one of the
[15:57] best preacher in the message you can
[15:59] have some of the best music you can have
[16:01] some of the greatest gifts you can have
[16:03] some of the greatest talents have some
[16:05] of the best parents in the world but let
[16:07] me just say this you'll never know
[16:10] rest until you know
[16:13] him and it's not in a sermon it's not
[16:16] necessarily in a Bible it's not in a
[16:18] church service but it's him it's it's
[16:22] him and I just stop here today and raise
[16:24] my hand and say I want to know him I
[16:27] don't just want to know about him I want
[16:29] to know him this morning I I want to
[16:31] know him personally down inside of my
[16:33] soul Moses was convinced that without
[16:37] God's presence in his
[16:40] life then
[16:42] everything everything all of his ritual
[16:45] all of his dress code all of his cliches
[16:47] all of his speech he realized that if he
[16:50] didn't have the
[16:53] person are you with me here today if he
[16:56] didn't have the person then it was all
[17:00] just a man-made effort to be good or
[17:05] moral or
[17:10] holy it gets to such a
[17:15] place he gets to such a place and he
[17:17] says Lord I know you've called me but
[17:20] I've called you Moses I know you've said
[17:22] that Lord my presence will go my
[17:23] presence will go I know you said my
[17:25] presence will go Moses I I you found
[17:27] Grace and I know Lord Lord I know you
[17:29] said that it was all good it was all
[17:30] great I believe all of it but I want to
[17:32] make sure that today you hear me Lord I
[17:34] want to make sure that you hear what I'm
[17:36] saying to you if you don't
[17:40] go Lord if you don't go then don't even
[17:46] send me
[17:51] amen if you don't go Lord if you don't
[17:54] go Jesus oh can I just preach can I have
[17:56] Liberty this morning let me just say
[17:59] this the presence of Jesus I'm quoting
[18:01] from God's Prophet is the lifeline of
[18:04] the church listen there's a lot of
[18:07] things that'll produce life good
[18:08] programs produce life produces a lot of
[18:10] uh you know stimulation it produces a
[18:12] lot of good people it can give you even
[18:14] of good atmosphere could bring joy and
[18:16] happiness uh good songs and good singing
[18:18] will bring that in your life uh let me
[18:20] just say this but without the presence
[18:22] of the person of the word you can have
[18:24] all your teaching you can have all of
[18:26] your speaking you can have all of your
[18:27] charisma you can have all of the the
[18:30] greatest gifts you can have the greatest
[18:31] preaching you can have the greatest
[18:33] service you can have the greatest things
[18:35] in in life friends but let me just say
[18:37] this today you've got to have him this
[18:39] morning you've got to have the personal
[18:41] person of his presence and I say God let
[18:44] my Christianity be filled with the
[18:47] fullness of the presence of Jesus Christ
[18:50] don't let it be a dress code Lord don't
[18:52] let it just be a lifestyle that I live
[18:55] let it be a reality in my heart oh how
[18:57] many would identify and say Lord I'm in
[19:00] a spot in my life where I could say I'm
[19:02] in desperation I'm done with
[19:04] churchianity I'm done with religion I'm
[19:07] done with cliches I'm done with just a
[19:09] lifestyle I want to know him in the
[19:12] power of his
[19:17] resurrection unless your Christianity
[19:19] has the presence of God this may get
[19:21] Stern but let me just say it the way the
[19:23] lord gave it to me andless your message
[19:26] lifestyle and all of your code and all
[19:29] of your acts and all of your history and
[19:31] all of your home and whoever wherever
[19:33] you came from and how many years you've
[19:34] been here how many years you've
[19:36] professed it unless the presence of a
[19:38] real living God and the anointing of the
[19:41] Holy Spirit and the shout of the king
[19:44] backs up your
[19:47] life then it's nothing more than a
[19:50] manmade effort to be
[19:54] holy can I just be honest friends what
[19:57] do we
[19:59] [Music]
[20:00] have what do we have if we don't have
[20:05] him
[20:06] am see that's so simple brother Matt oh
[20:09] let it let it be simple to you it's
[20:11] profound to me unless we have him in the
[20:16] personal presence unless his anointing
[20:19] and real reality of the Holy Spirit
[20:22] backs up my life and my testimony and my
[20:25] home unless I have the peace that passes

[20:30] your home you don't have to settle for
[20:32] dysfunction in your family you don't
[20:34] have to settle for a home that's
[20:36] disjointed and a home that's fussing and
[20:38] fighting and arguing and stressful and
[20:40] the devil might have sold you that lie
[20:42] but you don't have to settle for it
[20:44] today you can have a peace in your home
[20:47] that passes understanding you can have
[20:49] teenagers you can have a home that's in
[20:52] [Music]
[20:55] order unless you go oh Lord don't even
[21:01] send
[21:06] me say brother Matt then what do you say
[21:09] then I say let the presence of
[21:12] God go with me amen he said if you don't
[21:16] listen to this verse
[21:18] 15 If thy presence go not with me carry
[21:22] us not up
[21:27] h
[21:30] in other words Lord if you don't
[21:34] go I'm not
[21:38] going did you hear me God might have
[21:40] said that real sheepishly the first time
[21:42] and the more he said it he got more
[21:44] Brave I want to make sure you heard me
[21:46] God I want to make sure it's clear if
[21:49] you don't go I'm not
[21:53] going you know in life sometimes we can
[21:56] get to the place to where we're stuck
[21:59] we can get to a spot in our life even in
[22:01] I don't care if you're born of the
[22:03] spirit of God you can get to a place if
[22:04] you'd be honest and throw off your
[22:06] religiosity you'd be honest to say I can
[22:08] get to a place in my in my life with the
[22:10] Lord Jesus to where I'm stuck you know
[22:12] sometimes people can get in a rut and
[22:14] it's the devil's desire to put you in a
[22:16] rut it's that you ever been in a rut
[22:19] ever been I know here if you do any kind
[22:20] of four-wheeling or anything out in the
[22:22] out in the these kind of wilderness you
[22:23] can get in a rut really quick and that
[22:25] tire would just Spin and spin man you
[22:27] could have all the the gasoline you
[22:28] could give it all the gas and you know
[22:31] sometimes the more gas you give it the
[22:32] further down you go and the more energy
[22:34] you put behind it the deeper in the Rut
[22:37] that you sink and the more you try to
[22:39] build it up and the more you try to Pump
[22:41] It Up and the more you try to pep it up
[22:43] and you try to move it listen friends
[22:44] that's not how the holy can I just say
[22:46] today that's not how the holy spirit
[22:47] moves it doesn't move by a work by some
[22:49] working something up he doesn't move he
[22:51] doesn't move because we chant or that we
[22:54] we try to we listen friends God's God
[22:56] only moved based upon one thing there's
[22:58] a repentant heart that's in desperation
[23:00] for the Holy Spirit
[23:03] am and you get stuck in your life now
[23:05] listen I'm just obeying the Lord here

[23:13] really going backwards you you're not
[23:15] really going forward you're sort of in
[23:17] that Circle you know just that
[23:18] roundabout of life you ever been in that
[23:21] just that roundabout you know sort of
[23:22] like the roundabouts the traffic circles
[23:24] that they have did you know that the
[23:27] purpose of that roundabout is it's not
[23:29] to go round and round and round and
[23:33] round the purpose of the roundabout is
[23:37] to get off the
[23:39] roundabout and you get people who go in
[23:42] a circle and they go in a you know
[23:43] unless you're not from there and you
[23:45] come to Buford and there's roundabouts
[23:46] and people look at you and they're honk
[23:47] and the horn and that what in the world

[25:09] for that that's not what your life is
[25:11] about that might be what their life is
[25:13] about but you were Anointed with a
[25:15] purpose and your life is called to go
[25:17] somewhere I'm not made for this world to
[25:20] go in a roundabout my life is all headed
[25:22] to a direction it's got a purpose it's
[25:24] got a calling and I say to you today if
[25:27] you're on the roundabout get off the
[25:29] roundabout this morning get on the line
[25:32] of redemption my brother and my
[25:35] sister you weren't made for that
[25:37] Circle Holy Spirit stopped me this
[25:39] morning and said Somebody's on a circle
[25:41] and you're going to tell them get
[25:44] off so I say to you in the name of the
[25:46] Lord if you're in that Circle get off of
[25:49] the roundabout and get on the line of
[25:54] redemption give you a little nugget here
[25:56] the Book of Ruth and and judges were
[25:58] originally one book Wen it separated in
[26:00] the Jewish Hebrew Tanakh you'll read
[26:02] that they're one book Hebrews and and
[26:04] judges and Ruth you know what judges is
[26:06] all about it's all about going in the
[26:07] circle in a circle and while the the
[26:10] while the while the prophet lived the
[26:11] people serve God then when the prophet
[26:13] died they went down Prophet lived they
[26:14] serve God then the prophet died they
[26:16] went down the prophet God rose up
[26:17] another savior another judge and and
[26:19] they would serve God then they then they
[26:21] died then they'd stopped serving God and
[26:23] they went around and around and around
[26:24] you know what though the Book of Ruth
[26:26] was not about a circle it was about a
[26:28] line of redemption it was about a
[26:30] promise and a place she was going oh my
[26:32] brother I hope you see it today you
[26:34] there are some people that's let me just
[26:36] preach there are people that are just
[26:37] called to go around and around and
[26:39] around but that's not your place and
[26:41] that's not my calling I'm called to a
[26:43] line of redemption and I say God if I've
[26:46] been trapped into the circle let me get
[26:48] off the circle this morning let me get
[26:50] on the path and see a vision how many
[26:53] here would say Lord let me catch the
[26:55] vision for my life let me call me to the
[26:58] purpose you've placed me for Lord
[27:03] Jesus Moses gets to this place and he's
[27:06] questioning
[27:08] everything in his
[27:11] life he questions
[27:14] everything I I want you to catch it my
[27:16] brother my sister uh Moses is in a place
[27:19] of
[27:21] desperation you know God
[27:25] will whether you ask him to say it the
[27:29] way the holy spirit's telling me to say
[27:31] it whether you ask him to or not whether
[27:35] you want him to or
[27:36] not the Lord will orchestrate and push
[27:40] buttons and flip levers in your life to
[27:44] get you to
[27:49] desperation and sometimes we don't even
[27:51] realize that the pressures that we F and
[27:54] the moments that we F to where we have
[27:56] pressure and feels like like we're
[27:57] surrounded by the flood of the enemy let
[28:00] me say a lot of times that's god pushing
[28:03] the buttons and pulling the levers and
[28:06] turning the wheel and flipping your
[28:08] vehicle four or five times to where God
[28:10] finally gets your attention and you get
[28:13] to a place and say oh God I'm not even
[28:15] saved do I even have that I ever even
[28:17] know you Lord you don't realize
[28:19] sometimes God moves things and shifts
[28:21] things in your world to produce
[28:24] desperation out of your
[28:26] life
[28:28] that was for
[28:30] somebody he's questioning
[28:33] everything he's saying Lord I today I'm
[28:36] like
[28:38] Jacob today Lord I if I'd be honest here

[28:44] for a moment throw apart Throw Down The
[28:49] Mask put a put put put apart your masks

[28:57] put our facade off of how how you know
[28:59] of how good you know the image that we
[29:01] put before people you never get help
[29:03] from a doctor sitting there saying there

[29:24] not put together I fail the Lord more
[29:26] times than I'm willing to admit I'm a

[29:33] life I need your grace in my life I'm
[29:36] humble enough to say Lord I've failed

[29:43] my life Grace come and envelop my
[29:47] body notice what his testimony is

[30:55] shall it be known that
[30:57] I and thy people have found Grace in thy
[31:02] sight notice is it not that thou goest
[31:06] with us then he's question mark notice
[31:08] after the question mark so shall we be
[31:11] separated I and thy people from all the
[31:14] people that are upon the face of the
[31:16] Earth so shall we be separated you know
[31:19] what Moses is doing those weren't
[31:21] Moses's words right amen hello somebody
[31:26] in other words Moses had spoke his own
[31:28] thought up to this point but now he
[31:29] starts quoting what God
[31:32] Said now he starts repeating what God
[31:36] had told him when he caught him in the
[31:37] first place oh my brother my sister you
[31:40] could shout on that here for a minute he
[31:42] starts quoting the word of God back to
[31:47] God he starts saying so how listen shall
[31:50] so shall we be separated I and thy
[31:53] people uh from all the people that are
[31:55] upon the face of the Earth no notice

[31:59] anyone know that I'm yours and these and
[32:01] your people are your people unless you
[32:02] unless you're with us Lord you know
[32:04] Moses starts repeating the words back to
[32:07] God do you understand Moses wasn't
[32:09] bragging upon himself Moses wasn't
[32:12] saying ah I'm separated Toto the Lord
[32:14] and I'm somebody and God has called know
[32:17] that it was quite the opposite that
[32:19] Moses was doing Moses was actually
[32:21] looking humbly and saying Lord I'm
[32:23] nothing you might have called me and
[32:25] said Lord but I'll be honest you might
[32:26] have got the wrong guy don't you realize
[32:28] I got arthritis I got back pain I can't
[32:30] even speak I'm not eloquent Lord you
[32:32] think you just made a big mistake and he
[32:34] starts quoting the word back to God and
[32:38] he was saying God you're the one who
[32:40] said that about me you're the one who
[32:43] promised it Lord I didn't promise it
[32:45] these aren't my words those are your
[32:48] words in other words I didn't find you
[32:51] you found
[32:53] me oh my brother my sister let me just
[32:56] preach preach to you if you're
[32:58] struggling to accept the word of God for
[33:00] your life I recommend to you today start
[33:03] quoting the word back to God and say I'm
[33:07] not the one who called me Lord I'm not
[33:09] the one who chose me I wouldn't even be
[33:11] here today if it wasn't up for you Lord
[33:13] I didn't come seeking you you came
[33:15] seeking me I didn't put myself in the
[33:17] race and I didn't start this work so I'm
[33:20] not going to be the one to finish this
[33:22] work it's going to take you and I say
[33:25] today come and finish what you started
[33:27] in my life Lord come and finish the work
[33:30] you've placed in me oh God I didn't call
[33:32] me you called me I didn't choose me you
[33:35] choose me that's your words those aren't
[33:37] my
[33:39] words I didn't promise you promised I
[33:44] didn't make a you made it to me Lord
[33:46] Jesus those are your words not my words
[33:49] Moses is repeating I'm not the one who
[33:52] said that you're my peculiar treasure
[33:54] you called me that amen you know it's a
[33:57] powerful thing when you can re recognize
[33:59] something it wasn't you who put you in
[34:01] this race it wasn't you who called and
[34:04] sought God but God sought you you know
[34:06] what that means then the pressure is not
[34:08] on me the pressure is on him who called
[34:10] me the the the listen friends can I just
[34:12] preach here for a moment listen friends
[34:14] the pressure is not on you to perfect
[34:16] you the pressure is on God to say Lord
[34:19] I've yielded I've surrendered now come
[34:21] and finish what you put in my life you
[34:24] put a desire here God I wasn't even
[34:26] seeking you but you put something inside
[34:28] of me it says I hunger for righteousness
[34:31] I thirst uh for Holiness I long for God
[34:34] I look for God I worship God because he
[34:37] called me to this and if he's the one
[34:39] who started he'll have to be the one who
[34:41] finishes if he's the one who started
[34:43] he'll have to be the one who perfects if
[34:45] he's the one who promised healing it'll
[34:47] be him who performs it if my children
[34:50] are unlost and unsaved it won't be me
[34:52] it'll take God and a promise that he
[34:54] made those are your inheritance that is
[34:57] your children that is your body not the
[34:59] devil's body it's your word Lord not my
[35:03] [Music]
[35:05] word God's saying I'm taking it off me
[35:08] and I'm putting on you who spoke
[35:11] [Music]
[35:12] it that's your word Lord that's not my
[35:15] word and you know the awesome thing
[35:18] about it it is his word and it is what
[35:21] he spoke and we don't need to question
[35:23] what he spoke we just need to believe
[35:25] what he spoke

[35:29] didn't even want to be in
[35:32] it come on
[35:34] somebody you're the one who put me in
[35:36] this race I didn't even want to be in it
[35:39] I wasn't seeking God I was going a
[35:40] million miles the wrong direction but
[35:42] someone reached down a hand in Mercy and
[35:45] picked me up out of the mud and dusted
[35:47] me off and and cleaned me off but Lord I
[35:49] struggled with you I fought against you
[35:51] but you humbled me you broke me you

[37:41] feel like the wrong candidate there's a
[37:43] lot of people who can run a lot faster I
[37:45] feel like I failed you Lord that's all
[37:46] right child it's all right I'm the one
[37:48] who called you it's not him that runneth
[37:50] it's it's not him that willth or him
[37:52] that rth it's God that showeth Mercy
[37:54] it's God that porth Grace oh can I just
[37:57] say today the only reason that I'm here
[37:59] today is by the grace of Jesus Christ
[38:02] the only reason I would have quit a long
[38:04] time ago brother if you'd be honest
[38:05] you'd admit it today and say I would
[38:07] have turned my back on it a long time
[38:09] ago but grace Amazing Grace has called
[38:13] me
[38:18] amen
[38:20] hallelujah he can come and finish what
[38:23] he started because he's not just the
[38:25] starter brother the Travis he's also the
[38:29] finisher he's also the
[38:32] perfector he's also the Builder he's
[38:35] also the maturer he's also the ripener
[38:38] he's a father he's a mother he's a
[38:40] brother he's a sister he's a friend
[38:42] whatever you need today it's in
[38:46] Jesus your answers aren't there your
[38:48] answers aren't out there your an is
[38:51] right here in the seat of God he put
[38:53] inside of you all you got to do is yield
[38:55] get it some water get in the right
[38:57] atmosphere and it'll grow amen the same
[39:00] one who started is the same one who will
[39:02] finish the race he's the starter that's
[39:05] why the prophet of God would say for
[39:06] those saints that went down in faith he
[39:09] said you know that brother who died in
[39:11] faith they also Rose in
[39:13] faith how they went to the ground
[39:16] determine how they would come out of the
[39:18] ground Oh Glory to God how they went to
[39:22] the ground how they died is how they
[39:24] come up and brother says if you die in
[39:27] faith believing that he's a Healer you
[39:29] come out of that grave in faith that he
[39:32] was a Healer if you died in faith
[39:34] believing in Jesus you'll come up in
[39:36] faith that's why job said throughout all
[39:38] the times in the darkest places of his
[39:40] life let me just say to you friends it
[39:42] got to a place for job he couldn't see
[39:44] God he couldn't feel God he couldn't
[39:47] sense God job said if I knew where he
[39:49] lived I'd knock on his door and I'd come
[39:51] to his house and I know that if I could
[39:53] find him he'd open the door and he'd sit
[39:56] me down down job says he'd speak kind
[39:58] words to me he wouldn't chastise me oh
[40:01] job got to a place where he couldn't see
[40:03] the Lord but you know what job found a
[40:05] key to his success he found a secret job
[40:08] said I go backwards and I can't find him
[40:10] I go forwards and he's not there I go up
[40:12] anybody ever felt that way I get come to
[40:14] church and I don't really I go to my I
[40:16] don't really feel it I go to work I
[40:18] prayed I I've listened but job finally
[40:20] said but here's what I know I may not be
[40:22] able to see
[40:25] him but he sees
[40:28] me and if you could grab a hold of that
[40:31] promise my brother my sister you may
[40:33] feel like you don't see him today but
[40:36] let me tell you he sees you he sees that
[40:39] trouble he sees your life he sees that
[40:42] struggle that you're going through and
[40:43] job says I know that after he has tried
[40:46] me I'll come forth as pure gold tried in
[40:50] the fire and brother bham said job went
[40:52] to the Grave with a faith to say I know
[40:55] my redeemer liveth and I shall see him
[40:58] stand upon the Earth
[41:00] Amen brother man said did that promise
[41:02] ever get fulfilled he said oh yeah oh
[41:04] yeah one day he said Jo there was job
[41:07] down in paradise and he said and here
[41:09] comes ABS Abraham and Sarah and he says
[41:11] then he says notice suddenly the scene
[41:14] changes and he said there's a there's a
[41:16] knock at the door I like to imagine it
[41:20] wasn't a
[41:21] banging that's how they knocked on
[41:23] Hell's
[41:25] door but when he knocked on Paradise I
[41:28] have a feeling it was just like brother
[41:31] Ken when a friend comes over to see
[41:35] you and he just knocks on the
[41:39] door for
[41:42] fellowship and brother bham says there
[41:44] Abraham Sarah toiling there and he says
[41:47] Abraham says did you someone at the door
[41:50] Sarah said go go let him man Abraham who
[41:53] is it imagine Abraham as he what goes to
[41:56] the door he opens the
[41:58] door and his eyes got about this
[42:02] big remember if they died and went to
[42:06] the grave in an expectation they had
[42:09] that expectation throughout eternity am
[42:12] and brother bham says his eyes get like
[42:14] this and he and he's speechless and
[42:16] there's the Lord Jesus and he
[42:22] says sarah sarah sarah come here fast
[42:27] come here Sarah that's
[42:29] him that's him that's that's the one I
[42:32] told you about that's the one that met
[42:33] me under the oak tree that day oh when
[42:36] it seemed like life had went sideways
[42:38] and it seemed like I was all the way at
[42:40] the end of my road and it seemed like I
[42:42] was always lost and I would forever be
[42:45] lost and it seemed like everything was a
[42:47] mess but then he came on the scene and
[42:49] showed up one
[42:50] day that's him and brother R says then
[42:53] Ezekiel SS up and says no no no no no no
[42:55] no you got it all wrong that's not
[42:56] that's the will in the middle of the
[42:58] will that's the one Daniel says no no no
[43:00] no no that's not you all got it wrong
[43:02] that's the rock that was Hune out of the
[43:05] mountain job says no brothers and
[43:07] sisters that's my redeemer that's the
[43:10] one I said I'll see though the skin
[43:12] worms destroy this body notice my
[43:14] brother and my sister he was something
[43:16] different to each of them but he was the
[43:19] same person he was the same
[43:23] Jesus and when I see him that day and
[43:26] when you see him that day he may be
[43:28] someone different to you than he is for
[43:30] me I may have never battled cancer and
[43:32] you might be battling today I may have
[43:34] never battled Great Depression but that
[43:36] might have been your fight and your
[43:38] struggle but let me just say this you
[43:39] can't go through what I went through and
[43:41] I can't go what you went through but
[43:43] here's the confidence I have we have the
[43:45] same father we have the same friend we
[43:47] have the same Redeemer and when I crown
[43:50] him that day I'll say that's the one who
[43:52] met me when I was discouraged and it
[43:54] seemed like there was no way way he made
[43:56] a way in my life when I was raising my
[43:58] children and I had no answers that's the
[44:00] one who met me in my prayer closet
[44:03] that's the one who healed my body that's
[44:05] the one who encouraged me when I was
[44:07] down in the depths of
[44:10] Despair that's the one when I almost
[44:13] ended my
[44:14] life that's the one I
[44:17] met that's the one who spoke to my
[44:20] mother that's the one who saved my
[44:21] unsaved loved one when I had tried
[44:23] everything in my life to get a hold of
[44:26] their soul that's the one who moved on
[44:28] the scene when I couldn't find him
[44:29] that's the one who saved my friend
[44:31] that's the one who healed my body that's
[44:33] the one who encouraged
[44:35] me he might be something different to
[44:38] you but he will be the same
[44:44] Jesus Oh can we give him a praise

[55:46] don't even know where to start and she
[55:47] just looks at him and says start with me
[55:51] preacher just start right here I'd be
[55:54] honest enough to say there might be a
[55:55] lot of prideful people but I'll be
[55:57] honest to say I need you to start right
[55:59] here lord well how many honest hands
[56:01] would just go up and say Lord start
[56:03] right here with me start right here in
[56:06] all of my unbelief start right here in
[56:09] all of my skepticism and fears and
[56:11] doubts start right here Lord Jesus
[56:15] there's nothing wrong with your
[56:17] faith in the
[56:20] word you know what let me tell you what
[56:23] Moses's problem was
[56:27] I'm going to make it very
[56:28] simple Moses had a stark
[56:33] reality that I want you to catch this
[56:36] morning say why did he struggle so hard
[56:40] to believe he's speaking face to
[56:43] face why is he wrestling and contending
[56:46] and over over and over I'm going to tell
[56:49] you why because Moses understood
[56:52] something that maybe no one else
[56:54] understood
[56:55] stood he
[56:57] knew that in his stature there was
[57:00] nothing
[57:02] special had he been a great strong
[57:04] special eloquent gifted he might would
[57:07] have put confidence in
[57:09] himself but he knew when he laid his
[57:11] head on his pillow at night he was a
[57:14] miserable
[57:17] failure this is why struggling cuz he
[57:20] knew God I'm nothing there's nothing in
[57:24] my St sture there's nothing in my speech
[57:28] there the it's not my money it's not my
[57:31] financial status it's not the family
[57:33] that I came from and the the the the the
[57:35] the Legacy that they left it's not the
[57:38] it's not my dad I don't have any special
[57:40] name to claim to to fame I don't have
[57:42] any kind of Lord you could have called
[57:44] someone else that was you know a little
[57:45] bigger little taller little Stout little
[57:48] strong more confident but I'm I'm a very
[57:50] unconfident person God I can't even
[57:52] speech Bible says he stammered with it
[57:55] he couldn't even
[57:59] talk Moses understood something that
[58:02] maybe no one else understood but it's
[58:06] something that he understood that we
[58:07] need to understand today that the only
[58:12] thing the only
[58:15] thing that made him unique and made him
[58:21] different the only thing that separated
[58:25] him from everybody else was one thing
[58:29] that God was for him
[58:35] amen the only reason he had any hope was
[58:40] that
[58:41] Jehovah was for
[58:46] him he knew that if you remove the
[58:50] presence of Jesus if you remove I'm
[58:54] going to preach
[58:55] if you strip out the atmosphere of the
[58:58] Holy Ghost and reduce this message down
[59:01] to nothing but dress codes and legalism
[59:04] and a lifestyle and long hair and long
[59:06] dresses and men who don't wear shorts
[59:08] and men who don't smoke and men who
[59:10] don't cuss those are all wonderful but
[59:13] if you remove the personal presence of
[59:21] Jesus you've lost everything
[59:26] [Music]
[59:27] I'm just going to be honest friends can
[59:29] I can I do that today I know brother
[59:31] Aaron really well and I might not say
[59:32] this other places but I I think I can
[59:34] say it here
[59:36] on do you realize when Moses could say
[59:40] Lord all the Tabernacle with all of its
[59:43] bells and all of its whistles and the
[59:44] carbuncle the onx the barrel the Sardis
[59:47] and the topaz and the Jasper and the
[59:48] golden L laid and overlaid and gold and
[59:51] all the curtains and all the perfect
[59:54] every part everything that made up the
[59:57] Tabernacle but it wasn't the beauty it
[1:00:00] wasn't the gold it wasn't even the it
[1:00:02] wasn't the any of the special precious
[1:00:05] stones that made it different the only
[1:00:07] thing that made that Tabernacle special
[1:00:10] was a little room on the very inside
[1:00:14] where the pillar of fire could come down
[1:00:17] in that little room and if you remove
[1:00:19] the pillar of
[1:00:21] fire am good
[1:00:25] hello if you remove the pillar of fire
[1:00:29] what do you
[1:00:30] have what do we
[1:00:32] have good dress code good good Doctrine
[1:00:36] yeah it's better it's good good hunting
[1:00:39] stories that's good wonderful man great
[1:00:42] good people some of the best in the
[1:00:44] world good music that's
[1:00:48] wonderful friends I hope you catch what
[1:00:50] I'm saying to you today the only thing
[1:00:53] that makes you different is that God is
[1:00:56] for
[1:00:58] you and when you lose the presence of a
[1:01:01] real Jesus you can have the best
[1:01:03] Doctrine the best teacher the best
[1:01:05] preacher the best gifts the best
[1:01:07] Sensations best
[1:01:09] [Music]
[1:01:11] emotions but when you remove the pillar
[1:01:14] of fire present tense amen I said
[1:01:19] present tense amen when you remove that
[1:01:23] you remove
[1:01:26] everything there was nothing special
[1:01:29] about him listen friends there's nothing
[1:01:31] special about you and there's nothing
[1:01:33] special about me in fact we're the
[1:01:35] opposite of what the world would call
[1:01:37] special we're what the world would call
[1:01:39] deplorable Basket Case
[1:01:41] rejects they called them Holy Rollers
[1:01:43] they called them all kinds of
[1:01:44] disparaging names do you realize it was
[1:01:47] the lineage of Cain who was special
[1:01:50] Builders of cities even musicians and
[1:01:52] great talented Seth Lin AG was brother
[1:01:55] Brandon would call them dirt
[1:01:58] dobbers they dwelt in
[1:02:00] tents they they they went from place to
[1:02:02] place they weren't the high educated
[1:02:05] they listen do you realize study history
[1:02:07] who did God reveal himself to it wasn't
[1:02:09] the eloquent it wasn't the intelligent
[1:02:11] you said brother matter is there
[1:02:12] something wrong no I'm preaching against
[1:02:13] that don't get me wrong it wasn't the
[1:02:15] the Great and the mighty it was the
[1:02:17] humble of heart the
[1:02:21] simple when he moved on a soua street
[1:02:23] what kind of people was it it was a dark
[1:02:26] brother it's a little dingy place on the
[1:02:28] side and a crossroad no one even knew
[1:02:30] but God was pouring out a spirit Upon A
[1:02:32] people when he moved upon listen friends
[1:02:35] you could take it all the way through
[1:02:36] the Bible God never declares himself to
[1:02:39] the mighty it's the weak and the lonely
[1:02:42] and the simple and but let me tell you
[1:02:45] something brother they might not have
[1:02:46] had a lot of riches and I might not have
[1:02:48] the biggest house and I might not have
[1:02:50] the best car and I might not have the
[1:02:52] fanciest clothes but I've got a promise
[1:02:55] I've got promises in the word of God
[1:02:57] I've got the peace that passes
[1:02:59] understanding oh help me preach this
[1:03:00] morning church I've got a joy
[1:03:02] unspeakable I might not have much in
[1:03:05] this life but to me I've got everything
[1:03:07] that I need I've got everything that I
[1:03:10] want I can say like David one thing have
[1:03:12] I desired of the lord it's not money
[1:03:15] it's not riches it's not fame it's the
[1:03:17] presence of God all the days of my life
[1:03:21] how many would say Lord that's what I
[1:03:23] desire today I might not have much in
[1:03:26] this life but I've got everything that I
[1:03:28] need and it's all in Jesus
[1:03:32] Christ and if we lose and if we trade if
[1:03:36] we trade if we trade the presence of
[1:03:40] Jesus for anything eloquent speech or
[1:03:45] education or emotion or for for some
[1:03:47] kind of feeling or program or some
[1:03:49] outwardly Beauty if you trade in for
[1:03:53] anything
[1:03:56] then you have no
[1:03:57] difference between you and anybody else
[1:03:59] or any church down the street you know
[1:04:02] what I say I say give me Jesus you can
[1:04:05] take this whole world you can take all
[1:04:08] of its all of its Pleasures you can take
[1:04:10] it all but give me
[1:04:14] Jesus we don't run things by a board we
[1:04:17] don't run things by denomination we
[1:04:19] don't run things by government other
[1:04:20] nations might have done that but Moses
[1:04:22] said that that's how they direct their
[1:04:23] life but we operate by one principle
[1:04:26] here and the only way to be guided or to
[1:04:28] be governed to make war or to survive in
[1:04:32] this Wasteland there's only one thing we
[1:04:34] need the presence of Jesus Christ the
[1:04:37] presence of almighty God to renew to
[1:04:40] refill to restore to rebuild to redeem
[1:04:43] it's all included in the
[1:04:48] promise
[1:04:52] am must be
[1:04:55] God for you and I say like the Apostle
[1:04:58] Paul as the musicians can come I say
[1:05:01] like the Apostle Paul what shall we say
[1:05:05] to these things I want you to put
[1:05:07] everything raise your hand I want you to
[1:05:09] put everything in that category of these
[1:05:11] things I don't care what it is in your
[1:05:13] life you got trouble raise up a hand
[1:05:15] you've got stress raise up a hand if you
[1:05:17] don't don't raise your hand and I'd love
[1:05:18] to be you but if you got pressure in
[1:05:20] your life raise up a hand say God I'm
[1:05:22] just going to admit it right here these
[1:05:24] are these things I've got troubles I've
[1:05:26] got trials I've got problems I've got
[1:05:28] weaknesses I've got failures come on
[1:05:30] I'll eventually hit your button I've got
[1:05:32] Pride I've got jealousy I've got malice
[1:05:34] I've got bitterness I've got lust I've
[1:05:36] got all sorts of things going on in my
[1:05:38] life I've got pressures on every side
[1:05:41] I've got fears in my heart I've got
[1:05:43] anxieties of spirit I've got the devil
[1:05:45] attacking my home I've got him attacking
[1:05:47] my mind I got him attacking my marriage
[1:05:50] what shall you say to these things if
[1:05:53] God be for you then tell me who can
[1:05:56] really be against you if God be for you
[1:05:59] nothing can stop you I said nothing can
[1:06:03] stand in the way the prophet of God said
[1:06:05] the word of God on the mouths of
[1:06:07] believing Christians has never
[1:06:10] failed if God before you then tell me
[1:06:15] who can be against you
