[0:01] I want to just spend a few minutes and I
[0:03] I know that we're limited here and I've
[0:05] got a lot on my plate so we're just
[0:08] going to read um I sent you one brother
[0:10] John uh uh most recently called Changed
[0:13] Das sub the most recent one if you could
[0:16] display that one okay good so brother
[0:18] Brandon spends a lot of time and we're
[0:21] going to read just a lot here so I just
[0:23] want to take a moment to just uh recap
[0:27] not so much from what we preached but
[0:29] maybe recap uh this thought that I've
[0:31] titled being changed and as we spoke to
[0:34] you on Wednesday there's something
[0:36] inside of you that takes place
[0:40] supernaturally and it has to be
[0:42] Supernatural that changes you completely
[0:45] amen we used that phrase last Wednesday
[0:48] that there's a part of you that
[0:50] everything changes but there's a part of
[0:52] you that one day will change but is in
[0:54] the process of being changed right now
[0:57] and the that's why the Bible would Paul
[1:00] the Apostle Paul would say things like
[1:01] add to your faith uh add to your virtue
[1:04] knowledge and let this mind which was in
[1:06] Christ also be in you and so there's
[1:09] something that of necessity and I can't
[1:11] emphasize this enough if we could say
[1:14] anything that there's got to be
[1:17] something Supernatural that changes your
[1:19] soul and it changes the man who's in the
[1:22] control room from that first nature
[1:24] carnal that sold under sin to a new
[1:28] nature that Paul calls in Romans at the
[1:30] law of the spirit and so as I spoke even
[1:33] to a man even recently a cousin of mine
[1:36] who our lives separated completely at 12
[1:39] 10 or 11 years old somewhere in there
[1:41] grew up with him was one of my closest
[1:43] friends and just was a real just a real
[1:45] bosom buddy of mine and our life went
[1:48] different directions my family moved
[1:50] maybe even younger nine or 10 years old
[1:52] and my life went a different way his
[1:54] life went a different way my family
[1:56] moved to stayed away and we lost
[1:58] communication lost contact and then
[2:00] years elapse and I'm older married
[2:03] children and I've wondered throughout
[2:05] this entire time what ever happened uh
[2:07] to my cousin and and it never was able
[2:09] to connect with him he's never on any
[2:11] kind of social presence like Facebook
[2:13] where I could ever uh look him up knew
[2:15] his family but never seen him would try
[2:17] to ask how he's doing but just almost
[2:19] completely lost communication with him
[2:21] until maybe just two weeks ago I get a
[2:24] email uh to our church website and it's
[2:26] a plea for a cry for help saying uh my
[2:30] and we grew up as best friends and and
[2:32] we grew up together and and I've seen
[2:34] the direction that God has taken in his
[2:36] life and I want to talk to him about my
[2:38] direction and so I gave him immediately
[2:40] took his number and called him and then
[2:42] we're catching up and reminiscing about
[2:44] life and um G sending him pictures of my
[2:47] children and he's telling me about his
[2:48] life and his family and his children and
[2:50] and I'm just watching the way that two
[2:52] lives two paths that were once so
[2:54] closely uh intertwined and taken two
[2:57] different ways and and it just wasn't
[2:59] very long long after just the catching
[3:01] up that immediately I could just hear
[3:03] the tone of his voice change and he just
[3:05] said I I've got to have help I'm my life
[3:08] is is going the wrong direction and and
[3:11] and and he said I've got this thing in
[3:13] my life it was an addiction to alcohol
[3:15] and he became a complete alcoholic and
[3:17] he starts telling me his life how that
[3:19] he's uh you know that he's very private
[3:21] person and he wouldn't you know I'm not
[3:23] going even going to mention his name
[3:25] today CU this was just something he told
[3:26] me and he said I don't I don't share
[3:29] this he said I've I just want to tell
[3:31] you you know we haven't talked in so
[3:32] many years he said I'm I'm very
[3:34] successful in life he started to tell me
[3:37] his income very very successful uh
[3:40] engineer and and just to told me I've
[3:42] got the you know the nicest cars and the
[3:44] nicest vehicles and I've got boats and
[3:47] ATVs and we take vacations and and I've
[3:49] got a lot of money I I I've got a good
[3:52] job I've got a good career I've got
[3:54] everything you could ever want in life
[3:56] he said but inside I'm I'm so broken
[3:59] inside because there's an emptiness
[4:01] inside of me and it just begin to
[4:03] express the condition of ma of a man
[4:06] who's not born again who's unregenerate
[4:08] who's uh you can you can and he starts
[4:10] telling me just expressing to me how
[4:12] that he said I'm I'm disciplined in my
[4:14] life and I I wake up every day and and I
[4:17] I'm up at 5:00 a.m. and I'm off to the
[4:19] gym and and I put in my exercise and I
[4:21] eat right I'm healthy and I'm I've I've
[4:24] I'm I'm you know very militant in the
[4:27] way that I treat life I'm very uh dis
[4:29] iined and very you know have my life in
[4:31] order and he said but there's this one
[4:34] part of me that I and he just begins to
[4:35] cry and be break down and he says
[4:37] there's this part of me that's so broken
[4:39] because I can't get control of it and it
[4:43] has control of
[4:45] me yeah and so his mind's just going
[4:48] both ways because he says i' I've
[4:49] brought my body subject but why can't I
[4:52] get over this one thing in my life and I
[4:54] just begin to tell him I said there you
[4:56] you have to understand there's a part of
[4:58] you that you were born a slave to that
[5:01] you were born already subservient to a
[5:04] master and Until you realize there's a
[5:07] nature inside of you and I don't care
[5:09] how much you discipline your life I
[5:11] don't care how militant you are I don't
[5:13] care how much by grit will and
[5:15] determination and and just human
[5:18] strength you try to bring your you try
[5:20] to bring your life subject there will
[5:22] always be a part of your heart that is
[5:25] slave to a
[5:27] master and until you're set free from
[5:30] that Master and until God changes
[5:33] something in you it's just in incredible
[5:35] to me so let me just stop here and say
[5:37] to you that I can't emphasize this
[5:40] enough that there must come something
[5:43] inside of your soul that supernaturally
[5:48] transforms who you
[5:50] are true and so even we we're going to
[5:53] deal with that just for a moment but but
[5:56] let me just say it at the onset brother
[5:58] brandom called it a paradox we read this
[6:00] in the message on Wednesday night and
[6:02] brother the prophet of God's dealing
[6:04] with the boy and he's trying his best to
[6:06] overcome it you remember that and he
[6:08] says but until he's born again until he
[6:11] receives the spirit he's trying his best
[6:13] to overcome it he'll never overcome it
[6:16] Christ will have to overcome it and he
[6:18] says and when he does it'll be a perfect
[6:23] Paradox how that a man born of a woman
[6:26] born of a mother born of a father with
[6:29] all the their complexes and strains in
[6:31] those families and now this boy is made
[6:33] up of all of The Faults and failures the
[6:36] good and the bad and he's made up of all
[6:38] those things and he's trying his best to
[6:40] overcome it brother bham says but when
[6:42] he when Christ comes into his heart
[6:45] it'll be a perfect Paradox what is a
[6:47] paradox something that can't be but it
[6:51] is I want to show you even after you're
[6:54] born of the spirit of God there still as
[6:56] we said a part of you that's being
[6:58] changed listen to what brother brandham
[7:00] says and he carth for you in Phoenix
[7:02] 1960 so if man he was made to want to be
[7:05] comforted so then if he doesn't accept
[7:08] God's way then he'll take a way for
[7:12] himself he'll try to substitute
[7:14] something to take the place of the holy
[7:17] spirit thank you all I want you to
[7:19] listen to it a man or woman that will
[7:20] not accept the Holy Spirit the comforter
[7:23] will try to comfort themselves with some
[7:27] violent substitute that Satan will
[7:30] present to them that's what I begin to
[7:33] tell my cousin you don't realize there's
[7:35] something inside of you greater that's
[7:37] longing for something higher there
[7:40] there's a thirst as brother Brandon
[7:41] preaches this but Satan has given you a
[7:43] violent substitute to fill that
[7:46] void Satan's just got plenty of
[7:49] substitutes but why do you have to have
[7:51] a substitute when the Pentecostal skies
[7:53] are full of the real why would I eat
[7:55] from a garbage can when a clean table
[7:57] setting full of choicy food there would
[7:59] be some something mentally wrong with me
[8:00] if I did that now what it is what it
[8:03] what a Pity it is to see the man that
[8:05] man would try to substitute something to
[8:07] take that place sometimes he'll try to
[8:10] ease notice his conscience by going out
[8:14] now this is life 57 just for instance
[8:17] for the psychology part of it
[8:19] psychiatric now let's notice just a
[8:21] moment the psychic view here is the
[8:23] picture of Christ and here is an
[8:25] electric fan it depends on which one I
[8:29] look at see if my emotions is moved this
[8:33] way or my emotions is moved that way if
[8:37] I look at that and long for that and
[8:39] desire that my emotion is set towards
[8:42] the
[8:43] fan but if I look this way my emotions
[8:47] and my desires are set that way right
[8:50] hello you
[8:51] here that's the reason Jesus said
[8:53] whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust
[8:55] after her has committed adultery with
[8:56] her already in his heart see it's where
[8:59] where your emotions is
[9:03] set where your thoughts is L of time we
[9:08] over complicate the ability to overcome
[9:11] the world we we complicate the issue of
[9:13] overcoming when it's really so simple
[9:16] it's where you have set your affections
[9:18] or your heart Jesus said where the where
[9:21] your heart is there's your treasure
[9:23] also and so brother mam says this he
[9:25] says it's where your emotions are set
[9:27] where your thought is now we're going to
[9:29] skip the zakus we're going to come back
[9:31] to that brother John you can display it
[9:33] listen to the greatest battle ever
[9:34] fought what's the matter you had to open
[9:36] the channel you've got to get the
[9:38] soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the
[9:40] Battlefront that takes God's word he's
[9:43] the word and he stands there there's
[9:44] nothing going to stop him that's what's
[9:46] so look at the underline that's what's a
[9:48] matter with so many blowned up
[9:49] Christians because they don't clean out
[9:51] the channels they don't go down to the
[9:52] inside you've got to clean it conscience
[9:55] memory thoughts laying aside everything
[9:58] and coming from the inside out with the
[10:00] adulterated word of God that's the truth
[10:03] so there's something inside of you even
[10:06] after you're born of the spirit of God
[10:08] and God has changed supernaturally that
[10:10] inside nature yet there's something that
[10:13] has to always be
[10:16] clean it has to constantly be washed it
[10:20] has to constantly be cleaned and it has
[10:23] to ever be evolving and
[10:26] changing as we're going to find out here
[10:28] just in a moment
[10:30] in that subconscious or in that heart
[10:32] and the heart is a very mysterious thing
[10:35] even today even with the things that we
[10:37] could read to you in the Bible and the
[10:39] things that the prophet said yet there's
[10:41] still a mystery of the heart of the
[10:43] human Spirit maybe we don't even fully
[10:46] comprehend or understand but brother
[10:47] Brandon would say it this way you're
[10:49] made up of a Triune being you have body
[10:51] you have soul and you have spirit and
[10:53] within that spirit is an is a realm of
[10:55] emotion there's a realm of conscience
[10:58] reason and Imagination affection and you
[11:01] can ingest things in that spirit that
[11:04] affect you
[11:06] outwardly you know you take Co for
[11:08] example there was many people who never
[11:10] got really deathly sick some did but
[11:14] some never really got that you were
[11:15] never that affected by covid in your
[11:18] flesh but many people ingested the fear
[11:22] that came with that pandemic and it did
[11:25] more of a toll of damage than getting
[11:28] the physical disease ever could do you
[11:30] humanly
[11:31] right because you ingest something
[11:34] that's in a spiritual world that you
[11:36] can't see a disease that's as real as
[11:40] the physical disease hello it's a
[11:43] disease that has as much effect as the
[11:46] physical disease sometimes the spiritual
[11:49] diseases that people live with create
[11:52] more harm than a physical condition ever
[11:56] could and it's the diagnosis of the
[11:59] heart that inside of that human heart
[12:02] there's a there's a there's the
[12:05] potential for all sorts of evil and I I
[12:09] hope we can be transparent and honest to
[12:11] say that today inside of your heart if
[12:15] not guarded and checked with the word is
[12:18] the potential for any Limitless amount
[12:21] of
[12:22] evil listen what Martin Luther says you
[12:25] have that brother John I am more afraid
[12:26] of my own heart than of the Pope and all
[12:30] his Cardinals I have within me the great
[12:35] Pope
[12:38] self you know who the biggest enemy I
[12:40] got I got is William brandham he's
[12:42] always in God's way if I can just get
[12:45] him out of the way then God can go to
[12:48] work that's your worst enemy is yourself
[12:52] just get yourself out of the way and God
[12:53] can go to work you find out power of
[12:55] decision you find out you're the biggest
[12:57] enemy you've got if I can get William
[13:00] brandom out of the way Jesus can have a
[13:03] wonderful
[13:06] time but you've got to get him out of
[13:10] the way inil and a man never knows what
[13:14] it is to live a Victorious life until
[13:16] he's completely overcome
[13:18] who himself you can go to the next one
[13:21] it should come up brother John he says
[13:23] he says yes and a man never knows what
[13:26] it is to live a Victorious Life till
[13:27] it's completely overcome who himself
[13:30] that's the biggest enemy you got is
[13:32] yourself that's the reason you can't
[13:35] rise up in
[13:38] faith what stands in the way
[13:43] you looking for Jesus listen to this
[13:45] brother mam says I want to ask you
[13:46] something how many in here you know you
[13:48] got a subconscious don't you we are
[13:50] conscious of that that's the fellow that
[13:53] subconscious he says that's the fellow
[13:56] that subconscious is causing you all the
[13:59] trouble
[14:01] tonight it don't agree with this one out
[14:04] here it's scared and it backs up but
[14:08] when it when what your conscience your
[14:11] subconscious your spirit he says but
[14:14] when it becomes harmony with this one
[14:17] and this one becomes in harmony with
[14:19] God's word you're going
[14:22] then demonology but in America it never
[14:25] did work listen to what he says it's so
[14:28] much teaching in America so many
[14:29] different teachings till it has one of
[14:30] their own idea they'd say now my pastor
[14:32] said that man was a spiritualist well
[14:34] that settles it with you all you say I
[14:36] don't believe that now brother brandom
[14:37] but the way notice but way down in that
[14:42] subconscious it's still there you
[14:45] usually move by your
[14:50] subconscious just like a big ship going
[14:52] out of the sea the captain gives order
[14:54] to a little man that goes down in the
[14:55] bowels of the ship and oh he don't see
[14:57] nothing he just operates the way order
[14:59] come from above he don't know he said
[15:01] Ste he says steer this way or turn this
[15:04] way or Full Speed Ahead or back up he's
[15:06] just works according to what the man
[15:09] does up
[15:11] here isn't that
[15:13] incredible same message well usually
[15:17] that's the way your subconscious works
[15:20] it stirs you wi up he says it stirs you
[15:23] went up here you're trying to think this
[15:26] but way down in here there's something
[15:29] else moves
[15:31] you now I know that I've caught the
[15:33] patience by the thousands on the
[15:35] platform where that well there where
[15:38] they'll say brother brandham I believe
[15:40] that with all my heart yes brother
[15:43] brandham I believe that and yet down in
[15:49] there so intellectually I believe that
[15:53] with all my heart yet down in there
[16:00] yet down in there I think God if they
[16:02] believed it down here like they did up
[16:06] here I read that and I say Lord help me
[16:09] to believe down in here like I do up
[16:14] here he says cuz that won't work this
[16:17] here it's a subconscious will overrule
[16:22] that cuz subconscious will move on you
[16:25] notice what would happen even the
[16:27] prophet of God would begin to talk about
[16:28] this this with a child we spent time on
[16:30] Wednesday to to to show you this how
[16:32] that even that child is born and brother
[16:35] bam talks about in leadership starts
[16:37] with the mother goes to the father it's
[16:39] incredible when you notice even the love
[16:41] of God that that child first feels as a
[16:44] as a baby and he's starting his journey
[16:47] in life and as we said your reaction
[16:49] your adult life re is a reaction of of
[16:52] your childhood and you notice everything
[16:54] that's put into him all of the complexes
[16:57] that you live with today as as an adult
[16:59] were something that came in your past
[17:02] all of the fears that you have today and
[17:04] the things that you're afraid of of
[17:06] things most of the times that developed
[17:08] from the time you were just very small
[17:10] and very young and maybe a fear came
[17:12] upon you and you don't even know why
[17:14] you're haunted with it today remember
[17:16] what the prophet said there's a reason
[17:18] for
[17:20] everything yeah there's a reason for
[17:22] everything you're trying out here to
[17:24] accept it mentally but somewhere down in
[17:28] here there's a doubt or there's a fear
[17:30] there's a stronghold that Satan or a
[17:32] spirit that Satan is hiding
[17:36] behind and brother bom talks about this
[17:39] I just want to read it if you have that
[17:41] uh next PowerPoint brother um brother
[17:44] John jooba jyra 1962 in Grass Valley now
[17:48] what does a mother with her little baby
[17:49] when he's sick and Fring she picks up
[17:51] that little fell she holds him to her
[17:52] breast and she nurses the mother's
[17:54] strength into his own body through the
[17:57] breast and not only is he's satisfied
[18:00] this is the mother the child to the
[18:01] mother he's quietened he's screaming to
[18:05] the top of his voice he's all Disturbed
[18:08] but when the mother picks him up and
[18:10] puts her puts him on her breast and
[18:13] begins to hum to him Rock him back and
[18:16] forth he
[18:18] FS his
[18:21] mother I just want you to have this I'm
[18:24] going to tell you what it was brother uh
[18:26] John it should be called quotes Das
[18:28] mother yeah just listen while while he's
[18:31] pulling that up he says he feels his
[18:33] mother his head on her bosom and he
[18:36] begins to nurse and draw the strength
[18:39] from his mother into his body he's
[18:41] rejuvenating himself building up
[18:43] strength and also satisfied while day by
[18:47] day he's growing stronger and stronger
[18:49] expectation Phoenix and you can't do
[18:52] that Lo notice until you have love the
[18:55] prophet's going to begin to talk about
[18:56] what true love is remember what brother
[18:59] brandom says that one of the greatest
[19:00] weapons God ever gave man was Love Now
[19:04] true love not love like the world loves
[19:07] today or what the world defines as love
[19:10] but true love brother brandom says you
[19:12] can't do that until you have love
[19:14] perfect love cast out all
[19:18] fear isn't that a powerful
[19:21] statement perfect love cast out all fear
[19:27] so how do I defeat the Comm complexes in
[19:29] my mind how do I defeat that temper
[19:31] which was maybe caused by something
[19:33] inside of your spirit a stronghold that
[19:35] Satan has built how do I conquer it
[19:37] brother Matt do I need a psychologist no
[19:39] that's not what you need you need the
[19:40] great psychologist to come and discern
[19:42] your heart and discern your mind and
[19:45] bring healing through
[19:48] love perfect love cast out all fear if I
[19:52] want to con contribute anything to my
[19:53] success in the ministry is this if
[19:56] there's one thing is because that I I
[19:59] have loved
[20:03] people and people knows
[20:07] that it's powerful yes there's been one
[20:10] thing I can contribute to the success of
[20:12] my Ministry is that I have loved people
[20:15] and people know
[20:19] that you could take a little baby three
[20:21] months old he don't know nothing he's
[20:22] got a mind but it isn't developed he
[20:26] don't know notice this he says he's got
[20:29] a mind but it isn't developed he don't
[20:31] know who or nothing the doctors say they
[20:33] can see a light might see your hand but
[20:36] they can only follow it and he would
[20:38] just be kicking his little heels and
[20:40] screaming to the top of his voice well
[20:43] here comes some kind woman comes along
[20:46] passing him saying well well dear he
[20:49] just kicks right on he don't know who
[20:51] the woman is he don't know nobody but
[20:54] let that mother walk up just put her
[20:57] hands on him
[20:59] that settles
[21:00] it now he don't know his mother but his
[21:03] little Spirit knows there's something
[21:06] about that Spirit there there's nothing
[21:10] else can inject that Mother's Love to
[21:13] him do you not have that brother
[21:15] John that's that's you don't have that
[21:18] so that's all right that's all right no
[21:19] worries we'll just keep reading you with
[21:21] me and he says there's nothing else can
[21:23] inject that Mother's Love to him no
[21:25] matter how much the other person loves
[21:27] it and ain't the Mother's Love And She
[21:30] lays her hand on him he'll dry up see
[21:34] he's ready because that mother there is
[21:36] a love I hope you can catch this there
[21:38] is a love about her that goes to that
[21:41] baby that the baby's little Spirit
[21:43] recognizes that that's a love that no
[21:47] other love
[21:49] is mother is so great you know the first
[21:52] one that receives you in this life is
[21:54] your mother no one can touch you because
[21:56] you're conceived and she Bears you under
[21:58] her hard and she's the first to know you
[22:00] the first in this life to hold you then
[22:02] when you're born she's one of the first
[22:03] hands that touch you and wipes back the
[22:05] tears out of your eyes she's the first
[22:07] one to patch you and to love and to coup
[22:09] over you in this life is your mother now
[22:11] I think that there's not enough honor we
[22:13] could give to a mother mother is first
[22:16] with the child she's a great
[22:18] responsibility of what that child will
[22:20] be will be based upon the way the mother
[22:23] starts that child on the path that it
[22:25] must travel mother has the responsib
[22:28] ability from God to place that child on
[22:30] the right Road and I think that's why
[22:33] mother has a special little
[22:36] touch I'm just going to keep reading I
[22:38] hope you're just listening I know of a
[22:40] boy in the city I think the mother's
[22:42] present now he's almost my age I don't
[22:43] say this to hurt the mother because that
[22:45] she has enough hurts as as all mothers
[22:47] but the boy drinks and he drinks heavy
[22:49] and when he gets real drunk he will come
[22:50] home and jump in the bed with his mother
[22:52] put his arms around her and he's got
[22:54] grandchildren but there's something
[22:55] about the pad of a mother that seems to
[22:58] take a different place than anything
[23:00] else can touch that is in this life
[23:02] humanly speaking you know a man like
[23:04] Moses if I could ever credit anything to
[23:07] his character it was because he had a
[23:09] godsent
[23:13] mother now I want you to connect this
[23:15] with the things brother brandom says the
[23:16] reason why you have so much juvenile
[23:20] delinquency Across the Nation is because
[23:22] of Parental delinquency but what was
[23:25] brother baram referring to he was
[23:27] referring to what we read that when that
[23:29] child is born he's born with a void
[23:31] inside of him and that love that
[23:34] affection that fing that nurture that
[23:37] care takes the place before that child
[23:40] ever receives the love of God he first
[23:42] is given the love of a mother and of a
[23:45] father and brother bam says but if he
[23:47] doesn't receive that love what
[23:50] happens he'll take some violent
[23:53] substitute to feel the love of that
[23:56] mother that Satan will give him yes
[24:00] we have such a juvenile crime wave
[24:01] Across the Nation I really think it
[24:02] started at home I think the parents
[24:04] begin to let go if that child had been
[24:06] raised up in a good oldfashioned Godly
[24:08] home I don't say it would be all over
[24:09] certainly not but it would certainly
[24:11] give that child the right kind of
[24:12] influence I think many times homes that
[24:14] children has been brought up wrong
[24:15] turned loose on the street just live for
[24:17] themsel while the mother stays in a
[24:18] barroom the father and so forth they
[24:20] don't take care of this child another is
[24:22] the other thing is they don't love it
[24:25] and give it the affections to take it up
[24:27] it's Young you've got to teach it to
[24:30] love and
[24:32] respect and to read the
[24:36] Bible God hath a provided way 1956 the
[24:40] lady was born in that nervous condition
[24:42] her mother and father died when she was
[24:43] a child baby and raised up and just
[24:45] tossed about everyone never had the
[24:46] proper love and care that a baby has you
[24:47] know mother I want to tell you something
[24:49] I know I got a little boy back there
[24:50] he's really rankly
[24:52] spoiled but I would rather have him that
[24:56] way I believe it'll make a better man
[24:58] out of him if God lets him live then to
[25:01] let him scream and cry and upset his
[25:02] little self listen a few years ago some
[25:05] Norm some normal modern witch doctor
[25:07] said let that baby cry don't pick it up
[25:09] all things like that don't let Grandma
[25:11] touch it and you know what they hatched
[25:13] out you see what it is a juvenile
[25:15] delinquency a bunch of neurotics God
[25:18] made a baby to be
[25:22] loved that's why he made a mother to
[25:24] love a baby that's why we're supposed to
[25:27] be this way God made it that way and
[25:30] anytime you upset God's program you must
[25:33] remember you're wrong and it will be
[25:35] wrong as long as you're up setting God's
[25:37] program follow God's program he was made
[25:41] to be
[25:45] loved I'm just going to skip over we're
[25:48] just going to move just to save time I
[25:49] believe you've rece you got the point
[25:51] loud and clear wonder and so brother
[25:54] random even begins to talk about this in
[25:56] himself and I want you to go to the
[25:58] PowerPoint brother John that we sent
[26:00] Wednesday the very first one and uh I
[26:03] think the slide if I send it to brother
[26:05] Aaron slide is 29 we'll just begin with
[26:08] that I want you to notice as brother
[26:11] Brandon begins
[26:13] to you you just heard him speak about
[26:16] this and how that a person can even no
[26:20] not that one brother I'm sorry the the
[26:21] other one that I
[26:24] sent glad we got a pilot
[26:27] amen and so brother Brandon begins to
[26:29] talk about this and he you notice where
[26:31] he comes from I was just even studying
[26:33] this last night I want you to watch as
[26:35] brother Brandon begins to relay this
[26:37] problem and you'll notice this even in
[26:39] his ministry he comes all the way
[26:41] through in 1962 and all the way to the
[26:43] end of June and in in 1963 actually and
[26:47] he's talking even in is this the uh time
[26:50] of the end sir and brother Brams
[26:52] beginning to talk about this trouble
[26:53] that he's having he knows there's
[26:55] something he's ingested in his spirit
[26:58] that isn't right and he's struggling to
[27:00] find this and he says I I just there
[27:02] there there's just something inside of
[27:04] me that I know the Lord needs to needs
[27:06] to deal with something the Lord needs to
[27:08] fix and the prophet wasn't really sure
[27:10] what it would be so in in standing in
[27:13] the Gap in 1963 brother Ram says and
[27:15] he's referring here to brother Roy's
[27:16] dream and he says one night the Lord
[27:19] woke him up one morning we were sitting
[27:21] he and I looked like in Jerusalem at the
[27:23] Lord's communion table and I was talking
[27:27] he couldn't understand it and brother
[27:29] Roy set him present looking at me right
[27:31] now and he saw it he called me up in
[27:34] Houston or out in Arizona or sent me a
[27:36] letter and I called him back notice this
[27:40] he says you were sitting there brother
[27:42] brandom and I saw this is slide 30 and I
[27:45] saw that big pillar of light notice this
[27:49] is Brother Roy's dream I saw that big
[27:52] pillar of light come in and get you and
[27:58] take you from the Lord's
[28:00] table so here's brother Brandon the
[28:03] Lord's table and here's that same Pillar
[28:05] of Fire come in Snatch his brother
[28:09] brandom from the Lord's table and you
[28:12] went Westward cuz he was sitting on the
[28:15] east side watching me go west and this
[28:16] light come in and taken me out said it
[28:20] was one morning like it was a vision God
[28:22] up in bed about 3 or 4:00 in the morning
[28:24] something like that and saw this happen
[28:26] and he screamed look like for days
[28:27] brother the bill come back Roy and I
[28:29] have been real brothers we live together
[28:31] and Hunt together and we're just
[28:32] brothers and he screamed for me till he
[28:34] was horse in his throat come back bring
[28:36] him back bring him back
[28:38] crying here come that Pillar of Fire
[28:41] coming back or a cloud and notice and he
[28:44] set me at the head of the table and I
[28:48] had been
[28:50] changed it was a mystery to brother Roy
[28:54] me this is where I got my title from me
[28:58] being changed to look
[29:02] different brother brandham takes a piece
[29:04] of paper and he writes out this word
[29:08] these words being
[29:09] changed and he says I lay this up here
[29:12] for something I don't want to remember
[29:15] being changed when I give him the
[29:17] interpretation of it now it's incredible
[29:19] how your mind immediately when you read
[29:21] this if you've not read this and
[29:22] standing in the Gap recently your mind
[29:24] immediately goes to this is he's at a
[29:26] table here's the Lord's table he's the
[29:28] head of the table here comes the pillar
[29:29] of fire he goes Westward and takes him
[29:32] out and and it's got to be something
[29:34] with the the revelation of the seals and
[29:36] it's got to be something maybe
[29:37] mysterious and the you know maybe it was
[29:39] that and you start to go a million
[29:41] different ways let's look at what this
[29:42] Vision was of when brother brandham says
[29:45] he looked different it was you brother
[29:49] brandham he took you from the table and
[29:52] then he put you back at the head but you
[29:54] were different you look different I lay
[29:57] this up here for for something I want to
[29:58] remember being
[30:01] changed now I'm preaching to
[30:04] myself could we
[30:06] stand and see a human being that's blind
[30:10] physically blind and know that he's
[30:12] walking over a cliff could we in our
[30:14] stall state of mind that we're in this
[30:16] morning could we stand and see a blind
[30:19] man walk over a cliff blind and not try
[30:22] to warn him it would be so cruel notice
[30:26] we would be so
[30:29] indifferent in our
[30:31] heart so the heart can become
[30:35] indifferent even as a Believer even with
[30:37] the love of God down inside of your
[30:39] heart yet through something that you
[30:41] ingest into your spirit and now your
[30:44] heart can become so indifferent you say
[30:46] how could you ever get to a place
[30:48] brother Ram say could you watch a blind
[30:49] man and you watch him walking over a
[30:51] cliff and he says how could you not stop
[30:54] him or warn him you would have to be so
[30:57] indifferent in heart could you imagine a
[30:59] person getting so indifferent that he
[31:01] could almost
[31:03] laugh see a blind man that can't see and
[31:05] can't help himself deliberately walk
[31:07] over gri well that'd be a bad thing to
[31:09] do nothing about it well to my brethren
[31:11] world over I want to make this
[31:13] confession I humbly say it that just
[31:16] about what I was
[31:18] doing or fixing to
[31:21] do I had been preaching for years and I
[31:24] had become an old man an old veteran
[31:26] preacher and had a a lot of hard battles
[31:30] now this is June 23rd doors brother
[31:34] brandom even begins to deal with this
[31:36] and all the all of the doors even in the
[31:38] messages before this even brother ROM's
[31:40] relaying how that all of the all of the
[31:42] doors had been closed to him and he said
[31:45] you know you were you were coming the
[31:46] multitudes they just love me oh brother
[31:48] Bill when I was Raising when the dead
[31:50] was being raised and the sick were being
[31:52] healed and we were having great healing
[31:53] revivals and great healing
[31:55] meetings and then he begins to he says
[31:57] but this when I brought the word you
[31:59] wouldn't walk with me any further than
[32:01] that you still you you took a different
[32:02] direction you you closed your door to
[32:05] me and brother bham says even when I was
[32:08] coming what brother bham seen is the
[32:10] climax of his ministry and he he relates
[32:13] this and S is this the time I believe is
[32:15] the message and he says when I was
[32:16] coming to the climax and there was
[32:19] something really great the Lord was
[32:20] about to bring and then you couldn't
[32:22] stay you couldn't pay attention you lost
[32:25] you lost your focus then amen
[32:28] and it troubled him in his heart it
[32:30] troubled him in his human spirit and he
[32:33] says I've been I've fought a lot of hard
[32:34] battles maybe I'm scarred and cut up on
[32:36] the inside from fights because my lot
[32:39] that the lord gave me was not back to
[32:40] kiss the babies and to marry the young
[32:42] and bury the old but it was to hold a
[32:44] two-handed sword at the Battlefront
[32:47] against the Ws of paganism and
[32:49] demonology and the powers of darkness
[32:51] and fight it with the word of God till I
[32:53] seen the enemy
[32:56] defeated I've been cut deep many
[33:01] times I met a man that was a Christian
[33:03] he's got a great country right under
[33:04] lashka made up my mind that being that I
[33:06] had left here and gone west that I would
[33:08] take my wife and kind of trap her into
[33:14] something you brothers ever done that
[33:17] before you know just sort of trap her
[33:19] don't tell her I'd get her up here and
[33:22] become a guide and then if the Lord
[33:23] wanted me to do something I let my hair
[33:25] grow out and whiskers and go back in
[33:27] there and be a GU there's only about two
[33:28] or three Indians live back there in the
[33:29] country I'd just be a guide I'd help Bud
[33:32] if the Lord wanted me to do anything
[33:33] that I'd say all right Lord give me a
[33:35] vision I would slip on out then I notice
[33:37] I want you to notice just just the I'm
[33:40] so thankful for how transparent brother
[33:43] Bron becomes here he says then I being a
[33:46] nervous I say this kind of quietly maybe
[33:48] an neurotically type of person that I am
[33:51] and knowing that I was
[33:54] insufficient at the beginning for the
[33:56] job
[33:59] the Lord commissions him he gives him a
[34:02] job and yet even in his own Humanity
[34:05] he's thinking is the entire time I I am
[34:08] not sufficient for this job it's too
[34:11] much for me I'm so thankful that we had
[34:13] a prophet who is that
[34:16] real yes I wish we could be that real
[34:19] sometimes I believe Sometimes some of
[34:21] the trouble that prevents us is that we
[34:23] have a facade or something we put out in
[34:26] front and we're not honest H with other
[34:28] people and we're not honest with oursel
[34:30] if we'd be really honest with oursel
[34:32] we'd all realize we need an abundance of
[34:36] Grace and an abundance of Mercy in our
[34:39] life and if I receive that much grace
[34:41] how much more grace should I give other
[34:45] [Music]
[34:46] people there's so much pretense we we
[34:49] have sometimes brother brandom's
[34:51] throwing all that to the side he says I
[34:53] I was insufficient at the beginning for
[34:56] the job as many as complained that I did
[34:57] dude it was hard but I thought God why
[34:58] didn't you call somebody that could have
[35:00] done it I'm sorry but I failed the
[35:02] people just won't listen to me and I
[35:03] failed to do what I should have done
[35:05] somewhere because they won't
[35:09] listen isn't this the trouble that we
[35:11] always get into that immediately when we
[35:15] don't see the result that we think
[35:17] should come the blame instantly
[35:19] immediately goes to self-condemnation
[35:22] and self
[35:24] failure even as parents sometimes when
[35:27] you've obey the word of the Lord and
[35:29] you've you've raised your children in
[35:30] the way that they should go rather than
[35:32] just settling on the promise of God that
[35:34] God will get a hold of him Satan will
[35:36] come and try to oppress us with every
[35:38] kind of oppressive Spirit to tell you
[35:40] look what you've done wrong they turned
[35:42] out that way because of this and if you
[35:43] would have just done this and there's
[35:45] guilt and there's guilt and guilt listen
[35:47] the holy spirit will never give you
[35:49] condemnation to guilt and shame he'll
[35:51] convict you but he'll never get you to a
[35:53] place to where you're you're so low and
[35:55] you're so defeated he'll always
[35:57] encourage you you got to learn to
[35:59] discern the voice that's speaking to you
[36:02] and sometimes say that's not my heavenly
[36:04] father talking to me that's the devil
[36:06] talking to me and I'm going to cast that
[36:09] thought
[36:12] down and if you don't you ingest it as a
[36:15] lie into your conscience and then it
[36:17] hinders you from receiving the
[36:21] word they fail I failed they just won't
[36:23] listen my mother they just passed in the
[36:24] glory about a little over a year ago my
[36:26] mother father is a hunter I think think
[36:27] I got all that come from him in the
[36:28] stand cuz I love the woods I thought if
[36:30] this people that call themselves
[36:31] Christians if they don't want to listen
[36:32] to the message that I'm preaching let
[36:34] them alone I'll just stop it all
[36:36] together I'll go up to that mountain and
[36:38] I I know a friend before leaving here I
[36:40] might drop this in we'll hurry I Dreamed
[36:42] a funny dream listen an odd dream and I
[36:44] hope when my brother-in-law gets a hold
[36:45] of this he doesn't hurt his feelings and
[36:47] I hope it don't hurt my wife who's
[36:48] sitting present now but she knows it
[36:50] many months ago right on what it was
[36:52] around about October November I dreamed
[36:53] that I was roaming out in the dark I had
[36:56] no place to go and nobody cared for me
[36:58] and I had become a bum just a bum and I
[37:00] was cold I looked in the distance and
[37:02] saw a fire and when I got over there it
[37:04] was a city dump and they had ditches and
[37:06] the fire was in these ditches and
[37:08] between the ditches was slick where bums
[37:09] would sleep there to keep warm keep from
[37:11] freezing between these fires on a cold
[37:13] winter night and I was cold I walked up
[37:15] to this fire to get warm and it was
[37:16] laying full of bums and they were I
[37:18] didn't see any of them but they all like
[37:20] had stalls or places where their
[37:22] sleeping place was and I saw my
[37:24] brother-in-law Fletcher Bry when I woke
[37:26] up before I woke up flet said to me he
[37:28] said in the dream he said Billy I'll
[37:29] hunt you a place brother Bill you fed my
[37:31] children and weat when they were hungry
[37:33] and he was a daddy to them I'll find you
[37:35] a place here to keep warm we went
[37:36] walking by the bums places and finally
[37:38] come to a place he said I'll sit down
[37:41] here and said I'll walk up here and see
[37:42] if I could find a place I walked up and
[37:45] looked out into the dark cold night and
[37:46] I thought think of it one time God
[37:49] Almighty let me lead his church one time
[37:52] he let me preach his gospel and see
[37:54] Souls saved men and women come from
[37:56] around the world to speak with me for a
[37:58] few minutes and here I am now a bum and
[38:03] nobody wants me and I'm cold what must I
[38:07] do then I woke
[38:10] up I told my wife maybe it means Fletch
[38:13] is a need we hurri up we could find him
[38:14] and his brother found him so I come back
[38:15] down from can of the Fred with them the
[38:17] other day notice and in my
[38:20] mind that's an important
[38:23] distinction it wasn't in what the Lord
[38:26] it wasn't in his soul that God had spoke
[38:28] to him but in my mind I had made up if
[38:32] these people didn't want to hear my
[38:33] message all right they didn't have to I
[38:35] had preached now for about 35 years in
[38:37] the last 15 to 18 years I'd done nothing
[38:39] but just to the Lord I've tried to live
[38:42] so close and not close so close to him
[38:44] and not say a word till he would told me
[38:46] first everything then I come down from
[38:48] Canon and Fred and brother Roy told me
[38:49] his dream and he and I and brother Banks
[38:51] Woods rode along together just before we
[38:53] separated I say the people I've never
[38:56] regarded myself as KN as knowing this
[38:58] but people have said brother Brandon the
[38:59] Lord called you to be his Prophet I've
[39:00] never regarded myself as that but I
[39:02] began to get to the time that I was
[39:03] about ready to do it to think well maybe
[39:05] if I am I'll live back in the wilderness
[39:08] I'll live back in the wilderness and
[39:09] I'll be his prophet and if he wants me
[39:11] to send me somewhere I while he's not
[39:13] using me then I I I I'll sure to catch
[39:16] some fine fish and do some
[39:19] things of course that was kind of a
[39:22] selfish attitude see because I wanted to
[39:25] do that now it is isn't just exactly the
[39:28] thing that's to do and now I had that
[39:31] made up in my mind to do that so about
[39:33] got up about 4:00 got started driving
[39:35] Billy was sleeping we went into a place
[39:38] I was thinking on my mind you know what
[39:39] one of these days as soon as I can get
[39:41] the wife up here I won't tell her what
[39:42] I'm going to do I I I'd get up there and
[39:44] then I'm going to tell her I love this
[39:46] place see so well no need of us going
[39:48] anywhere let's just stay here and that's
[39:50] back from civilization 1100 miles from
[39:52] anywhere see way in the wilderness I
[39:54] thought won't that be fine
[39:58] I won't have to get a
[40:01] haircut now don't your boys start
[40:03] getting any
[40:04] ideas I won't have to dress up I'll just
[40:08] be a regular Mountain Ear what I always
[40:12] wanted to be and I said I've got some
[40:15] guns some people give me I'll be a guide
[40:17] like you never heard
[40:19] of I just love it that the Lord tells me
[40:22] go down and tell somebody something I'll
[40:24] run out and tell them and come back
[40:25] again and I'll help Bud and we'll have a
[40:27] real well we'll really have a place
[40:31] here now notice the prophet is not what
[40:34] you're not reading is that he's
[40:35] struggling in his mind as Billy's asleep
[40:37] and he's thinking oh I'll just backslide
[40:39] and I'll go to the barroom and I'll go
[40:41] back to alcohol and I'll just completely
[40:43] walk this isn't what he's
[40:45] considering it's not it's not brother
[40:47] brandom completely but in his conscience
[40:49] now because of a complex he had formed
[40:52] in his mind he was just going to take a
[40:56] little detour
[41:00] and rearrange the things that God had
[41:02] arranged in his life because he couldn't
[41:06] understand what was happening presently
[41:09] couldn't make sense of it he says I'll
[41:11] just I'll help Bud notice and we'll have
[41:14] a real place I love how he says this I
[41:16] was thinking on
[41:22] that it
[41:25] said carry out your plans
[41:28] and you'll be like
[41:30] that you notice brother random goes and
[41:33] even didn't put it on the screen here
[41:34] but he goes into a cafe and there's a
[41:36] man looks just like him Billy says Oh
[41:38] Daddy that looks just like you he says
[41:40] oh man just a real man you know not one
[41:42] of these little you know guys wearing a
[41:45] pair of shorts and slick back hair he
[41:47] say not one of those Ricky he said was a
[41:48] real barely man and he said just hair
[41:51] you know big beard and and he say daddy
[41:53] say brother M says oh that's the man I
[41:55] always wanted to be and he and and
[41:57] brother brand him says Billy you think
[41:58] so and he he says then and then here
[42:00] walks in a little man shriveled up just
[42:03] real real frail like and he said it been
[42:06] over with by campfire and he said had my
[42:09] had my exact profile was a
[42:11] bum and here's this here's another man
[42:14] look just like Fletch Fletcher Bry and
[42:17] and and brother random makes the
[42:18] connection here's two
[42:21] bums and now the voice comes to brother
[42:23] brandham and he says carry out your
[42:25] plans you'll be like that and notice
[42:27] immediately brother brandham Lord I I
[42:30] don't want to be like that said your
[42:33] wife will go too she won't live up there
[42:36] in them Hills like that and you'll
[42:39] become a bum just as the dream showed
[42:42] you you
[42:44] would I said I I don't I don't I I don't
[42:49] want to live I have to live like that I
[42:51] I I want to do something different but I
[42:53] was told that you called me to be a
[42:55] prophet and I want to live in the w is
[42:57] like the prophet but I was using my own
[42:59] excuse so I could
[43:03] hunt isn't it amazing how brother random
[43:06] talks about this remember in that sub in
[43:08] that spirit is the is
[43:09] reasoning it's so amazing how we justify
[43:12] these paths that our life has taken and
[43:14] we give every kind of justifiable reason
[43:16] and
[43:19] excuse he says I want to live like that
[43:22] I was just using as small excuse so I
[43:23] could hunt my own good
[43:27] notice carry out your
[43:31] plans so something brother Brandon
[43:33] wasn't this is incredible to me because
[43:36] it wasn't even unreasonable what he was
[43:40] thinking it's not like it's some
[43:43] horrible my goodness brother wow no I
[43:45] can't even believe you would ever even
[43:47] consider that aren't you a brother my
[43:49] goodness
[43:50] no if I told you that you know you had
[43:53] that plan you think well okay you know
[43:54] brother Matthew that's maybe what the
[43:56] Lord the Lord is calling you to do well
[43:58] I'm just trying to make sense of my
[44:00] circumstances I'm trying to make sense
[44:01] of what's happening and so then what is
[44:04] brother bam do he starts just
[44:05] fabricating and creating his own little
[44:07] route through life and you can God has a
[44:10] route that God has planned and charted
[44:12] your entire course from the beginning
[44:14] you took your first breath through your
[44:16] teenage years your adult years your all
[44:19] the way to your El where when your
[44:20] elderly brother there there's a perfect
[44:22] plan and a perfect path and a perfect
[44:24] route that God has routed it all the way
[44:26] from beginning
[44:27] all the way to the
[44:29] end but you can off of that route step
[44:32] off of that route and just create a
[44:35] little detour over here the pressure is
[44:37] just too great of the journey God's
[44:39] called you to and so the pressure begins
[44:41] to build and then you immediately a
[44:43] Believer filled with the baptism of the
[44:44] Holy Ghost but inside of that conscience
[44:46] you start reasoning things
[44:50] out I let the sick lay I want the Lord
[44:53] to tell me where to go and not to that's
[44:55] wrong I had built myself a
[44:59] complex because the people didn't hear
[45:01] my message and if God forbid that I try
[45:03] to compare the
[45:05] life God forbid I'll try to compare the
[45:07] life of now like Moses but it's exactly
[45:09] what Moses did the people wouldn't
[45:10] listen to him when he come to deliver
[45:12] them so he just left them alone and went
[45:15] into the Wilderness but God turned him
[45:19] around and he had long forgotten the
[45:22] suffering
[45:24] people why you said but how did this
[45:27] happen to God's Prophet because he was
[45:31] so troubled with what he seen around him
[45:35] he couldn't understand I've obeyed the
[45:37] Lord I've done nothing remember what he
[45:40] said I've done nothing but what pleased
[45:41] the Lord I had lived totally for
[45:44] him and I'm expecting because I've done
[45:47] that I'm expecting this result that this
[45:50] is what I'm going to see and now that I
[45:52] don't see that result I'm going to
[45:55] rather than trusting the Lord I'm going
[45:56] to begin to question and allow the devil
[45:58] to question everything in my life and
[46:00] pick it
[46:03] apart and we allow bitterness to get a
[46:06] door and
[46:07] access we allow you know disappointments
[46:10] can be very
[46:13] dangerous I just felt the holy spirit
[46:15] for me to say that to you
[46:16] disappointments in life can be very
[46:19] dangerous because at a disappointment
[46:22] you're at a crossroad of decision on
[46:24] what you're going to do with that
[46:25] disappointment you're either going to
[46:28] allow that disappointment to envelop you
[46:30] with depression and oppression and
[46:33] complexes and questions and the devil
[46:35] would just beat you like a punching
[46:37] bag you have a choice to either do that
[46:40] or to just trust the
[46:44] Lord and say God I commit it to you I
[46:46] don't understand
[46:50] it he had long forgot the suffering
[46:53] people and these notice this and these
[46:55] Ricky and that have so sassed the words
[47:00] and I've called them Ricky and Retta God
[47:03] give me to understand I shouldn't do
[47:07] that because that's many of them are
[47:10] still his children they can't help
[47:13] because they act so much different some
[47:14] of these old cold formal churches has
[47:16] got them that Spirit upon them they're
[47:18] in much in prison as Israel was in
[47:20] prison just as much as Moses went down
[47:22] to deliver them from slavery human
[47:24] beings that loveed Jesus Christ would
[47:27] serve him if they only knew what to Ser
[47:30] him by and they're in bondage under
[47:33] denominationalism that tells them don't
[47:34] you do this and don't you do
[47:37] that notice what brother ROM says here I
[47:39] want you to notice the next slide in the
[47:41] in the in the underlined portion and I
[47:43] wanted to bring this to you so that you
[47:47] would see and show you that the mistake
[47:50] that a man can make yet being sincere
[47:57] Moses lost the feeling of his people
[47:59] because they wouldn't listen to him and
[48:00] brother Roy notice now he points back to
[48:03] that dream here's the note laying in
[48:05] front of him being changed brother Roy
[48:09] you see your dream and now I cannot go
[48:12] with a Ministry like that until I feel
[48:17] different in my heart
[48:21] yes that was a person who could be so
[48:24] honest with himself
[48:28] people that can be honest with you can
[48:30] be honest with thems when people can't
[48:31] be honest with you most of the times
[48:33] they've never really confronted that man
[48:35] in the
[48:36] mirror they've never really seen him for
[48:39] who he really is your greatest enemy you
[48:42] got brother Bram says as you right there
[48:44] in the
[48:45] mirror and this is the change brother
[48:49] Bram says you were the dream says you
[48:50] were different brother brandom what was
[48:54] different his attitude towards
[48:59] people and he
[49:01] says no matter if God did tell me but
[49:04] that is that
[49:06] change that brother Roy that seen coming
[49:11] something's got to change me because in
[49:15] my heart if I go out there feeling the
[49:17] way I do now I still feel that they
[49:19] ought to have listened notice I ought to
[49:22] have heard the message they ought to
[49:23] have done it I don't have the feeling
[49:24] for the people that I should have
[49:29] until I can get that
[49:32] feeling there's no need in me going
[49:35] because I'd be a hypocrite he's so
[49:37] concerned I want you just and I'm just
[49:39] going to stop here for a moment he is so
[49:42] concerned the holy spirit is so
[49:44] concerned with brother bram's attitude
[49:46] he quotes Ricky and retas of what you've
[49:48] heard the prophet say on tape time and
[49:50] time again and is it because they
[49:53] weren't were they sassing the word
[49:55] absolutely were they rebellious against
[49:58] God's prophet and his message absolutely
[50:00] they were but he allowed something in
[50:03] his Spirit of how he looked and treated
[50:06] people and he's so concerned with how he
[50:09] treats
[50:12] unbelievers notice I want you to make
[50:14] sure you understand this this is
[50:15] denominational people people that maybe
[50:17] could never have the ability to accept
[50:19] his message but he's so concerned with
[50:22] how he treated or viewed or looked at
[50:25] other human beings
[50:27] and if you think God doesn't care about
[50:29] how you treat people and about how you
[50:31] treat each other come on friends you
[50:34] think God is Not greatly concerned on
[50:37] how we treat each
[50:39] other yes absolutely let me go just a
[50:42] little bit further you think God doesn't
[50:44] isn't concerned with how a husband
[50:46] treats a
[50:49] wife and his attitude he takes towards
[50:52] his children or the wife towards the
[50:54] husband or the child towards the father
[50:56] or the the father towards the son when
[50:58] that child begins to get rebellious and
[51:00] you allow something in your spirit and
[51:02] it clouds your love that you should
[51:04] project it's not not saying wink it at
[51:06] you know and and don't bring correction
[51:08] and don't bring dis but but you know
[51:10] there's a way to bring true Jesus said
[51:12] those that I love I chasten with with
[51:14] what with true
[51:17] love there's a way to bring correction
[51:19] and to say something you can have 100% I
[51:22] don't know why I'm preaching this but
[51:24] I'm just going to trust the Holy Spirit
[51:26] you could be 100% right in what you're
[51:29] saying but if you say it with the wrong
[51:31] attitude it won't help you it'll hurt
[51:34] you
[51:36] yes you could be 100% right on how
[51:39] you're perceiving a situation with your
[51:41] child but come with the wrong spirit in
[51:44] correction and now you've not helped
[51:46] them you've hurt them and you've hurt
[51:50] you you could be 100% right but if your
[51:54] attitude in the way that you project it
[51:57] isn't through the love of
[51:59] Christ I've got notice until I can get
[52:01] that feeling all these years I've tried
[52:02] to serve him with a true heart and I
[52:04] won't go out there being a hypocrite
[52:05] I've got to feel that that it isn't
[52:07] Ricky and Rett it isn't this Bunch it's
[52:09] God's children that's in bondage and I
[52:11] must go to them until I can feel that
[52:13] way I'll just loaf around preach some
[52:15] conventions and things but wait God
[52:17] bless you each one of you we hope to see
[52:19] you again real soon till then will you
[52:21] do this one favor for me now both ear on
[52:23] the tape also Brethren pray that God
[52:25] will place into my heart that's
[52:29] something that I lost out there in that
[52:35] complex because something whether
[52:37] brother bham had realized it at the time
[52:39] now he realizes something the Devil is a
[52:42] thief he comes to steal kill and
[52:46] destroy and he doesn't even realize
[52:49] himself but now he's realizing there's
[52:51] something that he's
[52:55] missing just something something maybe
[52:57] you know that woman who searches her
[52:59] house and she's looking for that lost
[53:01] coin she's just missed one and brother
[53:04] and the Bible says she sweeps the house
[53:05] and she searches for it and she lights a
[53:08] candle but you got all the other coins
[53:10] but that one thing that God gives you
[53:12] when he fills you with the Holy Ghost
[53:14] love and joy and meekness and kindness
[53:17] and a sweet spirit and love for
[53:19] everybody and love for your fellow
[53:21] brother that love that you f it for your
[53:23] wife when you're first married and that
[53:25] cherishing and that Joy of that child
[53:27] when he's first born but let life go
[53:29] through turmoil and twist and turns and
[53:32] then that that maybe just that one part
[53:35] you lose
[53:37] it and the Bible says she'll sweep her
[53:40] house she'll light a candle until she
[53:44] finds that missing pieace maybe you're
[53:47] here today and you could say Lord I'm
[53:49] going to light a candle I'm going to
[53:51] sweep my house until I have all of those
[53:54] virtues that you placed in me I want all
[53:57] of them and I'm not willing to surrender
[53:59] any of them to the devil I'm not willing
[54:02] to give up any part of the nature of
[54:04] Christ that he's put in me I'm not
[54:06] willing to let the devil have it I'm
[54:08] here today to say Satan I might have
[54:10] lost it but I'm a son or daughter of God
[54:12] and I'm here to claim it in the name of
[54:16] Jesus if life has made you an old crabby
[54:20] heart Harden heart hearted person and
[54:22] you're angry and you don't understand
[54:24] why God can give it back to you he can
[54:26] take that out of you and place the real
[54:28] love and joy of Christ inside of your
[54:32] heart I pray that God will place it in
[54:34] my heart that's something that lost out
[54:35] there in that complex it's so easy to
[54:37] build a complex I had an interview the
[54:39] other day with my brother wayon in here
[54:41] standing in front of good man build
[54:42] himself around a complex another kind of
[54:44] complex did the same thing brother way
[54:46] isn't it incredible brother way passes
[54:48] away in that service loses as you go to
[54:51] the end of that tape and here's brother
[54:52] way here's brother brandom and he
[54:53] references him says just like me just
[54:56] like me uh brother brother way he says
[55:00] I've I've you've you've built a complex
[55:03] and he says there was I didn't that my
[55:04] brother way sitting here standing in
[55:05] front of good man build himself around a
[55:07] complex brother bandam goes and brother
[55:09] way passes away dies in that
[55:12] service and you hear Brother brandham go
[55:14] on tape and he begins to pray and you
[55:16] watch that prayer the way brother
[55:17] brandham prays it and here brother
[55:19] brandom is saying I'm just I'll just
[55:21] loaf around go until I get this right
[55:24] what God was doing now brother random
[55:25] goes to pray for for that man and he
[55:27] says Lord I I pray and I forget the way
[55:29] that t how he words exactly but he says
[55:31] I pray you'd bring him back to himself
[55:34] and the man starts breathing again his
[55:35] heart starts beating had no pulse and
[55:37] God raises the
[55:41] dead after the transparency and
[55:44] confession of a of a
[55:46] prophet you notice the power of honesty
[55:49] and confession when you can be honest
[55:51] enough to admit it to your spouse to
[55:53] your child I was wrong Daddy was wrong I
[55:55] should I've got that attitude when you
[55:58] can repent and bring bring real
[55:59] repentance to a husband maybe something
[56:01] you've done or to your wife or to your
[56:03] pastor you know what God can do the
[56:06] power of honesty when transparency comes
[56:09] God can bring Supernatural because why
[56:11] all the channels are cleaned out and
[56:14] Satan perfect love cast out all fear he
[56:16] has no hold he's got to let go then you
[56:19] ever become honest with your f with God
[56:21] honest with people the devil has no
[56:24] hiding place
[56:27] amen and God raises brother wave brother
[56:29] Brandon preaches that night flashing red
[56:31] light of his coming and he's trying to
[56:33] make sense of it and he says I don't
[56:35] know maybe I said the thing to brother
[56:37] wayy about his complex and then brother
[56:40] wayy was just too much for him thought I
[56:42] was scolding him or rebuking him and
[56:44] maybe brother the way was just so
[56:45] overwhelmed he had a heart attack
[56:46] brother Brandon do said no and he says
[56:48] or maybe the Lord was just showing me
[56:50] that even in the midst of my complex
[56:52] God's still going to use me in a
[56:53] supernatural way
[56:56] you know why because even with that
[56:59] thing in his Spirit that's not going to
[57:01] change his gift that God placed in his
[57:04] life right you say but brother Matt why
[57:07] is that important because you never
[57:09] judge where you're standing with the
[57:12] Lord based upon some Supernatural work
[57:15] or God using your gift or your ministry
[57:17] or God using your talent or the go how
[57:19] God's been that is no sign or evidence
[57:22] that you're right where you need to be
[57:23] with the Lord and pleasing to him
[57:27] am you can so easily do it it's just got
[57:29] a little something in your mind listen
[57:31] how he says you form a complex keep he
[57:33] says this you can so easily do it it's
[57:35] just you just get a little something in
[57:37] your mind keep thinking that
[57:42] way remember it just begins something so
[57:45] small that it begins to filter
[57:47] everything go back and check it with the
[57:50] scripture and see if it's right or
[57:53] not and then go from there on
[57:59] how do I know it's it's so amazing how
[58:02] many times we negotiate and we allow the
[58:04] devil to reason in our minds and reason
[58:06] and now brother brandom says you just
[58:08] get a little something in your mind you
[58:10] know it's amazing how much phantom pain
[58:12] people
[58:13] get you take a person who goes in
[58:15] audence you feel like you have pain it's
[58:17] called phantom pain so the doctor gives
[58:18] you a placebo something that maybe can
[58:20] fix in your mind you know this devil has
[58:22] sold so many Believers Phantom Pain well
[58:26] this person hurt me and that's the way
[58:28] that I am and it's because this brother
[58:29] did and because and maybe I'm not saying
[58:32] that that that can't be the case but a
[58:34] lot of times sometimes let me say it
[58:36] that way you're thinking something in
[58:38] your mind and that person has no idea
[58:40] about it whatsoever but you've allowed
[58:42] the devil to give you phantom pain over
[58:44] this person and this hurt and you know
[58:46] what friends what that is that's a lie
[58:48] just like that woman had a lie and it
[58:50] gave her heart trouble what do you got
[58:52] to do you got to cast down the lie and
[58:54] say I choose to believe the word and
[58:57] denounce the lie that the devil's trying
[58:59] to sell
[59:02] me just keep thinking that way go back
[59:05] and check it with the scripture and see
[59:07] if it's right or not and then go on from
[59:08] there don't lose your feeling for the
[59:10] people you must remember they're not
[59:12] made out of sawdust they're flesh and
[59:15] blood human beings and a
[59:19] soul pray for me all of you if you will
[59:22] you know we we have to keep that in our
[59:24] mind you you take a a I'm just going to
[59:26] deal with it here for a moment don't
[59:29] ever forget your children yeah they may
[59:31] have mistakes and failures and may
[59:32] disappoint you no like no one else good
[59:35] but they're not
[59:38] sawdust they're Flesh and Blood they've
[59:40] got a real soul and a real heart the
[59:42] devil might have tripped them up you
[59:44] take that husband and that wife you
[59:45] should be able to have patience you must
[59:47] have patience one with another
[59:51] yes CU none of us are
[59:54] perfect well
[59:58] amen none of us are without fault none
[1:00:00] of us are without failure sir none of us
[1:00:03] are without mistakes all of us have the
[1:00:05] potential within ourself to hurt each
[1:00:08] other do you realize that I don't care
[1:00:10] how born of the spirit of God you are
[1:00:12] and how much God has transformed you you
[1:00:14] have the ability within yourself in fact
[1:00:16] it's what you do very well you you
[1:00:18] destroy that's what we do we hurt that's
[1:00:21] what we do very naturally so we have
[1:00:24] propensity towards it we do it very well
[1:00:26] we tear down what do we do in our carnal
[1:00:28] nature we naturally we tear things down
[1:00:32] we destroy
[1:00:33] things it's not naturally in us but the
[1:00:36] spirit of Christ builds up the spirit of
[1:00:39] God
[1:00:40] restores the spirit of Christ
[1:00:44] reconciles it's natural for you to take
[1:00:46] your nature and become bitter and hold
[1:00:48] hard feelings or hold a grudge or not
[1:00:50] forgive but I say today surrender to
[1:00:53] this inner man down inside of you and
[1:00:55] say Lord I'm I'm going to I'm going to
[1:00:56] choose not to listen to my nature but to
[1:00:59] your spirit that's inside of me and I'm
[1:01:01] going to choose to forgive I'm going to
[1:01:03] choose to reconcile I'm going to choose
[1:01:04] to allow you to restore yes to do what
[1:01:07] you do best you're a carpenter carpenter
[1:01:10] son Jesus was a builder he could rebuild
[1:01:13] he could take what was broken and put it
[1:01:15] back
[1:01:18] together there're flesh and blood human
[1:01:20] beings and a soul pray for me all of you

[1:01:22] going to Bow our heads and ask brother R

[1:01:26] tried to think this is the flashing red
[1:01:27] light of his coming listen that night it
[1:01:30] might have been this that I've tried to
[1:01:31] think of it this afternoon that I had
[1:01:32] stood here and with all my heart told
[1:01:36] you exactly the truth and tell you of my
[1:01:39] complex and make an open confession
[1:01:42] cause and ask you to pray and I want you
[1:01:45] I want to just ask you as we close the
[1:01:47] service here today maybe this would be
[1:01:50] your prayer and you could say brother
[1:01:52] Matt I just want to raise my hand and
[1:01:54] say I ask you to pray that my inside
[1:01:58] being would be

[1:02:17] be honest enough and confess it but here
[1:02:19] before the Lord Lord Jesus is here
[1:02:22] now he knew that the Lord had this
[1:02:25] service planned he knew he wasn't
[1:02:27] finished Wednesday and God would have me
[1:02:28] bring this message today and I'm here

[1:02:32] just want to raise the hand to the
[1:02:34] Lord and say Lord with all my

[1:02:49] all the channels right now
[1:02:52] Lord I'm going to become humble enough
[1:02:54] to confess that maybe
[1:02:56] maybe I've lost
[1:02:58] something maybe it's been missing from
[1:03:00] me and my attitudes towards
[1:03:04] people and I just want to make an open
[1:03:06] confession I want to raise a hand and
[1:03:08] say Lord make it an open confession and
[1:03:12] I ask you to pray that my inside being
[1:03:16] would be
[1:03:17] changed yes
[1:03:21] [Music]
[1:03:27] that my inside being could be changed
[1:03:30] that could do as the Lord
[1:03:32] did I could look Beyond The Human Side I
[1:03:36] could look down to
[1:03:38] a I could look the way that God looks I
[1:03:41] want to I want Lord I want your vision
[1:03:43] of people I don't want my clouded up
[1:03:46] carnal way of looking at people I want
[1:03:48] to see them as you see them Lord will
[1:03:51] you wash my eyes and wash my mind so
[1:03:54] that I can see my husband I could see my
[1:03:56] spouse not in their failures and human
[1:03:59] weaknesses but let me see that that way
[1:04:01] that you see them Lord let me look past
[1:04:04] that child of maybe that dis maybe the
[1:04:06] way that they've disappointed me to the
[1:04:07] struggle that they're going through and
[1:04:09] I've allowed myself to my temper my
[1:04:11] bitterness and I my pride if I'd be
[1:04:13] honest to get in the way but let me look
[1:04:15] to them let me look beyond that flesh
[1:04:17] let me look at that Soul that's worth
[1:04:20] 10,000 worlds and let me love them with
[1:04:23] the love of Christ let me love them how
[1:04:27] you love them let me honor them and
[1:04:30] value them how you value them
[1:04:33] Lord and now now I want to ask you
[1:04:37] something that's much harder than
[1:04:40] looking at other people that way now I
[1:04:42] want you to say
[1:04:43] Lord let me look at myself the way you
[1:04:46] see me
[1:04:47] Jesus let me look at you let me look at
[1:04:51] myself not the way that I see myself as
[1:04:53] just a mess and just just a failure and
[1:04:57] I've got myself down in the ash Heap and
[1:04:59] I'm just graveling and I can't move on
[1:05:01] because of a mistake or maybe because
[1:05:03] something in my life Lord I want today
[1:05:06] to erase that image out of my mind that
