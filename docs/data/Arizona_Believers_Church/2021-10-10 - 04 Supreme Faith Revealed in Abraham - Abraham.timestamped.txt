[0:00] genesis chapter 22 verses 1 to 10 i'm
[0:03] very um excited about the word of the
[0:06] lord this morning and i'm just not sure
[0:09] where where to
[0:11] stop i know where to start but i was
[0:12] told the gift is stopping so we'll find
[0:15] out where this gift is at and its
[0:16] maturity
[0:18] but um i'm just not sure which direction
[0:20] to go because it's like everything's
[0:21] wide open and even this morning as i was
[0:23] just
[0:24] pondering whether or not i should change
[0:27] my notes and take away or add to and
[0:30] which direction to go i felt just to
[0:32] leave it where it was yesterday
[0:33] and so i expressed that now just to say
[0:35] that
[0:37] just to appreciate your attention
[0:39] and real focus because
[0:41] i'm just trying to lay a foundation on
[0:42] this thought of supreme faith revealed
[0:44] in abraham
[0:45] and as we mentioned wednesday night i'm
[0:47] kind of coming to uh then what i thought
[0:50] would be the end or the goal i'm
[0:52] bringing it forward now and dealing with
[0:54] it at the outset so we can look at how
[0:57] abraham's faith culminated and how it
[0:59] climaxed and how that's instructive to
[1:01] us specifically in the end time in this
[1:03] third exodus in this rapture season
[1:06] and then and then back up and just look
[1:08] at his life even beginning with things
[1:09] in genesis chapter 11 and walk through
[1:11] 12 13 14 15 17 see i know how to count
[1:15] and and go all the way through to
[1:16] genesis 22 and realize wow you know when
[1:19] you look at abraham's life
[1:21] he didn't always live on top of mount
[1:22] moriah
[1:24] he didn't always receive god veiled in
[1:26] flesh at his tent door every morning you
[1:28] look at his life and you take it and
[1:29] hold you realize wow i can relate to
[1:32] abraham's faith because i'm walking in
[1:34] the same pattern today and what his
[1:36] faith culminated in there's a promise
[1:38] for you to do the same thing and that's
[1:40] kind of our thesis statement there and
[1:43] we trust that we could just even though
[1:44] there might be some repetition i trust
[1:46] it'll be a blessing to you
[1:48] genesis 22 verse 1 and it came to pass
[1:50] after these things that god did tempt
[1:53] abraham and said unto him abraham and he
[1:56] said behold here i am
[1:58] and again it's important to note that
[2:00] this temptation of abraham is not in the
[2:02] same way that satan tempted tempts
[2:05] mankind we know that god does not tempt
[2:07] man to sin
[2:09] so he says and he said take now thy son
[2:11] thy only son isaac whom thou lovest
[2:14] and get thee into the land of moriah and
[2:17] offer him there for a burnt offering
[2:19] upon one of the mountains which i will
[2:21] tell thee of we're just going to take a
[2:23] little bit of time as we read this to
[2:25] reinforce these things this mariah it's
[2:27] a place chosen by jehovah
[2:30] and then as he
[2:31] does so often with abraham
[2:33] he speaks to him and he has to act
[2:35] according to what has been disclosed but
[2:38] then there's still more to unfold he
[2:40] says you have to you have to walk in
[2:41] this and then i'll show you the mountain
[2:42] so he couldn't sit around waiting for
[2:44] the specific mountain to be disclosed he
[2:46] had to begin and initiate this process
[2:48] and then he would tell him of one
[2:49] mountain in particular that he needed to
[2:51] come to and it's in that mountain that
[2:53] we find that the temple of uh that
[2:55] solomon built is uh is located he says
[2:58] and abraham rose up early
[3:00] in the morning and saddled his ass and
[3:02] took two of his young men with him and
[3:04] isaac his son and claimed the wood for
[3:06] the burnt offering and rose up and went
[3:08] under the place of which god had told
[3:10] him
[3:11] then on the third day abraham lifted up
[3:14] his eyes and saw the place afar off and
[3:17] abraham said unto his young men abide ye
[3:19] here with the ass and i and the lad will
[3:21] go yonder and worship and come again to
[3:23] you and abraham took the wood of the
[3:25] burnt offering and laid it upon isaac
[3:27] his son and he took the fire in his hand
[3:29] and a knife and they both
[3:31] of them they went both of them together
[3:34] and isaac spake unto abraham his father
[3:36] and said my father and he said here am i
[3:38] my son he said behold the fire and the
[3:40] wood but where is the lamb for a burnt
[3:43] offering
[3:44] and abraham said my son god will provide
[3:46] himself a lamb for a burnt offering so
[3:48] they went both of them together
[3:51] they came to the place which god had
[3:52] told him of
[3:54] and abraham built an altar this was a
[3:55] specific place disclosed by revelation
[3:58] where he went to build this altar builds
[4:00] an altar there and laid the wood in
[4:02] order
[4:03] and bound isaac his son
[4:05] and laid him on the altar upon the wood
[4:08] just that scene being described in such
[4:12] uh i'd say just clean language just so
[4:16] matter of fact i mean if any one of you
[4:18] said yeah we built an altar in the
[4:19] backyard today and bound our oldest son
[4:21] and put him on it i mean that's shocking
[4:23] but we read this
[4:24] and it just seems so you know so
[4:26] particularly very straightforward but
[4:28] that had to be
[4:29] such a tremendous scene
[4:31] and it never speaks of isaac saying
[4:34] anything and i i could even with
[4:35] conjecture think that that may have been
[4:37] exactly what happened as isaac said
[4:39] where's the lamb
[4:40] where's the offering and abraham said
[4:42] god will provide it and then isaac never
[4:45] opens his mouth again to object
[4:47] and how could we conject that because
[4:49] christ did the same thing as the sheep
[4:50] was done before his shears he he went
[4:52] and he allowed himself to be offered up
[4:54] as a sacrifice and that so that
[4:56] statement to me is so profound it says
[4:58] and abraham stretched forth his hand so
[5:00] now it's not just him dilly dallying
[5:02] with isaac upon the altar abraham
[5:04] stretches forth his hand and took the
[5:06] knife to slay his son god bless you you
[5:10] can be seated
[5:11] if i've left anybody in suspense it's in
[5:13] verse 11 that the lord stops them
[5:17] and isaac is not slain
[5:20] but then there's a ram in the thicket
[5:22] we're looking at supreme faith when we
[5:24] talk about supreme faith just using some
[5:27] principles here in the outset that we'll
[5:28] be reviewing and actually maybe for
[5:30] well i'll just say this this entire
[5:32] service is just laying putting another
[5:35] layer of paint or coat of paint upon
[5:36] what we've already ministered already so
[5:38] a lot of repetitive scriptures and
[5:40] themes but yet i believe it'll be deeper
[5:42] more colorful
[5:43] and so supreme faith when we look at it
[5:46] is rapturing faith i want you to see it
[5:48] as a rapturing faith or we could say
[5:51] perfect faith
[5:52] and this isn't to take any faith that
[5:54] has been exhibited in prior ages or any
[5:57] or the faith that we presently have and
[6:00] try to diminish it or demean it or say
[6:01] that it's not faith uh but we're talking
[6:03] about the faith that god gives us
[6:06] reaching
[6:07] its climax or
[6:09] meeting the mark that god has set for
[6:11] the age in that if there's a promise for
[6:13] the age god's faith brings this faith
[6:16] that god gives you comes to its
[6:17] realization and comes to the fulfillment
[6:20] of what has been promised and we see
[6:22] that perfect faith is that faith for the
[6:24] moment that's promised in this hour
[6:26] and another way that i've been pondering
[6:28] it is supreme faith rapture faith
[6:30] perfect faith it's also the supreme
[6:32] expression of gentile faith because the
[6:35] faith that we're coming to is not the
[6:38] perfection of a judaic faith or not the
[6:40] perfection of the faith and expectation
[6:43] of the natural seed of abraham but our
[6:45] faith is to be the supreme expression of
[6:47] the gentile faith and we see that
[6:50] gentile faith spoken of even in the
[6:51] ministry of christ who said i haven't
[6:54] seen a faith like this anywhere and what
[6:56] was it was the faith of the gentile to
[6:58] take god at his word
[6:59] and this kind of faith when we talk
[7:01] about rapturing faith or perfect faith
[7:03] um gentile faith it is a faith that is
[7:06] misunderstood
[7:08] and it's misunderstood not uh
[7:09] necessarily by the evil efforts of
[7:12] certain people or our ignorance our lack
[7:14] of sincerity it's just very easy to
[7:16] misunderstand faith which in itself is
[7:18] mysterious that you don't can't
[7:20] necessarily grasp it open it up and
[7:21] figure it out but it's something that
[7:23] god gives us and there's an element to
[7:25] it that always remains outside of our
[7:28] natural grasp and so faith can be easily
[7:31] misunderstood when we talk about gentile
[7:33] faith versus may the jewish faith and
[7:36] jewish traditions versus gentiles taking
[7:38] them out of his word there's a way that
[7:39] you can begin to make things compete
[7:42] and god's word never competes with
[7:43] itself
[7:44] and you have to take things in order and
[7:46] the way that god builds and structures
[7:47] things together and so this kind of
[7:49] faith can be very misunderstood and the
[7:52] way to this faith can seem impassable
[7:54] like here i am with the faith that i
[7:56] have now and i find myself getting
[7:58] frustrated i find myself doubting i find
[7:59] myself i can't hardly believe for a good
[8:01] day at work let alone a body change and
[8:04] it can be very discouraging to think how
[8:06] in the world am i going to have perfect
[8:07] faith to change this body when i find it
[8:10] really hard just to uh change my clothes
[8:14] or clean the house or whatever it might
[8:16] be that we find ourselves struggling
[8:17] with sometimes this is this is just
[8:19] being very natural with our language
[8:21] really this perfect faith that we speak
[8:23] of can seem uh too mysterious and out of
[8:25] reach and unable to obtain
[8:28] and the inspiration has been the supreme
[8:30] faith revealed in abraham
[8:32] when we cons we we accept that he's the
[8:34] father of faith and he's this luminary
[8:37] of believing god and taking god at his
[8:39] word and he became young again and his
[8:41] wife's womb was brought back to life to
[8:43] receive
[8:44] to have a son and he he met god at his
[8:46] tent door and he went and took his
[8:48] servants and slayed five kings and you
[8:50] read all these stories about abraham and
[8:52] we think oh my now that's a faith that
[8:55] um is never going to be achieved again
[8:57] but if you take a look at his life even
[9:00] chronologically or you just start
[9:01] looking at it and thinking more about
[9:03] what's happening and what events would
[9:06] have intervened during this time and not
[9:08] just taken these uh these glimpses into
[9:12] his life as being the way uh that every
[9:14] day he was conquering kings and every
[9:16] day elohim was meeting them for lunch
[9:18] for a lamb sandwich and look at what his
[9:20] life was like you can identify more with
[9:23] them and realize its way to rapture in
[9:25] faith is much more simple than maybe we
[9:27] think it is
[9:29] and his faith i want to use his faith as
[9:31] an example of rapturing faith
[9:33] and we've used this statement a number
[9:35] of times brother branham said
[9:37] and one day when god seen that his
[9:38] servant was determined to be an example
[9:41] for people of today
[9:44] and in this determination we know that
[9:46] god had set abraham to be an example of
[9:50] the of the children of faith and
[9:51] believers and and the example of the
[9:53] children of god so abraham is the father
[9:55] of faith so he is the the example person
[9:59] be dear followers of me
[10:01] as he says as a child follows his father
[10:04] so father the father of our faith sets
[10:06] an example it's god who had determined
[10:08] abraham to be an example not just for
[10:11] all the children of god but for people
[10:13] today
[10:15] so abraham was determined by god he had
[10:18] a determination he had a perseverance
[10:20] but he's also determined and set by god
[10:23] to be an example of the end time
[10:25] believer
[10:26] and the question that we're posing is
[10:28] wow how what was it about his life that
[10:31] speaks to us in terms of a
[10:34] a rapturing faith
[10:36] and in james chapter 2
[10:38] verses 21 and 22
[10:41] he's pointing to genesis chapter 22 and
[10:43] he says was not abraham our father
[10:45] justified by works when he had offered
[10:48] isaac his son upon the altar now james
[10:50] writes a statement
[10:52] that if you're that is very striking and
[10:55] seems to contradict paul's message that
[10:58] we are justified by faith and not by
[11:00] works
[11:01] and this is paul addressing
[11:04] the judaic tradition
[11:05] and circumcision and righteousness by
[11:08] the law
[11:09] he's saying the works of all never made
[11:12] a man righteous but it was abraham's
[11:14] faith
[11:16] in god and it was his faith alone that
[11:18] god imputed righteousness to him
[11:20] so now if we now we look at james side
[11:24] abraham believed god and by his faith
[11:26] righteousness is imputed to him but now
[11:29] james is looking at the practical
[11:31] outworking of genuine faith in a
[11:34] believer's life and he's saying that
[11:35] abraham now is vindicated and justified
[11:38] by his works in other words his works
[11:40] proved that he had a faith that imputed
[11:42] to him righteousness
[11:44] it's not it's not saying i'm holy i'm
[11:46] holy i'm holy and everyone looks at you
[11:48] and says are you talking about your
[11:49] pants because those only holes i see
[11:52] right you don't see the holiness you
[11:53] don't see you don't see a life that
[11:56] exemplifies holiness so this is
[11:58] uh this is james saying that abraham was
[12:00] he not justified by works when
[12:02] the works of offering isaac up as a
[12:05] sacrifice and he says see see us thou
[12:08] how faith wrought with his works
[12:10] and by works was faith made perfect and
[12:13] he's asking the questions see don't you
[12:15] see that by works was faith made perfect
[12:18] so we take this statement and we see
[12:20] that by faith
[12:22] that faith is where a works is faith
[12:24] expressed
[12:25] and that faith was made perfect or his
[12:27] faith reached its supreme expression
[12:31] when he offered up isaac as a sacrifice
[12:34] so there's a daily life of faith and
[12:36] there's expressions of faith there's
[12:38] instances of faith but then there's this
[12:40] ultimate expression where it's like okay
[12:42] well that was the ultimate he believed
[12:44] god he followed god he obeyed and even
[12:46] the language of god in genesis chapter
[12:49] 22 says now i know that you love me you
[12:51] kind of look back and say uh
[12:53] wouldn't you think the time that he
[12:54] began left er till now he had been
[12:56] proving but it was more this perfection
[13:00] of love and what begins in faith ends in
[13:02] the capstone of perfect love and you see
[13:04] this in abraham's life that what began
[13:06] in faith and faith
[13:08] is tied and connected together with love
[13:10] it reaches its full and supreme
[13:12] expression and it's something that was
[13:14] indivisible and something that couldn't
[13:16] be torn down something that couldn't be
[13:17] argued with and there was something
[13:19] expressed as an ultimate in his faith
[13:21] when he offered up his son
[13:24] so when we see that this
[13:26] is identified in the scriptures the
[13:27] supreme expression of abraham's faith
[13:30] how is this
[13:31] supreme faith an example of end time
[13:35] rapturing faith
[13:36] and if you listen if you were here
[13:37] wednesday night or listen to wednesday
[13:39] night we kind of really we came to this
[13:41] and went over this in great detail how
[13:44] that abraham's faith that we're calling
[13:45] supreme faith is an example of a
[13:48] rapturing faith that the bride has at
[13:49] the end time
[13:51] and and so
[13:52] and again i'm not i'm not repeating
[13:54] myself though i'm dealing with the same
[13:56] the same theme
[13:58] abraham's faith
[14:00] was not bound within this natural
[14:02] dimension
[14:04] and so abraham was not uh his faith did
[14:08] not merely exist or was resting upon
[14:11] things that we existed within light time
[14:13] and matter
[14:14] so he's not he's not looking at things
[14:17] seen and saying oh i can believe that
[14:18] and oh i can see that and and and it
[14:21] won't even go on by natural experience
[14:23] because tonight we could all make this
[14:24] bold prediction that the sun's going to
[14:26] come up in the morning
[14:28] and it wouldn't take faith right we
[14:30] wouldn't it wouldn't take much uh gift
[14:32] of prognostication to predict that the
[14:34] sun's gonna rise in the morning so
[14:36] really difficult to say that that's
[14:37] faith that's just experience that tells
[14:39] us that and so abraham's faith was not
[14:42] tied to the rising of the sun and the
[14:45] changing of the seasons
[14:47] and and by anything that would exist
[14:49] within light time and matter it was
[14:51] beyond natural time
[14:54] the things that abraham believed in and
[14:56] trusted were beyond the physical flesh
[14:58] remember how he's referred to as abram
[15:01] the hebrew
[15:02] and this this appellation this title of
[15:04] the hebrew it means one from beyond
[15:07] or one who's crossed over
[15:09] now to those in the time in that day
[15:11] that gave them the the the title or the
[15:13] nickname the hebrew they might have
[15:15] meant it as just some descriptive this
[15:17] guy came from beyond there and he came
[15:19] from the chaldeans and he's a little bit
[15:21] different talks a little bit differently
[15:22] he lives a little bit differently and so
[15:24] they might have called him the hebrew as
[15:25] one who crossed over and they might have
[15:28] had their own reasons but he's given
[15:30] this and it's preserved in scripture to
[15:32] speak about the testimony of abraham
[15:34] that as the hebrew he's one from beyond
[15:38] he's one who's crossed over so he's no
[15:40] longer just existing within this natural
[15:42] realm he's no longer bound by things um
[15:45] that can be seen and touched and felt
[15:47] he's living by faith and he's looking
[15:49] beyond the natural
[15:51] he's crossed
[15:52] over in hebrews chapter 11 verse 10. it
[15:55] says for he looked for a city which have
[15:57] foundations when he says have
[15:59] foundations it means permanent
[16:01] and then the permanence is now qualified
[16:04] as eternal whose builder and maker is
[16:06] god abraham this scripture tells us that
[16:10] abraham was searching for the eternal
[16:12] future home
[16:14] now this is
[16:15] i'm glad it's in the bible and this just
[16:17] isn't me trying to come up with a
[16:19] retrospective on abraham
[16:21] but he looked for a city
[16:23] and whose builder and maker was god this
[16:26] is abraham's faith now is visionary and
[16:29] he's looking for the future home
[16:31] there's something about his faith
[16:33] something about the quality of the
[16:34] things that have been revealed to him
[16:35] that he's already looking for the new
[16:37] jerusalem before jerusalem even exists
[16:40] it says in romans chapter 4 verse 17
[16:43] as it is written i have made the father
[16:45] of many nations before him whom he
[16:47] believed even god who quickeneth the
[16:50] dead and call it those things which be
[16:52] not as though they were
[16:55] this could be said of god even god
[16:58] who calleth those things which be not as
[17:00] though they are that god could speak
[17:02] things and call things as if they exist
[17:04] even though they don't exist but this is
[17:06] also expressive of abraham's faith who
[17:09] could say and speak things even though
[17:10] they didn't exist he could speak in sp
[17:13] as if they already did as if they would
[17:15] be so but it's because he believed in
[17:17] god so this is uh this is the thrust and
[17:20] the emphasis that i'm taking again this
[17:22] morning abraham's actions in genesis
[17:25] chapter 22 him being able to take his
[17:28] son isaac laid the wood in order bind
[17:30] his son lame upon the altar and bring
[17:33] the knife back to kill his son and to
[17:36] shed the blood of his son in obedience
[17:38] to god's command who says abram get the
[17:40] up go to the land of mariah to a
[17:41] specific mount that i'm going to show
[17:43] you and offer up your son your only son
[17:45] whom you love almost as if god's rubbing
[17:47] it in
[17:48] and offer him to me as a sacrifice
[17:50] abraham's actions in genesis chapter 22
[17:54] testified of his revelation of the
[17:57] nature of god
[17:59] that it's we shouldn't we shouldn't and
[18:01] i want to be very careful the way i
[18:02] express this and again this is kind of a
[18:06] an outflow from a progression from blind
[18:09] trust bad faith
[18:11] that when we look at what abraham's
[18:12] doing let's not dumb it down to think
[18:15] that abraham was just oh you want me to
[18:17] kill my son i'll kill my son
[18:20] because sometimes i believe that as
[18:22] since we're
[18:23] we use this title as believers
[18:26] and we become such
[18:28] ardent believers
[18:30] that we become gullible
[18:32] or we become believers without bases
[18:34] and we just
[18:35] accept things because somebody said it
[18:38] and because we hear it through a certain
[18:39] uh from a certain place and it works it
[18:41] begins to work against us because
[18:43] abraham's faith was not just oh you want
[18:45] me to do this i'll do this this is we're
[18:47] looking at genesis chapter 22 where he
[18:49] understood what he was doing
[18:52] this is in genesis chapter 12 this is
[18:54] genesis chapter 22. and brother branham
[18:56] said that we've got to move up to
[18:58] supreme faith
[19:00] and he says we've got to move up to a
[19:01] faith to a supreme faith and he says and
[19:03] to do that you have to know perfectly
[19:05] what you're doing
[19:07] so you're looking at a maturing and a
[19:09] growing from faith taking god at his
[19:11] word and you trust him and then what
[19:12] does he do he does exactly what he says
[19:14] and then he says something again and you
[19:16] trust him he does exactly what he says
[19:18] and then what you should begin to do is
[19:20] begin to understand the nature of god
[19:23] and this is what we do with our children
[19:24] our children are not taught to just do
[19:26] what mom and dad say our children are
[19:28] taught that what mom and dad say to do
[19:30] have a reason behind it and there's a
[19:32] wisdom associated with it that through
[19:34] repetition and discipline by a certain
[19:36] time in a certain age they begin to
[19:38] understand the wisdom behind the
[19:40] instructions they begin to understand
[19:42] wisdom behind the parameters wisdom
[19:44] behind the correction wisdom behind the
[19:46] the standard within the home and then
[19:48] they can take the character and wisdom
[19:50] of that and when your dad says hey son
[19:53] do this he's like i know exactly what
[19:55] you mean when you say that i know i know
[19:57] the thought behind it i know the motive
[19:59] behind it i know what you expect from it
[20:01] i know why you're asking me to do it and
[20:03] it's not just this yes sir if you say
[20:05] jump i say how high i'm going to do
[20:06] whatever you tell me
[20:08] and let's let's just be honest that's
[20:10] how some churches are run right
[20:12] i'm the boss you do what i say and don't
[20:14] and don't question
[20:16] but that's not how even god is it's not
[20:18] even how god is it's not what god
[20:20] desires with with his children as he
[20:22] wants us and i mentioned that because
[20:24] there's dynamics that we can grow up and
[20:25] whether it be households or churches or
[20:27] religions or certain cults where that's
[20:29] kind of the mindset that we're under
[20:31] when it comes to following god and god
[20:34] wants you to understand he wants you to
[20:36] know he wants you to know his heart and
[20:38] have an intimate personal relationship
[20:40] with him
[20:41] brother was sharing with me recently
[20:42] that even his entire walk with the lord
[20:45] that in some ways god was just some kind
[20:47] of construct that he could view the
[20:49] world through but over the last year or
[20:51] so that he's become personal to him
[20:53] realizes no this is an intimate
[20:55] relationship where this is a person and
[20:57] it completely transforms everything
[21:00] it changes the way that we relate to
[21:02] god's word when we take it in that
[21:03] personal way
[21:05] and so abraham's actions in genesis
[21:07] chapter 22 are testifying of his
[21:10] revelation of the character of god
[21:13] it speaks to his understanding of the
[21:15] nature of god to where it's that
[21:18] he he wakes up in the morning and god
[21:20] speaks to him and tells him to sacrifice
[21:21] his son or god speaks to him in the
[21:22] evening hey take my son
[21:24] and sacrifice him abraham is it's even
[21:27] though it's not
[21:28] recorded he
[21:30] he just he just acts as if this would
[21:32] have been a common occurrence
[21:34] like oh yeah i knew this was coming
[21:36] but instead of instead of
[21:39] just painting abraham and i know i'm
[21:41] really emphasizing instead of painting
[21:43] abraham as just a yes man who's just
[21:45] going to do whatever anything that god
[21:46] said
[21:47] and he was just so obedient he just did
[21:49] whatever he was said he's now coming
[21:51] from the standpoint of trusting the lord
[21:54] and seeing a pattern on a daily routine
[21:57] of following the plan of god he'd come
[21:58] to a place to know
[22:00] that there was more intended and meant
[22:02] in this request than just the mirror
[22:04] following through with the activity
[22:08] because it says here that he believed
[22:10] and he believed in whom he believed
[22:12] before him whom he believed abraham is
[22:15] the father of many nations and he
[22:16] believed god and this is the this is how
[22:19] paul writes it who quickens the dead
[22:22] notice he believes in a god who gives
[22:24] life to the dead so this is this is part
[22:27] of abraham's understanding
[22:29] of the nature and character of god
[22:32] when he trusts god to go take his son
[22:35] upon the altar
[22:36] he believes in a god who gives life to
[22:39] the dead now in this prophecy even in
[22:42] paul ryan's who quickeneth the dead this
[22:44] no doubt refers to the birth and the
[22:46] rescue of isaac upon the altar but it's
[22:48] also prophecy of the resurrection of
[22:50] jesus christ
[22:52] because jesus christ listen when god
[22:55] offered up christ as a sacrifice when
[22:58] christ even willingly offered himself up
[23:00] as a sacrifice do you are we not
[23:03] aware that christ said i have power to
[23:05] lay down my life
[23:07] and
[23:08] to raise it up again he says this
[23:10] commandment have i received from my
[23:11] father so his father commanded him to
[23:13] lay down his life but that was not the
[23:15] end of the commandment he was also given
[23:18] a commandment by the father that it
[23:19] would be raised back up so christ knew
[23:22] that this sacrifice was joined together
[23:25] with resurrection and so god when he
[23:27] told abraham to sacrifice isaac upon the
[23:30] altar that god was also giving him a
[23:32] revelation of the power over death
[23:36] because this had already been
[23:37] exemplified in the life of abraham
[23:40] the promise was from god himself
[23:44] who makes the dead alive again
[23:46] this is what this is what the scripture
[23:48] is trying to tell us that abraham's
[23:50] faith was based upon his faith is
[23:52] connected in a god who has power over
[23:54] the greatest to the least
[23:58] i know sometimes the question is asked
[23:59] if you could have a superpower what
[24:00] would it be
[24:03] and um
[24:05] i always kind of enjoy that conversation
[24:07] especially with children because you can
[24:09] uh there's certain things that they that
[24:12] they can come up with it's really wow
[24:14] that's bizarre
[24:15] and uh and and it's debatable could you
[24:17] be invisible or could you travel like a
[24:19] thought on these different things
[24:21] uh but god is the all
[24:23] the you know all superpower
[24:26] he's the all-powerful almighty god
[24:29] and he has and if you think of this
[24:31] eternity isn't this the most incredible
[24:34] characteristic of god
[24:35] is eternal isn't it the one thing about
[24:37] god that we can't get our heads around
[24:40] that it never did begin
[24:42] it will never have an end
[24:44] so this is a god that you can't quite
[24:46] you can't get your
[24:48] arms around him
[24:49] because he never began and he never ends
[24:52] and so he's a god now this is the
[24:53] character of god he believes in a god
[24:55] who is eternal who gave him eternal
[24:58] promises because he said i will be an
[25:00] everlasting god to you
[25:02] and he's and this is the revelation
[25:04] that's dawned in on abraham he's going
[25:05] to be my god forever well then that
[25:08] means this promise is forever
[25:10] i'm going to give this land to you and
[25:12] your seed forever
[25:13] okay
[25:14] abraham's revelation now is being
[25:16] connected beyond natural life he'd seen
[25:18] his brother die he's seen his father die
[25:20] he had seen death he'd seen the deadness
[25:21] of his wife's womb at wife's womb and he
[25:24] knew that there's not no way that even
[25:26] there's death to my lineage now there's
[25:28] no my name is going to end here in his
[25:30] mind at a certain point and so but now
[25:33] he begins to see this promise is beyond
[25:35] this
[25:38] and abraham was asked to believe
[25:41] in something beyond nature
[25:44] for him to be able to have a child with
[25:46] his wife
[25:47] it was beyond nature
[25:50] to this point he would have known
[25:52] my wife and i are unable to have
[25:53] children
[25:56] and so he had to trust in god alone
[26:00] he believed in a god who quickeneth the
[26:01] dead and called those things which be
[26:03] not as though they were
[26:05] and so his faith
[26:06] i know this is this is repetition and
[26:09] i'm repeating this his faith was
[26:11] directed towards a god who had power to
[26:13] give life
[26:15] and this is part of his understanding
[26:16] it's not this blind faith in a god and
[26:19] oh neat look he can raise the dead it's
[26:21] part of his understanding of the nature
[26:23] and character of god that he believed in
[26:25] a god who could give life he believed in
[26:27] a god who could who could resurrect he
[26:29] believed in a god who was giving him an
[26:31] eternal promise i will be your god
[26:32] forever this will be your land forever
[26:34] and so abraham is catching a revelation
[26:36] of eternity these eternal promises so
[26:40] this is how paul continues in romans 4
[26:42] verse 19
[26:43] and being not weak in faith he
[26:45] considered not his own body
[26:47] now dead
[26:48] so catch now i want you to catch how
[26:50] abraham's faith that he believed the
[26:52] father of many nations the father of our
[26:54] faith how that his faith now keeps him
[26:57] from considering his own body which is
[26:59] dead and this is the language that paul
[27:01] is emphasizing about abraham's faith
[27:04] when he was about a hundred years old
[27:05] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[27:08] so abraham had a faith to where he did
[27:10] not need to regard the deadness of his
[27:12] own body nor did he need to regard the
[27:14] deadness of sarah's womb why because he
[27:16] believed in a god which quickens the
[27:18] dead he could look at something that was
[27:21] hopeless lost dead gone buried and he
[27:23] could say well i have i believe in a god
[27:26] who can resurrect who can restore who
[27:28] can bring back who can redeem
[27:31] so he considers not the deadness of his
[27:33] own body nor the deadness of sarah's
[27:34] womb he staggered not at the promise of
[27:36] god through unbelief so if we want to
[27:38] attribute abraham staggering at all he
[27:41] does not stagger through unbelief but
[27:42] was strong in faith giving glory to god
[27:45] and being fully persuaded that what he
[27:48] had promised he was able also to perform
[27:53] abraham was fully persuaded that what
[27:55] god promised he was able to perform this
[27:59] is a man who understands the nature and
[28:02] character of god and he's fully
[28:04] persuaded
[28:06] that whatever promise god made he began
[28:09] to go through this progressive
[28:10] revelation where he could absolutely
[28:12] trust in the nature and character of god
[28:15] that even if my body is dead and my
[28:17] wife's womb is dead this body and that
[28:20] womb is going to bring forth a son named
[28:22] isaac because i have faith in a god who
[28:25] is able to bring that to pass
[28:29] and the scripture is specifically
[28:31] positioning his faith against death
[28:35] do you recognize that
[28:36] again remember i asked i posed the
[28:38] question uh
[28:40] to you i know you weren't asking me the
[28:42] question so i'm on the spot i can pose
[28:44] the question because i've already worked
[28:45] on the answer but it posed a question
[28:47] how is his faith an example determined
[28:50] to be an example for people of today
[28:51] abraham is an example he read those
[28:53] statements
[28:54] several statements a few wednesdays ago
[28:56] him being the example the example of the
[28:57] example he's the example of this faith
[28:59] in this end time faith and then we begin
[29:01] to identify in the scripture this is how
[29:03] his faith is being positioned against
[29:06] death
[29:08] and in genesis chapter 22 verse 4 as we
[29:11] read it in the outset then on the third
[29:13] day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw
[29:16] the place of far off it is on the third
[29:18] day that he comes to this mount moriah
[29:21] and where god appears to him as jehovah
[29:23] jireh the god who sees the one who's
[29:26] going to he going to provide a sacrifice
[29:29] the one that's going to set this example
[29:31] that as god i have trusted god and he's
[29:34] met my needs for all those who trust in
[29:37] him he will meet their needs it's on the
[29:39] third day that this happens and it's
[29:41] this pattern that he establishes in
[29:43] abraham and then we see it come up again
[29:45] in christ who is then the fulfillment of
[29:47] what isaac typified or what he was a
[29:50] foreshadow of and it's on the third day
[29:52] that christ is resurrected
[29:57] it's on the third day resurrection day
[30:01] his actions are speaking of power over
[30:03] death and a resurrection
[30:05] and in jehovah jireh brother branham
[30:07] says you provided a resurrection in form
[30:10] there for isaac who had come to the end
[30:12] of his road
[30:14] this is the language that we can
[30:15] identify in the word of god that when
[30:17] god provided this ram and he gave this
[30:20] this ram was caught in this thicket and
[30:23] then and they in the angel lord stops
[30:25] his hand
[30:26] and behold god creates this lamb this
[30:29] ram caught in this thicket
[30:31] and he has the sacrifice it's recorded
[30:34] as a resurrection in type
[30:38] to for isaac
[30:40] and then it says in hebrews chapter 11
[30:42] verses 17 to 19.
[30:49] everybody doing good today
[30:52] uh you uh
[30:53] you're a smiling people i like that
[30:55] even even though i might be the angry
[30:57] preacher i'm up here just preaching
[30:59] about the love of god through clinched
[31:00] teeth and you guys are smiling and i
[31:03] appreciate that if i look angry i'm not
[31:07] um if i'm in am angry i think you you'll
[31:09] you'll be able to tell
[31:11] and it might be when i'm smiling
[31:14] but uh
[31:16] i just feel really good this morning and
[31:17] comfortable so i trust you you do as
[31:19] well
[31:20] because i could get too comfortable
[31:21] making maybe take advantage of and
[31:23] you're all like
[31:26] you're killing me
[31:28] notice how the scripture places it
[31:30] hebrews 11 17 18 and 19 by faith abraham
[31:33] when he was tried offered up isaac
[31:36] and he that had received the promises
[31:38] offered up his only begotten son what a
[31:41] incredible structure of this that by
[31:43] faith he offered up isaac
[31:46] this is this is incredible this is a
[31:48] testing this is a trine but yet it's by
[31:50] faith he offers up isaac and the one who
[31:52] had received the promises what promises
[31:54] eternal inheritance and turtle seed
[31:56] eternal all these things offered up his
[31:58] only begotten son of whom it was said
[32:00] that in isaac shall thy seed be called
[32:02] so it's the paradox of it kill your son
[32:05] the one through whom you're going to be
[32:06] blessed and all people of the earth are
[32:07] going to be blessed
[32:09] so then it's
[32:11] this to me is just a reciting of what
[32:14] ought to be recognized about abraham's
[32:16] faith
[32:17] he knew he was fully persuaded of god's
[32:20] promises to isaac so he was like if
[32:22] you're asking me to kill him you're
[32:24] obligated to resurrect him
[32:27] if this is what you're asking me to do
[32:29] then i'm going to see a greater miracle
[32:30] because i received isaac as one from the
[32:33] dead when my wife's womb which was dead
[32:35] which could never conceive did conceive
[32:37] and brought forth the son isaac
[32:38] according to your promise and if you did
[32:41] that and through him all the families of
[32:43] the earth are going to be blessed and
[32:44] you're wanting him to die by whatever
[32:46] cause and by what other whatever means
[32:48] even if it's by my own hand you are
[32:50] under obligation according to the
[32:52] promise according to the word which has
[32:54] been spoken beforehand this is not
[32:56] conjecture this is not imagination this
[32:58] is not superstition this is not rumor
[33:00] this is not mythology god had spoken it
[33:03] he had a revelation of it and so it led
[33:05] him to an understanding and a
[33:07] progressive revelation to say you made
[33:09] the promise then if this is what you're
[33:11] asking me to do then the results of this
[33:13] is going to be a resurrection and if we
[33:16] could catch that as the seed of abraham
[33:18] then if we just do what god has asked us
[33:21] to do the results of it are going to be
[33:24] exactly what he promised
[33:27] even if it doesn't seem well this isn't
[33:28] what it seems like what he promised and
[33:30] this isn't the resurrection that he i
[33:31] thought he or this isn't how i thought
[33:33] things were going to unfold just trust
[33:34] him
[33:35] may not it doesn't seem like it's
[33:37] unfolding in the way that you had the
[33:38] picture all planned out and the way you
[33:40] thought it was going to be but just
[33:41] trust them
[33:42] this is what abraham came to because in
[33:44] verse 19 it says accounting that
[33:45] reckoning that recognizing and believing
[33:47] that god was able to raise him up even
[33:50] from the dead
[33:53] from whence also he received him in a
[33:55] figure
[33:56] in other words i know this doesn't take
[33:58] a lot of study to be able to come up
[34:00] with this construction in other words
[34:01] abraham believed god could resurrect
[34:04] isaac
[34:06] this is part of his faith
[34:08] he believed that
[34:09] he had already witnessed the power of
[34:12] life over death considering that not
[34:14] considering the deadness of his own body
[34:15] not considering the deadness of his
[34:17] wife's womb he had already seen the
[34:19] power of life over death
[34:22] and i want to emphasize this because i
[34:24] don't want to lose sight of this this is
[34:25] the progressive revelation of abraham's
[34:28] faith to supreme faith
[34:32] he didn't say and again i'm not trying
[34:34] to be crude and i realize that it does
[34:36] in a way make us laugh
[34:38] but i don't do it to be crude
[34:40] it's not that abraham came you know hat
[34:43] was uh
[34:44] you know had had some gourd soup one
[34:46] night and started having these uh uh
[34:51] imaginations and these visions and
[34:53] hallucinations
[34:55] and in this hallucination he thought he
[34:56] met god
[34:58] and god was a rastafarian who told him
[35:00] to kill his wife he said your wife is
[35:02] going to have a son and the whole
[35:03] world's going to be blessed by her but i
[35:04] want you to kill her first
[35:06] i know might seem to be a little bit
[35:08] crude of me dramatizing it that way but
[35:10] notice that what this is the offer in
[35:14] genesis chapter 22 is coming after a
[35:16] longer period of god disclosing himself
[35:19] to abraham
[35:22] and so it's built upon this trust and
[35:24] the faith that abraham had when he left
[35:27] er
[35:28] in the land of the counties and he left
[35:29] the leaves the valley of shinar when
[35:31] he's leaving he had faith no doubt that
[35:33] he had had faith but that faith still
[35:36] brought him to a place where he was
[35:37] still with his father and with his
[35:39] family
[35:40] and god had to basically say no your
[35:42] faith has got to take you further than
[35:44] that because he had to separate from his
[35:45] father's house and then it came and i'm
[35:47] kind of getting into some other areas
[35:49] that we'd like to amplify later but then
[35:51] he finally had to separate from lot why
[35:52] because god's promise was i can't bless
[35:55] you until
[35:56] and so we wouldn't say off abraham
[35:58] wasn't a believer abraham wasn't a
[35:59] believer abraham wasn't a believer no
[36:01] this is just progressive revelation this
[36:03] is just him and his faith growing to
[36:05] where finally he separates from lot and
[36:07] these events are taking place and his
[36:09] life testifies of faith to supreme faith
[36:16] and his faith was a rev revelation
[36:20] even as it says in my redeemer lives
[36:21] brother bram said i've had the same kind
[36:23] of vision we're up yonder on a mountain
[36:24] when christ god met me and give me his
[36:26] redemptive names as jehovah jireh
[36:28] jehovah rapha and all these abraham this
[36:30] revelation of the what the nature and
[36:32] character of god he says of abraham
[36:34] seeing the death burial and resurrection
[36:38] these are things that abraham saw
[36:41] he saw
[36:42] these this character these
[36:44] characteristics and attributes of god
[36:46] this was a revelation of god
[36:49] and it's disclosing and i'm i'm zeroing
[36:52] in on a specific attribute because i
[36:53] want you to recognize this as part of
[36:55] abraham's supreme faith it's disclosing
[36:57] a specific attribute resurrection
[37:01] in my redeemer liveth again this is just
[37:03] a little bit later i've laid this is
[37:04] abraham speaking i laid him he talked
[37:06] about isaac laid him on the altar was
[37:08] going to take his own life knowing that
[37:09] i had received him as one from the dead
[37:12] i believe that he would raise him up
[37:13] again and through this great hope that
[37:16] beats in my heart i know
[37:18] he said that he could raise him up it
[37:21] was a foresight of the resurrection
[37:25] this is this is what abraham has seen he
[37:28] sees a revelation he has a revelation of
[37:31] a resurrection
[37:33] so his revelation that god could raise
[37:35] up isaac is foreshadowing that god can
[37:38] raise up jesus christ and would raise up
[37:40] jesus christ and that all the royal seed
[37:44] of abraham would be resurrected one day
[37:48] this is the revelation he has he says it
[37:50] was a four side of the resurrection the
[37:51] same thing that job had
[37:55] now that's that connects it with this
[37:56] tremendous faith of job
[37:59] and what did job say for i know that my
[38:00] redeemer liveth
[38:02] and he shall stand at the latter day
[38:05] upon the earth and though after my skin
[38:08] worms destroy this body yet in my flesh
[38:11] shall i see god
[38:14] this is the revelation that job has this
[38:16] is a remarkable revelation in the
[38:18] context of the book of job and even in
[38:21] the context of scripture because it's
[38:23] the most clear
[38:24] enunciation of a resurrection or life
[38:26] after death or at the very least power
[38:29] over death because he's saying at the
[38:31] end of time at the end of days in the
[38:33] last days he at the latter day upon the
[38:35] earth my redeemer is going to be there
[38:38] in the latter day upon the earth and he
[38:40] says even if this body is destroyed i'll
[38:43] be standing there in my body and it
[38:46] applies to implies two things either
[38:48] he'll live forever to be there
[38:51] or if i die i'll come back up but
[38:54] regardless i'll be there
[38:57] that's the revelation that job gets and
[38:59] what is it that brother branham teaches
[39:00] us time and time and time again he says
[39:03] he saw the coming of the lord
[39:06] now when he says he saw the coming of
[39:08] the lord i think we ought to be very
[39:09] careful not to try to put it on any
[39:11] particular
[39:12] uh um
[39:14] the third coming or some other coming
[39:16] but just he saw the coming of the lord
[39:19] he saw the manifestation of god that
[39:21] would give power over death
[39:23] he saw this manifestation of god that
[39:26] was going to either cause a body which
[39:28] had been destroyed by his own its own
[39:30] worms and decayed come back to life
[39:32] again or god that would preserve his
[39:35] flesh to stand with his redeemer
[39:38] i know my redeemer liveth he will bring
[39:41] back he will restore he will raise back
[39:44] up this is the revelation that job had
[39:47] he says that abraham had the same
[39:49] revelation he had a foresight of the
[39:51] resurrection abraham's supreme faith
[39:54] testified of rapturing faith
[39:58] abraham's faith testified of
[40:00] resurrection faith
[40:02] abraham saw what job saw what did job
[40:05] see the resurrection
[40:07] what did abraham see foresight of the
[40:09] resurrection this is a specific
[40:11] manifestation of god
[40:13] john chapter 11 verses 25 to 26 jesus
[40:16] said unto her i am
[40:18] the resurrection and the life
[40:21] now think about it then
[40:23] i am the resurrection and the life he
[40:25] that believeth in me though he were dead
[40:28] yet shall he live
[40:30] now let's pause let's just slow down for
[40:32] a moment and think about
[40:33] uh abraham who considered not the dead
[40:36] his dead body or the deadness of sarah's
[40:39] womb or the practical outcome of killing
[40:43] his son isaac which would be death
[40:45] because he had a foresight of the
[40:47] resurrection which means though
[40:49] something is dead yet it shall live and
[40:52] so abraham had this tremendous faith in
[40:54] this
[40:55] revelation of the resurrection but now i
[40:57] don't want you to think well it must
[40:59] have been a particular day that abraham
[41:01] saw
[41:02] and he had a vision of one day all his
[41:04] seed been resurrected no it was a
[41:07] revelation of a person who one of his
[41:09] essential attributes and characteristics
[41:11] was he's eternal life and he resurrects
[41:14] the dead because jesus says i am the
[41:17] resurrection as as we said oh i know one
[41:20] day in the resurrection my brother will
[41:22] live again he's saying well
[41:24] i am the resurrection it's not a future
[41:26] event it's a present person and when the
[41:29] word comes when he who is the dynamic
[41:31] comes then there's where the power of
[41:34] the rapture lies there's where the power
[41:36] of the resurrection lies he says i am
[41:38] the resurrection and the life
[41:41] he that believeth in me though a won't
[41:44] be dead though a body be dead yet it
[41:46] shall live
[41:49] and then
[41:50] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[41:52] shall never die
[41:55] there's the resurrection and a rapture
[41:57] those who are dead who are resurrected
[41:59] and those who are alive and remain and
[42:01] do not taste death he says believeth
[42:04] thou this
[42:05] and we say this i believe
[42:10] jesus christ is the resurrection
[42:12] then we can see then that abraham's
[42:14] revelation brought christ into view
[42:17] this is what he's seen
[42:20] and his faith is an example for us at
[42:22] the end time
[42:23] his faith holds a mystery of rapturing
[42:27] faith his life his example holds a
[42:29] mystery of rapturing faith
[42:31] it is something embodied in it's
[42:33] something exemplified by his life
[42:37] where god speaks to him he obeys god
[42:40] reveals himself to him and he walks it
[42:42] is a life that he lived he had a life
[42:45] that was lived by revelation and he
[42:47] walked with god he walked in this faith
[42:48] a life of faith
[42:53] the part i really want you to catch
[42:54] about him as it was a daily life
[42:59] i know i'm going very slow i i got
[43:01] started i was given
[43:02] a lot of grace to start early today and
[43:04] i feel like i've um
[43:06] just be labored too long and taken a lot
[43:08] of your time i apologize
[43:11] i want to read this scripture in mark
[43:12] chapter 12 verses 23 to 27.
[43:16] when i typed it i typed it as march
[43:18] chapter 12. i was like well
[43:21] let's go forth but it's mark chapter 12.
[43:23] i'm glad i caught it before i put it on
[43:25] a slide
[43:27] he says in the resurrection this is the
[43:29] question that they're posing to jesus
[43:31] mark chapter 12 verse 23 to 27 they had
[43:33] quite the hypothetical right a man gets
[43:35] married and he dies and his brother has
[43:37] to marry and then he dies and it's quite
[43:39] in the resurrection therefore when they
[43:41] shall rise all these brothers whose wife
[43:43] shall she be of them this woman
[43:45] who had the the fortunate blessing of
[43:47] being married to seven brothers
[43:50] for the seven had her to wife
[43:53] and jesus answered and said in him quite
[43:55] a question in the resurrection and and i
[43:57] think if i recall and i
[43:59] is
[44:00] the paradox of it is people who didn't
[44:02] believe in the resurrection are trying
[44:03] to trap him on in the resurrection whose
[44:05] wife is going to be
[44:06] but there's your bad faith arguments
[44:08] that we often receive from people it
[44:09] says for the seven hatter the wife jesus
[44:11] answering said unto him
[44:13] said unto them i want you to catch his
[44:16] answer to this hypothetical that's
[44:18] trying to trap jesus but this truth i
[44:21] almost want to stand outside of the
[44:22] context of the question
[44:24] do you not therefore air because ye know
[44:26] not the scriptures neither of the power
[44:29] of god
[44:30] i'm wanting to i'm wanting to emphasize
[44:32] that abraham's revelation of christ or
[44:34] revelation of god gave him an
[44:36] understanding of the nature and
[44:38] character of god and the power of god
[44:40] and so he says their problem now is they
[44:42] wrestle with this hypothetical of this
[44:44] woman who was married to seven brothers
[44:45] in the resurrection whose wife is she
[44:47] going to be he's saying you don't know
[44:49] the scriptures and you're ignorant of
[44:51] the power of god
[44:53] and he says for when they shall rise
[44:55] from the dead so he's affirming there
[44:57] will be a resurrection they never
[44:59] neither marry nor are given in marriage
[45:01] but are as the angels which are in
[45:03] heaven and as touching the dead that
[45:05] they rise have you not read in the book
[45:08] of moses how in the bush god spake unto
[45:10] him saying
[45:12] i am the god of abraham and the god of
[45:14] isaac and the god of jacob now these are
[45:17] people who constantly said and i say
[45:19] constantly because it's recorded in the
[45:21] gospels constantly and so it's some of
[45:23] the same instances being repeated but
[45:25] they were always going we're of our
[45:27] father abraham we have father abraham
[45:29] and jesus used abraham quite often with
[45:31] them as far as the seed of abraham your
[45:33] children of abraham she's the daughter
[45:34] of abraham even in the parable of of of
[45:37] the of lazarus uh going to the going to
[45:41] uh being past beyond being in the bosom
[45:43] of abraham this is a very central figure
[45:45] obviously to the faith of the jews
[45:48] and he's saying did not even god when he
[45:50] spoke to moses identify himself as i am
[45:53] the god of abraham and the god of isaac
[45:55] and the god of jacob and this is the
[45:57] rebuke of those who know not the
[45:58] scriptures nor the power of god and
[46:00] would not believe in the resurrection he
[46:02] is not the god of the dead but the god
[46:04] of the living ye therefore do greatly
[46:07] air
[46:09] this is the revelation that abraham had
[46:11] when god disclosed himself and he became
[46:13] the god of abraham he knew that god's
[46:16] position and his character and his
[46:19] nature required that there would be a
[46:21] people eternally existing in
[46:23] relationship to him for the also for
[46:26] that all of his attributes would be
[46:27] eternally manifested
[46:29] and so jesus said you air because you
[46:31] don't know the power of god god is not
[46:34] just the god of people who live this
[46:35] temporary existence and he has control
[46:37] over him and they're done and gone he
[46:39] gives you a way to good will and he
[46:40] doesn't need you anymore needs to go buy
[46:42] new toys no he's saying once mine always
[46:45] mine
[46:48] and he and he holds the this title of i
[46:51] am the god he speaks of himself i am the
[46:53] god of abraham and of the god of isaac
[46:55] and the god of jacob in other words
[46:57] these men must live
[47:01] because he's a god of the living not the
[47:03] god of the dead
[47:04] he doesn't speak of this of the dead
[47:07] you say i'm the god of quran i did i'm
[47:09] not the god of of these others who were
[47:11] dead he identified himself with those
[47:13] that are living
[47:15] and just to to seal this in in terms of
[47:17] what abraham was seeing in john chapter
[47:19] 8 verse 56 we read it wednesday night at
[47:22] the end your father abraham rejoiced to
[47:23] see my day
[47:26] his soul
[47:28] leapt forward in expectation
[47:30] to the revelation of jesus christ to his
[47:32] people
[47:33] this is something he says your father
[47:35] rejoiced to see my day there was this
[47:37] this part of this expectation to see my
[47:39] redeemer living this
[47:41] expectation to see this seed come and
[47:44] and it speaks of even how abraham must
[47:46] have had a soul
[47:48] travel forward in time to see this day
[47:51] when christ is being revealed to
[47:53] abraham's seed and then it says this to
[47:56] round it out and he saw it
[47:59] and was glad
[48:00] he beheld it to his joy
[48:04] this is something that it said of
[48:06] abraham that it's not just merely him
[48:09] having a vision or him hoping or him
[48:12] having some expectation but he rejoiced
[48:14] to see my day and he saw this day
[48:19] is something he saw and was glad what
[48:22] did abraham see
[48:26] and and this is that this is the point
[48:27] at which i feel like maybe i've preached
[48:29] long enough to where we could just end
[48:30] it right here
[48:32] and um
[48:33] don't get too excited
[48:38] and so it's at this point i feel that we
[48:40] can maybe just leave it with
[48:42] again this kind of this point that we
[48:44] ended on wednesday night in a lot of
[48:45] ways
[48:47] but what did abraham see
[48:50] and because really i gotta say all right
[48:52] then let's go back to genesis chapter 11
[48:54] and just begin going verse by verse and
[48:56] identifying jesus christ in every verse
[48:59] in this progressive revelation of jesus
[49:01] christ to abraham and and how it
[49:03] manifested itself when there was uh
[49:06] circumstances
[49:08] related to physical problems
[49:09] circumstances related to political
[49:11] problems circumstances related to
[49:12] relationship problems circumstances
[49:14] related to strife in the family
[49:16] circumstances related to estrangement
[49:17] from extended family circumstances
[49:19] related to family who's backslidden goes
[49:21] out to the world all these different
[49:22] circumstances in abraham's life that he
[49:24] lived through
[49:26] that gives us hope and faith for our
[49:28] lives
[49:30] but what did abraham see
[49:33] he saw christ in melchizedek in genesis
[49:35] chapter 13 14.
[49:37] did he not
[49:39] does not the scripture afterwards verify
[49:41] that he has made a high priest forever
[49:42] after order of melchizedek and so this
[49:44] melchizedek this mysterious one that
[49:46] paul said he had more he wanted to talk
[49:47] about but he couldn't do it then because
[49:49] they weren't mature enough to take it he
[49:50] saw christ in melchizedek in genesis 14.
[49:53] he saw christ in the days of lot
[49:57] the days of lot jesus identified as the
[49:59] time in which judgment rained down upon
[50:01] sodom and gomorrah he saw christ in the
[50:03] days of lot when did he see him in
[50:04] genesis chapter 18 verse 1 when he
[50:06] appeared to him in the plains of memory
[50:08] again in a theophonic form
[50:10] just as he had been in melchizedek he
[50:12] saw christ in the days of lot in the
[50:14] plains of memory abraham saw the
[50:16] revelation of jesus christ
[50:19] abraham saw it jesus said abraham saw me
[50:24] he even said before abraham was i am
[50:28] so there is something about god
[50:30] manifesting himself in declaring himself
[50:32] jesus christ is the living word that
[50:35] makes god present he was before abraham
[50:38] and he is and he is so that he said
[50:40] before abraham was i am that's before
[50:43] the natural days of jesus of nazareth
[50:45] and then paul says have i not met jesus
[50:47] christ our lord this is after the days
[50:50] of jesus of nazareth so jesus christ is
[50:52] more than this man who walked the shores
[50:54] of galilee and thank god because the
[50:57] revelation you have today is not a
[50:59] personal lunch with jesus nazareth but
[51:01] it's a revelation of jesus christ
[51:03] personally to you
[51:07] he saw him and the bible says the royal
[51:09] seed of abraham
[51:10] will see the same thing
[51:13] right this is where i'm drawing on your
[51:14] maturity in the message of the hour the
[51:15] bible promises the same revelation will
[51:18] come to the royal seat of abraham
[51:20] in the day when the son of man will be
[51:22] revealed
[51:24] who did abraham see
[51:26] he saw the son of man
[51:28] who kept visiting him
[51:30] until abraham could come to the top of a
[51:32] mount moriah experience in a showdown in
[51:35] his faith testify of a resurrection and
[51:37] a rapture
[51:39] it was christ
[51:41] who walked with him through the entire
[51:43] process
[51:45] brother abraham says and be not afraid
[51:46] remember the last sign that was given to
[51:48] abraham which was the type of those who
[51:50] will go in the rapture
[51:54] think of this visitation of god then to
[51:55] abraham
[51:57] that's a type of those who will go
[52:00] in the rapture
[52:01] it's it lays right in the message this
[52:03] emphasis this theme about the faith of
[52:05] abraham
[52:06] a type of those who will go in the
[52:08] rapture
[52:09] and who is this melchizedek when
[52:11] neighbor says when abraham met him he
[52:13] was melchizedek
[52:15] he unfolds here what all the attributes
[52:19] will do in the final end
[52:21] every son of abraham
[52:23] which we are the attributes
[52:25] right we are his attributes
[52:27] he unfolds
[52:28] in abraham's life
[52:31] and in god making himself known to him
[52:32] in genesis 14 and genesis 18 we have to
[52:35] realize those are two separate events
[52:36] melchizedek refers to genesis 14.
[52:39] my lord lord in genesis 18 refers to him
[52:42] elohim filled in flesh and we realize it
[52:44] would be a a representation just the
[52:47] same as melchizedek he unfolds here what
[52:49] all the attributes will do in the final
[52:50] end every son of abraham he unfolds in
[52:53] these events in abraham's life these are
[52:55] my words now
[52:56] he unfolds in abraham's life
[52:59] what he will do in the end with every
[53:01] son of abraham
[53:03] i know i'm rearranging a little bit so
[53:05] he says it this way every son of the
[53:07] faith will absolutely do the same thing
[53:10] but i want to watch how we have to come
[53:14] there's a way there's a process
[53:16] he said he's unfolding here what all
[53:18] god's attributes every son of abraham
[53:21] will do in the final in the final end
[53:23] every son of faith will absolutely do
[53:25] the same thing now he says every son of
[53:27] faith will absolutely do the same thing
[53:29] he's talking about will have the same
[53:31] experience of god making himself known
[53:34] to them
[53:35] god revealing himself to them
[53:37] and in genesis chapter 18 i want just to
[53:40] kind of cut in maybe we're
[53:42] a flash forward scene or something in in
[53:44] this sermon or in these things or flash
[53:46] back to genesis chapter 18. he comes
[53:48] these three angels come to him and he
[53:50] says my lord he only recognizes the one
[53:52] and and they ask it says they ask oh
[53:55] where's thy wife sarah
[53:57] and so they're all talking about the
[53:58] church the bride they're talking about
[54:00] the wife or whatever but only one had a
[54:01] message for her because then it was the
[54:03] lord who began to spoke and began to
[54:05] speak and spoke of sarah and in genesis
[54:07] chapter 18 verse 14 is anything too hard
[54:09] for the lord
[54:12] is this not what he we need to hear from
[54:14] god today when we've been traveling in
[54:16] this path as long as we have we've
[54:18] experienced our ups and downs we've
[54:19] experienced our disappointments when
[54:21] we're so familiar with our own doubts
[54:23] and backslidings and we see everything
[54:25] seemingly falling apart do we not need a
[54:27] visitation from god himself who can look
[54:30] at us and share with us with such
[54:32] earnesty and intimacy and say is
[54:34] anything too hard
[54:37] and i say just continue to trust me
[54:39] don't worry about these things that are
[54:40] befalling you don't worry about all the
[54:42] chaos around you he's saying is anything
[54:44] too hard in other words nothing's too
[54:46] hard for me abraham nothing's too hard
[54:49] for me sarah the promise i made to you i
[54:51] will keep and if god has spoken anything
[54:54] to you and you believed it don't let go
[54:57] of it for anything
[55:00] because even those things that he spoke
[55:01] to you that you felt would be so
[55:03] tremendous and so powerful and we'd be
[55:06] so beautiful and so clearly come to pass
[55:08] and the further away you got from it the
[55:10] harder it is for you to believe that
[55:11] it'll happen don't stop believing
[55:21] is anything too hard for the lord at the
[55:24] time appointed i will return unto thee
[55:28] according to the time of life and sarah
[55:30] shall have a son
[55:33] is anything too hard for the lord at the
[55:35] appointed time i will return according
[55:37] to the time of life i will come to the
[55:39] the season the time of life this is the
[55:41] time where sarah is going to receive
[55:46] and she's going to conceive
[55:47] and so what was it going to be
[55:49] a resurrection of a dead woman
[55:51] so he says according to the time of life
[55:54] it means according to a time time of
[55:56] life would speak of a season of
[55:57] conception but for her it wasn't just
[55:59] merely a woman who came into a
[56:01] particular cycle where she could get
[56:03] pregnant
[56:05] but a time when the womb is resurrected
[56:08] i'm going to visit you at a time a
[56:10] season for resurrection where deadness
[56:12] is conquered
[56:14] so that my promise can be fulfilled i
[56:16] have to deal with death so that this
[56:18] promise will be full i have to resurrect
[56:20] so this promise can be fulfilled i
[56:21] actually have to take a womb which is
[56:23] old and make it new again in order for
[56:26] this promise to be fulfilled
[56:28] she says i will return unto thee
[56:31] at this time as it says in romans 9 9
[56:33] for this is the word of promise at this
[56:36] time will i come and sarah shall have a
[56:38] son
[56:41] at this time notice these promises given
[56:42] to abraham now what i want to take a
[56:44] step back and do is he says he unfolds
[56:46] hear what all the attributes will do in
[56:48] the final end every son of abraham will
[56:50] do in the final every son of the faith
[56:52] will absolutely do the same thing but
[56:54] i've got to show you how you've got to
[56:56] come there was a way things that god had
[56:58] to do things that god had to manifest
[57:00] that would be the provided way that
[57:02] every attribute of god every son of the
[57:05] faith would have to come through that
[57:07] channel come through god's provided way
[57:09] and he's showing right here in genesis
[57:11] 18 brought back up in romans chapter 9 i
[57:14] will come to you
[57:18] abraham's life sets the order of the
[57:20] rapture
[57:22] at a time determined i will come
[57:24] at a time determined i will manifest
[57:26] myself to you to return to return back
[57:30] to give life over death
[57:33] to take bodies that ought to die
[57:36] and bypass death
[57:38] to take bodies that were dead dead and
[57:40] raise them up again
[57:43] and this is something that you'll find
[57:45] as you study the word of god
[57:47] and this is a great portion that i
[57:48] removed
[57:49] from my notes because i just wanted to
[57:51] go a little bit different direction here
[57:53] and i so i wanted to say it now and i
[57:55] say this on the authority of the message
[57:56] before
[57:58] we meet the lord in the air
[58:00] there must be a rapture
[58:04] before we meet the lord in the air there
[58:06] must be a resurrection
[58:09] there must be a visitation
[58:12] and they're bringing forth a rapturing
[58:13] faith
[58:15] now think about we can't we can't meet
[58:16] the lord in these bodies right so these
[58:18] have got to be changed
[58:20] and then we're not going to be we're not
[58:23] going to meet the lord in the air with
[58:24] these bodies
[58:25] and then we're going to get rapture in
[58:26] faith because we see the lord this
[58:28] 900-foot jesus we're like i knew it
[58:31] right
[58:32] the visitation of the lord the revealing
[58:34] of jesus christ to us gives us rapturing
[58:36] faith for this great climactic change to
[58:38] meet the lord in the air
[58:53] abraham's life
[58:59] testifies of supreme faith for a rapture
[59:01] i'm just going to close here so i'm
[59:03] going to go ahead and just skip
[59:05] to
[59:06] my last
[59:08] my last quote that i have in there
[59:09] brother john the one from abraham and
[59:11] his seat after him
[59:14] abraham's life begins with election
[59:20] where god speaks to him personally calls
[59:23] him out of the multitudes of people
[59:26] and then i know that we like to express
[59:28] it in the sense that
[59:30] abraham walked with god
[59:32] but god walked with him
[59:36] is it i mean in reality abraham was
[59:37] going to be able to keep up right
[59:39] you ever going to walk with your kids
[59:42] you walk at their pace
[59:44] especially if they're on scooters but
[59:46] you you kind of have to you have to
[59:47] adjust your pace you see you want to go
[59:49] on a walk together they suggest that how
[59:50] can two walk together
[59:53] except they be agreed it's like the same
[59:55] we went to different schools together
[59:58] you're not together
[59:59] unless you're in the same place in the
[1:00:01] same cadence how can two walk together
[1:00:04] except they be in the same
[1:00:05] the same pace so god condescends himself
[1:00:08] down and walks with abraham
[1:00:11] but really god's there on the top of
[1:00:13] mount moriah
[1:00:15] but he meets with him in the valley
[1:00:18] of shinar
[1:00:19] and he knows i'm going to take you from
[1:00:21] this valley
[1:00:23] over all these decades
[1:00:25] and through all these miles and through
[1:00:27] all these heartaches and disappointments
[1:00:29] and warfares and battles and struggles
[1:00:31] but one day you're going to meet me on
[1:00:32] the top of mount moriah and there's
[1:00:34] going to be a capstone
[1:00:36] to this relationship you have with me
[1:00:39] and as small as abraham must have felt
[1:00:41] to experience that kind of love
[1:00:44] and how empty his i love you back must
[1:00:46] have been
[1:00:47] this there was a faithfulness in his
[1:00:49] creator
[1:00:50] that never diminished
[1:00:52] and demeaned abraham
[1:00:54] and that's why when it came to the end
[1:00:57] he trusted him without reservation
[1:00:59] and he trusted him with his only son
[1:01:02] think about it
[1:01:04] the son that he loved i'm overwhelmed
[1:01:05] with this right now the son that he
[1:01:07] loved
[1:01:08] and then what god says to abraham then
[1:01:12] i don't know why it's just striking me
[1:01:13] this way so profoundly as i thought
[1:01:15] about this yesterday it had no i thought
[1:01:16] it was just something very personal and
[1:01:18] i wouldn't share this
[1:01:20] but you know how when you tell god you
[1:01:21] love them
[1:01:22] and you're like
[1:01:24] i mean the way he loves me that
[1:01:26] for me to say i love him has just got to
[1:01:28] be like yeah okay
[1:01:30] but then god says to abraham
[1:01:33] i know that you love me
[1:01:36] was not peter so anxious when he says
[1:01:38] peter do you love me and jesus and he
[1:01:40] says
[1:01:41] i love you and says well feed my
[1:01:43] feed my sheep
[1:01:44] peter do you love me because
[1:01:47] i i love you to feed my sheep
[1:01:50] and then what did peter say the third
[1:01:51] time
[1:01:52] you know
[1:01:54] you know i love you
[1:01:55] perhaps he's haunted of his
[1:01:57] unfaithfulness and his denials and
[1:01:59] everything that he did and he's thinking
[1:02:01] how empty are these words in this moment
[1:02:03] where i want to express my love to you
[1:02:05] and they're so shallow after all that
[1:02:06] you've done for me and then for abraham
[1:02:08] to be in a position on the top of mount
[1:02:10] moriah and for god to say i know you
[1:02:12] love me
[1:02:14] and wouldn't it encourage you today
[1:02:16] to know
[1:02:17] that god knows you love him too
[1:02:22] and that he's that he he's called you in
[1:02:24] by election he's made an unconditional
[1:02:26] covenant with you not to say well if you
[1:02:28] prove your love to me and you proved to
[1:02:29] be a good enough son and you proved to
[1:02:31] do this and you proved it that and if
[1:02:32] you could just make good on all your
[1:02:34] promises then one day i'll give you the
[1:02:35] baptism of the holy ghost and one day
[1:02:36] i'm going to do this to you no he says i
[1:02:38] love you i've chosen you by election and
[1:02:40] you have to obey but i am going to never
[1:02:44] leave you nor forsake you and walk with
[1:02:46] you i'm not going to get ahead of you
[1:02:47] i'm going to walk with you and even when
[1:02:49] you turn around and run back a little
[1:02:50] bit i'm going to chase you and i'm going
[1:02:51] to walk back with you i'm going to bring
[1:02:52] you back through all your backslidings
[1:02:54] all your ups and downs all your doubts
[1:02:56] all your failures all your hagars all
[1:02:58] your ishmaels all your fightings all
[1:02:59] your disputings and i'm going to be with
[1:03:01] you until you get to the top of mount
[1:03:03] moriah and it's there you're going to
[1:03:05] know that i know you love me
[1:03:10] and that's the revelation that abraham
[1:03:12] receives maybe not so much that god
[1:03:14] knows
[1:03:17] that he loves them
[1:03:18] but abraham i know
[1:03:20] you love me
[1:03:23] he begins with election with abraham and
[1:03:25] then god walks with them
[1:03:27] and your life is built on the same
[1:03:29] principle
[1:03:33] and i'd like to
[1:03:34] sew this seed in for a future
[1:03:37] reference or to come back to it
[1:03:39] so let's not make it odd or mysterious
[1:03:44] in the chur when brother brown is
[1:03:45] preaching the seals
[1:03:47] and again i just want to lay this in
[1:03:48] there as a seed and seventh seal and
[1:03:50] question and answers on the seals
[1:03:52] he just says
[1:03:53] just live a good christian life
[1:03:57] he wasn't saying that to diminish the
[1:03:59] importance and the value of what had
[1:04:01] just transpired
[1:04:03] but he's doing it to point to how it
[1:04:05] will be manifested
[1:04:07] he's not saying all the seals are open
[1:04:09] the seals are open now look this is
[1:04:11] weird so let's just kind of put this
[1:04:12] away and just keep doing what you're
[1:04:14] doing and stay how you are and just live
[1:04:15] quiet simple lies and forget about this
[1:04:17] he's saying what's been opened up here
[1:04:20] will never become flesh
[1:04:23] until you just live it
[1:04:25] and live a good christian life
[1:04:28] and that's what we see in the life of
[1:04:29] abraham
[1:04:31] musicians if you'd come
[1:04:33] and the message abraham and his seed
[1:04:35] after him he says our bodies will have
[1:04:36] to be changed
[1:04:38] we just can't turn back to young men and
[1:04:40] women we've got to have a different kind
[1:04:42] of body
[1:04:43] so you can be caught in the air to
[1:04:45] receive the promised son
[1:04:50] that's what the church is waiting for
[1:04:52] now the true church
[1:04:54] every manifestation what he did to
[1:04:56] abraham he has done to his seed after
[1:04:59] him
[1:05:00] leaving one thing out
[1:05:03] that's the rapture of the church
[1:05:07] so abraham
[1:05:09] everything every manifestation that he
[1:05:10] did to abraham
[1:05:12] he's done to his seed after him
[1:05:15] so let's take a step back
[1:05:17] everything he did to abraham
[1:05:19] is the table of contents
[1:05:22] everything he did to abraham is the
[1:05:24] outline
[1:05:26] so you know we've all been there to
[1:05:28] certain weddings where it's kind of like
[1:05:29] where are we at on the program
[1:05:32] how many more of these do we have right
[1:05:33] because we kind of want to know where
[1:05:34] we're at what's next oh another song
[1:05:37] another song who's that what's their
[1:05:38] name where are they on here
[1:05:39] right because you want to know where
[1:05:40] you're at well abraham's life is the
[1:05:42] same way
[1:05:44] that his it was acted out in abraham's
[1:05:47] life and everything that he did to
[1:05:48] abraham he did to the seed of abraham
[1:05:52] but there's only one thing
[1:05:55] somehow someway in abraham's life there
[1:05:58] was the testimony there was the
[1:06:00] experience of
[1:06:02] and a foreshadowing of the rapture
[1:06:06] and he says every manifestation he's
[1:06:09] done to his seed after him leaving one
[1:06:12] thing out that's the rapture of the
[1:06:14] church that's why supreme faith
[1:06:16] rapturing faith perfect faith is
[1:06:18] revealed in abraham and that's where we
[1:06:20] stand today
[1:06:23] and again i want to put it in
[1:06:25] i want to put it in a graphic that gets
[1:06:28] our attention supreme faith
[1:06:31] and i want us to think rapturing faith
[1:06:32] and i want us to think capstone and i
[1:06:34] want us to think seven thunders uttering
[1:06:36] divorces and revealing the mystery of
[1:06:38] those seven seals and i want you to
[1:06:39] think of the third pull and i want you
[1:06:41] to think of all these things as i say
[1:06:43] with the lisp i want you to hear it and
[1:06:45] i want you to think about it these great
[1:06:47] things elohim fell in flesh who is this
[1:06:49] melchizedek all these great things yes
[1:06:51] yes that's what we're coming to how are
[1:06:53] you going to get there just trust him
[1:06:56] what do those things mean what are they
[1:06:58] all about just trust him
[1:07:00] just follow in the pattern of his word
[1:07:02] just do what he's asking you to do just
[1:07:04] trust him day by day by day
[1:07:09] as we stand to our feet this morning
[1:07:12] my prayer for you today is that you
[1:07:14] could then believe
[1:07:17] that if every manifestation that god had
[1:07:19] to abraham
[1:07:21] he gives to his seed after him
[1:07:38] [Music]
[1:07:40] you give us this experience
[1:07:42] that abraham
[1:07:45] my daughter my son
[1:07:47] i know
[1:07:48] that thou fearest me
[1:07:51] i know that you reverence me i know that
[1:07:53] you love
[1:07:54] me and i think that would do us good
[1:07:57] don't you think
[1:07:58] with our heads bad let's pray together
[1:08:00] gracious heavenly father
[1:08:02] and the sweetness of this time that
[1:08:04] we've had together
[1:08:06] we've emphasized a singular thought
[1:08:09] i realize it's repetition to most of the
[1:08:11] people that are here
[1:08:12] [Music]
[1:08:14] that the actions of abraham in genesis
[1:08:15] chapter 22 testified of the faith of the
[1:08:18] bride in the last days
[1:08:20] who triumphs over
[1:08:22] death and we see that you by your breath
[1:08:25] and inspiration and writing the
[1:08:27] scriptures emphasized these things about
[1:08:28] abraham's faith
[1:08:30] and hid these details in his life i say
[1:08:32] hid lord
[1:08:34] perhaps it's just easy to pass over not
[1:08:36] be reminded of
[1:08:40] lord they're there
[1:08:42] that we might
[1:08:45] be encouraged
[1:08:47] [Music]
[1:08:48] that it would give us
[1:08:49] strength to believe all things are
[1:08:51] possible
[1:08:54] [Music]
[1:08:56] even as christ said in
[1:08:58] the days of his flesh
[1:09:00] with man this is impossible
[1:09:04] but with god all things are possible
[1:09:07] it's what you said to abraham in genesis
[1:09:09] 18 is anything too hard for the lord
[1:09:13] [Music]
[1:09:14] with abram
[1:09:17] it was impossible with sarai it was
[1:09:19] impossible
[1:09:21] but with the h which represents god
[1:09:24] with you
[1:09:26] the impossible became
[1:09:27] not only possible
[1:09:30] probable
[1:09:31] imminent
[1:09:32] guaranteed
[1:09:35] and i pray today lord for the faces that
[1:09:37] i look out upon and
[1:09:39] the many that stream lord that
[1:09:42] if there's a crisis of faith we feel
[1:09:44] pulled and we feel torn and
[1:09:47] there's so many things
[1:09:48] drawing on us from different angles
[1:09:51] our rest comes in from finding your
[1:09:54] heart
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:09:57] and i think so many things lord cloud
[1:09:59] the picture and get caught up in our
[1:10:01] view
[1:10:03] today lord may just all be pushed aside
[1:10:06] and may we feel the reassurance of your
[1:10:08] presence confirming your your care and
[1:10:11] concern with us
[1:10:14] and affirm to us today lord if you did
[1:10:16] it for abraham where you said to him
[1:10:19] on that mount moriah you said abraham i
[1:10:21] know that you fear me then lord could
[1:10:23] you today
[1:10:25] though we may not have lifted our hands
[1:10:27] back to slay our son and though we may
[1:10:30] not have already experienced this change
[1:10:32] of our bodies but having been caught up
[1:10:34] in this rapture season having been
[1:10:36] experiencing a resurrection out of dead
[1:10:39] denominationalism lord could you speak
[1:10:41] to our hearts today through these eyes
[1:10:43] of grace and passion and say i know that
[1:10:46] you love me
[1:10:49] reassure us today lord
[1:10:52] we know your love is perfect it's our
[1:10:54] love that we doubt
[1:10:56] we know your word is sure lord it's our
[1:10:59] faith that we feel
[1:11:00] this apprehension about
[1:11:03] may you affirm it today lord
[1:11:06] give us a grace father to persevere and
[1:11:08] to step forward in the the plan and the
[1:11:10] path that you have for us
