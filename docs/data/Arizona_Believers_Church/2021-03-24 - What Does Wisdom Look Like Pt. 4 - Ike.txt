TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] while you're standing i'd like to read from genesis chapter 22 and that's verses 1 to 14 genesis 2 22 verses 1 to 14. welcome everyone to the house of lord this evening it's nice to see each one of you with us genesis chapter 2 verses 1 to 14. i'm just going to begin reading so that we can stay very focused on the subject today the lord has really dealt with my heart in a very strong way so i just feel very very moved grateful for the presence of the lord that's with us that gives us this liberty to jump right into these things and it came to pass so this is genesis chapter 22. we'll start with verse 1 and read the verse 14. and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am and he said take now thy son thy only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and claimed the wood for the burnt offering and rose up went unto the place of which god had told him then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and abraham said to his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for burnt offering abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for burnt offering so they went both of them together they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham he said here am i and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and abraham called the name of that place jehovah jireh as it is said to this day the mount of the lord it shall be seen it may be seated we're continuing on the subject of what does wisdom look like and tonight i'd like to take for a subject with respect to what wisdom looks like and use the term confident that wisdom looks confident and we've looked at the meekness of christ through a few services and how that christ the word is the ultimate and the treasure of all wisdom the treasure of all knowledge and how the meekness of christ is an expression of the word and how that wisdom itself is inseparable from meekness that the real wisdom from above demonstrates itself with meekness regardless of how what it portrays and what it stands for it has a meekness to it and we even looked at how christ who is the manifestation of the heart of god and the treasure of all wisdom and knowledge he overcame and he accomplished the will of gone through the word and humility and so what does wisdom look like i want to take this word confident and really begin to examine this very closely uh to give us another another way to measure ourselves whether or not we're abiding in the wisdom of god now i'd like to define confident here in the outset confident means fully assured so this speaks to us that wisdom looks like it's confident it is confident and so this would be the impact or the effect that wisdom has upon us we are fully assured if you're confident you have strong belief if one is confident they're firmly trusting and these are the words that are associated with and which should be conjured up in our hearts as we begin to ponder being confident and having confidence you means you're firmly trusting and that you're relying on something and that you're bold and even daring and these are some of the things that are part of the rich meaning of the word confident and the the root of it it's a combination of a prefix of calm which is confident and that fadir is the uh is the word that's conjugated to fident fadir means to trust to confide or to persuade i was really just struck by this word when we think confident it's with something with this trust with this to confider to be persuaded of and it comes from a root that means to force to advise or to encourage and this so this greek root this indo-european root that it forms uh that it's from it actually is the word that's used for abide or abode so if you're confiding if you have confidence if you're persuaded if you have a strong belief if you're fully assured then it's a it means you have a source of trust it's a you have faith and you have reliance and if you think of an abode or a place that one would abide it's creating this picture that when one is confident they appear strong that when one is confident it's mighty and it's powerful and it would be important i think at this point to even say that as we've mentioned already meekness is not weakness and that we think well oh they just seem so meek a lot of times we we're really referring to someone who seems timid uh uh uh or a little bit placid well they're not really i don't want to offend and they can be just very careful how they act and so meekness isn't the result of being weak meekness you can really only be meek if you have strength uh you know if i was gonna if i bumped into somebody and uh and and they look like they can fight and they're bigger than me and i accidentally bump in and they turn around like hey you got a problem i could act very meek like hey i'm sorry you know i don't want any trouble i didn't mean to bump into you and that's not actually meekness that's just you know reality that i probably couldn't hold my own in a fight and so i just need to move along but one who knows that they could war one that could pick up a weapon one they could respond they could have something to say meekness is demonstrated in what the government of passions and not being quick to respond and not being quick to fight and not being quick to assert yourself and so this confidence it's part of the uh maybe just another way of expressing this aspect of wisdom and the aspect of meekness but it it comes from this word which means to abide or this source of it's the source of trust faith or reliance it's strong it's mighty it's powerful and if you're abiding it means to be sustained or to stay firm under so the word if you're confident if wisdom is confident then this is what wisdom looks like it's resting wisdom is abiding we've mentioned this before how that rest was coming up as a theme as we looked at this wisdom from above this to be confident means you're at rest you're assured you're reliant you're firm and in john chapter 15 verse 4 jesus says abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me and so if we as the branches abide in the vine then we will bring forth fruit and this word abide it means to live or to rest in to continue to depend upon and so this is this is what confidence is if you have confidence then it's a strong belief you're fully persuaded you're fully assured you're reliant upon something and your reliance upon that gives you a boldness your reliance upon that gives you strength it gives you confidence so this is kind of the picture i'm wanting to paint that when you're when you're resting in wisdom when you're secured in wisdom it produces a confidence it's a source of strength so he says abide in me and if you abide in him if you're resting in him if you're trusting to him if you're depending upon him as a branch is upon the vine then you'll bring forth fruit brother braham says and the branch bears record of the vine because it draws its energy and life from the vine so the branch doesn't brag about itself it doesn't brag about its abilities it doesn't brag about oh look at how fruitful i am the branch knows except to be a part of the vine it's not receiving any energy to bring forth fruit so it recognizes its dependence and its reliance upon the source of energy so the vine furnishes energy to the branches it's resting and depending upon the vine it's resting and depending upon the life this is what we how we can be and how we can live when we're tapped into true wisdom we can be confident now if you look at these verses in james chapter 3 i'd like to and i've provided just a one slide that has all of the uh verses together because i just kind of want to move around in some of these words and i hope that the use of these different colors doesn't throw you off but i just kind of i wanted to kind of group them together because in james chapter 3 verses 13 to 18 it's it's showing us the nature of wisdom and as a result the fruits of wisdom in verses 13 and 17 and this nature and fruit of wisdom is contrasted by earthly wisdom or sensual devilish wisdom that's referenced in verses 14 to 16. and so the nature of sensual wisdom is bitter envying and strife that's kind of the nature of it that's that's how it's character that's the force behind it that's what motivates it and then the fruits of it in verse 16 are confusion and every evil work so this if you're if there's an evil work somewhere in there we can find bitter even bitter envying in strife and know that wisdom from above did not produce chaos wisdom from god did not produce this confusion and every evil work so the nature bitter envy and strife in verse 14 produces the fruit in verse 16 of confusion in every evil work this is the nature and fruit of earthly wisdom and i i want you to kind of identify this characteristic if someone is jealous they're certainly not confident in themselves if somebody's envy and they're striving and they're in strife and there's this conflict then they're obviously not resting and confident in who they are and what god made them and so there's where there's fighting where's the envy and where there's a lack of settledness and lack of rest then this is the lack of wisdom there's not that confidence there so he characterizes earthly earthly wisdom and sensual wisdom and devilish wisdom as being combative and they're being conflict and they're being jealousy and a lack of settledness in a person's heart but the meekness of wisdom as he says in verse 13 he calls it the meekness of wisdom it produces the fruits of verse 17. so as you're looking at this we see the fruits of verse 17 these are the characteristics of wisdom which is from above and the bible characterizes it that the wisdom which is from above is pure it inspires reverence it is peaceable so it inspires reverence and promotes peace it is gentle it provokes patience now this is the impact it has on you when you've received wisdom from above then it's pure it's peaceable it's it's gentle but then also wisdom as it's imparted as it has its impact upon you then wisdom as we impart that it ought to provoke patience it ought to inspire promote peace so this is the way that wisdom works it's easily entreated it's willing to listen you it can actually handle disagreement well okay you see it a little bit differently let's work through this that's they help me help me to understand where you're coming from and and and often we we can get in a situation where one person sees it one way and we see it another and what we want to strive to do is get the other person to see what where we're coming from and and see it our way and understand what our basis is and and why we feel the way that we do and real wisdom if it really can kick in if you spent your time just trying to understand where the other person was coming from say well you you're different than me why where are you coming from why do you feel that way what is it you see what is it you feel what are you basing this on then you find the conflict sometimes resolves itself just in knowing where the person's coming from oh i see where you're coming from now i know why you feel that way i know why you made that decision i would have done it differently but had i been in your shoes i understand perfectly why you did it and it's it's this uh easily entreated not just taking a disagreement or doing it differently as a reason to put up your dukes and have it out and then it's merciful so it's not only willing to listen but it's willing to relieve somebody else of their burden when you're merciful you don't just say bless is hard or they're pitiful when you're merciful you're willing to relieve somebody of their burden you're willing to relieve them of what they're carrying and the difficulty that they're going through i know we have a saying that as long as you say bless their heart you can say whatever you want about somebody and that's the wrong kind of mercy mercy we're talking about having the kind of mercy where oh isn't that pitiful isn't that awful i want to help them that's the merciful and then it's impartial so it's without partiality it's impartial it's it's without hypocrisy it's not self-serving and and the bible says that it these fruits are it's fruitful it brings forth and it's abundant in good fruit so the wisdom which is from above exhibits itself with all these different characteristics and if you take them together and if somebody was to have this these guiding attributes within their heart and in their thought process and in their motive and objective that they're pure and peaceable and gentle and easily entreated and merciful and impartial and without hypocrisy and without jealousy and envying and they're full of good fruits then this is the kind of wisdom that exhibits itself in character and grace it's the kind of wisdom that knows where she stands and that's what that's what was really striking me as i read these attributes and these characteristics of wisdom this is if someone is this way they say they obviously know where they stand if someone can exhibit these type of characteristics they're not kind of worried they're not wishy-washy they're not having to resort to certain kind of cheap tactics to have their way they know exactly where they're standing and so this wisdom that is from above it knows as you continue to look at this verse here and verse 18 it knows that it has the seed of righteousness it knows that it has the seed it is wisdom is the seed of justice it is the seed of judgment it is the seed of discernment so wisdom knows that it has the has power within itself to produce the fruits of righteousness it has power in itself to bring bring to pass a desired result so verse 18 is is identifying how this there's such confidence in this seed there's such confidence in the power of wisdom that it knows right the right fruit is planted as you read that verse this as it uses this great language and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace that the right fruit is planted by those who act purposely who act confidently the right kind of seed is planted by those when it's planted by those who are exhibiting patience and exhibiting grace they know that it's going to return to them fruitful they're not worried about it they're not having to dig it up they haven't done any dirt to cause it to happen they haven't pulled any punches they're not lying and this isn't a con they know exactly where they're standing and so those that plant the right kind of fruit know that through their diligence and being purposeful it's going to bring the right thing the bible identifies it as peace it's going to bring forth peaceable fruit so what wisdom from above looks like these are the virtues here in verse 17. these are the virtues that wisdom looks like and these are the virtues that we desire the spirit of god to promote that's what we ought to desire we all say well we read about the fruits of the spirit you should be desiring that the holy spirit which is in you would produce the fruits of the spirit in your life i i want to read in two different places and since i want to i will unless the lord stops me but two different places that we have mentioned already in isaiah in proverbs and i would like to read in isaiah chapter 32 verses 15 to 18. and i'm really just reinforcing how what we need is wisdom this is what we should ask god for this is what we should be desiring is wisdom and we don't need programs and we don't need certain protocols and we don't just need to be told what to do we really as believers we want to understand the wisdom of god behind certain precepts and principles that we believe and even things that we teach and we can say well i want to apply the token to my home and i want to create an atmosphere and i don't want i don't want certain things to be inside my home well i think it would be good to understand the wisdom behind that understand the wisdom behind it you know what the objective is and the goal is then you have something more than just a don't or do that you're working by you have a wisdom so that whenever you get into a scenario you go well this doesn't fit within the black and white of the do's and don'ts but you have some sort of some kind of driving discernment and wisdom in your heart to say now i've never been in this situation before but can ask god to give you wisdom to navigate it and so there's uh these are things that i hope that you can make very very practical because we're talking about uh um things that are very uh uh very pertinent to the lives that we live and i will say this that my repetition is intentional so if you want to remind me that i've used these scriptures before absolutely by all means you can tell me because i'm easily entreated and uh and and i don't mind that but the repetition is intentional and isaiah chapter 32 verses 15 to 18 now notice how there's this great symmetry even to the point to where it appears as if james is drawing from these very verses in isaiah chapter 32 verses 15 to 18 until the spirit be poured upon us from on high which he refers to the wisdom from above from on high and the wilderness be a fruitful filled and the fruitful field be counted for a force so as this wisdom which is from above he says has this fruit of righteousness which was sown in peace he's saying when the spirit comes from on high the wilderness is going to become a fruitful field and the fruitful field is going to be counted for a forest not just a few twigs here and there and a few shrubs or bushes but it's going to be so abundant it's going to be as a forest then judgment when the spirit has come from on high then judgment which is discernment and wisdom shall dwell in the wilderness now this is where the fruits are so he's connecting the fruitful filled and the fruitful field be in a forest he's connecting it with judgment that dwells in the wilderness in righteousness which is justice and this understanding shall remain remain in the fruit fulfilled so it tells us that there's going to be a spirit that comes from on high and a wilderness is going to be fruitful and the field is going to be counted for for us because of all the fruit and then we see this characteristics of judgment and righteousness is going to be what's bringing forth fruit the very same thing that we see in james chapter 3 the meekness of wisdom brings forth these fruits in verse 17. so verse 17 here in isaiah 32 and the work of righteousness shall be peace the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace the fruit or the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever quietness and assurance that's confident trust forever so is this wisdom which is from above it gives a confidence it gives a rest that's my emphasis today that wisdom from above ought to put you in the condition of rest wisdom from above ought to put you in resting give you confidence trusting too sure of what it is you believe in and so this wisdom being poured out from above it makes a wilderness fruitful and a field to be fruitful judgment and righteousness are reigning in the field the work of righteousness is producing peace the effect of righteousness is quietness and confident assurance and trust forever and this is what it produces and my people shall dwell my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation this is a home this is where you live this is where life is occurring and transpiring every day it doesn't describe church it describes life and i'm so glad that church can impact life and that church isn't just an escape from life for a lot of people that's what church has become churches become an escape from life and they just go back to back to these dreadful living conditions and dreadful relationships and dreadful home life and dreadful dynamics and job and all these things but i believe that church is where the word is lifted up and the word being received into hearts we can go back home and change our home life so that churches isn't an escape from life but that it's a benefit and a boost to life because we don't we don't uh live to go to church we go to church to live and so it says then you my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and ensure dwellings which is a a tabernacle residing and in quiet resting places this is what is the effect of righteousness this is what the the work of righteousness the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace these are the kind of fruits and they just get very bold just to proclaim and say lord if you're giving me wisdom and i'm operating wisdom in my personal life if i'm using wisdom in my personal relationships if i'm yielding to wisdom from above and how that i order my home and raise my children and work through things with my wife then these are the fruits that i can claim these are the things that i can believe that god is going to do he is going to bring these things to pass where we have a dwell in a peaceable habitation ensure dwellings and in quiet resting places peaceable habitation that shalom a complete and sound content home assure rest assure dwelling that is a confident trusting and secure place these are the feelings these are the attributes these are the characteristics that you're going to have thank goodness it's not describing the square footage do you realize just what a quandary we'd all be in if it says and then you shall dwell on a 3 000 square foot house you'd be like well mine's 2 700 square feet what do we do or if you lived in a 4 200 square foot house do we have too much but it's not describing a basement suite it's not describing town home it's not describing apartment or duplex or any or a house or tent it's just saying this is the characteristic of it we're not talking about houses we're talking about homes it's something that has to do with the characteristic and the character of something you're going to have a confident trusting and secure place to live it's going to be it says a sure dwelling this is a state of confidence this is a state of being safe and secure it speaks of security i says quiet resting places this is a means you're secure this means you're at ease and it's a place of rest this is the fruit of wisdom this is when the spirit is poured out from on high and it begins to produce fruits if you want to look into your life and say is our is my life being fruitful do i see the effects of righteousness do i see the fruit of yielding to the word of the hour do i see the fruit of applying the token applying the token should not just produce conflict and strife and disagreements and arguments over gaming consoles and how much screen time we have and whether or not we're on the same page as a spouse but rather wisdom from above as it's being yielded to it as it's being properly applied will produce peaceable habitation sheer dwellings and quiet resting places this is the fruit of wisdom there's different things that we're going to be we're reading about here these are the products of wisdom proverbs chapter 24 verses 3 to 6. i know that we've read this a number of times already but it's it's just reinforcing how what we can ask god for is wisdom and it can be very very practical whatever stage of life you're in whatever circumstance you find yourself in you can ask god for wisdom and he'll give you something very very practical the wisdom is a house build it and by understanding it is established you'll find that wisdom builds it causes it's going to since it builds by wisdom is a house and through wisdom is a house builder that means it builds it it causes it to continue it builds it up and matures it it's part of establishing the foundation and so once wisdom has built the house then by understanding it is established and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches we build it we cause it to continue and to mature through wisdom we establish it through understanding and we fill it through knowledge and then so this is the establishment is the preparation of it the arrangement it being settled and made firm it's it's secured it's ordered to fill it up it means it's satisfied and it's complete wisdom builds understanding establishes knowledge fills this is very practical uh this is a very practical scripture even though we're maybe not being specific and how wisdom builds and how knowledge under uh establishes and how uh knowledge will um fill it up with all these precious things you can take that say lord this seems to be a very general promise to me but i know that you can make application you can give me the right kind of guidance and through your word to make very practical application of this verse five now since we've read verses three and four quite a bit it says a wise man is strong it's about the building of a house your house is builded through wisdom it says so a wise man is strong a man of knowledge increaseth strength these are the things that establish and build and promote and fill up a house for a wise man is strong a man of knowledge increased his strength for by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war those you wouldn't go to war without counsel you wouldn't just do it through emotion you wouldn't just do it simply because you disagree you wouldn't just do it because well that land looks really good if we could just drive the inhabitants out of it you would you would only engage in conflict you would only engage in some sort of uh com combat or a war is it saying it's by wise counsel you make that war it's reply it's referring to something that would be the most significant and substantial thing that people could engage in war says when you make big decisions and when and there's serious things and substantial things in your life you use wisdom only by wise counsel would you make war only by wise counsel would you make these decisions and in the multitude of counselors there is safety whenever someone tells me uh well when do unto you lawyers i say well it also says in the multitude of counselors there there's safety i it was brother dan daisy that came told me one time he said brother aaron i've got a scripture for you woe into your lawyers i said i've got a scripture for myself what was me and he never used it again on me for by wise counsel you make war and in the multitude of counselors there is safety so just be very very practical in your life and even begin to think how that in the very specific situations that you find yourself in how you can make practical application that in these different scenarios i'm wanting to build and promote and cause my house to continue through wisdom is the house built it by understanding is it established and through knowledge it's going to be filled with the right things the beneficial things the things that promote peace because the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace the bible says in proverbs chapter 9 verse 1 wisdom hath builded her house she hath hewn out her seven pillars so when wisdom builds her house she hews out seven pillars and the use of the phrase seven pillars means it's complete it's strong it's durable wisdom builds her house and when she builds a house it's it has power it has stability so when it says that through wisdom is a house built and wisdom have built at her house she's hewn outer seven pillars it speaks of stability power durability of wisdom and when something's durable you can have confidence in it something has power or something is secure then it's something that you can rest in you can rest confidently and why because it's secure it's safe it's sure it says wisdom hath built or builded her house this is how we want to build our lives this is how we want to grow we want to grow in wisdom now if you could turn with me to proverbs chapter 31 verses 25 and 26 i'll i'll i want to read them and then come right back to him it says strength and honor or her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she opened her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness now i want to take this description of this woman as being descriptive one who is acting according to wisdom so as it applies to a woman i believe we could take these same characteristics and these same virtues and say that really in the way that these are manifested themselves in the virtuous woman this is really wisdom that's operated in her life and then in the same way man or woman male or female we can begin to conduct ourselves in some sort of similar way and have similar characteristics and attributes if we're acting according to wisdom and verses 25 and 26 i want to use this as descriptive of any one of us who's being endued with wisdom and power from on high as the bible says in verse 1 in proverbs chapter 31 verse 10 rather who can find a virtuous woman so it's describing a virtuous woman and it says for her price is far above rubies so this virtuous woman who has strength her strength and honor or her clothing and she rejoices in a time to come she opens her mouth with wisdom and her tongue is the law of kindness she is a virtuous woman whose price is far above rubies now what is it that characterizes her what makes her so profound that her price would be far above rubies it's not her beauty and it's not that she's just really shrewd in business it all comes back to one attribute and characteristic that the ver that the book of proverbs is constantly lifting up wisdom the virtuous woman is not uh it's she's not lifted up in a spouse just because she's virtuous but it's the wisdom that she has it's the grace that she has in her wisdom in job chapter 28 verses 12 to 21 it says but where shall wisdom be found and where is the place of understanding and i'll go through this quickly saying man doesn't know the price thereof it's not found in the land of living depth says it's not with me it cannot be gotten for gold silver cannot be weighed for the price thereof it cannot be valued with the gold of ofer the precious onyx or sapphire gold and crystal cannot equal it and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold where is wisdom where's the place of understanding there's no material wealth or possessions that can really ever be accumulated to speak to its worth and in verse 18 no mention shall be made of coral or of pearls they can't compare for the price of wisdom is above rubies so when it's asking and again in verse 20 when winston cometh wisdom and where is the place of understanding it says the price of wisdom is above rubies so when the bible says you know who who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies really what makes this woman so valuable is her wisdom this is what makes her an attribute to her husband this is what makes her an attribute to her children it is not that she is virtuous and that keeping herself from things that would spoil her but it's the wisdom that keeps her it's her discretion that keeps her it's her judgment and discernment that makes her this incredibly powerful woman that we read about in proverbs 31 because the price of wisdom is above rubies and if her price is above rubies then i could even say this wisdom is the thing that's being espoused in proverbs 31. though i believe it does speak to the woman but it's speaking to wisdom that we can all ask for so verse 25 proverbs 31 verse 25 strength and honor are her clothing this is this is what wisdom looks like strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in the time to come now so that we can see that this is wisdom that's being expressed in verse 25 it says she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness she governs herself so she opened her mouth with wisdom she governs herself by the rules of wisdom her price is far above ruby so she's characterized as wisdom and she governs herself by wisdom she not only acts wisely but her tongue is the law of kindness she gives wise counsel and remember her speech here she opens her mouth and wisdom and her tongue is the law of kindness she governs herself by wisdom and she gives wise counsel so strength and honor are her clothing she's clothed in strength she's pro she's firm she prevails and she's clothed in strength and honor this is describing then to us that wisdom is strong wisdom is powerful wisdom is confident wisdom is fearless strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come this phrase is so beautiful to rejoice in time to come it means she looks forward to the future without anxiety now come on everybody just go ahead and wake up here at 7 58 because this is just will get really good for all of us think about it not worrying about the future when we have wisdom we're not worried about what the future holds we can actually look forward to whatever is going to happen economically politically socially physically you name it lee whatever it might be we're just hey i'm not worried about the future well what if this happens i'm not worried about it it says that she can rejoice this phrase is so deep she can rejoice in the future she can look forward to the future without anxiety she can look forward to the future with confident joy that's what it means that this wisdom is strength and honor wisdom of this this virtue of wisdom is that it can it can cause you to look forward to whatever tomorrow holds with confident joy she shall rejoice in time to come it means wisdom gives a constant tranquility of mind it's confident this to rejoice in time to come means there's a cheerful expectation oh it's looking really bad tomorrow i know isn't that great well what do you mean well my god is a god that's really good when things are bad you're rejoicing in the time to come no matter what kind of foreboding whatever seems to be on the horizon you think man it's getting dark oh my goodness this is going to be rough it's just another opportunity for him to come walking on the water just another opportunity to find out just how deep that anchor is rooted in this solid rock so you can just be confident that's what wisdom from above is trying to teach all of us to trust to to rest and to be be sure of him regardless of how dire the circumstances may be or how terrible a situation is strength and honor her clothing she dresses herself in strength and on her no matter how bad it looks and no matter how bad it may seem and how bad everyone's talking she will rejoice and look forward to the future with confident joy why because wisdom has a just confidence in god's gracious providence wisdom has a rightful correct and just confidence in god's promises to us so no matter what's coming we can rest in his promises no matter how bad it looks we can rest in his promise whatever promise you want to think about whatever you want to say however you want to spin it however you want to uh whatever context you want to put it in this is what wisdom from a above produces which comes on the wings of a dove it gives you this kind of confidence to believe i know that even if this happens i don't want it to happen but even if it does happen wisdom tells me to trust him well what if you made a mistake wisdom tells you that you can make it right he'll see you through nothing will destroy you so wisdom is right wisdom is correct just to trust in god in his promises one translation or commentary writes it this way she laughs at the future so far from regarding it with apprehension that she can look forward to it with joyful confidence he said well if the future holds this the future holds that wisdom tells you that you can that you've got this by his grace this is what wisdom builds and when you start building in wisdom now that you have this wisdom and now that you're walking with wisdom whatever the future holds you say i know this is correct i know this is right i know this is a solid foundation wisdom has built this house it's not just on the sands of some man's ideas it's not just on the sands of politics and pretense i'm built upon a solid rock it can withstand the things that are coming and it says that it can have a confident joy or joyful confidence no apprehension or fear about the future what can do that only wisdom from above so it is it is speaking to how that if we have prepared in wisdom and that we have gained our provision with wisdom then it's that it's going to be secure it's going to meet the need and as you read in proverbs chapter 31 and these characteristics of this virtuous woman you'll find that she has behaved in such a wise manner that no matter what the future holds she knows that her wisdom will uphold her that she's already been making the prudent decisions she as even you could go through it you almost feel tempted just to start going back through all these different scriptures and proverbs she's learned from the ant to store up during the right kind of season she knows that when the dark and hard times come that she's already in the fat times and the good times and the things when things are being blessed that she's made the proper provision for the lean times this is what wisdom will afford you the ability to prepare and the provision in a time of when there's not plenty so this is why this is how wisdom builds and how it continues so we want to start building with wisdom so that when there's a calamity there's something coming we can just to use the language of the scripture rejoice in time to come we can laugh at the future as it were we can rejoice knowing that our god has this that we're made for this he'll see us through strength and honor are her clothing she has by wisdom prepared and has sufficient provision to meet the needs in proverbs chapter 14 verse 1 it says every wise woman buildeth her house proverbs 9 told us that wisdom builds her house now it says every wise woman buildeth their house but then it break makes this great contrast but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands the foolish woman will blame everyone else but we know scripturally the foolish woman has tore down her own house with her own doing the foolish is one who despises wisdom it speaks of one who's quarrelsome there's envy there's strife there's always a a rationalize and there's always a fighting always a disputing and it plucketh it it destroys or ruins her own house with her own hands she can't sit back and say oh this is the providence of god and he's trying to teach me something and and this is what no it's their own foolishness that brings this the characteristic of a full scripture is one who despises wisdom or despises instruction or hates knowledge these are all phrases that are used of the fool in the book of proverbs they despise wisdom they despise instruction they hate knowledge the shame is the promotion of fools the foolish mouth is near destruction fools die for want of wisdom the companion of fools is destroyed don't hang out with a fool my companion of a fool is destroyed the fools die for one of wisdom shame is the promotion of a fool you want a promotion if you're full your promotion will be shame i was just promoted to more shame today ah you must be a fool because this is scripturally they despise wisdom they despise instruction they hate knowledge the foolish mouth is always near destruction so on one hand you have wisdom which sustains it protects it builds it provides the sure safe dwelling but foolishness is what tends to destruction but the the bible says in proverbs that to a full his way seems right and so this is where we have to be very careful that we don't confuse our own arrogance for confidence and this is just a simple challenge that sometimes people could they they sense there's some pride there or arrogance and we just quickly defend ourselves saying well i'm just very confident and that intimidates them and i think it would be important for us to ponder some time maybe i am being presumptuous maybe i am being arrogant may i maybe i am coming along a little strong maybe i am being foolish and what i think is confidence what i think is security and confidence in my in what god has done for me and sureness and what he's what he's allowed for me to do maybe i am lacking the meekness of wisdom and foolishness is being presented and what i'm calling confidence is actually a fool's arrogance or pride it says in proverbs 14 16 a wise man feareth and departed from evil he respects he reverences when he sees evil by wisdom he departs from it but the full rageth and is confident he rages why because his he is it is in his folly he rages in his carnality he's raised he's very adamant he's very convinced he's very boastful he's very arrogant this is the full rages in a time of uh when he's ought to be departing when he ought to be running and says and is confident it's the wrong kind of confidence confidence in an unfaithful man is like a a broken tooth or a foot out of joint it's not going to work it's not going to produce the results it's the wrong kind of confidence why it's not according to wisdom according to something that's sensual and devilish and earthly something that's loud and proud so the full can rage the full combos and the full can pretend to be confident but that's not what we're talking about proverbs chapter 1 verse 32 for the turn in the way of the simple shall slay them this is the wrong kind of simple the turning away that means they refuse wisdom they just decline the call of wisdom this chapter wisdom is crying wisdom is calling out they turn away and therefore it slays them and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them the prosperity i think it's actually translated to quietness in other places in proverbs but it's the ease it's the failure to act it's the failure to plan it's the failure to prepare according to wisdom the fool is very confident but has no actions to back it up the fool is very confident very boastful but they don't have the wisdom of planning they don't have the wisdom of preparation they don't have the wisdom of foresight they don't have the wisdom of being proactive a fool can be very confident in his reflexes right always reacting always knee jerk ah i got the i got this i got that always has a has an opinion on something but the wise is proactive the why is this considering the why is this thinking through but it said the full he his prosperity is what destroys him it's his failure to act he's at ease it's the wrong kind of quietness i know there may seem to be a little bit of a paradox there and these different disposition dispositions or states but i'm trying to lift up this characteristic of wisdom which is confident the right kind of confidence so i had to make this practical when we know that we have god's word when we know that we have his wisdom then our conduct should reflect it i know i've been repeating myself over and over again maybe saying the same thing through several services now when we know we have the word then we should act according to it and in acting according to it this conduct is reflective of real wisdom we have the word of god if we have wisdom from above we can act confidently we can be trusting we can be at rest why because his word is sure the bible speaks when it says that jesus is speaking he says you know doth not the wisdom of god say that the prophets will be rejected what is the word it is the wisdom of god it says that the word will be rejected so we can we can act confidently we can be at rest we can be trusting in god's wisdom why because his word is sure you could take it to the bank you can rely on it you can trust in it his word is sure and his wisdom works you want to know what is timeless the wisdom of god if there has been a principle outlined in the scripture if there's a principle that's laid out and very plain in the word of god you ought to recognize that there's a wisdom to it and we what we want to tap into and be connected with is the wisdom of that word and not engage in revisionist history and try to explain away everything that's in the message i i have felt at times that man unless you know everywhere brother branham was preaching and who the pastor was and what year it was and who the audience was and unless you knew who paul was writing and where he was in his journey you can never really understand the scripture because we just try to explain everything away based upon the context he was here and he was there i know he said that in that message but that was this and this was that what we want to be tied into and connect with what's the wisdom behind it what's the prevailing wisdom behind it so that i can be benefited by these things that are being taught because that wisdom works and because it works we can rest in it the preparation and the provision of wisdom gives us confidence not the fool that rageth and is quiet and is at ease but rather the wise man who feareth and in fearing as we've mentioned it before he can see what's coming and he either can make himself available for a blessing or he can get out of the way of a cursing this is what discernment gives us as believers we can rest in it genesis chapter 22 the time is just unfolding perfectly this evening this is where i want to end just ponder this what wisdom looks like it's confident and let me say it at the outset abraham had been given a promise he had his name changed he thought well i just need a seat of my own house could it be my servant seed or could it be through my servant my seed through through my wife's handmaid and the lord just keeps confirming his promise no it's going to be through sarah it's going to be your son it's going to be isaac and through him all the families of the earth are going to be blessed and your seed is going to be multiplied as the sands of the earth and the stars of heaven these are all the things that abraham believes and as he's gone through these paces and as he's walked with these up these places with god and entrusted to the promise now he comes to a difficult time with it with his son with the commandments of god with the word that he's been given how that he has to apply it to his son the things that he's asked to do as a father the things that he's going to ask his son to do and to be obedient to and if you can notice abraham never appears to panic why he had wisdom and i want you to see how confident abraham was in verse 1 22 genesis 22 verse 1 and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham instead of no abraham and you'll see this happen i think at least three different times abraham says here i am whether it's son his son or god he said behold here i am and god speaks take now thy son thy only son isaac whom thou love it's very interesting that god is not regarding the the son of of hey garit oh ishmael thy only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering this is not ambiguous it's very plain sacrifice your son upon one of the mountains which i'll tell you of offer your son as a burnt offering i believe the bible is very specific in the way this is written to convey to us something about abraham because the very next verse is not abraham pleading with god but says and abraham rose up early in the morning the very next action by abraham is god this is what you told me to do there's no disputing there's no wrestling it doesn't say and a week later abraham finally got up enough resolve to do what god had said immediately god speaking to him maybe coming to him in a vision that night or in a dream that night as soon as he raises up we ought to have this understanding that god comes to abraham and says to do something and the very next opportunity that abraham has to do it he rises up early in the morning he saddles his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son claimed the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went under the place of which god had told him in other words he got everything he needed he didn't just say well god told me to go sacrifice isaac on a hill and then drag his feet for a few days and then kind of feel the pressure well okay let's just go over here and show up with isaac and not have all the things that he would need he says god wants me to do this then i want to have everything i need for a burnt offering he brought young men with him he brought the wood that he would need he has everything with him including isaac and he went into the place which god had told him this is wisdom and action very confident even in the face of let's just all admit it this is a pretty wild thing to have to do am i the only one who's like kill your son but remember had because we wrestle with this right man god tempted abraham and well god didn't let him kill abraham or he killed his son isaac because if he had and we have all sorts of explanations and rationales as to why uh what would happen if abraham had succeeded but let's just be real real talk with brother aaron if abraham had been allowed to kill isaac whatever god says is truth and whatever god does is just let's never argue and rationalize with god in his word and what he says and what he establishes i'm grateful it didn't happen but had god asked him to do it and abraham succeeded we would have just said he did what god said for him to do and if that becomes father for the critic god's god he's the one that wrote this word he's the one that put in the scripture he's the one that asked abraham to do it but what we want to recognize is this is the wisdom of abraham verse 4 then on the third day this wasn't just a short journey he's had to think about this there's plenty of opportunity in the scripture for him said then abraham went back and abraham went here and abraham said this and abraham said that no it seems very purposeful he is preparing wisdom is giving him the confidence to prepare to make provision then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place so far off why because god had showed it to him and abraham said unto us his young men he brought the two men with him abide ye here with the ass and i in the lad will go yonder and i and the lad will worship and i believe it's appropriate to say and i am the lad will come again to you now if he's not sure how to express it i know that it's been preached and it's been offered that when he says i am the lad will go in worship that he's saying by this confession i am the lad will come again to you but he knows one thing is for sure he must go he must sacrifice and then he must return he's got to do what god said and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering this is wisdom taking all the things that are necessary not trying to skirt around it i'm not getting up there saying oh well i forgot the wood god i guess i gotta go three days all the way back home to the firewood pit you know i gotta get some firewood sorry god if you you've got time now it can take three days to go get it three days to come back you've got six days to change your mind god no he's preparing god told me to do it this is wisdom i gotta do everything this is what he wants me to do i've got to have the things necessary this is wisdom from above this is what i've got to do this is what i've got to do he takes the wood for the burnt offering and he lays it upon isaac his son and now he's already portraying how god is going to lay the sins of the world on his son jesus he's acting out the wisdom of god and in doing so he's foreshadowing the seed of abraham which is christ upon whom all the sins of the world will be laid and he took the fire in his hand and a knife wisdom is making the right kind of preparation a fool could be raging every step of the way abraham going yeah father of nations yeah whatever i can't believe he's asking me to do this i should have just been happy with ishmael and a full raging in his folly but this is what wisdom does even in the face of being asked to do one of the most difficult irrational things that we could ponder abraham is acting very purposely very diligently very confidently if i must do this then i've got to have wood i've got to have fire got to have a knife and they went both of them together and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and here he says again here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering i don't know if isaac is starting to think okay where's this whole thing going but he's asking the right kind of question maybe isaac doesn't have enough knowledge he doesn't have enough wisdom isn't privy to the things that god has been asking abraham to do but this is just like children this is just like the things that can arise in a household i'm doing what god's asked me to do i'm doing the best that i can with what god's revealed and you get asked certain questions well where's the lamb for burnt offering do parents always have the answers to all your children's questions this one doesn't behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for burnt offering and now notice just how beautiful abraham's response is abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they both of them went both of them together this is an extraordinary claim now we've already read where this goes in the next few verses but this is an extraordinary claim in the face of what god had asked abraham to do and in the face of everything he's doing in these affirmative steps to do it he's not languishing he's not fighting he's not wrestling asking god to reconsider he's doing exactly what god asked him to do he says my son god will provide he's declaring a very simple yet very robust and strong confidence in god this is the rest that wisdom affords he come to a place where he could trust in god trust in his promises trust what he has to say even in the face of this is not going the way that i thought it would this isn't happening the way that i wanted it to and the thought process that he could begin to engage in in his mind if you slay your son how can god keep his promise to you and your seed how it can be as many as the stars of heaven abraham says jehovah will see to it how can you be the father of many nations he had already been pondering this with each day that passed when he rose up early in the morning all these voices bombarding him jehovah will see to it as he went to get the wood and saddle his ass and get the young servants and get isaac how are you ever going to explain yourself jehovah will see to it with each day that passed 24 hours 48 hours 72 hours every question every scenario every challenge every worry every fear jehovah will see to it how will you go back home to your wife how will you go to sarah and return home with the blood of your son upon your hands and answer her questions jehovah will see to it hallelujah this is the confidence and this is the way that he met every distrust this is the way that he met every suspicion this is the way that he met every criticism he knew right where he was standing and even if he didn't have the exact answer he said jehovah will see to it i'm standing right where he wants me to stand i'm doing exactly what he wants me to do jehovah will see to it how are you going to meet your neighbors abraham you've testified the father of nations you've testified and professed to be a holy man how are you going to face servants and nations and people being a murderer of your own son jehovah will see to it so when he comes to slay isaac he stopped and as he had already spoken it i let me just maybe express it this way this is what's in his heart this is the answer to every question this is the answer to his rationalizations this is the answer to his own wrestling within his heart jehovah will see to it jehovah will see to it so that when his son finally asks him his answer is instinctive my son god will see to it god will provide trusting to him sure enough as he went to slay his son his hand is stopped and behold a ram caught in a thicket and he offers that lamb or that ram and in verse 14 it says and abraham called the name of that place jehovah jireh and we say my provider but has has such a rich meaning to it jehovah jireh and this is what they say as it is as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and the very strict simple translation of jehovah jireh is jehovah sees jehovah knows abraham had been saying it long before he ever named the place he'd been saying in his heart as the answer to every mistrust every personal doubt to every wrestling to every question to every anxiety to every fear jehovah sees jehovah sees jehovah sees and when his son finally asks him what is going to happen dad how are you going to sacrifice my son god will provide his jehovah gyra he knows he'll see to it that when he finally comes to the place and god has come upon the scene and the lord provide provided a ram to be sacrificed he had already had the theme mulling over in his heart as one who was confident and trusting to god he named the place jehovah jireh in the mount of lord it shall be seen jehovah sees jehovah knows this is how we ought to be as believers god knows god sees it's not that he sees your sins and your mistakes and all the things that you've done he knows he has the provision jehovah sees he sees what the promise is he sees the provision that's who we're trusting to how we're going to get out of this how are we going to make it work jehovah will see to it you think about the sacrifices we make as parents you think about the loneliness we experience as believers and trusting to him and keeping his word to the things that we go through and being obedient to god don't ever forget that jehovah sees don't ever forget that he knows he's jehovah jireh he sees that's why moses even comes back later and even expresses it in the mount of the lord it shall be seen why jehovah sees in other words jehovah jireh we say my provider jehovah will see to it jehovah will make a way i want to read to you something it's not very lengthy but this is what i'd like to close with it's from a sermon that charles spurgeon preached in october 12 1884 it's my mother's birthday not in 1884 but october 12th but he preached a sermon called jehovah jireh and he and he he's working from verse 14 but he refers to verse eight my son god will provide now listen i i feel just to read this paragraph to you in its entirety that first utterance was most remarkable it was simple enough but how prophetic it teaches us this truth are you listening that the confident speech of a believer is akin to the language of a prophet the confident speech of a believer is like the utterances it's like the speech is like the tongue of a prophet the confident speech of a believer the man who accepts the promise of god unstagnantly and is sure that it is true will speak like the seers of old he will see that god sees and will declare the fact and the holy inference which comes of it even if he doesn't have the answer even if he's not sure even if he doesn't know he can say my son god sees and that gives them the confidence that he needs because he accepts the promises of god without staggering he is sure that his promise is true then he can speak like the prophets of old he will see not what god sees but that he sees and he will declare the fact that he sees what are we going to do with our family what are we going to do about this what are we going to do that jehovah knows jehovah sees listen if we can't make all the promises we can to our children we can't make all the promises we want to our wife we can at least instill in them a confidence in his promise that he knows and he sees we demonstrate a confidence not because we've got it figured out not because we know we see what he sees but we know that he does see so he continues the believer's childlike assurance will anticipate the future hallelujah his childlike assurance just as that wise woman will rejoice in the time to come she laughs at the future so far from apprehension that she can look forward to a joyful confidence she looks forward to the future without anxiety she does it with a confident joy believers childlike assurance will anticipate the future and his plain statement god will provide will turn out to be literal truth literal truth if you want to come near to prophesy and listen to this believers if you want to come near to prophesying hold you hard to the promise of god if you want to be like these those that accept the promise of god and those that that take this truth of genesis 22 8-14 that the confident speech of a believer is like the tongue of a prophet if you want to come near to prophesy hold fast hold hard to the promise of god and you shall prophesy according to the measure of faith he that can say i know and am sure that god will not fail me in this my hour of tribulation will before long drop pearls of divine confidence in diamonds of prediction from his lips i'm so glad this just isn't some preacher and houston oh brother oh joel osteen i'm talking about you who's just trying to make me happy and just speak positive and have the right things to say i'm glad it's charles spurgeon october 12 1884 who's just taken the wrong truth of the bible it says somebody who could stand on the word and say i know and i'm sure that god will not fail me in my hour of testing shall be able to drop pearls of divine confidence in diamonds of prediction from his lips away with the bundles of thousands and all the diamond hands and all the pearls and all the riches and all the things that money can buy this is the kind of riches i want the diamonds of prediction from my lips that god will provide choice saiyans which become proverbs in the church are not the offspring of mistrust but a firm confidence in the living god listen he says to this day many a saying of a man of god is quoted among us even as abraham's word was quoted moses puts it as it is to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and we might mention many a sentence which is said unto this day which first fell from the mouth of a faithful spirit in the hour of the manifestation of the lord now listen each one i'm closing here the speech of the father of the faithful became the speech of a spiritual seed for many a year afterwards and it abides in the family of faith unto this day what was abraham basin it on what did abraham have to show he had he had everything it took including the request of god to sacrifice his son upon the altar but he still said jehovah will see to it and the speech of the father the faithful the speech of the father of our faith has become our speech as the spiritual seed today he says and it abides in the family of the faith unto this day if we have full faith in god we shall teach seceding generations to expect jehovah's hand to be stretched out still that's what i want to teach that's what i want you as being sheep in this church what i want you to come to expect is that jehovah's hand is going to be stretched out still not to flinch and be afraid of the the smilings of god and the rebuke of god in the chastisement of god but know that he reaches when he reaches out his hand is to assist it's to aid it's to benefit it's to help this is what we desire to teach our children this is what we desire to promote within our homes is that we having full faith in god will teach our children to expect that jehovah's hand is stretched out still to them and that we have this conviction and this faith that jehovah will see to it why are you teaching your daughter to live that way why are you teaching your sons to do that why do you deprive them of this why do you put lift up that why do you read your bible and pray with it why do you do this why do you do that god will provide jehovah will see if we could stand to our feet jehovah will see god will provide with our heads bowed could we make that our confession of faith right now our spiritual language that if we are perfectly and completely trusted in god and we have a firm confidence in the living god then we can drop pearls of divine confidence let's do that tonight let's talk to him and drop pearls of divine confidence and as we do that diamonds of prediction come from our lips what kind god will provide himself a lamb was it in that moment abraham hadn't rationalized with it [Music] hadn't tried to figure it out hadn't been there before and knew that there was a lot of rams in that mountain but could it be that every time he met this spirit of doubt he said god will provide how are you going to explain yourself to your wife jehovah will see to it how are you going to explain yourself to your neighbors and your servants jehovah will see to it if i'm doing what he's asked he will see to it if i'm doing what he asked he will see to it [Music] because he had practiced this discipline and this confidence and this character and had dropped all these pearls of divine confidence within a spirit that when it came time to answer the very difficult question from the lips of the sun that he would soon lay upon an altar to slay he spoke with these diamonds of prediction and prophecy god jehovah will provide himself a ram [Music] he will provide himself a lamb a sacrifice an offering he will provide himself a lamb for burnt offering [Music] could we tonight demonstrate that we with childlike assurance will anticipate the future we with the confident speech of a believer [Music] have our tongues motivated to say the right thing [Music] tell them i trust you lord i trust you lord i trust you i'm not afraid of the future anymore i trust you i'm not even afraid lord of the future to the extent that i've made bad decisions even to this moment because i know that my bad decision has not wrestled out of your hands your full and supreme and complete control over my ultimate destiny and i trust you you're saying now lord i fall into your grace i trust you let there be a wisdom that is poured out from on high that produces this verdant forest of righteousness and peace let it manifest itself let us pray our gracious heavenly father lord we have a childlike assurance that your word is true and not that we would rationalize with it for a child is assured of the promise that it pertains to them that they're to benefit by it child does not play games at the semantics it looks at it in its best lord i'm even reminded how that with my own children that if i say maybe they take it as a guarantee [Music] they take it as a yes lord let me have the kind of childlike confidence that if you've made a promise it's mine if you said you'd give permission provision it will be for me if you said you'd protect that's for me if you said that you'd provide that's for me and if abraham is the father of my faith and lord you have asked me to apply the token you've asked me to make difficult decisions you've asked me to to to make sacrifices in my life and the world may think what are you doing to your children what are you doing to your family lord may i meet every spirit of mistrust may i meet every criticism every lie every effort of the devil with jehovah will seek to it [Music] you will provide may that be our strong confidence today that wisdom from above can give us confidence and may we too purpose in our hearts that as this virtuous woman lives by the rules and the laws of wisdom and the law of kindness in her mouth lord let us also then have the speech to teach our children to trust in you what i i mean i may make a lot of mistakes as a dad but lord let me not fail in this one regard to demonstrate to my sons and my daughter that they can trust you they can trust your word they can trust your promises they can believe that this word is true may that be what we're looking to uphold and to lift up at the end of the day that they too without my experience and without my knowledge and without my background and the things that i've suffered and the nurture that i've endured that they too could take the same confidence and trust in your word and live a life that's overcoming by the word of humility let it be this wisdom that builds our house that it can be secure and at rest in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
