[3:30] Lord that I might receive my sight and
[3:35] Jesus said unto him go thy
[3:37] [Music]
[3:39] way thy
[3:41] faith have made thee whole and
[3:46] immediately he received his sight and
[3:49] followed Jesus in the way may the Lord
[3:53] bless the reading of his word shall we
[3:56] please be
[3:58] seated
[4:00] [Music]
[4:02] praise the
[4:03] Lord
[4:04] hallelujah so once again it's a
[4:07] privilege to be in the house of the
[4:11] Lord and I in particular also want to
[4:14] thank the almighty
[4:16] God for this opportunity to stand before
[4:21] his
[4:22] people last year by this time I was very
[4:27] sick I could not even
[4:30] walk so it's a great privilege for
[4:33] me that the Lord pull me
[4:36] through and
[4:38] uh he has brought me this far yes amen I
[4:43] was sharing with Pastor the last year by
[4:46] this time I have just gone through a
[4:48] surgery prostrate
[4:50] surgery when they said my prostrate
[4:53] became so big and for 9 months I was
[4:56] wearing
[4:58] ctia
[5:00] 9
[5:01] months and it was very difficult for
[5:06] me I gone through the surgery and uh at
[5:09] a point even I could not walk I have to
[5:13] be using the worker to
[5:15] walk it was so difficult at a time that
[5:18] I could not raise my leg or my feet and
[5:21] put it here to this little step and
[5:25] walk it was so difficult that at a time
[5:29] I could when I lie down I could not t
[5:31] this way or that
[5:33] way it was so difficult that if I lie
[5:37] down somebody has to pull
[5:38] me my wife has to pull me it was so
[5:42] difficult that if I have to sit in the
[5:44] car I have to find a way to sit backward
[5:47] and then they have to raise my leg and
[5:50] put it in and here to put it
[5:52] in it was so difficult even to eat I was
[5:57] it was difficult for me
[6:01] after the surgery has been
[6:04] done some few weeks two or three we I
[6:08] had uh an infection they it was a blood
[6:13] infection and so I have to stay in the
[6:16] emergency for about 6
[6:19] days when the surgery was done about 5
[6:22] hours
[6:23] surgery they distract me the next day
[6:28] but when I had this this complication or
[6:30] this problem I have to stay there for 6
[6:35] days and it happened that I went to the
[6:37] hospital the doctor asked me to do some
[6:40] uh cystogram like a scan or whatever and
[6:44] so I went to the hospital with my wife
[6:46] and uh I was on the table for the cogram
[6:50] to be done or be taken and then the
[6:53] table was just begin to shake as if
[6:55] somebody was shaking it and the doct
[6:58] what is happening I don't know and from
[7:01] there I didn't know what happened again
[7:03] I only saw myself in the
[7:07] emergency so my wife said they called
[7:10] her because I was I knew I was shaken so
[7:14] they called her they call who brought
[7:16] himo okay she's the one and then she
[7:18] went out and then she I was on the table
[7:21] there and then it seems all my system
[7:25] was shutting down kidneys my wife is a
[7:28] midwife n so and the nurses and doctors
[7:32] she was there and everything was going
[7:36] down but she was praying and because God
[7:40] has not yet finished with me he brought
[7:42] me back
[7:45] yes when I was told back in Ghana I went
[7:49] to the doctor and uh they found out that
[7:53] um the problem with the prostate and
[7:57] then also the doctor said no there is
[7:59] cancer if your prostate is divided into
[8:02] 10 there is a portion one portion that
[8:05] has
[8:06] cancer
[8:08] where he and he begin to come me down
[8:10] you don't have to be afraid don't have
[8:12] to worry it's a little something but I
[8:14] was not afraid because when he just
[8:17] mentioned cancer the only thing that
[8:19] came to me do you fear
[8:22] cancer CU I remember the prophet
[8:24] preached that and the prophet told us
[8:28] there is no fear
[8:29] there is no virtue in fear right and
[8:33] fear only torments right
[8:36] so the Lord help me and no I was not
[8:41] afraid but I was just having pains and
[8:44] just pains so
[8:47] finally the brothers like brother B
[8:49] coffee they got to hear about that and
[8:51] then he advised that no brother Timothy
[8:54] if you can get out get out now to come
[8:56] we see our
[8:57] best will help to to see what the
[9:00] doctors we have doctors we have this so
[9:02] I came in so at this
[9:04] time I have to stay there and then uh it
[9:08] was very difficult and uh not e b to eat
[9:13] everything was just going down but once
[9:16] again the grace of God came
[9:18] down and he pulled me out of
[9:22] it
[9:23] because brother Bram said when God has
[9:26] not finished with you nothing can take
[9:28] you out of here I strongly believe in
[9:32] that am am I be in the flight when the
[9:36] plane is just just good and I sat down
[9:39] with somebody I told a brother brother B
[9:42] said that if God has not finished with
[9:45] us nothing can take us
[9:47] so I strongly believe in that and let us
[9:51] believe in that yes because we have not
[9:55] come here
[9:57] accidentally right somebody brought us
[10:00] here and the one that brought us here is
[10:04] mindful of us and I used to tell the
[10:07] people when the bible say that God is
[10:10] mindful of us it means his mind is full
[10:15] of you
[10:18] right mindful of you his mind is full of
[10:24] you we did not save ourselves but he
[10:27] save us and he has purpose in saving
[10:30] your life right
[10:33] and nothing can defeat that purpose of
[10:38] God so we as children of God we are told
[10:43] not to fear right the prophet of God
[10:47] said God don't want his children to fear
[10:51] right God wants his children to
[10:55] believe because to them that believe all
[10:58] things are possible
[10:59] so he wants you to
[11:02] believe no matter what happens around
[11:06] you God wants you to
[11:10] believe and I've spoken and encourag the
[11:12] brothers that
[11:14] um we should
[11:17] never try to compare ourselves with one
[11:22] another yes right don't compare yourself
[11:25] to
[11:26] anybody because you are not any body you
[11:30] are who you are yes right so it is not
[11:34] wise to compare yourself to
[11:37] anybody because we are all made
[11:40] differently for different
[11:44] purposes that's right my trial will not
[11:47] be your trial and your trial may not be
[11:50] my trial so it is not even for you to be
[11:53] asking why should it be me why should I
[11:56] suffer this why shouldn't you suffer
[11:58] that
[11:59] that should be the question if why you
[12:03] ask why should it be mean who should it
[12:07] be so don't compare yourself to anybody
[12:11] because Satan sometimes want us to pity
[12:17] ourselves to feel bad because if you
[12:20] look at yourself and you question why
[12:22] should it be me and you maybe you look
[12:24] at others say ah this one is okay this
[12:27] one is okay everybody is say why I me
[12:30] then you have
[12:33] self-pity and that is
[12:36] sin so don't compare your life to
[12:41] anybody because brother Bram
[12:46] said if you have a trial or a test from
[12:51] God you find favor with God right yeah
[12:55] and he said then God has has confidence
[12:59] in
[13:00] you and God knows that you will stand
[13:04] the test like job right
[13:07] right God has confidence in you it's not
[13:11] because God is against you it's because
[13:14] God laughes you is because God has
[13:17] confidence in you and remember when the
[13:20] enemy came to test job it was not job
[13:24] that called for the test it was God that
[13:25] called for
[13:26] it it was the Lord that told Satan have
[13:30] you considered my servant's job right
[13:35] that there is no like him yes a man that
[13:39] fearth God and andth
[13:43] Evil have you consider him you might
[13:46] have gotten
[13:47] everybody you might have gotten the
[13:49] young men and the young women the old
[13:51] and all the ages but what about job you
[13:55] that's my
[13:56] servant and God is proud of his people
[14:00] and God is Not Afraid for any of his own
[14:04] to be tested he allows it to prove a
[14:10] point to the enemy that this is mine and
[14:14] I love to read the scripture and the
[14:16] scripture said that Satan was speaking
[14:20] and he said to God he it is job serving
[14:23] God for nothing is it not because you
[14:27] have done this and you have done that
[14:28] for him
[14:29] and you've made a edge over him right I
[14:33] said praise the
[14:36] Lord how did he know that there was a
[14:39] edge over
[14:41] job how did he know that the door was
[14:44] locked how did he know he could not
[14:46] touch job because he tried many
[14:51] times and he
[14:53] failed so nothing can touch us and
[14:57] nothing can harm us and nothing can come
[14:59] to us unless the shepherd opens the
[15:05] door how did he know that there was a
[15:08] hedge of a job because he has tried on
[15:10] his own and he couldn't touch him right
[15:13] so God has to give the
[15:16] permission so if anything will come to
[15:18] you or to me God has to give the
[15:21] permission amen and he has a purpose for
[15:25] that so that you will be a witness and
[15:29] then the prophet said sometimes a
[15:32] witness must suffer a little
[15:39] yeah amen so God is mindful of us after
[15:44] this after even I wear the ceter for
[15:48] nine good
[15:51] months when they even took the ceter I
[15:54] have to wear
[15:56] Pampers for about a month
[16:01] praise the Lord I became a big baby baby
[16:08] boy praise the Lord but if I've not gone
[16:11] through this how will I be
[16:14] testifying and God allow it so that I
[16:17] can be here today and testify to you so
[16:20] that you will know he has not forgotten
[16:24] you so that you will know that whatever
[16:27] you might be going through through it's
[16:29] not permanent something yes sir it's
[16:32] just temporal very good the sun will
[16:35] soon rise and the Darkness will be
[16:37] despaired yes
[16:40] Hallelujah don't feel sad oh you think I
[16:44] prayed too much I prayed too long I've
[16:46] been serving God why should it happen to
[16:49] me because you are serving God that's
[16:52] why it happens
[16:54] yeah brother BR said The more loyal you
[16:57] are the more the test wow
[17:01] amen so in our trials and our
[17:04] difficulties let us put on cheerful
[17:09] attitude yes like I said the Bible told
[17:12] us one day Paul and Solas were thrown to
[17:15] jail because of the Gospel not because
[17:18] of anything that they have done but
[17:21] because of the preaching of the Gospel
[17:22] of Jesus Christ the same gospel that we
[17:25] believe in today they took them they
[17:28] beat them and they throw them into jail
[17:31] they have brues over their bodies but
[17:34] the Bible tell told us when they went to
[17:37] prison they decided to sing and worship
[17:40] God right in your trials you got to make
[17:44] a choice whether to sing whether to be
[17:47] happy or whether to
[17:50] complain whether to complain and Mama
[17:53] against God or to blame God why should
[17:57] this happen to me
[17:59] but Apostle Paul and Silas the Bible
[18:03] told us they begin to Worship the Lord
[18:05] they begin to sing praises and they sang
[18:08] Praises so much until other prisoners
[18:11] heard them singing and that's my problem
[18:14] that if they were singing and worshiping
[18:16] God in prison What About Us in
[18:23] church we think as if we are ashamed of
[18:26] what we are
[18:27] doing we sing as if we don't know what
[18:30] we are
[18:31] doing but this men were
[18:34] beaten and nobody has beaten us this
[18:38] morning this men were beaten this men
[18:41] has been their clothes have been torn
[18:44] this they have been disgraced in the
[18:48] public and they have thrown them into
[18:50] jail for
[18:52] nothing and they decided we will sing
[18:55] and they begin to sing two brothers two
[19:00] brothers and they sank and other
[19:02] prisoners had and
[19:04] singing and they sank so much until the
[19:07] walls and the doors and everything was
[19:11] shaken and they sang until the doors
[19:14] were
[19:15] open yet they have been
[19:18] beaten yet they have been
[19:23] disgraced may God help us
[19:25] yes amen so that when we are worshiping
[19:30] God we should worship god
[19:32] cheerfully with
[19:34] joy oh Hallelujah because it doesn't own
[19:38] us anything he has done all for us he
[19:42] paid the price for us he redeem us he's

[19:52] all hell King Jesus all hell Emmanuel is
[19:57] the king of Kings and is the Lord of
[20:00] Lord we is redeemed will is people is
[20:03] depending on us there is one thing that
[20:05] God cannot do for himself God cannot
[20:07] worship
[20:10] himself he can't do it God is an object
[20:14] of worship the worship must come from
[20:16] his children from his subjects we are
[20:20] his subjects and we are created to
[20:23] worship the king let's worship him let's
[20:27] bless him let's exalt him let's glorify
[20:30] him amen hallelujah amen praise the name
[20:34] of the
[20:35] Lord yeah you should never be
[20:38] ashamed to sing his
[20:41] Praises you should never be ashamed to
[20:44] worship him oh Hallelujah to be
[20:48] identified with
[20:49] [Music]
[20:51] him
[20:53] amen they Worship the Lord and they
[20:56] praise the Lord and they were happy the
[20:59] Bible told us in the book of Acts when
[21:01] the disciples went out and they were
[21:03] beaten they came back
[21:06] rejoicing not crying
[21:08] rejoicing that they have been accounted
[21:12] worthy to be beaten for Christ to suffer
[21:16] for Christ to be laugh at to be called
[21:19] names they came back
[21:21] rejoicing and they came back they said
[21:24] Lord see all that they are doing give us
[21:26] strength that with courage than ever
[21:28] before we will proclaim the
[21:32] gospel not running back yes not
[21:36] retreating right there is no retreating
[21:39] Christ we go forward no matter what is
[21:42] there hallelujah amen praise the name of

[21:49] people and I just love to encourage the
[21:51] people let's go forward thank you Lord
[21:54] let's keep pressing on Oh Brother s he
[21:57] has a purpose
[21:58] yes think about it the Bible tells us
[22:02] when they sank and the doors
[22:04] open they stay in the prison right they
[22:08] didn't go
[22:09] out they could have run
[22:12] away but they stay right there because
[22:16] those that are led by the spirit of God
[22:18] they are the sons of God yes they could
[22:22] have gone
[22:24] out Peter was in prison Peter was was
[22:28] sleeping between two men and he was
[22:33] sleeping Two Soldiers one year one day
[22:37] and the Believers prayed the Believers
[22:40] were praying the Believers were
[22:42] praying and the Bible told us and the
[22:45] angel of the Lord came down midnight and
[22:48] I said the angel did not come midnight
[22:50] because he was afraid of the day yeah
[22:53] because the same God of the day is the
[22:55] god of the night right he's the many
[22:58] potent God he is the almighty God but he
[23:02] used to come at night time because the
[23:05] Believers were praying at that time and
[23:08] he decided because in answering prayer
[23:11] he is
[23:12] Sovereign nobody tells him what to do he
[23:15] does what he want to do because he has a
[23:17] reason and he has a purpose and he does
[23:20] everything for his own
[23:23] Glory Hallelujah and he came down and
[23:27] when he came down I told the people and
[23:29] he was not working
[23:32] like no he was not afraid when he came
[23:37] down he was in charge he was in control
[23:40] there is somebody that is in control he
[23:43] controls the Affairs of nature almighty
[23:46] God rules in the Affairs of men amen our
[23:49] God is our God yes he's our Lord he
[23:52] controls everything and if you have a
[23:54] God that controls everything why do you
[23:56] worry what's your problem what's your
[24:00] fear your God controls everything am our
[24:03] God is the creator he's the provider
[24:06] he's the almighty is's the all in all so

[24:41] these spirals or whatever Robin and they
[24:43] were talking and they were whispering to

[24:46] another and they said oh look at these
[24:49] human beings they are always sad look at
[24:54] these human beings every day with long
[24:55] faces yeah and one of them said maybe
[24:59] they don't have a God Like Our

[26:37] take you out of
[26:42] here
[26:43] hallelujah what a mighty God we are
[26:46] serving yes indeed he's great yes indeed
[26:49] he's Almighty Peter was taken out of
[26:52] prison Paul and Silas even when the
[26:55] prison doors open they were sitting down
[26:57] there
[26:58] yes what of Sunday said you remember
[27:01] Peter went out of prison why don't you
[27:02] people go quickly
[27:05] no you don't compare yourself to
[27:08] anybody right we are saved for different
[27:14] purposes Paul and Salah stayed and when
[27:17] the morning and the officer woke up and
[27:20] he saw the doors were open and he
[27:22] thought the prisoners have run away he
[27:24] took knife sword or whatever he wanted
[27:26] to kill himself but said no don't do it
[27:29] we are
[27:30] here and I believe that officer might
[27:33] have seen a lot of prisoners run away
[27:36] and he might have know the consequence
[27:38] that if you let anybody go you you
[27:42] replace him you exchange with your life
[27:46] so he wanted to kill himself but said no
[27:49] don't do any evil to your we are
[27:53] here H you are there yes sir what type
[27:57] of prisoners are
[27:59] these These are different
[28:02] prisoners the prisoners of
[28:05] Love prisoners of God prisoners of the
[28:09] word oh brother Bram said God is looking
[28:12] for
[28:14] prisoners to the word of
[28:18] God prisoners that will not do what they
[28:21] like what they think or what they feel
[28:24] or what anybody want or what anybody is
[28:27] doing prisoners that will just stay
[28:30] behind his
[28:31] [Music]
[28:35] word the man said the next thing that
[28:38] man said what must I do to be
[28:41] saved why did they go to prison they
[28:43] went there because of that man and his
[28:46] family if they had run away that man
[28:49] would have died his family would have
[28:51] been lost but because they stayed there
[28:54] that's why we have this verse of the
[28:56] scriptures amen yes amen what shall we
[29:00] do to be saved an apostle PA believe on
[29:03] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy
[29:06] household shall be saved
[29:11] right what of if they have run
[29:14] away do you know what the Bible talk
[29:16] about the soul brother BR said one Soul
[29:20] was
[29:21] 10,000s of this words one soul
[29:25] 10,000s of this words and the Bible
[29:28] tells us there is joy in heaven when one
[29:32] Soul come to repentance so one so me so
[29:36] much to God yes thank you
[29:40] Jesus
[29:43] amen Lord help
[29:45] us we should not lose our passion for
[29:50] Souls brother BR said we have a
[29:54] responsibility to tell somebody about
[29:56] Christ
[29:59] when we are saved we have a
[30:02] responsibility he said you cannot even C
[30:05] somebody
[30:06] unbeliever until you first witness that
[30:12] fellow you have a responsibility how
[30:15] many people have you tried to speak
[30:18] to oh don't go there
[30:21] brother how many people what are we
[30:24] living for why are we here
[30:28] is God save us and we are okay with it
[30:31] what about our loved
[30:33] ones what about our neighbors what about
[30:36] our colleagues in the place of work who
[30:39] is going to witness to them who is going
[30:41] to talk to them who is going to share
[30:43] with
[30:45] them wake up Church yeah very good let's
[30:50] be up and be do
[30:52] it because until the last El let come
[30:56] say we are tired of this word amen but
[30:59] until the last elect comes we are not
[31:01] going and who will bring in the last
[31:04] elect maybe you are the one who is the
[31:07] last elect maybe your neighbor maybe

[32:02] lost so God allow look at the way they
[32:05] were beaten look at the way they were
[32:07] treated and after

[41:44] God was or who God is yeah well he said
[41:47] I am afraid that the church doesn't know
[41:51] their
[41:52] Authority I am afraid that Holy
[41:56] ghostborn men doesn't realize their
[41:59] Authority or the authority that God has
[42:03] permitted to the
[42:11] church Joshua stopped the
[42:15] Su by faith But Blind bimus sto the s o
[42:20] n by faith

[42:27] stop the s o n by
[42:31] faith we are
[42:33] taught without faith none of us can
[42:37] please the Lord without faith it is
[42:41] impossible to please God and the Bible
[42:44] tells us he that cometh to God must
[42:49] believe that he is and he is the
[42:53] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[42:57] him not
[43:01] sluggishly but

[43:48] think I'm concern about what he
[43:52] says and do you know by the way the only
[43:55] way that you can serve God is to lose
[43:57] your
[44:00] mind that's all if you don't lose your
[44:03] mind you cannot serve him you lose your
[44:06] mind and get the mind of Christ let this
[44:09] mind which was in Christ be in
[44:11] you so with your kind of man you can
[44:14] never serve God and you can never please
[44:16] God so what we need is the mind of
[44:19] Christ the mind of Christ is the word of
[44:21] God so you have to forsake your way
[44:24] forsake your thought forsake your
[44:26] opinions your ideas you must die to them
[44:30] and take what God
[44:34] says we must die to ourselves Church of
[44:37] the Living God

[44:52] creator it's a privilege he has given to
[44:54] us to serve him it's a privilege don't
[44:57] think you are doing something for God
[44:59] God is giving us opportunity privilege
[45:02] to serve him so that tomorrow you be
[45:05] somewhere

[46:49] prophet of God said faith is the most
[46:53] common thing there is amen

[47:12] without
[47:14] faith he said when they had to apply the
[47:17] blood in Egypt they use H or ES whatever
[47:20] you call it brother BR said it was a
[47:22] common we common he said it grew goes

[47:59] simple now this is what the prophet is
[48:02] speaking and we try to press it out and
[48:06] make it something that no one can take a
[48:10] hold of right it's so simple that you go
[48:15] over the top of it trying to find it
[48:19] out it's so
[48:21] simple as we are sitting down he said
[48:24] it's simple with that f you can't even
[48:26] raise your
[48:27] hand you cannot he said how did you come
[48:30] here you just sat in your car just Dr
[48:33] you are here the same way you know as if
[48:36] you take water to drink it's simple but
[48:39] sometime we have make it we are making
[48:41] it complicated but it's
[48:44] simple that is faith in the finished
[48:47] work of Calvary Faith bases on the word
[48:50] of the Lord God said this I believe it
[48:54] finished
[48:56] childlike
[48:58] Faith just
[49:01] obey just follow
[49:03] it how did Joshua Stop The Sound by
[49:07] faith
[49:11] right Hallelujah and brother BR said Not
[49:14] only did Joshua do do do that now it
[49:18] wasn't just for
[49:19] Joshua it wasn't only for Joshua only it
[49:23] was for any believer that can take God's
[49:26] word
[49:30] yes are we any believers here yes we are
[49:35] so he said for any believer who can take
[49:37] God's word that's
[49:39] all what did God told Joshua as I was
[49:43] with Moses I will be with you amen I
[49:46] will not fail you am no man shall be
[49:50] able to stand before you all the days of
[49:53] your life and he told him wherever you
[49:56] will go whether soever th go I'll be
[49:58] there and Joshua believe
[50:02] it do we also believe because Jesus
[50:05] spoke to Mata at the grave when Mata met
[50:08] Jesus when Lazarus passed away and M M
[50:11] Jesus came there MAA went out to meet
[50:14] him and he said oh Lord if you have been
[50:18] here my brother would not have
[50:20] died but now that you are here I know
[50:23] that whatsoever you shall ask the father
[50:24] it will be done
[50:26] Jesus said matter your brother shall
[50:29] live again shall rise oh yes I know in
[50:32] the resurrection she would rise he will
[50:34] rise say I am the
[50:37] resurrection so in the crisis of Lazarus
[50:41] the family crisis the Revelation came
[50:44] out that Jesus is the resurrection they
[50:47] didn't knew that before he had never
[50:48] said that to them before but now he
[50:50] tells them listen I am the
[50:53] resurrection when they said Lazarus was
[50:56] dead and they was sick they s for Jesus
[50:59] he didn't

[55:45] [Music]
[55:46] enemy that's why the Bible tells us
[55:49] Jesus said
[55:52] love your enemies right
[55:56] love those who despise F use you and
[56:00] pray for
[56:02] them so that you become the children of
[56:06] your father in Heaven let me see if I
[56:09] have a little something that I can read
[56:12] it and he said we should love our
[56:14] enemies pray for those who despitefully
[56:17] use us
[56:20] hey those who misuse that pray for
[56:23] them Jesus said we should pray for them
[56:26] don't be against them you know as I've
[56:29] been talking to people you see is
[56:31] rightel
[56:32] today
[56:35] fighting never never since they became a
[56:38] nation has such a thing happened to them
[56:41] to lose in a day over thousand people in
[56:45] their own land has never
[56:48] happened it has never
[56:50] happened but what happened at that time
[56:54] they were fighting among
[56:56] themselves they were almost about to
[56:58] break into Civil War among
[57:02] themselves there was a big
[57:04] misunderstanding confusion among
[57:07] them this one accusing this one this one
[57:09] accusing this one and in their unguided
[57:12] moment Satan came in their enemies took
[57:15] advantage said these people are busy
[57:17] talking against themselves fighting
[57:18] against
[57:20] themselves so the enemy just came in and
[57:23] look at the price they paying
[57:26] today heavy
[57:29] price since they started this war and
[57:31] Lord has died many of the
[57:34] soldiers that is is not common because
[57:38] one person to die for Israel is a big
[57:41] thing and you talk about how many
[57:43] soldiers over 100 soldiers have already
[57:46] died but all
[57:49] because in their unguided
[57:53] moment
[57:55] let me read this that the prophet
[57:59] said I have never talked like this to a
[58:02] group of people but in this locality
[58:06] here and throughout the Nations it is
[58:09] becoming
[58:11] now if the devil can keep us
[58:14] separated he's got us shooting at one
[58:18] another he's got a open Target anywhere
[58:23] he wants to shoot
[58:25] and what is the use of
[58:28] shooting we are shooting one another
[58:32] see so he can just sit back and
[58:37] relax when we are shooting one another
[58:40] he can just sit back and
[58:42] relax he will say just go ahead that
[58:45] your brother is not a good brother that
[58:48] just just go ahead shoot him whatever
[58:51] you know about him tell
[58:53] him the prophet said said let me just
[58:55] give you if I found in your sight if I
[59:00] found Grace in your
[59:02] sight through
[59:05] God you take my word for this
[59:09] Breen if you want to be a blessing and
[59:13] get a
[59:14] blessing how many want to be a blessing
[59:18] how many want to get a blessing I want
[59:20] to get a blessing and I want to be a
[59:22] blessing and the prophet say if you want
[59:25] to be a blessing and get a
[59:31] blessing and get a blessing listen to
[59:34] this when a man has done you
[59:37] wrong when a man has done you
[59:40] wrong and he has
[59:43] absolutely I mean he has done you wrong
[59:47] and you know that he's done you
[59:50] wrong he's done you evil right he said
[59:54] don't mention
[59:56] that he said don't mention that he said
[59:59] what don't mention that he has done you
[1:00:03] wrong I mean he has done you
[1:00:06] evil oh God help us somebody call what
[1:00:10] brother BR he said brother you are
[1:00:13] Antichrist you are devil he said praise

[1:00:24] me to go to he said I will still love
[1:00:26] him

[1:00:31] will so if his will for me is to go to
[1:00:35] her be he said that's
[1:00:37] fine oh such a life will make Satan
[1:00:40] ashamed of
[1:00:42] himself that is the messenger God sent
[1:00:45] to us and that is the message we are
[1:00:47] following because the messenger and the
[1:00:49] messageer are
[1:00:52] one don't mention that
[1:00:55] and they said to him brother how can you
[1:00:57] be fine with people they call you they
[1:00:59] speak so much about your family call you
[1:01:01] all kinds of names and you are

[1:01:38] spirit of him that ra go raise up Christ
[1:01:41] from the dead dwells in us it will
[1:01:43] Quicken our mortal bodies he will bring
[1:01:46] it to the same spot as Sons and
[1:01:49] Daughters of
[1:01:50] God that's why they call the Christians
[1:01:53] Christ life like yes in Antioch because
[1:01:57] they were like
[1:01:58] Christ are we also like him yes in our
[1:02:01] behavior in our reactions in our

[1:09:55] amen Our Father want us to do this
[1:09:59] am if you love those who love you alone
[1:10:01] said the Edens they do the same but the
[1:10:04] Christianity is to go the extra
[1:10:08] M to do good if your enemy is hungry
[1:10:11] giving food to eat if he tested giving
[1:10:14] water to
[1:10:15] drink hey that's
[1:10:18] Christianity this we cannot do on our
[1:10:20] own except the spirit of Christ comes in
[1:10:24] except we let him have his way the more
[1:10:26] I Surrender the more he takes
[1:10:29] control we surrender to what the word
[1:10:32] right this is what your word says lord I
[1:10:34] can't do it but do it for me take
[1:10:37] control over my
[1:10:38] life let them call me foolish and
[1:10:41] stupid Lord let me die to myself the
[1:10:45] only way we can do this and oby is to
[1:10:48] die to ourselves and the prophet said
[1:10:52] your greatest enemy me it's
[1:10:58] yourself Lord help
[1:11:00] us I'm sorry if I'm not making you happy
[1:11:04] but I'm making you to think yeah that's
[1:11:06] good I don't
[1:11:09] regret I pray God to help me because
[1:11:13] when the pastor stand to preach he
[1:11:15] preach to himself we preach to
[1:11:18] ourselves because all of us must meet
[1:11:21] the requirement of God amen amen
[1:11:24] am and what I'm saying you can make it
[1:11:28] we can make it because if we cannot make
[1:11:30] it he will not say it he has already
[1:11:33] provided he has already given us Grace
[1:11:36] so we can make it because the world will
[1:11:38] know that we are the sons of God because
[1:11:41] only sons of God can do that only
[1:11:44] children of God can do that and we are
[1:11:46] his children the same spirit that was in
[1:11:49] Christ when he said father forgive them
[1:11:51] did anybody repented before he said
[1:11:53] father forgive them did anybody
[1:11:55] apologize to him before he said father
[1:11:57] forgive
[1:11:58] them huh did somebody apologize no you
[1:12:02] said father forgive them they don't even
[1:12:04] know what they are
[1:12:06] doing the same Spirit Ste said father
[1:12:09] forgive them when they Stone him they
[1:12:12] Stone him they forgive them they don't
[1:12:14] even know what they the same Spirit if
[1:12:16] the same spirit is in us who will do the
[1:12:19] same amen if the spirit of Christ is in
[1:12:22] a man he will live like Christ if the
[1:12:24] spirit of boving is a man he will write
[1:12:26] SS like
[1:12:31] boving
[1:12:32] amen praise the Lord please be saying
[1:12:36] Amen to God's
[1:12:38] word hallelujah this brother is very
[1:12:41] funny yeah he's crazy that's okay all
[1:12:44] right I'm all right with
[1:12:47] that and when you get back down to Earth
[1:12:50] again you will go over to the brother
[1:12:52] and shake his hand cuz you know what he
[1:12:55] has been through you can't stand with a
[1:12:58] M in the presence of God and condemn
[1:13:02] anybody I don't believe no sir even if
[1:13:07] he is a rank
[1:13:08] Sinner and what about a brother that has
[1:13:12] made a mistake though I say he's wrong
[1:13:16] sometimes he accused wrong when he's not
[1:13:20] even wrong but if he is wrong well if we
[1:13:25] would take him to the throne of God
[1:13:28] stand there shoulder to shoulder with
[1:13:30] our brother knowing this is another
[1:13:33] Point
