[0:00] ecclesiastes chapter one i'm gonna read
[0:02] verses one to three
[0:03] i'm gonna hold off on my title um for
[0:06] some time i will give it and maybe the
[0:09] after about 15 minutes or so just
[0:11] reading some foundational things here in
[0:13] ecclesiastes
[0:14] and i will say this it is
[0:17] a very a very unique subject matter
[0:20] it is one that i've been studying now
[0:22] for several years
[0:24] and maybe have ministered on just little
[0:25] glimpses of it
[0:27] uh in the past
[0:28] but god having dealt with my heart even
[0:30] recently on certain things he just gave
[0:32] me this complete liberty this week to
[0:35] minister on this subject
[0:37] and so i don't i'm just going to
[0:40] open up my heart and share share with
[0:42] you and then i i don't have any um
[0:47] i don't necessarily have any kind of
[0:48] long-term vision in terms of all the
[0:50] things i'd want to cover but we're just
[0:52] introducing something and i believe
[0:53] it'll be a great context for god to deal
[0:55] with your hearts but i do ask that you'd
[0:57] be very
[0:58] intentional and you're listening and if
[1:01] there's any kind of
[1:03] uncertainty or if you might feel a
[1:05] little funny about what's being said
[1:08] that i would trust trust the word of god
[1:10] trust the discernment you have and just
[1:12] ask god to place it just right in your
[1:14] heart to see it the way he would want
[1:16] you to see it
[1:17] and and i believe that god will bless
[1:19] you and i'm not going to provide the
[1:21] scriptures and quotes as i normally
[1:23] would in the slideshow because i just
[1:25] didn't want you to be distracted by any
[1:27] changes i want you to be very focused on
[1:29] the words i'm using tonight ecclesiastes
[1:32] chapter 1
[1:33] verse 1 to 3 the words of the preacher
[1:36] the son of david king in jerusalem
[1:40] vanity of vanity saith the preacher
[1:42] vanity of vanities all
[1:44] is vanity
[1:46] what prophet hath a man of all his labor
[1:49] which he taketh under the sun very
[1:51] foreboding
[1:53] very dark gloomy
[1:55] vanity of all vanity of vanities say at
[1:57] the preacher vanity of vanities this
[1:59] repetition of it for emphasis all is
[2:02] vanity and then this phrase what prophet
[2:05] hath the man of all his labor which he
[2:07] taketh under the sun
[2:09] amen you can take your seats
[2:14] as we read these words
[2:16] and he uses these phrases and he's
[2:18] introduced as the preacher the son of
[2:20] david king in jerusalem
[2:21] widely regarded and we believe this to
[2:23] be solomon who wrote these things
[2:25] it is
[2:26] vanity of vanities vanity of vanities
[2:28] all is vanity there's really no
[2:30] qualification in terms of some some is
[2:33] vanity others are not vanity he's just
[2:35] saying everything under the sun is
[2:37] vanity
[2:38] and he makes this statement what prophet
[2:40] hath the man of all his labor which he
[2:42] taketh under the sun what does he gain
[2:45] what comes from it what real enjoyment
[2:47] does he get from it and i want you to
[2:49] ponder this um
[2:51] for a while i was thinking back in terms
[2:53] of some of the things we ministered last
[2:55] year and we looked at
[2:56] some of these very same scriptures about
[2:58] a year ago
[2:59] and i'm not wanting to look at a little
[3:01] bit differently but i want just to
[3:02] ponder it from a different perspective
[3:04] but these are the observations of
[3:06] someone who's frustrated with the
[3:08] pursuit of meaning
[3:10] and and i've just i've thought about it
[3:12] and just tried to enter into maybe the
[3:13] perspective of solomon not trying to
[3:15] draw from
[3:17] any kind of meaning of the words
[3:18] necessarily but taking the whole book
[3:20] together what is what's driving him to
[3:22] conclude this and you just get this
[3:24] sense that solomon must have let out a
[3:26] kind of a deep sigh and just was like
[3:27] you know what
[3:28] what's the point
[3:30] what's it all about what what's it all
[3:32] worth and he's expressing this
[3:34] uh a frustration with even his his
[3:36] pursuit of something fulfilling or
[3:38] something that gives it gives him
[3:39] happiness and joy
[3:41] and when he uses this word vanity and he
[3:44] concludes that all is vanity it's a very
[3:46] remarkable statement
[3:48] and i'd like to say this that it's not
[3:50] that he's making it an observation about
[3:52] creation or the purpose of god but he's
[3:54] just looking at man and what he's trying
[3:56] to achieve and what he tries to
[3:57] accomplish and the happiness he's trying
[3:59] to get out of everything he's saying at
[4:01] the end of the day what prophet hath the
[4:02] man of his labor he said that's the
[4:04] vanity so much given so much potential
[4:07] so much before us and everything seems
[4:09] to be vanity and vanity is something
[4:12] that's empty it's something that is
[4:15] meaningless the word speaks of
[4:16] meaningless
[4:17] and so he's expressing a sentiment of
[4:20] hopelessness
[4:21] and what i'd want you to kind of just
[4:23] think about the despair that maybe
[4:25] solomon is expressing in this as he's
[4:28] saying there's nothing gained in
[4:29] everything we do or at least we can say
[4:32] for himself now and we're looking at at
[4:34] the beginning of the book we kind of
[4:35] know where he concludes and we realize
[4:37] this has been a fruitful exercise so
[4:39] maybe i'll just say it now once
[4:40] solomon's gone through all of this
[4:42] writing he comes in and said there's
[4:43] nothing better than from someone just to
[4:44] serve god
[4:46] uh and so he comes to the right
[4:47] conclusion in the end but as he starts
[4:49] to go through the formula and put the
[4:50] pieces together he has this real
[4:52] internal struggle in this real wrestling
[4:54] he says there's nothing grasped there's
[4:56] nothing gained and what what do i have
[4:58] to show for all my labor
[5:00] and this is i want you to really grab
[5:02] ahold of this because it's not just
[5:04] solomon
[5:05] in his wisdom that's doing this mental
[5:07] exercise
[5:08] but in his wisdom he's a he's enlighten
[5:10] us to something that's inherent in every
[5:12] single person
[5:14] and it's a mark of humanity uh we are
[5:17] driven as humans to explain our
[5:18] existence
[5:20] with with respect to animal
[5:22] uh life and there's something i was uh
[5:24] pondering recently or had learned
[5:26] recently about animals and and and how
[5:28] that they have no
[5:29] certain senses and things that they
[5:31] don't feel like they have to justify and
[5:32] rationalize and they just can do what
[5:34] they're made to do
[5:35] where with humans we have to explain our
[5:37] existence we have to make sense of
[5:39] things
[5:40] if something goes flying through the air
[5:42] it may startle an animal but the animal
[5:45] doesn't have this sense of well where
[5:47] did it come from and where did it land
[5:48] and why was it doing that and what is it
[5:50] doing here
[5:51] but but we have to make sense of things
[5:54] and in phoenix i think it's on a cycle
[5:55] where every year we have to explain the
[5:57] phoenix lights and everyone wonders what
[5:59] are they doing there how did they get
[6:00] there what is this we're being invaded
[6:02] by aliens and that's just just our human
[6:04] nature
[6:05] to try to attribute meaning to things
[6:07] and and something and i'm not i'm not
[6:09] trying to
[6:10] i'm not i'm just making observations and
[6:12] i want you to think i'm trying to put
[6:13] any kind of spin on it but uh some very
[6:16] innocuous things can happen but we'll
[6:17] try to attribute meaning to it like oh
[6:19] hey did you hear that you know brother
[6:21] aaron used exactly 777 words in his
[6:24] prayer
[6:25] and try to attribute some meaning to it
[6:27] and it's like well no that was just luck
[6:29] you know right i mean
[6:30] we're just reaching for something
[6:31] there's times where we're really trying
[6:33] to attribute meaning and assign uh some
[6:35] purpose to things
[6:37] and in doing so
[6:39] we tried to this is for us personally i
[6:41] think that we're always in a position of
[6:44] uh in some way or another one of these
[6:45] three different phases we're either
[6:47] trying to find meaning and purpose in
[6:48] what we've experienced
[6:50] meaning and what we're going through now
[6:52] or in some ways meaning in what we're
[6:54] pursuing
[6:56] and we're doing that so that it kind of
[6:57] gives purpose to what's happened what's
[7:00] happening and what will happen so we can
[7:02] find some value in it
[7:04] and
[7:05] this is i want to say that that's with
[7:07] everything
[7:08] and then victor franco has made this
[7:11] it's been attributed to him
[7:13] and and i don't know that he makes the
[7:14] exact statement in his writings but it's
[7:17] been attributed to him and i think it is
[7:18] an accurate summary of some of the
[7:20] things he wrote that despair is
[7:22] suffering without meaning
[7:25] so when when you suffer and we
[7:28] understand that we're taught that you
[7:29] suffer according to the will of god and
[7:31] that we we suffer and god does it all
[7:33] with a purpose and so as christians
[7:35] we're we're
[7:37] very aware how that god has a purpose to
[7:39] our suffering and that suffering is to
[7:41] make us perfect
[7:42] and that there is through suffering god
[7:44] has found no better way to perfect our
[7:46] character than suffering
[7:48] and and and so we we have these things
[7:50] in our minds and they seem very relevant
[7:51] to us
[7:53] and and it's easier said than done
[7:55] right
[7:56] it's really easy to tell our neighbors
[7:58] in the apartment next store that when
[8:00] they're really going through it god's
[8:01] just perfecting your character
[8:03] and then when we're going through it we
[8:05] just lose all character
[8:07] i don't know it just doesn't make sense
[8:10] but yet we have some some understanding
[8:12] of the divine purpose of god as
[8:13] christians
[8:14] but
[8:15] so we so to despair would be to suffer
[8:18] without there being any value in your
[8:20] suffering or out without any meaning in
[8:22] your suffering
[8:24] so
[8:25] you have what he posits is that you have
[8:27] a choice then whatever you're going
[8:28] through as this free moral agent by free
[8:30] will you can choose to to have a meaning
[8:33] and you can
[8:34] you can choose to uh see that there's
[8:37] some meaning and value and even what
[8:39] you're suffering
[8:41] but now i want to point out that with
[8:43] solomon and this is the part that seems
[8:45] more remarkable to me
[8:47] solomon's observations are even more
[8:49] staggering because you tell someone
[8:50] who's suffering and if they could
[8:51] somehow find in their suffering meaning
[8:54] then it's not despair but solomon's
[8:57] observations are in light of even all of
[8:59] his indulgences
[9:01] you continue to read chapter two and all
[9:03] the things he has and everything he
[9:05] enjoys and solomon's not lamenting as
[9:07] job was on the ash sheep solomon's
[9:09] saying i've got everything i've got
[9:10] entertainments i've got food i've got
[9:12] women i've got wine i've got everything
[9:13] i would want he's still saying through
[9:15] that there's no fulfillment
[9:19] and it would be easy to understand um
[9:21] job writing these things it would be
[9:23] easy to understand victor frankel and
[9:25] his experience saying ah life is
[9:26] frustrating life is without meaning and
[9:29] and bad things happen to good people
[9:31] and to despair to some extent but here's
[9:34] solomon
[9:35] who has
[9:37] so many natural things tangible things
[9:39] at his disposal and he's saying hey they
[9:41] don't bring me any fulfillment
[9:44] and he continues in verse 14
[9:46] ecclesiastes 1 14. i've seen all the
[9:48] works that are done under the sun and
[9:49] behold all is vanity and vexation of
[9:52] spirit
[9:54] means it's a
[9:56] it specifically speaks of no
[9:57] satisfaction or fulfillment there's a
[9:59] striving there's a longing i'm not
[10:01] getting anything out of it
[10:03] continues in chapter 2 verse 17
[10:04] therefore i hated life
[10:07] you could
[10:09] people who suffer extensively and
[10:12] endure injustices and things happen
[10:16] that are unexplainable we talk about
[10:17] attributing meaning and given
[10:19] explanation there's people that go
[10:20] through things
[10:21] and if we didn't have the word of god
[10:22] we'd be at a loss to explain it if we
[10:25] didn't have the word of god saying god
[10:26] does all things for a purpose and that
[10:28] these things strengthen us and god can
[10:30] use it you can be in a better position
[10:31] to help somebody else if we didn't have
[10:32] the word of god we'd just be like i
[10:34] don't know what to say
[10:36] i think in my family in flagstaff and
[10:38] some of the things that they've endured
[10:39] and if we didn't have the word of god as
[10:41] a typos and it's evident that they do
[10:43] and the way that they conduct themselves
[10:44] to their tremendous losses in their
[10:46] family but without the word of god i
[10:48] don't know what to say
[10:50] and you would understand why some would
[10:52] hate life
[10:53] this is solomon exercise solomon kind of
[10:56] expressing these things to us and again
[10:57] i'm glad he didn't stop
[10:59] posting after chapter two i'm glad he
[11:01] continued to write until he got to the
[11:03] end
[11:04] but he says therefore i hated life
[11:06] because the work that is wrought under
[11:08] the sun
[11:09] is grievous unto me for all is vanity
[11:11] and vexation there it is again vexation
[11:13] of spirit to be grievous it's
[11:14] distressing it's injurious everything
[11:16] solomon yeah everything what about those
[11:18] nice chariots that what about all the
[11:20] nice food that what about all the nice
[11:22] houses that what about the cedar's 11 on
[11:24] that everything the ointments the
[11:25] perfumes everything it's all vexing
[11:32] and this is man at his best
[11:35] this is the man of his riches this is
[11:36] the wisest man one of the richest most
[11:39] wise men and there's this a twirling
[11:42] this dissatisfaction and this disconnect
[11:45] now
[11:46] i know this is going to be a tremendous
[11:48] leap and i didn't do the math but i want
[11:49] to go from
[11:50] solomon
[11:51] in those days
[11:54] uh live and large
[11:56] and come all the way up to the time
[11:58] we're at now
[12:00] and there's not a solomon on earth
[12:03] right
[12:04] someone who would let's say in in the
[12:05] literal sense a real sense that there's
[12:07] no king in jerusalem there's no son of
[12:09] david
[12:10] and someone endued with the wisdom that
[12:12] he had and the the riches that he had
[12:14] and here is one that certainly if if
[12:16] money could buy you something and buy
[12:18] you relief and through wisdom you could
[12:20] find meaning
[12:21] and make sense of life then and solomon
[12:23] would have it then how worse off is
[12:26] mankind today than solomon was in his
[12:29] day
[12:30] i think i got you thinking
[12:32] and brother brandon makes this statement
[12:34] in the message communion one of the very
[12:35] last things he's going to share with us
[12:37] and it was so important for him to zero
[12:39] in on this he says as we and again i'm
[12:41] not providing these with you so you can
[12:43] just try to stay very open in your
[12:44] hearts and focused on what i'm saying
[12:46] so the lord could speak to it and he
[12:48] says we also can look around and see
[12:50] that the way that the human mind is
[12:53] leaving the people
[12:56] we might say losing their minds
[12:59] he says the human mind is leaving the
[13:01] people
[13:02] there is this
[13:05] loosening of wits and there's this
[13:08] watering down of rationale
[13:11] and you could you could
[13:12] you could try to
[13:14] figure it out from
[13:17] the standpoint of what's the cause and
[13:19] what has done this
[13:21] and and you can even look at societies
[13:23] at large that were non-christian and you
[13:25] could look at um the pervading of
[13:27] christianity and the imperialism that
[13:29] spread the gospel and you could try to
[13:31] just figure out some
[13:33] uh curve and how did this happen and how
[13:35] did mankind come to this place and
[13:38] and i know we often make the statement
[13:41] that things are worse now and it's never
[13:42] been this way but
[13:44] i mean man there's been a lot of insane
[13:46] people that have lived and they've done
[13:48] a lot of awful things it's not like just
[13:51] all of a sudden in in the in in the
[13:53] 1900s or the two
[13:55] 2000s that they figured out how to sin
[13:58] and commit evil
[13:59] but what you're finding
[14:01] which maybe could be isolated on a
[14:03] smaller scale
[14:05] and could be endemic within the catholic
[14:07] church and their crusades and the
[14:09] genocides that were accomplished and
[14:11] then the evils that are done in other
[14:13] societies and other cultures throughout
[14:16] time and history it just seems as if
[14:18] this madness that was within mankind on
[14:21] a certain level to perpetuate great
[14:22] harms against people that were weaker
[14:24] than them it just keeps getting sewn
[14:26] into nature to where now mankind all of
[14:29] mankind is losing their mind
[14:32] and it might
[14:35] and i appreciate the fact that on a
[14:36] wednesday night i'm speaking to those
[14:38] who can draw from such the rich teaching
[14:40] of the message of the hour to know that
[14:42] brother branham's talking about the
[14:43] world's fallen apart and and things are
[14:45] insane and all the things that are out
[14:47] of control
[14:48] and and i think it would be healthy for
[14:50] us to recognize if you have the baptism
[14:53] of the holy ghost
[14:54] then you are you have access to a right
[14:57] mind
[14:58] that other people don't have
[15:01] and i mean that and if it seems to be
[15:02] somewhat exclusive i i we could just
[15:05] take it right down to the to the word of
[15:07] god paul said if our gospel be hid it's
[15:08] hit to them that are lost
[15:10] well that's rough
[15:13] he's just saying if you don't see it
[15:14] you're lost and i'm saying that those
[15:16] who have the baptism of the holy ghost
[15:19] they have access to a mind a thinking a
[15:21] rationale a reasoning a stability that
[15:24] the rest of the world doesn't have and
[15:25] i'm not talking about people who are
[15:27] a murderous and vile and filthy
[15:30] perverted people that seem to be very
[15:31] sane and rational do not have the
[15:33] benefit of the wisdom that you have in
[15:36] the mind of christ through the new birth
[15:38] so it says the human mind is leaving the
[15:40] people he says we can't stay too much
[15:43] longer
[15:45] we'd be in a complete
[15:46] insane institution the whole world would
[15:49] be
[15:51] he says so we're at the end time
[15:53] and could it be that we haven't arrived
[15:55] to where the whole world has become an
[15:56] insane institution
[15:59] and we are unreasonably locked up in it
[16:01] and that's what the rapture is all about
[16:02] is letting the same people escape the
[16:04] insane asylum
[16:07] have you ever thought about how awful it
[16:08] would be if someone said hey that
[16:09] person's crazy and so they just went
[16:11] locked you know took you and threw you
[16:13] in and uh
[16:14] and uh put you know
[16:16] had to come under psychiatric care and
[16:17] they're just kind of like are you crazy
[16:19] no no i'm not crazy i don't know why i'm
[16:21] in here and the more upset you get the
[16:23] fact that they think you're crazy the
[16:25] crazier you look
[16:27] right i think this guy's crazy
[16:29] and the more you adamantly protest that
[16:31] you're not crazy the more more they're
[16:32] going to believe that you are they'd be
[16:34] kind of a scary situation but in one
[16:36] sense as he says hey we can't stay too
[16:38] much longer december 12 1964 we'd be in
[16:41] a complete insane institution the world
[16:43] would be an insane institution have we
[16:46] arrived at the time when those without
[16:48] the baptismal holy ghost are
[16:51] scripturally insane
[16:53] the decency has been lost integrity is
[16:55] honesty everything's turned upside down
[16:57] things don't make sense anymore
[17:01] so with this is my foundation
[17:04] uh brother john if you want to share
[17:05] this slide this is the last
[17:07] slide i want to share just so that you
[17:08] can get the title down but i want to
[17:10] start what i i'm using this this
[17:12] nomenclature in a way that i start in
[17:15] the segment so i don't know if it's
[17:16] going to be a series and i'll pick it up
[17:18] next wednesday kind of like kids eat
[17:20] free how many enjoyed last wednesday
[17:21] kids eat free all right a lot of hands
[17:23] those who aren't here kids eat free
[17:26] and and we used that was it like a
[17:28] segment and we did an installment on
[17:29] digging for gold
[17:31] i i want to do the same thing because i
[17:33] don't feel necessarily like i just want
[17:34] to pick this up every service but
[17:35] something i feel that we ought to
[17:37] revisit
[17:38] and so the the thought is character
[17:40] disorders
[17:42] and to tonight i want to just begin
[17:45] and i'm just going to touch on it just
[17:46] point to it say hey think about this
[17:48] anti-spiritual personality disorder
[17:51] and so if you want to
[17:53] if you'd want to write it out as a title
[17:55] you could say this is the first in a
[17:57] series or segments
[17:58] of character disorders and an
[18:00] anti-spiritual personality disorder
[18:03] as the title
[18:06] he's still with me
[18:09] all right because this is where i need
[18:10] you to be very very focused
[18:13] and and thank you brother john for using
[18:15] that i would i just if you've got that
[18:17] down if you need anything from me just
[18:18] let me know and i'll provide um some of
[18:21] these statements to your scriptures i'm
[18:23] going to give some background
[18:25] just to help you to
[18:26] understand how i've arrived at this and
[18:29] some of you may have some background
[18:30] already to realize what this might
[18:32] relate to
[18:33] but there is what is called the
[18:35] diagnostic and statistical manual of
[18:37] mental disorders
[18:39] it's in its fifth edition now released
[18:41] by the american
[18:43] psychiatric association
[18:45] and uh
[18:47] i think is it the uh
[18:49] the dsm 5-5 i think is what they call it
[18:53] and in this when they released it in
[18:54] 2013 i think there's been some recent
[18:56] updates but i don't know how they codify
[18:58] it or how they make it official but
[19:00] there's 157 different diagnoses
[19:03] in this uh manual it's actually less
[19:06] than what they had before there's been
[19:08] some consolidation and some
[19:09] subcategories i believe but if you go
[19:11] through the list which i have
[19:14] there's a lot of a lot of disorders that
[19:16] they relate to
[19:18] um substance abuse
[19:20] uh substance
[19:22] in toxic intoxication from substances or
[19:25] even some uh
[19:27] some things things that are induced so
[19:29] abuse intoxication or even something
[19:31] that's induced by a substance and this
[19:33] is a number of different mental uh
[19:36] disorders that they attribute to some
[19:37] substance that is cause you to think
[19:39] differently alcohol and cocaine and
[19:42] there's a lot of different things that
[19:43] they reference in this so that's part of
[19:45] the 157 different uh diagnoses and then
[19:47] there's some others that relate
[19:49] specifically to
[19:51] trauma or physical things that happen to
[19:53] a person that cause them to think a
[19:54] certain way
[19:55] and and then also certain infections or
[19:58] diseases that might cause a mental
[20:00] process or way to think and i just
[20:02] mentioned that so that we could think
[20:03] very broadly at first that this is
[20:05] science remember this is me just saying
[20:07] what science is saying
[20:09] i'm not wanting to write this down as
[20:11] this is the gospel there's 157 and again
[20:14] try to attribute meaning there's a one
[20:16] there's a five there's a seven one god
[20:18] five's grace it look come on
[20:21] don't don't do that
[20:24] but there is uh
[20:26] it's just so you could think that
[20:27] there's this broad scope of man humanity
[20:30] i think i want to come back to this at
[20:31] the end so lord help me to do so man is
[20:34] trying to make sense of things
[20:35] you know this person these people act
[20:37] this way these people like this way and
[20:38] they have this
[20:39] data that they're accumulating over over
[20:41] centuries now in a sense and and they're
[20:43] saying well people act this way we put
[20:45] them in this category they're just
[20:46] trying to make sense of human behavior
[20:48] and it's really the best that science
[20:50] can do
[20:51] now in this 157 different mental
[20:54] disorders there's 10 specific
[20:56] personality disorders
[20:58] and don't get nervous we're not doing
[21:00] any diagnosing we're not going to pass
[21:02] out any quizzes we're not going to have
[21:03] a breakout session
[21:05] we have psychiatrists standing by right
[21:07] now
[21:11] and these personality disorders are
[21:12] divided into three different clusters
[21:14] again this is just me giving you
[21:15] background just so i feel like i can
[21:17] speak to you about this in a way that's
[21:19] spiritual and you understand where i'm
[21:20] coming from it's an abc cluster
[21:23] uh
[21:24] the a's and the c's we won't think about
[21:26] tonight i don't know if i'll ever
[21:27] mention them there may be the even more
[21:29] rare
[21:30] diagnoses and things very specific but
[21:33] there's a cluster called the cluster b
[21:35] personality disorders and now i'm going
[21:36] to summarize it this way they're
[21:38] characterized by impulsive
[21:40] self-destructive emotional behavior
[21:43] so it's impulsive self-destructive
[21:44] emotional behavior
[21:46] and i will say that even from a clinical
[21:48] standpoint
[21:49] actual
[21:50] clinical diagnoses of these things are
[21:52] rare and i say rare uh i i think even
[21:55] with respect to these 10 specific
[21:57] personality disorders it's less than two
[21:58] percent so can we all just start
[22:00] relaxing a little bit like
[22:02] that this is not not you getting
[22:04] discovered fine finding out you have a
[22:05] personality disorder
[22:07] we knew that already
[22:10] but
[22:11] it's impulsive self-destructive
[22:12] emotional behavior and sometimes
[22:14] incomprehensible interactions with
[22:16] others and then all of a sudden just got
[22:18] real
[22:19] incomprehensible interactions with
[22:21] others now this is a personality
[22:23] disorder this is clinical this is more
[22:25] scientific this is not me trying to
[22:27] instill in you some understanding when
[22:28] it comes to the word of god but let's
[22:30] just use this as a basis as a reference
[22:32] so now personality since we're talking
[22:34] about personality disorders and we're
[22:35] using the phrase anti-spiritual
[22:37] personality disorder i'm wanting us to
[22:39] think about a personality disorder
[22:40] personalities the individual differences
[22:42] in characteristic patterns of thinking
[22:44] feeling and behaving
[22:46] see there's individual differences this
[22:48] is individual specific to the individual
[22:50] this is subjective
[22:51] uh
[22:52] this is to you you're uh to who you are
[22:55] as a person you're thinking you're
[22:56] feeling and behaving
[22:58] and the way that they uh the even the
[23:00] the psychiatrist would look at it
[23:02] is that it's a kind of a coming together
[23:04] various parts that make a whole person
[23:06] so personality is it's recognizing
[23:08] different things work together to make a
[23:10] personality and there's different ways
[23:12] that they study it from different
[23:14] perspectives but it's just different
[23:15] characteristics of thinking feeling and
[23:18] behaving
[23:20] and now on personality brother baron
[23:21] says you cannot be a person without
[23:23] being a personality
[23:25] so if you are a person you you have a
[23:27] personality and if you are a personality
[23:29] you are one personality to yourself you
[23:31] are a separate individual being
[23:33] so personality relates to an individual
[23:36] there's something i i wanted to say very
[23:38] unique about being an individual but
[23:40] that's kind of like stating the obvious
[23:41] but
[23:42] uh when you look at the word of god and
[23:44] how the revelation the new birth is a
[23:46] personal revelation of jesus christ or
[23:48] revelation jesus christ personally to
[23:50] you there's something very beautiful
[23:52] about the person about the individual
[23:54] that that god does not want to sacrifice
[23:57] in in the whole so we think about the
[23:59] bride of jesus christ the bride of jesus
[24:01] christ your identity and recognizing who
[24:03] you are and becoming the
[24:05] the the overcomer
[24:08] and the powerhouse of god's spirit
[24:10] that's for you individually
[24:12] and it ought not to be lost in the
[24:14] church movement or the body movement or
[24:15] the bride movement it's for you
[24:17] individually
[24:19] and there should be some personal
[24:20] ownership of it to where it's like
[24:22] everything
[24:23] everything around me
[24:25] god would desire that these things that
[24:27] are being achieved around me would have
[24:28] some impact in me individually that i
[24:30] could come to the place that god wants
[24:32] me to be
[24:33] and not just settle for a while i guess
[24:35] it's not for me i guess it's not for me
[24:36] it's guess it's not for me and just
[24:38] rejoicing if it's for everybody else but
[24:40] there's got to be something inside of
[24:42] you
[24:42] that recognizes god has something for
[24:45] you and i want it
[24:47] and he wants to give it to you
[24:49] and so he's saying you cannot be a
[24:50] person without being a personality
[24:53] then the most
[24:55] uh
[24:56] frequent place you come across brother
[24:58] i'm talking about personality or i say
[24:59] frequent but most pronounced is when he
[25:02] refers to the godhead
[25:03] and in the church age book he's writing
[25:05] in chapter eight he says indeed the
[25:06] godhead is not three per a a
[25:08] three-person god with one personality if
[25:11] it takes a personality personality to
[25:14] make a person
[25:15] if there's one personality there is but
[25:17] one person
[25:19] so your personality is who you are
[25:22] can we just think about that for a
[25:23] moment when the bride recognizes
[25:25] who she is is kind of the wording we use
[25:27] and what she is and what she stands for
[25:30] it's who she is as a person
[25:32] what her personality is it relates to
[25:33] the individual recognizing who i am as a
[25:36] person and there's a personality a
[25:39] personality makes a person
[25:42] and and so that's what we're thinking
[25:43] about when we think about personality it
[25:45] has this
[25:46] it may have some scientific clinical
[25:48] application but i'm a person you're a
[25:51] person we are we all have a personality
[25:53] that's what makes a person
[25:55] and it's precious in the eyes of god
[25:57] it's something he watches out over
[25:59] it's something i believe has been stated
[26:01] before
[26:02] that you notice that god
[26:04] uses the spirit of elijah five times
[26:08] there's something about that personality
[26:11] there's something about that nature and
[26:12] those characteristics the way of
[26:14] thinking feeling and behaving that god
[26:15] likes where he would use it five times
[26:20] it has to do with personality
[26:22] so if it's a personality disorder
[26:25] a disorder is a group of symptoms
[26:28] involving abnormal behaviors or
[26:30] psychological conditions
[26:33] so disorder they're looking at a group
[26:35] of
[26:36] symptoms
[26:37] that relate even to abnormal behavior
[26:40] or some
[26:42] condition of the mind the thinking that
[26:44] would be a disorder another way to
[26:45] describe a disorder would be some sort
[26:47] of intense distress persistent or
[26:49] intense distress if you're going through
[26:51] in some sort of moment where there's
[26:52] this intense distress uh from a clinical
[26:55] standpoint so that's a they could
[26:56] diagnose that as some disorder because
[26:58] it's something very intense or
[27:00] persistent
[27:01] or a disorder can be described as a
[27:03] disruption of the psych
[27:06] physiological functioning so it's
[27:08] something in the mind
[27:10] the way the mind's working the mind the
[27:11] way some interruption i said well he's
[27:12] not thinking properly he's not acting
[27:14] properly
[27:15] and i don't even know if this is
[27:17] something that's i guess it didn't
[27:19] memorize the list of 157
[27:21] things but they've they recognize that
[27:23] there's even these what they call
[27:25] disorders where people
[27:26] something happens and they clearly begin
[27:29] to behave in an abnormal way
[27:31] inconsistent with even their own pattern
[27:33] of behavior or something that would not
[27:34] even be socially acceptable and while
[27:36] they're acting that way they recognize
[27:38] something's not clicking in their minds
[27:41] and they're and they're behaving
[27:42] inconsistent with what would be right
[27:44] what would be acceptable and so these
[27:46] are things that they would call a
[27:47] disorder
[27:49] now this i'm just giving you background
[27:51] and i appreciate just the open spirit
[27:53] tonight to share these things i
[27:55] i realized too that perhaps think these
[27:57] are things i've studied for years
[28:00] and felt there's such a important
[28:02] important things to talk about because
[28:04] listen the world's talking about all
[28:05] time
[28:06] right
[28:08] how many of us had things said about us
[28:09] labels put on us categories were put
[28:11] into things we're processing things
[28:13] we're thinking about trying to make
[28:14] sense of our lives and all we have is
[28:16] the dsm-5 to grab grab
[28:18] to make sense of life and what i'm
[28:20] wanting to do by this is let you know
[28:21] god knows better than they do
[28:24] that's what i want you to reckon this
[28:25] god knows better than they do and i'm
[28:27] wanting to i realized i'm going to run
[28:29] out of time tonight but if i could say
[28:30] it now i'll have maybe a piece if i have
[28:32] to leave off short
[28:34] is
[28:35] that the world uses a language and
[28:37] things are said and there's a common
[28:38] vernacular that's used today uh whether
[28:41] we talk about gaslighting or triggered
[28:43] and social justice and cancel culture
[28:45] and all these phrases that are used and
[28:47] i want you to realize that by the word
[28:48] of god we can bring it back to what it
[28:50] really is
[28:52] and find the right approach
[28:56] because solomon and his lamenting
[28:58] recognize there's nothing new under the
[28:59] side
[29:01] and nor is there today anything new
[29:03] that god's word hasn't already uncovered
[29:05] or spoke to or can address
[29:08] so that with that background of kind of
[29:11] the academic scientific stuff and if you
[29:12] didn't get anything out of it i hope you
[29:14] know that's fine
[29:16] you're just listening to me kind of walk
[29:18] you through how god has dealt with my
[29:20] heart
[29:21] and so this is where kind of
[29:23] things got quickened to me here recently
[29:25] as i learned of a
[29:27] kind of a consistent misunderstanding of
[29:30] the anti-social personality disorder or
[29:32] even the phrase that someone is
[29:34] anti-social and it might be used in
[29:36] describing a psychopath or
[29:38] um someone's a sociopath they might use
[29:41] this phrase they're anti-social how many
[29:43] have heard that before
[29:44] anti-social
[29:46] now
[29:48] when we think anti-social and and i
[29:50] recognize i think that this exists
[29:53] this understanding exists to a very
[29:54] large degree with most people that
[29:56] anti-social means they don't like to
[29:58] socially interact
[30:00] or that anti-social means they're a
[30:02] loner
[30:03] or they're an introvert and so
[30:05] uh this is this is kind of what we think
[30:07] anti-social is but that's not what
[30:09] anti-social is at all
[30:11] and this is where i i hope it kind of
[30:13] starts to get interesting
[30:15] we think a person if they're in this
[30:17] particular category of a narcissist or
[30:19] whatever and they have these anti-social
[30:21] personalities we're thinking oh they're
[30:22] just alone or they keep to themselves
[30:23] they're a hermit they're quiet no to be
[30:26] anti-social is not that at all
[30:30] but this is a way that i
[30:32] uh it was phrased and it caught my
[30:34] attention anti-social personality
[30:36] disorder
[30:38] they have a disregard for laws norms and
[30:40] rules of society
[30:45] and they they believe that these rules
[30:47] don't apply to them
[30:51] and it was put in this way that someone
[30:53] who has an anti-social uh personality
[30:56] disorder or is antisocial is a part of
[30:58] some other uh pattern of behavior
[31:01] it's they're not it's not that they
[31:03] don't socialize sometimes they are the
[31:04] most social
[31:06] sometimes they can be the most
[31:07] charismatic or engaging it's not that
[31:09] the hermit in the corner they don't have
[31:11] don't have a way of communicating they
[31:12] don't have a way of engaging they don't
[31:14] have a way of getting you excited or
[31:15] talking to you but the what makes them
[31:17] anti-social is they disregard laws they
[31:20] disregard the rules of society and they
[31:23] they don't think they apply to them so
[31:25] they think they can do things
[31:27] and they can get away with it or it
[31:29] doesn't matter it doesn't apply to them
[31:32] now i think you're really getting you
[31:33] can really start to think and this is
[31:34] where i thought of a spiritual
[31:36] application of this
[31:38] i thought of like a
[31:39] the word view of this i thought my in
[31:41] the sense that some people
[31:43] are not anti-social and that the
[31:45] anti-social person can be very social
[31:48] but the anti-part is they don't regard
[31:50] what the actual rules of being social
[31:52] are society it's anti-society they can
[31:55] be very involved in society but they're
[31:57] actually working against what the norms
[32:00] and expectations and rules are of
[32:01] society now think of it in a spiritual
[32:03] sense
[32:04] there's a lot of people when we think
[32:06] anti-spiritual we think oh they're
[32:08] carnal they're not spiritual they're not
[32:09] religious but on the contrary someone
[32:12] who's anti-spiritual can come off as
[32:14] very spiritual very engaging but they're
[32:17] not operating according to what the
[32:19] norms of the capital s spirit
[32:21] spirit is
[32:23] singular spirit
[32:25] all right i just gave you it all there
[32:27] that was
[32:28] now you know what i'm going to be
[32:29] amplifying now for the next several
[32:31] minutes
[32:32] now let me just read to you
[32:35] a very uh the
[32:38] the definition
[32:40] of the anti-social personality disorder
[32:44] we kind of touched on personality
[32:45] disorder now the anti-social aspect the
[32:48] presence of a chronic pervasive
[32:50] disposition to disregard violate or
[32:53] disregard and violate the rights of
[32:54] others
[32:57] we're kind of piggybacking a lot of
[32:59] momentum we have on some of the things
[33:00] we've ministered for some time now a
[33:02] chronic or pervasive disposition to
[33:04] disregard or violate the rights of
[33:06] others that's someone who's anti-social
[33:09] manifestations include repeated
[33:10] violations of the law exploitation of
[33:13] others deceitfulness impulsivity
[33:15] aggressiveness reckless disregard for
[33:17] the safety of self and others and
[33:19] irresponsibility accompanied by a lack
[33:21] of guilt remorse and empathy
[33:24] you know i don't think we have to try
[33:25] hard to see the the the biblical
[33:27] characteristics being brought out
[33:30] i don't think we'd have to try hard to
[33:32] be able to flip through the word of god
[33:34] that's that's in the word of god that's
[33:35] in the word of god a lack of guilt a
[33:37] lack of remorse a lack of empathy
[33:40] the disregard for the safety of others
[33:42] irresponsibility someone who is exploits
[33:45] others deceitful impulsive
[33:47] and repeated violations of the law
[33:50] and these are things that we say are
[33:52] often said with a psychopathic
[33:53] personality or even a sociopathic
[33:54] personality some will bring a
[33:56] distinction between the two but there's
[33:57] a lot of overlap
[33:59] and they say about this is what i
[34:01] thought was very interesting when it
[34:02] comes to the anti-social personality
[34:04] sorts one of the most researched
[34:06] disorders that there are there are today
[34:08] one of the most researched disorders and
[34:10] they say the most difficult to treat
[34:13] they don't know how to treat it
[34:16] well if you just pick up another manual
[34:19] right
[34:20] their manual well we can we can diagnose
[34:23] it all day long but they don't know how
[34:24] to treat it
[34:26] because i think at times they're just
[34:27] not willing to consider the cause
[34:30] so this was this is kind of my thought
[34:32] is it i'm just you're walking it's very
[34:33] unique service for me i'm just kind of
[34:35] walking you through my thought process
[34:36] as god has done with my heart
[34:38] there are natural even if we look at
[34:40] character disorders specifically there
[34:42] are natural and spiritual applications
[34:46] of these principles
[34:48] and i'll say both in the natural and
[34:50] spiritual the word is for both
[34:53] and they're not in natural there's
[34:54] actual natural circumstances uh there
[34:57] can be actual mental conditions that
[34:58] need healing there can be actual uh
[35:01] disorders or disruptions or patterns of
[35:03] behaviors infections addictions all
[35:05] these things that need attention
[35:07] that need deliverance that need to be
[35:08] dealt with and i believe the word of god
[35:10] does so
[35:13] and then there's the spiritual the
[35:14] spiritual side to it this is the part i
[35:16] think may be hard for me to
[35:18] express
[35:19] even as
[35:20] because i want to be very i want to be
[35:22] very careful with how i express it i
[35:24] want you to be able to have some
[35:25] understanding in your hearts
[35:27] how god would want to make this
[35:29] applicable for you
[35:31] but
[35:31] maybe making kind of a a another side of
[35:34] this spiritual side there's issues that
[35:36] relate to the expression of christian
[35:39] character
[35:40] that could be used in similar terms
[35:43] that there's there's a way that we ought
[35:44] to be living walking in the spirit the
[35:46] fruits of the spirit conducting
[35:48] ourselves in the nature and the
[35:49] personality of jesus christ there's
[35:51] something about the way that we ought to
[35:52] be living and expressing christian
[35:53] character to where we could borrow from
[35:56] some of these uh natural things
[35:59] just like you could have um a spiritual
[36:01] amnesia
[36:03] right we recognize there's a spiritual
[36:05] amnesia where somebody doesn't recognize
[36:07] who they are and it's that we see this
[36:08] type in the natural someone has a head
[36:10] trauma they have some sickness and they
[36:11] forget their past they forget who they
[36:13] are there's a spiritual side of it i'm
[36:15] looking at this in the same sense there
[36:16] can be a spiritual amnesia that there's
[36:18] a spiritual application of some of these
[36:20] disorders and i'm just using that
[36:21] language to use
[36:23] things that are maybe familiar to us
[36:25] today to get our attention to what the
[36:27] word of god is supposed to produce in
[36:29] our lives
[36:31] and so my inspiration was when i heard
[36:33] this with spiritual disorders
[36:35] when i thought of how
[36:36] in the context this to be anti-social
[36:38] didn't mean you were withdrawn or you're
[36:40] an introvert it just meant you didn't
[36:42] operate according to the rules and the
[36:44] laws and you violated things
[36:46] and it was this kind of aggression
[36:48] against what was expected and what was
[36:50] right immediately thought oh they're
[36:51] spiritual disorders
[36:55] and i thought there's types of these
[36:56] things in the word of god and so i would
[36:59] even say that maybe we could ask
[37:00] ourselves are there types of these
[37:02] things in the word of god
[37:04] and to this specifically this is what's
[37:06] been a very beautiful study for me
[37:07] personally
[37:08] is actually identifying these disorders
[37:11] in the bible
[37:14] you ever thought about that in terms of
[37:15] the things we hear today and well this
[37:17] person has you know they need to have
[37:19] their appendix removed and you flip
[37:20] through the bible and you try to find
[37:22] where they talk about someone with an
[37:23] inflamed appendix or did anybody ever
[37:25] have an ingrown toenail or did anybody
[37:27] have this and where's the cancer in the
[37:28] bible and you try to find things and
[37:30] there's certain things we wonder we have
[37:32] a language today in a way we describe
[37:34] things today even ways that are recorded
[37:36] for us in the tape lines of all this
[37:38] diseases and situations that brother
[37:40] branham faced and the terms that he uses
[37:42] to address these spirits and you think
[37:44] mike what what about today
[37:47] that the diseases we have the sicknesses
[37:49] we have the diagnosis we have the
[37:50] terminologies we use and you can go back
[37:53] in in the bible and read these stories
[37:55] and find
[37:57] characteristics and and the nature of
[37:59] people and say oh that's the classic
[38:01] case of this
[38:03] matter of fact when i originally was
[38:04] going to preach this last year is going
[38:05] to be don't be a narcissist
[38:08] that was going to be my title don't be a
[38:09] narcissist
[38:11] because you can find it in the word of
[38:12] god
[38:13] the bible is basically telling you you
[38:15] know don't be a narcissist don't be rude
[38:17] don't be insensitive
[38:19] and so i started thinking about
[38:21] these characteristics
[38:24] in terms of the scripture
[38:27] the fruits of the spirit
[38:29] are we able to identify
[38:31] in the bible people that today science
[38:34] would say had some diagnosable mental
[38:38] disorder
[38:39] like where you think you speak of legion
[38:42] and we recognize that he is possessed
[38:44] with devils
[38:46] and to a to
[38:48] a practitioner they might look at him
[38:50] and say well he has this problem this
[38:52] problem this problem we never call it a
[38:53] devil they'd never call it a demon this
[38:55] problem this problem this probably had
[38:56] this in his past these things have
[38:57] happened and then when they happen upon
[38:59] him later on they and they see him
[39:01] dressed and clothed and eating they
[39:03] would say
[39:04] he's in his right mind just as they did
[39:06] in the scripture
[39:08] they say well he's no longer he's no
[39:10] longer acting under these impulses he's
[39:12] no longer he's actually been cured or
[39:14] this is something that's intermittent or
[39:15] something that comes and go and this
[39:17] would be something that they a
[39:18] practitioner today would begin to look
[39:20] at things in the scripture and say oh
[39:21] this is a this is a case of this and you
[39:23] start looking at some of the personality
[39:25] types in the bible and there's some
[39:26] really rough characters
[39:30] and then it crystallized to me as i was
[39:31] thinking how how do i express this how
[39:33] do i
[39:34] share the share this to
[39:36] the people
[39:38] and it just struck me that
[39:40] in the context of our crystallize in the
[39:43] sense of our birth and our character
[39:45] that by natural birth
[39:47] we are endured with certain inherent
[39:49] inherited characteristics
[39:51] and there's a lot of science that says
[39:53] your personality is dictated by your
[39:56] genes
[39:58] by what you inherit from your parents
[40:00] and and and we could say that we
[40:02] recognize that there ha there's there's
[40:04] certainly a truth to that
[40:06] and then kind of your characters
[40:07] developed in that in the environment so
[40:10] it's sort of this expression within
[40:11] these parameters of who i'm going to be
[40:13] and what i'm going to become
[40:15] and then a person as they grow they that
[40:17] you know their character this is what
[40:19] they are this is how they live
[40:22] and and so i see that in a spiritual
[40:24] sense our birth and our character
[40:27] and so
[40:28] and and i want to say this that i
[40:30] believe the bible
[40:32] the bible and i'm not going to have time
[40:34] to get to some of these scriptures the
[40:35] bible addresses the human condition and
[40:37] by human condition the weakness of the
[40:39] mind the susceptibility to spirits the
[40:42] the tendency to think negative and the
[40:44] the the
[40:45] uh propensity to perceive things in a
[40:48] way that's not true the bible's telling
[40:49] us that how deceitful the heart is and
[40:52] it's it's even dividing between the soul
[40:54] and the spirit
[40:57] it's the the bible is the best manual
[40:59] the best book
[41:01] and so it
[41:03] it became pronounced to me that not what
[41:05] we're not necessarily looking at
[41:06] personality disorders because maybe
[41:07] that's a phrase for us that seems to be
[41:09] more uh
[41:11] uh with medicine and science but it's
[41:13] okay it has to do with character
[41:15] and this is how the apa defines
[41:18] character the totality of an
[41:19] individual's attributes and personality
[41:21] traits particularly moral social and
[41:22] religious attitudes and they say it's
[41:24] often used synonymously with personality
[41:27] so the phrase that i want to use with
[41:29] you the subject that i hope to explore
[41:31] at times together is character disorders
[41:36] and that would be abnormal behaviors or
[41:37] mental states
[41:40] abnormal
[41:42] behaviors or abnormal thought patterns
[41:44] that are not
[41:45] in harmony with what the word of god
[41:47] says a christian ought to have
[41:48] persistent or intense distress
[41:50] disruption of spiritual functioning
[41:54] hey we've experienced that this week
[41:55] haven't we
[41:56] we found ourselves this week not feeling
[41:58] like we were in the spirit not feeling
[42:00] like we had the right attitude you might
[42:01] think the way you said that didn't seem
[42:03] to have the fruits of the spirit what
[42:04] i'm trying to say is there's times that
[42:06] we don't feel like we're very spiritual
[42:08] there's times that we feel like i don't
[42:10] really have a lot of faith there's times
[42:12] that you ought to just grab your
[42:12] family's hands and get on your knees and
[42:14] pray you know is i don't really feel
[42:16] like that right now
[42:18] and what would that be there'd be a
[42:19] disorder
[42:21] something something's been disrupted
[42:23] something's not right and if i could say
[42:25] this and i i mean this was with as much
[42:29] uh uh
[42:30] thus saith the lord that i could muster
[42:32] it's important that we begin to
[42:34] recognize the factors and influences
[42:36] that are working on us to create the
[42:39] incongruent expression of the holy ghost
[42:41] we have and no longer be beaten up to
[42:43] question our experience but to start
[42:45] denying the lies that are keeping it
[42:47] from manifesting the way that it ought
[42:49] to
[42:52] it seems as if the devil just wants to
[42:54] constantly keep us in this cycle well
[42:56] you just must not have the holy ghost
[42:57] and i'll say right now if you don't got
[42:58] it you need it
[43:00] because no amount of teaching and
[43:01] babying and
[43:03] medicines and diagnosis is going to help
[43:05] you until you get the new birth
[43:07] and i am going to come to that hopefully
[43:08] here in a minute you're going to you're
[43:09] going to need that
[43:11] you're going to need that birth
[43:13] but what what would be worse i say it's
[43:16] certainly awful that someone who doesn't
[43:17] have the holy ghost would be tricked
[43:18] into thinking they have it
[43:20] would we say that's awful
[43:22] it's equally awful for someone who has
[43:24] it to constantly be told they don't
[43:28] and there's and there's an equal
[43:30] detriment
[43:32] and and so this character disorder it
[43:35] could either be exposing the lack of a
[43:37] birth or it's showing that you must grow
[43:40] from a child to maturity you've got to
[43:42] be growing in this experience
[43:45] brother branham says and this is just to
[43:46] kind of amplify character some man is
[43:47] not measured by how much his biceps are
[43:50] how big a muscle he is he's measured by
[43:52] his character
[43:59] let's say this way
[44:00] that we're going to measure man by his
[44:02] personality
[44:04] so the
[44:06] the apa
[44:08] would get out their dsm-5
[44:11] right
[44:12] and they would kind of look at your
[44:13] attributes your characteristics what
[44:15] you're going through what you've been
[44:16] kind of
[44:17] tell me let's let's diagnose let's look
[44:19] at these symptoms let's look at these
[44:21] characteristics these things that have
[44:22] been been expressing and they're going
[44:24] to take the word of god or they're going
[44:25] to take this their manual and look at it
[44:27] and try to assess your personality and
[44:30] give you a label
[44:32] and tell you you know what what
[44:34] characteristics you're exhibiting so
[44:35] they can even say well even though you
[44:36] may not clinically be diagnosed with
[44:38] this disorder you're exhibiting certain
[44:40] characteristics associated with it
[44:42] they're going to try to put some of
[44:43] these labels on you but brother branham
[44:45] says and character comes from the word
[44:47] of god and that alone we're not using
[44:50] we're not using the methods of science
[44:52] we're not using the tools of psychiatry
[44:55] we're not using what's available to us
[44:56] in the world today to determine who we
[44:58] are as people to find my category to
[45:00] find my identity but we use the word of
[45:03] god to determine what character we have
[45:06] even if it's defined that we line up
[45:08] short
[45:10] in one way we could just compare
[45:12] ourselves to the world and leave tonight
[45:14] and feel pretty good about ourselves
[45:16] right but we don't want to just compare
[45:19] ourselves to this church or that what
[45:21] this was doing that one's doing uh we
[45:23] want to compare ourselves to the word of
[45:24] god he says character comes from the
[45:26] word so there is a proper measure of
[45:28] what the right character is there's a
[45:30] proper measure of what the wrong
[45:32] character is if somebody acts contrary
[45:34] to the word of god that is disorderly
[45:38] that is something contrary to the spirit
[45:41] because the spirit acts according to the
[45:43] word brother branham emphasizes it over
[45:45] and over and over and over again he says
[45:46] the spirit will not act contrary to the
[45:48] word someone says i got the spirit i'm
[45:49] enthused with the spirit i'm speaking of
[45:51] the spirit but speaks contrary to the
[45:52] word he says that can't be the spirit
[45:55] and so they look at what would be this
[45:57] baseline average temperament of a human
[45:59] being or what's socially acceptable or
[46:01] what we consider to be normal and they
[46:02] look at someone's pattern of behavior
[46:04] and they consult their manual they say
[46:05] oh they're deviating this is more akin
[46:07] to this this is not normal this is a
[46:09] disorder this is a disorder we want to
[46:11] judge ourselves by the word of god to
[46:14] know whether or not the word is working
[46:16] in us
[46:18] in science a personality disorder is
[46:20] considered a type of mental disorder
[46:23] this is in science but let me say this
[46:25] in life a character disorder
[46:27] is a type of spiritual disorder that can
[46:30] be remedied by the word
[46:33] i don't mean to take away from any
[46:35] anything that would be of a benefit that
[46:36] could be scientifically prescribed or
[46:38] medically prescribed
[46:40] i i i believe that the message of the
[46:42] hour teaches us a very positive balance
[46:44] on medicines
[46:46] positive balance on vaccines positive
[46:48] violence on hospitals and doctors and
[46:49] and things that can help us there's a
[46:51] very positive balance in the message of
[46:53] the hour
[46:54] and and if someone in it with their
[46:56] brother ram said when you're sick your
[46:57] first duty is to go to the doctor
[46:59] that's what he said
[47:01] and so in doing so i would not want to
[47:03] take away at all that doctors can
[47:04] prescribe things to help people through
[47:06] anxiety and help people through
[47:08] difficult situations help them to
[47:09] alleviate pain
[47:10] but what i would never want you to
[47:12] forget is that the word of god can heal
[47:14] the person
[47:16] so that they never need them again
[47:19] sister naomi was diagnosed with the
[47:21] peanut allergy
[47:23] right and basically
[47:25] talk about something that could follow
[47:26] your whole life she believed for her
[47:28] healing and guess what the power of god
[47:29] delivered her from it this is a
[47:31] diagnosis this is a this is some people
[47:33] can be a sentence you know you have to
[47:34] live your whole life and you can't eat
[47:35] this you'll have to live your whole life
[47:36] and be worried about that and this is
[47:38] something that the word of god remedied
[47:40] so there can be
[47:41] in life there can be what the world
[47:43] would call a personality disorder but
[47:46] the word of god can come and bring order
[47:49] where something's wrong
[47:51] bring healing bring deliverance ready
[47:52] the mind stabilize it
[47:56] and i'm not suggesting that there needs
[47:58] to be any kind of clinical diagnosis
[48:01] because as i mentioned earlier actual
[48:02] clinical diagnosis of these things is
[48:04] rare
[48:05] very rare
[48:07] but what i'm wanting to also i guess
[48:09] what i'm wanting to consider in the
[48:12] terminology
[48:14] is that there are some people that are
[48:15] religious psychopaths
[48:19] and you shouldn't be one
[48:24] there are some people who are spiritual
[48:26] psychopaths
[48:28] anybody with me
[48:30] i want you to think about this for a
[48:31] moment because we're not thinking in the
[48:33] sense of and i'll get into it more later
[48:35] because sometimes we think psychopaths
[48:37] are thinking
[48:39] right
[48:40] but in a spiritual sense if somebody
[48:42] assassinates your character
[48:44] right
[48:45] i think somebody told me here recently
[48:47] about the phrase you know why don't you
[48:48] just bury the hatchet and it's like well
[48:50] if you'll help me get it out of my back
[48:52] you'll just help me get the hatchet you
[48:54] dug into my back out maybe we can bury
[48:56] it
[48:57] why because there's some religious
[48:59] psychopaths
[49:01] and a psychopath
[49:02] a psychopathic someone who's a
[49:03] psychopath they have antisocial
[49:04] behaviors they lack empathy and they
[49:06] have a disregard for others and they
[49:08] exhibit narcissism
[49:13] so to be psychopathic if i could use
[49:15] this as an example a psychopathic sees
[49:17] morality
[49:19] as a colorblind person sees color
[49:23] so now if you begin to think in a
[49:24] spiritual sense what a psych
[49:26] and even some would argue that a
[49:27] psychopath or even a narcissist or these
[49:29] people with these disorders they have
[49:30] their own moral code or their own moral
[49:32] system and their own values
[49:34] and they just operate by different rules
[49:36] and they're going to hold you to some
[49:37] rules and this is kind of the nastiness
[49:40] of it even in reality
[49:42] but a colorblind person's unable to see
[49:44] color
[49:45] a person who's psychopathic is unable to
[49:48] see moral values and obligations and
[49:49] their responsibilities
[49:51] they just don't see it they just don't
[49:52] see that it applies to them they don't
[49:54] see that they have a duty they have a
[49:55] responsibility they don't see that
[49:56] they're accountable they don't see that
[49:57] they should have to answer for what they
[49:59] say and what they do they just kind of
[50:00] live and act in such a way to where none
[50:03] of these rules apply to them anymore
[50:05] and what we're wanting you to consider
[50:06] is how some people can come across as
[50:08] very spiritual very religious very
[50:11] social very ardent believers but when it
[50:14] comes to following the word of god and
[50:17] the things that they even say in the way
[50:19] that they judge others no longer applies
[50:21] to them if that's the case they're a
[50:24] religious psychopath
[50:38] it's i i know
[50:41] i know it's maybe a little bit of a
[50:42] attention-getting statement but i want
[50:44] you to consider it because that's how it
[50:46] struck me
[50:47] is god help us to never be
[50:50] the kind of spiritual psychopath
[50:52] where we can talk the message
[50:56] be very ardent
[50:58] supporters of it and pay it a lot of lip
[51:00] service
[51:01] then act completely inconsistent with it
[51:05] and that has done the greatest harm to
[51:07] the message of the hour
[51:10] is is the the hypocrisy
[51:13] and and the intense brother brother
[51:15] lowell now we're speaking about it
[51:18] in the office and it's something that i
[51:19] i i want to be very careful to express
[51:22] because it's something i just put aside
[51:24] tonight because i wanted to be able to
[51:25] articulate it very faithfully
[51:28] but we've we've taken being right
[51:30] because if we believe we have truth in
[51:32] the message of the hour
[51:34] it's changed toward we believe we're
[51:36] right
[51:37] and we're no longer connected to the
[51:39] truth
[51:40] we're more connected with the idea that
[51:41] we're right
[51:43] and then what we've done is we've let us
[51:45] be in right serve in the place of being
[51:48] in the spirit and having the spirit of
[51:51] christ
[51:52] and we've substituted being right with
[51:54] being in love
[51:56] and we lose our first love which is
[51:58] christ the word but we still believe
[52:00] we're right and then when we we assert
[52:02] our moral authority and we assert that
[52:04] we're right it's completely detached
[52:05] from the spirit and love and it never
[52:08] quite works out the way that we think it
[52:09] should so what do we say well they're
[52:10] just serpent seed
[52:13] it's just the devil
[52:14] right because we've detached spirit from
[52:17] truth because we're not even dealing
[52:18] with spirit and truth anymore we've
[52:20] we've relegated ourselves to right
[52:23] and it's not speaking the truth as love
[52:25] it's speaking the truth in love just
[52:27] speaking the truth and reading quotes
[52:29] and say well brother brown said it it
[52:31] must be the truth that's not that's not
[52:33] truth
[52:35] it can't be truth unless it has the
[52:37] nature of christ behind it
[52:39] how could we stand in the place of god
[52:42] and judge people and tear them down and
[52:44] look down on people and say well it's
[52:45] the truth isn't it when we don't have
[52:48] the foreknowledge we don't have the
[52:50] understanding of what has been and what
[52:52] will be we cannot stand in that place
[52:56] therefore we're responsible as believers
[52:59] of recognizing truth and being lovers of
[53:01] truth and be married to truth and being
[53:04] faithful to truth and let god decide
[53:07] who's right
[53:13] i'll just end on that
[53:16] i i'm not going to touch on the
[53:18] anti-spiritual personality disorder
[53:21] but i will say this just to get you
[53:22] thinking what i was wanting to express
[53:25] is that it's something incongruent with
[53:27] the spirit
[53:30] you may not be clinically diagnosed with
[53:33] it
[53:36] but let's become
[53:37] available to god to show us whenever
[53:40] we're acting
[53:41] anti-spiritual
[53:43] we may be far beyond ever being
[53:45] antichrist right
[53:48] we're just so settled in it we know our
[53:49] calling we know our election we're far
[53:51] beyond ever being antichrist but god
[53:53] help me to not crown my life with a
[53:55] spirit that's contrary to the nature of
[53:57] christ
[54:00] anti-spiritual is not someone who is
[54:03] carnal
[54:04] or appears unspiritual someone
[54:06] antichrist or unreligious
[54:09] is somebody who presents themselves as
[54:11] very spiritual but their lives
[54:13] and their attitudes and their actions
[54:16] are incongruent with it
[54:21] but the branham said and i have to say
[54:22] this before i close so that you don't
[54:24] lose sight of this he says
[54:26] you're a different person
[54:28] a different personality because you're a
[54:31] new creation
[54:33] when you're boarding in new personality
[54:36] new person and then the greatest battle
[54:39] ever fought starts
[54:41] between the old man and the new man
[54:44] and let's never justify the old man
[54:46] let's lift up the new man
[54:48] don't justify the old man lift up the
[54:50] new man i'll just close with this
[54:52] psychiatric labels these things i have
[54:54] to just share this in my heart i've left
[54:56] out a lot tonight i guess i realize now
[54:58] uh maybe even in that wisdom is not
[55:00] having a bunch of slides as i wasn't
[55:02] even going to use them
[55:04] but these labels we've read tonight
[55:05] these things we've referenced in my
[55:07] background the diagnostic and statistic
[55:08] manual of mental disorders
[55:11] they're man's attempt
[55:14] to address the deterioration of the mind
[55:16] as brother man said the human mind is
[55:18] leaving the people
[55:21] and educated people are trying to figure
[55:23] out what's going wrong with man
[55:26] what is happening
[55:28] and science is describing an
[55:29] individual's behavioral
[55:32] behavioral patterns and emotional
[55:33] patterns over time and say well this
[55:35] person's always doing this and doing
[55:36] this and doing this and they're trying
[55:38] to make sense of it
[55:40] they're trying to figure out how how can
[55:41] we address this and how can we alleviate
[55:44] this
[55:46] but
[55:47] as the world might the scientists might
[55:50] have some sort of clinical diagnosis of
[55:53] a person with some mental disorder
[55:54] whether it be a class a b or c whatever
[55:57] these uh clusters of disorders might
[56:00] be the depravity of it the the
[56:04] dissonance of it the disorder itself is
[56:06] because of evil
[56:08] adam in the beginning wasn't made to be
[56:10] a narcissist
[56:12] there's those that say you know is is
[56:14] there
[56:15] a psychopath in the bible and they say
[56:17] yes god's the first one
[56:19] why because they attribute these human
[56:21] notions of things to the divine and to
[56:23] deity it's like no our our own the only
[56:25] way that we can even begin to conjure
[56:27] the idea of evil is through satan that's
[56:30] the only way that god everything he says
[56:32] is the truth everything he does is right
[56:33] and just there is no concept of evil
[56:36] when it comes to god
[56:38] and we have to accept that and we ought
[56:40] to worship him because of that
[56:43] there no one else just do worship except
[56:45] god because he alone is the only one who
[56:47] when he speaks it's truth when he acts
[56:49] as just
[56:51] and if you just worshiped him on that
[56:52] basis alone he would receive your
[56:54] worship
[56:56] and and this this sentiment
[57:00] that uh that if you look in the bible
[57:03] evil only exists because of sin
[57:07] and there are only these disorders and
[57:09] these complexes and these problems of
[57:11] depression and anxiety
[57:13] there is only addictions and abuses and
[57:16] inducements and intoxications and
[57:19] infections because of sin
[57:22] and science is really really really
[57:24] really really good at describing the
[57:26] symptoms
[57:28] science is sometimes really good at
[57:30] diagnosing the condition
[57:32] but the same discipline that describes
[57:35] and the same discipline that diagnosis
[57:38] is not the same discipline that can
[57:39] deliver
[57:41] mankind all day long can try to can
[57:44] figure out what's wrong with man but
[57:46] it's only god that can solve man's
[57:48] problems
[57:49] science is very good at telling us when
[57:51] you have this disorder and you have this
[57:52] disorder and you have this health
[57:53] problem you have this bad thought
[57:54] process and they can tell us all day
[57:56] long take this pill of the help or do
[57:58] these things walk it'll help exercise
[58:00] it'll help talk it'll help those things
[58:02] are wonderful and those things are fine
[58:04] and i'm even an advocate for those if we
[58:07] had personal time to discuss your
[58:08] situation but there's one thing i know
[58:10] for sure for a son or daughter of god
[58:12] that this word is for them and the word
[58:15] is interested in your total person
[58:19] and we we're so often we so often can
[58:22] lift up that god can take a cancer a
[58:25] water on a woman's neck and cause it to
[58:27] disappear and we're so sensitive to the
[58:29] fact that god could take a broken limb
[58:31] and heal it the same god that heals the
[58:33] body is the same god that heals the mind
[58:36] that heals broken hearts that heals
[58:38] fractured spirits
[58:41] can take somebody who's absolutely
[58:43] insane and set him in the right mind
[58:49] this word this word is enough
[58:52] i believe in it
[58:55] brother adam says in the message
[58:56] identification
[58:58] we want to be
[58:59] want to make this bible our looking
[59:01] glass
[59:07] and let ourselves be molded by his
[59:10] character
[59:12] by having his character his mind letting
[59:15] the mind that was in christ be in us
[59:19] i want to make the bible my looking
[59:20] glass
[59:23] and i want myself to be molded into his
[59:26] character
[59:29] that's what i want
[59:31] i want myself to be molded into his
[59:32] character
[59:34] i want him to have the preeminence
[59:38] there's a lot said about the moving of
[59:39] the spirit
[59:41] and i think it's necessary
[59:44] and we ought to be open to that and
[59:45] there ought to be liberty to do it but
[59:47] let me say something beautiful about the
[59:48] message of the hour
[59:50] where the spirit of the lord is there's
[59:51] liberty
[59:53] and
[59:54] that by all means
[59:56] doesn't have
[59:57] to end in a church service
[1:00:03] it ought to be in our lives
[1:00:09] and i believe the perfecting of our
[1:00:10] character involves the healing of our
[1:00:12] minds
[1:00:14] the harmonizing of our emotions
[1:00:17] does it take away pain does it take away
[1:00:19] suffering does it take away anxiety does
[1:00:22] it take away certain things no
[1:00:25] but there's a process
[1:00:29] of bringing
[1:00:31] things
[1:00:32] under the looking glass of god's word
[1:00:36] and even molding those things to fit his
[1:00:39] character
[1:00:41] i believe god wants to do it for us
[1:00:43] i know i've spoken some very different
[1:00:45] things tonight there's maybe a
[1:00:47] uniqueness to the the
[1:00:48] uh the way that it was delivered
[1:00:51] sometimes when i'm nervous i use humor
[1:00:53] uh
[1:00:54] but tonight i hope
[1:00:57] that you understand you'll give me grace
[1:00:58] i've introduced some things that may be
[1:01:00] very interesting and very unique
[1:01:02] but let god speak to your heart
[1:01:05] you you can pin me down later i said
[1:01:06] well brother aaron you said this about
[1:01:07] the dsm and you said this about
[1:01:09] personality disorders and i'll say i'm
[1:01:10] willing to say i understand it's unique
[1:01:13] or it's different take this thing to say
[1:01:15] but let the lord speak to your heart
[1:01:16] tonight that's the most important part
[1:01:19] we bow our heads
[1:01:24] i asked in the beginning
[1:01:29] for you to be very deliberate and
[1:01:30] purposeful in how you pray
[1:01:33] and i want to ask right now
[1:01:37] that if you have
[1:01:40] in your heart
[1:01:42] believe that god
[1:01:46] has
[1:01:47] discerned
[1:01:49] your heart
[1:01:51] and you would want to acknowledge his
[1:01:53] care
[1:01:54] acknowledge that he has spoken to you
[1:01:56] tonight in direct connection by
[1:01:58] discernment direct connection to what
[1:02:00] you spoke to him in prayer you'd want to
[1:02:02] acknowledge that by standing before him
[1:02:04] tonight and say lord i receive it from
[1:02:06] you
[1:02:08] i'm receiving this right now you've
[1:02:10] spoke to me in a very personal way it's
[1:02:12] undeniable
[1:02:13] i i asked i asked god to speak to me i
[1:02:16] came expecting
[1:02:18] i put these things before you
[1:02:20] and i had no idea what brother aaron
[1:02:22] would be speaking
[1:02:23] therefore we don't need to give the
[1:02:25] accolades to to brother aaron let's give
[1:02:28] it to god to whom the honors do give it
[1:02:30] to god to whom the glory is due and
[1:02:31] you're standing now and i would even say
[1:02:34] lift up hands to thank him
[1:02:36] and give him the glory give him the
[1:02:39] recognition
[1:02:40] and submit to his prescription
[1:02:45] how many of us go to the doctor and they
[1:02:47] tell us oh well you've got this problem
[1:02:48] do this do that do this do that and we
[1:02:50] do it exactly exactly like they say
[1:02:52] expecting to get the results
[1:02:54] let's be honest with ourselves i've
[1:02:55] heard some of the diets that we go on
[1:02:57] and the extreme things we do and the way
[1:02:59] we
[1:03:00] enter into a regime and discipline
[1:03:02] ourselves to rid ourselves of toxins or
[1:03:04] certain sicknesses or certain diseases
[1:03:06] and we're very disciplined and very
[1:03:08] ardent to do those things would you
[1:03:10] tonight be willing to submit
[1:03:12] to the lord's prescription
[1:03:16] though it may be hard though it may be
[1:03:18] difficult maybe though it may seem to
[1:03:20] come with great sacrifice you say lord i
[1:03:22] came tonight with a prayer
[1:03:24] i prayed it in my heart you discerned it
[1:03:26] exactly
[1:03:27] i've got confidence tonight lord that
[1:03:30] you're mindful of what i need
[1:03:32] god bless so many of you standing
[1:03:34] tonight so many with hands raised
[1:03:37] he loves you
[1:03:39] he's so mindful of you just think of how
[1:03:42] he would even take a minister and drag
[1:03:44] him through the dsm-5
[1:03:47] to put things in a context to get your
[1:03:48] attention that he cares for you
[1:03:51] let's pray our gracious heavenly father
[1:03:54] there's a very beautiful atmosphere here
[1:03:56] tonight that you have created
[1:04:00] there is a faith bank that is rising and
[1:04:02] a power present amongst us right now
[1:04:04] that is so powerful lord
[1:04:06] because you're here
[1:04:09] and i believe that we sense it
[1:04:12] some of us having come out of special
[1:04:14] meetings and uh
[1:04:16] been in the moving of god and the
[1:04:18] atmosphere lord we we sense that you're
[1:04:20] near right now you're present with us
[1:04:21] and the power of god is here present to
[1:04:24] heal us to set us free and to deliver us
[1:04:27] and lord i want to be like that one that

[1:04:51] i i need not fall into those waters i
[1:04:54] just need you to come to me now and

[1:05:03] that our opportunity has not passed us
[1:05:06] by

[1:05:15] open up our understanding
[1:05:18] and i pray tonight that in your grace
[1:05:20] you've spoken to us in your tender
[1:05:22] mercies you've spoken to us tonight and

[1:05:28] pray that what could rise tonight as we

[1:05:52] to be used by you i'm willing to walk in
[1:05:54] your path i'm willing to do the things

[1:06:09] labels on ourselves we found we found
[1:06:12] comfort in our diagnosis the lord i pray
[1:06:14] tonight that we would get so sick and
[1:06:17] tired of the way that we've been living

[1:06:26] them in the name of the lord jesus

[1:06:55] in their deliverance
