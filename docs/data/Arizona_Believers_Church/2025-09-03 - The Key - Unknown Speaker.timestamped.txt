[0:00] Isaiah chapter 59
[0:03] verse 10
[0:06] and it says, "We grope for the wall like
[0:09] the blind and we grope as if we had no
[0:12] eyes. We stumble at noonday as in the
[0:15] night. We are in desolate places as dead
[0:18] men." What a statement. We grope for the
[0:21] wall like the blind and we grope as if
[0:23] we had no eyes. We stumble at noon day
[0:26] as in the night we are in desolate
[0:28] places as dead men. You can be seated.
[0:32] Just before I give you my title, I'd
[0:34] like to expound upon this just for a
[0:36] moment in terms of the we grow up like
[0:38] blind men. We've been reading a lot of
[0:40] scriptures lately on how they have eyes
[0:42] to see but they can't see or ears but
[0:45] can't hear, even uh a nose without uh
[0:48] the sense of smell or even mouths
[0:50] without breath in it. And so a lot of
[0:52] this is in that uh in that tuning or
[0:55] recognizing hearing the voice of God.
[0:57] But I'm wanting to draw more from the
[1:00] concept of good and evil. As we've been
[1:02] looking at, there is good, but then
[1:03] there's also evil. And God has planned
[1:06] things. It even says in the scripture,
[1:07] God hid the end from the beginning so
[1:09] that his way and his his purpose and his
[1:12] will is not easy to figure out, but it's
[1:14] hidden in his heart and he's got to
[1:15] reveal it. So, we see a lot of bad, we
[1:17] see a lot of good, but ultimately it's
[1:19] God's heart that's being revealed even
[1:21] in those difficult things and in those
[1:22] bad things that we experience. So, my
[1:25] title tonight is the key. We've been on
[1:27] the subject of music, so there's a
[1:28] little bit of a music emphasis here uh
[1:31] that we're wanting to still use, but I I
[1:34] the title is going to maybe shift you in
[1:36] a little bit of a different direction
[1:37] than maybe you're anticipating, but the
[1:40] key maybe a lot of other ways we could
[1:41] have phrased it, but I think this is a
[1:43] key title. I want to begin by looking at
[1:46] how that we are living and this is all
[1:48] maybe review for you but living in an
[1:50] evil day. The Bible even calls it the
[1:51] evil day. We could say it's
[1:53] characterized by gross spiritual
[1:55] darkness. And in the midst of all this
[1:58] spiritual darkness, there's this u
[2:00] intellectual enlightenment where man
[2:03] knows more now than he ever has before.
[2:05] He's being able to use information
[2:06] better than he has before. They're
[2:08] discovering things about the human body
[2:10] now with technology and analytics that
[2:12] they never had discovered before.
[2:14] They're even able to use these LLMs in
[2:18] such a way to where they can feed it
[2:19] with a bunch of data and they could come
[2:20] up with cures for diseases that they've
[2:22] been working on or treatments that
[2:23] they've been working on for decades and
[2:26] uh haven't quite been able to figure it
[2:28] out. but just through the the computing
[2:29] power and what we might say is now this
[2:31] this ability this intellectualism
[2:34] uh it's accomplishing things that have
[2:36] never been accomplished before.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; But yet we understand that despite what
[2:40] man is achieving by his intellect and
[2:42] his senses, there's still this great
[2:44] spiritual darkness. As Revelations 3:1
[2:47] 17 characterizes the church of of
[2:50] Leodysia,
[2:51] they say, the Bible says that they say
[2:53] that they're rich, increased with goods,
[2:55] and have need of nothing. And yet God's
[2:58] diagnosis is and knowest not that thou
[3:00] art wretched and miserable and poor and
[3:02] blind and naked. So we've gotten our
[3:04] obligatory Revelations 3 reference out
[3:06] of the way at the very beginning. And so
[3:08] there must be some level of attainment,
[3:10] some measure of accomplishment for them
[3:12] to say rich, increase with goods, have
[3:14] have needed nothing, all their
[3:16] attainments and all the things that they
[3:17] wear and all the things that they have
[3:18] and all these great scientific and
[3:20] intellectual accomplishments. But yet
[3:22] God looks at them and there's this
[3:24] inverse to what they've achieved
[3:26] naturally. Think of this that what
[3:28] they've achieved by the flesh, there's
[3:30] this inverse that reflects in
[3:32] wretchedness, misery, poverty,
[3:34] blindness, and nakedness.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; However, they're full intellectually and
[3:39] physically and scientifically and by
[3:40] their own personal knowledge. There's
[3:42] this inverse level of debasement uh and
[3:45] emptiness and nakedness. So yes, things
[3:48] have never been better before in certain
[3:49] spheres, but as man has achieved things
[3:51] by his own senses, there's been this
[3:54] bankruptcy on the spiritual side.
[3:57] This is a time that the uh Bible
[4:02] declares or characterizes as darkness. I
[4:04] checked the doomsday clock this week.
[4:06] It's at 89 seconds to midnight. It's the
[4:08] closest it's ever been. Even closer than
[4:12] it was when it's when we were going
[4:13] through the pandemic.
[4:16] It's closer than it's ever been before
[4:18] since they started. It's 89 seconds to
[4:20] midnight. So, we're living in uh
[4:22] troublesome times, dark times. A lot of
[4:24] scriptures we could use. I'll use some
[4:25] that are maybe cliche, but in Isaiah
[4:27] 60:2, it says, "Darkness shall cover the
[4:30] earth." And it's not just a darkness
[4:31] upon the earth, but gross darkness, the
[4:33] people. What is this? The darkness of
[4:35] ignorance, the the darkness of
[4:38] superstition, the darkness of lies. And
[4:41] in the midst of all that, yet there's
[4:42] this uh uh these this darkness, the
[4:44] superstition, and even the lies, they're
[4:46] they're being recast as knowledge.
[4:49] It's been redefined as fact or or or
[4:52] characterized as an awakening,
[4:54] ignorance, lies, all sorts of things.
[4:56] But then they all they have to do is
[4:57] redefine it. We just accept the
[4:59] definition. That's how you know even
[5:02] with our language and we we say certain
[5:04] things and we use a language that can
[5:06] actually be used for the actual the
[5:08] inverse such as when we say we my head
[5:11] literally exploded. We're using
[5:13] literally figuratively.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; And so there's a way that all we have to
[5:17] do is just change our language a little
[5:19] bit and things that are one way
[5:20] immediately become another way. In
[5:23] Exodus 10 21, in the days of the Exodus
[5:26] out of Egypt by Israel, and the Lord
[5:27] said unto Moses, "Stretch out thine hand
[5:29] toward heaven that there may be darkness
[5:31] over the land of Egypt, even darkness
[5:33] which may be felt." This is that gross
[5:36] darkness that exists in the earth today
[5:38] and upon the people. It's just like this
[5:41] darkness was in the days of Egypt. Now,
[5:43] in our own time period, in our own day
[5:45] of judgment, there's a darkness that can
[5:48] be felt.
[5:50] And we, as we've been looking at through
[5:52] over the last couple months on good and
[5:53] evil and this darkness and this
[5:55] dissonance and all these things that
[5:57] exist around us, our lives are
[5:59] overwhelmed with that darkness.
[6:01] &gt;&gt; Our lives, we suffer. There's all sorts
[6:03] of distress around us and confusion.
[6:06] Darkness and evil surround us.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; And there could be a lot that could be
[6:12] said at this point, and I haven't really
[6:14] I didn't try to chart it out or make a
[6:15] list. Maybe I could have used AI to do
[6:18] it, but man's response to the darkness
[6:20] varies. Uh we could be paralyzed by it.
[6:23] We could try to fight it. We could just
[6:24] be frozen. There's a lot of different
[6:26] responses, but sometimes we just ignore
[6:28] it. Ignore the darkness. Or uh people
[6:31] scream into the void. They just yell at
[6:33] the darkness. Um others try to explain
[6:36] it or make sense of the darkness.
[6:38] There's all sorts of darkness around us,
[6:39] paradoxes, unexplainable phenomena,
[6:41] things that we can't quite figure out.
[6:43] uh even to the point where the Bible
[6:45] says it's going to come a time when
[6:46] men's hearts are failing for fear
[6:48] &gt;&gt; and there's certain things that can't be
[6:50] explained and certain things that get
[6:51] turned upside down and it's a so it's a
[6:53] time of great shaking and agitation
[6:56] and no doubt that 200 years ago on this
[6:58] day a a minister stood behind the pulpit
[7:01] and preached the exact same thing and it
[7:03] was true then and it's true now
[7:06] &gt;&gt; it's becoming more and more pronounced
[7:09] &gt;&gt; some of these elements that you'll find
[7:10] in the land today according to scripture
[7:12] in 1 John 4:1 beloved and and I'm going
[7:15] to highlight this a little bit uh not
[7:17] out of context but just zero in on one
[7:20] facet of this believe not every spirit
[7:22] but try these spirits whether they are
[7:24] of God because many false prophets are
[7:26] gone out into the world this should tell
[7:28] us that there's a lot of spirits
[7:30] &gt;&gt; and in this quantity of spirits not all
[7:34] of them are God
[7:35] &gt;&gt; because there is only one God and he
[7:38] says there's many false prophets so this
[7:39] exists within the spiritual dark
[7:42] darkness that we live within be one
[7:44] thing if it was just spiritually dark
[7:45] and we're just all sincerehearted people
[7:47] on our own and we're trying to find that
[7:49] needle in the haststack called God and
[7:51] there were no other spirits or false
[7:53] prophets saying he's over there he's
[7:54] over there or I am he and all sorts of
[7:56] deception that would be a little bit
[7:58] more comforting because all someone
[7:59] would have to do is find the needle and
[8:00] say guys I found it and we could go and
[8:03] he could just feel it for ourselves but
[8:04] there's all sorts of things to cause
[8:06] this confusion in 2 Timothy 4:es 3 and 4
[8:10] for the time will come when they will
[8:11] not endure sound doctrine.
[8:16] That's true.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; But after their own lust shall they heap
[8:18] to themselves teachers having itching
[8:21] ears. So they're not going to be able to
[8:24] uh endure sound doctrine. So in doing so
[8:28] they'll want to fill that void. They
[8:30] when there's sound doctrine is going to
[8:32] rub on you. Good strong teaching is
[8:35] going to uncover.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Where Christ is preached. Christ Christ
[8:39] preached brings a divide. He said that
[8:40] he does. And as much as we'd like to be
[8:42] able to preach a Christ that just kind
[8:44] of unites everybody and shapes us in
[8:46] certain ways and like this great game of
[8:48] Tetris where we can all find the way
[8:49] that we fit and then once we all find
[8:50] the ways that we fit after getting
[8:52] turned around all the everything just
[8:54] disappears and it's called the rapture
[8:55] when we've made every piece fit. No, God
[8:57] comes and he he actually brings a
[8:59] divide. There's a separation. Yes, sir.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; And so if you cannot endure sound
[9:04] doctrine, you will find something to
[9:06] fill the spot that sound good doctrine
[9:10] was trying to address or fill.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; So out of their own lust, they heap to
[9:13] themselves teachers having itching ears.
[9:15] There's a taste. There's something they
[9:17] want to feel. And they shall turn away
[9:18] their ears from the truth and shall be
[9:20] turned unto fables. There's heaps and
[9:23] piles of teachers.
[9:26] And in this, there's this unlimited
[9:28] number of fables and lies and myths that
[9:30] they begin to pile up. And no doubt
[9:33] they're not calling themselves teachers
[9:35] of fables, but teachers of truth,
[9:37] recasting these lies and these deceits
[9:39] as facts and truths. And so those people
[9:42] who can endure sound doctrine find a
[9:44] substitute for it and they put the label
[9:46] on it as truth.
[9:48] In Ephesians chapter 4:14,
[9:51] the very reason why the Holy Spirit
[9:54] speaks the word, and the truth is
[9:55] preached in love, it's that we
[9:57] henceforth be no more children, tossed
[9:59] to and fro, and carried about with every
[10:01] wind of doctrine, by the slight of men,
[10:02] and by cunning craftiness, whereby they
[10:04] lie in weight to deceive. There's all
[10:07] sorts of winds, pressures. There's all
[10:10] sorts of slights and faints and fake
[10:12] trickery, cunning craftiness where they
[10:14] lie and wait to deceive. There's a lot
[10:16] of things that come to try to shake us,
[10:19] &gt;&gt; to cause us as children. That would be
[10:21] the UN, maybe immature or unstable,
[10:24] cause us to be tossed to and fro by the
[10:27] winds, the slights, the craftiness. And
[10:29] what's the whole purpose? To topple us
[10:31] over and cause us to be deceived.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; My son Preston was trying to describe
[10:37] something here recently with just the
[10:39] things that maybe we're all
[10:40] experiencing, these things that attack
[10:42] us. A and he was just sharing his heart
[10:45] a couple weeks ago and he said he was
[10:47] telling my wife he said you know up here
[10:50] we're just being shaken. I could he just
[10:53] described up here we're being shaken. He
[10:55] goes but we're solid right here
[10:58] &gt;&gt; right? We're we're solid down here.
[10:59] We're certain some people don't have
[11:01] that. So it starts shaking they move and
[11:03] they shake and they move and then press
[11:04] just saw it as yeah there's a there's an
[11:06] agitation there's a a confusion. There's
[11:09] a heartache. There's things that happen
[11:10] up here, but then you realize I'm not
[11:12] being moved.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; I may be I may be wavering in in just in
[11:17] the buffeting, but my I'm solid. I'm on
[11:19] solid ground.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; And so there's all sorts of slights and
[11:24] uh things to come. We could call them
[11:26] voices, voices that are distractions,
[11:28] voices that are contradictions.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; We could say the word is preached, the
[11:33] word is preached, sound doctrine is
[11:34] preached, that truth is being spoken in
[11:36] love. Uh there's the spirit of God
[11:39] through a true spirit of prophecy.
[11:41] There's all things that we could lay out
[11:42] here in scripture. But then in the midst
[11:43] of all that in the good, there's the
[11:45] dissonant. There's the contradictions.
[11:47] There's these other voices. As Paul said
[11:49] in 1 Corinthians 14:10, there's so many
[11:52] kinds of voices in the world.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; And he says, none of them are without
[11:57] signification. In other words, they're
[11:58] all signaling something
[12:01] that there's a sound, there's an
[12:02] utterance. the sound waves go out as
[12:04] we've been talking about having a your
[12:06] ear tuned to God and a deaf ear to the
[12:08] devil. These all these things are
[12:10] sounding and if you're if you're not
[12:11] careful and you get untuned a little
[12:13] bit, you begin to tune in to those
[12:15] voices. That's what the algorithm is all
[12:17] about with Twitter and all these other
[12:19] social media platforms is they want to
[12:20] kind of finetune what you feed on so you
[12:24] can be tuned to it and they could cause
[12:25] you to act upon it.
[12:28] Isn't it amazing all the things you
[12:29] found out you really needed by virtue of
[12:31] um of the marketplace and and Twitter
[12:34] and you're like, "Man, I didn't know
[12:35] they were making such incredible cargo
[12:36] pants and wow, I didn't even know that
[12:38] there was a a knife out there that was
[12:40] an everyday carry that you can't live
[12:41] without." And there's all sorts of
[12:42] things and at the end of the day, it's
[12:44] marketing.
[12:47] So, I could spend all night talking
[12:49] about this darkness
[12:52] that exists
[12:54] and this darkness all around us, but let
[12:57] me just bring
[12:59] let me just say what's what asks the
[13:01] question. What's the way out of this
[13:02] madness?
[13:05] If we can accept this is a day of evil,
[13:06] we can accept there's voices. If we
[13:08] believe the Bible that there's darkness,
[13:10] well, where is the darkness? Well, it's
[13:11] all around us. What is the darkness? A
[13:13] lot of it's easy to identify, but in all
[13:16] this unsettling and moving and shifting,
[13:18] how can we find peace?
[13:21] Where is that? How do we know that we
[13:22] have solid footing?
[13:25] &gt;&gt; How do we know that we haven't just been
[13:26] swept so far off the off the mountain
[13:28] side that we're that the whole thing is
[13:31] moving?
[13:33] &gt;&gt; How can we find light? How do we know
[13:35] what's life is? How do we know what
[13:36] truth is?
[13:38] And I had originally was using a working
[13:41] title for this called the escape room.
[13:44] And I was afraid that I was going to get
[13:45] slapped with the cease and desist. And
[13:47] so I refrained from using that as a
[13:49] title, but uh I'm disappointed that my
[13:51] font didn't show through. That's on me.
[13:54] But in it seems very generic, but at
[13:55] least it's not comic sands. Uh in with
[13:59] an escape room, and it actually some of
[14:01] the young people went and did one this
[14:02] past week. Uh, but it's just a it's a
[14:04] How many here have ever done an actual
[14:06] what I'm referring to as an escape room
[14:08] as a themed adventure game. Okay,
[14:10] there's a lot of people here we'll get
[14:11] those amens out of. And in these the
[14:14] general premise is myself having never
[14:16] done it. So if I lose all credibility,
[14:17] stick with me. I can get to the things I
[14:19] have done here in a minute. But they
[14:22] where the players are locked so to speak
[14:24] in a room. And as you can guess, the
[14:27] concept or the idea is to escape the
[14:29] room.
[14:30] And it's not going to be by brute force.
[14:32] you're going to have to figure out a way
[14:34] out of this room. Some of us might just
[14:36] say, "These walls feel very uh weak. Why
[14:40] don't we just burrow through this with
[14:43] this chair?" But there's a way that
[14:44] you've got to get out. And as you if you
[14:46] really want to think about it, the
[14:48] escape room is an analogy of Satan's
[14:49] Eden.
[14:51] He has turned our lives into a an
[14:55] adventure themed, you know, a a game
[14:57] night where we're all stuck in this dark
[15:00] room and we He's saying, "Figure your
[15:02] way out."
[15:04] All the different fake things like, "Oh,
[15:06] look at this. This moves. I wonder if
[15:07] this is going to make it work." Or, "Oh,
[15:08] look. I found this. Maybe this is maybe
[15:10] there's a clue in this." And you're
[15:11] trying to decipher all sorts of things
[15:13] and figure everything out. It really is
[15:15] an analogy for Satan's Eden. And in this
[15:18] escape room, as many of you already know
[15:20] know better than myself, to escape you
[15:21] must solve puzzles. You got to find
[15:23] clues. You got to complete certain
[15:25] tasks. And it's all within a certain
[15:27] amount of time. Like you have an hour.
[15:29] You have 30 minutes. And if you don't
[15:30] finish it, you lose. And so there's
[15:33] certain keys that you might have when
[15:35] trying to figure out how to get out of
[15:37] the room. You might find an actual key
[15:38] that unlocks a lock or a padlock. You
[15:40] might find something that opens a box or
[15:42] doors. And then there's even keys
[15:44] throughout it that are pieces of
[15:45] information.
[15:47] might have a cipher that's something
[15:48] coded and then you try to decipher it.
[15:50] You find the key. This is how this is
[15:52] written or this is what this displays
[15:54] and this is what it's trying to signify.
[15:56] And when you're in the escape room and
[15:58] you know the clock is ticking and life
[15:59] isn't forever and you want to be able to
[16:01] find the meaning of life and find truth
[16:02] and secure your eternal destiny before
[16:04] the clock stops clicking ticking, you
[16:07] have to read the clues. You got to find
[16:09] the keys. And it requires some human
[16:12] creativity. What would you agree? If
[16:14] you're going to do a an escape room, you
[16:16] got to think how would a diabolical game
[16:18] room owner structure this in such a way
[16:21] to where there's a necessary enough
[16:23] tension and but yet release so that I
[16:26] come back again and I buy the
[16:27] membership.
[16:29] There's some creativity. There's some
[16:31] ingenuity. There's got to be some
[16:32] cleverness.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; You're not just going to be able to take
[16:35] go over the door and wiggle the knob and
[16:37] you know what is it? you know, twice
[16:40] this way, back this way, like the
[16:41] combination locks on our uh in high
[16:44] school that you can never remember or
[16:45] certainly if I was faced with one now, I
[16:47] have no idea. And so that might be all
[16:49] they need anymore for this generation
[16:51] who's never used one of those is do a
[16:53] combination lock. They never got out
[16:55] there. Here's the combination. Open the
[16:57] lock. And they don't know the way, the
[16:59] key to get it open.
[17:01] And that's this is this is I say this is
[17:05] an analogy of Satan's Eden because it's
[17:07] really what we've tried to do with the
[17:08] darkness is we've tried to uh get rocket
[17:10] ships that'll blast us off this earth
[17:12] and find something better and more
[17:13] durable. We've tried to use science to
[17:15] figure out the darkness, heal the
[17:16] darkness, chase away the darkness, um
[17:19] plate us in the midst of the darkness
[17:21] and maybe try to find some way out of
[17:23] it. But this is human ingenuity. This is
[17:25] science and education and cleverness and
[17:27] puzzle solving. But what about the
[17:30] spiritual confusion?
[17:32] If there are false prophets and many
[17:33] spirits that are not of God, and there's
[17:35] a darkness which may be felt, and
[17:36] there's all sorts of winds and slights
[17:38] and craftiness and lies and many voices,
[17:41] uh there's how do we how do we make our
[17:44] way and navigate that maze?
[17:47] How do we make sense of that darkness,
[17:49] remove the darkness, and see through the
[17:51] darkness? How how can we navigate the
[17:53] labyrinth and find our way through it?
[17:55] Maybe I could ask it this way. What is
[17:56] the key? There may be clues that are
[17:59] given to an escape room and you're
[18:00] you're relying upon your ability to
[18:02] connect things. It's all it's all
[18:04] according to your ability. That's right.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; Uh maybe there's luck involved. Who
[18:08] wants here just to admit that it was
[18:09] it's been luck that got you out a time
[18:11] or two? And we we hope for that when it
[18:14] comes to games of chance, when it comes
[18:16] to certain things in life.
[18:20] But if you don't
[18:22] if you don't know the key,
[18:25] as we could use it in a music sense,
[18:28] in a musical sense, you know what a what
[18:30] a key is. If you don't know the key,
[18:33] it's nothing but a cacophony of death.
[18:36] It's chaotic. I was playing the guitar
[18:38] today and I was looking at the chords
[18:40] and I looked at it and I thought it was
[18:42] I thought it was C. The chord it was
[18:43] written in C. And so I started playing
[18:45] in C and I'm like this these are not the
[18:47] right right chords at all. Of course, I
[18:49] was going to correct the world and let
[18:50] CCLI know that, look, I mean, I know
[18:52] this guy's a a great songwriter, but the
[18:54] chords he gave you aren't right because
[18:56] I'm playing this in C, and that's not
[18:58] the way he sounds when he sings it. And
[18:59] then I realize it's not in C, it's in G.
[19:03] And so, if you don't know the key, you
[19:04] can be all over the place. You ever
[19:05] heard of somebody on the piano try to
[19:07] find the crack that someone's singing
[19:08] in? They're all over the place, but then
[19:10] all you say, "I'm in F." Immediately,
[19:12] they know right where to go,
[19:13] &gt;&gt; or they can get you an F if you need to
[19:15] be there. And so if you don't know the
[19:18] key,
[19:19] then it's this it's just chaos. But
[19:22] instead of that symphony of life
[19:26] in Proverbs 21:16,
[19:30] it's borrowing from the this analogy of
[19:32] darkness in this escape room, it says,
[19:33] "The man that wanderth out of the way of
[19:34] understanding shall remain in the
[19:36] congregation of the dead."
[19:38] So there must be understanding to make
[19:40] your way. If you wander out of the way
[19:42] of wisdom and righteousness and
[19:43] understanding, then you're going to
[19:45] remain in the congregation of the dead,
[19:47] those that have have come from the
[19:48] ground and will return to it without any
[19:50] hope of something further.
[19:53] In Luke 11:52, he said, "Woe unto you
[19:55] lawyers, for ye have taken away the key
[19:58] of knowledge." And all the lawyers said,
[19:59] "Amen. Woe unto you lawyers, for you
[20:02] have taken away the key of knowledge. Ye
[20:03] have entered not in yourselves, and them
[20:05] that were entering in, ye hindered."
[20:07] Isn't that just like the skeptic, the
[20:09] hypocrite that they don't want to go in,
[20:13] but they try to take away your key of
[20:14] understanding and knowledge and keep you
[20:16] from going in? I don't want to go there.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; I have no desire to go there. I wouldn't
[20:20] want to do that. Instead of themselves
[20:22] just reckoning they can't see or they
[20:24] don't know or they don't want to enter
[20:25] in, they try to take away the key of
[20:27] understanding. They themselves not
[20:29] having any understanding and not wanting
[20:32] you to enter in, they'll try to keep you
[20:33] from entering in.
[20:35] A key is an instrument for opening a
[20:38] lock. As you've already alluded to it in
[20:40] a musical sense, it's the relationship
[20:42] that centers on a given tone.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; When you know the key, then you know
[20:47] what the relationships are among the the
[20:49] key as in being that that tone, that
[20:51] spec specific tone, then you know what
[20:54] these others are supposed to relate to.
[20:56] If you know it's C, then you know
[20:57] there's not these there's not the sharps
[20:59] and flats. If you if you know the
[21:00] relative minor is a minor, there's
[21:02] certain things that you could know by
[21:03] knowing the key. You can rule out
[21:05] certain things. If you're trying to
[21:06] figure out where it goes, if you know
[21:08] the key, you're like, well, I know it
[21:09] doesn't go there because that's not even
[21:11] possible.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Change the key and all of a sudden it
[21:14] changes. This is a possibility. These
[21:16] sharps and flats enter back in and and
[21:18] they're they're a possibility. So if you
[21:20] don't know the key that that that the
[21:22] way of opening understanding and
[21:24] catching the symphony
[21:27] &gt;&gt; then you're still lost.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; You got to know the key in order to
[21:31] understand the relationship of certain
[21:33] things. In Job 12 25, Job is speaking
[21:38] about God in these prior verses and it's
[21:40] really really powerful. I thought about
[21:41] reading almost the whole thing as he
[21:43] begins to just talk about God and what
[21:45] he can do. And he talks about how God
[21:46] confounds humanity that they grow up
[21:48] here in verse 25. They grow up in the
[21:50] dark without dark without light and he
[21:52] maketh them to stagger like a drunken
[21:54] man. Not physically intoxicated, but
[21:57] they just don't know their way.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; They grope in the dark without light.
[22:03] It's what Isaiah says in chapter 59:10.
[22:06] We grow up for the wall like the blind.
[22:08] And we grow up as if we had no eyes.
[22:11] Trying to find the wall. Trying to know
[22:13] what measures and boundaries are. Trying
[22:15] to find the wall to maybe make your way
[22:16] to the door to try to get out of the
[22:18] darkness that you're in. But we grow up
[22:21] as if we had no eyes. We stumble at
[22:23] noonday as in the night. We are in
[22:25] desolate places as dead men. Why?
[22:28] Because we've wandered out of the way of
[22:29] understanding.
[22:31] In in Isaiah 59, it's because of
[22:33] disobedience. for rejecting truth.
[22:36] When you reject it, all that's left is
[22:38] blindness. And you'll grope along the
[22:40] wall like the blind.
[22:43] I I'm searching for the door knob. What
[22:44] are you doing? Why are you doing that?
[22:45] I'm searching for the doororknob. Where
[22:47] is it? I I don't know. I'm just
[22:48] searching for it.
[22:51] And you're and and and you're just
[22:52] looking in the room saying, "Well, okay.
[22:54] I thought you knew where it was, buddy.
[22:56] Door's open. You're not going to be able
[22:57] to find a doororknob. The way's been
[22:59] made.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; I have eyes to see. I'm going to keep
[23:02] going. And you can you can search all
[23:04] you want for this key out of here,
[23:08] but you'll do so you'll stagger like a
[23:10] drunken man. In Deuteronomy 28:29,
[23:14] as the consequence of disobedience to
[23:17] the the written word, and they shall
[23:19] grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth
[23:21] in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper
[23:23] in thy ways. One of the words and
[23:24] phrases used maybe in old times early
[23:27] 1900s was progging where you just you
[23:29] take a key and you're just trying to
[23:31] trying to make it fit.
[23:33] It's why uh when there's you try to use
[23:36] a well maybe we can all proging is what
[23:38] you try to do when you try to plug in
[23:40] your USB cable without seeing it. You
[23:42] progue, right? You're trying to plug
[23:43] something in and you can't see. You're
[23:45] just constantly doing it. You turn it
[23:46] over. You're trying to do it again. It
[23:47] just won't fit.
[23:50] It's be like USBC.
[23:52] No matter which way you turn it, it
[23:54] works.
[23:56] But there is a grop in at noonday. The
[23:58] blind grope in darkness, and they're not
[24:01] successful in their endeavors. They
[24:02] shall be only oppressed and spoiled
[24:05] evermore, and no man shall save thee. In
[24:08] other words, this is an oppression
[24:10] that's not physical. This is an
[24:12] oppression that's not elemental. This is
[24:14] not an oppression that has to do with uh
[24:17] um altitude so that you can move to the
[24:20] valley and and get over the altitude
[24:22] sickness or move up a little bit higher
[24:24] to where it's a little bit cooler.
[24:25] There's no escape for this kind of
[24:26] darkness and blindness.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; This is the evil day that we're living
[24:33] in.
[24:35] Then in Hebrews chapter 2:es 1 to4,
[24:39] a little bit of a different uh maybe
[24:41] just moving a little bit further here.
[24:43] So if I'm using this thought of being
[24:44] chained or bound, groping in darkness,
[24:47] unable to see in this escape room as it
[24:50] were, and we want to find our way out,
[24:52] it says, "Therefore, we ought to give
[24:53] more earnest heed to the things which we
[24:55] have heard." Chapter one kind of sets
[24:57] this up a little bit, how that the
[24:59] gospel can be preached, but if it's not
[25:00] mixed with faith, it will not profit
[25:02] you. So he says, "We ought to give an
[25:03] earnest heed to the gospel which is
[25:05] preached, lest at any time we should let
[25:08] these things that we have heard, let
[25:09] them slip.
[25:11] For if the word spoken by angels was
[25:13] steadfast, and every transgression and
[25:15] disobedience received a just recompense
[25:17] of reward, so if the words of angels
[25:20] were made plain, and there was a
[25:22] consequence for not observing them, how
[25:24] shall we escape if we neglect so great
[25:27] salvation? This is the salvation which
[25:30] is by Jesus Christ alone, which at the
[25:32] first began to be spoken by the Lord,
[25:34] and was confirmed unto us by them that
[25:36] heard him. This is a clear reference to
[25:37] Jesus Christ. God also bearing them
[25:39] witness both with signs and wonders and
[25:41] with diverse miracles and the gifts of
[25:43] the Holy Ghost according to his own
[25:45] will. How will one escape when the word
[25:49] is preached and God confirms it with
[25:52] signs and wonders and yet you don't hold
[25:55] to it and you let it slip.
[25:57] Think of this that when God has not only
[26:00] uh spoken by way of those who have heard
[26:02] him and even if we use Ephesians 4 and
[26:04] other manners that we could say that the
[26:06] spirit would speak and God bearing
[26:08] witness in your own life with signs and
[26:10] wonders and miracles.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; How many could testify tonight by show
[26:14] of hands that God has witnessed his
[26:16] presence in your life through a miracle?
[26:20] &gt;&gt; God is clearly establishing his presence
[26:22] with you. Maybe using something to make
[26:24] himself real. He says, "When God has
[26:26] done all this, if we were to neglect
[26:29] this great salvation that's being
[26:31] presented, he's saying, how can we
[26:33] escape?"
[26:35] &gt;&gt; When God is doing more now than maybe he
[26:37] did then to declare Jesus Christ because
[26:40] then we could say, "Well, in the Exodus,
[26:41] it was signs and wonders and miracles
[26:43] and a prophet, but now by his own son,
[26:44] he's speaking." And if we reject that,
[26:46] how are we going to escape if they don't
[26:49] escape having rejected just angels?
[26:53] Jesus says it this way. I believe it's
[26:55] kind of a similar thought in Luke 21
[26:58] 34-36.
[27:00] And take heed to yourselves. Listen,
[27:02] anytime your hearts be overcharged with
[27:04] surfing, I think we could change that to
[27:07] surfing.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; Doom scrolling. This isn't to the the
[27:12] bros in the bro sphere who like to ride
[27:16] waves. So, it's not that kind of
[27:17] surfing. It's just the doom scrolling.
[27:21] Right?
[27:21] &gt;&gt; And when you look at what that surfing
[27:23] means, it it it literally is that being
[27:26] carried away
[27:28] &gt;&gt; and you're carried in something. You're
[27:30] you're being surfed away to be snared
[27:33] away from truth.
[27:36] So take heed to yourselves. We say,
[27:37] "Well, take heed more earnest heed to
[27:39] the things that you've been you've been
[27:40] hearing." Now he says, "Take heed to
[27:42] yourselves so that your heart does not
[27:43] become overwhelmed with this surfeting
[27:46] and drunkenness and cares of this life.
[27:48] Will that day come upon you unawares?
[27:52] It's going to be a time when time's up.
[27:54] Going to be a judgment time. There's
[27:55] going to be a revealing. There's going
[27:56] to be an unfolding. And what are the
[27:58] dangers? That you're not taking heed to
[28:00] the gospel which has been preached. And
[28:03] you're not taking heed to yourself to
[28:04] realize that your heart is being
[28:06] overwhelmed through the cares of this
[28:08] life in inappropriate intoxication. This
[28:11] influence that drives you. this dull
[28:14] doom scrolling, this infatuation with
[28:17] sequels and prequels, a and certain
[28:19] genres of things. There's people that
[28:21] care more about the genres in the world
[28:24] than the gene of God that's inside of
[28:25] them.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; And they're wanting to always read the
[28:29] next book.
[28:31] And they're always wanting to uh uh, you
[28:34] know, buy this and buy that. And you
[28:35] say, "Well, are you preaching against
[28:36] reading books? Stick with me." No, I'm
[28:39] not preaching against reading books. But
[28:41] you ought to take heed to what you read
[28:45] &gt;&gt; because as the water that pours into the
[28:47] ground and nourishes a seed, so does the
[28:50] spirit of the author nourish your heart
[28:52] when you read their books.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; And that's how we get caught up on
[28:57] fiction and fantasy and things that
[28:59] aren't real. That's why we begin to have
[29:01] an ear for the fantasy, right? And the
[29:05] fiction over the truth. And we don't we
[29:08] don't realize it, but we've been
[29:09] completely detuned.
[29:11] We want something fantastic.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; He says be for as a snare shall it come
[29:23] on all them that dwell on the face of
[29:24] the whole earth.
[29:27] Watch ye therefore and pray always
[29:30] that you may be accounted worthy to
[29:32] escape all these things that shall come
[29:34] to pass and to stand before the son of
[29:37] man.
[29:39] Now, this puts a lot of pressure on us.
[29:41] We got to take heed to ourselves. I want
[29:43] to be sure that my heart's not being
[29:44] overwhelmed because there's going to be
[29:45] a snare of surfing and drunkenness and
[29:47] cares of this life that are going to
[29:48] come upon man that I'm going to be able
[29:49] to recognize the signs of his coming.
[29:51] Not going to be able to recognize uh the
[29:52] signs of darkness. So, he says, "Watch
[29:54] ye therefore." Then he gives us some
[29:55] clues. Pray
[29:57] that you may be accounted worthy to
[29:59] escape all these things that shall come
[30:01] to pass and stand before the son of man.
[30:03] So, there is a a question. Can we be
[30:06] worthy to escape? It says, "Pray." Okay,
[30:08] pray. I'm going to pray that I'll be
[30:10] counted worthy. But, you know, I I
[30:12] pretty much promise you that if you just
[30:13] think praying is going to make you
[30:15] worthy. If you're really sincere, you're
[30:17] going to start saying, "Well, then how
[30:18] do I pray?
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Do I just merely pray that I'm worth
[30:21] worthy? And if I'm praying that I'm
[30:22] worthy to escape, how am I going to know
[30:23] that I escaped? How do I know that I'm
[30:26] not just dumbing myself down? How do I
[30:28] know I'm not just doom scrolling
[30:30] religiously?"
[30:32] But he says that we can conduct
[30:34] ourselves in such a way that we may be
[30:36] counted worthy to escape.
[30:42] 1 Thessalonians 5:es 1:3 it says, "But
[30:44] at the times and the seasons, brethren,
[30:46] you have no need that I write unto you."
[30:50] And and I and I could have just imagine
[30:52] maybe somebody reading that said, "Uh,
[30:54] is this a game of clue? I I don't know
[30:57] that I know just exactly what's the
[30:59] what's the game we play? Is it chameleon
[31:00] or something like that where there's a
[31:02] bunch of words, everybody knows what it
[31:03] is, but there's somebody in the group
[31:04] that doesn't know the the they don't
[31:05] have the key to cipher the grid and so
[31:08] everybody kind of gives a one-word clue
[31:09] and they just kind of pretend. Yeah, we
[31:12] know the times and seasons. Yeah. You
[31:14] know, things coming out of the air. Yep.
[31:17] You know, you dress appropriately and
[31:18] you just start being very generic about
[31:20] the times and season. But it says, you
[31:21] know, I have no need to write you. For
[31:23] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[31:25] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[31:27] night.
[31:30] Okay, now that's that that I think that
[31:32] should be somewhat concerning. Jesus
[31:33] said that we got to take heed to
[31:34] ourselves lest we become overwhelmed and
[31:36] the day of the Lord come and this time
[31:38] come where we're so completely
[31:40] overwhelmed with the darkness that we're
[31:41] unable to catch the light. So he says
[31:43] pray that you may be kind of worthy to
[31:44] escape. He says, "We need to know
[31:46] perfectly that the day of the Lord comes
[31:47] as a thief in the night, unannounced,
[31:51] &gt;&gt; hidden, secretly,
[31:53] &gt;&gt; where the only the only knowledge that
[31:55] you have that he's come is when you
[31:58] experience the loss of him having
[32:00] visited without being known."
[32:03] &gt;&gt; For when they shall say, "Peace and
[32:05] safety," then sudden destruction cometh
[32:07] upon them as a travail upon a woman with
[32:09] child, and they shall not escape. one
[32:13] class of people deemed worthy to escape.
[32:15] It says, "Pray that you be deemed
[32:16] worthy." Perhaps they take heed to
[32:18] themselves and their hearts are not
[32:20] overcharged or overwhelmed with the
[32:22] intoxications and the inappropriate hack
[32:25] of modesty and the cares of this life
[32:27] and they find themselves able to
[32:28] recognize
[32:30] the day of the Lord. And therefore,
[32:33] they're counted worthy to escape. But
[32:34] there's those that are going to be left
[32:36] behind. Borrow Brother Lehee's book of
[32:38] his title of his book. They're going to
[32:39] be left behind.
[32:43] Now, I'm wanting this to get a bit uh to
[32:46] shed more light in this sermon. You go
[32:49] get to the key, brother Aaron.
[32:52] It's the key of G for Jesus
[32:55] because the way of escape from darkness
[32:57] and death is promised in the scripture
[33:00] in this escape room in this labyrinth
[33:02] and all this religious menagery that's
[33:05] all around us. Did you know there's not
[33:07] just one Christian religion? There's not
[33:09] just one Protestant religion.
[33:12] There's 10,000 Christian different
[33:14] denominations. Maybe just Protestant
[33:16] ones.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; So there's this is a lot of voices.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; But the Bible tells us there going to
[33:23] there's going to be a key. There's got
[33:24] to be a key. So I can figure this out.
[33:26] Religion has become a cipher. Religion's
[33:28] become a labyrinth.
[33:30] It's coded. They have special phrases
[33:32] they use. They have certain secret
[33:33] handshakes. And those who belong to the
[33:35] Illuminati,
[33:37] you know, they know exactly what one
[33:38] another are thinking. And they have all
[33:40] these secret tunnels that they travel.
[33:41] And and I'm just joking right now, but
[33:43] some people really believe in it. But in
[33:45] Psalms 107:es 10 to14, such as sit in
[33:48] darkness and in the shadow of death,
[33:50] being bound in affliction and iron
[33:51] because they rebelled against the words
[33:53] of God and condemned the counsel of the
[33:56] most high. So what? Why are they in
[33:57] bondage? Why are they in the labyrinth,
[33:58] the maze, the dungeon? Why are they in
[34:01] in darkness, in the shadow of death,
[34:03] being bound in chains and affliction of
[34:05] iron? Because they rebelled against the
[34:07] word. They disregarded the most high.
[34:10] When God made himself known, they chose
[34:12] not to regard him as God. They may have
[34:14] called him a deity. They may have called
[34:15] him a god, but they didn't recognize
[34:17] that there was a one true God making
[34:20] himself known. And they chose not to
[34:21] retain him in this knowledge or seek the
[34:23] truth of him, their own imaginations.
[34:26] They condemned the council of the most
[34:28] high. Says, "Therefore, he brought them
[34:30] brought down their heart with labor.
[34:31] They fell down and there was none to
[34:33] help." This is a hopelessness.
[34:37] It says, ' Then they cried unto the Lord
[34:38] in their trouble, and he saved them out
[34:39] of their distresses. Take heed to
[34:41] yourselves.
[34:43] Recognized recognize when you're in a in
[34:46] affliction and iron.
[34:48] Recognize when your own rebellion and
[34:50] your contempt for God has brought your
[34:52] heart low and there's none that can help
[34:54] you. So that in your distress, you can
[34:56] cry to the Lord and he can save you.
[34:58] And it says in verse 14, he brought them
[35:01] out of darkness and the shadow of death
[35:04] and break their bands and sunder.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Those that sat in darkness, those that
[35:09] were under the shadow of death, those
[35:10] that were in prison, he broke the
[35:12] chains. And that's why the verse 15
[35:13] says, "Give praise to the Lord
[35:16] &gt;&gt; for when we were in prison." When we
[35:17] were in darkness and and there was none
[35:19] that could help us and we had rebelled
[35:21] ourselves and we had sinned against the
[35:23] most high. He brings them out of
[35:24] darkness in the shadow of death. And he
[35:26] breaks the chains that bind them. In
[35:29] Isaiah 42:es 1-7, behold my servant whom
[35:32] servant whom I uphold, mine elect, and
[35:34] whom my soul delightth. I have put my
[35:36] spirit upon him. He shall bring forth
[35:37] judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not
[35:40] cry nor lift up, nor cause his voice to
[35:42] be heard in the street. A bruised reed
[35:44] shall he not break, and the smoking
[35:46] flack shall he not quench. He shall
[35:47] bring forth judgment unto truth. He
[35:50] shall not fail nor be discouraged till
[35:51] he has set up judgment in the earth and
[35:53] the isisle shall wait for his law. Thus
[35:55] saith God the Lord. He that created the
[35:57] heavens and stretched them out. He that
[35:59] spread forth the earth and that which
[36:00] cometh out of it. He that giveth breath
[36:02] unto the people upon it and spirit to
[36:04] them that walk therein. I the Lord have
[36:06] called thee in righteousness and will
[36:08] uphold thine hand and will keep thee and
[36:10] give thee for a covenant of thy people
[36:13] for a light of the Gentiles
[36:18] to open the blind eyes to bring out the
[36:21] prisoners from the prison and them that
[36:23] sit in darkness out of the prison house
[36:25] the dungeon prison house an enclosure an
[36:28] escape an escape room that you can't get
[36:32] out of
[36:34] and this is not to the Jews is this is
[36:36] to the Gentiles. This is the mystery of
[36:38] the Old Testament. This is the mystery
[36:40] of God. In the Old Testament, it wasn't
[36:42] a mystery that God had chose Israel. In
[36:45] the Old Testament, it wasn't it wasn't a
[36:47] mystery that God was with the with
[36:48] Israel. Even the heathens testified to
[36:50] it. The mystery of God is the
[36:52] relationship he prophesied to the
[36:54] Gentiles.
[36:56] And here he's saying, "I'm going to open
[36:57] the Gentiles eyes. I'm going to bring
[36:58] them out of prison. And those that sit
[37:01] in darkness will bring out of the prison
[37:03] house.
[37:04] The way out of this prison house is
[37:07] Christ.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; That's what's spoken of in Psalm. That's
[37:10] what's spoken of in Isaiah 42.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Christ is the key.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Christ is the only key out of darkness.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; You can say, "Well, I believe divine
[37:19] healing is." Okay, divine healing. But
[37:21] what is a divi a divine healer if you
[37:24] don't know Christ?
[37:26] It's the only reason we are are healed
[37:28] is through Christ.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; So I I I just I just want blessings from
[37:33] God. I want him to bless me. Okay, get
[37:35] the blessings. Get the gifts. Get the
[37:36] outpourings. But Christ is the only key.
[37:38] He's the only way out of the darkness.
[37:40] He's the only one out of Plato's cave.
[37:42] He's the only one to make make sense of
[37:43] all the sophist. He's the only way to
[37:46] dispel all the shadows. He's the only
[37:48] way to know the truth from a lie. He's
[37:50] the only one who can get you out of
[37:52] error.
[37:54] Amen.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; If we want to know peace, you got to
[37:57] know Christ. You want to know truth, you
[37:58] have to know Christ.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; I'll even say this and we'll come to it
[38:01] in a minute. If you want to find God,
[38:03] you're going to have to find Christ.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; In First John 4:es 1-3, "Beloved, ble
[38:09] not every spirit." We read this earlier.
[38:11] So, we know there's a lot of spirits.
[38:12] But try these spirits whether they are
[38:14] of God because there's a lot of ungodly
[38:16] spirits. It must be tried because many
[38:19] false prophets are gone out into the
[38:21] world.
[38:24] And he says, "Hereby know ye the spirit
[38:26] of God." So now he's going to give us a
[38:28] a key, so to speak. There's false
[38:30] spirits, false prophets, and and this is
[38:33] how you're going to know the spirit of
[38:35] God. Every spirit that confessth that
[38:37] Jesus has come in the flesh is of God.
[38:39] That seems very simple.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Very simple. So we just want to ask, can
[38:44] you confess that Jesus Christ has come
[38:45] in the flesh? And you could say, I
[38:47] confess that Jesus Christ has come in
[38:48] the flesh. And we say, I say you're of
[38:51] God. Right?
[38:52] and and and do the spirit bay on them
[38:54] and say, "You've got it, man. You've got
[38:56] the spirit." It sounds as if it's that
[38:58] easy, but what it's saying is that and
[39:00] every spirit, verse three, that
[39:01] confessth not that Jesus Christ has come
[39:03] in the flesh is not of God. And this is
[39:06] that spirit of antichrist wherever you
[39:08] have heard that it should come and now
[39:10] even now already is in the world.
[39:14] So there is a spirit of antichrist that
[39:17] will deny Christ in flesh.
[39:20] Not just deny Christ, but deny that he's
[39:22] come in flesh,
[39:24] &gt;&gt; deny the living reality of Christ,
[39:27] &gt;&gt; in other words, we could come up with
[39:29] compendiums of documents in every
[39:31] language and actually be able to tap in
[39:33] to the sound waves in this world and use
[39:36] science and technology that recreates an
[39:39] actual image, live image by tri time
[39:41] travel of Jesus of Nazareth performing
[39:44] miracles and everyone could agree that
[39:46] Jesus Christ had come and was in the
[39:49] flesh. But that wouldn't be proof that
[39:51] it's the spirit of God. It's the living
[39:53] reality that Jesus Christ, which is the
[39:55] word of God that makes God present, is
[39:58] in flesh.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Where is he?
[40:03] &gt;&gt; How can we know him? Wouldn't you want
[40:05] to know him?
[40:07] Jesus Christ is in flesh.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; But if they confess not, that's
[40:12] Antichrist.
[40:14] If anyone tells you that Jesus Christ is
[40:16] not in flesh today, that's Antichrist.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; I'm just reading the Bible. I maybe I
[40:22] should soften that up a little bit from
[40:24] the the New Amplified version. It's
[40:26] possible somebody who says Jesus Christ
[40:28] is not in the flesh that they use
[40:30] different terminologies
[40:32] such as quadbinary messiahs.
[40:38] And it's like, oh, okay, that doesn't
[40:40] make sense. But does that mean eight?
[40:42] I'm confused. And it might just
[40:45] completely try to change the picture
[40:46] picture. But the Bible's very specific.
[40:47] If you don't believe Jesus Christ is in
[40:49] flesh,
[40:50] and that's the challenge. If you believe
[40:52] he's in flesh, wouldn't you want to get
[40:53] close to him somewhere?
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you want to know where he was?
[40:56] Where he's manifesting himself, where
[40:57] he's making himself known
[40:58] &gt;&gt; where the spirit of God is.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Christ is the key.
[41:05] Can we agree? I want us to agree right
[41:06] now. I'm not going to hold you to this.
[41:07] We're not taking pictures. We're not
[41:09] going to use facial recognition. So if
[41:10] one day you deny Christ, you just be
[41:12] able to bring it up, start posting spam
[41:13] in your wall on Facebook, here you are
[41:17] September 3rd, 20-25, saying, "I believe
[41:19] in Jesus."
[41:22] But we can agree Christ is the key.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Just by reading the Bible, anyone should
[41:28] be able to intellectually conclude that
[41:30] Christ is the key.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 22:22, "And the key of the house
[41:35] of David will lay upon his shoulder. So
[41:37] he shall open and none shall shut and he
[41:39] shall shut and none shall open. It's
[41:40] what I try to teach my children. If I
[41:42] shut something, don't open it. If I open
[41:44] it, don't shut it. And I realize real
[41:46] quick, I don't have that kind of key,
[41:48] right? I turn on a light, next thing I
[41:50] know, someone comes in, turns it off. I
[41:52] open the blinds, next thing I know,
[41:53] someone comes in, rolls down the blinds.
[41:54] I'm like, what am I? To borrow the words
[41:56] of brother Andy Snow, what am I? Chop
[41:57] liver? You know, it's like it just I I
[42:00] want it a certain way and it doesn't
[42:02] happen. But Christ is the one who has a
[42:04] key that if he opens it, none can shut
[42:06] it. And if he shuts it, none can open
[42:08] it.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; That's quite the key.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Revelations 1:18 says, "I'm he that
[42:12] liveth and was dead, and behold, I am
[42:14] alive forever more." Amen. And have the
[42:15] keys of hell and death.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Christ is the key.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; All right. So now, let's just say we all
[42:21] have the key. We can at least write it
[42:23] down. Christ is the key. He was given
[42:25] this key. This government, this power
[42:27] lays upon his shoulder. He has the keys
[42:29] to hell and death. We can all have this
[42:31] key. But listen, listen to me very
[42:32] carefully. All of us, young people
[42:34] especially, brother Ben, you're even
[42:36] you're old enough to get this. And let
[42:39] me have your hair, please. I ask him
[42:40] every time I see him, save that for me
[42:42] somehow. Beautiful hair.
[42:47] But you can't use this human knowledge
[42:50] like you would in a human escape room.
[42:54] We We could treat the Bible as if we
[42:56] found we've unlocked the key. Well, it's
[42:58] Jesus Christ. All you got to do is take
[42:59] this chair, orient it this way, and then
[43:01] when you sit in it, you'll be able to
[43:02] see the shadow of the grandfather clock,
[43:04] and it's going to show you what number
[43:06] you need to push on the keypad, and
[43:07] boom, we're out. It doesn't work that
[43:09] way.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; You can know the key just by reading the
[43:13] scriptures. I can prove to you
[43:15] absolutely without a shadow of doubt
[43:17] that Christ is the key according to
[43:19] certain scriptures. Somebody might turn
[43:21] right around and say, "Nope. Uh-uh. Paul
[43:23] made that up.
[43:25] Twist it another way and turn it another
[43:27] way." But even if Christ is the key and
[43:29] you believe he's the key, biblical
[43:30] intellectual knowledge isn't enough.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Second Corinthians chapter 3:6, "Who
[43:37] also hath made us able ministers of the
[43:38] New Testament, not of the letter, but of
[43:40] the spirit. For the letter kleth, but
[43:42] the spirit giveth life."
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Christ is the key. He's the one that has
[43:47] the power to open and shut.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; He's the one that has power of hell and
[43:53] death.
[43:54] Christ is the key. But there's a
[43:56] different deeper element than just
[43:57] knowing the fact that Jesus Christ is
[44:00] the son of God.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12:es 2 to three. Ye know
[44:06] that you were Gentiles. I love this. All
[44:09] the Gentiles here. Really lean into this
[44:10] tonight. Ye were Gentiles carried away
[44:13] under these dumb idols even as you were
[44:15] led.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Using dumb there in a manner which not
[44:19] necessarily we like to use it with each
[44:20] other, but they couldn't speak. They had
[44:21] no life.
[44:24] Wherefore I give you to understand that
[44:26] no man speaking by the spirit of God
[44:29] calleth Jesus a cursed.
[44:32] So the spirit of God confesses that
[44:34] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. If
[44:36] any man says that he has not come in the
[44:38] flesh that is antichrist.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; They're to deny him in the flesh in the
[44:43] days of in the days of his earthly
[44:45] ministry clearly antichrist. But just to
[44:47] accept a historical Jesus doesn't make
[44:48] you the spirit of God.
[44:50] I give you to understand that no man
[44:52] speaketh by the spirit of God and call
[44:54] that Jesus a curse and that no man can
[44:56] say that Jesus is the Lord but by the
[44:59] Holy Ghost.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Everything changes now.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; You can say Jesus Christ is Lord because
[45:06] your Sunday school teacher told you
[45:07] that. You can say thou art the Christ,
[45:09] the son of the living God. But you may
[45:11] just be saying it because you heard the
[45:12] demons that were cast out of Peter's mom
[45:14] say it.
[45:16] You could just be repeating what
[45:17] somebody else said or just repeating
[45:19] what you've been taught. But you don't
[45:21] know know Jesus Christ is the Lord
[45:24] except the Holy Ghost in you can say
[45:27] Jesus Christ is the Lord.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; That means we can know things as
[45:33] Christians that are beyond what they
[45:35] know by science, what they know by
[45:37] academics, what they know by
[45:38] intellectual study,
[45:41] &gt;&gt; what they know by academic endeavor.
[45:43] They must, if they're intellectually
[45:45] honest, admit that they could be wrong.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; No matter how much microfish they read,
[45:50] no matter how much they study and how
[45:52] much they tear things apart, if they're
[45:54] intellectually honest, what they have
[45:56] gained by human research, by human
[45:58] effort, by mathematics and calculation,
[46:00] if they're being honest, they could say,
[46:02] "But I could be wrong."
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Exactly. But if you know that Jesus is
[46:08] the Lord by the Holy Ghost, it's
[46:11] absolutely impossible for you to be
[46:14] wrong because God has revealed himself
[46:16] to you.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's
[46:17] &gt;&gt; right.
[46:22] In Luke 10:es 21 to 20 and 22. In that
[46:27] hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said,
[46:28] "I thank thee, oh father, Lord of heaven
[46:30] and earth, that thou hast hid these
[46:32] things from the wise and prudent and
[46:33] hast revealed them." This is a dirty
[46:35] word to a lot of people. Revealed them
[46:37] unto babes. They don't believe in
[46:38] revelation.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Even so, father, for it seemed good in
[46:42] thy sight. They want you to be they want
[46:43] to create a formulas in this exodus so
[46:45] you can look in the scripture, look at
[46:47] it historically, look at its original
[46:48] meaning. It's like it's the
[46:49] constitution.
[46:51] And they want to have a a panel of nine
[46:53] justices that are going to go in and
[46:54] look at originalism and original intent
[46:58] and tell you and make a decision. This
[46:59] is what he meant. But Jesus is saying, I
[47:02] haven't I I don't do it that way. I
[47:03] don't do it by consensus.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; It's revealed.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; This is what pleases God. Verse 22. All
[47:10] things are delivered to me of my father.
[47:12] That father is God. The one that
[47:14] stretched out the heavens, as Isaiah
[47:15] said, the one that spread the earth. All
[47:19] these things are delivered to me of my
[47:20] father. And no man knoweth who the son
[47:22] is, but the father. This is in your red
[47:25] letter.
[47:27] Okay, this is in the red letter. How
[47:30] many times have you been trying to
[47:30] witness to somebody and they and you and
[47:32] you're reading black scriptures and
[47:34] they're like, "Ah, I want to see it in
[47:36] the red letter." Right? A lot of people
[47:38] want to see it in the red letter and it
[47:40] would make for a very small Bible.
[47:42] But this is Jesus saying, "No man knows
[47:45] who the son is but the father." So
[47:47] that's an exclusive knowledge
[47:49] &gt;&gt; between the two. And no one knows who
[47:52] the father is but the son. So now you
[47:54] have created exclusive knowledge. The
[47:56] father to the son and son to the father.
[47:58] Nobody else knows and he to whom the son
[48:02] will reveal him.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[48:04] &gt;&gt; There is one God who revealed himself
[48:07] through his son and they have a oneness
[48:10] that nobody else can know though he's
[48:13] there in flesh. When you've seen me
[48:14] you've seen the father but there's this
[48:16] mystery that's there but he says but
[48:18] those the only one who will know the
[48:20] father the only way that you can know
[48:21] the father is through the son Jesus
[48:24] Christ when he reveals the father to
[48:27] you. Right.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; No one knows God except Jesus Christ,
[48:33] the son of God, reveals him.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ reveals the father. You can
[48:38] only know God by revelation.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Who here believes in God? Raise your
[48:46] hands. This isn't easy. I like that,
[48:48] right? You cannot truly know God except
[48:51] by revelation.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; I just asked the Christian audience, how
[48:54] many here knew God? You all raised your
[48:56] hands and you we're all thinking of the
[48:58] same one most likely. You could ask a
[49:01] billion people in China
[49:03] if they believe in God. And you could
[49:06] have a a billion hands raised and there
[49:08] might be a half a billion gods they
[49:09] believe in,
[49:11] &gt;&gt; deities, spirits, powers, a god. Do you
[49:17] realize science has even evolved enough
[49:18] and they're starting to finetune some of
[49:20] their beliefs to where they kind of
[49:21] hedge a little bit and they hedge and
[49:24] and they and they have their gods, they
[49:26] have their idols and they have their
[49:27] well, you know, we can't actually prove
[49:29] there is no god. You're forcing us to
[49:31] prove a negative and that's not fair. We
[49:33] don't want that's you can't do that. You
[49:35] can't make us do that. So we will we
[49:37] will just suspend inquiry and as to
[49:39] whether or not there's a god and just
[49:40] say could be the god of gravity, the god
[49:44] of the boom, whatever it is. They they
[49:46] say they say, "Well, we'll just put it
[49:48] there."
[49:49] But to know the one true God,
[49:53] &gt;&gt; it takes a revelation.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Christ is the key then.
[49:59] But this is my I'm not looking at my
[50:02] clock. Okay. All right. See where we are
[50:04] now. It's getting late.
[50:07] Christ is the key,
[50:11] &gt;&gt; but you can only grasp him by faith.
[50:15] He's got to reveal himself to you. So
[50:18] when he reveals the father to you, it's
[50:19] not that you know he's kind of like this
[50:21] pass through like an LLC where you know
[50:24] the it's going to just pass right
[50:25] through that to you and you're going to
[50:26] be taxed, but he's the one that reveals
[50:28] the father. So it's through Jesus
[50:31] Christ, he has to be grasped, seen,
[50:34] known by revelation.
[50:36] So if you have the key, which is Christ,
[50:40] the only hand that can hold and operate
[50:44] that key is faith.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; We could all we could get everyone to
[50:50] agree that this Bible is the word of
[50:52] God. You believe in God. You believe in
[50:53] God. You believe in God. You believe in
[50:54] God. Okay. B God wrote this Bible. This
[50:56] is the key. This is the absolute.
[50:58] There's one true God. He wrote the
[50:59] Bible. And this is the key. The Bible is
[51:01] Christ. The only way to operate it, use
[51:04] it, know it, make it truly beneficial to
[51:07] you is to be able to hold it with a hand
[51:09] of faith.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; If you still hold it with intellect and
[51:12] knowledge and study and languages and
[51:13] all sorts of things, now you may be
[51:15] fiddling around with the key, but you're
[51:17] still progging in the darkness.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; You're taking a key and trying to make
[51:21] it fit somewhere, and you don't even
[51:23] know how to use it or even to hold it.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Faith is the only hand that can hold the
[51:29] key. Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews 12:es
[51:33] 22- 26,
[51:35] Paul describing where they were in that
[51:37] beginning, the genesis of the gentile
[51:38] church. You've come unto Mount Zion
[51:40] under the city of the living God, a
[51:41] heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumeral
[51:43] company of angels, to the general
[51:44] assembly, and the church of the
[51:45] firstborn, which are written in heaven,
[51:47] and to God the judge of the all, and to
[51:48] the spirits of just men made perfect,
[51:51] and to Jesus
[51:53] the mediator of the new covenant,
[51:55] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[51:57] speaketh better things than that of
[51:58] Abel.
[52:00] See that you refuse not him that
[52:02] speaketh.
[52:04] So who's going to speak? Jesus Christ.
[52:08] Refuse him not. If they refused angels,
[52:11] how can we think that we can escape if
[52:14] we refuse this great salvation?
[52:20] See that you refuse not him that
[52:22] speaketh. For if they escaped not who
[52:24] refused him that speak spake on earth,
[52:26] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[52:28] away from him that speaketh from heaven.
[52:31] He says whose voice this is prophecy
[52:33] whose voice then shook the earth and now
[52:34] he promis pro promised saying yet once
[52:37] more I shake not the earth only but also
[52:39] heaven.
[52:40] How can you escape if you refuse him
[52:43] that speaks?
[52:45] You can't. Jesus Christ is the key. How
[52:48] can you escape if you reject him?
[52:51] Ephesians chapter 1 12-14. I have a lot
[52:54] of scriptures here to use and maybe I
[52:55] should be using more and I trust that on
[52:58] a Wednesday night there's just an
[52:59] experience group that can fill some of
[53:01] these things in. He said that we should
[53:03] be to the praise. This is Paul's desire
[53:04] for this church at Ephesus that we
[53:06] should be to the praise of his glory who
[53:08] first trusted in Christ. So there's a
[53:09] trust in whom ye also trusted after that
[53:12] you heard the word of truth the gospel
[53:13] of your salvation. So the gospel of
[53:15] salvation instigates this trust. in whom
[53:18] also after that you believed you were
[53:19] sealed with the holy spirit of promise.
[53:22] So through this mechanism of gospel
[53:24] being preached, Christ this media of the
[53:26] new covenant whose voice now speaketh
[53:29] and speaketh better things, this great
[53:30] salvation, when you heard the gospel of
[53:32] your salvation, when you believed upon
[53:34] it, you're sealed with the Holy Spirit
[53:36] of promise. And that seal is the earnest
[53:38] of our inheritance under the redemption
[53:39] of the purchased possession under the
[53:41] praise of his glory.
[53:43] And that's all by faith.
[53:46] When he says by faith, by grace are you
[53:49] saved. By faith you're saved. And that's
[53:50] a gift. And this grace and this faith
[53:52] working together for salvation. It's by
[53:54] faith
[53:56] &gt;&gt; which is a gift of God.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; You can't turn it around and say, "But
[54:01] yeah, then this here is a different
[54:03] trust. This is a different experience.
[54:04] It's the same experience."
[54:07] Says it this way in Colossians chapter
[54:09] 2, I believe speaking to the general
[54:10] thought as to we've been saying take
[54:12] heed and think upon these things. He
[54:13] says, "As ye have therefore received
[54:16] Christ Jesus the Lord," how can you
[54:17] receive him? by faith
[54:19] &gt;&gt; by personal revelation. So walk ye in
[54:22] him.
[54:24] This is that continued experience. This
[54:26] is why you say take heed. Don't let your
[54:29] hearts become overwhelmed. Rooted and
[54:30] built up in him and established in the
[54:33] faith as you have been taught, abounding
[54:36] there and with thanksgiving.
[54:38] This is that this is that anchor. I'm
[54:41] rooted in him.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; No matter what's happening up here, I'm
[54:44] rooted in Christ,
[54:45] &gt;&gt; grounded in him.
[54:48] I need to be built up in him. I need, as
[54:50] I've been taught, Christ Jesus the Lord.
[54:53] Then he says in verse eight, "Beware
[54:54] lest any man spoil you through
[54:57] philosophy and vain deceit." That's to
[54:58] lead as a slay away from truth.
[55:03] Spoil you through philosophy and vain
[55:04] deceit after the tradition of men, after
[55:06] the rudiments of the world. These are
[55:07] the things that you got to watch out
[55:08] for. Philosophy.
[55:12] Philosophy asks the questions and
[55:14] they're not even sure themselves of the
[55:15] answer because it's always going to be
[55:17] posed with the little inflection.
[55:22] Could it be that we're all brains in a
[55:24] vat?
[55:26] Could it be we're just all living out of
[55:28] program?
[55:29] Could it be that the matri matrix is
[55:31] real?
[55:34] And it's always there's always this
[55:35] inflection on the end. They can they
[55:36] can't tell you truth
[55:38] &gt;&gt; if he's a real philosopher.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; They're they're they're trying to
[55:42] uncover and discover and piece things
[55:44] together. They're in their own escape
[55:45] room.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Philosophy, vain deceit, selfish deceit.
[55:51] They have something to gain by it,
[55:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Traditions of men, rudiments of the
[55:56] world, and not after Christ. The way he
[55:59] phrases this to me is so remarkable.
[56:01] Beware lest someone leads you away from
[56:04] truth as a slave through philosophy,
[56:07] deceit, tradition, and root worldly
[56:09] rudiments
[56:11] instead of spoiling you through Christ.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Beware when they use everything else but
[56:21] Christ
[56:22] &gt;&gt; to lead you away.
[56:24] Beware when all they can do is fogg you
[56:27] with philosophy, batter you with vain
[56:28] deceit, raise up questions of traditions
[56:31] of men, and use only the rudiments and
[56:33] the abilities of the world instead of
[56:37] revealing to you Christ pointing to
[56:40] Christ and Christ being the one that
[56:42] makes you a love slave. Beware of any
[56:44] man. Beware of me if I ever try to use
[56:47] something else
[56:49] &gt;&gt; to lead you than to spoil you with the
[56:52] love of Christ. to lead you away from
[56:55] worldly rudiments, lead you away from
[56:56] vain deceit, lead you away from
[56:58] philosophy and tradition, all by Christ.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chap 10 6 to15.
[57:08] I I I I'm preferring some sort of uh
[57:10] approval to continue. I'm desiring this.
[57:13] Uh and so you just express it some way
[57:16] or another either by just complete
[57:17] silence and leaving. And you're going to
[57:19] maybe someone's going to test me on
[57:20] that. All of a sudden, somebody stands
[57:22] up like, "Well, we voted. You're the
[57:24] only one that left, so we'll just stay."
[57:26] Says, "Notice this." Now, 1 Corinthians
[57:28] 10, starting with verse 6 to 15. Now,
[57:30] these things were our examples, things
[57:32] examples of people who fell away to the
[57:35] intent that we should not lust after
[57:36] evil things as they also lusted. God
[57:38] manifested himself. He revealed himself
[57:40] signs and wonders. They had testimonies.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; God did this. God did this. God this God
[57:44] preserved me here. I stayed faithful. I
[57:45] did this. I made it. I made it. I made
[57:46] it. I made it. It says, "Then they fall
[57:47] away because of lust." Lust for evil
[57:50] things. That's what the Bible says. Says
[57:52] they should be an example to you.
[57:54] Neither be you idolattors as were some
[57:56] of them. As it is written, the people
[57:58] sat down to eat and drink and rose up to
[58:00] play. Neither let us commit fornication
[58:02] as some of them committed. Now these are
[58:03] really good principles.
[58:05] And fell in one day three and 20,000.
[58:08] Neither le let us tempt Christ as some
[58:10] of them also tempted and were destroyed
[58:12] of serpents. Look at this Exodus wherein
[58:14] God made himself known. In Exodus it
[58:16] said there's a darkness that being felt.
[58:17] It said the Israelites had light in
[58:19] their dwelling.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; And the very people who experienced
[58:23] absolute light in the midst of absolute
[58:25] darkness eventually just kind of forgot
[58:27] all about that.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; And doubted and wanted to go back to
[58:31] Egypt.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Neither murmur ye as some of them also
[58:36] murmured and were destroyed of the
[58:38] destroyer. Now all these things happen
[58:39] unto them for examples and they are
[58:42] written for admonition upon whom the
[58:44] ends of the world are come. It was
[58:47] written for you, brother Martin. You
[58:50] &gt;&gt; right. All of you.
[58:53] It's written for us.
[58:56] They told us the story of the Exodus and
[58:58] the signs and wonders and miracles to
[59:00] recognize that many people can start.
[59:02] But if there's something the Bible
[59:04] Hebrews said, not being mixed with
[59:05] faith, it never profited them.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; So it says, "Wherefore let him that
[59:09] tinkketh he standeth take heed lest he
[59:12] fall."
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Take heed if you think
[59:17] you stand
[59:19] &gt;&gt; if you think you can stand in the middle
[59:21] of Satan's eating the the the god of
[59:23] this evil age's great escape room and
[59:26] you figured it out and I'm going to bird
[59:29] dog this. I think I found a little bit
[59:30] of breadcrumbs here. I'm going to bird
[59:31] dog this. I'm going to find that. I
[59:33] think I could figure my way. I've been
[59:34] banging around in this escape room for
[59:36] 50 years and I've got it memorized like
[59:38] the back of my hand. And you think
[59:41] you're going to be able to figure out?
[59:42] He says take key lest you fall.
[59:45] That's right.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; That that's a clear stark warning.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; But the next sentence to me
[59:53] is
[59:55] so rich
[59:57] because you think this is a tremendous
[59:59] rebuke. Listen, you who are going to
[1:00:01] you're going to sit down to be
[1:00:02] idolattors. You're going to be those
[1:00:04] that commit fornication. You're going to
[1:00:05] be those that tempt Christ. You're going
[1:00:06] to be those that murmur.
[1:00:08] And these are examples so that you don't
[1:00:10] fall away. And you that think you stand,
[1:00:12] take heed lest you fall. Hey, read the
[1:00:13] next verse. There hath no temptation
[1:00:15] taken you but such as common to man.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Listen, when we are tempted, we are
[1:00:23] tempted like everyone else is tempted.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; And when men fall to temptation,
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; it's a temptation you're subject to.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Be careful. If you see somebody wanting
[1:00:34] to go, you know, falling away and you
[1:00:36] can have all sorts of hot sports
[1:00:38] opinions about the people who make
[1:00:39] decisions that you wouldn't make. Be
[1:00:41] careful.
[1:00:43] Be careful what you have to say about
[1:00:45] that
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; because if you think you stand it at
[1:00:48] all, the temptation that took them,
[1:00:51] you're subject to as well.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; But grace is grace is extended. But God
[1:00:56] is faithful.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; God is faithful. Who will not suffer you
[1:01:01] to be tempted above that you are able.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. God's saying there's there's a
[1:01:05] point where he says enough. God is a God
[1:01:07] of boundaries. There's a point where
[1:01:08] he'll say enough.
[1:01:10] enough.
[1:01:12] And and there's a there's a there's a
[1:01:14] thought here where he says, "But will
[1:01:15] with the temptation also make a way of
[1:01:17] escape that you may be able to bear it."
[1:01:19] So now God will not tempt you beyond
[1:01:21] that which you're able to bear. How is
[1:01:23] it that God tempts us, but he doesn't
[1:01:25] allow to go beyond what we're able to
[1:01:27] bear? He gives us an outlet or a way of
[1:01:31] escape. So if you don't take the way of
[1:01:34] escape, it's by your own choosing
[1:01:36] wherein you're led away of your own lust
[1:01:38] and enticed. And you can't say that God
[1:01:40] tempted you to sin. You just didn't take
[1:01:43] the way of escape.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Well, I was tempted and I fell and this
[1:01:47] happened and God said he wouldn't tempt
[1:01:48] me above that which I was able to bear
[1:01:50] and able to escape. And you could say,
[1:01:52] "Yeah, that's a good point." You know,
[1:01:54] God God made me a promise that I I
[1:01:57] wouldn't be tempted to yell
[1:02:01] so much to where I actually yell. I'd be
[1:02:02] tempted or I wouldn't do this. And he
[1:02:04] said he promised. And so I've got to
[1:02:06] decide now that either God's word's not
[1:02:07] true or he or it didn't apply to me and
[1:02:09] all this confusion. And he's saying,
[1:02:10] "You're reading it wrong. You're reading
[1:02:12] it wrong. You're reading it wrong." You
[1:02:13] were tempted to your limit.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; And at your limit, you should know I
[1:02:19] always provide a way of escape.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; There's always an out.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; That you'll be able to bear it.
[1:02:29] The temptation may still be there,
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; but when you take the way out,
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; you can bear it.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Says, "Wherefore, my dearly beloved,
[1:02:37] flee from idolatry." Remember that
[1:02:41] resonance with God, with good is more
[1:02:43] powerful
[1:02:45] than resistance to evil.
[1:02:48] It's better to know the way of escape
[1:02:49] than to think you can stand it yourself.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; I speak as a wise men, he says. So,
[1:02:55] judge ye what I say.
[1:03:00] In second Peter chapter 2 18 to22
[1:03:07] he says for when we speak for when they
[1:03:09] speak great swelling words of vanity
[1:03:11] they alert through the lust of the flesh
[1:03:12] through much wantingness.
[1:03:14] I read this because he says beware lest
[1:03:16] you be spoiled through philosophy vain
[1:03:18] deceit and the traditions of men and the
[1:03:19] rudiments of the world. But I'm reading
[1:03:20] this because this is our present reality
[1:03:22] and darkness with many spirits and false
[1:03:24] prophets and winds and slights and
[1:03:26] craftiness all kinds of voices.
[1:03:30] And they alert through the lust of the
[1:03:31] flesh through much wantness. They create
[1:03:33] this wandering desire. They
[1:03:36] those that are he says those that were
[1:03:37] clean escape from them who lived in
[1:03:39] error. Now this is
[1:03:42] there's this idea of even this is within
[1:03:44] the Christian context. While they
[1:03:46] promised them liberty, they themselves
[1:03:48] are servants of corruption. blind
[1:03:49] leading the blind. For of whom a man has
[1:03:52] overcome of the same as he bought
[1:03:54] brought in bondage. I'm running out of
[1:03:55] time. I'm not going to expound upon
[1:03:57] those, but I'll say think about them.
[1:03:59] For of after they have escaped the
[1:04:01] pollutions of the world through the
[1:04:02] knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:04:04] Christ, they are again entangled therein
[1:04:07] and overcome. The latter end is worse
[1:04:09] with them than the beginning. It's
[1:04:11] statements like this that really cause
[1:04:13] me to
[1:04:15] because it says they knew the Lord Jesus
[1:04:18] Christ, but now they become entangled in
[1:04:20] the very things that they thought they
[1:04:22] had escaped.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; They thought they were clean, but now
[1:04:25] they're overcome. They came out. They
[1:04:29] thought they were in, but now they're
[1:04:30] back out again. This is their end is
[1:04:32] worse than the beginning. For it' been
[1:04:33] better for them to have not known the
[1:04:35] way of righteousness than after they
[1:04:36] have known it, to turn from the holy
[1:04:38] commandment delivered unto them. But it
[1:04:40] has happened unto them according to the
[1:04:41] true proverb. The dog has turned to his
[1:04:43] own vomit again and the s that was
[1:04:44] washed to her wallowing in the mire.
[1:04:48] Why you read that, brother Aaron? We
[1:04:50] don't like that word vomit.
[1:04:54] What is a sow anyways? There's a lot of
[1:04:57] questions we could have with this. But
[1:04:59] it's Peter poses this. A lot of
[1:05:01] theologians want to reject what Peter
[1:05:02] said here. They say, "Well, this is just
[1:05:03] too difficult to wrestle with. We'll cut
[1:05:06] that out."
[1:05:07] But he's saying that there's those that
[1:05:09] know but then get entangled again. And
[1:05:12] he said their their end is worse than
[1:05:14] where they started.
[1:05:17] So there's a
[1:05:20] they never let me just pose it this way.
[1:05:23] Did they have the key?
[1:05:26] And if they had it, did did they use it?
[1:05:31] Was it used properly?
[1:05:35] John 10:es 1:5. I'm almost done here.
[1:05:38] Just a couple more scripture readings.
[1:05:40] Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[1:05:42] enterth not by the door into the
[1:05:43] sheepfold, but climbth up some other
[1:05:45] way, the same as a thief and a robber.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:05:49] be careful who climbs in
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; who gets your ear, who talks to you.
[1:05:56] Be careful those that rep say represent
[1:05:59] as sheep or pastor, teacher or one with
[1:06:01] knowledge because if they come in the
[1:06:04] wrong way, they are a thief and a
[1:06:06] robber. They cannot nurture. They cannot
[1:06:08] bring health. They cannot feed. All they
[1:06:10] can do is strip you of what you have.
[1:06:12] They are the robbers on the way down to
[1:06:14] Jericho. They'll beat you, rob you of
[1:06:17] everything, and leave you naked and half
[1:06:19] dead, but have nothing else to offer
[1:06:20] you. They've only just taken things away
[1:06:22] from you.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; They're a thief and a robber. But he
[1:06:25] that enterth in by the door is the
[1:06:27] shepherd of the sheep. That's the one I
[1:06:28] want to hear.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; To him the porter openth, and the sheep
[1:06:31] hear his voice, and he calleth his own
[1:06:33] sheep by name, and leadth them out. If
[1:06:35] you want to be safe from the thieves and
[1:06:37] robbers, you've got to know the one who
[1:06:39] entered the right way, who has a voice
[1:06:41] that resonates with you. And that's the
[1:06:43] safe voice that you can trust.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; And when he put forth his own sheep, he
[1:06:48] goeth before them, and the sheep follow
[1:06:50] him, for they know his voice. It
[1:06:52] resonates with them. They're tuned to
[1:06:53] it.
[1:06:54] They don't have spiritual amuseia. They
[1:06:57] can hear the the the sounds in the
[1:06:59] consonants and the dissonance.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; They're not looking around at the
[1:07:03] thieves and robbers and saying, "Well,
[1:07:04] you know, some shepherds you are with
[1:07:06] all these thieves and robbers." They're
[1:07:08] like, "Hey, this is our safety in the
[1:07:09] face of all these thieves and robbers."
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; That's what could be said about
[1:07:14] Christianity. You want to run the record
[1:07:16] of Christianity? It's horrible. The
[1:07:20] atrocities committed in the name of
[1:07:21] Jesus Christ, the murders, the genocide,
[1:07:24] the racism, the prejudice, even in our
[1:07:26] own country within the last hundred
[1:07:27] years, the filthy, nasty, vile things
[1:07:30] that are done in the name of the
[1:07:31] scripture,
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; thieves and robbers.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; That wasn't Christ.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; So if you know his voice, this is the
[1:07:40] inoculation. Verse five, and a stranger
[1:07:42] they will not follow.
[1:07:44] If you know that voice, you won't follow
[1:07:46] the thieves and robbers. If that voice
[1:07:49] ever gets strange to you,
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; you'll follow a whole bunch of them
[1:07:52] trying to find it again.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; If his voice ever becomes strange to
[1:07:57] you, there might be a part of you that
[1:07:59] wants to find it again. And you'll be
[1:08:01] visited by all sorts of thieves and
[1:08:03] robbers who will offer you Christ. But
[1:08:06] it'll be philosophy, deceit, rudiments.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; A stranger they will not follow, but
[1:08:14] will flee from him for they know not the
[1:08:18] voice of strangers.
[1:08:20] What does that mean?
[1:08:23] You turn a deaf ear to them.
[1:08:25] They know not the voice of strangers.
[1:08:28] Sometimes we want to familiarize
[1:08:29] ourselves so much with the false.
[1:08:32] You know, it's like when you go when you
[1:08:34] go to some of you when you've tried to
[1:08:35] buy things with counterfeit dollars and
[1:08:37] stuff, you got a 20 and it's a
[1:08:40] counterfeit 20, you know, and they don't
[1:08:42] call in an expert from the back, right?
[1:08:44] He's like, "Well, I'm an expert in fake
[1:08:46] fake notes, right?" Now, they just take
[1:08:48] out a marker and you start getting
[1:08:50] nervous
[1:08:54] because it's just a simple test.
[1:08:56] know how to spot the genuine.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; I know what the genuine will do. I
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; know what the genuine sounds like.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; I know. I I I know how it feels. I know
[1:09:05] how I know I know what it sounds like.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; They don't know the voice of strangers.
[1:09:10] I say it here that faith in the voice
[1:09:11] makes you deaf to the strangers.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; The key is Christ.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; We know that. But then if you're looking
[1:09:19] at a lineup of the usual suspects and
[1:09:21] they're all saying, "I'm Jesus. I'm
[1:09:22] Jesus. I'm Jesus. I'm Jesus."
[1:09:25] Then a natural hand can pick them all
[1:09:27] up. But only the hand of faith will grab
[1:09:30] a hold of the real one.
[1:09:34] That's what the Bible says. We've been
[1:09:35] given exceeding great and precious
[1:09:37] promises.
[1:09:39] That by these scriptures, by this word,
[1:09:41] we can partakers of divine nature.
[1:09:44] Second Peter 1:4, having escaped the
[1:09:46] corruption that is in the world through
[1:09:47] lust.
[1:09:50] It is the the lust that is in the world
[1:09:52] that drives men deeper into the cave,
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; deeper into the escape room.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; But it's the the word of God that allows
[1:10:01] us by faith to become partakers of his
[1:10:03] divine nature. Having escaped,
[1:10:07] we don't want to stay in the escape room
[1:10:09] and pretend.
[1:10:11] You want to have you want to find Christ
[1:10:13] by faith. And what does that do? It
[1:10:15] birthes you into a different experience.
[1:10:18] I think I've already I'm thinking I've
[1:10:20] read from Yeah. 1 Thessalonians chapter
[1:10:21] 5. I'm going to read to verse 11 and and
[1:10:23] we'll have the musicians come. But of
[1:10:26] the times and seasons, brethren, you
[1:10:27] have no need that I write unto you. For
[1:10:29] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[1:10:31] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[1:10:32] night. For when they shall say peace and
[1:10:34] safety, then sudden destruction cometh
[1:10:36] upon them as a travail upon a woman with
[1:10:38] the child with child, and they shall not
[1:10:40] shall not escape.
[1:10:44] Verse three, thus sayaith the Lord,
[1:10:47] there will be those who cannot escape.
[1:10:51] Verse four, but ye,
[1:10:53] are you here? Ye,
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; got the real Yees here,
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; wearing your spiritual Yeezys, but ye,
[1:11:02] brethren, are not in darkness
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; that that day should overtake you as a
[1:11:07] thief.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Listen, you are not in darkness.
[1:11:12] You ye are the children of the light and
[1:11:14] the children of the day. We are not of
[1:11:16] the night nor of darkness. Therefore,
[1:11:18] let us not sleep as do others, but let
[1:11:21] us watch and be sober. Take heed to what
[1:11:24] you hear to yourselves. Watch and be
[1:11:26] sober. For they that sleep, sleep in the
[1:11:28] night, and they that be drunken are
[1:11:29] drunken in the night. If there's someone
[1:11:30] sleeping, if someone drunken, they're
[1:11:31] still in darkness. But ye who live,
[1:11:34] you're now have been made free from the
[1:11:36] law of sin and death. You now have
[1:11:37] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:11:39] world through lust. Now you are abiding
[1:11:41] in him. You've received Christ Jesus
[1:11:42] Lord. Now being rooted and built up in
[1:11:44] him, established in the faith as you've
[1:11:46] been taught. Continue, lest anyone spoil
[1:11:48] you.
[1:11:50] [Music]
[1:11:52] But let us who are of the day be sober,
[1:11:56] putting on the breastplate of faith and
[1:11:57] love, and for a helmet the hope of
[1:11:59] salvation. For God hath not appointed us
[1:12:01] to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our
[1:12:03] Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that
[1:12:07] whether we wake or sleep, we should live
[1:12:09] together with him.
[1:12:10] [Music]
[1:12:12] Wherefore comfort yourselves together,
[1:12:15] and edify one another, even as also ye
[1:12:17] do.
[1:12:19] There is an edification for those that
[1:12:21] are awake.
[1:12:24] We can comfort ourselves together with
[1:12:26] the knowledge that we have obtained
[1:12:27] salvation by Jesus Christ our Lord. And
[1:12:30] whether we go by way of the grave or
[1:12:31] whether we are alive and remain at the
[1:12:33] time of that translation, we will all
[1:12:35] live together with him. How do you know
[1:12:37] that?
[1:12:40] How is it you know that? Is there
[1:12:43] anybody here that believes if you were
[1:12:44] to die that at in the time of the
[1:12:46] resurrection and the meeting Lord in the
[1:12:48] air that you're going to be there?
[1:12:49] Anybody here want to raise their hand
[1:12:50] and tell me that that's going to be
[1:12:51] them? Okay, a lot of hands.
[1:12:54] Anybody here believe that if you're
[1:12:56] alive at that time that you'll be caught
[1:12:57] up in the air together to meet him in
[1:12:58] the air? How do you know that?
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; How do you know that? We could be
[1:13:03] eight-year-olds in Sunday school and
[1:13:04] say, "Jesus loves me. This I know. For
[1:13:06] the Bible tells me so." And there's an
[1:13:08] evolution to that where one day you know
[1:13:10] that you know that you know that you
[1:13:12] know because it's evolved to a re
[1:13:15] revelation.
[1:13:16] And now you know.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; And though the skin worms eat this body,
[1:13:20] yet in my flesh shall I see God. What
[1:13:21] the lightning has struck in the
[1:13:23] darkness. And now you know. While you're
[1:13:24] still in Leodysa, you still may look the
[1:13:26] same. You still suffer. You get sick.
[1:13:28] There's been many glorious, Godfearing,
[1:13:30] Holy Spiritfilled believers who've gone
[1:13:33] down in death, but that was not defeat
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; because they died in the faith.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; And they knew that. They knew that they
[1:13:40] knew one day they would see him face to
[1:13:41] face.
[1:13:44] There is only one key. Do not try to
[1:13:49] twist the scripture
[1:13:51] to provide any other key other than
[1:13:53] Jesus Christ. Do not try to twist the
[1:13:56] message and conure it to say there's any
[1:13:58] other key other than Jesus Christ.
[1:14:02] And there is only one way that you can
[1:14:04] hold that key and that is by faith.
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:09] Therefore, you must by faith look to
[1:14:11] Jesus Christ as your only leader.
[1:14:14] The only way that a church like this is
[1:14:16] successful when you have a pastor or a
[1:14:19] shepherd of a local flock is when you
[1:14:21] yourselves have the chief shepherd as
[1:14:23] the shepherd of your soul, the bishop of
[1:14:25] your souls, and you're feeding on him.
[1:14:27] And that's the what that's what makes a
[1:14:29] church truly successful spiritually.
[1:14:31] Otherwise, we could just be like any
[1:14:32] other lodge or gathering of people that
[1:14:34] have some common basis or some
[1:14:36] understanding. We must by faith look to
[1:14:39] Jesus Christ as our only leader. By
[1:14:41] faith follow in his steps.
[1:14:44] By faith we must not follow any other
[1:14:46] voice.
[1:14:49] By faith we do not heed any other way.
[1:14:53] Originally when I was looking at this
[1:14:54] and studying over the last few weeks and
[1:14:58] initially when it began to resonate with
[1:14:59] me was wow faith is the key. Faith is
[1:15:02] the key. And and then I realized that
[1:15:05] Christ
[1:15:08] Christ is
[1:15:10] the ultimate
[1:15:12] Jesus Christ is and the and the only way
[1:15:15] that he has ever ever the only way I've
[1:15:18] ever connected with him was by faith.
[1:15:21] And so tonight I I I admonish you. Reach
[1:15:25] out by faith.
[1:15:28] reach out to him.
[1:15:30] Aside from everything else that may
[1:15:32] exist in the world today, you say,
[1:15:33] "Well, I want to know it this way. I
[1:15:36] want to know it that way." Well, you're
[1:15:37] still in the escape room.
[1:15:40] You're putting these parameters that I'm
[1:15:42] going to I'm going to find out. I'm
[1:15:43] going to figure this out. I'm going to
[1:15:44] figure that out. No. Jesus Christ is
[1:15:46] real. You could if you believe in God
[1:15:48] and you know there's a God, but he's
[1:15:49] never been made light to you by
[1:15:50] revelation. He's not you're not going to
[1:15:52] know truly there is a God unless he's
[1:15:54] been revealed to you. And the only way
[1:15:55] it can be revealed to you is through
[1:15:56] Jesus Christ. You should right now with
[1:15:58] a hand of faith reach out to him.
[1:16:01] Lord, I believe in you.
[1:16:04] I I I want to know you in a personal
[1:16:05] way. I want to know that the hand that
[1:16:08] holds the key is faith.
[1:16:12] Young people, that's the key. Jesus
[1:16:14] Christ.
[1:16:16] We don't know him because we believe the
[1:16:17] Bible. We don't accept him because we
[1:16:20] believe God is real. You know him by
[1:16:21] faith. because it's the only thing that
[1:16:24] can know the key. Let's stand to our
[1:16:26] feet.
[1:16:30] Been trying, and this is maybe going to
[1:16:32] discourage some of you, but for the last
[1:16:34] several services, I've been trying to
[1:16:35] keep it brief.
[1:16:38] [Music]
[1:16:39] And so, hold on if I ever say I'm going
[1:16:41] to be long tonight.
[1:16:45] And I know it's late. I know there's
[1:16:46] been a lot that we've covered, but this
[1:16:49] is an important sermon.
[1:16:52] Gracious heavenly father,
[1:16:56] Lord,
[1:16:57] when we read the Bible with our human
[1:17:00] mind, we could come to the conclusion
[1:17:01] that you made one way for salvation.
[1:17:03] There's only one name given in heaven
[1:17:05] and earth by which a man could be saved.
[1:17:08] We can see that you sent your son to die
[1:17:10] and his blood was shed for our sins and
[1:17:12] that we makes atonement for our souls.
[1:17:16] And there's is a way that we can as
[1:17:19] theologians and Bible students,
[1:17:21] teachers,
[1:17:23] construct a very clear, concise plan of
[1:17:26] salvation,
[1:17:28] a teaching from scripture, what we be
[1:17:30] believe to be biblical salvation
[1:17:34] and have gained no greater knowledge of
[1:17:37] you in the entire process.
[1:17:43] because we can only know you by you
[1:17:45] revealing yourself to us.
[1:17:49] So Lord, tonight if there's been
[1:17:50] anything deep within the heart of anyone
[1:17:52] here tonight,
[1:17:54] something beyond the noise and the
[1:17:56] voices, something in their heart was
[1:17:57] pricricked to say, "I know God is real."
[1:18:02] Then I pray that they could reach out by
[1:18:04] faith to touch you.
[1:18:08] that if they know you, Lord, in that way
[1:18:10] where Christ the key has been grasped by
[1:18:12] revelation and they are walking in
[1:18:14] newness of life. Lord, if they're being
[1:18:16] spoiled by anything other than you,
[1:18:18] Lord, may they take heed to themselves.
[1:18:22] May they recognize now that you've
[1:18:23] provided a way of escape. The way of
[1:18:25] escape is Christ.
[1:18:27] My man, the manner in which I can use
[1:18:29] Christ to escape the temptation is by
[1:18:31] faith in Christ. That's it.
[1:18:34] If I succumb to any other measure, Lord,
[1:18:36] I'm I'm brought into bondage with it.
[1:18:41] I'm brought into bondage to that
[1:18:43] temptation. Oh God, tonight I pray that
[1:18:45] you would just cry out within the hearts
[1:18:47] of these young people and all of us that
[1:18:49] are here that there is a way of escape
[1:18:51] in this last times, this dark and evil
[1:18:54] day. There's a way that we can know you
[1:18:57] and we'll never be able to know you by
[1:18:59] any other means except you reveal
[1:19:01] yourself to us. So therefore, Lord, I
[1:19:03] pray that you'll grant a revelation.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; So anchor solidly your believers in your
[1:19:08] word that though they may up here be
[1:19:10] shaking a little bit, they're rooted,
[1:19:12] solid, established in Christ.
[1:19:17] Bless us tonight, I pray in the name of
[1:19:20] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
