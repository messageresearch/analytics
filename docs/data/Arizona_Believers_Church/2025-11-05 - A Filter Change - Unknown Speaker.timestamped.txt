[0:00] My title this evening is a filter
[0:02] change. And we'll kind of explore just
[0:05] exactly what we mean by this as we go
[0:07] forward. I think there's going to be
[0:08] some things that'll be pretty obvious to
[0:10] you, but a filter change. We're kind of
[0:12] looking at changing your filter. I don't
[0:14] know if anybody here changes their oil.
[0:16] Uh some people do, and I always joke
[0:19] that that's why I have a job is so I can
[0:20] pay professionals to do stuff like that.
[0:22] But admire people who can change their
[0:24] oil and the filter while they're at it.
[0:26] But if we could just look at verse 33,
[0:29] I'd like to just jump right into it
[0:30] tonight. It says, "No man when he hath
[0:32] lighted a candle putteth it in a secret
[0:35] place." In other words, nobody else has
[0:38] access to it. Uh it's hidden, neither
[0:40] under a bushel, but on a candlestick
[0:43] that they which come in may see the
[0:45] light. Uh just a couple things right at
[0:48] the very beginning is just to think
[0:49] about some of these things that are
[0:50] quite obvious. But light has power,
[0:53] illuminating power, and light has a
[0:55] purpose. He's saying nobody lights a
[0:57] candle just to put it in a closet or
[0:59] hide it, but they light it because
[1:01] there's darkness and it needs to give
[1:02] light. It needs to express. And so he
[1:05] says that you don't e even put it under
[1:08] a bushel. So that would be some means of
[1:10] uh diminishing the light. So a bushel
[1:12] will dim the light. It'll darken that
[1:15] light. And there's a lot of different
[1:17] bushels that we could call out tonight.
[1:18] I know in the message of the hour,
[1:20] brother Brandham refers to
[1:21] denominationalism and traditions. And
[1:23] the scripture shows us a lot of things
[1:24] that hinder or restrict the light. But I
[1:27] wanted to read this statement from the
[1:29] masterpiece. A sculptor wouldn't make a
[1:31] great masterpiece and then take it and
[1:33] set it in an alley somewhere or hide it
[1:35] behind buildings. As our Lord told us, a
[1:37] man doesn't light a candle and put it
[1:39] under a bushel. When we become God's
[1:42] masterpieces, we're not hid in an alley
[1:44] somewhere. We must give light. And I was
[1:48] reminded by brother Lucas uh just before
[1:50] service that I never finished Sunday
[1:51] morning service. And I completely forgot
[1:53] all about that in preparing for this
[1:55] service. Uh but one of the things that I
[1:57] was going to finish up on Sunday
[1:58] morning, maybe we'll just carried it
[1:59] over to next Sunday is that we we must
[2:02] be serious about this calling to express
[2:04] the light, to express Christ. And so God
[2:07] has not done what he's done in you and
[2:09] this beautiful work that he's doing in
[2:11] you. He hasn't done it so that it would
[2:12] be hid away. He hasn't done it so that
[2:14] we become very cultish and clanish and
[2:16] we just hide ourselves in the closet as
[2:18] it were, but that we are to display and
[2:21] give light.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; God has done this for a reason. He's
[2:24] begun a good work in you and he wants to
[2:25] express and manifest that work.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; In Matthew 5 14, 15, and 16, he says,
[2:31] "Ye are the light of the world." We're
[2:34] getting into that season and I some of
[2:36] you know some of you have probably
[2:37] already done it. you've dusted off your
[2:38] Christmas music collection and and and
[2:41] you're singing already about lights and
[2:43] the light of Christmas lights and joy to
[2:45] the world. The the light has come and
[2:47] those things, but now he's saying you
[2:49] are the light of the world. It kind of
[2:51] changes the perspective a little bit. A
[2:53] city that is set on a hill cannot be
[2:55] hid. So this is speaks to God wanting to
[2:58] set you forth as light. Neither do men
[3:00] light a candle and put it under a
[3:02] bushel, but on a candlestick, and it
[3:04] giveth light unto all that are in the
[3:06] house. Notice here, this is in Matthew
[3:08] chapter 5. The reading that we took in
[3:10] Luke chap 11 is a different instance.
[3:12] And so this is something a theme that
[3:14] Jesus repeated more than once. So he
[3:17] says, "Let your light so shine before
[3:19] men." So you have a light. You've been
[3:21] given uh this brilliance or this
[3:24] brightness. Let it shine before men that
[3:26] they may see your good works. So we
[3:28] could connect the brightness of our
[3:30] light to works that we do. It it this
[3:33] isn't a challenge to outdo the neighbor
[3:34] this year with your holiday lights. Uh
[3:37] and I don't know if anybody's
[3:38] competitive in that way, but we know
[3:40] some neighborhoods that's what they're
[3:42] known for is their Christmas displays.
[3:44] But we don't want to just shine at one
[3:46] time of the year. We want our lights to
[3:48] so shine. And it's through your
[3:49] attitude, your response, the way you
[3:51] live, the way you dress your good works.
[3:53] And that in living this kind of life,
[3:56] it's a drawing power because he says,
[3:58] "And glorify your father which is in
[3:59] heaven." I feel like the Lord just
[4:01] opened this scripture up to me more
[4:03] earlier this year in that it wasn't that
[4:05] people see how good of a Christian you
[4:06] are and say, "Man, God is a good God."
[4:08] But that your light brings them to
[4:11] glorifying God for salvation in their
[4:13] own life.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; That you would be a light that would
[4:16] draw others to Christ and them repenting
[4:18] of their sins would find the goodness of
[4:20] the Lord. So that we are set forth to be
[4:22] witnesses.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; We are set forth to be uh to to be light
[4:26] to the world. So we are light and we
[4:30] have not been made this brilliant light
[4:32] for it to be hid, but we are to let our
[4:34] light shine. So a man that lights a
[4:36] candle uh raises it up conspicuously in
[4:40] a way that it would give light to others
[4:41] as they come in would see the light.
[4:43] Verse 34, Lukeap 11:34.
[4:46] Now he begins to look at this
[4:49] characteristic of ourselves. How are we
[4:52] illuminated? The light of the body is
[4:53] the eye. Therefore when thine eye is
[4:56] single the whole body also is full of
[4:59] light. So this uh
[5:02] this singleness of eye just think of
[5:04] this and how it required it the
[5:07] requirement in order to be full of light
[5:09] and th when thine eye is evil thy body
[5:11] also is full of darkness. Take heed
[5:14] therefore that the light which is in
[5:15] thee be not darkness. If thy whole body
[5:18] therefore be full of light, having no
[5:20] dark part, the whole shall be full of
[5:22] light. As when the bright shining of a
[5:24] candle doth give thee light, he's
[5:28] speaking about an eternal light that we
[5:30] have that is being externally manifested
[5:33] that you are the light of the body is
[5:36] the eye. And so he's talking about the
[5:37] whole body being full of light. And and
[5:40] so it's it's referring to the expression
[5:42] of this light. So I want you to think of
[5:44] it in two ways and I hope that I could
[5:45] kind of carry this through tonight. that
[5:47] you have an inward light and then you
[5:50] have an outward light.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; And so this full enlightenment Jesus is
[5:54] saying that the the whole body shall be
[5:56] full of light. It depends on the
[5:58] singleness of your eye. In that
[6:00] singleness, it doesn't mean you want to
[6:01] poke one of your eyes out. Uh but that
[6:04] you have a simple eyesight or it means
[6:06] that it's clear. If I could kind of tie
[6:08] it into what we've ministered on the
[6:09] last couple services, it's not mixed.
[6:12] It's not impure. There's a singularity
[6:14] of vision or purpose. And so Jesus is
[6:16] referring to the soundness of eyesight
[6:19] and that if you have sound eyesight and
[6:21] you have clear vision uh in other words
[6:23] you're not looking two different ways
[6:25] &gt;&gt; and you don't have um you have
[6:27] singleness of purpose not having two
[6:29] ends in view then the whole body can be
[6:32] illuminated.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; Right?
[6:33] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 4:es 25 to 27. Let thine eyes
[6:37] look right on and let thine eyelids look
[6:39] straight before thee. It's it's there
[6:42] not this there's not this double vision.
[6:43] There's not this blurring or this
[6:45] divided this divided path. Ponder the
[6:47] path of thy feet and let all thy ways be
[6:50] established. Turn not to the right hand
[6:51] nor to the left. Remove thy foot from
[6:53] evil. This speaks to that singleness of
[6:56] eye. It means a singleness of purpose
[6:59] where you have and I think this is good
[7:01] a lot of times in work settings where
[7:03] you have some overarching theme or goal
[7:06] or some mission or objective and you say
[7:08] this is the objective that we want to
[7:10] fulfill. And when you're left with a
[7:12] decision uh with that's not clear in the
[7:14] rules or you're not sure what to do,
[7:15] measure it by your goals. Does it fit
[7:18] with your objective or the these goals?
[7:20] And so we've got to have this
[7:22] singularity of vision to say this is
[7:24] ultimately what I'm wanting to do so
[7:26] that we're not divided in our energies
[7:28] and our focus.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; Helps us com uh from turning away from
[7:32] evil. In James 1:8, it says a
[7:35] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[7:37] ways. That's that wavering or
[7:39] uncertainty. the doubting. A
[7:41] double-minded man is divided in his
[7:43] loyalties.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; He's divided in his interest. So, and
[7:48] maybe he'd be this way one moment, this
[7:49] way the next, or even in the same
[7:51] moment, he's got a double-minded man.
[7:53] And really, this speaks to a man who's
[7:55] got a lot of religion up here in his
[7:56] head, but not Christ in his heart. And
[7:58] that makes him double-minded because,
[8:00] oh, I want to serve God, but without
[8:02] being born again, it's just religion.
[8:06] 1 Timothy chapter 3:es 8 and N. Likewise
[8:08] must the deacons be grave. I didn't I
[8:11] probably should have warned the deacons
[8:12] ahead of time. But the deacons must be
[8:15] grave. That doesn't mean in the grave or
[8:17] dead. There must be a soberness to them.
[8:19] It says not double tonged, not given to
[8:22] much wine. Yeah, this was the phrase I
[8:24] came up with today. Double-mindedness
[8:25] leads to double tongedness. Should be
[8:27] the new word of the year. Double
[8:28] tongedness. It kept saying it was not
[8:30] spelled correctly. I'm assuming there's
[8:33] no such word.
[8:35] But it says that they should not be
[8:36] double tonged. That means saying one
[8:37] thing to one person and another thing to
[8:41] another.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; What does that show? This lack of
[8:43] consistency, this lack of singularity,
[8:45] not double tongue, not given to much
[8:47] wine, not greedy, a filthy lucer,
[8:49] holding the mystery of the faith in a
[8:51] pure conscience. So what does it kind of
[8:54] relate back to? that there must be this
[8:56] purity of mind, this purity of sight,
[8:58] this purity of conscience in order to be
[9:00] grave and not double tonged and not
[9:02] given over to excess as Ephraim was a
[9:05] cake not turned too much extremes.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; And so the clarity of the inward eye,
[9:11] this is what Jesus is saying and or I'm
[9:13] trying to draw this from it. The clarity
[9:15] of the inward eye uh imparts this pure
[9:18] vision, this clear and beautiful
[9:20] perceptions of of things. When your eye
[9:23] has some obstruction, then you you can't
[9:25] see clearly.
[9:28] And and also I want you to look at this
[9:30] way. Not only does it give these
[9:32] beautiful perceptions to the one who's
[9:35] seeing, but it allows for beautiful
[9:37] expressions.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; The mind or the eye filters what is seen
[9:43] and then it'll also filter what is
[9:45] expressed.
[9:46] &gt;&gt; If there's an inward light, if there's
[9:48] light coming in, a filter can stand in
[9:50] the way of that. there's light to be
[9:51] going out, it can be in the way of that.
[9:53] So the filtering of light, this is where
[9:55] I was drawing my inspiration from, but
[9:57] the filtering of light, it diffuses or
[9:58] suppresses our uh in other ways
[10:01] otherwise keeps light from shining
[10:04] perfectly or clearly. Anyone who's in
[10:06] photography knows how that these filters
[10:08] work. And I'm not talking about in the
[10:11] post-processing, but in the initial time
[10:13] of of taking a picture, uh these filters
[10:16] selectively block light. you say, "Oh,
[10:19] well, I'm going to use this filter and
[10:21] I'm going to place it on my lens so that
[10:23] it doesn't allow this certain spectrum
[10:25] of light to go through." So, it
[10:28] selectively blocks uh and reduces or
[10:30] maybe even enhances certain wavelengths
[10:32] of light. It's kind of, you might have
[10:34] noticed this by some people who use
[10:36] filtering in the post process. Uh when
[10:39] they're posting, you say, "I noticed
[10:40] that every picture that they post kind
[10:42] of has this yellow hue to it." Well,
[10:44] they found their favorite filter. And no
[10:46] matter where they are or what the
[10:48] picture is, it always maybe looks v uh
[10:50] vintage or it always looks uh has a
[10:52] certain hue to it. And that's the
[10:54] process of filtering. But I'm not
[10:56] talking about something that's done
[10:57] digitally. But I'm talking about in the
[10:59] moment where something is seen. For a
[11:01] photographer, they'll use some sort of
[11:02] glass or resin that's placed in front of
[11:04] the lens and it CONTROLS HOW LIGHT
[11:07] ENTERS the camera. I'm talking about a
[11:09] filter now that we use in ourselves
[11:12] related to if thine I be single then the
[11:14] whole body can be full of light then
[11:16] what is it what is going to cause this
[11:19] evilness of eye
[11:21] and whenever you use a filter and on a
[11:25] camera on the lens it shapes the image
[11:27] even before it's captured
[11:29] &gt;&gt; so even before the image is created
[11:31] you've already manipulated it
[11:33] &gt;&gt; even before the light strikes the lens
[11:35] you've manipulated it before it senses a
[11:38] hits the sensor or it goes on the film,
[11:40] you've changed what the picture is going
[11:42] to look like.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; Shapes the image even before it's
[11:46] captured. So the challenge I present
[11:49] tonight to all of us is what kind of
[11:51] filters are present in our lives? What
[11:54] kind of bushels do we have that are
[11:56] distorting the images that we see and
[11:59] the image that we express?
[12:02] &gt;&gt; That if we are looking at something,
[12:03] what filters have we placed between us
[12:06] and what is being expressed? So that by
[12:08] the time it hits our mind, by the time
[12:09] it hits our heart, we've already
[12:11] manipulated it to reduce certain
[12:14] wavelengths or enhance others. And like
[12:16] when you listen to a sermon and you're
[12:18] listening to it just to know just
[12:19] exactly how it's really going to hit
[12:21] your spouse and when it does, you're
[12:23] kind of like,
[12:24] &gt;&gt; right, you've put up that spousal filter
[12:26] kind of like we do it for the neighbor
[12:28] in the apartment next door, right? We
[12:30] just kind of put that resin up there and
[12:32] it's going to filter through. The only
[12:33] thing that's going to get through is the
[12:34] things that really nail the neighbor.
[12:36] And this is the way that it can be for
[12:38] us. We have these filters in our minds
[12:40] or our eye and we put on, you've
[12:42] probably heard the phrase rosecolored
[12:44] glasses.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; I can still remember the first time that
[12:47] really ever was used on me. I'm just
[12:49] skipp sharing a testimony. I don't know
[12:50] if I'm just waxing nostalgic cuz my
[12:52] parents are here, but I was working at a
[12:54] law firm in my undergrad uh before I
[12:56] went to law school and I was getting
[12:58] really close to graduating, going to be
[12:59] starting to go to law school and I was
[13:00] working at this law firm and had kind of
[13:02] come up a little bit in and what I was
[13:04] asked to do and I was overseeing summer
[13:05] interns and I was determining who would
[13:07] get job offers and so I thought I'd go
[13:09] see the partner and just ask, look, this
[13:12] is going pretty good. Do I have the
[13:14] guarantee? You know, could I have some
[13:16] sort of promise? Is there a path for me
[13:17] to get a job? uh as I go through law
[13:20] school and when I graduate and I should
[13:22] have known something was gonna happen
[13:23] when he said shut the door.
[13:27] I was like, "Okay, I shut the door." And
[13:30] he said, "I'm going to give you what I
[13:31] call my rosecoled glasses speech." And
[13:34] he slapped the rosecolored glasses off
[13:37] my face so bad
[13:39] I was like, "Can I go home now? I've
[13:41] been turned into a cow." Like, I was
[13:44] shook. And I walked out of there and I
[13:46] went right to the person I worked with,
[13:48] the parillegal that was a worked with
[13:49] this partner and I opened the door and
[13:51] they go, "What is wrong with you? You
[13:53] look horrible." I'm like,
[13:56] "Uh-huh. I I am I'm horrible." And I
[13:58] said, "Can I go home now?" I literally
[14:00] said I I pulled a Jenkins. I was like,
[14:02] "I I want a half date."
[14:04] And so I went home and I remember it was
[14:07] a Wednesday and I remember and what he
[14:09] did is he basically said, "Look, you
[14:10] want to go to law school? Let me tell
[14:11] you how horrible it is to go to law
[14:12] school. Let me tell you what's going to
[14:14] happen to you. And let me tell you
[14:15] what's going to happen to you when you
[14:16] graduate. Let me tell you how bad the
[14:17] job market's going to be. I'm going tell
[14:18] you how hard you're going to be working.
[14:20] And any any filter that I had about
[14:23] riches and about prestige and about
[14:25] power and all or what how good it was
[14:27] going to be to be a lawyer, he removed
[14:29] all the filters so I could see it for
[14:30] what it was.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; And I was so shook, so sick to my
[14:34] stomach and [snorts] so anxious. I
[14:37] remember thinking, "My dad better not
[14:39] lay an egg tonight." No. I went to
[14:41] church knowing I need to hear from God.
[14:43] And I remember my dad preached a sermon
[14:45] that didn't put rosecolored glasses back
[14:47] on, but put the eye of faith back on my
[14:50] eyes
[14:51] &gt;&gt; to where I was seeing things now not
[14:52] through another filter, BUT THROUGH THE
[14:54] FILTER OF GOD'S word so that I could
[14:56] stand and SAY, "HEY, DOES IT MATTER
[14:58] WHAT'S AHEAD of me?"
[15:00] &gt;&gt; And so, WE MIGHT HAVE THESE DIFFERENT
[15:01] FILTERS that distort what we see. But I
[15:03] also want you to understand those
[15:05] filters will distort what others see.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Right? Is there a filter we have on our
[15:09] lives where other people are looking
[15:10] say, "Man, I really want to see a
[15:11] Christian, but I'm I'm getting a certain
[15:14] spectrum or wavelength here." No offense
[15:15] to the spectrum, BUT I'M GETTING
[15:17] SOMETHING COMING through here, and it
[15:19] may not be Christ.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; So, think of this in the sense that
[15:23] filters keep light from coming through
[15:27] &gt;&gt; or it modifies the light into something
[15:31] it purely isn't.
[15:33] And the wrong kind of filter will keep
[15:36] God's light from penetrating our
[15:37] spirits.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; The wrong kind of filter keeps the word
[15:41] of God from being effective. We should
[15:42] believe the word of God is powerful.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; We should believe there's nothing wrong
[15:46] with the word, which is the seed.
[15:48] Nothing wrong with it. So, if we're
[15:49] getting we're not getting results, we
[15:51] don't question the word of God.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; Now, we can question whether or not we
[15:55] have what we have is the word of God and
[15:57] what we're believing is the word of God.
[15:59] BUT IF YOU KNOW YOU have the word, you
[16:00] don't need to manipulate it. You don't
[16:02] need to change it. You don't need to add
[16:03] to or take away. The word of God is
[16:04] perfect. It is a seed. And if it's not
[16:07] producing, THE PROBLEM IS SOMEWHERE
[16:09] ELSE, not with the word.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; And so the the these filters will keep
[16:14] God's word from penetrating our spirits,
[16:16] but then also from being shined abroad.
[16:19] In Ephesians 5 6 to14,
[16:23] once again, I'm trying to use just a
[16:24] little bit more of scriptures in the
[16:27] context. You could just see how
[16:29] applicable these things are, how
[16:30] relevant they are within the context.
[16:32] Let no man deceive you with vain words,
[16:34] those things that are empty, have no
[16:36] weight or or benefit. For because of
[16:38] these things, cometh the wrath of God
[16:39] upon the children disobedience. Be not
[16:42] ye therefore partakers with them. There
[16:44] is that uh that not mixing. For ye were
[16:48] sometimes darkness, but now are ye light
[16:50] in the Lord. Walk as children of light.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus said that you are the light of the
[16:55] world. Now we are light in the Lord.
[16:58] Therefore, if we are light, we must walk
[17:00] as children of the light. For the fruit
[17:02] of the spirit is all goodness and
[17:04] righteousness and truth. I believe we
[17:06] could connect this to the light that
[17:07] Christians emit and to the good works
[17:10] that will cause others to glorify God.
[17:14] These fruits of the spirit are goodness,
[17:16] righteousness, and truth. And we as
[17:18] lights, verse 10, prove what is
[17:20] acceptable unto the Lord, and have no
[17:23] fellowship with the unfruitful works of
[17:25] darkness, but rather reprove them. These
[17:28] are some, this is some pretty heavy
[17:29] words. You are light, and as light, we
[17:33] should be emitting light, walking in the
[17:36] fruit with the fruits of the spirit of
[17:37] goodness, righteousness, and truth. That
[17:40] we're proving what is of God. We're
[17:41] proving what is the perfect will of God.
[17:43] and that we ought not to have communion
[17:46] or uh this affection or even this
[17:48] representation with unfruitful works of
[17:51] darkness,
[17:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[17:53] &gt;&gt; And and it's not that we don't have
[17:55] anything to do with it, but we also
[17:58] reprove them.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT TO BE A TESTIMONY. THERE'S
[18:02] GOT TO BE A WITNESS that says this is
[18:03] the right way. AND IT'S BY THAT WITNESS
[18:06] THAT THAT those that are wrong are
[18:08] reproved or corrected.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the worst ways to correct
[18:12] something is just to say they're wrong.
[18:16] &gt;&gt; You know you're doing it wrong. No, I
[18:18] didn't know I was doing it wrong. You're
[18:19] absolutely doing it wrong. That's that's
[18:20] not the right way to do it. Oh, well,
[18:22] what is the right way to do it? I don't
[18:23] know. I just know that's not the right
[18:25] way. Well, I'll just keep doing it the
[18:27] wrong way until you show me the right
[18:30] way. And that's what a lot of people do
[18:31] is they just they do like they did to
[18:33] the man going down uh to Jericho. They
[18:35] beat them and rob them and strip all
[18:36] their Christianity away, all their faith
[18:38] away, and they leave them naked and half
[18:39] dead, and they don't have anything else
[18:41] to give but to take away.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; He says, "But we're to reprove them
[18:49] with goodness, righteousness, and truth,
[18:51] for it is a shame even to speak of those
[18:52] things which are done of them in secret.
[18:54] But all things that are reproved are
[18:57] made manifest by the light." Don't
[18:58] forget who he's talking to. Children of
[19:00] the light. Now, ye are light. And so we
[19:03] are that which reproves and it's done so
[19:06] by light. For whatsoever doth make
[19:08] manifest is light. So we have to make
[19:10] manifest. By making manifest we reprove.
[19:13] Wherefore he sayith awake thou that
[19:14] sleepst and arise from the dead and
[19:16] Christ shall give thee light.
[19:20] The inward light that we have if Christ
[19:22] has made us light. This inward light
[19:24] must be unfiltered
[19:26] in order to properly manifest the fruits
[19:28] of the spirit. in a kind of filtering
[19:30] keeps out uh the the goodness and
[19:32] righteousness and truth and that light
[19:35] that is in us must be unfiltered to
[19:37] reprove the fruits of darkness. If you
[19:39] put a filter in the way, what will it
[19:41] do? It it'll it won't reprove darkness.
[19:45] If if we take some filter and we're
[19:47] filtering out patience, then impatience
[19:50] isn't reproved.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Whatever whatever wavelengths aren't
[19:54] getting out, then it's not going to
[19:55] expose or bring to light. This is how
[19:57] things will just continue in people's
[19:59] lives and fester is when light isn't
[20:02] either being received or it's not being
[20:03] admitted. It allows things to hide in
[20:06] the darkness.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; So the light of God must be unfiltered
[20:10] even to try your own thoughts.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; You come to church and you put up all
[20:15] your I I think maybe you've used this
[20:17] before just how what kind of spiritual
[20:19] black belt some of us are where we come
[20:21] and we can block every move, right?
[20:23] There's no way the word's going to get
[20:24] in there and hit you because you've
[20:26] gotten so good at just blocking every
[20:27] shot.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; And so, we must have this unfilteredness
[20:30] of heart to where the word of God can
[20:32] try our thoughts, our desires, and our
[20:35] own works.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; I don't I I I don't necessarily want to
[20:39] just encourage you to go out there and
[20:40] shine, you know, 500 billion lumens on
[20:43] somebody else's life, but let it first
[20:46] shine in me
[20:48] &gt;&gt; that it might try me and reprove. I love
[20:50] the song that we sang at the start of
[20:51] the service. Search me, oh God,
[20:53] &gt;&gt; with your search light. Search me out
[20:56] with light. See if there be anything
[20:57] hidden, anything dark, and chase away
[20:59] the darkness.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; That's the beauty of light. They haven't
[21:02] invented it anything yet. That's the
[21:04] reverse of a flashlight.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Or you can just suck the light out of a
[21:07] room. It doesn't exist. But you can go
[21:09] in a dark room and turn on light and
[21:11] darkness has to flee.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; In Ephesians chapter 5, just continuing
[21:16] a little bit later in verses 25 to 27.
[21:20] But brother Brandham takes this text
[21:22] when he preaches a thinking man's
[21:24] filter. He says, "Husbands, love your
[21:25] wives even as Christ also loved the
[21:27] church and gave himself for it." So
[21:29] we're talking about some of the most
[21:30] important things that he might sanctify
[21:33] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[21:36] by the word. Hold that in mind. And this
[21:38] is the work that it produces. That he
[21:40] might present it to himself a glorious
[21:42] church.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; This is what verse 26 produces. Not
[21:44] having spot or wrinkle or any such
[21:46] thing, but that it should be holy and
[21:48] without blemish.
[21:50] And what does that? The word does.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; The word is what washes.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; It's what sanctifies and cleans. It's
[21:57] what removes spots and wrinkles. It's
[21:59] what produces holiness and this without
[22:01] blemish.
[22:03] And so this is very simple. And you know
[22:05] where I'm getting it from. The word must
[22:08] be the believer's filter.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; So we can say, well, I just I just want
[22:12] to be unfiltered. And I know I'm
[22:14] referring a little bit to being
[22:15] unfiltered, BUT NOT COMPLETELY
[22:17] UNFILTERED. You just want the right
[22:19] filter.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; You've got to have the right filter.
[22:24] You've got to the word must be the
[22:26] believer's filter because that's what
[22:28] God's filter is is his word.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; In numbers chapter 19 verses 7 8 and 9,
[22:33] it speaks of the process of once the the
[22:35] hepher's been burned and the ashes need
[22:37] to be uh taken care of and the priests
[22:39] are now going to be changing out of
[22:40] their garments that they use to offer
[22:42] this sacrifice for sin. says, "Then the
[22:44] priest shall wash his clothes and he
[22:46] shall bathe his flesh in water and
[22:48] afterward he shall come into the camp
[22:50] and the priest shall be unclean until
[22:52] the evening." So there's this purifying
[22:54] process. Once washed, then through the
[22:56] evening he can enter back into service
[22:58] on the next day. And he that burnth her
[23:00] the heer shall wash his clothes in water
[23:03] and bathe his flesh in water,
[23:07] &gt;&gt; and shall be unclean until the evening.
[23:10] I I know the chemical guys have come up
[23:12] with stuff to clean without water, but
[23:14] that's not how God works.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; No synthetics, no harsh chemicals. You
[23:19] can just wash in water. Says, "And a man
[23:21] that is clean shall gather up the ashes
[23:23] of the hepher and lay them up without
[23:25] the camp in a clean place, and it shall
[23:27] be kept for the congregation of the
[23:28] children of Israel, for a water of
[23:30] separation. It is a purification for
[23:33] sin."
[23:34] What a beautiful image of the the nature
[23:37] of God's word which is power to cleanse
[23:40] power to wash. The word of God is what
[23:42] washes you and separates out anything
[23:45] impure.
[23:46] The Bible says in Psalms IN PSALMS 119,
[23:49] YOU KNOW, HOW SHALL A young man cleanse
[23:51] his way? HOW AM I GOING TO PURIFY my
[23:52] mind and my heart and my actions, MY
[23:55] ATTITUDE TOWARDS OTHER PEOPLE? HOW AM I
[23:57] GOING TO DO IT? The Bible says, by
[23:58] taking heed according to thy word. In
[24:00] other words, BY SUBMITTING TO THE
[24:01] WASHING of the word. BY ALLOWING THAT
[24:03] WORD to water my spirit, WASH THROUGH MY
[24:05] MIND, WASH THROUGH MY THOUGHT PROCESS,
[24:07] IT has the ability of removing anything
[24:10] unclean or impure.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Whatever can be removed, it can be
[24:13] removed BY THE WORD OF GOD. AND THEN
[24:15] WHAT REMAINS is the word itself.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; So the word washes the word purifies sin
[24:22] or unbelief.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; And just as these priests would wash
[24:25] their clothes with water, wash their
[24:27] flesh in water. In Ephesians 5, this
[24:29] very image that he might wash his bride,
[24:33] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[24:34] of the water by the word. The word is
[24:37] the filter.
[24:39] It's what washes.
[24:41] It's a protection against harmful
[24:43] things. That's what that's what the
[24:46] washing is to do. The fil word of God as
[24:48] a filter protects you from harmful
[24:50] things. It's going to collect and block
[24:52] out things that are harmful, but it's
[24:53] also your access to good things.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; I I'm not But you know, maybe maybe I
[24:59] should have studied more for this
[25:00] sermon. But you know, you use the wrong
[25:03] filter on something, you can completely
[25:04] destroy it
[25:06] &gt;&gt; because a certain something needs to get
[25:08] through that.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; And it's designed in such a way to
[25:11] whatever is going to operate that engine
[25:13] or whatever is going to operate that
[25:15] that that that process, it has a filter
[25:18] that keeps the things out that'll
[25:19] inhibit it.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Uh but it's going to allow the things it
[25:23] needs to get through. And so the word of
[25:26] God is is a FILTER THAT ALLOWS THE WORD
[25:28] TO WASH you
[25:30] &gt;&gt; and it's going to let the word through
[25:31] because the word coming to your faith is
[25:33] HOW DOES FAITH COME? BY HEARING THE WORD
[25:35] OF GOD.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; And so with THE RIGHT WITH THE WORD
[25:38] FILTER, it lets the word get through but
[25:40] it's also going to keep other things
[25:42] out.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; But if you have the wrong filter, the
[25:46] word may not be getting through,
[25:48] &gt;&gt; but other things are.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; With the wrong filter, personality can
[25:52] get through.
[25:53] If anybody starts acting like me, I'm
[25:55] going to say, "Change your filter." Hey,
[25:58] you got the wrong You got the
[25:59] personality filter on. You're only
[26:00] letting personality through.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; It's got to be the word that comes
[26:03] through.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; So, it's the right filter is access to
[26:08] good things, but protection from harmful
[26:10] things.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; In uh in the sermon, a thinking man's
[26:14] filter, and brother Brennham is using
[26:17] the cigarette filter as his example.
[26:21] And what what happens with I actually
[26:23] did a little studying on cigarette
[26:24] filters. I didn't do any kind of
[26:27] experiments with it, just read. But it
[26:30] basically modifies the smoke phase
[26:32] through filtering, but then it also
[26:34] modifies the gas phase by absorption.
[26:36] And so there's these two processes that
[26:38] take place where it's going to filter
[26:40] out um particulates of smoke, but then
[26:42] it's also supposed to absorb the gases.
[26:45] And the purpose behind the filter is to
[26:48] reduce harm caused by smoking. and does
[26:50] it by what? Absorbing the gases or uh
[26:54] filtering these harmful chemicals that
[26:56] could be inhaled.
[26:57] And so in the sermon of thinking man's
[26:59] filter, one of the things that brother
[27:01] Brandham identifies very very clearly
[27:03] and it's so very very helpful for me is
[27:05] how that he connects a filter to a
[27:08] taste.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[27:11] &gt;&gt; That the filter uh has this effect and
[27:14] he's making this connection between the
[27:17] filter and what one craves and what they
[27:19] desire. He says, "We find out of our day
[27:22] that the people has got a taste." Why
[27:24] does a man smoke a cigarette? It's to
[27:26] satisfy a taste. If it was just the
[27:30] sucking, then you just put your finger
[27:31] in your mouth, right? What are you
[27:34] doing? Satisfying my urge to smoke.
[27:36] But it doesn't work. What does the woman
[27:39] smoke a cigarette for? Satisfy a taste.
[27:42] This is very simple. says, "And then if
[27:44] the church has figured out a religious
[27:46] group to get the people in there,
[27:48] they've got to have a certain kind of
[27:49] filter to GIVE THE PEOPLE THE TASTE that
[27:51] they want."
[27:53] &gt;&gt; It really does describe where
[27:54] Christianity has gone today where church
[27:57] looks more in uh more for Instagram.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; It looks like IT'S MADE TO POST
[28:03] PICTURES.
[28:05] It's branded and it's done in such a way
[28:07] to where we want we want this to be
[28:08] engaging in a theatrical
[28:11] way because it pleases the eye
[28:14] &gt;&gt; and and and you might be saying and you
[28:16] guys have gone the opposite direction
[28:18] and I'm not saying that's the right way
[28:20] to go but THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT BEING
[28:22] SO CAUGHT UP IN THAT KIND OF filtering
[28:25] &gt;&gt; and what will it ultimately speak to the
[28:27] Instagram in us
[28:29] &gt;&gt; the social media part of us that
[28:31] popularity wanting to belong the
[28:33] pretense. So they get a certain filter
[28:35] for the taste they want. So if they
[28:36] don't get any taste that they want, they
[28:39] don't want the cigarette.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Do you hear that?
[28:42] &gt;&gt; They don't get the taste they want, they
[28:43] won't they don't want the cigarette. And
[28:45] if they can't get the taste they want in
[28:47] religion, they don't take the religion.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; So if you're not if you have a taste, if
[28:52] you have some sort of leaning or
[28:54] inclination, if you're not getting that
[28:56] through your religion or through your
[28:57] church or what you want, then you won't
[28:59] you'll go try to find it somewhere.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; Right? So, in my in my my studying on
[29:04] this, I just thought I wanted to do
[29:06] somewhat not maybe not a deep dive, but
[29:08] just kind of go in the waiting pool of
[29:09] cigarette filters. And I was reading
[29:12] some studies and different things. And
[29:14] there was many different tests that
[29:15] showed that there was this reduction of
[29:17] tar in nicotine in cigarette smoke. And
[29:21] though there there was this reduction
[29:23] though there's this reduction, the
[29:25] filters were essentially ineffective at
[29:27] removing the gases to any kind of
[29:30] substantial weight.
[29:32] such as carbon monoxide. And this is
[29:34] what one of the studies said. Most of
[29:35] these measures, most of these measured
[29:38] reductions occur only when the cigarette
[29:40] is smoked on a smoking machine. And some
[29:43] of you might BE LIKE, "THAT'S UNCLE
[29:44] FRED." BUT NO, WE'RE TALKING about
[29:47] something that was made for the sole
[29:49] purpose of just drawing smoke.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; It says when smoked by a human, the
[29:57] compounds are delivered into lungs
[29:58] regardless of whether a filter is used.
[30:03] Okay. So, what you're telling me is
[30:05] there's a bunch of robots that never got
[30:07] cancer
[30:09] &gt;&gt; and because they never got cancer and
[30:12] that that whatever it was they were
[30:14] ingesting and hey, you know, robot
[30:17] number two over here hasn't coughed
[30:18] ever. And then but then it says that you
[30:21] go to smoke it and it's delivering tar
[30:23] and nicotine STRAIGHT TO YOUR LUNGS.
[30:26] SO, think of this whole image that's
[30:29] trying to be perpetuated
[30:31] that, WELL, INSTEAD OF SMOKING IS BAD,
[30:34] DON'T do it. WE COULD JUST USE A filter
[30:37] so that you could smoke. But then just
[30:39] ask yourself, why would I smoke?
[30:43] &gt;&gt; WHY WHY WOULD I DO THAT? WHAT GETS A
[30:46] PERSON TO SMOKE?
[30:48] I I'm preaching to non-smokers tonight.
[30:51] I mean, I I'm getting kind of nervous
[30:53] all of a sudden. And that that includes
[30:55] vaping.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; I'm sure there's going to be a series on
[30:58] the dangers of vaping because that's
[31:01] just another subtle way it sneaks in.
[31:03] It's just like,
[31:05] &gt;&gt; yeah, I'm good, right? No, probably not.
[31:09] There's this they've used they
[31:11] perpetuate this lie that oh, smoke
[31:14] cigarettes because the filter is going
[31:16] to protect you from anything harmful.
[31:19] Brother Bam says a thinking religious
[31:21] man's filter is the word. So, he's drawn
[31:24] from that uh the the advertisement uh
[31:27] and I'll get to it here in a moment. Uh
[31:29] that uh a thinking man's filter uh and a
[31:34] smoking man's taste.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; But he says a a religious man, true,
[31:38] genuine, pure and true. This this one of
[31:41] goodness and righteousness and truth.
[31:42] His filter is the word and it satisfies
[31:44] the holy taste that's in his heart. A
[31:47] ficky man's filter, a holy man's taste.
[31:49] And I would say this that a child of God
[31:51] is ordained. They're they're they're
[31:54] made with a craving inside of them uh to
[31:57] be born again. AND NOTHING WILL EVER
[31:59] SATISFY that unless it's the word.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; So he says, "Oh my, what are we into?"
[32:05] He says, "INSTEAD OF USING GOD'S FILTER
[32:07] FOR HIS SOUL, HE'S LETTING SATAN DECEIVE
[32:09] HIM BY SOME denomination or creed, JUST
[32:12] EXACTLY LIKE THE TOBACCO COMPANIES ARE
[32:14] DECEIVING YOU PEOPLE THAT SMOKE
[32:16] CIGARETTES." AMEN.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; NOW, we didn't know that maybe all that
[32:21] the tobacco industry is exactly what
[32:24] modern monetized Christianity has
[32:26] become, BUT IT'S ALL JUST A ADVERTISING
[32:29] CAMPAIGN to sell you a poison
[32:32] &gt;&gt; to line their pockets and to make
[32:34] themselves rich.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; The tobacco companies are deceiving you
[32:38] the same way that these are are are
[32:41] deceiving the people that smoke
[32:42] cigarettes. And that's the same tool
[32:44] that Satan is using to deceive people
[32:46] into the wrong filter.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; It's good.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; He says you just get more members.
[32:51] That's all.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; So here is I'm draw taking this from a
[32:55] study. Brother John, if you want to put
[32:57] that slide up. I had done this a number
[32:58] of years ago where I tried to find every
[33:00] place where visceroy cigarettes used
[33:03] this advertising campaign of a thinking
[33:05] man's filter and a smoking man's taste.
[33:07] I know it's difficult to see here. This
[33:09] is not AI but this is different
[33:12] industries you can say maybe someone who
[33:14] works in shipping another one who kind
[33:16] of looks like a lawyer maybe another one
[33:18] who's a a scientist another one who's a
[33:20] builder and uh maybe an astrophysicist
[33:23] there's just different industries right
[33:26] and so you have these different men here
[33:28] saying a thinking man's filter smoking
[33:30] man's taste viscery victory and it's a
[33:33] draw to say we have a filter but you're
[33:37] still you're still going to get the
[33:39] taste. But it says by the mid 1960s,
[33:44] cigarette designers realize that the
[33:46] intractability of the filter PROBLEM
[33:49] DERIVED FROM A SIMPLE FACT. THEY had
[33:50] this problem with the filter is not
[33:52] solving our problems. We cannot undo
[33:54] this. Here's the simple fact. That which
[33:56] is harmful in mainstream smoke and that
[33:59] which provides the smoker with
[34:00] satisfaction are essentially one and the
[34:04] same.
[34:10] Just letting that marinate a little.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Let's put a filter on it to keep the bad
[34:16] stuff out. And then as soon as you put a
[34:18] filter on it, it's like, I'm not
[34:20] enjoying this anymore.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Because what do they have? They have a
[34:24] taste for the bad stuff.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; That which is harmful and that which
[34:30] gives satisfaction are one and the same.
[34:32] Only in the wake of this realization did
[34:34] the agenda of cigarette designers appear
[34:36] to transition away from mitigating the
[34:39] health hazards of smoking and towards
[34:41] the perpetuation of the notion that
[34:43] cigarette filters are effective in
[34:44] reducing these hazards.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Filters became a marketing tool designed
[34:49] to keep and recruit smokers as consumers
[34:52] of these hazardous products.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; What do they want you to do? Keep you
[34:57] just use a filter. It'll take out all
[34:59] the bad
[35:01] &gt;&gt; and it'll just give you what you want,
[35:03] that taste. But what was it actually
[35:05] doing in order to satisfy the taste? It
[35:08] was the appearance of taking out the
[35:10] bed.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Because the taste is what was so
[35:14] important.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; And I and I want to use as brother
[35:18] Brandham did in the thinking men's
[35:19] filter, how that the filter that is used
[35:24] is related to your taste or your desire.
[35:27] The filters that you have as far as your
[35:30] eye and your mind and your spirit will
[35:32] either allow the world through or it'll
[35:34] allow the word through.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; And what we allow through or keep out
[35:38] will either strengthen us or weaken us.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; If we have a filter that lets the bad
[35:43] stuff in, no matter how much we tell
[35:44] ourselves it's working, if it's not the
[35:46] right kind of filter, it weakens you.
[35:48] And this is how you can self-regulate.
[35:50] And you can look at yourself and say,
[35:51] "Am I getting stronger?" If you're not
[35:53] getting stronger, what kind of filter
[35:54] have you been using? Wow.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Filtering even becomes a means of
[35:58] twisting what we see, reshaping the
[36:01] image that we look at. We can have a
[36:03] kind of filter and we always put that
[36:05] filter on when we go to the word of God,
[36:06] when we read the Bible, when we listen
[36:08] to the word of God. The kind of filter
[36:09] we have is going to determine what gets
[36:11] through. And if you have a filter that's
[36:13] looking for particular taste, you may
[36:15] still be getting harmful things.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Because the wrong filters will keep the
[36:21] word from having preeminence. Amen.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; The filter changes the image before it
[36:26] strikes the sensor.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; So if you have the wrong kind of filter
[36:29] up, the word's not having the impact it
[36:31] ought to because you're THE YOU'RE
[36:33] WARPING THE LIGHT.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; Says the wrong kind of filters keeps
[36:40] Jesus out of our homes,
[36:42] &gt;&gt; out of our hearts.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; And these filters are what influence our
[36:47] tastes.
[36:49] It's what causes us to be loyal,
[36:52] causes this dependency
[36:55] where, you know, there's uh there's
[36:58] sometimes where, and I'm not making
[37:00] light of it at all, but sometimes people
[37:01] say, "No, I I only drink this water
[37:08] in that is it the shape?" And they'll
[37:10] be, "Yeah, it's that shape or whatever.
[37:12] It's it's this water." Like I remember
[37:14] when Fiji Water said their water was
[37:16] better than Cleveland's water and it
[37:18] turned into a lawsuit and Cleveland
[37:20] proved that they had better water than
[37:21] Fiji water. It's all just being pumped
[37:23] out of the back lot of a Walmart
[37:25] somewhere anyways, right? But we've
[37:27] convinced ourselves this is better,
[37:30] right? Filtered water is better.
[37:35] So there's a certain taste that we begin
[37:36] to develop, a certain dependency.
[37:40] And as we have this taste, it influences
[37:42] our desires and our pursuits. And it's
[37:44] what leads to what? Addictions.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Smoking is not an innocent recreation.
[37:50] These things I'm reading and these
[37:52] exhaustive studies that have been done
[37:53] have proven that the dishonesty of the
[37:55] tobacco industry has resulted in
[37:58] immeasurable deaths in cancer because
[38:00] they hid the truth that there was it was
[38:03] damaging, it was addicting, and it was
[38:06] cancer-causing.
[38:08] But just this inference of a filter was
[38:11] somehow going to solve all the problems
[38:13] when in reality they realized that they
[38:15] were allowing people to be lulled into
[38:17] an addiction by telling themselves they
[38:19] were filtering out the bad. They had the
[38:21] wrong filter. What they needed was a
[38:23] filter that says don't even smoke.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; What they needed was a filter that told
[38:28] them that this kind of stuff perpetuates
[38:30] the wrong kind of dependencies, the
[38:32] wrong kind of loyalties and the wrong
[38:33] kind of tastes. Amen.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; 2 Timothy 4:3 says, "For the time will
[38:38] come when they will not endure sound
[38:40] doctrine."
[38:42] &gt;&gt; That light shining makes THEM UH GET
[38:44] UNCOMFORTABLE.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; But after their own lust shall they heap
[38:47] to themselves filters,
[38:49] &gt;&gt; says teachers here, but they become a
[38:51] filter for the word of God. Having
[38:52] itching ears,
[38:54] &gt;&gt; what is that? They want to hear,
[38:56] "Scratch my itch, brother.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; I want to hear it a certain way.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; I I want to hear you put the spin on it.
[39:02] I want to hear you put a particular
[39:04] emphasis on it. Satisfy my bent. I I
[39:08] believe the message is THIS WAY. SO, I
[39:10] WANT YOU TO FILTER IT THROUGH THAT
[39:11] THEOLOGY. I WANT YOU TO FILTER IT
[39:13] THROUGH THAT INTERPRETATION. I WANT YOU
[39:15] TO GIVE ME THE TASTE. AND THERE'S SIMPLY
[39:16] JUST SOME PEOPLE THAT MERELY HAVE THE
[39:19] TASTE FOR PERSONALITY OR POLITICS AND
[39:21] NOT THE PURE word of God. And once YOU
[39:23] STRIP THE POLITICS OUT OF LIKE don't
[39:26] like it.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; ONCE YOU STRIP THE PRETENSE AND THE
[39:28] PERSONALITY OUT OF IT, they don't like
[39:30] it.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they have itching ears,
[39:33] [snorts]
[39:35] &gt;&gt; it becomes a filter.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 6 19 to 24,
[39:49] I kind of toyed with the idea of cutting
[39:50] my sermon short tonight because then if
[39:53] I did that and then I joined it with
[39:54] what I didn't get last Sunday, maybe I'd
[39:56] have a few days off, you know, next
[39:58] Sunday for next Sunday. But um
[40:03] I so it's I guess it's just up to you.
[40:05] It just help me help me finish in the
[40:06] right spot. Matthew chapter 6 19 to 24.
[40:09] This is companion to what we read in
[40:11] Luke. Remember Jesus already in chapter
[40:13] 5 says ye are the light of the world.
[40:15] Candle's put on a candlestick that it
[40:16] might give light to those that are in
[40:18] the house. So let your light so shine.
[40:20] Notice the context of this. Lay not up
[40:23] for yourselves treasures upon earth
[40:25] where moth and rust doth corrupt and
[40:27] where thieves break through and steal.
[40:30] Where are these spiritual investments?
[40:33] How are we making these as believers?
[40:36] &gt;&gt; A brother was sharing with me a
[40:37] tremendous testimony today. A and you
[40:40] see the hand of God and and the the the
[40:42] measurable things it can bring
[40:43] naturally. But there's this other side
[40:45] that's a spiritual investment that you
[40:48] begin to calculate. What are these
[40:50] spiritual intangibles? How is my
[40:52] spiritual balance sheet in my marriage,
[40:53] in my relationship with my children, AT
[40:55] HOME? HOW IS THAT BOTTOM LINE BEING
[40:57] increased spiritually? BECAUSE WE GOT TO
[40:59] LAY up eternal spiritual treasures. So
[41:01] he says, "But lay up for yourselves
[41:02] treasures in heaven, where neither moth
[41:04] nor rust doth corrupt, where thieves do
[41:06] not break through nor steal. For where
[41:08] your treasure is, there your heart will
[41:10] be also."
[41:12] Think of this in terms of your
[41:13] alignment, your eye, your vision, what
[41:16] your aim is. Because he says, "The light
[41:17] of the body is the eye." Notice how
[41:19] quickly he comes to this. The heart, the
[41:21] light of the body is the eye. If
[41:22] therefore thine eye be single, the whole
[41:24] body shall be full of light.
[41:27] just it it's it's not something else
[41:29] placed upon the lens. There's not some
[41:32] other filter being put in there.
[41:34] One of the things that really inspired
[41:36] me to do this is I was fellowship with
[41:37] brother Frankie on Saturday and he was
[41:40] talking about uh the the the process of
[41:42] a filter and the sermon thinking man's
[41:44] filter and he actually had AI create
[41:46] another advertisement called a thinking
[41:48] man's filter. Uh and it kind of took
[41:50] from that visceroy thing showing that
[41:52] this is the kind of filter we ought to
[41:53] have the word of God.
[41:56] And it says that if thine eye be single,
[41:58] unmixed, pure, this singular vision of
[42:02] eternal treasures, thy whole body shall
[42:03] be full of light. But if thine eye be
[42:04] evil, the wrong kind of filter, the
[42:07] wrong kind of adding to or taken away,
[42:09] thy whole body shall be full of
[42:10] darkness. If therefore the light that is
[42:12] in thee be darkness, how great is that
[42:14] darkness?
[42:16] And then notice what he says in verse
[42:17] 24. We're talking about laying up
[42:20] treasures and having singleness of
[42:22] vision or eye and how the eye acts as a
[42:24] filter for light and that a single eye
[42:27] will allow the light of God's word to
[42:28] come in and wash and filter. And I know
[42:30] I'm adding these other things into these
[42:32] other principles into this. And as he
[42:34] says, but if your eye be mixed or evil,
[42:37] then it causes darkness. And he says, no
[42:40] man can serve two masters.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; He comes right to it. It's the
[42:44] double-mindedness.
[42:47] the the double tongedness
[42:52] and you cannot serve two masters for
[42:54] either you will hate the one and love
[42:55] the other or else he will hold to the
[42:58] one and despise the other and this is
[43:00] just a natural uh uh rule it's saying
[43:03] you cannot have literally two masters
[43:07] &gt;&gt; in natural but he says to this you
[43:09] cannot serve God and mammon
[43:11] &gt;&gt; so if what you are filtering for is is
[43:13] mammon and what you want is mammon and
[43:15] things out of the world he says CAN'T
[43:17] YOU CAN'T USE THAT KIND OF GOAL, THAT
[43:19] KIND OF AMBITION, THAT KIND OF FILTER
[43:21] AND PLEASE THE LORD.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; There has to BE THIS SINGULAR OBJECTIVE
[43:25] OF pleasing God. I want to I want to be
[43:27] a light. I want to be a Christian. I
[43:28] want to do THESE THINGS CORRECTLY. YOU
[43:30] CANNOT SERVE GOD AND MAMMON. There can't
[43:32] be THIS DUPLICITY OF MOTIVE and
[43:33] objective.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; There can't be this double-mindedness
[43:40] in the sermon of thinking men's filter
[43:42] says blindly to see. How blind can we
[43:44] get? Blind lay to see of the blind
[43:47] leading the blind of this age under
[43:48] false pretense under false creeds under
[43:51] dogmas that's false under denominations
[43:53] that's false under creeds books that's
[43:55] false oh blind le to see leading the
[43:58] blind you're all headed for the ditch he
[44:00] says change your filter tonight preacher
[44:05] &gt;&gt; all you preachers
[44:08] &gt;&gt; change your filter I kept saying that so
[44:10] much to myself the last week or so that
[44:12] I in my mind I kept thinking my title
[44:14] was change your filter and could have
[44:16] well been. We could go and post and
[44:18] filter out the original title, but a
[44:20] filter change is what I'm presenting
[44:22] tonight.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; And he says, change your filter.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Don't draw that denominational nicotine
[44:28] into your system of dogmas and creeds.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Which Jesus said, whosoever shall add
[44:32] one word to it or take one word from it.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; I I want to take the God the word of God
[44:37] in its purity.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; I don't want anything mixed in it or
[44:41] laced in it. I don't want anything added
[44:43] to it. The word of God, the stimulation
[44:45] of revelation does something. It
[44:47] intoxicates the believer. It gives you
[44:49] strength. The word OF GOD IS A LIGHT. IT
[44:51] HAS POWER AND IT HAS PURPOSE. YOU FILTER
[44:53] IT, IT LOSES ITS POWER. The word OF GOD
[44:54] IS THESE WATERS OF UH UH of washing and
[44:57] waters OF SEPARATION. YOU FILTER IT, it
[44:59] loses its power.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; And he make he has this prayer at the
[45:06] close of the sermon. He says, "Let me
[45:08] plant the word of God in my heart and
[45:11] purpose that I'll not turn to the right
[45:13] hand nor to the left away from it, but
[45:16] I'll live true to it all the days of my
[45:17] life.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Plant the word of God in my heart." Been
[45:21] exploring a lot of these principles of
[45:23] the seed and the growing and the
[45:24] gardening. Plant the word in my heart
[45:26] and in purpose to not vary that it might
[45:29] I might live true. Oh father, think of
[45:31] this. He says, "Oh Father God, then send
[45:32] down upon me the Holy Spirit of life to
[45:35] quicken those words to me that I might
[45:37] manifest Jesus Christ before those who
[45:40] are before me."
[45:43] &gt;&gt; You said, "That's my prayer.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, plant the word of God on my heart
[45:47] and quicken it by the Holy Spirit that I
[45:49] might manifest Jesus Christ to those who
[45:51] are before me." Amen.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; If that's going to have happen, then the
[45:54] word has to find good ground.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; And the and the light of God's word and
[45:59] the waters of God's word has to reach
[46:01] that seed unfiltered.
[46:04] And anything else mixed in could
[46:06] contaminate it, impede its growth, harm
[46:08] its growth. So you need a word filter.
[46:11] So Sunday we talk about word upon word,
[46:13] the right kind of support. If you're
[46:15] going to paint a picture, you want to
[46:17] have a word support to paint your word
[46:19] picture.
[46:20] And you don't want to have word support
[46:22] and then paint your own human picture on
[46:24] top of it. It's got to be word upon word
[46:25] that I might manifest. How is it you're
[46:27] going to be light when the light that is
[46:29] in thee can shine forth?
[46:32] &gt;&gt; And how is the light in you going to get
[46:34] brighter and more intense as the word of
[46:36] God filters out all the darkness and all
[46:38] the impediments and all the things that
[46:39] get in the way and allows the word of
[46:41] God to almost lighten off that mirror.
[46:44] your life becomes a magnifying glass for
[46:46] that dynamic power of God's word to now
[46:48] it could express and manifest out.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and close with
[46:52] this. This is the part that I was going
[46:54] to maybe uh keep out, but it's from um a
[46:57] devotion that we use as a family and one
[46:59] that I came across one time and I find
[47:01] this writer George Mat just to be an
[47:05] incredibly gifted writer. Uh he suffered
[47:08] a lot in his life. U just an incredible
[47:12] testimony. He wrote he wrote a a book
[47:14] called rest by the river and it's
[47:16] published in 1906. I'm just going to
[47:18] read this chapter and he uses uh the
[47:22] scripture let your light so shine or uh
[47:24] the um if the darkness the light of the
[47:26] body is the eye if therefore thine eye
[47:27] be single thy whole body shall be full
[47:29] of light. He takes it from Matthew there
[47:32] 6:22
[47:34] and he says our lord says that when a
[47:37] man looks at the sunshine it is not only
[47:40] his eye that is affected. You just
[47:42] listen with me here. I don't know that
[47:43] you're able to read this. His whole body
[47:45] is influenced by the light. His pulse is
[47:48] quickened. Listen, science to tell you
[47:51] today that you're supposed to get so
[47:52] much sunlight, at least for your vitamin
[47:54] D, right? There the the not the vitamin
[47:59] depression, but vitamin D. Get out
[48:00] there. Get in the light. Right? Get out
[48:02] there. Feel it. It's going to do
[48:03] something for your body. His pulse is
[48:04] quickened. His blood is accelerated. His
[48:07] step is lightened. His arm is
[48:08] strengthened. His voice is vivified.
[48:11] Even so, Christ says that in the moral
[48:13] world, everything depends on what a man
[48:15] looks at.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; You listening?
[48:18] &gt;&gt; I I'll pick up on this on Sunday and
[48:21] then you all will already kind of be in
[48:22] the channel and the amens will be in
[48:23] sync. He says his ideal.
[48:27] I want to relate that kind of to the
[48:28] filter. What an eye be what you're
[48:30] beholding HIS IDEAL. HE SAYS THAT THE
[48:32] GREAT QUESTION IS WHAT IS THAT picture
[48:34] of heroism which you have set before
[48:36] your inward eye?
[48:38] What is it you admire? WHAT IS IT YOU
[48:40] SEE BEAUTY IN? What is it you like? He
[48:43] exclaims in effect, it is no use to lay
[48:46] down rules of morality.
[48:49] WHAT IS YOUR MODEL OF PERFECTION, YOUR
[48:53] IDEAL of beauty, your standard of
[48:55] excellence?
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Everything depends on that.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Talking about an acquired taste.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Something that you've you've learned to
[49:03] appreciate.
[49:05] I used to not like to drink at all, but
[49:07] you know, man, now I've kind of got this
[49:09] acquired taste for just really good
[49:12] tasting alcohol beer. And you're kind of
[49:14] like,
[49:16] I think the beer company's probably
[49:18] deceived you, too. I want to introduce
[49:19] you to tobacco company,
[49:21] &gt;&gt; right? [clears throat]
[49:22] He says everything depends on that. Not
[49:26] your laws of morality, not the
[49:27] restrictive access, but he says what's
[49:29] your model of perfection?
[49:31] What's your standard of excellence?
[49:33] What's your ideal? What's your model of
[49:35] beauty? Says if you admire that which is
[49:37] really noble, the picture before the eye
[49:40] will permeate the whole life.
[49:43] What you admire, what you look at, what
[49:45] you allow yourself to take in will
[49:47] permeate the whole life. If you admire
[49:48] that which is mean and debasing, the
[49:50] picture before the eye will corrupt the
[49:52] entire nature. Mean and debasing, we
[49:54] have just summarized the internet,
[49:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Two words, three. mean and debasing.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Social media,
[50:02] &gt;&gt; politics, that's what's before your eye.
[50:06] He says the picture before the eye will
[50:07] corrupt the entire nature. You want to
[50:09] know why our natures feel a little bit
[50:10] rough? Yes, it's social media. It's Tik
[50:12] Tok. It's news. It's politics.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Show me what a man is looking at and I
[50:17] will show you what his life will be.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Tell me his favorite author, his
[50:22] favorite artist, his favorite pleasure,
[50:23] and I'll tell you where his strength or
[50:25] weakness lies.
[50:27] I'M GOING TO BE PASSING OUT A
[50:28] QUESTIONNAIRE on Sunday. You guys got
[50:31] you guys to SEE IF YOU PASS THE TEST.
[50:35] Bring him into a room. I'll say this.
[50:37] Don't if you really like a Christian
[50:38] song, don't find out what that artist's
[50:40] favorite artist is because you'll be
[50:43] like, who's Beiance?
[50:47] And what is that anyways?
[50:51] Is this guy Taylor Swift a trucker? And
[50:54] you find out these people you really
[50:55] like to listen to their FAVORITE ARTIST
[50:58] AND WHAT'S WATERING THEIR SPIRITS.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; There's no lick of Christianity in it.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; I heard a song the other day and I was
[51:08] just struck by how beautiful it was, how
[51:11] the poetry, the message. I was stunned.
[51:16] It was Bob Dylan
[51:19] and it [laughter] was done by a
[51:20] Christian artist I like. And so I had to
[51:23] check if it was after Bob Dylan's
[51:24] conversion and he had become a born
[51:26] again Christian. So I was like, "All
[51:28] right, I can mainline this for a couple
[51:29] weeks." No, it just shows there's
[51:32] certain things that YOU DON'T REALIZE
[51:33] WHAT THE INFLUENCE IS.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; TELL ME HIS FAVORITE AUTHOR, HIS
[51:37] FAVORITE ARTIST, HIS FAVORITE PLEASURE.
[51:38] I'LL TELL YOU WHERE HIS STRENGTH or
[51:39] weakness lies.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Bring him into A ROOM CROWDED WITH
[51:42] PICTURES and watch where his eye first
[51:44] lights and longest lingers.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; There will his heart be also.
[51:50] It is in the direction of the eye that
[51:52] you must seek the aim of the life.
[51:57] So he says, "Beware ye mothers and
[51:58] teachers how you furnish the halls of
[52:00] fancy."
[52:01] &gt;&gt; This is where it gets real.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; That was all poetry. Now this is
[52:05] practical application. Beware how you
[52:08] furnish your halls of fancy. Beware what
[52:10] ideal you suggest to the admiration of
[52:12] the child.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; One of the words that's used in our
[52:15] household is what are we promoting? They
[52:17] say, "Well, we're not promoters, but
[52:18] what is it we have set before our
[52:20] children that they begin to admire?"
[52:24] &gt;&gt; DO NOT point to Cain and say, "I have
[52:25] gotten a man from the Lord." If to the
[52:28] young eye, you make Cain a hero, you
[52:30] will soon, to the young heart, make
[52:31] violence heroic.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; This has such deep application. I hope
[52:35] you're making your applications. I hope
[52:37] you're thinking about the ideals that
[52:38] you set before your children and what
[52:40] you're making heroic.
[52:42] what you're putting before them and even
[52:44] ourselves and allow us to see beauty in
[52:46] it and that's what we're beholding and
[52:47] that's WHAT PERMEATES LIFE. DO NOT POINT
[52:50] TO A PHYSICAL CONQUEROR AND SAY THAT IS
[52:52] THE MESSIAH.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; IF THE POWER THAT CRUSHES BECOMES
[52:55] BEAUTIFUL, it'll airong seem beautiful.
[52:58] IF THE POWER THAT CRUSHES BECOMES
[53:00] BEAUTIFUL, WE WILL FEEL IT IS OUR duty
[53:02] to crush. And is that not how the word
[53:05] has been misrepresented to some?
[53:06] Therefore, they feel it is their duty
[53:07] that they must crush. Come on.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; DO NOT POINT TO THE COVETOUS MAN AND
[53:12] SAY, "THERE GOES JUST LOT." If you make
[53:15] selfishness an ideal, it'll soon become
[53:17] a practice.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Point the child to the greatness of some
[53:21] things deemed foolish.
[53:24] Point him to the man of Calvary and say,
[53:28] "What a strength was there."
[53:30] &gt;&gt; This is what ought to be the filter in
[53:32] our lives. This is what should be the
[53:33] ideal. This is what we behold. This is
[53:35] what we promote IN OUR HOMES. SHOW HIM
[53:37] THE SACREDNESS OF SACRIFICE, THE POWER
[53:39] OF PITY, THE kingliness of being kind.
[53:42] Tell him that there may be an inf
[53:44] infancy over w which the angels sing.
[53:47] Hours of childhood which are about the
[53:49] father's business. Days of tender youth
[53:51] in which the very heavens are opened.
[53:53] Seasons of wilderness want which are
[53:55] themselves the ministration of God.
[53:57] Moments of death in which a soul has
[53:59] saved the world.
[54:01] That's beautiful.
[54:03] Tell him there's an infancy over which
[54:05] the angels sing.
[54:08] A childhood which is tender and about
[54:09] the father's business. Days of youth in
[54:12] which the very heavens are opened.
[54:14] Seasons of the wilderness want the
[54:16] desires in the wilderness which are
[54:17] themselves God ministering in moments of
[54:20] death in which a soul has saved the
[54:21] world. Where do we learn all that?
[54:23] Christ
[54:25] &gt;&gt; revealed to him the majesty of the
[54:27] manger and the coronation of the cross.
[54:30] My Christ must be crowned heir. I can
[54:33] serve him. Crowned beforehand, crowned
[54:36] to the eye. In vain you will point to
[54:39] Calvary. If you teach me first, that
[54:41] self-surrender is a shameful thing. In
[54:44] vain YOU WILL CRY, "FOLLOW JESUS." IF
[54:46] YOU'VE IMPRESSED me with the notion that
[54:48] meekness is cowardness, that mercy is
[54:50] weakness, that purity is effeminate,
[54:52] that grief is unmanly, that peacemaking
[54:54] is unheroic.
[54:56] You must guide the eye air. YOU GUIDE
[54:58] THE STEPS BEFORE YOU PREACH CHRIST.
[55:01] CROWN HIM LORD OF ALL. WREATH CALVARY
[55:04] WITH FLOWERS. FILL GETHSEMANE WITH
[55:06] MUSIC. STRE THE DOLORES WAY WITH PALM
[55:08] LEAVES. WRITE IN GOLDEN LETTERS THE OLD
[55:10] OLD STORY. LET IT APPEAL FIRST TO THE
[55:12] EYE TO THE ADMIRATION. ENCIRCLE ITS
[55:14] CLOUDS WITH THE RAINBOW. Let its tears
[55:16] even while they fall glitter in the sun.
[55:20] Let the star of Bethlehem lead me up the
[55:22] heights of Golgtha.
[55:25] You will imprint Christ upon my life
[55:28] when you have made him beautiful to my
[55:30] eye.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; There's my calling.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; There's my prayer. Christ will be
[55:37] imprinted even on my children's life
[55:40] when I make him beautiful to their eye.
[55:44] Christ will be imprinted upon someone's
[55:47] life when he has been made beautiful to
[55:49] your eye. And he says, "Crown him
[55:51] first." To me, it speaks to that filter
[55:54] before it strikes the sensor, before it
[55:56] strikes the film. I want him for what he
[56:00] is, his glory and his majesty. I want it
[56:02] to reflect. I want the beauty of that to
[56:04] be imprinted upon me.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; I hope we could take these things to
[56:08] heart
[56:10] and maybe we could just take a little
[56:12] look at what kind of filters we've been
[56:14] using.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; And it could just be as simple tonight
[56:17] as a filter change.
[56:20] Because the word of God is still
[56:21] powerful.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Experience is still in your heart, but
[56:24] just a a filter, the wrong kind of
[56:26] filter changes what you see and what you
[56:28] express. If we could stand tonight,
[56:30] musicians, as you come, thank you for
[56:32] your attention.
[56:34] Beautiful spirit that you all created.
[56:39] You will imprint Christ upon my life
[56:41] when you have made him beautiful
[56:44] to my eye.
[56:46] Lord, help us. My prayer then is is
[56:49] Lord, plant the word of God in my heart.
[56:53] Water it with your spirit
[56:55] that I could live true to it every day
[56:57] of my life and manifest Christ to those
[57:00] who are before me. If you need prayer
[57:02] tonight, just pray to him. Lift your
[57:05] hands. If you need special prayer, with
[57:07] our heads bowed, our gracious heavenly
[57:09] father,
[57:12] Lord, there's an inexhaustible fountain
[57:14] that we could come to [music] tonight
[57:17] and we can ask for living water
[57:21] and you'll give us that water of life
[57:23] freely.
[57:25] You said that we could come and ask for
[57:26] wisdom and you give it liberally, Lord,
[57:29] that you will not uprade us for asking.
[57:34] And Lord, we realize that when it's
[57:37] preached, it seems kind we're just so
[57:40] clear and these bright lines of filter,
[57:42] no filter, or the word of God is a
[57:44] filter and the wrong kind of filter. But
[57:46] I realize, Lord, that in application, it
[57:49] can get muddy.
[57:52] But Lord, we can pray tonight
[57:55] that Lord, I want your glory to be seen
[57:59] on me.
[58:02] And Lord, in order for you to be seen on
[58:04] me, then I must see you.
[58:08] And whatever's gotten in the way, Lord,
[58:10] remove it. Whatever's getting in the
[58:13] way, Lord, remove it. Whatever door in
[58:15] my heart is closed, Lord, open it,
[58:18] Lord. Serve that search warrant. Kick
[58:20] down the doors, Lord. Just go through my
[58:22] heart.
[58:24] Explore, Lord. Let the light just go
[58:26] through and reprove and manifest.
[58:28] Father, if there's a wall that I've
[58:29] built in my heart that's not
[58:31] loadbearing, that's only keeping you
[58:32] out, just take it out, Lord.
[58:35] And Lord, may all these worldly filters
[58:37] and all these bushels and all these
[58:39] complexes and fears that I've just used
[58:41] to gum up the light that should be
[58:43] shining into my soul, but oh Lord, even
[58:45] worse, the light that's in there not
[58:47] getting out. Lord, remove it.
[58:51] For you cannot be seen through me until
[58:55] you see through me.
[58:59] And Lord, come [music] just as you are
[59:03] in your glory and in your word and in
[59:05] your power. Heal us of anything that's
[59:07] scarred up, anything that's in the way,
[59:08] any channel that's clogged so the light
[59:11] can shine in.
[59:13] And Lord, may we then reflect back your
[59:15] life, your light, [music] your attitude.
[59:17] May we take these words to heart. Commit
[59:20] the people to you. Every hand that was
[59:21] raised, all the desires that are in
[59:23] these people's hearts, may you lead them
[59:25] and guide them. We love you. We ask this
[59:27] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.
[59:29] [music]
[59:29] Amen.
