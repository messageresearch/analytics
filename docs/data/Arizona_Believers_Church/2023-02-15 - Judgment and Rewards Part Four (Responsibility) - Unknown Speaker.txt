TRANSCRIPT
========================================
or continue on the subject of judgment and rewards this is part four my title tonight is responsibility and I know this is maybe not a catchy catchy title or something with a little Sizzle to it but we want to address this subject of responsibility under that this title and this subject of responsibility under um this overall theme of judgment and rewards now as just a quick review a few things I want to remind us of that we've already looked at already we begin with the next step and that kind of tied us into what we were talking about through the year in preview and these six things that we should be doing faithfully and I hope these things are being rehearsed in your hearts over and over again of things that you can do to be faithful but the last two Services were on the gift and condemnation and I believe it was a necessary Foundation to properly motivate the believer's efforts to please God bam talks about how that we ought to God rewards all of our efforts to please him and so we can't have the order wrong to where I'm trying to please him so he'll save me but rather having been saved I want to please them all that I can and God is so gracious that even though we labor to please him because of the grace that we received he still wants to give us more when we've labored for him that's what we've been looking at is the difference between a reward for laboring for him and the gift which is eternal life the Holy Ghost the new birth all those things being the same and a reward is something given in payment for labor or worthy Behavior this reward that is given for worthy Behavior or for labor is God's incentive that he holds out to the believer that's what brother bam talks about in the church age book but a gift on the other hand is something that is voluntarily given without payment expected in return a gift is not purchased it's not earned that's the free gift of Salvation it's the free gift of faith it's the free gift of grace these are things that we receive by God's gift and so there is that's where there's a difference of the Eternal rewards available to the believer and the gift of God's salvation Nation so when we talk about rewards judgment and rewards and the Judgment for a reward we don't want to confuse that at all with the gift that God gives us and even with the blessings that God gives us and things that God blesses and induce people with certain gifts and God pours out his spirit in meetings and Gifts can manifest themselves and those blessings are one thing but these rewards are something different and because it's such a maybe not a familiar subject to us I feel that just having that necessary foundation and maybe always going back and pointing to it say don't confuse it don't confuse it it'll be good to have that we use the scripture Romans chapter 8 verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit so there is now no condemnation that is no separation there's no Eternal separation from God there's no Specter of judgment the white Throne is completely erased from your future there is not going to be any future Judgment of the Bride that can result in punishment it says there's thou now no condemnation when you've passed from death into life and there is no condemnation that means you do not have to fear standing in the place where a possible outcome is eternal separation from God because you already have eternal life you can't be separated from them you can't be lost and so if there's any future judgment it is not to determine punishment and it cannot result in separation from God and it says now there's now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus by one Spirit we're baptized into that body it's through that new birth that we're in Christ and the next statement who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit it's not a qualifier it's just telling you what it means to be in Christ you now have now have available to you the power of God to walk after and you do not have to walk after the Flesh and this law of sin and death has been vanquished to the cross and by you receiving eternal life and so we can say through the gift there is now no condemnation now if you'll take your Bibles and turn to Second Corinthians chapter five verses 9 and 10 I want to look now specifically at rewards and I'm not going to go there's not going to be very deep today not going to go very far on this subject I feel um just really relaxed on this subject I feel real pressed to get to anything in particular just as the Lord inspires even as you ask questions and share your heart and you kind of communicate back to me I feel the Lord kind of leading me in ways that can encourage you but in second Corinthians chapter 5 verses 9 and 10 this is companion to Romans 14 but we'll come back to it wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him and so when he says wherefore we labor that word labor there it means make this your ambition this is our ambition this is what we're striving for that whether president or absent we may be accepted of him so he's saying our ambition ought to be to please him because to be accepted to him means to be pleasing to him and we ought to Aspire to please him and our ambition should be to be accepted by him because verse 10 and so it's important to I don't want to just jump into verse 10. he's saying labor work and he says whether you're present when at the translation or whether you were absent it doesn't matter just labor that you may be accepted and pleased pleasing to him and this is why verse 10 for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he had done whether it be good or bad so if I could say this though our Salvation is not dependent upon our works our future rewards depend upon them saying that we ought to labor to be accepted by him because we're going to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ he says to receive the things and so that's an important phrase and and I don't think it's uh maybe it's a little bit cumbersome a little bit bulky to receive the things done in his body he's basically saying that there's a grant of reward that's proportional I think I'm making it more clumsy a grant of a reward that's proportional to the things done the very things you do in your flesh and in your body your work your labor your effort your service all these things that you do there's going to be a reward that matches what you've done in your body and he says whether good or bad so Paul is saying that the believer and I think this is just the very clear it's not necessarily kind of a hidden reference here but the believer may have a greater reward according to how he labors for Christ he's writing to the believer he's not scattering this out to the unbeliever say Hey you know if you just if you get on his good side then he might kind of throw you a bone he's saying no to the believer to the elect labor for him because you're still going to stand before the bhima the Judgment seat of Christ that you might receive be rewarded for the things done the things you've done while in the flesh and since there's going to be a judgment and a proportional reward to the things that we've done in the flesh Paul is saying this is why he's encouraging us to have a higher ambition than just saying well thank God I'm saved and I know I've got the Holy Ghost and maybe being too church-centric because I I think it's really unfortunate and we begin to think about the third poll we think about the the open of the word we think about the restoration of the Bride tree we think about a lot of things whether we say Apostolic or Pentecostal it's unfortunate that our minds never leave the four walls of the church right a lot of what we think about in that context is what would take place in a church service and that's just a real teeny teeny teeny part of it because it's the life you live when you leave here uh if anything I'd say the Pentecostal blessing and the worship and the praise and the gifts that can manifest amith in these four walls is just should be a faithful blessing and encouragement for all the laboring we're doing outside of these four walls so let's not just narrow it down to what we do on a Wednesday night for a couple hours of what we do for a few hours on a Sunday morning there's so much to that labor and Paul is encouraging us to have a higher ambition in light of the fact that I know it might seem to be kind of like this we're all going to have to stand before the Judgment seat and it might seem to be a little a little bit of a fearful thing and I think we ought to have that respect for it but there's no chance that you can be separated from God at this point and I and I and I think that what I'm wanting us to do tonight is begin to think very deeply about this subject so that we can give more weight to the Eternal rewards that are available to us as Paul says in First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 8 if you're writing these down you could even go back and begin to read around these especially in this part we'll be looking at this in First Corinthians chapter three and the verses before and after in much greater detail it says now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor if you're thinking why didn't you just read that in part one and we could have just moved on to another series well it's pretty plain isn't it it seems to be very plain that one planet and the water they're part of this one one labor and one work but he says every man shall receive his own Ward according to his own labor so every man is going to answer for how he labors he's going to receive his own reward according to how he works so the believer all of us already securing Christ already sealed into the body we still have to answer for the works that we do in our flesh Paul says in Corinthians whether it be good or bad and I find myself having to constantly remind you not that there should be any fear of punishment but your works are going to be examined and so if if I could say this way to recognize this portion in God's word put so many other things into perspective there's a lot of things that we say well if I'm saved and I've got the Holy Ghost then what is what does all this matter and you say well maybe it doesn't matter in terms of this the seal but it matters in terms of future position and reward it'll matter in terms of how well you're blessed in this life and it matters in terms of what available opportunities God will give you to use the gifts that are in your life and this is one thing that puts into perspective all the many other things that God is trying to do in terms of perfecting our character in placing us positioning not just as sons that have been born but placed positionally in the body of Christ where we have a greater understanding and a greater uh a greater working out and manifestation of the holy spirit in our lives and so I think I believe it'll put a lot into perspective for us and and if that seems to be uh maybe a little presumptuous or talking too big about the subject I apologize but I do think it puts a lot in perspective in Romans chapter 14 if you could turn there I'm going to go ahead and read all of these verses together again verses 8 to 12. and because I just think it's important to kind of follow it this flow and then I'm just really going to be focusing on how Paul positions verse 10 and verse 12 together he says for whether we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lords for to this end Christ both died and Rose and revived that he might be Lord both of the dead and living and this is uh this is where if you just focus very intently now but why Dost thou judge thy brother or why do thou said it not thy brother why don't we judge and condemn one another why is it that you're putting a stumbling block in front of one's way or you're you're arguing about this meat and you know despising this one because of this and condemning and judging because of that he said why does thou judge thy brother or why Dost thou said it not thy brother and this is his immediate statement to strike the one that's despising strike the one that's condemning the one that's judging to get them to kind of shake themselves and say don't you realize that we for we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ now he's not writing to those who are not the Lords he's not writing to those who can find themselves at White Throne judgment and say depart from me I never knew you he is not writing to the unsaved he's writing to the believer to the elect for we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ for it is written as I live saith the Lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God I was absolutely you could bring everybody into that because every man is going to answer books are going to be open and every man is going to have to answer for his works and so there is there is a time and I think maybe I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit here but there will be a time then then even those who are sealed and who's those whose names can ever be removed from the Lamb's Book of Life they still will stand before the Judgment seat of Christ is what Paul is plainly saying so he's saying why do you judge and condemn one another when we will have to be judged by him like forget don't forget now you may be the bride you may be elect and you may have eternal life but don't think that you can get away with whatever you say and whatever you do and there not be some Judgment of a man's works it says so everyone verse 12 so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God to give account of himself I believe the word that is used there is logos and in the context of judgment it simply means to answer or to give explanation for yourself that we are going to have to everyone will have to give an account give an explanation or answer for their character answer for their conduct they're going to have to answer for the words that they say and the actions and the Deeds that they did There's going to have to be some explanation given and so this is where the subject of responsibility I think just is coming right into view and I want to now just look at this very particularly all Christians are accountable to God according to their responsibility these are very simple words and I might and I'm using I want to use a diff a different word in relationship to it so let's consider these two related Concepts responsibility is our is our title tonight the subject we're looking at tonight but then also accountability and so these are two related Concepts responsibility is a fact or condition of being responsible it's a condition of being accountable or answerable so if you're responsible you are there's accountability if you're responsible you have to answer it so it's the condition of being responsible and this responsibility now it's not just accountability for accountability's sake and it's not just having to answer because someone asked you a question but it arises from some trust that's been put into you or put given to you I'm trusting you and since I've trusted you here please keep my keep my Blackberry phone safe and don't let anyone borrow it because I don't want someone to break it and so I'm trusting you with this then you would be responsible for the Blackberry and and therefore since it's been trusted to you that would be your responsibility and maybe our children could explain this better because when when we ask whether or not something's been done they can very easily articulate that it wasn't their responsibility and so they understand it on some level and so in this uh it arises from a duty that you have or or some trust and and I I I I can't I don't want to spend too much time on this subject I think maybe in the future if the Lord would anoint it there's a lot to be explored here but relationships create responsibilities and so it's by virtue of some relationship that's been formed a contractual relationship or parent to child or husband to wife or there's some there's some relationship to one another and therefore it it becomes a legal burden or a an obligation that you have because of the relationship and and parents have a duty uh to look after their children and even in the law parents can answer for the conduct of their children even though they didn't do it themselves they have a responsibility for their children and so there's a lot that can be used in terms of responsibility some fiduciary duty by virtue of relationship or contract one scripture I'd like to use just to make the point First Timothy 5 8 but if any provide not for his own especially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel because of this relationship this man has specifically to his own house and the responsibility that he has for his own and for his own house if he does not provide then there's consequence so relationship establishes responsibility failure to fulfill the responsibility results in consequence this is uh kind of just real simple thought when we begin to think about how that we will all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ because every one of us will have to give an account so we're looking at responsibility first on this brother Brown says in a man running from the presence of the Lord we got so many things we have to do so much responsibility that we have to face everyone has got to face a certain responsibility I would encourage you if you have time to maybe go read the sermon or listen to it but the man talks a lot about responsibility in this a lot of good things to pull out about how a man has a responsibility and how certain relationships uh impose Upon Us obligations and responsibilities and I had been was just thinking about how we could phrase so many of the things that God asked us to do or expect of us as Christians to be responsibilities even in the things that are that we went through the six things that the year in preview for us and those things that we should be doing as Christians and as Believers these aren't responsibilities they arise because of our relationship to Christ and being Sons and Daughters of Christ or being the bride of Christ being his bride comes with a responsibility because of that position there comes with responsibility brother bam says this later in the same sermon Christianity is an everyday rugged life living for God in this present world it's a constant burning of the fire and love of God in the heart that sets you on fire and puts you out yonder with the people and making converts to Christ responsibilities these are all responsibilities these are all things that if you say if you don't feel like you have it let me just remind you it's there right if you don't feel like you have it there's a constant burning of the fire of the love of God down in your soul and it it can set us on fire put us out yonder amongst the people declaring Christ that's living for God in the present world he says responsibilities in the sermon the token he says we are responsible to him not to a church write it down right bold it underline it if you're typing it put it in all caps remember you are responsible to God not to a church there may be some responsibilities you have to a church by virtue of relationship you have to a church but you're not answering to the church for your rewards you're not answering to the church ultimately what they say he's saying you answer to his word and if it's not according to the word you owe no answer right so much that can be put in this he says but we are responsible to him not to a church we are responsible to God into his word and God is the word the Bible said he was we're responsible to that says in many different places that he will judge the World by Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is the word that is the standard that is what we measure ourselves by and we are responsible to Christ we are responsible to the word and so without so that's that's uh responsibility now this other concept that we just want to quickly touch on without accountability responsibility is meaningless so if you are responsible for something and I say here you know watch out for this Blackberry that no one steals it or destroys it and and you knew that I wouldn't do anything or wouldn't matter or I would ever notice I'm never going to come back and ask it's like I mean I got a drawer full of blackberries he never comes back and asks there's no there's no consequence if something happens to his BlackBerry then there's really no responsibility if there's really no trust and there's no uh if there's no accountability rather then responsibility is meaningless do you understand what I'm saying in this if I gave if not me but if someone gave you a task and maybe this is a good way for parents to think about it and children think about it if you're given a responsibility and there's not going to be any subsequent accountability for what you've been asked to do then the duty there's no sense of Duty you don't feel that you have to complete it you don't feel that you have to do it because there's no real Duty that's being imposed upon you in no sense of obligation because nothing's ever going to be checked come on homeschoolers say Amen and so accountability is being answerable I I know you might say well if you're being really petting you say brother and those words sound really really you know close alike I get that but there's a little bit of a difference in that accountability is being answerable and again I'll say this is a very vast subject and I'm just wanting to touch on it in the sense of there's accountability as being answerable literally liable to be called to account and this is what Paul is saying that we all shall give an account of ourselves to God so we are liable we are going to be called to explain called to justify called to give a reason for what we did how we lived and how we handled this word that we've been given and so because accountability is the actual being held to account for what you're responsible for accountability encourages responsibility because it inspires us to the the full obligation of our duty that knowing that that I'm I'm going to be checked later my work is going to be checked and I'm going to be asked whether or not I did it and I'm going to be looked at they're going to be looking at me whether or not I performed my duty and there's going to be some examination of my work product and my teacher is going to look at whether or not I did the work or I'm gonna have to be tested on this however you would need to look at it to understand the idea that when you know that you're going to be examined or have to give a reason then it gives you this sense of I want to do it right I want to do perform my full obligation because I'm gonna have to answer for what I did so it encourages responsibility it kind of inspires us to do it well and do it right so accountability then as taking these two related Concepts accountability means being held responsible for our conduct as it relates to our duty so that we have a responsibility so it's our conduct it relates to our duty our position our relationship accountability is answering being held responsible for that conduct and so if we have a responsibility accountability is answering for whether and how we perform it I hope that that's principles are just put in there these are terms that we can use to help describe what we're looking at so we've looked at Second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 10 for we shall all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that we may receive the things done in this body whether it be good or bad and that we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ so that every one of us will give an account of ourselves to God now you recognizing these these two concepts the Judgment seat of Christ has if I could even put it this way kind of soft language it has something to do with even the believer being examined or given an account of his works the way the Paul is saying it we'll have to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ and and receive that that's where we get the reward from we're going to receive in proportion to the our labor that we did we thought with what we were given the gift that we were given if I could put it that way and he says so we all will all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ to give an account of what we did with the gift now I find no better way to really amplify this to you than to bring it through the message of the hour because this concept would not be inspired to me nor would it be clear to me except through the message that we've received and in the sermon go wake Jesus he says just a little while and you'll find and I use this front part so you can see that brother Branham is relating this to the sealed so just a little while and you'll find Everything Has Changed and you're a new creature the new life comes in and you live from there on and I'll meet you again at the Judgment seat of Christ each one of you the new creatures I'll meet you there and I'll have to be responsible for what I I know it's a fragment he says God Will Make Me responsible so this is Brother Brown I'm expressing this to these new creatures and there's going to be a time that these converts that he was leading to Christ that there'll be a time will be gathered together again as new creatures in Christ Jesus assembled together again at the Judgment seat of Christ and he says I'll be responsible God Will Make Me responsible so this future judgment seat again and I think I'll get to the point where you'll finish the phrase for me it is not to determine salvation it is not to determine guilt or innocence it is not going to determine punishment or Mercy brother bam says we'll all stand will be at the Judgment seat of Christ where he will be responsible so we're going to be judged according to our responsibility whether or not we Faithfully just discharged our duty in First Corinthians chapter 4 verse 2 it says moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful now maybe I'm going uh too fast tonight and I'm letting the clock push me a little bit notice how Brad Brown says we'll stand before the judge and see the Christ and he says in that time God Will Make Me responsible so he's identifying even himself being responsible this is why we are using the phrase responsibility so it says moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful a steward is one who is appointed to Governor have oversight over something in another stead so as I'm using this Blackberry example I don't know where that came from uh maybe just a shout out to brother Tim Dodd but with this uh idea that maybe someone gives you something we are stewards of the message of the hour you're stewards of the gift God gives you a gift you're a steward over something that comes with it we're appointed and have over sight in someone's dead think about all the wonderful things that brother Brahm says about the bride she is his body and his voice she's going to finish the work that he did not do he's entrusted us with certain things brother random preaches that the bride and if the woman has been entrusted with sacred virtues and so there is a stewardship that we have things that God has entrusted us with and as stewards therefore there is responsibility and accountability you find this in The Parables that Jesus uses you'll find a number of other places in the scripture that we are stewards and being stewards we must be found faithful because a steward will be judged according to his faithfulness did you discharge your duty that which was committed to you did you keep that which I committed to you did you look out after it did you do what you could have done with it did you get a hundred fold out of what I gave you so brother Branham in the church age book chapter five says yes I can see that God is going to give play Closer pay close attention to this God is going to give a special reward to his Messengers who have Faithfully discharged the responsibility he has placed upon them if they have received the revelation of the word of God for that age and Faithfully preached in their day and lived what they preached They will receive a great reward notice how brother Branham is placing this that there is a special reward to The Messengers who Faithfully discharge the responsibility he placed on them and there is a responsibility placed upon them having received the revelation of the word for that age therefore they Faithfully preach it and I love and they lived what they preached I I'm I'm holding back a little bit maybe Sunday mornings when we'll touch on it there is then this inference that one could receive the Revelation for their day Faithfully preach it but not live what they preach and lose something right there's some loss that can be had there I'll give you the key you can go look it up a Castaway he says they will receive a great reward those who have Faithfully discharged the responsibility placed on They will receive a great reward he calls it a special reward a special reward a great reward now again he's not saying that he'll save him right I should be getting louder a man's at this point when I make the distinction between salvation and these rewards he's not saying I'll save you and I'll give you the Holy Ghost he's saying I've got something special for those who have Faithfully discharged their responsibility and so this judgment seat of Christ is being held accountable it's where we're going to be held accountable or it refers to the the Act and the fact of being held accountable for our responsibility and the outcome of that is a reward or a special reward or great rewards and we are you on the same page with me I got you can just give me nods or you can give me that you can you can give me the the Indian yes right yes brother Aaron absolutely and so we're all on the same page good I like that so he says now brother I'm going to read just several quotes here and I just feel so comfortable to do this and if you could I know I know it's Wednesday night a little bit weary there's a lot of things going on uh that kind of dominated our attention we've survived all the crowds being here over this past week or so maybe you're at hole 16 of the Waste Management Open or whatever it's called but let's shake ourselves it's eight o'clock let's focus intently on these statements because there's brother Brown is pointing at something right pointing at something we want to get it he says in the sermon the patriarch brother sister this is my soul I've got to meet God I'm responsible for what I say to you God will hold me responsible for it the Judgment seat of Christ is being held accountable for your responsibility if God has endured a messenger with a revelation and he Faithfully preaches it and Faithfully lives that God will give him a great reward or a special reward so there's some moment at the judge's seat of Christ where we answer for what he has given us and what we've done with the gifts or talents uh however you well however you want to describe it there's this point in time where there's judgment for a reward I've got to meet God he says God will hold me responsible for it in the sermon The God Who is rich in Mercy every move we make and every sound it's playing a record that will meet us at the judgment every move move we make has got to meet us there and that's what brother bam says remember let's say member of the Bride sealed into the body of Christ I've got to answer for the words that I say to you as a minister I've got to do that because God will hold me responsible to it could we what's the word I want to use here Ponder the implications a little bit could we do that and really let us uh at two ways one by pondering the implications be struck with the reality that though a sealed Son of God you'll still have to answer to your heavenly father and wouldn't that be just a tremendous moderator for a lot of people who just like to do this sometimes right wouldn't that be a tremendous moderator for people who just want to do this a lot of times to realize yeah you may be secure as a Son of God but you'll answer for everything you say about somebody you'll answer for the way you treat people you'll answer for the things you say and do even as a child of God because he says I will answer for the words I say to as a minister I've got to do it because God will hold me responsible so let's personally think about the implications that we'll still answer for our conduct but then also think about well then where can we place this judgment if the bride is going to be at White Throne judgment judging then when is she going to answer to God and be responsible or where if we just want to say well brother Aaron it's just brother Branham saying it when is he going to be responsible when is Paul going to be responsible because he's saying that he is in the sermon Faith the brother says someday I'm going to have to answer for what I've done here on Earth and I'm going to have to answer for my stewardship this is what we call plain English this is good enough for government work this this is we're going to have to answer for my stewardship I'm going to have to have to answer for what I've done here on Earth and I'm going to have to answer for my stewardship not to determine whether or not he is saved or receives eternal life but it's just the truth it's just reality in God's word he's going to examine our works will they remain in that time of judgment will will there be anything that survives why because only one life so soon this one will pass and only What's Done For Christ will last you'll have to answer for your stewardship and the sermon the seed is not air with the shock and if you think I had to go pecking around to find these you all you have to do is just simple word searches and you can print out reams of paper on this subject oh God I would pray for help knowing the responsibility of what it means and what I must answer at the day of judgment for all that I say here and elsewhere help me to be deadly sincerely Lord with all that I do or say in thy word that it might bring forth fruit there's somebody who gets it that he still he he knows he's a prophet he's preaching this not in the 53 but he's preaching this in 65 and there's this all that he has for the responsibility and he says I'm going to have to give resp to answer at the day of judgment for what I say what I say elsewhere and I'll be responsible knowing the responsibility that I have he says Let Me Be deeply sincere and all that I do or say in thy word that it might bring forth fruit not only that it would be fruitful here but Lord I know I'm going to have to answer and I want my Works to remain in that day I have to answer he says in different places different ways but he says this very specifically I don't have the slide for it it's just a short phrase I know that I'll have to answer at the day of judgment for what money the people give to me and I do not believe even the the harshest skeptic and critic of this message could try to twist that to say that brother Branham was confessing that he would stand before Christ at the white Throne judgment to determine whether or not he would enter in but that is not what he's saying he said I will have to answer the div judgment for what money the people give to me there's a there's an account there's accountability because of the responsibilities and maybe that Comforts a lot of you who give offerings and tithes knowing that whoever receives it is going to have to answer on the day of judgment for how they use it well you didn't have to laugh that heartily if I was a visiting Minister laugh all you want you remember in brother Brandon when he tells his life story in a number of different places and I know I'm refreshing this to people who know it very very well and I've really been encouraged through the Supernatural series that brother-owned organists and wrote uh because it just it's rehearsed it a lot in our family and our children are very familiar with it I recommend those to be read as part of your devotions or just personal reading and and so whether it's been through that medium or listening to brother random tell his life story we've heard of how that God was calling him to go to the Pentecostals and he was calling him in his minister to go out and preach and he didn't do it because of his mother-in-law and when he refused he suffered he paid a great price in this earth right lost his wife lost his his daughter and paid the price for not going out so you understand the background but notice this statement he makes uh in regards to him not going when God answered him to go in the in the sermon life story in 1951 he says always mind God this is fresh after he's told this story of losing his wife and his daughter because he disobeyed God and didn't go to the Pentecostals because that's what God wanted to do he says no matter what it is God says for you to do he's saying mind God no matter what it is he says and I tell you today that God in heaven who looks down upon me standing in this platform will forgive me don't read ahead focus on that I know I'm standing here in this platform he's just told the story of his Disobedience he told the story how he obeyed a mother-in-law instead of God and he says I know God will forgive me I know that many thousands of souls that I'll have to answer for it that day for listening to someone else instead of God that's true That's Heavy this is the honesty of brother Branham to not say oh wow and think about maybe if it's been our attitudes then this is this should be a rebuke to us like wow you know predestination and God let it happen because it wouldn't let it happen if it wasn't predestinated if I'm going to be there I'll be there in this kind of this laissez-faire attitude whatever will be will be and it's kind of just as if God's ordaining all the Affairs of man and he's in control and we almost take on the attitude of of the clay saying well how could you judge me when you made me this way and here's the humility of brother Branham to say I know I was wrong to not go and I know that he forgives me or will forgive me so he's in that forgiveness there's no punishment but he says I'll still answer for all the souls that I was supposed to minister to because I listened to somebody else and said of God he says that's true I know that many thousands of souls I'll have to answer for at that day that's tremendous again we're wanting to recognize his owning the responsibility and subsequently I'm wanting us to place ourselves in that pattern of being responsible and the when he went beyond the curtain of time brother man talks about being on the curtain of time and I'm sure that you're familiar with this when he enters in beyond the curtain of time and he's looking back and he sees himself laying in bed with his arms behind his head or his hands behind his head and he begins to experience that realm beyond the curtain of time there in eternity and and there's different conversations he has and when he tells the story in a couple places and then he recounts it in the church age book there's this man that has come up to him and these one lady hugs him and he's like she said oh when I was saved she was 80 years old when he got saved but she's a young lady now and so brother Brandon was like are these all branhams and uh who are they they're saying these are your converts and so then he's having this conversation and brother Brown's like oh where's the Lord and we'll pick it up here the man said we're resting here while waiting for the coming of the Lord I replied I want to see him he said you can't see him just yet but he is coming soon and recognize this and when he does he'll come to you first because this is these are converts of brother branham's and and these are his people coming are these Browns all these are converts These Are the souls that were won through your ministry he'll come to you first and you will be judged according to the gospel you have preached again as we are pondering this very deeply recognize the context in which this judgment is brought up is not souls in prison their souls in hell are those that are unredeemed in this state of loss in this eternal fall wondering when is this all going to end well one day we're all going to be judged she said no these Believers eternally secure in Christ who are there beyond the curtain of time are aware and conscious that there's going to be a time when cry will be gathered together to Christ and be judged and he says you will be judged according to the gospel you've preached and we will be your subjects I said do you mean I'm responsible for all these he said every one you everyone you were born a leader I asked will everyone be responsible what about Saint Paul he answered me he will be responsible for his day can you recognize this special time that brother Branham is pointing to as a Son of God as a prophet as a minister as one who handles the word of God and recognizes these scriptures he's pointing to a special time when his own labor and his own responsibility is going to be examined and he will be accountable to what he was responsible for he's pointing out this special time where even our labor as the bride will be judged for to determine a reward is it not can you not see that can you see that rather how I want to ask it can you see brother randomly and you say we might have a lot of questions well just when exactly is it going to be and what is it going to look like and what kind of rewards are we going to get that we might have a lot of questions that lean in those ways but I think it's more important first to establish in our hearts that it's a truth in God's scripture according to the message of the hour in the scripture that judgment seat of Christ is a time when the believer who is sure of his salvation relationship with God is given an opportunity to present his Works to God and say this is what I've done for your kingdom and they're tried and they're examined and there's a reward that's given to those Works which remain so I I close with this this thought and just just a few moments here I don't want you to also start a timer on that if there's anyone keeping the the data points maybe be good to do the analytics on it at some point but in First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 58 therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord and if I could say without even considering the blessings he'll give you in this life without even considering I know there's been some questions about what in the world does kids eat free mean keep thinking about it because if you ever if you pick up on the con what I mean by that then there's a lot of sacrifices and a lot of efforts we'll make as parents knowing that our kids are getting the benefit from it and he's saying be steadfast unmovable always abound in the work of the Lord and this is without even without even giving it and I want to put it this way without even giving any consideration to reaping the what you sowed that's good in this life he says for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord right could I encourage you to do something tonight invert always invert we use the subject of judgment we use the term responsibility we use the term accountability and rarely are these things ever used in the context of an awards banquet or receiving something fun or getting that thing that we always wanted it usually is carried with it like a sentence or a punishment or or being grounded or having something taken away from us and I think that you ought to invert always invert that if there's going to be a judgment there's going to be an opportunity for us to to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ the point has nothing to do with losing and everything to do with gaining that that what we gather from this oh I'm going to be judging my works and be judged and said be like oh no what am I going to lose and what is going to happen just think about all the rewards that God has made available to his Saints and all the incentives that he holds out to the believer encouraging them to labor on his behalf because God is Not will not forget your labor of love he'll always reward a believer's efforts to please him and Paul is saying be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord let's not encumber our minds with the sense of what we have to lose at a judgment seat of Christ but rather let's think about what we stand to gain at the Judgment seat of Christ there's no threat of punishment for bad behavior only the reward of the promise of a reward for good works and Paul is encouraging faithful labor because God will reward it in other words let's give more weight to his Rewards we've read in a number of places where brother Branham is identifying himself as being responsible and himself having to answer and in him being accountable him I'll have to be responsible God Will Make Me responsible that God will give a special reward and those who have Faithfully discharged their responsibility will receive a great reward I've got to meet God he hold me responsible we'll he'll hold me I got an answer for the works that I do I got to answer for what I've done I have to answer for my stewardship uh what a responsibility because I'm gonna have to answer the day of judgment I'm gonna have to answer for the money that I use always mind God because I know he'll forgive me but I'll still answer for thousands of Souls he was told you'll be judged according to the gospel You Preach am I going to be responsible yeah he says we're everyone will be responsible and so brother Madam has clearly identified in his own Ministry from the beginning of the end that there's this understanding this idea that one day his resp he's going to be judged and he's going to be held responsible for what he preached he's held responsible for the way he did and how he used things and so another very familiar and I I was so I just like the way the Lord brings us out because if you think well brother Aaron just you know sits at home and just tries to think of a creative way to craft a sermon now these things are just inspired by God and what was remarkable to me is how God takes these significant instances in brother Brown's Ministry and he starts pulling them together and you see that in the in the uh going beyond the curtain of time or in the uh in this this momentous decision or this decision he ought to have made to go to the Pentecostals see these these significant events there are these little Clues as to what the implications are later on in in eternity and so brother Branham and I wish I would have brought more of the quote here I I just I just take a segment out I don't even have the slide for you but you're familiar when brother Branham there's a prophecy he'd been given in French and and it was spoken out and given in French and then it was immediately translated and this is this is what the prophecy said because thou Hast chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou Hast walked of your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way we're having to try to wrestle with this we're we're looking at this and we're we're instead of just being very uh shallow with it I'm wanting us to think deeply and and think about different the different layers that are to this and my it what is he actually saying here did Brother Benham make choose the narrow path to be a Christian he'd choose the harder way uh to be saved but it's it's talking about this momentous decision because I was chosen the Narrow Path the harder way now let me say this with I believe the anointing of God here for you there's there's those who need this and you've been sincere in your prayers about this very thing now you place yourself in the same place in the same place as the Son of God you may not be a prophet but you have your reward you you may not be a PR a minister but you have your responsibility and if God will Faithfully reward with the special reward and a great reward uh the man of God who discharges his duty then God has a special reward for any of his children that Faithfully discharge their Duty God has not created a special class of people but we are join heirs with Christ and there are rewards that are available to the faithful Saints so I pray that this and just reciting this prophecy this interpreted prophecy into French that was in French to you that you can let this just strike your hearts to give you some Liberty because thou have chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou Hast walked of your own choosing thou Hast picked the correct and price precise decision and it is my way and I I say this being overwhelmed with inspiration you some of you sit here tonight have chosen the harder way and made choices that have so you've suffered as a result of it but it has been his way those picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awakes thee do you recognize what God is trying to tell this Prophet who is aware here we are towards the end of his ministry he's fully aware he's going to have to answer he knows he's gonna have to answer for souls he knows he's got the answer for being disobedient to that to that call he has he feels the weight of it so God tells them don't you worry you've made the tough decision you've made the difficult decision and because you have a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee oh Hallelujah what is that huge portion of Heaven it's a reward and it continues what a glorious decision thou has made this in itself is that which will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in love divine I hope that you can make this personal that there is when we choose the narrow path we choose the harder way we've walked of our of our own choosing and again let me just hearken back you're not a Christian by your desire you're a Christian by God's desire but now as a Christian you make you make choices and you make decisions and you choose certain ways and we pick when we pick the correct and precise one because we choose the harder way and we suffer loss he says there is a portion if I could say a portion of Heaven that awaits us and with all that the Believers in you individuals your families and individuals here and I'm mindful of the different ones that we could identify with all that you've lost all that you've suffered in this life all that you've left behind to follow Christ all that you've abandoned to be in his perfect will all the the whatever it might be that you've suffered to do what you knew is the right thing if you think about all that it might seem in some ways that it's all been in vain but this is what Paul is saying your labor is not in vain God is keeping record he keeps record of all your hard decisions all your sacrifices all that you've lost and all that you're suffering and through it all your earning Rewards and it's not in vain because he will repay it and I and I say this as a just a means of encouragement tonight I I wish that the the fellowship Paul was full I wish there was standing room only tonight so that everyone I say this especially to those who are part of this church that they could all hear this you may not you may not seem to be seeing the fruits of it now and there may not be a lot of things at your fingertips to say oh my I'm really getting a return on this but you'll get a return on it that there will be a payoff there's not one thing you've done for him not one choice you've made not one hard decision there's not one friend You've Lost In following Christ there's not one relationship that's been broken because you chose to do the right thing there's nothing you've lost here that you haven't already gained there you may not see the fruit of it now but it's coming and I think very particularly those who labor for the kingdom of God specifically for the the house of the Lord and the different things that are done behind the scenes the the sisters and the families here that come on regular intervals and you and this may seem very patent to some of you I don't know or you may not even realize that this place doesn't get supernaturally cleaned but those that come on regular intervals and they sacrifice without pay and they come when no one else is watching and they and they clean and if you heard the horror stories that take place in the bathrooms you'd have a much greater respect and admiration uh for those that come and and clean and they do it without any Fanfare without any reenumeration without any and it's a sacrifice and it may seem very trivial even in your minds as I say it right now but God is keeping record of every single effort everything we do to please him everything we do in our heart is unto the Lord in knowing from whom our reward comes I'm not doing it for a paycheck I'm not doing it for a raise I'm not doing it for status I am working from whom I know that my reward comes from you may not feel the blessing of it now you may not get all the attention and recognition now but there will be a payoff I think the ones that I think of most immediately when it comes to this are the mothers that are raising young children and they and they have them in secession they have child number one within the next few years number two with the next few years number three and then maybe there's a four and a five and they and for like a dozen years of their life they're changing diapers they're running out to do this they're changing clothes they're having to do it and the church services they know what they're going to do they're going to come to church and take their children out and sometimes they ask themselves and maybe the devil puts the thought in their mind why why even go well I'm trying to put it into perspective that it may not seem well I'm not getting anything out of the service and if you miss a part of brother Aaron's sermon the whole thing just follows it falls apart and I gotta run out and do this and I gotta run out and do that don't forget that it's not the reward of understanding what I say but it's the reward of being at your post to duty it's the reward of knowing that this is where God wants me to be that even if I don't recognize there's a blessing in it one day God will reward me for it and there's a reward that we cannot even quantify or measure for when we have been faithful to what he expects us to do in the sermon the world has fallen apart could we could we focus now this is my last statement I think this will just be a wonderful end to this this subject tonight and now we're happy to know that there's come in a time when the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ that we shall Rule and Reign on the earth with him a thousand years now he says we're looking forward to that time so what time is he referring to the millennial reign when all the kingdoms become king his kingdoms I hear the men speak of their Temptations and how that Satan took our Lord up to the top of the mountain in a moment of time showed him all the governments and kingdoms of the world and offered them to him but he flatly refused them because he knew that someday he's falling heir to them I said we're looking forward to this time when all the kingdoms of the world become the kingdoms of Our Lord and we shall Rule and reign with him on the earth Millennial Reign and now he brings it back to a time where the devil offered it to him without sacrifice right offered it to him as a gift perhaps it was gonna give it to him without the sacrifice but Jesus knew one day he would get it if he Faithfully discharged his duty and programs using this using this language here I think it's very very key because it helps place the timing of the Judgment seat of Christ he says because he knew that someday he'd fall heir to them he says and we don't look at the things that go on so much temporarily now but we look to the end of the road where the rewards are given we are happy to know that there's come in a Time when all the kingdoms of this world are going to be given to Jesus Christ and we will rule and reign with him a thousand years on the earth and he's saying you know what let's not just look so much to what we lose here and what goes on here he says but look out to the end of the road when the rewards are given that's that time in that moment when you receive the reward for all that you've labored for you I think that responsibility is a good thing because it means there's rewards that are available could we stand together tonight
