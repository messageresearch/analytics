[0:00] Hebrews chapter 4, start with verse 11,
[0:03] read to verse 16, and it reads, "Let us
[0:06] labor therefore to enter into that rest,
[0:08] lest any man fall after the same example
[0:10] of unbelief. For the word of God is
[0:13] quick and powerful, and sharper than any
[0:15] two-edged sword, piercing even to the
[0:17] dividing of sunder of soul and spirit,
[0:19] and of the joints and marrow, and is a
[0:21] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[0:23] the heart.
[0:24] Neither is there any creature that is
[0:26] not manifest in his sight, but all
[0:28] things are naked and opened unto the
[0:30] eyes of him with whom we have to do.
[0:33] Seeing then that we have a high priest
[0:34] that is passed into the heavens, Jesus
[0:37] the son of God, let us hold fast our
[0:39] profession. If we have not a high priest
[0:41] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[0:43] of our infirmities, but was in all
[0:45] points tempted like as we are, yet
[0:47] without sin, let us therefore come
[0:49] boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
[0:52] may obtain mercy and find grace to help
[0:56] in time of need.
[0:58] &gt;&gt; I think there's just such a tremendous
[1:00] overlap with the grace over shame and a
[1:02] lot of the things we've been ministering
[1:04] on, even on the nakedness aspect and
[1:06] good and evil. If we could just pray
[1:08] together this evening. Gracious heavenly
[1:10] father, as we've read your word, we
[1:11] believe it to be eternal. This Bible is
[1:13] our absolute. Lord, we believe that it's
[1:15] inspired. And though it may not read
[1:18] like a history book or it could be read
[1:20] as a history book and though just
[1:22] reading it, it's uh black ink and white
[1:24] paper, it doesn't really impart anything
[1:27] supernatural. But yet by your spirit,
[1:29] you preserved it. You've watched out
[1:31] over it. You wrote it through the
[1:34] prophets and through the scribes. And
[1:36] now, Lord, you make it alive to us by
[1:38] your spirit. So, we pray tonight as
[1:39] we've read it that you'd quicken it to
[1:40] us. Be with the different needs that we
[1:42] have in our body. Lord, we rejoice that
[1:44] Sister Joyce when she gave those
[1:46] platelets of blood and they got those
[1:48] stem cells, Lord, they found enough and
[1:50] they have enough to work with. So, I
[1:52] pray that the the therapy go well and
[1:54] just move move along a little bit. Be
[1:56] with them and Pana family and all their
[1:57] needs. For those of us here tonight, we
[2:00] we're we're waiting. We're attentive.
[2:01] We're listening. And father, we are we
[2:04] are encouraged by your word, by your
[2:06] presence with us. And we know that
[2:07] you're doing very positive supernatural
[2:09] things. We do not want the devil to
[2:11] distract us. And Lord, we're believing
[2:13] for great miracles. We ask all this in
[2:16] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; You can be seated.
[2:21] Sunday morning we ministered on the
[2:22] subject of resonance and want to uh
[2:25] quickly recap what that subject was and
[2:27] just continue on the same subject but
[2:29] that's the efficient transfer and the
[2:32] amplifying of energy at particular
[2:34] frequencies and so you could call them
[2:36] vibrations uh you could refer to them in
[2:38] ways of sound waves and those things and
[2:41] uh and we looked at the idea of tuning
[2:43] and when you get in tune or those
[2:45] concepts of how God's word is sent and
[2:48] it vibrates at a certain frequency and
[2:49] if we're out of tune. We can't be
[2:51] receptive to it. Uh we talked about uh
[2:54] destructive interference and coherence
[2:56] and even positive uh constructive
[2:58] interference. A lot of different uh
[3:00] aspects of sound and music and the
[3:02] composition of things. And so there's a
[3:04] lot that we covered and there's a lot of
[3:06] different principles in the word of God
[3:07] about being a a receptor of sound
[3:10] signals or transferring certain unseen
[3:12] things into the visible realm. And so a
[3:15] lot of that fits in. And a lot of you
[3:16] were identifying it with me in
[3:18] fellowship and I enjoyed that. But one
[3:20] thing we touched on Sunday was that if
[3:22] an object vibrates at a particular uh
[3:26] frequency that an object with the same
[3:29] natural frequency resonates and responds
[3:32] in the same frequency and that is called
[3:35] and that's my title tonight is
[3:36] sympathetic resonance. sympathetic
[3:39] resonance where an undisturbed string or
[3:41] even the surface vibrates in response to
[3:44] vibrations from another at a related
[3:48] frequency. So whether it's sitting
[3:50] there, nothing's happening. Uh it's just
[3:52] resting on its own, but something is
[3:55] moved or struck or plays or begins to
[3:58] vibrate at a particular frequency. And
[4:00] then that dormant object responds to
[4:03] those waves, to those vibrations, and
[4:06] begins to vibrate not just being shaken,
[4:09] but it vibrates at the same frequency.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; And we mentioned it on
[4:15] uh we mentioned it on Sunday and it it
[4:17] would be easy to demonstrate and you
[4:18] could go home if you have guitars that
[4:20] are in tune or tuned to each other. You
[4:23] take a guitar string and you string a
[4:25] particular you pluck a certain string
[4:27] then other the strings tuned to that at
[4:30] that same frequency even on another
[4:32] guitar that's not being played you can
[4:33] witness it begins to vibrate and it's
[4:36] actually this concept of this
[4:37] sympathetic resonance uh this is just
[4:40] what I've learned I haven't actually
[4:42] experienced this but it's helped me
[4:43] understand better what's happening when
[4:45] Preston plays the piano 12 hours a day
[4:47] but when the you use the sustain pedal
[4:49] on the piano what's actually happening
[4:51] is the strings corresponding to the
[4:53] harmonics of that played note will
[4:55] vibrate. And what does it do? It makes a
[4:57] sound richer. It has there's a there's a
[5:00] sustain pedal. There's a dampening you
[5:01] can use. There's certain ways that
[5:02] you're using the resonance of that g of
[5:05] that instrument and the way that it's
[5:07] made in order to enrich the sound.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; And so there there's certain ways and
[5:11] styles of playing where you're using the
[5:13] harmonics on a guitar. you're you're
[5:15] using one string, but then it it sends
[5:17] those vibrations into these others that
[5:19] are tuned the same way, and it's called
[5:22] sympathetic resonance. In Hebrews 1:es 1
[5:26] and two, as we read in verse 11 of that
[5:29] same chapter, it said, "Lest any man
[5:30] fall after the same example of
[5:32] unbelief." The word of God is quick and
[5:35] powerful, sharper than any two-edged
[5:37] sword. It's a discerner. It divides a
[5:39] sunder. And so, the word of God is very,
[5:41] very powerful. Then how is it if the
[5:43] word of God is so powerful that one
[5:45] would fail to be impacted correctly by
[5:48] the word of God? So it says, "Let us not
[5:50] fall by the same example of unbelief."
[5:52] And it's mentioned here in verse one.
[5:54] Let us therefore fear, this is a
[5:56] reverence. This is a this is a a respect
[5:59] for God and his word. Not be real
[6:01] cavalier and dismissive, lest a promise
[6:04] being left us of entering into his rest,
[6:06] any of you should seem to come short of
[6:08] it. For unto us was the gospel preached
[6:11] as well as unto them. So there's your
[6:13] powerful word of God. The gospel which
[6:16] is power being preached, but the word
[6:18] preached did not profit them. Was not a
[6:21] gain to them. It was not beneficial. It
[6:23] was it should have it had a desired
[6:26] effect, but yet it didn't have the
[6:27] effect that it was intended to have in
[6:30] that the gospel is salvation. The gospel
[6:32] is the power of deliverance. Says not
[6:34] being mixed with faith in them that
[6:37] heard it. So they heard the word of God,
[6:40] but they didn't have ears to hear, to
[6:42] receive. Uh because there was no mixing.
[6:46] As the gospel was preached, it wasn't
[6:47] mixed with faith in them that heard it.
[6:50] They were tuned into reasoning, tuned
[6:53] into science. They were tuned into other
[6:55] things. So that when the word of God was
[6:57] preached and it began to vibrate when
[6:59] the vi those vibrations struck them,
[7:01] they didn't have the the faith to mix
[7:03] with that in order to respond in a way
[7:06] to where I can receive that and then
[7:08] they begin to resonate as well. They
[7:10] were not tuned to the promise. And then
[7:13] in Acts 13:48, there's so many different
[7:16] ways that we could use scriptures to
[7:18] make this point. Says, "And when the
[7:20] Gentiles heard this, we could say again,
[7:22] the gospel is being preached. The
[7:23] promise is now being shared as the
[7:25] gospel was preached unto them. Now the
[7:27] gospel is turning to the Gentiles when
[7:29] they hear it. It says they were glad and
[7:31] glorified the word of the Lord and as
[7:33] many as were ordained to eternal life
[7:35] believed. This is something they weren't
[7:38] even taught in.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; This is not even something they were
[7:41] expecting. But yet there's something in
[7:43] them. This ordination to life that when
[7:45] the word, the gospel was preached over
[7:47] them, this power of God shook them and
[7:50] they begin to vibrate. Some get shaken
[7:52] away.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; Right? That's I I promise you this. The
[7:57] word is either going to change you or
[7:58] chase you.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; It's thus sayith the Lord. If the word
[8:03] is not ch if the word is preached and
[8:05] it's not changing you, it's eventually
[8:07] going to chase you.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; And that may be for your own good
[8:10] &gt;&gt; because then you realize I'm not being
[8:11] changed. And so eventually it chases. So
[8:13] the word preached resonated with these
[8:16] Gentiles.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; And what what did they respond with?
[8:18] This faith to believe.
[8:21] And so we believe that God's word and
[8:23] power vibrate,
[8:25] but there's many that cannot, if maybe
[8:27] this is a poor term to use, but they
[8:29] cannot feel those vibrations. They do
[8:31] not have a sympathetic response.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; The word's preached and it just goes
[8:37] right over their head.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; The word is preached, they hear it, they
[8:41] internalize it, they think about it,
[8:42] maybe it bounces around, but then it
[8:44] just kind of gets dampened. It just gets
[8:46] absorbed. There's nothing in response.
[8:49] Now if we could look at verse 13 of our
[8:51] text in Hebrews chapter 4,
[8:54] we're we're cons the we're focusing very
[8:56] specifically and very narrowly on this
[9:00] concept in music and just life called a
[9:02] sympathetic response.
[9:05] And and we used it here in the sense of
[9:08] u in music in music composition and the
[9:11] way an instrument is structured that it
[9:13] uh something that is undisturbed and
[9:15] unused can response when an instrument
[9:18] of a similar use and utility or tuned
[9:20] the same way sounds and then this
[9:23] responds to it.
[9:25] In
[9:26] &gt;&gt; verse 13 it says neither is there any
[9:27] creature that is not manifest in his
[9:29] sight but all things are naked and open
[9:31] under the eyes of him with whom we have
[9:33] to do. There's that nakedness. This is
[9:35] that honesty that we ought to have when
[9:37] the word Bible says the word of God is
[9:39] quick and powerful, sharper than any
[9:41] two-edged sword. What we ought to
[9:42] realize is our hearts are not hid from
[9:44] him.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; Even when you may not know and you may
[9:47] not see it, there's a lot of things that
[9:48] aren't happening. There's one who does
[9:50] know. And so therefore, we ought to have
[9:52] this fear to recognize that we are naked
[9:56] before him. And then instead of it kind
[9:59] of just leaving us naked, he says,
[10:01] "Seeing that we have a great high
[10:03] priest." Okay, I want you to catch this
[10:05] this beautiful principle that has passed
[10:07] into the heavens, Jesus the son of God,
[10:10] let us hold fast our profession. Now,
[10:12] what beautiful imagery is the high
[10:14] priest once a year would enter in behind
[10:16] that veil into the most holy place or
[10:18] the holy of holies to present uh the
[10:20] atonement and that blood that was shed
[10:22] on the day of atonement to stand there
[10:24] as a propitiation for the sins of
[10:26] Israel. Now in in fulfillment of all
[10:28] those shadows and types, Christ has
[10:30] entered into heaven, entered into heaven
[10:32] once with that blood present to atone
[10:35] for our sins. He says, "So we have a
[10:37] high priest that has entered there to
[10:39] atone for our nakedness,
[10:41] &gt;&gt; our blindness, our confusion."
[10:43] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "For we have not a
[10:45] high priest which cannot be touched with
[10:47] the feeling of our infirmities."
[10:50] I know you realize these scriptures, but
[10:52] we can always say, "Lord, I want to know
[10:54] that better. Yeah,
[10:55] &gt;&gt; I want to understand that better.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; I I really want to feel the weight of
[10:59] that in my life. Get touched with the
[11:01] feeling of our infirmities, but was in
[11:03] all points tempted like as we are yet
[11:05] without sin.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Let us therefore come boldly. This is
[11:10] honestly. Boldly doesn't mean
[11:12] presumptuously. We kick the door down.
[11:14] Jesus, son of God, give me what I need.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Show me this. If you don't show it to
[11:19] me, then I know this is wrong. If you
[11:20] don't show this to me, then I don't know
[11:22] what to do. There's there's no
[11:23] arrogance. It's that humility, that
[11:24] nakedness. There's a reason why I
[11:26] believe the Lord has arranged this in
[11:27] this order that it's through this
[11:29] humility of saying, "I'm broken. I've
[11:30] got nothing. I I I can only present
[11:32] myself in everything that I'm
[11:34] experiencing and going through." And so,
[11:35] you come honestly, the word there boldly
[11:37] is frankly honestly about the fact that
[11:39] you are naked and open before him.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; It's to the throne of grace that we may
[11:45] obtain mercy and find grace to help in
[11:48] time of need.
[11:50] It may not seem like it, but this is an
[11:52] appeal to God's sympathy
[11:54] &gt;&gt; because it says, "We have not a high
[11:56] priest which cannot be touched with the
[11:57] feeling of our infirmities." In other
[11:59] words, it could be said this way. We
[12:01] have a high priest, Jesus Christ, that
[12:04] can be touched.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; In other words, he can sympathize with
[12:07] our weaknesses.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; That's what the word touched means. He
[12:12] can be sympathetic to what you're going
[12:14] through. And when it says infirmities,
[12:17] it's not just headaches and sicknesses
[12:18] and weaknesses, but it says, "But was in
[12:20] all points tempted like as we are." So
[12:22] he can sympathize with our physical
[12:25] weaknesses, our emotional weaknesses,
[12:27] even our moral struggles.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Yet without sin." He
[12:32] did not sin, but he understands our
[12:35] vulnerability to its attacks.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; He understands how Satan works. He knows
[12:40] how clever he can be with, well, what
[12:42] God has said and this and all those
[12:44] different things that we go through. And
[12:46] so, he was truly tempted as a man. And
[12:50] having been tempted as a man, he knows
[12:52] the tactics. He knows what it feels
[12:54] like. And having been truly tempted as a
[12:56] man, he says he can sympathize with us
[12:59] in our temptations and our weaknesses.
[13:01] Therefore, he can adapt himself to you
[13:06] &gt;&gt; and not just to humans in general, not
[13:09] just to men ages 30 to 33.
[13:12] Uh, but he can adapt himself to your
[13:15] peculiar nature.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; Wherever you sit tonight, whatever it is
[13:20] you're going through and say, "Well, I'm
[13:21] 24 years old and I do this for a living
[13:23] and this is my history and my background
[13:25] and this is what I'm facing." You have a
[13:27] high priest who can sympathize with what
[13:30] you're going through.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; In Philippians chapter 2, 7 and 8, it
[13:34] says, "But made himself of no reputation
[13:37] and took upon him the form of a servant
[13:39] and was made in the likeness of men, and
[13:42] being found in fashion as a man, he
[13:45] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[13:47] death, even the death of the cross."
[13:50] &gt;&gt; I think you'll notice there's a lot of
[13:51] uh overlap. Somebody may be able to,
[13:54] maybe AI could do this for us. Jim and I
[13:56] could do it. Those different ones out
[13:57] there and just create these vin diagrams
[13:59] of all these different sermons I preach.
[14:00] We say he used this scripture and this
[14:02] one and this one and this one and you
[14:04] see this beautifully colored vin diagram
[14:06] of how these things fit with so many
[14:08] things in scripture. This making himself
[14:11] of no represent uh reputation. It's in
[14:14] the form of a servant. Even if you
[14:17] looked at it backwards, it would uh
[14:19] being found in fashion as a man in the
[14:21] likeness of man. He was in the form of a
[14:24] servant without any reputation.
[14:27] He writes this is that's the
[14:28] condensation as you read no reputation
[14:31] servant men man that this fashion and
[14:34] likeness it almost raises from the
[14:35] ground up but Christ condescended down
[14:38] to a servant without reputation
[14:40] &gt;&gt; humbled himself
[14:42] &gt;&gt; became obedient to death not just death
[14:44] but the death of the cross and because
[14:46] of that he has sympathy for you
[14:52] &gt;&gt; sympathy even in our language is this an
[14:54] affinity between certain things It it it
[14:57] speaks of even the word is a community
[14:58] of feeling
[15:00] and and to be affected by like feelings.
[15:04] When we have sympathy, it's a feeling
[15:06] that's identical with or resembling what
[15:08] someone else is feeling. When someone
[15:11] says, "Uh, it was hot in church
[15:13] tonight." You can say you we could be
[15:15] sympathetic
[15:17] &gt;&gt; or wasn't it a little bit muggy
[15:18] yesterday? I'm like, "I sympathize. I
[15:20] felt it too." And there's a way where
[15:22] you can it resonates with you when
[15:24] someone says something where there's
[15:26] this affinity there's this community or
[15:27] common feeling to be affected by like
[15:30] feelings
[15:32] in Hebrews chap 2:es 9 to18 but we see
[15:36] Jesus who was made a little lower than
[15:38] the angels for the suffering of death.
[15:41] Now that's uh it now re it returns to
[15:44] glory crowned with glory and honor that
[15:46] he by the grace of God should taste
[15:48] death for every man. For it became him
[15:51] for whom are all things and by whom are
[15:52] all things and bringing many sons into
[15:54] glory to make the captain of their
[15:56] salvation perfect through sufferings.
[15:59] That's part of a another vin diagram.
[16:01] For both he that sanctifith and they who
[16:03] are sanctified are all one. Now remember
[16:05] this. He that sanctifies and the
[16:08] sanctified are one.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; He have perfected forever them that are
[16:12] sanctified. Right? There's this there's
[16:14] this sanctification, this glorification
[16:16] for the perfected and there's this
[16:18] justification of the perfected that is
[16:20] for the elect, those that are ordained
[16:22] to life.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; For which cause he is not ashamed to
[16:25] call them brethren, saying, I will
[16:27] declare thy name unto my brethren in the
[16:29] midst of the church will I sing praise
[16:31] unto thee. Again, we've used that
[16:32] scripture recently. And again, I will
[16:34] put my trust in him. And again, behold,
[16:36] I and the children which God hath given
[16:38] me. For as much then as the children are
[16:41] partakers of flesh and blood, he also
[16:43] himself likewise took part of the same.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; Right?
[16:46] &gt;&gt; So as we are children of God with some a
[16:50] supernatural origin in destiny and we
[16:52] know that we will return into a
[16:54] supernatural eternal state, we are now
[16:57] partakers of having bypassed our
[17:00] theophony, having bypassed a sinless uh
[17:02] bypassed a a sinless birth, coming by
[17:05] sinful birth. Here we are in the flesh,
[17:08] partakers of flesh and blood. And he
[17:10] says he's also a partaker of flesh and
[17:12] blood, that through death he might
[17:14] destroy him that had the power of death,
[17:16] that is the devil, and deliver them
[17:18] through who through fear of death were
[17:20] all their lifetime subject to bondage.
[17:23] For verily he took not on him the nature
[17:26] of angels, but he took on him the seed
[17:29] of Abraham.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Wherefore in all things it behooved him
[17:32] to be made like unto his brethren. I
[17:34] hope you're picking up what the
[17:35] scriptures are laying down about this
[17:38] affinity that Christ has with humanity
[17:40] &gt;&gt; that repeating. He's not an angel
[17:42] &gt;&gt; in the sense that he's just programmed a
[17:44] certain way. He's lived angelically and
[17:46] he can discern and he can know things.
[17:47] He can do supernatural things. But God
[17:49] put his son brought him forth with
[17:51] flesh, with feelings, with uh emotions,
[17:53] with a personality, with a will. Father,
[17:56] not my will, but thy will be done. Uh
[17:58] with weaknesses, with flaws, as we've
[18:00] already seen,
[18:02] &gt;&gt; not sin, but flaws.
[18:04] uh uh uh rumors and innuendos and all
[18:06] sorts of things about his life. But God
[18:08] put him in there so that he could be
[18:11] made like his brethren that he might be
[18:13] merciful and a merciful and faithful
[18:15] high priest in things pertaining to God.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; So God made him this way for your
[18:22] benefit and for your sake.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; He was made lower than the angels. He
[18:25] was made a sacrifice. He was made of no
[18:27] reputation in the form of a servant
[18:28] after being made in the likeness of a
[18:30] man and fashioned as a man's for your
[18:31] benefit that he could be a merciful and
[18:33] faithful high priest for you because it
[18:35] says to make reconciliation for the sins
[18:37] of the people.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; And then it says this this is this is
[18:41] the sympathy. This is God's sympathy
[18:43] here. For in that he himself hath
[18:46] suffered being tempted. He is able to
[18:48] secure them that are tempted.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; That means help them.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; You know this is why he can help you.
[18:56] I I know that if I begin to speak down
[18:58] this line, you could all start to really
[18:59] get into it and pull me into it and next
[19:01] thing you know, we're just kind of all
[19:02] riffing on life's experiences. But how
[19:04] many times has someone come to you with
[19:06] the problem? You're like, "Man, I can't
[19:07] help you. I have I have no idea what
[19:10] it's like to do that. I have no idea how
[19:13] you got yourself in that fix. I didn't
[19:14] even know those things existed. I didn't
[19:16] even know you could pile up that much
[19:18] debt or I didn't know you could do this
[19:19] or you could do that. I have no idea."
[19:22] And when that happens, there's like, "I
[19:24] can't help you." But Jesus is one who
[19:26] knows what you're going through.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; He has some way of not just saying,
[19:30] "Yeah, I know there's trouble. Uh, how
[19:32] can I help? I've been there before." But
[19:34] he is able, having been tempted like you
[19:36] are.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; He's able to help you that are tempted.
[19:42] Now, I know that if we were maybe
[19:45] aligned differently geographically, I
[19:46] might have to drag you all back to your
[19:48] seats and tell you to sit down because
[19:50] that's really exciting stuff.
[19:53] That is really, really exciting stuff to
[19:55] think that God is able to help me. Not
[19:58] when I prove to be above temptation. Not
[20:01] when I proved I have all the right
[20:02] answers. Not when I've proved to say the
[20:04] right things and do the right things and
[20:06] have a positive confession and keep my
[20:08] shoulders back and do everything right
[20:10] and do everything good. He's able to
[20:12] help me when I am tempted.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; He's able to help me when I am weak.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; He's a able to help me when I need him.
[20:23] This is God's sympathy.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; This is not petty human sympathy.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; There's this petty human sympathy where
[20:30] we sympathize and we pet and we pander
[20:33] and we mistake what godly sympathy or
[20:36] what I could say this way is godly
[20:38] compassion. What it looks like versus
[20:40] human compassion. There's a human
[20:42] compassion and a human sympathy. That is
[20:44] nothing more than a lack of love.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; That's all it is is a lack of love. a
[20:49] lack of love for the person, a lack of
[20:51] love for the truth.
[20:53] It's a sympathy that relates in the
[20:55] evil. It's a sympathy that relates in
[20:57] the relenting and giving into evil. And
[20:59] therefore, it's spineless.
[21:02] But he sympathizes with us. Therefore,
[21:05] he is indisputably able
[21:09] to preserve us in all of our
[21:10] temptations.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; He do you believe that?
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Now, we can all we'll make mistakes.
[21:17] we'll we'll be tempted. Uh we have
[21:20] moments of a great weakness and there's
[21:22] things that we could say and and a
[21:24] believer can be driven to do things that
[21:25] he doesn't want to do and there's a lot
[21:26] of difficult things that we can see in
[21:28] our lives. But we must believe that
[21:30] Christ sympathizes with us that he knows
[21:34] what it's like to be tempted and that
[21:35] there is he is able to help you and to
[21:38] preserve you.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Scripture says keep you blameless.
[21:45] I hope I'm approaching maybe I I hope
[21:47] I'm approaching this maybe from a
[21:48] standpoint you weren't necessarily
[21:49] expecting in this sympathetic response
[21:52] because now we're looking at God's
[21:53] sympathy and we're looking at the
[21:55] sympathy of Jesus Christ
[21:58] and how that he has a way that he can
[22:00] relate with you. Now if you could put
[22:02] yourself and now this is going to be
[22:04] easy. I just want you all to think of
[22:07] yourselves as human today,
[22:10] right? Just think of yourself as humans.
[22:13] Um, and maybe not just humans, and this
[22:15] can be hard. I know it's a difficult
[22:16] exercise, but ones with no reputation,
[22:18] maybe servants.
[22:20] I know this is hard for the elite
[22:22] Wednesday night crowd.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; But, uh, let's just It's a thought
[22:25] exercise, right? This is just a This is
[22:27] what we're doing. We're community
[22:28] building. We're we're we're finding all
[22:30] sorts of exercises as a dynamic group
[22:33] here uh to uh increase proficiency and
[22:37] create some synergy so that we can
[22:39] optimize frequency
[22:41] for the sake of the bottom line for all
[22:43] the stakeholders in God's word. Glory.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; But I want you to think about this.
[22:49] Jesus in Matthew chapters 26 when he
[22:51] goes to the garden of Gethsemane. Uh
[22:53] there I could read from other places
[22:55] where you find that Jesus the son of God
[22:58] goes to the garden and he asked his
[23:00] disciples will you pray with me?
[23:04] &gt;&gt; And he asked him will you watch with me?
[23:08] &gt;&gt; And here in verse 38 he says then he
[23:10] said unto them and this is not just the
[23:12] first time this is maybe I think the
[23:13] third time my soul is exceeding
[23:15] sorrowful even unto death. tear you here
[23:18] and watch with me.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; You know what Jesus is desiring in this
[23:22] moment? You know what he wants to feel
[23:24] from his disciples is sympathy.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; He actually wants them to be there with
[23:29] him. And he's expressing this very deep
[23:31] desire and hungry for sympathy from
[23:33] those he loved.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, he was the master and he was the
[23:37] teacher and he was the son of God. But
[23:38] in this difficult moment, he experiences
[23:42] how much it would mean to him if
[23:44] somebody else could enter into and feel
[23:47] what he was feeling and watch with him
[23:49] and pray with him.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; He expressed a desire. He wanted to feel
[23:55] sympathy from those that he loved.
[24:00] I shared this because I was thinking
[24:01] about it this week when I was studying
[24:02] on this. I remember one time, this was
[24:05] early on when computers were becoming
[24:07] more common in households and one of the
[24:10] first computers we had and uh I was on
[24:13] the computer and it was kind of late at
[24:14] night and we were uh I can't remember
[24:16] what even I was doing on the computer
[24:18] and just learning these things and I
[24:20] remember I deleted the DAT file or
[24:23] whatever like man this is a giant file
[24:24] that seems to be hogging a lot of my RAM
[24:26] right now, you know, and I'm thinking
[24:28] well I I deleted it and just everything
[24:30] fell apart immediately, right? for for
[24:32] those of you here who know uh floppy
[24:34] disc, you know exactly where I'm coming
[24:35] from. And I remember I was like, "How in
[24:38] the world am I going to fix this? I
[24:39] don't know what to do." And my brother
[24:40] Dave was like, "I'm going to bed." I was
[24:42] like, "No, no, no, no. Stay. Just sit
[24:45] here. Stay with me. I've just destroyed
[24:47] this thing." And I didn't think he he
[24:50] wasn't going to be able to help me, but
[24:51] I just wanted someone to be there with
[24:53] me. And in that way, I was very
[24:56] Christlike. Watch with me. You can't
[24:58] keep me from this death. you can't fix
[25:00] the computer, but just sympathize with
[25:02] me.
[25:04] And he stayed with me. We figured it
[25:06] out. Got Microsoft support on the line.
[25:10] And we're going, this is back in the mid
[25:13] 90s, I believe. So, this is quite a
[25:15] while ago. But Jesus
[25:19] desired sympathy from those he loved.
[25:21] And having felt the hunger for sympathy
[25:25] and the need for sympathy, he now
[25:28] sympathizes with your sufferings.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; He knows just how much you will feel at
[25:33] times a crave and a hunger for sympathy.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; That that's what you want. I know our
[25:39] minds may immediately go to Moses like
[25:40] Moses was looking for sympathy and God
[25:42] just kicked him around. Well, whenever
[25:44] you've been a prophet for those that
[25:46] many years, God may do that to you. But
[25:48] right now, where we sit as in this role
[25:50] playing exercise, we are the lowest of
[25:52] the lows with no reputation, pretending
[25:54] to be the neighbors in the apartment
[25:56] next door. Right? And what do we find
[25:57] ourselves? We find ourselves feeling
[25:59] very low and degraded. And God can
[26:01] sympathize
[26:02] with you.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; Why can he sympathize? Because he knows
[26:06] what it's like to want it.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; In Romans 8:es 1:5, there is therefore
[26:11] now no condemnation to them which are in
[26:13] Christ Jesus. Now this overlap with
[26:15] Sunday morning who walk not after the
[26:17] flesh but after the spirit. In Galatians
[26:19] Paul teaches that if we walk in the
[26:21] spirit we will resonate with the spirit
[26:23] and not respond to the temptations of
[26:25] the devil will not fulfill the lust of
[26:27] the flesh. There's this damping of this
[26:30] appropriate damping on that frequency or
[26:32] those chords that can be struck by
[26:34] temptation and the Holy Spirit
[26:36] suppressing that allows us then to be
[26:38] available to the resonation of the Holy
[26:40] Spirit. For the law of the spirit of
[26:42] life in Christ Jesus had made me free
[26:44] from the law of sin and death.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; For what the law could not do, and that
[26:47] it was weak through the flesh, God
[26:48] sending his own son in the likeness of
[26:50] sinful flesh. This is a repeated
[26:53] repeated refrain throughout scripture.
[26:56] Jesus Christ, the son of God, was sent
[26:58] in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
[27:01] sin condemn sin in the flesh.
[27:05] that the righteousness of the law might
[27:07] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[27:10] the flesh.
[27:12] Not us here, who walk not after the
[27:14] flesh, but after the spirit.
[27:19] For they that are after the flesh do
[27:21] mind
[27:22] the things of the flesh, care for,
[27:25] respond to, are moved by the things of
[27:28] the flesh. But they that are after the
[27:29] spirit, the things of the spirit. This
[27:32] is a new resonance. When Christ was in
[27:35] his flesh, he related and resonated to
[27:37] the things of man. He could be tempted
[27:39] like as a man uh yet without sin. He
[27:41] knew what it was like to experience pain
[27:42] and rejection and suffering. There's all
[27:45] these ways that Jesus Christ was made as
[27:47] a man. I say all these ways. I'm just
[27:49] want you to think of the full experience
[27:50] he had from birth until his death to
[27:53] where now he was able to condemn sin in
[27:56] his flesh
[27:57] and forever consecrate away so that you
[28:01] do not live solely according to that
[28:03] dynamic of being flesh tempted by sin
[28:08] &gt;&gt; but could now after the spirit mind the
[28:10] things of the spirit. It's a new
[28:12] resonance.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; As long as you're only human and
[28:16] strictly only an individual. If we only
[28:19] remained uh uh the sin the after our
[28:22] sinful birth, then there's just that
[28:24] constant resonance as it says here, they
[28:26] that mind the fle or after the flesh
[28:28] mind the things of the flesh. If that's
[28:30] all you are is after the flesh, that's
[28:32] what you respond to.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; But this is a new resonance. Not after
[28:36] the flesh to sin, but after the word.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a resonance after the word.
[28:43] This new resonance, we can put it in
[28:45] this context. Now, there's faith
[28:48] and this in this new resonance, faith is
[28:51] what provokes and even responds to the
[28:53] sympathy of God in Christ.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Because now you have faith which is
[28:58] which feeds off the word.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; And it's like those two omnipotents. You
[29:02] had the frequency of the word and what
[29:04] does faith do? Responds right back with
[29:05] the same frequency
[29:07] &gt;&gt; and it meets it.
[29:09] We don't have this before the birth, the
[29:11] new birth. So those who have received
[29:14] his spirit now have a new resonance
[29:17] in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:es 9-16.
[29:21] But as it is written, I have not seen
[29:23] nor ear heard, neither have entered into
[29:24] the heart of men the things which God
[29:26] hath prepared for them that love him.
[29:28] Growing up and just in my experience, I
[29:31] found that most often when this
[29:32] scripture was read, it was almost as if
[29:33] we closed the Bible and said, "You're
[29:34] just going to have to stay there not
[29:36] knowing."
[29:38] But uh there is a there's a big butt
[29:39] here. Verse 10, but God hath revealed
[29:43] them unto us by his spirit. Even
[29:45] revealed past tense.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; There's a way that the devil wants to
[29:48] say, well, 1 Corinthians chapter 2:9.
[29:52] And then I think the Holy Spirit should
[29:53] resonate. But 1 Corinthians chapter
[29:55] 2:10,
[29:57] God's revealed these things that God has
[29:59] prepared for you.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; He's revealed them to us by his spirit.
[30:03] For the spirit searchth all things, yay,
[30:05] the deep things of God. Now this might
[30:08] be you might say well this is just a
[30:09] common trope by brother Aaron to use
[30:10] these scriptures but he says for what
[30:12] man knoweth the things of man save the
[30:14] spirit of man which is in him.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; What example do I often give when I read
[30:17] the scripture?
[30:20] Dogs rolling around in their own scat
[30:23] right in the backyard and loving every
[30:25] minute of it. And we look at that as
[30:27] humans like oh my goodness what is he
[30:30] doing? Where is the dog next door? It's
[30:31] like right on buddy.
[30:33] I'll be doing that later willing. Right?
[30:36] They they relate to one another by these
[30:38] spirits that they have. For what man
[30:40] knoweth the things of man, save the
[30:41] spirit of man which is in him? They that
[30:43] are after the flesh mind for care for or
[30:45] moved by the things of the flesh. And we
[30:47] know and can relate to other humans
[30:49] because we are human.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. In the day and age that
[30:53] we're living in, one of the one of the
[30:56] uh most harmful things I think that the
[30:58] devil gets over on us is he starts
[30:59] making us less human
[31:03] &gt;&gt; by changing our humanity
[31:05] &gt;&gt; where it's avatars and synthesized
[31:07] reality and different personas that
[31:10] become all digital and we hide behind
[31:12] man-made imaginations and figments of
[31:14] well I identify with this and I and we
[31:16] could have these constructs. They're not
[31:18] even human anymore.
[31:20] biologically they belong to Hollywood
[31:23] because it's just the imagination of a
[31:25] man who creates worlds and and and
[31:28] genders and relationships. It's all
[31:31] fiction
[31:32] &gt;&gt; that's been portrayed through media.
[31:33] There's no reality to it. It's solely
[31:35] for the means of entertainment. And now
[31:37] people begin to live in that. And what
[31:38] have they become? Less human
[31:41] &gt;&gt; because there's ways that we can divide
[31:43] what is humanity. Right.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; We used to be able to say that humanity
[31:48] is comprised of male and female. We
[31:51] found out a brother was expecting a baby
[31:52] the other day with his wife. He and his
[31:54] wife were expecting and the brother was
[31:56] on the phone and it was on speaker phone
[31:58] and the brother said, "I can just be I'm
[31:59] 100% positive. I'm absolutely sure it's
[32:01] going to be a boy or a girl." I was
[32:03] like, "Amen to that." And maybe that
[32:05] needs to be said. But you know, things
[32:07] have changed now where you can have
[32:08] things that aren't human. It's just not
[32:10] human. Thank you.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Even so, the things of God knoweth no
[32:14] man, but the spirit of God. So there he
[32:17] says there's a a way that we relate with
[32:19] the spirit of God. Now we have received
[32:21] not the spirit of the world, but the
[32:22] spirit which is of God, that we might
[32:23] know the things that are freely given to
[32:25] us of God, which things also we speak,
[32:27] not in the words which man's wisdom
[32:29] teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost
[32:30] teacheth, comparing spiritual things
[32:32] with spiritual. Brother Alfonso, aren't
[32:34] you glad you're not interpreting me
[32:35] tonight? I am like just on. We've
[32:38] cranked this up to 12 here. But the
[32:40] natural man receiveth not the things of
[32:42] the spirit of God, for they are
[32:44] foolishness unto him. Neither can he
[32:46] know them, because they are spiritually
[32:48] discerned.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Things of God, things of man. Natural
[32:51] man, spiritual man. But he that is
[32:53] spiritual judgeth all things, yet he
[32:54] himself is judged of no man.
[32:57] A lot of rich things here. I'm just
[32:59] wanting to get this picture of how
[33:00] Paul's describing this. For who hath
[33:01] known the mind of the Lord that he may
[33:02] instruct him? And he says, "But we have
[33:05] the mind of Christ."
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Now, when you receive the mind of
[33:10] Christ, I want you hopefully you're
[33:11] following me in this uh very hurried and
[33:14] uh uh fast-paced service sermon tonight.
[33:17] Christ is sympathetic to you. Christ
[33:21] having experienced humanity now has
[33:24] ascended into heaven fully glorified
[33:26] there as a high priest supernaturally
[33:28] who liveth and abideth forever who can
[33:30] be touched now by your human weaknesses
[33:33] and your temptations and can adapt
[33:35] himself to you individually and whatever
[33:37] you're going through and this is the
[33:39] heart of Christ which is above but now
[33:42] we have the mind of Christ
[33:44] &gt;&gt; so in the same way there ought to be
[33:46] this blending of the word and flesh
[33:49] where the lives that we have lived. We
[33:51] can become sympathetic to those who are
[33:53] lost, those who are hurting, those who
[33:54] are backslid, those who are deceived,
[33:56] those who are lusting, those who fall in
[33:58] all these different ways. But now it's
[34:00] joined together with the heart of God so
[34:02] that we have become a part of God's
[34:05] sympathy.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not using this now just to get a
[34:10] bunch of amens or hands raised, but how
[34:12] many of us have heard of sympathy pains?
[34:17] And it can be really interesting how
[34:19] they manifest in different ones. But
[34:21] sympathy pains probably do not need any
[34:24] uh defining. But it's when you
[34:26] physically or emotionally feel echoes
[34:29] of what you see another person is going
[34:31] through.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; You emotionally or even physically feel
[34:36] you resonate with another's discomfort.
[34:39] One of the worst kinds of embarrassment
[34:41] is secondhand embarrassment. What is
[34:43] that? That's it's like a sympathetic
[34:44] response.
[34:47] There is when you see somebody else uh
[34:49] something happened like somebody is
[34:51] telling you, "Oh man, the other day I
[34:52] was I was carrying a load of firewood
[34:55] and I went around real quick behind the
[34:56] pickup truck and I kicked my shin right
[34:58] into the the uh the ball and hitch." And
[35:02] what do we see? Some of you probably
[35:04] felt it right now. There's a brother
[35:05] back there cringing.
[35:08] He he might be bleeding in the shin
[35:10] right now just because of it. Why?
[35:12] Because immediately we're like, "Oh."
[35:14] and someone says, "Oh man, I had this
[35:15] happen the other day." And you start
[35:16] going, "I'm getting sympathy pain.
[35:17] Stop." We begin to actually feel a
[35:21] response within our bodies
[35:24] &gt;&gt; because we can what? Identify.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; And you tell that story to a narcissist,
[35:29] they're like, "I have no idea what
[35:30] you're talking about.
[35:33] My uh investment in Bitcoin went up
[35:35] today."
[35:38] And you're like, "Oh, okay. Well, my my
[35:40] shin has a like an indentation into it
[35:42] now." You feel me? You know what? No.
[35:44] Uh-uh. I'm smart enough to not do that.
[35:50] They even have done brain imaging and
[35:52] whenever someone is witnessing someone
[35:54] else's pain or discomfort
[35:56] and in this brain imaging someone's pain
[35:58] when someone else is going through pain
[36:00] when you saw that brother uh kick his
[36:03] shin against his truck hitch his trailer
[36:06] hitch that that pain when we visualize
[36:09] that and see that it actually activates
[36:12] the neural regions in our minds that are
[36:15] active in that brother when he's hurt.
[36:19] the same spot. And that's why when you
[36:22] see it, you're like, "Oh, it's like,
[36:24] wait, who got hurt? Me or you?"
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Because it's the same part of the brain.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; And they find it especially in the parts
[36:31] that process the emotional part of pain.
[36:34] This is what sympathy pains are. I meant
[36:37] to look this up. I've just been reading
[36:39] it as I study. And I don't know if any
[36:40] brothers want to um identify with this
[36:42] or not, but it's syndrome. Anybody ever
[36:45] heard of it? Kuv, I don't know. COVID
[36:47] cuade syndrome. It's when a husband of
[36:50] an expectant wife develops pregnancy-
[36:53] like symptoms. And I know what you're
[36:54] all thinking right now, but no,
[36:57] my wife's not pregnant. Uh these
[36:59] symptoms I've come on my own, honestly.
[37:03] And these can literally be nausea,
[37:06] weight gain. Come on, give me some
[37:07] amens. Even labor like cramps.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; And I know some brothers going to be
[37:11] using this. I don't know. I think you
[37:13] should stream the service. Brother Aaron
[37:15] told you exactly why I'm this way.
[37:17] You're expecting I'm moody now. I'm
[37:19] overweight. I'm nauseous. I I feel
[37:22] cramped. Can I just sleep in today? Can
[37:24] you run and go get me a smash burger,
[37:26] extra sauce?
[37:28] And this is all within a human's ability
[37:31] to relate. And so now you have men whose
[37:33] wives are pregnant and they begin to
[37:36] develop physically and emotionally the
[37:38] same way she is.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; It's the human capacity for sympathy.
[37:42] Your mind, they say, has a mirroring
[37:43] system that simulates others actions and
[37:46] sensations internally
[37:49] that you see what they're going through
[37:50] and you internalize it and you process
[37:52] it. And that's why it helps us
[37:54] understand what other people are going
[37:56] through and actually begin to predict
[37:57] their experience and know even sometimes
[37:59] what's awaiting them, know exactly what
[38:01] they're going through.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; It's our means of re of relating to
[38:05] someone, anticipating and even
[38:07] responding to people in need.
[38:10] They say that your brain and your body
[38:11] sync with another state.
[38:14] And they say sometimes without even any
[38:16] conscious intent,
[38:17] &gt;&gt; you immediately begin to feel what
[38:19] they're feeling. You be immediately
[38:21] sometimes begin to know what they're
[38:22] going through, what they need, even if
[38:24] they don't see it, know it themselves.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Now, do you realize how dangerous it
[38:28] would be as a Christian to lose that?
[38:32] He says in Philippians chapter 2, Paul
[38:34] now in verses 2 to 5, as we've read
[38:36] already from this chapter, fulfill you
[38:38] my joy that you be like-minded, having
[38:39] the same love, being of one accord, of
[38:41] one mind. Notice this one mind. We've
[38:45] already read about it here in the
[38:46] scripture how he's talking about us who
[38:49] are uh made free in this oneness, this
[38:51] one mind. And even as he mentions it in
[38:54] first Corinthians, we are of one mind,
[38:56] of one accord. Let nothing be done
[38:58] through strife or vain glory. That's
[39:00] division, politicking, partymaking. But
[39:02] in loneliness of mind, let each esteem
[39:05] other better than themselves. Every time
[39:08] I read that lowliness of mind, it
[39:09] reminds me is the worm in busy town
[39:12] lowly. Yeah. See, we need to we need to
[39:15] be like worms.
[39:16] Loneliness of mind. Let each esteem
[39:19] other better than themselves. We all
[39:20] can't be hucklecat, right?
[39:24] Look not every man on his own things,
[39:25] but every man also on the things of
[39:27] others. This is looking beyond yourself.
[39:31] And look, if you lose feeling in
[39:32] yourself and you don't you're not
[39:34] self-conscious or aware of what you're
[39:35] going through, then you're you could be
[39:37] over there thinking like, well, I have
[39:38] everything under control and look at
[39:39] that guy who clearly doesn't. And now
[39:41] you're only concerned about everybody
[39:43] else's business, right? That's not what
[39:45] he's asking. From your own vantage point
[39:46] of need and bankruptcy and nakedness and
[39:49] your own loneliness of mind, you begin
[39:51] to look at others and say, "Oh, I know
[39:52] what it's like. I know what they're
[39:53] going through." And he says, "Let this
[39:55] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[39:58] Jesus."
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is a new way of processing
[40:02] pain. It's a new way of processing
[40:05] rejection. It's a new way of processing
[40:07] the suffering of yourself and others.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; It's a new way of processing evil and
[40:12] darkness.
[40:14] And something really began to uh kind of
[40:17] uh stand out to me as I've been studying
[40:19] on this subject over the last couple
[40:21] months is in the dangers of our modern
[40:24] thought process. And we could blame it
[40:25] on postmodernism. And I think they
[40:26] deserve that blame, but a lot of it is
[40:28] even just the evolution of western
[40:30] culture. And we have this emphasis and I
[40:33] say it ties into the spirit of Leodysia
[40:35] that there's this individualism
[40:37] &gt;&gt; right
[40:38] &gt;&gt; and this relativism where everyone is
[40:41] afforded their own reality, their own
[40:44] individual uh convictions and it's this
[40:46] individualism. And so there's this idea
[40:48] that one can establish personal
[40:50] boundaries and this independence.
[40:53] And when we do that, we might think that
[40:54] we're honoring somebody by letting their
[40:57] them have their autonomy and let them be
[40:59] who they want to be and that we're we're
[41:00] giving everybody this individual basis.
[41:02] But what happens is we begin to reframe
[41:05] what even sympathy pain is.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; And when you feel for somebody else, you
[41:09] begin to feel for somebody else. And now
[41:11] you're just a uh you're just a nosy and
[41:13] you're controlling and you just want to
[41:14] do this and you you don't really care
[41:16] about my autonomy. And we reframe it as
[41:19] stress when you care about somebody
[41:20] else.
[41:22] Psychossematic is what they might call
[41:24] it. This is this is undue influence on
[41:27] you and this is bothering you and you
[41:29] shouldn't let them. And what we could
[41:30] say maybe is well you're just letting
[41:32] them live rentree in your head.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people who a lot of
[41:36] things that live rentree in our head. I
[41:38] think we need to figure out a way to
[41:39] monetize this. Yes.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; What's happened through this? When I
[41:46] can't sympathize with you because if I
[41:48] begin to feel sympathy, that stress on
[41:50] me individually or it imposes on your uh
[41:54] uh your free will. What happens is we
[41:56] lose that community, that community of
[41:58] feeling, we lose sympathy. And when we
[42:00] when we lose community, you either have
[42:02] lost community or you just replace it
[42:06] with cultish
[42:08] fetishes
[42:10] around other certain feelings and
[42:12] identities.
[42:14] You there's this need for sympathy.
[42:16] But if you begin to reject the basis of
[42:19] sympathy and you begin to reframe things
[42:20] individually and we're all autonomous,
[42:22] we all have our own individual needs and
[42:24] there's certain things. Then you'll
[42:25] still try to find community, but you'll
[42:27] you'll do it around things that are not
[42:29] pure
[42:31] &gt;&gt; around feelings and identities that they
[42:33] themselves are not sympathetic, but
[42:35] rather that's that petty human sympathy.
[42:39] If I could frame it this way, it was
[42:42] said of the telegraph that the telegraph
[42:44] changed things so much because now in
[42:46] the continuous scroll of information and
[42:48] these things, it changed the way we
[42:49] processed and re uh viewed information.
[42:51] Now let's just fast forward 150 years or
[42:54] whatever it is and you realize that now
[42:55] in this age of data and information it's
[42:57] deformed what knowledge is and
[42:59] intelligence is.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Do you realize now we don't even we
[43:03] don't even worry about actual
[43:04] intelligence because we can refer to we
[43:06] can rely on artificial intelligence.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; The reason why we could probably ask
[43:11] people here what's your phone number and
[43:12] some of you might be like what's my
[43:14] phone number Siri what's my phone number
[43:16] right that you I'm just making sure no
[43:18] devices are going off. There's a way
[43:21] that we have so relied upon digital
[43:25] exercise
[43:27] that our brains have not been exercised.
[43:29] Our minds haven't been exercised.
[43:31] And so today, knowledge means knowing a
[43:34] lot of things but not knowing about
[43:37] them.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what social media has reduced
[43:41] us to?
[43:42] &gt;&gt; We can know a lot of things
[43:45] even about people. We know a lot of
[43:48] things about people, but do you know the
[43:50] person?
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Right? How many know of the big
[43:53] engagement this this past week? I only
[43:56] know because it was on Brother Lucas's
[43:57] Twitter account who's is in his status,
[44:01] but his gym teacher got married to his
[44:03] English teacher.
[44:05] And it's like, "No, sorry buddy. That
[44:07] ain't my gym teacher. That ain't my
[44:10] English teacher. I don't know who they
[44:11] are other than it's just always in my
[44:13] face."
[44:15] And we can know a lot of things about
[44:17] things and about people, but you don't
[44:19] really know them
[44:21] &gt;&gt; because you see the veneer. You see the
[44:22] polish,
[44:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:26] &gt;&gt; And we have to really catch ourselves in
[44:29] this in the time that we're living.
[44:31] What's being w what's being wasted away
[44:33] is the fact that we become less human.
[44:35] We identified people less as humans and
[44:37] more commodities,
[44:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:40] &gt;&gt; And you're also the commodity.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:43] and and we're looking for clout. We're
[44:45] looking for belonging and all of it's
[44:46] been is synthetic. Now I hope this is
[44:48] really hitting home
[44:50] &gt;&gt; and we in losing sympathy now even as
[44:54] Christians as we try to separate from
[44:55] that we have so commodities made
[44:58] commodities out of sin and the world and
[45:00] the flesh and the devil and all these
[45:01] things are so evil to where we don't
[45:04] have sympathy anymore for the lost. Wow.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam's telling the story. I
[45:09] believe it's a blind Barnameus. And he
[45:10] says that in all the rush and the hubb
[45:12] hubhub of everything that was going on,
[45:13] he got knocked over and fell down. And
[45:15] he's just dramatizing. He says one lady
[45:17] stopped, a follower of Christ stopped
[45:18] and said, "Are you okay? You got knocked
[45:20] down." He says, "People that follow
[45:22] Jesus have sympathy for people like
[45:24] that." Amen.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; That that that's kind of rip the needle
[45:28] off the record kind of statement where
[45:30] all of a sudden you realize that we have
[45:32] portrayed and allowed ourselves to be
[45:34] influenced by personalities that have
[45:36] brought us further away from God's
[45:38] sympathy
[45:39] and put us more in the vein of of
[45:42] arrogant uh uh legalism. People have
[45:46] suffered tremendously at that. When we
[45:48] as Christians, though we might blush at
[45:50] sin and there might be things that
[45:51] greatly offend us, as followers of Jesus
[45:54] Christ, we should have sympathy for the
[45:57] less fortunate.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; When we see the blind leading the blind,
[46:01] we ought not to uh adapt one another and
[46:04] say, "Oh yeah, what's up? They're about
[46:05] to fall in a ditch."
[46:08] &gt;&gt; No, you ought to have sympathy for them.
[46:11] If you're a follower of Christ, you
[46:13] sympathize with people like that.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; In 1 Corinthians 12 22 to 26,
[46:22] brother Ian, don't turn that into a drop
[46:24] or a sound bite or anything like that or
[46:25] your ringtone.
[46:28] Nay, much more those and and by saying
[46:30] that it's a done deal. Just share it
[46:32] with me. Nay, much more those members of
[46:35] the body which seem to be more feeble
[46:38] are necessary. Remember this uh what
[46:40] we've been shared in this nakedness and
[46:42] this vulnerability and those members of
[46:43] the body which we think to be less
[46:45] honorable this necessity of evil lacking
[46:47] darkness void upon these we bestow more
[46:50] abundant honor and our uncumbly parts
[46:52] have we more abundant comeliness for our
[46:55] comely parts have no need no necessity
[46:58] maybe the strengths are obvious and the
[47:00] utility but God hath tempered the body
[47:01] together now here's this idea of one
[47:03] body having given more abundant honor to
[47:06] that part which lacked that there should
[47:07] be no schism division, separation in the
[47:10] body, but that the members should have
[47:12] the same care one for another.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; This is the body's sympathetic response.
[47:20] And whether one member suffer, all the
[47:23] members suffer with it. How is how is
[47:25] does that happen? Because you're part of
[47:26] the same body.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; There's no division. There's no
[47:29] separation. We haven't taken all the
[47:31] ministers and all the ministers over the
[47:33] age of 35 get to sit at this table at
[47:35] Ryan's, right? why all the sisters and
[47:37] all the kids have to sit in this other
[47:39] section, right? And they're the ones
[47:40] that have to get all the all the food at
[47:42] the buffet bar, right? And the
[47:43] minister's over there just waving their
[47:44] dirty plate here. Fill this up. You
[47:46] know, the deacons are there protecting
[47:47] them. What? You create this dichotomy so
[47:49] much between classes of people in a
[47:51] church and they're no longer able to
[47:53] feel. Yeah.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; One of the biggest things I think worst
[47:57] things that could happen to a pastor is
[48:00] when he feel he forgets that he's a
[48:02] sheep, too.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't think his wool stinks cuz
[48:08] he doesn't even have wool in his own
[48:09] eyes, right? He He's not bothered at
[48:12] all. He's just so high above you. I'm
[48:13] the shepherd. You're the sheep. Ignorant
[48:15] little sheep. And it's like, and really
[48:17] what you ought to be hearing is a pastor
[48:19] who says it, you ought to be hearing
[48:26] Because that's what a pastor is. He's
[48:27] just like the sheep
[48:29] &gt;&gt; because Jesus Christ himself, the chief
[48:31] shepherd, is still yet a bloody lamb.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; And when one member suffers, we all
[48:38] suffer with it. Or when one member is be
[48:40] honored, all members rejoice with it.
[48:42] That's the body's able, the body's
[48:44] ability to sympathize.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; That when one part hurts, the other one
[48:49] hurts. Yes.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; And this is and wouldn't you want that
[48:53] if you're going to the your garden of
[48:54] Gethsemane, wouldn't you want to be able
[48:56] to look at somebody and say, "Could you
[48:57] watch with me?"
[48:59] &gt;&gt; And say, "Man, I know I know what you're
[49:00] going through. I'll be praying for you
[49:02] tomorrow when you go in for that test. I
[49:04] know I know what you're going through."
[49:05] Begin to be feel for somebody. Brother
[49:08] Brandham identified it quite often in
[49:09] these prayer lines that when he'd have
[49:10] ministers stand there to pray, he didn't
[49:12] say, "These are men of God who are so
[49:14] wellstied in the message of the hour
[49:16] that they know just at the right
[49:17] frequency to scream at that demon
[49:18] that'll cause him to run."
[49:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "These men know what it's like
[49:22] to be sick.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; They know what it's like to be weak.
[49:26] They know what it's like to be
[49:27] struggle."
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Sympathetic resonance.
[49:33] I I I I I
[49:35] think I'm gonna keep going.
[49:40] And if if it's long tonight, there's
[49:41] people who can sympathize with you. I I
[49:44] can sympathize with you.
[49:47] Sympathetic response with God is maybe
[49:49] one of the most powerful things we have
[49:50] as believers. Yeah,
[49:52] &gt;&gt; one of the greatest things we possess,
[49:54] and maybe I'm just taking a known
[49:55] principle and putting another label on
[49:57] it, but hopefully by doing that, it
[49:58] broadens your understanding of what it
[50:00] is you possess. When you have the mind
[50:02] of Christ,
[50:04] &gt;&gt; you have the ability, the tuning to
[50:07] God's mind, and you have the tuning now
[50:10] of human nature as it's being refined
[50:12] that makes you Christlike.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; And so, a sympathetic response with God
[50:17] is one of the most powerful, wonderful
[50:19] things we possess as Christians. In 1
[50:22] Corinthians chapter 6:1 17, "But he that
[50:24] is joined into the Lord is one spirit."
[50:27] &gt;&gt; If we are yet but flesh, then we're one
[50:29] with the flesh. We identify solely with
[50:32] the flesh. But now, if you're joined in
[50:33] the Lord, you're one spirit. This is a
[50:35] tuning. This is a vibration. This is a
[50:38] feeling. This is a sensitivity. This is
[50:39] a discernment.
[50:42] And the sermon living, dying, buried,
[50:44] rising, coming. He says, "I'm so glad to
[50:47] know that he can be a found. He can be
[50:49] found amongst the brokenhearted.
[50:52] And in our sorrows, he's not one that
[50:54] would leave us. Maybe I should have put
[50:57] this up there, but I hope you're hearing
[50:58] the sound waves.
[51:01] In our sorrows, he's not one to leave
[51:03] you.
[51:06] He stands by us when all has failed and
[51:09] the last hopes of earthly reaching has
[51:12] come to its end. He's still God and he
[51:14] loves us. I think we think the exact
[51:16] opposite.
[51:18] We I think that when we get to the spot
[51:20] where we can't do anything else and all
[51:21] hopes is gone. It's at that moment that
[51:23] God's abandoned us, but because we've
[51:25] come to our end, it's at that moment
[51:27] saying, "God's saying, can I help now?"
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[51:31] &gt;&gt; You know, hey, I I could have stepped in
[51:34] earlier, but I love you. I got
[51:36] confidence in you and I I I'm watching
[51:38] out over you. He says, "But when you're
[51:39] going through it, he's not one to leave
[51:40] us." He stands there when all is failed.
[51:42] Hopes have come to an end. He still
[51:44] loves us. He was the expressing of God.
[51:46] Think of Jesus Christ now. How I believe
[51:50] that he longs for his people to be so
[51:53] anointed with his spirit
[51:56] that we could go to each other in trials
[51:58] and troubles and scream and shout and
[52:01] dance and flail and pass out.
[52:05] Sorry, I sorry. We could go to each
[52:09] other in trials and troubles and give
[52:11] the expression of his sympathy
[52:15] &gt;&gt; as it pours from our hearts that's been
[52:17] born of his spirit to reflect in the
[52:18] church the love of the living God.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; And he refers to the poet that well
[52:23] expressed what the poet said living he
[52:25] loved me.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Living he loved me. Now you living
[52:30] you living. He says I want to be so
[52:32] anointed with his spirit. Now I know
[52:35] that what that begins to do. There was a
[52:36] time in my life when I'd begin to read
[52:37] that and I'd say, "Watch out squirrels.
[52:39] You're coming." Right? We're going to be
[52:42] eating squirrel soup for months, right?
[52:44] You're just going to create it, right?
[52:45] I'm going to speak I'm going to speak a
[52:47] truck into existence. Bundles of cash
[52:50] right under my bed. It's coming. But he
[52:53] says, "Get so anointed with the spirit
[52:55] that you would enter into somebody
[52:56] else's burden and express his sympathy."
[53:01] &gt;&gt; How pitiful is that?
[53:03] That's not the John Wayne Jesus I want
[53:05] to serve. Come on. Let's go beat up the
[53:08] devil. But no, he says get to the point
[53:10] to where you could be so anointed where
[53:12] you give expression of his symphony as
[53:14] it pour symphony
[53:17] kuban as it pours from our hearts it's
[53:19] been born of his spirit
[53:21] &gt;&gt; to reflect the love of the living God.
[53:24] Amen.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12:12 12-4. For as the
[53:28] body is one and hath many members, and
[53:30] all the members of that one body being
[53:31] member are in one body, so also is
[53:33] Christ. You are joined to God in one
[53:36] spirit. For by one spirit are we all
[53:38] baptized into one body, whether we be
[53:41] Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
[53:43] free, and have all been made to drink
[53:45] into one spirit. What is that
[53:46] experience?
[53:49] &gt;&gt; For the body is not one member but many.
[53:52] Uh I thought some of you maybe are well
[53:54] verssed in the body's own sympathetic
[53:57] nervous system.
[53:59] There's a Christ Christ sympathetic
[54:02] nervous system then for this body.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; In the same way that we have fight or
[54:06] flight and we have certain responses and
[54:07] that the body in response to danger
[54:09] there's certain biological processes
[54:11] that fire off for the preservation of
[54:13] life for survival. And so Christ has a
[54:17] sympathetic nervous system that is act.
[54:19] It's an activated unconscious response.
[54:25] That's what a sympathetic nervous system
[54:26] refers to certain body parts subject to
[54:28] the a common nervous system influence.
[54:32] If you're a member of the body, then you
[54:34] must avail yourself to that process. So
[54:38] anointed of the Holy Spirit that you can
[54:39] give expression of his sympathy. This is
[54:42] where the principle of actually being
[54:43] numb and not full of faith when you
[54:46] can't be moved anymore by other people's
[54:47] experiences. Man, I'm just so I'm so
[54:50] solid in the faith. I don't care what
[54:51] happens to anybody anymore. Just so
[54:53] grounded in the word myself personally
[54:55] that everybody else could just be dying
[54:57] and falling away and suffering and I'm
[54:59] just over there saying, "Thank you,
[55:00] God." Right? Well, there's that's not
[55:03] that's not faith.
[55:05] I I say this to comfort you that when
[55:07] when you grieve over somebody else's
[55:09] loss, when you feel the pain of
[55:11] something else, this is a Christlike
[55:12] response.
[55:14] Now, it's not nervousness and it's not
[55:16] panic and it's not doubt.
[55:18] And the sermon lean not to thine own
[55:20] understanding. And brother Benham says
[55:21] this in a number of different places
[55:22] from different uh aspects. There's times
[55:25] when he's saying this person over here
[55:26] has cancer and he says there's a dark
[55:28] line between them because this person
[55:29] over here has cancer of the same kind.
[55:31] He says what are they doing? They're
[55:32] crying out to one another.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Right? What is that? That's a
[55:35] sympathetic response.
[55:37] He says that you might know that God is
[55:39] present. There's a lady sitting right
[55:40] next to her. And this was a woman from
[55:41] California. This is a woman with I
[55:43] believe with cancer. He said her name is
[55:45] Mrs. Harris. She's a total stranger to
[55:46] me. But when the spirit struck this
[55:48] woman, she also in sympathy with her.
[55:52] She had sympathy.
[55:54] And she comes from California and she's
[55:56] got trouble with her shoulder. You
[55:57] believe that God will heal you? If
[55:59] that's true, raise up your hand so the
[56:00] people can see. Total stranger. He says,
[56:02] "Lean not to your own understanding."
[56:04] What can do that? You can't explain
[56:05] that. That's a paradox. It's beyond
[56:07] explaining.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Now, we could maybe begin to explain
[56:12] what happened between the one that had
[56:13] cancer and the other one had cancer.
[56:15] When this person was healed, something
[56:16] in her resonated,
[56:18] &gt;&gt; something responded and God saw the
[56:20] sympathetic response and in response to
[56:23] her response, she got healed.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; It wasn't in the way that he describes
[56:28] this in different places. It's not that
[56:30] the person just said, "Wow, this Mr.
[56:32] Brandom is so charismatic."
[56:34] When she saw that the spirit struck them
[56:37] and she received her healing. There was
[56:39] some sympathy. Maybe there was, "Oh, I'm
[56:41] so happy for you. I've got the same
[56:44] thing and God healed you." And in having
[56:47] the right response, do you realize that
[56:49] if we had the right response to somebody
[56:51] else's blessing, when you find out that
[56:53] this person's expecting, instead of say,
[56:54] "Well, I don't know if I'll ever have a
[56:56] baby." you find out this person's
[56:57] engaged like they got engaged and I
[57:00] haven't. This is a cruel world, but if
[57:03] you could find a way to rejoice in
[57:04] somebody else, God sees that kind of
[57:06] sympathetic response. Your blessings on
[57:08] the way.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; This may seem to be a unique scripture,
[57:14] but
[57:16] I I found this in the message of the
[57:17] hour and it just really really uh
[57:19] impacted me. In Acts chapter 3, I'll
[57:21] read the whole story from verses 1 to
[57:22] 10. Now Peter and John went up together
[57:24] into the temple at the hour of prayer.
[57:26] This is after Acts chapter 2. They're
[57:27] now filled with the Holy Ghost being in
[57:29] the ninth hour. And a certain man lame
[57:31] from his mother's womb was carried whom
[57:33] they laid daily at the gate of the
[57:34] temple which is called beautiful to ask
[57:36] alms of them that entered into the
[57:38] temple. He is relying upon the goodness
[57:40] of people the alms and even their
[57:42] obedience to the word that would provide
[57:43] alms to the needy. Who seeing Peter and
[57:46] John about to go into the temple asked
[57:49] an alms can I have can I have some
[57:51] money? And Peter, it says, "Fastening
[57:54] his eyes upon him with John." So he's
[57:57] letting this person know that he's seen.
[58:00] This is the opposite of what we do at a
[58:02] stop sign or a stoplight in Phoenix,
[58:05] &gt;&gt; right? Eyes straight ahead, doors
[58:07] locked, windows up.
[58:11] No. Is there somebody next to me? No. I
[58:13] have no idea.
[58:16] Don't see him. Right. Look straight
[58:18] ahead. But here Peter fastens his eyes
[58:20] upon him and said, "Look on us." Notice
[58:23] that that that look on us. I I see you.
[58:27] You see me. There's this connection that
[58:29] begins to take place.
[58:32] And he gave heed unto them expecting to
[58:33] receive something of them. Then Peter
[58:35] said, "Silver and gold have I none, but
[58:37] such as I have I give thee. In the name
[58:39] of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and
[58:41] walk."
[58:43] It may not look like it, but this is a
[58:45] sympathetic response.
[58:47] the need in this one who had been lame
[58:50] from birth was wanting alms. But Peter's
[58:53] able to get into uh into a greater sense
[58:56] of what his need was. And he says, I
[58:59] silver and gold have I none. And he's
[59:01] not lying. He's being honest. But what I
[59:03] have, I give you in the name of Jesus
[59:05] Christ. Rise up and walk. And he took
[59:06] him by the right hand and lifted him up.
[59:08] And immediately his feet and ankles and
[59:09] bones receive strength. Feet and ankle
[59:11] bones receive strength. There's a verse
[59:13] for you, Brother Scott. And he leaping
[59:15] up stood and walked and entering with
[59:17] them into the temple, walking and
[59:18] leaping and praising God. And all the
[59:20] people saw him walking and praising God.
[59:22] And they knew that it was he which sat
[59:24] for alms at the beautiful gate of the
[59:25] temple. And they were filled with wonder
[59:27] and amazement at which had happened unto
[59:30] him.
[59:32] Peter had sympathy to this one.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't just kick a quarter into the
[59:36] the cup. He wouldn't even dismiss him.
[59:40] Well, if you had any faith to believe,
[59:43] you from around here, how many times did
[59:44] you see Jesus in the temple? Sometimes
[59:46] we could be so dismissive. Brother
[59:48] Brandham says in the sermon, without
[59:49] money or without price,
[59:52] this is speaking about Peter. He'd been
[59:53] to buy from him that had money and the
[59:56] joys of the wine of salvation. He had
[59:58] just come two or three days before that
[1:00:00] from Pentecost where something had
[1:00:02] happened. And the young man sprung with
[1:00:03] a great amen to it and looked into his
[1:00:05] face. What happened? the chain of
[1:00:08] sympathy,
[1:00:10] the compassion of him that said, "I have
[1:00:12] compassion on the sick." That same
[1:00:14] spirit had taken place in the old
[1:00:16] fisherman's heart. He said, "As far as
[1:00:18] money, I have none, but I got something
[1:00:19] that'll take its place a million times
[1:00:21] such as I have." What activated what he
[1:00:24] had? What became the channel through
[1:00:27] which the wealth he had, the riches he
[1:00:29] had, the power he had, what became the
[1:00:31] means by which that could re uh resonate
[1:00:34] with the sick to heal them? No
[1:00:36] posturing, no politics. No, we're better
[1:00:39] than you. No, we're the we are the ones
[1:00:41] that can lay our hands on you. But
[1:00:43] rather, it was such as I have. Brother
[1:00:45] Brandham called, as you can see here,
[1:00:46] the chain of sympathy where the
[1:00:50] compassion that Christ had, the sympathy
[1:00:51] that Christ had is now in the heart of a
[1:00:55] son of God who is human, who's been
[1:00:57] tempted, who suffered, but now has the
[1:01:00] spirit with it just as Christ would
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; and he could have sympathy.
[1:01:05] In 1 Corinthians chapter 10 16 to17
[1:01:09] Paul in talking about our communion says
[1:01:11] this cup of blessing remember in 1
[1:01:12] Corinthians uh 12 he says we all drink
[1:01:15] of the same spirit now he says this cup
[1:01:17] of blessing which we bless is it not the
[1:01:19] communion of the blood of Christ the
[1:01:22] bread which we break is it not the
[1:01:23] communion of the body of Christ again
[1:01:26] these letters would seem to be quite
[1:01:28] striking if you didn't have a revelation
[1:01:29] of what he was referring to for we being
[1:01:32] many are one bread and one body many
[1:01:34] members, many callings, many different
[1:01:36] situations, many different struggles and
[1:01:38] trials, but we're still one body. For we
[1:01:40] are all partakers of that one bread.
[1:01:44] This is how we're able to sympathize
[1:01:46] with one another. Peter had to go to
[1:01:48] that fountain and buy that which had
[1:01:50] that had that honey and the joys and the
[1:01:52] wines of salvation. When he received
[1:01:54] that, there's a different experience now
[1:01:56] inside of him that allows him to
[1:01:57] empathize.
[1:01:59] We are when we are in Christ made to
[1:02:02] drink of the same spirit and eating the
[1:02:04] same bread. We become one sonic society.
[1:02:08] We become one. As we partakers of the
[1:02:10] one spirit and eat of the one bread, the
[1:02:13] Bible is saying as you read these
[1:02:14] scriptures, we coales and we combine
[1:02:16] into one loaf.
[1:02:19] We're bound and united to Christ. And
[1:02:23] therefore being bound and united to
[1:02:25] Christ, I'm we're bound and united to
[1:02:26] one another like a hundred pianos all
[1:02:28] tuned by the same tuning fork.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandon when he
[1:02:33] teaches on the Lord's supper, he said
[1:02:35] this Lord's supper and eating communion,
[1:02:36] it's a revelation that I'm a part of him
[1:02:38] and I'm a part of you.
[1:02:42] When people don't partake of it
[1:02:43] sympathetically, they heap conde
[1:02:45] condemnation on themselves.
[1:02:47] That's just Bible.
[1:02:56] In the sermon shalom,
[1:02:59] I like to read. It's lengthy.
[1:03:02] This wanting you to think about this
[1:03:03] sympathetic resonance. And I think it's
[1:03:05] multi-layered in terms of our response
[1:03:07] to the word, but now how's the word
[1:03:08] responding in us to the word, but now
[1:03:10] also how is Christ in us responding with
[1:03:12] other people? Maybe you could look at as
[1:03:14] I'm the one that's weak and I I've
[1:03:16] become a little inert and I I don't have
[1:03:18] any nothing's moving me and I I've
[1:03:20] become very uh uh stale in my
[1:03:23] experience. Oh God, I I need someone to
[1:03:26] resonate
[1:03:28] and quicken me. Brother Brandham says
[1:03:30] this, it's paragraph 180. He says, "Man
[1:03:33] could close his mortal eyes to earthly
[1:03:35] sight and live in the presence of Jesus
[1:03:36] Christ."
[1:03:39] When you see his word beat out in the
[1:03:41] great sympathy that we're living in now,
[1:03:45] changing remember brother called it a
[1:03:47] sympathy over and over again.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; And even though he comes later and he
[1:03:51] says, "Am I saying that right?" And and
[1:03:53] he says symphony here in a moment. But
[1:03:55] yet think of the application
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; in the great sympathy
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; that's beating now heart
[1:04:04] rhythm frequency vibration are you
[1:04:08] vibing with the Lord that's the subject
[1:04:10] of the next youth meeting the aura of
[1:04:12] Christ you must begin in the symphony
[1:04:15] excuse me he says symphony here now I'm
[1:04:17] doing it you must begin in the symphony
[1:04:19] the only thing you can do if you're in
[1:04:21] the symphony then you start you begin to
[1:04:23] get into the rhythm
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; a sympathetic response.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; That's the way you do God. You don't
[1:04:29] stand off and look at it. You get into
[1:04:31] the rhythm of it.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Let's not be spectators when we come to
[1:04:35] church. Let's participate actively in
[1:04:39] the preaching of the word and the
[1:04:41] partaking in the communion a and the way
[1:04:43] that we fellowship one with another. Oh,
[1:04:45] it's so important that we not just come
[1:04:47] as a spectator.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; He says you get into the rhythm of it.
[1:04:52] How do you get in there? You're born
[1:04:54] into it. into the rhythm of the word.
[1:04:55] And when you become a part of that word,
[1:04:57] now come on, listen. You had to become
[1:05:00] part of the dance to get out of the
[1:05:02] dance.
[1:05:04] You have to become part of the ball
[1:05:06] game. Something you're interested in to
[1:05:08] get in the ball game,
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; right? How many people go to these ball
[1:05:12] games and they could care less? Listen,
[1:05:14] for all those guys who are making fun of
[1:05:16] Swifties who fawn over Taylor Swift and
[1:05:19] act all crazy are the same ones with
[1:05:22] painted faces and Kelsey jerseys on
[1:05:24] going
[1:05:25] on Sunday just the same.
[1:05:32] He says to get into the ball game is
[1:05:34] something you're interested in. You get
[1:05:36] in the ball game.
[1:05:38] You got to become part of the word
[1:05:41] to know God's sympathy.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; His sympathy is when it's playing. You
[1:05:48] understand? You're marching with the
[1:05:50] beat of the time.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; You're watching for it. The works that I
[1:05:54] do shall you also greater than this
[1:05:56] shall you do. The last days, the great
[1:05:59] changing of time. We get into the beat
[1:06:01] of the word. Find his purpose. The hour
[1:06:04] that we're living in. Get into the
[1:06:05] rhythm of how he does it. If you get
[1:06:08] into the word, you'll find out how he
[1:06:09] did it at the beginning. Then you know
[1:06:12] how he's doing it all the time.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Wow. Go keep reading these things. Get
[1:06:17] into it. It's very, very rich.
[1:06:19] Musicians, come. Let's stand to our
[1:06:20] feet.
[1:06:22] God's great sympathy.
[1:06:26] How do we become a part of it? When we
[1:06:28] get into the word
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; and now that we're in the word, then we
[1:06:32] begin to resonate with the word. Amen.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; And that's the only way that we know
[1:06:36] God's sympathy
[1:06:38] is then we begin to understand
[1:06:41] you're going to begin to relate to
[1:06:42] sinners differently.
[1:06:45] You'll begin to come to yourself in ways
[1:06:48] that's not just you being restored,
[1:06:53] but even those of you who at times were
[1:06:55] prodigal,
[1:06:58] those of you who are suffering from
[1:06:59] spiritual amnesia,
[1:07:02] you know what it's like to need to see a
[1:07:03] water tower.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; You know what it's like for someone to
[1:07:08] need to hear from God.
[1:07:12] Let's become more sympathetic.
[1:07:16] The devil would most likely, and I say
[1:07:18] most likely, the devil would want to
[1:07:19] twist my words and try to make it into
[1:07:23] something watered down. And it's it's
[1:07:25] advocating for spineless compassion and
[1:07:27] human sympathy. That's not it at all.
[1:07:32] is having the eyes of God to see someone
[1:07:34] as they are
[1:07:36] and the heart of God to be able to
[1:07:37] respond with sympathy
[1:07:41] such as I have.
[1:07:44] [Music]
[1:07:45] Let's just bow our heads in a word of
[1:07:47] prayer.
[1:07:52] Our gracious heavenly father, tonight as
[1:07:54] we close this service
[1:07:58] and we'll perhaps linger just a little
[1:07:59] bit and worship you. I pray tonight that
[1:08:03] at the very least as I'm admonishing
[1:08:05] real solid believers here tonight, such
[1:08:07] a good audience.
[1:08:09] And perhaps it may seem that there is
[1:08:11] some emphasis on us becoming more
[1:08:13] sympathetic Christians where the word of
[1:08:16] God is resonating from us. We're so
[1:08:17] anointed with your Holy Spirit that we
[1:08:20] are now working in that chain of
[1:08:22] sympathy
[1:08:24] and that we can have your heart be used
[1:08:27] by you for the help and benefit of
[1:08:29] others.
[1:08:30] But Lord, maybe tonight in reality, what
[1:08:33] we need to feel is your sympathy for us.
[1:08:38] that when we failed and we've made
[1:08:40] mistakes and we've struggled and we
[1:08:42] found ourselves doubting and hurt,
[1:08:44] confused,
[1:08:46] we can believe at this very moment that
[1:08:48] you love us and you have not abandoned
[1:08:49] us in our sorrow.
[1:08:52] But you are waiting for that moment when
[1:08:53] we could just look up and be honest with
[1:08:55] you and say, "Lord, I really need you
[1:08:57] right now."
[1:09:00] And that broken and contrite spirit
[1:09:03] resonates
[1:09:05] and you sympathize with it.
[1:09:09] And you remember that time in the garden
[1:09:11] when it was watch with me, Terry with
[1:09:13] me. Could you just wait?
[1:09:15] And you know how hard it hurts to be
[1:09:18] abandoned. You know how hard it hurts to
[1:09:21] be rejected, to be confused, to be sick,
[1:09:23] to be hurt.
[1:09:25] And so you're glad to come to our aid.
[1:09:28] So Lord, I pray that your word, the
[1:09:30] rhythm of your word would be your
[1:09:32] heartbeat towards us, that you love us,
[1:09:34] that you're for us, that you're
[1:09:36] steadfast.
[1:09:37] And Lord, the more comfortable we can
[1:09:39] become in your sympathy, the better able
[1:09:42] we are to beat out that rhythm in our
[1:09:44] own lives and become that chain of
[1:09:46] sympathy for others. We're never going
[1:09:49] to be able to say to be your voice and
[1:09:52] see the lost saved if we're arrogant.
[1:09:56] But when we become sympathetic,
[1:09:59] Lord, may this great sympathy of your
[1:10:02] word continue to resonate in us. May we
[1:10:04] have this sympathetic resonance to your
[1:10:06] word, Lord. And then now as Christ's own
[1:10:08] body, a member of your body, may we then
[1:10:10] feel for others and even those in the
[1:10:13] body appropriately. We ask all this in
[1:10:16] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
