[0:02] this uh this is part seven of Christ my
[0:04] healer and our Focus has been on uh
[0:08] Divine Healing and if you just look at
[0:12] verse 15 with me as he tells them to go
[0:15] into all the world and preach the gospel
[0:16] to Every Creature he that believes what
[0:19] is preached and is uh baptized shall be
[0:21] saved he who does not believe what is
[0:23] preached will not be baptized and
[0:25] therefore um it's not necessarily on
[0:27] hinges on the baptism but the lack of
[0:29] faith it says they'll be damned and it
[0:31] says these signs shall follow them that
[0:34] believe and one sign that is emphasized
[0:37] at the very end of that is the one sign
[0:39] that follows not just one but one of the
[0:41] signs that follows the Believers they
[0:43] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[0:46] shall recover so we're focusing on
[0:49] Divine Healing and this scripture uh
[0:51] speaks to that and the Very act that we
[0:53] would play in that in laying hands on
[0:55] the sick and the sick recovering and
[0:58] then verses 19 and 20 declares that the
[1:00] Lord they went forth they preached the
[1:02] gospel and the Lord was working with
[1:04] them and then there was a confirmation
[1:07] of the word by signs following the
[1:09] Believers and we could look into the
[1:10] book of Acts and see that the very
[1:13] things uh that Jesus said would follow
[1:15] them these signs shall fall them that
[1:17] believe these are written of in the book
[1:19] of Acts and it's recorded in the the
[1:21] ministries of the Apostles and the
[1:23] Believers and so God does that very
[1:25] thing in this commission and this is the
[1:28] order of the commission go preach the
[1:30] gospel to them that believe signs will
[1:33] follow so the gospels preach first Faith
[1:35] Comes second signs follow and brother
[1:39] brandom in the sermon as I as I was with
[1:41] Moses so will I be with
[1:43] thee this has been um a sermon that uh
[1:46] has so much meat to it on this subject
[1:48] he says listen don't you fail to get
[1:51] this the sign is not the commission the
[1:55] sign only points to the commission and
[1:58] so you can have a commission a job
[1:59] something something that you're to do or
[2:00] something you're to accomplish and then
[2:02] a sign be given and the sign is
[2:04] indicating it's time it's the moment
[2:06] this is when it needs to happen and we
[2:08] could get enamored with the sign or the
[2:11] signification of it but not actually be
[2:13] working in it to accomplish what it
[2:15] signifies he says the sign is not the
[2:17] commission the sign only points to the
[2:19] commission you get at her on the road
[2:21] and see a sign and it says five miles to
[2:23] Phoenix he says that isn't Phoenix
[2:25] that's a sign to show you you're on the
[2:28] right Road he says Jeffersonville here
[2:30] but we'll just uh update it for the West
[2:32] here you see a sign it says so many
[2:34] miles to a destination and that tells
[2:37] you you're on the right Road it's giving
[2:40] you an idea how near it is but he says
[2:42] that's not it and so the sign the sign
[2:45] can be very phenomenal and it can be
[2:48] very attention grabbing you have to
[2:50] realize that when there's a sign given
[2:52] there's the voice to follow it there's
[2:53] something that comes after it and so the
[2:56] sign Jeffersonville in 5 miles is
[2:58] telling you you're on the the right Road
[3:01] and in five miles if you know how to
[3:02] keep track of distance um you should be
[3:04] arriving at the limits and enter into
[3:07] the place that you're Desiring to be and
[3:10] so the sign is not the commission it
[3:12] only points to the commission so the
[3:13] order of the commission is that these
[3:16] are people who have caught the
[3:17] revelation of Jesus Christ and then are
[3:20] commissioned by this to go preach the
[3:23] gospel and in preaching the gospel
[3:25] people to are to believe and if they
[3:26] believe they'll be baptized and they
[3:28] shall be saved and then there's signs
[3:31] will follow those who are believers
[3:33] those who have received the revelation
[3:34] of Jesus Christ those who've been
[3:36] baptized and have been saved those who
[3:37] are preaching the gospel there signs
[3:39] that are to follow and brother Bram is
[3:42] saying the sign's not the
[3:44] commission and and in this particular
[3:46] sermon he's referring a lot to how his
[3:49] particular gifts and signs that operated
[3:51] in his ministry were becoming the focal
[3:53] point and he was deviating even from his
[3:56] commission now just because the sign
[3:58] isn't the commission doesn't mean the
[4:00] sign is
[4:01] worthless and so we just I I think what
[4:04] is important is we need to understand
[4:06] its purpose and its utility because
[4:08] there's this um there's a slippery slope
[4:11] sometimes when you you see something and
[4:13] it's gone off into fanaticism or there's
[4:15] too much emphasis on it or it's being
[4:17] misused and it's become the commission
[4:19] instead of the sign you might want to
[4:21] just kick back against it and cut down
[4:23] the sign like w people will figure it
[4:25] out when they get there well that's not
[4:27] how God works and so there's a way to
[4:29] understand the purpose of it and its
[4:31] utility and so my title today or
[4:34] subtitle is elevated faith and and in
[4:38] looking at elevated Faith we're wanting
[4:41] uh and there's so many things that I
[4:43] could put in here but I just elevated
[4:45] faith is going to speak to how Divine
[4:47] Healing relates to rapturing
[4:49] Faith where how do these fit in what's
[4:52] it for uh should be should we disregard
[4:56] Divine Healing should we speak against
[4:58] laying on hands uh what kind of attitude
[5:00] should we have towards Miracles and
[5:02] signs and wonders how do these things
[5:04] fit into rapturing Faith or we can say
[5:06] perfect faith and I'm wanting to use
[5:07] this phrase elevated Faith because
[5:10] brother Bron makes the statement this is
[5:11] something I really want to be at the
[5:13] focal part of it he says we want to have
[5:16] we want the greater faith we want to run
[5:19] a higher
[5:21] level we want the greater faith we want
[5:23] to run a higher level he says the Lord
[5:25] Jesus wants us to believe him and so
[5:28] elevated faith it's faith that raises
[5:31] above the usual position and and I just
[5:34] noticed on the slide something was a
[5:36] little off-centered so if I seem
[5:37] distracted uh I want to start all over
[5:39] scratch the slide deck can we come back
[5:41] at 11:30 and try this again but it's um
[5:46] the Lord Jesus wants us to believe him
[5:49] and and that's that That's the basis
[5:51] thing he says we want a greater Faith a
[5:53] higher level he says Lord Jesus wants us
[5:55] to believe them they're one and the same
[5:56] and to be elevated means to raise above
[5:59] usual ual position is to lift up or to
[6:02] promote and so if you raise something up
[6:05] you're elevating it from where it
[6:06] normally is if something that's where
[6:09] where it's been then it wouldn't be
[6:10] elevated but from where it's been if you
[6:12] raise it up that's to elevate someone's
[6:14] faith above its usual position to lift
[6:16] it up uh means to promote or to assign
[6:18] to a higher position and I like that to
[6:21] be exalted to to elevate to a higher
[6:25] position and that's that's uh that's
[6:27] kind of our thesis for elevated faith in
[6:29] the sermon and then Jesus came I want to
[6:33] use this to kind of set up what we're
[6:34] going to be looking at today brother
[6:36] br's talking about um healings and signs
[6:39] and wonders operating and uh he speaks
[6:42] about one boy being healed I believe and
[6:44] then he says in the vision of the woman
[6:45] that had the baby had showed the baby
[6:48] being crosseyed and this is a this baby
[6:51] has come to him he's had this Vision
[6:52] this baby comes to him in the prayer
[6:53] line we looked down to the baby its eyes
[6:55] were just as perfect as anybody's no one
[6:58] prayed no one touched at all nobody here
[7:01] but God touched the
[7:03] baby this is he's saying this baby was
[7:06] healed without any hands being laid on
[7:07] it the presence of the Lord was here to
[7:10] heal why did it get it it was a baby and
[7:13] then he says it don't have the
[7:15] superstitions and calluses in wonderings
[7:18] that we
[7:19] have is that remarkable to think here's
[7:21] a baby that in my mind I'm thinking if a
[7:23] woman's holding a baby and the baby
[7:24] comes up maybe the baby's not catching
[7:26] anything that happens but God's present
[7:29] to touch touch and because the baby has
[7:32] if I could just say this an unconscious
[7:34] Faith or an innocence or no experience
[7:37] with which to reject God's touch or
[7:40] rationalize with the scenario and ask
[7:43] why are we up here why are we wanting to
[7:44] be healed what's this feeling I feel
[7:46] that it having this childlike innocence
[7:48] God is able to even Beyond it being
[7:52] fully aware of what's Happening touch it
[7:54] he says and heal it so we have
[7:58] superstitions and calluses and
[7:59] wonderings that keep the presence of God
[8:02] from impacting us like it could if we
[8:05] had that kind of free Faith because this
[8:08] is what happened on the baby according
[8:10] to a vision it was healed without
[8:12] anything else intervening and I would
[8:14] say that's the place that we need to
[8:16] come to that the presence of God can
[8:18] work the Miracles in our lives and
[8:20] accomplish the things that we need to
[8:21] accomplish without having to worry so
[8:24] much about how much of the bodily
[8:26] efforts we can put into it he says you
[8:30] stand there just caught the vision of it
[8:33] God healed the baby no prayer nor
[8:35] nothing God did it and he says that's
[8:38] the way God likes to do it God would
[8:41] love to be able to have that Liberty for
[8:43] you to believe him so fully that when
[8:45] you know his near you just trust him to
[8:47] do whatever he wants to do he says this
[8:50] is on a higher level than laying on of
[8:52] hands now in this particular instance he
[8:55] is speaking of his prophetic gift the
[8:57] gift of discernment and the the
[8:59] particular sign that God had given him
[9:01] to catch the people's attention he says
[9:03] you say well brother brandham if they
[9:04] lay your hands on he goes I know brother
[9:07] Roberts believe he's speaking of brother
[9:08] o Roberts brother Allan AA Allen I'm
[9:11] sure many of the other brothers who are
[9:13] out praying for the sick they lay hands
[9:15] on them maybe anoint them with oil this
[9:17] would be scriptural according to James
[9:19] chapter 5 that's exactly the scripture
[9:22] that's perfectly right see they have
[9:24] gifts of healing and I think we need to
[9:26] understand what he means by that uh what
[9:28] a gift of healing is it's to get someone
[9:29] else to believe CU a a person isn't a
[9:32] Healer he said this is a prophetic gift
[9:34] showing the difference between uh what
[9:37] these men operate under commission and
[9:39] then the sign that was operating within
[9:40] his ministry this is a prophetic gift
[9:43] that's to touch each one in the lay on
[9:47] of hands he says that's the Jewish way
[9:49] of believing
[9:50] it how many have heard that statement
[9:53] before brother man refers to the Jewish
[9:55] way of believing it I want to go into
[9:56] greater detail in the future on the
[9:58] actual mechanics of laying on of hands
[10:01] and its basis in scripture but he's
[10:03] saying that there's a laying on of hands
[10:05] and there's a prophetic level there's a
[10:07] prophetic order and he says the laying
[10:09] on of hands that's within the Jewish
[10:11] custom and then just a little bit later
[10:13] he says oh I want you to believe without
[10:16] hands laying on just simply believe that
[10:19] the presence of the Lord is here to heal
[10:21] the
[10:22] sick now this in no way is dismissive of
[10:26] laying on of hands but he's
[10:28] acknowledging a general commission to
[10:30] preach the gospel lay hands on the sick
[10:31] and they shall recover but then
[10:34] something running on a higher level and
[10:36] a level upon which there would be this
[10:39] childlike innocence or dependence upon
[10:41] God to trust him that when his presence
[10:44] is near he can have full
[10:47] control he can do whatever he would want
[10:49] to do and so why would he want us to
[10:51] Simply believe the Lord Jesus believe
[10:54] he's present to heal the sick without
[10:56] even hands being laid on and I would
[10:58] maybe recall the emphasis last Sunday on
[11:02] the prophetic order the prophetic
[11:04] commission uh to a a major or the major
[11:07] and a minor and how in the general
[11:10] commission we're to do certain things
[11:12] but then there was that major move of
[11:13] God something major happening a
[11:15] dispensational change and on a prophetic
[11:18] level all of us have to if I say this
[11:20] all of us come under the commission
[11:21] whether you're a prophet or a piano
[11:23] player we we are commissioned to go into
[11:25] all the world and preach the gospel but
[11:27] then a prophet has a different commit
[11:30] and on that order he was tasked with
[11:32] bringing rapturing Faith restoring back
[11:35] the faith and bringing us to Faith in
[11:37] Jesus Christ and so this is what I want
[11:40] to look at now is that continue on that
[11:43] subject and I realize uh if if it sounds
[11:46] like I'm just repeating myself over and
[11:47] over again I think I know that I am but
[11:51] you feel free to show me just how bad it
[11:53] is and maybe we can talk about a
[11:56] remedy in mark 5: 22 to 23 I think those
[12:01] are kind of my some things I've put out
[12:03] there for us're they're in our in our
[12:05] minds now so now I'm just going to start
[12:06] down a path and and hopefully just be
[12:08] able to uh run through this and um the
[12:12] story is told
[12:13] elsewhere in in um believe in Matthew
[12:16] chapter 9 and here in Mark chapter 5 it
[12:18] says and behold there cometh one of the
[12:20] rulers of the synagogue Jus bind name
[12:23] there's different ways you hear people
[12:24] say that and when he saw him he fell at
[12:27] his feet and besought him greatly saying
[12:30] my little daughter lith at the point of
[12:32] death I pray thee come and lay thy hands
[12:36] on her that she may be healed and she
[12:38] shall live this is a ruler of the
[12:40] synagogue so this is someone who's
[12:41] familiar with the customs of the
[12:42] synagogue one of the rulers in the
[12:44] church um a man of reputation a man of
[12:47] skill or knowledge and he comes to
[12:50] Christ and he says come lay hands on my
[12:53] daughter that she will be healed now we
[12:55] could get into the specifics and even
[12:57] how the story is told and even in the
[12:59] telling I believe in Matthews it says
[13:00] she is dead and so what he wants Jesus
[13:04] to do is come physically to where she is
[13:07] lay hands on her and and heal her bring
[13:10] her back to life and you find in the
[13:12] reading of it Jesus does exactly that he
[13:14] makes physical contact with her and
[13:16] speaks the child to come forth now
[13:18] there's several instances in the
[13:19] ministry of Jesus Christ where he lays
[13:21] hands on the sick and they
[13:23] recover and the act of laying on of
[13:26] hands as brother bradam said it's a
[13:27] Jewish way of believing it
[13:29] um it is connected with um related to a
[13:33] Jewish tradition and this laying on of
[13:35] hands which is a sign that follows the
[13:37] commission right lay hands on the sick
[13:40] and they shall recover it's in this
[13:41] rabbinical custom it's something the
[13:43] Jews did it was something associated
[13:45] with their laws and the orders that they
[13:46] had under the Old Testament and I'd like
[13:49] to spend more time on this later but
[13:51] it's used in different ways to transfer
[13:53] a blessing or a gift to consecrate
[13:55] someone or even for someone to be
[13:57] identified the offered to be identified
[14:00] with the sacrifice and so there's
[14:02] physical contact made be identified with
[14:04] the sacrifice there's the time of
[14:06] consecration there had to be hands laid
[14:07] on and for the ordination uh hands being
[14:10] laid on or transfer of a gift or Divine
[14:12] uh a blessing you find even in the uh
[14:15] Joseph going to bless and the hands and
[14:17] being crossed in these different things
[14:19] there's hands to be laid on hands
[14:20] touched it's very Vivid in the scripture
[14:23] so gyrus is asking for Christ to come
[14:27] that his daughter may be healed so he
[14:30] believes in the power of God to heal his
[14:32] daughter believes in that he believes
[14:34] Christ has the power to heal his
[14:36] daughter but he believes and thinks that
[14:38] the laying on of hands is necessary or
[14:40] at least suggests so Master come my
[14:43] daughter's near death or my daughter is
[14:45] dead would you come and raise her from
[14:47] the dead H uh could have been what he he
[14:50] could have very easily said that but he
[14:52] specifically says come and lay your
[14:55] hands on my daughter she's at the point
[14:57] of death come lay hands on on her that
[14:59] she may be healed and live so he
[15:02] believed the actual physical laying on
[15:05] of hands was necessary for the daughter
[15:07] to be healed you catch that he believed
[15:11] in the power of God to heal his daughter
[15:13] but thought what needed to happen in the
[15:15] meantime is for the hands to be laid on
[15:17] in order for the power of God to be
[15:19] effective and I'm not meaning to put it
[15:21] in a way that sounds uh disrespectful
[15:24] but that is what he was
[15:25] wanting and in the same story we'll read
[15:28] it out of Matthew chap N9 he says well
[15:30] let's go let's go to Gus's house and in
[15:32] in Mark as you read the story there's a
[15:34] woman who had a blood issue and she was
[15:37] losing blood and she had a blood issue
[15:40] and she comes and it says behind the
[15:42] press and and so she kind of sneaks in
[15:44] and Away to just reach out and instead
[15:46] of asking like gyrus did a ruler of the
[15:48] synagogue come to my house lay hands on
[15:51] my daughter and she'll be well this
[15:53] woman now coming sees him believes in
[15:56] the power of God to heal and but sneaks
[15:58] in and press is in and with her
[16:00] particular need and her timidity her
[16:02] fear whatever it might be her
[16:03] consciousness of something she just
[16:05] wants to reach out and touch Christ to
[16:07] be healed and in Matthew Chap 9: 20-22
[16:11] and behold a woman which was diseased
[16:13] with an issue of blood 12 years came
[16:15] behind him and touched the Hemm of His
[16:17] Garment in both instances gyrus wants
[16:20] Jesus to lay hands on his daughter so
[16:22] there's a point of contact now this
[16:25] woman makes contact with Christ garment
[16:28] says that I may touch his touch the Hemm
[16:30] of His Garment for she said within
[16:32] herself if I may but touch His Garment I
[16:35] Shall Behold now this is
[16:37] Faith Jus had Faith this uh this woman
[16:41] has Faith he says but Jesus turned him
[16:43] about but Jesus turned him about and
[16:46] when he saw her he said daughter be of
[16:49] good Comfort now this is a word of
[16:52] endearment daughter acknowledging her
[16:55] faith being one of the Jews daughter be
[16:57] of good Comfort thy faith made thee
[16:59] whole and the woman was made whole from
[17:02] that hour you can read it in Mark 5:
[17:05] 24-34 and so Jesus now as he's been
[17:09] asked to go to gyrus his house to lay
[17:11] hands on the daughter to be healed a
[17:13] Woman intervenes by touching His Garment
[17:15] and virtue comes from him he perceives
[17:18] that he's been touched and in the press
[17:19] the disciples like what do you mean
[17:20] what's happened a a and he turns around
[17:23] and he recognizes this woman who had
[17:25] said within herself I think in Mark 5
[17:27] she's a little bit worried when he says
[17:29] who touched me oh no and I in trouble
[17:31] but then she she made herself known and
[17:33] she said I Lord I'm the one that did it
[17:35] and he says daughter be of good Comfort
[17:38] thy faith hath made thee
[17:41] whole so it's faith that made her whole
[17:44] and we find that Gus's daughter is
[17:46] healed as well it would been an act of
[17:48] faith for him to ask Christ and it's an
[17:50] act of faith that she was healed now
[17:53] this is a very large statement that
[17:54] deserves a lot
[17:56] more um
[17:59] uh maybe more time than I'd like to than
[18:00] I'm able to give it today but these are
[18:03] instances of Christ as he says daughter
[18:05] be of good Comfort gyus being a ruler of
[18:07] the synagogue these are instances of the
[18:11] Messiah demonstrating his ministry to
[18:13] Those whom he was sent he was sent into
[18:15] his own the House of David sent to the
[18:17] lost sheep of the House of Israel and
[18:19] this was fulfilling the promise of a
[18:21] messiah to them and their promise was a
[18:25] physical Messiah that's what they were
[18:27] promised they were promised to Messiah
[18:29] so it was Abraham's seed after the flesh
[18:31] would receive a messiah in the physical
[18:34] flesh the Messiah would be in flesh he'd
[18:36] be a man he'd be a prophet he'd be a
[18:37] king he'd be a leader he'd be a
[18:39] deliverer he'd be a savior he was to be
[18:41] a physical sacrifice in the form of
[18:43] human flesh that's how the Messiah was
[18:46] promised to be revealed to the Jews and
[18:49] this is what I want you to think of this
[18:50] is that broad thought to the Jews
[18:52] everything is physical amen they have a
[18:55] physical Promised Land ours is a
[18:56] spiritual promised land they had a
[18:58] physical Messiah ours is the revealed
[19:00] word our mate right there there's
[19:02] certain things you begin to recognize
[19:03] that there's this visible tangible
[19:06] physical uh the seed of the Sands of the
[19:08] Earth the children after the flesh
[19:10] that's that's the seed that was promised
[19:11] to them right and this is just big this
[19:14] is summary language Jesus characterized
[19:17] their faith as little
[19:19] faith when he often spoke to him he said
[19:21] little faith several I think is uh four
[19:23] or five times just in the Book of
[19:25] Matthew um even in instances he said
[19:27] that they had no faith
[19:29] or um referred to their unbelief your
[19:31] unbelief or their unbelief in Mark
[19:34] chapter 6 this is in the chapter
[19:36] preceding these events of Gus's daughter
[19:38] and this woman says and he could do
[19:40] there no Mighty work this is where the
[19:42] Prophet is without honor in his own
[19:44] country he says sa that he laid his
[19:47] hands on a upon a few sick folk and
[19:50] healed them could do no Mighty work what
[19:52] he did is he laid his hands on a few
[19:54] sick people and they were healed and
[19:56] notice though there's some those there's
[19:59] some healings taking place he marveled
[20:02] because of their
[20:03] unbelief and he went round about the
[20:05] villages teaching he marveled at their
[20:08] unbelief this is these are the people
[20:10] who who believed in the Messiah and he's
[20:12] healing people and he's performing these
[20:14] signs and wonders in front of him and he
[20:17] says well I'm shocked how little faith
[20:21] they have or here he says their
[20:24] unbelief and
[20:26] so this these instances in these
[20:29] miracles in the ministry of Jesus Christ
[20:31] this is the
[20:32] manifestation of the Messiah to uh to
[20:35] the Jewish church at the end of their
[20:37] Church ages this is their Messiah their
[20:40] Capstone or their that that that Messiah
[20:43] to come at the capping time if I could
[20:44] put it this way and as he demonstrated
[20:47] these signs and wonders in their midst
[20:49] so that he could bring forth the faith
[20:51] because he's the one that introduced the
[20:52] faith to the church Christ is the one
[20:55] who introduces the faith to the church
[20:57] that that holds a type for us there's
[21:00] something in that for us in the sermon
[21:03] Christ is identified the same in all
[21:04] generations I think this is one of those
[21:06] sermons I referred to um last
[21:10] Sunday in um where brother brandham is
[21:12] saying that he wanted to preach
[21:13] unveiling of God he says we uh we we
[21:17] want the we're after the strength of the
[21:18] body of
[21:19] Christ he says um if you're getting
[21:23] nervous that I have multiple sets of
[21:24] notes up here that's
[21:26] fine he says in this sermon it's your
[21:29] faith in God that does the
[21:30] healing You Must Believe God and if you
[21:34] want to if you jot these things down you
[21:36] go back and read them you listen to the
[21:37] tape you'll find that after a while you
[21:39] find that I end up I'll end up quoting
[21:41] an entire two or three pages in a row
[21:44] just by visiting the different principle
[21:46] coming back to it and building the whole
[21:47] thought because it can be one paragraph
[21:49] that inspires me and so you can amplify
[21:52] one sentence with several other
[21:53] statements in scriptures and so there's
[21:55] statements before this and after this um
[21:57] that we're using says it's your faith in
[21:59] God that does the healing You Must
[22:01] Believe God and if you can touch him
[22:03] then nobody laid hands on
[22:05] you if you could touch him so I would
[22:07] say well then if he could be here I
[22:09] could touch him right if I could have
[22:11] Christ just as he was for this woman in
[22:12] Mark chapter 5 Matthew chapter 9 if he
[22:14] could be here then I'll Touch the Hem of
[22:16] His Garment and I'll believe that I can
[22:17] be healed but I don't have his physical
[22:20] garment here I don't even have that
[22:22] Corporal body here that physical flesh
[22:24] says if you can touch him then nobody
[22:25] laid hands on you it was your faith that
[22:27] touched him and your your faith brought
[22:29] the reality just prior to this and I
[22:31] want to use it in a future sermon
[22:32] brother BR was talking about how the
[22:34] reason why he wants this is it's easy
[22:36] for you to say oh brother so and so laid
[22:38] his hands on me and then like well I
[22:41] want brother so and so to lay hands on
[22:42] me right and uh I got to think of
[22:45] somebody who's a real good friend of
[22:46] mine so I don't get in trouble but if
[22:48] you all wanted brother Wayne Lawson to
[22:50] lay hands on you that would be awesome
[22:52] brother Wayne awesome right and and I
[22:55] have the confidence that you would be
[22:57] healed but there's a little bit of a
[22:59] detriment in that right I think the
[23:01] guy's booked up until the next decade
[23:03] okay and so if that's what you're
[23:05] waiting for here we might be waiting a
[23:07] while but brother brand identifies that
[23:09] as being problematic and brother Wayne
[23:11] is a very dear friend of mine so I feel
[23:12] like if he even knew I had a website
[23:14] with archives and he streamed this he'd
[23:16] be okay with it but that's the danger of
[23:19] being oh if I could just have brother
[23:20] brandom if I could just have brother or
[23:22] Roberts if I could just have brother
[23:24] Wayne awesome there then I know I would
[23:27] get healed and he and he's guarding
[23:29] against that so he's saying if your
[23:30] faith could touch him then nobody laid
[23:33] hands on you amen says it was your faith
[23:35] that touched him and your faith your
[23:37] faith brought the reality how
[23:38] encouraging is that you walk away
[23:40] realizing it was my faith that touched
[23:42] him it was my faith that brought the
[23:43] reality so then it wasn't no one touched
[23:46] you but you your faith touched him and
[23:48] so that brings real genuine testimony to
[23:52] him
[23:52] then right real genuine testimony to him
[23:55] then that's what we're here for to
[23:58] Magnify Him this is the real heart of
[24:00] the Prophet right here in the middle of
[24:01] April in Tampa
[24:03] 1964 uh brother Andrew your grandparents
[24:05] were there at those meetings sister
[24:07] marvar brother Ernest fure were there in
[24:09] those meetings brother Ernest I think
[24:10] was in the foury year going he hadn't
[24:13] went quite a Believer yet but he got
[24:15] there uh but it's um in this service
[24:20] he's saying what I want to do is Magnify
[24:22] Him I don't want to magnify myself he's
[24:25] using the language of John the Baptist I
[24:27] must decrease he must increase he must
[24:29] be elevated I I I don't want to have the
[24:33] preeminence and so brother bandam takes
[24:35] this this uh touching the Garment or
[24:39] this your faith reaching out and
[24:40] touching him as what we can do today but
[24:44] we know we can't be touching a physical
[24:46] Jesus but if he can declare his presence
[24:49] that he's here and we can by faith
[24:51] believe that he's here and then our
[24:53] faith Reach Out And Touch him then we
[24:55] have done something greater than what
[24:58] the woman in Matthew 99 did and so this
[25:01] greater Faith or this higher level of
[25:03] Faith this elevated Faith speaks to the
[25:05] bride's Faith at the end time amen which
[25:08] is what it means to have an elevated
[25:09] Faith right now in Matthew chapter 8
[25:13] there's two instances in Matthew chapter
[25:16] 9 Mark chapter 5 where a Jew is looking
[25:22] to the physical presence of Christ and
[25:25] touch to be healed
[25:28] and what's remarkable is just prior to
[25:31] that these instances take place with
[25:32] both a man and a woman who are not Jews
[25:35] and in Matthew chapter 8 veres 5 to13
[25:37] and when Jesus was entered into capernum
[25:39] there came unto him a centurion
[25:40] beseeching him so this would be a
[25:43] gentile this is not a Jew this is
[25:45] someone who's not a Believer saying Lord
[25:47] my servant lieth at home sick of py
[25:49] grievously tormented and the and the
[25:51] other readings of this uh it would be
[25:54] that he sent he sent one to get Jesus
[25:56] and then he must have come on his own
[25:58] the way they rationalize with it is when
[26:00] Jesus said I'll come he must have
[26:01] realized oh he's coming let me go out
[26:02] and meet him and he says and Jesus saith
[26:05] unto him I will come and heal him so the
[26:10] he's coming Jesus ISS this is what he's
[26:11] used to right oh you need healing well
[26:13] I'll come I'll lay hands on them says
[26:16] the Centurion answered said Lord I'm not
[26:17] worthy thou should us come under my roof
[26:20] but speak the word
[26:22] only speak the word only and my servant
[26:25] shall be healed for I am a man under
[26:27] Authority having soldiers under me and I
[26:29] say to this man go and he goeth and to
[26:31] another come and he cometh and to my
[26:33] servant do this and he doeth it in other
[26:34] words I recognize Authority when I see
[26:36] it I recognize a master in his domain
[26:39] when I see it I'm a centurion I'm I'm a
[26:41] leader I'm a ruler and I'm the one I'm
[26:43] the head within that Reign within that
[26:46] hierarchy and whatever I say goes and I
[26:48] recognize that you have that kind of
[26:51] power in a spiritual realm that all
[26:53] demons and everything is subject to you
[26:55] so he's saying look I know power when I
[26:58] see it so he believed in the power of
[27:01] God just like gyrus but now he believes
[27:04] it if I could say a little bit greater
[27:06] because he's like and I don't think
[27:08] hands are necessary because when I say
[27:10] something to my servants I don't need to
[27:12] lay hands on them there it is to get him
[27:14] to do it right so gives a difference to
[27:17] laying on of hands right God doesn't
[27:19] want to beat us into our healing he
[27:21] wants us to believe into our healing so
[27:24] he says I recognize that and then notice
[27:26] his response and I think if you look at
[27:29] this and what happens with gyrus and and
[27:31] the other tellings around this he says
[27:34] when Jesus heard it he
[27:38] marveled he's like whoa all right look
[27:41] at this guy he's marveling whoa and he
[27:44] said to them that followed he wanted
[27:46] everyone to catch this verily I say unto
[27:48] you I have not found so great faith no
[27:53] not in
[27:55] Israel the Israelites are the ones of
[27:57] the faith
[27:59] they were the faithful they were the
[28:00] Believers they believed in the one true
[28:02] God and here they all are they're part
[28:04] of the club right and this interloper
[28:06] who just happens to have a servant who
[28:08] was a a Jew is like can you come and
[28:10] heal my servant and very dear servant to
[28:13] him he goes yeah I'll come I'll pray for
[28:15] him and he says no no no no no you just
[28:17] need to speak the word I get it I I I've
[28:20] heard I know what's going on here just
[28:21] speak the word and Jesus turns to all
[28:24] the guys in the club right in the faith
[28:27] club and says I haven't seen so great a
[28:30] faith in all of Israel and like guy's a
[28:35] gentile and he calls it so great
[28:39] faith and I say unto you and this is he
[28:42] prophesies the coming in of the Gentile
[28:45] bride that many shall come from the East
[28:48] and West and shall sit down with Abraham
[28:50] and Isaac and Jacob whoa the
[28:54] Patriarchs I am the god of Abraham Isaac
[28:56] and Jacob he invoked the the the their
[28:59] Holy Trinity he invoked something that
[29:01] was so significant to them that many
[29:03] will come reprobates uh Gentiles
[29:07] heathens as they may call them and sit
[29:10] down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the
[29:12] Kingdom of Heaven but the children of
[29:15] the Kingdom the Israelites the Jews
[29:19] those who of the natural Seed of Abraham
[29:21] shall be cast out into outer darkness
[29:22] and there shall be weeping and nashing
[29:24] of teeth he prophesies of the coming in
[29:26] of a gentile bride and Jesus said un the
[29:29] Centurion go thy way and as thou Hast
[29:32] believed so be it done unto thee it
[29:35] ended it it ended his
[29:36] journey it didn't matter to Jesus I you
[29:39] know I actually booked an Airbnb just
[29:40] right next to you that's a shame it's
[29:41] too late to cancel he's like that's fine
[29:43] it's over it's done as thou Hast
[29:46] believed what did he believe that at the
[29:49] word he would be healed so be it done
[29:51] unto thee and his servant was healed in
[29:53] the selfsame
[29:55] hour because he spoke the word only holy
[29:59] and brother bradam I appreciate that
[30:00] brother that's exactly the truth and and
[30:03] the sermon Christ is identified the same
[30:05] in all generations we quoted from this
[30:06] just a moment ago and and let me catch a
[30:09] few statements at the beginning he says
[30:10] at the very beginning so this week the
[30:12] rest of the week let's put our faith up
[30:14] there like really Abraham's seed like
[30:16] we're supposed to be let's put our faith
[30:19] up there let's Elevate our faith to what
[30:21] Abraham seed ought to be let's believe
[30:23] God then we'll pray for the sick and
[30:25] doing everything we can to help alone
[30:27] amen let's put our faith up there like
[30:29] Abraham seed and we'll pray for the sick
[30:31] to help along he says this now my
[30:33] purpose in praying for the sick I'm
[30:35] going to talk about that now prayer for
[30:37] the sick purpose in praying for the sick
[30:40] I feel like you're all just right there
[30:41] with me so I'm loving how this is going
[30:43] today we don't try to say that's what
[30:45] we're here for one thing we're
[30:48] for what's that this one thing I seek
[30:52] after but praying for the sick is a
[30:54] minor you can never major with a minor
[30:56] so we enhan that quite a bit over the
[30:58] last two Services now in the next few
[31:00] paragraphs couple paragraphs he begins
[31:02] to describe or maybe it's just one
[31:03] paragraph how that a voice always
[31:06] follows the sign there's a sign given
[31:07] there's a voice that follows so he's
[31:09] really emphasizing I'm not just here for
[31:11] the healing I'm not here for the signs
[31:12] I'm not here for these things there's a
[31:14] message that I have there's one thing
[31:15] I'm here for the message and so I'm
[31:19] picking up now he says now what we try
[31:20] to do because this is the the purpose in
[31:22] praying for the sick what we try to do
[31:25] is to get the people to believe the Lord
[31:27] Jesus just to accept him without being
[31:29] hands laid
[31:33] on consider now consider this
[31:37] why why does he ask us why does he want
[31:40] this if laying on of hands would
[31:42] accomplish it why not do it why is he
[31:46] trying to
[31:49] elevate says now we know there's a
[31:51] scripture that says lay hands on the
[31:52] sick and they shall recover and we don't
[31:54] try to belittle that scripture and
[31:56] neither should any of us right yeah
[32:00] because that was the commission Jesus
[32:01] Christ gave to the church to lay hands
[32:03] on the sick but if you'll bear with me
[32:05] that was more like a Jewish tradition
[32:08] and it's true and I don't think that
[32:09] belittles it at all or devalues it at
[32:11] all but it is was a Jewish tradition and
[32:13] that was adopted into Christianity
[32:15] remember the girl that was laying sick
[32:17] she died Gus's daughter he said come lay
[32:20] your hands upon my child and she will
[32:22] get well but the Roman Centurion a
[32:25] gentile just in the chapter prior said
[32:28] I'm not worthy that you come under my
[32:30] roof just speak the word and my servant
[32:33] will live and Jesus turned around and
[32:36] said I've never seen Faith like that in
[32:39] Israel the Gentile way is to believe him
[32:43] just absolutely believe him write that
[32:47] phrase down this is the bride's
[32:51] way and he says the Gentile way he's
[32:54] he's speaking of it in just the same way
[32:56] that you would have the elect out of of
[32:58] Israel the Gentile bride way the way
[33:01] that God wants his church to come to
[33:03] having been built on the proper
[33:05] Foundation he wants her to come to the
[33:06] peak and climax of Mount Zion to a place
[33:09] where she just believes him absolutely
[33:11] believes him says now we lay hands on
[33:14] the sick of course we do but we try to
[33:17] bring the
[33:18] reality that's the truth the
[33:21] althos the the by the scriptures of
[33:24] Jesus Christ being
[33:26] present that's by I want to bring the
[33:28] reality of him being present then when
[33:29] you by faith reach up and touch him
[33:32] yourself like the woman with the blood
[33:33] issue touched His Garment right that
[33:37] that's a as a Jew in that day you could
[33:39] have Christ come to your home and lay
[33:42] hands on your sick daughter your dead
[33:43] daughter and she could raise up or you
[33:45] could Reach Out And Touch the Hem of His
[33:46] Garment but the bride today can have
[33:50] access to a present Jesus Christ in by
[33:53] faith when she believes that he's here
[33:56] her faith can reach out and touch
[33:59] him just absolutely believe him this is
[34:02] what brother bam wants what I'm trying
[34:03] to do is to get the people to believe
[34:06] him and I'll skip absolutely believe him
[34:09] it's an absolute
[34:12] faith and Matthew Chapter
[34:15] 5 I believe we actually read this
[34:17] Wednesday night Behold a woman of Canaan
[34:19] in Mark chapter 7 it says this woman was
[34:21] a Greek a sarap phenician by Nation so
[34:22] in Mark chapter 7 she is identified as
[34:25] being a gentile a Greek s phenician a
[34:29] woman of Canaan came out of the same
[34:30] coast and Cried unto him saying have
[34:32] mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my
[34:36] daughter's grievously vexed with the
[34:37] devil but he answered her not a
[34:41] word uh I mean this this goes down as
[34:45] racism or something
[34:47] right I mean on one hand look at look at
[34:49] the privilege gyrus gyrus has right a
[34:52] and the way that he treats this one
[34:54] comes hey my daughter's dying he's like
[34:56] hey sure butt I'll come over
[34:58] I'll lay my hands on him on her I I I'll
[35:00] pray for her and here comes another
[35:02] woman coming right begging or not
[35:06] begging but just say my daughter's vexed
[35:07] he won't he ignores her and his
[35:09] disciples came and beside him said send
[35:11] her away she crith after us and now
[35:14] they're trying to run interference and
[35:15] she's bugging them but he answered and
[35:17] said I am not sent but under the lost
[35:20] sheep of the House of
[35:23] Israel that's his
[35:26] answer then came and worshiped him
[35:29] saying Lord help me and let's watch the
[35:33] nature of Christ
[35:35] right but he answered and said it is not
[35:37] meat to take the children's bread and
[35:39] cast it to
[35:40] dogs where when the woman that touched
[35:42] his h of His Garment
[35:43] daughter daughter I faith has saved thee
[35:48] another woman coming she's not pushing
[35:49] on him she's worshiping she's crying
[35:53] Lord help
[35:55] me and he says and he says I'm not sent
[35:58] unto the I am not but sent to the lost
[36:00] sheep of the House of Israel what's so
[36:02] amazing in the way that Christ acts he's
[36:05] hiding the mystery that this is actually
[36:07] the woman he sent
[36:09] to because what was the purpose he made
[36:12] the Earth to get a bride out of it
[36:14] what's the mystery of God what's the
[36:15] mystery of the Old Testament a gentile
[36:17] bride oh it's Israel it's Israel the
[36:18] mystery was a bride of his own choosing
[36:21] and here this woman is the type of it
[36:24] amen and he's hiding that mystery oh I'm
[36:26] not sent but to the law she of the House
[36:28] of Israel he's hiding the mystery that
[36:30] he comes back later and says oh there's
[36:31] going to be a time when people are going
[36:33] to come from east and west and and sit
[36:36] down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the
[36:39] Kingdom of Heaven one of them thinking
[36:40] kind of like that woman that you told to
[36:42] go away the other day yeah just like
[36:45] her and he says it's not meat to give it
[36:48] to cast it to dogs now let me just say
[36:50] this Jesus isn't operating by Prejudice
[36:53] he's not operating uh um under any
[36:56] perverted anointing he is demonstrating
[36:59] something he's doing what the father
[37:01] tells him his heart might have been
[37:03] moved to her and in his and his
[37:07] understanding of the mystery of God
[37:08] wanted to say behold one who types the
[37:11] Bride of the last days and he holds
[37:14] himself back and he's restraining
[37:16] himself to just heal her on the moment
[37:18] heal her on the spot she has a daughter
[37:20] that's vexed oh God heal her daughter he
[37:23] withholds himself withholds himself and
[37:25] she says it's not me he says it's not
[37:27] meat to cast it to dogs and she say
[37:29] truth Lord she knows truth when she
[37:31] hears it yet the dogs eat the crumbs
[37:34] which fall from their master's table and
[37:37] then Jesus answered and said in that
[37:39] moment he had
[37:40] release he had release for the love that
[37:43] he had for this woman oh woman great is
[37:46] thy faith he allowed this thing to
[37:49] unfold in a way where she could truly
[37:51] demonstrate the perseverant faith of the
[37:54] Bride of the last days where it seems as
[37:57] if he would holds it seems as if he's
[37:59] distant but she maintains her faith she
[38:02] absolutely believes
[38:04] him she didn't say oh well I heard
[38:07] wonderful things about you you're
[38:08] nothing but a
[38:09] misogynist you're nothing but a racist
[38:12] you're nothing but a a a narcissistic
[38:17] egomaniac she knew she believed she
[38:21] persevered says oh woman great is thy
[38:25] faith be it under thee even as thou
[38:27] Willl
[38:28] now to the woman who had the blood issue
[38:30] he said thy faith has made thee
[38:32] whole but now to this woman great
[38:35] greater is thy faith and her daughter
[38:39] was made whole from that very
[38:41] hour so we see it demonstrated in these
[38:45] two scriptures that Gentile Centurion at
[38:49] Thy word who believed he said I haven't
[38:51] seen so greater faith not not in all of
[38:52] Israel and his servant is healed the
[38:54] selfsame hour now on a gentile woman
[38:58] it acts to where all she does is she
[39:00] stands in his
[39:02] presence right he says woman great is
[39:06] thy faith be it unto thee even as thou
[39:08] Wilt that's the third pull right be it
[39:11] unto thee even as thy Willl operating
[39:13] now on a woman who says that she knew
[39:15] what she wanted she wanted the
[39:17] Deliverance of her daughter the healing
[39:18] of her
[39:19] daughter I if you
[39:22] could um just uh pull on me please pull
[39:26] on me I want to get through this
[39:27] and the me the sign super the message
[39:29] super sign we don't need the prayer
[39:32] cards anyhow I've tried to get you away
[39:34] from that tradition always of laying
[39:36] hands on like the Jews did gyrus said
[39:38] come lay your hands on my daughter and
[39:40] she'll live the Romans said just speak
[39:42] the word that was the Gentile way of
[39:44] believing
[39:45] it not we're not belittling one we're
[39:49] not saying one isn't doesn't work but
[39:51] brother brandham as a prophet is wanting
[39:53] to push our focus on something not
[39:56] abandon
[39:57] Anything But realize that as the Old
[40:00] Testament blended into the new and as
[40:02] whatever Lane of hands accomplished let
[40:05] it do its work let it do its thing Let
[40:07] IT hand it
[40:08] off to take it to the Finish Line in the
[40:11] sermon the Good Shepherd of the sheep
[40:12] the American people are taught you got
[40:14] to lay hands on them was it Wednesday
[40:17] sometime recently maybe it was just in
[40:18] my reading and studying we B some of the
[40:20] Pentecostal people they desire it they
[40:21] desire the signs they desire the hands
[40:23] being they don't oh they love it they
[40:24] love the emotion they love this and so
[40:26] there's several instances where brother
[40:27] B talks about the American people need
[40:29] to be entertained they need a sign they
[40:30] need a miracle the American people are
[40:32] taught you got to lay hands on them and
[40:33] I guess you'll just have to do that
[40:36] that's all I know I'm trying to get you
[40:38] to believe it on a higher
[40:40] order to accept it without hands laid on
[40:42] you you just believe it walk away
[40:45] remember that phrase higher order is to
[40:48] accept it and believe it walk
[40:51] away to take God at his word and the
[40:54] sermon God's word calls for a total
[40:56] separation from unbelief if you could
[40:57] just take those two quotes in your mind
[40:59] kind of let them meld a little bit
[41:00] believe it on a higher order
[41:03] yes and this is uh I I cut a lot out
[41:06] here because I I wanted to be get to the
[41:08] point and not lose time and I'm running
[41:09] out of time says now to you stand in
[41:11] this prayer line to come down that line
[41:14] of discernment and he's wanting to
[41:16] understand hey this drains somebody this
[41:18] uh when I'm having to uh when this gift
[41:21] is being used that way Jesus saw one
[41:24] Vision he said I perceived that virtue
[41:26] is gone from me that strength is that
[41:28] right Visions you're in another world
[41:30] now he is
[41:33] here says do you stand in the prayer
[41:35] line do you that are standing pray to
[41:37] come through this line of discernment
[41:38] Christ is here right
[41:40] now hope you can pick Focus now with me
[41:42] Focus I know maybe it's hot it's Labor
[41:44] Day weekend we got a lot of things we
[41:45] want to labor in um but let's just focus
[41:48] here he says he's here that's him that
[41:51] touched you now it just only identifies
[41:55] that he's here with us the sign that's
[41:58] been demonstrated these things that are
[41:59] happening he's here with us now how many
[42:01] will believe if you'll just walk through
[42:03] this line let me pray and lay hands on
[42:05] you and you go back to your
[42:07] seat say now here's the sign being given
[42:11] now and brother man I'm lamented of this
[42:13] and as I was with Moses in those places
[42:15] that I'm I'm having to demonstrate this
[42:16] sign I want to get to the place where I
[42:17] just do the commission lay hands on them
[42:19] pray let them believe and walk away and
[42:21] not always work in this other realm so
[42:23] he said well how many will just believe
[42:25] if I lay hands on you he's them right I
[42:29] believe I believe like well then I'm
[42:30] just going to lay hands on you like
[42:31] anybody else can they're like h no tell
[42:34] me where I live
[42:37] right says do you believe if I pray for
[42:39] you here and then lay hands on you each
[42:41] of you will get well do you believe that
[42:43] was the Holy Spirit
[42:45] here it could just keep on doing it the
[42:49] the this line of discernment if you want
[42:51] to Forfeit that line and just keep on
[42:53] for some more why we'll do that see
[42:57] that's what if you want me to just keep
[42:59] doing the the sign we can keep doing
[43:01] that or and and bypass the line but he
[43:06] says see that's what the holy spirit is
[43:08] here it's just up to your thinking if it
[43:11] would make you believe more that's what
[43:14] brother brenham's after he wasn't trying
[43:16] to create a modality wherein we always
[43:19] have to do prayer lines and we always
[43:21] have to do certain signs always he just
[43:23] wants you to believe more at the end of
[43:26] the day we said last Sund whatever it
[43:28] takes Lord whatever it takes for us to
[43:30] believe that's my desire for our church
[43:32] for Arizona Believers Church is whatever
[43:34] it takes for the people to believe if it
[43:36] have to be gifts Lord if that's where
[43:38] we're at let it be but God let our faith
[43:41] rise let it grow let us believe more he
[43:46] says but many people have been
[43:48] taught lay hands on them the Bible said
[43:50] he sent his word and healed them so two
[43:53] different scriptures well that's what he
[43:55] did just now confirmed Med his word sent
[43:58] it to you confirmed it and it healed
[43:59] them talking about the very dynamics of
[44:01] that service the Jew said come lay hands
[44:04] on my daughter and she'll live the
[44:06] Romans said I'm not worthy you come
[44:07] under my roof just say the word that's
[44:09] what I'm trying to get you to believe
[44:11] you see there it is that's what I'm
[44:14] trying to get you to believe see what
[44:16] I'm trying to get you to believe is he's
[44:19] here his word is true if he's confirmed
[44:22] it with signs and wonders then we don't
[44:23] have to keep going back to him saying
[44:25] we'll do another one
[44:27] I I I had a
[44:29] whole I just basically if we want to
[44:32] have an evening service we could do it
[44:33] because I just had all a whole another
[44:34] sermon ready to preach on that
[44:35] particular aspect on the sign seeking
[44:39] and I it's like it almost what I what I
[44:42] want to look into is the feedback
[44:44] loop once that starts it's really hard
[44:47] to get out of
[44:49] it and and before you know it just
[44:51] become such a loud Echo chamber pretty
[44:52] soon nothing makes sense
[44:55] anymore says I'm trying to to get you to
[44:57] believe it trying to get you to believe
[45:00] I I'll if that's what you want it's up
[45:01] to your thinking if it would make you
[45:02] believe more I'll do what you need to
[45:04] believe more but hopefully there comes a
[45:06] point to where when you more believe
[45:08] right we move out of that cycle and our
[45:11] faith is
[45:12] elevated says I'm trying to get you to
[45:15] believe you see but if you want to be
[45:18] prayed for and hands laid upon you now I
[45:21] want every one of you to join with me in
[45:22] prayer as we pray for the people what
[45:25] Grace amen what beauty that's that's how
[45:29] God is for us you know we ought to have
[45:31] perfect Faith right but where does God
[45:33] meet us time and time again every day of
[45:35] our lives right there in our weakness of
[45:37] it he's not sitting there hands on hips
[45:39] going these message
[45:41] Believers right he meets us wherever we
[45:44] are he says by by now you ought to be
[45:46] teachers by now you ought to be you
[45:48] ought to be to the place to where you're
[45:49] you're overcoming this and you're
[45:50] overcome my this many years believing
[45:52] and you still struggle with that and
[45:53] he's like that's okay that's okay honey
[45:56] if that's what you need come on I'll
[45:58] meet you right where you are amen but
[46:00] he's trying to tell us the whole time
[46:01] remember this remember the process
[46:04] remember what I'm doing I'm always here
[46:06] with you so if you need me later you
[46:07] don't have to come back to this meeting
[46:09] you don't have to come back to this line
[46:11] you don't come back to these hands just
[46:13] remember who I am and when he finds you
[46:15] right in that same come on we can
[46:16] testify to this finds ourselves right
[46:18] back in that same place he's like is
[46:20] that what you need if you need hands
[46:21] laid on come on join with me in prayer
[46:23] but what he wants us to do is to believe
[46:26] him absolutely believe him he wants to
[46:28] make us believe
[46:30] more what's my purpose in praying for
[46:32] the sick right that's what we said
[46:34] earlier he says this Faith to get the
[46:37] people to believe just accept them to
[46:40] just absolutely believe him and he's
[46:41] using the example of this Centurian who
[46:43] takes him at his word versus gyrus who
[46:46] believed in the power of God but felt
[46:47] that it was absolutely necessary that
[46:49] hands be laid on same power to
[46:53] heal same Faith just an elevator Faith
[46:58] to take him at his word so he if you
[47:00] want hands laid on you then join me with
[47:02] prayers as we pray for the people now I
[47:05] could stop
[47:09] here and it would probably be a good
[47:11] stopping point that I may have to just
[47:14] cut some stuff out but Hebrews chapter 6
[47:17] because this is going to be now the
[47:18] laying on of hands part and I want you
[47:20] to I want you to I want to share this I
[47:22] say want you to understand no that's not
[47:24] it I just want to encourage your faith
[47:26] in what you
[47:27] know how this Divine Healing relates to
[47:30] rapturing Faith he says therefore
[47:31] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[47:32] of Christ let us go on unto Perfection
[47:35] not laying again the foundation of
[47:36] repentance from dead
[47:39] works these are foundational things you
[47:41] can't get rid of the foundational things
[47:43] and of Faith toward God you can't get
[47:44] rid of
[47:45] that of the doctrine of baptisms and of
[47:49] laying on of hands and of the
[47:51] resurrection of the dead and of Eternal
[47:52] judgment so these are fundamental
[47:54] principles of our faith he says and this
[47:57] we will do if God will allow if God will
[47:59] permit oh let's move Beyond this laying
[48:02] in the
[48:03] foundation oh and we'll do it if God
[48:05] will permit and when we looked at this
[48:07] last week we saw how Paul was talking
[48:08] about a maturing Faith an elevated Faith
[48:10] a perfect faith we talked about brother
[48:12] said brother talked about we're coming
[48:14] now to the Perfection because the people
[48:15] have to come to this in order for the
[48:17] Rapture that's what's holding it away
[48:18] now is for the church to come into that
[48:20] perfect raptured
[48:22] Faith that's what Paul is talking about
[48:25] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[48:27] of Christ and not laying in the
[48:29] foundation of those things let us go on
[48:31] into tell otaste the perfector Christ
[48:35] has introduced this foundational Faith
[48:37] now with this here behold Mount Zion
[48:40] let's go to the climax of Mount Zion
[48:42] let's let's Ascend to the Pinnacle let's
[48:45] apprehend as we are apprehended let me
[48:48] strive let me uh let me press towards
[48:51] the mark for the prize let let me do all
[48:53] these things looking into that perfect
[48:56] when that which is perfect has come
[48:57] these are the things that Paul is
[49:00] lifting up in this very moment uh these
[49:02] are the things that are standing before
[49:04] him when he says that's not nay these
[49:06] principles are down anymore and
[49:10] so let's let's go on to Perfection now a
[49:13] lot of this is tying back to where we
[49:14] were last week in the sermon the sign of
[49:16] this time I want to read a
[49:19] statement uh where brother talking about
[49:21] what what where we are today is into
[49:23] this Perfection and and just prior to
[49:26] this statement we're going to read he
[49:27] says the church has come through the
[49:28] score of the church ages after the first
[49:30] Ephesian Church age and if the Lord
[49:32] willing before I leave here I want to
[49:34] preach on a little subject called the
[49:36] countdown and see how we've come how
[49:40] we've
[49:42] progressed okay in the message the
[49:44] countdown hopefully we'll come to it and
[49:46] he says in a moment later before I come
[49:47] to the statement he says now we've left
[49:49] the Pentecostal age now we're coming to
[49:52] we like the pyramid we're coming not
[49:54] pyramid doctor says but it's the
[49:55] Capstone right so he talking about the
[49:57] three elements he says if Christ died
[49:58] there was three elements that came from
[49:59] his body water blood spirit these are
[50:01] the same elements of the birth right
[50:03] justification through believing water
[50:04] sanctification through the blood the
[50:06] baptism Holy Spirit there's your three
[50:08] steps now this last great step must come
[50:11] into the
[50:14] Perfection so there's your your Wesley
[50:17] or Luther Wesley Pentecost the full New
[50:20] Birth now born maturing to Perfection
[50:23] and he says this last great step this is
[50:26] where we are today this last great step
[50:27] must come to Perfection this is how it's
[50:29] described that the Holy Spirit has to
[50:31] live in that church so perfectly it
[50:34] makes the head in the body unite
[50:36] together that's where we are now the
[50:38] last great step is the holy spirit
[50:40] living perfectly within your life the
[50:43] message who is this mzc first
[50:44] justification like Luther preached
[50:46] second sanctification like Wesley
[50:47] preached third baptism of the Holy Ghost
[50:49] that's the Pentecostal age that's me
[50:51] injecting that about the Pentecostal AG
[50:53] third baptism the Holy Ghost that's
[50:54] right then comes the rapture
[50:57] this last great step then comes the
[50:58] Rapture that's what we're what the what
[51:00] the season we're in the seventh seal the
[51:02] kingdom of God is coming talking about
[51:03] the strange part of this week and people
[51:05] being healed the kingdom of God is
[51:07] coming and it's becoming more from the
[51:09] negative to the positive as it has
[51:11] been the king go is becoming more
[51:13] positive than it's ever been now that
[51:15] ought to choke people from justification
[51:18] to sanctification to the baptism of the
[51:19] Holy Ghost and then
[51:21] here justification sanctification Bap
[51:23] the Holy Ghost now some people want to
[51:25] make that the dispensational end right
[51:28] he says and then here amen right oh
[51:31] that's so good then here he says we're
[51:33] just drawn closer to God all the
[51:35] time listen to this question can't you
[51:38] see Methodist ministers how your message
[51:40] of sanctification was above that which
[51:42] Luther preached remember he said he
[51:44] wants to preach
[51:45] countdown before he leaves he says can't
[51:49] above what Luther preach you
[51:51] Pentecostals can't you see your message
[51:53] of baptism is beyond what the Methodist
[51:56] preached
[51:57] so then what about his message wouldn't
[51:59] it Beyond be beyond the Pentecostal
[52:02] message B bramman the Masterpiece
[52:04] mentions how the baptism Holy Ghost made
[52:06] way for the Holy Ghost itself to come
[52:08] right down into Perfection back to the
[52:11] word again to manifest itself it's made
[52:13] way for I think I don't know if I have
[52:15] the statement here says now the entire
[52:16] Holy Ghost visits the
[52:18] church now that could be confusing for
[52:20] some people but it has to do with
[52:22] purpose
[52:24] dispensation on and these first
[52:26] principles that Paul talks about he says
[52:29] we have these principles of the doctrine
[52:31] of Christ and the foundations and he
[52:33] says let us go on these things I you can
[52:36] say these things
[52:37] are perfect in themselves right as far
[52:41] as what they are but they're part of
[52:43] something else let us go on onto
[52:46] Perfection I kind of want to do it this
[52:48] way in a linear way but it's the it let
[52:49] us go on into Perfection staying within
[52:52] that
[52:53] foundation and so these first principles
[52:55] these things that Paul talks about are
[52:57] the building blocks from which elevated
[52:59] Faith
[52:59] arises it's how you get perfect Faith
[53:02] you're never going to get perfect Faith
[53:03] by building on another
[53:04] Foundation Paul talking about this body
[53:06] in Ephesians 2:20 says we are built on
[53:08] the doctrine of the Apostles the
[53:09] foundation rather the foundation of the
[53:11] doctor of the Apostles and
[53:14] Prophets it's part of the faith it's
[53:16] part of the building these
[53:18] things but as we mentioned last time in
[53:20] Hebrews 69 I'm persuaded better things
[53:22] of
[53:23] you better things it's greater things
[53:26] perfect things right better things so he
[53:30] comes later in Hebrews chap 11 he says
[53:31] and these all having obtained a good
[53:33] report through faith by Faith by Faith
[53:35] by Faith by faith but he says they tamed
[53:37] a good report through faith received not
[53:39] the promise right they had Faith but
[53:42] didn't receive the promise God having
[53:45] provided some better thing for us amen
[53:48] Paul said I'm persuaded better things of
[53:50] you now he's saying for these Jews God
[53:52] having provided some better things with
[53:54] for us that they without us should
[53:56] should not be made perfect now it has a
[53:59] beautiful imagery to the G the Jewish
[54:01] Church beautiful imagery to the Jews and
[54:04] at the the the very beginning of the
[54:06] Christian church and this this what he
[54:08] says here that they God has provided a
[54:12] better some better thing for us that
[54:14] they without us should not be made
[54:15] perfect it holds a prophetic type for
[54:17] the Gentile bride holds a dispensational
[54:20] truth to us and to the church
[54:23] ages I know I'm going quick here and I
[54:26] kind of like how this is working out I'm
[54:28] not going to be long today says in the
[54:30] Statue of a perfect man he says those
[54:31] who died in here are depending and
[54:33] waiting on us this is him coming now at
[54:37] the very end of the Le Dean age and he's
[54:39] saying we've had all these Believers die
[54:40] and he's identifying them waiting under
[54:43] the altar he says the church has to come
[54:46] to perfection in order to bring the
[54:49] resurrection all right so you want to
[54:50] know what's holding it away
[54:52] now we is right cuz the church has to
[54:56] come to perfection in order to bring the
[54:58] resurrection it's not your perfect
[55:00] auntie that's going to bring the
[55:02] resurrection as she comes up out of the
[55:04] grave and we have this this uh
[55:06] theological 30-day period or so or so
[55:09] where we're going to be fellowshipping
[55:10] with our uh dead loved ones who've
[55:12] resurrected and that's going to kind of
[55:13] give us rapturing Faith but he's saying
[55:15] we've got to be perfect in order to
[55:17] bring the resurrection there under the
[55:19] souls under the altar waiting for the
[55:21] church to come to its
[55:23] Perfection here's that statement I was
[55:25] referring to a moment ago
[55:27] in desperations every age has followed
[55:29] that to see that it's brought forth and
[55:31] they could not be made perfect without
[55:33] us so he's identifying an element of
[55:36] this scripture to our day a a compound
[55:39] fulfillment as Paul was speaking to them
[55:41] all these Believers in Christ and the
[55:43] Seed of Abraham were waiting for that
[55:46] for Christ to come and it redeemed the
[55:48] whole lot of them so now there's going
[55:50] to be a gentile Church age that when it
[55:54] reaches its climax it draws the rest of
[55:55] them from the grave and the on the
[55:56] Rapture cuz you remember Paradise
[55:57] emptied out and there was a faith that
[55:59] came that made the rest of them perfect
[56:02] he says this
[56:04] now and now he says is they could not be
[56:07] made perfect without us and now the
[56:08] entire Holy Spirit visits the church
[56:10] making God in human flesh and that's
[56:11] just a mouthful entire Holy Spirit
[56:14] visits the church he's identifying
[56:16] something dispensation different with
[56:18] our age from the Pentecostal Age The
[56:20] Bride age from the leot to seen age he
[56:22] says and all the things that he hasn't
[56:24] done down through the ages in the same
[56:25] message in the church ages he's do is
[56:28] now doing back to the word because the
[56:30] messages and the messages and the
[56:32] messages have to wind up in the entire
[56:33] word amen and in the last days the Seven
[56:36] Seals being open we're to pick up every
[56:38] straggle that's been left off in it and
[56:39] make the whole thing in one great big
[56:42] body of the Bride that them who Liv back
[56:45] there were not perfect until this church
[56:47] be perfected this bride group in the
[56:50] last days to bring them in and all
[56:51] together be taken
[56:53] up so when Paul is saying let us go on
[56:56] to Perfection God having provided some
[56:59] better thing for us that they without
[57:02] them uh they without us should not be
[57:04] made perfect now think of what that
[57:05] means for us everything God has
[57:08] established in the ages in the first
[57:10] church restored that Satan taken away
[57:13] everything that is true in this Bible
[57:15] everything as it relates to Jesus Christ
[57:17] there is the ultimate to Redemption
[57:20] there is the change of this body there
[57:22] is listen there's not until you defeat
[57:25] death and it can be said that death is
[57:27] swelled up in Victory so despite the
[57:29] resurrection of Jesus Christ the full
[57:32] climax of his victory and the full proof
[57:35] that he paid the price and rose again is
[57:37] when you put the Last Enemy under your
[57:39] [Applause]
[57:42] feet and he says that's when this church
[57:44] is perfected so it's this last great
[57:47] step is on into
[57:48] Perfection and we got to take the
[57:51] doctrines of baptism laying on the hands
[57:52] build this all part of our foundation
[57:54] but then we got to take that last step
[57:57] into
[57:58] Perfection now I haven't I haven't
[58:00] changed the
[58:02] subject but now I hope you could you can
[58:04] make this connection of what brother
[58:06] brandham is wanting I just want you to
[58:09] believe him I want you to believe
[58:11] without hands being laid on just simply
[58:12] believe the presence of the Lord is here
[58:14] here to heal the sick and take them at
[58:16] his word and all the greater Faith the
[58:18] bride's faith and elevated faith and and
[58:21] if I could just say this I'll just cut
[58:22] to my uh the last statement I was going
[58:24] to want to refer to brother say just
[58:26] take him in his word just believe him
[58:28] just believe him that's what I want you
[58:30] to do is just believe him without hands
[58:31] being L I just want you to believe him
[58:32] wherever you are just take him his word
[58:34] and just believe him and then we realize
[58:36] we're at a time when our bodies are
[58:37] going to be changed and brother Bradman
[58:39] and God hide him himself in Simplicity
[58:40] says God just speaks and the Rapture
[58:42] will come
[58:43] [Music]
[58:44] amen and even as I was thinking of it
[58:47] this morning that this Faith he's
[58:49] wanting to build up inside of us it's to
[58:51] believe it's to absolutely believe him
[58:53] so that the impossible can be done
[58:57] and he's got to bring that up in order
[58:58] for the change in order for us to be
[59:00] perfected now in 1 Corinthians 12: 4-1
[59:03] 11 I just want you I want to read it I'm
[59:06] not going to amplify it I just want you
[59:07] to read it so you could recognize the
[59:09] diversities the differences and the
[59:12] manifestations of gifts Spirit
[59:14] administrations operations all by The
[59:16] Same Spirit now there are diversities of
[59:18] gifts but the same spirit and there are
[59:21] differences of administrations but the
[59:23] same lord and there are diversities of
[59:25] operation
[59:26] but it's the same God work which worketh
[59:28] all in all and the trinitarian said I
[59:30] kind of like the way he wrote that but
[59:32] it's diversities of gifts but the Same
[59:33] Spirit differences of administrations
[59:35] but the same Lord diversities of
[59:37] operations but the same
[59:39] God it's all the same right but the
[59:43] gifts administrations and operations are
[59:45] all different but there can be different
[59:47] administrations of the
[59:49] Lord different dis diversities of the
[59:52] gifts of the Spirit different operations
[59:54] but it's all the same God verse 7 but
[59:57] the manifestation of the spirit is given
[59:59] to every man to profit with all and
[1:00:02] these gifts that are given it when
[1:00:04] they're given the manifestation of
[1:00:05] spirit is given to profit others right
[1:00:08] for to one is given by the spirit the
[1:00:10] word of wisdom to another the word of
[1:00:12] knowledge by The Same Spirit to another
[1:00:13] Faith by The Same Spirit to another the
[1:00:15] gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to
[1:00:17] another the working of Miracles another
[1:00:19] Pro to another prophecy to another
[1:00:21] Discerning of spirits to another diverse
[1:00:23] kinds of tongues to another the
[1:00:24] interpretation of tongues
[1:00:26] but all these worketh that one and the
[1:00:28] self Same Spirit dividing every man
[1:00:30] severly as he
[1:00:32] will so when brother BR says the entire
[1:00:35] Holy Ghost visits the church it's always
[1:00:37] been the Holy
[1:00:38] Ghost but there's an Administration
[1:00:41] there's an operation there's something
[1:00:43] he's wanting to do in the end time and
[1:00:45] that's what makes things different right
[1:00:48] you say well is it a different Jesus is
[1:00:50] a different Christ and he was always in
[1:00:51] the midst of the seven golden
[1:00:52] candlesticks through the church ages so
[1:00:54] is it the same Christ what happened well
[1:00:56] we find at the End of the Age he's
[1:00:57] kicked
[1:00:58] out knocking trying to get back in and
[1:01:01] when he does it's not just to start the
[1:01:04] cycle all over again it's for the
[1:01:06] Rapture but there's diversities of gifts
[1:01:09] differences of administrations
[1:01:10] diversities of operations I can share
[1:01:12] with you a number of different
[1:01:13] statements to substantiate this but
[1:01:15] every Church age has had
[1:01:17] Miracles every Church age from the book
[1:01:20] of Acts all the way to the time we're
[1:01:22] living in right now there's always been
[1:01:23] miracles signs wonders and gifts it's
[1:01:26] always been in the church it's always
[1:01:27] been within
[1:01:28] Christianity in every age brother R said
[1:01:30] every age is the age of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:31] for the believer in every age Believers
[1:01:34] have been sealed had received the true
[1:01:36] seal which is the New Birth the true
[1:01:37] seal of God Amen and been B by one
[1:01:40] Spirit baptized in the body of Christ so
[1:01:42] when we come to this the bride age and I
[1:01:45] I'm not using air quotes to belittle it
[1:01:46] because it's something very precious to
[1:01:47] me that's been demeaned I believe or
[1:01:49] misunderstood but we come to the bride
[1:01:51] age it's not oh now people are finally
[1:01:53] getting the real seal of God and it's
[1:01:55] not oh now the real righteous partaking
[1:01:57] of the gifts is going to take place no
[1:02:00] that the only chain if we did haven't
[1:02:03] had it in any church age we're
[1:02:06] frauds because the chain of evidence has
[1:02:08] been broken the chain of custody has
[1:02:10] been
[1:02:10] broken Jesus said go into all the world
[1:02:13] and teaching them whatsoever things
[1:02:14] teaching to obey whatsoever things I
[1:02:18] commanded you and the beauty of the
[1:02:19] Gospel is there's an unbroken chain back
[1:02:22] to that moment from Faith to
[1:02:24] Faith this is the way it works and so
[1:02:27] it's not like we're all of a sudden just
[1:02:28] arising out of a vacuum no there's
[1:02:30] always been in every age signs mirales
[1:02:34] wonders healings manifestations of the
[1:02:36] spirit and believers who are filled with
[1:02:37] the Holy
[1:02:39] Ghost and and was Sunday we mentioned
[1:02:42] that's the statement I remember I knew I
[1:02:44] grabbed these for a reason because I
[1:02:46] want to preach it
[1:02:49] again it was uh brother brandham saying
[1:02:51] that God the message of repentance to
[1:02:53] the church nominal and the message of
[1:02:55] Divine Healing to the church
[1:02:57] Pentecostal it's the message of Divine
[1:02:59] Healing is to the church Pentecostal and
[1:03:01] I haven't had the opportunity to check
[1:03:03] and verify but I have I have witnessed
[1:03:07] by by Miracle the internet Pentecostal
[1:03:10] ministers testifying to thousands of
[1:03:14] healings thousands cancers falling off
[1:03:18] dead raised crippled being healed limbs
[1:03:22] being extended deaf ears opening you
[1:03:24] name it I've heard a Pentecost Minister
[1:03:26] testified different ones multiple ones
[1:03:30] again it's the beauty of of YouTube you
[1:03:31] can you can listen to tens of thousands
[1:03:34] of hours and watch tens of thousand
[1:03:36] hours of Pentecostal services and you
[1:03:38] say how do you know well it's the 10,000
[1:03:39] hour requirement I'm an expert on
[1:03:41] Pentecostalism
[1:03:43] now you can watch it and it's happening
[1:03:46] and I would say be very careful to say
[1:03:49] no it's not
[1:03:50] happening cuz my God's A Healer my God's
[1:03:54] a deliverer my God can c cancer to fall
[1:03:56] off my God can straighten out limbs
[1:03:57] we've heard enough to believe that my
[1:03:59] God can raise the dead if somebody says
[1:04:01] that God raised the dead they go well
[1:04:03] what church do you go to no I just say
[1:04:05] what God were you praying to who were
[1:04:06] you believing in my God raises the
[1:04:10] dead and if somebody testifies to you at
[1:04:12] work this week on next Thursday morning
[1:04:14] says I had a cancer fall off in church
[1:04:17] this past Sunday don't ask what
[1:04:18] denomination they're in just say that's
[1:04:21] my
[1:04:22] God that's what my God does I'm a
[1:04:24] Believer I believe in the those things
[1:04:26] yes sir come on you believe it good and
[1:04:32] so that's the message uh that that's
[1:04:35] that's with it's part of our part of our
[1:04:38] faith if you start if you don't believe
[1:04:41] in Divine Healing anymore just wait till
[1:04:43] I finish this up here soon you're in
[1:04:47] trouble now when brother brandham said I
[1:04:49] want to preach on the little subject the
[1:04:51] countdown see how we've progressed he
[1:04:53] says we've left the Pentecostal age and
[1:04:55] he say this last great step must come
[1:04:57] into the Perfection this is connected
[1:04:59] with that those countdown principles he
[1:05:01] wanted to preach on and in the message
[1:05:03] the countdown he refers to the
[1:05:05] Pentecostal age as the airplane age and
[1:05:07] he says they took off they left the
[1:05:10] Earth with tongues and he says great
[1:05:13] gifts of healing genuine
[1:05:17] real he says had healings and sicknesses
[1:05:20] being healed cripples healed blind had
[1:05:22] their sight restored to them what was it
[1:05:25] the power of God had left the Earth it's
[1:05:27] moving in his church in that later scen
[1:05:30] age with signs and wonders and miracles
[1:05:33] all taking
[1:05:34] place and brother Chris kaval in the
[1:05:37] couple Services he's preached for us has
[1:05:40] taken this thought of what was happening
[1:05:43] in the natural with the astronauts and
[1:05:47] these certain things and at the very
[1:05:48] same time because it's it's the
[1:05:49] principal brother bram's drawn from and
[1:05:51] I'm not trying to steal your thunder
[1:05:52] before the next time it's the very
[1:05:54] principal brother bram's drawn from says
[1:05:56] look look at our John Glenn look at
[1:05:58] where we've come at the open of the word
[1:06:01] and at the very same time man is leaving
[1:06:04] Earth's
[1:06:05] atmosphere no longer in a jet ship and
[1:06:07] he's talking about that this there's
[1:06:09] something that's happened and so this
[1:06:12] these things are he's typing these
[1:06:14] things out in the church age and even
[1:06:15] the the scientific
[1:06:17] advancements and in the airplane
[1:06:20] age everything that was happening in the
[1:06:23] church in Paul's day was taking place in
[1:06:25] the airplane
[1:06:27] age it was the it was the signs wonders
[1:06:30] Miracles at Pentecost the the uh
[1:06:33] restoration of the gifts baptism in
[1:06:35] Jesus
[1:06:37] name but elevated Faith goes beyond this
[1:06:43] right to elevate it actually in the uh
[1:06:46] it comes for L and Lavar which means to
[1:06:49] lighten or and the the Lavar is
[1:06:51] conjugated from levice which means to be
[1:06:54] light in weight
[1:06:58] elevated it's to to
[1:07:01] lighten brother talking about why you
[1:07:03] packing up right lighten yourself and
[1:07:06] what he's preaching the SE the first
[1:07:08] seal he's referring to the Seven Seals
[1:07:10] being open he's referring to Revelations
[1:07:12] 10 he's talking about the church needing
[1:07:14] something he says there's something in
[1:07:15] there that we just can't lighten oursel
[1:07:18] with and I never understood it until I
[1:07:21] caught this elevated part is to lighten
[1:07:24] yourself there's something something
[1:07:25] going to come under the open of the word
[1:07:27] to elevate us to lighten ourselves with
[1:07:30] it's your faith that touch to elevate
[1:07:32] ourselves with Bill Brandman the sermon
[1:07:34] countdown now but now friends may I say
[1:07:36] this remember what the airplane age is
[1:07:37] the horse and buggy the advancements the
[1:07:39] advancements the airplane age he says
[1:07:40] it's come to the age of the astronaut
[1:07:43] we've moved out of this airplane age we
[1:07:45] got more power astronaut age has come in
[1:07:48] what is it we've come into a spiritual
[1:07:50] age of the astronaut going above he says
[1:07:53] it's not and I not sure what he was
[1:07:56] going to say but he says it's the same
[1:07:57] Spirit only more
[1:07:59] power so there's no man boo boo right to
[1:08:02] the Pentecostals they have their measure
[1:08:04] they have their portion but he says it's
[1:08:06] the same Spirit only more power only
[1:08:08] lifted higher can go higher see more
[1:08:11] believe more be more like
[1:08:14] Christ that's
[1:08:16] good there's there's if you ever have
[1:08:18] triplet you can have see more believe
[1:08:19] more and be
[1:08:21] more go higher see more believe more be
[1:08:23] more like Christ not the automobile not
[1:08:25] the horse and buggy not even the
[1:08:27] airplane but the astronaut he sweeps on
[1:08:29] and above each
[1:08:32] one taking the power that they had and
[1:08:35] if it because says improving on it
[1:08:37] catching the real thought behind it
[1:08:39] there's some sort of propulsion that
[1:08:40] makes this go there's some sort of power
[1:08:43] and we can duplicate this power uh
[1:08:45] through this propulsion and if we have
[1:08:47] more of it and we get more aerodynamic
[1:08:49] and we learn from these things then we
[1:08:50] can actually get off the ground and they
[1:08:52] just Advance the same thing evolving and
[1:08:55] material iiz into something greater
[1:08:57] above each
[1:08:59] one it's the same power though it's a
[1:09:02] part I really don't want you to I I
[1:09:04] don't want you to miss that same
[1:09:06] power if you say that Pentecost didn't
[1:09:09] have power then what are we left
[1:09:11] with and it can this is now at the end
[1:09:13] of the sermon he's praying father count
[1:09:15] down now father so many things that
[1:09:17] could be said right here maybe the
[1:09:18] church wouldn't understand but I pray
[1:09:21] that you'll give them such a crave for
[1:09:23] it I love that yes you give them such a
[1:09:26] crave for it Lord that they'll come and
[1:09:29] see we're at the end time the astronaut
[1:09:33] AG not now as Paul think about what Paul
[1:09:36] said now if you're going to desire gifts
[1:09:38] you're going to Crave for going to
[1:09:39] desire desire the perfect desire
[1:09:42] charity he speaks that crave and Paul
[1:09:44] knows how to orient him Paul knows how
[1:09:46] to focus him because when that which is
[1:09:47] perfect has
[1:09:48] come
[1:09:50] he if you if you seek that which is
[1:09:54] perfect
[1:09:56] he says when that which is perfect has
[1:09:57] come then that which is in part is done
[1:09:59] away with if you only want the part you
[1:10:02] can have that but you won't have the
[1:10:05] perfect but if you get the perfect you
[1:10:07] got the
[1:10:09] parts if you get the perfect the parts
[1:10:11] are in
[1:10:12] it he says get a crave let this work
[1:10:15] work in your heart I'm almost finished
[1:10:16] here let that work in Your Heart Lord I
[1:10:17] want to Crave
[1:10:19] this he says I pray father that th'll
[1:10:21] realize that isn't trying to condemn
[1:10:23] what they had this may maybe where maybe
[1:10:26] even as a minister I've may you I could
[1:10:28] make that mistake of using some of these
[1:10:30] statements and quotes to come across as
[1:10:31] if condemning what somebody else has or
[1:10:34] what this church had or what this age
[1:10:36] had he says we're not trying to condemn
[1:10:37] what they had it's only trying to give
[1:10:39] them more rapturing
[1:10:41] grace and this is what you ought to
[1:10:43] Crave for more rapturing grace he's
[1:10:46] showing these things of the airplane in
[1:10:47] the Pentecostal age and Allen Ash on age
[1:10:49] which would be a bride age he's showing
[1:10:51] that the eagle ages he refers to it he
[1:10:53] says it's to give them more rapture
[1:10:55] Grace for the hour will come when we
[1:10:59] will have to have Rapture
[1:11:02] power not only to heal the body but to
[1:11:04] change it in a
[1:11:06] moment in a twinkling of an
[1:11:08] eye Christ will be so real into their
[1:11:11] bodies till he can change it by his
[1:11:14] great death in what he
[1:11:15] purchased is it not by his great death
[1:11:18] in what he purchased that we receive our
[1:11:19] Divine Healing amen and he says we're
[1:11:21] going to have to have power not just to
[1:11:22] heal the body but to change it Christ
[1:11:25] can be so real into our
[1:11:28] bodies so real into our bodies as he
[1:11:31] tried to find that statement we read a
[1:11:33] moment ago where he says that that is
[1:11:35] this Christ is going to work within his
[1:11:37] church and move so perfectly in the
[1:11:41] church to till we raise the dead and we
[1:11:43] go in the
[1:11:45] resurrection he says Christ will be so
[1:11:47] real into their bodies till he can
[1:11:48] change
[1:11:49] it by what he
[1:11:53] purchased is he referred to this in the
[1:11:55] countdown it's Atomic power he says a
[1:11:58] greater power that presses him so much
[1:12:00] higher than an airplane how much greater
[1:12:03] is the astronaut from the old horsepower
[1:12:05] automobile power and the airplane power
[1:12:08] it's something that presses him so much
[1:12:09] higher it elevates him so much higher
[1:12:12] and that's where brother bandam want
[1:12:13] wants us to get you can't stay in an
[1:12:15] airplane age if you stay in that age
[1:12:17] you're always Earthbound you're always
[1:12:19] held within its atmosphere but I want
[1:12:21] you to believe him absolutely believe
[1:12:24] him because we're Liv in the time and
[1:12:26] the hour where a bride has to pierce
[1:12:28] through that atmospheric Veil and go
[1:12:31] into the air to meet
[1:12:35] him you'll have to have Rapture power
[1:12:38] and he says not only do heal the body to
[1:12:40] change it and what has he done Rapture
[1:12:42] power and he puts heal the
[1:12:45] body you have to have Rapture power not
[1:12:47] only to heal it but to change
[1:12:51] it why because Divine Healing is
[1:12:53] relevant to elevated faith
[1:12:55] Divine Healing is relevant to the perect
[1:12:58] perfect Faith the rapturing faith I'm
[1:12:59] only trying to give you more rapturing
[1:13:01] grace and how is he trying to give them
[1:13:02] rapturing Grace by showing them how
[1:13:04] we've
[1:13:05] progressed he doesn't say oh the horse
[1:13:07] and buggy it's a myth have you ever seen
[1:13:08] a horse and buggy anybody here ever
[1:13:10] actually seen a horse and buggy raise
[1:13:11] your hand if you've never seen a horse
[1:13:12] and
[1:13:14] buggy yeah how do you how do you even
[1:13:15] know they're
[1:13:17] real how do you know that we all just
[1:13:19] haven't got together and said let's make
[1:13:22] sister Nicole believe that there's
[1:13:23] actually horse and Buggies
[1:13:25] right Birds aren't real right the Earth
[1:13:28] is flat
[1:13:31] nice what was I talking
[1:13:33] about brother bam is not wanting them to
[1:13:36] doubt the horse and buggy the
[1:13:40] automobile the airplane he wants them to
[1:13:43] see that if the Same Spirit can cause do
[1:13:47] what he did in the horse and buggy age
[1:13:50] and then grow to an automobile age and
[1:13:53] then grow to an airplane age then the
[1:13:55] Same Spirit can do things in me that are
[1:13:59] necessary for the time that I'm living
[1:14:02] in and he can reveal it in the time that
[1:14:04] I need it and you could see the power of
[1:14:06] God grow and grow and grow he just
[1:14:09] doesn't wake us out of bed and say oh
[1:14:11] I'm drunk I'm hung over you got to
[1:14:12] change your body buddy there's a Rapture
[1:14:15] coming I'm
[1:14:17] trying no he takes you from birth to
[1:14:20] maturity Faith to perfect faith and
[1:14:23] Divine Healing is that very symbol of
[1:14:26] the change of our body remember the son
[1:14:28] of righteousness will rise with healing
[1:14:30] in his wings brother B said it's not the
[1:14:31] physical healing you're thinking of his
[1:14:33] spoken word will be Vindicated when the
[1:14:35] son of righteousness shall rise with
[1:14:36] heal in his wings in the healing part
[1:14:39] there this is Malachi 4's ministry will
[1:14:42] not be a physical healing as you think
[1:14:44] as somebody's got a sickness and it'll
[1:14:46] be taken away from him that's what he's
[1:14:48] doing now in type so when he's doing
[1:14:51] that now in type he's pointing to what
[1:14:53] it really means when the son of
[1:14:54] righteous will arise with healing in his
[1:14:56] wings I let me put it this way if just
[1:14:58] for you understand the greatest healing
[1:15:00] is when you get a body that never needs
[1:15:02] to be healed again right you know and
[1:15:05] someone says there I fixed it and it
[1:15:07] gets broke again and you said it broke
[1:15:08] again well I fixed it I just got to fix
[1:15:10] it again that's what Divine Healing is
[1:15:11] all
[1:15:12] about you're broke it gets fixed it's
[1:15:15] going to get broke again but when the
[1:15:17] son of righteousness shall arise with
[1:15:19] healing in his wings you're you have a
[1:15:21] body that is never going to get sick
[1:15:24] never get never lose its
[1:15:26] hair never get
[1:15:29] inflamation right never get tired never
[1:15:31] get bent over never get weak I'm I
[1:15:34] haven't even mentioned a sickness
[1:15:38] yet have we changed the song there'll be
[1:15:41] no Co there we are going to see the King
[1:15:45] right there be no social distancing
[1:15:48] there I need the
[1:15:51] organ and the healing part will not be a
[1:15:53] physical healing as you think CU
[1:15:54] somebody has got sickness that it's
[1:15:55] taken away from him that's what he's
[1:15:56] doing now in type but the whole creature
[1:15:58] will be
[1:15:59] changed every time somebody heal is
[1:16:02] healed you remember the whole creature
[1:16:03] is going to be changed let it be the
[1:16:05] testimony in this church whenever
[1:16:06] someone testifies that God healed them
[1:16:09] let it be a reminder the whole thing is
[1:16:11] going to be
[1:16:12] changed I know it's really hard to
[1:16:14] imagine but really in an in alternate
[1:16:16] dimension in just mere Dimension we're
[1:16:18] all about 18 to 21 years old and this is
[1:16:20] a youth
[1:16:23] service the meeting there is going to
[1:16:25] look like a youth camp etern we're all
[1:16:27] going to be young again I'm going to
[1:16:29] look like Elliott
[1:16:32] Glory that's that's what every healing
[1:16:35] ought to testify to you the whole
[1:16:37] thing's going to change if somebody has
[1:16:40] a a a a back that has been out thrown
[1:16:43] out and it's healed they have a surgery
[1:16:45] and God comes along and heals it cancer
[1:16:47] sickness disease whatever it is let's
[1:16:49] say that's the evidence that there's a
[1:16:51] change coming let it testify that he's
[1:16:55] here and he's building rapturing faith
[1:16:58] in this
[1:17:00] church the whole creature will be
[1:17:01] changed this Mortal will take on
[1:17:03] immortality this old age will jump into
[1:17:08] youth this old age will jump into youth
[1:17:12] that's what it means when you you have a
[1:17:15] headache and you pray and it's gone this
[1:17:16] old age is going to jump into youth when
[1:17:19] you have something swollen you pray for
[1:17:20] it God heals it this old age is going to
[1:17:22] jump into you when somebody has blood
[1:17:24] test done they have all sorts of
[1:17:25] negative results from the blood test the
[1:17:27] doctors are concerned they need to do a
[1:17:29] scan they do the scan they look into it
[1:17:31] no there's nothing wrong your blood's
[1:17:32] completely clear there's a new blood
[1:17:33] coming there's a new body coming it's
[1:17:36] testifying every day of a whole change
[1:17:39] of our creature brother brandom says in
[1:17:41] 10 virgins but Divine Healing has more
[1:17:43] to it than just Divine
[1:17:44] Healing Divine Healing is a miracle of
[1:17:48] God it's God divinely remedying an
[1:17:51] ailment or a sickness or an Affliction
[1:17:52] in someone's spirit or body and when
[1:17:55] that happens he says there's actually
[1:17:56] more to it than that we think oh well I
[1:17:58] had a broken limb and it was restored or
[1:18:00] I had a something uh missing and it come
[1:18:02] grows back I had a cancer F he said no
[1:18:04] no no no that may be what you see but
[1:18:06] there's more to it he says Divine
[1:18:08] Healing only says there's a God who's
[1:18:10] coming
[1:18:11] again there's only a god who's going to
[1:18:13] be so real into the bride's body that
[1:18:15] it'll change it there's only a god who's
[1:18:17] going to be so one and uniting with the
[1:18:19] church it only testifies to a god who's
[1:18:23] here now and the bride coming to Christ
[1:18:25] to be so real to bring up a resurrection
[1:18:27] it only testifies there's a God coming
[1:18:29] again what does Divine Healing speak of
[1:18:32] it's the earnest of our Resurrection if
[1:18:34] there's no Divine Healing there is no
[1:18:36] Resurrection that's exactly what these
[1:18:38] things are to do is to remind us we're
[1:18:41] not here for this life on this body has
[1:18:44] a natural trajectory that when you ought
[1:18:46] to get when you get sick it ought just
[1:18:47] to lead to another one to another one to
[1:18:49] another one to a grave and when the body
[1:18:51] is bit down and get sick and God comes
[1:18:53] along and picks you up when need Elevate
[1:18:55] you out of that sickness that ought to
[1:18:56] remind you that this body is not going
[1:18:59] to go down to a grave but one day it's
[1:19:01] going to step right up into a
[1:19:03] resurrection because that's exactly what
[1:19:05] Divine Healing speaks of is a change of
[1:19:08] the whole
[1:19:09] [Applause]
[1:19:11] [Music]
[1:19:14] body and if I could end on this thought
[1:19:16] then if that's what Divine Healing
[1:19:20] types then our approach to it and our
[1:19:24] understanding of it
[1:19:25] will improve our approach to the body
[1:19:29] change
[1:19:30] right if if it's a type of the change of
[1:19:34] our body then our understanding of it
[1:19:37] and our approach to it will improve our
[1:19:39] approach to the
[1:19:40] Rapture because if I had my choice right
[1:19:43] now the Lord said now brother Aaron you
[1:19:45] could either be healed of these things
[1:19:47] for the rest of your life are you go in
[1:19:49] the
[1:19:51] Rapture and I me you're you're messing
[1:19:55] with me
[1:19:56] right have I been so long with you that
[1:19:59] you don't really know what my heart's
[1:20:00] cry is Lord but if I had the choice i'
[1:20:03] say you can give me whatever you
[1:20:04] want I'll take the
[1:20:06] Rapture that's what I want and then he
[1:20:10] says well Divine Healing is going to
[1:20:14] help you understand how to get there
[1:20:16] right good because it's a
[1:20:19] type brother random in the sermon go
[1:20:21] awake Jesus he's he's at the very end of
[1:20:23] the sermon
[1:20:25] he's talking about Just Surrender he may
[1:20:27] have been singing I Surrender Just
[1:20:28] Surrender to him yield these people who
[1:20:29] are being healed and sick Desiring their
[1:20:31] heal and he says everything is
[1:20:33] surrendered I'm no more my own thinking
[1:20:36] this is this is Rapture
[1:20:37] thinking I ain't going to think like I'd
[1:20:40] think Lord I'm going to think like you
[1:20:42] think and you promised that I was
[1:20:46] healed I think
[1:20:48] that other words I'm I'm going think I'm
[1:20:51] Healed I Surrender my thinking I won't
[1:20:55] more think I won't I won't no more think
[1:20:57] about my
[1:20:59] sickness I won't think about that
[1:21:01] disease I had I ain't thinking about
[1:21:03] nothing but thinking what you
[1:21:06] said and I know you've heard this
[1:21:08] statement before but watch how he puts
[1:21:10] this this beautiful poetry now now right
[1:21:12] out in front of you stands a
[1:21:15] person just like you were a few minutes
[1:21:18] ago he says you were sick down
[1:21:21] here but there's a well person standing
[1:21:24] there
[1:21:26] now however you want to look at that in
[1:21:29] in this this schema if you were to draw
[1:21:30] it out there's maybe just different ways
[1:21:32] you could look at it and draw it out but
[1:21:34] here he's saying there's a person just
[1:21:36] like you so here you are you're standing
[1:21:37] there says you were sick down
[1:21:40] there and he says there's a well person
[1:21:42] standing
[1:21:43] there Jesus Christ is calling to that
[1:21:47] well person right Beyond
[1:21:49] it now the way that it's often struck me
[1:21:52] is that you have somebody who is down
[1:21:55] here and just a little bit higher as a
[1:21:57] well body and Jesus Christ is a little
[1:22:00] bit higher on the other side of that
[1:22:02] wellbody calling to it amen that there's
[1:22:06] you're sick and a little bit higher as a
[1:22:08] wellbody but Christ is on the other side
[1:22:10] of it calling you to it and so this is
[1:22:13] this is for Divine Healing but think
[1:22:14] about this language and how it applies
[1:22:16] to our body change Jesus Christ is
[1:22:19] calling to that well person right Beyond
[1:22:20] it now you just by faith as You Close
[1:22:24] Your Eyes walk right into that well
[1:22:31] body then just keep on walking just keep
[1:22:34] on going I surrender
[1:22:37] all I can with my eyes I'm closing off
[1:22:41] anything when I close my eyes it's all
[1:22:42] these other senses that would speak
[1:22:44] contrary to this faith that is inside of
[1:22:47] me and I'm going to walk into that well
[1:22:49] body and just as I can walk into a well
[1:22:52] body and receive Divine Healing it's
[1:22:55] going to be that faith that becomes an
[1:22:56] elevated Faith to step right into a
[1:22:59] union with Jesus Christ and ultimately a
[1:23:02] meeting in the
[1:23:04] air
[1:23:06] Hallelujah Jesus Christ is calling and
[1:23:10] that's why you want to step into he says
[1:23:11] just keep on
[1:23:12] walking higher and higher and
[1:23:16] higher brother brandom that's what he
[1:23:18] wanted us to do is he wanted us just to
[1:23:21] take it and to believe it and just walk
[1:23:23] with it amen keep walking in it I
[1:23:27] probably should
[1:23:28] have highlighted those you remember what
[1:23:31] he
[1:23:32] said you don't
[1:23:35] okay he says just keep walking in
[1:23:38] it believe it on a higher order is to
[1:23:41] accept it without hands being laid on
[1:23:43] you you just believe it and walk
[1:23:47] away and with each step you rise
[1:23:50] higher each step amen with each step
[1:23:55] not falling back down again and
[1:23:57] repeating the cycle but each step going
[1:24:02] higher the this is this is talking about
[1:24:07] practice the Practical practice of our
[1:24:11] faith as we're pursuing this
[1:24:15] Perfection this is what it is that I
[1:24:18] have moments I have opportunities to
[1:24:20] exercise my faith because I I am I am
[1:24:23] believing this is my testimony as a
[1:24:25] Believer I believe that I will not
[1:24:28] die or that if I do die this body will
[1:24:31] be changed that I will not forever
[1:24:32] remain in a grave but that I my I will
[1:24:35] enter into dimension of waiting Saints
[1:24:36] waiting for the church to be perfected
[1:24:38] and I will enter into a theophany body
[1:24:41] but there will be a moment and a time
[1:24:43] when you will conquer death and at that
[1:24:45] moment I will come back to get my
[1:24:46] glorified body yours will be change and
[1:24:48] you'll meet your theophany and we
[1:24:50] believe we're actually going to meet in
[1:24:51] the
[1:24:52] air there's going to be a meeting we
[1:24:54] believe that that takes
[1:24:57] faith that takes rapturing Faith some of
[1:25:00] us don't even have enough Faith to make
[1:25:01] it to church right but we're going to
[1:25:04] make it to a meeting in the air and
[1:25:06] that's why we have church is to God for
[1:25:08] God to meet us time and time again
[1:25:11] wherever we are in whatever weaknesses
[1:25:13] we have whatever difficulties we're
[1:25:14] having to grow us to build us to that
[1:25:17] place we could just keep taking steps
[1:25:18] higher but it's a practical practice of
[1:25:21] your faith going to church paying ties
[1:25:23] taking uh communion washing one
[1:25:25] another's feet praying for one another
[1:25:27] all the different ways we have opportuni
[1:25:29] one serve one another it's the growing
[1:25:31] of this
[1:25:32] faith and there's your image of Divine
[1:25:35] Healing a well body you're sick there's
[1:25:37] a well body Jesus Christ is calling just
[1:25:39] beyond it by faith I'm going to step
[1:25:40] into that so your approach to being
[1:25:43] healed helps you in your approach to
[1:25:45] being
[1:25:47] changed that's my that was my thesis
[1:25:49] that was my point
[1:25:51] today the message influence brother says
[1:25:54] and God is sending
[1:25:55] gifts to try to create in us a faith
[1:25:58] that'll move us out of
[1:25:59] here someday into a
[1:26:02] Rapture Healing The Sick Open the Eyes
[1:26:05] of the blind raising up the
[1:26:08] dead why to create in us a faith that we
[1:26:11] can move out of
[1:26:13] here he's not doing these things so it
[1:26:15] can make it more comfortable for us to
[1:26:17] stay but he's doing it so we can grow
[1:26:19] our faith Elevate our faith to leave
[1:26:21] here now in this Healing The Sick
[1:26:23] musician the feet come Healing The Sick
[1:26:25] opening the eyes of the blind rais up
[1:26:26] the dead we know you can't major on
[1:26:27] these
[1:26:29] things but the major the major Christ
[1:26:32] the word can place these things and make
[1:26:34] them Stepping Stones Amen to elevate our
[1:26:37] faith amen God bless you thank you for
[1:26:39] your attention today elevated faith I
[1:26:42] think it's a beautiful thought let's
[1:26:43] stand
