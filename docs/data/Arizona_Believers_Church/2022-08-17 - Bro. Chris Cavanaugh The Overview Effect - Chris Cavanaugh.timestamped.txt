[0:00] and we're going to turn to a familiar
[0:03] scripture Hebrews
[0:08] 11 verses 1
[0:15] to3 and we know it's a Wednesday night
[0:17] so we'll try not to hold you too
[0:20] long um but just try and bring out
[0:23] another little thought to you this
[0:25] evening so Hebrews 11: 1:3 it says this
[0:28] now Faith is the substance of things
[0:29] hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[0:32] for by it the elders obtained a good
[0:34] report through faith we understand that
[0:36] the worlds were framed by the word of
[0:38] God so that things which were are seen
[0:40] were not made of things which do
[0:46] appear amen if you could just go to the
[0:48] next slide
[0:51] brother I just want to read this from
[0:53] the countdown it says but God in the
[0:54] spiritual achievement is going forward
[0:57] not going backward he's going forward
[0:58] looking into the word
[1:00] and believing the promises for the
[1:02] things that never has come yet for the
[1:04] spiritual Revelations to manifest the
[1:06] spiritual things that God has promised
[1:08] he sees them come to pass just as a
[1:10] scientist in his laboratory are working
[1:12] on different things uh to help man
[1:15] taking creation the spiritual man is
[1:18] looking forward to something that God
[1:20] promised that has never yet been created
[1:25] amen let's just bow our heads for a word
[1:27] of prayer Heavenly Father we're a
[1:30] privileged people today Lord to be able
[1:32] to gather in your name and father what a
[1:35] blessing it is to be in our right mind
[1:37] and father it's not our human mind but
[1:40] the right mind of Jesus Christ today
[1:42] Lord that father has brought a word to
[1:45] us Lord has bought a spirit to us and
[1:48] father by those things Lord that we're
[1:50] able to achieve such great things in
[1:52] Jesus Christ and God we're just so
[1:54] appreciative of it today Lord we just
[1:56] ask that you'd come in a special way and
[1:58] anoint my lips and the lips of those
[2:00] that hear father that we would be able
[2:02] to receive of you the things that you'd
[2:04] have for us father to be encouraged by
[2:07] them to be exhorted Lord to be lifted up
[2:09] into higher places and deeper depths in
[2:11] Jesus Christ we ask in Jesus name amen
[2:15] you can be
[2:21] seated so I uh I am uh 100% more
[2:26] experienced with doing a PowerPoint
[2:28] presentation for church than I was the
[2:29] last last time which also means that I'm
[2:33] twice as likely to have mess ups in the
[2:34] PowerPoint presentation since I've done
[2:36] two um but uh anyway you know I think
[2:40] it's kind of like freshman and sophomore
[2:42] year like they have sometimes somebody
[2:43] does great their freshman year and their
[2:45] sophomore year they're kind of a failure
[2:46] so hopefully that's not that tonight um
[2:49] not that two PowerPoint presentations is
[2:50] a sophomore year but uh you almost feel
[2:53] like it after you try and work through
[2:55] those things so um I'm going to pick up
[2:58] uh the last time that we were gathered
[2:59] for those of you that were here uh we
[3:02] were talking about X Factor and in that
[3:04] particular service we talked about
[3:05] representation and um we took the
[3:08] thought from uh brother Brandon teaching
[3:10] on the countdown and I've kind of been
[3:14] having a lot of different thoughts come
[3:15] from that particular sermon and from the
[3:18] things that are actually happening uh in
[3:20] the world today and kind of looking at
[3:23] those two different things so I just
[3:24] want to kind of give a quick uh review
[3:27] of what he talked about so um
[3:30] in the countdown he was taking the
[3:33] natural world and actually the creation
[3:35] of man and typing it with the spiritual
[3:38] world and what God was doing in the
[3:39] church and so he brought out different
[3:42] things from that the the natural what
[3:45] man was doing and typed it with the
[3:47] spiritual to just let us know kind of
[3:48] what was going on so um he typed
[3:51] justification with the horse and buggy
[3:54] hopefully you can see those pictures a
[3:55] little bit sanctification with the
[3:58] automobile and the restoration of the
[4:00] gifts or the Holy Spirit coming back
[4:02] with the gifts upon the church is the
[4:04] airplane and then the Holy Ghost is that
[4:07] spaceship and he inaugurated as the
[4:09] astronaut age and so it was an amazing
[4:13] thing to me to think that you would I
[4:15] wouldn't tie these things together
[4:16] personally I I I don't know how I would
[4:19] so that's why we have a prophet right
[4:20] because there's all kinds of things in
[4:22] the scripture that I don't know how we
[4:24] would tie it together like how do you
[4:26] how do you how do you how do you Poss
[4:29] possibly in your mind be able to Fathom
[4:32] the things of God and even today you'll
[4:34] read things and read things and read
[4:35] things and it's funny how you do it or
[4:36] at least this is what I do I'll read
[4:38] something and maybe 10 times later I'll
[4:40] read the same thing and all of a sudden
[4:42] it's like wow I didn't even realize it
[4:44] said that and it just comes out you know
[4:47] the Lord reveals those things to us in
[4:49] such a way that it's just an amazing
[4:51] thing and so brother random has taken
[4:54] this and he's tied this particular thing
[4:56] and the countdown together and then he
[4:58] said this is a by way of prophetic when
[5:00] he was talking about what the countdown
[5:02] was and he was going through and and
[5:04] listing it so what we had done the last
[5:06] time was I went through and kind of just
[5:08] showed because I think it's real
[5:09] important especially with so much
[5:13] discouragement uh towards brother
[5:16] brandom and towards the word in general
[5:19] I I think it's really important
[5:20] especially for our young people and even
[5:21] some of our more mature folks that we
[5:24] really establish the fact that he knew
[5:27] what he was talking about this was was
[5:29] no mistake in what he was talking about
[5:32] and so one of the things that we talked
[5:33] about was that we we go back in the
[5:35] scripture um and we look at uh the
[5:38] scripture back in Genesis we realized
[5:40] that what happened in the days of Noah
[5:41] and so there were particular people that
[5:43] were involved in this particular story
[5:46] and we know that the scripture says hey
[5:47] we're going to be living in the days of
[5:48] Noah at the last times uh we understand
[5:51] things are going to be occurring um so
[5:53] you you go back and and look in the
[5:55] scripture and think okay so what what
[5:57] was going on in those days or what what
[6:00] today would tie us back to that to say
[6:02] okay we're living in the days of no one
[6:03] so we can look around us and
[6:05] see
[6:07] how I guess the word would be horrible I
[6:09] I don't know what's a good what's a
[6:11] descriptive word I I I I guess the worst
[6:14] adjectives you can come up with and that
[6:16] pretty much describes it like think of
[6:17] the worst food that you hate completely
[6:20] and if you were said hey you have to eat
[6:21] this whole plate of whatever that is I
[6:23] don't know what it is but uh well I can
[6:26] tell you what it is for me but I won't
[6:28] say but I don't what that is for you but
[6:30] whatever that thing particular thing is
[6:33] when you go to to eat it that's how bad
[6:35] it is like I I can't stomach this kind
[6:37] of like brother brandom talked about
[6:38] castor oil and how bad it was and he
[6:41] couldn't handle it so it's kind of like
[6:42] the world's kind of castor oil right now
[6:44] because it's really hard to swallow
[6:46] really hard to to take that flavor and
[6:48] taste it so we're just at a an
[6:51] interesting um juncture of time so one
[6:55] of the things I um wanted to to say just
[6:59] before we move move on to the next thing
[7:00] where I'm going to just give a real
[7:01] quick backdrop on that is if you notice
[7:04] in those slides of Transportation
[7:07] there's something that's real important
[7:08] that we need to notice about it is that
[7:11] it doesn't say anything about the humans
[7:13] walking right every one of those is a
[7:16] vehicle every one of those is something
[7:18] that you ride in everything in fact if
[7:21] you're on the horse and buggy and it's
[7:22] moving pretty quick and you come out of
[7:24] it you're going to get hurt and if
[7:25] you're in the automobile it's worse and
[7:27] if you're in the airplane it's worse and
[7:28] by the time you get to the space brother
[7:30] sister unless you're suited up and and
[7:32] you know still Tethered to that ship you
[7:34] come out of that thing it's not good
[7:36] right as we can we can look back in
[7:37] history and see those things so in Acts
[7:40] the 17th chapter and the 28th verse it
[7:42] says this for in him we live and move
[7:46] and have our being as certain also of
[7:48] your own poets have said for we are also
[7:50] his offspring so I want you to have that
[7:53] idea when when we're thinking about
[7:54] these different vehicles that he had
[7:56] typed with and then we think of
[7:58] justification saying to ification the
[8:00] gifts being restored and the Holy Ghost
[8:02] so Jesus Christ himself the word coming
[8:04] and indwelling when we think of those
[8:07] things the power that was given to the
[8:09] church in each of those different ages
[8:11] or in each of those different times
[8:13] wasn't the church moving itself it was
[8:15] the church being moved by something
[8:18] greater than the church so when Martin
[8:20] Luther got a revelation of justification
[8:22] this was something amazing that it
[8:24] happened because remember the the
[8:26] Catholic church had had you know
[8:28] basically squeezed everybody down and it
[8:30] had become so dark but yet just a a
[8:33] thing a word of God that had come and it
[8:35] moved people in such a way that they
[8:37] could not only just come out of that
[8:39] organization but actually live a whole
[8:41] different life than they had prior to
[8:43] that and you could go through the
[8:44] sanctification the same thing and with
[8:46] the gifts the same thing and and and so
[8:49] so on and so on so I just want you to
[8:51] kind of have in the back of your mind
[8:52] that when we're talking about this
[8:55] spaceship today or when we're talking
[8:57] about what we're going to talk about
[8:59] that we move when God moves spiritually
[9:03] we're moving as God takes us so that's
[9:07] what I kind of want you to have in the
[9:08] back of your mind so uh if you remember
[9:10] in Genesis we start out and we're
[9:12] talking about uh
[9:15] Noah and Noah had three sons ham Shem
[9:18] and japeth and the interesting thing
[9:21] about uh ham was he was the one that we
[9:24] tie all the IES to and the steens to and
[9:27] if there's somebody bad in the Bible
[9:28] pretty much you can trace it back to ham
[9:31] because he was the one that brought the
[9:33] the Philistines and the amorites and
[9:36] whatever jebusites and like I said any
[9:38] IES I don't know if you have any IES in
[9:39] your life but if if you want to blame
[9:42] ham that's kind of where it came from so
[9:45] in the Space Race um we were battling
[9:48] Russia America was trying to get up into
[9:51] space and by the way this isn't a space
[9:54] lesson this isn't a science lesson I'm
[9:56] not trying to teach you science because
[9:58] I'm not a scientist but I do see a
[10:00] correlation between what happened and
[10:04] and the word of God in fact let me put
[10:06] it to you this way when I was a kid and
[10:08] I don't remember if I shared this before
[10:09] but when I was a kid I was raised Roman
[10:11] Catholic and so when you're young and uh
[10:15] your parents plan Christmas it's a
[10:17] pretty big deal and so I don't know
[10:19] about kids but I was pretty excited to
[10:21] get presents right because presents are
[10:23] awesome at least that's what I thought
[10:24] when I was a kid so uh as you get older
[10:27] you maybe don't appreciate it as much
[10:28] but when you're young it's very exciting
[10:31] and not being the best of kids uh I
[10:33] always look for the presents that my mom
[10:36] would would hide cuz I was excited to
[10:39] get them cuz they were presents right
[10:41] cuz you're a kid and it's very exciting
[10:43] let's go find the present so I'd look
[10:45] everywhere I'd search in the garage I'd
[10:47] search through their closet under the
[10:48] bed in the dresser everything and my mom
[10:51] was a good shopper so she'd always buy
[10:53] stuff ahead of time and all those years
[10:56] of of being a kid and and and that and
[10:59] searching for presents I didn't find
[11:00] anything like ever but always stuff
[11:04] would show up you know the day that it
[11:05] was supposed to show up here'd be all
[11:07] these presence and it's like where did
[11:08] they hide them CU I know they didn't go
[11:10] out because of course being a kid you
[11:12] stay up as long as you can right and you
[11:13] sneak around and try and see what you
[11:15] can find out but she would hide things
[11:18] in plain sight just right on a bookshelf
[11:21] I didn't think to look on the bookshelf
[11:23] cuz there a right in the living room you
[11:25] know above the fireplace on the mantle
[11:27] something would be hidden and the most
[11:29] obvious places you could possibly think
[11:32] all those things were there and that's
[11:33] where she put them and I never caught on
[11:37] and I think sometimes that's what the
[11:38] Lord does he puts things in obvious
[11:40] places and we just don't sometimes it
[11:42] just doesn't click for us um you know in
[11:45] fact maybe in the Church of God it it
[11:47] clicks in the message I think we get a
[11:49] little bit more of that clicking right
[11:51] but in other Realms folks people just
[11:54] can't see it even if it's in plain sight
[11:56] so don't get too excited about the fact
[11:57] they don't see it it's okay because
[12:00] that's the way it goes sometimes but
[12:02] anyway we're talking about ham being
[12:05] that person um and so in the American
[12:09] Space Race the the first thing the first
[12:12] humanoid not human but humanoid they
[12:15] sent into space was named ham and he was
[12:17] a
[12:18] chimpanzee as you see by the picture now
[12:21] despite the
[12:22] resemblance he is not actually related
[12:24] to anyone in this room so I just want to
[12:27] make that clear that you understand and
[12:29] by resemblance I mean he's got an
[12:30] opposable thumb like the rest of us do
[12:33] cuz see how he's holding the paper so
[12:35] isn't it funny that as our space race
[12:38] takes off and remember this country was
[12:40] established by the Lord I mean it was it
[12:42] was it was the work of God that
[12:43] established this country outnumbered
[12:46] outgunned right we know that the Lord
[12:49] was present brother brandham even talked
[12:50] about when they were I think it was the
[12:52] Declaration of Independence when they
[12:53] were signing that they had a seat there
[12:55] for for for the Holy Ghost to be present
[12:57] with them for the Lord to be present
[12:59] they made a special seat so here they
[13:02] are in and showing ham as being the
[13:05] first one to take off and then um it was
[13:09] a man named Alan Shepard which to me is
[13:12] also so he's a man called Shephard uh
[13:14] this is him actually in the Space
[13:16] Capsule when he's getting ready to take
[13:17] off and it's going to be real important
[13:19] in just a few minutes because we're
[13:20] going to talk about how he's strapped in
[13:22] there um but Alan Shepard was the first
[13:24] one and then the last time we talked I
[13:26] didn't include it in this particular
[13:27] show because I wanted to focus a little
[13:28] bit on Mr Mr Shephard um was that
[13:31] brother Brandon had had talked about
[13:33] that John Glenn was the first astronaut
[13:35] into space and the difference between
[13:38] this gentleman Alan Shepard and John
[13:40] Glenn's flight was that Alan Shepard
[13:42] basically shot up in the air he kind of
[13:45] went across the earth a little ways and
[13:46] then came back down um John Glenn when
[13:50] he was shot into space he actually
[13:51] orbited the Earth three times and then
[13:53] came back down so he got a little bit
[13:55] higher had a had actually a view of the
[13:57] earth got to see something
[13:59] uh came back down this gentleman was so
[14:01] strapped in that he didn't see much of
[14:03] anything on the way so anyway if you
[14:06] kind of I just want to give these this
[14:08] information I don't want to go deep into
[14:10] that because we just don't have time for
[14:11] it but I just wanted to kind of
[14:12] establish that this is where we're at so
[14:16] we see that um there's a history that
[14:19] that is tied to the Space Race and it
[14:21] it's all the way through the the first
[14:23] astronaut in space or Cosmonaut was a
[14:25] Russian who was a farmer and Noah was a
[14:27] farmer his name was farmer um so it just
[14:31] all ties together so anyway we won't go
[14:32] that deep into that but what I want to
[14:35] talk to you about tonight is something
[14:36] that happens to astronauts when they get
[14:38] into
[14:39] space and what it is is called the
[14:42] overview
[14:44] effect and we might call it something
[14:46] like the big picture effect so we've
[14:49] heard the saying you can't see the
[14:50] forest for the trees right you can't you
[14:52] can't get far enough back because you're
[14:54] just in the midst of the trees you can't
[14:55] see the forest so it's the big picture
[14:58] effect and so there's something that
[15:00] happens to the Natural astronaut when
[15:01] they get up into space um and it's it's
[15:04] a very interesting thing that happens to
[15:07] them and they become almost
[15:10] overwhelmed um with what it's like to
[15:14] see Earth and the interesting thing
[15:16] about it is the effect doesn't actually
[15:18] happen when they get out there and see
[15:19] maybe the vastness of space in fact if
[15:22] you'll remember brother brandom talked
[15:23] about a man who got out there and he
[15:24] said well I didn't see God so therefore
[15:26] there must not be a God and it's
[15:29] interesting to me that when we have a
[15:30] preconceived notion about something so
[15:32] the gentleman obviously had an idea in
[15:34] his head hey this is what it's going to
[15:36] be when I get out into space God's going
[15:38] to be there I'm going to see him he's
[15:40] going to be some being floating in space
[15:42] for some reason I'm going to know he's
[15:43] there so we've got this whole universe
[15:46] you've got you know bazillion Stars I
[15:49] don't know how many but it's in the
[15:50] billions or without number right I I
[15:53] wouldn't know how to count them um I'm
[15:56] sure the Lord knows the number but he
[15:57] hasn't shared it unless he shared it
[15:58] with you let me know cuz I would love to
[16:00] know that number uh that would be
[16:02] interesting to find out but they get out
[16:05] there and and they can see the vastness
[16:07] of space they can see they even know how
[16:09] it's expanding they they see all these
[16:10] different things and yet it never
[16:12] catches on but what happened when they
[16:15] would turn back and look back at the
[16:17] Earth is when the overview effect
[16:19] actually took place and so when they
[16:22] would see that they would actually be
[16:25] overwhelmed almost by the emotion of it
[16:28] and there would be things that that took
[16:31] place and they had a man that his name
[16:33] is Frank White that actually I guess
[16:35] wrote a book I haven't read the book by
[16:36] the way but he wrote a book about this
[16:38] particular effect because he's talking
[16:39] to these astronauts and they're all
[16:40] telling him the same thing when I when I
[16:43] got into space there was this when I saw
[16:45] the Earth and it's Mother Earth and they
[16:48] realize you know what's there and they
[16:50] had this connection to it they all have
[16:52] these different feelings about it so I'm
[16:54] just going to read some quotes of of
[16:55] what they
[16:57] said um next if you would so the first
[17:01] one it says you see how diminutive your
[17:02] life and concerns are compared to other
[17:04] things in the universe the result is you
[17:07] enjoy the life that is before you it
[17:08] allows you to have inner
[17:10] peace it was something that I have not
[17:13] got the vocabulary I haven't got the
[17:14] words to say perfection wouldn't touch
[17:16] it superb wouldn't even touch it nowhere
[17:18] it was something that I never you just
[17:20] have to be there it sort of reduces
[17:23] things to a size that you think
[17:24] everything is manageable all all these
[17:27] things that seem big and impossible
[17:29] we can do World Peace no
[17:33] problem so isn't that funny that you you
[17:37] get out into space and you're just
[17:38] looking back at Earth and it's such an a
[17:41] human experience that suddenly The
[17:44] Impossible becomes possible so that's a
[17:47] good thought right The Impossible
[17:48] becomes
[17:50] possible it's
[17:52] extraordinary the most profound
[17:54] experience I can imagine it's so much
[17:56] larger than
[17:57] me I wish there was some way I could
[17:59] explain it to you there are no words I
[18:01] couldn't find it it's not found anywhere
[18:04] then it says so I knew exactly what I
[18:05] was going to see but there was no way
[18:07] you can be prepared for the emotional
[18:09] impact it brought tears to my eyes I
[18:12] didn't feel like a giant I felt very
[18:15] very
[18:16] small somehow you feel a part of
[18:18] something bigger and that fills me with
[18:21] hope and I didn't include their whole
[18:23] thing but I just wanted to give you an
[18:24] idea of what this is so what they say is
[18:27] they have an overwhelming feeling of UN
[18:29] when they get up high enough when they
[18:32] can look back and they they see
[18:33] themselves as a part of something bigger
[18:35] than themselves and they start to see
[18:38] their connection to that Earth and they
[18:42] see the you know they they realize that
[18:44] everything that matters to them is there
[18:46] that that's where life is that that's
[18:49] where important things are that the
[18:52] interesting thing that happens is
[18:54] politics don't really matter anymore
[18:56] religion doesn't really matter any
[18:58] anymore the things that divide people
[19:01] don't really matter anymore and they
[19:02] start to think what can I do to fix
[19:04] things when I get back to Earth how can
[19:06] I make this life on Earth better in
[19:08] other words what is there out there that
[19:10] I can do that that I can do something so
[19:13] if you just go to the next one Psalms
[19:14] 1331 it says this behold how good and
[19:17] how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell
[19:19] together in unity and I thought you know
[19:22] the word already had these answers a
[19:23] long ago so starting a long time ago and
[19:27] we could go through and you could search
[19:28] all kinds of scriptures and we just
[19:29] don't have time for it this evening but
[19:33] Unity was something that God always
[19:35] wanted and here it is man be able starts
[19:37] to to connect himself to something
[19:40] Beyond himself right because this is a
[19:42] view that very few people see I mean
[19:45] very few people are privileged to see
[19:47] that view of Earth some five 500 and
[19:50] some they they say over 600 but many
[19:53] have been multiple times up into space
[19:55] so so somewhere around 600 people have
[19:58] had this opportunity to to witness this
[20:00] particular thing and almost all of them
[20:03] come back with a
[20:05] similar uh basically feeling about what
[20:08] it is that they see and so I'm thinking
[20:10] about that and I thought you know that's
[20:12] the Lord had had already written about
[20:14] this and had been talking about it and
[20:16] so when when we realized that Jesus
[20:18] Christ came on the scene he he started
[20:21] the overview effect right away because
[20:24] he's introducing something that's brand
[20:26] new because remember in the old test
[20:28] what was what was the thing that
[20:30] everybody loved you wrong me I'm paying
[20:34] you back right you rob from me I'm
[20:37] robbing from you it was an eye for an
[20:38] eye and it was a tooth for a tooth right
[20:41] so if you did something there's going to
[20:43] be payback if if you know somebody
[20:46] killed killed my my family member I'm
[20:49] killing your family member it's kind of
[20:50] like the the mafia if you kill my family
[20:52] member I'm killing your family me you
[20:54] and every other family member that's
[20:55] with you because that's the way it was
[20:58] and and it was a very it when you look
[21:00] at the law it was it was a fairly harsh
[21:02] thing because you you had to have
[21:05] something to guide the people because if
[21:06] you didn't guide them when they got
[21:08] under the wrong Spirit what happened
[21:10] right so you had to have something a way
[21:13] to guide them and so that's why the law
[21:14] was in place but in Luke chapter 6 we're
[21:18] starting when when Christ comes he
[21:20] starts with this whole New Concept that
[21:23] comes out so the 27th verse of Luke 6 it
[21:25] says this but I say unto you which here
[21:29] love your enemies do good to them which
[21:31] hate you well that's a concept right
[21:35] we'd have to consider that one pretty
[21:37] hard if we were living under a law where
[21:40] it said hey eye for eye for tooth for
[21:42] tooth you know I I need to get something
[21:45] but here the Lord is actually
[21:47] introducing them to what these people
[21:49] are experiencing out in space this is an
[21:52] overview effect because the effect of
[21:55] the word is to change you into something
[21:58] just like the effect of looking back at
[22:00] the Earth has changed these people
[22:02] almost all of them say have been changed
[22:04] forever if you if you ask the astronaut
[22:07] that's seen these things and has been
[22:08] affected by it they've been changed
[22:11] forever so reading on the scripture
[22:14] bless them that curse you and pray for
[22:16] them which despitefully use you and unto
[22:18] him that smiteth thee on the One Cheek
[22:20] offer also the other and him that taketh
[22:22] away thy cloak forbid not to take thy
[22:24] coat also give to every man that Ask Of
[22:27] Thee and of him that taketh the way thy
[22:28] Goods ask them not again and as you
[22:31] would that men should do to you do ye
[22:33] also to them likewise for if you love
[22:36] them which love you what thank have you
[22:38] for Sinners also Lo love those that love
[22:41] them and if you do good to them which do
[22:43] good to you what thank have you for
[22:44] Sinners also do even the same and if you
[22:47] lend to them of whom you hope to receive
[22:49] what think have you for Sinners also
[22:51] lend to Sinners to receive as much
[22:54] again but love your love you your
[22:57] enemies and do good and lend hoping for
[22:59] nothing again and your reward shall be
[23:00] great and you shall be the children of
[23:02] the highest for he is kind unto the
[23:04] unthankful and to the evil be ye
[23:07] therefore merciful as your father also
[23:09] is merciful judge not and you shall not
[23:11] be judged condemn not you shall not be
[23:13] condemned forgive and you shall be
[23:14] forgiven given it shall be given unto
[23:17] you good measure pressed down and shaken
[23:18] together and running over shall men give
[23:20] into your bosom for with the same
[23:22] measure that you meet with all it shall
[23:23] be measured to you again so I I'm I'm
[23:26] thinking of these here's these
[23:29] astronauts and they're so moved by just
[23:31] seeing Earth and and then I'm thinking
[23:35] about the word of God and I can see
[23:37] where Christ has already prepared us for
[23:40] this and hidden it basically in plain
[23:43] sight and maybe we're not even aware
[23:46] that he's making this good measure for
[23:49] us in other words he's making this
[23:51] preparation for us by placing the word
[23:53] and then not only does he place the word
[23:55] in place for us but he follows up with
[23:57] the Holy Ghost to allow us to come into
[24:01] an image of that same thing that he's
[24:03] talking about so it's not hey you have
[24:05] to do this it's hey here's what you need
[24:08] to do and to make sure that you can I'm
[24:11] going to give you the power I'm going to
[24:13] give you the mobility or in other words
[24:15] I'm going to give you the that that
[24:17] spaceship I'm going to give you the
[24:18] capability to get you there and I'm
[24:22] going to make sure that you're able to
[24:24] get to this point and you don't have to
[24:27] rely on yourself you don't have to do
[24:28] this thing yourself I am the one that's
[24:31] going to take you to this level so I'm
[24:34] going to make sure and and so he places
[24:36] in his word cuz this is tough I mean I
[24:40] don't know about you so I'll just use my
[24:43] own confession it's not the easiest
[24:45] thing humanly to love your
[24:48] enemies
[24:50] right you can you can look sometimes
[24:52] it's your sometimes it's family members
[24:55] that you know they just know how to get
[24:57] maybe under your skin
[25:00] right sometimes it's co-workers they
[25:01] just know like you know they work with
[25:03] you enough they figure you out one of
[25:06] the things in the fire service just so
[25:07] you know it one of the things that you
[25:09] never do is tell them a weakness so if
[25:11] you have a fear of snakes never tell
[25:13] anybody because if you do guess what you
[25:15] will find everywhere every day snakes if
[25:18] you have a fear of spiders tell no one
[25:21] because every day whenever you can or
[25:24] whenever they can you will see
[25:26] spiders if you have a fear of of people
[25:28] popping out in you know odd places
[25:31] people will pop out in odd places so and
[25:33] right because they once somebody
[25:35] recognizes a weakness they kind of go
[25:37] after it and one of the things that
[25:39] interesting is and I don't want to get
[25:41] into personality types or anything like
[25:42] that but you'll find people that um I I
[25:46] guess in science they call it passive
[25:48] aggressive but you know they will put
[25:50] digs in but they don't come out and
[25:52] really say it blunt to your face right
[25:55] they'll they'll do it kind of as as a
[25:57] behind the
[25:59] kind of as a controlling thing to kind
[26:01] of push you a certain way and control
[26:03] you a certain way and and they'll do it
[26:05] as a dig and the the thought here is
[26:09] that if that's happening in the church
[26:12] well we've got a problem right but
[26:15] fortunately the Lord's given us a way to
[26:17] fix that problem because if let's say
[26:20] let's say we're dealing with it in the
[26:22] church let's say we have an issue that's
[26:23] going on and or or some church not
[26:25] necessarily the church body here but I'm
[26:27] just saying somewhere you've been to
[26:28] church right and there's some kind of
[26:30] issue that's come up and somebody's put
[26:32] you down or put you into a category or
[26:34] or tried to control you by some way
[26:36] whatever that person was whatever if
[26:38] they were in leadership or they weren't
[26:39] in leadership they were just somebody in
[26:41] the congregation could have been
[26:42] somebody related to whatever that
[26:44] particular thing is if they're trying to
[26:47] control you and they're in church I I
[26:50] can tell you what the problem is they
[26:52] haven't gotten high enough yeah amen
[26:55] that's the problem you just haven't
[26:56] gotten you you haven't gotten enough of
[26:59] that so you you have to be in the ship
[27:01] and the ship's got to take you High
[27:03] Enough and then there's something else
[27:04] that has to happen too you have to be
[27:06] willing to look back and have a
[27:08] connection with what that is so in other
[27:12] words if if you get up high enough so
[27:15] this was the thing that happened with
[27:16] with the astronauts when they got up
[27:17] high enough that effect like I said
[27:20] earlier didn't take a didn't didn't
[27:22] happened to them until actually they
[27:23] were looking back and found a connection
[27:25] with what they were seeing amen until
[27:28] they did that until they actually made a
[27:30] connection to something that we see they
[27:32] were seeing nothing really happened
[27:34] they're like oh this is great you know
[27:36] hey I made it I'm an astronaut this is
[27:38] I'm really cool kids are going to love
[27:39] me when I land back on the earth it's
[27:42] going to be an amazing time everything's
[27:44] going to be special but they never had
[27:46] that unifying feeling they didn't have
[27:49] that kind of thing that happened to them
[27:52] and that's kind of the same thing in the
[27:53] word of God unless and and we we talk
[27:56] about it this way they they'll say you
[27:57] have to know who you are and that's
[28:00] really good you do have to know who you
[28:02] are and you have to know what your
[28:03] relationship is to the Lord right but in
[28:07] that same thing you have to know what
[28:08] you are as well because if you know you
[28:12] know I I know who I am but I don't know
[28:14] what my role is right I I've got a sense
[28:17] of who I am but if I I I don't
[28:19] understand what it is that the Lord's
[28:21] looking for or requiring from me then
[28:23] there's something that that I need and I
[28:26] I need to get I need to take a better
[28:28] look at what it is that's coming or what
[28:31] it is that's happening or what it is
[28:33] what's my connection to this place
[28:35] what's my connection to heaven how do I
[28:37] get there what what is it that makes me
[28:39] drawn towards that thing and to be
[28:42] willing to to look completely and
[28:44] establish that relationship with it and
[28:47] understand that there is a relationship
[28:49] there and and a lot of times the barrier
[28:52] to the relationship is is ourselves we
[28:54] look in the mirror there's the barrier
[28:56] we find it you know the the our we're
[28:58] enemy sometimes is ourselves and that's
[29:00] what we're looking
[29:01] at Galatians the 6th chapter and the
[29:04] 10th verse says this if we have as we
[29:07] have therefore opportunity let us do
[29:08] good unto all men especially unto them
[29:09] who are of the household of faith I was
[29:11] telling the Saints up in Cottonwood I
[29:13] said this was an interesting thing for
[29:15] me I I used to work in construction um a
[29:18] long time ago and uh some of the
[29:20] brothers at the church we when we would
[29:22] need something done you'd ask another
[29:24] brother and we found out something that
[29:26] was very interesting
[29:28] uh you would ask somebody to do
[29:30] something and suddenly the price went up
[29:32] if they were a brother in the church
[29:35] compared to the siners so we we we came
[29:37] up with the saying just give me the
[29:38] sinner deal because the sinner deal was
[29:41] better than the brother deal because and
[29:44] I'm not sure why I mean at least it
[29:46] seemed that way so it might have been
[29:47] just my perception and others perception
[29:49] around me but anyway it became a saying
[29:51] just give me the center deal because the
[29:53] center deal was better usually because
[29:56] that Center deal was competition right
[29:58] you had to go out and and and win the
[30:00] competition but if you're in church it's
[30:02] like captive audience they're not
[30:05] certainly going to go get some sinner to
[30:07] to sell this thing to them I'll sell it
[30:08] to them and it again that was our my
[30:11] perception might be false but it I just
[30:13] wanted to let you know that that's how
[30:14] it was and and sometimes I find in
[30:17] church what we're able to do is we treat
[30:19] Sinners pretty well most most believers
[30:22] do a pretty good job of that but in the
[30:25] church it's a little bit harder for some
[30:28] reason following what Galatians says
[30:31] here is something that's just a little
[30:33] bit harder to do and the reality is we
[30:36] just need to get a little bit higher and
[30:38] we just need to take a better look
[30:39] that's all because when we get a better
[30:41] look and we realize our place in God and
[30:43] what we're to be in God that'll happen
[30:46] and by the same token Saints if you're
[30:48] there and somebody else isn't just
[30:50] remember all they need to do is get a
[30:52] little bit higher just remember the
[30:54] saying it's nothing that the Holy Ghost
[30:55] can't cure right it's nothing that the
[30:58] Holy Ghost can't cure so sometimes we
[31:00] want to cure it ourselves we want to fix
[31:02] the problem we want to fix that person
[31:04] and sometimes prayer is the best way to
[31:06] fix it because sometimes you can't you
[31:09] know you find out with your kids when
[31:10] they go astray sometimes you just can't
[31:12] fix them you know it takes it takes the
[31:14] Holy Ghost to be involved to to do
[31:16] something for you something
[31:19] different James the thir chapter and
[31:21] we're going to read 13th verse and the
[31:23] 17th and 18th verse and I'm sorry I'm
[31:24] moving fast but I want to finish in a
[31:26] reasonable time tonight
[31:28] the word says this on the 13th chapter
[31:30] who is a wise man and endued with
[31:31] knowledge among you let him show out of
[31:33] a good conversation his works with
[31:34] meekness of wisdom but the wisdom that
[31:37] is from above is first pure then
[31:38] Peaceable gentle and easy to be
[31:40] entreated full of mercy and good fruits
[31:42] without partiality and without hypocrisy
[31:45] and the fruit of righteousness is swn in
[31:47] peace of them that make
[31:49] peace so all I'm doing here is I just
[31:51] wanted to read a few scriptures we're
[31:52] going to go on to Colossians to save
[31:54] time third chapter in the 10th through
[31:56] the 17th verse
[31:58] and it says and have put on the new man
[32:00] which is renewed in knowledge after the
[32:02] image of him that created him for there
[32:04] is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision or
[32:06] uncircumcision Barbarian cyan Bond nor
[32:08] free but Christ is all and in all put on
[32:11] therefore as the elect of God holy and
[32:13] beloved bowels of mercies kindness
[32:14] humbleness of Mind meekness and
[32:17] longsuffering forbearing one another and
[32:20] forgiving one another If any man have a
[32:22] quarrel against any even as Christ
[32:23] forgave you so also do ye and above all
[32:27] these things put on charity which is the
[32:29] bond of perfectness and let the peace of
[32:31] God rule in your hearts to the which
[32:33] also you are called in one body and it
[32:36] says and be ye
[32:37] thankful let the word of Christ dwell in
[32:40] you richly in all wisdom teaching and AD
[32:42] teaching and admonishing one another in
[32:44] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[32:46] singing with Grace in your hearts to the
[32:48] Lord and whatsoever you do in word or In
[32:50] Deed do all in the name of the Lord
[32:52] giving thanks to God and the father by
[32:55] him so all these scriptures that we're
[32:57] reading are just the Lord's way of
[33:00] letting us know hey there's an overview
[33:02] effect in other words there's a big
[33:04] picture right I maybe big pictures is
[33:07] something that we would understand
[33:08] better than overview so an overview is
[33:11] just I'm looking over the audience right
[33:13] now so I I have a good view of like
[33:15] everybody and if you're sitting back in
[33:16] the corner you might not have a view of
[33:18] the girls that are over here you know
[33:20] depending on where you're sitting there
[33:21] may be things in your way but an
[33:22] overview allows me to see everything all
[33:24] at once and the scripture is an all-
[33:27] encompass in scripture so everything we
[33:30] need as far as the word of God goes is
[33:33] written in the word for us and then
[33:35] everything that needed to to be revealed
[33:38] through a prophet was revealed for us so
[33:40] we don't have to ring our hands and
[33:44] worry about it or have have
[33:47] discouragement about it everything
[33:48] that's necessary for you was already
[33:51] there so let's go back to Alan Shepard
[33:54] for a minute you don't have to go back
[33:55] to the picture but so Alan Shepherd to
[33:58] me I I I read about him and he kind of
[34:00] reminded me of my dad he was kind of uh
[34:03] uh and I I don't know so I should be
[34:06] since this goes out on the internet I
[34:07] should be careful uh because I don't
[34:10] know the man but from what I read he
[34:12] just reminded me of of my father um and
[34:14] my dad was uh a person that um you would
[34:19] never see cry uh he was a very um stoic
[34:23] person a very matter of fact uh he he
[34:27] was a very what you would call a man's
[34:29] man I guess I don't know he he was not
[34:32] what do they call it now metrosexual he
[34:33] wasn't that way at all he was he was
[34:35] from an era where you know the men were
[34:38] men and the women were women and and
[34:40] that was the way it was and that's kind
[34:42] of what this man reminded me of so when
[34:45] they sent alen Shepard into space one of
[34:48] the things that that was going on and
[34:51] why they strapped him in so tightly is
[34:52] because they were so fearful of what
[34:54] might happen to him when he got out
[34:56] there there was a lot of anxiety because
[34:59] it was trepidation they weren't sure
[35:00] about it what's going to happen to this
[35:02] man we need to make sure that that he's
[35:04] prepared for this flight and so they if
[35:07] you when you saw that picture and you
[35:08] can go back to it if you want brother
[35:10] John but he's he's very compacted and
[35:14] very strapped in and very unable to
[35:17] move and I thought about this because he
[35:20] was so strapped in he pretty much didn't
[35:22] see anything except for the inside of
[35:23] the spaceship they had a window for him
[35:27] but he couldn't even like lift his head
[35:29] to like change the view or whatever cuz
[35:31] he was so strapped in and I thought you
[35:33] know isn't it amazing that when people
[35:36] have fear or anxiety or trepidation
[35:39] about something it traps them and you
[35:43] get so trapped in in that fear or
[35:46] anxiety or trepidation and it could be
[35:48] other things too and sorry for the kids
[35:51] if you don't know trepidation but it's
[35:53] basically fear on another level so um it
[35:57] it's it when you have those kind of
[36:00] things happen in your life it's just
[36:02] like this man he went into space but he
[36:05] couldn't see
[36:07] anything and so the interesting thing
[36:09] about Allan Shepard was when he he got
[36:12] out into
[36:13] space um he uh ended up going back and
[36:17] and being a person that walked on the
[36:18] moon in fact for the golfers and I don't
[36:20] know if anybody's a golfer he actually
[36:22] played golf on the moon so he he took
[36:24] and whacked a golf ball and I don't know
[36:26] how far it went he thought it went
[36:27] forever and they they figured out how
[36:29] far and it didn't go forever but anyway
[36:32] he got to play golf on the moon but one
[36:34] of the interesting things about him was
[36:37] that they asked him you know hey what
[36:39] about your your trip into you know space
[36:42] you know were you expecting to to have
[36:45] you know anything happen when you got
[36:47] out there on the moon like you know when
[36:49] you looked back at Earth what what did
[36:51] you were you expecting to to you know
[36:53] have any kind of reaction and he said
[36:55] you know before I left if theya said hey
[36:58] you know are you going to like have a
[37:00] real emotional response are you going to
[37:02] you know is something big going to
[37:04] happen to you when you get out there and
[37:06] he's he's like I would say no there's
[37:08] nothing's going to happen but Alan
[37:11] Shepard gets out on the moon and when he
[37:14] turns around to see Earth he said he
[37:17] just started crying so I thought that'd
[37:20] be to me it's like if you can imagine
[37:22] the most stoic person that you know and
[37:24] you put him in that situation and all of
[37:26] a sudden
[37:28] they're hit by this flood of emotion and
[37:30] to me that's like Christ when he comes
[37:33] to you you might be the most stoic
[37:35] person in this building but I can tell
[37:37] you if the Holy Ghost moves on you you
[37:38] can cry like a baby and it's okay men
[37:41] it's okay and women it's okay too and
[37:43] kids it's okay as well because that's
[37:46] something that's perfectly fine you know
[37:49] I I'm going to interject this I wasn't
[37:51] planning on it but I'm going to anyway
[37:52] so many many years ago I won't tell you
[37:56] how many decades cuz it had aged me and
[37:57] I'm aged enough already so uh but many
[38:01] many years ago there was a young girl a
[38:03] sister in a church and uh she was
[38:07] probably your girl's age maybe right in
[38:09] that that range but she uh started
[38:12] praying for the Holy Ghost and I can
[38:15] tell you that so um we used to attend
[38:18] the church and then we we um had moved
[38:20] away for a while and came back and so in
[38:23] between that time um this young girl had
[38:26] sought the Holy Ghost
[38:28] and um she'd been pretty much the only
[38:31] one as far as I know in the church at
[38:32] the time seeking the Holy Ghost and when
[38:34] the Holy Ghost fell it didn't just
[38:36] change her the whole church changed and
[38:40] when when we came back and you ever hear
[38:44] Brother brand talk about a Canadian
[38:45] church so it's a little bit starchy
[38:49] right so there was a little bit of that
[38:51] um and some of you might know the story
[38:54] but when you came back you pretty much
[38:56] had to look like get the address on the
[38:58] building and make sure that was this the
[39:00] right building am I in the right because
[39:02] brother sister it changed the church and
[39:05] that's what the Holy Ghost will do it
[39:06] didn't it didn't it wasn't that effect
[39:09] didn't just happen to one person I mean
[39:12] it was the whole building and not not
[39:15] overnight but pretty soon that whole
[39:18] church changed to where you wouldn't
[39:20] know that it was a Canadian starie
[39:21] church it was Pentecostal as Pentecostal
[39:24] could be and Pentecostal is not a bad
[39:26] word it's not a cuss word if anybody
[39:28] worries about that because Pentecost was
[39:31] an experience right it's not speaking in
[39:34] tongues that's what some people labeled
[39:36] it that's okay but it wasn't that it was
[39:39] something that completely changed people
[39:42] changed their perspective it changed
[39:44] their view it changed the way that they
[39:46] were relating to each other it changed
[39:48] how the church was moving and I I'm not
[39:51] saying that you need to to be like that
[39:53] but what I am saying is when the Holy
[39:55] Ghost comes in expects something to
[39:57] happen am and if it comes in and it's
[39:59] not you but it comes to somebody else
[40:01] you better get ready because it's going
[40:03] to move on you too and it's a good thing
[40:07] because that's what you need is the
[40:08] power of the Holy Ghost to do something
[40:10] for you that's what's going to change
[40:12] you and so just like Alan Shepard where
[40:15] he's he's someone that isn't emotional
[40:17] he's not really gripped by things he he
[40:19] was a very to me a little bit hard kind
[40:22] of person but yet it changed him and it
[40:27] it it gave him a whole different world
[40:29] view than he'd ever had before so I just
[40:32] thought that was an interesting thing um
[40:35] if you could bring up the next
[40:37] slide so I just want to show you this
[40:39] are just some things that are out in
[40:41] space there are several uh space
[40:43] telescopes that are up there and they're
[40:44] giving us pictures so uh again I'm not a
[40:47] scientist I'm not advocating that
[40:49] anybody becomes a scientist or that you
[40:51] become a natural astronaut and trying to
[40:53] get out to see one of these things um
[40:56] but this is a what they call NGC
[40:59] 33324 which is a star forming region in
[41:01] the kry nebula which all I know is they
[41:04] say it's Interstellar dust and gas that
[41:06] makes that look like that so I'm going
[41:09] to tell you why I'm doing this in just a
[41:10] second so go to the next slide please so
[41:12] this is what they call a cartwheel
[41:14] Galaxy something that you can see out in
[41:17] space to me they they're amazing
[41:19] pictures if you can go to the next one
[41:21] please this is called Proxima centuri
[41:24] the closest star to Earth
[41:28] and then the last one if you would they
[41:29] in the next slide this is called the
[41:31] star Zeta ofi and I don't even know if
[41:35] I'm stay in that right but I hope it's
[41:37] close so and the reason I'm showing you
[41:40] these things is one it's it's an amazing
[41:42] thing to see what's out in space but if
[41:44] you could go back one picture I think it
[41:47] is yeah so this particular picture was
[41:51] taken off the internet it was labeled as
[41:53] proximus centor but I just want to let
[41:56] you know do you know what this might be
[41:57] anybody have a guess some of you now the
[41:59] people that have seen the news I don't
[42:01] want don't want you to tell me anybody
[42:04] guess that hasn't seen the
[42:07] news so proximus and Tori if you take
[42:10] the p and the C it's a basically a
[42:13] picture of pork
[42:17] chiso so a scientist decided to I don't
[42:22] troll does that make the kids that know
[42:24] what troll is that make fun of people
[42:26] basically is that what it is trolling so
[42:29] he decided to to troll his followers
[42:32] while you would do this I have no idea
[42:35] and he took a picture of cheso I don't
[42:37] know if it was pork I just assume pork
[42:39] cheso it could have been beef cheso I
[42:40] don't know could have been vegetable
[42:41] cheso I don't know but it was a picture
[42:43] of teso and so he took this picture and
[42:47] put it out on the internet so I'm doing
[42:48] this for two reasons one so you'll wake
[42:50] up for the finish of the sermon uh and
[42:52] and two to just and this is part of
[42:54] adults eat free tonight so
[42:57] right so and it's not that you're
[42:59] getting pork Cho it is the fact that
[43:03] everything on the internet is not
[43:04] necessarily true so you can have
[43:07] scientists that put things out on the
[43:09] internet and just because they put it
[43:10] out on the internet doesn't necessarily
[43:12] make it so so we can look at pictures
[43:15] that they send back and and it's lovely
[43:17] to see I think it's very interesting to
[43:18] see but my faith isn't in the internet
[43:21] or the pictures that they show or any of
[43:23] those other things our faith is in the
[43:24] word of God and you know and and just to
[43:29] to continue on with the idea of the
[43:31] overview effect and sorry about that I
[43:32] just wanted to to to show some people
[43:35] the pictures and I thought that was
[43:36] really interesting
[43:37] that I I why would you do that I mean I
[43:41] I don't know but anyway it was shocking
[43:43] to me that somebody would would go to to
[43:45] that length to make fun of other people
[43:49] um so with regard to to this and and the
[43:53] overview
[43:54] effect science and and and by the way
[43:57] and I'm sure brother Aaron is is
[43:59] listening tonight but I almost thought
[44:01] there was a disturbance in the message
[44:03] uh when he said science was right um
[44:06] because most of the time you'll never
[44:07] hear anybody say science is right but he
[44:09] also went on to explain how that science
[44:11] was and science observes what they can
[44:14] right so and they have to try and
[44:17] explain what they can by observation so
[44:20] um for maybe some of the young people
[44:22] I'm sure you're probably not confused
[44:24] about this but science uh
[44:27] um basically came up with an explanation
[44:30] of how everything happened and so their
[44:33] explanation was basically from something
[44:35] that was I don't have a pin but
[44:38] something that's about the size of the
[44:40] point of your if you look at your pens
[44:42] about the size of that there was a big
[44:44] bang and billions of stars started to
[44:47] form and planets came and all these
[44:49] different things happened and the
[44:50] universes continuing to expand because
[44:53] they needed something there it couldn't
[44:56] be nothing
[44:57] so there had to be something so somehow
[45:00] all this energy is built up into
[45:02] something that size and then boom it
[45:05] explodes the word of God instead says in
[45:07] the beginning God and that's what we
[45:11] know as having an effect so science has
[45:15] an idea right and I don't know what the
[45:17] chances or what the numbers are and I
[45:19] know somebody's figured it out I didn't
[45:21] look it up to to see what their their
[45:23] odds are but when Genesis talks about
[45:27] from How The Creation happened and it
[45:28] goes from one thing to another so it
[45:30] starts out with the you know the the
[45:32] water and the little things and then it
[45:33] gets bigger and then you've got you know
[45:35] you have fish and then you have birds
[45:36] and then you have you know Beasts of the
[45:39] field and then you have things that walk
[45:40] upright the the odds of of the Bible
[45:43] being correct on that for men that have
[45:46] written it thousands of years ago is
[45:49] astronomical that they would have how
[45:51] did they figure it out like where did
[45:53] they come but it was the word of God
[45:54] right so science in its own way was like
[45:58] well we've got to have an explanation so
[46:00] there had to been something there but
[46:02] yet for God it it wasn't necessary that
[46:04] anything be there there wasn't anything
[46:07] that had to be
[46:09] there so um go to the next slide if you
[46:11] wouldn't
[46:14] mind says this and the rejected King and
[46:17] I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me
[46:19] that was in the room said this is what
[46:21] you preached was the Holy Ghost this is
[46:23] perfect love and nothing can enter here
[46:26] without it it I am more determined than
[46:29] ever in my life that it takes perfect
[46:30] love to enter there there was no
[46:33] jealousy there was no tiredness there
[46:34] was no death sickness could never in
[46:37] there never in there mortality could
[46:40] could never make you old and they could
[46:42] not cry it was just one Joy so brother
[46:45] brandom is talking about he's relating a
[46:47] story about when he was at home and he
[46:50] was carried up are most of us familiar
[46:52] with the story most of us know it okay
[46:54] so brother Brandon was talking about a
[46:56] story
[46:57] of when he he was carried up um and he
[47:00] he he went and met the Saints and they
[47:02] were under the Altar and so uh he's in a
[47:06] different dimension now and he's went to
[47:08] see something there and I I got to
[47:11] thinking about that particular thing and
[47:13] you know we talk about the Holy Ghost
[47:15] and the Holy Ghost is a spaceship and
[47:16] the Holy Ghost takes us up but brother
[47:19] brandom went higher than
[47:22] anybody and he went up to a dimension
[47:25] that we haven't crossed over so we're
[47:26] still in this one and we're still in
[47:28] still dealing with that fourth dimension
[47:30] where we have all the issues and in fact
[47:32] just to mention this with the astronauts
[47:34] you know the the interesting thing about
[47:36] astronauts is even when Russia invaded
[47:38] Ukraine the astronauts that were on the
[47:40] space station were like we're
[47:42] astronauts they they weren't saying hey
[47:44] I'm a Russian astronaut or I'm an
[47:46] American astronaut I'm I'm an astronaut
[47:50] right and so they stayed unified in the
[47:53] fact that they were astronauts and I
[47:55] think that's a good lesson for for the
[47:57] church to learn it it's it's not the
[48:00] politics so the Republican Democrat
[48:02] independent doesn't matter what church
[48:04] group that you go to doesn't matter and
[48:06] that's why I appreciated brother Aaron
[48:08] preaching about local church versus true
[48:09] church and and what the the local church
[48:12] serves that true church and if we get a
[48:14] revelation of that we have an
[48:16] understanding of that then you know one
[48:18] Church politics goes away but then other
[48:21] politics does too because then you're
[48:22] not you're able to fellowship with
[48:24] Democrat or independent or libertarian
[48:26] or
[48:27] whatever you know at least to the point
[48:29] that you can agree right so you you can
[48:31] do those things and you're able to
[48:33] accomplish those things simply because
[48:35] that you have received something greater
[48:39] so um going back
[48:42] earlier and I just want to I threw these
[48:44] in here I wasn't trying to be tricky but
[48:47] I was trying to make a point so brother
[48:49] Brandon was actually two of the
[48:52] quotes cuz he was a spiritual astronaut
[48:54] to me and some of you probably might
[48:57] have recognized him or thought man
[48:58] that's really familiar I think I've
[48:59] heard that
[49:00] before so um one of the quotes it was
[49:04] it's on slide eight I believe it was
[49:06] something that I he says this it was
[49:07] something that I have not got the
[49:09] vocabulary I haven't got the words to
[49:11] say perfection wouldn't touch it superb
[49:14] wouldn't even touch it nowhere it was
[49:16] something I never you just have to be
[49:19] there so that's brother brandom's quote
[49:22] about when he gets up and sees something
[49:26] Beyond anything that he'd seen before
[49:29] and so he's coming back and saying Hey
[49:31] listen there's something out there
[49:33] that's more amazing than anything that
[49:36] I've ever seen and I don't know know so
[49:40] we see pictures where you know the
[49:42] Angels over ahead right we've got a
[49:44] picture of that he sees Visions all the
[49:47] time he sees things happen and yet he
[49:49] gets to this place that's again higher
[49:52] than somewhere he's ever been and then
[49:54] all of a sudden everybody's coming up to
[49:55] him our precious brother brother our
[49:57] precious brother and then he sees people
[49:58] that are like 90 something years old but
[50:00] yet they're 20s something years old now
[50:02] and the the Angels tell him hey this is
[50:05] this is one that you led to the Lord
[50:07] when she was 90 and here's this other
[50:09] one and and he the the feeling is
[50:12] overwhelming and he's got no way to
[50:14] describe it and to me that's just like
[50:16] these astronauts in the natural they're
[50:19] like how can I put into words what I'm
[50:20] seeing I don't know what it is what's
[50:22] going on here but yet you have a
[50:24] spiritual astronaut that's gone higher
[50:26] than something that we have right now
[50:29] and he's sending word back and saying
[50:31] you need to see this you need to
[50:33] experience what I'm experiencing because
[50:35] there's perfect Joy here there's there's
[50:37] amazing stuff here and this is something
[50:39] that you've got to connect to so the
[50:41] other one that was also brother brandom
[50:43] is I wish there was some way I could
[50:45] explain it to you there's no words I
[50:47] couldn't find it it's not found anywhere
[50:50] so the best thing we've got is the word
[50:52] of God because that's our best view and
[50:57] and and the message
[50:58] itself working with that word to to
[51:02] teach us and to help us to understand
[51:05] what's out there and how we can connect
[51:08] to that thing and how we can get a
[51:10] better view than we've ever had before
[51:13] so the petty differences that come up
[51:15] when we when we have somebody that's
[51:17] critical and you know this is a really
[51:18] tricky thing if you have somebody that's
[51:21] critical and you want to say something
[51:23] about it then you become critical so
[51:26] it's like a 22 how do how do I fix this
[51:29] but say something because they're
[51:30] critical because you don't want to be
[51:31] critical right uh but I I believe that
[51:34] the word can can teach us what to do in
[51:37] those situations so that we can offer
[51:41] correction not that we're trying to fix
[51:44] somebody but we can offer a correction
[51:46] in such a way that we're actually doing
[51:48] it out of love not just because they're
[51:50] so critical I can't stand them because
[51:52] that's a little different when it's I
[51:54] can't stand this critical person and
[51:56] therefore I'm going to fix this as
[51:58] opposed to this person is critical but I
[52:00] really want them to see that there's
[52:02] something higher and there's something
[52:04] greater and there's something deeper
[52:06] that they can they can come
[52:12] to so we're almost done don't
[52:16] worry I'm not going to hold you much
[52:24] longer so if you could go to the next um
[52:31] slide so this is a view one of the views
[52:34] of um from space of the
[52:36] earth and normally what the astronauts
[52:40] describe is seeing that you see the
[52:42] little red line that's there so what the
[52:45] astronauts describe is that's usually
[52:47] blue but I chose this particular picture
[52:49] for a
[52:50] reason so when they're looking back at
[52:53] Earth they see what's protecting them
[52:56] and it's basically a blue line and that
[52:58] blue line goes all the way around the
[53:01] world and it's basically a line that
[53:04] protects them from the vacuum of space
[53:06] so in the vacuum of space if you get out
[53:09] there and you didn't have some kind of
[53:10] protection like what they're wearing
[53:12] they're in a spaceship they have special
[53:13] suits if they go outside of the
[53:14] spaceship they're Tethered to the ship
[53:17] they have special things but that little
[53:20] line and some of them described it as
[53:22] like paper thin some of them described
[53:24] it as like thin like skin like it was
[53:28] just a a a very thin line and they
[53:31] realized that without that without that
[53:34] protection that there's certain
[53:37] death and the reason I chose this red
[53:40] line is
[53:42] because without the blood of Christ
[53:45] without a Scarlet
[53:47] thread without that as a protection
[53:51] there's no way that you're going to see
[53:52] the level that brother brandom saw
[53:55] that's right and you know he told the
[53:57] whole story and we won't go into it but
[53:59] just the end of the story is this that
[54:02] when when he started to condemn somebody
[54:04] and he started to have problems and he
[54:05] was going to Lord why don't you just
[54:07] wipe him off the face of the Earth then
[54:09] the Lord showed him that red line that's
[54:11] he showed him that Earth covered and
[54:14] said you're you're looking at the wrong
[54:17] thing and that changed him right so here
[54:20] he is on Earth and and now he's had this
[54:23] change because the Lord has showed him
[54:25] what kind of protection he was under it
[54:28] wasn't just who he was but it was what
[54:30] he was so what was his relationship to
[54:33] that that red thing it was that his
[54:36] relationship to the blood was when he
[54:38] sinned his sin went up and hit the blood
[54:41] and the blood took care of it and then
[54:44] he sinned again and his sin went up and
[54:46] it hit the blood and the blood took care
[54:47] of it and each time that something
[54:49] happened the blood took care of it and
[54:52] so much so that then he saw this image
[54:55] of when all his sins were in a book and
[54:57] those that book was taken and thrown
[54:59] into the sea of forgetfulness to be
[55:01] remembered no more and that to me this
[55:03] is so striking because here we are and
[55:06] we see Earth and it's got this Veil
[55:08] around it that protects it from from
[55:10] certain death but yet we've got a
[55:13] greater Veil that protects us a a a
[55:16] greater thread a a greater thing that
[55:18] protects us from that place and from
[55:20] that thing and I I you know there's an
[55:23] interesting thing and I heard this from
[55:25] another brother so I don't take credit
[55:26] for it but one of the things I I wanted
[55:28] to to kind of throw in here as we're
[55:30] about to wrap this up is that when you
[55:33] get out into space one of the things
[55:35] that you have to remember is that you
[55:37] have to stay Tethered to the
[55:40] ship you can't just go off on your own
[55:43] and you know the Bible actually deals
[55:44] with this because it talks about those
[55:46] that were once enlightened and they've
[55:48] tasted of the Heavenly gift and so they
[55:52] they've gotten something right they got
[55:54] up there somewhere and and then they get
[55:56] out there and then they're like oh I I
[55:58] don't need it anymore I don't like it
[55:59] anymore I don't want it anymore whatever
[56:01] the situation is they come to a place
[56:04] where they decide I don't need that and
[56:07] it's it's kind of like sometimes people
[56:10] get out of the well let me put it to you
[56:12] this way and it we find that the message
[56:16] um has developed some people that have
[56:18] some interesting doctrinal ideas and
[56:22] they don't they don't really come from
[56:23] the word or the message although they
[56:25] can take and kind of mix things together
[56:28] until it looks like it does and the
[56:31] interesting thing that I find is that
[56:33] you don't see a lot of of what we call
[56:35] maybe nominal church people doing that
[56:38] it's actually typically in the Realms of
[56:41] the message and you have to think well
[56:43] why is that why why would we do that and
[56:45] it's because they free they're free
[56:47] right you get out
[56:49] and look at what's what's the one
[56:52] experience that you've heard about
[56:52] people in space what do they get to do
[56:54] what are they wait weightless right if
[56:57] you get if if Alan Shephard got out of
[57:00] that that basically that thing that was
[57:02] holding him he gets out of the seat belt
[57:04] they float around so these space
[57:05] tourists that are going up right now
[57:07] they get up in there and guess what they
[57:08] get to do take off their seat belts and
[57:10] they float around in their Space Capsule
[57:12] and they get to see the Earth from that
[57:14] particular View and then they come back
[57:15] down and when we talked about the the
[57:18] inspiration for crew they got to
[57:19] actually orbit the earth so they're out
[57:21] of their things floating all over the
[57:22] place so freedom is awesome but you got
[57:25] to stay Tethered to the ship you know
[57:28] you've got to stay with the word and
[57:29] you've got to stay with the leadership
[57:30] of the Holy Ghost because once you start
[57:32] to lead yourself and once you you go
[57:35] that way that that Thin Red Line so I I
[57:39] don't look at like so the astronauts
[57:41] looked at the Earth like it was fragile
[57:43] I don't see Christ as fragile but what I
[57:46] do see as fragile sometimes is our
[57:48] relationship to him in other words the
[57:51] way that we view our relationship to the
[57:53] Lord and sometimes the way that we view
[57:55] our relationship to other people that's
[57:57] where the fragility comes in it's not
[57:59] that the blood is fragile the blood's
[58:01] able to forgive anything that it needs
[58:04] to the Bud's able to accomplish anything
[58:06] in your life that's necessary the
[58:08] blood's able to do that no matter what
[58:10] but the fragility comes sometimes in our
[58:12] relationship or our view of it because
[58:15] we get preconceived ideas we decide
[58:18] sometimes who's in and who's out and
[58:19] let's face it it happens right you'd be
[58:22] surprised sometimes like you see people
[58:24] look at we could look at in the B you
[58:27] know the the man of gadera who would
[58:29] think of us if you saw a guy that's out
[58:31] doing what he's doing that this guy is
[58:32] actually a
[58:34] Believer right because we have a
[58:36] preconceived idea that's why you need
[58:38] the Holy Ghost and the word to guide and
[58:40] that that way we're not fragile We're
[58:43] Not Fragile like that blue line that
[58:45] surrounds the Earth We're actually more
[58:46] than able to to overcome everything
[58:48] that's possible so we're able to do that
[58:57] so I want to read um we're going to be
[59:00] closing here shortly so um if the
[59:03] musician wants to come up and start
[59:04] playing that would be
[59:08] wonderful so with the the Advent of of
[59:12] this space travel and with what was
[59:15] happening they said that there's
[59:17] something that has happened um and it's
[59:20] it's become something of of a unifying
[59:24] cry if you want to say
[59:26] and it's called the whole Earth
[59:28] view and in this whole Earth view when
[59:31] you have a view of the whole earth
[59:33] that's when the political problems
[59:35] disappear that's when the barriers go
[59:37] away that's when the the problems
[59:39] between people go away when racial
[59:41] problems aren't an issue you don't have
[59:43] people thinking that I need to fix this
[59:45] or fix that and I I was thinking about
[59:49] that particular thing when they're
[59:50] talking about the whole Earth view and
[59:52] there they say this is the age so they
[59:54] they've introduced this idea that this
[59:56] is the age of the whole Earth view and I
[59:58] thought well that's perfect timing cuz
[1:00:00] this is the age of the whole word
[1:00:03] view this is the age when the word has
[1:00:05] opened and it's 100% if it was beyond
[1:00:09] 100% I I guess it would be that but it's
[1:00:12] completely open to the Bride of Jesus
[1:00:14] Christ and our relationship to that word
[1:00:19] through the Holy Ghost is able to carry
[1:00:21] us on to a amazing and amazing things
[1:00:26] and so it's just to me something that
[1:00:30] that's the most amazing thing could you
[1:00:31] go to the last slide
[1:00:33] brother and brother brandom says this in
[1:00:36] countdown it says what are they doing
[1:00:39] they are wrapped in Christ in rapturing
[1:00:42] Grace and brother and sister that's
[1:00:44] where we're at this is rapturing Grace
[1:00:47] and the thing that that can overwhelm us
[1:00:49] as far as that and I don't want to get
[1:00:52] on an emotional level but on a word
[1:00:53] level or on a faith level is that
[1:00:56] in rapturing Grace those different
[1:00:58] scriptures that we read through
[1:01:00] rapturing Grace you're able to
[1:01:01] accomplish all those things through
[1:01:03] rapturing Grace you're able to overcome
[1:01:05] all those things through rapturing Grace
[1:01:07] you're able to forgive you know the
[1:01:10] scripture says 490 times a day what a
[1:01:12] concept that
[1:01:13] is now it might feel like sometimes
[1:01:15] people can sin 490 times a day against
[1:01:18] you but I don't think anybody's everever
[1:01:19] achiev that yet but it's just something
[1:01:23] Ju Just so amazing so there
[1:01:26] wrapped in Christ go ahead and keep it
[1:01:28] up please sorry in rapturing Grace
[1:01:30] nothing they did themselves Christ took
[1:01:32] the uneducated the foolish things of the
[1:01:34] world wrapped his astronauts in it and
[1:01:37] empowered them with the Holy Ghost to
[1:01:38] take
[1:01:39] off brother sister that's where we're at
[1:01:42] today you're empowered with the Holy
[1:01:44] Ghost to take off and we started with a
[1:01:47] scripture where it said that things that
[1:01:49] are made of things that would do not
[1:01:51] appear and then we had that that quote
[1:01:53] that we read at the start from brother
[1:01:56] bandam and this is what I want you to
[1:01:58] get if you get nothing else from the
[1:01:59] sermon besides there's a red line
[1:02:01] covering you and there's a relationship
[1:02:04] to be had that'll give you a different
[1:02:06] view it'll give you a big picture view
[1:02:09] so it's not the issues dealing dealing
[1:02:11] at home or dealing with the neighbors or
[1:02:13] dealing with a problem in church or
[1:02:15] wherever those issues might be but it's
[1:02:17] a different view that'll be able to
[1:02:19] unite you to the word of God and in
[1:02:21] uniting you to the word it'll allow you
[1:02:22] to night in a Brotherhood and and not a
[1:02:25] Brotherhood of man where we're going to
[1:02:26] go off to Mars somewhere but a
[1:02:28] Brotherhood of man that's going to take
[1:02:29] us to the place where brother brandom
[1:02:31] talked about and told us about and saw
[1:02:35] and visited and saw those people and so
[1:02:39] the idea is this in your life maybe you
[1:02:42] don't see yourself where you should be
[1:02:45] maybe you feel like I need more and
[1:02:47] whatever that is I need more love we all
[1:02:49] need that right so that's an easy one
[1:02:51] maybe you need more
[1:02:53] peace you know sometimes you just some
[1:02:56] some people just can't settle like there
[1:02:59] there's something in you that just you
[1:03:01] know it you feel like every day there's
[1:03:03] just some you know something's wrong but
[1:03:07] God where there's nothing that appears
[1:03:10] has already placed in you what's
[1:03:14] necessary to make something that's not
[1:03:17] there appear so whatever you have need
[1:03:20] of today if that's if it's a the ability
[1:03:23] to just turn and look at Christ in a
[1:03:25] different way
[1:03:26] if it's an ability to see you know
[1:03:28] something that you haven't seen to to to
[1:03:31] just like those astronauts did when
[1:03:32] they're seeing the they're seeing Earth
[1:03:33] in a different way because before when
[1:03:36] they're on the earth you're seeing what
[1:03:37] you can see and you get up in a plane
[1:03:38] you can see a little bit more but now
[1:03:40] you can see the whole picture now you
[1:03:42] can see these relationships now you can
[1:03:44] see that hey these these Petty
[1:03:46] differences that we have World Peace
[1:03:48] isn't a problem we can fix this thing
[1:03:51] but naturally you can't but spiritually
[1:03:53] God has placed in you everything
[1:03:55] necessary just like the last time we
[1:03:57] talked remember silica's like in every
[1:03:59] phone that's in this building sand from
[1:04:01] a beach who would think that it would
[1:04:03] end up there everything that was
[1:04:05] necessary to build a spaceship in the
[1:04:06] earth so everything necessary for you is
[1:04:10] available and God will make those things
[1:04:12] appear out of things that today don't
[1:04:14] appear at all it may not appear and and
[1:04:18] and here's the other part of the thought
[1:04:20] it may not appear in the person that
[1:04:21] you're having the battle with they just
[1:04:23] need to get a little bit higher
[1:04:24] themselves they need to just get a
[1:04:26] little different view
[1:04:28] themselves you know they all all it
[1:04:30] takes is just a little bit bigger
[1:04:33] picture of what's going on and it'll
[1:04:35] lead you to everything that's necessary
[1:04:37] in Christ amen it's rapturing Grace
[1:04:40] Saints I pray God bathes Us in it cuz I
[1:04:44] don't know about you but I need it every
[1:04:46] day and I need it more and more every
[1:04:48] day why don't you stand with me
