[0:02] again the title Hallelujah it is
[0:04] finished we'll come to this towards the
[0:06] end and I think it'll be a real blessing
[0:08] to you this is
[0:10] um Lord willing and the Lord could
[0:12] always deal with my heart I just rely
[0:13] upon him he may lead me in a different
[0:15] direction to continue on this subject
[0:17] there's a lot in this subject to go to
[0:19] go through but it's been a long series
[0:21] that began with the goal of making
[0:23] Christ more personal to us and
[0:26] encouraging growth in the word of God
[0:28] through the last several Services we've
[0:30] kind of been dealing with the barriers
[0:32] to a believer's healing and how often
[0:34] those things relate to our mental
[0:36] approach to Healing so we dealt with
[0:38] chronic conditions of the heart and our
[0:41] vision kind of how we see things how we
[0:42] perceive things we dealt with
[0:44] forgiveness both in terms of forgiving
[0:46] other people but also asking for
[0:48] forgiveness and the role that plays in
[0:50] being sick and even the role that it
[0:52] plays in our healing and the last two
[0:54] services on phobia and pre-existing
[0:57] conditions we've been addressing wanting
[1:00] to get the fear out of our approach to
[1:02] Healing and fear out of approach to
[1:04] whether it be you know using something
[1:07] to help us to feel better or just even
[1:10] approaching God for our healing and one
[1:12] of the main things that we did in the
[1:14] outset through some of those Services
[1:15] the major leads to a minor and the minor
[1:18] and a major Tipping Point elevated Faith
[1:21] some of those things we are really look
[1:22] making the word the foundation so that
[1:25] in in everything that we do we realize
[1:27] God does it his initial and original way
[1:29] is by the word of God and we look to the
[1:31] word of God and we really want to focus
[1:33] on his promise in the word when we're
[1:35] seeking something and one thing we want
[1:38] you to remember as we finish this up
[1:40] that the purpose of physical healing is
[1:42] to point to the truth and reality of
[1:44] full Redemption but that's the that's
[1:46] the primary thing behind a physical
[1:49] healing a Divine Healing is it speaks of
[1:51] a new body that will never get sick and
[1:53] so those there's a cumulative effect of
[1:56] our faith uh being encouraged to take a
[1:59] deeper a deeper dive into the things of
[2:01] God and to grow and to be elevated so
[2:03] those are a lot of the things that we
[2:04] shared in the beginning and through
[2:06] several different parts is this is the
[2:08] 16th part so there's been a lot that
[2:09] we've covered and so today we're just
[2:11] wanting to look at a subject of praise
[2:13] and this belief in this conviction that
[2:16] it's finished according to the word of
[2:17] God if you'll take your Bibles and turn
[2:19] to First Corinthians chapter 6
[2:22] I think we've read maybe a portion of
[2:25] this already it's been in my notes the
[2:26] last three or four Services we may not
[2:28] have gotten to it but in First
[2:30] Corinthians chapter 6 verses 18 to 20
[2:32] just like to start this morning by
[2:35] identifying that God has this God has
[2:40] made this body fashion this body this
[2:42] body is the Lord's and so there's
[2:45] promises in the word that relate to our
[2:47] health and that it is it is a good
[2:49] desire to want to be well but then also
[2:52] how we have to keep that in balanced it
[2:54] says flea fornication every sin that a
[2:57] man doeth is without the body or it
[2:59] doesn't not just offend or it's not just
[3:01] the body itself but he that committeth
[3:03] fornication sinneth against his own body
[3:06] what know you not that your body is the
[3:09] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[3:12] which you have of God and you're not
[3:14] your own so again Paul is saying that
[3:17] when a man sins there's a consequence to
[3:20] the body and it's not just consequences
[3:22] l elsewhere but I may have phrased that
[3:24] wrong at the outset that's the
[3:25] consequence in other places it's not
[3:27] just a sin against God or just a sin
[3:29] against his conviction but it's also a
[3:31] sin against his body he that committeth
[3:33] fornication sinneth against his own body
[3:35] what know you not that your body is the
[3:38] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[3:40] the Holy Ghost is in you tabernacling
[3:42] the tabernacling deity which you have of
[3:46] God and so whether that's the holy ghost
[3:48] or the body both are true but you have
[3:51] this holy ghost from God you're templing
[3:52] it and ye are not your own he says don't
[3:55] you know this that you are not your own
[3:57] you've been bought with the price you've
[3:58] been purchased and so he's wanting you
[4:00] to think about your servitude to Christ
[4:03] your submission to God for you are
[4:05] bought with the price
[4:07] therefore glorify God in your body and
[4:10] in your spirit which are Gods so your
[4:13] spirit belongs to God your body belongs
[4:15] to God when your Tabernacle Holy Ghost
[4:17] that's in the soul and so if we were
[4:19] somehow to separate things out and say
[4:21] well the soul is sealed by the Holy
[4:22] Ghost then I have my spirit and my body
[4:24] we may think well the soul is owned by
[4:27] God but then these other two parts are
[4:29] kind of Freelancers or contractors but
[4:32] when you look at it you must realize the
[4:34] spirit and the body though not fully
[4:36] redeemed yet belong to God and so the
[4:40] body is the Lord's the body be in the
[4:42] Lords we should trust the Lord and honor
[4:44] the Lord in managing our health or
[4:47] looking out after our bodies and keeping
[4:49] it healthy and and even wanting to
[4:51] present ourselves the right way
[4:53] and Psalms 139 verses 13 and 14 I'll say
[4:57] this very quickly I've probably taken
[4:59] out more scriptures left out more
[5:02] scriptures than we're reading today on
[5:04] this subject because it's very very vast
[5:05] and very very deep for thou Hast
[5:08] possessed my Reigns thou has covered me
[5:11] in my mother's womb even that thought of
[5:13] possessing one's Reigns is very rich and
[5:16] very deep he said you've possessed me in
[5:19] that that seed of life you've possessed
[5:21] me even if some look at it the rains
[5:23] being delivered or the kidney or the
[5:24] innards and something you've possessed
[5:26] me there in that place and that Source
[5:28] you've covered me in my mother's womb it
[5:31] says I will praise thee from fearfully
[5:34] and wonderfully made fearfully that's
[5:37] fearfully made it speaks of even a
[5:39] delicate Arrangement how things are put
[5:41] together and you think about how
[5:42] intricate this body is and how it's
[5:44] woven together it says we are fearfully
[5:47] and wonderfully made marvelous are thy
[5:49] works and that my soul knoweth right
[5:51] well
[5:52] I wonderfully made it's this complexity
[5:54] that inspires all and anyone who studies
[5:57] the body and the biologist or
[5:59] nutritionist or medical doctors they
[6:02] really are in awe no matter how much
[6:04] they look at it and how much they can
[6:05] explain it and how much it makes sense
[6:07] there's this awe of the human body and
[6:10] how it works how intricate it is and how
[6:12] complex it is and how everything works
[6:14] together and all these different parts
[6:15] and their Arrangement it says
[6:17] wonderfully made which would be that all
[6:20] of How It's Made and then fearfully made
[6:22] because it's amazing how that this body
[6:24] how it's put together how delicate it is
[6:28] and how an injury just to one part can
[6:30] undo the whole and so you're fearfully
[6:33] and wonderfully made and this by God in
[6:36] Job chapter 10 verse 11 it says thou has
[6:38] clothed me with skin and flesh and
[6:41] fenced me with bones and sinews what a
[6:44] poetic way to describe the maker God
[6:47] himself he's clothed us it's by his
[6:49] design that he's clothed us with skin
[6:52] and muscle skin and flesh and has fenced
[6:54] us with bones and sinews it's describing
[6:57] the arrangement of the body that God is
[7:00] the designer of it that God when he
[7:02] brought man forth and he put that Spirit
[7:04] man into the flesh man the flesh man
[7:07] that he made he made it this complex he
[7:10] made it this way fearfully and
[7:12] wonderfully made this is something that
[7:13] God has done God has designed the human
[7:15] body he's arranged it and he's even
[7:17] watched over it as much as the devil has
[7:20] been trying to redesign and pervert
[7:22] things maybe I'll give just a little bit
[7:24] of a glimpse maybe this is a test here
[7:26] my title for this weekend in Europe is
[7:28] the Beauty and the Beast
[7:30] you like that
[7:31] and one of the thoughts that we're
[7:33] looking at is how that Satan has
[7:34] designed redesigned the woman
[7:37] and change things and he's the designer
[7:40] but God has watched out over Satan's
[7:43] attempt to pervert and defile and change
[7:45] and at the end of his Eden think about
[7:47] at the end of his Eden he would have
[7:48] loved to been able to produce a complete
[7:51] genderless race of people
[7:53] right and since he couldn't do it
[7:55] physically he couldn't do it literally
[7:57] he's trying to do it grammatically he's
[7:58] trying to do it through language he's
[8:00] trying to do it through a lot of
[8:01] different political pressures and so the
[8:03] Satan's the redesigner but even in that
[8:06] God has been watching over it to
[8:08] preserve it so you've heard the whole
[8:10] series you don't have to stream you
[8:11] don't have to get up early
[8:12] I think it's an eight-hour time
[8:14] difference I don't even know if it is
[8:15] going to be streamed but
[8:16] you don't have to worry about him
[8:18] God has washed over it
[8:21] so your body is the Lord glorify your
[8:23] body God in your body and your spirit
[8:25] which are the Lords then in First
[8:26] Corinthians chapter 3
[8:29] maybe going a little bit out of order
[8:30] from chapter six but in chapter 3 verses
[8:32] 16 and 17 he asked this question already
[8:35] know ye not that ye are the temple of
[8:38] God and that the spirit of God dwelleth
[8:40] in you if any man if any man defile the
[8:43] temple of God he shall God him shall God
[8:46] destroy for the temple of God is Holy
[8:48] which Temple ye are
[8:51] so here's the Commandment to not defile
[8:53] our bodies it is in this Commandment
[8:55] that we find basis for a lot of things
[8:57] that we would not do to our body
[9:00] many things that people might think to
[9:02] be lawful are things that people might
[9:03] think to be of no consequence we
[9:05] recognize this body to be the Temple of
[9:07] the Holy Ghost therefore we are mindful
[9:10] of how that we would change this body or
[9:12] mark this body or dress this body or
[9:14] things that we might do to intoxicate or
[9:17] influence this body this is a tremendous
[9:18] basis for a lot of principles in the
[9:21] scripture to keep this body from any
[9:23] influence that is inordinate or any
[9:25] influence that would keep us away from
[9:26] God
[9:27] and in looking at this that man should
[9:30] not defile the temple of God and even
[9:32] these other scriptures we're looking at
[9:33] here there is a there is a Biblical
[9:36] prescription to take care of your health
[9:38] that we ought not to live recklessly We
[9:40] ought not to there's certain things that
[9:41] we might do uh that are that are harmful
[9:45] to the flesh or potentially very
[9:46] dangerous or even uh life-threatening
[9:49] that we ought not to do foolishly
[9:51] because this body is the Temple of the
[9:53] Lord this body is his and so we are to
[9:56] look out after it and I believe that we
[9:58] have a directive to care for our
[10:00] physical well-being because it is God's
[10:02] body
[10:03] it is not just our own well it's mine I
[10:06] can do what I want to with it I think
[10:07] that's kind of a common phrase a lot
[10:09] these days my body my choice and and
[10:12] that's kind of where the platitude
[10:13] that's where people stand and we have to
[10:16] realize that as Christians well it isn't
[10:19] our body
[10:20] right it's the Lord's
[10:23] and so with a lot of these different
[10:24] scriptures we could have used and I'm
[10:26] wanting to go as quickly as possible
[10:29] today knowing that you are all here for
[10:30] lunch
[10:32] I'm just kidding I don't believe that
[10:34] but anyway I do
[10:37] maybe it we could pick on anybody we
[10:39] haven't seen in a while like well we
[10:40] know why you're here
[10:44] but based upon a lot of these scriptures
[10:47] it's not a bad desire to want to be
[10:49] healthy
[10:50] if the body is the Lords and we've been
[10:52] fearfully made we've been wonderfully
[10:54] made and it God has clothed us with skin
[10:56] and flesh and he's fenced us with bones
[10:58] and sinews and it wouldn't be wrong to
[11:00] want that that skin and that flesh and
[11:02] the organs and all this intricate
[11:04] Arrangement it wouldn't be wrong to want
[11:05] it to be in harmony or want it to be
[11:07] well and to be functioning properly it
[11:09] is not wrong to want to be healthy it's
[11:11] not wrong not an inordinate affection to
[11:13] want to be healed of a sickness
[11:16] so to desire to be healed is a good
[11:18] desire to desire to be healthy is a good
[11:21] desire but it must be balanced
[11:24] that even in this uh the the well-being
[11:28] and even the satisfaction of our bodies
[11:30] the health of our body the harmony body
[11:32] even being satisfied with our appearance
[11:34] or satisfied with our health is not the
[11:36] goal
[11:37] of life like I want to be healthy and I
[11:40] want to be strong I want to be beautiful
[11:41] I want to be fast I want to be able to
[11:43] slam dunk I want to be able to Palm a
[11:45] basketball I want to be able to do the
[11:46] splits whatever it is might be that
[11:48] people sometimes can just make these
[11:49] little bucket list items they want to do
[11:51] and maybe those are all trivial in your
[11:53] book but we cannot make a certain weight
[11:56] class or a certain strength the physique
[11:58] or Wellness we cannot make Health itself
[12:01] the primary goal or our primary concern
[12:05] the in Paul and talking about the body
[12:08] and the body being the Temple of the
[12:10] Lord he says the bodies for meats and
[12:11] the bellies for Meats he's talking about
[12:12] there's certain things that are
[12:13] necessary for the nourishment of the
[12:15] body but ultimately the body is the
[12:17] Lord's and the body has to rely upon
[12:19] certain things to satisfy it in
[12:22] nutrients but the body is not for
[12:24] fornication he's saying there's a lot
[12:25] he's teaching a lot of things about the
[12:27] body and understanding urges and desires
[12:29] and keeping the body under subjection
[12:31] and so there's a certain balance that we
[12:34] need to have when either we want to be
[12:36] uh have a certain physical appearance or
[12:39] maintain a certain physique or or just
[12:41] be healthy in a particular lifestyle
[12:43] that promotes health and well-being and
[12:45] the wholeness of the body there's a I
[12:47] hope you understand I'm trying to
[12:48] identify maybe one way that we try to
[12:51] approach things we're always trying to
[12:52] be so fit and so put together and so
[12:54] healthy and then on the other side maybe
[12:56] you'll have a sickness and the only
[12:58] thing you're concerned about the only
[12:59] thing you think about in your entire
[13:01] life fits under this Paradigm of how can
[13:03] I remedy this sickness
[13:05] and in both those instances there's a
[13:07] danger where you put too much emphasis
[13:09] on looking good or too much emphasis on
[13:12] feeling bad and you're not balanced in
[13:15] the word of God
[13:16] in Philippians chapter 3 verse 19 Paul
[13:19] calling out the the heathens and the
[13:22] those who love not God and do not mind
[13:24] the things of God it says whose end is
[13:26] destruction whose God is their belly and
[13:30] whose glory is in their shame who mind
[13:33] Earthly things
[13:35] what does it mean that their God is
[13:38] their belly it's there's a it's there's
[13:40] a way that you can apply this in such a
[13:42] way to to
[13:43] and then it's looking at anything to
[13:46] which someone would crave or desire of
[13:48] their want or their ambition becomes
[13:50] their God their God is their belly their
[13:52] God is their health their God is their
[13:54] the way they look their God is what they
[13:55] desire to do whether it be through some
[13:57] sort of hobby or ambition or
[13:59] um getting some sort of thrill or
[14:01] Adrenaline Rush whose God is their belly
[14:03] whose glory is in shame their shame who
[14:06] mind Earthly things
[14:08] so we ought not to be those who just
[14:10] pursue after what our flesh wants so our
[14:14] body is not the God our belly our
[14:16] digestive system our health is not our
[14:19] God and we ought not just to be minding
[14:21] Earthly things
[14:23] health and happiness are promised by God
[14:25] to the believer it's an absolute promise
[14:28] in the word of God in terms of health
[14:30] and happiness I believe that God
[14:32] provides them he Faithfully provides
[14:34] them by God but in pursuing either of
[14:36] those faith has to be the driving force
[14:39] if we just pursue health for Health's
[14:41] sake alone a Believer is going to find
[14:43] themselves in a tough spot
[14:45] if you're just pursuing happiness for
[14:47] happiness alone you're going to find
[14:48] yourself in a tough spot so both
[14:50] Pursuits must be balanced and subject to
[14:52] him
[14:53] and this is one thing I'm just trying to
[14:55] close the loop on before we finish the
[14:57] series is there's a real danger in
[14:59] putting too much emphasis on the flesh
[15:02] to a real danger in putting too much
[15:04] emphasis on the hope of healing when I
[15:08] say hope not a faith but a hope in
[15:10] healing
[15:11] we touched on this last Sunday I believe
[15:13] it was second Corinthians chapter 12
[15:15] verses 7 8-9 unless I should be exalted
[15:17] above measure through the abundance of
[15:19] Revelations there was given to me a
[15:21] thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[15:23] Satan to Buffet me lest I should be
[15:25] exalted above measure Paul identifying
[15:28] some detriment some deficiency in his
[15:31] flesh some a physical malady or problem
[15:34] to where he was we could say sick or had
[15:37] some sort of ailment and he actually
[15:39] caught a thorn in the flesh that he uh
[15:42] is being buffeted that is keeping him
[15:44] humble and he says for this thing I
[15:46] besought the Lord three times that it
[15:49] might depart from me and I was he he I
[15:52] don't know if it would just necessarily
[15:53] imply that just in three instances he
[15:55] prayed but there's at least three
[15:57] instances where he was seeking God these
[15:59] time periods or these instances where he
[16:01] said Lord please heal me please deliver
[16:03] me Lord this Thorn In My Flesh this
[16:06] messenger of Satan that is buffet in me
[16:07] oh God deliver me that I might be loosed
[16:10] from this infirmity that I might be well
[16:12] and better able to serve you and he says
[16:13] he sought God to be delivered from it
[16:16] and the Lord he says the Lord said unto
[16:18] me my grace is sufficient for thee for
[16:22] my strength is made perfect in weakness
[16:24] what a remarkable answer
[16:26] that in my insufficiencies and in my
[16:29] sickness God is saying my grace will
[16:31] make up the difference
[16:33] my grace will make you self-sufficient
[16:35] in Christ in Christ you're
[16:37] self-sufficient despite whatever
[16:38] weaknesses you might have in the flesh
[16:40] don't pray that the weakness and the
[16:42] flesh be removed but trust in the grace
[16:45] of God to lift you above and raise you
[16:47] above that weakness
[16:50] this isn't a weakness or tendency to sin
[16:52] but anything that would be limiting in
[16:54] your physical ability or physical health
[16:56] he says my grace is sufficient for the
[16:58] for my strength is made perfect in
[17:00] weakness
[17:02] that where there is a weakness in your
[17:04] flesh it's an opportunity for his
[17:05] perfect strength so he says most gladly
[17:08] therefore will I rather glory in my
[17:11] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[17:13] rest upon me
[17:15] any way that I've ever read this or seen
[17:17] this I you know commented on or preached
[17:20] about that the glory and is in the
[17:21] actual weakness or in the infirmity and
[17:24] then it just struck me this way that
[17:26] therefore will I gladly in my infirmity
[17:29] continue to Glory
[17:31] though I am weak and though I'm sick and
[17:33] though I have an infirmity I do not need
[17:35] to be made well in order to Rejoice I do
[17:37] not need to be healthy my glory and my
[17:40] praise and my happiness is not going to
[17:42] be in the absence of the thorn of Flesh
[17:45] because his grace is sufficient and his
[17:47] strength is made perfect in my weakness
[17:49] then in my weakness and in my infirmity
[17:52] I will still glorify God gladly
[17:57] because Paul knew that affliction
[18:00] promoted Glory
[18:01] and that through affliction
[18:03] well he knew that Glory through
[18:05] Affliction was a greater Miracle than a
[18:07] supernatural cure
[18:10] he knew that the glory that comes to
[18:11] Affliction would be a greater Miracle
[18:13] than God supernaturally removing that
[18:16] thorn from his flesh
[18:18] and we use that principle to support
[18:20] what he says to Timothy in first Timothy
[18:22] chapter 5 verse 23 where he says don't
[18:25] just drink water only when you're sick
[18:28] drink no longer water but use a little
[18:29] wine for thy stomach's sake and thine
[18:32] often infirmities
[18:34] Paul showing that he cared about the
[18:36] physical health of his friend his son in
[18:38] the gospel that he cared for the malady
[18:41] whatever it was that was bothering
[18:42] Timothy and even these frequent
[18:43] occurrences of whether it be headaches
[18:45] or some sort of
[18:47] um illness that brought Timothy very low
[18:50] he says take a little bit of wine to
[18:52] cure this this Affliction in your
[18:54] stomach and for the other things that
[18:55] you seem to so often be experiencing and
[18:58] we touched on how this was a a balanced
[19:00] view of the Prophet the messenger of
[19:02] this age who has given the gift of
[19:04] Miracles who had signs and wonders
[19:06] followed him that he referred to
[19:08] something within Timothy's REITs it'd be
[19:10] very simple for him to do to address
[19:12] some discomfort or some sickness in
[19:14] himself and it was a balanced view on
[19:16] the sickness because he identified it
[19:19] and he was willing to talk about it but
[19:21] then he also was very balanced in his
[19:22] cure and as we could say maybe he wasn't
[19:24] really extreme with Timothy
[19:27] and so that was that speaks to Paul's
[19:30] balance of I may be sick but healing my
[19:34] sickness is not the end of all things
[19:36] that's not my that's not the only thing
[19:39] I'm worried about is oh I'm sick and the
[19:40] only thing I can think about the only
[19:41] thing I'm worried about is getting well
[19:42] and getting well and getting well
[19:43] there's a tremendous detriment in that
[19:47] I know that the ministry of brother
[19:48] Branham was focused so much on Divine
[19:50] Healing and I think we can all agree on
[19:52] that it's very hard to find
[19:55] um
[19:56] any time period where brother Branham is
[19:59] just kind of taken a step back from ever
[20:01] mentioning praying for the sick or
[20:02] Divine Healing and a lot of the emphasis
[20:04] that we see in his ministry as we have
[20:06] it on tape from 47 to 65 our prayer
[20:09] lines and prayer cards and signs and
[20:11] wonders and miracles and a lot of things
[20:13] transparent around the physical healing
[20:16] of the body and because of it so often
[20:19] mentioned and so frequent within his
[20:21] ministry it it would be I think it would
[20:24] just be natural for us just to conclude
[20:25] that this is what it's all about because
[20:27] it's the most predominant thing that you
[20:29] might find on the tapes and through his
[20:31] ministry but it's very important to take
[20:33] time to consider the context of brother
[20:36] Branham emphasizing Divine Healing and
[20:38] how often that it came up in the context
[20:41] of it especially when you take even the
[20:44] sermons that he preached when he was in
[20:45] Jeffersonville at his home Church where
[20:47] it's not a healing campaign and not
[20:49] everybody's coming to get a prayer card
[20:51] and be prayed for
[20:52] and then so if we look at it from the
[20:55] standpoint that brother Branham is often
[20:57] on the road preaching conventions and
[20:59] campaigns all over the world and all
[21:00] over North America and that when he was
[21:03] coming people the drawing card was this
[21:06] man prays for the sick and they get well
[21:07] this man can discern the thoughts and
[21:09] intents of people's hearts and and it'd
[21:11] be kind of this impetus to healing and
[21:14] so he would have these revivals of these
[21:16] meetings for the sake of praying for the
[21:18] sick and for the call of salvation
[21:20] and if brother Branham was to stay there
[21:23] uh even if he was there for 30 days as
[21:25] he wanted to do and sometimes he wanted
[21:27] to stay and just pray for all the sick
[21:28] there would come a point maybe I'm just
[21:30] making this assumption to where if
[21:32] Brethren's like well I'm here and I'm
[21:33] going to be here for a long time he
[21:35] would then begin to move into the deeper
[21:37] things and the weightier matters of the
[21:38] word of God to bring people who've been
[21:40] healed and been saved into deeper
[21:42] fellowship with Christ his ministry
[21:44] alone he said there's more to this
[21:46] ministry than Divine Healing more to
[21:48] this Minister than just healing the
[21:49] physical body so we got to look at the
[21:51] context of when brother Branham is
[21:53] emphasizing Divine Healing and it was in
[21:56] these campaigns and a lot of times
[21:57] people were coming with life-threatening
[22:00] diseases
[22:01] they were at the end of the road they
[22:03] were dying they were debilitated they
[22:04] had some sort of condition where their
[22:06] lives are completely turned upside down
[22:08] they weren't able to live their normal
[22:09] lives and they were actually coming to
[22:11] these meetings as even oftentimes as a
[22:14] last resort for their lives to be
[22:16] changed
[22:18] and God was using the Miracles and the
[22:20] signs and the Wonders we know to stir up
[22:22] Faith in the unbelieving and for the
[22:24] healing of some to catch the attention
[22:25] of others
[22:27] and and I'm acknowledging just how
[22:29] frequently that's mentioned and because
[22:32] it's there so much the very fact that
[22:34] it's there is enough for us to realize
[22:36] that that's in the atonement and that's
[22:38] for us whether it be the miraculous cure
[22:41] or just God mindful of your health and
[22:44] God provided that promise in the word of
[22:46] God it's it's there
[22:48] but we the danger I would say today
[22:52] is that this repetition this frequency
[22:54] just the sheer volume May overwhelm our
[22:57] view of what the message is for or what
[23:00] the word of God is all about
[23:02] and we can make the conclusion that the
[23:04] goal the goal then of preaching the goal
[23:06] of meetings the goal of the message the
[23:08] goal of any kind of scriptural Ministry
[23:09] or the most important thing is the
[23:11] health of our body
[23:12] and I think that's getting a little bit
[23:14] out of balance because this isn't
[23:17] a well body isn't our goal
[23:20] that that's not the the goal is not just
[23:22] to be healthy in this life we say a
[23:24] perfect body is our goal right A Change
[23:26] body
[23:27] and we know that if our faith isn't set
[23:29] right
[23:30] both foundationally and then
[23:33] directionally
[23:34] like if our faith isn't set right in the
[23:36] word of God but then what direction
[23:37] we're going if it's not set right then
[23:39] we suffer we're going to talk about if
[23:41] you if your faith is set right in the
[23:43] right position then it brings a constant
[23:45] satisfaction so if our faith is based in
[23:47] the word of God and then directionally
[23:49] it's to the word of God that brings
[23:51] satisfaction but if in either way
[23:53] foundationally or directionally it's not
[23:55] right then that's when we get
[23:57] discouraged that's when we grieve that's
[23:59] when we suffer because our faith isn't
[24:01] based right foundationally and it's not
[24:03] set right directionally
[24:06] Paul says this in Philippians chapter 4
[24:08] verses 11 and 12 not that I speak in
[24:11] respect of want for I have learned and I
[24:13] think we ought to take this into the
[24:15] context of healing in whatsoever State I
[24:17] am therewith be content
[24:27] in whatsoever State I am there with be
[24:29] content
[24:30] I know both how to be a based I know how
[24:33] to abound a basement and abounding two
[24:35] different extremes everywhere and in all
[24:38] things I am instructed both to before
[24:40] and to be hungry both to abound and to
[24:44] suffer need
[24:46] Paul is is of the disposition and the
[24:49] character to say that whether I'm
[24:50] hurting or whether I'm healthy whether
[24:52] I'm sad or whether I'm happy or whether
[24:54] I'm Afflicted or bound abounding or a
[24:57] base then I'm going to be content
[24:59] I'm going to strive for contentment I'm
[25:01] going to be satisfied in Christ and no
[25:04] matter what I'm going through whatsoever
[25:05] State I am there with to be content this
[25:08] isn't the contentment is not resigned or
[25:12] accepting a bad situation but it's not
[25:15] allowing the situation to dictate your
[25:17] happiness
[25:18] is there there's the difference in this
[25:20] sense sometimes well I just don't want
[25:21] to accept it and I don't want to sign
[25:22] for the box of rattlesnakes uh so
[25:24] there's a there's a certain point where
[25:26] it says weatherman says oh you have
[25:27] cancer and you have to recognize you
[25:29] have cancer that doesn't mean I have to
[25:31] be resigned like oh well I guess this is
[25:32] my life and I guess I'm just going to
[25:34] die and I guess I just have to live with
[25:35] this but there's a way to say okay
[25:39] you know they said someone says to you
[25:41] and says well uh Marcus you've got stage
[25:43] four cancer okay all right
[25:46] that's quite the deal right and you you
[25:48] could say yes all right I get it and say
[25:50] well how could you be so kind of even
[25:52] kill in this moment well in whatsoever
[25:54] State I am I'm going to be content
[25:56] if God has allowed me to go through this
[25:58] then there must be a reason for it and
[26:00] there's a certain attitude that someone
[26:01] has towards it towards not all of a
[26:03] sudden and I know that's stage four
[26:04] cancer is pretty extreme but no matter
[26:06] what it is it's like we take it as a
[26:09] I have what
[26:11] an ingrown toe
[26:13] right and always think well how am I
[26:15] going to be able to run a marathon and
[26:16] what is that what if it gets infected
[26:18] and what if you have to remove it and is
[26:19] this a condition I'm going to pass down
[26:20] to my kids oh my goodness what am I
[26:22] doing all right he just says whatever
[26:24] state I am to there with be content
[26:27] now this is where I realize I want to
[26:30] share something
[26:31] and then and and then kind of pivot and
[26:34] I think this this could be such a large
[26:36] area that it might cause a lot of
[26:40] thinking and then when I get back in two
[26:42] weeks like brother Amber then we gotta
[26:43] talk
[26:44] but if Paul says if we just take these
[26:47] few things
[26:48] uh we've already we kind of set it up
[26:50] that the health of the body is important
[26:51] scripturally
[26:52] but then we're looking at this angle
[26:54] where Paul is some Affliction and
[26:55] suffering
[26:57] that it is oftentimes that even physical
[27:00] Affliction is for our benefit
[27:02] for God's glory
[27:04] and that there's there's a certain
[27:05] balance that we've got to take we've got
[27:07] to take a certain balance in this
[27:10] but in the day and age that we're living
[27:11] in it seems as if there is
[27:15] a thousand different remedies for
[27:17] whatever it is we're going through
[27:19] and that there's somebody promising
[27:21] relief
[27:22] if it's back pain there's a lot of
[27:24] different people telling you how they
[27:25] can get rid of that back pain if it's a
[27:27] cancer there's a billion ways to treat
[27:29] that cancer and so no matter what it is
[27:32] we're suffering with science and
[27:34] medicine and cures and remedies and all
[27:37] sorts of disciplines are telling us hey
[27:39] we can take care of that we can make
[27:41] that better
[27:43] and this is something that is well
[27:45] documented within the the medical
[27:46] community that there's a dark side to
[27:50] the hope that is created by medicine
[27:52] that when somebody is sick medicine
[27:54] gives them a hope that they can be well
[27:58] and so what ends up happening is they
[27:59] attach their future or their happiness
[28:02] or their lives to that treatment
[28:06] and so there's always well if this
[28:08] doesn't work there's this and if you
[28:09] don't if this doesn't work here then you
[28:11] can go to Mexico and try this and that
[28:12] doesn't work here you can go to China
[28:14] and try this and if this approach
[28:15] doesn't work you could try this ancient
[28:17] approach or you can try this trial
[28:18] medicine and there's a lot of different
[28:20] ways and maybe these are with more
[28:22] extreme cases or rare diseases but a
[28:24] patient a person who is sick is now
[28:27] looking at all these different
[28:28] opportunities and these avenues that
[28:30] they can go down to try to find healing
[28:32] and it creates this hope to where now
[28:34] they are hoping this isn't faith they're
[28:38] hoping to get well and there's a dark
[28:41] side to it because now the person in
[28:43] hope that they get well all they do is
[28:46] pursue the cure to get well and they
[28:48] fail to just live their lives and go
[28:51] forward
[28:52] they're not content until they can find
[28:54] the treatment that cures them
[28:57] and I believe that we have to be very
[28:58] careful with whatever it is we're asking
[29:01] God to heal us of that we do not create
[29:03] this false hope in any sort of cure or
[29:06] not even begin to get hopeful for
[29:08] healing but when it's true faith it sets
[29:11] our disposition very differently
[29:14] we should never just accept the sickness
[29:17] or be resigned well I guess I'm just
[29:18] sick but we can choose how we think
[29:21] about our sickness and we can choose how
[29:23] that we're going to go forward with our
[29:25] sickness
[29:28] you can take very conscious steps you
[29:30] can take definitive steps towards
[29:32] towards feeding your faith and believing
[29:34] in God and being content instead of just
[29:37] languishing in Hope chasing a cure
[29:41] Paul says there's in whatsoever State I
[29:42] am there with to be content and as this
[29:45] is an observable phenomena to if someone
[29:47] gets so caught up in being healthy then
[29:50] it becomes a hope and there's a dark
[29:52] side to it to where the person's getting
[29:54] more and more discouraged in the absence
[29:56] of a change or measurable benefits or
[30:00] something measurable that shows that
[30:01] they're improving and they're not living
[30:04] their life they're not going forward
[30:05] they're not serving God like they should
[30:07] they're not being faithful to their
[30:09] families they're not just saying you
[30:10] know what God has given me this life
[30:11] he's giving me this opportunity I'm
[30:13] going to keep living I'm going to keep
[30:15] serving in whatever state I'm going to
[30:16] keep going on yes do the things that you
[30:18] ought to do to take care of your health
[30:19] but don't stop and get this this image
[30:22] in front of you then unless this happens
[30:24] then nothing that nothing changes you
[30:26] have a choice how you can look at your
[30:28] healing you have a choice how you can
[30:29] look at your body and you make that
[30:31] choice and you go forward
[30:34] I want to read this lengthy statement
[30:36] from the sermon faith is our victory
[30:39] and this to me will kind of
[30:41] take us into this next step
[30:45] of this second half of the service this
[30:47] ties in so many different thoughts from
[30:49] the last few Services many of you have
[30:50] faith in your doctors
[30:52] and you should have if you've got a
[30:54] doctor
[30:55] now when something gets wrong with you
[30:57] you'll go to that Old Faithful doctor
[30:59] that you believe in that's what you
[31:00] should do now brother bam is uh very
[31:04] uh cleverly kind of setting up people
[31:07] whatever their expectations are and
[31:08] identifying that they have this attitude
[31:11] that when they're sick they go to their
[31:12] doctor and they just trust their doctor
[31:13] whatever he tells them to do to be well
[31:15] and he's again he has that balance where
[31:17] he's not going to condemn them for doing
[31:19] that but he says that's what you should
[31:20] do that's good and then you submit your
[31:23] case to him I believe we ought to
[31:25] realize that the faith he's talking
[31:26] about in the doctors is a Fidelity or a
[31:28] trust and not necessarily A Faith like
[31:31] you would in Christ he says if he says
[31:33] you should go to the hospital you don't
[31:34] do a thing but go home and pack up your
[31:36] clothes and take off to the hospital
[31:38] sure you got faith in the doctor and if
[31:41] he doesn't decide that you want to want
[31:43] to go to the hospital or you should go
[31:45] rather he will write out a prescription
[31:46] and give you a sack full of pills and
[31:49] you'll swallow them and you don't know
[31:51] what's in those pills but you've got
[31:53] faith in your doctor
[31:55] isn't is that not right that for a lot
[31:57] of people this is just the way that they
[31:59] do it it may not be your doctor but
[32:00] maybe it's some sort of uh somebody uh
[32:03] that is your health advisor or somebody
[32:06] who's advising you on your health that
[32:07] you go to to try to help you with your
[32:09] health and whatever they tell you to do
[32:11] they consult their book or they consult
[32:12] their Paradigm and they tell you to do
[32:14] it and we just say that's it I'm going
[32:15] to take your pills I'm going to take
[32:16] your potions I'm going to take your
[32:18] protocol whatever it is I'm going to do
[32:19] it he says it's because you have faith
[32:21] in your doctor
[32:22] and then he says how about God
[32:26] how about God then if this is the
[32:27] approach we would take with the doctor
[32:29] how about God and you're scared to
[32:31] swallow some of those some of the
[32:33] Gospels
[32:34] that he gives you by his stripes you
[32:37] were healed faith is the Victor that
[32:39] overcomes the world swallow it and see
[32:41] what happens it's a confidence
[32:44] now that to me it almost
[32:47] I I recognize the way the human mind
[32:49] works that well I want to drill down
[32:51] deeper into this and understand what
[32:52] faith looks like on this side because
[32:54] there's something measurable if I just
[32:55] do it the doctor says but it's in that
[32:59] approach
[33:00] that you'll just do what the doctor says
[33:02] and have that kind of confidence if you
[33:05] could have that kind of pure submission
[33:07] of your case to God he's saying if you
[33:10] could do that in the equivalent
[33:13] he says it it swallow it and see what
[33:16] happens take the gospel he says you show
[33:19] what confidence you have in your doctor
[33:21] by taking his medicine that you don't
[33:24] know what it is you show your confidence
[33:26] in the doctor by submitting yourself to
[33:28] an operation that proves your confidence
[33:31] in the doctor
[33:33] the fact that you submit the fact that
[33:35] you do and he says but when it comes to
[33:37] Christ you're so scared to take him at
[33:39] his word
[33:41] how is it faith is the victory you can
[33:45] submit your case to Jesus Christ tonight
[33:46] just as you submit your case to the
[33:49] doctrine
[33:50] you can do that now in the same way that
[33:52] you've trusted doctors in the same way
[33:54] that you've given them their chance in
[33:55] the same way that you've honored certain
[33:57] prescriptions and done certain things
[33:59] you were asked to do he says you could
[34:01] submit your case to the doctor give me
[34:03] anything you want to Lord You're the
[34:05] doctor on the gays Lord just move my
[34:09] faith tell me what to do let me take you
[34:10] at your word then you've got the victory
[34:13] then you've got the faith that overcomes
[34:15] and then listen to how a striking this
[34:18] is you'll never hunt another prayer line
[34:20] You'll never hunt nothing else you'll
[34:23] have it right there it'll be settled and
[34:25] you'll see the vein that he's talking
[34:26] about where this this point where your
[34:29] life tips and now only thing you're
[34:30] aware of is getting healed getting
[34:31] healed getting healed getting healed
[34:32] getting healed he says you'll never hunt
[34:34] another prayer line You'll never hunt
[34:35] nothing else you'll have it right there
[34:37] it'll be settled you'll never jump from
[34:39] church to church to see if this one's
[34:41] got it or that one's got it they haven't
[34:43] got it you've got it then
[34:45] when you've got the faith you have the
[34:48] victory
[34:49] that's the that's the we I want you to
[34:52] recognize that as Believers you'll
[34:53] always have this pill in your bag
[34:56] you'll always have this pill in your
[34:58] medicine cabinet you'll always have this
[35:00] in your life just settle it in your
[35:02] heart right now that that if you ever
[35:05] have need of it if you ever get
[35:07] desperate enough just believe that God
[35:10] faith is the Victory and that you can
[35:12] always take that gospel for what you're
[35:14] going through
[35:17] and he's identifying a place that you
[35:19] can't come by faith until you'll never
[35:21] have to hunt anything else again
[35:26] faith is the victory
[35:28] faith in what his word
[35:31] in Psalms 107 verses 17 to 22
[35:35] this was some of the primary scriptures
[35:37] we used at the foundation
[35:39] of the series
[35:42] says he sent his word and healed them
[35:44] and delivered them from their
[35:46] destructions
[35:47] took a lot of time in the outset
[35:48] connecting salvation to healing and even
[35:51] how here even in Psalms 107 it's showing
[35:53] that man because of his witness
[35:54] wickedness because of his sin he has
[35:56] brought these things upon him and these
[35:58] calamities upon him but then in their
[35:59] distressed they call upon the Lord he
[36:01] hears them
[36:03] and he heals them
[36:05] and he says he sent his word
[36:07] and healed them
[36:09] now
[36:11] it's spoken in the past tense just as is
[36:15] by his stripes we are healed
[36:18] he sent his word
[36:20] and healed them and delivered them from
[36:23] their destructions and notice the very
[36:24] next verse Oh that men would praise the
[36:26] Lord for his goodness
[36:28] and for his wonderful Works to the
[36:30] Children of Men
[36:31] and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of
[36:34] Thanksgiving and declare his works with
[36:37] rejoicing
[36:39] this is what we have to do after we're
[36:41] healed
[36:42] he says he sent his word and healed them
[36:44] and delivered them then it says oh that
[36:46] men would praise the Lord for his
[36:47] goodness for his wonderful works for the
[36:48] children of men what wonderful works of
[36:50] Deliverance and healing let them bring
[36:52] sacrifices of Thanksgiving and declare
[36:54] his works with rejoicing what works with
[36:56] rejoicing the fact that he healed them
[36:58] and delivered them
[36:59] he this is this is exactly what we are
[37:02] to do this is what must follow healing
[37:04] is praise
[37:07] it says to praise the Lord for his
[37:09] goodness
[37:10] and so if I could put it this way that
[37:12] our demeanor and our attitude after
[37:15] we've been healed ought to be one that
[37:17] declares the goodness of God that
[37:19] promotes his glory that declares his
[37:21] wonderful uh goodness and kindness
[37:23] towards us it's a one of Praise one of
[37:26] Thanksgiving one of rejoicing why
[37:28] because you're declaring his wonderful
[37:30] work in your life
[37:31] this is what we ought to do if you're
[37:33] ever sick and you're healed and remember
[37:35] God is the Healer of all he's the one of
[37:38] all healing if there's any healing to
[37:40] God be the glory and so there's a way
[37:42] that you give God the glory through
[37:44] whatever testimony you might have of
[37:46] your healing and it says all that if you
[37:48] are healed if God sent his word and
[37:49] healed you if you find yourself well
[37:51] Hezekiah did not need to start a
[37:54] multi-level marketing scheme on on fig
[37:56] packs right or fig cakes but he could
[38:00] say thanks be to God the the Fig cake
[38:03] was applied and this press was applied
[38:06] and this pace was applied and God
[38:08] delivered me and God healed me
[38:11] and Hezekiah could stand there and
[38:14] describe his situation and express what
[38:17] he was going through and exactly how the
[38:19] prophet came and ministered to his need
[38:21] Timothy himself could say oh I used to
[38:23] have these stomach problems but Paul
[38:25] told me just to mix a little bit of wine
[38:27] in with my water and that took away that
[38:29] bitterness it took away that pain and
[38:31] it's been completely gone and my
[38:32] headaches are gone thanks be to God he
[38:34] made a way and I'm well
[38:37] rejoicing in Praise
[38:40] Spurgeon even in looking at this very
[38:42] scripture preach this I'm forgetting now
[38:44] just exactly where he preached the
[38:46] sermon it may I wish I would have
[38:49] written it down
[38:50] but listen to this I thought this was so
[38:53] instructive
[38:54] when a person is very ill
[38:56] one of the greatest kindnesses that you
[38:59] can show to him is to tell him how you
[39:02] felt under a similar affliction
[39:05] to what physician you resorted what
[39:07] remedies he prescribed through what
[39:10] process you passed what were the
[39:12] symptoms connected with your recovery
[39:14] and how long you have been able to
[39:16] Rejoice over the Cure which has been
[39:18] wrought in you
[39:19] I know that's maybe
[39:22] describes is descriptive on a number of
[39:24] levels in terms of wow uh do I have the
[39:27] same sickness and what was the approach
[39:29] and she's saying that this is this is uh
[39:32] this is again this is even balancing to
[39:33] me it was like well I'm I don't always
[39:35] want to just go on anecdotes or somebody
[39:37] else's experience but this is very true
[39:39] when you think about the word testimony
[39:41] and testifying that the greater kindness
[39:44] that you can show somebody who is sick
[39:46] with migraines is to tell them if you
[39:49] had migraines how that God cured you
[39:54] and the steps that you went through why
[39:56] because you're showing that I as a
[39:58] Believer submitted to this process and I
[40:01] find myself better he says and how long
[40:03] you've been able to Rejoice of the Cure
[40:04] which is wrought in you this kind of
[40:07] practical experiential talk will be far
[40:11] more valuable to him than any doctor's
[40:13] opinions that you may read to him out of
[40:15] a book of Medicine
[40:17] it's going to mean much more to hear
[40:18] from a Believer how that God wrought a
[40:20] miracle in their life then we're gonna
[40:22] then anything we can get from webmd.com
[40:25] anything you can get from Health on
[40:27] anything you can get from some some book
[40:28] of medicine that you're reading out tell
[40:30] the sufferer what your experience has
[40:32] been and you will generally find that he
[40:34] will attach more importance to that
[40:37] than to any Theory which you may
[40:40] propound to him however well you may
[40:42] support that theory by argument
[40:45] oh my goodness I need to start another
[40:47] series
[40:49] because think of how often we are
[40:51] theorizing right and just weighing in
[40:53] and giving our two cents well let me
[40:55] tell you something about about that
[40:57] particular disease well did you ever
[40:58] have it no but I've Googled it I stayed
[41:00] at a holiday in express last night and
[41:02] so I can share with you a lot of hot
[41:04] takes on your particular condition I've
[41:07] read this and I've read that well I was
[41:08] doing some research and it told me this
[41:10] and there's a whole and and Spurgeon is
[41:12] saying you know what if you've
[41:14] experienced it and you've gone through
[41:15] it and you're on the other side of it by
[41:18] you telling them your experience and by
[41:20] you testifying it's going to mean a lot
[41:22] more than all the theories you expound
[41:25] on no matter how much Google research
[41:27] you've done and can support it
[41:30] that the individual the person is going
[41:32] to put much greater emphasis on your
[41:36] testimony of how you were healed than
[41:39] anything else that can be added to it
[41:43] and I believe that's that's a caution to
[41:45] us
[41:46] and how sometimes we treat we approach
[41:49] other people's sicknesses
[41:51] and I believe that it measures us to
[41:53] where if we're going to testify God gets
[41:56] the glory
[41:57] God gets the benefit and I say herein
[42:00] lies the secret to our going forward
[42:02] whether to keep us from languishing in
[42:04] Hope or to keep us from that dark side
[42:06] that the the hope of medicine provides
[42:08] but it's the our secret in going forward
[42:11] to our healing
[42:13] because if we're even going to be healed
[42:15] if this is our is this if this is my
[42:17] disposition after I'm Healed is praise
[42:19] then why don't I just assume it now
[42:22] right you ever heard the phrase dress
[42:24] for the job you want not the one you
[42:25] have right I'm sure you've heard that
[42:28] before well how about you how about you
[42:30] start praising for the healing that's
[42:31] coming
[42:33] if you're going to be happy when you get
[42:34] healed why don't you just get happy now
[42:37] oh if I get healed I would do this well
[42:39] why don't you do it now
[42:41] whatever it is that you're putting off
[42:43] until you get healed if you are able to
[42:45] do it do it now
[42:47] this is this is the right kind of
[42:49] attitude to approach your healing if we
[42:51] had the right if with Paul with Paul's
[42:53] approach and I realize now I feel like
[42:55] I'm coming woefully short of making this
[42:57] point uh clear but if we could take
[42:59] Paul's approach to where with whatever
[43:01] state I'm in I'm going to be with
[43:02] content that the sufferings in this
[43:04] present time are not worthy to be
[43:05] compared to the glory which shall be
[43:06] revealed in us and that's the way that
[43:08] we approach life and I'm not going to
[43:10] languish and hope and make my body the
[43:12] God but I'm just going to live for God
[43:13] and all that I can do for him then you
[43:16] might find yourself focusing having your
[43:18] faith foundationally correct and
[43:20] directionally correct you might find
[43:22] yourself all of a sudden decades later
[43:23] living the full life believing in God
[43:26] stepping into a new body and having
[43:28] never been healed from that thought in
[43:30] your flesh but wow I lived a full life
[43:31] it didn't matter that I had this problem
[43:34] a lot of these things anymore that we
[43:36] get diagnosed with they're trying to put
[43:38] a sentence on you so you have to
[43:40] completely live under some sort of spell
[43:42] and I believe you could just take God's
[43:44] God at his word and go forward do what
[43:46] you need to do to dress it if it's
[43:48] medicine if it's therapy whatever it
[43:50] might be we can say that's not my
[43:52] Paradigm that's not my life my life I'm
[43:54] not a sufferer I'm not a victim of this
[43:56] this is not my sentence I'm going to
[43:58] take God in his word and I'm going to
[44:00] live and I'm going to go forward and I'm
[44:02] not going to wait until my back is
[44:03] straight to praise I'm not going to wait
[44:05] till my stomach is no longer sour to
[44:07] praise but I can begin now to live a
[44:09] life of worship to God regardless of
[44:12] this throne in my flesh
[44:14] far too often people let their
[44:16] sicknesses keep them in bed and out of
[44:18] worship and out of service and away from
[44:20] the body of Christ it's time to say I'm
[44:22] not going to wait till I get well to
[44:24] serve I'm gonna start serving them now
[44:25] [Applause]
[44:29] and that's the approach that we can take
[44:30] to our lives be much better off than
[44:33] just taking this approach well I guess I
[44:34] better do this and the best I guess I
[44:36] better do that you know I have this hope
[44:37] I have this hope I have this hope just
[44:39] start serving God with all that is in
[44:41] you
[44:42] it's a very this idea of Praise it's a
[44:45] very uh forms a very basis the beginning
[44:47] the end of The Lord's Prayer when he
[44:49] taught us to pray after this manner pray
[44:52] ye Our Father which art in heaven
[44:53] Hallowed be thy name with the salutation
[44:56] the salute to God this praise to God you
[44:58] begin it by praising him Hallowed be thy
[45:00] name and then in the closing of the
[45:02] prayer in Matthew 6 he says for thine is
[45:04] the kingdom and the power and the glory
[45:06] forever amen what is this it's adoration
[45:09] it's praise it's being offered to
[45:11] Thanksgiving to him
[45:13] in Psalms 104 enter into his gates with
[45:15] Thanksgiving and into his courts with
[45:17] praise be thankful unto him and bless
[45:19] his name you cannot come before him
[45:22] without Thanksgiving you cannot enter
[45:24] into his presence without praise these
[45:27] are the keys to your entrance this is
[45:29] how that you in the similitude of Esther
[45:31] can approach the king so that he sends
[45:34] forth the scepter and says whatever it
[45:36] is you want why don't you ask when we
[45:38] come and we have not dressed ourselves
[45:40] with praise we have not dressed
[45:42] ourselves with Thanksgiving then it has
[45:44] it's not becoming to the god that we're
[45:46] approaching whatever you have need of if
[45:48] it's to know his will if it's to be
[45:50] healed if it's to get an answer on
[45:52] something if it's to know what the the
[45:54] decision to make you ought to come
[45:57] before him not with all help me help me
[45:59] help me help me help me but come with
[46:01] Thanksgiving in your mouth come with
[46:03] praise upon your lips that's the only
[46:05] proper way to approach the king when you
[46:07] have a request
[46:10] dress yourself with garments of praise
[46:12] dress yourself with garments of
[46:14] Thanksgiving
[46:16] Paul writes it in Philippians 4 6 be
[46:18] careful for nothing don't be anxious
[46:21] about anything
[46:22] can we say that together be careful for
[46:26] nothing
[46:27] and could you all say brother Aaron
[46:29] don't be anxious about anything tell me
[46:31] I need to hear it come on say it
[46:35] amen I accept it
[46:38] accept it for this trip I accept it for
[46:40] all the decisions and all the turns and
[46:42] all the travel whatever it might be I
[46:44] accept it because I shouldn't be anxious
[46:46] about anything
[46:48] and it's a nasty little bug you get
[46:51] anxious about getting anxious
[46:53] I'm not anxious but should I be anxious
[46:55] am I going to get anxious now I'm
[46:58] anxious about the fact that I'll
[46:59] probably get anxious
[47:01] but I'm not going to be anxious for
[47:02] anything
[47:04] but in everything I love that for in and
[47:07] and don't be careful for nothing be
[47:10] careful for nothing but in everything
[47:12] you got a nothing and you got an
[47:14] everything in everything by prayer and
[47:16] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[47:19] requests be made known unto God and
[47:22] others you can't pray without praise
[47:24] you can't ask without Thanksgiving you
[47:27] can't even do it unless you're thinking
[47:29] in glory in God
[47:30] don't be anxious about anything but in
[47:33] everything
[47:34] by prayer and supplication with
[47:37] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[47:39] known unto God therefore if there's
[47:41] anything that you have a concern of
[47:43] instead of being anxious about it by
[47:45] prayer and supplication with your
[47:47] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[47:49] known unto God
[47:51] showing that we enter with Thanksgiving
[47:53] and praise
[47:55] prayer is the act of making a request or
[47:57] supplication to God praise is an act of
[48:00] expressing adoration and thanks to God
[48:02] we don't just pray we pray is when we
[48:04] pray
[48:06] that's what prayer ought to be it ought
[48:07] to have this function it's Dynamic
[48:08] praise and thanksgiving that when you
[48:10] begin your prayer you you begin with
[48:13] this adoration this call upon God
[48:15] Hallowed be thy name God you are the god
[48:17] that is above all I thank you for this
[48:19] and I acknowledge you for that and you
[48:21] just begin to thank them hey if you ever
[48:23] get under the anointing of prayer
[48:24] sometimes you start thanking them you'll
[48:26] be so busy thinking and praising you'll
[48:28] forget to ask and and say amen and find
[48:31] out he already granted it
[48:34] brother banham uses Mary a lot in this
[48:36] example in the sermon Abraham he said
[48:38] but what did Mary say she never
[48:40] questioned it
[48:43] she said behold the handmaid of the Lord
[48:45] be it unto me according to Thy word and
[48:47] what did she do
[48:51] she never waited till she was positive
[48:54] I don't know if he's talking about a
[48:55] test or what she never waited till she
[48:57] was positive she never waited till she
[48:59] felt or anything else that she was
[49:01] positive like I'll just wait till I can
[49:03] feel the baby kick I'll just wait till I
[49:05] know something's changed as long as God
[49:07] said so that was enough for her to have
[49:08] it
[49:10] she took God in his word and began
[49:12] testifying that she was going to have a
[49:14] baby before she had any evidence other
[49:16] than the word of God she was Abraham's
[49:18] seed just as soon as God said so and you
[49:21] read it in the Bible take him at his
[49:23] word and start thanking him for it
[49:27] there's nothing wrong with thanking him
[49:29] for it
[49:30] because it's a promise in his word when
[49:32] the Holy Ghost fell on the people at
[49:33] Pentecost they took God's word he never
[49:35] said you wait up there two days three
[49:37] days ten days he says you wait until and
[49:40] they were up there thanking him and
[49:42] praising him for his promise when the
[49:44] Holy Ghost came what were they doing
[49:46] they were thanking him and praising him
[49:48] not oh Lord help me oh Lord help me oh
[49:50] Jesus help me help me
[49:54] thanking them and praising them
[49:56] take him at his word thank him for it if
[49:59] you need healing you need Liberation
[50:01] from anything receive it believe it take
[50:05] his word thank him for it and call those
[50:07] things which not as though they were
[50:09] this is the attitude and disposition
[50:11] this is how in whatsoever state I'm in
[50:13] there with to be content it's not that
[50:15] I'm resigning to always be this way but
[50:17] I have a god who's promised to look
[50:19] after me and care for me and I will
[50:20] praise him and I will thank him and I
[50:22] will already thank him for the healing
[50:24] that is on its way
[50:26] Paul writes it this way in first
[50:28] Thessalonians 5 16 17 and 18 Rejoice
[50:30] Evermore
[50:32] how how should I Rejoice Evermore
[50:35] pray without ceasing
[50:37] in everything give thanks for this is
[50:40] the will of God in Christ Jesus
[50:41] concerning you what's the will of God in
[50:43] Christ Jesus concerning me that you
[50:45] would Rejoice ever more pray without
[50:46] ceasing and everything give things
[50:49] that you have a cycle of rejoicing
[50:50] praying and giving things I'm going to
[50:52] Rejoice pray give things Rejoice pray
[50:56] get things I ain't got time to be sad or
[50:58] anxious in that if that's all that's on
[51:00] my to-do list I'm going to wake up
[51:02] rejoicing and I have a need I'm going to
[51:03] be praying and once I prayed I'm going
[51:05] to be thinking I don't have room for
[51:07] worry I I don't have room I'm going to
[51:09] fill my heart up with faith where
[51:10] there's no place in my heart for any of
[51:13] this disconcerting stuff or this dark
[51:15] side of Hope why I'm rejoicing and I'm
[51:18] rejoicing and when I have a need I'll
[51:20] ask for it and when I'm done asking I'll
[51:22] give I'll start thinking and then once
[51:24] I'm done thank you I'm going to start
[51:25] rejoicing and I want to begin to cycle
[51:27] in my life of praise and thanksgiving
[51:29] and glory and happiness and joy
[51:32] [Music]
[51:35] this is the will of God for me
[51:37] brother Brandon believeth thou this he's
[51:39] talking about Mary again
[51:41] he says she started praising God before
[51:43] she even had any sign
[51:46] that it was going to be done she didn't
[51:48] know she never waited till she felt life
[51:49] she didn't wait till something was
[51:51] showing she just believed it there it is
[51:53] say why brother Richie prayed for me
[51:55] last night but I don't seem to be any
[51:57] better sorry brother Richie
[51:59] he says you'll never be like that
[52:02] take God at his word
[52:04] start thanking him for it praise him
[52:08] until it comes
[52:10] if you were prayed for last night and
[52:12] you don't feel any better then get your
[52:14] mind off of the feeling better and start
[52:17] praising he says thank him for it praise
[52:20] him for it oh that's the way God give us
[52:22] more Mary's just accept it remember the
[52:25] word of God will defeat Satan anywhere
[52:27] he said anywhere anytime any place
[52:30] therefore I've Got Confidence in the
[52:33] word that gives me enough reason to
[52:35] praise him and to thank him and to
[52:36] rejoice
[52:37] the doe says well what if you never get
[52:39] healed that doesn't change his word what
[52:41] if it hurts worse tomorrow that doesn't
[52:42] change his word doesn't change the
[52:44] greatness of God that doesn't change his
[52:46] glory it doesn't change don't you has he
[52:48] done good things for you
[52:49] has he not done a great thing for you do
[52:51] you have a reason to pray praise him
[52:53] some of you who may be sick and have
[52:56] chronic illnesses maybe you're facing
[52:57] very difficult trials maybe there's
[52:59] things you desperately want and God
[53:01] hasn't seemed to give it to you but has
[53:03] he been good to you has his word made
[53:05] promises that he's kept oh you've got
[53:08] enough reason to praise him you have
[53:09] enough reason to thank him you have
[53:11] enough reason to Rejoice Evermore if you
[53:14] have a need make your supplication with
[53:16] praise make your supplication with
[53:18] Thanksgiving and then when you've asked
[53:20] and you've given it submitted it to God
[53:22] and you submit his case to him don't
[53:24] hold back your praise until you get the
[53:26] answer let the praise go forth now
[53:28] [Applause]
[53:30] let it Pour forth from you
[53:33] praise him till it comes
[53:35] the Bible says in Psalms 30 verse 12 to
[53:37] the end that my glory may sing praise to
[53:39] thee and not be silent O Lord my God I
[53:42] will give thanks unto thee forever
[53:46] oh that it would not be silent
[53:50] to the end that my glory may sing praise
[53:52] to thee I'll give thanks unto thee
[53:54] forever
[53:55] oh that my glory what think about it
[53:58] when Paul said therefore I rather glory
[54:00] in my infirmities not that we're going
[54:02] to be worshiping and adoring or happy
[54:05] that we're sick but in our sicknesses
[54:07] we're happy
[54:09] in Psalm 34 1 I Will Bless The Lord at
[54:12] all times
[54:13] what times all times
[54:15] his praise shall
[54:17] continually be in my mouth
[54:20] it's a shame that the only time these
[54:21] words are in our mouths when we're
[54:22] singing
[54:24] but it
[54:25] ought to be at all times
[54:27] I Will Bless The Lord at all times his
[54:29] praise shall continually be in my mouth
[54:32] that means there's never a moment where
[54:34] praise isn't appropriate
[54:37] there's never a moment when blessing the
[54:39] Lord isn't appropriate why because it's
[54:42] due him at all times I Will Bless The
[54:44] Lord at all times his praise shall
[54:46] continually be in my mouth and
[54:48] whatsoever time I am afraid that is the
[54:51] time that I will not only trust in you
[54:53] but I will glory in you I will praise
[54:55] you I will worship you I will lift your
[54:57] name on high it says let everything the
[54:59] half-breath praise the Lord Praise ye
[55:02] the Lord Brother Aaron when should I
[55:04] praise take a breath you can breathe
[55:06] praise
[55:07] how often should I give him thanks are
[55:09] you breathing praise that everything
[55:11] that hath breath in other words let
[55:13] anything that's alive let anything
[55:15] that's breathing that anything that has
[55:17] a heartbeat they ought to be beating for
[55:19] him they ought to be breathing for him
[55:20] they'll be living for him let everything
[55:23] that has breath well I've got a headache
[55:25] dear God breath praise them well I've
[55:28] got a bum ankle do you got breath praise
[55:30] him doesn't say whoever has a healthy
[55:32] body Praise Him whoever's got breath
[55:35] even if I'm struggling to breathe oh God
[55:37] let it be with my last breath then I
[55:40] praise him
[55:41] let everything to have breath
[55:44] praise ye the Lord
[55:48] and the sermon be certain of God
[55:51] I thought of this recently would just
[55:53] ask what does a person do when they've
[55:55] turned over every stone
[55:57] they've asked God to show them if
[55:58] there's anything they need to make right
[55:59] if there's anybody they need to forgive
[56:01] they've done everything they can they've
[56:03] forgiven they've asked for forgiveness
[56:04] they've done everything they can then be
[56:06] certain of God
[56:08] when you turned over every stone you've
[56:09] gone down every road you could think of
[56:10] you tried to do everything then be
[56:13] certain of God
[56:14] he tells
[56:16] it says in the
[56:18] prayer line You'll find this happens so
[56:19] frequently
[56:20] that I just I used some statements that
[56:22] I'd used before because you start
[56:24] reading these and you realize okay I've
[56:27] got a thousand of these that are very
[56:29] similar this come sister I lay hands
[56:30] upon the woman and the child in the name
[56:32] of Jesus Christ me may they be healed
[56:34] come sister now this is what he just did
[56:37] he says come he lays hands on a prism
[56:38] that's it
[56:40] and he says don't let down
[56:44] right
[56:45] think about think about the attitude now
[56:47] how when you're really desperate you're
[56:48] pushing right you're pushing and a
[56:50] sister comes through to be prayed for
[56:52] and brother brown maybe she wanted
[56:53] discernment I don't know what the
[56:55] expectation might have been but as he
[56:56] prays for him you get this sense and now
[56:58] he says now there's like oh Lord him oh
[57:00] God please tell me oh God heal me like
[57:03] your brother man lays hands on him it's
[57:04] like just may they be healed the name of
[57:05] Jesus Christ they're like
[57:07] right
[57:09] now now they're quiet now their lips are
[57:11] sealed he says don't let down when you
[57:13] come by here start praising God when
[57:15] you're prayed for
[57:17] this isn't the time to stop
[57:19] well you did a lot of talking and your
[57:21] mouth was doing a lot of moving there's
[57:22] a lot of pouring out when you needed it
[57:24] but he's saying now that you've been
[57:25] prayed for let it Pour forth now for
[57:28] real I don't care if it takes 25 years
[57:30] if you're the children of Abraham then
[57:32] you've got the faith of Abraham and then
[57:35] you should have the praise of David you
[57:37] should have the glory rolling up within
[57:38] you to say I've got faith to believe I'm
[57:40] well I'm not going to let these lips
[57:42] fall silent
[57:44] why would you do it that's only
[57:45] testifying to a symbol of death I'm
[57:47] going to let these lips Praise Him
[57:50] he says don't let down in Psalm 42 11
[57:52] why aren't thou cast down on my soul why
[57:55] are thou disquieted within me hope thou
[57:58] and God for I shall yet Praise Him
[58:01] who is the health of my countenance
[58:04] in my God
[58:06] that matters more the health of your
[58:08] countenance matters more than the health
[58:10] of your feet than the health of your
[58:12] head than the health of your heart the
[58:13] health of your stomach you name it the
[58:15] health of my countenance I will yet
[58:17] praise him who is the health of my
[58:19] account he's the reason why I'm happy
[58:21] he's the reason why I'm expecting he's
[58:23] the reason why I can live another day
[58:25] he's the reason why I get up in the
[58:26] morning he's the source of my joy not a
[58:29] pack of cigarettes or a bottle of pills
[58:31] Christ is the source of my joy Christ is
[58:34] the source of my ambition Christ is the
[58:36] source of my pleasure
[58:38] I will not glory in the things of man I
[58:40] will not find my rest and hope in those
[58:42] things but I will say Christ he alone is
[58:45] my hope
[58:47] and he alone is my helper I shall yet
[58:49] praise him oh so then why is your soul
[58:51] cast down why aren't this quiet enemy oh
[58:54] now in that moment
[58:56] that most things trust yet in the middle
[58:58] and praise him
[59:01] so much can be said about the negative
[59:03] testimony
[59:05] even going back to what Spurgeon had to
[59:06] say when he said you know nothing would
[59:08] nothing's going to matter more to
[59:09] another believer I know I'm putting it
[59:10] in my words than to hear you testify of
[59:13] how God healed you
[59:14] and even the sickness you felt what you
[59:16] went through the cures that were used
[59:17] and testify in the end I was made well
[59:20] he says none of that
[59:22] that'll do better than anything you
[59:24] could read out of a book
[59:26] to say hey yeah don't worry about this
[59:27] problem there's this remedy and this
[59:29] helps and this helps and this helps even
[59:31] if it may seem to be positive he's
[59:32] saying your positive testimony of what
[59:35] you went through means more to a
[59:36] believer
[59:38] would be more to the one that's sick
[59:39] than all the scientific evidence that
[59:41] you could provide them that's that's
[59:42] hopeful
[59:44] now if that's the upside of your
[59:45] testimony what's the downside
[59:49] that when we get Negative oh yeah I've
[59:51] been there you're just gonna have to
[59:52] have that have that cut off
[59:54] right
[59:56] out of the negative testimonies that we
[59:58] have sometime yeah my my kid was doing
[1:00:00] that you might as well just expect that
[1:00:02] they're going to go into the world
[1:00:05] the negative testimonies
[1:00:08] I'll praise him who's the health of my
[1:00:10] countenance and my God the sermon Be not
[1:00:12] Afraid and I'm going to challenge your
[1:00:13] faith right now to do something
[1:00:15] what do you think what do you think do
[1:00:18] you all believe it's the Holy Spirit how
[1:00:20] many Moses knows that's exactly the same
[1:00:21] sermon I preached tonight of Jesus
[1:00:23] Christ how many believes that inside out
[1:00:25] so he's he's calling back to what he
[1:00:28] preached and that demonstration of the
[1:00:30] presence God says raise your hands
[1:00:32] says all that will accept Jesus as their
[1:00:34] healer right now I don't care what's
[1:00:36] wrong with you how crippled you are
[1:00:37] nothing about it if you'll accept Jesus
[1:00:39] as your healer stand up to your feet and
[1:00:42] raise up your hands and start praising
[1:00:44] him for healing you and you can have
[1:00:45] your healing right now
[1:00:47] how often do we hear him say something
[1:00:48] along those lines that in that moment of
[1:00:50] crisis when it's come into a head when
[1:00:52] something's got to give he says Just
[1:00:54] Praise Him just begin to praise him just
[1:00:57] begin to glorify him just begin to start
[1:01:00] lifting him up and adore him the focus
[1:01:02] on the Christ
[1:01:05] glorify God in your body and in your
[1:01:07] spirit with your Gods if you're sick
[1:01:09] Paul is saying that this I say he's
[1:01:11] talking about the body and the body
[1:01:13] therefore being God's glorified God in
[1:01:15] your body and in your spirit which are
[1:01:17] Gods that's our number one duty that's
[1:01:20] what we ought to do is to serve him to
[1:01:22] fear Him and to keep his Commandments I
[1:01:24] will glorify God in my body in my spirit
[1:01:26] when he says my grace is sufficient for
[1:01:28] thee therefore my most gladly therefore
[1:01:30] glory in my infirmities then in my
[1:01:33] sickness I will praise him not just in
[1:01:35] my health but in my sickness I will
[1:01:38] praise him I can say hallelujah it's
[1:01:40] finished
[1:01:44] and the sermon what thinking of Christ
[1:01:45] brother braham's talking about an acorn
[1:01:48] and he says he says then you you set it
[1:01:51] out into the yard
[1:01:52] and just keeps growing
[1:01:57] but you can praise God just as soon as
[1:01:58] you get the acorn
[1:02:00] principal of an acorn right when you
[1:02:02] have an acorn if you plant it in the
[1:02:04] right kind of ground right you're
[1:02:05] talking about the principles of the seed
[1:02:07] that you know that that'll grow into a
[1:02:10] tree
[1:02:11] but let's not wait till we get the tree
[1:02:13] praise him as soon as you get the acorn
[1:02:15] because you got the tree already
[1:02:17] now when God said I am the Lord the
[1:02:19] healeth thee just start praising
[1:02:22] you got it you got it right then you say
[1:02:25] well I don't see any results but that
[1:02:26] don't take make any difference you got
[1:02:28] it anyhow see because the word of God is
[1:02:30] a seed is that right and we are sold
[1:02:32] with the incredible seed of God it can't
[1:02:35] perish it's incorruptible
[1:02:37] I don't know if you read it this way but
[1:02:39] I want to put it this way that if God
[1:02:41] has given you the seed of I am the Lord
[1:02:43] the hilleth thy disease water it with
[1:02:45] praise
[1:02:46] water it with testimony water with a
[1:02:49] positive attitude don't keep digging it
[1:02:51] up and trying to check if anything's
[1:02:52] different but you could take God at his
[1:02:54] word he says just start praising how can
[1:02:57] you praise God for healing when you're
[1:02:59] sick and you don't see any evidence of
[1:03:01] it because I've got the seed of it that
[1:03:03] says by his stripes I am healed I am the
[1:03:06] Lord to healeth all died of diseases I
[1:03:09] set my word it healed them I've got a
[1:03:12] seed that I can start watering with
[1:03:14] praise
[1:03:15] because I've got it right then
[1:03:19] therefore I could say that no matter
[1:03:21] what you're going through no matter what
[1:03:22] you're experiencing
[1:03:24] we could say as David said in Psalm 57
[1:03:27] verses 7 to 11 my heart is fixed oh God
[1:03:29] my heart is fixed I will sing and give
[1:03:34] praise
[1:03:36] remember the circumstances under which
[1:03:38] David this is written of David
[1:03:40] he had fled from Saul he's hiding in the
[1:03:42] cave say between a rock and a hard place
[1:03:45] fearing for his life
[1:03:51] and in the middle of the trouble
[1:03:53] there's a request oh my soul is among
[1:03:56] lions
[1:03:58] and his requestion of God oh God I cry
[1:04:01] unto God most high God that that
[1:04:02] performeth all things for me there's
[1:04:04] prayer but not just prayer there's
[1:04:06] praise
[1:04:08] and his circumstance hasn't changed and
[1:04:10] this is this is what this I believe is
[1:04:12] so remarkable and why the psalmist wrote
[1:04:14] this
[1:04:15] is David when he ought to have been
[1:04:17] anxious
[1:04:18] when he ought to have been fearful when
[1:04:19] he could have been fretting David said
[1:04:22] my heart is fixed it's settled
[1:04:25] no this isn't Up For Debate
[1:04:27] no I my I don't my heart is not making a
[1:04:30] choice it's already fixed I'm not going
[1:04:32] to try to find out well how many people
[1:04:34] are after me or what's the percentages
[1:04:35] that this remedy is going to work and
[1:04:37] how many people have survived this and
[1:04:39] can I get in to see a specialist will my
[1:04:41] insurance cover it listen yeah we should
[1:04:44] have this attitude if my insurance
[1:04:45] covers it I won't pray if it doesn't
[1:04:46] then I'll get desperate you know it none
[1:04:49] of it matters my heart is fixed
[1:04:52] my heart is fixed oh God my heart is
[1:04:55] fixed I will sing and give praise
[1:04:59] it wasn't just oh God help me and this
[1:05:01] is fixed but it was my heart is fixed oh
[1:05:03] God my heart is fixed I will sing and
[1:05:06] give praise and then there's this
[1:05:07] outpouring of love to this faithful
[1:05:09] father here's this outpouring of
[1:05:10] adoration to God he boasts of his
[1:05:13] goodness he declares his majesty and
[1:05:15] worship he says I he says awake up my
[1:05:18] glory if you've been dormant if you've
[1:05:21] been lulled to sleep if you've been
[1:05:22] silent if I've let my lips kind of slow
[1:05:25] down and cease to praise you if I
[1:05:27] haven't let my countenance be to you
[1:05:29] whatever it is that has allowed my hands
[1:05:31] to fall slack in my voice to fall quiet
[1:05:34] he says wake up
[1:05:36] wake up my praise wake up my rejoicing
[1:05:39] wake up my hallelujahs blue devil
[1:05:42] you're gonna follow me follow me to your
[1:05:44] peril while I'm gonna wake up from this
[1:05:46] Slumber I'm going to wake up from this
[1:05:47] sleep and I'm going to Glory he says the
[1:05:49] wake up Sultry and harp I myself will
[1:05:52] awake early I will praise the O Lord
[1:05:54] among the people I will sing unto thee
[1:05:57] among the Nations for thy mercy is great
[1:05:59] into the heavens and thy truth into the
[1:06:01] clouds be thou exalted o God above the
[1:06:03] heavens let thy glory be above all the
[1:06:05] Earth I believe that as Believers we
[1:06:08] ought to have a praiseful disposition we
[1:06:10] ought to have a thankful disposition
[1:06:12] whatsoever stay you find yourself in you
[1:06:15] may not be sick today you may have had
[1:06:17] chronic illnesses your whole life but
[1:06:19] remember this wake up my glory wake up
[1:06:22] my praise I don't want to be down or I
[1:06:24] don't want to be sour I don't want to be
[1:06:26] downtrodden I want to be a believer
[1:06:29] I want to be a believer that rejoices
[1:06:31] that praise is that's positive
[1:06:35] I can stand Upon A promise when Christ
[1:06:37] is there hanging upon that cross he says
[1:06:39] it is finished and it was finished for
[1:06:41] me
[1:06:42] and that's where I stake my happiness
[1:06:44] that's where I stake my joy I find it in
[1:06:46] Christ in him alone
[1:06:49] I can believe we could all say
[1:06:50] hallelujah it is finished
[1:06:54] and there's so much power and praise
[1:06:56] that you can
[1:06:58] Praise Him
[1:06:59] until you are healed
[1:07:02] can we do that
[1:07:04] as a church we're going to have this
[1:07:06] disposition that matter no matter what
[1:07:08] happens no matter what comes our way I'm
[1:07:10] going to praise him
[1:07:12] that that's my disposition it's one of
