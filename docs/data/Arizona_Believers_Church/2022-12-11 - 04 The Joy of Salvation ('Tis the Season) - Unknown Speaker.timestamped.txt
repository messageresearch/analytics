[0:00] we've been on the subject of the joy of
[0:03] salvation
[0:04] and
[0:06] the uh
[0:08] it's a series on salvation and the joy
[0:11] that it brings and kind of making sure
[0:13] that we have the right kind of joy and
[0:16] today's title is tis the season
[0:18] and that's kind of a familiar phrase to
[0:21] us when we're borrowing this phrase tis
[0:23] the season from the traditional
[0:25] Christmas Carol Deck the Halls of
[0:27] thousand Holly and we all familiar with
[0:30] the phrase tis the season to be jolly
[0:32] and even that phrase tis the season is
[0:35] very familiar to US during this time
[0:37] it's ubiquitous now in terms of it's
[0:40] everywhere you look this time is tis the
[0:42] season something about the season but it
[0:44] didn't really enter into our language or
[0:47] our vernacular until the 1970s with if
[0:51] you're spiritual that's after the seals
[0:52] are open
[0:53] and so this phrase tis the season to be
[0:56] jolly I'm consider in some of these
[0:58] different phrases and things during this
[0:59] time of year jolly means to to be
[1:01] married cheerful speaks of Joy or
[1:03] merriment they actually
[1:04] um not sure exactly where we get that
[1:06] word Joy from and some of the different
[1:08] sources point back to Joy one of them is
[1:10] Latin from the Latin word to rejoice and
[1:14] I was just doing some studying on this
[1:16] particular Christmas Carol because I had
[1:18] this thought on my mind tis the season
[1:19] the way the Lord brought this to me was
[1:21] very unique uh found out that the the
[1:24] melody to it is from a 16th century
[1:26] Welsh uh Carol about New Year's Eve and
[1:30] about the New Years and then it's not
[1:31] until the 1860s that they put American
[1:33] or English to it and uh it was
[1:37] originally meant to be performed with a
[1:39] group of singers and and a harp and so
[1:42] when we see tis the season to be Jala we
[1:44] all say
[1:46] okay see some brave people at first
[1:48] everybody was like this is a trap we
[1:49] know this is a trap he's about to preach
[1:51] against Christmas music
[1:53] uh not yet and so the idea was that you
[1:57] know you know someone you'd sing the
[1:58] verse and then the harp would come in
[2:00] and play that part and uh I saw where a
[2:04] John Ritter he's an English composer
[2:05] said the idea was that the singers would
[2:07] come up with the first line Deck the
[2:09] Halls of palsaholi and then the harpist
[2:10] would improvise the next line and then
[2:12] they sing the line after that tis the
[2:14] season to be jolly and the harpist would
[2:16] play something so that's that's what
[2:18] we're looking at is tis the season to be
[2:20] jolly I've kind of entered that into
[2:21] your mindset but when I use the phrase
[2:23] tis the season we're going to make this
[2:25] very applicable to us as Believers we're
[2:27] looking at our reason for rejoicing and
[2:31] ask her says why are we happy why is it
[2:33] we have joy and um is it just merely
[2:36] something that's causing us to be happy
[2:37] or or is there something that we're
[2:39] happy in and last Sunday we looked at
[2:42] different types of Joy using the
[2:44] principle of cause and effect we titled
[2:47] it cause and effect some people actually
[2:48] thought it was a typo at first but we
[2:51] brought it into how Joy actually can be
[2:53] a cause itself once it's centered
[2:55] correctly and so the cause is the reason
[2:57] why something happened I might have a
[2:59] slide up there for cause and effect
[3:01] causes the reason why something happened
[3:03] the effect is actually what happened and
[3:06] so we looked at the emotion of Joy where
[3:08] it's just merely human emotion where
[3:10] you're excited about something a
[3:11] pleasure or happiness caused by natural
[3:13] things and so in context you can be
[3:15] happy and excited about anything and the
[3:18] Bible says Rejoice not when your enemy
[3:20] fails why because you can get happy
[3:22] about things that you shouldn't be happy
[3:23] about so there's an emotion of joy that
[3:26] is related to Natural things but then we
[3:27] looked at how Joy can be a happy motion
[3:30] call caused by Supernatural things and
[3:33] that the spirit of God can move and it
[3:35] can enthuse us and we can get excited
[3:37] and we can rejoice and how this fruit of
[3:39] the spirit is joy and how God's presence
[3:41] can cause people to Joy but then we
[3:43] wanted to look at joy in a different
[3:45] context that Joy was more can be more
[3:48] than just a human emotion caused by
[3:50] something but it's actual joy in the
[3:53] right thing and that's where we read
[3:55] from Nehemiah 8 10 for this day is Holy
[3:57] and our Lord neither be you sorry for
[4:00] the joy of the Lord is your strength and
[4:04] so it's not just Joy because we're saved
[4:06] when we say the joy of Salvation and
[4:09] it's not just joy that the Lord has
[4:11] given us and made us happy as some sort
[4:13] of emotion and so this is where Joy
[4:16] becomes something different the joy of
[4:17] the Lord and the joy of Salvation are
[4:18] not just an emotional effect but an
[4:21] affect themselves it's a power it says
[4:23] the joy of the Lord is your strength and
[4:26] so when your joy you're rejoicing your
[4:28] praise your happiness and your pleasure
[4:30] is in in the Lord it is your strength
[4:33] when it is when it is in the Lord like
[4:35] your happiness is to the Lord then it is
[4:37] a strength it can be a cause itself and
[4:40] so the sermon on cause and effect was
[4:42] about identifying the right cause of joy
[4:45] and even the effect of joy and how it
[4:48] can become an affect itself
[4:50] and so this is this leads me right to
[4:52] where we want to begin today and if you
[4:54] want to look at Proverbs chapter 15 this
[4:55] is where we're going to be starting
[4:57] because the joy we're talking about must
[4:59] have the right context
[5:01] when in the series on pure joy we were
[5:04] looking at something that was pure and
[5:06] something that was clean brother Branham
[5:07] says that that's our our Spirits are
[5:09] clean and they are pure and that our joy
[5:11] is in the Lord so it must have the right
[5:12] cause it must have the right context so
[5:16] our the joy that we have and if Joy
[5:18] expresses itself and some if it
[5:21] expresses itself externally or something
[5:23] that we have internally The Joy must be
[5:25] appropriate for the moment it must suit
[5:28] the moment it must it must suit the
[5:30] momentum uh if there's something that
[5:32] takes place and there's we've seen it
[5:33] before there's actually uh diagnosable
[5:37] conditions where people respond to
[5:39] trauma and sadness and loss through
[5:43] great joy and kind of enthusiasm and
[5:46] it's not the way that they're acting is
[5:48] not appropriate to the events that have
[5:49] transpired and so our joy must have the
[5:52] right cause it must be within the right
[5:54] context it must suit the momentum of the
[5:56] of the ACT actions it must suit the
[5:59] moment
[6:00] and in Proverbs chapter 15 verse 21 it
[6:03] says Folly is joy to him that is
[6:06] destitute of wisdom but a man of
[6:08] understanding walketh uprightly so this
[6:11] is a very uh
[6:13] a significant scripture because it's
[6:15] saying that Folly which is foolishness
[6:16] to me it means literally and I don't
[6:18] mean to offend anybody it means
[6:19] stupidity and some sort of senselessness
[6:21] it is uh it is folly is joy to him that
[6:25] is destitute of wisdom so if somebody
[6:27] doesn't have wisdom then they can enjoy
[6:29] being ignorant somebody doesn't have
[6:31] wisdom they can actually the Folly which
[6:33] is foolishness can be a joy to them but
[6:35] a man of understanding walketh uprightly
[6:38] so one thing just to catch at the
[6:39] beginning is wisdom is tied uh true Joy
[6:41] is tied to wisdom
[6:43] and so now we're looking at Folly and
[6:46] Folly what is what the scripture is
[6:47] saying is a person can be happy or
[6:49] derived feel a sense of Happiness from
[6:51] Folly when he lacks wisdom if you lack
[6:54] wisdom you lack understanding then you
[6:56] can enjoy foolish things so there could
[6:58] be a joy Folly is a joy to someone who's
[7:01] destitute of wisdom and so this Folly in
[7:04] the scripture is a false hope or
[7:06] expectation that in what year it's
[7:09] foolishness but you expect to get
[7:10] something from it and and in that's
[7:13] foolishness in itself and that's why
[7:14] it's called Falling the Hebrew word that
[7:16] is used there Cassel is actually
[7:18] translated to both Folly and to Hope in
[7:21] the Old Testament
[7:22] in Job chapter 8 verses 13 to 15 so are
[7:25] the paths of all that forget God and the
[7:28] Hypocrites hope Shall Perish whose hope
[7:31] that's the same word that is used of
[7:32] folly who's Folly but yet it's here used
[7:34] as hope shall be cut off and those whose
[7:37] trust shall be a spider's web he shall
[7:40] lean upon his house but it shall not
[7:41] stand he shall hold it fast but it shall
[7:44] not endure so this is a this is a hope
[7:47] or rejoicing in the wrong thing this is
[7:49] finding Joy I'm going to lean upon my
[7:51] house I'm going to lean upon my
[7:52] treasures I'm going to lean upon my own
[7:54] wisdom but it's saying that it brings
[7:56] misery that it brings weakness it brings
[7:58] destruction that what you're trusting in
[8:00] will fail you so this hope this this
[8:03] Folly that the Bible is talking about is
[8:05] actually connected to this false idea of
[8:07] Hope remember how we used hope is what
[8:09] the wrong kind of hope hope in the uh
[8:11] the in the quotations as one of the
[8:14] grinches that tries to take our joy
[8:16] because you're expecting something from
[8:18] something that it can't give you that
[8:20] something you're expecting
[8:22] then it's also translated uniquely in
[8:24] Psalms 38 7 for my loins are filled with
[8:27] loathsome disease it's actually in the
[8:29] Psalms speaking of the condition of
[8:31] being unfit for service
[8:33] and when the writers decided to
[8:36] translate this Hebrew word which is used
[8:38] to fall it's used for Folly it's used
[8:40] for Hope but now it's loins it's it's
[8:42] used to refer to someone's source of
[8:45] strength or energy
[8:47] my source of energy has been dried up
[8:50] within my loins where I should have
[8:51] ambition where I should have joy where I
[8:53] should have strength and vigor in life
[8:55] and vitality uh it's filled with it's a
[8:58] lonesome lothum's disease and I'm not
[9:00] getting the joy that I ought to have and
[9:03] so the use of the word suggests a
[9:04] longing for or a desire for the wrong
[9:08] thing and because I wanted something and
[9:11] I was expecting something and I put my
[9:13] hope in something and thought this would
[9:15] solve all my problems it's caused me
[9:16] disappointment because I trusted in the
[9:19] wrong thing it brought me shame because
[9:20] I thought I would get happiness out of
[9:22] this endeavor or this possession it's
[9:24] actually caused disappointment and so
[9:26] there is a hope there is a Folly and
[9:28] there is a joy a joy that is connected
[9:31] to the wrong thing that is a a disease
[9:34] that robs us of our strength and pulls
[9:37] virtue from us whereas true Joy is
[9:39] associated wisdom understanding
[9:41] knowledge and revelation
[9:43] that's what we want you to see in this
[9:45] that there's a Folly there's something
[9:47] where you're you're rejoicing in
[9:49] something that you ought not and you may
[9:51] say oh well I'm happy I feel great this
[9:53] is this is wonderful but if it's not
[9:55] connected with wisdom if it's not
[9:57] according to knowledge then it's a
[9:59] disappointment it's just nothing but
[10:01] Folly I actually was going to maybe my
[10:03] working title was Jolly or falling
[10:09] but it wouldn't fit on the slide in the
[10:12] fourth still brother bam said there's a
[10:13] power of the revelation of the word that
[10:15] gives septimulation of Joy to the
[10:18] believer
[10:19] stimulation of satisfaction the
[10:21] stimulation that it's Vindicated it's
[10:23] proved so this is the joy that we're
[10:26] looking at there's the power of the
[10:27] revelation of the word it says the joy
[10:29] of the Lord is my strength it's not the
[10:31] joy that he gives you that becomes your
[10:34] strength so it's not Joy remember we're
[10:35] talking about how there's some things
[10:37] that we have we're it's been it's caused
[10:40] us to be happy but that's not the joy
[10:42] the not the joy that the Lord gives but
[10:44] my joy in him my joy in his word my
[10:47] rejoicing in his truth my rejoice in
[10:49] this Revelation in my understanding of
[10:52] who he is that's what gives me strength
[10:55] you're not strong because you're happy
[10:57] you're strong because you're happy in
[10:58] Jesus You're Not Strong because he makes
[11:00] you you know takes away your Melancholy
[11:03] or takes away your depression your
[11:05] strength comes from being happy in the
[11:07] things of God because the power of
[11:09] revelation of the word gives stimulation
[11:11] of Joy to the believer it stimulates
[11:13] satisfaction the stimulation that it's
[11:15] Vindicated it's proved
[11:17] remember how he wrote in the church age
[11:19] book that a true believer's strength
[11:21] health and their liveliness is connected
[11:23] with their knowledge of and obedience to
[11:25] the pure word of God
[11:26] so the the Folly is joy to him that is
[11:30] destitute of wisdom but through the
[11:31] power of revelation of the word a man
[11:34] that has understanding walks uprightly
[11:36] shoulders back his his eyes up he's
[11:39] properly satisfied
[11:41] he's properly happy
[11:44] some of our Market enthusiasts will
[11:47] recognize this phrase It's a phrase of
[11:49] irrational exuberance
[11:51] and I originally was going to use it
[11:52] last week it just wasn't going to fit
[11:54] for time's sake but irrational
[11:56] exuberance it's used mostly with respect
[11:58] to the stock market but I think it has
[12:00] broad application in other areas but
[12:01] it's baseless optimism that lacks a real
[12:03] Foundation
[12:04] and it comes from uh I can't remember
[12:07] where he was given the speech but the
[12:08] the Fed chair Alan Greenspan I believe
[12:10] in 1996 was given a speech and in it he
[12:14] made this comment but how do we know
[12:16] when irrational exuberance has unduly
[12:19] escalated asset values he didn't know
[12:22] you're going to come here and and get
[12:24] like a lesson on how to uh get money out
[12:27] of the stock market
[12:28] but he's saying that there's times when
[12:31] people the markets are behaving
[12:32] irrational their values are being
[12:35] excessively inflated or you see a steep
[12:38] rise and some sort of value just a steep
[12:40] rise in investment and overall uh values
[12:43] are going high and he's saying how do we
[12:44] know when the excitement in the market
[12:46] isn't connected with some real value
[12:48] how do we know when everybody is doing
[12:50] it and everybody's investing and
[12:51] everybody's all in on on on bitcoin and
[12:55] everybody's all in all these other alt
[12:56] coins and how do we how do we know when
[12:58] this is really indicative of people who
[13:00] are investing rationally and it's tied
[13:03] to some real fundamental valuation so he
[13:05] says how do we know when in irrational
[13:07] exuberance is what's creating the value
[13:10] because it seems that people should be
[13:12] excited about something that has value
[13:14] but then once people start putting value
[13:17] in something it can inflate the value of
[13:19] something that has no value
[13:22] and so it's an unfounded Market optimism
[13:24] they say that lacks a real Foundation of
[13:28] fundamental valuation but instead rests
[13:31] solely on psychological factors
[13:33] in other words someone's just all worked
[13:35] up fomo right fear of missing out I
[13:38] better go all in on this uh AMC stalker
[13:41] which was there was one of them that was
[13:43] going crazy a lot of people thought
[13:44] they're going to buy houses using it but
[13:46] you never know when all of a sudden the
[13:47] the floor drops out and everyone's left
[13:50] holding the bag but it's when you get
[13:51] emotional about something without good
[13:54] reason
[13:56] and he's talking about this phrase
[13:58] irrational exuberance when people get
[14:00] excited about something without a
[14:01] fundamental valuation it creates this
[14:04] inflated asset price
[14:06] say oh you see that stock price you see
[14:08] how high it is but they're not using
[14:10] rational thinking
[14:11] they're not they're not valuing it on on
[14:13] the on they're not looking at the the
[14:15] financial statements they're not looking
[14:16] at the filings they're not looking at
[14:18] the the debt they're not looking at
[14:19] their cash flow it's just all based on
[14:21] psychological factors so I would call it
[14:24] a irrational exuberance as a baseless
[14:26] joy
[14:27] it's a baseless enthusiasm where there's
[14:29] excitement there's Emotion and Joy
[14:31] without really understanding what's
[14:33] causing the joy
[14:35] why are you all excited about that why
[14:36] why is the price going up and a lot of
[14:38] people who know would study the markets
[14:40] and look at the balance sheet would say
[14:42] we have no idea why
[14:44] we don't know why this stock is taken
[14:45] off we don't know why it's going high uh
[14:48] and so there's this irrational
[14:49] exuberance when people can get excited
[14:51] and they're and they and they like
[14:53] something and they're all for something
[14:54] but when you really get down to it it's
[14:56] just an emotion it's excitement for
[14:58] excitement's sake
[14:59] and in Romans chapter 10 verses 1 and 2
[15:01] it says Brethren my heart's desire and
[15:03] prayer to God for Israel is that they
[15:05] might be saved
[15:07] he says for I bear them record that they
[15:09] have a Zeal this is an excitement of
[15:11] mine this is some sort of order this is
[15:12] fervency of spirit they have a Zeal they
[15:15] have an enthusiasm for God but not
[15:17] according to knowledge
[15:19] so there can be a Zeal but a Zeal
[15:21] without knowledge is baseless there's a
[15:23] Zeal without knowledge is irrational
[15:24] exuberance a Zeal without knowledge is a
[15:27] baseless enthusiasm it must be connected
[15:29] to as the Bible says a man of
[15:31] understanding walketh uprightly Joy
[15:34] should be connected with wisdom Joy
[15:36] should be connected with understanding
[15:38] and our joy and this is where I'm coming
[15:40] to tis the season our joy must be based
[15:44] on the word for our day
[15:47] there should be there there cannot be
[15:48] any other inspiration there cannot be
[15:50] any other Foundation we have to find our
[15:52] joy in the power of the Revelation for
[15:54] the time that we're living in because
[15:56] what we don't want is baseless joy
[15:59] we don't want a joy without the right
[16:00] cause we do not want to be happy just
[16:03] for happiness sake
[16:05] and in Nehemiah chapter 8 verse 10
[16:09] it not only identifies to me a true Joy
[16:13] where the Bible says the a man of
[16:16] understanding walketh uprightly versus
[16:18] this Folly be enjoyed to he that is
[16:20] destitute of wisdom but Nehemiah chapter
[16:22] 8 and especially verse 10 the context
[16:25] points to the bride's Joy today what the
[16:28] bride should be rejoicing in today
[16:30] and so let's look together at Nehemiah
[16:32] chapter 8. as we go forward in this
[16:34] verse 1 it says in all the people
[16:36] gathered themselves together as one man
[16:39] into the street that was before the
[16:40] Watergate there's maybe a lot of types
[16:42] and things that we could bring here but
[16:45] they gathered together themselves
[16:47] together as one man there's this Unity
[16:49] they've been called together and they've
[16:51] spoken to Ezra The Scribe to bring the
[16:52] book of the law of Moses which the Lord
[16:54] had commanded to Israel and so we could
[16:57] say in this way the book of the law of
[16:59] Moses was lost to them it was something
[17:02] that they had not been reading it was
[17:03] something they were no longer familiar
[17:05] with being in captivity these precepts
[17:07] and the Very things that their faith
[17:09] were based upon had been eroded and
[17:11] chopped away and they'd forgotten the
[17:13] Commandments of God they had forgotten
[17:15] his precepts they had forgotten the law
[17:16] that was given to them they'd forgotten
[17:18] his promises and so they were reading
[17:20] the the Book of Genesis and Exodus
[17:22] Leviticus Numbers in Deuteronomy these
[17:24] are the words that were being read to
[17:25] them and you say well how did they do it
[17:26] well they did it from morning to
[17:28] afternoon and they were there listening
[17:31] and all that could have understanding
[17:32] were listening to the the very words of
[17:34] Genesis and Exodus Leviticus Numbers in
[17:36] Deuteronomy and what was happened is it
[17:38] was being read the word was being
[17:40] restored to them the things that had
[17:42] been lost the things that had been
[17:43] covered up the things that had been
[17:45] taken away from them through their own
[17:46] Disobedience and captivity these things
[17:48] are being restored and in verse 5 it
[17:50] says in Ezra opened the book and the
[17:53] sight of all the people
[17:54] it says for he was above all the people
[17:56] so he'd come to that Pulpit that
[17:57] wouldn't Pulpit to stand up in a place
[17:59] where he could be heard he opened the
[18:01] book and the sight of all the people and
[18:03] it says when he had opened it all the
[18:05] people stood up
[18:08] so at the time when this book is open
[18:10] and there's there's a restoration
[18:11] there's going to be a hearing of those
[18:13] things that were lost a very hearing of
[18:15] their who they were and what made them
[18:16] who they were this is what made them
[18:18] Jews this is what made them Israel is
[18:21] the god of Israel the god that had given
[18:22] the law to Moses and passed it down
[18:25] um to to the Israelites and so this open
[18:28] of the book revealed to them now as
[18:29] they're hearing this and I love this
[18:31] thought of them standing standing up
[18:33] when the book is open maybe we'll come
[18:35] to it here in a moment that with the
[18:37] opening of this book it revealed to them
[18:39] why they had been in bondage
[18:42] it it was revealing to them and they
[18:44] were hearing God said if you do this
[18:46] this is what's going to happen if you do
[18:47] this this is what's going to happen
[18:48] because remember it's the book of the
[18:49] law
[18:50] and as they're hearing it there's an
[18:52] unfolding of their church history
[18:53] there's an unfolding of how they let go
[18:55] of the truth and certain things were
[18:57] lost and certain things were no longer
[18:58] kept and observed and so as they're
[19:00] hearing this and really in one sense I
[19:02] could say that the law on its face ought
[19:04] to cause someone to cry
[19:06] the law on its face would cause someone
[19:09] to weep and so their initial response as
[19:11] the book is open and they're hearing it
[19:13] reciting uh they begin to weep but the
[19:16] truth of the opening
[19:18] demanded a different response
[19:21] and and maybe it might we might have to
[19:24] amplify this at another another moment
[19:27] in another service but the law itself
[19:31] it's judgment
[19:34] but within their word it's it's come
[19:36] bringing them to a particular place
[19:38] where at this time let's just read it in
[19:39] verses 9 and 10. it says in Nehemiah
[19:42] which is the tershafta and Ezra the
[19:44] priests
[19:45] The Scribe and the Levites that taught
[19:47] the people said unto all the people this
[19:51] day is Holy unto the Lord your God mourn
[19:54] not nor weep and so this this day in
[19:57] this first day of the seventh month he's
[19:59] saying this day is Holy unto the Lord
[20:02] but it says don't mourn don't weep
[20:05] for all the people wept when they heard
[20:08] the words of the law so there was I hear
[20:11] the book is open and I think there's
[20:12] ways that you can make this application
[20:14] that the book is being open the words
[20:17] are being spoken but as they hear it all
[20:20] they can pick out of that is reason to
[20:22] cry reason to weep and there's even uh
[20:26] and I think sometimes people are just
[20:28] kind of predisposed to being bad or sad
[20:30] and bad you know I'm glad all those
[20:33] stayed home today no um predisposed to
[20:35] being sad and they and they kind of like
[20:38] it and they could have the best day ever
[20:40] and you ask them how they go I don't
[20:41] know it was all right it's like I mean
[20:43] didn't you just get a million dollar
[20:44] raise it's like yeah but I kind of
[20:46] wanted to
[20:47] um some people just kind of like being
[20:48] that sad and disappointed and
[20:51] discouraged and there's actually one
[20:53] thing we've got to recognize is we think
[20:55] well the lord loves a broken and
[20:57] contrite spirit but there's an excess of
[21:00] grief that can be debilitating we think
[21:02] oh well this is what God must want no he
[21:04] wants you to realize at some point I
[21:07] mean there's a grieving and there's a
[21:08] broken Spirit to get out away from all
[21:11] the pretense to be honest with God about
[21:12] your your your sins and to ask for
[21:15] forgiveness and come honestly before the
[21:17] throne of grace but we ought not to be
[21:19] given to an excess of grief and so here
[21:22] are these the priests and and Nehemiah
[21:25] and Ezra saying and all the leaf I'd say
[21:27] no no you don't understand
[21:28] you're not you don't understand
[21:30] completely we understand that you would
[21:33] weep at the hearing of this we
[21:34] understand that you would look at your
[21:35] history and see the sins of your fathers
[21:37] we understand that the law itself gives
[21:39] great occasion to weep but it says this
[21:42] is the day that it's holding to the Lord
[21:43] your God
[21:44] verse 10 then he said unto them go your
[21:46] way eat the fat and drink the sweet for
[21:49] everybody who wasn't here last Sunday
[21:50] this is our scripture for this season it
[21:53] is to go your way eat the fat and drink
[21:55] the sweet
[21:57] and a combination of the carnivore diet
[22:00] and whatever you want drink the sweet
[22:01] send portions into them that for whom
[22:03] nothing is prepared for this day is Holy
[22:07] under our Lord neither be ye sorry
[22:09] it's not saying they shouldn't be
[22:11] repentant but it's saying don't grieve
[22:13] don't be sad for the joy of the Lord is
[22:17] your strength
[22:19] being point he's pointing them to the
[22:21] Joy the Levites the priests the word of
[22:24] God is pointing them to the joy that is
[22:26] power
[22:27] joy that is strength joy that is not
[22:29] that is uh is the opposite of this
[22:31] weeping and this morning that they were
[22:33] exhibiting and so we've said this before
[22:36] and I want to emphasize this rejoicing
[22:38] in the Lord gives us Inner Strength
[22:40] not just asking God to make us happy but
[22:43] being happy in him being happy in his
[22:45] promises and rejoice in the wrong thing
[22:47] will weaken the power that we need to
[22:50] fulfill his word
[22:51] and so what we could see from this
[22:54] context is when the word is revealed in
[22:56] its proper season it's the time for Joy
[22:59] not weeping
[23:00] that there's there's things that and if
[23:03] there's things that you're feeding on in
[23:04] the word of God and it just causes you
[23:05] to be discouraged it causes you to weep
[23:07] it cause you to be sorrowful then maybe
[23:09] you haven't placed it in its proper
[23:11] context maybe you don't recognize where
[23:13] it fits in God's season because their
[23:15] joy and rejoicing when the when they're
[23:17] told don't weep don't be sorry don't be
[23:19] sad they're saying they keep pointing to
[23:21] the day
[23:23] they keep pointing to the moment and to
[23:25] the time and so they had this their joy
[23:28] and their rejoicing had to be according
[23:31] to the word that was relevant to that
[23:32] day
[23:33] it wouldn't they're not just telling to
[23:35] be happy for no reason
[23:37] eat the fat drink the sweet send
[23:39] portions to those that have none these
[23:41] are things that were required by the
[23:42] word that was being restored to them
[23:44] so it wasn't just indiscriminate it
[23:46] wasn't just oh let's just get happy
[23:48] let's just get excited let's just shout
[23:49] Let's just dance when the word was
[23:52] opened the very open of the word made
[23:54] them aware of what that day meant what
[23:56] that time meant is that this isn't a
[23:58] time to be said this isn't a time to be
[24:00] sorrowful this isn't a time to be uh uh
[24:03] oh weeping and crying the word that's
[24:06] been opened up to us has enlightened us
[24:08] to the season the time that we're living
[24:09] in and it's a time to rejoice
[24:12] the very next verse verse 14 it says
[24:14] they found written in the law which the
[24:16] Lord had commanded by Moses that the
[24:18] children of Israel should dwell in
[24:19] booths in the Feast of the seventh month
[24:22] so do you notice what happened here they
[24:24] come the first day of the seventh month
[24:25] and they start reading through the law
[24:27] and if you could make application to how
[24:30] this message will actually go back all
[24:32] the way to the very beginning and then
[24:33] traces even church history and there's
[24:35] things you read that can apply to
[24:37] certain ages and apply to certain times
[24:39] and there are certain things that are
[24:40] relevant to other dispensations and now
[24:43] here they were in the first day of the
[24:45] seventh month and as the word unfolded
[24:48] it finally came to the place where they
[24:49] read whoa do you see what day it is do
[24:53] you see what's relevant for the time
[24:54] that we're living in the next day they
[24:57] res in the very next day they come to
[24:59] they realize that this is the time that
[25:01] they restored if I could put it this way
[25:04] God coincided that's what I want to say
[25:06] first God coincided God was very
[25:09] deliberate in this when all the people
[25:10] were gathered together he made it happen
[25:12] to where they gathered together where
[25:15] the timing of the openness book was at
[25:16] the time of the Feast of booths
[25:20] this is God God making sure this happens
[25:23] in this way there's this very time God
[25:25] timed the open of the book to coincide
[25:28] with the Feast of Tabernacles
[25:31] and so in verse 14 we see that they
[25:32] recognize that they're going to have the
[25:35] Feast of Tabernacles according to the
[25:36] law
[25:37] and this is this is how Feast of
[25:39] Tabernacles is described in Leviticus 23
[25:41] 40 and ye shall rejoice before the Lord
[25:43] your God Seven Days
[25:45] the Feast of Tabernacles has actually
[25:47] caused called the season of our joy
[25:50] and in celebrating the Feast of
[25:52] Tabernacles of the Feast of booths its
[25:54] Joy is referenced several times with the
[25:55] promise in other words God is saying
[25:57] this time this season is a time of joy
[26:01] there's a time for the other things
[26:02] there's a time for this there's a time
[26:04] for that there's a time for war there's
[26:05] a Time For Peace but this moment this
[26:08] time the word was opened up in a season
[26:10] where all the the the Levites and Ezra
[26:13] Nehemiah can say wait a minute wait a
[26:14] minute you've got to recognize the
[26:16] moment you're living in according to the
[26:17] word of God that's just been restored to
[26:19] us and if we were in another time maybe
[26:21] that would be okay if we were in another
[26:23] day maybe that emphasis would be fine if
[26:25] we were in another moment maybe you
[26:27] could be happy in this or be satisfied
[26:29] and weeping but now is the time of
[26:31] rejoicing now is the time of Praise now
[26:34] is the season it says of our joy
[26:37] in Deuteronomy 16 15 it says the seven
[26:39] days you're to celebrate in the presence
[26:41] of the Lord your God at the place where
[26:43] the Lord will choose because the Lord
[26:45] your God will bless you in all your
[26:47] Harvest and in everything you do and
[26:50] your joy will be complete
[26:53] it is a season of Joy it's a season of
[26:55] rejoicing and notice that what time it
[26:56] is the Harvest Time
[26:58] at the Harvest time to celebrate the
[27:00] presence
[27:02] that what they're celebrating is not
[27:03] because there's a way that we talk about
[27:05] the presence is the way we talk about
[27:06] worship there's the way we talk about
[27:07] praise and and everything to where it
[27:09] really is just that feeling that you get
[27:12] when the spirit moves and brother bear
[27:13] says some people don't even know what
[27:14] anointing is
[27:16] because they're looking only at the joy
[27:18] and the enthusiasm that God gives
[27:19] instead of them having a celebration
[27:22] because of his presence or salivation in
[27:25] his presence in his chosen place
[27:30] so this is when God the moment that God
[27:32] allowed the book to be open to Israel
[27:35] and the word the book of the law to be
[27:37] restored to them coincided with their
[27:39] season of joy
[27:41] and so to us I say tis the season
[27:45] because we must recognize our day and
[27:47] its promise in order to have true
[27:48] rejoicing are we living in the time when
[27:51] God wants us to weep are we living in
[27:52] the time where God wants us to do this
[27:53] to do that what time are we living in
[27:55] biller bam and the sermon Awakening
[27:57] Jesus is a mind of a man is always
[27:59] talking about and rejoicing what God has
[28:01] done and they're saying what he will do
[28:03] and ignoring what he's doing
[28:05] this is how we tend to uh go about our
[28:09] source of Joy we're happy about things
[28:11] that have happened or we're looking to
[28:12] look forward to things that will be
[28:14] and so he's saying that's the tendency
[28:15] of man they're always praising God for
[28:17] what he's done and looking forward to
[28:19] what he'll do and ignoring what he's
[28:21] doing now and brother bear says and in
[28:22] there miss the whole thing
[28:24] so and actually just looking back to
[28:27] what he's done and only looking forward
[28:28] to what he will do without recognizing
[28:31] what he's doing in the present speaks of
[28:33] having no understanding of what has
[28:35] happened and not understanding what will
[28:37] be
[28:38] you catch that so you cannot miss what's
[28:41] happening now and actually know what has
[28:44] happened and know what will be
[28:46] because if you can truly rejoice in what
[28:49] has been and truly rejoice in what will
[28:51] be then you have to recognize what is
[28:54] now
[28:55] he says man is always rejoicing about
[28:57] what he's done and rejoicing about what
[28:58] he'll do but not recognizing what he's
[29:00] doing
[29:01] if I got to say it this way that
[29:03] prophecy and fulfillment must align
[29:06] you can be rejoicing in Prophecy
[29:08] rejoicing in Prophecy but you must you
[29:10] must recognize what he's doing today
[29:13] you must have the you can't just have a
[29:15] balance of history in the future
[29:17] and say well he's done this and one
[29:19] he'll do that but you've got to you've
[29:20] got to possess the present reality
[29:23] I've been studying in all the places
[29:25] that Paul refers to Joy and he he is
[29:28] actually just has so many scriptures on
[29:30] it and ways that he places Joy it's a
[29:32] very rich
[29:33] uh study but he says in Philippians 4 4
[29:35] rejoice in the Lord alway
[29:37] and again I say rejoice
[29:40] there's rejoice in the Lord alway and
[29:44] again I say rejoice you find that Paul
[29:45] is constantly rejoicing
[29:48] and the reason why Paul could Rejoice so
[29:50] earnestly despite all the things that
[29:52] he's enduring and all the things that's
[29:53] taking place he said hey I'm finishing
[29:55] my race with joy I I I'm happy I I'm
[29:59] rejoicing he says therefore I rather
[30:00] Glory not rejoice in the fact that he's
[30:04] sick but while being sick he can Rejoice
[30:06] all these things and why could Paul do
[30:08] it because he recognized his day
[30:11] he had recognized his day and the
[30:13] message he had received the promise that
[30:15] was given to him as a Jew and Hebrews 11
[30:17] 39 and 40. we know this has application
[30:19] of the time we're living in now to the
[30:21] Gentile bride but look at how a Jew was
[30:23] talking about his history and these all
[30:25] these fathers of their faith the ones
[30:27] that went before him obtained a good
[30:29] report through faith received not the
[30:31] promise God having provided some better
[30:34] thing for us
[30:36] that they without us should not be made
[30:38] perfect
[30:39] so Paul in his place and even though
[30:41] he's he's going to be bringing us into a
[30:44] gentile Church age and he's a messenger
[30:46] first messenger the Gentile church he
[30:48] stands as one who's received the promise
[30:50] that was given to him as a Jew and he's
[30:52] saying that we got something better than
[30:55] they got
[30:56] and that we as it relates to the Jewish
[30:58] Church ages we have received our
[31:00] Capstone and that we have been the
[31:03] Perfection we have received the
[31:04] Perfection of their faith that they have
[31:06] received through the one that we've
[31:08] received Christ he's the one that grants
[31:10] The Inheritance retroactively to the
[31:12] Seed of Abraham and he could rejoice
[31:17] so his cause of joy
[31:19] was his brother Branham uses this phrase
[31:21] revelation of the word in its season
[31:24] he doesn't say it about Paul but I'm
[31:26] saying it because go go look up and if
[31:28] you just want to if you just want to use
[31:30] the search function uh in the in the
[31:33] message Hub or whatever app it is you
[31:35] use and just put in
[31:37] put in season and uh and just you could
[31:40] start in 65 and work your way backwards
[31:43] and you can just read forever
[31:45] because season is so he's constantly
[31:48] pointing out to the season the season
[31:49] the season and he used this phrase It's
[31:51] the revelation of the word in its season
[31:54] talks about the five must and trying to
[31:56] do God of service without it being his
[31:57] will you can listen to the one in in
[32:00] August of 65 or even
[32:03] in Shreveport later in November those
[32:04] two I would encourage you to listen to
[32:06] those but these were the five must he
[32:08] says in following God keeping his
[32:10] Commandments to do anything right for
[32:12] God to do God's service correctly these
[32:14] are the phrases he uses the five must it
[32:16] must be in his time must be in his
[32:18] season must be according to his word
[32:20] must be the person he's chosen to do it
[32:22] it must be Vindicated
[32:24] and one of the things he emphasizes over
[32:26] and over again in this sermon and he
[32:28] actually I think he even preaches
[32:29] spiritual food and due season after this
[32:31] there in August season he's talking
[32:34] about the season the season it must be
[32:36] in his season and season is the proper
[32:37] time or the suitable occasion
[32:40] season is the right moment the
[32:43] appropriate time that's what a season is
[32:45] I think I might have a slide for you on
[32:46] that season it's a proper time it's a
[32:49] suitable occasion it's the right moment
[32:53] so when we say season we say something's
[32:55] out of season it's not the right time
[32:57] and there's things that oh it's not
[32:58] seasoned for it's not seasoned for it
[33:00] it's not the right time it's the time
[33:02] which when something is in season it
[33:04] fits right
[33:06] like a word fitly spoken meat in due
[33:08] season it's like this is the moment I
[33:09] need it this is the moment we have need
[33:11] of it this is what it's for this is the
[33:13] time that we need it and brother Branham
[33:14] says and things uh trying to do God of
[33:17] service without being the will of God he
[33:19] says he regulates the Sun and regulates
[33:21] nature
[33:22] to meet his word
[33:24] how is it the sun dictates seasons in
[33:27] its nearness to the earth and the
[33:28] rotation of the Earth around the Sun
[33:31] determine Seasons times and Seasons he
[33:33] said God regulates the Sun he regulates
[33:36] nature to meet his word he regulates the
[33:38] church the predestinate the bride to
[33:40] meet the season that they are in so God
[33:42] is the one who's regulating the seasons
[33:45] God is the one who regulated the
[33:47] children of Israel coming back to
[33:48] restore rebuild the walls of Jerusalem
[33:51] to try to restore Temple worship God was
[33:53] regulated and God's the one that
[33:55] gathered the people as one man God's the
[33:57] one that caused the book to come open
[33:59] God's the one that's doing this and he
[34:01] does it in a moment at a time then when
[34:03] the book comes open what they're
[34:05] supposed to do it's in the season of Joy
[34:07] the season of their Joy the season of
[34:10] rejoicing God regulated it that way
[34:15] yet a Nehemiah
[34:17] when the book is being opened they're
[34:18] sad they're depressed the Bible tells us
[34:20] they're weeping because they didn't
[34:22] recognize the season
[34:24] they didn't recognize what was
[34:26] transpiring and what was taking place
[34:29] I could have saved this maybe for our
[34:31] segment on character disorders
[34:33] but some of you have heard of seasonal
[34:36] affective disorder
[34:37] something may suffer from it sad they
[34:40] call in
[34:41] it's it's basically it can happen in the
[34:43] summer but it's more prominent in US it
[34:45] can happen spring and summer but it's
[34:46] more prominent with fall and winter but
[34:48] it's depression caused by the changes of
[34:49] season
[34:50] and with seasonal affective disorder
[34:52] that would be related to the fall winter
[34:53] disorder the symptoms start in the fall
[34:55] and continue in the winter months and
[34:58] it's it it's characterized and we're all
[35:01] going to die self-diagnose right now so
[35:02] this is the fun part right by the loss
[35:05] of energy and moodiness and somebody's
[35:07] saying that's me every morning
[35:09] is morning a season
[35:12] and and some of the the they have
[35:14] different characteristics of it of
[35:16] oversleeping and uh an appetite change
[35:18] where you're Desiring all those really
[35:20] bad carbs or the the the high carb foods
[35:23] and so I at least have that part down
[35:25] the weight gain check tiredness low
[35:28] energy these are all ways of saying You
[35:29] must you might be being affected merely
[35:31] by the change of season
[35:33] the reason why you're feeling the way
[35:35] you are it's a feeling sad or down you
[35:36] feel the sense of loss a feeling of
[35:38] hopelessness they say it's characterized
[35:39] by I feel worthless I I feel guilty
[35:41] problems concentrating these are all
[35:43] things that happen just through a change
[35:45] of season
[35:46] and so you come into this winter season
[35:49] and people oh it's cold it's cloudy it's
[35:51] dark it's this and and the different
[35:53] things that come along with it people
[35:54] start to feel depression and it's just
[35:56] related to a season change
[35:59] and this is where if you don't recognize
[36:03] the season the purpose of the season if
[36:05] you don't know how to meet the needs in
[36:07] that season there's a way that in the
[36:09] change of season you're not getting the
[36:11] joy that you have to have in the moment
[36:13] that's coming brother said Christ is the
[36:15] word that lives in you that verifies
[36:18] everything that he promised in its
[36:20] season
[36:21] so when God regulates the season in
[36:23] whatever season we're in if we can
[36:25] recognize his regulation if he could
[36:27] recognize his purpose if we can see that
[36:29] he regulates the sign and regulates
[36:31] nature to meet his word if we see that
[36:33] he regulates the predestinated bride to
[36:35] meet the season that they're living in
[36:37] then it's his regulation that determines
[36:39] my Jubilation it's his see it's what
[36:42] he's doing that makes me rejoice
[36:46] he says another place let the light
[36:48] shine and the light will bring every
[36:50] word to its right position in its season
[36:55] as I was looking at this these things
[36:57] and considering how that God allowed the
[36:59] book to be open at a particular season
[37:01] at a particular time
[37:03] at how I just I think in my in my heart
[37:07] I realized that there can be
[37:09] just as in the book of Nehemiah and the
[37:12] word is being opened they didn't they
[37:14] didn't recognize the season
[37:16] and that's why they were weeping
[37:18] that's why they're sad
[37:20] and maybe for some of us if there's a
[37:22] little bit of a dissatisfaction and
[37:24] we're not getting the joy I remember a
[37:26] brother from New Zealand he used this
[37:29] phrase one time where he I can't
[37:30] remember if he ran in to get something
[37:32] or something happened and he said did
[37:33] you get any joy and I'm like
[37:35] I mean wasn't shopping for Joy but it's
[37:39] just a phrase they use in New Zealand
[37:40] did you are you satisfied did you get
[37:42] what you want do you find any Joy is it
[37:45] did you possess what you wanted and
[37:47] sometimes we find ourselves sad and
[37:49] we're not getting Joy because we don't
[37:50] recognize the season we're in
[37:52] could you imagine how frustrated a
[37:54] farmer would be if he's expecting a
[37:56] harvest in the dead of winter
[37:58] he doesn't recognize the season he's not
[38:00] responding appropriately to the Time of
[38:01] the Season and so there is a sadness
[38:04] that we can have because it's not placed
[38:06] correctly but I want to look at the
[38:07] other extreme if our joy and our
[38:09] enthusiasm and excitement doesn't have
[38:11] the right Source or the right aim then
[38:13] it's baseless
[38:15] it's the kind of it's the kind of Joy
[38:17] that'll uh cause us to be disappointed
[38:19] or ashamed
[38:20] and the scripture that brother Branham
[38:22] is using he uses it as his text when he
[38:24] preaches the sermon in Shreveport on
[38:26] trying to do God of service his first
[38:28] Chronicles 13 7-10.
[38:31] and he uses this as a
[38:33] the you trying to do God
[38:36] a service without it being his will he
[38:38] says they put the Ark on a new cart
[38:40] and this this isn't according to the
[38:42] word because the the ark was to be
[38:43] carried by the Levites but they put it
[38:46] in a new way a new leadership a new
[38:47] ministry must be carried by the Levites
[38:50] and took it out of the house of adnanab
[38:51] and uza and ahil were the drivers of the
[38:54] cart
[38:55] then David and all Israel made Melody
[38:58] before God with all their strength with
[39:00] songs and corded instruments of music
[39:02] and with brass instruments and horns so
[39:05] now they're rejoicing they're praising
[39:07] they're worshiping why because the ark
[39:09] is coming back to Israel
[39:11] and so we could see this the ark is
[39:14] coming back they built a cart they this
[39:16] is a new card this is the great thing
[39:18] the word has been restored the word has
[39:19] been restored isn't this wonderful isn't
[39:21] this great this is our Revival this is
[39:23] our this is our joy and when they came
[39:25] to the grain floor of chidan oozer put
[39:27] his hand to keep the Ark in its place
[39:30] for The Oxen were slipping
[39:32] and the Wrath of the Lord burning
[39:34] against us destruction on him because he
[39:37] has put his hand on the ark and death
[39:38] came to him there before God
[39:41] this occasion of Joy this rejoice in
[39:43] this great happiness that they had why
[39:45] because they aren't coming it's our Ark
[39:47] it's our word these things are ours and
[39:49] they're dancing and rejoicing but
[39:50] brother Branham is using this scripture
[39:52] as an example of how they were trying to
[39:54] do God a service but it wasn't according
[39:56] to his will wasn't according to a season
[39:59] it wasn't being done the right way and
[40:01] he said he says this and trying to do
[40:02] God of service he says now let us see
[40:04] what happened and this is what happened
[40:07] it brought death
[40:09] he says their religious emotion and
[40:11] stuff was great their intentions were
[40:13] great their Crusade was great their
[40:14] singing was great their dancing was
[40:16] great their shouting was great their
[40:17] music was great and they had the ark
[40:20] what good is the ark without God
[40:23] notice all these elements
[40:25] they had left God out they hadn't
[40:27] consulted God they hadn't done it
[40:28] according to the word they hadn't
[40:29] consulted the prophet he says it's just
[40:31] a wooden box and a couple tables of
[40:33] stone
[40:34] this is what happened they had rejoice
[40:36] and they had emotion they had dancing
[40:37] they had music they had everything they
[40:39] even could point to this the physical
[40:40] part of the Ark so by all appearances
[40:43] this is their Revival this is their
[40:45] great restoring this is their great
[40:47] rejoicing but all their activity and all
[40:49] the rejoice and resulted in the wrath of
[40:51] God because they weren't doing it
[40:53] correctly in God's time with his person
[40:55] with his Vindication in his season
[40:59] and brother Branham says he's talking
[41:00] about different uh
[41:02] whether it be water baptism and
[41:04] different things he says that when all
[41:05] this happens he said let us now see what
[41:07] happens when God and his age and his
[41:10] time is not considered just the people's
[41:12] idea
[41:14] this is what happened when God's season
[41:15] is not considered
[41:17] this is what happens when they haven't
[41:18] thought well what time are we living and
[41:21] what moment are we living and what's
[41:22] appropriate what's the appropriate
[41:24] expression for the time and for the
[41:26] moment now you could say the art coming
[41:28] back was an occasion to Joy but it
[41:30] wasn't being done according to God's
[41:31] word and if they had understood the word
[41:34] for their season they would have said
[41:35] wait a minute we can't just shout and
[41:38] dance because we're not doing it the way
[41:39] God has ordained it to be done
[41:42] brother bam said the real word of the
[41:44] season of that age was ignored because
[41:47] they had a lot of emotion
[41:49] isn't that interesting
[41:51] that emotion can Cloud our view
[41:54] and that where there's joy there's
[41:55] excitement there's enthusiasm and
[41:57] there's this sense of energy and
[41:59] inspiration we'll use that what is
[42:02] brother I'm saying the church age book
[42:03] well we get results don't we
[42:05] like they use that as the measuring
[42:08] stick they use that as the Plumb line he
[42:09] says away with experience as a Plumb
[42:11] line back to the word of God
[42:15] it says in Nehemiah 8 5 and Ezra opened
[42:17] the book in the sight of all the people
[42:20] for he was above all the people
[42:22] and when he opened it all the people
[42:25] stood up
[42:28] when he opened the book it says all the
[42:30] people stood up it was this attitude of
[42:32] attention and respect
[42:34] this is why we even stand when we read
[42:36] the word of God there's a scriptural
[42:38] basis for you saying why do you get the
[42:39] script you understand when you read the
[42:40] word of God well we do it because
[42:41] brother Branham set the example but this
[42:43] is an example that that is used in the
[42:45] scripture to say that when the book is
[42:47] open and we read from the word of God we
[42:49] stand out of respect
[42:51] but it was the this him standing up
[42:53] before the people being lifted up before
[42:55] the people in this very Act of him
[42:56] opening this anticipation we had heard
[42:59] this was going to happen we had heard
[43:00] this day was coming maybe there was
[43:01] rumors going through the camp and
[43:03] different ones had heard they found the
[43:04] book of the law and there was different
[43:05] things that were being wrecked into
[43:06] their time and like oh it's going to be
[43:08] open they stood with respect
[43:10] and now the book is open it says then he
[43:12] said unto them verses 10 to 12 go your
[43:14] way eat the fat drink the sweets and
[43:16] portions of them for whom nothing is
[43:17] prepared for this day is Holy unto our
[43:20] Lord neither be you sorry for the joy of
[43:22] the Lord is your strength
[43:24] so the levite stealed all the people
[43:25] saying hold your peace for the day is
[43:27] Holy
[43:28] neither be aggrieved
[43:30] and all the people went their way to eat
[43:32] and to drink and to send portions and to
[43:34] make great mirth because this is why
[43:37] they Rejoice because they had understood
[43:39] the words that were declared unto them
[43:41] they're rejoicing was not because the
[43:44] ark's coming back they're rejoicing
[43:45] wasn't because oh we dusted off the book
[43:47] of the law the rejoicing was because
[43:49] they understood the words of the open
[43:51] book I'll say this it's not enough to
[43:54] say this is the third pool it's not
[43:55] enough to say the seventh seal is open
[43:57] it's not enough to say this is the open
[43:59] of the word we need to understand what
[44:02] that means we need to recognize what is
[44:04] actually transpiring what is meant by it
[44:07] and trust me it's not just theological
[44:09] it's not just to itch our ears it's
[44:11] something very real and something very
[44:13] practical and it has to do with the
[44:15] season that we're in and it has to do
[44:17] with God's purpose
[44:21] it says in verse 8 so they read in the
[44:23] book of The Law of God distinctly
[44:26] and gave the sense and caused them to
[44:29] understand the reading this is what
[44:31] those who had heard is that he may have
[44:33] stood up and began to read then there
[44:34] was those who were tasked with with
[44:36] hearing what was being said and then
[44:38] they would take what was being said and
[44:39] they they taught it to the people and
[44:41] they made sure they heard he says oh he
[44:43] said this he said that and there's a
[44:44] there was a teacher there there was a
[44:46] levite there was one there who could
[44:47] stand there and he says they made sure
[44:49] that they understood they spoke
[44:51] distinctly and then they gave the
[44:53] meaning they gave the sense and they
[44:55] kept preaching the word of God so that
[44:57] the people could have an understanding
[45:01] now I hope that this isn't too hard of a
[45:03] pivot
[45:05] a hard Fork here or something
[45:08] but in Nehemiah 8 what we read in
[45:10] Nehemiah it holds a parallel to promises
[45:12] that are relevant in our day
[45:14] holds a parallel to Revelations 5 and
[45:16] Revelations 10. these are promises for
[45:17] the day we're living in I could read to
[45:19] you probably a dozen statements from
[45:22] trying to do God of service without it
[45:23] being his will where he makes reference
[45:24] to this these things he said the Bible
[45:26] said of Malachi 4 what would happen
[45:28] today Revelations 10 how the seals would
[45:31] be open and reveal all the Mysteries
[45:32] that's been hid through these reformers
[45:34] and that sermon he's pointing us to the
[45:37] time we're living in in Revelations 10
[45:39] Revelations 5 the seals would be open it
[45:40] revealed the mystery that's been hit
[45:41] through these reformers and he's being
[45:43] very explicit he's being very distinct
[45:45] he's not saying oh well maybe it'll be
[45:47] he's it's been identified perfectly
[45:49] he's been very Adam he's being very bold
[45:51] and so brother Branham is saying this
[45:54] try and trying to do God of service
[45:55] without us being his will and he gives
[45:57] the five must if I'm going to draw a
[45:59] parallel of the book being open in
[46:01] Nehemiah 8 and they're hearing the words
[46:03] of the book and you could have an
[46:04] inappropriate response because you don't
[46:07] recognize the implications you don't
[46:09] recognize the season you don't recognize
[46:11] the a moment then I say if we believe
[46:13] these things do we understand what has
[46:17] happened in this season we're living in
[46:20] because if not maybe our Jolly is folly
[46:24] think about it maybe what we're all
[46:26] happy and excited about maybe it's just
[46:27] follow you know sometimes it comes as a
[46:29] shock to people they they see the truth
[46:31] of the message of the hour and they hear
[46:32] some sort of fanaticism they hear some
[46:34] kind of cultish idea and they hear about
[46:36] some false Doctrine that's sweeping and
[46:38] they think oh well that you know that
[46:40] must just be dead and it must be dried
[46:42] up and you go to a meeting sometimes
[46:43] they're the most enthusiastic
[46:46] because a lot of emotion can still
[46:48] follow that
[46:49] and so we don't want to just convince
[46:50] ourselves because we're happy we got it
[46:52] but are we happy in what we got
[46:54] do we know what we have we have the
[46:56] right kind of joy said they made great
[46:58] mirth because they understood the words
[47:00] that were declared to them can we have
[47:02] joy because we're understanding the
[47:03] words that have been declared to us
[47:06] and I'll pick up on this
[47:08] either Wednesday or next Sunday
[47:10] I I could do it right now because I was
[47:13] prepared to preach something totally
[47:14] different
[47:15] and I didn't even know if I sent the
[47:17] right slide show I I didn't know if I
[47:19] had the right notes I was like this
[47:20] could be really interesting
[47:22] and all my friends will say have you
[47:24] considered evangelism we're there
[47:25] foreign
[47:28] but now is the bride calling
[47:31] what does that mean this is this is the
[47:33] season
[47:33] now is the bride calling
[47:36] now is when the Seven Seals have been
[47:37] opened when he says now as the bride
[47:39] calling it's not a reference to how God
[47:41] called The Bride out of every age that's
[47:43] not what the bride age is you cannot
[47:45] take the revelation of the bride and say
[47:47] well in every age there was a variety
[47:49] okay the bride age is a very distinct
[47:52] dispensation that brother oriented us to
[47:54] at the very end of his ministry he says
[47:56] now is the bride calling now is when the
[48:00] Seven Seals have been opened
[48:02] and this is brother but I'm saying this
[48:03] is the time we're living in so I know
[48:05] I'm running out of time let's look at
[48:07] Revelations chapter 5.
[48:09] I'm just going to read through this and
[48:10] we'll pick up on some of these things at
[48:13] a later time but here's the scene that's
[48:15] being set you can see that the church
[48:17] ages unfold through the first three
[48:19] chapters uh chapter four is kind of
[48:21] setting the scene but then chapter five
[48:23] is events that are transpiring between
[48:25] the seven Church ages and the open of
[48:27] the Seven Seals that unfold in the next
[48:29] chapters and this is the event that
[48:31] takes place he said I saw on the right
[48:33] hand of him that sat on the throne a
[48:34] book written within and on the backside
[48:37] sealed with Seven Seals
[48:39] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[48:41] with the loud voice who is worthy to
[48:43] open the book and to loose the seals
[48:44] thereof now I want you to recognize
[48:47] Birdman preach recognizing your day and
[48:49] its message and the whole time he talks
[48:51] about the Jews
[48:53] right because they have a day in its
[48:55] message but we've got to recognize our
[48:57] day and its message the season the time
[48:59] that we're living in and now as we read
[49:01] this think about the implications for us
[49:03] think about how brother Brown says the
[49:05] Seven Seals will be open the Mysteries
[49:06] revealed
[49:07] do we have the understanding at the open
[49:09] of this book
[49:11] so that we can have joy is it our season
[49:13] of Joy he says and it continues the
[49:16] question is whose word that open the
[49:18] book and to loose the seals thereof and
[49:19] no man in Heaven Nor on Earth neither
[49:21] under the Earth was able to open the
[49:22] book neither to look thereong and John's
[49:24] response now and I wept much because no
[49:27] man was found worthy to open the book
[49:30] to open and to read the book neither to
[49:32] look thereon
[49:33] now John's response is appropriate
[49:35] because the book he's looking at is the
[49:37] title deed it's the book of redemption
[49:38] it's the land that is the Lamb's Book of
[49:40] Life this is the book of the
[49:42] manifestation of the grace of God
[49:44] when the law is read then the
[49:46] appropriate response would be to weep
[49:48] right and and so there's a there was a
[49:51] response and the open of the law to
[49:53] where the people wanted to weep but now
[49:55] the teachers and the Levites and him I
[49:56] said no no if you recognize your day
[49:58] this is the season of Joy this is the
[50:01] season of rejoicing and if we were only
[50:03] looking at the church ages then we could
[50:05] look at the complaints and we could look
[50:06] at the failures and we could look at the
[50:07] cycle of Revival and death and we say oh
[50:09] well look at this and look at how Satan
[50:11] has worked against the church and made
[50:12] it lukewarm and Powerless and there's a
[50:14] we could have this cause for being sad
[50:16] and so when John sees that this book of
[50:19] redemption is sealed up and can't be
[50:21] read he's saying that's the grace that
[50:23] we need
[50:25] and so he cries he begins to weep and
[50:27] one of the elders saith unto me weep not
[50:30] weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[50:34] Judah the root of David this phrasing
[50:36] this even calling him the line of the
[50:38] tribe of Judah it's the only time he's
[50:40] referred to that the lion of the tribe
[50:42] of Judah though they believe the Messiah
[50:44] would come though the prophecy is
[50:45] related to Judah and this King out of
[50:47] Judah the lion of the tribe of Judah the
[50:49] root of David hath prevailed to open the
[50:51] book and to loose the seals thereof he
[50:55] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[50:56] loose the seals thereof this is this is
[50:58] why he says John John's crying John's
[51:00] crying he said stop crying hey don't you
[51:04] cry I think sometimes it's one of the
[51:05] most unfair things we say to our kids
[51:07] right you stop your crying
[51:10] the Clint's teeth bit is just something
[51:12] I do behind the pulpit
[51:14] but they we get that stop stop the
[51:17] crying it's okay to cry sometimes
[51:18] there's real good reasons to cry
[51:20] and in this case John had good reason to
[51:22] cry if the book stayed sealed
[51:25] so the angel just this person just this
[51:27] elder just doesn't say it's okay John
[51:28] stop crying
[51:30] he said don't cry because
[51:33] stop crying because the lamb or the line
[51:36] of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to
[51:38] open the book
[51:39] and in verse in verse 13 we could read
[51:42] what happens to John
[51:45] where John says every creature in heaven
[51:47] and in Earth under their third eye John
[51:48] crying out when he began to cry out uh
[51:51] blessed be blessing and honor and glory
[51:53] and Power
[51:54] to him that sitteth on the throne and
[51:56] unto the lamb forever and ever he says
[51:57] John begins to cry this out so in verse
[52:00] 13
[52:02] wait and we'll come to in a later
[52:03] surface we see John's weeping turn to
[52:06] Joy
[52:08] what had happened season had changed
[52:11] if the book's not open you should cry
[52:13] but when the book is open the season
[52:15] changed
[52:16] so when it tells me is in this there's a
[52:19] particular season where temporary Joy is
[52:21] all you should expect
[52:23] but when the season changes it's a
[52:25] permanent Joy
[52:26] Ecclesiastes 3 4 says a time to weep and
[52:28] a time to laugh and a time to mourn and
[52:30] a time to dance
[52:31] so you have a time to weep a time to
[52:33] mourn
[52:34] but then there's a time when weeping and
[52:36] mourning are no longer appropriate
[52:38] when this other time comes and this is
[52:41] what's happening to John he's crying
[52:42] he's weeping but then he's told no don't
[52:44] don't cry anymore because the lamb
[52:47] excuse me the lion of the tribe of Jew
[52:49] hath prevailed to open the book
[52:51] and this is what brother Branham is
[52:53] pointing us to and he says this is the
[52:55] time now is the bride calling now is
[52:57] when the Seven Seals have been opened
[52:59] what Seven Seals the Seven Seals are on
[53:01] this closed book in Revelations 5 1.
[53:03] this is what he's wanting us to look at
[53:05] he's saying all Seven Seals have been
[53:07] open everything's been prepared to them
[53:09] that can receive it this is a time this
[53:11] is the time that we're living and this
[53:12] is the season that we're living in and
[53:14] I'll say this you may disagree with me
[53:16] but I'm just saying what he said
[53:19] I'm not even putting any interpretation
[53:21] to it I'm just saying what he said he's
[53:23] saying now is the bride calling now is
[53:25] when the Seven Seals have been opened
[53:27] and he's saying they have been opened
[53:29] this is the time that we're living and
[53:31] so when brother Brown has come into this
[53:33] place to preach this very things and
[53:35] he's even pointing back to what's
[53:36] happened even one place he says it's
[53:38] history but brother Branham when he's
[53:40] when he comes to preach the seals
[53:43] I want to put it this way if there's a
[53:45] time to cry and a time for Joy brother
[53:47] Branham comes as a prophet and he stands
[53:49] in the breach between the morning and
[53:50] the joy
[53:52] he comes right at the season change
[53:55] seasons are changing God's the one
[53:57] that's orchestrating and what does God
[53:58] do when you need to turn a corner he
[54:00] sends a prophet
[54:01] and so when it comes time when there's
[54:02] going to be a transition there's going
[54:03] to be a change of seasons brother random
[54:05] comes and he stands in the breach I'd
[54:07] like to amplify this more later but
[54:08] brother brother Branham said that John
[54:10] was the breach
[54:11] so John the Baptist as John the Baptist
[54:14] 4 Ran So here's brother Branham John was
[54:16] a breach between the law and Grace now
[54:18] brother Branham comes in and he's going
[54:19] to be the breach between two
[54:21] dispensations
[54:22] and so if you can catch this this is a
[54:24] very beautiful thing and we're just
[54:25] going to be closing on this principle in
[54:27] the breach and Revelations 5. brother
[54:30] Branham so in Revelations chapter 5
[54:32] verse 2 you have a sealed book
[54:34] and in the in the sealed book it says
[54:37] that this is
[54:38] the book is in the hand of him
[54:41] who sits upon the throne and the very
[54:44] next thing we hear is verse two and I
[54:46] saw a strong angel proclaiming with the
[54:48] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[54:51] book and to loose the seals thereof
[54:54] now nothing is said about worth nothing
[54:56] is said about who can do it but yet this
[54:59] is the proclamation who is one that
[55:01] opened the book and loose the seals
[55:03] thereof now when we read that we feel as
[55:06] if it's an invitation to find someone
[55:08] who's Worthy
[55:10] please raise your hand if you're worthy
[55:12] please raise hands if you're worthy and
[55:14] that somehow there had been a search put
[55:15] out there's a Headhunter who's trying to
[55:17] find somebody who could crack the code
[55:19] somebody who could figure it out but
[55:21] notice how brother Branham is struck by
[55:23] this very scripture and the sermon the
[55:25] breach brother bear said this was the
[55:27] this book was the title deed to
[55:29] Redemption and it was sealed with Seven
[55:31] Seals and then an angel came forth a
[55:34] strong angel proclaiming with the loud
[55:35] voice who was worthy to open the book to
[55:38] take the book who was able to open the
[55:40] seals who was able to open the book
[55:46] here's the brother Brian I'm standing in
[55:48] the breach
[55:50] had the seven Church ages now we stand
[55:53] in the bridge because he has to he's
[55:54] preaching the breach before he preaches
[55:55] the Seven Seals because that's where we
[55:57] were that's the time that we were in now
[55:59] catch what he says the angel asked it
[56:01] John saw it and he said now who's Worthy
[56:05] let him
[56:07] and now brother Brown I'm feeling the
[56:09] weight of this scripture he stayed in
[56:12] the very moment and The Time of the
[56:13] Season that's recorded in Revelations 5.
[56:15] notice how brother Branham says this oh
[56:18] my maybe I am just feeling this way
[56:22] and when you're ready you rise he's the
[56:24] only one that could feel that way any
[56:27] one of us could have asked the question
[56:28] well who's worthy and we might have
[56:30] thought we had the answer but only one
[56:32] could say this let him
[56:36] the Ascend the angel let him he said
[56:38] here's the book of redemption here's the
[56:40] Plan of Redemption brother I said I feel
[56:42] a certain way right now I see a book
[56:44] sealed up and though the Bible says
[56:46] who's worthy he says I'm feeling a
[56:49] certain way to declare unto you not
[56:51] who's worthy but let him who is come
[56:56] oh my maybe I'm just feeling this way
[56:58] but let him let him
[57:01] he says here's the only way you'll ever
[57:03] be redeemed
[57:08] for here is the title deed of redemption
[57:10] of the whole heavens
[57:13] let him come forward if he will
[57:16] he says again oh my now speaker forever
[57:19] hold his peace let him come forward and
[57:21] claim this book
[57:22] what is brother about him feeling he's
[57:24] still in the weight of the mantle he's
[57:26] feeling the weight of the age the season
[57:28] changed and as he's preaching the breach
[57:30] he actually feels the anointing of
[57:32] Revelations 5 2. he feels the power of
[57:36] that scripture and brother Brenham
[57:37] declares he's declaring the change of
[57:40] season and he doesn't just say well
[57:42] who's worthy who's worthy and then
[57:44] nobody knows nobody knows his worthy
[57:45] nobody knows who's worthy but he says
[57:47] I'm feeling a particular way about this
[57:49] he says and maybe I'm the only one that
[57:51] can say this maybe I've got to Proclaim
[57:53] as the seventh angel messenger with the
[57:55] loud voice I'm not asking who's worthy
[57:58] but I'm saying he who is worthy let him
[58:00] come and take the book and the Bible
[58:02] says and he came
[58:05] [Applause]
[58:08] he's declaring a season change
[58:10] says in Genesis 49 verses 9 and 10.
[58:13] because it asks this this odd question
[58:15] Judah is a lion's welp he's just a pup
[58:18] this is the prophecy of Jacob going over
[58:20] his son Judah from the prey my son Thou
[58:22] Art gone up
[58:24] he stooped down he couched as a lion and
[58:27] as an old Lion now grew up from a young
[58:30] Lion now he's an old lion mature
[58:32] grown-up says who will wake him up
[58:36] who shall Rouse him up Genesis 49 who
[58:38] shall Rouse him up who will stir him up
[58:40] who will wake him up and says the
[58:41] scepter shall not depart from Judah nor
[58:43] a lord Giver from between his feet until
[58:45] Shiloh come rest peace come and unto him
[58:47] shall the Gathering of the people be
[58:50] what does the Bible telling us that
[58:52] Judah this lion to the tribaj Judah who
[58:54] will wake him
[58:56] who will stir him who will bring them
[58:58] forth listen Jesus went to the River
[59:01] Jordan because John was there and it was
[59:04] John listen you gotta we have to kiss
[59:06] this it was John that the presence of
[59:09] John is what brought Christ to that
[59:12] place into that season for him to say
[59:14] Behold the Lamb of God who takes away
[59:16] the sins of the world and brother
[59:18] Branham is standing there in
[59:19] Jeffersonville under the weight of
[59:21] Revelations 5 2 and he says let the lamb
[59:23] come let the worthy one come let him
[59:26] take the book
[59:28] well he's rousing up the line of the
[59:30] tribe of Judah he's stirring him he's
[59:32] causing him to rise and to take his
[59:33] claim
[59:35] the Bible says in Revelations 5 7-10 and
[59:37] he came and he came can you say that and
[59:41] he came and took the book out of the
[59:44] right hand of him that sat upon the
[59:45] throne
[59:46] Watch What Happens and when he had taken
[59:49] the book
[59:50] that whole taking of the book
[59:53] I think there's a lot of this that's
[59:54] misunderstood but it means to choose
[59:56] means to collect
[59:58] it means to lay upon
[1:00:00] so I almost said Tis the seizing
[1:00:03] right we've been using some word plays
[1:00:05] this is the time to seize
[1:00:07] this is the time when he says oh maybe
[1:00:09] I'm just feeling this way he says let
[1:00:11] him come forward and claim
[1:00:13] this book
[1:00:15] let him come forward and seize it let
[1:00:17] him come forward and take it Christ is
[1:00:19] the mystery of God revealed he says
[1:00:20] you're the book
[1:00:21] let him come forward and take it he
[1:00:23] comes three times he comes time to save
[1:00:25] his bride and later he's going to come
[1:00:26] with his bride but then he comes to take
[1:00:28] his bride
[1:00:29] this is the season that we're living in
[1:00:31] he says and when he had taken the book
[1:00:33] this is what happens the four beasts and
[1:00:34] four and 24 Elders fell down before the
[1:00:36] lamb having every one of them harps
[1:00:39] tis the season
[1:00:41] right
[1:00:43] it's sung by those you have to have a
[1:00:45] coral then you have to have a harp if
[1:00:46] you're going to sing tis the season to
[1:00:48] be joyful to be happy and the harps are
[1:00:51] playing having every one of them Harps
[1:00:52] and golden vials of odors which are the
[1:00:54] prayers of saints and they sung a new
[1:00:58] song
[1:00:59] well this isn't a song you could sing
[1:01:01] before that when they crossed over the
[1:01:03] Red Sea they begin to sing a song of the
[1:01:06] horse and the writer have been cast into
[1:01:07] the sea no one could have imagined that
[1:01:09] tune no one could have properly written
[1:01:11] that tune no one could have adequately
[1:01:13] been inspired to sing it with an
[1:01:15] understanding but once God who gave the
[1:01:18] promise they would be delivered and come
[1:01:20] out with the mighty hand when they could
[1:01:21] look back and see that God had done it
[1:01:24] according to his word and they were in
[1:01:26] the season then they sang a new song
[1:01:28] oh I believe that we have occasion to
[1:01:31] sing new songs that have never been sung
[1:01:33] before
[1:01:35] and they sung a new song saying Thou Art
[1:01:38] Worthy to take the book and to open the
[1:01:39] seals thereof
[1:01:41] what is it they did as they began to
[1:01:43] fall down on their face they bowed their
[1:01:45] heads and worshiped the Lord with their
[1:01:46] faces to the ground of Nehemiah
[1:01:48] now they begin to worship now we're
[1:01:50] worthy to take the book and open the
[1:01:51] seals thereof for thou was slain this is
[1:01:53] the song has redeemed us to God by the
[1:01:55] blood
[1:01:56] like blood out of every Kindred and
[1:01:58] tongue and people and Nation this has to
[1:01:59] be a gentile song
[1:02:01] he says it has made us into our Gods
[1:02:03] Kings and Priests
[1:02:05] we shall reign on the Earth
[1:02:08] brother Branham refers to it
[1:02:11] I believe it's in the seals maybe the
[1:02:12] seventh seal
[1:02:13] when he's looking at these scriptures he
[1:02:15] says this is a time when everything must
[1:02:16] be worshiped
[1:02:18] because it's the season
[1:02:20] he said this is the time now when the
[1:02:22] seventh seal is open now there's it's
[1:02:24] worship everything must be worship
[1:02:27] I want you to ponder this phrase real
[1:02:28] deeply brother Branham when he's
[1:02:30] preaching the church agencies John must
[1:02:32] have really had a Pentecost of his own
[1:02:35] I like that
[1:02:37] because John already had a Pentecost
[1:02:40] but now now he has a Pentecost of his
[1:02:43] own
[1:02:45] now is a now it's a different season
[1:02:47] it's a different time he says John must
[1:02:48] have really had a Pentecost of his own
[1:02:50] brother man says talk about a happy time
[1:02:52] when then seals broke
[1:02:55] when the when the book was opened before
[1:02:57] Israel the the Levites were quick and
[1:02:59] said no now's not a time to cry Now's
[1:03:01] the Time To Worship Now's the Time To
[1:03:03] Praise Now's the Time to Rejoice because
[1:03:05] that was the season and when this seven
[1:03:07] sealed book is opened up it's a season
[1:03:09] of worship it's a season of Joy it's a
[1:03:12] season of Praise it's a season of
[1:03:13] Happiness not enthusiasm for enthusiasm
[1:03:16] sake not to be happy just to be a
[1:03:17] worshiper not just to be charismatic not
[1:03:20] to just be Pentecostal but the bride has
[1:03:23] a Pentecost of her own this is her
[1:03:25] Reviving this is her Joy what is it it's
[1:03:28] Christ making himself known
[1:03:31] when the bride begins to line herself up
[1:03:33] with the word of God that's your
[1:03:35] rejoicing that's your Revival it's an
[1:03:37] understanding it's a knowledge it's in
[1:03:39] Revelation
[1:03:41] that's our new song
[1:03:45] brother Branham says makes this
[1:03:47] statement in the breach musicians please
[1:03:49] come
[1:03:51] and the sermon the breach
[1:03:54] Abraham's describing this scene he says
[1:03:56] the lamb proceeded out into the vision
[1:03:58] now
[1:04:03] I want you to notice we read
[1:04:06] when we I'm getting into my next one
[1:04:11] just looking at the clock
[1:04:13] we're just just into the after hour
[1:04:17] said the bride we could sit hour after
[1:04:19] hour right drinking in these things
[1:04:22] but I'm going to touch on this maybe
[1:04:23] it'll just kind of wet the whistle a
[1:04:25] little bit for next time
[1:04:27] we usually read it that Behold The Lion
[1:04:29] of the tribe of Judah and then we see
[1:04:31] the image of a lamb
[1:04:33] and the order sometimes causes us to
[1:04:35] miss what's happened
[1:04:37] he was the lamb but now he's the lion
[1:04:40] that's what's changed he didn't change
[1:04:42] from a lion into a lamb he's introduced
[1:04:44] as the lion
[1:04:46] though he even though he had been the
[1:04:47] lamb
[1:04:48] so what is it there's a name change
[1:04:50] there's something changed
[1:04:52] there's something changing in this time
[1:04:54] in this season he says the lamb
[1:04:55] proceeded from the vision come from the
[1:04:57] father's Throne he says oh think where
[1:04:59] did he advance from to this vision
[1:05:01] he come from Glory where he seated the
[1:05:03] right hand of God
[1:05:05] he Advanced forth to John out of Glory
[1:05:09] now this is the part that I want you to
[1:05:12] to recognize for ourselves
[1:05:18] he says all would not it be glorious
[1:05:23] if our sinful thoughts tonight could be
[1:05:25] laid aside long enough to accepting him
[1:05:28] he would Advance all the way from Glory
[1:05:31] tonight to make himself known to anyone
[1:05:34] the lamb advancing from glory for
[1:05:37] intercessions to make claims now for his
[1:05:40] Redemption
[1:05:42] that's what's happened in the bridge
[1:05:43] Brothers preaching the breach we'll
[1:05:45] touch on this next time or at least
[1:05:47] hopefully next year even maybe if
[1:05:49] necessary
[1:05:50] but think about now brother I'm standing
[1:05:52] there and he's going to be the one later
[1:05:53] on in the sermon says oh maybe I'm just
[1:05:56] feeling this way brother Abraham yes
[1:05:58] you're the only one that could feel the
[1:06:00] weight of that calling you're the only
[1:06:01] angel that could Proclaim that and he
[1:06:04] actually utters the very words let him
[1:06:07] come and claim this book
[1:06:11] he says let him come now
[1:06:13] a forever hold his peace you realize
[1:06:15] brother Madam had been trained for that
[1:06:17] moment
[1:06:18] as a young man he learned the price for
[1:06:20] not being where he should be when he
[1:06:23] ought to be there when he didn't go to
[1:06:24] the Pentecostals when he was supposed to
[1:06:26] brother Adam paid the price when he
[1:06:28] wasn't walking in the vision that one
[1:06:30] time brother Branham had been trained
[1:06:31] and molded whatever you do don't miss it
[1:06:34] because everything hangs in balance at
[1:06:37] that very moment he says oh this is the
[1:06:41] only way you'll ever be redeemed here's
[1:06:43] the title deed of redemption of the
[1:06:45] whole heavens and earth can you think
[1:06:46] about what hung on that moment in
[1:06:48] brother Bam's desert had he not been
[1:06:50] there in that moment where would we be
[1:06:53] he had to be there in that moment God
[1:06:56] orchestrating his Angel God orchestrated
[1:06:58] his star so he could come to that very
[1:07:00] place let him come
[1:07:05] and he gives us this invitation
[1:07:08] wouldn't it be glorious if he would
[1:07:10] Advance tonight
[1:07:12] all the way to make himself known
[1:07:14] to make claims for his Redemption
[1:07:17] would it not be glorious if we could
[1:07:20] just put our sinful thoughts aside
[1:07:22] long enough to accept him
[1:07:25] could you receive him
[1:07:27] this is the time this is the hour that
[1:07:31] we're living in
[1:07:32] [Music]
[1:07:33] oh I say
[1:07:36] I'm so thankful for this messenger
[1:07:39] I'm so thankful for how faithful he was
[1:07:42] to speak these things to us
[1:07:45] there's
[1:07:46] statements
[1:07:49] brother Branham says
[1:07:56] he's identifying just how odd and
[1:07:58] peculiar it might be
[1:08:00] and how people may look at it and
[1:08:03] question it
[1:08:05] he says I know it sounds strange to you
[1:08:08] but God has Vindicated it so perfectly
[1:08:12] you realize what the the Grinch wants to
[1:08:15] steal the joy that's related to this
[1:08:19] what he wants to take okay I'll give you
[1:08:22] another word play he wants to take away
[1:08:23] the presence
[1:08:25] he wants you to believe that what we
[1:08:27] have is just what's always been
[1:08:29] right just another just another order of
[1:08:32] the church ages and he wants to take
[1:08:34] away the very reason for the bride's
[1:08:36] rejoicing the very reason why we could
[1:08:38] be happy he wants to rob that from us
[1:08:40] this is something that when Jesus says
[1:08:43] you'll see me again in that Joy
[1:08:47] no man can take away from you all right
[1:08:49] because it's the season of Joy if we can
[1:08:52] recognize our death say away with the
[1:08:53] seasonal affective disorder away with
[1:08:55] being sad this is the time to Rejoice oh
[1:08:58] if he could put aside our carnal
[1:09:00] thoughts love it put aside the people's
[1:09:02] ideas long enough to accepting him
[1:09:06] he is our joy he is our peace I'm
[1:09:09] thankful for this
[1:09:10] I Want To Praise Him for this I I'm not
[1:09:14] just I'm not just happy because he sent
[1:09:16] it I'm happy in what he sent I'm happy
[1:09:19] and wanty revealed I'm happy in what
[1:09:21] he's doing I can even say that my joy as
[1:09:24] your pastor is in you the very bread of
[1:09:27] life has brought you forth you're the
[1:09:29] very manifestation of his presence you
[1:09:31] are the Vindication that the badship is
[1:09:34] here I'm rejoicing in that I don't
[1:09:37] rejoice in anything else I have no other
[1:09:39] Glory but in the work of God and what
[1:09:42] he's doing that's my praise that's my
[1:09:44] joy that's my happiness
[1:09:47] or how we could be thankful
[1:09:51] a prophet stood here in the breach and
[1:09:53] said let him
[1:09:55] come
[1:09:56] tis the season
[1:09:58] for worship for joy
[1:10:02] thank you for the cross
[1:10:09] thank you for your nails
