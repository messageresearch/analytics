TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'd like to take a second part on the title Kingdom Builders and if you could maybe just look over in Isaiah chap 11 quickly as we want to touch on a few verses there and I'm going to spend some time in the outset relaying a little bit of a foundation uh so that we're all on the same page and that'll so we'll just use this opportunity in the beginning to uh collect a few thoughts instead of just prefacing it with a few comments we'll just look into the scripture in Isaiah chap 11 if you were to read Around verses 6 to verse uh 10 verse 11 you'll see that there's a description of the the wolf and the lamb dwelling together the cow and the bear feeding together uh eating a lion eating a straw like an ox a child playing before the hole of the ASP and uh nothing shall hurt or destroy in all my Holy Mountain it's describing a millennial we call it a millennial Condition it's a Thousand-Year Reign so Millennial has come to be used as an adjective to describe a time of Peace A Time time of righteousness a time of perfection and this is this description is carried over in other parts Isaiah 65 and a lot of different places we see this Thousand-Year reign of Christ upon the Earth uh it's a kingdom it's a kingdom upon Earth wherein uh sin is held uh held at Bay and righteousness Reigns on Earth for a Thousand-Year period and verse 9 describes it this way they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea what I'm going to summarize last couple Services is is say this that knowledge has the effect of purifying that the knowledge of God fills the entire Earth as the waters cover the sea and because the knowledge of the Lord is filling up things it it has the effect of cleaning out it has the effect of purifying and when it speaks of the knowledge of the lord we can think appropriately about understanding and wisdom and Revelation those are other ways to describe how that this knowledge may be utilized or how that it might come or how what it would look like and so these things uh have the effect of purging the world and establishing a kingdom upon Earth where in Christ is the preeminent one through his bride and in all the world it creates this we call a millennial Kingdom in verse two it says this and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord and shall make him of quick understanding the fear of the Lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears ears this tells us that this is why there's going to be this Kingdom upon Earth if there wasn't a king there couldn't be a kingdom and this Kingdom requiring a domain and a king uh there's this dominion over the entire Earth uh because and and because he has this Dominion it produces that peaceful Kingdom om and what we're wanting to bring before you is that this Christ Millennial Reign parallels what he can do when he reigns in our hearts now the effect that Christ literally reigning on Earth for A Thousand Years brother brandham said the third coming is when he returns back to Earth in a Corporal body he said that's the coming most people are looking for why they're looking for a physical return of Christ uh but that when he comes back physically to the Earth and he's here literally on the earth and his literal presence upon the Earth Earth in reigning with his bride is going to produce this glorious Kingdom and I'm want you to see a parallel of what that reign will be in the Millennium to what his Reign right now literally in your soul can cause through the word of God as Paul writes that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith so it's Christ who dwells in your heart it's the king upon his throne in your individual lives and if a reigning King will produce a condition in the Millennium then could he not do that in you now that's that's what we're wanting to inspire you at least getting you to think about now Ephesians chapter 1 verse1 17 says this is Paul's prayer that the Lord the that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him again now this is a lot of review from the prior service Paul's prayer is that we would he would give unto this the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him I'm going to summarize some stat that we read from the church age book but brother Bram is detailing this is me me summarizing you'll see this very very plainly there in in the church age book that the that the operation of the Holy Ghost in the bride is Vindicated by the Revelation it gives amen now think about that the operation of the Holy Ghost is Vindicated by the Revelation it gives now that's going to work counter to what we think the operation of the Holy Ghost is because we think the operation of the Holy Ghost would be C some kind of manifestation of the spirit through physical demonstration uh maybe someone being slain in the spirit or or somebody shouting or dancing or crying or speaking in tongu some gift manifest itself and you say well that's that's the operation of the Holy Ghost absolutely but it brother Bram through several passages is trying us to understand that the operation of the Holy Ghost in the bride will vindicate Itself by the Revelation it gives because the Holy Ghost can't reveal something contrary to the word and that and that can the word cannot be imperson everything else can and so he he details how that Revelation by the holy spirit is what gives us authority over the devil that's that's real genuine Authority Revelation by the holy spirit gives us authority over the devil and he's saying there's nothing as such prevailing power so there's no greater power than the power of Revelation can you catch that principle maybe jot it down if you want to put a question mark next to it um that's what I do in my notes if something said and I want to go back and look at it I'll put a question Mark kind of highlight it you're fine to use a question mark today is is there no greater power than Revelation well brother says there's nothing as such prevailing power as Revelation he said that the importance of it to a True Believer can never be overemphasized so there's a lot of weight to Revelation and brother bradam says in the patmas vision he says if there's anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit so if there's any good that'll come it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it Bears amen uh we it's often quoted I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither has entered in the heart of man the things that God has prepared for them that love him and people stop there but Paul says but he hath revealed them to us by his spirit and it's important to catch the context Paul is saying this while he's saying hey I didn't come to you uh with the Excellency of speech or wisdom when I declared to you the testimony of God in other words he's saying I declared to you things that you couldn't know know by human study or human discipline and I've declared to you the things that have been revealed to me and that's Vindication that this is God when God's making himself known and revealing himself so it made manifest by the results it bears and that's another good thing it's confirmed by the word and it manifests itself as surely as John needed to be in the spirit that was a real thrust of that last service how what it means to be in the spirit as John was in the spirit he heard he turned he was turned and he saw and that's what when you're in the spirit you're going to hear the word of God it's going to turn you and you're going to see and so John needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the Revelation Revelations that God has given to us to live by in his word for it is the same spirit amen we must be in the spirit and we must understand what it means to be in the spirit or or if I could put it this way we must understand the most important aspect of being in the spirit is not how it makes us feel in mind or body but what it does to our understanding Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter 14: 14 and 15 for if I pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful much larger thought that is's expressing how in speaking in tongues we sound like barbarians and there gives an uncertain sound and how is someone going to know how to prepare for battle it's a much larger thought but for time's sake I just wanted to bring this out he's saying my understanding does not benefit what I'm saying what is being done there's no benefit to it when I pray with an unknown tongue he says my spirit prays but my understanding is unfruitful what is it then I will pray with the spirit now brother Ram quotes this in this patas Vision I believe he said I will whatever I do I'll sing I'll pray I'll dce whatever I'll do I'll do in the spirit he says I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the understanding also I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the understanding also if I could say this to be in the spirit brother B show is to be in the spirit of Revelation people don't dig down deep enough to get in the spirit of Revelation to be in the spirit is to be in the spirit of Revelation and to be in the spirit of revelation will manifest itself in wisdom and understanding so Paul is saying if I'm going to pray in the spirit let it be also with understanding in the with in the understanding with the understanding I will sing in the spirit and I will sing with the understanding also so that it might edify that it might build up that it might be fruitful so recognize how he's saying that with the spirit is being joined with the understanding there's a there's a unity and a Harmony between the two and Paul says in Galatians chapter 3:3 he says are you so foolish there this is just kind of pointing my finger to a lot a lot more teaching in this this book he says are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh we could make a parallel behind between what Paul is recognizing the galatian church how they began in the spirit uh they had heard of Christ and they believed and now they're being brought back into Jewish Traditions it wasn't that they if I could say they left Jewish Traditions but what they were believing in as Jews is being fulfilled in Jesus Christ and so there was no point in going back to the things that God used to foreshadow what was coming there was no point to go back to certain traditions and certain manifestations and certain works and certain things because the the substance had come and so now that the substance had come that the Traditions had worked and they could move on now there's a tremendous parallel in our day between the Jewish traditions and the Jewish legalism if I could even put it that way and the Pentecostal tra and I want to say lowercase p Pentecostal traditions and legalism that we ourselves having been called out of it can go go right back to in the same way that the Jews were going back to their traditions and their legalism as if to say it didn't bring them to where they needed to be and we need to be very careful because we've had a message come at this hour and take the Pentecostal Church where God had brought them and they had established traditions and they had a certain way of worship and God wanted to bring them into the full truth and I believe the message could be the same today don't be foolish and go back to carnal things to try to be made perfect cuz what makes perfect not the flesh not the not these certain traditions of the flesh or legalism none of that can be can make us perfect there's a true genuine Pentecost and then there's there's a perversion of it because couldn't we say that the true genuine Judaism and Jewish religion was now embodied in Christianity they were real Jews cuz they had received their Messiah so there's a there's a falseness to holding to former lights and former glares and as Paul is talking about praying in an unknown tongue he says if I pray in an unknown tongue my understanding is unfruitful and we use this parallel maybe of what's become and been made as Pentecostal Traditions or legalism brother BR been talking about tongues and we could even say in some way certain manifestation of the gifts he's identifying this in the church and he says your Pentecostal version is already backed Genesis again in Babel so there is a Pentecostal version of gifts and tongues that brother bam says is back in Genesis as a tower of babyl in confusion because there are there's Traditions associated with the operation of the Holy Ghost that present a certain way and brother Bram saying now that's a version that's not necessarily the original is everybody with me in the sermon uncertain sound brother bam says they shall speak with new tongues now that we recognize that as being prophetic being scriptural but there's a certain way that that manifested on the day of Pentecost which was outstanding and and Beyond what Paul is talking about or is exactly what Paul was trying to identify that if you speak in an unknown tongue and other people don't understand that's for yourself that's in the spirit nobody's going to take that away from you but that's not what was the original amen because brother brandham says they shall I don't mean the uncertain sound this is him giving his some emphasis to this prophecy they shall speak with knowledge with Revelation they had the real gift of speaking in tongues said every man heard in their own language but what we're not told just exactly what they were even saying right people weren't sitting there saying well he just said Fifi tie your bow tie on right that wasn't what they were saying they were hearing something that there was something being said of weight and substance brother bradam says that to speak in new tongues if it's the genuine Pentecost and not some other Pentecostal version that's trying to be passed off he says they spoke with knowledge and Revelation and that was the real gift of tongues brother baham says new tongues is spiritual Revelation if you want to speak in true genuine original genuine version of Pentecost you speak with wisdom you speak with understanding you speak with spiritual Revelation am they shall speak with knowledge with Revelation brother bam says in Satan's Eden he says brother Neville say this morning someone might not have someone might have been asking him why I didn't preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't I do this here it is the Holy Ghost is the action in you and and I'm sure what it was is why aren't you preaching on uh the gifts and why aren't you preaching on uh the Holy Ghost and what it can do in a church service and how it can manifest itself and maybe there's a little conjecture on my part but based upon what he says here he says I'll tell you the Holy Ghost is is action is the action in you it's a li life not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence why don't you teach on the Holy Ghost and speaking in tongues and shouting and dancing and screaming and running around why don't you do that why don't you encour encourage that emphasize that he says well because that's not really what it's about I that would be the wrong emphasis I think sometimes the reason why we would default to that is because we've lost our faith in the power of God and we're trying to convince ourselves the message is right by producing a pep rally that makes us feel good about it he says the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of fleshly evidence but it is a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age of this age not another age but this age right watch the Holy Ghost In Action not so much in demonstrations and I believe what he's referring to in this in demonstrations because you don't want to completely do away with demonstration that's where you go on the wrong other side but he's talking about your Pentecostal version of it which is right back in Babel again confusion and nonsense and Chaos he says not so much in demonstrations if we could say maybe not an emotion and some sort of fleshly evidence but an action what it does according to the word what it does according to the word that's the Holy Spirit In Action amen so he says not so much in demonstrations in 1 Corinthians chapter 2: 4 and 5 we're looking at the power of God and how that Paul connects this with something he says and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and the power so his speech and preaching were a demonstration of the spirit and the power but not enticing words of man's Wisdom that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God what is the most prevailing power Revelation could we say could that be the greatest power it's the most prevailing it's the strongest so Paul is not carving out and excluding wisdom Revelation understanding and I think it's important for us to think about this because when he makes a statement such as when I came to you not with the Excellency of speech or of wisdom then we H declar to you the testimony of God in our minds we think that oh then the power of God has to be demonstrated through some sort of fleshly sign on alone like that's real power you can say everything you want you can say whatever you want and say it and say it and teach it and place it do everything you want but that's not the power of God the power of God is when it does something to me right and that would be missing it that would be missing what Paul is saying cuz he's not saying there was no speech and there was no preaching and it wasn't it was just like Paul said I'll show you the power of God right that's not what he was doing he said I demonstrated the power of God through my preaching because the most prevailing power is revelation what was he preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ the Revelation for that age brother Bram in the revelation of Jesus Christ is chapter one of the church age book now we've been talking about the offices and manifestations of the one true God and beholding His glory in a scriptural study but he is not to be known intellectually this is what Paul is talking about I'm not coming to you with my ideas not coming to you with Traditions I'm not not coming to you with studies of the Rabin I'm not coming to you uh with uh interpretations I'm coming to you with Christ who is being spiritually revealed he says he is known spiritually by spiritual Revelation the spirit of man cannot know God it is the Revelation given by the spirit that allows man to know God it's the only way that you can know him nobody can say that Jesus is Christ except by the Holy Ghost ghost no man can know the father no man can know the son except to whom the father reveals him so now is he's talking about speech and preaching and the demonstration of the spirit and the power in 1 Corinthians chap 2: 12 and 13 now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God how are they given they're revealed yes they're revealed by the spirit as he said but God hath revealed them to us by his spirit so we have received the spirit which is of god that we might know we have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that we might know by Revelation the things of God which things also we speak so what was it that Paul was kind of circling back to to say this is where the power was CU I wasn't preaching to you things that you could find in our old tradition I wasn't preaching to you things that you could figure out on your own I was preaching to you things that God has revealed to me by his spirit and that's the power of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual that's the power of God the inside teacher teaching us the things of God and brother bam takes this very scripture and this is and as he points out to this scripture and he reads from it and makes reference to it 1 Corinthians 2 and I think in the church age book it might say verse 14 or 15 but it's this this he's saying comparing uh spiritual things were spiritual and using these verses here this is how brother Bram uh summarizes it the true Revelation is God interpreting his own word by vindicating what is Promised the true Revelation is God interpreting his own word by vindicating what is Promised man's Wisdom lacks the Holy Spirit teaching right man's Wisdom lacks the Revel ation and it is only by the word that we can know that we're overcoming it is only by Revelation that we can overcome that is that is how that we overcome and so we can't we cannot make the mistake of belittling and devaluing where the power of God rests so he comes to verse seven or we're going to arrive at verse seven here and Paul says but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world under our Glory so it calls it the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery so the hidden wisdom of God is a mystery the hidden wisdom of God is what he's preaching and he says we speak it in a mystery and we understand that if I can say this wisdom is the principal thing with all thy therefore get wisdom the Bible says so wisdom is the principal thing we speak the wisdom of God in in a mystery even the hidden wisdom uh uh hidden uh hidden wisdom now again in the church age book brother BR says not the wisdom of God is a mystery says but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear you got to have the teaching of the spirit or the wisdom of God never becomes clear and as long as it remains unclear it can't be fully effective for you how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know if there's one thing we ought to call upon God for more than anything it's Revelation if there's anything we ought to lay on the horns of the Altar for anything more than anything it's to hear and to know he tells us beyond anything else if you want to lay before God and say God give me the gift of speaking in tongues Lord I want to speak in tongues brother bam said if you lay before the altar long enough God will let you do it and tongues is a gift of the spirit it's wonderful but the emphasis was never on I want to pray enough till I start shouting I want to sing enough till I start dancing he says not to open ourselves up to some sort of fleshly evidence but to lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know I say maybe once we start hearing and knowing that's when the real Joy Bells begin to ring that's when the real manifestations begin to follow so wisdom is a mystery a mystery is only known by Revelation and so then think of the importance of knowing the mystery right I wanted to point to a couple scriptures real quickly just so we could have this kind of lodged in our thinking uh the the concept of a mystery the concept of Revelation is no unfamiliar topic to us as message Believers but if the holy spirit is to come and Quicken every word of this age then there's prophecies that relate to this age that must be quickened to us or requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear there's things that God has promised to do in this age very specific prophecies that God has promised to do in this age I remember one time I was in a pastor's home and I uh we were just Fellowship was good Fellowship as before we were going to be ministering that weekend and the brother made a comment there's so many scriptures in the Bible brother Aaron that have yet to be fulfilled that we believing that God's going to fulfill and I thought awesome right like this is great and I was like well which ones are you thinking about because I at the moment at that moment I thought that we're going to get into some good stuff and I was like well which ones are are you referring to and he goes well I don't have a Bible on me brother Aaron I I can't show you all the scriptures that haven't been fulfilled that we're believing in and at that moment I thought wait a minute there's this is this is a little bit different setting and situ situation that I thought I was in because I'm in a pastor's home you're in the in the Bible Belt I mean you're going to fall and hit a Bible in his house right and so I was going to get my phone out and say well here we go tell me what words to search for I want to know the scriptures in this hour that need to be fulfilled I want to understand and come to find out the the the brother was leaving the message uh because he lack spiritual Revelation but there are scriptures pertaining to this day and this hour that we must know by the teaching of the Holy Spirit Luke 17:30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed the revelation of the son of man is one of the most critical uh truths in this hour that we're living in right now and you're not going to be able to study that out and figure it out you're not going to be able to humanly get into that you're not going to exercise your way into that you're going to have to have the Holy Spirit revealed to you the son of man in this hour right one of the most critical scriptures of the message Revelations chap 10 as the Lord himself descending with that book open but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel verse 7 when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets we're living in the day when a mystery of God's going to be completed a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or never becomes clear if the son of man's going to be revealed it's going to take the spirit of God to reveal the son of man oh we're never going to know him now you can say what somebody else is saying you can repeat what the prophet said you might even try to go beyond that and rephrase what he said but unless the holy spirit is revealing it to you you're only going to lean out further lean out further and get further away from what he was saying and if you're just repeating what somebody else said you don't actually know by the spirit the son of man in this hour so when he said he speaks the wisdom of God in a mystery it's going to take that takes a revelation to do that and takes a revelation to know that now in Matthew chapter 16 Christ asked the question who do you who do men say that I am there's a lot of speculation well some say you're this some say you're that truly those answers could have come just by study discipline uh kind of running the metrics well you look like this prophet and there's a prophecy of this and you some say you're this some say you're that who do you say that I am said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God in verse 177 Jesus answered and said unto Peter he said blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven has revealed to him that this was the Messiah flesh and blood cannot do that and I say unto thee thou that thou art Peter so now Simon is now given a name change I'm going to call you Peter which is Stone Upon This Rock and this is where the Catholic Church gets it wrong they think they're talking about Peter being the rock but it's Revelation that's the rock Upon This Rock I will build my church upon the rock of Revelation you there if there's no Foundation of Revelation then then there's no elevation you've got to have the rock of Revelation otherwise God's not going to build on it if you're if something's being built on a foundation other than Revelation then it's not Christ that's building cuz he's not going to build on anything else except the Rock of Revelation I will build my Church on the Rock of Revelation and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail over us but we will prevail over them with what Revelation in our lives and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on the Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on the Earth shall be loosed in heaven remember how we pointed out earlier in this series all hell is against this Revelation because what we're seeing here is the knowledge to open the power of the Kingdom takes Revelation to do it brother Bradman who is this mesic says the whole Bible is the revelation of God the whole church is built upon the revelation of God there's no other way to know God Only by Revelation and It quotes the scripture to whom the son will reveal him you can't know God unless he's revealed to you amen good he says Revelation everything is revelation I don't think it'd be wrong to say Revelation is everything everything is revelation the whole church is built upon the revelation of God so not to accept the Revelation then you're just a cold Theologian and there's no hope for you hey you want to know what it takes to be a cold Theologian just deny the power of Revelation right that that's it because I think sometimes we think a cold Theologian is somebody who's just very dry and who just stands up behind the pulpit and just very dry you know read scriptures and read quotes and we say well that's just a cold Theologian no all you got to do is deny Revelation I don't care how hot you are how passionate you are about what you're preaching if you cannot accept the Revelation then you're just a cold Theologian now we're making wonderful time this morning we might we might get to the youth meeting sooner than later now I want to just kind of summarize some Concepts that are very familiar to us in the message we know that faith is a revelation of God's will a and so there's a symmetry even if we're not they're not synonymous that faith is a revelation so if you say faith it's Revelation you say Revelation it translates to Faith so there's there there's some components where they work together and when we talk about faith we're talking about a Revelation when we talking about Revelation you're talking about faith so there's something that joins that together a a and perhaps if you were to divide that what you might get is intellectual understanding or you might get intellectual Faith but when they both work together that's real faith and so we understand according to the teach of the message that re faith is a revelation of God's will now we also understand through volumes of statements in the message of the hour that God's will is his word amen so Faith's final resting place is on on the word of God faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God faith is a revelation of God's will so it kind of creates this this big picture of how the word of God is what brings the Faith by Revelation that the word being revealed to us gives us faith that if the word has not been revealed to us then we really don't have faith that's right amen if if I if I told you something that the Bible said and you accept it upon the basis that it's in the Bible now that can be a faith but when it's revealed to you that makes it the that makes it the faith so some substance faith and you can say and brother B I know he goes through levels of Faith Revelation Vision a a and that's maybe a whole separate area but I want you just to kind of see how it works in your daily life that when you read something in the word of God and it's revealed to you what do you say I know right I know by Revelation and that's faith and so what it hasn't happened it's just as good as it hasn't happened because it's been revealed to me because that's how this process works when God reveals to you something that's the real power there's a lot of things you can do right now by discipline by education our young people may be honoring their father and mother in the home by not doing this and not doing that and it's through discipline and training and education and instruction and say well I promise mommy I'm not going to cut my hair I promise Daddy I'm not going to go smoke a a dope I promise I'm not going to do that cuz it's not right it's not good let me say this as long as it's under instruction and it's under discipline or it's under that legalism there's no power in you to say no but as soon as you get the Revelation youve got the power inside of you to deny all the temptation of the world because there's nothing of such prevailing power as Revelation and that's what we need more than anything is revelation that's right now think then in terms of the very Ministry of Malachi 45 who to turn the hearts of the children to the the faith of their fathers and that's a a lot of language that brother bam uses and it's a restoration of the faith and a restoration of the faith will take a revelation of Jesus Christ for this age right and brother brandham says in the church age book and in this age the Leo Dean the revelation of God will come in its due time it will not falter neither will it be premature so he says think on this and heed it well we would say today Ponder think on this and heed it well for we are in the end time today the the the the revelation of God will come in its Due Time Won't falter won't fail won't be premature it's going to come here's brother Brandon writing this in the church age book The revelation of God will come there will be a revelation of God to stir the bride there will be a manifestation of the spirit to catch the elect's attention and it's a revelation of God that's going to come and he says this is something we ought to think on we ought to consider this because it will come the son of man will come and reveal himself the ministry of God will be finished am and it takes a revelation to see these things it's important to note in Luke chapter 18 as Jesus gives the parable of the unjust judge and the Widow who constantly wearies him and finally the unjust judge is like you know what aveng her you know cuz she's driving me crazy and and Jesus says hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear along with them I will I tell you that he will avenge them speedily this is Vindication this is identification that the elect who are crying out to God for the revelation of God to those who are looking for him to those who desire him in this season here as he's referring to he says I will avenge them speedily so there's going to be a Vindication that comes there will be a manifestation there's going to be a Deliverance but notice what he says at this time of vindication and deliverance nevertheless when the son of man cometh so he's bringing this back to the coming of the son of man which is the revealing of the son of man and notice what is going to be an issue shall he find faith on the Earth Earth so when the son of man is being revealed what's the most important thing what is it he's looking for is he looking for outward demonstrations is he looking for a fleshly evidence is he looking for some Pentecostal version of it or is he looking for Faith I know the Bible says that i' actually had been preparing a sermon to minister on it and not maybe I'll just get it out of the way right here the Bible says fear not believe only and I want to say don't fear believing only that there can be such a nasty stigmatism placed on believing in only believing and sure there's been some scarecrows of easy believism but let me say easy believism whatever that ism is has never done away with only belief and Never Be Shaken off the foundation that I can believe the word of God and I can stand upon his eternal promise and that's all he's asked me to do and the rest is up to him that's good because what he's looking for is faith not looking for anything else not looking for someone say me look at me look at me no you don't even have to be moving and he'll see the faith that's what he's looking for his faith he's looking for Revelation now if you've been waiting for me to get to my title of Kingdom Builders here we are I had to go back and just bring some of these things about so he could really begin to think about just how important Revelation is and through some of these very direct things I trust the holy spirit is speaking to you Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it brother B has drawn a lot from this in the church age book how but we will prevail over them when we can discern and withstand by spiritual Revelation the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church you can be an invincible Army by spiritual discernment amen when he says Upon This Rock what ises he talking about Revelation the church is built upon Revelation and he takes in that statement he says Thou Art Peter which is Stone and Upon This Rock I will build my church now think of how interesting this is if you could just kind of get this picture in your mind he's referring to ration but then he calls Peter a stone and says Upon This Rock I'll build my church now he has a foundation and you have a builder but he's now brought Peter into view as a stone so now he's got his materialen so now think of this brother says in the sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed it's an individual one person all hell is against this teaching amen all hell is against this truth but it is the truth Jesus never said now Peter you and John and all the rest of the people you've got the Revelation now the whole church is saved listen it's not going to be a group Movement we cannot make the mistake that denominations have made throughout Generations is trying to find comfort in a group movement or a group umbrella to feel oh well because these this is what's happening in a group context then I'm in the I'm in the Revival no you are the Revival let it be a Revival in me is what brother bradam said we've got to recognize this solemnly and convincingly deep down within our souls that I am an individual that has been born into the kingdom of God and thank God that there's other individuals around us we can fellowship with and worship with and there's men of God preaching this great truth around the world but I'm standing on my T toes I'm standing on a Firm Foundation as an individual so Jesus never said Peter you John and all the rest of the people you've got the Revelation now the whole church is say no it was to him personally I say to thee thee not them to thee Thou Art Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the word Peter means a stone stone means the confessed one notice the separate one Upon A Certain Stone Upon A Certain thing a called out the church called out upon this Stone upon this Revelation so there he brings that see how now he's connecting it upon this Stone Upon This Rock I'll build my church that's a stone that's a rock that's a foundation and now he's bringing Peter into it by saying upon this Stone upon this Revelation Flesh and Blood never revealed it to you but upon this Revelation called out group I will build my church in them amen hu and all the gates of hell will never be able to stand withstand it amen Revelation is the foundation amen Revelation is the rock but now not only is it the foundation it's the means and material yes sir by which God will build his church amen God does not establish us upon the foundation of Christ and the revelation of Jesus Christ and then build upon it wood hay and stubble right God doesn't take the Divine the deity the revelation of Jesus Christ and he builds the foundation of Jesus Christ and then he's going to build upon that Humanity in [Music] carnalismo it's going to be Stone upon Stone upon stone brick upon brick upon brick the foundation of the revelation of Jesus Christ and then the building up of Jesus Christ by Revelation upon that Foundation it's that stone upon the rock Revelation is not only the foundation but it's the means and the building material of the Bride amen he said I want to get you built up in the Holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour why was he preaching the revelation of this hour because that's the building material Revelation is the building material of God's Church it's the building material of our individual spiritual house in 1 Peter 2:5 ye also as Lively Stones living stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood you are stones in God's Building you are a spiritual house knowledge is power Revelation is power to build us up into powerhouses of God I'm not I I I know that there may be some things uh there may be ways that Revelation is preached and teaching is preach to where it tries to rob the people of of of a of overcoming life to explain way this and it's okay if you do that it's okay if you do that we got the word we got the word that's okay it's no I'm wanting I'm wanting the real power God to be loose in your life without restraint and however God wants to move in your life to manifest himself I encourage it amen because we we trust the Holy Spirit right if something starts happening it's not according to the word you you're just going to find yourself correct and you're going to moderate and so when these things are preached maybe sometimes they're preached in such a way to where it Waters down the life and Holiness and overcoming power maybe it Waters down the manifestation of God in a church service or the or or Miracles and signs and wonders no there there's there's no there's no doing away with that why because that's in the word listen understand this when we say word only then if it's in the word we believe it amen when people say it's not the word only they want to chop up the word and make it their own idea and so it's not the word only it's actually only this word on and they break it up so there's this is I'm wanting to encourage a real a real work of God in our lives but it's got to be in the right place got to be the right foundation we're talking about being Kingdom Builders we're addressing Kingdom Builders and Proverbs chapter 9 verse1 I hope this can kind of all come together as we've tried to build talk about what Revelation is now just for the last several minutes we've been looking at the context of Revelation being Building Material right amen it's the foundation it's the stones upon which the F it's the and the stones that rest upon that Foundation Proverbs chapter 9 verse1 I was doing really good at time until you got involved and now I'm running out of time Proverbs chapter 9 vers1 wisdom hath build her house sheath heun out her Seven Pillars now if we can look at God says wisdom hath builded her house what a statement what a substance but God by his wisdom framed the worlds and as God built the habitation for all creation by his wisdom and here it's saying wisdom builds her house she hews out Seven Pillars now what is this wisdom this wisdom is the power of God Jeremiah 10:12 he hath made the Earth by his power he hath established the World by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion God's power is connected with his wisdom it was manifested in his creating his establishing his ordering by his power he made the heavens and earth and what was that by his word by faith in his own word is what brother brandham says that's the power of God is faith in the word of God and he establishes it he makes it firm and he secures it by his wisdom and is the extent of it is by his discernment by his discretion by his understanding that's the power of God and it says in 1 Corinthians 1:24 but to them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God now this is we just point you to Something in the message of the hour the word which is Christ is God's intelligence wisdom hath builded her house this is his mysterious wisdom and it build it's a builder just as God made the Earth by his power and established the World by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his discretion Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God builds it establishes it secures it orders God is a god of order not a god of chaos amen God's a god of stability he's he's a god of purpose it says that wisdom hath builded her house wisdom is the kingdom Builder true wisdom builds the kingdom of God in your life heun out Seven Pillars the use of seven there speaks of completeness and sufficiency Perfection uh the reference to Seven Pillars it's that that act of guiding and supporting raising a structure up when you have pillars it's lifting something up and there's different maybe interpretations of what these pillars are you can find even a parallel to the fruit of the spirit but just taking even from the Proverbs and how wisdom manifests itself these pillars of wisdom and understanding and counsel and strength and knowledge reverence fear of God these are the pillars that hold up the house am this is what makes something that's built upon a rock remain secure and it says that it hath Hune out her Seven Pillars which means to divide to cut out it's used as a Mason cut into a stone perfectly to fit its place in a building and it's amazing how that someone is even sharing with me recently about how even in think it was brother Matthew Watkins even in the wall the building of the temple wall that Still Remains they still they can't figure out how they did it right there's ways that they cut the way they shaped the way that they move these things and place these things well we're not even quite sure how they even managed to do this in that day and age we're we're not even sure we could do it exactly the same way in our day and age why cuz they had a way of hewing things out cutting things structuring things so it could be placed properly so that it could endure it's not just cobbling stones on top of stones all right any one of you think it's just easy to build a stone wall go ahead and try it sometime and you go by and you see walls that have been built somewhere by somebody who knows how to build a wall using just whatever Stones they find a and it's still there today hundreds of years later because somebody knew how to take the shapes they knew how to set them together and they don't even necessarily need anything to glue them together they just know how to stack them you ever seen a real Mason work with a brick it's a beautiful thing they'll just pick something I go and they know just exactly how to place it all together and they do this with stones they do it to place something where it belongs it's just not a matter of gathering Stones it's just not a sake of trying to collect information you've got to have it heun out you've got to have wisdom to build the house the foundation's been laid now we need wisdom to to build the house and to heue out the Seven Pillars to cause this bride to rise up in her real power and Glory brother brand in the sermon the end time evangelism says what good are Stones if you haven't got a stonemason to shape them out these are some Ponder points right here and confessions is Stones when Peter made his confession Jesus said Thou Art Peter a little Stone but what good is a stone if there isn't a stone Mason there to shape him into a Son of God you're just piling up a bunch of rocks is that right isn't doing a bit of good the water wearth away the stone see that's right that's the people what good are Stones if you haven't got a true stonemason with a good sharp tool to shape them into the Fitting Place in the house of God this is what we need more than ever is the king sword the sword of the word of God shaping Our Lives to cause us to fit into the house of God just want to ask you what goods the decision what good you putting your name on the book what good is it to come and join the church if the stonemason isn't there that'll shape that make them quit this and that and cut them and make them over this way and square them up and make them like Christians that set in the house of God with signs following the Believers Hallelujah let's get the faith first cuz the faith will follow the signs will follow them that believe those that are being shaped will have a life following them that's the end time evangelism taking the stones and shaping them what good would the stones be if you just pile them up let them lay where they're at might do a little better out there than they would piling them up together wait what what good is it just piling them into a room if you can't shape them he's actually he's actually kind of you know maybe just some conjecture here he's kind of saying you know they might just be better out there they might be better out in the world and just try to gather them into lodges true and pile them up good very good if there's not a stonemason if there's not a holy spirit teaching sir shaping guiding if it's if wisdom isn't hewing out Seven Pillars if the word is not being preached in love to raise us up into the stature of a perfect man amen might do a little bit out there than they would piling them up together they might be needed out there and none of them out there see that's right stone is no good without a stone Mason and then this now you can see what he's talking about Jesus counts character not members amen cuz he's talking about the forming forming of character you know that he counts characters not members I think the statement is said quite often it's kind of maybe cliche that God doesn't count as people he weighs them in the sense that he's looking at the character of the people the beauty of the church is the character of the people you don't count the empty seats to try to figure out whether or not you've had a good church service you think about what the word did in your heart what is it it done to press itself on my character what is it doing to shape me CU wisdom builds the house in Proverbs 24: 3-6 through wisdom I want to come back to these scriptures as we want to soon be getting into maybe a series on the house of God through wisdom is a house builded and by understanding it is established and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches a wise man is strong yay a man of knowledge and increaseth strength we read where the translation is in knowledge is power for by wise counsel Thou shalt make thy war and in a multitude of counselors there is safety amen this is pointing us back to the power of Revelation as Paul said that God would Grant to you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him Spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him not the spirit of wisdom not the Excellence of speech not enticing words but that the revelation of Jesus Christ could be preached to you and that you would hear and turn and see amen and that the light of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord could fill you up as he makes himself known to you and that's the building of the spiritual house takes Revelation to build you up as a Christian through wisdom is a house built by understanding it is established and by knowledge it's filled now I'm I'm going to end on a statement from ever present water from the rock we'll invite the musicians to come and I'm going to end with this statement and I want you to let it you let you just grab a hold of this and you let the Holy Spirit lead you into the applications of this because this is coming to a spot where I think I maybe got I want to at least preach one more uh service on the Builder Kingdom Builders at least one more I think and bring it right down to some relevant things there was a lot of wonderful Fellowship yesterday morning at the brother's breakfast the father Sons got together for breakfast just fantastic fellowship and some of these things were coming up and Lord it's just beautiful see this coming to a place where it's practical and the sermon now everpresent water from the rock I hope that you can kind of let everything that we've been preaching about this morning kind of zero in and narrow in and I hope this can be just a Clincher he says we are now in Heavenly places I believe that we were uh used this quote when we ministered on augmented reality on faith in a series on Divine Healing we are now in Heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection now let's concentrate for just a few more moments if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God would create them a world out here and go live a private life on it that's the power inside of a believer that power is with you now am in one place says you don't need more power you need more knowledge how to use the power well that comes to the law sometimes we think the law means that and and is certainly applicable that the law just says you can't do it but the law says how you're supposed to do it the law do say I'm sorry can't create a world the law says the law says oh if you're going to create a world this is the wisdom and knowledge and Revelation how to do it and so you can't do it unless you have the knowledge of how so he says we could create a world and go live on it you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you you got power to do it oh let it shake away all the cobwebs of Doubt take anything that binds us today and causes us to fear and tremble and shake it away from us if you've got the shadow of the power of God and you've got power to create a world and go live in it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power of God that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live in on on it Hallelujah think about it now think about this Kingdom Builders you've got power to speak a world in existence and go live on it Hallelujah there you are that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's a law of faith I I know I know you may think this serves my purpose it's a law of Revelation it's a law of character Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatsoever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours every place The Souls of your foot can set upon by faith God giv it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you what is it Revelation Hallelujah you see what I mean the power is controlled if you are a son of God if you are a daughter of God that never leaves you it's with you all the time and you're Des spare in your weakness and your mistakes in your sickness and your weakest moments that power has never left you he said but your faith gets away from it but it's still there the power is still there I just need Revelation to operate it I just got a little bit away from it but I have inside of me a power that Revelation can use amen and could I I asked this question to close if we've got power to create another world and live in it then you've got power to change the world you're living in think about it if you've got power to build another world and go live another private life on it you've got power to build a world now amen right here yes your Kingdom Builders if you can build another place if you could build another kingdom if you could build another realm and leave here and live in it could you not stay here right now in leod deia in Satan's Eden and be a kingdom Builder right here on Earth H right here today build the kingdom of God in our lives in our families in our homes right here in my heart if I've got power to create another world and leave I've got power to change the world I'm in amen hallelujah I hope it inspires us to be real Kingdom Builders there's been far too many false Kingdom Builders and false kingdoms being erected but let wisdom heue out her seven pillers let it build in me a kingdom rise with me today stand with me today
